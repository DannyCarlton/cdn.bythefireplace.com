  Harry was back with the general in a few hours, but now he was  allowed a  little time for himself.  It seemed to occur suddenly to  Jackson that the  members of his staff, especially the more youthful  ones, could not march  and fight more than two or three days without  food and rest. 
  &#8220;You've done well, Harry,&#8221; he said&#8212;he was beginning to call the  boy by  his first name. 
  The words of praise were brief, and they were spoken in a dry tone,   but they set Harry's blood aflame.  He had been praised by Stonewall   Jackson, the man who considered an ordinary human being's best not  more  than third rate.  Harry, like all the others in the valley army,  saw that  Jackson was setting a new standard in warfare. 
  Tremendously elated he started in search of his friends.  He found  the  Invincibles, that is, all who were left alive, stretched flat upon  their  sides or backs in the orchard.  It seemed to him that St. Clair  and  Langdon had not moved a hair's breadth since he had seen them  there  before.  But their faces were not so white now.  Color was  coming back. 
  He put the toe of his boot against Langdon's side and shoved gently  but  firmly.  Langdon awoke and sat up indignantly. 
  &#8220;How dare you, Harry Kenton, disturb a gentleman who is occupied  with his  much-needed slumbers?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;General Jackson wants you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Old Jack wants me!  Now, what under the sun can he want with me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He wants you to take some cavalry, gallop to Washington, go all  around  the city, inspect all its earthworks and report back here by  nightfall.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're making that up, Harry; but for God's sake don't make that   suggestion to Old Jack.  He'd send me on that trip sure, and then have  me  hanged as an example in front of the whole army, when I failed.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I won't say anything about it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're a bright boy, Harry, and you're learning fast.  But things  could  be a lot worse.  We could have been licked instead of licking  the enemy.  I could be dead instead of lying here on the grass, tired  but alive.  But, Harry, I'm growing old fast.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How old are you, Tom?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Last week I was nineteen, to-day I'm ninety-nine, and if this sort  of  thing keeps up I'll be a hundred and ninety-nine next week.&#8221; 
  St. Clair also awoke and sat up.  In some miraculous manner he had   restored his uniform to order and he was as neat and precise as usual. 
  &#8220;You two talk too much,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I was in the middle of a  beautiful  dream, when I heard you chattering away.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What was your dream, Arthur?&#8221; asked Harry. 
  &#8220;I was in St. Andrew's Hall in Charleston, dancing with the most   beautiful girl you ever saw.  I don't know who she was, I didn't  identify  her in my dream.  There were lots of other beautiful girls  there dancing  with fellows like myself, and the roses were everywhere,  and the music  rose and fell like the song of angels, and I was so  happy and&#8212;I awoke to  find myself here on a hillside with a ragged  army that's been marching  and fighting for days and weeks, and which,  for all I know, will keep it  up for years and years longer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've a piece of advice for you, Arthur,&#8221; said Langdon. 
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Quit dreaming.  It's a bad habit, especially when you're in war.   The dream is sure to be better than the real thing.  You won't be  dancing  again in Charleston for a long time, nor will I.  All those  beautiful  girls you were dreaming about but couldn't name will be  without partners  until we're a lot older than we are now.&#8221; 
  Langdon spoke with a seriousness very uncommon in him, and lay back  again  on the ground, where he began to chew a grass stem meditatively. 
  &#8220;Go back to sleep, boys, you'll need it,&#8221; said Harry lightly.  &#8220;Our  next  march is to be a thousand miles, and we're to have a battle at  every  milestone.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You mean that as a joke, but it wouldn't surprise me at all if it  came  true,&#8221; said Langdon, as he closed his eyes again. 
  Harry went on and found the two colonels sitting in the shadow of a  stone  fence.  One of them had his arm in a sling, but he assured Harry  the  wound was slight.  They gave him a glad and paternal welcome. 
  &#8220;In the kind of campaign we're waging,&#8221; said Colonel Leonidas  Talbot,  &#8220;I assume that anybody is dead until I see him alive.  Am I  not right, eh,  Hector?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Assuredly you're right, Leonidas,&#8221; replied Lieutenant-Colonel  Hector  St. Hilaire.  &#8220;Our young men don't get frightened because they  don't have  time to think about it.  Before we can get excited over the  battle in  which we are engaged we've begun the next one.  It is also a  matter of  personal pride to me that one of the best bodies of troops  in the service  of General Jackson is of French descent like myself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The Acadians, colonel,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;Grand troops they are.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is the French fighting blood,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel Hector   St. Hilaire, with a little trace of the grandiloquent in his tone.   &#8220;Slurs have been cast at the race from which I sprang since the rout  and  flight at Waterloo, but how undeserved they are!  The French have  burned  more gunpowder and have won more great battles without the help  of allies  than any other nation in Europe.  And their descendants in  North America  have shown their valor all the way from Quebec to New  Orleans, although  we are widely separated now, and scarcely know the  speech of one another.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's true, Hector,&#8221; said Colonel Leonidas Talbot.  &#8220;I think I've  heard  you say as much before, but it will bear repeating.  Do you  think, Hector,  that you happen to have about you a cigarette that has  survived the  campaign?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Several of them, Leonidas.  Here, help yourself.  Harry, I would  offer  one to you, but I do not recommend the cigarette to the young.   You don't  smoke!  So much the better.  It's a bad habit, permissible  only to the  old.  Leonidas, do you happen to have a match?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, Hector, I made sure about that before I asked you for the   cigarettes.  Be careful when you light it.  There is only one match  for  the cigarettes of both.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll bring you a coal from one of the campfires,&#8221; said Harry,  springing  up. 
  But Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire waved him down  courteously,  though rather reprovingly. 
  &#8220;You would never fire a cannon shot to kill a butterfly,&#8221; he said,   &#8220;and neither will I ever light a delicate cigarette with a huge,   shapeless coal from a campfire.  It would be an insult to the  cigarette,  and after such an outrage I could never draw a particle of  flavor from  it.  No, Harry, we thank you, you mean well, but we can do  it better.&#8221; 
  Harry sat down again.  The two colonels, who had been through days  of  continuous marching and fighting, knelt in the lee of the fence,  and  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire also shaded the operation  with his  hat as an additional protection.  Colonel Leonidas Talbot  carefully  struck the match.  The flame sputtered up and his friend  brought his hat  closer to protect it.  Then both lighted their  cigarettes, settled back  against the fence, and a deep peace appeared  upon their two faces. 
  &#8220;Hector,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot, &#8220;only we old soldiers know how  little it  takes to make a man happy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You speak truly, Leonidas.  In the last analysis it's a mere  matter of  food, clothes and shelter, with perhaps a cigarette or two.   In Mexico,  when we advanced from Vera Cruz to the capital, it was  often very cold on  the mountains.  I can remember coming in from some  battle, aching with  weariness and cold, but after I had eaten good  food and basked half an  hour before a fire I would feel as if I owned  the earth.  Physical  comfort, carried to the very highest degree,  produces mental comfort  also.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Sound words, Hector.  The starved, the cold and the shelterless  can  never be happy.  God knows that I am no advocate of war, although  it is  my trade.  It is a terrible thing for people to kill one  another, but it  does grind you down to the essentials.  Because it is  war you and I have  an acute sense of luxury, lying here against a  stone fence, smoking a  couple of cigarettes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is, Leonidas, we are happy when we have attained what we have   needed a long time, and which we have been a long time without.  It  has  occurred to me that the cave-man, in all his primitive nakedness,  must  have had some thrilling moments, moments of pleasures of the  body,  the mind and the imagination allied, which we modern beings  cannot feel.&#8221; 
  &#8220;To what moments do you allude, Hector?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suppose that he has just eluded a monstrous saber-toothed tiger,  and has  slipped into his cave by the opening, entirely too small for  any great  beast of prey.  He is in his home.  A warm fire is burning  on a flat  stone.  His wife&#8212;beautiful to him&#8212;is cooking savory meats  for him.  Around the walls are his arms and their supplies.  They eat  placidly  while the huge tiger from which he has escaped by a foot or  less roars  and glowers without.  The contrast between the danger and  that house,  which is the equivalent to a modern palace, comes home to  him with a  thrill more keen and penetrating than anything we can ever  feel. 
  &#8220;The man and his wife eat their evening meal, and retire to their  bed of  dry leaves in the corner.  They fall asleep while the frenzied  and  ferocious tiger is still snarling and growling.  They know he  cannot get  at them, and his gnashings and roarings are merely a  lullaby, soothing  them to the sweetest of slumbers.  You could not  duplicate that in the  age in which we live, Leonidas.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, Hector, we couldn't.  But, as for me, I can spare such  thrills.  It seems to me that we have plenty of danger of our own just  now.  I must say, however, that you put these matters in a fine, poetic  way.  Have you ever written verses, Hector?&#8221; 
  &#8220;A few, but never for print, Leonidas.  I am happy to think that a  few  sonnets and triolets of mine are cherished by middle-aged but yet   handsome women of Charleston that we both know.&#8221; 
  Harry left them still talking in rounded sentences and always in  perfect  agreement.  He thought theirs a beautiful friendship, and he  hoped that  he should have friendships like it, when he was as old as  they. 
  But he and all the other prophets were right.  The restless Jackson  soon  took up the northward march again.  He was drawing farther and  farther  away from McClellan and the Southern army before Richmond, and  the great  storm that was gathering there.  The army of Banks was not  yet wholly  destroyed, and there were other Northern and undestroyed  armies in the  valley.  His task there was not yet finished.  Jackson  pushed on toward  Harper's Ferry on the Potomac.  He was now, though to  the westward,  further north than Washington itself, and with other  armies in his rear  he was taking daring risks.  But as usual, he kept  his counsels to  himself.  All was hidden under that battered cap to  become later an old  slouch hat, and the men who followed him were  content to go wherever he  led. 
  The old Stonewall Brigade was in the van and Jackson and his staff  were  with it.  The foot cavalry refreshed by a good rest were marching  again  at a great rate. 
  Harry was detached shortly after the start, and was sent to General   Winder with orders for him to hurry forward with the fine troops under   his command.  Before he could leave Winder he ran into a strong  Northern  force at Charleston, and the Southern division attacked at  once with all  the dash and vigor that Jackson had imparted to his men.   They had, too,  the confidence bred by continuous victory, while the  men in blue were  depressed by unbroken defeats. 
  The Northern force was routed in fifteen or twenty minutes and fled   toward the river, leaving behind it all its baggage and stores.  Harry   carried the news to Jackson and saw the general press his thin lips   together more closely than ever.  He knew that the hope of destroying   Banks utterly was once more strong in the breast of their leader.  The  members of the staff were all sent flying again with messages to the   regiments to hurry. 
  The whole army swung forward at increased pace.  Jackson did not  know  what new troops had come for Banks, but soon he saw the heights  south of  Harper's Ferry, and the same glance told him that they were  crowded with  soldiers.  General Saxton with seven thousand men and  eighteen guns had  undertaken to hold the place against his formidable  opponent. 
  General Jackson held a brief council, and, when it was over,  summoned  Harry and Dalton to him. 
  &#8220;You are both well mounted and have had experience,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You   understand that the army before us is not by any means the only one  that  the Yankees have.  Shields, Ord and Fremont are all leading  armies  against us.  We can defeat Saxton's force, but we must not be  caught in  any trap.  Say not a word of this to anybody, but ride in  the direction  I'm pointing and see if you can find the army of  Shields.  Other scouts  are riding east and west, but you must do your  best, nevertheless.  Perhaps both of you will not come back, but one of  you must.  Take food  in your saddle bags and don't neglect your arms.&#8221; 
  He turned instantly to give orders to others and Harry and Dalton  mounted  and rode, proud of their trust, and resolved to fulfill it.   Evening was  coming as they left the army, and disappeared among the  woods.  They had  only the vague direction given by Jackson, derived  probably from reports,  brought in by other scouts, but it was their  mission to secure definite  and exact information. 
  &#8220;You know this country, George, don't you?&#8221; asked Harry. 
  &#8220;I've ridden over all of it.  They say that Shields with a large  part of  McDowell's army is approaching the valley through Manassas  Gap.  It's a  long ride from here, Harry, but I think we'd better make  for it.  This  horse of mine is one of the best ever bred in the  valley.  He could carry  me a hundred miles by noon tomorrow.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mine's not exactly a plough horse,&#8221; said Harry, as he stroked the  mane  of his own splendid bay, one especially detailed for him on this  errand.  &#8220;If yours can go a hundred miles by noon to-morrow so can  mine.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suppose, then, we go a little faster.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suits me.&#8221; 
  The riders spoke a word or two.  The two grand horses stretched out  their  necks, and they sped away southward.  For a while they rode over  the road  by which they had come.  It was yet early twilight and they  saw many  marks of their passage, a broken-down wagon, a dead horse, an  exploded  caisson, and now and then something from which they quickly  turned away  their eyes. 
  Dalton knew the roads well, and at nightfall they bore in toward  the  right.  They had already come a long distance, and in the darkness  they  went more slowly. 
  &#8220;I think there's a farmhouse not much further on,&#8221; said Dalton,  &#8220;and  we'll ask there for information.  It's safe to do so because all  the  people through here are on our side.  There, you can see the house  now.&#8221; 
  The moonlight disclosed a farmhouse, surrounded by a lawn that was  well  sprinkled with big trees, but as they approached Harry and Dalton   simultaneously reined their horses back into the wood.  They had seen  a  dozen troopers on the lawn, and the light was good enough to show  that  their uniforms were or had been blue.  A woman was standing in  the open  door of the house, and one of the men, who seemed to be the  leader,  was talking to her. 
  &#8220;Yankee scouts,&#8221; whispered Harry. 
  &#8220;Undoubtedly.  The Yankee generals are waking up&#8212;Jackson has made  'em do  it, but I didn't expect to find their scouts so far in the  valley.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nor I.  Suppose we wait here, George, until they leave.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's the thing to do.&#8221; 
  They rode a little further into the woods where they were safe from   observation, and yet could watch what was passing at the house.  But  they  did not have to wait long.  The troopers evidently got little   satisfaction from the woman to whom they were talking and turned their   horses.  Harry saw her disappear inside, and he fairly heard the door   slam when it closed.  The men galloped southward down the road. 
  Harry heard a chuckle beside him and he turned in astonishment. 
  &#8220;I'm laughing,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;because I've got a right to laugh.   Here in  the valley we are all kin to one another just as you people  in Kentucky  are all related.  The woman who stood in the doorway is  Cousin Eliza  Pomeroy.  She's about my seventh cousin, but she's my  cousin just the  same, and if we could have heard it we would have  enjoyed what she was  saying to those Yankees.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oughtn't we to stop also and get news, if we can?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course.  We must have a talk with Cousin Eliza.&#8221; 
  They emerged from the woods, opened the gate and rode upon the  lawn.  Not a ray of light came from the house anywhere.  Every door and  shutter  was fast. 
  &#8220;Knock on the door with the hilt of your sword, Harry,&#8221; said  Dalton.  &#8220;It will bring Cousin Eliza.  She can't have gone to sleep  yet.&#8221; 
  Harry dismounted and holding the reins of his horse over his arm,  knocked  loudly.  There was no reply. 
  &#8220;Beat harder, Harry.  She's sure to hear.&#8221; 
  Harry beat upon that door until he bruised the hilt of his sword.   At last it was thrown open violently, and a powerful woman of middle   years appeared. 
  &#8220;I thought you Yankees had gone forever!&#8221; she exclaimed.  &#8220;You'd  better  hurry or Stonewall Jackson will get you before morning!&#8221; 
  &#8220;We're not Yankees, ma'am,&#8221; said Harry, politely.  &#8220;We're  Southerners,  Stonewall Jackson's own men, scouts from his army, here  looking for news  of the enemy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A fine tale, young man.  You're trying to fool me with your gray   uniform.  Stonewall Jackson's men are fifteen miles north of here,   chasing the Yankees by thousands into the Potomac.  They say he does  it  just as well by night as by day, and that he never sleeps or  rests.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What my comrade tells you is true.  Good evening, Cousin Eliza!&#8221;  said a  gentle voice beyond Harry. 
  The woman started and then stepped out of the door.  Dalton rode  forward  a little where the full moonlight fell upon him. 
  &#8220;You remember that summer six years ago when you spanked me for  stealing  the big yellow apples in the orchard.&#8221; 
  &#8220;George!  Little George Dalton!&#8221; she cried, and as Dalton got off  his  horse she enclosed him in a powerful embrace, although he was  little no  longer. 
  &#8220;And have you come from Stonewall Jackson?&#8221; she asked breathless  with  eagerness. 
  &#8220;Straight from him.  I'm on his staff and so is my friend here.   This is  Harry Kenton of Kentucky, Mrs. Pomeroy, and he's been through  all the  battles with us.  We were watching from the woods and we saw  those  Yankees at your door.  They didn't get any information, I know  that,  but I'm thinking that we will.&#8221; 
  Cousin Eliza Pomeroy laughed a low, deep laugh of pride and  satisfaction. 
  &#8220;Come into the house,&#8221; she exclaimed.  &#8220;I'm here with four  children.  Jim, my husband, is with Johnston's army before Richmond,  but we've been  able to take care of ourselves thus far, and I reckon  we'll keep on being  able.  I can get hot coffee and good corn cakes  ready for you inside of  fifteen minutes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's not food we want, Cousin Eliza,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;We want  something  far better, what those Yankees came for&#8212;news.  So I think  we'd better  stay outside and run no risk of surprise.  The Yankees  might come back.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so.  You'll grow up into a man with a heap of sense,  George.  I've got real news, and I was waiting for a chance to send it  through to  Stonewall Jackson.  Billy!  Billy!&#8221; 
  A small boy, not more than twelve, but clothed fully, darted from  the  inside of the house.  He was well set up for his age, and his face  was  keen and eager. 
  &#8220;This is Billy Pomeroy, my oldest son,&#8221; said Cousin Eliza Pomeroy,   with a swelling of maternal pride.  &#8220;I made him get in bed and cover   himself up, boots and all, when the Yankees came.  Billy has been  riding  to-day.  He ain't very old, and he ain't very big, but put him  on a horse  and he's mighty nigh a man.&#8221; 
  The small, eager face was shining. 
  &#8220;What did you see, Billy, when you rode so far?&#8221; asked Dalton. 
  &#8220;Yankees!  Yankees, Cousin George, and lots of 'em, toward Manassas  Gap!  I saw some of their cavalry this side of the Gap, and I heard at  the  store that there was a big army on the other side, marching hard  to come  through it, and get in behind our Stonewall.&#8221; 
  Harry looked at Dalton. 
  &#8220;That confirms the rumors we heard,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;You can believe anything that Billy tells you,&#8221; said Mrs. Pomeroy. 
  &#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;but we've got to go on and see these men  for  ourselves.  Stonewall Jackson is a terrible man, Cousin Eliza.  If  we  tell him that the Yankees are coming through Manassas Gap and  closing in  on his rear, he'll ask us how we know it, and when we reply  that a boy  told us he'll break us as unfit to be on his staff.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And I reckon Stonewall Jackson will be about right!&#8221; said Cousin  Eliza  Pomeroy, who was evidently a woman of strong mind.  &#8220;Billy, you  lead  these boys straight to Manassas Gap.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, no, Cousin Eliza!&#8221; exclaimed Dalton.  &#8220;Billy's been riding  hard all  day, and we can find the way.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What do you think Billy's made out of?&#8221; asked his mother  contemptuously.  &#8220;Ain't he a valley boy?  Ain't he Jim Pomeroy's son  and mine?  I want you  to understand that Billy can ride anything, and  he can ride it all day  long and all night long, too!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Make 'em let me go, ma!&#8221; exclaimed Billy, eagerly.  &#8220;I can save  time.  I can show 'em the shortest way!&#8221; 
  Harry and George glanced at each other.  Young Billy Pomeroy might  be of  great value to them.  Moreover, the choice was already made for  them,  because Billy was now running to the stable for his horse. 
  &#8220;He goes with us, or rather he leads us, Cousin Eliza,&#8221; said  Dalton. 
  Billy appeared the next instant, with his horse saddled and  bridled,  and his own proud young self in the saddle. 
  &#8220;Billy, take 'em straight,&#8221; said his Spartan mother, as she drew  him down  in the saddle and kissed him, and Billy, more swollen with  pride than  ever, promised that he would.  But the mother's voice broke  a little when  she said to Dalton: 
  &#8220;He's to guide you wherever you want to go, but you must bring him  back  to me unhurt.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We will, Cousin Eliza,&#8221; said Dalton earnestly. 
  Then they galloped away in the dark with Billy leading and riding  like a  Comanche.  He had taken a fresh horse from the stall and it was  almost as  powerful as those ridden by Harry and Dalton. 
  &#8220;See the mountains,&#8221; said Billy, pointing eastward to a long dark  line  dimly visible in the moonlight.  &#8220;That's the Blue Ridge, and  further  south is the Gap, but you can't see it at night until you come  right  close to it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you know any path through the woods, Billy?&#8221; asked Harry.  &#8220;We  don't  want to run the risk of capture.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I was just about to lead you into it,&#8221; replied the boy, still  rejoicing  in the importance of his role.  &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; 
  He turned off from the road into a path leading into thick forest,   wide enough for only one horse at a time.  Billy, of course, led,  Harry  followed, and Dalton brought up the rear.  The path, evidently a  short  cut used by farmers, was enclosed by great oaks, beeches and  elms,  now in full leaf, and it was dark there.  Only a slit of  moonlight showed  from above, and the figures of the three riders grew  shadowy. 
  &#8220;They'll never find us here, will they, Billy?&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;Not one chance in a thousand.  Them Yankees don't know a thing  about the  country.  Anyway, if they should come into the path at the  other end,  we'd hear them long before they heard us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're right, Billy, and as we ride on we'll all three listen with  six  good ears.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Billy. 
  Harry, although only a boy himself, was so much older than Billy,  who  addressed him as &#8220;sir,&#8221; that he felt himself quite a veteran. 
  &#8220;Billy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how did it happen that you were riding down this  way,  so far from home, to-day?&#8221; 
  &#8220;'Cause we heard there was Yanks in the Gap.  Ma won't let me go  an'  fight with Stonewall Jackson.  She says I ain't old enough an' big  enough,  but she told me herself to get on the horse an' ride down this  way,  an' see if what we heard was true.  I saw 'em in little bunches,  an' then  that gang come to our house to-night, less 'n ten minutes  after I come  back.  We'll be at a creek, sir, in less than five  minutes.  It runs down  from the mountains, an' it's pretty deep with  all them big spring rains.  I guess we'll have to swim, sir.  We could  go lower down, where there's  always a ford, but that's where the  Yankees would be crossing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We'll swim, if necessary, Billy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;When even the women and little children fight for us, the South  will be  hard to conquer,&#8221; was Harry's thought, but he said no more  until they  reached the creek, which was indeed swollen by the heavy  rains, and was  running swiftly, a full ten feet in depth. 
  &#8220;Hold on, Billy, I'll lead the way,&#8221; said Harry. 
  But Billy was already in the stream, his short legs drawn up, and  his  horse swimming strongly.  Harry and Dalton followed without a  word,  and the three emerged safely on the eastern side. 
  &#8220;You're a brave swimmer, Billy,&#8221; said Harry admiringly. 
  &#8220;'Tain't nothin, sir.  I didn't swim.  It was my horse.  I guess  he'd  take me across the Mississippi itself.  I wouldn't have anything  to do  but stick on his back.  Look up, sir, an' you can see the  mountains close  by.&#8221; 
  Harry and Dalton looked up through the rift in the trees, and saw  almost  over them the lofty outline of the Blue Ridge, the eastern  rampart of the  valley, heavy with forest from base to top. 
  &#8220;We must be near the Gap,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;We are,&#8221; said Billy.  &#8220;We've been coming fast.  It's nigh on to  fifteen  miles from here to home.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And must be a full thirty to Harper's Ferry,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;Does this path lead to some point overlooking the Gap,&#8221; asked  Harry,  &#8220;where we can see the enemy if he's there, and he can't see  us?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.  We can ride on a slope not more than two miles from  here and  look right down into the Gap.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And if troops are there we'll be sure to see their fires,&#8221; said  Dalton.  &#8220;Lead on, Billy.&#8221; 
  Billy led with boldness and certainty.  It was the greatest night  of his  life, and he meant to fulfill to the utmost what he deemed to  be his  duty.  The narrow path still wound among mighty trees, the  branches of  which met now and then over their heads, shutting out the  moonlight  entirely.  It led at this point toward the north and they  were rapidly  ascending a shoulder of the mountain, leaving the Gap on  their right. 
  Harry, riding on such an errand, felt to the full the weird quality  of  mountains and forest, over which darkness and silence brooded.  The   foliage was very heavy, and it rustled now and then as the stray winds   wandered along the slopes of the Blue Ridge.  But for that and the   hoofbeats of their own horses, there was no sound save once, when they   heard a scuttling on the bark of a tree.  They saw nothing, but Billy   pronounced it a wildcat, alarmed by their passage. 
  The three at length came out on a level place or tiny plateau.   Billy,  who rode in advance, stopped and the others stopped with him. 
  &#8220;Look,&#8221; said the boy, pointing to the bottom of the valley, about  five  hundred feet below. 
  A fire burned there and they could discern men around it, with  horses in  the background. 
  &#8220;Yankees,&#8221; said Billy.  &#8220;Look at 'em through the glasses.&#8221; 
  Harry raised his glasses and took a long look.  They had the full   moonlight where they stood and the fire in the valley below was also a   help.  He saw that the camp was made by a strong cavalry force.  Many  of  them were asleep in their blankets, but the others sat by the fire  and  seemed to be talking. 
  Then he passed the glasses to Dalton, who also, after looking long  and  well, passed them to Billy, as a right belonging to one who had  been  their real leader, and who shared equally with them their  hardships and  dangers. 
  &#8220;How large would you say that force is, George?&#8221; asked Harry. 
  &#8220;Three or four hundred men at least.  There's a great bunch of  horses.  I should judge, too, from the careless way they've camped,  that they've  no fear of being attacked.  How many do you think they  are, Billy?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Just about what you said, Cousin George.  Are you going to attack  them?&#8221; 
  Harry and Dalton laughed. 
  &#8220;No, Billy,&#8221; replied Dalton.  &#8220;You see we're only three, and there  must  be at least three hundred down there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But we've been hearin' that Stonewall Jackson's men never mind a  hundred  to one,&#8221; said Billy, in an aggrieved tone.  &#8220;We hear that's  just about  what they like.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, Billy, my boy.  We don't fight a hundred to one.  Nobody does,   unless it's like Thermopylae and the Alamo.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then what are we going to do?&#8221; continued Billy in his disappointed  tone. 
  &#8220;I think, Billy, that Harry and I are going to dismount, slip down  the  mountainside, see what we can see, hear what we can hear, and that  you'll  stay here, holding and guarding the horses until we come back.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I won't!&#8221; exclaimed Billy in violent indignation.  &#8220;I won't,  Cousin  George.  I'm going down the mountain with you an' Mr. Kenton.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Now, Billy,&#8221; said Dalton soothingly, &#8220;you've got a most important  job  here.  You're the reserve, and you also hold the means of flight.   Suppose we're pursued hotly, we couldn't get away without the horses  that  you'll hold for us.  Suppose we should be taken.  Then it's for  you to  gallop back with the news that Shields' whole army will be in  the pass in  the morning, and under such circumstances, your mother  would send you on  to General Jackson with a message of such immense  importance.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; said Billy with conviction, in the face of so much  eloquence  and logic, &#8220;but I don't want you fellows to be captured.&#8221; 
  Dalton and Harry dismounting, gave the reins of their horses into  the  hands of Billy, and the small fingers clutched them tightly. 
  &#8220;Stay exactly where you are, Billy,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;We want to find  you  without trouble when we come back.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll be here,&#8221; said Billy proudly. 
  Harry and Dalton began the descent through the bushes and trees.   They  had not the slightest doubt that this was the vanguard of the  Northern  army which they heard was ten thousand strong, and that this  force was  merely a vanguard for McDowell, who had nearly forty  thousand men.  But they knew too well to go back to Stonewall Jackson  with mere surmise,  however plausible. 
  &#8220;We've got to find out some way or other whether their army is  certainly  at hand,&#8221; whispered Dalton. 
  Harry nodded, and said: 
  &#8220;We must manage to overhear some of their talk, though it's risky   business.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But that's what we're here for.  They don't seem to be very  watchful,  and as the woods and bushes are thick about 'em we may get a  chance.&#8221; 
  They continued their slow and careful descent.  Harry glanced back  once  through an opening in the bushes and saw little Billy, holding  the reins  of the three horses and gazing intently after them.  He knew  that among  all the soldiers of Jackson's army, no matter how full of  valor and zeal  they might be, there was not one who surpassed Billy in  eagerness to  serve. 
  They reached the bottom of the slope, and lay for a few minutes  hidden  among dense bushes.  Both had been familiar with country life,  they had  hunted the 'possum and the coon many a dark night, and now  their forest  lore stood them in good stead.  They made no sound as  they passed among  the bushes and trailing vines, and they knew that  they were quite secure  in their covert, although they lay within a  hundred yards of one of the  fires. 
  Harry judged that most of the men whom they saw were city bred.  It  was  an advantage that the South had over the North in a mighty war,  waged in  a country covered then mostly with forest and cut by  innumerable rivers  and creeks, that her sons were familiar with such  conditions, while many  of those of the North, used to life in the  cities, were at a loss,  when the great campaigns took them into the  wilderness. 
  Both he and Dalton, relying upon this knowledge, crept a little  closer,  but they stopped and lay very close, when they saw a man  advancing to a  hillock, carrying under his arm a bundle which they  took to be rockets. 
  &#8220;Signals,&#8221; whispered Dalton.  &#8220;You just watch, Harry, and you'll  see 'em  answered from the eastward.&#8221; 
  The officer on the summit of the hillock sent up three rockets,  which  curved beautifully against the blue heavens, then sank and died.   Far to  the eastward they saw three similar lights flame and die. 
  &#8220;How far away would you say those answering rockets were?&#8221;  whispered  Harry. 
  &#8220;It's hard to say about distances in the moonlight, but they may be  three  or four miles.  I take it, Harry, that they are sent up by the  Northern  main force.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So do I, but we've got to get actual evidence in words, or we've  got to  see this army.  I'm afraid to go back to General Jackson with  anything  less.  Now, we won't have time to go through the Gap, see the  army and  get back to the general before things begin to happen, so  we've got to  stick it out here, until we get what we want.&#8221; 
  &#8220;True words, Harry, and we must risk going a little nearer.  See  that  line of bushes running along there in the dark?  It will cover  us,  and we're bound to take the chance.  We must agree, too, Harry,  that if  we're discovered, neither must stop in an attempt to save the  other.  If one reaches Jackson it will be all right.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course, George.  We'll run for it with all our might, and if  it's  only one it's to be the better runner.&#8221; 
  They lay almost flat on their stomachs, and passing through the  grass,  reached the line of bushes.  Here they could rise from such an   uncomfortable position, and stooping they came within fifty yards of  the  first fire, where they saw very clearly the men who were not  asleep,  and who yet moved about.  Most of them were not yet sunburned,  and Harry  judged at once that they had come from the mills and  workshops of New  York or New England.  As far as he could see they had  no pickets, and he  inferred their belief that no enemy was nearer than  Jackson's army,  at least thirty miles away.  Perhaps the little band  of horsemen who had  knocked at Mrs. Pomeroy's door had brought them  the information. 
  They lay there nearly an hour, not thinking of the danger, but  consumed  with impatience.  Officers passed near them talking, but they  could catch  only scraps, not enough for their purpose.  A set of  signals was sent up  again and was answered duly from the same point to  the east of the Gap.  But after long waiting, they were rewarded.  Few  of the officers or men  ever went far from the fires.  They seemed to  be at a loss in the dark  and silent wilderness which was absolute  confirmation to Harry that they  were city dwellers. 
  Two officers, captains or majors, stopped within twenty feet of the   crouching scouts, and gazed for a long time through the Gap toward the   west into the valley, at the northern end of which Jackson and his  army  lay. 
  &#8220;I tell you, Curtis,&#8221; one of them said at last, &#8220;that if we get  through  the Gap to-morrow and Fremont and the others also come up,  Jackson can't  possibly get away.  We'll have him and his whole force  in a trap and with  three or four to one in our favor, it will be all  over.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's true, if it comes out as you say, Penfield,&#8221; said the other,   &#8220;but there are several 'ifs,' and as we have reason to know, it's hard  to  put your hand on Jackson.  Why, when we thought he was lost in the   mountains he came out of them like an avalanche, and some of our best   troops were buried under that avalanche.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're too much of a pessimist, Curtis.  We've learned a lot in  the last  few days.  As sure as you and I stand here the fox will be  trapped.  Why, he's trapped already.  We'll be through the Gap here  with ten  thousand men in the morning, squarely in Jackson's rear.   To-morrow we'll  have fifty or sixty thousand good troops between him  and Richmond and  Johnston.  His army will be taken or destroyed, and  the Confederacy will  be split asunder.  McClellan will be in Richmond  with an overwhelming  force, and within a month the war will be  practically over.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There's no doubt of that, if we catch Jackson, and it certainly  looks as  if the trap were closing down upon him.  In defeating Banks  and then  following him to the Potomac he has ruined himself and his  cause.&#8221; 
  Harry felt a deadly fear gripping at his heart.  What these men  were  saying was probably true.  Every fact supported their claim.  The  tough  and enduring North, ready to sustain any number of defeats and  yet win,  was pouring forward her troops with a devotion that would  have wrung  tears from a stone.  And she was destined to do it again  and again  through dark and weary years. 
  The two men walked further away, still talking, but Harry and  Dalton  could no longer hear what they were saying.  The rockets soared  again in  the pass, and were answered in the east, but now nearer, and  the two knew  that it was not worth while to linger any longer.  They  knew the vital  fact that ten thousand men were advancing through the  pass, and that all  the rest was superfluity.  And time had a value  beyond price to their  cause.
