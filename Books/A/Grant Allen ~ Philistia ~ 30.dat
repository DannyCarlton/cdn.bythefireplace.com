Winter had come, and on a bitter cold winter's night, Ernest  Le Breton once more received an unexpected telegram asking him to  hurry down without a moment's delay on important business to the  'Morning Intelligence' office. The telegram didn't state at all  what the business was; it merely said it was urgent and immediate  without in any way specifying its nature. Ernest sallied forth  in some perturbation, for his memories of the last occasion when  the 'Morning Intelligence' required his aid on important business  were far from pleasant ones; but for Edie's sake he felt he must  go, and so he went without a murmur.    
'Sit down, Le Breton,' Mr. Lancaster said slowly when Ernest  entered. 'The matter I want to see you about's a very peculiar one.  I understand from some of my friends that you're a son of Sir Owen  Le Breton, the Indian general.'    
'Yes, I am,' Ernest answered, wondering within himself to what  end this curious preamble could possibly be leading up. If there's  any one profession, he thought, which is absolutely free from the  slightest genealogical interest in the persons of its professors,  surely that particular calling ought to be the profession of  journalism.    
'Well, so I hear, Le Breton. Now, I believe I'm right in saying,  am I not, that it was your father who first subdued and organised  a certain refractory hill-tribe on the Tibetan frontier, known as  the Bodahls, wasn't it?'    
'Quite right,' Ernest replied, with a glimmering idea slowly rising  in his mind as to what Mr. Lancaster was now driving at.    
'Ah, that's good, very good indeed, certainly. Well, tell me,  Le Breton, do you yourself happen to know anything on earth about  these precious insignificant people?'    
'I know all about them,' Ernest answered quickly. 'I've read all  my father's papers and despatches, and seen his maps and plans and  reports in our house at home from my boyhood upward. I know as much  about the Bodahls, in fact, as I know about Bayswater, or Holborn,  or Fleet Street.'    
'Capital, capital,' the editor said, fondling his big hands softly;  'that'll exactly suit us. And could you get at these plans and papers  now, this very evening, just to refresh the gaps in your memory?'    
'I could have them all down here,' Ernest answered, 'at an hour's  notice.'    
'Good,' the editor said again. 'I'll send a boy for them with a  cab. Meanwhile, you'd better be perpending this telegram from our  Simla correspondent, just received. It's going to be the question  of the moment, and we should very much like you to give us a leader  of a full column about the matter.'    
Ernest took the telegram and read it over carefully. It ran in the  usual very abbreviated newspaper fashion: 'Russian agents revolted  Bodahls Tibetan frontier. Advices Peshawur state Russian army  marching on Merv. Bodahls attacked Commissioner, declared independence  British raj.'    
'Will you write us a leader?' the editor asked, simply.    
Ernest drew a long breath. Three guineas! Edie, Dot, an empty  exchequer! If he could only have five minutes to make his mind up!  But he couldn't. After all, what did it matter what he said about  these poor unknown Bodahls? If <i>he</i> didn't write the leader, somebody  else who knew far less about the subject than he did would be sure  to do it. He wasn't responsible for that impalpable entity 'the  policy of the paper.' Beside the great social power of the 'Morning  Intelligence,' of the united English people, what was he, Ernest  Le Breton, but a miserable solitary misplaced unit? One way or the  other, he could do very little indeed, for good or for evil. After  half a minute's internal struggle, he answered back the editor  faintly, 'Yes, I will.' 'For Edie,' he muttered half audibly to  himself; 'I must do it for dear Edie.'    
'And you'll allow me to make whatever alterations I think necessary  in the article to suit the policy of the paper?' the editor asked  once more, looking through him with his sleepy keen grey eyes.  'You see, Le Breton, I don't want to annoy you, and I know your  own principles are rather peculiar; but of course all we want you  for is just to give us the correct statement of facts about these  outlandish people. All that concerns our own attitude towards them  as a nation falls naturally under the head of editorial matter.  You must see yourself that it's quite impossible for us to let any  one single contributor dictate from his own standpoint the policy  of the paper.'    
Ernest bent his head slowly. 'You're very kind to argue out the  matter with me so, Mr. Lancaster,' he said, trembling with excitement.  'Yes, I suppose I must bury my scruples. I'll write a leader about  these Bodahls, and let you deal with it afterwards as you think  proper.'    
They showed him into the bare little back room, and sent a boy  up with a hastily written note to Ronald for the maps and papers.  There Ernest sat for an hour or two, writing away for very life,  and putting on paper everything that he knew about the poor Bodahls.  By two o'clock, the proofs had all come up to him, and he took  his hat in a shamefaced manner to sally out into the cold street,  where he hoped to hide his rising remorse and agony under cover of  the solitary night. He knew too well what 'the policy of the paper'  would be, to venture upon asking any questions about it. As he  left the office, a boy brought him down a sealed envelope from Mr.  Lancaster. With his usual kindly thoughtfulness the editor had sent  him at once the customary cheque for three guineas. Ernest folded  it up with quivering fingers, and felt the blood burn in his cheeks  as he put it away in his waistcoat pocket. That accursed money!  For it he had that night sold his dearest principles! And yet, not  for it, not for it, not for it--oh, no, not for it, but for Dot  and Edie!    
The boy had a duplicate proof in his other hand, and Ernest saw at  once that it was his own leader, as altered and corrected by Mr.  Lancaster. He asked the boy whether he might see it; and the boy,  knowing it was Ernest's own writing, handed it to him at once  without further question. Ernest did not dare to look at it then  and there for fear he should break down utterly before the boy; he  put it for the moment into his inner pocket, and buttoned his thin  overcoat tightly around him. It was colder still in the frosty air  of early morning, and the contrast to the heated atmosphere of the  printing house struck him with ominous chill as he issued slowly  forth into the silent precincts of unpeopled Fleet Street.    
It was a terrible memorable night, that awful Tuesday; the coldest  night known for many years in any English winter. Snow lay deep upon  the ground, and a few flakes were falling still from the cloudy  sky, for it was in the second week of January. The wind was drifting  it in gusty eddies down the long streets, and driving the drifts  before it like whirling dust in an August storm. Not a cab was to  be seen anywhere, not even a stray hansom crawling home from clubs  or theatres; and Ernest set out with a rueful countenance to walk  as best he might alone through the snow all the way to Holloway.  It is a long and dreary trudge at any time; it seemed very long  and dreary indeed to Ernest Le Breton, with his delicate frame and  weak chest, battling against the fierce wind on a dark and snowy  winter's night, and with the fever of a great anxiety and a great  remorse silently torturing his distracted bosom. At each step he  took through the snow, he almost fancied himself a hunted Bodahl.  Would British soldiers drive those poor savage women and children  to die so of cold and hunger on their snowy hilltops? Would English  fathers and mothers, at home at their ease, applaud the act with  careless thoughtlessness as a piece of our famous spirited foreign  policy? And would his own article, written with his own poor thin  cold fingers in that day's 'Morning Intelligence,' help to spur  them on upon that wicked and unnecessary war? What right had we to  conquer the Bodahls? What right had we to hold them in subjection  or to punish them for revolting? And above all, what right had  he, Ernest Le Breton, upon whose head the hereditary guilt of the  first conquest ought properly to have weighed with such personal  heaviness--what right had he, of all men, directly or indirectly,  to aid or abet the English people in their immoral and inhuman  resolve? Oh, God, his sin was worse than theirs; for they sinned,  thinking they did justly; but as for him, he sinned against the  light; he knew the better, and, bribed by gold, he did the worse.  At that moment, the little slip of printed paper in his waistcoat  pocket seemed to burn through all the frosts of that awful evening  like a chain of molten steel into his very marrow!    
Trudging on slowly through the white stainless snow, step by  step,--snow that cast a sheet of pure white even over the narrow  lanes behind the Farringdon Road,--cold at foot and hot at heart,  he reached at last the wide corner by the Angel at Islington. The  lights in the windows were all out long ago, of course, but the  lamps outside were still flaring brightly, and a solitary policeman  was standing under one of them, trying to warm his frozen hands by  breathing rapidly on the curved and distorted fingers. Ernest was  very tired of his tramp by that time, and emboldened by companionship  he stopped awhile to rest himself in the snow and wind under the  opposite lamplight. Putting his back against the post, he drew the  altered proof of his article slowly out of his inner pocket. It  had a strange fascination for him, and yet he dreaded to look at  it. With an effort, he unfolded it in his stiff fingers, and held  the paper up to the light, regardless of the fact that the policeman  was watching his proceedings with the interest naturally due from  a man of his profession to a suspicious-looking character who  was probably a convicted pickpocket. The first sentence once more  told him the worst. There was no doubt at all about it. The three  guineas in his pocket were the price of blood!    
'The insult to British prestige in the East,' ran that terrible  opening paragraph, 'implied in the brief telegram which we publish  this morning from our own Correspondent at Simla, calls for a speedy  and a severe retribution. It must be washed out in blood.' Blood,  blood, blood! The letters swam before his eyes. It was this, then,  that he, the disciple of peace-loving Max Schurz, the hater of war  and conquest, the foe of unjust British domination over inferior  races--it was this that he had helped to make plausible with his  special knowledge and his ready pen! Oh, heaven, what reparation  could he make for this horrid crime he had knowingly and wilfully  committed? What could he do to avoid the guilt of those poor  savages' blood upon his devoted head? In one moment he thought out  a hundred scenes of massacre and pillage--scenes such as he knew  only too well always precede and accompany the blessings of British  rule in distant dependencies. The temptation had been strong--the  money had been sorely wanted--there was very little food in  the house; but how could he ever have yielded to such a depth of  premeditated wickedness! He folded the piece of paper into his  pocket once more, and buried his face in his hands for a whole  minute. The policeman now began to suspect that he was not so much  a pickpocket as an escaped lunatic.    
And so he was, no doubt. Of course we who are practical men of  the world know very well that all this foolish feeling on Ernest  Le Breton's part was very womanish and weak and overwrought; that  he ought to have done the work that was set before him, asking no  questions for conscience' sake; and that he might honestly have  pocketed the three guineas, letting his supposed duty to a few  naked brown people somewhere up in the Indian hill-country take  care of itself, as all the rest of us always do. But some allowance  must naturally be made for his peculiar temperament and for his  particular state of health. Consumptive people are apt to take a  somewhat hectic view of life in every way; they lack the common-sense  ballast that makes most of us able to value the lives of a few  hundred poor distant savages at their proper infinitesimal figure.  At any rate, Ernest Le Breton, as a matter of fact, rightly or  wrongly, did take this curious standpoint about things in general;  and did then and there turn back through the deep snow, all his  soul burning within him, fired with dire remorse, and filled only  with one idea--how to prevent this wicked article to which he had  contributed so many facts and opinions from getting printed in  to-morrow's paper. True, it was not he who had put in the usual  newspaper platitudes about the might of England, and the insult to  the British flag, and the immediate necessity for a stern retaliation;  but all that vapouring wicked talk (as he thought it) would go  forth to the world fortified by the value of his special facts and  his obviously intimate acquaintance with the whole past history of  the Bodahl people. So he turned back and battled once more with the  wind and snow as far as Fleet Street; and then he rushed excitedly  into the 'Morning Intelligence' office, and asked with the wildness  of despair to see the editor.    
Mr. Lancaster had gone home an hour since, the porter said; but  Mr. Wilks, the sub-editor, was still there, superintending the  printing of the paper, and if Ernest liked, Mr. Wilks would see  him immediately.    
Ernest nodded assent at once, and was forthwith ushered up into Mr.  Wilks's private sanctum. The sub-editor was a dry, grizzly-bearded  man, with a prevailing wolfish greyness of demeanour about his whole  person; and he shook Ernest's proffered hand solemnly, in the dreary  fashion that is always begotten of the systematic transposition of  night and day.    
'For heaven's sake, Mr. Wilks,' Ernest cried imploringly, 'I want  to know whether you can possibly suppress or at least alter my  leader on the Bodahl insurrection!'    
Mr. Wilks looked at him curiously, as one might look at a person  who had suddenly developed violent symptoms of dangerous insanity.  'Suppress the Bodahl leader,' he said slowly like one dreaming.  'Suppress the Bodahl leader! Impossible! Why, it's the largest type  heading in the whole of to-day's paper, is this Bodahl business.  "Shocking Outrage upon a British Commissioner on the Indian  Frontier. Revolt of the Entire Bodahl Tribe. Russian Intrigue  in Central Asia. Dangerous Position of the Viceroy at Simla." Oh,  dear me, no; not to have a leader upon <i>that</i>, my dear sir, would be  simply suicidal!'    
'But can't you cut out my part of it, at least,' Ernest said  anxiously. 'Oh, Mr. Wilks, you don't know what I've suffered to-night  on account of this dreadful unmerited leader. It's wicked, it's  unjust, it's abominable, and I can't bear to think that I have had  anything to do with sending it out into the world to inflame the  passions of unthinking people! Do please try to let my part of it  be left out, and only Mr. Lancaster's, at least, be printed.'    
Mr. Wilks looked at him again with the intensest suspicion.    
'A sub-editor,' he answered evasively, 'has nothing at all to do with  the politics of a paper. The editor alone manages that department  on his own responsibility. But what on earth would you have me do?  I can't stop the machines for half an hour, can I, just to let you  have the chance of doctoring your leader? If you thought it wrong  to write it, you ought never to have written it; now it's written  it must certainly stand.'    
Ernest sank into a chair, and said nothing; but he turned so deadly  pale that Mr. Wilks was fain to have recourse to a little brown  flask he kept stowed away in a corner of his desk, and to administer  a prompt dose of brandy and water.    
'There, there,' he said, in the kindest manner of which he was  capable, 'what are you going to do now? You can't be going out  again in this state and in this weather, can you?'    
'Yes, I am,' Ernest answered feebly. 'I'm going to walk home at  once to Holloway.'    
'To Holloway!' the sub-editor said in a tone of comparative  horror. 'Oh! no, I can't allow that. Wait here an hour or two till  the workmen's trains begin running. Or, stay; Lancaster left his  brougham here for me to-night, as I have to be off early to-morrow  on business; I'll send you home in that, and let Hawkins get me a  cab from the mews by order.'    
Ernest made no resistance; and so the sub-editor sent him home at  once in Lancaster's brougham.    
When he got home in the early grey of morning, he found Edie still  sitting up for him in her chair, and wondering what could be  detaining him so long at the newspaper office. He threw himself  wildly at her feet, and, in such broken sentences as he was able  to command, he told her all the pitiful story. Edie soothed him  and kissed him as he went along, but never said a word for good or  evil till he had finished.    
'It was a terrible temptation, darling,' she said softly: 'a terrible  temptation, indeed, and I don't wonder you gave way to it; but we  mustn't touch the three guineas. As you say rightly, it's blood-money.'    
Ernest drew the cheque slowly from his pocket, and held it hesitatingly  a moment in his hand. Edie looked at him curiously.    
'What are you going to do with it, darling?' she asked in a low  voice, as he gazed vacantly at the last dying embers in the little  smouldering fireplace.    
'Nothing, Edie dearest,' Ernest answered huskily, folding it  up and putting it away in the drawer by the window. They neither  of them dared to look the other in the face, but they bad not the  heart to burn it boldly. It was blood-money, to be sure; but three  guineas are really so very useful!    
Four days later, little Dot was taken with a sudden illness. Ernest  and Edie sat watching by her little cradle throughout the night,  and saw with heavy hearts that she was rapidly growing feebler. Poor  wee soul, they had nothing to keep her for: it would be better,  perhaps, if she were gone; and yet, the human heart cannot be stifled  by such calm deliverances of practical reason; it <i>will</i> let its hot  emotions overcome the cold calculations of better and worse supplied  it by the unbiassed intellect.    
All night long they sat there tearfully, fearing she would not  live till morning; and in the early dawn they sent round hastily  for a neighbouring doctor. They had no money to pay him with, to  be sure; but that didn't much matter; they could leave it over for  the present, and perhaps some day before long Ernest might write  another social, and earn an honest three guineas. Anyhow, it was  a question of life and death, and they could not help sending for  the doctor, whatever difficulty they might afterwards find in paying  him.    
The doctor came, and looked with the usual professional seriousness  at the baby patient. Did they feed her entirely on London milk? he  asked doubtfully. Yes, entirely. Ah! then that was the sole root  of the entire mischief. She was very dangerously ill, no doubt,  and he didn't know whether he could pull her through anyhow; but  if anything would do it, it was a change to goat's milk. There was  a man who sold goat's milk round the corner. He would show Ernest  where to find him.    
Ernest looked doubtfully at Edie, and Edie looked back again  at Ernest. One thought rose at once in both their minds. They had  no money to pay for it with, except--except that dreadful cheque.  For four days it had lain, burning a hole in Ernest's heart from  its drawer by the window, and he had not dared to change it. Now  he rose without saying a word, and opened the drawer in a solemn,  hesitating fashion. He looked once more at Edie inquiringly; Edie  nodded a faint approval. Ernest, pale as death, put on his hat,  and went out totteringly with the doctor. He stopped on the way  to change the cheque at the baker's where they usually dealt, and  then went on to the goat's milk shop. How that sovereign he flung  upon the counter seemed to ring the knell of his seif-respect! The  man who changed it noticed the strangeness of Ernest's look, and  knew at once he had not come by the money honestly. He rang it twice  to make sure it was good, and then gave the change to Ernest. But  Dot, at least, was saved; that was a great thing. The milk arrived  duly every morning for some weeks, and, after a severe struggle,  Dot grew gradually better. While the danger lasted, neither of  them dared think much of the cheque; but when Dot had got quite  well again, Ernest was concious of a certain unwonted awkwardness  of manner in talking to Edie. He knew perfectly well what it meant;  they were both accomplices in crime together.    
When Ernest wrote his 'social' after Max Schurz's affair, he felt  he had already touched the lowest depths of degradation. He knew  now that he had touched a still lower one. Oh! horrible abyss of  self-abasement!--he had taken the blood-money. And yet, it was to  save Dot's life! Herbert was right, after all: quite right. Yes,  yes, all hope was gone: the environment had finally triumphed.    
In the awful self-reproach of that deadly remorse for the acceptance  of the blood-money, Ernest Le Breton felt at last in his heart  that surely the bitterness of death was past. It would be better  for them all to die together than to live on through such a life of  shame and misery. Ah, Peter, Peter, you are not the only one that  has denied his Lord and Master!    
And yet, Ernest Le Breton had only written part of a newspaper  leader about a small revolt of the Bodahls. And he suffered more  agony for it than many a sensitive man, even, has suffered for the  commission of some obvious crime.    
'I say, Berkeley,' Lancaster droned out in the lobby of their club  one afternoon shortly afterwards, 'what on earth am I ever to do  about that socialistic friend of yours, Le Breton? I can't ever  give him any political work again, you know. Just fancy! first, you  remember, I set him upon the Schurz imprisonment business, and he  nearly went mad then because I didn't back up Schurz for wanting to  murder the Emperor of Russia. After that, just now the other day,  I tried him on the Bodahl business, and hang me if he didn't have  qualms of conscience about it afterwards, and trudge back through  all the snow that awful Tuesday, to see if he couldn't induce Wilks  to stop the press, and let him cut it all out at the last moment!  He's as mad as a March hare, you know, and if it weren't that I'm  really sorry for him I wouldn't go on taking socials from him any  longer. But I will; I'll give him work as long as he'll do it for  me on any terms; though, of course, it's obviously impossible under  the circumstances to let him have another go at politics, isn't  it?'    
'You're really awfully kind, Lancaster,' Berkeley answered warmly.  'No other fellow would do as much for Le Breton as you do. I admit  he's absolutely impracticable, but I would give more than I can  tell you if only I thought he could be made to pull through somehow.'    
'Impracticable!' the editor said shortly, 'I believe you, indeed.  Why, do you remember that ridiculous Schurz business? Well, I sent  Le Breton a cheque for eight guineas for that lot, and can you  credit it, it's remained uncashed from that day to this. I really  think he must have destroyed it.'    
'No doubt,' Arthur answered, with a smile. 'And the Bodahls? What  about them?'    
'Oh! he kept that cheque for a few days uncashed--though I'm sure  he wanted money at the time; but in the end, I'm happy to say, he  cashed it.'    
Arthur's countenance fell ominously.    
'He did!' he said gloomily. 'He cashed it! That's bad news indeed,  then. I must go and see them to-morrow morning early. I'm afraid  they must be at the last pitch of poverty before they'd consent to  do that. And yet, Solomon says, men do not despise a thief if he  steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry. And Le Breton, after  all, has a wife and child to think of.'    
Lancaster stared at him blankly, and turned aside to glance at  the telegrams, saying to himself meanwhile, that all these young  fellows of the new school alike were really quite too incomprehensible  for a sensible, practical man like himself to deal with comfortably.
