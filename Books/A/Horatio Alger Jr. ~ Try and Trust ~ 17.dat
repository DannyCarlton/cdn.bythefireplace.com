  Leaving Abner Holden bound in his cabin, Ralph led Herbert, by a  short  path, out of the woods. 
  &quot;Your best course,&quot; he said, &quot;will be to take the cars for Columbus  at  Vernon. At Columbus you will go to Wheeling, and from there, over  the  Baltimore Ohio Railroad to Baltimore, and thence to New York. But  all  this will cost money.&quot; 
  &quot;I have money,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;How much?&quot; 
  &quot;About fifteen dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;Is that all?&quot; 
  &quot;Is it not enough to carry me to New York?&quot; 
  &quot;Hardly. Besides, when you get there, how will you get along? Have  you  any relations in the city?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, an uncle.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you will go to him?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Herbert, hastily. 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; 
  &quot;He does not care to see me. Shall I tell you what sort of a letter  he  wrote to Dr. Kent about me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, tell me.&quot; 
  Herbert, in indignant language, which correctly represented his   feelings, gave the substance of the letter, which is already known to   us. 
  &quot;I shall not feel easy,&quot; he said, &quot;until I am able to return the  ten  dollars which my uncle sent me. I am not willing to remain under   obligations to one who cares so little for me.&quot; 
  &quot;I think you are proud,&quot; said Ralph, bending his eyes upon the  lad's  glowing countenance. 
  &quot;Perhaps I am,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;but is it not a proper pride?&quot; 
  &quot;I cannot say no,&quot; answered Ralph; &quot;but would you feel the same  about  incurring obligations to a friend?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;that would be different.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad to hear you say so, for I am going to ask you to accept  help  from me.&quot; 
  To Herbert's surprise, Ralph drew out a small bag, originally  intended  for shot, and drew therefrom five golden coins, of five  dollars each. 
  &quot;Take them,&quot; he said, simply. 
  Herbert hesitated, while his face indicated extreme surprise. 
  &quot;I thought&#8212;&quot; he commenced, and then paused. 
  &quot;You thought me poor,&quot; said Ralph, finishing the sentence for him.  &quot;Is  it not so?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Most people think so,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;But it was not poverty that  drove  me from the busy world to this solitude. Rich or poor, I had  money  enough for my wants. Here I have little use for money. To me it  is a  useless and valueless thing. You need have no hesitation in  taking this.  But on second thoughts, I had better give you more.&quot; And  he was about to  draw forth more. 
  &quot;No, no,&quot; said Herbert, hastily. &quot;It is quite sufficient. You are  very,  very kind. Some time I hope to repay you.&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;Do not talk of repayment. Let me have the  pleasure of  giving you this small sum.&quot; 
  &quot;How kind you are,&quot; said Herbert, impulsively, &quot;and to a stranger.&quot; 
  &quot;Yet my obligation to you is greater than yours to me,&quot; said Ralph. 
  &quot;How can that be?&quot; asked the boy, raising his eyes to Ralph's grave   face. 
  &quot;You are the first human being in whose society I have taken  pleasure  for years. Deeply injured by man, I conceived a hatred for  the whole  race. But in your frank face I see much to like. I think I  could trust  you.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope so,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;You have inspired in me a new feeling, for which I cannot account.   Yesterday the world had no attractions for me. To-day I feel an  interest  in your welfare, at least.&quot; 
  &quot;Why do you bury yourself in this lonely place?&quot; said Herbert. &quot;You   cannot be happy in it. Come with me to New York. It must be a  beautiful  place.&quot; 
  Ralph smiled gravely. 
  &quot;To the young the world seems bright,&quot; he said. &quot;It is after years  have  swept away one illusion after another, after faith in one's  fellowmen  has been sorely tried, and the hollowness of the world's  friendship has  been proved, that the brightness fades.&quot; 
  &quot;You have seen more of life than I,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;and perhaps it  is  presumption in me to question what you say; but I cannot help  feeling  that you are mistaken. I am sure that there is such a thing as  true  friendship.&quot; 
  &quot;How many true friends are you blessed with?&quot; asked Ralph, a little   sarcasm in his tone. 
  &quot;Not many, perhaps, but some. There is good Dr. Kent and his  family. I  am sure of their friendship. Then,&quot; he added, his color  slightly rising,  &quot;I think I have found another friend,&quot; and he looked  in the face of his  guide. 
  The grave face softened. 
  &quot;Thank you, my lad,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;You are right there, at least.  You can  rely upon my friendship being sincere.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I am right, am I not?&quot; said Herbert, smiling brightly. 
  &quot;I believe you are,&quot; said the guide, after a pause, &quot;and I thank  you for  teaching me a lesson.&quot; 
  &quot;Man was made in the image of God,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;If we doubt man,  I  think it is the same as doubting God.&quot; 
  Ralph did not reply, but walked on in thoughtful silence. 
  &quot;How far is it to Vernon?&quot; asked Herbert, when they had emerged  from the  woods. 
  &quot;It is five miles farther. Can you walk so far?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes; I have good stout legs. But suppose Mr. Holden should  escape.  He might pursue us.&quot; 
  Ralph smiled. 
  &quot;I think I shall find him in the same place when I return,&quot; he  said. 
  &quot;He will be very angry with you.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I suppose so,&quot; said Ralph, indifferently. 
  &quot;Are you not afraid he will have you arrested?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I care little. If I am fined, I will pay the fine, and that  will be  the end of it.&quot; 
  &quot;But you might be imprisoned?&quot; 
  &quot;If I see any danger of that, I shall be tempted to charge Abner  Holden  with his attempt upon your life. Don't make yourself anxious  about me,  my lad. I have little fear of what the law may do as far as  my agency in  this affair is concerned.&quot; 
  Ralph seemed so entirely unconcerned that something of his  confidence  was imparted to Herbert. Noting the erect mien and fearless  glance of  his guide, every movement betokening strength, he could not  help feeling  that Abner Holden would be rash to make such a man his  enemy. He felt  safe in his protection, and his apprehensions of  capture passed away. So  with lightened heart he walked the five dusty  miles to the village of  Vernon, accompanied by Ralph. 
  It was a thrifty village, with neat and tasteful dwellings lining  the  principal street. The railroad and manufactories had built it up  rapidly  and given it an air of prosperity which was pleasant to see. 
  &quot;We will go at once to the railway station,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;You may  catch  the next train, and it will be as well to leave this  neighborhood as  soon as possible.&quot; 
  They were fortunate enough to reach the station fifteen minutes  before  the eastern train departed. 
  Herbert bought a ticket for Columbus, fifty miles distant, and  entered  the train. 
  &quot;Good-by, Herbert,&quot; said Ralph, from the platform. 
  &quot;Good-by,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;Thank you for all your kindness to me.  Shall I  not see you again?&quot; 
  &quot;I do not know,&quot; said Ralph, musing. &quot;I have no wish nor intention  of  going to New York at present, yet I have a feeling that we shall  meet  again.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope it may be so,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I shall be glad to see you  again.&quot; 
  While he spoke the shrill sound of the railway whistle was heard,  the  train started, and Herbert was fairly off on his journey. 
  Just as he was leaving the depot, a wagon drove hastily up to the   station, and Abner Holden jumped out. Herbert saw him as he looked  from  the window, and for a moment he was apprehensive, but the train  was  fairly on the way. 
  &quot;Stop! stop!&quot; vociferated Abner. &quot;Stop, I say!&quot; for he had also  caught  sight of his bound boy on the way to freedom. 
  &quot;You don't think they will stop the train for you, you fool!&quot; said  a man  standing by. &quot;You ought to have come sooner if you wanted to go  by this  train.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't want to go by it,&quot; said Abner. 
  &quot;What do you want, then?&quot; 
  &quot;My boy's run away, and I have just seen him aboard the train.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, that's it, is it? Your son?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I hope not. It's a young rascal that's bound to me.&quot; 
  &quot;If he's a young rascal, I shouldn't think you'd want him back.&quot; 
  Turning away, for he saw that he had failed, his glance rested on  Ralph. 
  Instantly his anger rose. 
  &quot;It's your doings,&quot; said he, shaking his fist in impotent wrath at  the  sturdy hunter, whom he would have attacked had he dared. &quot;It's  your  fault, and you shall pay for it if there's law in the land.&quot; 
  &quot;What will the law say to your attempt to shoot the boy?&quot; demanded   Ralph, coolly. 
  Abner turned pale, and realized that his best course was to keep  quiet  about an affair which might seriously compromise himself.
