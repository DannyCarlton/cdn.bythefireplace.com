  Alan's first thought was of the monstrous incongruity of the thing,  the almost physical impossibility of a mesalliance of the sort Mary  Standish had revealed to him. He saw her, young and beautiful, with  face and eyes that from the beginning had made him feel all that was  good and sweet in life, and behind her he saw the shadow-hulk of John  Graham, the pitiless iron-man, without conscience and without soul,  coarsened by power, fiendish in his iniquities, and old enough to be  her father!
  A slow smile twisted his lips, but he did not know he smiled. He  pulled himself together without letting her see the physical part of  the effort it was taking. And he tried to find something to say that  would help clear her eyes of the agony that was in them.
  &#8220;That&#8212;is a most unreasonable thing&#8212;to be true,&#8221; he said.
  It seemed to him his lips were making words out of wood, and that  the words were fatuously inefficient compared with what he should have  said, or acted, under the circumstances.
  She nodded. &#8220;It is. But the world doesn't look at it in that way.  Such things just happen.&#8221;
  She reached for a book which lay on the table where the tundra  daisies were heaped. It was a book written around the early phases of  pioneer life in Alaska, taken from his own library, a volume of  statistical worth, dryly but carefully written&#8212;and she had been  reading it. It struck him as a symbol of the fight she was making, of  her courage, and of her desire to triumph in the face of tremendous  odds that must have beset her. He still could not associate her  completely with John Graham. Yet his face was cold and white.
  Her hand trembled a little as she opened the book and took from it a  newspaper clipping. She did not speak as she unfolded it and gave it to  him.
  At the top of two printed columns was the picture of a young and  beautiful girl; in an oval, covering a small space over the girl's  shoulder, was a picture of a man of fifty or so. Both were strangers to  him. He read their names, and then the headlines. &#8220;A  Hundred-Million-Dollar Love&#8221; was the caption, and after the word love  was a dollar sign. Youth and age, beauty and the other thing, two great  fortunes united. He caught the idea and looked at Mary Standish. It was  impossible for him to think of her as Mary Graham.
  &#8220;I tore that from a paper in Cordova,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They have nothing  to do with me. The girl lives in Texas. But don't you see something in  her eyes? Can't you see it, even in the picture? She has on her wedding  things. But it seemed to me&#8212;when I saw her face&#8212;that in her eyes were  agony and despair and hopelessness, and that she was bravely trying to  hide them from the world. It's just another proof, one of thousands,  that such unreasonable things do happen.&#8221;
  He was beginning to feel a dull and painless sort of calm, the  stoicism which came to possess him whenever he was confronted by the  inevitable. He sat down, and with his head bowed over it took one of  the limp, little hands that lay in Mary Standish's lap. The warmth had  gone out of it. It was cold and lifeless. He caressed it gently and  held it between his brown, muscular hands, staring at it, and yet  seeing nothing in particular. It was only the ticking of Keok's clock  that broke the silence for a time. Then he released the hand, and it  dropped in the girl's lap again. She had been looking steadily at the  streak of gray in his hair. And a light came into her eyes, a light  which he did not see, and a little tremble of her lips, and an almost  imperceptible inclination of her head toward him.
  &#8220;I'm sorry I didn't know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I realize now how you must have  felt back there in the cottonwoods.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, you don't realize&#8212;<I>you don't!</I>&#8221; she protested.
  In an instant, it seemed to him, a vibrant, flaming life swept over  her again. It was as if his words had touched fire to some secret  thing, as if he had unlocked a door which grim hopelessness had closed.  He was amazed at the swiftness with which color came into her cheeks.
  &#8220;You don't understand, and I am determined that you<I> shall</I>,&#8221;  she went on. &#8220;I would die before I let you go away thinking what is now  in your mind. You will despise me, but I would rather be hated for the  truth than because of the horrible thing which you must believe if I  remain silent.&#8221; She forced a wan smile to her lips. &#8220;You know, Belinda  Mulrooneys were very well in their day, but they don't fit in now, do  they? If a woman makes a mistake and tries to remedy it in a fighting  sort of way, as Belinda Mulrooney might have done back in the days when  Alaska was young&#8212;&#8221;
  She finished with a little gesture of despair.
  &#8220;I have committed a great folly,&#8221; she said, hesitating an instant in  his silence. &#8220;I see very clearly now the course I should have taken.  You will advise me that it is still not too late when you have heard  what I am going to say. Your face is like&#8212;a rock.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is because your tragedy is mine,&#8221; he said.
  She turned her eyes from him. The color in her cheeks deepened. It  was a vivid, feverish glow. &#8220;I was born rich, enormously, hatefully  rich,&#8221; she said in the low, unimpassioned voice of a confessional. &#8220;I  don't remember father or mother. I lived always with my Grandfather  Standish and my Uncle Peter Standish. Until I was thirteen I had my  Uncle Peter, who was grandfather's brother, and lived with us. I  worshiped Uncle Peter. He was a cripple. From young manhood he had  lived in a wheel-chair, and he was nearly seventy-five when he died. As  a baby that wheel-chair, and my rides in it with him about the great  house in which we lived, were my delights. He was my father and mother,  everything that was good and sweet in life. I remember thinking, as a  child, that if God was as good as Uncle Peter, He was a wonderful God.  It was Uncle Peter who told me, year after year, the old stories and  legends of the Standishes. And he was always happy&#8212;always happy and  glad and seeing nothing but sunshine though he hadn't stood on his feet  for nearly sixty years. And my Uncle Peter died when I was thirteen,  five days before my birthday came. I think he must have been to me what  your father was to you.&#8221;
  He nodded. There was something that was not the hardness of rock in  his face now, and John Graham seemed to have faded away.
  &#8220;I was left, then, alone with my Grandfather Standish,&#8221; she went on.  &#8220;He didn't love me as my Uncle Peter loved me, and I don't think I  loved him. But I was proud of him. I thought the whole world must have  stood in awe of him, as I did. As I grew older I learned the world<I>  was</I> afraid of him&#8212;bankers, presidents, even the strongest men in  great financial interests; afraid of him, and of his partners, the  Grahams, and of Sharpleigh, who my Uncle Peter had told me was the  cleverest lawyer in the nation, and who had grown up in the business of  the two families. My grandfather was sixty-eight when Uncle Peter died,  so it was John Graham who was the actual working force behind the  combined fortunes of the two families. Sometimes, as I now recall it,  Uncle Peter was like a little child. I remember how he tried to make me  understand just how big my grandfather's interests were by telling me  that if two dollars were taken from every man, woman, and child in the  United States, it would just about add up to what he and the Grahams  possessed, and my Grandfather Standish's interests were three-quarters  of the whole. I remember how a hunted look would come into my Uncle  Peter's face at times when I asked him how all this money was used, and  where it was. And he never answered me as I wanted to be answered, and  I never understood. I didn't know<I> why</I> people feared my  grandfather and John Graham. I didn't know of the stupendous power my  grandfather's money had rolled up for them. I didn't know&#8221;&#8212;her voice  sank to a shuddering whisper&#8212;&#8220;I didn't know how they were using it in  Alaska, for instance. I didn't know it was feeding upon starvation and  ruin and death. I don't think even Uncle Peter knew<I> that</I>.&#8221;
  She looked at Alan steadily, and her gray eyes seemed burning up  with a slow fire.
  &#8220;Why, even then, before Uncle Peter died, I had become one of the  biggest factors in all their schemes. It was impossible for me to  suspect that John Graham was<I> anticipating</I> a little girl of  thirteen, and I didn't guess that my Grandfather Standish, so straight,  so grandly white of beard and hair, so like a god of power when he  stood among men, was even then planning that I should be given to him,  so that a monumental combination of wealth might increase itself still  more in that juggernaut of financial achievement for which he lived.  And to bring about my sacrifice, to make sure it would not fail, they  set Sharpleigh to the task, because Sharpleigh was sweet and good of  face, and gentle like Uncle Peter, so that I loved him and had  confidence in him, without a suspicion that under his white hair lay a  brain which matched in cunning and mercilessness that of John Graham  himself. And he did his work well, Alan.&#8221;
  A second time she had spoken his name, softly and without  embarrassment. With her nervous fingers tying and untying the two  corners of a little handkerchief in her lap, she went on, after a  moment of silence in which the ticking of Keok's clock seemed tense and  loud.
  &#8220;When I was seventeen, Grandfather Standish died. I wish you could  understand all that followed without my telling you: how I clung to  Sharpleigh as a father, how I trusted him, and how cleverly and gently  he educated me to the thought that it was right and just, and my  greatest duty in life, to carry out the stipulation of my grandfather's  will and marry John Graham. Otherwise, he told me&#8212;if that union was  not brought about before I was twenty-two&#8212;not a dollar of the great  fortune would go to the house of Standish; and because he was clever  enough to know that money alone would not urge me, he showed me a  letter which he said my Uncle Peter had written, and which I was to  read on my seventeenth birthday, and in that letter Uncle Peter urged  me to live up to the Standish name and join in that union of the two  great fortunes which he and Grandfather Standish had always planned. I  didn't dream the letter was a forgery. And in the end they won&#8212;and I  promised.&#8221;
  She sat with bowed head, crumpling the bit of cambric between her  fingers. &#8220;Do you despise me?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; he replied in a tense, unimpassioned voice. &#8220;I love you.&#8221;
  She tried to look at him calmly and bravely. In his face again lay  the immobility of rock, and in his eyes a sullen, slumbering fire.
  &#8220;I promised,&#8221; she repeated quickly, as if regretting the impulse  that had made her ask him the question. &#8220;But it was to be business, a  cold, unsentimental business. I disliked John Graham. Yet I would marry  him. In the eyes of the law I would be his wife; in the eyes of the  world I would remain his wife&#8212;but never more than that. They agreed,  and I in my ignorance believed.
  &#8220;I didn't see the trap. I didn't see the wicked triumph in John  Graham's heart. No power could have made me believe then that he wanted  to possess only<I> me</I>; that he was horrible enough to want me even  without love; that he was a great monster of a spider, and I the fly  lured into his web. And the agony of it was that in all the years since  Uncle Peter died I had dreamed strange and beautiful dreams. I lived in  a make-believe world of my own, and I read, read, read; and the thought  grew stronger and stronger in me that I had lived another life  somewhere, and that I belonged back in the years when the world was  clean, and there was love, and vast reaches of land wherein money and  power were little guessed of, and where romance and the glory of  manhood and womanhood rose above all other things. Oh, I wanted these  things, and yet because others had molded me, and because of my  misguided Standish sense of pride and honor, I was shackling myself to  John Graham.
  &#8220;In the last months preceding my twenty-second birthday I learned  more of the man than I had ever known before; rumors came to me; I  investigated a little, and I began to find the hatred, and the reason  for it, which has come to me so conclusively here in Alaska. I almost  knew, at the last, that he was a monster, but the world had been told I  was to marry him, and Sharpleigh with his fatherly hypocrisy was behind  me, and John Graham treated me so courteously and so coolly that I did  not suspect the terrible things in his heart and mind&#8212;and I went on  with the bargain.<I> I married him.</I>&#8220;
  She drew a sudden, deep breath, as if she had passed through the  ordeal of what she had most dreaded to say, and now, meeting the  changeless expression of Alan's face with a fierce, little cry that  leaped from her like a flash of gun-fire, she sprang to her feet and  stood with her back crushed against the tundra flowers, her voice  trembling as she continued, while he stood up and faced her.
  &#8220;You needn't go on,&#8221; he interrupted in a voice so low and terribly  hard that she felt the menacing thrill of it. &#8220;You needn't. I will  settle with John Graham, if God gives me the chance.&#8221;
  &#8220;You would have me stop<I> now</I>&#8212;before I have told you of the  only shred of triumph to which I may lay claim!&#8221; she protested. &#8220;Oh,  you may be sure that I realize the sickening folly and wickedness of it  all, but I swear before my God that I didn't realize it then, until it  was too late. To you, Alan, clean as the great mountains and plains  that have been a part of you, I know how impossible this must  seem&#8212;that I should marry a man I at first feared, then loathed, then  came to hate with a deadly hatred; that I should sacrifice myself  because I thought it was a duty; that I should be so weak, so ignorant,  so like soft clay in the hands of those I trusted. Yet I tell you that  at no time did I think or suspect that I was sacrificing<I> myself</I>;  at no time, blind though you may call me, did I see a hint of that  sickening danger into which I was voluntarily going. No, not even an  hour before the wedding did I suspect that, for it had all been so  coldly planned, like a great deal in finance&#8212;so carefully adjudged by  us all as a business affair, that I felt no fear except that sickness  of soul which comes of giving up one's life. And no hint of it came  until the last of the few words were spoken which made us man and wife,  and then I saw in John Graham's eyes something which I had never seen  there before. And Sharpleigh&#8212;&#8221;
  Her hands caught at her breast. Her gray eyes were pools of flame.
  &#8220;I went to my room. I didn't lock my door, because never had it been  necessary to do that. I didn't cry. No, I didn't cry. But something  strange was happening to me which tears might have prevented. It seemed  to me there were many walls to my room; I was faint; the windows seemed  to appear and disappear, and in that sickness I reached my bed. Then I  saw the door open, and John Graham came in, and closed the door behind  him, and locked it. My room. He had come into<I> my room!</I> The  unexpectedness of it&#8212;the horror&#8212;the insult roused me from my stupor.  I sprang up to face him, and there he stood, within arm's reach of me,  a look in his face which told me at last the truth which I had failed  to suspect&#8212;or fear. His arms were reaching out&#8212;
  &#8220;'You are my wife,' he said.
  &#8220;Oh, I knew, then. '<I>You are my wife</I>,' he repeated. I wanted  to scream, but I couldn't; and then&#8212;then&#8212;his arms reached me; I felt  them crushing around me like the coils of a great snake; the poison of  his lips was at my face&#8212;and I believed that I was lost, and that no  power could save me in this hour from the man who had come to my  room&#8212;the man who was my husband. I think it was Uncle Peter who gave  me voice, who put the right words in my brain, who made me laugh&#8212;yes,  laugh, and almost caress him with my hands. The change in me amazed  him, stunned him, and he freed me&#8212;while I told him that in these first  few hours of wifehood I wanted to be alone, and that he should come to  me that evening, and that I would be waiting for him. And I smiled at  him as I said these things, smiled while I wanted to kill him, and he  went, a great, gloating, triumphant beast, believing that the obedience  of wifehood was about to give him what he had expected to find through  dishonor&#8212;and I was left alone.
  &#8220;I thought of only one thing then&#8212;escape. I saw the truth. It swept  over me, inundated me, roared in my ears. All that I had ever lived  with Uncle Peter came back to me. This was not his world; it had never  been&#8212;and it was not mine. It was, all at once, a world of monsters. I  wanted never to face it again, never to look into the eyes of those I  had known. And even as these thoughts and desires swept upon me, I was  filling a traveling bag in a fever of madness, and Uncle Peter was at  my side, urging me to hurry, telling me I had no minutes to lose, for  the man who had left me was clever and might guess the truth that lay  hid behind my smiles and cajolery.
  &#8220;I stole out through the back of the house, and as I went I heard  Sharpleigh's low laughter in the library. It was a new kind of  laughter, and with it I heard John Graham's voice. I was thinking only  of the sea&#8212;to get away on the sea. A taxi took me to my bank, and I  drew money. I went to the wharves, intent only on boarding a ship, any  ship, and it seemed to me that Uncle Peter was leading me; and we came  to a great ship that was leaving for Alaska&#8212;and you know&#8212;what  happened then&#8212;Alan Holt.&#8221;
  With a sob she bowed her face in her hands, but only an instant it  was there, and when she looked at Alan again, there were no tears in  her eyes, but a soft glory of pride and exultation.
  &#8220;I am clean of John Graham,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;<I>Clean!</I>&#8220;
  He stood twisting his hands, twisting them in a helpless, futile  sort of way, and it was he, and not the girl, who felt like bowing his  head that the tears might come unseen. For her eyes were bright and  shining and clear as stars.
  &#8220;Do you despise me now?&#8221;
  &#8220;I love you,&#8221; he said again, and made no movement toward her.
  &#8220;I am glad,&#8221; she whispered, and she did not look at him, but at the  sunlit plain which lay beyond the window.
  &#8220;And Rossland was on the<I> Nome</I>, and saw you, and sent word  back to Graham,&#8221; he said, fighting to keep himself from going nearer to  her.
  She nodded. &#8220;Yes; and so I came to you, and failing there, I leaped  into the sea, for I wanted them to think I was dead.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Rossland was hurt.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. Strangely. I heard of it in Cordova. Men like Rossland  frequently come to unexpected ends.&#8221;
  He went to the door which she had closed, and opened it, and stood  looking toward the blue billows of the foothills with the white crests  of the mountains behind them. She came, after a moment, and stood  beside him.
  &#8220;I understand,&#8221; she said softly, and her hand lay in a gentle touch  upon his arm. &#8220;You are trying to see some way out, and you can see only  one. That is to go back, face the creatures I hate, regain my freedom  in the old way. And I, too, can see no other way. I came on impulse; I  must return with impulse and madness burned out of me. And I am sorry.  I dread it. I&#8212;would rather die.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I&#8212;&#8221; he began, then caught himself and pointed to the distant  hills and mountains. &#8220;The herds are there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am going to  them. I may be gone a week or more. Will you promise me to be here when  I return?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, if that is your desire.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is.&#8221;
  She was so near that his lips might have touched her shining hair.
  &#8220;And when you return, I must go. That will be the only way.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think so.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will be hard. It may be, after all, that I am a coward. But to  face all that&#8212;alone&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't be alone,&#8221; he said quietly, still looking at the far-away  hills. &#8220;If you go, I am going with you.&#8221;
  It seemed as if she had stopped breathing for a moment at his side,  and then, with a little, sobbing cry she drew away from him and stood  at the half-opened door of Nawadlook's room, and the glory in her eyes  was the glory of his dreams as he had wandered with her hand in hand  over the tundras in those days of grief and half-madness when he had  thought she was dead.
  &#8220;I am glad I was in Ellen McCormick's cabin the day you came,&#8221; she  was saying. &#8220;And I thank God for giving me the madness and courage to  come to<I> you</I>. I am not afraid of anything in the world  now&#8212;because&#8212;<I>I love you, Alan</I>!&#8221;
  And as Nawadlook's door closed behind her, Alan stumbled out into  the sunlight, a great drumming in his heart, and a tumult in his brain  that twisted the world about him until for a little it held neither  vision nor space nor sound.
