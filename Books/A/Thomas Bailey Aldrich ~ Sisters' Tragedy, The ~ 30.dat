<b>LINES FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF A HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE</b> 
The bloom that lies on Fanny's cheek<br> Is all my Latin, all my Greek;<br> The only sciences I know<br> Are frowns that gloom and smiles that glow;<br> Siberia and Italy<br> Lie in her sweet geography;<br> No scholarship have I but such<br> As teaches me to love her much. 
Why should I strive to read the skies,<br> Who know the midnight of her eyes?<br> Why should I go so very far<br> To learn what heavenly bodies are!<br> Not Berenice's starry hair<br> With Fanny's tresses can compare;<br> Not Venus on a cloudless night,<br> Enslaving Science with her light,<br> Ever reveals so much as when<br> SHE stares and droops her lids again. 
If Nature's secrets are forbidden<br> To mortals, she may keep them hidden.<br> AEons and aeons we progressed<br> And did not let that break our rest;<br> Little we cared if Mars o'erhead<br> Were or were not inhabited;<br> Without the aid of Saturn's rings<br> Fair girls were wived in those far springs;<br> Warm lips met ours and conquered us<br> Or ere thou wert, Copernicus! 
Graybeards, who seek to bridge the chasm<br> 'Twixt man to-day and protoplasm,<br> Who theorize and probe and gape,<br> And finally evolve an ape--<br> Yours is a harmless sort of cult,<br> If you are pleased with the result.<br> Some folks admit, with cynic grace,<br> That you have rather proved your case.<br> These dogmatists are so severe!<br> Enough for me that Fanny's here,<br> Enough that, having long survived<br> Pre-Eveic forms, she HAS arrived--<br> An illustration the completest<br> Of the survival of the sweetest. 
Linnaeus, avaunt! I only care<br> To know what flower she wants to wear.<br> I leave it to the addle-pated<br> To guess how pinks originated,<br> As if it mattered! The chief thing<br> Is that we have them in the Spring,<br> And Fanny likes them. When they come,<br> I straightway send and purchase some.<br> The Origin of Plants--go to!<br> Their proper end _I_ have in view. 
O loveliest book that ever man<br> Looked into since the world began<br> Is Woman! As I turn those pages,<br> As fresh as in the primal ages,<br> As day by day I scan, perplext,<br> The ever subtly changing text,<br> I feel that I am slowly growing<br> To think no other work worth knowing.<br> And in my copy--there is none<br> So perfect as the one I own--<br> I find no thing set down but such<br> As teaches me to love it much.
