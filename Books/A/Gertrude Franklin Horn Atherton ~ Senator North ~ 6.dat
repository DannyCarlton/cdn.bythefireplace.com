As soon as Betty awoke the next morning, she turned her mind to the  events of the night before. Unlike most occasions eagerly anticipated,  it had contained no disappointment; she had, indeed, been pleasurably  surprised, for despite her strong common-sense the dark picture of  corruption and objectionable toilet accessories had made its  impression upon her. She foresaw much amusement in witnessing the  unwilling surrender of her mother to even Senator Shattuc, him of  the political beard. As for Senator Burleigh, she would yield to his  magnetism and power of compelling interest in himself, while  pronouncing his manners too abrupt and his personality too "Western."  And if he admired intelligently the old lace which she always wore at  her throat and wrists and on her pretty head, she would confess that  there might be exceptions even to political rules.    
But somewhat to Betty's surprise it was not of Senator Burleigh that  she thought most, although she had talked with him for two hours and  pronounced him charming. She had talked with Senator North for exactly  six minutes, but she saw his face more distinctly than Burleigh's and  retained his voice in her ear. He had not paid her a compliment, but  his manner had expressed that she interested him and that he thought  her worth meeting. For the first time in her life Betty felt flattered  by the admiration of a man; and she had held her own with more than  one of distinction on the other side. Even royalty had not fluttered  her, but she conceived an eager desire to make this man think well of  her. It irritated her to remember that she could have made no mental  impression on him whatever. She became uncheerful, and reflected that  the subtle flattery in his manner was probably a mere habit; Lady Mary  had intimated that he liked women and had loved several. Well, she  cared nothing about that; he was thirty years older than herself and  married; but she admired him and wished for his good opinion and to  hear him talk. Doubtless they soon would meet again, and if they were  left in conversation for a decent length of time she would ask him to  call. She cast about in her mind for a subterfuge which would justify  a note, but she could think of none, and was too worldly-wise to evoke  a smile from the depths of a man's conceit.    
Her mother refused to bid her good-by when, accompanied by her maid,  she started for the Capitol at twenty minutes to three. A few moments  later she found herself admiring for the first time the big stately  building on the hill at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue. She always had  thought Washington a beautiful city, with its wide quiet avenues set  thick with trees, its graceful parks, each with a statue of some man  gratefully remembered by the Republic, but she had given little heed  to its public buildings and their significance. As she approached  the great white Capitol, she experienced a sudden thrill of that  historical sense which, after its awakening, dominates so actively the  large intelligence. The Capitol symbolized the greatness of the young  nation; all the famous American statesmen after the first group had  moved and made their reputations within its walls. All laws affecting  the nation came out of it, and the Judges of the Supreme Court sat  there. And of its kind there was none other in the civilized world,  had been but one other since the world began.    
The historic building shed an added lustre upon Senator Burleigh; but  it was of Senator North that she thought most as she half rose in the  Victoria and scanned the long sweep. The cleverest of women cannot  class with anything like precision the man who has stamped himself  into her imagination. Betty knew that there were six men in the Senate  who ranked as equals; their quiet epoch gave them little chance to  discover latent genius other than for constructive legislation;  nevertheless she arbitrarily conceived the Capitol to-day as the great  setting for one man only; and the building and the man became one in  her imagination henceforth. The truth was that Betty, being greatly  endowed for loving and finding that all men fell short of her high  standard, was forced to seek companionship in an ideal. She had had  several loves in history, but had come to the conclusion some years  since that dead men were unsatisfactory. Since then she had fancied  mightily one or two public men on the other side, whom she had never  met; but in time they had bored or disappointed her. But here was a  conspicuous figure in her own country, appealing to her through the  powerful medium of patriotic pride; a man so much alive that he might  at any moment hold the destinies of the United States in his hands,  and who, owing to his years and impenetrable dignity, was not to be  considered from the ordinary view-point of woman. She would coquet  with Senator Burleigh; it was on the cards that she would love him,  for he was brilliant, ambitious, and honourable; but Senator North was  exalted to the vacant pedestal reserved for ideals, and Betty settled  herself comfortably to his worship; not guessing that he would be  under her memory's dust-heap in ten days if Senator Burleigh captured  her heart.    
The coachman was directed by a policeman to the covered portico of the  Senate wing. Betty had a bare glimpse of corridors apparently  interminable, before another policeman put her into the elevator and  told her to get off when the boy said "Gallery."    
Senator Burleigh was waiting for her, and she thought him even manlier  and more imposing in his gray tweed than in evening dress. He shook  her hand heartily, and assured her in his abrupt dictatorial way that  it gave him the greatest pleasure to meet her again.    
"I'm sorry I haven't time to take you all over the building," he  said," but I have two Committee meetings this afternoon. You must come  down some morning."    
His manner was very businesslike, and he seemed a trifle absent as he  paused a moment and called her attention to the daub illustrating the  Electoral Commission; but this, Betty assumed, was the senatorial  manner by day. In a moment he led her to one of the doors in the wall  that encloses the Senate Gallery.    
"You see this lady," he said peremptorily to the doorkeeper, who rose  hastily from his chair. "She is always to be admitted to this gallery.  Take a good look at her."    
"Yes, sir; member of your family, I presume?"    
"You can assume that she is my sister. Only see that you admit her."    
"The rules are very strict in regard to this gallery," he added, as he  closed the door behind them. "It is only for the families of the  Senators, but you will like it better than the reserved gallery. Send  for me if there should be trouble at any time about admittance."    
"I usually get where I wish! I sha'n't trouble you."    
"Don't you ever think twice about troubling me," he said. "Let us go  down to the front row."    
The galleries surrounding the great Chamber were almost dark under the  flat roof, but the space below was full of light. It looked very  sumptuous with its ninety desks and easy-chairs, and a big fire beyond  an open door; and very legislative with its president elevated above  the Senators and the row of clerks beneath him. There were perhaps  thirty Senators in the room, and they were talking in groups or  couples, reading newspapers, or writing letters. One Senator was  making a speech.    
"I don't think they are very polite," said Betty. "Why don't they  listen? He seems to be in earnest and speaks very nicely." "Oh, he is  talking to his constituents, not to the Senate--although he would be  quite pleased if it would listen to him. He does not amount to much.  We listen to each other when it is worth while; but this is a Club,  Miss Madison, the most delightful Club in the United States. Just  beyond are the cloakrooms, where we can lounge before the fire and  smoke, or lie down and go to sleep. The hard work is in the Committee  rooms, and it is hard enough to justify all the pleasure we can get  out of the other side of the life. Now, I'll tell you who these are  and something about them."    
He pointed out one after the other in his quick businesslike way,  rattling off biographical details; but Betty, feeling that she was  getting but a mass of impressions with many heads, interrupted him.    
"I don't see Senator North," she said. "I thought he was going to  speak."    
"He will, later. He is in his Committee room now, but he'll go down as  soon as a page takes him word that the clerk is about to read the bill  whose Committee amendments he is sure to object to. Now I must go. I  shall give myself the pleasure of calling a week from Sunday. You must  come often, and always come here. And let me give you two pieces of  advice: never bow to any Senator from up here, and never go to the  Marble Room and send in a card. Then you can come every day without  attracting attention. Good-bye."    
Betty thanked him, and he departed. For the next hour she found the  proceedings very dull. The unregarded Senator finished his speech and  retired behind a newspaper. Other members clapped their hands, and the  pages scampered down the gangways and carried back documents to the  clerk below the Vice-President's chair, while their senders made a few  remarks meaningless to Betty. Two or three delivered brief speeches  which were equally unintelligible to one not acquainted with current  legislation. During one of them a man of imposing appearance entered  and was apparently congratulated by almost every one in the room, the  Senators leaving their seats and coming to the middle aisle, where he  stood, to shake him by the hand. Betty felt sorry for Leontine, who  was on the verge of tears, but determined to remain until Senator  North appeared if she did not leave until it should be time to dress  for dinner.    
He entered finally and went straight to his desk. He looked  preoccupied, and began writing at once. In a few moments the clerk  commenced to read from a document, and Senator North laid aside his  pen and listened attentively. So did several other Senators. It was a  very long document, and Betty, who could not understand one word in  ten as delivered by the clerk's rumbling monotonous voice, was  desperately bored, and was glad her Senators had the solace of the  cloak-rooms. Several did in fact retire to them, but when the clerk  sat down and Senator North rose, they returned; and Betty felt a  personal pride in the fact that they were about to listen to the  Senator whom herself had elected to honour.    
She had to lean forward and strain her ears to hear him. It was  evident that he did not recognize the existence of the gallery, for he  did not raise his voice from beginning to end; and yet it was of that  strong rich quality that might have carried far. But it neither "rang  out like a clarion," nor "thundered imprecation." Neither did he utter  an impassioned phrase nor waste a word, but he denounced the bill as a  party measure, exposed its weak points, riddled it with sarcasm, and  piled up damaging evidence of partisan zeal. "This is an honourable  body," he concluded, "and few measures go out of it that are open to  serious criticism by the self-constituted guardians of legislative  virtue, but if this bill goes through the Senate we shall invite from  the thinking people of the country the same sort of criticism which we  now receive from the ignorant. If the high standard of this body is to  be maintained, it must be by sound and conservative legislation, not  by grovelling to future legislatures."    
Having administered this final slap, he sat down and began writing  again, apparently paying no attention to the Chairman of the bill, who  defended his measure with eloquence and vigour. It was a good speech,  but it contained more words than the one that had provoked it and  fewer points. Senator North replied briefly that the only chance for  the bill was for its father to refrain from calling attention to its  weak points, then went into the Republican cloak-room, presumably to  smoke a cigar. Betty, whose head ached, went home.
