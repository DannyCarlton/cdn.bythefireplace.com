Tyrrel took a hansom, and tore round in hot haste to Erasmus Walker's  house. He sent in his card. The famous engineer was happily at home.  Tyrrel, all on fire, found himself ushered into the great man's study.  Mr. Walker sat writing at a luxurious desk in a most luxurious room--  writing, as if for dear life, in breathless haste and eagerness. He  simply paused for a second in the midst of a sentence, and looked up  impatiently at the intruder on his desperate hurry. Then he motioned  Tyrrel into a chair with an imperious wave of his ivory penholder.  After that, he went on writing for some moments in solemn silence.  Only the sound of his steel nib, traveling fast as it could go over  the foolscap sheet, broke for several seconds the embarrassing  stillness.    
Walter Tyrrel, therefore, had ample time meanwhile to consider his  host and to take in his peculiarities before Walker had come to the  end of his paragraph. The great engineer was a big-built, bull-necked,  bullet-headed sort of person, with the self-satisfied air of monetary  success, but with that ominous hardness about the corners of the mouth  which constantly betrays the lucky man of business. His abundant long  hair was iron-gray and wiry--Erasmus Walker had seldom time to waste  in getting it cut--his eyes were small and shrewd; his hand was firm,  and gripped the pen in its grasp like a ponderous crowbar. His  writing, Tyrrel could see, was thick, black, and decisive. Altogether  the kind of man on whose brow it was written in legible characters  that it's dogged as does it. The delicately organized Cornishman felt  an instinctive dislike at once for this great coarse mountain of a  bullying Teuton. Yet for Cleer's sake he knew he mustn't rub him the  wrong way. He must put up with Erasmus Walker and all his faults, and  try to approach him by the most accessible side--if indeed any side  were accessible at all, save the waistcoat pocket.    
At last, however, the engineer paused a moment in his headlong course  through sentence after sentence, held his pen half irresolute over a  new blank sheet, and turning round to Tyrrel, without one word of  apology, said, in a quick, decisive voice, "This is business, I  suppose, business? for if not, I've no time. I'm very pressed this  morning. Very pressed, indeed. Very pressed and occupied."    
"Yes, it is business," Tyrrel answered, promptly, taking his cue with  Celtic quickness. "Business that may be worth a good deal of money."  Erasmus Walker pricked up his ears at that welcome sound, and let the  pen drop quietly into the rack by his side. "Only I'm afraid I must  ask for a quarter of an hour or so of your valuable time. You will not  find it thrown away. You can name your own price for it."    
"My dear sir," the engineer replied, taking up his visitor's card  again and gazing at it hard with a certain inquiring scrutiny, "if  it's business, and business of an important character, of course I  need hardly say I'm very glad to attend to you. There are so many  people who come bothering me for nothing, don't you know--charitable  appeals or what not--that I'm obliged to make a hard and fast rule  about interviews. But if it's business you mean, I'm your man at once.  I live for public works. Go ahead. I'm all attention."    
He wheeled round in his revolving chair, and faced Tyrrel in an  attitude of sharp practical eagerness. His eye was all alert. It was  clear, the man was keen on every passing chance of a stray hundred or  two extra. His keenness disconcerted the conscientious and idealistic  Cornishman. For a second or two Tyrrel debated how to open fire upon  so unwonted an enemy. At last he began, stammering, "I've a friend who  has made a design for the Wharfedale Viaduct."    
"Exactly," Erasmus Walker answered, pouncing down upon him like a  hawk. "And I've made one too. And as mine's in the field, why, your  friend's is waste paper."    
His sharpness half silenced Tyrrel. But with an effort the younger man  went on, in spite of interruption. "That's precisely what I've come  about," he said; "I know that already. If only you'll have patience  and hear me out while I unfold my plan, you'll find what I have to  propose is all to your own interest. I'm prepared to pay well for the  arrangement I ask. Will you name your own price for half an hour's  conversation, and then listen to me straight on and without further  interruption?"    
Erasmus Walker glanced back at him with those keen ferret-like eyes of  his. "Why, certainly," he answered; "I'll listen if you wish. We'll  treat it as a consultation. My fees for consultation depend, of  course, upon the nature of the subject on which advice is asked. But  you'll pay well, you say, for the scheme you propose. Now, this is  business. Therefore, we must be business-like. So first, what  guarantee have I of your means and solvency? I don't deal with men of  straw. Are you known in the City?" He jerked out his sentences as if  words were extorted from him at so much per thousand.    
"I am not," Tyrrel answered, quietly; "but I gave you my card, and you  can see from it who I am--Walter Tyrrel of Penmorgan Manor. I'm a  landed proprietor, with a good estate in Cornwall. And I'm prepared to  risk--well, a large part of my property in the business I propose to  you, without any corresponding risk on your part. In plain words, I'm  prepared to pay you money down, if you will accede to my wish, on a  pure matter of sentiment."    
"Sentiment?" Mr. Walker replied, bringing his jaw down like a rat-  trap, and gazing across at him, dubiously. "I don't deal in  sentiment."    
"No; probably not," Tyrrel answered. "But I said sentiment, Mr.  Walker, and I'm willing to pay for it. I know very well it's an  article at a discount in the City. Still, to me, it means money's  worth, and I'm prepared to give money down to a good tune to humor it.  Let me explain the situation. I'll do so as briefly and as simply as I  can, if only you'll listen to me. A friend of mine, as I said, one  Eustace Le Neve, who has been constructing engineer of the Rosario and  Santa Fe, in the Argentine Confederacy, has made a design for the  Wharfedale Viaduct. It's a very good design, and a practical design;  and Sir Edward Jones, who has seen it, entirely approves of it."    
"Jones is a good man," Mr. Walker murmured, nodding his head in  acquiescence. "No dashed nonsense about Jones. Head screwed on the  right way. Jones is a good man and knows what he's talking about."  "Well, Jones says it's a good design," Tyrrel went on, breathing freer  as he gauged his man more completely. "And the facts are just these:  My friend's engaged to a young lady up in town here, in whom I take a  deep interest--" Mr. Walker whistled low to himself, but didn't  interrupt him--"a deep <i>friendly</i> interest," Tyrrel corrected, growing  hot in the face at the man's evident insolent misconstruction of his  motives; "and the long and the short of it is, his chance of marrying  her depends very much upon whether or not he can get this design of  his accepted by the directors."    
"He can't," Mr. Walker said, promptly, "unless he buys me out. That's  pat and flat. He can't, for mine's in; and mine's sure to be taken."    
"So I understand," Tyrrel went on. "Your name, I'm told, carries  everything before it. But what I want to suggest now is simply this--  How much will you take, money down on the nail, this minute, to  withdraw your own design from the informal competition?"    
Erasmus Walker gasped hard, drew a long breath, and stared at him.  "How much will I take," he repeated, slowly; "how--much--will--I--  take--to withdraw my design? Well, that <i>is</i> remarkable!"    
"I mean it," Tyrrel repeated, with a very serious face. "This is to  me, I will confess, a matter of life and death. I want to see my  friend Le Neve in a good position in the world, such as his talents  entitle him to. I don't care how much I spend in order to insure it.  So what I want to know is just this and nothing else--how much will  you take to withdraw from the competition?"    
Erasmus Walker laid his two hands on his fat knees, with his legs wide  open, and stared long and hard at his incomprehensible visitor. So  strange a request stunned for a moment even that sound business head.  A minute or two he paused. Then, with a violent effort, he pulled  himself together. "Come, come," he said, "Mr. Tyrrel; let's be  practical and above-board. I don't want to rob you. I don't want to  plunder you. I see you mean business. But how do you know, suppose  even you buy me out, this young fellow's design has any chance of  being accepted? What reason have you to think the Great North Midland  people are likely to give such a job to an unknown beginner?"    
"Sir Edward Jones says it's admirable," Tyrrel ventured, dubiously.    
"Sir Edward Jones says it's admirable! Well, that's good, as far as it  goes. Jones knows what he's talking about. Head's screwed on the right  way. But has your friend any interest with the directors--that's the  question? Have you reason to think, if he sends it in, and I hold back  mine, his is the plan they'd be likely to pitch upon?"    
"I go upon its merits," Walter Tyrrel said, quietly.    
"The very worst thing on earth any man can ever possibly go upon," the  man of business retorted, with cynical confidence. "If that's all  you've got to say, my dear sir, it wouldn't be fair of me to make  money terms with you. I won't discuss my price in the matter till I've  some reason to believe this idea of yours is workable."    
"I have the designs here all ready," Walter Tyrrel replied, holding  them out. "Plans, elevations, specifications, estimates, sections,  figures, everything. Will you do me the favor to look at them? Then,  perhaps, you'll be able to see whether or not the offer's genuine."    
The great engineer took the roll with a smile. He opened it hastily,  in a most skeptical humor. Walter Tyrrel leant over him, and tried  just at first to put in a word or two of explanation, such as Le Neve  had made to himself; but an occasionally testy "Yes, yes; I see," was  all the thanks he got for his pains and trouble. After a minute or two  he found out it was better to let the engineer alone. That practiced  eye picked out in a moment the strong and weak points of the whole  conception. Gradually, however, as Walker went on, Walter Tyrrel could  see he paid more and more attention to every tiny detail. His whole  manner altered. The skeptical smile faded away, little by little, from  those thick, sensuous lips, and a look of keen interest took its place  by degrees on the man's eager features. "That's good!" he murmured  more than once, as he examined more closely some section or  enlargement. "That's good! very good! knows what he's about, this  Eustace Le Neve man!" Now and again he turned back, to re-examine some  special point. "Clever dodge!" he murmured, half to himself. "Clever  dodge, undoubtedly. Make an engineer in time--no doubt at all about  that--if only they'll give him his head, and not try to thwart him."    
Tyrrel waited till he'd finished. Then he leant forward once more.  "Well, what do you think of it now?" he asked, flushing hot. "Is this  business--or otherwise?"    
"Oh, business, business," the great engineer murmured, musically,  regarding the papers before him with a certain professional affection.  "It's a devilish clever plan--I won't deny that--and it's devilish  well carried out in every detail."    
Tyrrel seized his opportunity. "And if you were to withdraw your own  design," he asked, somewhat nervously, hardly knowing how best to  frame his delicate question, "do you think ... the directors ... would  be likely to accept this one?"    
Erasmus Walker hummed and hawed. He twirled his fat thumbs round one  another in doubt. Then he answered oracularly, "They might, of course;  and yet, again, they mightn't."    
"Upon whom would the decision rest?" Tyrrel inquired, looking hard at  him.    
"Upon me, almost entirely," the great engineer responded at once, with  cheerful frankness. "To say the plain truth, they've no minds of their  own, these men. They'd ask my advice, and accept it implicitly."    
"So Jones told me," Tyrrel answered.    
"So Jones told you--quite right," the engineer echoed, with a  complacent nod. "They've no minds of their own, you see. They'll do  just as I tell them."    
"And you think this design of Le Neve's a good one, both mechanically  and financially, and also exceptionally safe as regards the lives and  limbs of passengers and employees?" Tyrrel inquired once more, with  anxious particularity. His tender conscience made him afraid to do  anything in the matter unless he was quite sure in his own mind he was  doing no wrong in any way either to shareholders, competitors, or the  public generally.    
"My dear sir," Mr. Walker replied, fingering the papers lovingly,  "it's an admirable design--sound, cheap, and practical. It's as good  as it can be. To tell you the truth, I admire it immensely."    
"Well, then," Tyrrel said at last, all his scruples removed--"let's  come to business. I put it plainly. How much will you take to withdraw  your own design, and to throw your weight into the scale in favor of  my friend's here?"    
Erasmus Walker closed one eye, and rewarded his visitor fixedly out of  the other for a minute or two in silence, as if taking his bearings.  It was a trick he had acquired from frequent use of a theodolite. Then  he answered at last, after a long, deep pause, "It's <i>your</i> deal, Mr.  Tyrrel. Make me an offer, won't you?"    
"Five thousand pounds?" tremblingly suggested Walter Tyrrel.    
Erasmus Walker opened his eye slowly, and never allowed his surprise  to be visible on his face. Why, to him, a job like that, entailing  loss of time in personal supervision, was hardly worth three. The  plans were perfunctory, and as far as there was anything in them,  could be used again elsewhere. He could employ his precious days  meanwhile to better purpose in some more showy and profitable work  than this half-hatched viaduct. But this was an upset price. "Not  enough," he murmured, slowly, shaking his bullet head. "It's a fortune  to the young man. You must make a better offer."    
Walter Tyrrel's lip quivered. "Six thousand," he said, promptly.    
The engineer judged from the promptitude of the reply that the Cornish  landlord must still be well squeezable. He shook his head gain. "No,  no; not enough," he answered short. "Not enough--by a long way."    
"Eight," Tyrrel suggested, drawing a deep breath of suspense. It was a  big sum, indeed, for a modest estate like Penmorgan.    
The engineer shook his head once more. That rush up two thousand at  once was a very good feature. The man who could mount by two thousand  at a time might surely be squeezed to the even figure.    
"I'm afraid," Walter said, quivering, after a brief mental  calculation--mortgage at four per cent--and agricultural depression  running down the current value of land in the market--"I couldn't by  any possibility go beyond ten thousand. But to save my friend--and to  get the young lady married--I wouldn't mind going as far as that to  meet you."    
The engineer saw at once, with true business instinct, his man had  reached the end of his tether. He struck while the iron was hot and  clinched the bargain. "Well,--as there's a lady in the case"--he said,  gallantly,--"and to serve a young man of undoubted talent, who'll do  honor to the profession, I don't mind closing with you. I'll take ten  thousand, money down, to back out of it myself, and I'll say what I  can--honestly--to the Midland Board in your friend's favor."    
"Very good," Tyrrel answered, drawing a deep breath of relief. "I ask  no more than that. Say what you can honestly. The money shall be paid  you before the end of a fortnight."    
"Only, mind," Mr. Walker added in an impressive afterthought, "I  can't, of course, <i>engage</i> that the Great North Midland people will take  my advice. You mustn't come down upon me for restitution and all that  if your friend don't succeed and they take some other fellow. All I  guarantee for certain is to withdraw my own plans--not to send in  anything myself for the competition."    
"I fully understand," Tyrrel answered. "And I'm content to risk it.  But, mind, if any other design is submitted of superior excellence to  Le Neve's, I wouldn't wish you on any account to--to do or say  anything that goes against your conscience."    
Erasmus Walker stared at him. "What--after paying ten thousand  pounds?" he said, "to secure the job?"    
Tyrrel nodded a solemn nod. "Especially," he added, "if you think it  safer to life and limb. I should never forgive myself if an accident  were to occur on Eustace Le Neve's viaduct."
