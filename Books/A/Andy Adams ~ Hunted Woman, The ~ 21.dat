  For a minute, perhaps longer, John Aldous stood staring at the  photograph which he held in his hand. It was the picture of Culver  Rann&#8212;not once did he question that fact, and not once did the thought  flash upon him that this might be only an unusual and startling  resemblance. It was assuredly Culver Rann! The picture dropped from his  hand to the table, and he went toward the door. His first impulse was  to go to Joanne. But when he reached the door he locked it, and dropped  into a chair, facing the mirror in his dresser.
  The reflection of his own face was a shock to him. If he was pale,  the dust and grime of his fight in the cavern concealed his pallor. But  the face that stared at him from out of the glass was haggard, wildly  and almost grotesquely haggard, and he turned from it with a grim  laugh, and set his jaws hard. He returned to the table, and bit by bit  tore the photograph into thin shreds, and then piled the shreds on his  ash-tray and burned them. He opened a window to let out the smoke and  smell of charring paper, and the fresh, cool air of early evening  struck his face. He could look off through the fading sunshine of the  valley and see the mountain where Coyote Number Twenty-eight was to  have done its work, and as he looked he gripped the window-sill so  fiercely that the nails of his fingers were bent and broken against the  wood. And in his brain the same words kept repeating themselves over  and over again. Mortimer FitzHugh was not dead. He was alive. He was  Culver Rann. And Joanne&#8212;Joanne was not<I> his</I> wife; she was still  the wife of Mortimer FitzHugh&#8212;of Culver Rann!
  He turned again to the mirror, and there was another look in his  face. It was grim, terribly grim&#8212;and smiling. There was no excitement,  nothing of the passion and half-madness with which he had faced Quade  and Rann the night before. He laughed softly, and his nails dug as  harshly into the palms of his hands as they had dug into the sills of  the window.
  &#8220;You poor, drivelling, cowardly fool!&#8221; he said to his reflection.  &#8220;And you dare to say&#8212;you dare to<I> think</I> that she is not your  wife?&#8221;
  As if in reply to his words there came a knock at the door, and from  the hall Blackton called:
  &#8220;Here's MacDonald, Aldous. He wants to see you.&#8221;
  Aldous opened the door and the old hunter entered.
  &#8220;If I ain't interruptin' you, Johnny&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You're the one man in the world I want to see, Mac. No, I'll take  that back; there's one other I want to see worse than you&#8212;Culver  Rann.&#8221;
  The strange look in his face made old Donald stare.
  &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said, drawing two chairs close to the table. &#8220;There's  something to talk about. It was a terribly close shave, wasn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;An awful close shave, Johnny. As close a shave as ever was.&#8221;
  Still, as if not quite understanding what he saw, old Donald was  staring into John's face.
  &#8220;I'm glad it happened,&#8221; said Aldous, and his voice became softer.  &#8220;She loves me, Mac. It all came out when we were in there, and thought  we were going to die. Not ten minutes ago the minister was here, and he  made us man and wife.&#8221;
  Words of gladness that sprang to the old man's lips were stopped by  that strange, cold, tense look in the face of John Aldous.
  &#8220;And in the last five minutes,&#8221; continued Aldous, as quietly as  before, &#8220;I have learned that Mortimer FitzHugh, her husband, is not  dead. Is it very remarkable that you do not find me happy, Mac? If you  had come a few minutes ago&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, my God! Johnny! Johnny!&#8221;
  MacDonald had pitched forward over the table, and now he bowed his  great shaggy head in his hands, and his gaunt shoulders shook as his  voice came brokenly through his beard.
  &#8220;I did it, Johnny; I did it for you an' her! When I knew what it  would mean for her&#8212;I<I> couldn't</I>, Johnny, I couldn't tell her the  truth, 'cause I knew she loved you, an' you loved her, an' it would  break her heart. I thought it would be best, an' you'd go away  together, an' nobody would ever know, an' you'd be happy. I didn't lie.  I didn't say anything. But Johnny&#8212;Johnny,<I> there weren't no bones in  the grave!</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;My God!&#8221; breathed Aldous.
  &#8220;There were just some clothes,&#8221; went on MacDonald huskily, &#8220;an' the  watch an' the ring were on top. Johnny, there weren't nobody ever  buried there, an' I'm to blame&#8212;I'm to blame.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you did that for us,&#8221; cried Aldous, and suddenly he reached  over and gripped old Donald's hands. &#8220;It wasn't a mistake, Mac. I thank  God you kept silent. If you had told her that the grave was empty, that  it was a fraud, I don't know what would have happened. And now&#8212;she is<I>  mine!</I> If she had seen Culver Rann, if she had discovered that this  scoundrel, this blackmailer and murderer, was Mortimer FitzHugh, her  husband&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Johnny! John Aldous!&#8221;
  Donald MacDonald's voice came now like the deep growling roar of a  she-bear, and as he cried the other's name he sprang to his feet, and  his eyes gleamed in their deep sockets like raging fires.
  &#8220;Johnny!&#8221;
  Aldous rose, and he was smiling. He nodded.
  &#8220;That's it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mortimer FitzHugh is Culver Rann!&#8221;
  &#8220;An'&#8212;an' you know this?&#8221;
  &#8220;Absolutely. Joanne gave me Mortimer FitzHugh's photograph to  destroy. I am sorry that I burned it before you saw it. But there is no  doubt. Mortimer FitzHugh and Culver Rann are the same man.&#8221;
  Slowly the old mountaineer turned to the door. Aldous was ahead of  him, and stood with his hand on the knob.
  &#8220;I don't want you to go yet, Mac.&#8221;
  &#8220;I&#8212;I'll see you a little later,&#8221; said Donald clumsily.
  &#8220;Donald!&#8221;
  &#8220;Johnny!&#8221;
  For a full half minute they looked steadily into each other's eyes.
  &#8220;Only a week, Johnny,&#8221; pleaded Donald. &#8220;I'll be back in a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean that you will kill him?&#8221;
  &#8220;He'll never come back. I swear it, Johnny!&#8221;
  As gently as he might have led Joanne, Aldous drew the mountaineer  back to the chair.
  &#8220;That would be cold-blooded murder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I would be the  murderer. I can't send you out to do my killing, Mac, as I might send  out a hired assassin. Don't you see that I can't? Good heaven, some  day&#8212;very soon&#8212;I will tell you how this hound, Mortimer FitzHugh,  poisoned Joanne's life, and did his worst to destroy her. It's to me  he's got to answer, Donald. And to me he shall answer. I am going to  kill him. But it will not be murder. Since you have come into this room  I have made my final plan, and I shall follow it to the end coolly and  deliberately. It will be a great game, Mac&#8212;and it will be a fair game;  and I shall play it happily, because Joanne will not know, and I will  be strengthened by her love.
  &#8220;Quade wants my life, and tried to hire Stevens, up at Miette, to  kill me. Culver Rann wants my life; a little later it will come to be  the greatest desire of his existence to have me dead and out of the  way. I shall give him the chance to do the killing, Mac. I shall give  him a splendid chance, and he will not fail to accept his opportunity.  Perhaps he will have an advantage, but I am as absolutely certain of  killing him as I am that the sun is going down behind the mountains out  there. If others should step in, if I should have more than Culver Rann  on my hands&#8212;why, then you may deal yourself a hand if you like,  Donald. It may be a bigger game than One against One.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will,&#8221; rumbled MacDonald. &#8220;I learned other things early this  afternoon, Johnny. Quade did not stay behind. He went with Rann. DeBar  and the woman are with them, and two other men. They went over the Lone  Cache Pass, and this minute are hurrying straight for the headwaters of  the Parsnip. There are five of 'em&#8212;five men.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we are two,&#8221; smiled Aldous. &#8220;So there<I> is</I> an advantage on  their side, isn't there, Mac? And it makes the game most eminently  fair, doesn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Johnny, we're good for the five!&#8221; cried old Donald in a low, eager  voice. &#8220;If we start now&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Can you have everything ready by morning?&#8221;
  &#8220;The outfit's waiting. It's ready now, Johnny.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll leave at dawn. I'll come to you to-night in the coulee,  and we'll make our final plans. My brain is a little muddled now, and  I've got to clear it, and make myself presentable before supper. We  must not let Joanne know. She must suspect nothing&#8212;absolutely  nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; repeated MacDonald as he went to the door.
  There he paused and, hesitating for a moment, leaned close to  Aldous, and said in a low voice:
  &#8220;Johnny, I've been wondering why the grave were empty. I've been  wondering why there weren't somebody's bones there just t' give it the  look it should 'a' had an' why the clothes were laid out so nicely with  the watch an' the ring on top!&#8221;
  With that he was gone, and Aldous closed and relocked the door.
  He was amazed at his own composure as he washed himself and  proceeded to dress for supper. What had happened had stunned him at  first, had even terrified him for a few appalling moments. Now he was  superbly self-possessed. He asked himself questions and answered them  with a promptness which left no room for doubt in his mind as to what  his actions should be. One fact he accepted as absolute: Joanne  belonged to him. She was his wife. He regarded her as that, even though  Mortimer FitzHugh was alive. In the eyes of both God and man FitzHugh  no longer had a claim upon her. This man, who was known as Culver Rann,  was worse than Quade, a scoundrel of the first water, a procurer, a  blackmailer, even a murderer&#8212;though he had thus far succeeded in  evading the rather loose and poorly working tentacles of mountain law.
  Not for an instant did he think of Joanne as Culver Rann's wife. She  was<I> his</I> wife. It was merely a technicality of the law&#8212;a  technicality that Joanne might break with her little finger&#8212;that had  risen now between them and happiness. And it was this that he knew was  the mountain in his path, for he was certain that Joanne would not  break that last link of bondage. She would know, with Mortimer FitzHugh  alive, that the pledge between them in the &#8220;coyote,&#8221; and the marriage  ceremony in the room below, meant nothing. Legally, she was no more to  him now than she was yesterday, or the day before. And she would leave  him, even if it destroyed her, heart and soul. He was sure of that. For  years she had suffered her heart to be ground out of her because of the  &#8220;bit of madness&#8221; that was in her, because of that earlier tragedy in  her life&#8212;and her promise, her pledge to her father, her God, and  herself. Without arguing a possible change in her because of her love  for him, John Aldous accepted these things. He believed that if he told  Joanne the truth he would lose her.
  His determination not to tell her, to keep from her the secret of  the grave and the fact that Mortimer FitzHugh was alive, grew stronger  in him with each breath that he drew. He believed that it was the right  thing to do, that it was the honourable and the only thing to do. Now  that the first shock was over, he did not feel that he had lost Joanne,  or that there was a very great danger of losing her. For a moment it  occurred to him that he might turn the law upon Culver Rann, and in the  same breath he laughed at this absurdity. The law could not help him.  He alone could work out his own and Joanne's salvation. And what was to  happen must happen very soon&#8212;up in the mountains. When it was all  over, and he returned, he would tell Joanne.
  His heart beat more quickly as he finished dressing. In a few  minutes more he would be with Joanne, and in spite of what had  happened, and what might happen, he was happy. Yesterday he had  dreamed. To-day was reality&#8212;and it was a glorious reality. Joanne  belonged to him. She loved him. She was his wife, and when he went to  her it was with the feeling that only a serpent lay in the path of  their paradise&#8212;a serpent which he would crush with as little  compunction as that serpent would have destroyed her. Utterly and  remorselessly his mind was made up.
  The Blacktons' supper hour was five-thirty, and he was a quarter of  an hour late when he tapped at Joanne's door. He felt the warmth of a  strange and delightful embarrassment flushing his face as the door  opened, and she stood before him. In her face, too, was a telltale riot  of colour which the deep tan partly concealed in his own.
  &#8220;I&#8212;I am a little late, am I not, Joanne?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;You are, sir. If you have taken all this time dressing you are  worse than a woman. I have been waiting fifteen minutes!&#8221;
  &#8220;Old Donald came to see me,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;Joanne&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You mustn't, John!&#8221; she expostulated in a whisper. &#8220;My face is  afire now! You mustn't kiss me again&#8212;until after supper&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Only once,&#8221; he pleaded.
  &#8220;If you will promise&#8212;just once&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  A moment later she gasped:
  &#8220;Five times! John Aldous, I will never believe you again as long as  I live!&#8221;
  They went down to the Blacktons, and Peggy and Paul, who were busy  over some growing geraniums in the dining-room window, faced about with  a forced and incongruous appearance of total oblivion to everything  that had happened. It lasted less than ten seconds. Joanne's lips  quivered. Aldous saw the two little dimples at the corners of her mouth  fighting to keep themselves out of sight&#8212;and then he looked at Peggy.  Blackton could stand it no longer, and grinned broadly.
  &#8220;For goodness sake go to it, Peggy!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;If you don't  you'll explode!&#8221;
  The next moment Peggy and Joanne were in each other's arms, and the  two men were shaking hands.
  &#8220;We know just how you feel,&#8221; Blackton tried to explain. &#8220;We felt  just like you do, only we had to face twenty people instead of two. And  you're not hungry. I'll wager that. I'll bet you don't feel like  swallowing a mouthful. It had that peculiar effect on us, didn't it,  Peggy?&#8221;
  &#8220;And I&#8212;I almost choked myself,&#8221; gurgled Peggy as they took their  places at the table. &#8220;There really did seem to be something thick in my  throat, Joanne, dear. I coughed and coughed and coughed before all  those people until I wanted to die right there! And I'm wondering&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;If I'm going to choke, too?&#8221; smiled Joanne. &#8220;Indeed not, Peggy. I'm  as hungry as a bear!&#8221;
  And now she did look glorious and self-possessed to Aldous as she  sat opposite him at that small round table, which was just fitted for  four. He told her so when the meal was finished, and they were  following the Blacktons into the front room. Blackton had evidently  been carefully drilled along the line of a certain scheme which Peggy  had formed, for in spite of a negative nod from her, which signified  that he was to wait a while, he pulled out his watch, and said:
  &#8220;It isn't at all surprising if you people have forgotten that  to-morrow is Sunday. Peggy and I always do some Saturday-night  shopping, and if you don't mind, we'll leave you to care for the house  while we go to town. We won't be gone more than an hour.&#8221;
  A few minutes later, when the door had closed behind them, Aldous  led Joanne to a divan, and sat down beside her.
  &#8220;I couldn't have arranged it better myself, dear,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I  have been wondering how I could have you alone for a few minutes, and  tell you what is on my mind before I see MacDonald again to-night. I'm  afraid you will be displeased with me, Joanne. I hardly know how to  begin. But&#8212;I've got to.&#8221;
  A moment's uneasiness came into her eyes as she saw how seriously he  was speaking.
  &#8220;You don't mean, John&#8212;there's more about Quade&#8212;and Culver Rann?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, no&#8212;nothing like that,&#8221; he laughed, as though amused at the  absurdity of her question. &#8220;Old Donald tells me they have skipped the  country, Joanne. It's not that. It's you I'm thinking of, and what you  may think of me a minute from now. Joanne, I've given my word to old  Donald. He has lived in my promise. I've got to keep that promise&#8212;I  must go into the North with him.&#8221;
  She had drawn one of his hands into her lap and was fondling it with  her own soft palm and fingers.
  &#8220;Of course, you must, John. I love old Donald.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I must go&#8212;soon,&#8221; he added.
  &#8220;It is only fair to him that you should,&#8221; she agreed.
  &#8220;He&#8212;he is determined we shall go in the morning,&#8221; he finished,  keeping his eyes from her.
  For a moment Joanne did not answer. Her fingers interweaved with  his, her warm little palm stroked the rough back of his hand. Then she  said, very softly:
  &#8220;And why do you think that will displease me, John, dear? I will be  ready!&#8221;
  &#8220;You!&#8221;
  Her eyes were on him, full, and dark, and glowing, and in them were  both love and laughter.
  &#8220;You dear silly John!&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Why don't you come right out  and tell me to stay at home, instead of&#8212;of&#8212;'beating 'round the  bush'&#8212;as Peggy Blackton says? Only you don't know what a terrible  little person you've got, John. You really don't. So you needn't say  any more. We'll start in the morning&#8212;and I am going with you!&#8221;
  In a flash John Aldous saw his whole scheme shaking on its  foundation.
  &#8220;It's impossible&#8212;utterly impossible!&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;And why utterly?&#8221; she asked, bending her head so that her soft hair  touched his face and lips. &#8220;John, have you already forgotten what we  said in that terrible cavern&#8212;what we told ourselves we would have done  if we had lived? We were going adventuring, weren't we? And we are not  dead&#8212;but alive. And this will be a glorious trip! Why, John, don't you  see, don't you understand? It will be our honeymoon trip!&#8221;
  &#8220;It will be a long, rough journey,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;It will be  hard&#8212;hard for a woman.&#8221;
  With a little laugh, Joanne sprang up and stood before him in a glow  of light, tall, and slim, and splendid, and there was a sparkle of  beautiful defiance and a little of triumph in her eyes as she looked  down on him.
  &#8220;And it will be dangerous, too? You are going to tell me that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it will be dangerous.&#8221;
  She came to him and rumpled up his hair, and turned his face up so  that she could look into his eyes.
  &#8220;Is it worse than fever, and famine, and deep swamps, and crawling  jungles?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Are we going to encounter worse things than  beasts, and poisonous serpents, and murderous savages&#8212;even hunger and  thirst, John? For many years we dared those together&#8212;my father and I.  Are these great, big, beautiful mountains more treacherous than those  Ceylon jungles from which you ran away&#8212;even you, John? Are they more  terrible to live in than the Great African Desert? Are your bears worse  than tigers, your wolves more terrible than lions? And if, through  years and years, I faced those things with my father, do you suppose  that I want to be left behind now, and by my husband?&#8221;
  So sweet and wonderful was the sound of that name as it came softly  from her lips, that in his joy he forgot the part he was playing, and  drew her close down in his arms, and in that moment all that remained  of the scheme he had built for keeping her behind crumbled in ruin  about him.
  Yet in a last effort he persisted.
  &#8220;Old Donald wants to travel fast&#8212;very fast, Joanne. I owe a great  deal to him. Even you I owe to him&#8212;for he saved us from the 'coyote.'&#8220;
  &#8220;I am going, John.&#8221;
  &#8220;If we went alone we would be able to return very soon.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am going.&#8221;
  &#8220;And some of the mountains&#8212;it is impossible for a woman to climb  them!&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will let you carry me up them, John. You are so strong&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He groaned hopelessly.
  &#8220;Joanne, won't you stay with the Blacktons, to please me?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. I don't care to please you.&#8221;
  Her fingers were stroking his cheek.
  &#8220;John?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Father taught me to shoot, and as we get better acquainted on our  honeymoon trip I'll tell you about some of my hunting adventures. I  don't like to shoot wild things, because I love them too well. But I  can shoot. And I want a gun!&#8221;
  &#8220;Great Scott!&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a toy&#8212;but a real gun,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;A gun like yours. And  then, if by any chance we should have trouble&#8212;with Culver Rann&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  She felt him start, and her hands pressed harder against his face.
  &#8220;Now I know,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I guessed it all along. You told me  that Culver Rann and the others were after the gold. They've gone&#8212;and  their going isn't quite 'skipping the country' as you meant me to  understand it, John Aldous! So please let's not argue any more. If we  do we may quarrel, and that would be terrible. I'm going. And I will be  ready in the morning. And I want a gun. And I want you to be nice to  me, and I want it to be our honeymoon&#8212;even if it is going to be  exciting!&#8221;
  And with that she put her lips to his, and his last argument was  gone.
  Two hours later, when he went to the coulee, he was like one who had  come out of a strange and disturbing and altogether glorious dream. He  had told Joanne and the Blacktons that it was necessary for him to be  with MacDonald that night. Joanne's good-night kiss was still warm on  his lips, the loving touch of her hands still trembled on his face, and  the sweet perfume of her hair was in his nostrils. He was drunk with  the immeasurable happiness that had come to him, every fibre in him was  aquiver with it&#8212;and yet, possessed of his great joy, he was conscious  of a fear; a fear that was new and growing, and which made him glad  when he came at last to the little fire in the coulee.
  He did not tell MacDonald the cause of this fear at first. He told  the story of Mortimer FitzHugh and Joanne, leaving no part of it  unbared, until he could see Donald MacDonald's great gaunt hands  clenching in the firelight, and his cavernous eyes flaming darkly  through the gloom. Then he told what had happened when the Blacktons  went to town, and when he had finished, and rose despairingly beside  the fire, Donald rose, too, and his voice boomed in a sort of ecstasy.
  &#8220;My Jane would ha' done likewise,&#8221; he cried in triumph. &#8220;She would  that, Johnny&#8212;she would!&#8221;
  &#8220;But this is different!&#8221; groaned Aldous. &#8220;What am I going to do,  Mac? What can I do? Don't you see how impossible it is! Mac, Mac&#8212;she  isn't my wife&#8212;not entirely, not absolutely, not in the last and vital  sense of being a wife by law! If she knew the truth, she wouldn't  consider herself my wife; she would leave me. For that reason I can't  take her. I can't. Think what it would mean!&#8221;
  Old Donald had come close to his side, and at the look in the gray  old mountaineer's face John Aldous paused. Slowly Donald laid his hands  on his shoulders.
  &#8220;Johnny,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;Johnny, be you sure of yourself? Be you a  man, Johnny?&#8221;
  &#8220;Good heaven, Donald. You mean&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  Their eyes met steadily.
  &#8220;If you are, Johnny,&#8221; went on MacDonald in a low voice, &#8220;I'd take  her with me. An' if you ain't, I'd leave these mount'ins to-night an'  never look in her sweet face again as long as I lived.&#8221;
  &#8220;You'd take her along?&#8221; demanded Aldous eagerly.
  &#8220;I would. I've been thinkin' it over to-night. An' something seemed  to tell me we mustn't dare leave her here alone. There's just two  things to do, Johnny. You've got to stay with her an' let me go on  alone or&#8212;you've got to take her.&#8221;
  Slowly Aldous shook his head. He looked at his watch. It was a  little after ten.
  &#8220;If I could make myself believe that she would not be safe here&#8212;I  would take her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I can't quite make up my mind to that,  Mac. She will be in good hands with the Blacktons. I will warn Paul.  Joanne is determined to go, and I know she will think it pretty  indecent to be told emphatically that she can't go. But I've got to do  it. I can't see&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
