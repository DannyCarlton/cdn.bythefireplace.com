  A dozen steps beyond the door Philip paused in the shadow of a   dense spruce, half persuaded to return. From where he stood he  could  see Gregson bending over the table, already at work on the  picture. He  confessed that the sketch had startled him. He knew  that it had sent  the hot blood rushing to his face, and that only  through a fortunate  circumstance had Gregson ascribed its effect  upon him to something  that was wide of the truth. Miss Brokaw was  a thousand or more miles  away. At this moment she was somewhere in  the North Atlantic, if their  ship had left Halifax. She had never  been in the north. More than  that, he knew that Gregson had never  seen Miss Brokaw, and had heard  of her only through himself and  the society columns of the newspapers.  How could he explain his  possession of the sketch? 
  He drew a step or two nearer to the open door, and stopped again.   If he returned to question Gregson it would draw him perilously  near  to explanations which he did not care to make, to the one  secret which  he wished to guard from his friend's knowledge. After  all, the picture  was only a resemblance. It could be nothing but a  resemblance, even  though it was so striking and unusual that it  had thrown him off his  guard at first. When he returned later and  looked at it again he would  no doubt be able to see his error. 
  He walked on through the spruce shadows and up a narrow trail that   led to the bald knob of the ridge, feeling his way with his right   hand before him when the denseness of the forest shut out the  light  of the stars and the moon, until at last he stood out strong  and clear  under the glow of the skies, with the world sweeping out  in black and  gray mystery around him. To the north was the Bay,  reaching away like  a vast black plain. Half a mile distant two or  three lights were  burning over Fort Churchill, red eyes peering up  out of the deep pool  of darkness; to the south and west there  swept the gray, starlit  distances which lay between him and  civilization. 
  He leaned against a great rock, resting his elbows in a carpet of   moss, and his eyes turned into the mystery of those distances. The   sea of spruce-tops that rose out of the ragged valley at his feet   whispered softly in the night wind; from out of their depths  trembled  the low hoot of an owl; over the vaster desolation beyond  hovered a  weird and unbroken silence. More than once the spirit of  this world  had come to him in the night and had roused him from  his slumber to  sit alone out under the stars, imagining all that  it might tell him if  he could read the voice of it in the  whispering of the trees, if he  could but understand it as he  longed to understand it, and could find  in it the peace which he  knew that it all but held for him. The spirit  of it had never been  nearer to him than to-night. He felt it close to  him, so near that  it seemed like the warm, vibrant touch of a presence  at his side,  something which had come to him in a voiceless loneliness  as great  as his own, watching and listening with him beside the rock.  It  seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson. It   was much nearer to him since a few minutes ago, when he had looked   upon what he had first thought to be the face of Eileen Brokaw. 
  And this was the world&#8212;the spirit&#8212;that had changed him. He   wondered if Gregson had seen the change which he tried so hard to   conceal. He wondered if Miss Brokaw would see it when she came,  and  if her soft, gray eyes would read to the bottom of him as they  had  fathomed him once before upon a time which seemed years and  years ago.  Thoughts like these troubled him. Twice that day he had  found stealing  over him a feeling that was almost physical pain,  and yet he knew that  this pain was but the gnawing of a great  loneliness in his heart. In  these moments he had been sorry that  he had brought Gregson back into  his life. And with Gregson he was  bringing back Eileen Brokaw. He was  more than sorry for that. The  thought of it made him grow warm and  uncomfortable, though the  night air from off the Bay was filled with  the chill tang of the  northern icebergs. Again his thoughts brought  him face to face  with the old pictures, the old life. With them came  haunting  memories of a Philip Whittemore who had once lived, and who  had  died; and with these ghosts of the past there surged upon him the   loneliness which seemed to crush and stifle him. Like one in a  dream  he was swept back. Over the black spruce at his feet, far  into the  gray, misty distances beyond, over forests and mountains  and the vast,  grim silences his vision reached out until he saw  life as it had begun  for him, and as he had lived it for a time.  It had opened fair. It had  given promise. It had filled him with  hope and ambition. And then it  had changed. 
  Unconsciously he clenched his hands as he thought of what had   followed, of the black days of ruin, of death, of the dissolution  of  all that he had hoped and dreamed for. He had fought, because  he was  born a fighter. He had risen again and again, only to find  misfortune  still at his face. At first he had laughed, and had  called it bad  luck. But the bad luck had followed him, dogging him  with a  persistence which developed in him a new perspective of  things. He  dropped away from his clubs. He began to measure men  and women as he  had not measured them before, and there grew in  him slowly a revulsion  for what those measurements revealed. The  spirit that was growing in  him called out for bigger things, for  the wild freedom which he had  tasted for a time with Gregson&#8212;for  a life which was not warped by the  gilded amenities of the crowded  ballroom to-night, by the frenzied  dollar-fight to-morrow. No one  could understand that change in him. He  could find no spirit in  sympathy with him, no chord in another breast  that he could reach  out and touch and thrill with understanding. Once  he had hoped&#8212;  and tried&#8212; 
  A deep breath, almost a sigh, fell from his lips as he thought of   that last night, at the Brokaw ball. He heard again the laughter  and  chatter of men and women, the soft rustle of skirts&#8212;and then  the  break, the silence, as the low, sweet music of his favorite  waltz  began, while he stood screened behind a bank of palms  looking down  into the clear gray eyes of Eileen Brokaw. He saw  himself as he had  stood then, leaning over her slim white  shoulders, intoxicated by her  beauty, his face pale with the fear  of what he was about to say; and  he saw the girl, with her  beautiful head thrown a little back, so that  her golden hair  almost touched his lips, waiting for him to speak. For  months he  had fought against the fascination of her beauty. Again and  again  he had almost surrendered to it, only to pull himself back in   time. He had seen this girl, as pure-looking as an angel, strike   deeply at the hearts of other men; he had heard her laugh and talk   lightly of the wounds she had made. Behind the eyes which gazed up  at  him, dear and sweet as pools of sunlit water, he knew there lay  the  consuming passion for power, for admiration, for the froth-  like  pleasures of the life that was swirling about them. Sincerity  was but  their mask. He knew that the beautiful gray eyes lied to  him when he  saw in them all that he held glorious in womanhood. 
  He laughed softly to himself as the picture grew in his mind, and   he saw Ransom come blundering in through the palms, mopping his  red  face and chattering inane things to little Miss Meesen. Ransom  was  always blundering. This time his blunder saved Philip. The  passionate  words died on his lips; and when Ransom and Miss Meesen  turned about  in a giggling flutter, he spoke no words of love, but  opened up his  heart to this girl whom he would have loved if she  had been like her  eyes. It was his last hope&#8212;that she would  understand him, see with  him the emptiness of his life, sympathize  with him. 
  And she had laughed at him! 
  She had risen to her feet; there had come for an instant a flash   like that of fire in her eyes; her voice trembled a little when  she  spoke. There was resentment in the poise of her white  shoulders as  Ransom's voice came to them in a loud laugh from  behind the palms; her  red lips showed disdain and anger. She hated  Ransom for breaking in;  she despised Philip for allowing the  interruption to tear away her  triumph. Her own betrayal of herself  was like tonic to Philip. He  laughed joyously when he was alone  out in the cool night air. Ransom  never knew why Philip hunted him  out and shook his fat hand so warmly  at parting. 
  Philip again felt himself in the fever of that night as he turned   from the rock and began picking his way down the side of the ridge   toward the Bay. He found himself wondering what had become of   good-natured, dense-headed Ransom, who had all he could do to  spend  his father's allowance. From Ransom his thoughts turned to  little  Harry Dell, Roscoe, big Dan Philips, and three or four  others who had  sacrificed their hearts at Miss Brokaw's feet. He  grimaced as he  thought of young Dell, who had worshiped the ground  she walked on, and  who had gone straight to the devil when she  threw him over. He  wondered, too, where Roscoe was. He knew that  Roscoe would have won  out if it had not been for the financial  crash which took his  brokerage firm off its feet and left him a  pauper. He had heard that  Roscoe had gone up into British Columbia  to recuperate his fortune in  Douglas fir. As for big Dan&#8212; 
  Philip stumbled over a rock, and rose with a bruised knee. The   shock brought him back to realities, and a few moments later he  stood  upon the narrow boulder-strewn beach, rubbing his knee and  calling  himself a fool for allowing the old thoughts to stir him  up. Out  there, somewhere, Brokaw and his daughter were coming.  That Miss  Brokaw was with her father was a circumstance which was  of no  importance to him. At least he told himself so, and set his  face  toward Churchill. 
  To-night the stars and the moon seemed to be more than usually   brilliant. About him the great masses of rock, the tumbling surf,  the  edge of the forest, and the Bay itself were illumined as if by  the  light of a softly radiant day. He looked at his watch and  found that  it was past midnight. He had been up since dawn, and  yet he felt no  touch of fatigue, no need of sleep. He took off his  cap and walked  bareheaded in the mellow light, his moccasined feet  falling lightly,  his eyes alert to all that this wonderful night  world might hold for  him. Ahead of him rose a giant mass of rock,  worn smooth and slippery  by the water dashed against it in the  crashing storms of countless  centuries, and this he climbed,  panting when he reached the top. His  eyes turned to where he saw  Fort Churchill sleeping along the edge of  the Bay. 
  In that same spot, a great pool of night-glow between two forest-   crowned ridges, it had lain for hundreds of years. He passed the   ancient landing-place of rocks, built a hundred and fifty years  ago  for the first ships that came over the strange sea; he stood  upon the  tumbled foundations of the Fort, that was still older,  and saw the  starlight glinting on one of the brass cannon that lay  where it had  fallen amid the debris, untouched and unmoved since  the days,  ages-gone, when it had last thundered its welcome or its  defiance  through the solitudes; he walked slowly along the shore  where the sea  had lashed wearily for many a year, to reach the  wilderness dead, and  where now, triumphant, the frothing surf  bared gun-case coffins and  tumbled the bones of men down into its  sullen depths. And such men!  Men who had lived and died when the  world was unborn in a half of its  knowledge and science, when red  blood was the great capital, strong  hearts the winners of life.  And there were women, too, women who had  come with these men, and  died with them, in the opening-up of a new  world. It was such men  as these, and such women as these, that Philip  loved, and he  walked with bared head and swiftly beating heart over  the unmarked  jungle of the dead. 
  And then he came to other things, the first low log buildings of   Churchill, to the silence of sleeping life. New buildings loomed   up&#8212;working quarters of men who were grubbing for dollars, the new   wharves, the skeletons of elevators, sullen, windowless  warehouses,  the office-buildings of men who were already fighting  and quarreling  and gripping at one another's throats in the  struggle for supremacy,  for the biggest and ripest plums in this  new land of opportunity. The  dollar-fight had begun, and the  things that already marked its  presence loomed monstrous and  grotesque to Philip, as if jeering at  the forgotten efforts of  those whom the sea was washing away. And  suddenly it struck Philip  that the sea, working ceaselessly, digging  away at its dead, was  not the enemy of the nameless creatures in the  gun-case coffins,  but that it was a friend, stanch through centuries,  rescuing them  now from the desecration that was to come; and for a  moment he was  resistless to the spirit that moved him about and made  him face  that sea with something that was almost a prayer in his  heart. 
  As he turned he saw that a light had appeared in one of the low   log buildings which contained the two offices of the Keewatin  Mines  and Lands Company. The light, and the bulky shadow of old  Pearce,  which appeared for a moment on one of the drawn curtains,  aroused  Philip to other thoughts. Since his arrival at Churchill  he had made  the acquaintance of Pearce, and it struck him now that  just such a man  as this might be Lord Fitzhugh Lee. The Keewatin  Mines and Lands  Company had no mines and few lands, and yet Pearce  had told him that  they were doing a hustling business down south,  selling stock on  mineral claims that couldn't be worked for years.  After all, was he  any better than Pearce? 
  The old bitterness rose in him. He was no better than Pearce, no   better than this Lord Fitzhugh himself, and it was fate&#8212;fate and   people, that had made him so. He walked swiftly now, following  close  along the shore in the hard stretch kept bare by the tides,  until he  came to the red coals of half a dozen Indian fires on the  edge of the  forest beyond the company's buildings. A dog scented  him and howled.  He heard a guttural voice break in a word of  command from one of the  tepees, and there was silence again. 
  He turned to the right, burying himself deeper and deeper into the   great silence of the north, his quick steps keeping pace with the   thoughts that were passing through his brain. Fate, bad luck,   circumstance&#8212;they had been against him. He had told himself this  a  hundred times, had laughed at them with the confidence of one  who knew  that some day he would rise above these things in  triumph. And yet  what were these elements of fortune, as he had  called them, but  people? A feeling of personal resentment began to  oppress him. People  had downed him, and not circumstance and bad  luck. Men and women had  made a failure of him, and not fate. For  the first time it occurred to  him that the very men and women whom  Brokaw and his associates had  duped, whom Pearce was duping, would  play the game in the same way if  they had the opportunity. What if  he had played on the winning side,  if he had enlisted his fighting  energies with men like Brokaw and  Pearce, fought for money and  power in place of this other thing, which  seemed to count so  little? Other men would have given much to have  been in his favor  with Eileen Brokaw. He might have been in the front  of this other  fight, the winning fight, the possessor of fortune, a  beautiful  woman&#8212; 
  He stopped suddenly. It seemed to him that he had heard a voice.   He had climbed from out of the shadow of the forest until he stood   now on a gray cliff of rock that reached out into the Bay, like  the  point of a great knife guarding Churchill. A block of  sandstone rose  in his path, and he passed quietly around it. In  another instant he  had flattened himself against it. 
  A dozen feet away, full in the moonlight, three figures sat on the   edge of the cliff, as motionless as though hewn out of rock.   Instinctively Philip's hand slipped to his revolver holster, but  he  drew it back when he saw that one of the three figures was that  of a  woman. Beside her crouched a huge wolf-dog; on the other side  of the  dog sat a man. The man was resting in the attitude of an  Indian, with  his elbows on his knees, his chin in the palms of his  hands, gazing  steadily and silently out over the Bay toward  Churchill. 
  It was his companion that held Philip motionless against the face   of the rock. She, too, was leaning forward, gazing in that same   steady, silent way toward Churchill. She was bareheaded. Her hair   fell loose over her shoulders and streamed down her back until it   piled itself upon the rock, shining dark and lustrous in the light  of  the moon. Philip knew that she was not an Indian. 
  Suddenly the girl sat erect, and then sprang to her feet, partly   facing him, the breeze rippling her hair about her face and   shoulders, her eyes turned to the vast gray depths of the world   beyond the forests. For an instant she turned so that the light of   the moon fell full upon her, and in that moment Philip thought  that  her eyes had searched him out in the shadow of the rock and  were  looking straight into his own. Never had he seen such a  beautiful face  among the forest people. He had dreamed of such  faces beside  camp-fires, in the deep loneliness of long nights in  the forests, when  he had awakened to bring before him visions of  what Eileen Brokaw  might have been to him if he had found her one  of these people. He  drew himself closer to the rock. The girl  turned again to the edge of  the cliff, her slender form  silhouetted against the starlit sky. She  leaned over the dog, and  he heard her voice, soft and caressing, but  he could not  understand her words. The man lifted his head, and he  recognized  the swarthy, clear-cut features of a French half-breed. He  moved  away as quietly as he had come. 
  The girl's voice stopped him. 
  &quot;And that is Churchill, Pierre&#8212;the Churchill you have told me of,   where the ships come in?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, that is Churchill, Jeanne.&quot; 
  For a moment there was silence. Then, clear and low, with a wild,   sobbing note in her voice that thrilled Philip, the girl cried: 
  &quot;And I hate it, Pierre. I hate it&#8212;hate it&#8212;hate it!&quot; 
  Philip stepped out boldly from the rock. 
  &quot;And I hate it, too,&quot; he said.
