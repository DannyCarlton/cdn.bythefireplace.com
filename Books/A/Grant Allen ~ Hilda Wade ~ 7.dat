I have a vast respect for my grandfather. He was a man of  forethought. He left me a modest little income of seven hundred  a-year, well invested. Now, seven hundred a-year is not exactly  wealth; but it is an unobtrusive competence; it permits a bachelor  to move about the world and choose at will his own profession.  <i>I</i> chose medicine; but I was not wholly dependent upon it. So I  honoured my grandfather's wise disposition of his worldly goods;  though, oddly enough, my cousin Tom (to whom he left his watch and  five hundred pounds) speaks <i>most</i> disrespectfully of his character  and intellect.    
Thanks to my grandfather's silken-sailed barque, therefore, when I  found myself practically dismissed from Nathaniel's I was not  thrown on my beam-ends, as most young men in my position would have  been; I had time and opportunity for the favourite pastime of  looking about me. Of course, had I chosen, I might have fought the  case to the bitter end against Sebastian; he could not dismiss me--  that lay with the committee. But I hardly cared to fight. In the  first place, though I had found him out as a man, I still respected  him as a great teacher; and in the second place (which is always  more important), I wanted to find and follow Hilda.    
To be sure, Hilda, in that enigmatic letter of hers, had implored  me not to seek her out; but I think you will admit there is one  request which no man can grant to the girl he loves--and that is  the request to keep away from her. If Hilda did not want <i>me</i>, I  wanted Hilda; and, being a man, I meant to find her.    
My chances of discovering her whereabouts, however, I had to  confess to myself (when it came to the point) were extremely  slender. She had vanished from my horizon, melted into space. My  sole hint of a clue consisted in the fact that the letter she sent  me had been posted at Basingstoke. Here, then, was my problem:  given an envelope with the Basingstoke postmark, to find in what  part of Europe, Asia, Africa, or America the writer of it might be  discovered. It opened up a fine field for speculation.    
When I set out to face this broad puzzle, my first idea was: "I  must ask Hilda." In all circumstances of difficulty, I had grown  accustomed to submitting my doubts and surmises to her acute  intelligence; and her instinct almost always supplied the right  solution. But now Hilda was gone; it was Hilda herself I wished to  track through the labyrinth of the world. I could expect no  assistance in tracking her from Hilda.    
"Let me think," I said to myself, over a reflective pipe, with feet  poised on the fender. "How would Hilda herself have approached  this problem? Imagine I'm Hilda. I must try to strike a trail by  applying her own methods to her own character. She would have  attacked the question, no doubt,"--here I eyed my pipe wisely,--  "from the psychological side. She would have asked herself"--I  stroked my chin--"what such a temperament as hers was likely to do  under such-and-such circumstances. And she would have answered it  aright. But then"--I puffed away once or twice--"<i>she</i> is Hilda."    
When I came to reconnoitre the matter in this light, I became at  once aware how great a gulf separated the clumsy male intelligence  from the immediate and almost unerring intuitions of a clever  woman. I am considered no fool; in my own profession, I may  venture to say, I was Sebastian's favourite pupil. Yet, though I  asked myself over and over again where Hilda would be likely to go--  Canada, China, Australia--as the outcome of her character, in  these given conditions, I got no answer. I stared at the fire and  reflected. I smoked two successive pipes, and shook out the ashes.  "Let me consider how Hilda's temperament would work," I said,  looking sagacious. I said it several times--but there I stuck. I  went no further. The solution would not come. I felt that in  order to play Hilda's part, it was necessary first to have Hilda's  head-piece. Not every man can bend the bow of Ulysses.    
As I turned the problem over in my mind, however, one phrase at  last came back to me--a phrase which Hilda herself had let fall  when we were debating a very similar point about poor Hugo Le Geyt:  "If I were in his place, what do you think I would do?--why, hide  myself at once in the greenest recesses of our Carnarvonshire  mountains."    
She must have gone to Wales, then. I had her own authority for  saying so. . . . And yet--Wales? Wales? I pulled myself up with  a jerk. In that case, how did she come to be passing by  Basingstoke?    
Was the postmark a blind? Had she hired someone to take the letter  somewhere for her, on purpose to put me off on a false track? I  could hardly think so. Besides, the time was against it. I saw  Hilda at Nathaniel's in the morning; the very same evening I  received the envelope with the Basingstoke postmark.    
"If I were in his place." Yes, true; but, now I come to think on  it, <i>were</i> the positions really parallel? Hilda was not flying for  her life from justice; she was only endeavouring to escape  Sebastian--and myself. The instances she had quoted of the  mountaineer's curious homing instinct--the wild yearning he feels  at moments of great straits to bury himself among the nooks of his  native hills--were they not all instances of murderers pursued by  the police? It was abject terror that drove these men to their  burrows. But Hilda was not a murderer; she was not dogged by  remorse, despair, or the myrmidons of the law; it was murder she  was avoiding, not the punishment of murder. That made, of course,  an obvious difference. "Irrevocably far from London," she said.  Wales is a suburb. I gave up the idea that it was likely to prove  her place of refuge from the two men she was bent on escaping.  Hong-Kong, after all, seemed more probable than Llanberis.    
That first failure gave me a clue, however, as to the best way of  applying Hilda's own methods. "What would such a person do under  the circumstances?" that was her way of putting the question.  Clearly, then, I must first decide what <i>were</i> the circumstances.  Was Sebastian speaking the truth? Was Hilda Wade, or was she not,  the daughter of the supposed murderer, Dr. Yorke-Bannerman?    
I looked up as much of the case as I could, in unobtrusive ways,  among the old law-reports, and found that the barrister who had had  charge of the defence was my father's old friend, Mr. Horace  Mayfield, a man of elegant tastes, and the means to gratify them.    
I went to call on him on Sunday evening at his artistically  luxurious house in Onslow Gardens. A sedate footman answered the  bell. Fortunately, Mr. Mayfield was at home, and, what is rarer,  disengaged. You do not always find a successful Q.C. at his ease  among his books, beneath the electric light, ready to give up a  vacant hour to friendly colloquy.    
"Remember Yorke-Bannerman's case?" he said, a huge smile breaking  slowly like a wave over his genial fat face--Horace Mayfield  resembles a great good-humoured toad, with bland manners and a  capacious double chin--"I should just say I <i>did</i>! Bless my soul--  why, yes," he beamed, "I was Yorke-Bannerman's counsel. Excellent  fellow, Yorke-Bannerman--most unfortunate end, though--precious  clever chap, too! Had an astounding memory. Recollected every  symptom of every patient he ever attended. And <i>such</i> an eye!  Diagnosis? It was clairvoyance! A gift--no less. Knew what was  the matter with you the moment he looked at you."    
That sounded like Hilda. The same surprising power of recalling  facts; the same keen faculty for interpreting character or the  signs of feeling. "He poisoned somebody, I believe," I murmured,  casually. "An uncle of his, or something."    
Mayfield's great squat face wrinkled; the double chin, folding down  on the neck, became more ostentatiously double than ever. "Well, I  can't admit that," he said, in his suave voice, twirling the string  of his eye-glass. "I was Yorke-Bannerman's advocate, you see; and  therefore I was paid not to admit it. Besides, he was a friend of  mine, and I always liked him. But I <i>will</i> allow that the case <i>did</i>  look a trifle black against him."    
"Ha? Looked black, did it?" I faltered.    
The judicious barrister shrugged his shoulders. A genial smile  spread oilily once more over his smooth face. "None of my business  to say so," he answered, puckering the corners of his eyes.  "Still, it was a long time ago; and the circumstances certainly  <i>were</i> suspicious. Perhaps, on the whole, Hubert, it was just as  well the poor fellow died before the trial came off; otherwise"--he  pouted his lips--"I might have had my work cut out to save him."  And he eyed the blue china gods on the mantelpiece affectionately.    
"I believe the Crown urged money as the motive?" I suggested.    
Mayfield glanced inquiry at me. "Now, why do you want to know all  this?" he asked, in a suspicious voice, coming back from his  dragons. "It is irregular, very, to worm information out of an  innocent barrister in his hours of ease about a former client. We  are a guileless race, we lawyers; don't abuse our confidence."    
He seemed an honest man, I thought, in spite of his mocking tone.  I trusted him, and made a clean breast of it. "I believe," I  answered, with an impressive little pause, "I want to marry Yorke-  Bannerman's daughter."    
He gave a quick start. "What, Maisie?" he exclaimed.    
I shook my head. "No, no; that is not the name," I replied.    
He hesitated a moment. "But there <i>is</i> no other," he hazarded  cautiously at last. "I knew the family."    
"I am not sure of it," I went on. "I have merely my suspicions. I  am in love with a girl, and something about her makes me think she  is probably a Yorke-Bannerman."    
"But, my dear Hubert, if that is so," the great lawyer went on,  waving me off with one fat hand, "it must be at once apparent to  you that <i>I</i> am the last person on earth to whom you ought to apply  for information. Remember my oath. The practice of our clan: the  seal of secrecy!"    
I was frank once more. "I do not know whether the lady I mean is  or is not Yorke-Bannerman's daughter," I persisted. "She may be,  and she may not. She gives another name--that's certain. But  whether she is or isn't, one thing I know--I mean to marry her. I  believe in her; I trust her. I only seek to gain this information  now because I don't know where she is--and I want to track her."    
He crossed his big hands with an air of Christian resignation, and  looked up at the panels of the coffered ceiling. "In that," he  answered, "I may honestly say, I can't help you. Humbug apart, I  have not known Mrs. Yorke-Bannerman's address--or Maisie's either--  ever since my poor friend's death. Prudent woman, Mrs. Yorke-  Bannerman! She went away, I believe, to somewhere in North Wales,  and afterwards to Brittany. But she probably changed her name;  and--she did not confide in me."    
I went on to ask him a few questions about the case, premising that  I did so in the most friendly spirit. "Oh, I can only tell you  what is publicly known," he answered, beaming, with the usual  professional pretence of the most sphinx-like reticence. "But the  plain facts, as universally admitted, were these. I break no  confidence. Yorke-Bannerman had a rich uncle from whom he had  expectations--a certain Admiral Scott Prideaux. This uncle had  lately made a will in Yorke-Bannerman's favour; but he was a  cantankerous old chap--naval, you know--autocratic--crusty--given  to changing his mind with each change of the wind, and easily  offended by his relations--the sort of cheerful old party who makes  a new will once every month, disinheriting the nephew he last dined  with. Well, one day the Admiral was taken ill, at his own house,  and Yorke-Bannerman attended him. <i>Our</i> contention was--I speak now  as my old friend's counsel--that Scott Prideaux, getting as tired  of life as we were all tired of him, and weary of this recurrent  worry of will-making, determined at last to clear out for good from  a world where he was so little appreciated, and, therefore, tried  to poison himself."    
"With aconitine?" I suggested, eagerly.    
"Unfortunately, yes; he made use of aconitine for that otherwise  laudable purpose. Now, as ill luck would have it"--Mayfield's  wrinkles deepened--"Yorke-Bannerman and Sebastian, then two rising  doctors engaged in physiological researches together, had just been  occupied in experimenting upon this very drug--testing the use of  aconitine. Indeed, you will no doubt remember"--he crossed his fat  hands again comfortably--"it was these precise researches on a then  little-known poison that first brought Sebastian prominently before  the public. What was the consequence?" His smooth, persuasive  voice flowed on as if I were a concentrated jury. "The Admiral  grew rapidly worse, and insisted upon calling in a second opinion.  No doubt he didn't like the aconitine when it came to the pinch--  for it <i>does</i> pinch, I can tell you--and repented him of his evil.  Yorke-Bannerman suggested Sebastian as the second opinion; the  uncle acquiesced; Sebastian was called in, and, of course, being  fresh from his researches, immediately recognised the symptoms of  aconitine poisoning."    
"What! Sebastian found it out?" I cried, starting.    
"Oh, yes! Sebastian. He watched the case from that point to the  end; and the oddest part of it all was this--that though he  communicated with the police, and himself prepared every morsel of  food that the poor old Admiral took from that moment forth, the  symptoms continually increased in severity. The police contention  was that Yorke-Bannerman somehow managed to put the stuff into the  milk beforehand; my own theory was--as counsel for the accused"--he  blinked his fat eyes--"that old Prideaux had concealed a large  quantity of aconitine in the bed, before his illness, and went on  taking it from time to time--just to spite his nephew."    
"And you <i>believe</i> that, Mr. Mayfield?"    
The broad smile broke concentrically in ripples over the great  lawyer's face. His smile was Mayfield's main feature. He shrugged  his shoulders and expanded his big hands wide open before him.  "My dear Hubert," he said, with a most humorous expression of  countenance, "you are a professional man yourself; therefore you  know that every profession has its own little courtesies--its own  small fictions. I was Yorke-Bannerman's counsel, as well as his  friend. 'Tis a point of honour with us that no barrister will ever  admit a doubt as to a client's innocence--is he not paid to  maintain it?--and to my dying day I will constantly maintain that  old Prideaux poisoned himself. Maintain it with that dogged and  meaningless obstinacy with which we always cling to whatever is  least provable. . . . Oh, yes! He poisoned himself; and Yorke-  Bannerman was innocent. . . . But still, you know, it <i>was</i> the sort  of case where an acute lawyer, with a reputation to make, would  prefer to be for the Crown rather than for the prisoner."    
"But it was never tried," I ejaculated.    
"No, happily for us, it was never tried. Fortune favoured us.  Yorke-Bannerman had a weak heart, a conveniently weak heart, which  the inquest sorely affected; and besides, he was deeply angry at  what he persisted in calling Sebastian's defection. He evidently  thought Sebastian ought to have stood by him. His colleague  preferred the claims of public duty--as he understood them, I mean--  to those of private friendship. It was a very sad case--for  Yorke-Bannerman was really a charming fellow. But I confess I <i>was</i>  relieved when he died unexpectedly on the morning of his arrest.  It took off my shoulders a most serious burden."    
"You think, then, the case would have gone against him?"    
"My dear Hubert," his whole face puckered with an indulgent smile,  "of course the case must have gone against us. Juries are fools;  but they are not such fools as to swallow everything--like  ostriches: to let me throw dust in their eyes about so plain an  issue. Consider the facts, consider them impartially. Yorke-  Bannerman had easy access to aconitine; had whole ounces of it in  his possession; he treated the uncle from whom he was to inherit;  he was in temporary embarrassments--that came out at the inquest;  it was known that the Admiral had just made a twenty-third will in  his favour, and that the Admiral's wills were liable to alteration  every time a nephew ventured upon an opinion in politics, religion,  science, navigation, or the right card at whist, differing by a  shade from that of the uncle. The Admiral died of aconitine  poisoning; and Sebastian observed and detailed the symptoms. Could  anything be plainer--I mean, could any combination of fortuitous  circumstances"--he blinked pleasantly again--"be more adverse to an  advocate sincerely convinced of his client's innocence--as a  professional duty?" And he gazed at me comically.    
The more he piled up the case against the man who I now felt sure  was Hilda's father, the less did I believe him. A dark conspiracy  seemed to loom up in the background. "Has it ever occurred to  you," I asked, at last, in a very tentative tone, "that perhaps--I  throw out the hint as the merest suggestion--perhaps it may have  been Sebastian who--"    
He smiled this time till I thought his smile would swallow him.    
"If Yorke-Bannerman had <i>not</i> been my client," he mused aloud, "I  might have been inclined to suspect rather that Sebastian aided him  to avoid justice by giving him something violent to take, if he  wished it: something which might accelerate the inevitable action  of the heart-disease from which he was suffering. Isn't <i>that</i> more  likely?"    
I saw there was nothing further to be got out of Mayfield. His  opinion was fixed; he was a placid ruminant. But he had given me  already much food for thought. I thanked him for his assistance,  and returned on foot to my rooms at the hospital.    
I was now, however, in a somewhat different position for tracking  Hilda from that which I occupied before my interview with the  famous counsel. I felt certain by this time that Hilda Wade and  Maisie Yorke-Bannerman were one and the same person. To be sure,  it gave me a twinge to think that Hilda should be masquerading  under an assumed name; but I waived that question for the moment,  and awaited her explanations. The great point now was to find  Hilda. She was flying from Sebastian to mature a new plan. But  whither? I proceeded to argue it out on her own principles; oh,  how lamely! The world is still so big! Mauritius, the Argentine,  British Columbia, New Zealand!    
The letter I had received bore the Basingstoke postmark. Now a  person may be passing Basingstoke on his way either to Southampton  or Plymouth, both of which are ports of embarcation for various  foreign countries. I attached importance to that clue. Something  about the tone of Hilda's letter made me realise that she intended  to put the sea between us. In concluding so much, I felt sure I  was not mistaken. Hilda had too big and too cosmopolitan a mind to  speak of being "irrevocably far from London," if she were only  going to some town in England, or even to Normandy, or the Channel  Islands. "Irrevocably far" pointed rather to a destination outside  Europe altogether--to India, Africa, America: not to Jersey,  Dieppe, or Saint-Malo.    
Was it Southampton or Plymouth to which she was first bound?--that  was the next question. I inclined to Southampton. For the  sprawling lines (so different from her usual neat hand) were  written hurriedly in a train, I could see; and, on consulting  Bradshaw, I found that the Plymouth expresses stop longest at  Salisbury, where Hilda would, therefore, have been likely to post  her note if she were going to the far west; while some of the  Southampton trains stop at Basingstoke, which is, indeed, the most  convenient point on that route for sending off a letter. This was  mere blind guesswork, to be sure, compared with Hilda's immediate  and unerring intuition; but it had some probability in its favour,  at any rate. Try both: of the two, she was likelier to be going to  Southampton.    
My next move was to consult the list of outgoing steamers. Hilda  had left London on a Saturday morning. Now, on alternate  Saturdays, the steamers of the Castle line sail from Southampton,  where they call to take up passengers and mails. Was this one of  those alternate Saturdays? I looked at the list of dates: it was.  That told further in favour of Southampton. But did any steamer of  any passenger line sail from Plymouth on the same day? None, that  I could find. Or from Southampton elsewhere? I looked them all  up. The Royal Mail Company's boats start on Wednesdays; the North  German Lloyd's on Wednesdays and Sundays. Those were the only  likely vessels I could discover. Either, then, I concluded, Hilda  meant to sail on Saturday by the Castle line for South Africa, or  else on Sunday by North German Lloyd for some part of America.    
How I longed for one hour of Hilda to help me out with her almost  infallible instinct. I realised how feeble and fallacious was my  own groping in the dark. Her knowledge of temperament would have  revealed to her at once what I was trying to discover, like the  police she despised, by the clumsy "clues" which so roused her  sarcasm.    
However, I went to bed and slept on it. Next morning I determined  to set out for Southampton on a tour of inquiry to all the  steamboat agencies. If that failed, I could go on to Plymouth.    
But, as chance would have it, the morning post brought me an  unexpected letter, which helped me not a little in unravelling the  problem. It was a crumpled letter, written on rather soiled paper,  in an uneducated hand, and it bore, like Hilda's, the Basingstoke  postmark.    
"Charlotte Churtwood sends her duty to Dr. Cumberledge," it said,  with somewhat uncertain spelling, "and I am very sorry that I was  not able to Post the letter to you in London, as the lady ast me,  but after her train ad left has I was stepping into mine the Ingine  started and I was knocked down and badly hurt and the lady gave me  a half-sovering to Post it in London has soon as I got there but  bein unable to do so I now return it dear sir not knowing the  lady's name and adress she having trusted me through seeing me on  the platform, and perhaps you can send it back to her, and was very  sorry I could not Post it were she ast me, but time bein an objeck  put it in the box in Basingstoke station and now inclose post  office order for ten Shillings whitch dear sir kindly let the young  lady have from your obedient servant,    
"CHARLOTTE CHURTWOOD."    
In the corner was the address: "11, Chubb's Cottages, Basingstoke."    
The happy accident of this letter advanced things for me greatly--  though it also made me feel how dependent I was upon happy  accidents, where Hilda would have guessed right at once by mere  knowledge of character. Still, the letter explained many things  which had hitherto puzzled me. I had felt not a little surprise  that Hilda, wishing to withdraw from me and leave no traces, should  have sent off her farewell letter from Basingstoke--so as to let me  see at once in what direction she was travelling. Nay, I even  wondered at times whether she had really posted it herself at  Basingstoke, or given it to somebody who chanced to be going there  to post for her as a blind. But I did not think she would  deliberately deceive me; and, in my opinion, to get a letter posted  at Basingstoke would be deliberate deception, while to get it  posted in London was mere vague precaution. I understood now that  she had written it in the train, and then picked out a likely  person as she passed to take it to Waterloo for her.    
Of course, I went straight down to Basingstoke, and called at once  at Chubb's Cottages. It was a squalid little row on the outskirts  of the town. I found Charlotte Churtwood herself exactly such a  girl as Hilda, with her quick judgment of character, might have hit  upon for such a purpose. She was a conspicuously honest and  transparent country servant, of the lumpy type, on her way to  London to take a place as housemaid. Her injuries were severe, but  not dangerous. "The lady saw me on the platform," she said, "and  beckoned to me to come to her. She ast me where I was going, and I  says, 'To London, miss.' Says she, smiling kind-like, 'Could you  post a letter for me, certain sure?' Says I, 'You can depend upon  me.' An' then she give me the arf-sovering, an' says, says she,  'Mind, it's <i>very</i> par-tickler; if the gentleman don't get it, 'e'll  fret 'is 'eart out.' An' through 'aving a young man o' my own, as  is a groom at Andover, o' course I understood 'er, sir. An' then,  feeling all full of it, as yu may say, what with the arf-sovering,  and what with one thing and what with another, an' all of a fluster  with not being used to travelling, I run up, when the train for  London come in, an' tried to scramble into it, afore it 'ad quite  stopped moving. An' a guard, 'e rushes up, an' 'Stand back!' says  'e; 'wait till the train stops,' says 'e, an' waves his red flag at  me. But afore I could stand back, with one foot on the step, the  train sort of jumped away from me, and knocked me down like this;  and they say it'll be a week now afore I'm well enough to go on to  London. But I posted the letter all the same, at Basingstoke  station, as they was carrying me off; an' I took down the address,  so as to return the arf-sovering." Hilda was right, as always.  She had chosen instinctively the trustworthy person,--chosen her at  first sight, and hit the bull's-eye.    
"Do you know what train the lady was in?" I asked, as she paused.  "Where was it going, did you notice?"    
"It was the Southampton train, sir. I saw the board on the  carriage."    
That settled the question. "You are a good and an honest girl," I  said, pulling out my purse; "and you came to this misfortune  through trying--too eagerly--to help the young lady. A ten-pound  note is not overmuch as compensation for your accident. Take it,  and get well. I should be sorry to think you lost a good place  through your anxiety to help us."    
The rest of my way was plain sailing now. I hurried on straight to  Southampton. There my first visit was to the office of the Castle  line. I went to the point at once. Was there a Miss Wade among  the passengers by the Dunottar Castle?    
No; nobody of that name on the list.    
Had any lady taken a passage at the last moment?    
The clerk perpended. Yes; a lady had come by the mail train from  London, with no heavy baggage, and had gone on board direct, taking  what cabin she could get. A young lady in grey. Quite unprepared.  Gave no name. Called away in a hurry.    
What sort of lady?    
Youngish; good-looking; brown hair and eyes, the clerk thought; a  sort of creamy skin; and a--well, a mesmeric kind of glance that  seemed to go right through you.    
"That will do," I answered, sure now of my quarry. "To which port  did she book?"    
"To Cape Town."    
"Very well," I said, promptly. "You may reserve me a good berth in  the next outgoing steamer."    
It was just like Hilda's impulsive character to rush off in this  way at a moment's notice; and just like mine to follow her. But it  piqued me a little to think that, but for the accident of an  accident, I might never have tracked her down. If the letter had  been posted in London as she intended, and not at Basingstoke, I  might have sought in vain for her from then till Doomsday.    
Ten days later, I was afloat on the Channel, bound for South  Africa.    
I always admired Hilda's astonishing insight into character and  motive; but I never admired it quite so profoundly as on the  glorious day when we arrived at Cape Town. I was standing on deck,  looking out for the first time in my life on that tremendous view--  the steep and massive bulk of Table Mountain,--a mere lump of rock,  dropped loose from the sky, with the long white town spread  gleaming at its base, and the silver-tree plantations that cling to  its lower slopes and merge by degrees into gardens and vineyards--  when a messenger from the shore came up to me tentatively.    
"Dr. Cumberledge?" he said, in an inquiring tone.    
I nodded. "That is my name."    
"I have a letter for you, sir."    
I took it, in great surprise. Who on earth in Cape Town could have  known I was coming? I had not a friend to my knowledge in the  colony. I glanced at the envelope. My wonder deepened. That  prescient brain! It was Hilda's handwriting.    
I tore it open and read:    
"MY DEAR HUBERT,--I <i>know</i> you will come; I <i>know</i> you will follow me.  So I am leaving this letter at Donald Currie & Co.'s office, giving  their agent instructions to hand it to you as soon as you reach  Cape Town. I am quite sure you will track me so far at least; I  understand your temperament. But I beg you, I implore you, to go  no further. You will ruin my plan if you do. And I still adhere  to it. It is good of you to come so far; I cannot blame you for  that. I know your motives. But do not try to find me out. I warn  you, beforehand, it will be quite useless. I have made up my mind.  I have an object in life, and, dear as you are to me--<i>that</i> I will  not pretend to deny--I can never allow even <i>you</i> to interfere with  it. So be warned in time. Go back quietly by the next steamer.    
"Your ever attached and grateful,    
"HILDA."    
I read it twice through with a little thrill of joy. Did any man  ever court so strange a love? Her very strangeness drew me. But  go back by the next steamer! I felt sure of one thing: Hilda was  far too good a judge of character to believe that I was likely to  obey that mandate.    
I will not trouble you with the remaining stages of my quest.  Except for the slowness of South African mail coaches, they were  comparatively easy. It is not so hard to track strangers in Cape  Town as strangers in London. I followed Hilda to her hotel, and  from her hotel up country, stage after stage--jolted by rail, worse  jolted by mule-waggon--inquiring, inquiring, inquiring--till I  learned at last she was somewhere in Rhodesia.    
That is a big address; but it does not cover as many names as it  covers square miles. In time I found her. Still, it took time;  and before we met, Hilda had had leisure to settle down quietly to  her new existence. People in Rhodesia had noted her coming, as a  new portent, because of one strange peculiarity. She was the only  woman of means who had ever gone up of her own free will to  Rhodesia. Other women had gone there to accompany their husbands,  or to earn their livings; but that a lady should freely select that  half-baked land as a place of residence--a lady of position, with  all the world before her where to choose--that puzzled the  Rhodesians. So she was a marked person. Most people solved the  vexed problem, indeed, by suggesting that she had designs against  the stern celibacy of a leading South African politician. "Depend  upon it," they said, "it's Rhodes she's after." The moment I  arrived at Salisbury, and stated my object in coming, all the world  in the new town was ready to assist me. The lady was to be found  (vaguely speaking) on a young farm to the north--a budding farm,  whose general direction was expansively indicated to me by a wave  of the arm, with South African uncertainty.    
I bought a pony at Salisbury--a pretty little seasoned sorrel mare--  and set out to find Hilda. My way lay over a brand-new road, or  what passes for a road in South Africa--very soft and lumpy, like  an English cart-track. I am a fair cross-country rider in our own  Midlands, but I never rode a more tedious journey than that one. I  had crawled several miles under a blazing sun along the shadeless  new track, on my African pony, when, to my surprise I saw, of all  sights in the world, a bicycle coming towards me.    
I could hardly believe my eyes. Civilisation indeed! A bicycle in  these remotest wilds of Africa!    
I had been picking my way for some hours through a desolate  plateau--the high veldt--about five thousand feet above the sea  level, and entirely treeless. In places, to be sure, a few low  bushes of prickly aspect rose in tangled clumps; but for the most  part the arid table-land was covered by a thick growth of short  brown grass, about nine inches high, burnt up in the sun, and most  wearisome to look at. The distressing nakedness of a new country  confronted me. Here and there a bald farm or two had been  literally pegged out--the pegs were almost all one saw of them as  yet; the fields were in the future. Here and there, again, a  scattered range of low granite hills, known locally as kopjes--red,  rocky prominences, flaunting in the sunshine--diversified the  distance. But the road itself, such as it was, lay all on the high  plain, looking down now and again into gorges or kloofs, wooded on  their slopes with scrubby trees, and comparatively well-watered.  In the midst of all this crude, unfinished land, the mere sight of  a bicycle, bumping over the rubbly road, was a sufficient surprise;  but my astonishment reached a climax when I saw, as it drew near,  that it was ridden by a woman!    
One moment later I had burst into a wild cry, and rode forward to  her hurriedly. "Hilda!" I shouted aloud, in my excitement:  "Hilda!"    
She stepped lightly from her pedals, as if it had been in the park:  head erect and proud; eyes liquid, lustrous. I dismounted,  trembling, and stood beside her. In the wild joy of the moment,  for the first time in my life, I kissed her fervently. Hilda took  the kiss, unreproving. She did not attempt to refuse me.    
"So you have come at last!" she murmured, with a glow on her face,  half nestling towards me, half withdrawing, as if two wills tore  her in different directions. "I have been expecting you for some  days; and, somehow, to-day, I was almost certain you were coming!"    
"Then you are not angry with me?" I cried. "You remember, you  forbade me!"    
"Angry with you? Dear Hubert, could I ever be angry with you,  especially for thus showing me your devotion and your trust? I am  never angry with you. When one knows, one understands. I have  thought of you so often; sometimes, alone here in this raw new  land, I have longed for you to come. It is inconsistent of me, of  course; but I am so solitary, so lonely!"    
"And yet you begged me not to follow you!"    
She looked up at me shyly--I was not accustomed to see Hilda shy.  Her eyes gazed deep into mine beneath the long, soft lashes. "I  begged you not to follow me," she repeated, a strange gladness in  her tone. "Yes, dear Hubert, I begged you--and I meant it. Cannot  you understand that sometimes one hopes a thing may never happen--  and is supremely happy because it happens, in spite of one? I have  a purpose in life for which I live: I live for it still. For its  sake I told you you must not come to me. Yet you <i>have</i> come,  against my orders; and--" she paused, and drew a deep sigh--"oh,  Hubert, I thank you for daring to disobey me!"    
I clasped her to my bosom. She allowed me, half resisting. "I am  too weak," she murmured. "Only this morning, I made up my mind  that when I saw you I would implore you to return at once. And now  that you are here--" she laid her little hand confidingly in mine--  "see how foolish I am!--I cannot dismiss you."    
"Which means to say, Hilda, that, after all, you are still a  woman!"    
"A woman; oh, yes; very much a woman! Hubert, I love you; I half  wish I did not."    
"Why, darling?" I drew her to me.    
"Because--if I did not, I could send you away--so easily! As it  is--I cannot let you stop--and . . . I cannot dismiss you."    
"Then divide it," I cried gaily; "do neither; come away with me!"    
"No, no; nor that, either. I will not stultify my whole past life.  I will not dishonour my dear father's memory."    
I looked around for something to which to tether my horse. A  bridle is in one's way--when one has to discuss important business.  There was really nothing about that seemed fit for the purpose.  Hilda saw what I sought, and pointed mutely to a stunted bush  beside a big granite boulder which rose abruptly from the dead  level of the grass, affording a little shade from that sweltering  sunlight. I tied my mare to the gnarled root--it was the only part  big enough--and sat down by Hilda's side, under the shadow of a  great rock in a thirsty land. I realised at that moment the force  and appropriateness of the Psalmist's simile. The sun beat  fiercely on the seeding grasses. Away on the southern horizon we  could faintly perceive the floating yellow haze of the prairie  fires lit by the Mashonas.    
"Then you knew I would come?" I began, as she seated herself on the  burnt-up herbage, while my hand stole into hers, to nestle there  naturally.    
She pressed it in return. "Oh, yes; I knew you would come," she  answered, with that strange ring of confidence in her voice. "Of  course you got my letter at Cape Town?"    
"I did, Hilda--and I wondered at you more than ever as I read it.  But if you <i>knew</i> I would come, why write to prevent me?"    
Her eyes had their mysterious far-away air. She looked out upon  infinity. "Well, I wanted to do my best to turn you aside," she  said, slowly. "One must always do one's best, even when one feels  and believes it is useless. That surely is the first clause in a  doctor's or a nurse's rubric."    
"But <i>why</i> didn't you want me to come?" I persisted. "Why fight  against your own heart? Hilda, I am sure--I <i>know</i> you love me."    
Her bosom rose and fell. Her eyes dilated. "Love you?" she cried,  looking away over the bushy ridges, as if afraid to trust herself.  "Oh, yes, Hubert, I love you! It is not for that that I wish to  avoid you. Or, rather, it is just because of that. I cannot  endure to spoil your life--by a fruitless affection."    
"Why fruitless?" I asked, leaning forward.    
She crossed her hands resignedly. "You know all by this time," she  answered. "Sebastian would tell you, of course, when you went to  announce that you were leaving Nathaniel's. He could not do  otherwise; it is the outcome of his temperament--an integral part  of his nature."    
"Hilda," I cried, "you are a witch! How <i>could</i> you know that? I  can't imagine."    
She smiled her restrained, Chaldean smile. "Because I <i>know</i>  Sebastian," she answered, quietly. I can read that man to the  core. He is simple as a book. His composition is plain,  straightforward, quite natural, uniform. There are no twists and  turns in him. Once learn the key, and it discloses everything,  like an open sesame. He has a gigantic intellect, a burning thirst  for knowledge; one love, one hobby--science; and no moral  instincts. He goes straight for his ends; and whatever comes in  his way," she dug her little heel in the brown soil, "he tramples  on it as ruthlessly as a child will trample on a worm or a beetle."    
"And yet," I said, "he is so great."    
"Yes, great, I grant you; but the easiest character to unravel that  I have ever met. It is calm, austere, unbending, yet not in the  least degree complex. He has the impassioned temperament, pushed  to its highest pitch; the temperament that runs deep, with  irresistible force; but the passion that inspires him, that carries  him away headlong, as love carries some men, is a rare and abstract  one--the passion of science."    
I gazed at her as she spoke, with a feeling akin to awe. "It must  destroy the plot-interest of life for you, Hilda," I cried--out  there in the vast void of that wild African plateau--"to foresee so  well what each person will do--how each will act under such given  circumstances."    
She pulled a bent of grass and plucked off its dry spikelets one by  one. "Perhaps so," she answered, after a meditative pause;  "though, of course, all natures are not equally simple. Only with  great souls can you be sure beforehand like that, for good or for  evil. It is essential to anything worth calling character that one  should be able to predict in what way it will act under given  circumstances--to feel certain, 'This man will do nothing small or  mean,' 'That one could never act dishonestly, or speak deceitfully.'  But smaller natures are more complex. They defy analysis, because  their motives are not consistent."    
"Most people think to be complex is to be great," I objected.    
She shook her head. "That is quite a mistake," she answered.  "Great natures are simple, and relatively predictable, since their  motives balance one another justly. Small natures are complex, and  hard to predict, because small passions, small jealousies, small  discords and perturbations come in at all moments, and override for  a time the permanent underlying factors of character. Great  natures, good or bad, are equably poised; small natures let petty  motives intervene to upset their balance."    
"Then you knew I would come," I exclaimed, half pleased to find I  belonged inferentially to her higher category.    
Her eyes beamed on me with a beautiful light. "Knew you would  come? Oh, yes. I begged you not to come; but I felt sure you were  too deeply in earnest to obey me. I asked a friend in Cape Town to  telegraph your arrival; and almost ever since the telegram reached  me I have been expecting you and awaiting you."    
"So you believed in me?"    
"Implicitly--as you in me. That is the worst of it, Hubert. If  you did <i>not</i> believe in me, I could have told you all--and then, you  would have left me. But, as it is, you <i>know</i> all--and yet, you want  to cling to me."    
"You know I know all--because Sebastian told me?"    
"Yes; and I think I even know how you answered him."    
"How?"    
She paused. The calm smile lighted up her face once more. Then  she drew out a pencil. "You think life must lack plot-interest for  me," she began, slowly, "because, with certain natures, I can  partially guess beforehand what is coming. But have you not  observed that, in reading a novel, part of the pleasure you feel  arises from your conscious anticipation of the end, and your  satisfaction in seeing that you anticipated correctly? Or part,  sometimes, from the occasional unexpectedness of the real  denouement? Well, life is like that. I enjoy observing my  successes, and, in a way, my failures. Let me show you what I  mean. I think I know what you said to Sebastian--not the words, of  course, but the purport; and I will write it down now for you. Set  down <i>your</i> version, too. And then we will compare them."    
It was a crucial test. We both wrote for a minute or two.  Somehow, in Hilda's presence, I forgot at once the strangeness of  the scene, the weird oddity of the moment. That sombre plain  disappeared for me. I was only aware that I was with Hilda once  more--and therefore in Paradise. Pison and Gihon watered the  desolate land. Whatever she did seemed to me supremely right. If  she had proposed to me to begin a ponderous work on Medical  Jurisprudence, under the shadow of the big rock, I should have  begun it incontinently.    
She handed me her slip of paper; I took it and read: "Sebastian  told you I was Dr. Yorke-Bannerman's daughter. And you answered,  'If so, Yorke-Bannerman was innocent, and <i>you</i> are the poisoner.'  Is not that correct?"    
I handed her in answer my own paper. She read it with a faint  flush. When she came to the words: "Either she is not Yorke-  Bannerman's daughter; or else, Yorke-Bannerman was not a poisoner,  and someone else was--I might put a name to him," she rose to her  feet with a great rush of long-suppressed feeling, and clasped me  passionately. "My Hubert!" she cried, "I read you aright. I knew  it! I was sure of you!"    
I folded her in my arms, there, on the rusty-red South African  desert. "Then, Hilda dear," I murmured, "you will consent to marry  me?"    
The words brought her back to herself. She unfolded my arms with  slow reluctance. "No, dearest," she said, earnestly, with a face  where pride fought hard against love. "That is <i>why</i>, above all  things, I did not want you to follow me. I love you; I trust you:  you love me; you trust me. But I never will marry anyone till I  have succeeded in clearing my father's memory. I <i>know</i> he did not  do it; I <i>know</i> Sebastian did. But that is not enough. I must prove  it, I must prove it!"    
"I believe it already," I answered. "What need, then, to prove  it?"    
"To you, Hubert? Oh, no; not to you. There I am safe. But to the  world that condemned him--condemned him untried. I must vindicate  him; I must clear him!"    
I bent my face close to hers. "But may I not marry you first?" I  asked--"and after that, I can help you to clear him."    
She gazed at me fearlessly. "No, no!" she cried, clasping her  hands; "much as I love you, dear Hubert, I cannot consent to it. I  am too proud!--too proud! I will not allow the world to say--not  even to say falsely"--her face flushed crimson; her voice dropped  low--"I will not allow them to say those hateful words, 'He married  a murderer's daughter.'"    
I bowed my head. "As you will, my darling," I answered. "I am  content to wait. I trust you in this, too. Some day, we will  prove it."    
And all this time, preoccupied as I was with these deeper concerns,  I had not even asked where Hilda lived, or what she was doing!
