  Behind the sledge ran Howland, to the right of the team ran Jean.  Once or twice when Croisset glanced back his eyes met those of the  engineer. He cracked his whip and smiled, and Howland's teeth gleamed  back coldly in reply. A mutual understanding flashed between them in  these glances. In a sudden spurt Howland knew that the Frenchman could  quickly put distance between them&#8212;but not a distance that his bullets  could not cover in the space of a breath. He had made up his mind to  fire, deliberately and with his greatest skill, if Croisset made the  slightest movement toward escape. If he was compelled to kill or wound  his companion he could still go on alone with the dogs, for the trail  of Meleese and Jackpine would be as plain as their own, which they were  following back into the South.
  For the second time since coming into the North he felt the blood  leaping through his veins as on that first night in Prince Albert when  from the mountain he had heard the lone wolf, and when later he had  seen the beautiful face through the hotel window. Howland was one of  the few men who possess unbounded confidence in themselves, who place a  certain pride in their physical as well as their mental capabilities,  and he was confident now. His successful and indomitable fight over  obstacles in a big city had made this confidence a genuine part of his  being. It was a confidence that flushed his face with joyous enthusiasm  as he ran after the dogs, and that astonished and puzzled Jean  Croisset.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, but you are a strange man!&#8221; exclaimed the  Frenchman when he brought the dogs down to a walk after a half mile  run. &#8220;Blessed saints, M'seur, you are laughing&#8212;and I swear it is no  laughing matter.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shouldn't a man be happy when he is going to his wedding, Jean?&#8221;  puffed Howland, gasping to get back the breath he had lost.
  &#8220;But not when he's going to his funeral, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;If I were one of your blessed saints I'd hit you over the head with  a thunderbolt, Croisset. Good Lord, what sort of a heart have you got  inside of your jacket, man? Up there where we're going is the sweetest  little girl in the whole world. I love her. She loves me. Why shouldn't  I be happy, now that I know I'm going to see her again very soon&#8212;and  take her back into the South with me?&#8221;
  &#8220;The devil!&#8221; grunted Jean.
  &#8220;Perhaps you're jealous, Croisset,&#8221; suggested Howland. &#8220;Great Scott,  I hadn't thought of<I> that!</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;I've got one of my own to love, M'seur; and I wouldn't trade her  for all else in the world.&#8221;
  &#8220;Damned if I can understand you,&#8221; swore the engineer. &#8220;You appear to  be half human; you say you're in love, and yet you'd rather risk your  life than help out Meleese and me. What the deuce does it mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's what I'm doing, M'seur&#8212;helping Meleese. I would have done  her a greater service if I had killed you back there on the trail and  stripped your body for those things that would be foul enough to eat  it. I have told you a dozen times that it is God's justice that you  die. And you are going to die&#8212;very soon, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I'm not going to die, Jean. I'm going to see Meleese, and she's  going back into the South with me. And if you're real good you may have  the pleasure of driving us back to the Wekusko, Croisset, and you can  be my best man at the wedding. What do you say to that?&#8221;
  &#8220;That you are mad&#8212;or a fool,&#8221; retorted Jean, cracking his whip  viciously.
  The dogs swung sharply from the trail, heading from their southerly  course into the northwest.
  &#8220;We will save a day by doing this,&#8221; explained Croisset at the  other's sharp word of inquiry. &#8220;We will hit the other trail twenty  miles west of here, while by following back to where they turned we  would travel sixty miles to reach the same point. That one chance in a  hundred which you have depends on this, M'seur. If the other sledge has  passed&#8212;&#8221;
  He shrugged his shoulders and started the dogs into a trot.
  &#8220;Look here,&#8221; cried Howland, running beside him. &#8220;Who is with this  other sledge?&#8221;
  &#8220;Those who tried to kill you on the trail and at the coyote,  M'seur,&#8221; he answered quickly.
  Howland fell half a dozen paces behind. By the end of the first hour  he was compelled to rest frequently by taking to the sledge, and their  progress was much slower. Jean no longer made answer to his occasional  questions. Doggedly he swung on ahead to the right and a little behind  the team leader, and Howland could see that for some reason Croisset  was as anxious as himself to make the best time possible. His own  impatience increased as the morning lengthened. Jean's assurance that  the mysterious enemies who had twice attempted his life were only a  short distance behind them, or a short distance ahead, set a new and  desperate idea at work in his brain. He was confident that these men  from the Wekusko were his chief menace, and that with them once out of  the way, and with the Frenchman in his power, the fight which he was  carrying into the enemy's country would be half won. There would then  be no one to recognize him but Meleese.
  His heart leaped with joyous hope, and he leaned forward on the  sledge to examine Croisset's empty gun. It was an automatic, and  Croisset, glancing back over the loping backs of the huskies, caught  him smiling. He ran more frequently now, and longer distances, and with  the passing of each mile his determination to strike a decisive blow  increased. If they reached the trail of Meleese and Jackpine before the  crossing of the second sledge he would lay in wait for his old enemies;  if they had preceded them he would pursue and surprise them in camp. In  either case he would possess an overwhelming advantage.
  With the same calculating attention to detail that he would have  shown in the arrangement of plans for the building of a tunnel or a  bridge, he drew a mental map of his scheme and its possibilities. There  would be at least two men with the sledge, and possibly three. If they  surrendered at the point of his rifle without a fight he would compel  Jean to tie them up with dog-traces while he held them under cover. If  they made a move to offer resistance he would shoot. With the automatic  he could kill or wound the three before they could reach their rifles,  which would undoubtedly be on the sledge. The situation had now reached  a point where he no longer took into consideration what these men might  be to Meleese.
  As they continued into the northwest Howland noted that the thicker  forest was gradually clearing into wide areas of small banskian pine,  and that the rock ridges and dense swamps which had impeded their  progress were becoming less numerous. An hour before noon, after a  tedious climb to the top of a frozen ridge, Croisset pointed down into  a vast level plain lying between them and other great ridges far to the  north.
  &#8220;That is a bit of the Barren Lands that creeps down between those  mountains off there, M'seur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you see that black forest  that looks like a charred log in the snow to the south and west of the  mountains? That is the break that leads into the country of the  Athabasca. Somewhere between this point and that we will strike the  trail. Mon Dieu, I had half expected to see them out there on the  plain.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who? Meleese and Jackpine, or&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;No, the others, M'seur. Shall we have dinner here?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not until we hit the trail,&#8221; replied Howland. &#8220;I'm anxious to know  about that one chance in a hundred you've given me hope of, Croisset.  If they have passed&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;If they are ahead of us you might just as well stand out there and  let me put a bullet through you, M'seur.&#8221;
  He went to the head of the dogs, guiding them down the rough side of  the ridge, while Howland steadied the toboggan from behind. For  three-quarters of an hour they traversed the low bush of the plain in  silence. From every rising snow hummock Jean scanned the white  desolation about them, and each time, as nothing that was human came  within his vision, he turned toward the engineer with a sinister shrug  of his shoulders. Once three moving caribou, a mile or more away,  brought a quick cry to his lips and Howland noticed that a sudden flush  of excitement came into his face, replaced in the next instant by a  look of disappointment. After this he maintained a more careful guard  over the Frenchman. They had covered less than half of the distance to  the caribou trail when in a small open space free of bush Croisset's  voice rose sharply and the team stopped.
  &#8220;What do you think of it, M'seur?&#8221; he cried, pointing to the snow.  &#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221;
  Barely cutting into the edge of the open was the broken crust of two  sledge trails. For a moment Howland forgot his caution and bent over to  examine the trails, with his back to his companion. When he looked up  there was a curious laughing gleam in Jean's eyes.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, but you are careless!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Be more  careful, M'seur. I may give myself up to another temptation like that.&#8221;
  &#8220;The deuce you say!&#8221; cried Howland, springing back quickly. &#8220;I'm  much obliged, Jean. If it wasn't for the moral effect of the thing I'd  shake hands with you on that. How far ahead of us do you suppose they  are?&#8221;
  Croisset had fallen on his knees in the trail.
  &#8220;The crust is freshly broken,&#8221; he said after a moment. &#8220;They have  been gone not less than two or three hours, perhaps since morning. See  this white glistening surface over the first trail, M'seur, like a  billion needle-points growing out of it? That is the work of three or  four days' cold. The first sledge passed that long ago.&#8221;
  Howland turned and picked up Croisset's rifle. The Frenchman watched  him as he slipped a clip full of cartridges into the breech.
  &#8220;If there's a snack of cold stuff in the pack dig it out,&#8221; he  commanded. &#8220;We'll eat on the run, if you've got anything to eat. If you  haven't, we'll go hungry. We're going to overtake that sledge sometime  this afternoon or to-night&#8212;or bust!&#8221;
  &#8220;The saints be blessed, then we are most certain to bust, M'seur,&#8221;  gasped Jean. &#8220;And if we don't the dogs will. Non, it is impossible!&#8221;
  &#8220;Is there anything to eat?&#8221;
  &#8220;A morsel of cold meat&#8212;that is all. But I say that it is  impossible. That sledge&#8212;&#8221;
  Howland interrupted him with an impatient gesture.
  &#8220;And I say that if there is anything to eat in there, get it out,  and be quick about it, Croisset. We're going to overtake those precious  friends of yours, and I warn you that if you make any attempt to lose  time something unpleasant is going to happen. Understand?&#8221;
  Jean had bent to unstrap one end of the sledge pack and an angry  flash leaped into his eyes at the threatening tone of the engineer's  voice. For a moment he seemed on the point of speech, but caught  himself and in silence divided the small chunk of meat which he drew  from the pack, giving the larger share to Howland as he went to the  head of the dogs. Only once or twice during the next hour did he look  back, and after each of these glances he redoubled his efforts at  urging on the huskies. Before they had come to the edge of the black  banskian forest which Jean had pointed out from the farther side of the  plain, Howland saw that the pace was telling on the team. The leader  was trailing lame, and now and then the whole pack would settle back in  their traces, to be urged on again by the fierce cracking of Croisset's  long whip. To add to his own discomfiture Howland found that he could  no longer keep up with Jean and the dogs, and with his weight added to  the sledge the huskies settled down into a tugging walk.
  Thus they came into the deep low forest, and Jean, apparently  oblivious of the exhaustion of both man and dogs, walked now in advance  of the team, his eyes constantly on the thin trail ahead. Howland could  not fail to see that his unnecessary threat of a few hours before still  rankled in the Frenchman's mind, and several times he made an effort to  break the other's taciturnity. But Jean strode on in moody silence,  answering only those things which were put to him directly, and  speaking not an unnecessary word. At last the engineer jumped from the  sledge and overtook his companion.
  &#8220;Hold on, Jean,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I've got enough. You're right, and I  want to apologize. We're busted&#8212;that is, the dogs and I are busted,  and we might as well give it up until we've had a feed. What do you  say?&#8221;
  &#8220;I say that you have stopped just in time, M'seur,&#8221; replied Croisset  with purring softness. &#8220;Another half hour and we would have been  through the forest, and just beyond that&#8212;in the edge of the plain&#8212;are  those whom you seek, Meleese and her people. That is what I started to  tell you back there when you shut me up.<I> Mon Dieu</I>, if it were  not for Meleese I would let you go on. And then&#8212;what would happen  then, M'seur, if you made your visit to them in broad day? Listen!&#8221;
  Jean lifted a warning hand. Faintly there came to them through the  forest the distant baying of a hound.
  &#8220;That is one of our dogs from the Mackenzie country,&#8221; he went on  softly, an insinuating triumph in his low voice. &#8220;Now, M'seur, that I  have brought you here what are you going to do? Shall we go on and take  dinner with those who are going to kill you, or will you wait a few  hours? Eh, which shall it be?&#8221;
  For a moment Howland stood motionless, stunned by the Frenchman's  words. Quickly he recovered himself. His eyes burned with a metallic  gleam as they met the half taunt in Croisset's cool smile.
  &#8220;If I had not stopped you&#8212;we would have gone on?&#8221; he questioned  tensely.
  &#8220;To be sure, M'seur,&#8221; retorted Croisset, still smiling. &#8220;You warned  me to lose no time&#8212;that something would happen if I did.&#8221;
  With a quick movement Howland drew his revolver and leveled it at  the Frenchman's heart.
  &#8220;If you ever prayed to those blessed saints of yours, do it now,  Jean Croisset. I'm going to kill you!&#8221; he cried fiercely.
