On the following day every shop was closed in Poughkeepsie. The men,  even many of the women, stood for hours in the streets, talking little,  their eyes seldom wandering from the Court-house, many of them crowding  close to the walls, that they might catch a ringing phrase now and  again. By this time they all knew Hamilton's voice, and they confessed  to a preference for his lucid precision. In front of the Court-house,  under a tree, an express messenger sat beside his horse, saddled for a  wild dash to New York with the tidings. The excitement seemed the more  intense for the heat of the day, which half suppressed it, and all  longed for the snap of the tension.    
Within the upper room of the Court-house the very air vibrated. Clinton,  who always grunted at intervals, and blew his nose stentoriously when  fervescent, was unusually aggressive. Beyond the bar men and women  stood; there was no room for chairs, nor for half that desired  admittance. In the very front stood the only woman whose superb physique  carried her through that trying day without smelling-salts or a friendly  shoulder. She was a woman with the eyes of an angel, disdainful of men,  the mouth of insatiety, the hair and skin of a Lorelei, and a patrician  profile. Her figure was long, slender, and voluptuous. Every man within  the bar offered her his chair, but she refused to sit while other women  stood; and few were the regrets at the more ample display of her  loveliness.    
Hamilton and Lansing debated with a lively exchange of acrimonious wit.  Smith spoke in behalf of the Constitution. Then Hamilton rose for what  all felt was to be a grand final effort, and even his friends  experienced an almost intolerable excitement. On the other side men  trembled visibly with apprehension, not so much in fear of the result as  of the assault upon their nervous systems. They hardly could have felt  worse if on their way to execution, but not a man left his seat; the  fascination was too strong to induce even a desire to avoid it.    
Hamilton began dispassionately enough. He went over the whole  Constitution rapidly, yet in so emphatic a manner as to accomplish the  intelligent subservience of his audience. Then, with the unexaggerated  eloquence of which he was so consummate a master, he pictured the  beauty, the happiness, the wealth of the United States under the new  Constitution; of the peace and prosperity of half a million homes; of  the uninterrupted industry of her great cities, their ramifications to  countless hamlets; of the good-will and honour of Europe; of a vast  international trade; of a restored credit at home and abroad, which  should lift the heavy clouds from the future of every ambitious man in  the Republic; of a peace between the States which would tend to the  elevation of the American character, as the bitter, petty, warring, and  perpetual jealousies had incontestably lowered it; of, for the beginning  of their experiment, at least eight years of harmony under George  Washington.    
He spoke for two hours in the glowing terms of a prophecy and an  optimism so alluring, that load after load seemed to roll from the  burdened minds opposite, although Clinton snorted as if about to thrust  down his head and paw the earth. When Hamilton had made his hearers  thoroughly drunk with dreams of an ecstatic future, he advanced upon  them suddenly, and, without a word of warning transition, poured upon  them so terrible a picture of the consequences of their refusal to enter  the Union, that for the first few moments they were ready to leap upon  him and wrench him apart. The assault was terrific, and he plunged on  remorselessly. He sketched the miseries of the past eleven years, the  poverty, the dangers, the dishonour, and then by the most precise and  logical deduction presented a future which, by the commonest natural and  social laws, must, without the protection of a high and central power,  be the hideous finish. The twilight came; the evening breeze was  rustling through the trees and across the sultry room. As Hamilton had  calculated, the moment came when he had his grip on the very roots of  the enemy's nerves. Chests were rising, handkerchiefs appearing. Women  fainted. Clinton blew his nose with such terrific force that the  messenger below scrambled to his feet. Hamilton waited during a  breathless moment, then charged down upon them.    
"Now listen, gentlemen," he said. "No one so much as I wishes that this  Constitution be ratified to the honour of the State of New York; but  upon this I have determined: that the enlightened and patriotic minority  shall not suffer for the selfishness and obstinacy of the majority. I  therefore announce to you plainly, gentlemen, that if you do not ratify  this Constitution, with no further talk of impossible amendments and  conditions, that Manhattan Island, Westchester, and Kings counties shall  secede from the State of New York and form a State by themselves,  leaving the rest of your State without a seaport, too contemptible to  make treaties, with only a small and possibly rebellious militia to  protect her northern boundaries from the certain rapacity of Great  Britain, with the scorn and dislike of the Union, and with no hope of  assistance from the Federal Government, which is assured, remember, no  matter what her straits. That is all."    
It was enough. He had won the day. The Constitution was ratified without  further parley.
