  Kent stood still while Marette moved in that gloom, found matches,   and lighted the lamp. He had not spoken a word after the kiss. He  had  not taken advantage of it. The gentle pressure of her hands  had  restrained him from taking her in his arms. But the kiss  itself fired  him with a wild and glorious thrill that was like a  vibrant music to  which every atom of life in his body responded.  If he claimed his  reward at all, he had expected her kiss to be  perhaps indifferent, at  least neutral. But the lips she had given  him there in the darkness of  the room were warm, living, breathing  lips. They had not been snatched  away from him too quickly. Their  sweetness, for an instant, had  lingered. 
  Then, in the lamp glow, he was looking into Marette Radisson's   face. He knew that his own was aflame. He had no desire to hide  its  confession, and he was eager to find what lay in her own eyes.  And he  was astonished, and then startled. The kiss had not  disturbed Marette.  It was as if it had never happened. 
  She was not embarrassed, and there was no hint of color in her   face. It was her deathly whiteness that startled him, a pallor   emphasized by the dark masses of her hair, and a strange glow in  her  eyes. It was not a glow brought there by the kiss. It was  fear, fading  slowly out of them as he looked, until at last it was  gone, and her  lips trembled with an apologetic smile. 
  &quot;He was very angry,&quot; she said. &quot;How easily some men lose their   tempers, don't they&#8212;Jeems?&quot; 
  The little break in her voice, her brave effort to control   herself, and the whimsical bit of smile that accompanied her words   made him want to do what the gentle pressure of her hands had kept   him from doing a few moments before&#8212;pick her up in his arms. What   she was trying to hide he saw plainly. She had been in danger, a   danger greater than that which she had quietly and fearlessly  faced  at barracks. And she was still afraid of that menace. It was  the last  thing which she wanted him to know, and yet he knew it. A  new force  swept through him. It was the force which comes of  mastery, of  possessorship, of fighting grimly against odds. It  rose in a mighty  triumph. It told him this girl belonged to him,  that she was his to  fight for. And he was going to fight. Marette  saw the change that came  into his face. For a moment after she had  spoken there was silence  between them. Outside the storm beat in a  fiercer blast. A roll of  thunder crashed over the bungalow. The  windows rattled in a sweep of  wind and rain. Kent, looking at her,  his muscles hardening, his face  growing grimmer, nodded toward the  window at which Mooie's signal had  come. 
  &quot;It is a splendid night&#8212;for us,&quot; he said. &quot;And we must go.&quot; 
  She did not answer. 
  &quot;In the eyes of the law I am a murderer,&quot; he went on. &quot;You saved   me. You shot a man. In those same eyes you are a criminal. It is   folly to remain here. It is sheer suicide for both of us. If   Kedsty&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;If Kedsty does not do what I told him to do to-night, I shall   kill him!&quot; she said. 
  The quietness of her words, the steadiness of her eyes, held him   speechless. Again it seemed to him, as it had seemed to him in his   room at Cardigan's place, that it was a child who was looking at  him  and speaking to him. If she had shown fear a few moments  before, that  fear was not revealed in her face now. She was not  excited. Her eyes  were softly and quietly beautiful. She amazed  him and discomfited him.  Against that child-like sureness he felt  himself helpless. Its potency  was greater than his strength and  greater than his determination. It  placed between them instantly a  vast gulf, a gulf that might be  bridged by prayer and entreaty,  but never by force. There was no hint  of excitement in her threat  against Kedsty, and yet in the very  calmness of it he felt its  deadliness. 
  A whimsical half-smile was trembling on her lips again, and a   warmer glow came into her eyes. &quot;Do you know,&quot; she said, &quot;that   according to an old and sacred code of the North you belong to  me?&quot; 
  &quot;I have heard of that code,&quot; he replied. &quot;A hundred years ago I   should have been your slave. If it exists today, I am happy.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, you see the point, Jeems, don't you? You were about to die,   probably. I think they would have hanged you. And I saved your  life.  Therefore your life belongs to me, for I insist that the  code still  lives. You are my property, and I am going to do with  you as I please,  until I turn you over to the Rivers. And you are  not going tonight.  You shall wait here for Laselle and his  brigade.&quot; 
  &quot;Laselle&#8212;Jean Laselle?&quot; 
  She nodded. &quot;Yes, that is why you must wait. We have made a   splendid arrangement. When Laselle and his brigade start north,  you  go with them. And no one will ever know. You are safe here. No  one  will think of looking for you under the roof of the Inspector  of  Police.&quot; 
  &quot;But you, Marette!&quot; He caught himself, remembering her injunction   not to question her. Marette shrugged her slim shoulders the   slightest bit and nodded for him to look upon what she knew he had   already seen, her room. 
  &quot;It is not uncomfortable,&quot; she said. &quot;I have been here for a   number of weeks, and nothing has happened to me. I am quite safe.   Inspector Kedsty has not looked inside that door since the day  your  big red-headed friend saw me down in the poplars. He has not  put a  foot on the stair. That is the dead-line. And&#8212;I know&#8212;you  are  wondering. You are asking yourself a great many questions&#8212;a  bon  droit, M'sieu Jeems. You are burning up with them. I can see  it. And  I&#8212;&quot; 
  There was something suddenly pathetic about her, as she sank into   the big-armed, upholstered chair which had been Kedsty's favorite   reading chair. She was tired, and for a moment it seemed to Kent  that  she was almost ready to cry. Her ringers twisted nervously at  the  shining end of the braid in her lap, and more than ever he  thought how  slim and helpless, she was, yet how gloriously  unafraid, how  unconquerable with that something within her that  burned like the fire  of a dynamo. The flame of that force had gone  down now, as though the  fire itself was dying out; but when she  raised her eyes to him,  looking up at him from out of the big  chair, he knew that back of the  yearning, child-like glow that lay  in them the heart of that fire was  living and unquenchable. Again,  for him, she had ceased to be a woman.  It was the soul of a child  that lay in her wide-open, wonderfully blue  eyes. Twice before he  had seen that miracle, and it held him now, as  it had held him  that first time when she had stood with her back at  Cardigan's  door. And as it had changed then, so it changed now,  slowly, and  she was a woman again, with that great gulf of  unapproachableness  between them. But the yearning was still there,  revealing itself  to him, and yet, like the sun, infinitely remote from  him. 
  &quot;I wish that I might answer those questions for you,&quot; she said, in   a voice that was low and tired. &quot;I should like to have you know,   because I&#8212;I have great faith in you, Jeems. But I cannot. It is   impossible. It is inconceivable. If I did&#8212;&quot; She made a hopeless   little gesture. &quot;If I told you everything, you would not like me  any  more. And I want you to like me&#8212;until you go north with  M'sieu Jean  and his brigade.&quot; 
  &quot;And when I do that,&quot; cried Kent, almost savagely, &quot;I shall find   this place you call the Valley of Silent Men, if it takes me all  my  life.&quot; 
  It was becoming a joy for him to see the sudden flashes of   pleasure that leaped into her eyes. She attempted no concealment.   Whatever her emotions were they revealed themselves unaffectedly  and  with a simple freedom from embarrassment that swept him with  an almost  reverential worship. And what he had just said pleased  her.  Unreservedly her glowing eyes and her partly smiling lips  told him  that, and she said: &quot;I am glad you feel that way, Jeems.  And I think  you would find it&#8212;in time. Because&#8212;&quot; 
  Her little trick of looking at him so steadily, as if there was   something inside him which she was trying to see more clearly,  made  him feel more helplessly than ever her slave. It was as if,  in those  moments, she forgot that he was of flesh and blood, and  was looking  into his heart to see what was there before she gave  voice to things. 
  And then she said, still twisting her braid between her slim   fingers, &quot;You would find it&#8212;perhaps&#8212;because you are one who  would  not give up easily. Shall I tell you why I came to see you  at Doctor  Cardigan's? It was curiosity, at first&#8212;largely that.  Just why or how  I was interested in the man you freed is one of  the things I can not  tell you. And I can not tell you why I came  to the Landing. Nor can I  say a word about Kedsty. It may be, some  day, that you will know. And  then you will not like me. For nearly  four years before I saw you that  day I had been in a desolation.  It was a terrible place. It ate my  heart and soul out with its  ugliness, its loneliness, its emptiness. A  little while longer and  I would have died. Then the thing happened  that brought me away.  Can you guess where it was?&quot; 
  He shook his head, &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;To all the others it was a beautiful place, Montreal.&quot; 
  &quot;You were at school there?&quot; he guessed. 
  &quot;Yes, the Villa Maria. I wasn't quite sixteen then. They were   kind. I think they liked me. But each night I prayed one prayer.  You  know what the Three Rivers are to us, to the people of the  North. The  Athabasca is Grandmother, the Slave is Mother, the  Mackenzie is  Daughter, and over them watches always the goddess  Niska, the Gray  Goose. And my prayer was that I might go back to  them. In Montreal  there were people, people everywhere, thousands  and tens of thousands  of them, so many that I was lonely and  heartsick and wanted to get  away. For the Gray Goose blood is in  me, Jeems. I love the forests.  And Niska's God doesn't live in  Montreal. Her sun doesn't rise there.  Her moon isn't the same  there. The flowers are not hers. The winds  tell different stories.  The air is another air. People, when they look  at you, look in  another way. Away down the Three Rivers I had loved  men. There I  was learning to hate them. Then, something happened. I  came to  Athabasca Landing. I went to see you because&#8212;&quot; 
  She clasped her two hands tightly in her lap. &quot;Because, after   those four terrible years, you were the first man I found who was   playing a great, big, square game to the end. Don't ask me how I   found it out. Please don't ask me anything. I am telling you all  you  can know, all you SHALL know. But I did find it out. And then  I  learned that you were not going to die. Kedsty told me that. And  when  I had talked with you I knew that you would play any game  square, and  I made up my mind to help you. That is why I am  telling you all  this&#8212;just to let you know that I have faith in  you, and that you must  not break that faith. You must not insist  on knowing more about me.  You must still play the game. I am  playing mine, and you must play  yours. And to play yours clean,  you must go with Laselle's brigade and  leave me with Kedsty. You  must forget what has happened. You must  forget what MAY happen.  You can not help me. You can only harm me. And  if&#8212;some day, a  long time from now&#8212;you should happen to find the  Valley of Silent  Men&#8212;&quot; 
  He waited, his heart pounding like a fist. 
  &quot;I may&#8212;be there,&quot; she finished, in a voice so low that it was   scarcely above a whisper. 
  It seemed to him that she was looking a long way off, and it was   not in his direction. And then she smiled, not at him, but in a   half-hopeless little way. 
  &quot;I think I shall be disappointed if you don't find it,&quot; she said   then, and her eyes were pure as the blue flowers from which they  had  stolen their color, as she looked at him. &quot;You know the great  Sulphur  Country beyond Fort Simpson, westward between the Two  Nahannis?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. That is where Kilbane and his patrol were lost. The Indians   call it the Devil Country. Is that it?&quot; 
  She nodded. &quot;They say no living thing has ever been through the   Sulphur Country,&quot; she said. &quot;But that is not true. I have been   through it. It is beyond the Sulphur Country you must go to find  the  Valley of Silent Men, straight through that gap between the  North and  the South Nahanni. That is the way YOU must go if you  should ever find  it, Jeems, for otherwise you would have to come  down from Dawson or up  from Skagway, and the country is so great  that you would never come  upon it in a thousand years. The police  will not find you there. You  will always be safe. Perhaps I shall  tell you more before the Brigade  comes. But that is all tonight. I  may never tell you anything more.  And you must not question me.&quot; 
  Speechless he had stood, all the life of his soul burning like a   fire in his eyes as he looked at her and listened to her, and now,   quietly and unexcitedly, he said: 
  &quot;Marette, I am going to play this game as you want me to play it,   because I love you. It is only honest for me to tell you in words   what you must already know. And I am going to fight for you as  long  as there is a drop of blood in my body. If I go with Jean  Laselle's  brigade, will you promise me&#8212;&quot; 
  His voice trembled. He was repressing a mighty emotion. But not by   the quiver of one of her long lashes did Marette Radisson give   evidence that she had even heard his confession of love. She   interrupted him before he had finished. 
  &quot;I can promise you nothing, no matter what you do. Jeems, Jeems,   you are not like those other men I learned to hate? You will not   INSIST? If you do&#8212;if you are like them&#8212;yes, you may go away from   here tonight and not wait for Jean Laselle. Listen! The storm will   not break for hours. If you are going to demand a price for  playing  the game as I want you to play it, you may go. You have my   permission.&quot; 
  She was very white. She rose from the big chair and stood before   him. There was no anger in her voice or gesture, but her eyes  glowed  like luminous stars. There was something in them which he  had not seen  before, and suddenly a thought struck his heart cold  as ice. 
  With a low cry he stretched out his hands, &quot;My God, Marette, I am   not a murderer! I did not kill John Barkley!&quot; 
  She did not answer him. 
  &quot;You don't believe me,&quot; he cried. &quot;You believe that I killed   Barkley, and that now&#8212;a murderer&#8212;I dare to tell you that I love   you!&quot; 
  She was trembling. It was like a little shiver running through   her. For only a flash it seemed to him that he had caught a  glimpse  of something terrible, a thing she was hiding, a thing she  was  fighting as she stood there with her two little clenched  hands. For in  her face, in her eyes, in the beating throb of her  white throat he  saw, in that moment, the almost hidden agony of a  hurt thing. And then  it was gone, even as he entreated again,  pleading for her faith. 
  &quot;I did not kill John Barkley!&quot; 
  &quot;I am not thinking of that, Jeems,&quot; she said. &quot;It is of  something&#8212;&quot; 
  They had forgotten the storm. It was howling and beating at the   windows outside. But suddenly there came a sound that rose above  the  monotonous tumult of it, and Marette started as if it had sent  an  electric shock through her. Kent, too, turned toward the  window. 
  It was the metallic tap, tap, tapping which once before had warned   them of approaching danger. And this time it was insistent. It was  as  if a voice was crying out to them from beyond the window. It  was more  than premonition&#8212;it was the alarm of a near and  impending menace. And  in that moment Kent saw Marette Radisson's  hands go swiftly to her  throat and her eyes leap with sudden fire,  and she gave a little cry  as she listened to the sound.
