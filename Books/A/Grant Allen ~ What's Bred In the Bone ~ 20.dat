Guy rose mechanically, and followed him to the door. Nevitt still  held the forged cheque in his hand. Guy thought of it so to himself  in plain terms, as the forgery. Yet somehow, he knew not why,  he followed that sinister figure through the passage and down the  stairs like one irresistibly and magnetically drawn forward. Why,  he couldn't let any one go forth upon the streets of London--with the  cheque he himself had forged in his hands--unwatched and unshadowed.    
Nevitt called a cab; and jumped in, and beckoned him. Guy, still  as in a dream, jumped after him hastily.    
"To the London and West Country Bank, in Lombard Street," Nevitt  called through the flap.    
The cab drove off; and Guy Waring leaned back, all trembling and  irresolute, with his head on the cushions.    
At last, after a short drive, during which Guy's head seemed  to be swimming most dreamily, they reached the bank--that crowded  bank in Lombard Street. Nevitt thrust the cheque bodily into his  companion's hand.    
"Take it in, now, and cash it," he said with an authoritative air.  "Do you hear what I say? Take it in--and cash it."    
Guy, as if impelled by some superior power, walked inside the door,  and presented it timidly.    
The cashier glanced at the sum inscribed on the cheque with no  little surprise.    
"It's a rather large amount, Mr. Waring," he said, scanning his  face closely. "How will you take it?"    
Guy trembled violently from head to foot as he answered, in a voice  half choked with terror, "Bank of England hundreds, if you please.  It is a large sum, as you say; but I'm placing it elsewhere."    
The cashier retired for a few minutes; then he returned once more,  bringing a big roll of notes, and a second clerk by his side--just  to prevent mistake--stared hard at the customer. "All square,"  the second clerk said, in a half-whispered aside. "It's him right  enough."    
And the cashier proceeded to count out the notes with oft-wetted  fingers.    
Guy took them up mechanically, like a drunken man, counted them  over one by one in a strange, dazed way; and staggered out at last  to the cab to Nevitt.    
Nevitt leaned forward and took the bundle from his hands. Guy stood  on the pavement and looked vacantly in at him! "That's right," Nevitt  said, clasping the bundle tight. "Rio Negro Diamond and Sapphire  Mines, cabby, 127, Knatchbull Street, Cheapside."    
The cabman whipped up his horse and disappeared round the corner,  leaving Guy Waring alone--like a fool--on the pavement.    
For a minute or two the dazed and dazzled journalist stood there  awaking by degrees as from some trance or stupefaction. At first  he could only stand still and gaze vacantly down the street after  the disappearing cab; but as his brain cleared slowly, and the mist  that hung over his mind dispelled itself bit by bit, he was able  to walk a few steps at a time towards the nearest shops, where he  looked in at the windows intently with a hollow stare, and tried  to collect his scattered wits for a great effort at understanding  this strange transaction.    
All at once, as he looked, the full folly of his deed burst in its  true light upon his muddled brain. He had handed Nevitt six thousand  pounds in Bank of England notes; to waste, or lose, or speculate,  or run away with.    
Six--thousand--pounds of Cyril's money! Not that for one moment he  suspected Nevitt. Guy Waring was too innocent to suspect anybody.  But as he woke up more fully now to the nature of his own act,  a horrible sense of guilt and pollution crept slowly over him. He  put his hand ito his forehead. Cold sweat stood in clammy small  drops upon his brow. Bit by bit, the hateful truth dawned clearly  upon him. Nevitt had lured him by strange means, he knew not how,  into hateful crime--into a disgraceful conspiracy. Word by word,  the self-accusing sentence framed itself upon his lips.    
He spoke it out, aloud: "Why--this--is forgery!"    
Dazzled and stunned by the intensity of that awful awaking from  some weird possession or suggestion of evil by a stronger mind, Guy  Waring began to walk on in a feverish fashion, fast, fast, oh, so  fast, not knowing where he went, but conscious only that he must  keep moving, lest an accusing conscience should gnaw his very heart  out.    
Whither, he hadn't as yet the faintest idea. His whole being for  the moment was centred and summed up in that unspeakable remorse.  He had done a great wrong. He had made himself a felon. And now,  in the first recoil of his revolted nature, he must go after the  man who held the evidences of his guilt, and by force or persuasion  demand them at once from him. Those notes were Cyril's. He must  get them. He must get them.    
Possessed by this one idea, with devouring force, but still in a  very nebulous and hazy form, Guy began walking towards the Strand  and the Embankment, at the hot top of his speed, to get the notes  back--at Montague Nevitt's chambers. He had walked with fiery  zeal in that wrong direction for nearly a mile, his heart burning  within him all the way, and his brain in a whirl, before it began  to strike him, in a flash of common sense, that Montague Nevitt  wouldn't be there at all. He had driven off to the office. Guy  clapped his hand to his forehead once more, in an agony of remorse.  Great heavens, what folly! He had heard him tell the cabman the  address himself--"127, Knatchbull Street, Cheapside."    
Even now he hadn't sense enough to hail a cab and go after him. His  faculties were still numbed and entranced by that horrible spell  of Montague Nevitt's eye. He had but one thought--to walk on, walk  hastily. He tramped along the streets in the direction of Cheapside,  straining every muscle to arrive at the office before Nevitt had  parted with Cyril's six thousand--but he never even thought of  saving the precious moments by driving the distance between instead  of walking it. Montague Nevitt's personality still weighed down  half his brain, and rendered his mind almost childish or imbecile.    
Hurrying on so through the crowded streets, now walking, now running,  now pausing, now panting, knocking up here against a little knot of  wayfarers, and delayed again there by an untimely block at some  crowded crossing, he turned the corner at last with a beating  heart into the narrow pavement of an alley marked up as Knatchbull  Street. Number 127 was visible from afar.    
A mob of excited people marked its site by loitering about the door.  Two policemen held off the angrier spirits among the shareholders.  But, nothing daunted by the press, Guy forced his way in and looked  around the room trembling, for Montague Nevitt. Too late! Too late!  Nevitt wasn't there. The unhappy dupe turned to the clerk in charge.    
"Has Mr. Montague Nevitt been here?" he asked, in a voice all  tremulous with emotion.    
"Mr. Montague Nevitt?" the clerk responded. "Just gone ten minutes  ago. Came to settle Mr. Whitley's call--his brother-in-law's. Went  off in a cab. Can I do anything for you?"    
"He's paid in six thousand pounds?" Guy gasped out interrogatively.    
The clerk gazed at him hard with a suspicious glance. "Are you  a shareholder?" he asked, with one eye on the policeman. "What do  you want to know for?"    
"Yes, I'm a shareholder, unfortunately," Guy answered, still in a  maze. "I hold three hundred original shares. My name's Guy Waring.  You've got me on your books. Mr. Nevitt has paid three thousand  in Mr. Whitley's name, and three thousand for me. That was our  arrangement."    
The clerk glanced hard at him again. "Waring!" he repeated, turning  over the leaves of his big book for further verification. "Waring!  Waring! Waring! Ah, here it is; Waring, Guy; journalist; 22,  Staple Inn; 300 shares. Three hundred pounds paid. Then we call up  to three thousand. No, Mr. Nevitt didn't settle for you, sir. He  paid Mr. Whitley's call in full. That was all. Nothing else. You're  still our debtor."    
"He didn't pay up!" Guy exclaimed, clapping his hands to his head,  all the black guile and treachery of the man coining home to him  at once, at one fell blow. "He didn't pay up for me! Oh, this is  too, too terrible!"    
He paused for a moment. Floods of feeling rushed over him. He knew  now that he had committed that forgery for nothing. Cyril's money  was gone. And Montague Nevitt had stolen the three thousand Guy  intrusted to him at the bank for the second payment. Yet Guy knew  he had no legal remedy save by acknowledging the forgery! This was  almost more than human nature could stand. If Montague Nevitt had  been by his side that moment Guy would have leapt at his throat,  and it would have gone hard with him if he had left the villain  living.    
He clapped his hands to his ears in the horror and agony of that  hideous disclosure.    
"The thief!" he cried aloud, in a choking voice. "Did he pay what  he paid from a big roll of notes, and did he take the rest of the  notes in the roll away with him?"    
"Yes, just so," the clerk answered calmly. "He didn't mention your  name. But perhaps he's coming back by-and-by to settle for you."    
Guy knew better. He saw through the man's whole black nature at  once.    
"I've been robbed," he said slowly. "I've been robbed and deserted.  I must follow the man and compel him to disgorge. When I've got  the cash back I'll return and pay you. ... No, I won't, though. I  forgot. I'll take it home to the bank for Cyril."    
The clerk gazed at him with a smile of pitying contempt. Mad, mad;  quite mad! The loss of his fortune had, no doubt, unhinged this  shareholder's reason. But Guy, never heeding him, rushed out into  the street and hailed a passing cab.    
"Temple Flats," he cried aloud, and drove to Nevitt's chambers.  Too late, once more! The housekeeper told him Mr. Nevitt was out.  He'd just started off, portmanteau and all, as hard as a hansom  could drive, to Waterloo Station.    
"Waterloo, then!" Guy shouted, in wild despair, to the cabman. "We  must follow this man post haste. Alive or dead, I won't rest till  I catch him!"    
It was an unhappy phrase. In the events that came after, it was  remembered against him.
