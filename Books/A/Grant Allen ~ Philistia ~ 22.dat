'My dear,' said Dr. Greatrex, looking up in alarm from the lunch  table one morning, in the third term of Ernest Le Breton's stay  at Pilbury, 'what an awful apparition! Do you know, I positively  see Mr. Blenkinsopp, father of that odious boy Blenkinsopp major,  distinctly visible to the naked eye, walking across the front lawn--on  the grass too--to our doorway. The pupil's parent is really the  very greatest bane of all the banes that beset a poor harassed  overdriven schoolmaster's unfortunate existence!'    
'Blenkinsopp?' Mrs. Greatrex said reflectively. 'Blenkinsopp? Who  is he? Oh, I remember, a tobacco-pipe manufacturer somewhere in the  midland counties, isn't he? Mr. Blenkinsopp, of Staffordshire, I  always say to other parents--not Brosely--Brosely sounds decidedly  commercial and unpresentable. No nice people would naturally  like their sons to mix with miscellaneous boys from a place called  Brosely. Now, what on earth can he be coming here for, I wonder,  Joseph?'    
'Oh, <i>I</i> know,' the doctor answered with a deep-drawn sigh. 'I  know, Maria, only too well. It's the way of all parents. He's come  to inquire after Blenkinsopp major's health and progress. They  all do it. They seem to think the sole object of a head-master's  existence is to look after the comfort and morals of their own  particular Tommy, or Bobby, or Dicky, or Harry. For heaven's sake,  what form is Blenkinsopp major in? For heaven's sake, what's his  Christian name, and age last birthday, and place in French and  mathematics, and general state of health for past quarter? Where's  the prompt-book, with house-master's and form-master's report,  Maria? Oh, here it is, thank goodness! Let me see; let me see--he's  ringing at the door this very instant. "Blenkinsopp... major...  Charles Warrington... fifteen... fifth form... average, twelfth boy  of twelve... idle, inattentive, naturally stupid; bad disposition...  health invariably excellent... second eleven... bats well." That'll  do. Run my eye down once again, and I shall remember all about him.  How about the other? "Blenkinsopp... minor... Cyril Anastasius  Guy Waterbury Macfarlane"--heavens, what a name!... "thirteen...  fourth form... average, seventh boy of eighteen... industrious and  well-meaning, but heavy and ineffective... health good... fourth  eleven... fields badly." Ah, that's the most important one. Now I'm  primed. Blenkinsopp major I remember something about, for he's one  of the worst and most hopelessly stupid boys in the whole school--I've  caned him frequently this term, and that keeps a boy green in one's  memory; but Blenkinsopp minor, Cyril Anastasius Guy Thingumbob  Whatyoumaycallit,--I don't remember <i>him</i> a bit. I suppose he's one  of those inoffensive, mildly mediocre sort of boys who fail to  impress their individuality upon one in any way. My experience is  that you can always bear in mind the three cleverest boys at the  top of each form, and the three stupidest or most mischievous boys  at the bottom; but the nine or a dozen meritorious nobodies in the  middle of the class are all so like one another in every way that  you might as well try to discriminate between every individual  sheep of a flock in a pasture. And yet, such is the natural  contradictiousness and vexatious disposition of the British parent,  that you'll always find him coming to inquire after just one of  those very particular Tommies or Bobbies. Charles Warrington:--Cyril  Anastasius Guy Whatyoumay--call it: that'll do: I shall remember now  all about them.' And the doctor arranged his hair before the looking  glass into the most professional stiffness, as a preparatory step  to facing Mr. Blenkinsopp's parental inquiries in the head-master's  study.    
'What! Mr. Blenkinsopp! Yes, it is really. My dear sir, how <i>do</i> you  do? This is a most unexpected pleasure. We hadn't the least idea  you were in Pilbury. When did you come here?'    
'I came last night, Dr. Greatrex,' answered the dreaded parent  respectfully: 'we've come down from Staffordshire for a week at  the seaside, and we thought we might as well be within hail of Guy  and Charlie.'    
'Quite right, quite right, my dear sir,' said the doctor, mentally  noting that Blenkinsopp minor was familiarly known as Guy, not  Cyril; 'we're delighted to see you. And now you want to know all  about our two young friends, don't you?'    
'Well, yes, Dr. Greatrex; I <i>should</i> like to know how they are getting  on.'    
'Ah, of course, of course. Very right. It's such a pleasure to us  when parents give us their active and hearty co-operation! You'd  hardly believe, Mr. Blenkinsopp, how little interest some parents  seem to feel in their boys' progress. To us, you know, who devote  our whole time and energy assiduously to their ultimate welfare,  it's sometimes quite discouraging to see how very little the  parents themselves seem to care about it. But your boys are both  doing capitally. The eldest--Blenkinsopp major, we call him; Charles  Warrington, isn't it? (His home name's Charlie, if I recollect  right. Ah, quite so.) Well, Charlie's the very picture of perfect  health, as usual.' ('Health is his only strong point, it seems to  me,' the doctor thought to himself instinctively. 'We must put that  first and foremost.') 'In excellent health and very good spirits.  He's in the second eleven now, and a capital batter: I've no doubt  he'll go into the first eleven next term, if we lose Biddlecomb  Tertius to the university. In work, as you know, he's not very  great; doesn't do his abilities full justice, Mr. Blenkinsopp,  through his dreadful inattention. He's generally near the bottom of  the form, I'm sorry to say; generally near the bottom of the form.'    
'Well, I dare say there's no harm in that, sir,' said Mr. Blenkinsopp,  senior, warmly. 'I was always at the bottom of the form at school  myself, Doctor, but I've picked it up in after life; I've picked  it up, sir, as you see, and I'm fully equal with most other people  nowadays, as you'll find if you inquire of any town councilman or  man of position down our way, at Brosely.'    
'Ah, I dare say you were, Mr. Blenkinsopp,' the doctor answered  blandly, with just the faintest tinge of unconscious satire, peering  at his square unintelligent features as a fancier peers at the  face of a bull-dog; 'I dare say you were now. After all, however  clever a set of boys may be, one of them <i>must</i> be at the bottom of  the form, in the nature of things, mustn't he? And your Charlie,  I think, is only fifteen. Ah, yes; well, well; he'll do better, no  doubt, if we keep him here a year or two longer. So then there's  the second: Guy, you call him, if I remember right--Cyril Anastasius  Guy--our Blenkinsopp minor. Guy's a good boy; an excellent boy: to  tell you the plain truth, Mr. Blenkinsopp, I don't know much of him  personally myself, which is a fact that tells greatly in his favour.  Charlie I must admit I have to call up some times for reproof: Guy,  never. Charlie's in the fifth form: Guy's seventh in the fourth.  A capital place for a boy of his age! He's very industrious, you  know--what we call a plodder. They call it a plodder, you see,  at thirteen, Mr. Blenkinsopp, but a man of ability at forty.' Dr.  Greatrex delivered that last effective shot point-blank at the eyes  of the inquiring parent, and felt in a moment that its delicate  generalised flattery had gone home straight to the parent's  susceptible heart.    
'But there's one thing, Doctor,' Mr. Blenkinsopp began, after a  few minutes' further conversation on the merits and failings of Guy  and Charlie, 'there's one other thing I feel I should like to speak  to you about, and that's the teaching of your fifth form master,  Mr. Le Breton. From what Charlie tells me, I don't quite like that  young man's political ideas and opinions. It's said things to his  form sometimes that are quite horrifying, I assure you; things  about Property, and about our duty to the poor, and so on, that are  positively enough to appal you. Now, for example, he told them--I  don't quite like to repeat it, for it's sheer blasphemy I call  it--but he told them in a Greek Testament lesson that the Apostles  themselves were a sort of Republicans--Socialists, I think Charlie  said, or else Chartists, or dynamiters. I'm not sure he didn't say  St. Peter himself was a regular communist!'    
Dr. Greatrex drew a long breath. 'I should think, Mr. Blenkinsopp,'  he suggested blandly, 'Charlie must really have misunderstood Mr.  Le Breton. You see, they've been reading the Acts of the Apostles  in their Greek Testament this term. Now, of course, you remember that,  during the first days of the infant Church, while its necessities  were yet so great, as many as were possessors of lands or houses  sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  and laid them down at the apostles' feet; and distribution was  made unto every man according as he had need. You see, here's the  passage, Mr. Blenkinsopp, in the authorised version. I won't trouble  you with the original. You've forgotten most of your Greek, I dare  say: ah, I thought go. It doesn't stick to us like the Latin, does  it? Now, perhaps, in expounding that passage, Mr. Le Breton may have  referred in passing--as an illustration merely--to the unhappily  prevalent modern doctrines of socialism and communism. He may  have warned his boys, for example, against confounding a Christian  communism like this, if I may so style it, with the rapacious,  aggressive, immoral forms of communism now proposed to us, which are  based upon the forcible disregard of all Property and all vested  interests of every sort. I don't say he did, you know, for I  haven't conferred with him upon the subject: but he may have done  so; and he may even have used, as I have used, the phrase "Christian  communism," to define the temporary attitude of the apostles and  the early Church in this matter. That, perhaps, my dear sir, may  be the origin of the misapprehension.'    
Mr. Blenkinsopp looked hard at the three verses in the big Bible  the doctor had handed him, with a somewhat suspicious glare. He  was a self-made man, with land and houses of his own in plenty,  and he didn't quite like this suggestive talk about selling them  and laying the prices at the apostles' feet. It savoured to him both  of communism and priestcraft. 'That's an awkward text, you know,'  he said, looking up curiously from the Bible in his hand into the  doctor's face, 'a very awkward text; and I should say it was rather  a dangerous one to set too fully before young people. It seems  to me to make too little altogether of Property. You know, Dr.  Greatrex, at first sight it <i>does</i> look just a little like communism.'    
'Precisely what Mr. Le Breton probably said,' the doctor answered,  following up his advantage quickly. 'At first sight, no doubt, but  at first sight only, I assure you, Mr. Blenkinsopp. If you look  on to the fourth verse of the next chapter, you'll see that St.  Peter, at least, was no communist,--which is perhaps what Mr. Le  Breton really said. St. Peter there argues in favour of purely  voluntary beneficence, you observe; as when you, Mr. Blenkinsopp,  contribute a guinea to our chapel window:--you see, we're grateful  to our kind benefactors: we don't forget them. And if you'll look  at the Thirty-eighth Article of the Church of England, my dear sir,  you'll find that the riches and goods of Christians are not common,  as touching the right, title, and possession of the same as certain  Anabaptists--(Gracious heavens, is he a Baptist, I wonder?--if  so, I've put my foot in it)--certain Anabaptists do falsely  boast--referring, of course, to sundry German fanatics of the  time--followers of one Kniperdoling, a crazy enthusiast, not to  the respectable English Baptist denomination; but that nevertheless  every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to  give alms to the poor. That, you see, is the doctrine of the Church  of England, and that, I've no doubt, is the doctrine that Mr. Le  Breton pointed out to your boys as the true Christian communism of  St. Peter and the apostles.'    
'Well, I hope so, Dr. Greatrex,' Mr. Blenkinsopp answered resignedly.  'I'm sure I hope so, for his own sake, as well as for his pupils'.  Still, in these days, you know, when infidelity and Radicalism  are so rife, one ought to be on one's guard against atheism and  revolution, and attacks on Property in every form; oughtn't one,  Doctor? These opinions are getting so rampant all around us, Property  itself isn't safe. One really hardly knows what people are coming  to nowadays. Why, last night I came down here and stopped at the  Royal Marine, on the Parade, and having nothing else to do, while  my wife was looking after the little ones, I turned into a hall  down in Combe Street, where I saw a lot of placards up about a  Grand National Social Democratic meeting. Well, I turned in, Dr.  Greatrex, and there I heard a German refugee fellow from London--a  white-haired man of the name of Schurts, or something of the  sort'--Mr. Blenkinsopp pronounced it to rhyme with 'hurts'--'who  was declaiming away in a fashion to make your hair stand on end, and  frighten you half out of your wits with his dreadful communistic  notions. I assure you, he positively took my breath away. I ran out  of the hall at last, while he was still speaking, for fear the roof  should fall in upon our heads and crush us to pieces. I declare to  you, sir, I quite expected a visible judgment!'    
'Did you really now?' said Dr. Greatrex, languidly. 'Well, I dare  say, for I know there's a sad prevalence of revolutionary feeling  among our workmen here, Mr, Blenkinsopp. Now, what was this man  Schurz talking about?'    
'Why, sheer communism, sir,' said Mr. Blenkinsopp, severely: 'sheer  communism, I can tell you. Co-operation of workmen to rob their  employers of profits; gross denunciation of capital and capitalists;  and regular inciting of them against the Property of the landlords,  by quoting Scripture, too, Doctor, by quoting the very words  of Scripture. They say the devil can quote Scripture to his own  destruction, don't they, Doctor? Well, he quoted something out of  the Bible about woe unto them that join field to field, or words  to that effect, to make themselves a solitude in the midst of the  earth. Do you know, it strikes me that it's a very dangerous book,  the Bible--in the hands of these socialistic demagogues, I mean.  Look now, at that passage, and at what Mr. Le Breton said about  Christian communism!'    
'But, my dear Mr. Blenkinsopp,' the doctor cried, in a tone of  gentle deprecation, 'I hope you don't confound a person like this  man Schurz, a German refugee of the worst type, with our Mr. Le  Breton, an Oxford graduate and an English gentleman of excellent  family. I know Schurz by name through the papers: he's the author  of a dreadful book called "Gold and the Proletariate," or something  of that sort--a revolutionary work like Tom Paine's "Age of Reason,"  I believe--and he goes about the country now and then, lecturing  and agitating, to make money, no doubt, out of the poor, misguided,  credulous workmen. You quite pain me when you mention him in the  same breath with a hard-working, conscientious, able teacher like  our Mr. Le Breton.'    
'Oh,' Mr. Blenkinsopp went on, a little mollified, 'then Mr. Le  Breton's of a good family, is he? That's a great safeguard, at any  rate, for you don't find people of good family running recklessly  after these bloodthirsty doctrines, and disregarding the claims of  Property.'    
'My dear sir,' the doctor continued, 'we know his mother, Lady  Le Breton, personally. His father, Sir Owen, was a distinguished  officer-general in the Indian army in fact; and all his people are  extremely well connected with some of our best county families.  Nothing wrong about him in any way, I can answer for it. He came  here direct from Lord Exmoor's, where he'd been acting as tutor  to Viscount Lynmouth, the eldest son of the Tregellis family: and  you may be sure <i>they</i> wouldn't have anybody about them in any capacity  who wasn't thoroughly and perfectly responsible, and free from  any prejudice against the just rights of property.'    
At each successive step of this collective guarantee to Ernest  Le Breton's perfect respectability, Mr. Blenkinsopp's square face  beamed brighter and brighter, till at last when the name of Lord  Exmour was finally reached, his mouth relaxed slowly into a broad  smile, and he felt that he might implicitly trust the education  of his boys to a person so intimately bound up with the best and  highest interests of religion and Property in this kingdom. 'Of  course,' he said placidly, 'that puts quite a different complexion  upon the matter, Dr. Greatrex. I'm very glad to hear young Mr. Le  Breton's such an excellent and trustworthy person. But the fact  is, that Schurts man gave me quite a turn for the moment, with  his sanguinary notions. I wish you could see the man, sir; a long  white-haired, savage-bearded, fierce-eyed old revolutionist if ever  there was one. It made me shudder to look at him, not raving and  ranting like a madman--I shouldn't have minded so much if he'd a  done that; but talking as cool and calm and collected, Doctor, about  "eliminating the capitalist"--cutting off my head, in fact--as we  two are talking here together at this moment. His very words were,  sir, "we must eliminate the capitalist." Why, bless my soul,'--and  here Mr. Blenkinsopp rushed to the window excitedly--'who on earth's  this coming across your lawn, here, arm in arm with Mr. Le Breton,  into the school-house? Man alive, Dr. Greatrex, whatever you choose  to say, hanged if it isn't realty that German cut-throat fellow  himself, and no mistake at all about it!'    
Dr. Greatrex rose from his magisterial chair and glanced with  dignified composure out of the window. Yes, there was positively no  denying it! Ernest Le Breton, in cap and gown, with Edie by his side,  was walking arm in arm up to the school-house with a long-bearded,  large-headed German-looking man, whose placid powerful face the Doctor  immediately recognised as the one he had seen in the illustrated  papers above the name of Max Schurz, the defendant in the coming state  trial for unlawfully uttering a seditious libel! He could hardly  believe his eyes. Though he knew Ernest's opinions were dreadfully  advanced, he could not have suspected him of thus consorting with  positive murderous political criminals. In spite of his natural and  kindly desire to screen his own junior master, he felt that this  public exhibition of irreconcilable views was quite unpardonable  and irretrievable. 'Mr. Blenkinsopp,' he said gravely, turning to  the awe-struck tobacco-pipe manufacturer with an expression of  sympathetic dismay upon his practised face, 'I must retract all  I have just been saying to you about our junior master. I was not  aware of this. Mr. Le Breton must no longer retain his post as an  assistant at Pilbury Regis Grammar School.'    
Mr. Blenkinsopp sank amazed into an easy-chair, and sat in dumb  astonishment to see the end of this extraordinary and unprecedented  adventure. The Doctor walked out severely to the school porch, and  stood there in solemn state to await the approach of the unsuspecting  offender.    
'It's so delightful, dear Herr Max,' Ernest was saying at that exact  moment, 'to have you down here with us even for a single night.  You can't imagine what an oasis your coming has been to us both.  I'm sure Edie has enjoyed it just as much as I have, and is just  as anxious you should stop a little time here with us as I myself  could possibly be.    
'Oh, yes, Herr Schurz,' Edie put in persuasively with her sweet  little pleading manner; 'do stay a little longer. I don't know  when dear Ernest has enjoyed anything in the world so much as he  has enjoyed seeing you. You've no idea how dull it is down here for  him, and for me too, for that matter; everybody here is so borne,  and narrow-minded and self-centred; nothing expansive or sympathetic  about them, as there used to be about Ernest's set in dear, quiet,  peaceable old Oxford. It's been such a pleasure to us to hear some  conversation again that wasn't about the school, and the rector, and  the Haigh Park people, and the flower show, and old Mrs. Jenkins's  quarrel with the vicar of St. Barnabas. Except when Mr. Berkeley  runs down sometimes for a Saturday to Monday trip to see us, and  takes Ernest out for a good blow with him on the top of the breezy  downs over yonder, we really never hear anything at all except the  gossip and the small-talk of Pilbury Regis.'    
'And what makes it worse, Herr Max,' said Ernest, looking up in  the old man's calm strong face with the same reverent almost filial  love and respect as ever, 'is the fact that I can't feel any real  interest and enthusiasm in the work that's set before me. I try  to do it as well as I can, and I believe Dr. Greatrex, who's a  kind-hearted good sort of man in his way, is perfectly satisfied  with it; but my heart isn't in it, you see, and can't be in it.  What sort of good is one doing the world by dinning the same foolish  round of Horace and Livy and Latin elegiacs into the heads of all  these useless, eat-all, do-nothing young fellows, who'll only be  fit to fight or preach or idle as soon as we've finished cramming  them with our indigestible unserviceable nostrums!'    
'Ah, Ernest, Ernest,' said Herr Max, nodding his heavy head gravely,  'you always <i>will</i> look too seriously altogether at your social  duties. I can't get other people to do it enough; and I can't get  you not to do it too much entirely. Remember, my dear boy, my pet  old saying about a little leaven. You're doing more good by just  unobtrusively holding your own opinions here at Pilbury, and getting  in the thin end of the wedge by slowly influencing the minds of  a few middle-class boys in your form, than you could possibly be  doing by making shoes or weaving clothes for the fractional benefit  of general humanity. Don't be so abstract, Ernest; concrete yourself a  little; isn't it enough that you're earning a livelihood for your  dear little wife here, whom I'm glad to know at last and to receive  as a worthy daughter? I may call you, Edie, mayn't I, my daughter?  So this is your school, is it? A pleasant building! And that  stern-looking old gentleman yonder, I suppose, is your head master?'    
'Dr. Greatrex,' said Edie innocently, stepping up to him in her bright  elastic fashion, 'let me introduce you to our friend Herr Schurz,  whose name I dare say you know--the German political economist.  He's come down to Pilbury to deliver a lecture here, and we've been  fortunate enough to put him up at our little lodging.'    
The doctor bowed very stiffly. 'I have heard of Herr Schurz's  reputation already,' he said with as much diplomatic politeness  as he could command, fortunately bethinking himself at the right  moment of the exact phrase that would cover the situation without  committing him to any further courtesy towards the terrible stranger.  'Will you excuse my saying, Mrs. Le Breton, that we're very busy  this afternoon, and I want to have a few words with your husband  in private immediately? Perhaps you'd better take Herr Schurz on  to the downs' ('safer there than on the Parade, at any rate,' he  thought to himself quickly), 'and Le Breton will join you in the  combe a little later in the afternoon. I'll take the fifth form  myself, and let him have a holiday with his friend here if he'd  like one. Le Breton, will you step this way please?' And lifting  his square cap with stern solemnity to Edie, the doctor disappeared  under the porch into the corridor, closely followed by poor frightened  and wondering Ernest.    
Edie looked at Herr Max in dismay, for she saw clearly there was  something serious the matter with the doctor. The old man shook  his head sadly. 'It was very wrong of me,' he said bitterly: 'very  wrong and very thoughtless. I ought to have remembered it and  stopped away. I'm a caput lupinum, it seems, in Pilbury Regis, a  sort of moral scarecrow or political leper, to be carefully avoided  like some horrid contagion by a respectable, prosperous head-master.  I might have known it, I might have known it, Edie; and now I'm  afraid by my stupidity I've got dear Ernest unintentionally into  a pack of troubles. Come on, my child, my poor dear child, come on  to the downs, as he told us; I won't compromise you any longer by  being seen with you in the streets, in the decent decorous whited  sepulchres of Pilbury Regis.' And the grey old apostle, with two  tears trickling unreproved down his wrinkled cheek, took Edie's arm  tenderly in his, and led her like a father up to the green grassy  slope that overlooks the little seaward combe by the nestling  village of Nether Pilbury.    
Meanwhile, Dr. Greatrex had taken Ernest into the breakfast-room--the  study was already monopolised by Mr. Blenkinsopp--and had seated himself  nervously, with his hands folded before him, on a straight-backed  chair There was a long and awkward pause, for the doctor didn't  care to begin the interview; but at last he sighed deeply and said  in a tone of genuine disappointment and difficulty, 'My dear Le  Breton, this is really very unpleasant.'    
Ernest looked at him, and said nothing.    
'Do you know,' the doctor went on kindly after a minute, 'I really  do like you and sympathise with you. But what am I to do after  this? I can't keep you at the school any longer, can I now? I put  it to your own common-sense. I'm afraid, Le Breton--it gives me  sincere pain to say so--but I'm afraid we must part at the end of  the quarter.'    
Ernest only muttered that he was very sorry.    
'But what are we to do about it, Le Breton?' the doctor continued  more kindly than ever. 'What are we ever to do about it? For my own  sake, and for the boys' sake, and for respectability's pake, it's  quite impossible to let you remain here any longer. The first thing  you must do is to send away this Schurz creature'--Ernest started  a little--'and then we must try to let it blow over as best we can.  Everybody'll be talking about it; you know the man's become quite  notorious lately; and it'll be quite necessary to say distinctly,  Le Breton, before the whole of Pilbury, that we've been obliged to  dismiss you summarily. So much we positively <i>must</i> do for our own  protection. But what on earth are we to do for you, my poor fellow?  I'm afraid you've cut your own throat, and I don't see any way on  earth out of it.'    
'How so?' asked Ernest, half stunned by the suddenness of this  unexpected dismissal.    
'Why, just look the thing in the face yourself, Le Breton. I can't  very well give you a recommendation to any other head master without  mentioning to him why I had to ask you for your resignation. And  I'm afraid if I told them, nobody else would ever take you.'    
'Indeed?' said Ernest, very softly. 'Is it such a heinous offence  to know so good a man as Herr Schurz--the best follower of the  apostles I ever knew?'    
'My dear fellow,' said the doctor, confidentially, with an unusual  burst of outspoken frankness, 'so far as my own private feelings  are concerned, I don't in the least object to your knowing Herr  Schurz or any other socialist whatsoever. To tell you the truth,  I dare say he really is an excellent and most well-meaning person  at bottom. Between ourselves, I've always thought that there was  nothing very heterodox in socialism; in fact, I often think, Le  Breton, the Bible's the most thoroughly democratic book that ever  was written. But we haven't got to deal in practice with first  principles; we have to deal with Society--with men and women as we  find them. Now, Society doesn't like your Herr Schurz, objects to  him, anathematises him, wants to imprison him. If you walk about  with him in public, Society won't send its sons to your school.  Therefore, you should disguise your affection, and if you want to  visit him, you should visit him, like Nicodemus, by night only.'    
'I'm afraid,' said Ernest very fixedly, 'I shall never be able so  far to accommodate myself to the wishes of Society.'    
'I'm afraid not, myself, Le Breton,' the doctor went on with  imperturbable good temper. 'I'm afraid not, and I'm sorry for  it. The fact is, you've chosen the wrong profession. You haven't  pliability enough for a schoolmaster; you're too isolated, too much  out of the common run; your ideas are too peculiar. Now, you've got  me to-day into a dreadful pickle, and I might very easily be angry  with you about it, and part with you in bad blood; but I really  like you, Le Breton, and I don't want to do that; so I only tell  you plainly, you've mistaken your natural calling. What it can be  I don't know; but we must put our two heads together, and see what  we can do for you before the end of the quarter. Now, go up to the  combe to your wife, and try to get that terrible bugbear of a German  out of Pilbury as quickly and as quietly as possible. Good-bye for  to-day, Le Breton; no coolness between us, for this, I hope, my  dear fellow.'    
Ernest grasped his hand warmly. 'You're very kind, Dr. Greatrex,'  he said with genuine feeling. 'I see you mean well by me, and I'm  very, very sorry if I've unintentionally caused you any embarrassment.'    
'Not at all, not at all, my dear fellow. Don't mention it. We'll  tide it over somehow, and I'll see whether I can get you anything  else to do that you're better fitted for.'    
As the door closed on Ernest, the doctor just gently wiped a certain  unusual dew off his gold spectacles with a corner of his spotless  handkerchief. 'He's a good fellow,' he murmured to himself,  'an excellent fellow; but he doesn't manage to combine with the  innocence of the dove the wisdom of the serpent. Poor boy, poor  boy, I'm afraid he'll sink, but we must do what we can to keep his  chin floating above the water. And now I must go back to the study  to have out my explanation with that detestable thick-headed old  pig of a Blenkinsopp! "Your views about young Le Breton," I must  say to him, "are unfortunately only too well founded; and I have  been compelled to dismiss him this very hour from Pilbury Grammar  School." Ugh--how humiliating! the profession's really enough to  give one a perfect sickening of life altogether!'
