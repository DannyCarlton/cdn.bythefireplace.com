  James Kent, among his other qualities good and bad, possessed a   merciless opinion of his own shortcomings, but never, in that   opinion, had he fallen so low as in the interval which immediately   followed the closing of his door behind the mysterious girl who  had  told him that her name was Marette Radisson. No sooner was she  gone  than the overwhelming superiority of her childlike cleverness  smote  him until, ashamed of himself, he burned red in his  aloneness. 
  He, Sergeant Kent, the coolest man on the force next to Inspector   Kedsty, the most dreaded of catechists when questioning criminals,   the man who had won the reputation of facing quietly and with  deadly  sureness the most menacing of dangers, had been beaten&#8212;  horribly  beaten&#8212;by a girl! And yet, in defeat, an irrepressible  and at times  distorted sense of humor made him give credit to the  victor. The shame  of the thing was his acknowledgment that a bit  of feminine beauty had  done the trick. He had made fun of O'Connor  when the big  staff-sergeant had described the effect of the girl's  eyes on  Inspector Kedsty. And, now, if O'Connor could know of what  had  happened here&#8212; 
  And then, like a rubber ball, that saving sense of humor bounced   up out of the mess, and Kent found himself chuckling as his face  grew  cooler. His visitor had come, and she had gone, and he knew  no more  about her than when she had entered his room, except that  her very  pretty name was Marette Radisson. He was just beginning  to think of  the questions he had wanted to ask, a dozen, half a  hundred of  them&#8212;more definitely who she was; how and why she had  come to  Athabasca Landing; her interest in Sandy McTrigger; the  mysterious  relationship that must surely exist between her and  Inspector Kedsty;  and, chiefly, her real motive in coming to him  when she knew that he  was dying. He comforted himself by the  assurance that he would have  learned these things had she not left  him so suddenly. He had not  expected that. 
  The question which seated itself most insistently in his mind was,   why had she come? Was it, after all, merely a matter of curiosity?   Was her relationship to Sandy McTrigger such that inquisitiveness   alone had brought her to see the man who had saved him? Surely she   had not been urged by a sense of gratitude, for in no way had she   given expression to that. On his death-bed she had almost made fun  of  him. And she could not have come as a messenger from McTrigger,  or she  would have left her message. For the first time he began to  doubt that  she knew the man at all, in spite of the strange thing  that had  happened under O'Connor's eyes. But she must know Kedsty.  She had made  no answer to his half-accusation that she was hiding  up at the  Inspector's bungalow. He had used that word&#8212;&quot;hiding.&quot;  It should have  had an effect. And she was as beautifully  unconscious of it as though  she had not heard him, and he knew  that she had heard him very  distinctly. It was then that she had  given him that splendid view of  her amazingly long lashes and had  countered softly, 
  &quot;What if you shouldn't die?&quot; 
  Kent felt himself suddenly aglow with an irresistible appreciation   of the genius of her subtlety, and with that appreciation came a   thrill of deeper understanding. He believed that he knew why she  had  left him so suddenly. It was because she had seen herself  close to the  danger-line. There were things which she did not want  him to know or  question her about, and his daring intimation that  she was hiding in  Kedsty's bungalow had warned her. Was it  possible that Kedsty himself  had sent her for some reason which he  could not even guess at?  Positively it was not because of  McTrigger, the man he had saved. At  least she would have thanked  him in some way. She would not have  appeared quite so adorably  cold-blooded, quite so sweetly unconscious  of the fact that he was  dying. If McTrigger's freedom had meant  anything to her, she could  not have done less than reveal to him a bit  of sympathy. And her  greatest compliment, if he excepted the kiss, was  that she had  called him a splendid liar! 
  Kent grimaced and drew in a deep breath because of the tightness   in his chest. Why was it that every one seemed to disbelieve him?  Why  was it that even this mysterious girl, whom he had never seen  before  in his life, politely called him a liar when he insisted  that he had  killed John Barkley? Was the fact of murder  necessarily branded in  one's face? If so, he had never observed  it. Some of the hardest  criminals he had brought in from the down-  river country were  likable-looking men. There was Horrigan, for  instance, who for seven  long weeks kept him in good humor with his  drollery, though he was  bringing him in to be hanged. And there  were McTab, and le Bete  Noir&#8212;the Black Beast&#8212;a lovable vagabond  in spite of his record, and  Le Beau, the gentlemanly robber of the  wilderness mail, and half a  dozen others he could recall without  any effort at all. No one called  them liars when, like real men,  they confessed their crimes when they  saw their game was up. To a  man they had given up the ghost with their  boots on, and Kent  respected their memory because of it. And he was  dying&#8212;and even  this stranger girl called him a liar? And no case had  ever been  more complete than his own. He had gone mercilessly into the   condemning detail of it all. It was down in black and white. He  had  signed it. And still he was disbelieved. It was funny, deuced  funny,  thought Kent. 
  Until young Mercer opened the door and came in with his late   breakfast, he had forgotten that he had really been hungry when he   awakened with Cardigan's stethoscope at his chest. Mercer had  amused  him from the first. The pink-faced young Englishman, fresh  from the  old country, could not conceal in his face and attitude  the fact that  he was walking in the presence of the gallows  whenever he entered the  room. He was, as he had confided in  Cardigan, &quot;beastly hit up&quot; over  the thing. To feed and wash a man  who would undoubtedly die, but who  would be hanged by the neck  until he was dead if he lived, filled him  with peculiar and at  times conspicuous emotions. It was like attending  to a living  corpse, if such a thing could be conceived. And Mercer had   conceived it. Kent had come to regard him as more or less of a   barometer giving away Cardigan's secrets. He had not told  Cardigan,  but had kept the discovery for his own amusement. 
  This morning Mercer's face was less pink, and his pale eyes were   paler, Kent thought. Also he started to sprinkle sugar on his eggs  in  place of salt. 
  Kent laughed and stopped his hand. &quot;You may sugar my eggs when I'm   dead, Mercer,&quot; he said, &quot;but while I'm alive I want salt on 'em!  Do  you know, old man, you look bad this morning. Is it because  this is my  last breakfast?&quot; 
  &quot;I hope not, sir, I hope not,&quot; replied Mercer quickly. &quot;Indeed, I   hope you are going to live, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Thanks!&quot; said Kent dryly. &quot;Where is Cardigan?&quot; 
  &quot;The Inspector sent a messenger for him, sir. I think he has gone   to see him. Are your eggs properly done, sir?&quot; 
  &quot;Mercer, if you ever worked in a butler's pantry, for the love of   heaven forget it now!&quot; exploded Kent, &quot;I want you to tell me   something straight out. How long have I got?&quot; 
  Mercer fidgeted for a moment, and a shade or two more of the red   went out of his face. &quot;I can't say, sir. Doctor Cardigan hasn't  told  me. But I think not very long, sir. Doctor Cardigan is cut up  all in  rags this morning. And Father Layonne is coming to see you  at any  moment.&quot; 
  &quot;Much obliged,&quot; nodded Kent, calmly beginning his second egg.   &quot;And, by the way, what did you think of the young lady?&quot; 
  &quot;Ripping, positively ripping!&quot; exclaimed Mercer. 
  &quot;That's the word,&quot; agreed Kent. &quot;Ripping. It sounds like the   calico counter in a dry-goods store, but means a lot. Don't happen  to  know where she is staying or why she is at the Landing, do  you?&quot; 
  He knew that he was asking a foolish question and scarcely   expected an answer from Mercer. He was astonished when the other   said: 
  &quot;I heard Doctor Cardigan ask her if we might expect her to honor   us with another visit, and she told him it would be impossible,   because she was leaving on a down-river scow tonight. Fort  Simpson, I  think she said she was going to, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;The deuce you say!&quot; cried Kent, spilling a bit of his coffee in   the thrill of the moment. &quot;Why, that's where Staff-Sergeant  O'Connor  is bound for!&quot; 
  &quot;So I heard Doctor Cardigan tell her. But she didn't reply to   that. She just&#8212;went. If you don't mind a little joke in your  present  condition, sir, I might say that Doctor Cardigan was  considerably  flayed up over her. A deuced pretty girl, sir, deuced  pretty! And I  think he was shot through!&quot; 
  &quot;Now you're human, Mercer. She was pretty, wasn't she?&quot; 
  &quot;Er&#8212;yes&#8212;stunningly so, Mr. Kent,&quot; agreed Mercer, reddening   suddenly to the roots of his pasty, blond hair. &quot;I don't mind   confessing that in this unusual place her appearance was quite   upsetting.&quot; 
  &quot;I agree with you, friend Mercer,&quot; nodded Kent. &quot;She upset me.   And&#8212;see here, old man!&#8212;will you do a dying man the biggest favor  he  ever asked in his life?&quot; 
  &quot;I should be most happy, sir, most happy.&quot; 
  &quot;It's this,&quot; said Kent. &quot;I want to know if that girl actually   leaves on the down-river scow tonight. If I'm alive tomorrow  morning,  will you tell me?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall do my best, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Good. It's simply the silly whim of a dying man, Mercer. But I   want to be humored in it. And I'm sensitive&#8212;like yourself. I  don't  want Cardigan to know. There's an old Indian named Mooie,  who lives in  a shack just beyond the sawmill. Give him ten dollars  and tell him  there is another ten in it if he sees the business  through, and  reports properly to you, and keeps his mouth shut  afterward. Here&#8212;the  money is under my pillow.&quot; 
  Kent pulled out a wallet and put fifty dollars in Mercer's hands. 
  &quot;Buy cigars with the rest of it, old man. It's of no more use to   me. And this little trick you are going to pull off is worth it.  It's  my last fling on earth, you might say.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir. It is very kind of you.&quot; 
  Mercer belonged to a class of wandering Englishmen typical of the   Canadian West, the sort that sometimes made real Canadians wonder  why  a big and glorious country like their own should cling to the  mother  country. Ingratiating and obsequiously polite at all times,  he gave  one the impression of having had splendid training as a  servant, yet  had this intimation been made to him, he would have  become highly  indignant. Kent had learned their ways pretty well.  He had met them in  all sorts of places, for one of their  inexplicable characteristics was  the recklessness and apparent  lack of judgment with which they located  themselves. Mercer, for  instance, should have held a petty clerical  job of some kind in a  city, and here he was acting as nurse in the  heart of a  wilderness! 
  After Mercer had gone with the breakfast things and the money,   Kent recalled a number of his species. And he knew that under  their  veneer of apparent servility was a thing of courage and  daring which  needed only the right kind of incentive to rouse it.  And when roused,  it was peculiarly efficient in a secretive,  artful-dodger sort of way.  It would not stand up before a gun. But  it would creep under the  mouths of guns on a black night. And Kent  was positive his fifty  dollars would bring him results&#8212;if he  lived. 
  Just why he wanted the information he was after, he could not have   told himself. It was a pet aphorism between O'Connor and him that   they had often traveled to success on the backs of their hunches.  And  his proposition to Mercer was made on the spur of one of those  moments  when the spirit of a hunch possessed him. His morning had  been one of  unexpected excitement, and now he leaned back in an  effort to review  it and to forget, if he could, the distressing  thing that was bound to  happen to him within the next few hours.  But he could not get away  from the thickening in his chest. It  seemed growing on him. Now and  then he was compelled to make quite  an effort to get sufficient air  into his lungs. 
  He found himself wondering if there was a possibility that the   girl might return. For a long time he lay thinking about her, and  it  struck him as incongruous and in bad taste that fate should  have left  this adventure for his last. If he had met her six  months ago&#8212;or even  three&#8212;it was probable that she would so have  changed the events of  life for him that he would not have got the  half-breed's bullet in his  chest. He confessed the thing  unblushingly. The wilderness had taken  the place of woman for him.  It had claimed him, body and soul. He had  desired nothing beyond  its wild freedom and its never-ending games of  chance. He had  dreamed, as every man dreams, but realities and not the  dreams had  been the red pulse of his life. And yet, if this girl had  come  sooner&#8212; 
  He revisioned for himself over and over again her hair and eyes,   the slimness of her as she had stood at the window, the freedom  and  strength of that slender body, the poise of her exquisite  head, and he  felt again the thrill of her hand and the still more  wonderful thrill  of her lips as she had pressed them warmly upon  his. 
  AND SHE WAS OF THE NORTH! That was the thought that overwhelmed   him. He did not permit himself to believe that she might have told   him an untruth. He was confident, if he lived until tomorrow, that   Mercer would corroborate his faith in her. He had never heard of a   place called the Valley of Silent Men, but it was a big country,  and  Fort Simpson with its Hudson Bay Company's post and its half-  dozen  shacks was a thousand miles away. He was not sure that such  a place as  that valley really existed. It was easier to believe  that the girl's  home was at Fort Providence, Fort Simpson, Fort  Good Hope, or even at  Fort McPherson. It was not difficult for him  to picture her as the  daughter of one of the factor lords of the  North. Yet this, upon  closer consideration, he gave up as  unreasonable. The word &quot;Fort&quot; did  not stand for population, and  there were probably not more than fifty  white people at all the  posts between the Great Slave and the Arctic.  She was not one of  these, or the fact would have been known at the  Landing. 
  Neither could she be a riverman's daughter, for it was   inconceivable that either a riverman or a trapper would have sent   this girl down into civilization, where this girl had undoubtedly   been. It was that point chiefly which puzzled Kent. She was not  only  beautiful. She had been tutored in schools that were not  taught by  wilderness missioners. In her, it seemed to him, he had  seen the  beauty and the wild freedom of the forests as they had  come to him  straight out of the heart of an ancient aristocracy  that was born  nearly two hundred years ago in the old cities of  Quebec and Montreal. 
  His mind flashed back at that thought: he remembered the time when   he had sought out every nook and cranny of that ancient town of   Quebec, and had stood over graves two centuries old, and deep in  his  soul had envied the dead the lives they had lived. He had  always  thought of Quebec as a rare old bit of time-yellowed lace  among  cities&#8212;the heart of the New World as it had once been,  still beating,  still whispering of its one-time power, still  living in the memory of  its mellowed romance, its almost forgotten  tragedies&#8212;a ghost that  lived, that still beat back defiantly the  destroying modernism that  would desecrate its sacred things. And  it pleased him to think of  Marette Radisson as the spirit of it,  wandering north, and still  farther north&#8212;even as the spirits of  the profaned dead had risen from  the Landing to go farther on. 
  And feeling that the way had at last been made easy for him, Kent   smiled out into the glorious day and whispered softly, as if she  were  standing there, listening to him: 
  &quot;If I had lived&#8212;I would have called you&#8212;my Quebec. It's pretty,   that name. It stands for a lot. And so do you.&quot; 
  And out in the hall, as Kent whispered those words, stood Father   Layonne, with a face that was whiter than the mere presence of  death  had ever made it before. At his side stood Cardigan, aged  ten years  since he had placed his stethoscope at Kent's chest that  morning. And  behind these two were Kedsty, with a face like gray  rock, and young  Mercer, in whose staring eyes was the horror of a  thing he could not  yet quite comprehend. Cardigan made an effort  to speak and failed.  Kedsty wiped his forehead, as he had wiped it  the morning of Kent's  confession. And Father Layonne, as he went  to Kent's door, was  breathing softly to himself a prayer.
