"Man overboard!"    
It rang in Felix Thurstan's ears like the sound of a bell. He gazed about  him in dismay, wondering what had happened.    
The first intimation he received of the accident was that sudden sharp  cry from the bo'sun's mate. Almost before he had fully taken it in, in  all its meaning, another voice, farther aft, took up the cry once more in  an altered form: "A lady! a lady! Somebody overboard! Great heavens, it  is <i>her</i>! It's Miss Ellis! Miss Ellis!"    
Next instant Felix found himself, he knew not how, struggling in a wild  grapple with the dark, black water. A woman was clinging to him--clinging  for dear life. But he couldn't have told you himself that minute how it  all took place. He was too stunned and dazzled.    
He looked around him on the seething sea in a sudden awakening, as it  were, to life and consciousness. All about, the great water stretched  dark and tumultuous. White breakers surged over him. Far ahead the  steamer's lights gleamed red and green in long lines upon the ocean. At  first they ran fast; then they slackened somewhat. She was surely slowing  now; they must be reversing engines and trying to stop her. They would  put out a boat. But what hope, what chance of rescue by night, in such a  wild waste of waves as that? And Muriel Ellis was clinging to him for  dear life all the while, with the despairing clutch of a half-drowned  woman!    
The people on the Australasian, for their part, knew better what had  occurred. There was bustle and confusion enough on deck and on the  captain's bridge, to be sure: "Man overboard!"--three sharp rings at the  engine bell:--"Stop her short!--reverse engines!--lower the gig!--look  sharp, there, all of you!" Passengers hurried up breathless at the first  alarm to know what was the matter. Sailors loosened and lowered the boat  from the davits with extraordinary quickness. Officers stood by, giving  orders in monosyllables with practised calm. All was hurry and turmoil,  yet with a marvellous sense of order and prompt obedience as well. But,  at any rate, the people on deck hadn't the swift swirl of the boisterous  water, the hampering wet clothes, the pervading consciousness of personal  danger, to make their brains reel, like Felix Thurstan's. They could ask  one another with comparative composure what had happened on board; they  could listen without terror to the story of the accident.    
It was the thirteenth day out from Sydney, and the Australasian was  rapidly nearing the equator. Toward evening the wind had freshened, and  the sea was running high against her weather side. But it was a fine  starlit night, though the moon had not yet risen; and as the brief  tropical twilight faded away by quick degrees in the west, the fringe of  cocoanut palms on the reef that bounded the little island of Boupari  showed out for a minute or two in dark relief, some miles to leeward,  against the pale pink horizon. In spite of the heavy sea, many passengers  lingered late on deck that night to see the last of that coral-girt  shore, which was to be their final glimpse of land till they reached  Honolulu, <i>en route</i> for San Francisco.    
Bit by bit, however, the cocoanut palms, silhouetted with their graceful  waving arms for a few brief minutes in black against the glowing  background, merged slowly into the sky or sank below the horizon. All  grew dark. One by one, as the trees disappeared, the passengers dropped  off for whist in the saloon, or retired to the uneasy solitude of their  own state-rooms. At last only two or three men were left smoking and  chatting near the top of the companion ladder; while at the stern of the  ship Muriel Ellis looked over toward the retreating island, and talked  with a certain timid maidenly frankness to Felix Thurstan.    
There's nowhere on earth for getting really to know people in a very  short time like the deck of a great Atlantic or Pacific liner. You're  thrown together so much, and all day long, that you see more of your  fellow-passengers' inner life and nature in a few brief weeks than you  would ever be likely to see in a long twelvemonth of ordinary town or  country acquaintanceship. And Muriel Ellis had seen a great deal in those  thirteen days of Felix Thurstan; enough to make sure in her own heart  that she really liked him--well--so much that she looked up with a pretty  blush of self-consciousness every time he approached and lifted his hat  to her. Muriel was an English rector's daughter, from a country village  in Somersetshire; and she was now on her way back from a long year's  visit, to recruit her health, to an aunt in Paramatta. She was travelling  under the escort of an amiable old chaperon whom the aunt in question had  picked up for her before leaving Sydney; but, as the amiable old  chaperon, being but an indifferent sailor, spent most of her time in her  own berth, closely attended by the obliging stewardess, Muriel had found  her chaperonage interfere very little with opportunities of talk with  that nice Mr. Thurstan. And now, as the last glow of sunset died out in  the western sky, and the last palm-tree faded away against the colder  green darkness of the tropical night, Muriel was leaning over the  bulwarks in confidential mood, and watching the big waves advance or  recede, and talking the sort of talk that such an hour seems to favor  with the handsome young civil servant who stood on guard, as it were,  beside her. For Felix Thurstan held a government appointment at Levuka,  in Fiji, and was now on his way home, on leave of absence after six  years' service in that new-made colony.    
"How delightful it would be to live on an island like that!" Muriel  murmured, half to herself, as she gazed out wistfully in the direction of  the disappearing coral reef. "With those beautiful palms waving always  over one's head, and that delicious evening air blowing cool through  their branches! It looks such a Paradise!"    
Felix smiled and glanced down at her, as he steadied himself with one  hand against the bulwark, while the ship rolled over into the trough of  the sea heavily. "Well, I don't know about that, Miss Ellis," he answered  with a doubtful air, eying her close as he spoke with eyes of evident  admiration. "One might be happy anywhere, of course--in suitable society;  but if you'd lived as long among cocoanuts in Fiji as I have, I dare say  the poetry of these calm palm-grove islands would be a little less real  to you. Remember, though they look so beautiful and dreamy against the  sky like that, at sunset especially (that was a heavy one, that time;  I'm really afraid we must go down to the cabin soon; she'll be shipping  seas before long if we stop on deck much later--and yet, it's so  delightful stopping up here till the dusk comes on, isn't it?)--well,  remember, I was saying, though they look so beautiful and dreamy and  poetical--'Summer isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea,' and  all that sort of thing--these islands are inhabited by the fiercest and  most bloodthirsty cannibals known to travellers."    
"Cannibals!" Muriel repeated, looking up at him in surprise. "You don't  mean to say that islands like these, standing right in the very track of  European steamers, are still heathen and cannibal?"    
"Oh, dear, yes," Felix replied, holding his hand out as he spoke to catch  his companion's arm gently, and steady her against the wave that was just  going to strike the stern: "Excuse me; just so; the sea's rising fast,  isn't it?--Oh, dear, yes; of course they are; they're all heathen and  cannibals. You couldn't imagine to yourself the horrible bloodthirsty  rites that may this very minute be taking place upon that idyllic-looking  island, under the soft waving branches of those whispering palm-trees.  Why, I knew a man in the Marquesas myself--a hideous old native, as ugly  as you can fancy him--who was supposed to be a god, an incarnate god, and  was worshipped accordingly with profound devotion by all the other  islanders. You can't picture to yourself how awful their worship was. I  daren't even repeat it to you; it was too, too horrible. He lived in a  hut by himself among the deepest forest, and human victims used to be  brought--well, there, it's too loathsome! Why, see; there's a great light  on the island now; a big bonfire or something; don't you make it out? You  can tell it by the red glare in the sky overhead." He paused a moment;  then he added more slowly, "I shouldn't be surprised if at this very  moment, while we're standing here in such perfect security on the deck of  a Christian English vessel, some unspeakable and unthinkable heathen orgy  mayn't be going on over there beside that sacrificial fire; and if some  poor trembling native girl isn't being led just now, with blows and  curses and awful savage ceremonies, her hands bound behind her back--Oh,  look out, Miss Ellis!"    
He was only just in time to utter the warning words. He was only just in  time to put one hand on each side of her slender waist, and hold her  tight so, when the big wave which he saw coming struck full tilt against  the vessel's flank, and broke in one white drenching sheet of foam  against her stern and quarter-deck.    
The suddenness of the assault took Felix's breath away. For the first few  seconds he was only aware that a heavy sea had been shipped, and had wet  him through and through with its unexpected deluge. A moment later, he  was dimly conscious that his companion had slipped from his grasp, and  was nowhere visible. The violence of the shock, and the slimy nature of  the sea water, had made him relax his hold without knowing it, in the  tumult of the moment, and had at the same time caused Muriel to glide  imperceptibly through his fingers, as he had often known an ill-caught  cricket-ball do in his school-days. Then he saw he was on his hands and  knees on the deck. The wave had knocked him down, and dashed him against  the bulwark on the leeward side. As he picked himself up, wet, bruised,  and shaken, he looked about for Muriel. A terrible dread seized upon his  soul at once. Impossible! Impossible! she couldn't have been washed  overboard!    
And even as he gazed about, and held his bruised elbow in his hand, and  wondered to himself what it could all mean, that sudden loud cry arose  beside him from the quarter-deck, "Man overboard! Man overboard!"  followed a moment later by the answering cry, from the men who were  smoking under the lee of the companion, "A lady! a lady! It's Miss Ellis!  Miss Ellis!"    
He didn't take it all in. He didn't reflect. He didn't even know he was  actually doing it. But he did it, all the same, with the simple,  straightforward, instinctive sense of duty which makes civilized man act  aright, all unconsciously, in any moment of supreme danger and  difficulty. Leaping on to the taffrail without one instant's delay, and  steadying himself for an indivisible fraction of time with his hand on  the rope ladder, he peered out into the darkness with keen eyes for a  glimpse of Muriel Ellis's head above the fierce black water; and espying  it for one second, as she came up on a white crest, he plunged in before  the vessel had time to roll back to windward, and struck boldly out in  the direction where he saw that helpless object dashed about like a cork  on the surface of the ocean.    
Only those who have known such accidents at sea can possibly picture to  themselves the instantaneous haste with which all that followed took  place upon that bustling quarter-deck. Almost at the first cry of "Man  overboard!" the captain's bell rang sharp and quick, as if by magic, with  three peremptory little calls in the engine-room below. The Australasian  was going at full speed, but in a marvellously short time, as it seemed  to all on board, the great ship had slowed down to a perfect standstill,  and then had reversed her engines, so that she lay, just nose to the  wind, awaiting further orders. In the meantime, almost as soon as the  words were out of the bo'sun's lips, a sailor amidships had rushed to the  safety belts hung up by the companion ladder, and had flung half a dozen  of them, one after another, with hasty but well-aimed throws, far, far  astern, in the direction where Felix had disappeared into the black  water. The belts were painted white, and they showed for a few seconds,  as they fell, like bright specks on the surface of the darkling sea; then  they sunk slowly behind as the big ship, still not quite stopped,  ploughed her way ahead with gigantic force into the great abyss of  darkness in front of her.    
It seemed but a minute, too, to the watchers on board, before a party of  sailors, summoned by the whistle with that marvellous readiness to meet  any emergency which long experience of sudden danger has rendered  habitual among seafaring men, had lowered the boat, and taken their seats  on the thwarts, and seized their oars, and were getting under way on  their hopeless quest of search, through the dim black night, for those  two belated souls alone in the midst of the angry Pacific.    
It seemed but a minute or two, I say, to the watchers on board; but oh,  what an eternity of time to Felix Thurstan, struggling there with his  live burden in the seething water!    
He had dashed into the ocean, which was dark, but warm with tropical  heat, and had succeeded, in spite of the heavy seas then running, in  reaching Muriel, who clung to him now with all the fierce clinging of  despair, and impeded his movement through that swirling water. More than  that, he saw the white life-belts that the sailors flung toward him; they  were well and aptly flung, in the inspiration of the moment, to allow for  the sea itself carrying them on the crest of its waves toward the two  drowning creatures. Felix saw them distinctly, and making a great lunge  as they passed, in spite of Muriel's struggles, which sadly hampered his  movements, he managed to clutch at no less than three before the great  billow, rolling on, carried them off on its top forever away from him.  Two of these he slipped hastily over Muriel's shoulders; the other he  put, as best he might, round his own waist; and then, for the first time,  still clinging close to his companion's arm, and buffeted about wildly by  that running sea, he was able to look about him in alarm for a moment,  and realize more or less what had actually happened.    
By this time the Australasian was a quarter of a mile away in front of  them, and her lights were beginning to become stationary as she slowly  slowed and reversed engines. Then, from the summit of a great wave, Felix  was dimly aware of a boat being lowered--for he saw a separate light  gleaming across the sea--a search was being made in the black night,  alas, how hopelessly! The light hovered about for many, many minutes,  revealed to him now here, now there, searching in vain to find him, as  wave after wave raised him time and again on its irresistible summit. The  men in the boat were doing their best, no doubt; but what chance of  finding any one on a dark night like that, in an angry sea, and with no  clue to guide them toward the two struggling castaways? Current and wind  had things all their own way. As a matter of fact, the light never came  near the castaways at all; and after half an hour's ineffectual search,  which seemed to Felix a whole long lifetime, it returned slowly toward  the steamer from which it came--and left those two alone on the dark  Pacific.    
"There wasn't a chance of picking 'em up," the captain said, with  philosophic calm, as the men clambered on board again, and the  Australasian got under way once more for the port of Honolulu. "I knew  there wasn't a chance; but in common humanity one was bound to make some  show of trying to save 'em. He was a brave fellow to go after her, though  it was no good of course. He couldn't even find her, at night, and with  such a sea as that running."    
And even as he spoke, Felix Thurstan, rising once more on the crest of a  much smaller billow--for somehow the waves were getting incredibly  smaller as he drifted on to leeward--felt his heart sink within him as he  observed to his dismay that the Australasian must be steaming ahead once  more, by the movement of her lights, and that they two were indeed  abandoned to their fate on the open surface of that vast and trackless  ocean.
