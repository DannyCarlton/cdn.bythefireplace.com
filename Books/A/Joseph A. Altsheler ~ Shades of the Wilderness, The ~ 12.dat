  Harry was sent a few days later with dispatches from the president  to General Lee, who was still in his camp beside the Opequan. Dalton  was held in the capital for further messages, but Harry was not sorry  to make the journey alone. The stay in Richmond had been very pleasant.  The spirits of youth, confined, had overflowed, but he was beginning to  feel a reaction. One must return soon to the battlefield. This was  merely a lull in the storm which would sweep with greater fury than  ever. The North, encouraged by Gettysburg and Vicksburg, was gathering  vast masses which would soon be hurled upon the South, and Harry knew  how thin the lines there were becoming.
  He thought, too, of Shepard, who was the latest to score in their  duel, and he believed that this man had already sent to the Northern  leaders information beyond value. Harry felt that he must strive in  some manner to make the score even.
  It was late in the summer when he rejoined the Army of Northern  Virginia and delivered the letters to the commander-in-chief, who sat  in the shade of a large tree. Harry observed him closely. He seemed a  little grayer than before the Battle of Gettysburg, but his manner was  as confident as ever. He filled to both eye and mind the measure of a  great general. After asking Harry many questions he dismissed him for a  while, to play, so he said.
  The young Kentuckian at once, and, as a matter of course, sought the  Invincibles. St. Clair and Langdon hailed him with shouts of joy, but  to his great surprise, Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel  Hector St. Hilaire were not playing chess.
  &#8220;We were getting on with the game last night, Harry,&#8221; explained  Colonel Talbot, &#8220;but we came to a point where we were about to develop  heat over a projected move. Then, in order to avoid such a lamentable  occurrence, we decided to postpone further play until to-night. But we  find you looking uncommonly well, Harry. The flesh pots of Egypt have  agreed with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I had a good time in Richmond, sir, a fine one,&#8221; replied Harry.  &#8220;The people there have certainly been kind to me, as they are to all  the officers of the Army of Northern Virginia.&#8221;
  &#8220;What have you done with the grave Dalton, who was your comrade on  your journey to the capital?&#8221;
  &#8220;They've kept him there for the present. They think he's stronger  proof against the luxuries and temptations of a city than I am.&#8221;
  &#8220;Youth is youth, and I'm glad that you've had this little fling,  Harry. Perhaps you'll have another, as I think you'll be sent back to  Richmond very soon.&#8221;
  &#8220;What has been going on here, Colonel?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very little. Nothing, in fact, of any importance. When we crossed  the swollen Potomac, although threatened by an enemy superior to us in  numbers, I felt that we would not be pushed. General Meade has been  deliberate, extremely deliberate in his offensive movements. Up North  they call Gettysburg a great victory, but we're resting here calmly and  peacefully. Hector and I and our young friends have found rural peace  and ease among these Virginia hills and valleys. You, of course, found  Richmond very gay and bright?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very gay and bright, Colonel, and full of handsome ladies.&#8221;
  Colonel Talbot sighed and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire  sighed also.
  &#8220;Hector and I should have been there,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot.  &#8220;Although we've never married, we have a tremendous admiration for the  ladies, and in our best uniforms we're not wholly unpopular among them,  eh, Hector?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not by any means, Leonidas. We're not as young as Harry here, but I  know that you're a fine figure of a man, and you know that I am.  Moreover, our experience of the dangerous sex is so much greater than  that of mere boys like Harry and Arthur and Tom here, that we know how  to make ourselves much more welcome. You talk to them about frivolous  things, mere chit chat, while we explain grave and important matters to  them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you sure, sir,&#8221; asked St. Clair, &#8220;that the ladies don't really  prefer chit chat?&#8221;
  &#8220;I was not speaking of little girls. I was alluding to those  ornaments of their sex who have arrived at years of discretion. Ah, if  Leonidas and I were only a while in Richmond! It would be the next best  thing to being in Charleston.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe the Invincibles will be sent there for a while.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps. I don't foresee any great activity here in the autumn. How  do they regard the Army of Northern Virginia in Richmond now, Harry?&#8221;
  &#8220;With supreme confidence.&#8221;
  The talk soon drifted to the people whom Harry had met at the  capital, and then he told of his adventure with Shepard, the spy.
  &#8220;He seems to be a most daring man,&#8221; said Talbot; &#8220;not a mere  ordinary spy, but a man of a higher type. I think he's likely to do us  great harm. But the woman, Miss Carden, was surely kind to you. If she  hadn't found you wandering around in the rain you'd have doubtless  dropped down and died. God bless the ladies.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so say we all of us,&#8221; said Harry.
  He returned to Richmond in a few days, bearing more dispatches, and  to his great delight all that was left of the Invincibles arrived a  week later to recuperate and see a little of the world. St. Clair and  Happy Tom plunged at once and with all the ardor of youth into the  gayeties of social life, and the two colonels followed them at a more  dignified but none the less earnest pace. All four appeared in fine new  uniforms, for which they had saved their money, and they were  conspicuous upon every occasion.
  Harry was again at the Curtis house, and although it was not a great  ball this time the assemblage was numerous, including all his friends.  The two colonels had become especial favorites everywhere, and they  were telling stories of the old South, which Harry had divined was  passing; passing whether the South won or not.
  Although there had been much light talk through the evening and an  abundance of real gayety, nearly every member of the company,  nevertheless, had serious moments. The news from Tennessee and Georgia  was heavy with import. It was vague in some particulars, but it was  definite enough in others to tell that the armies of Rosecrans and  Bragg were approaching each other. All eyes turned to the West. A great  battle could not be long delayed, and a powerful division of the Army  of Northern Virginia under Longstreet had been sent to help Bragg.
  Harry found himself late at night once more in that very room in  which the map had disappeared so mysteriously. The two colonels, St.  Clair and Langdon, and one or two others had drifted in, and the older  men were smoking. Inevitably they talked of the battle which they  foresaw with such certainty, and Harry's anxiety about it was  increased, because he knew his father would be there on one side, and  the cousin, for whom he cared so much, would be on the other.
  &#8220;If only General Lee were in command there,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot,  &#8220;we might reckon upon a great and decisive victory.&#8221;
  &#8220;But Bragg is a good general,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire.
  &#8220;It's not enough to be merely a good general. He must have the soul  of fire that Lee has, and that Jackson had. Bragg is the Southern  McClellan. He is brave enough personally, but he always overrates the  strength of the enemy, and, if he is victorious on the field, he does  not reap the fruits of victory.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where were the armies when we last heard from them?&#8221; asked a  captain.
  &#8220;Bragg was turning north to attack Rosecrans, who stood somewhere  between him and Chattanooga.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad that it's Rosecrans and not Grant who commands the  Northern army there,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Colonel Talbot.
  &#8220;I've studied the manner in which he took Vicksburg, and I've heard  about him from my father, and others. He won't be whipped. He isn't  like the other Northern generals. He hangs on, whatever happens. I  heard some one quoting him as saying that no matter how badly his army  was suffering in battle, the army of the other fellow might be  suffering worse. It seems to me that a general who is able to think  that way is very dangerous.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so he is, Harry,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot. &#8220;I, too, am glad that  it's Rosecrans and not Grant. If there's any news of a battle, we're  not in a bad place to hear it. It's said that Mr. Curtis always knows  as soon as our government what's happened.&#8221;
  The talk drifted on to another subject and then a hum came from the  larger room. A murmur only, but it struck such an intense and earnest  note that Harry was convinced.
  &#8220;It's news of battle! I know it!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  They sprang to their feet and hurried into the ballroom. William  Curtis, his habitual calm broken, was standing upon a chair and all the  people had gathered in front of him. A piece of paper, evidently a  telegram, was clutched in his hand.
  &#8220;Friends,&#8221; he said in a strained, but exultant voice, &#8220;a great  battle has been fought near Chattanooga on a little river called the  Chickamauga, and we have won a magnificent victory.&#8221;
  A mighty cheer came from the crowd.
  &#8220;The army of Rosecrans, attacked with sudden and invincible force by  Bragg, has been shattered and driven into Chattanooga.&#8221;
  Another cheer burst forth.
  &#8220;No part of the Union army was able to hold fast, save one wing  under Thomas.&#8221;
  A third mighty cheer arose, but this time Harry did not join in it.  He felt a sudden sinking of the heart at the words, &#8220;save one wing  under Thomas.&#8221; Then the victory was not complete. It could be complete  only when the whole Union army was driven from the field. As long as  Thomas stood, there was a flaw in the triumph. He had heard many times  of this man, Thomas. He had Grant's qualities. He was at his best in  apparent defeat.
  &#8220;Is there anything else, Mr. Curtis?&#8221; asked Colonel Talbot.
  &#8220;That is all my agent sends me concerning its results, but he says  that it lasted two days, and that it was fierce and bloody beyond all  comparison with anything that has happened in the West. He estimated  that the combined losses are between thirty and forty thousand men.&#8221;
  A heavy silence fell upon them all. The victory was great, but the  price for it was great, too. Yet exultation could not be subdued long.  They were soon smiling over it, and congratulating one another. But  Harry was still unable to share wholly in the joy of victory.
  &#8220;Why this gloom in your face, when all the rest of us are so happy?&#8221;  asked St. Clair.
  &#8220;My father was there. He may have fallen. How do I know?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's not it. He always comes through. What's the real cause? Out  with it!&#8221;
  &#8220;You know that part of the dispatch saying, 'No part of the Union  army was able to hold fast save one wing under Thomas.' How about that  wing! You heard, too, what the colonel said about General Bragg. He  always overestimates the strength of the enemy, and while he may win a  victory he will not reap the fruits of it. That wing under Thomas still  may be standing there, protecting all the rest of the Union army.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come now, old Sober Face! This isn't like you. We've won a grand  victory! We've more than paid them back for their Gettysburg.&#8221;
  Harry rejoiced then with the others, but at times the thought came  to him that Thomas with one wing might yet be standing between Bragg  and complete victory. When he and Dalton went back home&#8212;they were  again with the Lanhams&#8212;they found the whole population of Richmond  ablaze with triumph. The Yankee army in the West had been routed. Not  only was Chickamauga an offset for Gettysburg, but for Vicksburg as  well, and once more the fortunes of the South were rising toward the  zenith.
  Dalton had returned from the army a little later this time than  Harry, but he had joined him at the Lanhams', and he too showed gravity  amid the almost universal rejoicing.
  &#8220;I see that you're afraid the next news won't be so complete,  Harry,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;That's it, George. We don't really know much, except that Thomas  was holding his ground. Oh, if only Stonewall Jackson were there!  Remember how he came down on them at the Second Manassas and at  Chancellorsville! Thomas would be swept off his feet and as Rosecrans  retreated into Chattanooga our army would pour right on his heels!&#8221;
  They waited eagerly the next day and the next for news, and while  Richmond was still filled with rejoicings over Chickamauga, Harry saw  that his fears were justified. Thomas stood till the end. Bragg had not  followed Rosecrans into Chattanooga. The South had won a great battle,  but not a decisive victory. The commanding general had not reaped all  the rewards that were his for the taking. Bragg had justified in every  way Colonel Talbot's estimate of him.
  And yet Richmond, like the rest of the South, felt the great uplift  of Chickamauga, the most gigantic battle of the West. It told South as  well as North that the war was far from over. The South could no longer  invade the North, nor could the North invade the South at will. Even on  the northernmost border of the rebelling section the Army of Northern  Virginia under its matchless leader, rested in its camp, challenging  and defiant.
  Harry was glad to return with his friends to the army. His brief  period of festival was over, and his fears for his father had been  relieved by a letter, stating that he had received no serious harm in  the great and terrible battle of Chickamauga.
  After the failure of the armies of Lee and Meade to bring about a  decisive battle at Mine Run, the Army of Northern Virginia established  its autumn and winter headquarters on a jutting spur of the great range  called Clarke's Mountain, Orange Court House lying only a few miles to  the west. The huge camp was made in a wide-open space, surrounded by  dense masses of pines and cedars. Tents were pitched securely, and,  feeling that they were to stay here a long time many of the soldiers  built rude log cabins.
  General Lee himself continued to use his tent, which stood in the  center of the camp, the streets of tents and cabins radiating from it  like the spokes of a wheel. Close about Lee's own tent were others  occupied by Colonel Taylor, his adjutant general, Colonel Peyton,  Colonel Marshall, and other and younger officers, including Harry and  Dalton. A little distance down one of the main avenues, which they were  pleased to call Victory Street, the Invincibles were encamped, and  Harry saw them almost every day.
  The troops were well fed now, and the brooks provided an abundance  of clear water. The days were still warm, but the evenings were cold,  and, inhaling the healing odors of the pines and cedars, wounded  soldiers returned rapidly to health.
  It was a wonderful interval for Harry and his friends associated  with him so closely. Save for the presence of armies, it seemed at  times that there was no war. Deep peace prevailed along the Rapidan and  the slopes of the mountain. It was the longest period of rest that he  and his comrades were to know in the course of the mighty struggle. The  action of the war was now chiefly in the Southwest, where Grant, taking  the place of Rosecrans, was seeking to recover all that was lost at  Chickamauga.
  Harry had another letter from his father, telling him that his own  had been received, and giving personal details of the titanic struggle  on the Chickamauga. He did not speak out directly, but Harry saw in his  words the vain regret that the great opportunity won at Chickamauga at  such a terrible price had not been used. In his belief the whole  Federal army might have been destroyed, and the star of the South would  have risen again to the zenith.
  Here Harry sighed and remembered his own forebodings. Oh, if only a  Stonewall Jackson had been there! His mighty sweep would have driven  Thomas and the rest in a wild rout. A tear rose in his eye as he  remembered his lost hero. He sincerely believed then and always that  the Confederacy would have won had he not fallen on that fatal evening  at Chancellorsville. It was an emotion with him, a permanent emotion  with which logic could not interfere.
  Harry was conscious, too, that the long quiet on the Eastern front  was but a lull. There was nothing to signify peace in it. If the North  had ever felt despair about the war Gettysburg and Vicksburg had  removed every trace of it. He knew that beyond the blue ranges of  mountains, both to east and west, vast preparations were going forward.  The North, the region of great population, of illimitable resources, of  free access to the sea, and of mechanical genius that had counted for  so much in arming her soldiers, was gathering herself for a supreme  effort. The great defeats of the war's first period were to be ignored,  and her armies were to come again, more numerous, better equipped and  perhaps better commanded than ever.
  Nevertheless, his mind was still the mind of youth, and he could not  dwell continuously upon this prospect. The camp in the hills was  pleasant. The heats had passed, and autumn in the full richness of its  coloring had come. The forests blazed in all the brilliancy of red and  yellow and brown. The whole landscape had the color and intensity that  only a North American autumn can know, and the October air had the  freshness and vitality sufficient to make an old man young.
  The great army of youth&#8212;it was composed chiefly of boys, like the  one opposing it&#8212;enjoyed itself during these comparatively idle months.  The soldiers played rural games, marbles even, pitching the horseshoe,  wrestling, jumping and running. It was to Harry like Hannibal in winter  quarters at Capua, without the Capua. There was certainly no luxury  here. While food was more abundant than for a long time, it was of the  simplest. Instead of dissipation there was a great religious revival.  Ministers of different creeds, but united in a common object, appeared  in the camp, and preached with power and energy. The South was  emotional then and perhaps the war had made it more so. The ministers  secured thousands of converts. All day long the preaching and singing  could be heard through the groves of pine and cedar, and Harry knew  that when the time for battle came they would fight all the better  because of it. Yielding to the enemy was no part of the Christianity  that these ministers preached.
  Harry also saw the growth of the hero-worship accorded to his great  commander. He did not believe that any other general, except perhaps  Napoleon in his earlier career, had ever received such trust and  admiration. Many soldiers who had felt his guiding hand in battle now  saw him for the first time. He had an appearance and manner to inspire  respect, and, back of that, was something much greater, a firm  conviction in the minds of all that he had illimitable patience, a  willingness to accept responsibility, and a military genius that had  never been surpassed. Such was the attitude of the Southern people  toward their great leader then, and, to an even greater degree now,  when his figure, like that of Lincoln, instead of becoming smaller  grows larger as it recedes into the past.
  Harry often rode with him. He seemed to have an especial liking for  the very young members of his staff, or for old private soldiers,  bearded and gray like himself, whom he knew by name. Far in October he  rode down toward the Rapidan where Stuart was encamped, taking with him  only Harry and Dalton. He was mounted on his great white war horse,  Traveller, which the soldiers knew from afar. Cheering arose, but when  he raised his hand in a deprecating way the soldiers, obedient to his  wish, ceased, and they heard only the murmur of many voices, as they  went on. The general made the lads ride, one on his right and the other  on his left hand, and brilliant October coloring and crisp air seemed  to put him in a mood that was far from war.
  &#8220;I pine for Arlington,&#8221; he said at length to Harry, &#8220;that ancestral  home of mine that is held by the enemy. I should like to see the  ripening of the crops there. We Virginians of the old stock hold to the  land, and you Kentuckians, who are really of the same race, hold to it,  too.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is true, sir,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;My father loves the land. After his  retirement from the army, following the Mexican war, he worked harder  upon our place in Kentucky than any slave or hired man. He was going to  free his slaves, but I suppose, sir, that the war has made him feel  different about it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, we're often willing to do things by our own free will, but not  under compulsion. The great Washington himself wrote of the evils of  slave labor. The 'old fields' scattered all over Virginia show what it  has done for this noble commonwealth.&#8221;
  Harry remembered quite well similar &#8220;old fields&#8221; in Kentucky. Slaves  were far less numerous there than in Virginia, and he was old enough to  have observed that, in addition to the wrong of slavery, they were a  liability rather than an asset. But he too felt anew the instinctive  rebellion against being compelled to do what he would perhaps do  anyhow.
  General Lee talked more of the land and Harry and Dalton listened  respectfully. Harry saw that his commander's heart turned strongly  toward it. He knew that Jefferson had dreamed of the United States as  an agricultural community, having no part in the quarrels of other  nations, but he knew that it was only a dream. The South, the section  that had followed Jefferson's dream, was now at a great disadvantage.  It had no ships, and it did not have the mills to equip it for the  great war it was waging. He realized more keenly than ever the  one-sided nature of the South's development.
  The general turned his horse toward the banks of the Rapidan, and a  resplendent figure came forward to meet him. It was that incarnation of  youth and fantastic knighthood, Jeb Stuart, who had just returned from  a ride toward the north. He wore a new and brilliant uniform and the  usual broad yellow sash about his waist. His tunic was embroidered,  too, and his epaulets were heavy with gold. The thick gold braid about  his hat was tied in a gorgeous loop in front. His hands were encased in  long gloves of the finest buckskin, and he tapped the high yellow tops  of his riding boots with a little whip.
  Harry always felt that Stuart did not really belong to the present.  His place was with the medieval knights who loved gorgeous armor, who  fought by day for the love of it and who sat in the evening on the  castle steps with fair ladies for the love of it, and who in the dark  listened to the troubadours below, also for the love of it. A great  cavalry leader, he shone at his brightest in the chase, and, when there  was no fighting to be done, his were the spirits of a boy, and he was  as quick for a prank as any lad under his own command.
  But Stuart, although he had joked with Jackson, never took any  liberties with Lee. He instantly swept the ground with his plumed hat  and said in his most respectful manner:
  &#8220;General, will you honor us by dining with us? We've just returned  from a long ride northward and we've made some captures.&#8221;
  Lee caught a twinkle in his eye, and he smiled.
  &#8220;I see no prisoners, General Stuart,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and I take it  that your captures do not mean human beings.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir, there are other things just now more valuable to us than  prisoners. We raided a little Yankee outpost. Nobody was hurt, but,  sir, we've captured some provisions, the like of which the Army of  Northern Virginia has not tasted in a long time. Would you mind coming  with me and taking a look? And bring Kenton and Dalton with you, if you  don't mind, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;This indeed sounds tempting,&#8221; said the commander-in-chief of the  Army of Northern Virginia. &#8220;I accept your invitation, General Stuart,  in behalf of myself and my two young aides.&#8221;
  He dismounted, giving the reins of Traveller to an orderly, and  walked toward Stuart's tent, which was pitched near the river. The  &#8220;captures&#8221; were heaped in a grassy place.
  &#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; said General Stuart, &#8220;are twenty dozen boxes of the  finest French sardines. I haven't tasted sardines in a year and I love  them.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've always liked them,&#8221; said General Lee.
  &#8220;And here, sir, are several cases of Yorkshire ham, brought all the  way across the sea&#8212;and for us. It isn't as good as our Virginia ham,  which is growing scarce, but we'll like it. And cove oysters, cases and  cases of 'em. I like 'em almost as well as sardines.&#8221;
  &#8220;Most excellent.&#8221;
  &#8220;And real old New England pies, baked, I suppose, in Washington. We  can warm 'em over.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see that you have the fire ready.&#8221;
  &#8220;And jars of preserves, a half-dozen kinds at least, and all of 'em  look as if two likely youngsters like Kenton and Dalton would be  anxious to get at 'em.&#8221;
  &#8220;You judge us rightly, General,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;We'll show no mercy to  such prisoners as we have here.&#8221;
  &#8220;You wouldn't be boys and you wouldn't be human if you did,&#8221;  rejoined Stuart, &#8220;would they, General?&#8221;
  &#8220;They would not,&#8221; replied Lee. &#8220;One of the principal recollections  of my boyhood is that I was always hungry. Our regular three meals a  day were not enough for us, however much we ate at one time. Virginia,  like your own Kentucky, Harry, is full of forage, and we moved in  groups. Now, didn't you find a lot of food in the woods and fields?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, sir,&#8221; rejoined Harry with animation. &#8220;I was hungry all the  time, too. An hour after breakfast I was hungry again, and an hour  after dinner, which we had in the middle of the day, I was hungry once  more.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you knew where to go for supplies.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir; we had berries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries,  gooseberries, dewberries, cherries, all of them growing wild although  some of them started tame. And then we could forage for pears, peaches,  plums, damsons, all kinds of apples, paw paws, and then later for the  nuts, hickory nuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazel nuts, chinquapins, and a  lot more. We could have almost lived in the woods and fields from early  spring until late fall.&#8221;
  &#8220;We did the same in Virginia,&#8221; said the commander-in-chief. &#8220;I've  often thought that our forest Indians did not develop a higher  civilization, because it was so easy for them to live, save in the  depths of a hard winter. They had most of the berries and fruits and  nuts that we white boys had. The woods were full of game, and the lakes  and rivers full of fish. They were not driven by the hard necessity  that creates civilization.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dinner is ready, sir,&#8221; announced General Stuart, who had been  directing the orderlies. &#8220;I can offer you and the others nothing but  boxes and kegs to sit on, but I can assure you that this Northern food,  some of which comes in cans, is excellent.&#8221;
  The two lads and General Stuart fell to work with energy. General  Lee ate more sparingly. Stuart was a boy himself, talking much and  running over with fun.
  &#8220;Have you heard what happened to General Early, sir?&#8221; he asked the  commander-in-chief.
  &#8220;Not yet.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you will, sir, to-morrow. Early will be slow in sending you  that dispatch. He hasn't had time to write it yet. He's not through  swearing.&#8221;
  &#8220;General Early is a valiant and able man, but I disapprove of his  swearing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, sir, 'Old Jube' can't help it. It's a part of his breathing,  and man cannot live without breath. He sent one of his best aides with  a dispatch to General Hill, who is posted some distance away. Passing  through a thick cedar wood the aide was suddenly set upon by a genuine  stage villain, large, dark and powerful, who clubbed him over the head  with the butt of a pistol, and then departed with his dispatch.&#8221;
  &#8220;And what happened then?&#8221;
  &#8220;The aide returned to General Early with his story, but without his  dispatch. The general believed his account, of course, but he called  him names for allowing himself to be surprised and overcome by a single  Yankee. He cursed until the air for fifty yards about him smelled  strongly of sulphur and brimstone.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did he do anything more?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, General. He sent a duplicate of the dispatch by an aide whom  he said he could trust. In an hour the second man came back with the  same big lump on his head and with the same story. He had been ambushed  at the crossing of a ravine full of small cedars, and the highwayman  was undoubtedly the same, too, a big, powerful fellow, as bold as you  please.&#8221;
  Harry's pulse throbbed hard for a few moments, when he first heard  mention of the man. The description, not only physical, but of manner  and action as well, answered perfectly. He had not the slightest doubt  that it was Shepard.
  &#8220;A daring deed,&#8221; said General Lee. &#8220;We must see that it is not  repeated.&#8221;
  &#8220;But that wasn't all of the tale, sir. While the second man was  sitting on the bank, nursing his broken head, the Yankee Dick Turpin  read the dispatch and saw that it was a duplicate of the first. He  became red-hot with wrath, and talked furiously about the extra and  unnecessary work that General Early was forcing upon him. He ended by  cramming the dispatch into the man's hands, directing him to take it  back, and to tell General Early to stop his foolishness. The aide was a  bit dazed from the blow he received and he delivered that message word  for word. Why, sir, General Early exploded. People who have heard him  swear for years and who know what an artist he is in swearing, heard  him then utter swear words that they had never heard before, words  invented on the spur of the moment, and in the heat of passion, words  full of pith and meaning.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that was all, I suppose?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not by any means, sir. General Early picked two sharpshooters and  sent them with another copy of the dispatch. They passed the place of  the first hold-up, and next the ravine without seeing anybody. But as  they were riding some distance further on both of their horses were  killed by shots from a small clump of pines. Before they could regain  their feet Dick Turpin came out and covered them with his rifle&#8212;it  seems that he had one of those new repeating weapons.
  &#8220;The men saw that his eye was so keen and his hand so steady that  they did not dare to move a hand to a pistol. Then as he looked down  the sights of his rifle he lectured them. He told them they were  foolish to come that way, when the two who came before them had found  out that it was a closed road. He said that real soldiers learned by  experience, and would not try again to do what they had learned to be  impossible.
  &#8220;Then he said that after all they were not to blame, as they had  been sent by General Early, and he made one of them who had the stub of  a pencil write on the back of the dispatch these words: 'General Jubal  Early, C. S. A.: This has ceased to be a joke. After your first man was  stopped, it was not necessary to do anything more. I have the dispatch.  Why insist on sending duplicate after duplicate?' And the two had to  walk all the way back to General Early with that note, because they  didn't dare make away with the dispatch.
  &#8220;I have a certain respect for that man's skill and daring, but  General Early had a series of spells. He retired to his tent and if the  reports are not exaggerated, a continuous muttering like low thunder  came from the tent, and all the cloth of it turned blue from the  lightnings imprisoned inside.&#8221;
  General Lee himself smiled.
  &#8220;It was certainly annoying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope the dispatch was not  of importance.&#8221;
  &#8220;It contained nothing that will help the Yankees, but it shows that  the enemy has some spies&#8212;or at least one spy&#8212;who are Napoleons at  their trade.&#8221;
