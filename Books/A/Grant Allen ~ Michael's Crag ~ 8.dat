The night was long. The night was dark. Slowly the fog closed them in.  It grew rainier and more dismal. But on the summit of the crag Eustace  Le Neve stood aloft, and waved his arms, and shouted. He lit a match  and shaded it. The dull glare of it through the mist just faintly  reached the eyes of the anxious watchers on the beach below. From a  dozen lips there rose an answering shout. The pair on the crag half  heard its last echoes. Eustace put his hands to his mouth and cried  aloud once more, in stentorian tones, "All right. Cleer's here. We can  hold out till morning."    
Trevennack alone heard the words. But he repeated them so instantly  that his wife felt sure it was true hearing, not insane hallucination.  The sea was gaining on them now. It had risen almost up to the face of  the cliffs. Reluctantly they turned along the path by the gully, and  mounting the precipice waited and watched till morning on the tor that  overlooks Michael's Crag from the Penmorgan headland.    
Every now and again, through that livelong night, Trevennack whispered  in his wife's ear, "If only I chose to spread my wings, and launch  myself, I could fly across and carry her." And each time that brave  woman, holding his hand in her own and smoothing it gently, answered  in her soft voice, "But then the secret would be out, and Cleer's life  would be spoiled, and they'd call you a madman. Wait till morning,  dear Michael; do, do, wait till morning."    
And Trevennack, struggling hard with the mad impulse in his heart,  replied with all his soul, "I will; I will; for Cleer's sake and  yours, I'll try to keep it down. I'll not be mad. I'll be strong and  restrain it."    
For he knew he was insane, in his inmost soul, almost as well as he  knew his name was Michael the Archangel.    
On the island, meanwhile, Eustace Le Neve and Cleer Trevennack sat  watching out the weary night, and longing for the dawn to make the way  back possible. At least, Cleer did, for as to Eustace, in spite of  rain and fog and cold and darkness, he was by no means insensible to  the unwonted pleasure of so long a tete-a-tete, in such romantic  circumstances, with the beautiful Cornish girl. To be sure the waves  roared, and the drizzle dripped, and the seabirds flapped all round  them. But many waters will not quench love. Cleer was by his side,  holding his hand in hers in the dark for pure company's sake, because  she was so frightened; and as the night wore on they talked at last of  many things. They were prisoners there for five mortal hours or so,  alone, together; and they might as well make the best of it by being  sociable with one another.    
There could be no denying, however, that it was cold and damp and dark  and uncomfortable. The rain came beating down upon them, as they sat  there side by side on that exposed rock. The spray from the breakers  blew in with the night wind; the light breeze struck chill on their  wet clothes and faces. After awhile Eustace began a slow tour of  inspection over the crag, seeking some cave or rock shelter, some  projecting ledge of stone on the leeward side that might screen their  backs at least from the driving showers. Cleer couldn't be left alone;  she clung to his hand as he felt his way about the islet, with  uncertain steps, through the gloom and fog. Once he steadied himself  on a jutting piece of the rock as he supposed, when to his immense  surprise--wh'r'r'r--it rose from under his hand, with a shrill cry of  alarm, and fluttered wildly seaward. It was some sleeping gull, no  doubt, disturbed unexpectedly in its accustomed resting-place. Eustace  staggered and almost fell. Cleer supported him with her arm. He  accepted her aid gratefully. They stumbled on in the dark once more,  lighting now and again for a minute or two one of his six precious  matches--he had no more in his case--and exploring as well as they  might the whole broken surface of that fissured pinnacle. "I'm so glad  you smoke, Mr. Le Neve," Cleer said, simply, as he lit one. "For if  you didn't, you know, we'd have been left here all night in utter  darkness."    
At last, in a nook formed by the weathered joints, Eustace found a  rugged niche, somewhat dryer than the rest, and laid Cleer gently down  in it, on a natural spring seat of tufted rock-plants. Then he settled  down beside her, with what cheerfulness he could muster up, and taking  off his wet coat, spread it on top across the cleft, like a tent roof,  to shelter them. It was no time, indeed, to stand upon ceremony. Cleer  recognized as much, and nestled close to his side, like a sensible  girl as she was, so as to keep warm by mere company; while Eustace,  still holding her hand, just to assure her of his presence, placed  himself in such an attitude, leaning before her and above her, as to  protect her as far as possible from the drizzling rainfall through the  gap in front of them. There they sat till morning, talking gradually  of many things, and growing more and more confidential, in spite of  cold and wet, as they learnt more and more, with each passing hour, of  each other's standpoint. There are some situations where you get to  know people better in a few half-hours together than you could get to  know them in months upon months of mere drawing-room acquaintance. And  this was one of them. Before morning dawned, Eustace Le Neve and Cleer  Trevennack felt just as if they had known one another quite well for  years. They were old and trusted friends already. Old friends--and  even something more than that. Though no word of love was spoken  between them, each knew of what the other was thinking. Eustace felt  Cleer loved him; Cleer felt Eustace loved her. And in spite of rain  and cold and fog and darkness they were almost happy--before dawn came  to interrupt their strange tete-a-tete on the islet.    
As soon as day broke Eustace looked out from their eyrie on the  fissured peak, and down upon the troubled belt of water below. The sea  was now ebbing, and the passage between the rock and the mainland  though still full (for it was never dry even at spring-tide low water)  was fairly passable by this time over the natural bridge of stepping-  stones. He clambered down the side, giving his hand to Cleer from  ledge to ledge as he went. The fog had lifted a little, and on the  opposite headland they could just dimly descry the weary watchers  looking eagerly out for them. Eustace put his hands to his mouth, and  gave a loud halloo. The sound of the breakers was less deafening now;  his voice carried to the mainland. Trevennack, who had sat under a  tarpaulin through the livelong night, watching and waiting with  anxious heart for the morning, raised an answering shout, and waved  his hat in his hand frantically. St. Michael's Crag had not betrayed  its trust. That was the motto of the Trevennacks--"Stand fast, St.  Michael's!"--under the crest of the rocky islet, castled and mured,  flamboyant. Eustace reached the bottom of the rock, and, wading in the  water himself, or jumping into the deepest parts, helped Cleer across  the stepping-stones. Meanwhile, the party on the cliff had hurried  down by the gully path; and a minute later Cleer was in her mother's  arms, while Trevennack held her hand, inarticulate with joy, and bent  over her eagerly.    
"Oh, mother," Cleer cried, in her simple girlish naivete, "Mr. Le  Neve's been so kind to me! I don't know how I should ever have got  through the night without him. It was so good of him to come. He's  been <i>such</i> a help to me."    
The father and mother both looked into her eyes--a single searching  glance--and understood perfectly. They grasped Le Neve's hand. Tears  rolled down their cheeks. Not a word was spoken, but in a certain  silent way all four understood one another.    
"Where's Tyrrel?" Eustace asked.    
And Mrs. Trevennack answered, "Carried home, severely hurt. He was  bruised on the rocks. But we hope not dangerously. The doctor's been  to see him, we hear, and finds no bones broken. Still, he's terribly  battered about, in those fearful waves, and it must be weeks, they  tell us, before he can quite recover."    
But Cleer, as was natural, thought more of the man who had struggled  through and reached her than of the man who had failed in the attempt,  though he suffered all the more for it. This is a world of the  successful. In it, as in most other planets I have visited, people  make a deal more fuss over the smallest success than over the noblest  failure.    
It was no moment for delay. Eustace turned on his way at once, and ran  up to Penmorgan. And the Trevennacks returned, very wet and cold, in  the dim gray dawn to their rooms at Gunwalloe.    
As soon as they were alone--Cleer put safely to bed--Trevennack looked  at his wife. "Lucy," he said, slowly, in a disappointed tone, "after  this, of course, come what may, they must marry."    
"They must," his wife answered. "There's no other way left. And  fortunately, dear, I could see from the very first, Cleer likes him,  and he likes her."    
The father paused a moment. It wasn't quite the match he had hoped for  a Trevennack of Trevennack. Then he added, very fervently, "Thank God  it was <i>him</i>--not that other man, Tyrrel! Thank God, the first one fell  in the water and was hurt. What should we ever have done--oh, what  should we have done, Lucy, if she'd been cut off all night long on  that lonely crag face to face with the man who murdered our dear boy  Michael?"    
Mrs. Trevennack drew a long breath. Then she spoke earnestly once  more. "Dear heart," she said, looking deep into his clear brown eyes,  "now remember, more than ever, Cleer's future is at stake. For Cleer's  sake, more than ever, keep a guard on yourself, Michael; watch word  and deed, do nothing foolish."    
"You can trust me!" Trevennack answered, drawing himself up to his  full height, and looking proudly before him. "Cleer's future is at  stake. Cleer has a lover now. Till Cleer is married, I'll give you my  sacred promise no living soul shall ever know in any way she's an  archangel's daughter."
