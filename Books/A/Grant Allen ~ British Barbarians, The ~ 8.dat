As soon as he was gone, a sigh of relief ran half-unawares through  the little square party. They felt some unearthly presence had been  removed from their midst. General Claviger turned to Monteith.  "That's a curious sort of chap," he said slowly, in his military  way. "Who is he, and where does he come from?"    
"Ah, where does he come from?--that's just the question," Monteith  answered, lighting a cigar, and puffing away dubiously. "Nobody  knows. He's a mystery. He poses in the role. You'd better ask  Philip; it was he who brought him here."    
"I met him accidentally in the street," Philip answered, with an  apologetic shrug, by no means well pleased at being thus held  responsible for all the stranger's moral and social vagaries. "It's  the merest chance acquaintance. I know nothing of his antecedents.  I--er--I lent him a bag, and he's fastened himself upon me ever  since like a leech, and come constantly to my sister's. But I  haven't the remotest idea who he is or where he hails from. He  keeps his business wrapped up from all of us in the profoundest  mystery."    
"He's a gentleman, anyhow," the General put in with military  decisiveness. "How manly of him to acknowledge at once about the  cobbler being probably a near relation! Most men, you know,  Christy, would have tried to hide it; <i>he</i> didn't for a second. He  admitted his ancestors had all been cobblers till quite a recent  period."    
Philip was astonished at this verdict of the General's, for he  himself, on the contrary, had noted with silent scorn that very  remark as a piece of supreme and hopeless stupidity on Bertram's  part. No fellow can help having a cobbler for a grandfather, of  course: but he need not be such a fool as to volunteer any mention  of the fact spontaneously.    
"Yes, I thought it bold of him," Monteith answered, "almost bolder  than was necessary; for he didn't seem to think we should be at all  surprised at it."    
The General mused to himself. "He's a fine soldierly fellow," he  said, gazing after the tall retreating figure. "I should like to  make a dragoon of him. He's the very man for a saddle. He'd dash  across country in the face of heavy guns any day with the best of  them."    
"He rides well," Philip answered, "and has a wonderful seat. I saw  him on that bay mare of Wilder's in town the other afternoon, and I  must say he rode much more like a gentleman than a cobbler."    
"Oh, he's a gentleman," the General repeated, with unshaken  conviction: "a thoroughbred gentleman." And he scanned Philip up  and down with his keen grey eye as if internally reflecting that  Philip's own right to criticise and classify that particular  species of humanity was a trifle doubtful. "I should much like to  make a captain of hussars of him. He'd be splendid as a leader of  irregular horse; the very man for a scrimmage!" For the General's  one idea when he saw a fine specimen of our common race was the  Zulu's or the Red Indian's--what an admirable person he would be  to employ in killing and maiming his fellow-creatures!    
"He'd be better engaged so," the Dean murmured reflectively, "than  in diffusing these horrid revolutionary and atheistical doctrines."  For the Church was as usual in accord with the sword; theoretically  all peace, practically all bloodshed and rapine and aggression: and  anything that was not his own opinion envisaged itself always to  the Dean's crystallised mind as revolutionary and atheistic.    
"He's very like the duke, though," General Claviger went on, after  a moment's pause, during which everybody watched Bertram and Frida  disappearing down the walk round a clump of syringas. "Very like  the duke. And you saw he admitted some sort of relationship, though  he didn't like to dwell upon it. You may be sure he's a by-blow of  the family somehow. One of the Bertrams, perhaps the old duke who  was out in the Crimea, may have formed an attachment for one of  these Ingledew girls--the cobbler's sisters: I dare say they were  no better in their conduct than they ought to be--and this may be  the consequence."    
"I'm afraid the old duke was a man of loose life and doubtful  conversation," the Dean put in, with a tone of professional  disapprobation for the inevitable transgressions of the great and  the high-placed. "He didn't seem to set the example he ought to  have done to his poorer brethren."    
"Oh, he was a thorough old rip, the duke, if it comes to that,"  General Claviger responded, twirling his white moustache. "And so's  the present man--a rip of the first water. They're a regular bad  lot, the Bertrams, root and stock. They never set an example of  anything to anybody--bar horse-breeding,--as far as I'm aware; and  even at that their trainers have always fairly cheated 'em."    
"The present duke's a most exemplary churchman," the Dean  interposed, with Christian charity for a nobleman of position.  "He gave us a couple of thousand last year for the cathedral  restoration fund."    
"And that would account," Philip put in, returning abruptly to the  previous question, which had been exercising him meanwhile, "for  the peculiarly distinguished air of birth and breeding this man has  about him." For Philip respected a duke from the bottom of his  heart, and cherished the common Britannic delusion that a man who  has been elevated to that highest degree in our barbaric rank-  system must acquire at the same time a nobler type of physique and  countenance, exactly as a Jew changes his Semitic features for the  European shape on conversion and baptism.    
"Oh, dear, no," the General answered in his most decided voice.  "The Bertrams were never much to look at in any way: and as for the  old duke, he was as insignificant a little monster of red-haired  ugliness as ever you'd see in a day's march anywhere. If he hadn't  been a duke, with a rent-roll of forty odd thousand a year, he'd  never have got that beautiful Lady Camilla to consent to marry him.  But, bless you, women 'll do anything for the strawberry leaves. It  isn't from the Bertrams this man gets his good looks. It isn't from  the Bertrams. Old Ingledew's daughters are pretty enough girls. If  their aunts were like 'em, it's there your young friend got his air  of distinction."    
"We never know who's who nowadays," the Dean murmured softly. Being  himself the son of a small Scotch tradesman, brought up in the Free  Kirk, and elevated into his present exalted position by the early  intervention of a Balliol scholarship and a studentship of Christ  Church, he felt at liberty to moralise in such non-committing terms  on the gradual decay of aristocratic exclusiveness.    
"I don't see it much matters what a man's family was," the General  said stoutly, "so long as he's a fine, well-made, soldierly fellow,  like this Ingledew body, capable of fighting for his Queen and  country. He's an Australian, I suppose. What tall chaps they do  send home, to be sure! Those Australians are going to lick us all  round the field presently."    
"That's the curious part of it," Philip answered. "Nobody knows  what he is. He doesn't even seem to be a British subject. He calls  himself an Alien. And he speaks most disrespectfully at times--  well, not exactly perhaps of the Queen in person, but at any rate  of the monarchy."    
"Utterly destitute of any feeling of respect for any power of any  sort, human or divine," the Dean remarked, with clerical severity.    
"For my part," Monteith interposed, knocking his ash off savagely,  "I think the man's a swindler; and the more I see of him, the less  I like him. He's never explained to us how he came here at all, or  what the dickens he came for. He refuses to say where he lives or  what's his nationality. He poses as a sort of unexplained Caspar  Hauser. In my opinion, these mystery men are always impostors. He  had no letters of introduction to anybody at Brackenhurst; and he  thrust himself upon Philip in a most peculiar way; ever since which  he's insisted upon coming to my house almost daily. I don't like  him myself: it's Mrs. Monteith who insists upon having him here."    
"He fascinates me," the General said frankly. "I don't at all  wonder the women like him. As long as he was by, though I don't  agree with one word he says, I couldn't help looking at him and  listening to him intently."    
"So he does me," Philip answered, since the General gave him the  cue. "And I notice it's the same with people in the train. They  always listen to him, though sometimes he preaches the most  extravagant doctrines--oh, much worse than anything he's said here  this afternoon. He's really quite eccentric."    
"What sort of doctrines?" the Dean inquired, with languid zeal.  "Not, I hope, irreligious?"    
"Oh, dear, no," Philip answered; "not that so much. He troubles  himself very little, I think, about religion. Social doctrines,  don't you know; such very queer views--about women, and so forth."    
"Indeed?" the Dean said quickly, drawing himself up very stiff: for  you touch the ark of God for the modern cleric when you touch the  question of the relations of the sexes. "And what does he say?  It's highly undesirable men should go about the country inciting to  rebellion on such fundamental points of moral order in public  railway carriages." For it is a peculiarity of minds constituted  like the Dean's (say, ninety-nine per cent. of the population) to  hold that the more important a subject is to our general happiness,  the less ought we all to think about it and discuss it.    
"Why, he has very queer ideas," Philip went on, slightly hesitating;  for he shared the common vulgar inability to phrase exposition of a  certain class of subjects in any but the crudest and ugliest  phraseology. "He seems to think, don't you know, the recognised  forms of vice--well, what all young men do--you know what I  mean--Of course it's not right, but still they do them--" The  Dean nodded a cautious acquiescence. "He thinks they're horribly  wrong and distressing; but he makes nothing at all of the virtue of  decent girls and the peace of families."    
"If I found a man preaching that sort of doctrine to my wife or my  daughters," Monteith said savagely, "I know what <i>I</i>'d do--I'd put  a bullet through him."    
"And quite right, too," the General murmured approvingly.    
Professional considerations made the Dean refrain from endorsing  this open expression of murderous sentiment in its fullest form; a  clergyman ought always to keep up some decent semblance of respect  for the Gospel and the Ten Commandments--or, at least, the greater  part of them. So he placed the tips of his fingers and thumbs  together in the usual deliberative clerical way, gazed blankly  through the gap, and answered with mild and perfunctory  disapprobation: "A bullet would perhaps be an unnecessarily severe  form of punishment to mete out; but I confess I could excuse the  man who was so far carried away by his righteous indignation as to  duck the fellow in the nearest horse-pond."    
"Well, I don't know about that," Philip replied, with an outburst  of unwonted courage and originality; for he was beginning to like,  and he had always from the first respected, Bertram. "There's  something about the man that makes me feel--even when I differ from  him most--that he believes it all, and is thoroughly in earnest.  I dare say I'm wrong, but I always have a notion he's a better man  than me, in spite of all his nonsense,--higher and clearer and  differently constituted,--and that if only I could climb to just  where he has got, perhaps I should see things in the same light  that he does."    
It was a wonderful speech for Philip--a speech above himself; but,  all the same, by a fetch of inspiration he actually made it.  Intercourse with Bertram had profoundly impressed his feeble  nature. But the Dean shook his head.    
"A very undesirable young man for you to see too much of, I'm sure,  Mr. Christy," he said, with marked disapprobation. For, in the  Dean's opinion, it was a most dangerous thing for a man to think,  especially when he's young; thinking is, of course, so likely to  unsettle him!    
The General, on the other hand, nodded his stern grey head once or  twice reflectively.    
"He's a remarkable young fellow," he said, after a pause; "a most  remarkable young fellow. As I said before, he somehow fascinates  me. I'd immensely like to put that young fellow into a smart hussar  uniform, mount him on a good charger of the Punjaub breed, and send  him helter-skelter, pull-devil, pull-baker, among my old friends  the Duranis on the North-West frontier."
