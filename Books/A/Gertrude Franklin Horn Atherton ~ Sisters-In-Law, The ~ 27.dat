That winter and the following seasons for the next few years passed very  rapidly for Alexina. Besides her classes and the constant companionship of  her friends (to say nothing of the excitement of helping one or two of them  out of not infrequent scrapes), she had for a time the absorbing interest  of refurnishing the best part of her house.    
The square lower hall which had been scantily furnished with the  grandfather's clock, a hat-rack, and a settee, and whose walls were covered  with "marble paper," was painted, walls and wood, a deep ivory white, and  refurnished with light wicker furniture, palms, and growing plants. The  hat-rack was abolished, and the small library on the left of the entrance  turned into a men's dressing-room. The folding doors were removed from the  great double parlors, the "body brussels" replaced by hardwood floors, the  walls tinted a pale gray as a background for the really valuable pictures  (including the proud and gracious and beautiful Alexina Ballinger, dust  long since in Lone Mountain), and the splendid pieces of Italian furniture  which had always seemed to sulk and bulge against the dull brown walls.  The rep and walnut sets were sent to the auction room and replaced by  comfortable chairs and sofas whose colors varied, but harmonized not only  with one another but with the rugs that Alexina under Gora's direction had  bought at auction. In fact she bought many of her new pieces at auction and  with Aileen found it vastly exciting to pore over the advertisements and  then go down to the crowded rooms and bid.    
The billiard room behind the former library she left as it was. Her  mother's large bedroom upstairs she turned into a library with bookcases to  the ceiling on three sides, and one of the carved oaken tables against an  expanse of Pompeiian red relieved by one painting (a wedding gift from  Judge Lawton, who believed in patronizing local art) that had despoiled a  desert of its gorgeous yellow sunrise.    
The carpet and curtains were red without pattern. The coal grate had been  removed and a fireplace built for logs. It was to be her own den for long  rainy winter afternoons, or the cold and foggy days of summer when she  remained in the city.    
The dining-room was also given a hardwood floor and a Japanese red and gold  wall paper as a compliment to her martial ancestors; but as the sideboards  were built into the wails end could be replaced only at great cost;  they remained as a brooding reminder of the solid sixties, and no doubt  exchanged resentful reminiscences at night with the chairs which had been  merely recovered.    
As a matter of course modern bathtubs were installed and gas replaced by  electricity.    
All this made a "hole" in Alexina's bonds, the wedding-present of her  brothers, but Mortimer offered no objection, knowing as he did that to  achieve his ambition of being master of a house to which fashionable people  would come as a matter of course the outlay was imperative. Moreover,  entertaining at home would be far cheaper for him than at the restaurants.    
He was doing fairly well at this time, for he had learned what commodities  the retail men were likely to buy of a firm as small as his, and he had got  into touch with one or two foreign markets not monopolized by the older  houses. Moreover, he had been speculating a little in the new Nevada mines,  and successfully. He presented Alexina with a Victrola which included the  music for all the new dances, and a long coat of baby lamb lined with her  favorite periwinkle blue. To his sister he returned a thousand dollars of  her money.    
Alexina knew nothing of these speculations and felt that her original faith  in him was justified. He did not offer even yet to pay all the monthly  expenses of the house, explaining casually that the greater part of his  profits went back into the business; but he handed over his share promptly,  and such fleeting doubts and anxieties as may once have visited his still  inexperienced wife faded and finally disappeared.

They began to entertain a little during the second winter, Mrs. Groome  having been dead nearly two years. The new floor of the large drawing-room  had been laid for dancing, and their friends formed a habit, when there was  "nothing on" elsewhere, of telephoning and announcing they were coming up  to take a whirl. This led to more telephoning, and some twenty couples  would dance in the long-silent old house at least once and often three  times a week.    
The new order delighted James, who felt young again, and his hastily  improvised suppers were models of unpretentious succulence. There were  always sherry and whiskey in the handsome old decanters on the sideboards;  and, at the equally perfect little dinners, for a time, two bottles of  Alexander Groome's favorite brand of champagne (which he had remembered  with satisfaction on his deathbed that he had not outlived) were brought up  from the cellar by the beaming James.    
When, almost with tears, he informed his mistress' husband that the last  bottle had been served Mortimer could do no less than order up a case. He  had not the courage either to give his guests the excellent native claret  where they had formerly enjoyed imported champagne or to appear a "piker"  in the eyes of the far from democratic family butler.    
He consoled himself with the reflection that it was "good business." Nearly  all the young men, married or otherwise, that came to his house (Alexina  subtly encouraged him to call it his house) were of more or less importance  or standing in the world of business and finance (two were lawyers in their  first flight, Bascom Luning and Jimmie Thorne), and the more prosperous he  appeared to be (they knew to a dollar the extent of Alexina's income) the  more apt would business be to flow his way, the less likely they would be  to suspect him of playing the stock market. At all events it enhanced his  standing and gave him intense pleasure.    
Moreover, as time passed it became evident to his sensitive ego that he  was no longer looked upon as an outsider. He was accepted as a matter  of course. He was one of them. Neither men nor women (not even Aileen)  continued to ask themselves whether they liked him or not. He was there and  to stay and that was the end of it. They had always liked his manners; he  made a charming host, and, as ever, he danced like "a god with wings on his  heels."    
Quite naturally in due course some one offered to put him up at the most  exclusive and the most expensive club west of New York, a club to which  every Californian with any pretence to fashion or importance belonged as a  matter of course. Old men whose names had once been potent in the great  banks or firms of the valleys below, sat and gazed with sad and rheumy eyes  down upon the new city in which there was barely a familiar landmark to  remind them of their youth or the years of their power and their pride.  They sat there all day long, day after day; and tourists went away with the  impression that the imposing brown stone mansion on the sacred crest of Nob  Mill was a sumptuously endowed retreat for the incurably aged.    
But the majority of its members were very much alive and still well-padded;  and, far from being on a pale diet, were deeply appreciative of the famous  culinary resources of the chef, and showed it.    
When the offer was made to Mortimer he accepted with a bright: "Oh, thanks,  old chap. I'd like it immensely," But when, on the first day of his  membership, he stood in one of the front windows and gazed out at the ruins  opposite--the Pacific Union Club and the Fairmont Hotel were still two  oases in the rubbled waste of Nob Hill--he felt so exultant and so happy  that he dared not open his lips lest he betray himself. He could mount no  higher socially. All that he had to strive for now was his million--or  millions. When he had half a million he would build a house at Burlingame  that could be enlarged from time to time.    
Only with the "Rincona crowd" he had made no headway. Maria did not  hesitate to comment on the extravagance of doing the house over, the  membership at the club with all it entailed, Alexina's little electric  car, and above all the constant entertaining. A moderate amount was due  Alexina's position; but open house--nothing made money fly so quickly.  Prices were getting higher every day (there came a time, in the wake of the  great war, when she looked back with sad amazement at the morning of her  discontent) and rich people were getting richer while poor people like  themselves (she meant what Alexina still called the A. A.) were growing  poorer.    
Tom Abbott had not put Mortimer up at the club. He happened to know that  although his brother-in-law was doing fairly well he was not making a  fortune, and suspected that he dabbled in stocks. But he said nothing of  this to his wife, and as he knew that Alexina had long since revoked her  power of attorney (she had given him to understand that this was done at  Mortimer's suggestion) he believed that her money at least was safe.
