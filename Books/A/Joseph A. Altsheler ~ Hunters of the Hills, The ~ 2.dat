Willet hailed them joyfully when they returned.    
"I'll wager that only one arrow was shot," he said, smiling.    
"Just one," said Robert. "It struck the stag in the heart and he did not  move ten feet from where he stood."    
"And the Great Bear has the fire ready," said Tayoga. "I breathe the  smoke."    
"I knew you would notice it," said Willet, "although it's only a little  fire yet and I've built it in a hollow."    
Dry sticks were burning in a sunken place surrounded by great trees, and  they increased the fire, veiling the smoke as much as possible. Then  they broiled luscious steaks of the deer and ate abundantly, though  without the appearance of eagerness. Robert had been educated carefully  at Fort Orange, which men were now calling Albany, and Tayoga and the  hunter were equally fastidious.    
"The deer is the friend of both the red man and the white," said Willet,  appreciatively. "In the woods he feeds us and clothes us, and then his  horn tips the arrow with which you kill him, Tayoga."    
"It was so ordered by Manitou," said the young Onondaga, earnestly.  "The deer was given to us that we might live."    
"And that being the case," said Willet, "we'll cook all you and Robert  have brought and take it with us in the canoe. Since we keep on going  north the time will come when we won't have any chance for hunting."    
The fire had now formed a great bed of coals and the task was not hard.  It was all cooked by and by and they stowed it away wrapped in the two  pieces of skin. Then Willet and Tayoga decided to examine the country  together, leaving Robert on guard beside the canoe.    
Robert had no objection to remaining behind. Although circumstances had  made him a lad of action he was also contemplative by nature. Some  people think with effort, in others thoughts flow in a stream, and now  as he sat with his back to a tree, much that he had thought and heard  passed before him like a moving panorama and in this shifting belt of  color Indians, Frenchmen, Colonials and Englishmen appeared.    
He knew that he stood upon the edge of great events. Deeply sensitive to  impressions, he felt that a crisis in North America was at hand. England  and France were not yet at war, and so the British colonies and the  French colonies remained at peace too, but every breeze that blew from  one to the other was heavy with menace. The signs were unmistakable, but  one did not have to see. One breathed it in at every breath. He knew,  too, that intrigue was already going on all about him, and that the  Iroquois were the great pawn in the game. British and French were  already playing for the favor of the powerful Hodenosaunee, and Robert  understood even better than many of those in authority that as the  Hodenosaunee went so might go the war. It was certain that the Indians  of the St. Lawrence and the North would be with the French, but he was  confident that the Indians of the Long House would not swerve from their  ancient alliance with the British colonies.    
Two hours passed and Willet and Tayoga did not return, but he had not  expected them. He knew that when they decided to go on a scout they  would do the work thoroughly, and he waited with patience, sitting  beside the canoe, his rifle on his knees. Before him the creek flowed  with a pleasant, rippling noise and through the trees he caught a  glimpse of the lake, unruffled by any wind.    
The rest was so soothing, and his muscles and nerves relaxed so much  that he felt like closing his eyes and going to sleep, but he was roused  by the sound of a footstep. It was so distant that only an ear trained  to the forest would have heard it, but he knew that it was made by a  human being approaching, and that the man was neither Willet nor Tayoga.    
He put his ear to the earth and heard three men instead of one, and then  he rose, cocking his rifle. In the great wilderness in those surcharged  days a stranger was an enemy until he was proved to be otherwise, and  the lad was alert in every faculty. He saw them presently, three  figures walking in Indian file, and his heart leaped because the leader  was so obviously a Frenchman.    
His uniform was of the battalion Royal Roussillon, white faced with  blue, and his hat was black and three-cornered, but face and manner were  so unmistakably French that Robert did not think of his uniform, which  was neat and trim to a degree not to be expected in the forest. He bore  himself in the carelessly defiant manner peculiar to the French cadets  and younger sons of noble families in North America at the time, an  accentuation of the French at home, and to some extent a survival of the  spirit which Richelieu partially checked. Even in the forest he wore a  slender rapier at his belt, and his hand rested now upon its golden  hilt.    
He was about thirty years old, tall, slender, and with the light hair  and blue eyes seen so often in Northern France, telling, perhaps, of  Norman blood. His glance was apparently light, but Robert felt when it  rested upon him that it was sharp, penetrating and hard to endure.  Nevertheless he met it without lowering his own gaze. The man behind the  leader was swart, short, heavy and of middle years, a Canadian dressed  in deerskin and armed with rifle, hatchet and knife. The third man was  an Indian, one of the most extraordinary figures that Robert had ever  seen. He was of great stature and heavy build, his shoulders and chest  immense and covered with knotted muscles, disclosed to the eye, as he  was bare to the waist. All the upper part of his body was painted in  strange and hideous designs which Robert did not recognize, although he  knew the fashions of all the tribes in the New York and St. Lawrence  regions. His cheek bones were unusually high even for an Indian and his  gaze was heavy, keen and full of challenge. Robert judged that he  belonged to some western tribe, that he was a Pottawatomie, an Ojibway  or a Chippewa or that perhaps he came from the distant Sioux race.    
He was conscious that all three represented strength, each in a  different way, and he felt the gaze of three pairs of eyes resting upon  him in a manner that contained either secret or open hostility. But he  faced them boldly, a gallant and defiant young figure himself, instinct  with courage and an intellectual quality that is superior to courage  itself. The Frenchman who confronted him recognized at once the thinker.    
"I bid you good day," said Robert politely. "I did not expect to meet  travelers in these woods."    
The Frenchman smiled.    
"We are all travelers," he said, "but it is you who are our guest, since  these rivers and mountains and lakes and forests acknowledge the  suzerainty of my royal master, King Louis of France."    
His tone was light and bantering and Robert, seeing the advantage of it,  chose to speak in the same vein.    
"The wilderness itself is king," he said, "and it acknowledges no  master, save perhaps the Hodenosaunee. But I had thought that the law of  England ran here, at least where white men are concerned."    
He saw the eyes of the great savage flash when he mentioned the  Hodenosaunee, and he inferred at once that he was a bitter enemy of the  Iroquois. Some of the tribes had a hereditary hatred toward one another  more ferocious than that which they felt against the whites.    
The Frenchman smiled again, and swept his hand in a graceful curve  toward the green expanse.    
"It is true," he said, "that the forest is yet lord over these lands,  but in the future I think the lilies of France will wave here. You  perhaps have an equal faith that the shadow of the British flag will be  over the wilderness, but it would be most unfitting for you and me to  quarrel about it now. I infer from the canoe and the three paddles that  you did not come here alone."    
"Two friends are with me. They have gone into the forest on a brief  expedition. They should return soon. We have food in abundance, a deer  that we killed a few hours ago. Will you share it?"    
"Gladly. Courtesy, I see, is not lost in the woods. Permit me to  introduce ourselves. The chief is Tandakora of the Ojibways, from the  region about the great western lake that you call Superior. He is a  mighty warrior, and his fame is great, justly earned in many a battle.  My friend in deerskin is Armand Dubois, born a Canadian of good French  stock, and a most valiant and trustworthy man. As for me, I am Raymond  Louis de St. Luc, Chevalier of France and soldier of fortune in the New  World. And now you know the list of us. It's not so long as Homer's  catalogue of the ships, nor so interesting, but it's complete."    
His manner had remained light, almost jesting, and Robert judged that it  was habitual with him like a cloak in winter, and, like the cloak, it  would be laid away when it was not needed. The man's blue eyes, even  when he used the easy manner of the high-bred Frenchman, were questing  and resolute. But the youth still found it easier than he had thought to  meet him in like fashion. Now he replied to frankness with frankness.    
"Ours isn't and shouldn't be a hostile meeting in the forest, Chevalier  de St. Luc," he said. "To you and your good friends I offer my  greetings. As for myself, I am Robert Lennox, with two homes, one in  Albany, and the other in the wilderness, wherever I choose to make it."    
He paused a moment, because he felt the gaze of St. Luc upon him, very  intent and penetrating, but in an instant he resumed:    
"I came here with two friends whom you shall see if you stay with me  long enough. One is David Willet, a hunter and scout, well known from  the Hudson to the Great Lakes, a man to whom I owe much, one who has  stood to me almost in the place of a father. The other I can truly call  a brother. He is Tayoga, a young warrior of the clan of the Bear, of the  nation Onondaga, of the League of the Hodenosaunee. My catalogue, sir,  is just the same length as yours, and it also is complete."    
The Chevalier Raymond Louis de St. Luc laughed, and the laugh was  genuine.    
"A youth of spirit, I see," he said. "Well, I am glad. It's a pleasure  to meet with wit and perception in the wilderness. One prefers to talk  with gentlemen. 'Tis said that the English are heavy, but I do not  always find them so. Perhaps it's merely a slur that one nation wishes  to cast upon another."    
"It's scarcely correct to call me English," said Robert, "since I am a  native of this country, and the term American applies more properly."    
The eyes of St. Luc glistened.    
"I note the spirit," he said. "The British colonies left to themselves  grow strong and proud, while ours, drawing their strength from the King  and the government, would resent being called anything but Frenchmen.  Now, I'll wager you a louis against any odds that you'll claim the  American to be as good as the Englishman anywhere and at any time."    
"Certainly!" said Robert, with emphasis.    
St. Luc laughed again and with real pleasure, his blue eyes dancing and  his white teeth flashing.    
"And some day that independence will cause trouble for the good British  mother," he said, "but we'll pass from the future to the present. Sit  down, Tandakora, and you too, Dubois. Monsieur Lennox is, for the  present, our host, and that too in the woods we claim to be our own. But  we are none the less grateful for his hospitality."    
Robert unwrapped the venison and cut off large slices as he surmised  that all three were hungry. St. Luc ate delicately but the other two did  not conceal their pleasure in food. Robert now and then glanced a little  anxiously at the woods, hoping his comrades would return. He did not  know exactly how to deal with the strangers and he would find comfort in  numbers. He was conscious, too, that St. Luc was watching him all the  time intently, reading his expression and looking into his thoughts.    
"How are the good Dutch burghers at Albany?" asked the chevalier. "I  don't seek to penetrate any of your secrets. I merely make  conversation."    
"I reveal nothing," replied Robert, "when I say they still barter with  success and enjoy the pleasant ways of commerce. I am not one to  underrate the merchant. More than the soldier they build up a nation."    
"It's a large spirit that can put the trade of another before one's own,  because I am a soldier, and you, I judge, will become one if you are not  such now. Peace, Tandakora, it is doubtless the friends of Monsieur  Lennox who come!"    
The gigantic Indian had risen suddenly and had thrust forward the good  French musket that he carried. Robert had never beheld a more sinister  figure. The lips were drawn back a little from his long white teeth and  his eyes were those of a hunter who sought to kill for the sake of  killing. But at the chiding words of St. Luc the tense muscles relaxed  and he lowered the weapon. Robert was compelled to notice anew the great  influence the French had acquired over the Indians, and he recognized it  with dread, knowing what it might portend.    
The footsteps which the savage had heard first were now audible to him,  and he stood up, knowing that Tayoga and Willet were returning, and he  was glad of it.    
"My friends are here," he said.    
The Chevalier de St. Luc, with his customary politeness, rose to his  feet and Dubois rose with him. The Ojibway remained sitting, a huge  piece of deer meat in his hand. Tayoga and Willet appeared through the  bushes, and whatever surprise they may have felt they concealed it well.  The faces of both were a blank.    
"Guests have come since your departure," said Robert, with the formal  politeness of the time. "These gentlemen are the Chevalier Raymond Louis  de St. Luc, from Quebec, Monsieur Armand Dubois, from the same place, I  presume, and Tandakora, a mighty Ojibway chief, who, it seems, has  wandered far from his own country, on what errand I know not. Chevalier  my friends of whom I spoke, Mr. David Willet, the great hunter, and  Tayoga of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the League of  the Hodenosaunee, my brother of the forest and a great chief."    
He spoke purposely with sonority, and also with a tinge of satire,  particularly when he alluded to the presence of Tandakora at such a  great distance from his tribe. But St. Luc, of course, though noticing  it, ignored it in manner. He extended his hand promptly to the great  hunter who grasped it in his mighty palm and shook it.    
"I have heard of you, Mr. Willet," he said. "Our brave Canadians are  expert in the forest and the chase, and the good Dubois here is one of  the best, but I know that none of them can excel you."    
Robert, watching him, could not say that he spoke without sincerity,  and Willet took the words as they were uttered.    
"I've had a long time for learning," he said modestly, "and I suppose  experience teaches the dullest of us."    
Robert saw that the Ojibway had now risen and that he and the Onondaga  were regarding each other with a gaze so intent and fierce, so compact  of hatred that he was startled and his great pulses began to beat hard.  But it was only for an instant or two that the two warriors looked thus  into hostile eyes. Then both sat down and their faces became blank and  expressionless.    
The gaze of St. Luc roved to the Onondaga and rested longest upon him.  Robert saw the blue eyes sparkle, and he knew that the mind of the  chevalier was arrested by some important thought. He could almost  surmise what it was, but for the present he preferred to keep silent and  watch, because his curiosity was great and natural, and he wondered what  St. Luc would say next.    
The Onondaga and the hunter sat down on a fallen tree trunk and  inspected the others with a quiet but observant gaze. Each in his own  way had the best of manners. Tayoga, as became a forest chief, was  dignified, saying little, while Willet cut more slices from the deer  meat and offered them to the guests. But it was the Onondaga and not St.  Luc who now spoke first.    
"The son of Onontio wanders far," he said. "It is a march of many days  from here to Quebec."    
"It is, Tayoga," replied St. Luc gravely, "but the dominions of the  King of France, whom Onontio serves, also extend far."    
It was a significant speech, and Robert glanced at Tayoga, but the eyes  of the young chief were veiled. If he resented the French claim to the  lands over which the Hodenosaunee hunted it was in silence. St. Luc  paused, as if for an answer, but none coming he continued:    
"Shadows gather over the great nations beyond the seas. The French king  and the English king begin to look upon each other with hostile eyes."    
Tayoga was silent.    
"But Onontio, who stands in the French king's place at Quebec, is the  friend of the Hodenosaunee. The French and the great Six Nations are  friends."    
"There was Frontenac," said Tayoga quietly.    
"It was long ago."    
"He came among us when the Six Nations were the Five, burned our houses  and slew our warriors! Our old men have told how they heard it from  their fathers. We did not have guns then, and our bows and arrows were  not a match for the muskets of the French. But we have muskets and  rifles now, plenty of them, the best that are made."    
Tayoga's eyes were still veiled, and his face was without expression,  but his words were full of meaning. Robert glanced at St. Luc, who could  not fail to understand. The chevalier was still smooth and smiling.    
"Frontenac was a great man," he said, "but he has been gathered long  since to his fathers. Great men themselves make mistakes. There was bad  blood between Onontio and the Hodenosaunee, but if the blood is bad must  it remain bad forever? The evil was gone before you and I were born,  Tayoga, and now the blood flows pure and clean in the veins of both the  French and the Hodenosaunee."    
"The Hodenosaunee and Corlear have no quarrel."    
"Nor have the Hodenosaunee and Onontio. Behold how the English spread  over the land, cut down the forests and drive away all the game! But the  children of Onontio hunt with the Indians, marry with their women, leave  the forests untouched, and the great hunting grounds swarm with game as  before. While Onontio abides at Quebec the lands of the Hodenosaunee are  safe."    
"There was Frontenac," repeated Tayoga.    
St. Luc frowned at the insistence of the Onondaga upon an old wound, but  the cloud passed swiftly. In an instant the blue eyes were smiling once  more.    
"The memory of Frontenac shall not come between us," he said. "The heart  of Onontio beats for the Hodenosaunee, and he has sent me to say so to  the valiant League. I bring you a belt, a great belt of peace."    
Dubois handed him a large knapsack and he took from it a beautiful belt  of pure white wampum, uncommon in size, a full five feet in length, five  inches wide, and covered with many thousands of beads, woven in symbolic  figures. He held it up and the eyes of the Onondaga glistened.    
"It is a great belt, a belt of peace," continued St. Luc. "There is  none nobler, and Onontio would send no other kind. I give it to you,  Tayoga."    
The young warrior drew back and his hands remained at his sides.    
"I am Tayoga, of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the  great League of the Hodenosaunee," he said, "but I am not yet a chief.  My years are too few. It is a great matter of which you speak, St. Luc,  and it must be laid before the fifty sachems of the allied tribes in the  Long House. The belt may be offered to them. I cannot take it."    
The flitting cloud passed again over the face of St. Luc, but he did not  allow any change to show in his manner. He returned the splendid belt to  Dubois, who folded it carefully and put it back in the great knapsack.    
"Doubtless you are right, Tayoga," he said. "I shall go to the Long  House with the belt, but meantime we thank you for the courtesy of  yourself and your friends. You have given us food when we were hungry,  and a Frenchman does not forget."    
"The Onondagas keep the council fire in their valley, and the sachems  will gather there," said Tayoga.    
"Where they will receive the belt of peace that I shall offer them,"  said St. Luc.    
The Onondaga was silent. St. Luc, who had centered his attention upon  Tayoga, now turned it to Robert.    
"Mr. Lennox," he said, "we dwell in a world of alarms, and I am French  and you are English, or rather American, but I wish that you and I could  remain friends."    
The frankness and obvious sincerity of his tone surprised Robert. He  knew now that he liked the man. He felt that there was steel in his  composition, and that upon occasion, and in the service to which he  belonged, he could be hard and merciless, but the spirit seemed bright  and gallant.    
"I know nothing that will keep us from being friends," replied the lad,  although he knew well what the Frenchman meant.    
"Nor do I," said St. Luc. "It was merely a casual reference to the  changes that affect us all. I shall come to Albany some day, Mr. Lennox.  It is an interesting town, though perhaps somewhat staid and sober."    
"If you come," said Robert sincerely, "I hope I shall be there, and it  would please me to have you as a guest."    
St. Luc gave him a sharp, examining look.    
"I believe you mean it," he said. "It's possible that you and I are  going to see much of each other. One can never tell what meetings time  will bring about. And now having accepted your hospitality and thanking  you for it, we must go."    
He rose. Dubois, who had not spoken at all, threw over his shoulder the  heavy knapsack, and the Ojibway also stood up, gigantic and sinister.    
"We go to the Vale of Onondaga," said St. Luc, turning his attention  back to Tayoga, "and as you advised I shall lay the peace belt before  the fifty sachems of the Hodenosaunee, assembled in council in the Long  House."    
"Go to the southwest," said Tayoga, "and you will find the great trail  that leads from the Hudson to the mighty lakes of the west. The warriors  of the Hodenosaunee have trod it for generations, and it is open to the  son of Onontio."    
The young Indian's face was a mask, but his words and their tone alike  were polite and dignified. St. Luc bowed, and then bowed to the others  in turn.    
"At Albany some day," he said to young Lennox, and his smile was very  winning.    
"At Albany some day," repeated Robert, and he hoped the prophecy would  come true.    
Then St. Luc turned away, followed by the Canadian, with the Indian in  the rear. None of the three looked back and the last Robert saw of them  was a fugitive gleam of the chevalier's white uniform through the green  leaves of the forest. Then the mighty wilderness swallowed them up, as a  pebble is lost in a lake. Robert looked awhile in the direction in which  they had gone, still seeing them in fancy.    
"How much does their presence here signify?" he asked thoughtfully.    
"They would have the Hodenosaunee to forget Frontenac," replied Tayoga.    
"And will the Six Nations forget him?"    
"The fifty sachems in council alone can tell."    
Robert saw that the young Onondaga would not commit himself, even to  him, and he did not ask anything more, but the hunter spoke plainly.    
"We must wake up those fat Indian commissioners at Albany," he said.  "Those Dutchmen think more of cheating the tribes than they do of the  good of either white man or red man, but I can tell you, Robert, and you  too, Tayoga, that I'm worried about that Frenchman coming down here  among the Six Nations. He's as sharp as a razor, and as quick as  lightning. I could see that, and there's mischief brewing. He's not  going to the Onondaga Valley for nothing."    
"Tandakora, the Ojibway, goes with a heavy foot," said the Onondaga.    
"What do you mean, Tayoga?" asked Willet.    
"He comes of a savage tribe, which is hostile to the Hodenosaunee and  all white men. He has seen three scalps which still grow on the heads of  their owners."    
"Which means that he might not keep on following St. Luc. Well, we'll be  on our guard and now I don't see any reason why we should stay here  longer."    
"Nor I," said Robert, and, Tayoga agreeing with them, they returned the  canoe to the stream, paddling back into the lake, and continuing their  course until they came to its end. There they carried the canoe across a  portage and launched it on a second lake as beautiful as the first. None  of the three spoke much now, their minds being filled with thoughts of  St. Luc and his companions.    
They were yet on the water when the day began to wane. The green forest  on the high western shore was touched with flame from the setting sun.  Then the surface of the lake blazed with red light, and in the east the  gray of twilight came.    
"It will be night in half an hour," said Robert, "and I think we'd  better make a landing, and camp."    
"Here's a cove on the right," said Willet. "We'll take the canoe up  among the trees, and wrap ourselves in our blankets. It's a good thing  we have them, as the darkness is going to bring a chill with it."    
They found good shelter among the trees and bushes, a small hollow  protected by great trees and undergrowth, into which they carried the  canoe.    
"Since it's not raining this is as good as a house for us," said Willet.    
"I think it's better," said Robert. "The odor of spruce and hemlock is  so wonderful I wouldn't like to have it shut away from me by walls."    
The Onondaga drew in deep inhalations of the pure, healing air, and as  his black eyes gleamed he walked to the edge of the little hollow and  looked out in the dusk over the vast tangled wilderness of mountain and  lake, forest and river. The twilight was still infused with the red from  the setting sun, and in the glow the whole world was luminous and  glorified. Now the eyes of Tayoga, which had flashed but lately, gave  back the glow in a steady flame.    
"Hawenneyu, the Divine Being whom all the red people worship, made many  great lands," he said, "but he spent his work and love upon that which  lies between the Hudson and the vast lakes of the west. Then he rested  and looking upon what he had done he was satisfied because he knew it to  be the best in all the world, created by him."    
"How do you know it to be the best, Tayoga?" asked Willet. "You haven't  seen all the countries. You haven't been across the sea."    
"Because none other can be so good," replied the Iroquois with simple  faith. "When Hawenneyu, in your language the Great Spirit, found the  land that he had made so good he did not know then to whom to give it,  but in the greatness of his wisdom he left it to those who were most  fitted to come and take it. And in time came the tribes which Tododaho,  helped by Hayowentha, often called by the English Hiawatha, formed into  the great League of the Hodenosaunee, and because they were brave and  far-seeing and abided by the laws of Tododaho and Hayowentha, they took  the land which they have kept ever since, and which they will keep  forever."    
"I like your good, strong beliefs, Tayoga," said the hunter heartily.  "The country does belong to the Iroquois, and if it was left to me to  decide about it they'd keep it till the crack of doom. Now you boys roll  in your blankets. I'll take the first watch, and when it's over I'll  call one of you."    
But Tayoga waited a little until the last glow of the sun died in the  west, looking intently where the great orb had shone. Into his religion  a reverence for the sun, Giver of Light and Warmth, entered, and not  until the last faint radiance from it was gone did he turn away.    
Then he took from the canoe and unfolded <i>eyose</i>, his blanket, which was  made of fine blue broadcloth, thick and warm but light, six feet long  and four feet wide. It was embroidered around the edges with another  cloth in darker blue, and the body of it bore many warlike or hunting  designs worked skillfully in thread. If the weather were cold Tayoga  would drape the blanket about his body much like a Roman toga, and if he  lay in the forest at night he would sleep in it. Now he raked dead  leaves together, spread the blanket on them, lay on one half of it and  used the other half as a cover.    
Robert imitated him, but his blanket was not so fine as Tayoga's,  although he found it soft and warm enough. Willet sat on a log higher  up, his rifle across his knees and gazed humorously at them.    
"You two lads look pretty snug down there," he said, "and after all  you're only lads. Tayoga may have a head plumb full of the wisdom of the  wilderness, and Robert may have a head stuffed with different kinds of  knowledge, but you're young, mighty young, anyhow. An' now, as I'm  watching over you, I'll give a prize to the one that goes to sleep  first."    
In three minutes deep regular breathing showed that both had gone to the  land of slumber, and Willet could not decide which had led the way. The  darkness increased so much that their figures looked dim in the hollow,  but he glanced at them occasionally. The big man had many friends, but  young Lennox and Tayoga were almost like sons to him, and he was glad to  be with them now. He felt that danger lurked in the northern wilderness,  and three were better than two.
