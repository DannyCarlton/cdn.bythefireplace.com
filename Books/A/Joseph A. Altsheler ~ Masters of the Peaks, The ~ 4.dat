  De Galissonniere gazed at the three faces, peering at him over the  brink, and then drew himself together jauntily. His position, perched  on the face of the cliff, was picturesque, and he made the most of it.
  &#8220;I am glad to see you again Mr. Willet, Mr. Lennox and Tayoga, the  brave Onondaga,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's been a long time since we met in Quebec  and much water has flowed under that bridge of Avignon, of which we  French sing, but I can't see that any one of you has changed much.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor you,&#8221; said Robert, catching his tone and acting as spokesman  for the three. &#8220;The circumstances are unusual, Captain Louis de  Galissonniere, and I'm sorry I can't invite you to come up on our  crest, but it wouldn't be military to let you have a look at our  fortifications.&#8221;
  &#8220;I understand, and I do very well where I am. I wish to say first  that I am sorry to see you in such a plight.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we, Captain, regret to find you allied with such a savage as  Tandakora.&#8221;
  A quick flush passed over the young Frenchman's face, but he made no  other sign.
  &#8220;In war one cannot always choose,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I have come to  receive your surrender, and I warn you very earnestly that it will be  wise for you to tender it. The Indians have lost one man already and  they are inflamed. If they lose more I might not be able to control  them.&#8221;
  &#8220;And if we yield ourselves you pledge us our lives, a transfer in  safety to Canada where we are to remain as prisoners of war, until such  time as we may be exchanged?&#8221;
  &#8220;All that I promise, and gladly.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're sure, Captain de Galissonniere, that you can carry out the  conditions?&#8221;
  &#8220;Absolutely sure. You are surrounded here on the peak, and you  cannot get away. All we have to do is to keep the siege.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is true, but while you can wait so can we.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we have plenty of water, and you have none.&#8221;
  &#8220;You would urge us again to surrender on the ground that it would be  the utmost wisdom for us to do so?&#8221;
  &#8220;It goes without saying, Mr. Lennox.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, that being the case, we decline.&#8221;
  De Galissonniere looked up in astonishment at the young face that  gazed down at him. The answer he had expected was quite the reverse.
  &#8220;You mean that you refuse?&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;It is just what I meant.&#8221;
  &#8220;May I ask why, when you are in such a hopeless position?&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, Mr. Willet and I wish to see how long we can endure the  pangs of thirst without total collapse. We've had quite a difference on  the subject. Tayoga says ten days, Mr. Willet twelve days, but I think  we can stand it a full two weeks.&#8221;
  De Galissonniere frowned.
  &#8220;You are frivolous, Mr. Lennox,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this is not a time  for light talk. I don't know what you mean, but it seems to me you  don't appreciate the dire nature of your peril. I liked you and your  comrades when I met you in Quebec and I do not wish to see you perish  at the hands of the savages. That is why I have climbed up here to make  you this offer, which I have wrung from the reluctant Tandakora. It was  he who assured me that the besieged were you. It pains me that you see  fit to reject it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know it was made out of a good heart,&#8221; said Robert, seriously,  &#8220;and we thank you for the impulse that brought you here. Some day we  may be able to repay it, but we decline because there are always  chances. You know, Captain, that while we have life we always have  hope. We may yet escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do not see wherein it is possible,&#8221; said the young Frenchman,  with actual reluctance in his tone. &#8220;But it is for you to decide what  you wish to do. Farewell.&#8221;
  &#8220;Farewell, Captain de Galissonniere,&#8221; said Robert, with the utmost  sincerity. &#8220;I hope no bullet of ours will touch you.&#8221;
  The captain made a courteous gesture of good-by and slowly descended  the slope, disappearing among the bushes in the gorge, whence came a  fierce and joyous shout.
  &#8220;That was the cry of the savages when he told them our answer,&#8221; said  Willet. &#8220;They don't want us to surrender. They think that by-and-by  we'll fall into their hands through exhaustion, and then they can work  their will upon us.&#8221;
  &#8220;They don't know about that fountain, that pure, blessed fountain,&#8221;  said Robert, &#8220;the finest fountain that gushes out anywhere in this  northern wilderness, the fountain that Tayoga's Areskoui has put here  for our especial benefit.&#8221;
  His heart had become very light and, as usual when his optimism was  at its height, words gushed forth. Water, and their ability to get it  whenever they wanted it, was the key to everything, and he painted  their situation in such bright colors that his two comrades could not  keep from sharing his enthusiasm.
  &#8220;Truly, Dagaeoga did not receive the gift of words in vain,&#8221; said  Tayoga. &#8220;Golden speech flows from him, and it lifts up the minds of  those who hear. Manitou finds a use for everybody, even for the  orator.&#8221;
  &#8220;Though it was a hard task, even for Manitou,&#8221; laughed Robert.
  They watched the whole afternoon without any demonstration from the  enemy&#8212;they expected none&#8212;and toward evening the Onondaga, who was  gazing into the north, announced a dark shadow on the horizon.
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Robert. &#8220;A cloud? I hope we won't have another  storm.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is no cloud,&#8221; replied Tayoga. &#8220;It is something else that moves  very fast, and it comes in our direction. A little longer and I can  tell what it is. Now I see; it is a flight of wild pigeons, a great  flock, hundreds of thousands, and millions, going south to escape the  winter.&#8221;
  &#8220;We've seen such flights often.&#8221;
  &#8220;So we have, but this is coming straight toward us, and I have a  great thought, Dagaeoga. Areskoui has not only forgiven us for our  unknown sin&#8212;perhaps of omission&#8212;but he has also decided to put help  in our way, if we will use it. You see many dwarf trees at the southern  edge of the crest, and I believe that by dark they will be covered with  pigeons, stopping for the night.&#8221;
  &#8220;And some of them will stop for our benefit, though we have bear  meat too! I see, Tayoga.&#8221;
  Robert watched the flying cloud, which had grown larger and blacker,  and then he saw that Tayoga was right. It was an immense flock of wild  pigeons, and, as the twilight fell, they covered the trees upon their  crest so thickly that the boughs bent beneath them. Young Lennox and  the Onondaga killed as many as they wished with sticks, and soon, fat  and juicy, they were broiling over the coals.
  &#8220;Tandakora will guess that the pigeons have fed us,&#8221; said Robert,  &#8220;and he will not like it, but he will yet know nothing about the  water.&#8221;
  They climbed down in turn in the darkness and took a drink, and  Robert, who explored a little, found many vines loaded with wild  grapes, ripe and rich, which made a splendid dessert. Then he took a  number of the smaller but very tough stems, and knotting them together,  with the assistance of Tayoga ran a strong rope from the crest down to  the fountain, thus greatly easing the descent for water and the return.
  &#8220;Now we can take two drinks where we took one before,&#8221; he said  triumphantly when the task was finished. &#8220;If you have your water there  is nothing like making it easy to be reached. Moreover, while it was  safe for an agile fellow like me, you and Dave, Tayoga, being stiff and  clumsy, might have tumbled down the mountain and then I should have  been lonesome.&#8221;
  Willet, who had been keeping the watch alone, was inclined to the  belief that they might expect an attack in the night, if it should  prove to be very dark. He felt able, however, should such an attempt  come, to detect the advance of the savages, either by sight or hearing,  especially the latter, ear in such cases generally informing him  earlier than eye. But as neither Robert nor Tayoga was busy they joined  him, and all three sat near the brink with their rifles across their  knees, and their pistols loosened in their belts, ready for their foes  should they come in numbers.
  They talked a while in low tones, and then fell silent. The night  had come, starless and moonless, favorable to the designs of Tandakora,  but they felt intense satisfaction, nevertheless. It was partly  physical. Robert's making of an easy road to the water, the coming of  the pigeons, to be eaten, apparently sent by Areskoui, and the ease  with which they believed they could hold their lofty fortress, combined  to produce a victorious state of mind. Robert looked over the brink  once or twice at the steep slope, and he felt that the warriors would,  in truth, be taking a mighty risk, if they came up that steep path  against the three.
  He and Tayoga, in the heavy darkness, depended, like Willet, chiefly  on ear. It was impossible to see to the bottom of the valley, where the  dusk had rolled up like a sea, but, as the night was still, they felt  sure they could hear anyone climbing up the peak. In order to make  themselves more comfortable they spread their blankets at the very  brink, and lay down upon them, thus being able to repose, and at the  same time watch without the risk of inviting a shot.
  Young Lennox knew that the attack, if it came at all, would not come  until late, and restraining his naturally eager and impatient temper,  he used all the patience that his strong will could summon, never  ceasing meanwhile to lend an attentive ear to every sound of the night.  He heard the wind rise, moan a little while in the gorge and then die;  he heard a fitful breeze rustle the boughs on the slopes and then grow  still, and he heard his comrades move once or twice to ease their  positions, but no other sound came to him until nearly midnight, and  then he heard the fall of a pebble on the slope, absolute proof to one  experienced as he that it had been displaced by the incautious foot of  a climbing enemy.
  The rattling of the pebble was succeeded by a long interval of  silence, and the lad understood that too. The warriors, to whom time  was nothing, fearing that suspicion had been aroused by the fall of the  pebble, would wait until it had been lulled before resuming their  advance. They would flatten themselves like lizards against the slope,  not stirring an inch. But the three were as patient as they, and while  a full hour passed after the slip of the stone before the slightest  sound came from the slope, they did not relax their vigilance a  particle. Then all three heard a slight rustle among the bushes and  they peered cautiously over.
  They were able to discern the dim outline of figures among the  bushes about twenty feet below, and Wilier, who directed the defense,  whispered that Tayoga and he would take aim, while Robert held his fire  in reserve. Then the Onondaga and he picked their targets in the  darkness and pulled trigger. Shouts, the fall of bodies and the  crackling of rifles came back. A half dozen bullets, fired almost at  random, whistled over their heads and then Robert sent his own lead at  a shadow which appeared very clearly among the bushes, a crashing fall  following at once.
  Then the three, not waiting to reload, snatched out their pistols  and held themselves ready for a further attack, if it should come. But  it did not come. Even the rage of Tandakora had had enough. His second  repulse had been bloodier than the first, and it had been proved with  the lives of his warriors that they could not storm that terrible  steep, in the face of three such redoubtable marksmen.
  Robert heard a number of pebbles rolling now, but they were made by  men descending, and the three, certain of abundant leisure, reloaded  their rifles. Their eyes told them nothing, but they were as sure as if  they had seen them that the warriors had disappeared in the sea of  darkness with which the gulf was filled. The lad breathed a long sigh  of relief.
  &#8220;You're justified in your satisfaction,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;I think it's  the last direct attack they'll make upon us. Now they'll try the slow  methods of siege and our exhaustion by thirst, and how it would make  their venom rise if they knew anything about that glorious fountain of  ours! Since it's to be a test of patience, we'd better make things easy  for ourselves. I'll sit here and watch the slope, and, as the night is  turning cold, you and Tayoga, Robert, can build a fire.&#8221;
  There was a dip in the center of the crest, and in this they heaped  the fallen wood, which here as elsewhere in the wilderness was  abundant. Wood and water, two great requisites of primitive man, they  had in plenty, and had it not been for their eagerness to go forward  with their work they would have been content to stay indefinitely on  the peak.
  The fire was soon blazing cheerfully. Warriors on the opposing peaks  or crest might see it, but they did not care. No bullets from rival  heights could reach them and the light would appear to their enemies as  a beacon of defiance, a sort of challenge that was very pleasing to  Robert's soul. He basked in the glow and heat of the coals, ate bear  meat and wild pigeon for a late supper, and discoursed on the strength  of their natural fortress.
  &#8220;The peak was reared here by Areskoui for our especial benefit,&#8221; he  said. &#8220;It is in every sense a tower of strength, water even being  placed in its side that we might not die of thirst.&#8221;
  &#8220;And yet we cannot stay here always,&#8221; said the Onondaga. &#8220;Tomorrow  we must think of a way of escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let tomorrow take care of itself. Tayoga, you're too serious!  You're missing the pleasure of the night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dagaeoga loves to talk and he talks well. His voice is pleasant in  my ear like to the murmur of a silver brook. Perhaps he is right. Lo!  the clouds have gone, and I can see Tododaho on his star. Areskoui  watches over us by day and Tododaho by night. We are once more the  favorites of the Sun God and of the great Onondaga who went away to his  everlasting star more than four centuries ago. Again I say Dagaeoga is  right; I will enjoy the night, and let the morrow care for itself.&#8221;
  He drew the folds of his blanket to his chin and stretched his  length before the fire. Having made up his mind to be satisfied, Tayoga  would let nothing interfere with such a laudable purpose. Soon he slept  peacefully.
  &#8220;You might follow him,&#8221; said Willet.
  &#8220;I don't think I can do it now,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;I've a restless  spirit.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then wander about the peak, and I'll take up my old place at the  edge of the slope.&#8221;
  Robert went back to the far side, where he had stretched his rope of  grape vines down to the spring, and, craving their cool, fresh taste,  he ate more of the grapes. He noticed then that they were uncommonly  plentiful. All along the cliff they trailed in great, rich clusters,  black and glossy, fairly asking to be eaten. In places the vines hung  in perfect mazes, and he looked at them questioningly. Then the thought  came to him and he wondered why it had been so slow of arrival. He  returned to Willet and said:
  &#8220;I don't think you need watch any longer here, Dave.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; was the hunter's astonished reply.
  &#8220;Because we're going to leave the mountain.&#8221;
  &#8220;Leave the mountain! It's more likely, Robert, that your prudence  has left you. If we went down the slope we'd go squarely into the  horde, and then it would be a painful and lingering end for us.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't mean the slope. We're to go down the other side of the  cliff.&#8221;
  &#8220;Except here and near the bottom the mountain is as steep everywhere  as the side of a house. The only way for us to get down is to fall down  and then we'd stop too quick.&#8221;
  &#8220;We don't have to fall down, we'll climb down.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can't be done, Robert, my boy. There's not enough bushes.&#8221;
  &#8220;We don't need bushes, there are miles of grape vines as strong as  leather. All we have to do is to knot them together securely and our  rope is ready. If we eased our way to the spring with vines then we can  finish the journey to the bottom of the cliff with them.&#8221;
  The hunter's gaze met that of the lad, and it was full of approval.
  &#8220;I believe you've found the way, Robert,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;Wake Tayoga  and see what he thinks.&#8221;
  The Onondaga received the proposal with enthusiasm, and he made the  further suggestion that they build high the fire for the sake of  deceiving the besiegers.
  &#8220;And suppose we prop up two or three pieces of fallen tree trunk  before it,&#8221; added Robert. &#8220;Warriors watching on the opposite slopes  will take them for our figures and will not dream that we're attempting  to escape.&#8221;
  That idea, too, was adopted, and in a few minutes the fire was  blazing and roaring, while a stream of sparks drifted up merrily from  it to be lost in the dusk. Near it the fragments of tree trunks set  erect would pass easily, at a great distance and in the dark, for human  beings. Then, while Willet watched, Robert and Tayoga knotted the vines  with quick and dextrous hands, throwing the cable over a bough, and  trying every knot with their double weight. A full two hours they  toiled and then they exulted.
  &#8220;It will reach from the clump of bushes about the fountain to the  next clump below, which is low down,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and from there we  can descend without help.&#8221;
  They called Willet, and the three, leaving the crest which had been  such a refuge for them and which they had defended so well, descended  to the fountain. At that point they secured their cable with infinite  care to the largest of the dwarf trees and let it drop over across a  bare space to the next clump of bushes below, a distance that seemed  very great, it was so steep. Robert claimed the honor of the first  descent, but it was finally conceded to Tayoga, who was a trifle  lighter.
  The Onondaga fastened securely upon his back his rifle and his pack  containing food, and then, grasping the cable firmly with both hands,  he began to go down, while his friends watched with great anxiety. He  was not obliged to swing clear his whole weight, but was able to brace  his feet against the cliff. Thus he steadied the vines, but Robert and  Willet nevertheless breathed great sighs of relief, when he reached the  bushes below, and detached himself from the cable.
  &#8220;It is safe,&#8221; he called back.
  Robert went next and Willet followed. When the three were in the  bushes, clinging to their tough and wiry strength, they found that the  difficulties, as they invariably do, had decreased. Below them the  slope was not so steep by any means, and, by holding to the rocky  outcrops and scant bushes, they could make the full descent of the  mountain. While they rested for a little space where they were, Robert  suddenly began to laugh.
  &#8220;Is Dagaeoga rejoicing so soon?&#8221; asked Tayoga
  &#8220;Why shouldn't I laugh,&#8221; replied Robert, &#8220;when we have such a good  jest?&#8221;
  &#8220;What jest? I see none.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, to think of Tandakora sitting at the foot of our peak and  watching there three or four days, waiting all the time for us to die  of hunger and thirst, and we far to the south. At least he'll see that  the mountain doesn't get away, and Tandakora, I take it, has small  sense of humor. When he penetrates the full measure of the joke he'll  love us none the less. Perhaps, though, De Galissonniere will not  mourn, because he knows that if we were taken after a siege he could  not save us from the cruelty of the savages.&#8221;
  The hunter and the Onondaga were forced to laugh a little with him,  and then, rested thoroughly, they resumed the descent, leaving their  cable to tell its own tale, later on. The rest of the slope, although  possible, was slow and painful, testing their strength and skill to the  utmost, but they triumphed over everything and before day were in a  gorge, with the entire height of the peak towering above them and  directly between them and their enemies. Here they flung themselves on  the ground and rested until day, when they began a rapid flight  southward, curving about among the peaks, as the easiest way led them.
  The air rapidly grew warmer, showing that the sudden winter had come  only on the high mountains, and that autumn yet lingered on the lower  levels. The gorgeous reds and yellows and browns and vivid shades  between returned, but there was a haze in the air and the west was  dusky.
  &#8220;Storm will come again before night,&#8221; said Tayoga.
  &#8220;I think so too,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;and as I've no mind to be beaten  about by it, suppose we build a spruce shelter in the gorge here and  wait until it passes.&#8221;
  The two lads were more than willing, feeling that the chance of  pursuit had passed for a long time at least, and they set to work with  their sharp hatchets, rapidly making a crude but secure wickiup, as  usual against the rocky side of a hill. Before the task was done the  sky darkened much more, and far in the west thunder muttered.
  &#8220;It's rolling down a gorge,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and hark! you can hear it  also in the south.&#8221;
  From a point, far distant from the first, came a like rumble, and,  after a few moments of silence, a third rumble was heard to the east.  Silence again and then the far rumble came from the south.
  &#8220;That's odd,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;It isn't often that you hear thunder on  all sides of you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Listen!&#8221; exclaimed Tayoga, whose face bore a rapt and extraordinary  look. The four rumbles again went around the horizon, coming from one  point after the other in turn.
  &#8220;It is no ordinary thunder,&#8221; said the Onondaga in a tone of deep  conviction.
  &#8220;What is it, then?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;It is Manitou, Areskoui, Tododaho and Hayowentha talking together.  That is why we have the thunder north, east, south and west. Hear their  voices carrying all through the heavens!&#8221;
  &#8220;Which is Manitou?&#8221;
  &#8220;That I cannot tell. But the great gods talk, one with another,  though what they say is not for us to know. It is not right that mere  mortals like ourselves should understand them, when they speak across  infinite space.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may be that you're right, Tayoga,&#8221; said Willet.
  The three did not yet go into the spruce shelter, because, contrary  to the signs, there was no rain. The wind moaned heavily and thick  black clouds swept up in an almost continuous procession from the  western horizon, but they did not let a drop fall. The thunder at the  four points of the horizon went on, the reports moving from north to  east, and thence to south and west, and then around and around, always  in the same direction. After every crash there was a long rumble in the  gorges until the next crash came again. Now and then lightning flared.
  &#8220;It is not a storm after all,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;or, at least, if  a storm should come it will not be until after night is at hand, when  the great gods are through talking. Listen to the heavy booming, always  like the sound of a thousand big guns at one time. Now the lightning  grows and burns until it is at a white heat. The great gods not only  talk, but they are at play. They hurl thunderbolts through infinite  space, and watch them fall. Then they send thunder rumbling through our  mountains, and the sound is as soft to them as a whisper to us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Your idea is pretty sound, Tayoga,&#8221; said Willet, who had imbibed  more than a little of the Iroquois philosophy, &#8220;and it does look as if  the gods were at play because there is so much thunder and lightning  and no rain. Look at that flash on the mountain toward the east! I  think it struck. Yes, there goes a tree! When the gods play among the  peaks it's just as well for us to stay down here in the gorge.&#8221;
  &#8220;But the crashes still run regularly from north to east and on  around,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;I suppose that when they finish talking, the  rain will come, and we'll have plenty of need for our spruce shelter.&#8221;
  The deep rumbling continued all through the rest of the afternoon. A  dusk as of twilight arrived long before sunset, but it was of an  unusually dull, grayish hue, and it affected Robert as if he were  breathing an air surcharged with gunpowder. It colored and intensified  everything. The peaks and ridges rose to greater heights, the gorges  and valleys were deeper, the reports of the thunder, extremely heavy,  in fact, were doubled and tripled in fancy; all that Tayoga had said  about the play of the gods was true. Tododaho, the great Onondaga,  spoke across the void to Hayowentha, the great Mohawk, and Areskoui,  the Sun God, conversed with Manitou, the All Powerful, Himself.
  The imaginative lad felt awe but no fear. The gods at play in the  heavens would not condescend to harm a humble mortal like himself and  it was an actual pleasure because he was there to hear them. Just  before the invisible sun went over the rim of the horizon, a brilliant  red light shot for a minute or two from the west through the gray haze,  and fell on the faces of the three, sitting in silence before their  spruce shelter.
  &#8220;It is Areskoui throwing off his most brilliant beams before he  goes,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;Now I think the play will soon be over, and we may  look for the rain.&#8221;
  The crashes of thunder increased swiftly and greatly in violence,  and then, as the Onondaga had predicted, ceased abruptly. The silence  that followed was so heavy that it was oppressive. No current of air  was moving anywhere. Not a leaf stirred. The grayish haze became  thicker and every ridge and peak was hidden. Presently a sound like a  sigh came down the gorge, but it soon grew.
  &#8220;We'll go inside,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;because the deluge is at hand.&#8221;
  They crowded themselves into their crude little hut, and in five  minutes the flood was upon them, pouring with such violence that some  of it forced its way through the hasty thatch, but they were able to  protect themselves with their blankets, and they slept the night  through in a fair degree of comfort.
  In the morning they saw a world washed clean, bright and shining,  and they breathed an autumnal air wonderful in its purity. Feeling safe  now from pursuit, they were no longer eager to flee. A brief council of  three decided that they would hang once more on the French and Indian  flank. It had been their purpose to discover what was intended by the  formidable array they had seen, and it was their purpose yet.
  They did not go back on their path, but they turned eastward into a  land of little and beautiful lakes, through which one of the great  Indian trails from the northwest passed, and made a hidden camp near  the shore of a sheet of water about a mile square, set in the mountains  like a gem. They had method in locating here, as the trail ran through  a gorge less than half a mile to the east of their camp, and they had  an idea that the spy, Garay, might pass that way, two of them always  abiding by the trail, while the third remained in their secluded camp  or hunted game. Willet shot a deer and Tayoga brought down a rare wild  turkey, while Robert caught some wonderful lake trout. So they had  plenty of food, and they were content to wait.
  They were sure that Garay had not yet gone, as the storms that had  threatened them would certainly have delayed his departure, and neither  the hunter nor the Onondaga could discover any traces of footsteps.  Fortunately the air continued to turn warmer and the lower country in  which they now were had all the aspects of Indian summer. Robert,  shaken a little perhaps by the great hardships and dangers through  which he had passed, though he may not have realized at the time the  weight upon his nerves, recovered quickly, and, as usual, passed, with  the rebound, to the heights of optimism.
  &#8220;What do you expect to get from Garay?&#8221; he asked Willet as he  changed places with him on the trail.
  &#8220;I'm not sure,&#8221; replied the hunter, &#8220;but if we catch him we'll find  something. We've got to take our bird first, and then we'll see. He  went north and west with a message, and that being the case he's bound  to take one back. I don't think Garay is a first-class woodsman and we  may be able to seize him.&#8221;
  Robert was pleased with the idea of the hunted turning into the  hunters, and he and Tayoga now did most of the watching along the  trail, a watch that was not relaxed either by day or by night. On the  sixth night the two youths were together, and Tayoga thought he  discerned a faint light to the north.
  &#8220;It may be a low star shining over a hill,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;I think it is the glow from a small camp fire,&#8221; said the Onondaga.
  &#8220;It's a question that's decided easily.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean we'll stalk it, star or fire, whichever it may be?&#8221;
  &#8220;That is what we're here for, Tayoga.&#8221;
  They began an exceedingly cautious advance toward the light, and it  soon became evident that it was a fire, though, as Tayoga had said, a  small one, set in a little valley and almost hidden by the surrounding  foliage. Now they redoubled their caution, using every forest art to  make a silent approach, as they might find a band of warriors around  the blaze, and they did not wish to walk with open eyes into any such  deadly trap. Their delight was great when they saw only one man  crouched over the coals in a sitting posture, his head bent over his  knees; so that, in effect, only his back was visible, but they knew him  at once. It was Garay.
  The heart of young Lennox flamed with anger and triumph. Here was  the fellow who had tried to take his life in Albany, and, if he wished  revenge, the moment was full of opportunity. Yet he could never fire at  a man's back, and it was their cue, moreover, to take him alive.  Garay's rifle was leaning against a log, six or eight feet from him,  and his attitude indicated that he might be asleep. His clothing was  stained and torn, and he bore all the signs of a long journey and  extreme weariness.
  &#8220;See what it is to come into the forest and not be master of all its  secrets,&#8221; whispered Tayoga. &#8220;Garay is the messenger of Onontio (the  Governor General of Canada) and Tandakora, and yet he sleeps, when  those who oppose him are abroad.&#8221;
  &#8220;A man has to sleep some time or other,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;or at least a  white man must. We're not all like an Iroquois; we can't stay awake  forever if need be.&#8221;
  &#8220;If one goes to the land of Tarenyawagon when his enemies are at  hand he must pay the price, Dagaeoga, and now the price that Garay is  going to pay will be a high one. Surely Manitou has delivered him,  helpless, into our hands. Come, we will go closer.&#8221;
  They crept through the bushes until they could have reached out and  touched the spy with the muzzles of their rifles, and still he did not  stir. Into that heavy and weary brain, plunged into dulled slumbers,  entered no thought of a stalking foe. The fire sank and the bent back  sagged a little lower. Garay had traveled hard and long. He was anxious  to get back to Albany with what he knew, and he felt sure that the  northern forests contained only friends. He had built his fire without  apprehension, and sleep had overtaken him quickly.
  A fox stirred in the thicket beyond the fire and looked suspiciously  at the coals and the still figure beyond them. He did not see the other  two figures in the bushes but his animosity as well as his suspicion  was aroused. He edged a little nearer, and then a slight sound in the  thicket caused him to creep back. But he was an inquiring fox, and,  although he buried himself under a bush, he still looked, staring with  sharp, intent eyes.
  He saw a shadow glide from the thicket, pick up the rifle of Garay  which leaned against the fallen log, and then glide back, soundless.  The curiosity of the fox now prevailed over his suspicion. The shadow  had not menaced him, and his vulpine intelligence told him that he was  not concerned in the drama now about to unfold itself. He was merely a  spectator, and, as he looked, he saw the shadow glide back and crouch  beside the sleeping man. Then a second shadow came and crouched on the  other side.
  What the fox saw was the approach of Robert and Tayoga, whom some  whimsical humor had seized. They intended to make the surprise complete  and Robert, with a memory of the treacherous shot in Albany, was  willing also to fill the soul of the spy with terror. Tayoga adroitly  removed the pistol and knife from the belt of Garay, and Robert touched  him lightly on the shoulder. Still he did not stir, and then the youth  brought his hand down heavily.
  Garay uttered the sigh of one who comes reluctantly from the land of  sleep and who would have gone back through the portals which were only  half opened, but Robert brought his hand down again, good and hard.  Then his eyes flew open and he saw the calm face beside him, and the  calm eyes less than a foot away, staring straight into his own. It must  be an evil dream, he thought at first, but it had all the semblance of  reality, and, when he turned his head in fear, he saw another face on  the other side of him, carved in red bronze, it too only a foot away  and staring at him in stern accusation.
  Then all the faculties of Garay, spy and attempted assassin, leaped  into life, and he uttered a yell of terror, springing to his feet, as  if he had been propelled by a galvanic battery. Strong hands, seizing  him on either side, pulled him down again and the voice of Tayoga, of  the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the great League of  the Hodenosaunee said insinuatingly in his ear:
  &#8220;Sit down, Achille Garay! Here are two who wish to talk with you!&#8221;
  He fell back heavily and his soul froze within him, as he recognized  the faces. His figure sagged, his eyes puffed out, and he waited in  silent terror.
  &#8220;I see that you recognize us, Achille Garay,&#8221; said Robert, whose  whimsical humor was still upon him. &#8220;You'll recall that shot in Albany.  Perhaps you did not expect to meet my friend and me here in the heart  of the northern forests, but here we are. What have you to say for  yourself?&#8221;
  Garay strove to speak, but the half formed words died on his lips.
  &#8220;We wish explanations about that little affair in Albany,&#8221; continued  his merciless interlocutor, &#8220;and perhaps there is no better time than  the present. Again I repeat, what have you to say? And you have also  been in the French and Indian camp. You bore a message to St. Luc and  Tandakora and beyond a doubt you bear another back to somebody. We want  to know about that too. Oh, we want to know about many things!&#8221;
  &#8220;I have no message,&#8221; stammered Garay.
  &#8220;Your word is not good. We shall find methods of making you talk.  You have been among the Indians and you ought to know something about  these methods. But first I must lecture you on your lack of woodcraft.  It is exceedingly unwise to build a fire in the wilderness and go to  sleep beside it, unless there is someone with you to watch. I'm ashamed  of you, Monsieur Garay, to have neglected such an elementary lesson. It  made your capture easy, so ridiculously easy that it lacked piquancy  and interest. Tayoga and I were not able to give our faculties and  strength the healthy exercise they need. Come now, are you ready to  walk?&#8221;
  &#8220;What are you going to do with me?&#8221; asked Garay in French, which  both of his captors understood and spoke.
  &#8220;We haven't decided upon that,&#8221; replied Robert maliciously, &#8220;but  whatever it is we'll make it varied and lively. It may please you to  know that we've been waiting several days for you, but we scarce  thought you'd go to sleep squarely in the trail, just where we'd be  sure to see you. Stand up now and march like a man, ready to meet any  fate. Fortune has turned against you, but you still have the chance to  show your Spartan courage and endurance.&#8221;
  &#8220;The warrior taken by his enemies meets torture and death with a  heroic soul,&#8221; said Tayoga solemnly.
  Garay shivered.
  &#8220;You'll save me from torture?&#8221; he said to Robert.
  Young Lennox shook his head.
  &#8220;I'd do so if it were left to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but my friend, Tayoga,  has a hard heart. In such matters as these he will not let me have my  way. He insists upon the ancient practices of his nation. Also, David  Willet, the hunter, is waiting for us, and he too is strong for extreme  measures. You'll soon face him. Now, march straight to the right!&#8221;
  Garay with a groan raised himself to his feet and walked unsteadily  in the direction indicated. Close behind him came the avenging two.
