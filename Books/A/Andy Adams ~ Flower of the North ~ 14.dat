  Philip sat where Jeanne had left him. He was powerless to move or   to say a word that might have recalled her. Her own grief,  quivering  in that one piteous sob, overwhelmed him. It held him  mute and  listening, with the hope that each instant the tent-flap  might open  and Jeanne reappear. And yet if she came he had no  words to say.  Unwittingly he had probed deep into one of those  wounds that never  heal, and he realized that to ask forgiveness  would be but another  blunder. He almost groaned as he thought of  what he had done. In his  desire to understand, to know more about  Jeanne, he had driven her  into a corner. What he had forced from  her he might have learned a  little later from Pierre or from the  father at Fort o' God. He thought  that Jeanne must despise him  now, for he had taken advantage of her  helplessness and his own  position. He had saved her from her enemies;  and in return she had  opened her heart, naked and bleeding, to his  eyes. What she had  told him was not a voluntary confidence; it was a  confession wrung  from her by the rack of his questionings&#8212;the  confession that she  was a waif-child, that Pierre was not her brother,  and that the  man at Fort o' God was not her father. He had gone to the  very  depths of that which was sacred to herself and those whom she   loved. 
  He rose and stirred the fire, and stray ends of birch leaped into   flame, lighting his pale face. He wanted to go to the tent, kneel   there where Jeanne could hear him, and tell her that it was all a   mistake. Yet he knew that this could not be, neither the next day  nor  the next, for to plead extenuation for himself would be to  reveal his  love. Two or three times he had been on the point of  revealing that  love. Only now, after what had happened, did it  occur to him that to  disclose his heart to Jeanne would be the  greatest crime he could  commit. She was alone with him in the  heart of a wilderness, dependent  upon him, upon his honor. He  shivered when he thought how narrow had  been his escape, how short  a time he had known her, and how in that  brief spell he had given  himself up to an almost insane hope. To him  Jeanne was not a  stranger. She was the embodiment, in flesh and blood,  of the  spirit which had been his companion for so long. He loved her  more  than ever now, for Jeanne the lost child of the snows was more  the  earthly revelation of his beloved spirit than Jeanne the sister of   Pierre. But&#8212;what was he to Jeanne? 
  He left the fire and went to the pile of balsam which he had   spread out between two rocks for his bed. He lay down and pulled   Pierre's blanket over him, but his fatigue and his desire for  sleep  seemed to have left him, and it was a long time before  slumber finally  drove from him the thought of what he had done.  After that he did not  move. He heard none of the sounds of the  night. A little owl, the  devil-witch, screamed horribly overhead  and awakened Jeanne, who sat  up for a few moments in her balsam  bed, white-faced and shivering. But  Philip slept. Long afterward  something warm awakened him, and he  opened his eyes, thinking that  it was the glow of the fire in his  face. It was the sun. He heard  a sound which brought him quickly into  consciousness of day. It  was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the  rocks. 
  He had dreaded the coming of morning, when he would have to face   Jeanne. His guilt hung heavily upon him. But the sound of her  voice,  low and sweet, filled with the carroling happiness of a  bird, brought  a glad smile to his lips. After all, Jeanne had  understood him. She  had forgiven him, if she had not forgotten. 
  For the first time he noticed the height of the sun, and he sat   bolt upright. Jeanne saw his head and shoulders pop over the top  of  the rocks, and she laughed at him from their stone table. 
  &quot;I've been keeping breakfast for over an hour, M'sieur Philip,&quot;   she cried. &quot;Hurry down to the creek and wash yourself, or I shall  eat  all alone!&quot; 
  Philip rose stupidly and looked at his watch. 
  &quot;Eight o'clock!&quot; he gasped. &quot;We should have been ten miles on the   way by this time!&quot; 
  Jeanne was still laughing at him. Like sunlight she dispelled his   gloom of the night before. A glance around the camp showed him  that  she must have been awake for at least two hours. The packs  were filled  and strapped. The silken tent was down and folded. She  had gathered  wood, built the fire, and cooked breakfast while he  slept. And now she  stood a dozen paces from him, blushing a little  at his amazed stare,  waiting for him. 
  &quot;It's deuced good of you, Miss Jeanne!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I don't   deserve such kindness from you.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh!&quot; said Jeanne, and that was all. She bent over the fire, and   Philip went to the creek. 
  He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon   himself. As he doused his face in the cold water his resolutions   formed themselves. For the next few days he would forget  everything  but the one fact that Jeanne was in his care; he would  not hurt her  again or compel her confidence. 
  It was after nine o'clock before they were upon the river. They   paddled without a rest until twelve. After lunch Philip  confiscated  Jeanne's paddle and made her sit facing him in the  canoe. 
  The afternoon passed like a dream to Philip, He did not refer   again to Fort o' God or the people there; he did not speak again  of  Eileen Brokaw, of Lord Fitzhugh, or of Pierre. He talked of  himself  and of those things which had once been his life. He told  of his  mother and his father, who had died, and of the little  sister, whom he  had worshiped, but who had gone with the others.  He bared his  loneliness to her as he would have told them to the  sister, had she  lived; and Jeanne's soft blue eyes were filled  with tenderness and  sympathy. And then he talked of Gregson's  world. Within himself he  called it no longer his own. 
  It was Jeanne who questioned now. She asked about cities and great   people, about books and WOMEN. Her knowledge amazed Philip. She  might  have visited the Louvre. One would have guessed that she had  walked in  the streets of Paris, Berlin, and London. She spoke of  Johnson, of  Dickens, and of Balzac as though they had died but  yesterday. She was  like one who had been everywhere and yet saw  everything through a veil  that bewildered her. In her simplicity  she unfolded herself to Philip,  leaf by leaf, petal by petal, like  the morning apios that surrenders  its mysteries to the sun. She  knew the world which he had come from,  its people, its cities, its  greatness; and yet her knowledge was like  that of the blind. She  knew, but she had never seen; and in her  wistfulness to see as HE  could see there was a sweetness and a pathos  which made every  fiber in his body sing with a quiet and thrilling  joy. He knew,  now, that the man who was at Fort o' God must, indeed,  be the most  wonderful man in the world. For out of a child of the  snows, of  the forest, of a savage desolation, he had made Jeanne. And  Jeanne  was glorious! 
  The afternoon passed, and they made thirty miles before they   camped for the night. They traveled the next day, and the one that   followed. On the afternoon of the fourth they were approaching Big   Thunder Rapids, close to the influx of the Little Churchill, sixty   miles from Fort o' God. 
  These days, too, passed for Philip with joyous swiftness; swiftly   because they were too short for him. His life, now, was Jeanne.  Each  day she became a more vital part of him. She crept into his  soul until  there was no longer left room for any other thought  than of her. And  yet his happiness was tampered by a thing which,  if not grief,  depressed and saddened him at times. Two days more  and they would be  at Fort o' God, and there Jeanne would be no  longer his own, as she  was now. Even the wilderness has its  conventionality, and at Fort o'  God their comradeship would end. A  day of rest, two at the most, and  he would leave for the camp on  Blind Indian Lake. As the time drew  nearer when they would be but  friends and no longer comrades, Philip  could not always hide the  signs of gloom which weighed upon him. He  revealed nothing in  words; but now and then Jeanne had caught him when  the fears at  his heart betrayed themselves in his face. Jeanne became  happier  as their journey approached its end. She was alive every  moment,  joyous, expectant, looking ahead to Fort o' God; and this in   itself was a bitterness to Philip, though he knew that he was a  fool  for allowing it to be so. He reasoned, with dull, masculine  wit, that  if Jeanne cared for him at all she would not be so  anxious for their  comradeship to end. But these moods, when they  came, passed quickly.  And on this afternoon of the fourth day they  passed away entirely, for  in an instant there came a solution to  it all. They had known each  other but four days, yet that brief  time had encompassed what might  not have been in as many years.  Life, smooth, uneventful, develops  friendship slowly; an hour of  the unusual may lay bare a soul. Philip  thought of Eileen Brokaw,  whose heart was still a closed mystery to  him; who was a stranger,  in spite of the years he had known her. In  four days he had known  Jeanne a lifetime; in those four days Jeanne  had learned more of  him than Eileen Brokaw could ever know. So he  arrived at the  resolution which made him, too, look eagerly ahead to  the end of  the journey. At Fort o' God he would tell Jeanne of his  love. 
  Jeanne was looking at him when the determination came. She saw the   gloom pass, a flush mount into his face; and when he saw her eyes   upon him he laughed, without knowing why. 
  &quot;If it is so funny,&quot; she said, &quot;please tell me.&quot; 
  It was a temptation, but he resisted it. 
  &quot;It is a secret,&quot; he said, &quot;which I shall keep until we reach Fort   o' God.&quot; 
  Jeanne turned her face up-stream to listen. A dozen times she had   done this during the last half-hour, and Philip had listened with   her. At first they had heard a distant murmur, rising as they   advanced, like an autumn wind that grows stronger each moment in  the  tree-tops. The murmur was steady now, without the variations  of a  wind. It was the distant roaring of the rocks and rushing  floods of  Big Thunder Rapids. It grew steadily from a murmur to a  moan, from a  moan to rumbling thunder. The current became so swift  that Philip was  compelled to use all his strength to force the  canoe ahead. A few  moments later he turned into shore. 
  From where they landed, a worn trail led up to one of the   precipitous walls of rock and shut in the Big Thunder Rapids.   Everything about them was rock. The trail was over rock, worn  smooth  by the countless feet of centuries&#8212;clawed feet, naked  feet,  moccasined feet, the feet of white men. It was the Great  Portage, for  animal as well as man. Philip went up with the pack,  and Jeanne  followed behind him. The thunder increased. It roared  in their ears  until they could no longer hear their own voices.  Directly above the  rapids the trail was narrow, scarcely eight  feet in width, shut in on  the land side by a mountain wall, on the  other by the precipice.  Philip looked behind, and saw Jeanne  hugging close to the wall. Her  face was white, her eyes shone with  terror and awe. He spoke to her,  but she saw only the movement of  his lips. Then he put down his pack  and went close to the edge of  the precipice. 
  Sixty feet below him was the Big Thunder, a chaos of lashing foam,   of slippery, black-capped rocks bobbing and grimacing amid the   rushing torrents like monsters playing at hide-and-seek. Now one  rose  high, as though thrust up out of chaos by giant hands; then  it sank  back, and milk-white foam swirled softly over the place  where it had  been. There seemed to be life in the chaos&#8212;a grim,  terrible life  whose voice was a thunder that never died. For a few  moments Philip  stood fascinated by the scene below him. Then he  felt a touch upon his  arm. It was Jeanne. She stood beside him  quivering, dead-white, Almost  daring to take the final step.  Philip caught her hands firmly in his  own, and Jeanne looked over.  Then she darted back and hovered,  shuddering, near the wall. 
  The portage was a short one, scarce two hundred yards in length,   and at the upper end was a small green meadow in which river  voyagers  camped. It still lacked two hours of dusk when Philip  carried over the  last of the luggage. 
  &quot;We will not camp here,&quot; he said to Jeanne pointing to the remains   of numerous fires and remembering Pierre's exhortation. &quot;It is too   public, as you might say. Besides, that noise makes me deaf.&quot; 
  Jeanne shuddered. 
  &quot;Let us hurry,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm&#8212;I'm afraid of THAT!&quot; 
  Philip carried the canoe down to the river, and Jeanne followed   with the bearskins. The current was soft and sluggish, with tiny   maelstroms gurgling up here and there, like air-bubbles in boiling   syrup. He only half launched the canoe, and Jeanne remained while  he  went for another load. The dip, kept green by the water of a  spring,  was a pistol-shot from the river. Philip looked back from  the crest  and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe. Then he descended  into the  meadow, whistling. He had reached the packs when to his  ears there  seemed to come a sound that rose faintly above the roar  of the water  in the chasm. He straightened himself and listened. 
  &quot;Philip! Philip!&quot; 
  The cry came twice&#8212;his own name, piercing, agonizing, rising   above the thunder of the floods. He heard no more, but raced up  the  slope of the dip. From the crest he stared down to where  Jeanne had  been. She was gone. The canoe was gone. A terrible fear  swept upon  him, and for an instant he turned faint. Jeanne's cry  came to him  again. 
  &quot;Philip! Philip!&quot; 
  Like a madman he dashed up the rocky trail to the chasm, calling   to Jeanne, shrieking to her, telling her that he was coming. He   reached the edge of the precipice and looked down. Below him was  the  canoe and Jeanne. She was fighting futilely against the  resistless  flood; he saw her paddle wrenched suddenly from her  hands, and as it  went swirling beyond her reach she cried out his  name again. Philip  shouted, and the girl's white face was turned  up to him. Fifty yards  ahead of her were the first of the rocks.  In another minute, even  less, Jeanne would be dashed to pieces  before his eyes. Thoughts,  swifter than light, flashed through his  mind. He could do nothing for  her, for it seemed impossible that  any living creature could exist  amid the maelstroms and rocks  ahead. And yet she was calling to him.  She was reaching up her  arms to him. She had faith in him, even in the  face of death. 
  &quot;Philip! Philip!&quot; 
  There was no M'SIEUR to that cry now, only a moaning, sobbing   prayer filled with his name. 
  &quot;I'm coming, Jeanne!&quot; he shouted. &quot;I'm coming! Hold fast to the   canoe!&quot; 
  He ran ahead, stripping off his coat. A little below the first   rocks a stunted banskian grew out of an earthy fissure in the  cliff,  with its lower branches dipping within a dozen feet of the  stream. He  climbed out on this with the quickness of a squirrel,  and hung to a  limb with both hands, ready to drop alongside the  canoe. There was one  chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne. It  was a chance out of a  thousand&#8212;ten thousand. If he could drop at  the right moment, seize  the stern of the canoe, and make a rudder  of himself, he could keep  the craft from turning broadside and  might possibly guide it between  the rocks below. This one hope was  destroyed as quickly as it was  born. The canoe crashed against the  first rock. A smother of foam rose  about it and he saw Jeanne  suddenly engulfed and lost. Then she  reappeared, almost under him,  and he launched himself downward,  clutching at her dress with his  hands. By a supreme effort he caught  her around the waist with his  left arm, so that his right was free. 
  Ahead of them was a boiling sea of white, even more terrible than   when they had looked down upon it from above. The rocks were  hidden  by mist and foam; their roar was deafening. Between Philip  and the  awful maelstrom of death there was a quieter space of  water, black,  sullen, and swift&#8212;the power itself, rushing on to  whip itself into  ribbons among the taunting rocks that barred its  way to the sea. In  that space Philip looked at Jeanne. Her face  was against his breast.  Her eyes met his own, and In that last  moment, face to face with  death, love leaped above all fear. They  were about to die, and Jeanne  would die in his arms. She was his  now&#8212;forever. His hold tightened.  Her face came nearer. He wanted  to shout, to let her know what he had  meant to say at Fort o' God.  But his voice would have been like a  whisper in a hurricane. Could  Jeanne understand? The wall of foam was  almost in their faces.  Suddenly he bent down, crushed his face to  hers, and kissed her  again and again. Then, as the maelstrom engulfed  them, he swung  his own body to take the brunt of the shock. 
  He no longer reasoned beyond one thing. He must keep his body   between Jeanne and the rocks. He would be crushed, beaten to  pieces,  made unrecognizable, but Jeanne would be only drowned. He  fought to  keep himself half under her, with his head and shoulders  in advance.  When he felt the floods sucking him under, he thrust  her upward. He  fought, and did not know what happened. Only there  was the crashing of  a thousand cannon in his ears, and he seemed  to live through an  eternity. They thundered about him, against  him, ahead of him, and  then more and more behind. He felt no pain,  no shock. It was the SOUND  that he seemed to be fighting; in the  buffeting of his body against  the rocks there was the painlessness  of a knife-thrust delivered amid  the roar of battle. And the sound  receded. It was thundering in  retreat, and a curious thought came  to him. Providence had delivered  him through the maelstrom. He had  not struck the rocks. He was saved.  And in his arms he held  Jeanne. 
  It was day when he began the fight, broad day. And now it was   night. He felt earth, under his feet, and he knew that he had  brought  Jeanne ashore. He heard her voice speaking his name; and  he was so  glad that he laughed and sobbed like a babbling idiot.  It was dark,  and he was tired. He sank down, and he could feel  Jeanne's arms  striving to hold him up, and he could still hear her  voice. But  nothing could keep him from sleeping. And during that  sleep he had  visions. Now it was day, and he saw Jeanne's face  over him; again it  was night, and he heard only the roaring of the  flood. Again he heard  voices, Jeanne's voice and a man's, and he  wondered who the man could  be. It was a strange sleep filled with  strange dreams. But at last the  dreams seemed to go. He lost  himself. He awoke, and the night had  turned into day. He was in a  tent, and the sun was gleaming on the  outside. It had been a  curious dream, and he sat up astonished. 
  There was a man sitting beside him. It was Pierre. 
  &quot;Thank God, M'sieur!&quot; he heard. &quot;We have been waiting for this.   You are saved!&quot; 
  &quot;Pierre!&quot; he gasped. 
  Memory returned to him. He was awake. He felt weak, but he knew   that what he saw was not the vision of a dream. 
  &quot;I came the day after you went through the rapids,&quot; explained   Pierre, seeing his amazement. &quot;You saved Jeanne. She was not hurt.   But you were badly bruised, M'sieur, and you have been in a  fever.&quot; 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;was not&#8212;hurt?&quot; 
  &quot;No. She cared for you until I came. She is sleeping now.&quot; 
  &quot;I have not been this way&#8212;very long, have I, Pierre?&quot; 
  &quot;I came yesterday,&quot; said Pierre. He bent over Philip, and added:   &quot;You must remain quiet for a little longer, M'sieur. I have  brought  you a letter from M'sieur Gregson, and when you read that  I will have  some broth made for you.&quot; 
  Philip took the letter and opened it as Pierre went quietly out of   the tent. Gregson had written him but a few lines. He wrote: 
  MY DEAR PHIL,&#8212;I hope you'll forgive me. But I'm tired of this   mess. I was never cut out for the woods, and so I'm going to  dismiss  myself, leaving all best wishes behind for you. Go in and  fight.  You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win. I'll only  be in the  way. So I'm going back with the ship, which leaves in  three or four  days. Was going to tell you this on the night you  disappeared. Am  sorry I couldn't shake hands with you before I  left. Write and let me  know how things come out. As ever, 
  TOM. 
  Stunned, Philip dropped the letter. He lifted his eyes, and a   strange cry burst from his lips. Nothing that Gregson had written   could have wrung that cry from him. It was Jeanne. She stood in  the  open door of the tent. But it was not the Jeanne he had known.  A  terrible grief was written in her face. Her lips were bloodless,  her  eyes lusterless; deep suffering seemed to have put hollows in  her  cheeks. In a moment she had fallen upon her knees beside him  and  clasped one of his hands in both of her own. 
  &quot;I am so glad,&quot; she whispered, chokingly. 
  For an instant she pressed his hands to her face. 
  &quot;I am so glad&#8212;&quot; 
  She rose to her feet, swaying slightly. She turned to the door,   and Philip could hear her sobbing as she left him.
