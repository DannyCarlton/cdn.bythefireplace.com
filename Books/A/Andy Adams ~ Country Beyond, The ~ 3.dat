  From the little old cabin of dead Indian Tom, built in a grassy   glade close to the shore of Sucker Creek, came the sound of a  man's  laughter. In this late afternoon the last flooding gold of  the sun  filled the open door of the poplar shack. The man's  laughter, like the  sun on the mottled tapestry of the poplar-wood,  was a heart-lightening  thing there on the edge of the great swamp  that swept back for miles  to the north and west. It was the sort  of laughter one seldom hears  from a man, not riotous of over-bold,  but a big, clean laughter that  came from the soul out. It was an  infectious thing. It drove the gloom  out of the blackest night. It  dispelled fear, and if ever there were  devils lurking in the edge  of old Indian Tom's swamp they slunk away  at the sound of it. And  more than once, as those who lived in tepee  and cabin and far-away  shack could testify, that laugh had driven back  death itself. 
  In the shack, this last day of May afternoon, stood leaning over a   rough table the man of the laugh&#8212;Roger McKay, known as Jolly  Roger,  outlaw extraordinary, and sought by the men of every Royal  Northwest  Mounted Police patrol north of the Height of Land. 
  It was incongruous and inconceivable to think of him as an outlaw,   as he stood there in the last glow of the sun&#8212;an outlaw with the   weirdest and strangest record in all the northland hung up against   his name. He was not tall, and neither was he short, and he was as   plump as an apple and as rosy as its ripest side. There was  something  cherubic in the smoothness and the fullness of his face,  the clear  gray of his eyes, the fine-spun blond of his short-  cropped hair, and  the plumpness of his hands and half-bared arms.  He was a priestly,  well-fed looking man, was this Jolly Roger,  rotund and convivial in  all his proportions, and some in great  error would have called him  fat. But it was a strange kind of  fatness, as many a man on the trail  could swear to. And as for  sin, or one sign of outlawry, it could not  be found in any mark  upon him&#8212;unless one closed his eyes to all else  and guessed it by  the belt and revolver holster which he wore about  his rotund  waist. In every other respect Jolly Roger appeared to be  not only  a harmless creature, but one especially designed by the  Creator of  things to spread cheer and good-will wherever he went. His  age, if  he had seen fit to disclose it, was thirty-four. 
  There seemed, at first, to be nothing that even a contented man   might laugh at in the cabin, and even less to bring merriment from   one on whose head a price was set&#8212;unless it was the delicious  aroma  of a supper just about ready to be served. On a little stove  in the  farthest corner of the shack the breasts of two spruce  partridges were  turning golden brown in a skittle, and from the  broken neck of a  coffee pot a rich perfume was rising with the  steam. Piping hot in the  open oven half a dozen baked potatoes  were waiting in their crisp  brown jackets. 
  From the table Jolly Roger turned, rubbing his hands and chuckling   as he went for a third time to a low shelf built against the cabin   wall. There he carefully raised a mass of old papers from a box,  and  at the movement there came a protesting squeak, and a little  brown  mouse popped up to the edge of it and peered at him with a  pair of  bright little questioning eyes. 
  &quot;You little devil!&quot; he exulted. &quot;You nervy little devil!&quot; 
  He raised the papers higher, and again looked upon his discovery   of half an hour ago. In a soft nest lay four tiny mice, still  naked  and blind, and as he lowered the mass of papers the mother  burrowed  back to them, and he could hear her squeaking and  chirruping to the  little ones, as if she was trying to tell them  not to be afraid of  this man, for she knew him very well, and it  wasn't in his mind to  hurt them. And Jolly Roger, as he returned  to the setting of his  table, laughed again&#8212;and the laugh rolled  out into the golden sunset,  and from the top of a spruce at the  edge of the creek a big blue-jay  answered it in a riotous  challenge. 
  But at the bottom of that laugh, if one could have looked a bit   deeper, was something more than the naked little mice in the nest  of  torn-up paper. Today happiness had strangely come this gay-  hearted  freebooter's way, and he might have reached out, and  seized it, and  have kept it for his own. But in the hour of his  opportunity he had  refused it&#8212;because he was an outlaw&#8212;because  strong within him was a  peculiar code of honor all his own. There  was nothing of man-made  religion in the soul of Roger McKay.  Nature was his god; its  manifestations, its life, and the air it  gave him to breathe were the  pages which made up the Book that  guided him. And within the last  hour, since the sun had begun to  drop behind the tips of the tallest  trees, these things had told  him that he was a fool for turning away  from the one great thing  in all life&#8212;simply because his own humors of  existence had made  him an outcast and hunted by the laws of men. So  the change had  come, and for a space his soul was filled with the  thrill of song  and laughter. 
  Half an hour ago he believed that he had definitely made up his   mind. He had forced himself into forgetfulness of laws he had  broken,  and the scarlet-coated men who were ever on the watch for  his trail.  They would never seek him here, in the wilderness  country close to the  edge of civilization, and time, he had told  himself in that moment of  optimism, would blot out both his  identity and his danger. Tomorrow he  would go over to Cragg's  Ridge again, and then&#8212; 
  His mind was crowded with a vision of blue eyes, of brown curls   glowing in the pale sun, of a wistful, wide-eyed little face  turned  up to him, and red lips that said falteringly, &quot;I don't  think it's  wrong for you to kiss me&#8212;if you want to, Mister Jolly  Roger!&quot; 
  Boldly he had talked about it to the bright-eyed little mother-   mouse who peered at him now and then over the edge of her box. 
  &quot;You're a little devil of iniquity yourself,&quot; he told her. &quot;You're   a regular Mrs. Captain Kidd, and you've eaten my cheese, and  chawed  my snowshoe laces, and robbed me of a sock to make your  nest. I ought  to catch you in a trap, or blow your head off. But I  don't. I let you  live&#8212;and have a fam'ly. And it's you who have  given me the Big Idea,  Mrs. Captain Kidd. You sure have! You've  told me I've got a right to  have a nest of my own, and I'm going  to have it&#8212;an' in that nest is  going to be the sweetest,  prettiest little angel that God Almighty  ever forgot to make into  a flower! Yessir. And if the law comes&#8212;&quot; 
  And then, suddenly, the vision clouded, and there came into Jolly   Roger's face the look of a man who knew&#8212;when he stood the truth  out  naked&#8212;that he was facing a world with his back to the wall. 
  And now, as the sun went down, and his supper waited&#8212;that cloud   which came to blot out his picture grew deeper and more sinister,  and  the chill of it entered his heart. He turned from his table to  the  open door, and his fingers drew themselves slowly into  clenched fists,  and he looked out quietly and steadily into his  world. The darkening  depths of the forest reached out before his  eyes, mottled and painted  in the fading glory of the sun. It was  his world, his  everything&#8212;father, mother, God. In it he was born,  and in it he knew  that some day he would die. He loved it,  understood it, and night and  day, in sunshine and storm, its  mighty spirit was the spirit that kept  him company. But it held no  message for him now. And his ears scarcely  heard the raucous  scolding of the blue-jay in the fire-tipped crest of  the tall  black spruce. 
  And then that something which was bigger than desire came up   within him, and forced itself in words between his grimly set  lips. 
  &quot;She's only a&#8212;a kid,&quot; he said, a fierce, low note of defiance in   his voice. &quot;And I&#8212;I'm a damned pirate, and there's jails waiting  for  me, and they'll get me sooner or later, sure as God lets me  live!&quot; 
  He turned from the sun to his shadowing cabin, and for a moment a   ghost of a smile played in his face as he heard the little mother-   mouse rustling among her papers. 
  &quot;We can't do it,&quot; he said. &quot;We simply can't do it, Mrs. Captain   Kidd. She's had hell enough without me taking her into another.  And  it'd be that, sooner or later. It sure would, Mrs. Captain  Kidd. But  I'm glad, mighty glad, to think she'd let me kiss her&#8212;  if I wanted  to. Think of that, Mrs. Captain Kidd!&#8212;if I wanted to.  Oh, Lord!&quot; 
  And the humor of it crept in alongside the tragedy in Jolly   Roger's heart, and he chuckled as he bent over his partridge  breasts. 
  &quot;If I wanted to,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Why, if I had a life to give, I'd   give it&#8212;to kiss her just once! But, as it happens, Mrs. Captain   Kidd&#8212;&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's breath cut itself suddenly short, and for an instant   he grew tense as he bent over the stove. His philosophy had taught   him one thing above all others, that he was a survival of the   fittest&#8212;only so long as he survived. And he was always guarding   against the end. His brain was keen, his ears quick, and every  fibre  in him trained to its duty of watchfulness. And he knew,  without  turning his head, that someone was standing in the doorway  behind him.  There had come a faint noise, a shadowing of the  fading sun-glow on  the wall, the electrical disturbance of another  presence, gazing at  him quietly, without motion, and without  sound. After that first  telegraphic shock of warning he stabbed  his fork into a partridge  breast, flopped it over, chuckled  loudly&#8212;and then with a lightning  movement was facing the door,  his forty-four Colt leveled waist-high  at the intruder. 
  Almost in the same movement his gun-arm dropped limply to his   side. 
  &quot;Well, I'll be&#8212;&quot; 
  He stared. And the face in the doorway stared back at him. 
  &quot;Nada!&quot; he gasped. &quot;Good Lord, I thought&#8212;I thought&#8212;&quot; He   swallowed as he tried to lie. &quot;I thought&#8212;it might be a bear!&quot; 
  He did not, at first, see that the slim, calico-dressed little   figure of Jed Hawkins' foster-girl was almost dripping wet. Her  blue  eyes were shining at him, wide and startled. Her cheeks were  flushed.  A strange look had frozen on her parted red lips, and her  hair was  falling loose in a cloud of curling brown tresses about  her shoulders.  Jolly Roger, dreaming of her in his insane  happiness of a few minutes  ago, sensed nothing beyond the beauty  and the unexpectedness of her in  this first moment. Then&#8212;swiftly  &#8212;he saw the other thing. The last  glow of the sun glistened in her  wet hair, her dress was sodden and  clinging, and little pools of  water were widening slowly about her  ragged shoes. These things he  might have expected, for she had to  cross the creek. But it was  the look in her eyes that startled him, as  she stood there with  Peter, the mongrel pup, clasped tightly in her  arms. 
  &quot;Nada, what's happened?&quot; he asked, laying his gun on the table.   &quot;You fell in the creek&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;It&#8212;it's Peter,&quot; she cried, with a sobbing break in her voice.   &quot;We come on Jed Hawkins when he was diggin' up some of his  whiskey,  and he was mad, and pulled my hair, and Peter bit him&#8212;  and then he  picked up Peter and threw him against a rock&#8212;and he's  terribly hurt!  Oh, Mister Jolly Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  She held out the pup to him, and Peter whimpered as Jolly Roger   took his wiry little face between his hands, and then lifted him   gently. The girl was sobbing, with passionate little catches in  her  breath, but there were no tears in her eyes as they turned for  an  instant from Peter to the gun on the table. 
  &quot;If I'd had that,&quot; she cried, &quot;I'd hev killed him!&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's face was coldly gray as he knelt down on the floor   and bent over Peter. 
  &quot;He&#8212;pulled your hair, you say?&quot; 
  &quot;I&#8212;forgot,&quot; she whispered, close at his shoulder. &quot;I wasn't goin'   to tell you that. But it didn't hurt. It was Peter&#8212;&quot; 
  He felt the damp caress of her curls upon his neck as she bent   over him. 
  &quot;Please tell me, Mister Jolly Roger&#8212;is he hurt&#8212;bad?&quot; 
  With the tenderness of a woman Jolly Roger worked his fingers over   Peter's scrawny little body. And Peter, whimpering softly, felt  the  infinite consolation of their touch. He was no longer afraid  of Jed  Hawkins, or of pain, or of death. The soul of a dog is  simple in its  measurement of blessings, and to Peter it was a  great happiness to lie  here, broken and in pain, with the face of  his beloved mistress over  him and Jolly Roger's hands working to  mend his hurt. He whimpered  when Jolly Roger found the broken  place, and he cried out like a  little child when there came the  sudden quick snapping of a bone&#8212;but  even then he turned his head  so that he could thrust out his hot  tongue against the back of his  man-friend's hand. And Jolly Roger, as  he worked, was giving  instructions to the girl, who was quick as a  bird to bring him  cloth which she tore into bandages, so that at the  end of ten  minutes Peter's right hind leg was trussed up so tightly  that it  was as stiff and as useless as a piece of wood. 
  &quot;His hip was dislocated and his leg-bone broken,&quot; said Jolly Roger   when he had finished. &quot;He is all right now, and inside of three  weeks  will be on his feet again.&quot; 
  He lifted Peter gently, and made him a nest among the blankets in   his bunk. And then, still with that strange, gray look in his  face,  he turned to Nada. 
  She was standing partly facing the door, her eyes straight on him.   And Jolly Roger saw in them that wonderful something which had  given  his storm-beaten soul a glimpse of paradise earlier that  day. They  were blue, so blue that he had never seen violets like  them&#8212;and he  knew that in her heart there was no guile behind  which she could hide  the secret they were betraying. A yearning  such as had never before  come into his life urged him to open his  arms to her, and he knew that  she would have come into them; but a  still mightier will held them  tense and throbbing at his side. Her  cheeks were aflame as she looked  at him, and he told himself that  God could not have made a lovelier  thing, as she stood there in  her worn dress and her ragged shoes, with  that light of glory in  her face, and her damp hair waving and curling  about her in the  last light of the day. 
  &quot;I knew you'd fix him, Mister-Roger,&quot; she whispered, a great pride   and faith and worship in the low thrill of her voice. &quot;I knew it!&quot; 
  Something choked Jolly Roger, and he turned to the stove and began   spearing the crisp brown potatoes on the end of a fork. And he  said,  with his back toward her, 
  &quot;You came just in time for supper, Nada. We'll eat&#8212;and then I'll   go home with you, as far as the Ridge.&quot; 
  Peter watched them. His pain was gone, and it was nice and   comfortable in Jolly Roger's blanket, and with his whiskered face  on  his fore-paws his bright eyes followed every movement of these  two who  so completely made up his world. He heard that sweet  little laugh  which came only now and then from Nada's lips, when  for a moment she  was happy; he saw her shake out her hair in the  glow of the lamp which  Jolly Roger lighted, and he observed Jolly  Roger standing at the  stove&#8212;looking at her as she did it&#8212;a  worship in his face which  changed the instant her eyes turned  toward him. In Peter's active  little brain this gave birth to  nothing of definite understanding,  except that in it all he sensed  happiness, for&#8212;somehow&#8212;there was  always that feeling when they  were with Jolly Roger, no matter whether  the sun was shining or  the day was dark and filled with gloom. Many  times in his short  life he had seen grief and tears in Nada's face,  and had seen her  cringe and hide herself at the vile cursing and  witch-like voice  of the man and woman back in the other cabin. But  there was  nothing like that in Jolly Roger's company. He had two eyes,  and  he was not always cursing, and he did not pull Nada's hair&#8212;and   Peter loved him from the bottom of his soul. And he knew that his   mistress loved him, for she had told him so, and there was always  a  different look in her eyes when she was with Jolly Roger, and it  was  only then that she laughed in that glad little way&#8212;as she was   laughing now. 
  Jolly Roger was seated at the table, and Nada stood behind him,   her face flushed joyously at the wonderful privilege of pouring  his  coffee. And then she sat down, and Jolly Roger gave her the  nicest of  the partridge breasts, and tried hard to keep his eyes  calm and quiet  as he looked at the adorable sweetness of her  across the table from  him. To Nada there was nothing of shame in  what lay behind the  happiness in the violet radiance of her eyes.  Jolly Roger had brought  to her the only happiness that had ever  come into her life. Next to  her God, which Jed Hawkins and his  witch-woman had not destroyed  within her, she thought of this  stranger who for three months had been  hiding in Indian Tom's  cabin. And, like Peter, she loved him. The  innocence of it lay  naked in her eyes. 
  &quot;Nada,&quot; said Jolly Roger. &quot;You're seventeen&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Goin' on eighteen,&quot; she corrected quickly. &quot;I was seventeen two   weeks ago!&quot; 
  The quick, undefined little note of eagerness in her voice made   his heart thump. He nodded, and smiled. 
  &quot;Yes, going on eighteen,&quot; he said. &quot;And pretty soon some young   fellow will come along, and see you, and marry you&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;O-o-o-h-h-h!&quot; 
  It was a little, strange cry that came to her lips, and Jolly   Roger saw a quick throbbing in her bare throat. and her eyes were  so  wide-open and startled as she looked at him that he felt, for a   moment, as if the resolution in his soul was giving way. 
  &quot;Where are you goin', Mister Roger?&quot; 
  &quot;Me? Oh, I'm not going anywhere&#8212;not for a time, at least. But   you&#8212;you'll surely be going away with some one&#8212;some day.&quot; 
  &quot;I won't,&quot; she denied hotly. &quot;I hate men! I hate all but you,   Mister Jolly Roger. And if you go away&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, if I go away&#8212; 
  &quot;I'll kill Jed Hawkins!&quot; 
  Involuntarily she reached out a slim hand to the big gun on the   corner of the table. 
  &quot;I'll kill 'im, if you go away,&quot; she threatened again, &quot;He's   broken his wife, and crippled her, and if it wasn't for her I'd  have  gone long ago. But I've promised, and I'm goin' to stay&#8212;  until  something happens. And if you go&#8212;now&#8212;&quot; 
  At the choking throb in her throat and the sudden quiver that came   to her lips, Jolly Roger jumped up for the coffee pot, though his  cup  was still half full. 
  &quot;I won't go, Nada,&quot; he cried, trying to laugh. &quot;I promise&#8212;cross   my heart and hope to die! I won't go&#8212;until you tell me I can.&quot; 
  And then, feeling that something had almost gone wrong for a   moment, Peter yipped from his nest in the bunk, and the gladness  in  Nada's eyes thanked Jolly Roger for his promise when he came  back with  the coffee pot. Standing behind her, he made pretense of  refilling her  cup, though she had scarcely touched it, and all the  time his eyes  were looking at her beautiful head, and he saw again  the dampness in  her hair. 
  &quot;What happened in the creek, Nada?&quot; he asked. 
  She told him, and at the mention of his name Peter drew his   bristling little head erect, and waited expectantly. He could see   Jolly Roger's face, now staring and a bit shocked, and then with a   quick smile flashing over it; and when Nada had finished, Jolly  Roger  leaned a little toward her in the lampglow, and said, 
  &quot;You've got to promise me something, Nada. If Jed Hawkins ever   hits you again, or pulls your hair, or even threatens to do it&#8212;  will  you tell me?&quot; Nada hesitated. 
  &quot;If you don't&#8212;I'll take back my promise, and won't stay,&quot; he   added. 
  &quot;Then&#8212;I'll promise,&quot; she said. &quot;If he does it, I'll tell you. But   I ain't&#8212;I mean I am not afraid, except for Peter. Jed Hawkins  will  sure kill him if I take him back, Mister Roger. Will you keep  him  here? And&#8212;o-o-o-h!&#8212;if I could only stay, too&#8212;&quot; 
  The words came from her in a frightened breath, and in an instant   a flood of color rushed like fire into her cheeks. But Jolly Roger   turned again to the stove, and made as if he had not seen the  blush  or heard her last words, so that the shame of her  embarrassment was  gone as quickly as it had come. 
  &quot;Yes, I'll keep Peter,&quot; he said over his shoulder. And in his   heart another voice which she could not hear, was crying, &quot;And I'd   give my life if I could keep you!&quot; 
  Devouring his bits of partridge breast, Peter watched Jolly Roger   and Nada out of the corner of his eye as they left the cabin half  an  hour later. It was dark when they went, and Jolly Roger closed  only  the mosquito-screen, leaving the door wide open, and Peter  could hear  their footsteps disappearing slowly into the deep gloom  of the forest.  It was a little before moonrise, and under the  spruce and cedar and  thick balsam the world was like a black pit.  It was very still, and  except for the soft tread of their own feet  and the musical ripple of  water in the creek there was scarcely a  sound in this first hour of  the night. In Jolly Roger there rose  something of exultation, for  Nada's warm little hand lay in his as  he guided her through the  darkness, and her fingers had clasped  themselves tightly round his  thumb. She was very close to him when  he paused to make sure of the  unseen trail, so close that her  cheek rested against his arm,  and&#8212;bending a little&#8212;his lips  touched the soft ripples of her hair.  But he could not see her in  the gloom, and his heart pounded fiercely  all the way to the ford. 
  Then he laughed a strange little laugh that was not at all like   Jolly Roger. 
  &quot;I'll try and not let you get wet again, Nada,&quot; he said. 
  Her fingers still held to his thumb, as if she was afraid of   losing him there in the blackness that lay about them like a great   ink-blotch. And she crept closer to him, saying nothing, and all  the  power in his soul fought in Jolly Roger to keep him from  putting his  arms about her slim little body and crying out the  worship that was in  him. 
  &quot;I ain't&#8212;I mean I'm not afraid of gettin' wet,&quot; he heard her   whisper then. &quot;You're so big and strong, Mister Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  Gently he freed his thumb from her fingers, and picked her up, and   held her high, so that she was against his breast and above the   deepest of the water. Lightly at first Nada's arms lay about his   shoulders, but as the flood began to rush higher and she felt him   straining against it,&#8212;her arms tightened, until the clasp of them   was warm and thrilling round Jolly Roger's neck. She gave a big  gasp  of relief when he stood her safely down upon her feet on the  other  side. And then again she reached out, and found his hand,  and twined  her fingers about his big thumb&#8212;and Jolly Roger went  on with her over  the plain toward Cragg's Ridge, dripping wet,  just as the rim of the  moon began to rise over the edge of the  eastern forests.
