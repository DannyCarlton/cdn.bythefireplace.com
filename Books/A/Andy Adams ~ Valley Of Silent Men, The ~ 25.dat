  How long it was before his brain cleared, Kent never could have   told. It might have been a minute or an hour. Every vital force  that  was in him had concentrated into a single consciousness&#8212;that  the dead  had come to life, that it was Marette Radisson, the flesh  and blood  and living warmth of her, he held in his arms. Like the  flash of a  picture on a screen he had seen McTrigger's face close  to him, and  then his own head was crushed down again, and if the  valley had been  filled with the roar of cannon, he would have  heard only one sound, a  sobbing voice crying over and over again,  &quot;Jeems&#8212;Jeems&#8212;Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  It was McTrigger, in the beginning of the starlight, who alone   looked with clear vision upon the wonder of the thing that was   happening. After a little Kent realized that McTrigger was  talking,  that a hand was on his shoulder, that the voice was both  joyous and  insistent. He rose to his feet, still holding Marette,  her arms  clinging to him. Her breath was sobbing and broken. And  it was  impossible for Kent to speak. He seemed to stumble over the  distance  between them and the lights, with McTrigger on the other  side of  Marette. It was McTrigger who opened a door, and they came  into a glow  of lamplight. It was a great, strange-looking room  they entered. And  over the threshold Marette's hands dropped from  Kent, and Kent stepped  back, so that in the light they faced each  other, and in that moment  came the marvelous readjustment from  shock and disbelief to a glorious  certainty. 
  Again Kent's brain was as clear as the day he faced death at the   head of the Chute. And swift as a hot barb a fear leaped into him  as  his eyes met the eyes of the girl. She was terribly changed.  Her face  was white with a whiteness that startled him. It was  thin. Her eyes  were great, slumbering pools of violet, almost  black in the lamp glow,  and her hair&#8212;piled high on her head as he  had seen it that first day  at Cardigan's&#8212;added to the telltale  pallor in her cheeks. A hand  trembled at her throat, and its  thinness frightened him. For a  space&#8212;a flash of seconds&#8212;she  looked at him as if possessed of the  subconscious fear that he was  not Jim Kent, and then slowly her arms  opened, and she reached  them out to him. She did not smile, she did  not cry out, she did  not speak his name now; but her arms went round  his neck as he  took her to him, and her face dropped on his breast. He  looked at  McTrigger. A woman was standing beside him, a dark-haired,  dark-  eyed woman, and she had laid a hand on McTrigger's arm, Kent,   looking at them, understood. 
  The woman came to him. &quot;I had better take her now, m'sieu,&quot; she   said. &quot;Malcolm&#8212;will tell you. And a little later,&#8212;you may see  her  again.&quot; 
  Her voice was low and soft. At the sound of it Marette raised her   head, and her two hands stole to Kent's cheeks in their old sweet   way, and she whispered, 
  &quot;Kiss me, Jeems&#8212;my Jeems&#8212;kiss me&#8212;&quot;
