  Ben Buffum was biding his time. 
  In the seat in front of Ben sat Albert Frost, a much smaller boy. 
  One day, toward the close of the afternoon, a loud shriek was heard  in  the neighborhood of Ben Buffum's desk. 
  Walter looked up and saw Albert in tears. 
  &quot;What is the matter, Albert?&quot; asked Walter. 
  &quot;Ben Buffum stuck a pin in my leg,&quot; answered the boy. &quot;Is that  true,  Buffum?&quot; demanded Walter sternly. 
  &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; answered Ben, with provoking calmness. 
  Walter's temper was stirred, but he asked in his ordinary tones:  &quot;Why  did you do it?&quot; 
  &quot;Because I chose,&quot; answered Ben. 
  &quot;Then,&quot; said Walter, giving full vent to his scorn, &quot;you are a   contemptible coward and brute! 
  &quot;You forget that in this schoolroom I am the master, and consider  it  my duty to defend my pupils, even the smallest, from the violence  of  brutes.&quot; 
  &quot;He'll have to pay for this,&quot; he muttered to himself. &quot;I can lick  you,  Walter!&quot; he said, with an insolent leer. 
  He had hardly got the words out of his mouth when Walter was upon  him.  He was wonderfully quick in his movements, whereas Ben, though   powerful, was slow, and before he well knew what was going to happen   he was dragged by the collar from his seat into the middle of the   floor. Walter let go for a minute, and Ben, mad all over, prepared to   grasp him in a bearlike hug. A stinging blow in the face convinced him   that he had entirely underrated the powers of the teacher. He tried to   return the blow, but, unable to defend himself, found his own blow   parried and another planted in his chest, causing him to stagger. Then   Ben lost all caution, and with a furious cry rushed upon Walter, in   hope of throwing him down by wrestling. But, instead, he found himself   lying on his back on the floor, looking up at the teacher. 
  Ben got up slowly and &quot;pitched in&quot; once more, but in about a minute  he  found himself again in a recumbent position. 
  &quot;Have you had enough?&quot; asked Walter. 
  &quot;I hit my head,&quot; answered Ben, in a sulky tone. 
  &quot;I hope you are not seriously hurt,&quot; said Walter, quietly. &quot;If you   would like to be dismissed now, you may go. I shall be glad to see you   back here to-morrow.&quot; 
  Without a word, but looking intensely mortified, Ben took his hat  and  slunk out of the room. 
  When he had gone Walter said: &quot;Scholars, I want to ask of you a  favor.  Ben is mortified by what has happened. I wish you would all  abstain  from reminding him of it. In that case the lesson he has  received may  do him good.&quot; 
  The next day Ben Buffum stayed at home, and did not show himself on   the street till evening. When he found that no one spoke to him of the   affair he took courage to go to school the day after. Walter overtook   him on the way and hailed him in a friendly manner with: &quot;We will   forget all about that little affair day before yesterday, Ben. You are   pretty strong.&quot; 
  &quot;I couldn't do nothin' against you.&quot; 
  &quot;No, because I have taken lessons in boxing.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd like to box.&quot; 
  &quot;If you'll come round and see me this evening, Ben, I'll give you  the  first lesson.&quot; 
  The scholars were very much surprised to see Ben and the teacher   walking to school together, and were further surprised at the   wonderful change for the better that took place in the once rebellious   pupil.
