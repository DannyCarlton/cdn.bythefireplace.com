  While the events recorded in the last chapter were taking place in  Mr.  Godfrey's counting-room another and a different scene took place  at the  office of Mr. Stanton. 
  He had just finished reading the morning paper, and, as it slipped  from  his hand, his thoughts turned, transiently, to the nephew whose   persistent failure to claim relationship puzzled him not a little. He   was glad not to be called upon for money, of course; still, he felt a   little annoyed at Herbert's reticence, especially as it left him  unable  to decide whether our hero knew of the tie which connected  them. It was  scarcely possible to suppose that he did not. But in that  case, why did  he not make some sign? The truth did suggest itself to  Mr. Stanton's  mind that the boy resented his cold and indifferent  letter, and this  thought made him feel a little uncomfortable. 
  While he was thinking over this subject, one of his clerks entered  the  office. 
  &quot;A gentleman to see you, Mr. Stanton,&quot; he said, briefly. 
  Mr. Stanton raised his head, and his glance rested on a tall,  vigorous  man of perhaps thirty-five years of age, who closely followed  the clerk.  The stranger's face was brown from exposure, and there was  a certain  appearance of unconventionality about his movements which  seemed to  indicate that he was not a dweller in cities or a frequenter  of drawing-  rooms, but accustomed to make his home in the wilder  haunts of nature. 
  In brief, for there is no occasion for mystery, Mr. Stanton's  visitor  was Ralph the Ranger, who had assisted Herbert from the  clutches of  Abner Holden. 
  Mr. Stanton gazed at the stranger with some curiosity, but was  unable to  recognize him. 
  &quot;Have you any business with me?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the visitor, in a voice whose depth carried with it an   assurance of strength. 
  &quot;State it, then, as briefly as possible,&quot; said the merchant, with a   little asperity, for there was not as much deference in the manner of   the other as he thought there should have been. Like most new men, he   was jealous of his position, and solicitous lest he should not be   treated with due respect. 
  &quot;I will do so,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;but as it cannot be summed up  in a  sentence, I will take the liberty of seating myself.&quot; 
  As he spoke he sat down in an office chair, which was placed not  far  from that in which Mr. Stanton was sitting. 
  &quot;My time is valuable,&quot; said the merchant, coldly. &quot;I cannot listen  to a  long story.&quot; 
  As the visitor was plainly, if not roughly, dressed, he suspected  that  he desired pecuniary assistance on some pretext or other, and  that his  story was one of misfortune, intended to appeal to his  sympathies. Had  such been the case, there was very little prospect of  help from Mr.  Stanton, and that gentleman already enjoyed in  anticipation the pleasure  of refusing him. 
  &quot;Don't you know me?&quot; demanded Ralph, abruptly. 
  Mr. Stanton did not anticipate such a commencement. It had never   occurred to him to suppose that his rough visitor was one whom he had   ever before met. 
  &quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;I never saw you before.&quot; 
  Ralph smiled a little bitterly. 
  &quot;So I have passed entirely out of your remembrance, have I?&quot; he  said.  &quot;Well, it is twelve years since we met.&quot; 
  &quot;Twelve years,&quot; repeated Mr. Stanton. He scanned the stranger's  face  with curiosity, but not a glimmer of recollection came to him. 
  &quot;I dare say I met many persons at that distance of time, whom I  cannot  remember in the least now, even by name.&quot; 
  &quot;I think you will remember my name,&quot; said Ralph, quietly. &quot;Your  memory  of Ralph Pendleton cannot be wholly obliterated.&quot; 
  Mr. Stanton started, and it was evident from the expression of his  face  that the memory was not a welcome one. 
  &quot;Are you Ralph Pendleton?&quot; he asked, in an undecided voice. 
  &quot;Yes, but not the Ralph Pendleton you once knew. Then I was an   inexperienced boy; now I am a man.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, you have changed considerably,&quot; said Mr. Stanton,  uncomfortably,  &quot;Where have you kept yourself all these years? Why have  you not made  yourself known before?&quot; 
  &quot;Before I answer these questions, I must refer to some  circumstances  well known to both of us. I hope I shall not be  tiresome; I will, at  least, be brief. You were my father's friend. At  least, he so considered  you.&quot; 
  &quot;I was so.&quot; 
  &quot;When he died, as I had not yet attained my majority, he left you  my  guardian.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;I was in rather an idle frame, and being possessed, as I supposed,  of  fifty thousand dollars, I felt no necessity impelling me to work.  You  gave me no advice, but rather encouraged me in my idle  propensities.  When I was of age, I took a fancy to travel, and left my  property in  your hands, with full power to manage it for me. This  trust you  accepted.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, this is an old story.&quot; 
  &quot;An old one, but it shall not be a long one. My income being  sufficient  to defray my expenses abroad, I traveled leisurely, with no  thought for  the future. In your integrity I had the utmost confidence.  Imagine,  then, my dismay when, while resident in Paris, I received a  letter from  you stating that, owing to a series of unlucky  investments, nearly all  my money had been sunk, and in place of fifty  thousand dollars, my  property was reduced to a few hundreds.' 
  &quot;It was unlucky, I admit,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, moving uneasily in his   chair. &quot;My investments were unlucky, as it turned out, but the best  and  most judicious cannot always foresee how an investment will turn  out.  Besides, I lost largely, myself.&quot; 
  &quot;So you wrote me,&quot; said Ralph, quietly. &quot;However, that did not make  it  any the easier for me to bear.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps not, but it shows, at any rate, that I took the same risk  for  my own money that I did for others.&quot; 
  Ralph proceeded without noticing this remark. &quot;What made matters  worse  for me was that I had fallen in love with a young American lady  who,  with her parents, was then traveling in Europe. My circumstances,  as I  supposed them to be, justified me in proposing marriage. I was  accepted  by the young lady, and my choice was approved by the parents.  When,  however, I learned of my loss of fortune, I at once made it  known, and  that approval was withdrawn. The father told me that, under  the altered  circumstances, the engagement must be considered broken.  Still, he held  out the prospect that, should I ever again obtain a  property as large as  that I had lost, I might marry his daughter. She,  on her part, promised  to wait for me.&quot; 
  &quot;Well?&quot; 
  &quot;I came to New York, received from you the remnant of my lost  fortune,  and sailed the next week for California, then just open to  American  enterprise. The most glowing stories were told of fortunes  won in an  incredibly short time, Having no regular occupation, and  having a strong  motive for acquiring money, it is not surprising that  I should have been  dazzled with the rest, and persuaded to make the  journey to the land of  gold.&quot; 
  &quot;A Quixotic scheme, as I thought at the time,&quot; said Mr. Stanton,  coldly.  &quot;For one that succeeded, there were fifty who failed. You had  better  have taken the clerkship I offered you.&quot; 
  &quot;You are wrong,&quot; said Ralph, composedly. &quot;There were many who were   disappointed, but I was not among the number.&quot; 
  &quot;Did you succeed?&quot; asked Mr. Stanton, surprised. 
  &quot;So well,&quot; answered the other, &quot;that at the end of two years'  residence,  I found myself as rich as I had ever been.&quot; 
  &quot;Had you made fifty thousand dollars?&quot; demanded the merchant, in   amazement. 
  &quot;I had.&quot; 
  &quot;What did you do? Why did you not let me know of your success?&quot; 
  &quot;When I once more found myself possessed of a fortune, I took the  next  vessel home with my money. I had but one thought, and that was to  claim  the hand of my promised bride, who had promised to wait for me  ten  years, if necessary.&quot; 
  &quot;Well?&quot; 
  &quot;I found her married,&quot; said Ralph, bitterly. &quot;She had forgotten her   promise, or had been over-persuaded by her parents&#8212;I do not know  which  &#8212;and had proved false to me.&quot; 
  &quot;That was unfortunate. But do you still possess the money?&quot; 
  &quot;I do.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed! I congratulate you,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, with suavity, and  he  held out his hand, which Ralph did not appear to see. Ralph  Pendleton  rich was a very different person from Ralph Pendleton poor,  and it  occurred to him that he might so far ingratiate himself into  the favor  of his former ward as to obtain the charge of his second  fortune. He saw  that it would be safe, as well as politic, to exchange  his coldness for  a warm and cordial welcome. 
  &quot;Proceed with your story,&quot; he said; &quot;I am quite interested in it.&quot;
