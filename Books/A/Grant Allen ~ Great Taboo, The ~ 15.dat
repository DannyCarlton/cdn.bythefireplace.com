Naturally enough, it was some time before Felix and Muriel could recover  from the shock of their deadly peril. Yet, strange to say, the natives at  the end of three days seemed positively to have forgotten all about it.  Their loves and their hates were as shortlived as children's. As soon as  the period of seclusion was over, their attentions to the two strangers  redoubled in intensity. They were evidently most anxious, after this  brief disagreement, to reassure the new gods, who came from the sun, of  their gratitude and devotion. The men who had wounded Felix, in  particular, now came daily in the morning with exceptional gifts of fish,  fruit, and flowers; they would bring a crab from the sea, or a joint of  turtle-meat. "Forgive us, O king," they cried, prostrating themselves  humbly. "We did not mean to hurt you; we thought your time had really  come. You are a Korong. We would not offend you. Do not refuse us your  showers because of our sin. We are very penitent. We will do what you ask  of us. Your look is poison. See, here is wood; here are leaves and fire;  we are but your meat; choose and cook which you will of us!"    
It was useless Felix's trying to explain to them that he wanted no  victims, and no propitiation. The more he protested, the more they  brought gifts. "He is a very great god," they exclaimed. "He wants  nothing from us. What can we give him that will be an acceptable gift?  Shall we offer him ourselves, our wives, our children?"    
As for the women, when they saw how thoroughly frightened of them Muriel  now was, they couldn't find means to express their regret and devotion.  Mothers brought their little children, whom she had patted on the head,  and offered them, just outside the line, as presents for her acceptance.  They explained to her Shadow that they never meant to hurt her, and that,  if only she would venture without the line, as of old, all should be  well, and they would love and adore her. Mali translated to her mistress  these speeches and prayers. "Them say, 'You come back, Queenie,'" she  explained in her broken Queensland English. "'Boupari women love you very  much. Boupari women glad you come. You kind; you beautiful! All Boupari  men and women very much pleased with you and the gentleman, because you  give back him cocoanut and fruit that you pick in the storm, and because  you bring down fresh fire from heaven.'"    
Gradually, after several days, Felix's confidence was so far restored  that he ventured to stroll beyond the line again; and he found himself,  indeed, most popular among the people. In various ways he picked up  gradually the idea that the islanders generally disliked Tu-Kila-Kila,  and liked himself; and that they somehow regarded him as Tu-Kila-Kila's  natural enemy. What it could all mean he did not yet understand, though  some inklings of an explanation occasionally occurred to him. Oh, how he  longed now for the Month of Birds to end, in order that he might pay his  long-deferred visit to the mysterious Frenchman, from whose voice his  Shadow had fled on that fateful evening with such sudden precipitancy.  The Frenchman, he judged, must have been long on the island, and could  probably give him some satisfactory solution of this abstruse problem.    
So he was glad, indeed, when one evening, some weeks later, his Shadow,  observing the sky narrowly, remarked to him in a low voice, "New moon  to-morrow! The Month of Birds will then be up. In the morning you can go  and see your brother god at the Abode of Birds without breaking taboo.  The Month of Turtles begins at sunrise. My family god is a turtle, so I  know the day for it."    
So great was Felix's impatience to settle this question, that almost  before the sun was up next day he had set forth from his hut, accompanied  as usual by his faithful Shadow. Their way lay past Tu-Kila-Kila's  temple. As they went by the entrance with the bamboo posts, Felix  happened to glance aside through the gate to the sacred enclosure. Early  as it was, Tu-Kila-Kila was afoot already; and, to Felix's great  surprise, was pacing up and down, with that stealthy, wary look upon his  cunning face that Muriel had so particularly noted on the day of their  first arrival. His spear stood in his hand, and his tomahawk hung by his  left side; he peered about him suspiciously, with a cautious glance, as  he walked round and round the sacred tree he guarded so continually.  There was something weird and awful in the sight of that savage god, thus  condemned by his own superstition and the custom of his people to tramp  ceaselessly up and down before the sacred banyan.    
At sight of Felix, however, a sudden burst of frenzy seemed to possess at  once all Tu-Kila-Kila's limbs. He brandished his spear violently, and set  himself spasmodically in a posture of defence. His brow grew black, and  his eyes darted out eternal hate and suspicion. It was evident he  expected an instant attack, and was prepared with all his might and main  to resist aggression. Yet he never offered to desert his post by the tree  or to assume the offensive. Clearly, he was guarding the sacred grove  itself with jealous care, and was as eager for its safety as for his own  life and honor.    
Felix passed on, wondering what it all could mean, and turned with an  inquiring glance to his trembling Shadow. As for Toko, he had held his  face averted meanwhile, lest he should behold the great god, and be  scorched to a cinder; but in answer to Felix's mute inquiry he murmured  low: "Was Tu-Kila-Kila there? Were all things right? Was he on guard at  his post by the tree already?"    
"Yes," Felix replied, with that weird sense of mystery creeping over him  now more profoundly than ever. "He was on guard by the tree and he looked  at me angrily."    
"Ah," the Shadow remarked, with a sigh of regret, "he keeps watch well.  It will be hard work to assail him. No god in Boupari ever held his place  so tight. Who wishes to take Tu-Kila-Kila's divinity must get up early."    
They went on in silence to the little volcanic knoll near the centre of  the island. There, in the neat garden plot they had observed before, a  man, in the last relics of a very tattered European costume, much covered  with a short cape of native cloth, was tending his flowers and singing to  himself merrily. His back was turned to them as they came up. Felix  paused a moment, unseen, and caught the words the stranger was singing:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"Tres jolie, <br> Peu polie, <br> Possedant un gros magot; <br> Fort en gueule, <br> Pas begueule; <br> Telle etait--"</small></i></blockquote><br>
The stranger looked up, and paused in the midst of his lines,  open-mouthed. For a moment he stood and stared astonished. Then, raising  his native cap with a graceful air, and bowing low, as he would have  bowed to a lady on the Boulevard, he advanced to greet a brother European  with the familiar words, in good educated French, "Monsieur, I salute  you!"    
To Felix, the sound of a civilized voice in the midst of so much strange  and primitive barbarism, was like a sudden return to some forgotten  world, so deeply and profoundly did it move and impress him. He grasped  the sunburnt Frenchman's rugged hand in his. "Who are you?" he cried, in  the very best Parisian he could muster up on the spur of the moment. "And  how did you come here?"    
"Monsieur," the Frenchman answered, no less profoundly moved than  himself, "this is, indeed, wonderful! Do I hear once more that beautiful  language spoken? Do I find myself once more in the presence of a  civilized person? What fortune! What happiness! Ah, it is glorious,  glorious."    
For some seconds they stood and looked at one another in silence,  grasping their hands hard again and again with intense emotion; then  Felix repeated his question a second time: "Who are you, monsieur? and  where do you come from?"    
"Your name, surname, age, occupation?" the Frenchman repeated, bursting  forth at last into national levity. "Ah, monsieur, what a joy to hear  those well-known inquiries in my ear once more. I hasten to gratify  your legitimate curiosity. Name: Peyron; Christian name: Jules; age:  forty-one; occupation: convict, escaped from New Caledonia."    
Under any other circumstances that last qualification might possibly have  been held an undesirable one in a new acquaintance. But on the island of  Boupari, among so many heathen cannibals, prejudices pale before  community of blood; even a New Caledonian convict is at least a Christian  European. Felix received the strange announcement without the faintest  shock of surprise or disgust. He would gladly have shaken hands then and  there with M. Jules Peyron, indeed, had he introduced himself in even  less equivocal language as a forger, a pickpocket, or an escaped  house-breaker.    
"And you, monsieur?" the ex-convict inquired, politely.    
Felix told him in a few words the history of their accident and their  arrival on the island.    
"<i>Comment</i>?" the Frenchman exclaimed, with surprise and delight. "A lady  as well; a charming English lady! What an acquisition to the society of  Boupari! <i>Quelle chance! Quel bonheur!</i> Monsieur, you are welcome, and  mademoiselle too! And in what quality do you live here? You are a god, I  see; otherwise you would not have dared to transgress my taboo, nor would  this young man--your Shadow, I suppose--have permitted you to do so. But  which sort of god, pray? Korong--or Tula?"    
"They call me Korong," Felix answered, all tremulous, feeling himself now  on the very verge of solving this profound mystery.    
"And mademoiselle as well?" the Frenchman exclaimed, in a tone of dismay.    
"And mademoiselle as well," Felix replied. "At least, so I make out. We  are both Korong. I have many times heard the natives call us so."    
His new acquaintance seized his hand with every appearance of genuine  alarm and regret. "My poor friend," he exclaimed, with a horrified face,  "this is terrible, terrible! Tu-Kila-Kila is a very hard man. What can  we do to save your life and mademoiselle's! We are powerless! Powerless!  I have only that much to say. I condole with you! I commiserate you!"    
"Why, what does Korong mean?" Felix asked, with blanched lips. "Is it  then something so very terrible?"    
"Terrible! Ah, terrible!" the Frenchman answered, holding up his hands in  horror and alarm. "I hardly know how we can avert your fate. Step within  my poor hut, or under the shade of my Tree of Liberty here, and I will  tell you all the little I know about it."
