The city below--the new solid city--was obliterated under a heavy fog,  pierced here and there by steeples and towers that looked like jagged dark  rocks in that white and tranquil sea.    
On Angel Island and on the north shore of the bay the deep sad bells were  tolling their warning to moving craft; and from out at sea, beyond the  Golden Gate, the fog horn sent forth its long lugubrious groans. The bells  sounded muffled, so dense was the fog, and there was no other sound in the  sleeping city.    
Alexina wrapped her long cloak more closely about her and pulled the hood  over her head.    
As she walked slowly down the steep avenue it came to her with something of  a shock that she had not thought of her husband since she had expressed to  Gora her reluctance to disturb him.    
She was doing the least conventional thing possible in leaving the house at  four o'clock in the morning to seek the sympathy of a girl friend when any  other young wife she knew (unless getting a divorce) would have flown to  her husband and wept out her sorrow in his arms.    
And she had been married only three years, and found Mortimer quite as  irreproachable as ever, always kind, thoughtful, and considerate. He  assuredly would have said just the right things to her and not have  resented in the least being deprived of a few hours of rest.    
On the contrary, he would no doubt resent being ignored, for not only was  he devoted to his lovely young wife but such behavior was unorthodox, and  he disliked the unorthodox exceedingly.    
Well, she didn't want him and that was the end of it. He didn't fill the  present bill. She had never regretted her marriage, for he had quite  measured up to the best feats of her maiden imagination. He made love  charmingly, he was manly chivalrous and honorable, and his eager  spontaneity of manner when he arrived home at six o'clock every evening  never varied; to whatever level of flatness he might drop immediately  afterward. When they entered a ballroom or a restaurant she knew that they  made a "stunning couple" and that people commented upon their good looks,  their harmonious slenderness and inches, and contrasts in nature's  coloring.    
<b>II</b>    
Alexina, almost unconsciously, sat down on a bench under the trees. Her  mind sought the pleasant past as a brief respite from the present; she knew  that that part of her mind called heart was frozen by the suddenness of her  mother's death, and that her emotions would be fluid a few hours hence.    
They had had a simply heavenly time together until her mother's illness.  As a clerk in the family was unthinkable Mrs. Groome had lent him the  insurance on one of her burned buildings and he had started a modest  exporting and importing house, that being the only business of which he had  any knowledge. Judge Lawton and Tom Abbott had suggested that he open an  insurance office, or start himself in any business where little capital  besides office furniture was needed; as Mrs. Groome's advisors they were  averse to launching any of her moderate fortune on a doubtful venture. But  Dwight had insisted that he was more likely to succeed in a business he  understood than in one of which he knew nothing, and Mrs. Groome had agreed  with him. Judge Lawton and Abbott paid over the insurance money with the  worst grace possible.    
And then Mortimer had a piece of the most astounding good luck. His aunt  Eliza Goring had left stock in a mine which had run out of pay ore soon  after her investment, and shut down. It had recently been recapitalized  and a new vein discovered. Mrs. Goring's executor had sold her stock for  something under twenty thousand dollars, delivering the proceeds, as  directed in her will, to two of her amazed heirs, Mortimer and Gora Dwight.    
Gora had been opposed to her brother leaving the firm of Cheever Harrison  and Cheever, where, beyond question, he would be head of a department in  time and safely anchored for life; but he had taken the step, and she  reasoned that he must have a considerable knowledge of a business with  which he had been associated for fourteen years, she knew his energy and  powers of application, and she resented the attitude of "the family."  Appreciating what his triumph would mean to him she had consented to  invest her inheritance in his business and enable him to make immediate  restitution to Mrs. Groome. As a matter of fact his "stock did go up"  with the family, particularly as he seemed to be doing well and had the  reputation of working harder than any young man on the street. As he had  anticipated, a good deal of business was thrown his way.    
He had accepted as a matter of course Mrs. Groome's invitation to live with  her, paying, as he insisted upon it, a stipulated sum toward the current  expenses. He thought her offer quite natural; not only would she be lonely  without the child of her old age, but she must desire that Alexina continue  to live in the conditions to which she was accustomed; the sum Mrs. Groome  consented to accept would not have kept them in a fashionable family hotel,  much less an apartment with several servants.    
Moreover, housing room was scarce; they might have been obliged to live  across the Bay; and, in his opinion, the duty of parents to their offspring  never ceased.    
Alexina at that time thought every sentiment he expressed "simply great,"  and had continued to feed from her mother's hand even in the matter of pin  money. Mortimer felt it to be right, so he told her, to put his surplus  profits back in his business; all he could spare he needed for "front," to  say nothing of pleasant little dinners at restaurants to their hospitable  young friends; who thought it no adequate return to be asked to dine on  Ballinger Hill.    
Moreover, he often gave her a far handsomer present than he should have  done, considering the "hard times;" or at least she would have preferred  that he give her the combined values in the form of a monthly allowance;  she would have enjoyed the sensation of being in a measure supported by her  husband.    
However, she and her mother assured each other that he was bound to make a  fortune in time, and then she would have an allowance as large as that of  Sibyl Thorndyke, who had married Frank Bascom.    
It had been like playing at marriage. Alexina put it into concrete  words. Subconsciously she had always known it. She had had no cares, no  responsibilities. She had merely continued to play, to keep her imagination  on that plane sometimes called the fool's paradise.    
<b>III</b>    
She realized abruptly that here was the secret of her longing for children.  They would have been the real thing, given a serious translation to life.    
But she had enjoyed the gay life of her little world, nevertheless, and  with all the abandon of a youth which had just closed its first long  chapter in that silent room on top of the hill. And no one could have asked  for a more delightful companion to play with than Morty, when his working  hours were over.    
Mortimer loved society. It had been simply delicious, poor darling, to  watch his secret delight, under his perfect repose, the first time they  spent a week-end in Mrs. Hunter's magnificent "villa" at Burlingame. Even  Aileen had treated his initiation as a matter of course; and they had spent  the afternoon at the club, where he drank whiskey and soda on equal terms  with many millionaires.    
<b>IV</b>    
It was doubtful if he enjoyed similarly his first visit to Rincona during  their engagement: after all the powwow was over and the family had grimly  surrendered to avoid the scandal of an elopement.    
Alexina recalled that dreadful day. They had all sat on the verandah on  the shady side of the house: her mother, Aunt Clara Groome, Maria, Susan  Belling and Grace Montgomery, Tom Abbott's sisters, whose homes were in  Alta, and Coralie Geary, born Brannan, of Fair Oaks (now Atherton) who had  married a nephew of Mrs. Groome. All these were as one united family. They  met every day, wandering in and out at all hours, and although they had  many healthy disagreements they agreed on all the fine old fundamentals,  and they stood by one another through thick and thin.    
The hair of all looked freshly washed. Their complexions had perished  asking no quarter. Mrs. Montgomery and Mrs. Geary were as slim and smart as  Mrs. Abbott, but the others were expanding rapidly, and Aunt Clara, who was  only a year older than Mrs. Groome, was shamelessly fat, and her face  was so weather-beaten that the freckled skin hung as loosely as her old  wrapper.    
All wore white, the simplest white, and all sewed quietly for the new  refugee babies; all except Alexina who talked feverishly to cover the awful  pauses, and young Joan, who had crawled under the table and stuffed an  infant's flannel petticoat into her mouth to muffle her giggles.    
Tom had escaped to the golf links. Mortimer sat in the midst of the  Irregular circle and smoked three cigars. He smiled when he spoke, which  was seldom, and appeared appreciative of the determined efforts to be  "nice" of these ladies who had called him Mortimer as soon as he arrived,  and who made him fed more like a poor relation whose feelings must be  spared, every moment.    
Finally Alexina, who was on the verge of hysteria, dragged Joan from under  the table, and the two carried him off to the tennis court.    
In subsequent visits, now covering a period of three years, their gracious  civil "kind" attitude had never varied, save only when their consciences  hurt them for disliking him more than usual, and then they were not only  heroic but fairly effusive in their efforts to be nice.    
Nevertheless, it was quite patent to Alexina that he enjoyed smoking his  after-dinner cigar on that old verandah whose sweet-scented vines had been  planted in the historic sixties; or under the ancient oaks of the park  where he dreamed aloud to her of sitting under similar oaks of England, the  guest of Lady Barnstable or Lady Arrowmount, belles of the eighties who  faithfully exchanged letters once a year with Maria Abbott and Coralie  Geary.    
From the family there was always the refuge of the tennis court and he  played an excellent game. He also seemed to enjoy those dinners given them  in certain other old Peninsula mansions, and if they were dull he was  duller.    
<b>V</b>    
Alexina had admitted to herself some time since (never to that wretch,  Aileen Lawton) that he <i>was</i> rather dull, poor darling.    
For a long time the aftermath of the earthquake and fire had supplied  topics for conversation. For quite two years there had been an acutely  painful interest in the Graft Prosecution, which, beginning with an attempt  merely to bring to justice the political boss, his henchman the mayor, and  his ignorant obedient board of supervisors, had unthinkably resolved itself  into a declaration of war, with State's Prison as its goal, upon some of  the most prominent capitalists in San Francisco.    
The prosecution had been started by a small group of eminent citizens, bent  upon cleaning up their city, notorious for graft, misgovernment, and the  basest abuses of political power. They had assumed as a matter of course  that those of their own class, who for years had expressed in private  their bitter resentment against paying out small fortunes to the board of  supervisors every time they wanted a franchise, would be only too glad to  expose the malefactors.    
But it immediately transpired that they had no intention whatever of  admitting to the world that they had been guilty of corruption and bribery.  They might have been "held up," forced to "come through," or renounce their  great enterprises; helpless, in other words; but the law had technical  terms for their part in the shameful transactions, and so had the public.    
All solemnly vowed that they had neither been approached by the city  administration for bribe money, nor paid a cent for franchises, some of  which the prosecution knew had cost them no less than two hundred thousand  dollars. Therefore did the prosecutors change their tactics. Supervisors,  by various means, were induced to confess, and the Grand Jury indicted not  only the boss and the mayor, but a large number of eminent citizens.    
Society was riven in twain. Life-long friends cut one another, and now and  again they burst into hysteria as they did it. Mrs. Ferdinand Thornton, at  a dinner party, left the room as Mrs. Hofer entered it, and Mrs. Hofer gave  a magnificent exhibition of Celtic temperament.    
The editor who supported the prosecution with the full strength of his  historic sheet was kidnapped. The prosecuting attorney was shot in the  court room by a former convict who afterward was found dead in his cell.  There were moments when it looked as if excited mobs would reinstitute the  lynch law of the fifties.    
Nothing came of it all but such a prolonged exposure of general vileness  that it was possible to effect a certain number of reforms later by popular  vote. The system remained inviolate, even during the mayorship of a fine  old citizen too estimable to build up a rival machine; and the men of the  prosecution, after many bitter harassed months, when they walked and slept  with their lives in their hands, resigned themselves to the fact that no  San Francisco jury would ever convict a man who had the money to bribe it.    
All this had given Mortimer abundant material for conversation and he had  entertained Mrs. Groome and Alexina night after night with a report of the  day's events and the gossip of the street. Mrs. Groome had been intensely  interested, for this upheaval reminded her of personal episodes in the life  of her husband and father, the latter having been a member of the vigilance  committees of the fifties.    
She had been so delighted with the efforts of the prosecuting group to  bring the boss and the mayor to justice that she had permitted Alexina to  invite the Hofers to dinner; but when men of her own proud circle were  accused of crimes against society and threatened with San Quentin, nothing  could convince her of their guilt; and she asked Alexina to follow the  example of Maria and cut that Mrs. Hofer.    
Alexina had never been interested in the details of the prosecution; the  large moments of the drama and the social convulsions were enough for her.  She refused to cut Mrs. Hofer, although she ceased to call on her, as her  mother and her husband made such a point of it; but she gave little thought  to the sorrows of that ambitious young matron. She had other fish to fry.    
Two great hotels whose interiors had been swept by the fire were renovated  and furnished and their restaurants and ballrooms eagerly patronized. The  Assembly balls were resumed. There were dinners and dances in the Western  Addition, where many of the finest homes in the city had been built during  the past ten or twenty years; and entertaining Down the Peninsula had not  paused for more than two months after the disaster.    
Nevertheless, she had exulted in the fact that the husband of her choice  was able to please and entertain her mother-no easy feat. Moreover, as time  went on and interest in the Graft Prosecution wore thin, it was evident  that Mortimer had established himself firmly in his mother-in-law's graces.  He was not only the perfect husband but the son of her old age.    
She had lost Ballinger and Geary in her comparative youth, and Tom was  rarely in the house when she visited Rincona. But Mortimer was as devoted  to her in the little ways so appreciated by women of any age as he was to  his wife, and he was noiseless in the house and as prompt as the clock.  During her illness his devotion touched even Mrs. Abbott, although Mrs.  Groome was the only member of the family he ever won over.    
<b>VI</b>    
Poor Morty. In a way he was a failure, after all. The men of her set did  not seem to care any more for him than they did before her marriage,  although they were always polite and amiable; and the promise of those old  family friends to throw business in his way seemed to be forgotten as time  went on.    
No doubt they had thought he was able to stand on his own feet after a  while, but he had often looked depressed during the panic of nineteen-seven  and the long period of business drought that had followed. Still, he had  managed to hold his own, and his constitutional optimism was unshaken. He  <i>knew</i> that when times changed he would soon be a rich man, and Alexina  shared his faith. Not that she had ever cared particularly for great  wealth, but he talked so much about it that he had excited her imagination;  after all money was the thing these days, no doubt of that, and she had  heard "poor talk" all her life and was tired of it.    
Moreover, nothing could be more positive than that if Morty's father had  made a fortune in his own day, and the son inherited and administered it  with the canny vigilance which distinguished the sons of rich men to-day  from the mad spendthrifts of a former generation, he would be as logically  intimate with those young capitalists who were the renewed pillars of San  Francisco society, as she was with the most aloof and important of her own  sex.    
She had heard Judge Lawton and other men say that if a man were still a  clerk at thirty he was hopeless. The ruts were packed with the mediocre  whose destiny was the routine work of the world, whatever might be their  secret opinions of their unrecognized abilities and their resentment  against a system that anchored them.    
The young man of brains and initiative, of energy, ambition, vision  and balance, provided he were honorable as well, and temperate in his  pleasures, was the man the eager world was always waiting for.    
Alexina knew that the United States was almost as prolific in this fine  breed of young men as she still was in opportunities for the exceptional of  every class.    
And it was possible that Mortimer was not one of them.    
Once more she put a fact into bald words. She knew that her butterfly youth  had come to an end with her mother's death, and for a year she should be  very much alone, to say nothing of her new burden of responsibilities.  Thinking during that period was inevitable. She might as well begin now.    
Mortimer had some of those gifts. He worked like a dog, he was ambitious  and temperate and he was the soul of honor. But although his brain was  clear enough, the blindest love would, perceive in time that it lacked  originality.    
Did it also lack initiative, resource, that peculiar alertness and quick  pouncing quality of which she had heard? She wished she knew, but she had  never discussed her husband with any one. Certainly he had stood still.  Or was that merely the fault of the hard times? She had heard other men  complain as bitterly.    
"Fate handed you a lemon, old girl."    
Alexina could almost hear Aileen's mocking voice. She even gave a startled  glance down the quiet avenue. Well, she would never discuss him with Aileen  or any one else.    
Did she love him any longer? Had she ever loved him? What was love? She had  been quite happy with him in her own little way. What did girls of eighteen  know of love? Deliberately in her youthful arrogance and unlicensed  imagination she had manufactured a fool's paradise; and, a hero being  indispensable, had dragged him in after her.    
Perhaps she still loved him. She had read and seen enough to know that  love changed its character as the years went on. She respected his many  admirable qualities and she would never forget his devotion to her mother.    
She certainly liked him. And the family attitude roused her obstinate  championship as much as ever. At least she would always remain his good  friend, helping him as far as lay in her power. She had deliberately  selected her life partner and she would keep her part of the contract.  He filled his to the letter, or as far as in him lay. If he were not the  masterful superman of her dreams, at least he was quite obstinate enough to  have his own way in many things, in spite of his unswerving devotion to  her charming self. He was whitely angry when she received Bob Cheever one  afternoon when she was alone, and had forbidden her ever to receive a man  in the daytime again. If men wanted to call on a married woman they could  do so in the evening. She no longer danced more than twice with any man at  a party, and he refused to read her favorite books, new or old, and chilled  any attempt to discuss them in his presence.    
<b>VII</b>    
Well, after all, what did it matter? She had dreamed her dream and he was  better than most. She sprang to her feet and ran down the hill and across  the street to the house of Judge Lawton.
