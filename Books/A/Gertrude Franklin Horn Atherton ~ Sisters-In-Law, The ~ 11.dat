Gathbroke met Alexina Groome again a week later.    
On Saturday, when the fire was over, and she could retreat decently and  in good order, Mrs. Groome, to her young daughter's secret anguish, had  consented to rest her nerves for a fortnight at Rincona, Mrs. Abbott's home  in Alta.    
As Gora had predicted, Gathbroke found that it would have been hardly more  difficult to move his sister's body, now at an undertaker's in Fillmore  Street, out of the state in war-time than in the wake of a city's disaster,  which was scattering its population to every point of the railroad compass.  He had refused the space in the baggage car offered to him by the company;  it should: be a private car or nothing; and for that, in spite of all the  influence Gwynne and his powerful friends could bring to bear, he must  wait.    
Meanwhile Gwynne had asked him to stay with himself and his mother, Lady  Victoria Gwynne, at the house of his fiancee, Isabel Otis, on Russian Hill;  a massive cliff rising above one of the highest of the city's northern  hills, whose old houses, clinging to its steep sides had escaped the fire  that roared about its base. To-day it was a green and lofty oasis in the  midst of miles of smoking ruins.    
Gathbroke was as nervous as only a young Englishman within his immemorial  armor can be. Gwynne, who had gone through the same nerve-racking crisis,  although from different causes, understood what he suffered and pressed him  into service in the distribution of government rations, and garments to  the different refugee camps. But Gathbroke had the active imagination of  intelligent youth, and he never forgot to blame himself for lingering in  New York with some interesting chaps he had met on the <i>Majestic</i>, and  afterward in Southern California, seduced by its soft climate and violent  color. Unquestionably, if he had stayed on his job, as these expressive  Americans put it, his sister would have been in New York, possibly on the  Atlantic Ocean when San Francisco shook herself to ruin.    
"But not necessarily alive," said Lady Victoria callously, removing her  cigar, her heavy eyes that looked like empty volcanos, staring down over  the smoldering waste. "People with heart disease don't invariably wait for  an earthquake to jolt them out of life. Assume that her time had come and  think of something else or you'll become a silly ass of a neurotic."    
Gwynne, more sympathetic, continued to find him what distraction he could,  and one day drove him down the Peninsula with a message from the Committee  of Fifty to Tom Abbott; who had caught a heavy cold during those three days  when he had driven a car filled with dynamite and had had scarcely an hour  for rest. He was now at home in bed.

The Abbott's place, Rincona, stood on a foothill behind the other estates  of Alta and surrounded by a park of two hundred acres set thick with  magnificent oaks. Gathbroke had never seen finer ones in England or France.  Gwynne before entering the avenue drove to an elevation above the house and  stopped the car for a moment.    
The great San Mateo valley looked like a close forest of ancient oaks  broken inartistically by the roofs of houses shorn of their chimneys.  Beyond, on the eastern side of a shallow southern arm of the Bay of San  Francisco, was the long range of the Contra Costa mountains, its waving  indented slopes incredibly graceful in outline and lovely in color. Gwynne  had pointed out their ever changing tints and shades as they drove through  the valley; at the moment they were heliotrope deepening to purple in the  hollows.    
Behind the foothills above Rincona rose the lofty mountains which in  Maria Abbott's youth had seemed to tower above the valley a solid wall of  redwoods; but long since plundered and defaced for the passing needs of  man.    
"Great country--what?" said Gwynne, starting the car. "You couldn't pry me  away from it--that is, unless I have the luck to represent it in Washington  half the year. You'll be coming back yourself some day."    
"I? Never. I hate the sight of its grinning blue sky after the red horror  of those three days. I haven't seen a cloud as big as my hand, and in  common decency it should howl and stream for months."    
"Well, forget it for a day. Perhaps you will be placed next the fair  Alexina at luncheon--"    
"Alexina...?"    
"Groome. You must have met her at the Hofer ball."    
"She--what--possible--"    
Gwynne looked at his stuttering and flushed young cousin and burst into  laughter.    
"As bad as that, was it? Well, she's not bespoken as far as I know. Wade in  and win. You have my blessing. She is almost as beautiful as Isabel--"    
"She's quite as beautiful as Miss Otis."    
"Oh, very well. No doubt I'd think so myself if I hadn't happened to meet  Isabel first, and if I were not too old for her anyway."    
Gwynne could think of no better remedy for demoralized nerves than a  flirtation with a resourceful California girl, and if Dick annexed a living  companion for his trying journey to England so much the better.    
Gathbroke's excitement subsided quickly. He was in no condition for  sustained enthusiasm. He felt as if quite ten years had passed since he  had half fallen in love with Alexina Groome in a ball room that was now  a charred heap in the sodden wreck of a city he barely could conjure in  memory.    
Besides, he had half fallen in love so often. And she was too young. He had  really been more drawn to that strange Miss Dwight; upon whom, however, he  had not yet called.    
He felt thankful that the girl <i>was</i> too young for his critical taste. He  wanted nothing more at present in the way of emotions.
