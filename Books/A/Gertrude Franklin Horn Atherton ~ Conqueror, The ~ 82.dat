The next seven years of Hamilton's life must be reviewed very rapidly.  Interesting as they might be made, space diminishes, and after all they  were but the precursor of the last great battle of the giants.    
In the spring of 1794 the Virginian ring rallied for their final assault  in Congress. Their spokesman this time was a worthless man, named  Fraunces, and he brought forth a charge against the Secretary of the  Treasury of unfaithfulness in office. Hamilton promptly demanded another  investigation. The result may be found in the following letters from  eminent Federals in Virginia. The first is from Colonel Carrington,  dated Richmond, July 9th.    <blockquote>
 I do not write this letter as congratulatory upon the final issue   of the Inquiry into the Treasury Department, as I never conceived   you exposed to receive injury therefrom. I write to express my most   sincere wishes that you will not suffer the illiberality with which   you have been treated to deprive the public of your services, at   least until the storm which hangs over us, and is to be dreaded,   not less from our own follies and vices than the malignance and   intrigues of foreigners, blows over. It is true you have been   abused, but it has been and still is, the fate of him who was   supposed out of the reach of all slander. It is indeed the lot, in   some degree, of every man amongst us who has the sense or fortitude   to speak and act rationally, and such men must continue so to speak   and act if we are saved from anarchy.</blockquote>    
On July 20th, Thomas Corbin wrote to Hamilton deploring the political  conditions in Virginia created by Thomas Jefferson, in which these  significant passages occur:--    <blockquote>
 Calumny and misrepresentation are the only weapons made use of by   the faction of Virginia. By a dexterous management of these they   have brought into popular disrepute, and even into popular odium,   some of the wisest and best characters in the United States.    
 War is waged by this faction against every candidate who possesses   the union of requisites. Independent fortune, independent   principles, talents, and integrity are denounced as badges of   aristocracy; but if you add to these good manners and a decent   appearance, his political death is decreed without the benefit of a   hearing. In short, with a few exceptions everything that appertains   to the character of a gentleman is ostracized. That yourself and   Mr. Jay should be no favorites in Virginia, is not to be wondered   at. But all those whose good opinion is worth your acceptance   entertain for you both the same veneration and esteem, and hear the   aspersions of your enemies with the same indignation that I do;   who, after the closest examination, and the purest conviction can   conscientiously subscribe myself etc.</blockquote>    
In the autumn the whiskey disturbances in western Pennsylvania assumed  such serious proportions that Hamilton insisted upon recourse to arms.  With his usual precision he had calculated the numbers of the  insurgents, and the amount of troops necessary to overwhelm them.  Washington issued requisitions for fifteen thousand men, and set out  with the troops, his first intention being to command in person.  Hamilton accompanied him, and upon the President's return to  Philadelphia, assumed the general superintendence of the army, whose  commander, Henry Lee, was one of his devoted adherents. Many motives  have been ascribed to Hamilton for this exceptional proceeding, and  Washington was bitterly assailed for "not being able to move without his  favourite Secretary at his elbow," and for giving additional  conspicuousness to a man whose power already was a "menace to Republican  liberties." Randolph, then the nominal Secretary of State, but quite  aware that while Hamilton remained in the Cabinet he was but a  figurehead, was so wroth, that later, in his futile "Vindication,"  following what practically was his expulsion from the Cabinet, he  animadverted bitterly upon a favour which no one but Hamilton would  have presumed to ask. Fauchet, the successor of Genet, in the  intercepted letter to his government, which brought about the fall of  Randolph, convicting him of corruption and treachery, has this to say:--    <blockquote>
 The army marched; the President made known that he was going to   command it; Hamilton, as I have understood, requested to follow   him; the President dared not refuse him. It does not require much,   penetration to divine the object of this journey. In the President   it was wise, it might also be his duty. But in Mr. Hamilton it was   a consequence of the profound policy which directs all his steps; a   measure dictated by a perfect knowledge of the human heart. Was it   not interesting for him, for his party, tottering under the weight   of events without and accusations within, to proclaim an intimacy   more perfect than ever with the President, whose very name is a   sufficient shield against the most formidable attacks? Now, what   more evident mark could the President give of his intimacy than by   suffering Mr. Hamilton, whose name, even, is understood in the west   as that of a public enemy, to go and place himself at the head of   the army which went, if I may use the expression, to cause his   system to triumph against the opposition of the people? The   presence of Mr. Hamilton with the army must attach it more than   ever to his party.</blockquote>    
There were depths in Hamilton's mind which no wise mortal will ever  attempt to plumb. It is safe to say he did nothing without one eye on a  far-reaching policy; and aside from the pleasure of being in the saddle  once more, riding over the wild Alleghanies in keen October weather,  after four years of the stenches and climatic miseries of Philadelphia,  aside from his fear of Governor Miffin's treachery, and his lack of  implicit confidence in Lee's judgement, it is quite likely that he had  some underlying motive relative to the advantage of his party, which had  been weakened by the incessant assaults upon himself. By going with the  army he not only demonstrated the perfect confidence reposed in him by  Washington, and his determination that his laws should be enforced, but  he gave emphasis to his belief that the resistance to the Excise Law had  been deliberately instigated by the Republicans under the leadership of  his avowed enemies. In this connection the following extract from  Fauchet's letter is highly interesting, intimate as he was with the  Republican leaders.    <blockquote>
 Such therefore were the parts of the public grievance, upon which   the western people most insisted. Now, these complaints were   systematizing by the conversations of influential men, who retired   into those wild countries, and who from principle, or from a series   of particular heart-burnings, animated discontents already too near   to effervescence. At last the local explosion is effected. The   western people calculated on being supported by some distinguished   characters in the east, and even imagined they had in the bosom of   the government some abettors, who might share in their grievance or   their principle.</blockquote>    
The rioters, sobered by the organized force and its formidable numbers,  surrendered without bloodshed.    
In January of the following year Hamilton resigned from the Cabinet. The  pressing need of his services was over, and he had many reasons for  retiring from office: his health was seriously impaired, he had a  growing family of boys to educate; he expected his father by every ship  from the Windward Islands, to spend his last years in the home to which  his son had so often invited him; Mrs. Mitchell was now a widow and  almost penniless; and his disgust of office was so uncompromising that  no consideration short of an imperative public duty would have induced  him to continue. But his principal reason, as he wrote to Mrs. Church,  was that he wished to indulge his domestic happiness more freely.  Washington let him go with the less reluctance because he promised  immediate response to any demand the President might make upon him. He  went with his wife, Angelica, and the younger children to Albany and the  Saratoga estate, where he remained until the first of June, endeavouring  to regain his health in the forest and on the river. Young Lafayette  lived with him until his return to France, in 1798.    
Upon Hamilton's return to New York he immediately engaged in practice,  which he supplemented by coaching students; but he continued to be  Washington's chief adviser, and the correspondence was continuous upon  every problem which confronted the harassed President. Indeed, when one  reads its bulk, one wonders if the Cabinet did anything but execute  Hamilton's suggestions. Randolph kicked his heels in impotent wrath, and  his successor's correspondence with Hamilton was almost as voluminous  as Washington's. So was Wolcott's, who hardly cancelled a bond without  his former chief's advice; William Smith, the auditor-general, was  scarcely less insistent for orders. Hamilton wrote at length to all of  them, as well as to the numerous members of Congress who wanted advice,  or an interpretation of some Constitutional provision hitherto on the  shelf. What time he had for his practice and students would remain a  mystery, were it not for the manifest price he paid in the vigours of  all but will and brain.    
During the summer of 1794 Talleyrand visited the United States. He  brought a package from Mrs. Church to Mrs. Hamilton, and a cordial  letter from the same important source to the statesman whom he ranked  higher than any man of his time. "He improves upon acquaintance," wrote  Mrs. Church to her sister; "I regret that you do not speak French." But  her sister's husband spoke French better than any man in America, and  after the resignation from the Cabinet, Talleyrand spent most of his  time in the little red brick house at 26 Broadway, where Hamilton was  working to recover his lost position at the bar. "I have seen the eighth  wonder of the world," wrote the Frenchman, one morning, after a ramble  in the small hours, which had taken him past the light in Hamilton's  study, "I have seen the man who has made the fortune of a nation,  toiling all night to supply his family with bread." The men found great  delight in each other's society. Hamilton was the most accomplished and  versatile man in America, the most brilliant of conversationists, the  most genial of companions, and hospitable of hosts. Talleyrand  epitomized Europe to him; and the French statesman had met no one in his  crowded life who knew it better. If he gave to Hamilton the concentrated  essence of all that ardent brain had read and dreamed of, of all that  fate had decreed he never should see in the mass, Talleyrand placed on  record his tribute to Hamilton's unmortal powers of divination, and  loved and regretted him to the close of his life.    
Different as the men were in character, they had two points in  common,--a passionate patriotism, and the memory of high ideals. Public  life had disposed of Talleyrand's ideals, and Hamilton, after an  education in the weakness and wickedness of human nature which left  nothing to be desired, would have been equally destitute, had it not  been for his temperamental gaiety and buoyant philosophy. There were  times when these deserted him, and he brooded in rayless depths, but his  Celtic inheritance and the vastness of his intellect saved him from  despair until the end. Talleyrand was by no means an uncheerful soul;  but his genius, remarkable as it was, flowed between narrower lines, and  was unwatered by that humanity which was Hamilton's in such volume. Both  men had that faculty of seeing things exactly as they are, which the  shallow call cynicism; and those lost conversations appeal to the  imagination of the searcher after truth.    
Jay's treaty was the most formidable question with which Hamilton was  called upon to deal before the retirement of Washington to private life,  and it gave him little less trouble than if he had remained in the  Cabinet.    
It had been his idea to send a special envoy to England to remonstrate  with the British Government for her abominable oppressions and  accumulating outrages, decide if possible upon a treaty with her which  would soothe the excitement in the United States,--as wild in the spring  of 1794 as the Jacobin fever,--and avert war. It was the desire of  Washington and the eminent Federalists that this mission be undertaken  by Hamilton, for he had an especial faculty for getting what he wanted:  however obstinate he might be, his diplomacy was of the first order when  he chose to use it. But he believed that, having suggested the mission,  he could not with propriety accept it, and that his services could be  given more effectively in the Cabinet. Moreover, the violent opposition  which the proposal immediately raised among the Republicans, notably  Randolph and Monroe,--the latter so far transcending etiquette as to  write to Washington, denouncing his Secretary of the Treasury,--made it  probable that his enemies would defeat his confirmation in the Senate.  He suggested the name of Chief Justice Jay; and after the usual bitter  preliminaries, that exalted but not very forcible personage sailed for  England in the latter part of April, 1794. Negotiations were very slow,  for Britain still felt for us a deep and sullen resentment, nourished by  our Jacobin enthusiasms. In January, however, news came that the treaty  was concluded; and Hamilton, supposing that the matter was settled,  resigned from the Cabinet. It has been asserted that when he read this  famous instrument, he characterized it as "an old woman's treaty," and  it is very probable that he did. Nevertheless, when, after a stormy  passage through the Senate, it was launched upon the country, and,  systematically manipulated by the practised arts of Jacobinism, carried  the United States almost to the verge of civil war, Hamilton accepted  the treaty as the best obtainable, and infinitely preferable to further  troubles. He took up his pen, having previously been stoned while  attempting to speak in its defence, and in a series of papers signed  "Catullus," wrote as even he had not done since the days of "The  Federalist." Their effect was felt at once; and as they continued to  issue, and Hamilton's sway over the public mind, his genius for moulding  opinion, became with each more manifest, Jefferson, terrified and  furious, wrote to Madison:--    <blockquote>
 Hamilton is really a Colossus to the anti-Republican party. Without   numbers he is a host in himself. They have got themselves into a   defile where they might be finished; but too much security on the   Republican part will give time to his talents and indefatigableness   to extricate them. We have had only middling performances to oppose   him. In truth when he comes forward there is no one but yourself   can meet him.... For God's sake take up your pen and give a   fundamental reply to "Curtius" and "Camillus."</blockquote>    
But Madison had had enough of pen encounter with Hamilton. "He who puts  himself on paper with Hamilton is lost," Burr had said; and Madison  agreed with him, and entered the lists no more. The excitement gradually  subsided. It left ugly scars behind it, but once more Hamilton had saved  his party, and perhaps the Union. In connection with the much disputed  authorship of the Farewell Address I will merely quote a statement,  heretofore unpublished, made by Mrs. Hamilton, in the year 1840.    <blockquote>
 Desiring that my children shall be fully acquainted with the   services rendered by their father to our country, and the   assistance rendered by him to General Washington during his   administrations, for the one great object, the independence and   stability of the government of the United States, there is one   thing in addition to the numerous proofs which I leave them, and   which I feel myself in duty bound to state: which is that a short   time previous to General Washington's retiring from the Presidency,   in the year 1796, General Hamilton suggested to him the idea of   delivering a farewell address to the people on his withdrawal from   public life, with which idea General Washington was well pleased,   and in his answer to General Hamilton's suggestion, gave him the   heads of the subject on which he would wish to remark, with a   request that Mr. Hamilton would prepare a draft for him. Mr.   Hamilton did so, and the address was written principally at such   times as his office was seldom frequented by his clients and   visitors, and during the absence of his students to avoid   interruption; at which times he was in the habit of calling me to   sit with him, that he might read to me as he wrote, in order, as he   said, to discover how it sounded upon the ear, and making the   remark, "My dear Eliza, you must be to me what old Moliere's nurse   was to him."    
 The whole or nearly all the "address" was read to me by him, as he   wrote it, and the greater part if not all was written in my   presence. The original was forwarded to General Washington, who   approved of it with the exception of one paragraph; of, I think,   from four to five lines, which, if I mistake not, was on the   subject of the public schools; which was stricken out. It was   afterward returned to Mr. Hamilton who made the desired alteration,   and was afterward delivered to General Washington, and published in   that form, and has since been known as "General Washington's   Farewell Address." Shortly after the publication of the address, my   husband and myself were walking in Broadway when an old soldier   accosted him with the request of him to purchase General   Washington's farewell address, which he did, and turning to me   said, "That man does not know he has asked me to purchase my own   work."    
 The whole circumstances are at this moment so perfectly in my mind   that I can call to mind his bringing General Washington's letter to   me, who returned the address, and remarked on the only alteration   which he (General Washington) had requested to be made.    
 New York, Aug. 7th, 1840.    
 ELIZABETH HAMILTON. JAMES A. WASHINGTON. JA.R. MACDONALD.</blockquote>    
In 1797 Hamilton was forced by treachery and the malignancy of  Jacobinism into the most painful and mortifying act of his public  career. He had been hailed by certain enthusiastic Federalists as the  legitimate successor of Washington. It was a noble ambition, and there  is no doubt that Hamilton would have cherished it, had he been less of a  philosopher, less in the habit of regarding a desire for the impossible  as a waste of time. Not only were older men in the direct line of  promotion, but he knew that as the author of the Excise Law he was hated  by one section of the Commonwealth, and that as the parent of the  manufacturing interest, to say nothing of the Assumption measure, he had  incurred the antagonism of the entire South. Lest these causes for  disqualification be obscured by the brilliancy of his reputation,  Jefferson's unresting and ramifying art had indelibly impressed the  public mind with the monarchical-aristocratical tendencies and designs  of the former Secretary of the Treasury, and of his hatred for a beloved  cause overseas. Hamilton had given an absolute negative to every  suggestion to use his name; but one at least had found its way into  print, and so terrified the enemy that they determined upon one more  powerful blow at his good name. Monroe had a fresh cause for hatred in  his humiliating recall from France, which he ascribed to the influence  of Hamilton. No doubt the trio were well satisfied for a time with their  carefully considered scheme. The pamphlet published in 1797, called "The  History of the United States for 1796," and edited by a disreputable man  named Callender, was the concentrated essence of Jacobinical fury and  vindictiveness against Alexander Hamilton. It surpassed any attack yet  made on him, while cleverly pretending to be an arraignment of the  entire Federalist party; shrieking so loudly at times against  Washington, Adams, and Jay, that the casual reader would overlook the  sole purport of the pamphlet. "It is ungenerous to triumph over the  ruins of declining fame," magnanimously finished its attack upon  Washington. "Upon this account not a word more shall be said!"    
It omitted a recital of the two Congressional attacks upon Hamilton's  financial integrity, as to refrain from all mention of the vindications  would have been impossible; but it raked up everything else for which  it had space, sought to prove him a liar by his defence of the Jay  treaty in the Camillus papers, and made him insult Washington in  language so un-Hamiltonian that to-day it excites pity for the  desperation of the Virginians. When it finally arrived at the pith and  marrow of the assault, however, it was with quite an innocent air. This  was a carefully concocted version of the Reynolds affair. Callender had  obtained possession of the papers which Monroe, Muhlenberg, and Venable  had prepared to submit to the President, before hearing Hamilton's  explanation. He asserted that this explanation was a lie, and that the  Secretary of the Treasury had not only speculated with the public funds,  but that he had made thirty thousand pounds by the purchase of army  certificates. It was also alleged that Hamilton ordered his name  withdrawn as a Presidential candidate, in consequence of a threat that  otherwise these same papers would be published.    
It is a curious instance of the fatuity of contemporaries, that  Hamilton's enemies reckoned upon a sullen silence, in the face of  damning assault, from the greatest fighter of his time. Indubitably,  they argued that he would think it best to pass the matter over; no man  could be expected to give to the public the full explanation. But they  reckoned with an insufficient knowledge of this host, as they had done  many a time before. Hamilton had no desire to hold office again, but he  was still the great leader of a great party, as determined as ever that  at no cost should there be a stain on his public honour. He consulted  with his closest friends, among them his wife. As the sin was now five  years old--and the woman a derelict--Mrs. Hamilton found it easier to  forgive than an unconfessed liaison with the most remarkable woman of  her time. Although she anticipated the mortification of the exposure  quite as keenly as her husband, she cherished his good name no less  tenderly, and without hesitation counselled him to give the facts to the  public. This he did in a pamphlet which expounded the workings of the  "Jacobin Scandal Club," told the unpleasant story without reserve, and  went relentlessly into the details of the part played in it by Monroe,  Muhlenberg, and Venable. He forced affidavits from those bewildered  gentlemen, the entire correspondence was published, and the pamphlet  itself was a masterpiece of biting sarcasm and convincing statement. It  made a tremendous sensation, but even his enemies admired his courage.  The question of his financial probity was settled for all time, although  the missile, failing in one direction, quivered in the horrified brains  of many puritanical voters. Mrs. Reynolds, now living with Clingman,  made no denial, and it is doubtful if even she would have echoed the one  animadversion of the discomfited enemy,--that Hamilton had given the  name of a mistress to the public. It is a weak and dangerous  sentimentalism which would protect a woman of commerce against the good  name of any man. The financial settlement makes her a party in a  contract, nothing more, and acquits the payer of all further  responsibility. She has no good name to protect; she has asked for  nothing but money; she is a public character, whom to shield would be a  thankless task. When this Reynolds woman added the abomination of  blackmail to her trade, and further attempted the ruin of the man who  had shown her nothing but generosity and consideration, it need hardly  be added that Hamilton would have been a sentimental fool to have  hesitated on any ground but detestation of a public scandal.    
He never traced the betrayal of a secret which all concerned had  promised to keep inviolate, but he had his suspicions. Mrs. Croix, now  living in a large house on the Bowling Green, was the animated and  resourceful centre of Jacobinism. She wore a red cap to the theatre and  a tri-coloured cockade on the street. Her <i>salon</i> was the headquarters  of the Republican leaders, and many a plot was hatched in her inspiring  presence. The Virginian Junta were far too clever to put themselves in  the power of a drunkard like Callender, but they were constantly in  collusion with Mrs. Croix. They knew that she feared nothing under  heaven, and that she had devoted herself to Hamilton's ruin. Callender  drew upon her for virus whenever his own supply ran down, and would  have hailed the Reynolds concoction, even had it gone to him naked and  begging. Hamilton saw the shadow of a fair hand throughout the entire  pamphlet, and, indeed, could have traced many an envenomed shaft, since  1793, to a source which once had threatened to cloy him with its  sweetness.    
Meanwhile John Adams had been elected President of the United States,  and Thomas Jefferson, Vice-President. Hamilton had made no secret of the  fact that he should prefer to see Thomas Pinckney succeed Washington,  for he contemplated the possibility of Adams in the Executive Chair,  with distrust and uneasiness. In spite of that eminent statesman's  intrepidity, integrity, and loyal Federalism, he was, in Hamilton's  opinion, too suspicious, jealous of influence, and hot headed, to be a  safe leader in approaching storms. With Pinckney as a brilliant and  popular figurehead, Hamilton well knew that his own hand would remain on  the helm. With the irascible old gentleman from Massachusetts in the  Chair, his continued predominance was by no means certain. Washington  once said of Hamilton that he undoubtedly was ambitious, but that his  ambition was of that laudable kind which prompts a man to excel in  whatever he takes in hand; adding that his judgement was intuitively  great. The truth was that Hamilton regarded the United States as his  child. He had made her wealthy and respected, he foresaw a future  importance for her equal to that of any state in Europe. "I anticipate,"  he wrote to Rufus King, "that this country will, ere long, assume an  attitude correspondent with its great destinies--majestic, efficient,  and operative of great things. A noble career lies before it." The first  of the "Imperialists," he had striven for years to awaken the Government  to the importance of obtaining possession of Louisiana and the Floridas,  and he also had his eye on South America. Naturally, he wanted no  interruption; the moment the security of the country was threatened, he  was as alert and anxious as if his nursery were menaced with an Indian  invasion. Without conceit or vanity no man ever was more conscious of  his great powers; moreover, no American had made such sacrifices as he.  Washington and almost all the leading men possessed independent  fortunes. Hamilton had manifested his ability from the first to equal  the income of the wealthiest, did he give his unbroken services to the  pursuit of his profession. But he had lived for years upon a pittance,  frequently driven to borrow small sums from his friends, that he might  devote his energies entirely to his country. And no man ever gave more  generously or with less thought of reward; although he would have been  the last to deny his enjoyment of power. For a born leader of men to  care little whether he had a few trusted friends or an army at his back,  would merely indicate a weak spot in his brain.    
It was quite natural, therefore, that he thought upon John Adams's  idiosyncrasies with considerable disquiet. Nevertheless, with the high  priest of Jacobinism in the field, his first object was to secure the  office for the Federalist party. The race was too close for serious  consideration of any other ultimate. He counselled every Federalist to  cast his vote for Adams and Pinckney; better a tie, with the victory to  Adams, than Thomas Jefferson at the head of the Nation. Of course there  was a hope that Pinckney might carry the South. But the Adams  enthusiasts dreaded this very issue, and threw away their votes for the  Vice-Presidency. Pinckney's followers in the South pursued the same  policy. The consequence was that Adams won by three votes only. Again  his pride was bruised, and again he attributed his mortification to  Hamilton. If he had disliked him before, his dislike in a constant state  of irritation through the ascendency and fame of the younger man, he  hated him now with a bitterness which formed a dangerous link between  himself and the Republican leaders. The time came when he was ready to  humiliate his country and ruin his own chance of reelection, to dethrone  his rival from another proud eminence and check his upward course.  Another source of bitterness was Hamilton's continued leadership of the  Federalist party, when himself, as President, was entitled to that  distinction. But that party was Hamilton's; he had created, developed  it, been its Captain through all its triumphant course. Even had he  been content to resign his commission,--which he did not contemplate for  a moment,--the great majority of the Federalists would have forced it  into his hand again. Adams declared war. Hamilton, always ready for a  fight, when no immediate act of statesmanship was involved, took up the  gauntlet. Adams might resist his influence, but the Cabinet was his, and  so were some of the most influential members of Congress, including  Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts, the president pro tem. of the  Senate. It was some time before Adams realized the full extent of this  influence; but when he did discover that his Secretary of State, Timothy  Pickering, his Secretary of the Treasury, Oliver Wolcott, and his  Secretary of War, James M'Henry, were in the habit of consulting  Hamilton upon every possible question before giving the President their  valuable opinions, and that upon one occasion, at least, a letter of  Hamilton's had been incorporated by the Secretary of War into a  Presidential Message, he was like to die of apoplexy. He wrote, in his  wrath:--    <blockquote>
 Hamilton is commander-in-chief of the Senate, of the House of   Representatives, of the heads of departments, of General   Washington, and last, and least, if you will, of the President of   the United States!</blockquote>    
But the President's advisers were free to seek advice without the  Cabinet if they chose, and Washington had encouraged them to go to  Hamilton. Hamilton was at liberty to give it, and Adams could find no  evidence that he had counselled rebellion against himself; nor that he  had used his great influence for any purpose but the honour of the  country.    
And never had the country needed his services more. When Adams, grim and  obstinate, stepped forward as head of the Nation, he found himself  confronted with the menace of France. In retaliation for Genet's  disgrace, the Revolutionists had demanded the recall of Gouverneur  Morris, whose barely disguised contempt, and protection of more than one  royalist, had brought him perilously near to the guillotine. Burr had  desired the vacant mission, and his pretensions were urged by Monroe and  Madison. Washington recognized this as a device of the Opposition to  embarrass him, and he had the lowest opinion of Burr's rectitude and  integrity. Pressure and wrath produced no effect, but he offered to  appoint Monroe. It might be wise to send a Jacobin, and the President  hoped that ambition would preserve this one from compromising the  country. He made the mistake of not weighing Monroe's mental capacity  more studiously. The least said of the wild gallop into diplomacy of our  fifth President the better. He was recalled, and Charles Cotesworth  Pinckney sent in his place. The French, who had found Monroe entirely to  their taste, refused to receive the distinguished lawyer and soldier. To  escape indignity he was forced to retire to Holland. The new Republic  violated her treaties with increasing insolence, and Bonaparte was  thundering on his triumphant course. France was mocking the world, and  in no humour to listen to the indignant protests of a young and distant  nation. To dismember her by fanning the spirit of Jacobinism, and, at  the ripe moment,--when internal warfare had sufficiently weakened  her,--reduce her to a French colony, was a plot of which Hamilton, Rufus  King, then minister to England, and other astute statesmen more than  suspected her. But although Hamilton abhorred France and was outraged at  her attitude, the spirit of moderation which had regulated all his acts  in public life suffered no fluctuation, and he immediately counselled  the sending of a commission to make a final attempt before recourse to  arms. War, if inevitable, but peace with honour if possible; it was not  fair to disturb the prosperity of the young country except as a last  resort. For once he and Adams were agreed. Hamilton suggested Jefferson  or Madison as a sop to the Revolutionists, with two Federalists to keep  him in order. But the President would have his own commissioners or  none. He despatched Marshall and Gerry and ordered C.C. Pinckney to join  them. Talleyrand refused them official reception, and sent to them, in  secret, nameless minions--known officially, later on, as X.Y.Z.--who  made shameful proposals, largely consisting of inordinate demand for  tribute. Marshall and Pinckney threw up the commission in disgust. The  Opposition in Congress demanded the correspondence; and Adams, with his  grimmest smile, sent it to the Senate. It was a terrible blow to the  Jacobins, not only the manner in which France had prejudiced her  interests in this country; some of the disclosures were extremely  painful to ponder upon. "Perhaps," one of the backstairs ambassadors had  remarked, "you believe that, in returning and exposing to your  countrymen the unreasonableness of the demands of this Government, you  will unite them in resistance to those demands. You are mistaken. You  ought to know that the diplomatic skill of France, and the means she  possesses in your country, are sufficient to enable her, with <i>the  French party in America</i>, to throw the blame, which will attend the  rupture, on the Federalists, as you term yourselves, but the British  party, as France terms you; and you may assure yourselves this will be  done." Jefferson retired to weep alone. Several of the faction resigned  from Congress. Hamilton published his pamphlets, "The Stand," "France,"  and "The Answer," and the whole country burst into a roar of vengeance,  echoing Pinckney's parting shot: "Millions for defence, not a cent for  tribute!" "Hail Columbia" was composed, and inflamed the popular  excitement. Federalist clubs paraded, wearing a black cockade, and one  street riot followed another. Brockholst Livingston had his nose pulled,  and killed his man. With the exception of the extreme Jacobins, who  never swerved from their devotion to France and the principles she had  promulgated with the guillotine, the country was for war to a man, and  the President inundated with letters and memorials of encouragement. The  immediate result was the augmentation of the Federalist party, and the  decline of Jacobinism.    
For a long while past, Hamilton had been urging naval and military  preparations. A bold front, he thought, would be more effective than  diplomacy; and the sequel proved his wisdom. When the crisis came a bill  for a Provisional Army was passed at once, another for the increase of  the Navy, and liberal appropriations were made. The proposed alliance  with Great Britain, Hamilton effectually opposed, for he was almost as  exasperated with England as with France; in her fear that the French  party in the United States would triumph and declare war upon her, she  had renewed her depredations upon our commerce.    
Few believed that Washington would serve again, and the Nation turned  naturally to Hamilton as its General-in-chief. He had manifestly been  born to extricate them from difficulties. Even the Presidential faction  put their pride in their pockets, and agreed that he was the one man in  the country of matchless resource and military genius; they passed over  the veterans of the war without controversy. But there was one man who  never put his pride in his pocket, and that was John Adams. Rather than  present to Alexander Hamilton another opportunity for distinction and  power, he would himself cull fresh laurels for George Washington; the  supply of his old rival was now so abundant that new ones would add  nothing. Hamilton already had written to Washington as peremptorily as  only he dared, urging that he must come forth once more and without  hesitation. Washington replied that he would as cheerfully go to the  tombs of his ancestors, but admitted the obligation, and asked Hamilton  would he serve with him? Hamilton answered that he would on condition  that he be second in command to himself; he would make no further  sacrifice for an inconsiderable reward. When Washington, therefore,  received Adams's invitation, he made his acceptance conditional upon  being given the power to appoint his generals next in rank. Adams,  meanwhile, without waiting for his answer, had sent his name to the  Senate, and it had been confirmed as a matter of course. Washington was  irritated, but persisted in his condition, and sent in the names of  Alexander Hamilton for Inspector-General, with the rank of  Major-General, C.C. Pinckney and Knox for Major-Generals, and a list of  Brigadiers and Adjutant-Generals. Adams, fuming, sent the names to the  Senate, and they were confirmed in the order in which Washington had  written them; but when they came back, jealousy and temper mastered him,  and he committed the intemperate act which tolled the death-knell of the  Federalist party: he ordered the commissions made out with Hamilton's  name third on the list. Knox and Pinckney, he declared, were entitled to  precedence; and so the order should stand or not at all. He had not  anticipated an outcry, and when it arose, angry and determined, he was  startled but unshaken. The leading men in Congress waited upon him; he  received a new deluge of letters, and the most pointed of them was from  John Jay. Hamilton alone held his peace. He saw the terrible mistake  Adams had made, and dreaded the result. He wrote to Washington that he  should be governed entirely by his wishes, that he should not embarrass  him in any manner, and that it never should be said of himself that his  ambition or interest had stood in the way of the public welfare. But  when Adams stood with his head down, like an angry bull, and it was  plain to be seen that his astonishing attitude was prompted by personal  hatred alone, when the Cabinet and all the eminent men in the Nation,  with the exception of the Republican leaders, faced him with an equally  determined front, there was nothing for Hamilton to do but to stand his  ground; and he stood it. Washington put an end to the unfortunate  controversy. He gave Adams his choice between submission or the  selection of another General-in-chief. Adams submitted, but Hamilton had  in him an enemy no less malignant than Thomas Jefferson himself. Adams  had roused the deep implacability of Hamilton's nature. All hope of even  an armed truce for party advantage between the two great Federalists was  over. Hamilton had one cause for resentment which alone would have made  him ardently desire retaliation: General Knox, who had loved him  devotedly for twenty years, was bitterly alienated, and the breach was  never healed.    
Hamilton made his headquarters in New York, where he could, after a  fashion, attend to his law practice,--he was now the leading counsel at  the bar,--but he entered upon his new duties with all his old spirit and  passionate energy. Although France might be discomfited by the readiness  and resource of the United States, the imposing front erected by a  universal indignation, there were reasons which made the reverse  possible; and Hamilton thrilled with all the military ardours of his  youth at the prospect of realizing those half-forgotten ambitions. He  had, in those days, sacrificed his burning desire for action and glory  to a sense of duty which had ruled him through life like a tyrannical  deity. Was he to reap the reward at this late hour? finish his life,  perhaps, as he had planned to begin it? Once more he felt a boundless  gratitude for the best friend a mortal ever made. Washington passed  Hamilton over the heads of those superior in military rank, because he  knew that he alone was equal to the great task for which himself was too  old and infirm; but Hamilton never doubted that he did it with a deep  sense of satisfied justice and of gratitude.    
Never had Hamilton's conspicuous talent for detail, unlimited capacity  for work, genius for creating something out of nothing, marshalled for  more active service than now. He withheld his personal supervision from  nothing; planning forts, preparing codes of tactics, organizing a  commissariat department, drafting bills for Congress, advising M'Henry  upon every point which puzzled that unfinished statesman, were but a few  of the exercises demanded of the organizer of an army from raw material.  The legislation upon one of his bills finally matured a pet project of  many years, the Military Academy at West Point. Philip Church, the  oldest son of Angelica Schuyler, was his aide; John Church, after a  brilliant career as a member of Parliament, having returned to American  citizenship, his wife to as powerful a position as she had held in  London.    
It is hardly necessary to inform any one who has followed the fortunes  of Hamilton as far as this that he purposed to command an army of  aggression as well as defence. A war with France unrolled infinite  possibilities. Louisiana and the Floridas should be seized as soon as  war was declared, and he lent a kindly ear to Miranda, who was for  overthrowing the inhuman rule of Spain in South America. "To arrest the  progress of the revolutionary doctrines France was then propagating in  those regions, and to unite the American hemisphere in one great  society of common interests and common principles against the  corruption, the vices, the new theories of Europe," was an alluring  prospect to a man who had given the broadest possible interpretation to  the Constitution, and whose every conception had borne the stamp of an  imperialistic boldness and amplitude.    
But these last of his dreams ended in national humiliation. This time he  had sacrificed his private interests, his vital forces, for worse than  nothing. One enemy worked his own ruin, and Louisiana was to add to the  laurels of Jefferson.    
Talleyrand, astonished and irritated by these warlike preparations and  the enthusiasm of the infant country, wisely determined to withdraw with  grace while there was yet time. He sent a circuitous hint to President  Adams that an envoy from the United States would be received with proper  respect. For months Adams had been tormented with the vision of Hamilton  borne on the shoulders of a triumphant army straight to the Presidential  chair. His Cabinet were bitterly and uncompromisingly for war; Hamilton  had with difficulty restrained them in the past. Adams, without giving  them an inkling of his intention, sent to the Senate the name of William  Vans Murray, minister resident at The Hague, to confirm as envoy  extraordinary to France.    
For a moment the country was stupefied, so firm and uncompromising had  been the President's attitude hitherto. Then it arose in wrath, and his  popularity was gone for ever. As for the Federalist party, it divided  into two hostile factions, and neither had ever faced the Republicans  more bitterly. A third of the party supported the President; the rest  were for defeating him in the Senate, and humiliating him in every  possible way, as he had humiliated the country by kissing the  contemptuous hand of France the moment it was half extended.    
Hamilton was furious. He had been in mighty tempers in his life, but  this undignified and mortifying act of the President strained his  statesmanship to the utmost. It stood the strain, however; he warned  the Federalist leaders that the step taken was beyond recall and known  to all the world. There was nothing to do but to support the President.  He still had an opportunity for revenge while openly protecting the  honour of the Nation. Did Murray, a man of insufficient calibre and  prestige, go alone, he must fail; Adams would be disgraced; war  inevitable, with glory, and greater glory, for himself. But when  circumstances commanded his statesmanship, he ceased to be an  individual; personal resentments slumbered. He insisted that Murray be  but one of a commission, and Adams, now cooled and as disquieted as that  indomitable spirit could be, saw the wisdom of the advice; Oliver  Ellsworth and General Davie, conspicuous and influential men, were  despatched. Once more Hamilton had saved his party from immediate wreck;  but the strength which it had gathered during the war fever was  dissipated by the hostile camps into which it was divided, and by the  matchless opportunity which, in its brief period of numerical strength,  it had given to Thomas Jefferson.    
The Federalist party had ruled the country by virtue of the  preponderance of intellect and educated talents in its ranks, and the  masterly leadership of Alexander Hamilton. The Republican party numbered  few men of first-rate talents, but the upper grade of the Federalist was  set thick with distinguished patriots, all of them leaders, but all  deferring without question to the genius of their Captain. For years the  harmonious workings of their system, allied to the aggregate ability of  their personnel, and the watchful eye and resourceful mind of Hamilton,  the silent but sympathetic figure of Washington in the background, had  enabled them to win every hard-fought battle in spite of the often  superior numbers of the Opposition. That Jefferson was able in the face  of this victorious and discouraging army to form a great party out of  the rag-tag and bobtail element, animating his policy of  decentralization into a virile and indelible Americanism, proved him to  be a man of genius. History shows us few men so contemptible in  character, so low in tone; and no man has given his biographers so  difficult a task. But those who despise him most who oppose the most  determined front to the ultimates of his work, must acknowledge that  formational quality in his often dubious intellect which ranks him a man  of genius.    
His party was threatened with disorganization when the shameful conduct  of the France he adored united the country in a demand for vengeance,  and in admiration for the uncompromising attitude of the Government. Not  until the Federalists, carried away by the rapid recruiting to their  ranks, passed the Alien and Sedition laws, did Jefferson find ammunition  for his next campaign. As one reads those Resolutions to-day, one  wonders at the indiscretion of men who had kept the blood out of their  heads during so many precarious years. Three-quarters of a century later  the Chinese Exclusion Act became a law with insignificant protest; the  mistake of the Federalists lay in ignoring the fears and raging  jealousies of their time. If Hamilton realized at once that Jefferson  would be quick to seize upon their apparent unconstitutionality and  convert it into political capital, he seems to have stood alone,  although his protests resulted in the modification of both bills.    <blockquote>
 Let us not establish a tyranny! [he wrote to Wolcott]. Energy is a   very different thing from violence. If we make no false step we   shall be essentially united; but if we push things to an extreme,   we shall then give to faction body and solidity.</blockquote>    
In their modified form they were sufficiently menacing to democratic  ideals, and Jefferson could have asked for nothing better. He  immediately drafted his famous Kentucky Resolutions, and the obedient  Madison did a like service for Virginia. The Resolutions of Madison,  although containing all the seeds of nullification and secession, are  tame indeed compared with the performance of a man who, enveloped in the  friendly mists of anonymity, was as aggressive and valiant as Hamilton  on the warpath. These Resolutions protested against the  unconstitutionality of the Federal Government in exiling foreigners, and  curbing the liberty of the press, in arrogating to itself the rights of  the States, and assuming the prerogatives of an absolute monarchy. If  Jefferson did not advise nullification, he informed the States of their  inalienable rights, and counselled them to resist the centralizing  tendency of the Federal Government before it was too late. Even in the  somewhat modified form in which these Resolutions passed the Kentucky  legislature, and although rejected by the States to which they were  despatched, they created a sensation and accomplished their primary  object. The war excitement had threatened to shove the Alien and  Sedition laws beyond the range of the public observation. The Kentucky  and Virginia Resolutions roused the country, and sent the Republicans  scampering back to their watchful shepherd. It is one of the  master-strokes of political history, and Jefferson culled the fruits and  suffered none of the odium. That these historic Resolutions contained  the fecundating germs of the Civil War, is by the way.    
Such was the situation on the eve of 1800, the eve of a Presidential  election, and of the death struggle of the two great parties.    
It was in December of this year of 1799 that Hamilton bent under the  most crushing blow that life had dealt him. He was standing on the  street talking to Sedgwick, when a mounted courier dashed by, crying  that Washington was dead. The street was crowded, but Hamilton broke  down and wept bitterly. "America has lost her saviour," he said; "I, a  father."
