  McKay still had his mind on a certain stretch of timber that   reached out into the Barren Lands, hundreds of miles farther  north.  In this hiding place, three years before, he had built  himself a  cabin, and had caught foxes during half the long winter.  Not only the  cabin, but the foxes, were drawing him. Necessity was  close upon his  heels. What little money he possessed after leaving  Cragg's Ridge was  exhausted, his supplies were gone, and his boots  and clothes were  patched with deer hide. 
  In the Snowbird Lake country, a week after he left Cassidy in his   paradise at Wollaston, he fell in with good fortune. Two trappers  had  come in from Churchill. One of them was sick, and the other  needed  help in the building of their winter cabin. McKay remained  with them  for ten days, and when he continued his journey  northward his pack was  stuffed with supplies, and he wore new  boots and more comfortable  clothes. 
  It was the middle of October when he found his old cabin, a   thousand miles from Cragg's Ridge. It was as he had left it three   years ago. No one had opened its door since then. The little box   stove was waiting for a fire. Behind it was a pile of wood. On the   table were the old tin dishes, and hanging from babiche cords   fastened to the roof timbers, out of reach of mice and ermine,  were  blankets and clothing and other possessions he had left  behind him in  that winter break-up of what seemed like ages ago to  him. He raised a  small section in the floor, and there were his  traps, thickly coated  with caribou grease. For half an hour before  he built a fire he sought  eagerly for the things he had concealed  here and there. He found oil,  and a tin lamp, and candles, and as  darkness of the first night  gathered outside a roaring fire sent  sparks up the chimney, and the  little cabin's one window glowed  with light, and the battered old  coffee pot bubbled and steamed  again, as if rejoicing at his return. 
  With the breaking of another day he immediately began preparations   for the season's trapping. In two days' hunting he killed three   caribou, his winter meat. Then he cut wood, and made his  strychnine  poison baits, and marked out his trap-lines. 
  The first of November brought the chill whisperings of an early   winter through the Northland. Farther south autumn was dying, or   dead. The last of the red ash berries hung shriveled and frost-   bitten on naked twigs, freezing nights were nipping the face of  the  earth, the voices of the wilderness were filled with a new  note and  the winds held warning for every man and beast between  Hudson's Bay  and the Great Slave and from the Height of Land to  the Arctic Sea.  Seven years before there had come such a winter,  and the land had not  forgotten it&#8212;a winter sudden and swift,  deadly in its unexpectedness,  terrific in its cold, bringing with  it such famine and death as the  Northland had not known for two  generations. 
  But this year there was premonition. Omen of it came with the   first wailing night winds that bore the smell of icebergs from  over  the black forests north and west. The moon came up red, and  it went  down red, and the sun came up red in the morning. The  loon's call died  a month ahead of its time. The wild geese drove  steadily south when  they should have been feeding from the Kogatuk  to Baffin's Bay, and  the beaver built his walls thick, and  anchored his alders and his  willows deep so that he would not  starve when the ice grew heavy.  East, west, north and south, in  forest and swamp, in the trapper's  cabin and the wolf's hiding-  place, was warning of it. Gray rabbits  turned white. Moose and  caribou began to herd. The foxes yipped  shrilly in the night, and  a new hunger and a new thrill sent the  wolves hunting in packs,  while the gray geese streaked southward under  the red moon  overhead. 
  Through this November, and all of December, Jolly Roger and Peter   were busy from two hours before dawn of each day until late at  night.  The foxes were plentiful, and McKay was compelled to  shorten his lines  and put out fewer baits, and on the tenth of  December he set out for a  fur-trading post ninety miles south with  two hundred and forty skins.  He had made a toboggan, and a harness  for Peter, and pulling together  they made the trip in three days,  and on the fourth started for the  cabin again with supplies and  something over a thousand dollars in  cash. 
  Through the weeks of increasing storm and cold that followed,   McKay continued to trap, and early in February he made another  trip  to the fur post. 
  It was on their return that they were caught in the Black Storm.   It will be a long time before the northland will forget that  storm.  It was a storm in which the Sarcees died to a man, woman  and child  over on the Dubawnt waterways, and when trees froze  solid and split  open with the sharp explosions of high-power guns.  In it, all furred  and feathered life and all hoof and horn along  the edge of the Barren  Lands from Aberdeen Lake to the Coppermine  was swallowed up. It was in  this storm that streams froze solid,  and the man who was cautious  fastened a babiche rope about his  waist when he went forth from his  cabin for wood or water, so that  his wife might help to pull and guide  him back through that  blinding avalanche of wind and freezing fury  that held a twisted  and broken world in its grip. 
  In the country west of Artillery Lake and south of the Theolon   River, Jolly Roger and Peter were compelled to &quot;dig in.&quot; They were  in  a country where the biggest stick of wood that thrust itself up  out of  the snow was no bigger than McKay's thumb; a country of  green grass  and succulent moss on which the caribou fed in season,  but a hell on  earth when arctic storm howled and screamed across  it in winter. 
  Piled up against a mass of rock Jolly Roger found a huge snow   drift. This drift was as long as a church and half as high, with  its  outer shell blistered and battered to the hardness of rock by  wind and  sleet. Through this shell he cut a small door with his  knife, and  after that dug out the soft snow from within until he  had a room half  as big as his cabin, and so snug and warm after a  little with the body  heat of himself and Peter that he could throw  off the thick coat which  he wore. 
  To Peter, in the first night of this storm, it seemed as though   all the people in the world were shrieking and wailing and sobbing  in  the blackness outside. Jolly Roger sat smoking his pipe at  intervals  in the gloom, though there was little pleasure in  smoking a pipe in  darkness. The storm did not oppress him, but  filled him with an odd  sense of security and comfort. The wind  shrieked and lashed itself  about his snow-dune, but it could not  get at him. Its mightiest  efforts to destroy only beat more snow  upon him, and made him safer  and warmer. In a way, there was  something of humor as well as tragedy  in its wild frenzy, and  Peter heard him laugh softly in the darkness.  More and more  frequently he had heard that laugh since those warm days  of autumn  when they had last met the red-headed man, Terence Cassidy,  of the  Royal Northwest Mounted Police, and his master had shot him on  the  white shore of Wollaston. 
  &quot;You see,&quot; said McKay, caressing Peter's hairy neck in the gloom.   &quot;Everything is turning out right for us, and I'm beginning to  believe  more and more what Yellow Bird told us, and that in the  end we're  going to be happy&#8212;somewhere&#8212;with Nada. What do you  think, Pied-Bot?  Shall we take a chance, and go back to Cragg's  Ridge in the spring?&quot; 
  Peter wriggled himself in answer, as a wild shriek of wind wailed   over the huge snow-dune. 
  Jolly Roger's fingers tightened at Peter's neck. 
  &quot;Well, we're going,&quot; he said, as though he was telling Peter   something new. &quot;I'm believing Yellow Bird, Pied-Bot. I'm believing   her&#8212;now. What she told us was more than fortune-telling. It  wasn't  just Indian sorcery. When she shut herself up and starved  for those  three days and nights in her little conjurer's house,  just for you and  me&#8212;SOMETHING HAPPENED. Didn't it? Wouldn't you  say something  happened?&quot; 
  Peter swallowed and his teeth clicked as he gave evidence of   understanding. 
  &quot;She told us a lot of truth,&quot; went on Jolly Roger, with deep faith   in his voice &quot;And we must believe, Pied-Bot. She told us Cassidy  was  coming after us, and he came. She said the spirits promised  her the  law would never get us, and we thought it looked bad when  Cassidy had  us covered with his gun on the shore at Wollaston. But  something more  than luck was with us, and we shot him. Then we  brought him back to  life and lugged him to a cabin, and the little  stranger girl took him,  and nursed him, and Cassidy fell in love  with her&#8212;and married her. So  Yellow Bird was right again, Pied-  Bot. We've got to believe her. And  she says everything is coming  out right for us, and that we are going  back to Nada, and be  happy&#8212;&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's pipe-bowl glowed in the blackness. 
  &quot;I'm going to light the alcohol lamp,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't sleep.   And I want a good smoke. It isn't fun when you can't see the  smoke.  Too bad God forgot to make you so you could use a pipe,  Peter. You  don't know what you are missing&#8212;in times like these.&quot; 
  He fumbled in his pack and found the alcohol lamp, which was fresh   filled and screwed tight. Peter heard him working for a moment in  the  darkness. Then he struck a match, and the yellow flare of it  lighted  up his face. In his joy Peter whined. It was good to see  his master.  And then, in another moment, the little lamp was  filling their  white-walled refuge with a mellow glow. Jolly  Roger's eyes, coming  suddenly out of darkness, were wide and  staring. His face was covered  with a scrub beard. But there was  something of cheer about him even in  this night of terror outside,  and when he had driven his snowshoe into  the snow wall, and had  placed the lamp on it, he grinned companionably  at Peter. 
  Then, with a deep breath of satisfaction, he puffed out clouds of   smoke from his pipe, and stood up to look about their room. 
  &quot;Not so bad, is it?&quot; he asked. &quot;We could have a big house here if   we wanted to dig out rooms&#8212;eh, Peter? Parlors, and bed-rooms, and  a  library&#8212;and not a policeman within a million miles of us.  That's the  nice part of it, PIED-BOT&#8212;none of the Royal Mounties  to trouble us.  They would never think of looking for us in the  heart of a big  snow-dune out in this God-forsaken barren, would  they?&quot; 
  The thought was a pleasing one to Jolly Roger. He spread out his   blankets on the snow floor, and sat down on them, facing Peter. 
  &quot;We've got 'em beat,&quot; he said, a chuckling note of pride in his   voice. &quot;The world is small when it comes to hiding, Pied-Bot, but  all  the people in it couldn't find us here&#8212;not in a million  years. If we  could only find a place as safe as this&#8212;where a girl  could live&#8212;and  had Nada with us&#8212;&quot; 
  Many times during the past few weeks Peter had seen the light that   flamed up now in his master's eyes. That, and the strange thrill  in  Jolly Roger's voice, stirred him more than the words to which  he  listened, and tried to understand. 
  &quot;And we're GOING to,&quot; finished McKay, almost fiercely, his hands   clenching as he leaned toward Peter. &quot;We have made a big mistake,   Pied-Bot, and it has taken us a long time to see it. It will be  hard  for us to leave our north country, but that is what we must  do. Maybe  Yellow Bird's good spirits meant that when they said we  would find  happiness with Nada in a place called The Country  Beyond. There are a  lot of 'Countries Beyond,' Peter, and as soon  as the spring break-up  comes and we can travel without leaving  trails behind us we will go  back to Cragg's Ridge and get Nada,  and hit for some place where the  law won't expect to find us.  There's China, for instance. A lot of  yellow people. But what do  we care for color as long as we have her  with us? I say&#8212;&quot; 
  Suddenly he stopped. And Peter's body grew tense. Both faced the   round hole, half filled with softly packed snow, which McKay had  cut  as a door into the heart of the big drift. They had grown  accustomed  to the tumult of the storm. Its strange wailings and  the shrieking  voices which at times seemed borne in the moaning  sweep of it no  longer sent shivers of apprehension through Peter.  But in that moment  when both turned to listen there came a sound  which was not like the  other sounds they had heard. It was a  voice&#8212;not one of the phantom  voices of the screaming wind, but a  voice so real and so near that for  a beat or two even Jolly Roger  McKay's heart stood still. It was as if  a man, standing just  beyond their snow barricade, had shouted a name.  But there came no  second call. The wind lulled, so that for a space  there was  stillness outside. 
  Jolly Roger laughed a little uneasily. 
  &quot;Good thing we don't believe in ghosts, Peter, or we would swear   it was a Loup-Garou smelling us through the wall!&quot; He thumbed the   tobacco down in his pine, and nodded. &quot;Then&#8212;there is South  America,&quot;  he said. &quot;They have everything down there&#8212;the biggest  rivers in the  world, the biggest mountains, and so much room that  even a Loup-Garou  couldn't hunt us out. She will love it, Pied-  Bot. But if it happens  she likes Africa better, or Australia, or  the South Sea&#8212;Now, what the  devil was that?&quot; 
  Peter had jumped as if stung, and for a moment Jolly Roger sat   tense as a carven Indian. Then he rose to his feet, a look of   perplexity and doubt in his eyes. 
  &quot;What was it, Peter? Can the wind shoot a gun&#8212;like THAT?&quot; 
  Peter was sniffing at the loosely blocked door of their snow-room.   A whimper rose in his throat. He looked up at Jolly Roger, his  eyes  glowing fiercely through the mass of Airedale whiskers that  covered  his face. He wanted to dig. He wanted to plunge out into  the howling  darkness. Slowly McKay beat the ash out of his pipe  and placed the  pipe in his pocket. 
  &quot;We'll take a look,&quot; he said, something repressive in his voice.   &quot;But it isn't reasonable, Peter. It is the wind. There couldn't be  a  man out there, and it wasn't a rifle we heard. It is the wind&#8212;  with  the devil himself behind it!&quot; 
  With a few sweeps of his hands and arms he scooped out the loose   snow from the hole. The opening was on the sheltered side of the   drift, and only the whirling eddies of the storm swept about him  as  he thrust out his head and shoulders. But over him it was  rushing like  an avalanche. He could hear nothing but the moaning  advance of it. And  he could see nothing. He held out his hand  before his face, and  blackness swallowed it. 
  &quot;We have been chased so much that we're what you might call super-   sensitive,&quot; he said, pulling himself back and nodding at Peter in  the  gray light of the alcohol lamp. &quot;Guess we'd better turn in,  boy. This  is a good place to sleep&#8212;plenty of fresh air, no  mosquitoes or black  flies, and the police so far away that we will  soon forget how they  look. If you say so we will have a nip of  cold tea and a bite&#8212;&quot; 
  He did not finish. For a moment the wind had lessened in fury, as   if gathering a deeper breath. And what he heard drew a cry from  him  this time, and a sharper whine from Peter. Out of the  blackness of the  night had come a woman's voice! In that first  instant of shock and  amazement he would have staked his life that  what he heard was not a  mad outcry of the night or an illusion of  his brain. It was  clear&#8212;distinct&#8212;a woman's voice coming from out  on the Barren, rising  above the storm in an agony of appeal, and  dying out quickly until it  became a part of the moaning wind. And  then, with equal force, came  the absurdity of it to McKay. A  woman! He swallowed the lump that had  risen in his throat, and  tried to laugh. A WOMAN&#8212;out in that storm&#8212;a  thousand miles from  nowhere! It was inconceivable. 
  The laugh which he forced from his lips was husky and unreal, and   there was a smothering grip of something at his heart. In the  ghostly  light of the alcohol lamp his eyes were wide open and  staring. 
  He looked at Peter. The dog stood stiff-legged before the hole.   His body was trembling. 
  &quot;Peter!&quot; 
  With a responsive wag of his tail Peter turned his bristling face   up to his master. Many times Jolly Roger had seen that unfailing   warning in his comrade's eyes. THERE WAS SOME ONE OUTSIDE&#8212;or  Peter's  brain, like his own, was twisted and fooled by the storm! 
  Against his reasoning&#8212;in the face of the absurdity of it&#8212;Jolly   Roger was urged into action. He changed the snowshoe and replaced  the  alcohol lamp so that the glow of light could be seen more  clearly from  the Barren. Then he went to the hole and crawled  through. Peter  followed him. 
  As if infuriated by their audacity, the storm lashed itself over   the top of the dune. They could hear the hissing whine of fine  hard  snow tearing above their heads like volleys of shot, and the  force of  the wind reached them even in their shelter, bringing  with it the  flinty sting of the snow-dust. Beyond them the black  barren was filled  with a dismal moaning. Looking up, and yet  seeing nothing in the  darkness, Peter understood where the weird  shriekings and ghostly  cries came from. It was the wind whipping  itself up the side and over  the top of the dune. 
  Jolly Roger listened, hearing only the convulsive sweep of that   mighty force over a thousand miles of barren. And then came again  one  of those brief intervals when the storm seemed to rest for a  moment,  and its moaning grew less and less, until it was like the  sound of  giant chariot wheels receding swiftly over the face of  the earth. Then  came the silence&#8212;a few seconds of it&#8212;while in  the north gathered  swiftly the whispering rumble of a still  greater force. 
  And in this silence came once more a cry&#8212;a cry which Jolly Roger   McKay could no longer disbelieve, and close upon the cry the  report  of a rifle. Again he could have sworn the voice was a  woman's voice.  As nearly as he could judge it came from dead  ahead, out of the chaos  of blackness, and in that direction he  shouted an answer. Then he ran  out into the darkness, followed by  Peter. Another avalanche of wind  gathered at their heels, driving  them on like the crest of a flood. In  the first force of it Jolly  Roger stumbled and fell to his knees, and  in that moment he saw  very faintly the glow of his light at the  opening in the snow  dune. A realization of his deadly peril if he lost  sight of the  light flashed upon him. Again and again he called into  the night.  After that, bowing his head in the fury of the storm, he  plunged  on deeper into darkness. 
  A sudden wild thought seized upon his soul and thrilled him into   forgetfulness of the light and the snow-dune and his own safety.  In  the heart of this mad world he had heard a voice. He no longer  doubted  it. And the voice was a woman's voice! Could it be Nada?  Was it  possible she had followed him after his flight, determined  to find  him, and share his fate? His heart pounded. Who else, of  all the women  in the world, could be following his trail across  the Barrens&#8212;a  thousand miles from civilization? He began to shout  her name.  &quot;Nada&#8212;Nada&#8212;Nada!&quot; And hidden in the gloom at his side  Peter barked. 
  Storm and darkness swallowed them. The last faint gleam of the   alcohol lamp died out. Jolly Roger did not look back. Blindly he   stumbled ahead, counting his footsteps as he went, and shouting   Nada's name. Twice he thought he heard a reply, and each time the   will-o'-the-wisp voice seemed to be still farther ahead of him.  Then,  with a fiercer blast of the wind beating upon his back, he  stumbled  and fell forward upon his face. His hand reached out and  touched the  thing that had tripped him. It was not snow. His naked  fingers  clutched in something soft and furry. It was a man's coat.  He could  feel buttons, a belt, and the sudden thrill of a bearded  face. 
  He stood up. The wind was wailing off over the Barren again,   leaving an instant of stillness about him. And he shouted: 
  &quot;Nada&#8212;Nada&#8212;Nada!&quot; 
  An answer came so quickly that it startled him, not one voice, but   two&#8212;three&#8212;and one of them the shrill agonized cry of a woman.  They  came toward him as he continued to shout, until a few feet  away he  could make out a gray blur moving through the gloom. He  went to it,  staggering under the weight of the man he had found in  the snow. The  blur was made up of two men dragging a sledge, and  behind the sledge  was a third figure, moaning in the darkness. 
  &quot;I found some one in the snow,&quot; Jolly Roger shouted. &quot;Here he is&#8212;   &quot; 
  He dropped his burden, and the last of his words were twisted by a   fresh blast of the storm. But the figure behind the sledge had  heard,  and Jolly Roger saw her indistinctly at his feet, shielding  the man he  had found with her arms and body, and crying out a name  which he could  not understand in that howling of the wind. But a  thing like cold  steel sank into his heart, and he knew it was not  Nada he had found  this night on the Barren. He placed the  unconscious man on the sledge,  believing he was dead. The girl was  crying out something to him,  unintelligible in the storm, and one  of the men shouted in a thick  throaty voice which he could not  understand. Jolly Roger felt the  weight of him as he staggered in  the wind, fighting to keep his feet,  and he knew he was ready to  drop down in the snow and die. 
  &quot;It's only a step,&quot; he shouted. &quot;Can you make it?&quot; 
  His words reached the ears of the others. The girl swayed through   the darkness and gripped his arm. The two men began to tug at the   sledge, and Jolly Roger seized the rope between them, wondering  why  there were no dogs, and faced the driving of the storm. It  seemed an  interminable time before he saw the faint glow of the  alcohol lamp.  The last fifty feet was like struggling against an  irresistible hail  from machine-guns. Then came the shelter of the  dune. 
  One at a time McKay helped to drag them through the hole which he   used for a door. For a space his vision was blurred, and he saw   through the hazy film of storm-blindness the gray faces and  heavily  coated forms of those he had rescued. The man he had found  in the snow  he placed on his blankets, and the girl fell down upon  her knees  beside him. It was then Jolly Roger began to see more  clearly. And in  that same instant came a shock as unexpected as  the smash of dynamite  under his feet. 
  The girl had thrown back her parkee, and was sobbing over the man   on the blankets, and calling him father. She was not like Nada.  Her  hair was in thick, dark coils, and she was older. She was not   pretty&#8212;now. Her face was twisted by the brutal beating of the  storm,  and her eyes were nearly closed. But it was the man Jolly  Roger stared  at, while his heart choked inside him. He was  grizzled and  gray-bearded, with military mustaches and a bald  head. He was not  dead. His eyes were open, and his blue lips were  struggling to speak  to the girl whose blindness kept her from  seeing that he was alive.  And the coat which he wore was the  regulation service garment of the  Royal Northwest Mounted Police! 
  Slowly McKay turned, wiping the film of snow-sweat from his eyes,   and stared at the other two. One of them had sunk down with his  back  to the snow wall. He was a much younger man, possibly not  over thirty,  and his face was ghastly. The third lay where he had  fallen from  exhaustion after crawling through the hole. Both wore  service coats,  with holsters at their sides. 
  The man against the snow-wall was making an effort to rise. He   sagged back, and grinned up apologetically at McKay. 
  &quot;Dam' fine of you, old man,&quot; he mumbled between blistered lips.   &quot;I'm Porter&#8212;'N' Division&#8212;taking Superintendent Tavish to Fort   Churchill&#8212;Tavish and his daughter. Made a hell of a mess of it,   haven't I?&quot; 
  He struggled to his knees. 
  &quot;There's brandy in our kit. It might help&#8212;over there,&quot; and he   nodded toward the girl and the gray-bearded man on the blankets.
