The sky is gray as gray may be,<br> There is no bird upon the bough,<br> There is no leaf on vine or tree. 
In the Neponset marshes now<br> Willow-stems, rosy in the wind,<br> Shiver with hidden sense of snow. 
So too 'tis winter in my mind,<br> No light-winged fancy comes and stays:<br> A season churlish and unkind. 
Slow creep the hours, slow creep the days,<br> The black ink crusts upon the pen--<br> Just wait till bluebirds, wrens, and jays<br> And golden orioles come again!
