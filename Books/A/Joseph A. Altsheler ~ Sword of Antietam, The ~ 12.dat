  Dick's horse had had a good rest, and he was fighting for his head  before they were clear of the outskirts of Pendleton. When the road  emerged once more into the deep woods the boy gave him the rein. It was  well past midnight now, and he wished to reach the army before dawn.
  Soon the great horse was galloping, and Dick felt exhilaration as  the cool air of early October rushed past. The heat in both east and  west had been so long and intense, that year, that the coming of autumn  was full of tonic. Yet the uncommon dryness, the least rainy summer and  autumn in two generations, still prevailed. The hoofs of Dick's horse  left a cloud of dust behind him. The leaves of the trees were falling  already, rustling dryly as they fell. Brooks that were old friends of  his and that he had never known to go dry before were merely chains of  yellow pools in a shallow bed.
  He watered his horse at one or two of the creeks that still flowed  in good volume, and then went on again, sometimes at a gallop. He  passed but one horseman, a farmer who evidently had taken an unusually  early start for a mill, as a sack of corn lay across his saddle behind  him. Dick nodded but the farmer stared open-mouthed at the youth in the  blue uniform who flew past him.
  Dick never looked back and by dawn he was with the army. He found  Colonel Winchester taking breakfast under the thin shade of an oak, and  joined him.
  &#8220;What did you find, Dick?&#8221; asked the colonel, striving to hide the  note of anxiety in his voice.
  &#8220;I found all right at the house, but I did not see mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;What had become of her?&#8221;
  &#8220;I learned from a friend that in order to be out of the path of the  army or of prowling bands she had gone to relatives of ours in  Danville. Then I came away.&#8221;
  &#8220;She did well,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;The rebels are  concentrating about Lexington, but the battle, I think, will take place  far south of that city.&#8221;
  Before the day was old they heard news that changed their opinion  for the time at least. A scout brought news that a division of the  Confederate army was much nearer than Lexington; in fact, that it was  at Frankfort, the capital of the state. And the news was heightened in  interest by the statement that the division was there to assist in the  inauguration of a Confederate government of the state, so little of  which the Confederate army held.
  Colonel Winchester at once applied to General Buell for permission  for a few officers like himself, natives of Kentucky and familiar with  the region, to ride forward and see what the enemy was really doing.  Dick was present at the interview and it was characteristic.
  &#8220;If you leave, what of your regiment, Colonel Winchester?&#8221; said  General Buell.
  &#8220;I shall certainly rejoin it in time for battle.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose the enemy should prevent you?&#8221;
  &#8220;He cannot do so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I remember you at Shiloh. You did good work there.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;And this lad, Lieutenant Mason, he has also done well. But he is  young.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can vouch for him, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then take twenty of your bravest and most intelligent men and ride  toward Frankfort. It may be that we shall have to take a part in this  inauguration, which I hear is scheduled for to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may be so, sir,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, returning General  Buell's grim smile. Then he and Dick saluted and withdrew.
  But it did not take the colonel long to make his preparations. Among  his twenty men all were natives of Kentucky except Warner, Pennington  and Sergeant Whitley. Two were from Frankfort itself, and they were  confident that they could approach through the hills with comparative  security, the little capital nestling in its little valley.
  They rode rapidly and by nightfall drew near to the rough Benson  Hills, which suddenly shooting up in a beautiful rolling country, hem  in the capital. Although it was now the third day of October the little  party marked anew the extreme dryness and the shrunken condition of  everything. It was all the more remarkable as no region in the world is  better watered than Kentucky, with many great rivers, more small ones,  and innumerable creeks and brooks. There are few points in the state  where a man can be more than a mile from running water.
  The dryness impressed Dick. They had dust here, as they had had it  in Virginia, but there it was trampled up by great armies. Here it was  raised by their own little party, and as the October winds swept across  the dry fields it filled their eyes with particles. Yet it was one of  the finest regions of the world, underlaid with vitalizing limestone, a  land where the grass grows thick and long and does not die even in  winter.
  &#8220;If one were superstitious,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;he could think it was a  punishment sent upon us all for fighting so much, and for killing so  many men about questions that lots of us don't understand, and that at  least could have been settled in some other way.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's easy enough to imagine it so,&#8221; said Warner in his precise way,  &#8220;but after all, despite the reasons against it, here we are fighting  and killing one another with a persistence that has never been  surpassed. It's a perfectly simple question in mathematics. Let x equal  the anger of the South, let y equal the anger of the North, let 10  equal the percentage of reason, 100, of course, being the whole, then  you have x + y + 10 equalling 100. The anger of the two sections is  consequently x + y, equalling 100&#8212;10, or 90. When anger constitutes 90  per cent., what chance has reason, which is only 10 per cent., or  one-ninth of anger?&#8221;
  &#8220;No chance at all,&#8221; replied Dick. &#8220;That has already been proved  without the aid of algebra. Here is a man in a cornfield signaling to  us. I wonder what he wants?&#8221;
  As Dick spoke, Colonel Winchester, who had already noticed the man,  gave an order to stop. The stranger, bent and knotted by hard work on  the farm, hurried toward them. He leaned against the fence a moment,  gasping for breath, and then said:
  &#8220;You're Union men, ain't you? It's no disguise?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Colonel Winchester, &#8220;we're Union men, and it's no  disguise that we're wearing, Malachi White. I've seen you several times  in Frankfort, selling hay.&#8221;
  The farmer, who had climbed upon the fence and who was sitting on  the top rail, hands on his knees, stared at him open-mouthed.
  &#8220;You've got my name right. Malachi White it is,&#8221; he said, &#8220;suah  enough, but I don't know yours. 'Pears to me, however, that they's  somethin' familiar about you. Mebbe it's the way you throw back your  shoulders an' look a fellow squah in the eyes.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester smiled. No man is insensible to a compliment  which is obviously spontaneous.
  &#8220;I spent a night once at your house, Mr. White,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was  going to Frankfort on horseback. I was overtaken at dusk by a storm and  I reached your place just in time. I remember that I slept on a mighty  soft feather bed, and ate a splendid breakfast in the morning.&#8221;
  Malachi White was not insensible to compliments either. He smiled,  and the smile which merely showed his middle front teeth at first,  gradually broadened until it showed all of them. Then it rippled and  stretched in little waves, until it stopped somewhere near his ears.  Dick regarded him with delight. It was the broadest and finest smile  that he had seen in many a long month.
  &#8220;Now I know you,&#8221; said Malachi White, looking intently at the  colonel. &#8220;I ain't as strong on faces as some people, though I reckon  I'm right strong on 'em, too, but I'm pow'ful strong on recollectin'  hear'in', that is, the voice and the trick of it. It was fo' yea's ago  when you stopped at my house. You had a curious trick of pronouncin'  r's when they wasn't no r's. You'd say door, an' hour, when ev'body  knowed it was doah, an' houah, but I don't hold it ag'in you fo' not  knowin' how to pronounce them wo'ds. Yoh name is Ahthuh Winchestuh.&#8221;
  &#8220;As right as right can be,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, reaching over  and giving him a hearty hand. &#8220;I'm a colonel in the Union army now, and  these are my officers and men. What was it you wanted to tell us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not to ride on fuhthah. It ain't mo' than fifteen miles to  Frankfort. The place is plum full of the Johnnies. I seed 'em thah  myself. Ki'by Smith, an' a sma't gen'ral he is, too, is thah, an' so's  Bragg, who I don't know much 'bout. They's as thick as black be'ies in  a patch, an' they's all gettin ready fo' a gran' ma'ch an' display  to-mo'ow when they sweah in the new Southe'n gove'nuh, Mistah Hawes.  They've got out scouts, too, colonel, an' if you go on you'll run right  squah into 'em an' be took, which I allow you don't want to happen,  nohow.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, Malachi, I don't, nor do any of us, but we're going on and we  don't mean to be taken. Most of the men know this country well. Two of  them, in fact, were born in Frankfort.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then mebbe you kin look out fo' yo'selves, bein' as you are  Kentuckians. I'm mighty strong fo' the Union myself, but a lot of them  officers that came down from the no'th 'pear to tu'n into pow'ful fools  when they git away from home, knowin' nothin' 'bout the country, an'  not willin' to lea'n. Always walkin' into traps. I guess they've nevah  missed a single trap the rebels have planted. Sometimes I've been so  mad 'bout it that I've felt like quittin' bein' a Yank an' tu'nin' to a  Johnny. But somehow I've nevah been able to make up my mind to go ag'in  my principles. Is Gen'ral Grant leadin' you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, General Buell.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm so'y of that. Gen'ral Buell, f'om all I heah, is a good  fightah, but slow. Liable to git thar, an' hit like all ta'nation, when  it's a little mite too late. He's one of ouah own Kentuckians, an' I  won't say anything ag'in him; not a wo'd, colonel, don't think that,  but I've been pow'ful took with this fellow Grant. I ain't any sojah,  myself, but I like the tales I heah 'bout him. When a fellow hits him  he hits back ha'dah, then the fellow comes back with anothah ha'dah  still, an' then Grant up an' hits him a wallop that you heah a mile,  an' so on an' so on.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're right, Malachi. I was with him at Donelson and Shiloh and  that's the way he did.&#8221;
  &#8220;I reckon it's the right way. Is it true, colonel, that he taps the  ba'el?&#8221;
  &#8220;Taps the barrel? What do you mean, Malachi?&#8221;
  White put his hands hollowed out like a scoop to his mouth and  turned up his face.
  &#8220;I see,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, &#8220;and I'm glad to say no, Malachi.  If he takes anything he takes water just like the rest of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Pow'ful glad to heah it, but it ain't easy to get too much good  watah this yeah. Nevah knowed such a dry season befoah, an' I was  fifty-two yeahs old, three weeks an' one day ago yestuhday.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Malachi, for your warning. We'll be doubly careful,  because of it, and I hope after this war is over to share your fine  hospitality once more.&#8221;
  &#8220;You'll sho'ly be welcome an' ev'y man an' boy with you will be  welcome, too. Fuhthah on, 'bout foah hund'ed yahds, you'll come to a  path leadin' into the woods. You take that path, colonel. It'll be  sundown soon, an' you follow it th'ough the night.&#8221;
  The two men shook hands again, and then the soldiers rode on at a  brisk trot. Malachi White sat on the fence, looking at them from under  the brim of his old straw hat, until they came to the path that he had  indicated and disappeared in the woods. Then he sighed and walked back  slowly to his house in the cornfield. Malachi White had no education,  but he had much judgment and he was a philosopher.
  But Dick and the others rode on through the forest, penetrating into  the high and rough hills which were sparsely inhabited. The nights, as  it was now October, were cool, despite the heat and dust of the day,  and they rode in a grateful silence. It was more than an hour after  dark when Powell, one of the Frankforters, spoke:
  &#8220;We can hit the old town by midnight easy enough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unless  they've stretched pretty wide lines of pickets I can lead you, sir,  within four hundred yards of Frankfort, where you can stay under cover  yourself and look right down into it. I guess by this good moonlight I  could point out old Bragg himself, if he should be up and walking  around the streets.&#8221;
  &#8220;That suits us, Powell,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;You and May lead  the way.&#8221;
  May was the other Frankforter and they took the task eagerly. They  were about to look down upon home after an absence of more than a year,  a year that was more than a normal ten. They were both young, not over  twenty, and after a while they turned out of the path and led into the  deep woods.
  &#8220;It's open forest through here, no underbrush, colonel,&#8221; said  Powell, &#8220;and it makes easy riding. Besides, about a mile on there's a  creek running down to the Kentucky that will have deep water in it, no  matter how dry the season has been. Tom May and I have swum in it many  a time, and I reckon our horses need water, colonel.&#8221;
  &#8220;So they do, and so do we. We'll stop a bit at this creek of yours,  Powell.&#8221;
  The creek was all that the two Frankfort lads had claimed for it. It  was two feet deep, clear, cold and swift, shadowed by great primeval  trees. Men and horses drank eagerly, and at last Colonel Winchester,  feeling that there was neither danger nor the need of hurry, permitted  them to undress and take a quick bath, which was a heavenly relief and  stimulant, allowing them to get clear of the dust and dirt of the day.
  &#8220;It's a beauty of a creek,&#8221; said Powell to Dick. &#8220;About a half mile  further down the stream is a tremendous tree on which is cut with a  penknife, 'Dan'l Boone killed a bar here, June 26, 1781.' I found it  myself, and I cut away enough of the bark growth with a penknife for it  to show clearly. I imagine the great Daniel and Simon Kenton and Harrod  and the rest killed lots of bears in these hills.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd go and see that inscription in the morning,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;if I  didn't have a bit of war on my hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe you'll have a chance later on. But I'm feeling bully after  this cold bath. Dick, I came into the creek weighing two hundred and  twenty-five pounds, one hundred and fifty pounds of human being and  seventy-five pounds of dust and dirt. I'm back to one hundred and fifty  now. Besides, I was fifty years old when I entered the stream, and I've  returned to twenty.&#8221;
  &#8220;That just about describes me, too, but the colonel is whistling for  us to come. Rush your jacket on and jump for your horse.&#8221;
  They had stayed about a half-hour at the creek, and about two  o'clock in the morning Powell and May led them through a dense wood to  the edge of a high hill.
  &#8220;There's Frankfort below you,&#8221; said May in a voice that trembled.
  The night was brilliant, almost like day, and they saw the little  city clustered along the banks of the Kentucky which flowed, a dark  ribbon of blue. Their powerful glasses brought out everything  distinctly. They saw the old state house, its trees, and in the open  spaces, tents standing by the dozens and scores. It was the division of  Kirby Smith that occupied the town, and Bragg himself had made a  triumphant entry. Dick wondered which house sheltered him. It was  undoubtedly that of some prominent citizen, proud of the honor.
  &#8220;Isn't it the snuggest and sweetest little place you ever saw?&#8221; said  May. &#8220;Lend me your glasses a minute, please, Dick.&#8221;
  Dick handed them to him, and May took a long look, Dick noticed that  the glasses remained directed toward a house among some trees near the  river.
  &#8220;You're looking at your home, are you not?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;I surely am. It's that cottage among the oaks. It's bigger than it  looks from here. Front porch and back porch, too. You go from the back  porch straight down to the river. I've swum across the Kentucky there  at night many and many a time. My father and mother are sure to be  there now, staying inside with the doors closed, because they're red  hot for the Union. Farther up the street, the low red brick house with  the iron fence around the yard is Jim Powell's home. You don't mind  letting Jim have a look through the glasses, do you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course not.&#8221;
  The glasses were handed in turn to Powell, who, as May had done,  took a long, long look. He made no comment, when he gave the glasses  back to Dick, merely saying: &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; But Dick knew that Powell was  deeply moved.
  &#8220;It may be, lads,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, &#8220;that you will be able  to enter your homes by the front doors in a day or two. Evidently the  Southerners intend to make it a big day to-morrow when they inaugurate  Hawes, their governor.&#8221;
  &#8220;A governor who's a governor only when he is surrounded by an army,  won't be much of a governor,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;This state refused to  secede, and I guess that stands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Beyond a doubt it does,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, &#8220;but they've made  great preparations, nevertheless. There are Confederate flags on the  Capitol and the buildings back of it, and I see scaffolding for seats  outside. Are there other places from which we can get good looks,  lads?&#8221;
  &#8220;Plenty of them,&#8221; May and Powell responded together, and they led  them from hill to hill, all covered with dense forest. Several times  they saw Southern sentinels on the slopes near the edge of the woods,  but May and Powell knew the ground so thoroughly that they were always  able to keep the little troop under cover without interfering with  their own scouting operations.
  Buell had given final instructions to the colonel to come back with  all the information possible, and, led by his capable guides, the  colonel used his opportunities to the utmost. He made a half circle  about Frankfort, going to the river, and then back again. With the aid  of the glasses and the brilliancy of the night he was able to see that  the division of Kirby Smith was not strong enough to hold the town  under any circumstances, if the main Union army under Buell came up,  and the colonel was resolved that it should come.
  It was a singular coincidence that the Southerners were making a  military occupation of Frankfort with a Union army only a day's march  away. The colonel found a certain grim irony in it as he took his last  look and turned away to join Buell.
  A half mile into the forest and they heard the crashing of hoofs in  the brushwood. Colonel Winchester drew up his little troop abruptly as  a band of men in gray emerged into an open space.
  &#8220;Confederate cavalry!&#8221; exclaimed Dick.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the colonel.
  But the gray troopers were not much more numerous than the blue.  Evidently they were a scouting party, too, and for a few minutes they  stared at each other across a space of a couple of hundred yards or so.  Both parties fired a few random rifle shots, more from a sense of duty  than a desire to harm. Then they fell away, as if by mutual consent,  the gray riding toward Frankfort and the blue toward the Union army.
  &#8220;Was it a misfortune to meet them?&#8221; asked Dick.
  &#8220;I don't think so,&#8221; replied Colonel Winchester. &#8220;They had probably  found out already that our army was near. Of course they had out  scouts. Kirby Smith, I know, is an alert man, and anyway, the march of  an army as large as ours could not be hidden.&#8221;
  It was dawn again when the colonel's little party reached the Union  camp, and when he made his report the heavy columns advanced at once.  But the alarm had already spread about at Frankfort. The morning there  looked upon a scene even more lively than the one that had occurred in  Buell's camp. The scouts brought in the news that the Union army in  great force was at hand. They had met some of their cavalry patrols in  the night, on the very edge of the city. Resistance to the great Union  force was out of the question, because Bragg had committed the error  that the Union generals had been committing so often in the east. He  had been dividing and scattering his forces so much that he could not  now concentrate them and fight at the point where they were needed  most.
  The division of the Southern army that occupied Frankfort hastily  gathered up its arms and supplies and departed, taking with it the  governor who was never inaugurated, and soon afterward the Union men  marched in. Both May and Powell had the satisfaction of entering their  homes by the front doors, and seeing the parents who did not know until  then whether they were dead or alive.
  Dick had a few hours' leave and he walked about the town. He had  made friends when he was there in the course of that memorable struggle  over secession, and he saw again all of them who had not gone to the  war.
  Harry and his father were much present in his mind then, because he  had recently seen Colonel Kenton, and because the year before, all  three of them had talked together in these very places.
  But he could not dwell too much in the past. He was too young for  it, and the bustle of war was too great. It was said that Bragg's  forces had turned toward the southeast, but were still divided. It was  reported that the Bishop-General, Polk, had been ordered to attack the  Northern force in or near Frankfort, but the attack did not come.  Colonel Winchester said it was because Polk recognized the superior  strength of his enemy, and was waiting until he could co-operate with  Bragg and Hardee.
  But whatever it was Dick soon found himself leaving Frankfort and  marching into the heart of the Bluegrass. He began to have the feeling,  or rather instinct warned him, that battle was near. Yet he did not  fear for the Northern army as he had feared in Virginia and Maryland.  He never felt that such men as Lee and Jackson were before them. He  felt instead that the Southern commanders were doubtful and hesitating.  They now had there no such leaders as Albert Sidney Johnston, who fell  at Shiloh when victory was in Southern hands and before it had time to  slip from their grasp.
  So the army dropped slowly down eastward and southward through the  Bluegrass. May and Powell had obtained but a brief glimpse of their  home town, before they were on their way again with a purpose which had  little to do with such peaceful things as home.
  Dick saw with dismay that the concentric march of the armies was  bringing them toward the very region into which his mother had fled for  refuge. She was at Danville, which is in the county of Boyle, and he  heard now that the Confederate army, or at least a large division of  it, was gathering at a group of splendid springs near a village called  Perryville in the same county. But second thought told him that she  would be safe yet in Danville, as he began to feel sure now that the  meeting of the armies would be at Perryville.
  Dick's certainty grew out of the fact that the great springs were  about Perryville. The extraordinary drouth and the remarkable  phenomenon of brooks drying up in Kentucky had continued. Water, cool  and fresh for many thousands of men, was wanted or typhoid would come.
  This need of vast quantities of water fresh and cool from the earth,  was obvious to everybody, and the men marched gladly toward the  springs. The march would serve two purposes: it would quench their  thirst, and it would bring on the battle they wanted to clear Kentucky  of the enemy.
  &#8220;Fine country, this of yours, Dick,&#8221; said Warner as they rode side  by side. &#8220;I don't think I ever saw dust of a higher quality. It sifts  through everything, fills your eyes, nose and mouth and then goes down  under your collar and gives you a neat and continuous dust bath.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mustn't judge us by this phenomenon,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;It has not  happened before since the white man came, and it won't happen again in  a hundred years.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may speak with certainty of the past, Dickie, my lad, but I  don't think we can tell much about the next century. I'll grant the  fact, however, that fifty or a hundred thousand men marching through a  dry country anywhere are likely to raise a lot of dust. Still, Dickie,  my boy, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but if I live through this,  as I mean to do, I intend to call it the Dusty Campaign.&#8221;
  &#8220;Call it what you like if in the end you call it victory.&#8221;
  &#8220;The dust doesn't hurt me,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;I've seen it as dry as  a bone on the plains with great clouds of it rolling away behind the  buffalo herds. There's nothing the matter with dust. Country dust is  one of the cleanest things in the world.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;but it tickles and makes you hot. I  should say that despite its cleanly qualities, of which you speak,  Frank, my friend, its power to annoy is unsurpassed. Remember that bath  we took in the creek the night we went to Frankfort. Did you ever  before see such cool running water, and Dickie, old boy, remember how  much there was of it! It was just as deep and cool and fine after we  left it.&#8221;
  &#8220;George,&#8221; said Dick, as he wiped his dusty face, &#8220;if you say  anything more about the creek and its cool water this army will lose a  capable lieutenant, and it will lose him mighty soon. It will be  necessary, too, to bury him very far from his home in Vermont.&#8221;
  &#8220;Keep cool, Dickie boy, and let who will be dusty. Brooks may fail  once in a hundred years in Kentucky, but they haven't failed in a  thousand in Vermont. You need not remind me that the white man has been  there only two or three hundred years. My information comes straight  from a very old Indian chief who was the depository of tribal  recollections absolutely unassailable. The streams even in midsummer  come down as full and cold as ever from the mountains.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll have water and plenty of it in a day or two. The scouts say  that the Confederate force at the springs is not strong enough to  withstand us.&#8221;
  &#8220;But General Buell, not knowing exactly what General Bragg intends  with his divided force, has divided his own in order to meet him at all  points.&#8221;
  &#8220;Has he done that?&#8221; exclaimed Dick aghast. Like other young officers  he felt perfectly competent to criticize anybody.
  &#8220;He has, and it seems to me that when the enemy divided was the time  for us to unite or remain united. Then we could scoop him up in detail.  Why, Dick, with an army of sixty thousand men or so, made of such  material as ours has shown itself to be, we could surely beat any  Southern force in Kentucky!&#8221;
  &#8220;Especially as we have no Lees and Stonewall Jacksons to fight.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe General Buell has divided his force in order to obtain plenty  of water,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;We fellows ought to be fair to him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you're right,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;and you're right when you say  we ought to be fair to him. I know it will be a great relief to General  Buell to find that we three are supporting his management of this army.  Shall I go and tell him, Frank?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not now, but you can a little later on. Suppose you wait until a  day or two after the battle which we all believe is coming.&#8221;
  The three boys were really in high spirits. Little troubled them but  the dryness and the dust. They had tasted so much of defeat and drawn  battle in the east that they had an actual physical sense of better  things in the west. The horizons were wider, the mountains were lower,  and there was not so much enveloping forest. They did not have the  strangling sensation, mental only, which came from the fear that  hostile armies would suddenly rush from the woods and fall upon their  flank.
  Besides, there was Shiloh. After all, they had won Shiloh, and the  coming of this very Buell who led them now had enabled them to win it.  And Shiloh was the only great battle that they had yet really won.
  They camped that night in the dry fields. The Winchester regiment  was a part of the division under McCook, while Buell with the rest of  the army was some miles away. It was still warm, although October was  now seven days old, and Dick had never before heard the grass and  leaves rustle so dryly under the wind. Off in the direction of  Perryville they saw the dim gleam of red, and they knew it came from  the camp-fires of the Southern army. Buell had in his detached  divisions sixty thousand men, most of them veterans and Dick believed  that if they were brought together victory was absolutely sure on the  morrow.
  The troops around the Winchester regiment were lads from Ohio, and  they affiliated readily. Most of the new men were in these Ohio  regiments, and Dick, Warner and Frank felt themselves ancient veterans  who could talk to the recruits and give them good advice. And the  recruits took it in the proper spirit. They looked up with admiration  to those who had been at Shiloh, and the Second Manassas and Antietam.
  Dick thought their spirit remarkable. They were not daunted at all  by the great failures in the east. They did not discount the valor of  the Southern troops, but they asked to be led against them.
  &#8220;Come over here,&#8221; said one of the Ohio boys to Dick. &#8220;Ahead of us  and on the side there's rough ground with thick woods and deep ravines.  I'll show you something just at the edge of the woods. Bring your  friends with you.&#8221;
  The twilight had already turned to night and Dick, calling Warner  and Pennington, went with his new friend. There, flowing from under a  great stone, shaded by a huge oak, was a tiny stream of pure cold water  a couple of inches deep but seven or eight inches broad. Under the  stone a beautiful basin a foot and a half across and about as deep had  been chiselled out.
  &#8220;A lot of us found it here,&#8221; said the Ohio boy, &#8220;and we found, too,  a tin cup chained to a staple driven into the stone. See, it's here  still. We haven't broken the chain. I suppose it belongs to some farmer  close by. The boys brought other tin cups and we drank so fast that the  brook itself became dry. The water never got any further than the pool.  I suppose it's just started again. Drink.&#8221;
  The boys drank deeply and gratefully. No such refreshing stream had  ever flowed down their throats before.
  &#8220;Ohio,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;you're a lovely, dirty angel.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess I am,&#8221; said Ohio, &#8220;'cause I found the spring. It turned me  from an old man back to a boy again. Cold as ice, ain't it? I can tell  you why. This spring starts right at the North Pole, right under the  pole itself, dives away down into the earth, comes under Bering Sea and  then under British America, and then under the lakes, and then under  Ohio, and then under a part of Kentucky, and then comes out here  especially to oblige us, this being a dry season.&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe every word you say, Ohio,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;since your  statements are proved by the quality of the water. I could easily  demonstrate it as a mathematical proposition.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you pay any attention to him, Ohio,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;He's from  Vermont, and he's so full of big words that he's bound to get rid of  some of them.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not doubting you, Vermont,&#8221; said Ohio. &#8220;As you believe every  word I said, I believe every word you said.&#8221;
  &#8220;There's nothing extraordinary about them things,&#8221; said another Ohio  boy belonging to a different brigade, who was sitting near. &#8220;Do you  know that we swallowed a whole river coming down here? We began  swallowing it when we crossed the Ohio, just like a big snake  swallowing a snake not quite so big, taking down his head first, then  keeping on swallowing him until the last tip of his tail disappeared  inside. It was a good big stream when we started, water up to our  knees, but we formed across it in a line five hundred men deep and then  began to drink as we marched forward. Of course, a lot of water got  past the first four hundred lines or so, but the five hundredth always  swallowed up the last drop.&#8221;
  &#8220;We marched against that stream for something like a hundred and  fifty miles. No water ever got past us. We left a perfectly dry bed  behind. Up in the northern part of the state not a drop of water came  down the river in a month. We followed it, or at least a lot of us did,  clean to its source in some hills a piece back of us. We drank it dry  up to a place like this, only bigger, and do you know, a fellow of our  company named Jim Lambert was following it up under the rocks, and we  had to pull him out by the feet to keep him from being suffocated. That  was four days ago, and we had a field telegram yesterday from a place  near the Ohio, saying that a full head of water had come down the river  again, three feet deep from bank to bank and running as if there had  been a cloudburst in the hills. Mighty glad they were to see it, too.&#8221;
  There was a silence, but at length a solemn youth sitting near said  in very serious tones:
  &#8220;I've thought over that story very thoroughly, and I believe it's a  lie.&#8221;
  &#8220;Vermont,&#8221; said the first Ohio lad, &#8220;don't you have faith in my  friend's narrative?&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe every word of it,&#8221; said Warner warmly. &#8220;Our friend here,  who I see can see, despite the dim light, has a countenance which one  could justly say indicates a doubtful and disputatious nature, wishes  to discredit it because he has not heard of such a thing before. Now, I  ask you, gentlemen, intelligent and fair-minded as I know you are,  where would we be, where would civilization be if we assumed the  attitude of our friend here. If a thing is ever seen at all somebody  sees it first, else it would never be seen.<I> Quod erat demonstrandum</I>. You remember your schooldays, of course. I thank you for your  applause, gentlemen, but I'm not through yet. We have passed the  question of things seen, and we now come to the question of things  done, which is perhaps more important. It is obvious even to the  doubtful or carping mind that if a new thing is done it is done by  somebody first. Others will do it afterward, but there must and always  will be a first.
  &#8220;Nobody ever swallowed a river before, beginning at its mouth and  swallowing it clean down to its source, but a division of gallant young  troops from Ohio have done so. They are the first, and they must and  always will be the first. Doubtless, other rivers will be swallowed  later on. As the population increases, larger rivers will be swallowed,  but the credit for initiating the first and greatest pure-water  drinking movement in the history of the world will always belong to a  brave army division from the state of Ohio.&#8221;
  A roar of applause burst forth, and Warner, standing up, bowed  gracefully with his hand upon his heart. Then came a dead silence, as a  hand fell upon the Vermonter's shoulder. Warner looked around and his  jaw fell. General McCook, who commanded this part of the army, was  standing beside him.
  &#8220;Excuse me, sir, I&#8212;&#8221; began Warner.
  &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said the general. &#8220;I had come for a drink of water,  and hearing your debate I stopped for a few moments behind a tree to  listen. I don't know your name, young gentleman.&#8221;
  &#8220;Warner, sir, George Warner, first lieutenant in the regiment of  Colonel Winchester.&#8221;
  &#8220;I merely wished to say, Lieutenant Warner, that I listened to your  speech from the first word to the last, and I found it very cogent and  powerful. As you say, things must have beginnings. If there is no  first, there can be no second or third. I am entirely convinced by your  argument that our army swallowed a river as it marched southward. In  fact, I have often felt so thirsty that I felt as if I could have  swallowed it myself all alone.&#8221;
  There was another roar of applause, and as a dozen cups filled with  water were pushed at the general, he drank deeply and often, and then  retired amid further applause.
  &#8220;They'll fight well for him, to-morrow,&#8221; said Dick.
  &#8220;No doubt of it,&#8221; said Warner.
  They went into the edge of the wood and sought sleep and rest. But  there was much merry chatter first among these lads, for many of whom  death had already spread its somber wings.
