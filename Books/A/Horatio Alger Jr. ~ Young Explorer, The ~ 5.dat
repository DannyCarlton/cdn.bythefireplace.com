    Ben took the early train to New York on Tuesday morning, and in due   time arrived in the city. He carried with him seventy-five dollars   out of his small patrimony. Fifty were to be deposited with Messrs.   Fitch Ferguson, as required, and the balance was to defray his   expenses till he began to receive a salary. Ben didn't expect to  need  much of it, for at the end of a week he would be paid ten  dollars for  his services, and until then he meant to be very  economical. 
  Ben had only been in New York twice before, but he happened to know   his way to Nassau Street, and went there at once, with his carpetbag   in his hand. 
  As he entered Nassau Street from Printing-House 
  Square, a bootblack accosted him. 
  &quot;How are you, country?&quot; 
  &quot;Are you very anxious to know?&quot; asked Ben, stopping short. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm well enough and strong enough to give you a licking.&quot; 
  &quot;Good for you, country! Have you come to stay long?&quot; 
  Ben laughed. He concluded not to take offense, but to answer   seriously. 
  &quot;That depends on whether I get the place I am after.&quot; 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; asked the bootblack, in a friendly tone. 
  Now, on the way to the city, Ben had overheard a conversation   between two gentlemen, relative to certain swindlers in New York,   which, for the first time, had aroused in him a suspicion that   possibly there might be something wrong about the firm whose   advertisement he had answered. He felt the need of an adviser, and   though his choice may be considered rather a strange one, he decided   to consult his new acquaintance, the bootblack. He briefly told him   of the advertisement, and what it offered. 
  The bootblack surveyed him with pitying curiosity. 
  &quot;You don't mean to say you swallow all that?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Don't you think it's all right?&quot; asked Ben anxiously. 
  &quot;Look here,&quot; said the street boy, &quot;do you think anybody's going to   pay a boy ten dollars a week, when there's hundreds ready to work  for  three or four? Why, a man in Pearl Street advertised last week  for a  boy at three dollars, and there was a whole shoal of boys went  for it.  I was one of 'em.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't you earn more than that by your business?&quot; 
  &quot;Sometimes I do, but it ain't stiddy, and I'd rather have a place.&quot; 
  &quot;Why do they advertise to give ten dollars, then?&quot; asked our hero. 
  &quot;They want to get hold of your fifty dollars,&quot; said the bootblack.   &quot;Them fellers is beats, that's what they are.&quot; 
  &quot;What had I better do?&quot; asked Ben, in perplexity. 
  &quot;Go and see 'em, and have a talk. If they're not after your fifty   dollars, you'll know what it means.&quot; 
  &quot;It may be all right, after all,&quot; said Ben, who did not like to  give  up hope. 
  &quot;I may be General Grant,&quot; retorted the bootblack, &quot;but if I know   myself I ain't.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I'll go round and talk with them. Where can I meet you   afterwards?&quot; 
  &quot;I'll be standin' here, if you ain't gone too long.&quot; 
  &quot;What's your name?&quot; 
  &quot;Tom Cooper.&quot; 
  &quot;I am Ben Stanton. Thank you for your advice.&quot; 
  &quot;You're a good feller if you do come from the country. Just look  out  for them fellers. Don't let 'em hook you in.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, Tom.&quot; 
  Ben moved on, watching the numbers as he walked slowly along, till   he came to the one mentioned in the advertisement. There was a   hallway and a staircase, with a directory of persons occupying   offices on the floors above. From this Ben ascertained that Fitch   Ferguson occupied Room 17, on the fourth floor. 
  &quot;I wonder what business they are in,&quot; thought our hero as he  mounted  the stairs. &quot;They must have considerable or they wouldn't need  so  many boys-that is, if they are on the square.&quot; 
  Presently he stood in front of a door bearing the number 17. 
  He knocked for admittance.
