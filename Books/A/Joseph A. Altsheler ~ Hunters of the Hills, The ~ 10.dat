Only four or five men, besides themselves, were left in the great room  of the Inn of the Eagle. The looks they gave the three were not hostile,  and Robert judged that they belonged to the party known in Quebec as  honnetes gens and described to him already by de Galisonniere. He  thought once of speaking to them, but he decided not to put any strain  upon their friendliness. They might have very bitter feelings against  Bigot and his corrupt following, but the fact would not of necessity  induce them to help the Bostonnais.    
"I thought it would be best to go to bed," he said, "but I've changed my  mind. A little walk first in the open air would be good for all of us.  Besides we must stay up long enough to receive the seconds of de Mezy."    
"A walk would be a good thing for you," said Willet--it was noteworthy  that despite his great affection for the lad, he did not show any  anxiety about him.    
"Your wrist feels as strong as ever, doesn't it, Robert?" he asked.    
Young Lennox took his right wrist in his left hand and looked at it  thoughtfully. He was a tall youth, built powerfully, but his wrists were  of uncommon size and strength.    
"I suppose that paddling canoes during one's formative period over our  lakes and rivers develops the wrists and arms better than anything else  can," he said.    
"It makes them strong and supple, too," said the hunter. "It gives to  you a wonderful knack which with training can be applied with equal  ability to something else."    
"As we know."    
"As we know."    
They went out and walked a little while in the streets, curious eyes  still following them, a fact of which they were well aware, although  they apparently took no notice of it. Willet observed Robert closely,  but he could not see any sign of unsteadiness or excitement. Young  Lennox himself seemed to have forgotten the serious business that would  be on hand in the morning. His heart again beat a response to Quebec  which in the dusk was magnificent and glorified. The stone buildings  rose to the size of castles, the great river showed like silver through  the darkness and on the far shore a single light burned.    
A figure appeared before them. It was de Galisonniere, his ruddy face  anxious.    
"I was hoping that we might meet you," said Robert.    
"What's this I hear about a quarrel between you and de Mezy and a duel  in the morning?"    
"You hear the truth."    
"But de Mezy, though he is no friend of mine, is a swordsman, and has  had plenty of experience. You English, or at least you English in your  colonies, know nothing about the sword, except to wear it as a  decoration!"    
Robert laughed.    
"I appreciate your anxiety for me," he said. "It's the feeling of a  friend, but don't worry. A few of us in the English colonies do know the  use of the sword, and at the very head of them I should place David  Willet, whom you know and who is with us."    
"But de Mezy is not going to fight Willet, he is going to fight you."    
"David Willet has been a father to me, more, in truth, than most fathers  are to their sons. I've been with him for years, Captain de  Galisonniere, and all the useful arts he knows he has tried long and  continuously to teach to me."    
"Then you mean that the sword you now wear at your thigh is a weapon and  not an ornament?"    
"Primarily, yes, but before we go further into the matter of the sword,  I wish to ask you a favor."    
"Ask a dozen, Lennox. We've been companions of the voyage and your  quarrel with de Mezy does not arouse any hostility in me."    
"I felt that it was so, and for that reason I ask the favor. We are  strangers in Quebec. We did not come here to seek trouble with anybody,  and so I ask you to be a second for me in this affair with de Mezy. Dave  and Tayoga, of course, would act, but at the present juncture, ours  being an errand of peace and not of war, I'd prefer Frenchmen."    
"Gladly I'll serve you, Lennox, since you indicate that you're a  swordsman and are not going to certain death, and I'll bring with me in  the morning a trusty friend, Armand Glandelet, one of our <i>honnetes  gens</i> who likes de Mezy as little as I do."    
"I thank you much, my good friend. I knew you would accept, and if all  are willing I suggest that we go back now to the Inn of the Eagle."    
"A little trial of the sword in your room would not hurt," said de  Galisonniere.    
"That's a good suggestion," said Willet. "A few turns will show whether  your wrists and your arms and your back are all right. You come with us,  of course, Captain de Galisonniere."    
They went to their large room, Captain de Galisonniere procuring on the  way two buttons for rapiers from Monsieur Berryer--it seemed that duels  were not uncommon in Quebec--and Willet and Robert, taking off their  coats and waistcoats, faced each other in the light of two large  candles. The young Frenchman watched them critically. He had assisted at  many affairs of honor in both Quebec and Montreal and he knew the build  of a swordsman when he saw one. When Robert stood in his shirt sleeves  he noted his powerful chest and shoulders and arms, and then his eyes  traveling to the marvelous wrists were arrested there. He drew in his  breath as he saw, from the way in which Robert flexed them for a moment  or two that they were like wrought steel.    
"If this lad has been taught as they indicate he has, our ruffling  bully, Jean de Mezy, is in for a bad half hour," he said to himself.  Then he looked at Willet, built heavily, with great shoulders and chest,  but with all the spring and activity of a young man. His glance passed  on to Tayoga, the young Onondaga, in all the splendor of his forest  attire, standing by the wall, his eyes calm and fathomless. It occurred  all at once to Captain de Galisonniere that he was in the presence of an  extraordinary three, each remarkable in his own way, and, liking the  unusual, his interest in them deepened. It did not matter that they were  his official enemies, because on the other hand they were his personal  friends.    
"Now, Robert," said Willet, "watch my eye, because I'm going to put you  to a severe test. Ready?"    
"Aye, ready, sir!" replied Robert, speaking like a pupil to his master.  Then the two advanced toward the center of the room and faced each  other, raising their slim swords which flashed in the flame of the  candles like thin lines of light. Then Willet thrust like lightning, but  his blade slipped off Robert's, and young Lennox thrust back only to  have his own weapon caught on the other.    
"Ah," exclaimed the gallant Frenchman. "Well done! Well done for both!"    
Then he held his breath as the play of the swords became so fast that  the eye could scarcely follow. They made vivid lines, and steel flashed  upon steel with such speed that at times the ringing sound seemed  continuous. Willet's agility was amazing. Despite his size and weight  he was as swift and graceful as a dancing master, and the power of his  wrist was wonderful. The amazement of young de Galisonniere increased.  He had seen the best swordsmanship in Quebec, and he had seen the best  swordsmanship in Paris, but he had never seen better swordsmanship than  that shown in a room of the Inn of the Eagle by a man whom he had taken  to be a mere hunter in the American wilderness.    
De Galisonniere was an artist with the sword himself, and he knew  swordsmanship when he saw it. He knew, too, that Lennox was but little  inferior to Willet. He saw that the older man was not sparing the youth,  that he was incessantly beating against the strongest parts of his  defense, and that he was continually seeking out his weakest. Robert was  driven around and around the room, and yet Willet did not once break  through his guard.    
"Ah, beautiful! beautiful!" exclaimed the Frenchman. "I did not know  that such swordsmen could come out of the woods!"    
His eyes met those of the Onondaga and for the first time he saw a gleam  in their dark depths.    
"Their swords are alive," said Tayoga. "They are living streaks of  flame."    
"That describes it, my friend," said de Galisonniere. "I shall be proud  to be one of the seconds of Mr. Lennox in the morning."    
Willet suddenly dropped the buttoned point of his rapier and raised his  left hand.    
"Enough, Robert," he said, "I can't allow you to tire yourself tonight,  and run the risk of stiffening in the wrist tomorrow. In strength you  are superior to de Mezy, and in wind far better. You should have no  trouble with him. Watch his eye and stand for a while on the defensive.  One of his habits, will soon wear himself down, and then he will be at  your mercy."    
"You are a wonderful swordsman, Mr. Willet," said de Galisonniere, frank  in his admiration. "I did not think such skill, such power and such a  variety in attack and defense could be learned outside of Paris."    
"Perhaps not!" said Willet, smiling. "The greatest masters of the sword  in the world teach in Paris, and it was there that I learned what I  know."    
"What, you have been in Paris?"    
"Aye, Captain de Galisonniere, I know my Paris well."    
But he volunteered nothing further and Louis de Galisonniere's delicacy  kept him from asking any more questions. Nevertheless he had an  intensified conviction that three most extraordinary people had come to  Quebec, and he was glad to know them. Jean de Mezy, count of France, and  powerful man though he might be, was going to receive a punishment  richly deserved. He detested Bigot, Cadet, Pean and all their corrupt  crowd, while recognizing the fact that they were almost supreme in  Quebec. It would be pleasing to the gods for de Mezy to be humiliated,  and it did not matter if the humiliation came from the hands of a  Bostonnais.    
"Would you mind trying a round or two at the foils with me?" he said to  Willet. "Since you don't have to fight in the morning you needn't fear  any stiffening of the wrist, and I should like to learn something about  that low thrust of yours, the one well beneath your opponent's guard,  and which only a movement like lightning can reach. You used it five  times, unless my eye missed a sixth."    
"And so you noticed it!" said Willet, looking pleased. "I made six such  thrusts, but Robert met them every time. I've trained him to be on the  watch for it, because in a real combat it's sure to be fatal, unless  it's parried with the swiftness of thought."    
"Then teach me," said de Galisonniere eagerly. "We're a fighting lot  here in Quebec, and it may save my life some day."    
Willet was not at all averse, and for nearly an hour he taught the young  Frenchman. Then de Galisonniere departed, cautioning Robert to sleep  well, and saying that he would come early in the morning with his  friend, Glandelet.    
"His advice about sleeping was good, Robert," said Willet. "Now roll  into bed and off with you to slumberland at once."    
Robert obeyed and his nerves were so steady and his mind so thoroughly  at peace that in fifteen minutes he slept. The hunter watched his steady  breathing with satisfaction and said to Tayoga:    
"If our bibulous friend, Count Jean de Mezy, doesn't have a surprise in  the morning, then I'll go back to the woods, and stay there as long as I  live."    
"Will Lennox kill him?" asked Tayoga.    
"I hadn't thought much about it, Tayoga, but he won't kill him. Robert  isn't sanguinary. He doesn't want anybody's blood on his hands, and it  wouldn't help our mission to take a life in Quebec."    
"The man de Mezy does not deserve to live."    
Willet laughed.    
"That's so, Tayoga," he said, "but it's no part of our business to go  around taking the lives away from all those who don't make good use of  'em. Why, if we undertook such a job we'd have to work hard for the next  thousand years. I think we'd better fall on, ourselves, and snatch about  eight good hours of slumber."    
In a few minutes three instead of one slept, and when the first ray of  sunlight entered the room in the morning Tayoga awoke. He opened the  window, letting the fresh air pour in, and he raised his nostrils to it  like a hound that has caught the scent. It brought to him the aromatic  odors of his beloved wilderness, and, for a time, he was back in the  great land of the Hodenosaunee among the blue lakes and the silver  streams. He had been educated in the white man's schools, and his  friendship for Robert and Willet was strong and enduring, but his heart  was in the forest. Enlightened and humane, he had nevertheless asked  seriously the night before the question: "Will Lennox kill him?" He had  discovered something fetid in Quebec and to him de Mezy was a noxious  animal that should be destroyed. He wished, for an instant, that he knew  the sword and that he was going to stand in Lennox's place.    
Then he woke Robert and Willet, and they dressed quickly, but by the  time they had finished Monsieur Berryer knocked on the door and told  them breakfast was ready. The innkeeper's manner was flurried. He was  one of the <i>honnetes gens</i> who liked peace and an upright life. He too  wished the insolent pride of de Mezy to be humbled, but he had scarcely  come to the point where he wanted to see a Bostonnais do it. Nor did he  believe that it could be done. De Mezy was a good swordsman, and his  friends would see that he was in proper condition. Weighing the matter  well, Monsieur Berryer was, on the whole, sorry for the young stranger.    
But Robert himself showed no apprehensions. He ate his excellent  breakfast with an equally excellent appetite, and Monsieur Berryer  noticed that his hand did not tremble. He observed, too, that he had  spirit enough to talk and laugh with his friends, and when Captain de  Galisonniere and another young Frenchman, Lieutenant Armand Glandelet,  arrived, he welcomed them warmly.    
The captain carried under his arm a long thin case, in which Monsieur  Berryer knew that the swords lay. Lieutenant Armand Glandelet was  presented duly and Robert liked his appearance, his age apparently  twenty-three or four, his complexion fair and his figure slender. His  experience in affairs of honor was not as great as de Galisonniere's,  and he showed some excitement, but he was one of the <i>honnetes gens</i> and  he too wished, the punishment of de Mezy. Perhaps he had suffered from  him some insult or snub which he was not in a position to resent fully.    
"Is your wrist strong and steady and without soreness, Mr. Lennox?"  asked Captain de Galisonniere.    
"It was never more flexible," replied Robert confidently. "Shall we go  to the field? I should like to be there first."    
"A praiseworthy attitude," said Captain de Galisonniere. "The sun is  just rising and the light is good. Come."    
Keeping the long, thin case under his arm, he went forth, and the rest  followed. Monsieur Berryer also came at a respectful distance, and  others fell into line with him. Robert walked by the side of Willet.    
"Don't forget that low thrust," said the hunter, "and watch his eye. You  feel no apprehensions?"    
"None at all, thanks to you. I'm quite sure I'm his master."    
"Then it's a good morning for a fight, and the setting is perfect.  You'll remember this day, Robert. What a wonderful situation has the  Quebec of the French that was the Stadacona of the Mohawks! A fine town,  a great rock and the king of rivers! The St. Lawrence looks golden in  the early sunlight, and what a lot of it there is!"    
"Yes, it's a great stream," said Robert, looking at the golden river and  the far shores, green and high.    
"Here we are," said de Galisonniere, passing beyond some outlying  houses. "It's a good, clear opening, pretty well surrounded by trees,  with plenty of sunlight at all points, and as you wished, Mr. Lennox,  we're the first to arrive."    
They stood together, talking with apparent unconcern, while the morning  unfolded, and the golden sunlight over the river deepened. Although he  had been trained with the sword for years, it would be Robert's first  duel, and, while he approached it with supreme confidence, he knew that  he could find no joy in the shedding of another's blood. He felt it a  strange chance that such an affair should be forced upon him, and yet  this was a dueling city. The hot young spirits of France had brought  their customs with them into the North American wilderness, and perhaps  the unsought chance, if he used it as he thought he could, would not  serve him so ill after all.    
De Mezy, with his seconds, Nemours and Le Moyne, was approaching among  the trees. It appeared that the seconds for both had arranged everything  at a meeting the night before, and nothing was left for the two  principals but to fight. Robert saw at a single glance that de Mezy's  head was clear. Some of the mottled color had left his cheeks, but the  effect was an improvement, and he bore himself like a man who was strong  and confident. He and his seconds wore dark blue cloaks over their  uniforms, which they laid aside when they saw that Robert and his  friends were present.    
Nemours stepped forward and asked to speak with Captain de Galisonniere.    
"Count Jean de Mezy," he said, "is an experienced swordsman, a victor in  a dozen duels, a man of great skill, and he does not wish to take an  advantage that might seem unfair to others. He considers the extreme  youth of his opponent, and if by chance his friend, Mr. Willet, should  know the sword, he will meet him instead."    
It was, on the whole, a handsome offer, better than they had expected  from de Mezy, and Galisonniere looked with inquiry, first at young  Lennox and then at Willet. But Robert shook his head.    
"No," he said, "Captain de Mezy's offer does him credit, but I decline  it. I am his inferior in years, but his equal in stature and strength,  and I have had some experience with the sword. Mr. Willet would gladly  take my place, but I can support the combat myself."    
Nemours stepped back, and Robert resolved that de Mezy's offer should  not have been made wholly in vain. It would save the Frenchman some of  his blood, but Nemours and de Galisonniere were now choosing the  positions in such a manner that neither would have the sun in his eyes  but merely his shoulder against the disc. Robert took off his coat and  waistcoat and Willet folded them over his own arm. De Mezy prepared in  like manner. Nemours gazed at young Lennox's shoulders and arms, and the  muscles swelling beneath his thin shirt, and he was not quite so sure of  his principal's victory as he had been.    
Then the two faced each other and Robert looked straight into his  opponent's eyes, reading there the proof that while outwardly de Mezy  might now show no signs of dissipation, yet drink and lost hours had  struck a blow at the vital organism of the human machine. He was more  confident than ever, and he repeated to himself Willet's advice to be  cautious and slow at first.    
"Your positions, gentlemen!" said de Galisonniere, and they stood face  to face. The turf was short and firm, and the place was ideal for their  purpose. Among the trees the eager eyes of Monsieur Berryer and a score  of others watched.    
"Ready!" said de Galisonniere, and then, after a pause of two or three  moments, he added:    
"Proceed!"    
Robert had not looked straight into his opponent's eye so long for  nothing. He knew now that de Mezy was choleric and impatient, that he  would attack at once with a vigorous arm and a furious heart, expecting  a quick and easy victory. His reading of the mind through the eye was  vindicated as de Mezy immediately forced the combat, cutting and  thrusting with a fire and power that would have overwhelmed an ordinary  opponent.    
Robert smiled. He knew now beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was de  Mezy's master. Not in vain did he have those large and powerful wrists,  firm and strong as wrought steel, and not in vain had he been taught for  years by the best swordsman in America. He contented himself with  parrying the savage cuts and thrusts, and gave ground slowly, retreating  in a circle. De Mezy's eyes blazed at first with triumph. He had  resented Robert's refusal of his offer to substitute Willet, and now,  the victory which he had regarded as easy seemed to be even easier than  he had hoped. He pushed the combat harder. His sword flashed in a  continuous line of light, and the whirring of steel upon steel was  unceasing. But the face of Nemours, as he watched with an understanding  eye, fell a little. He saw that the breathing of young Lennox was long  and regular, and that his eye was still smiling.    
Robert continued to give ground, but he never took his eye from that of  de Mezy, and at last the count began to feel that something lay behind  that calm, smiling gaze. The drink and the multitude of lost hours came  back to demand their price. Something bit into his bone. Was it physical  weakness or a sudden decay of confidence? He did not see any sign of  weariness in his young opponent, and putting forth every effort of his  muscles and every trick and device he knew he could not break through  that shining guard of circling steel.    
The strange apprehension that had suddenly found a place in de Mezy's  mind began to grow. The slow retreat of his young antagonist was  becoming slower and then it ceased entirely. Now the leaping sword  before him began to drive him back, and always the calm smiling eyes  probed into his, reading what he would keep hidden deep in his heart.  They saw the terror that was growing there. The disbelief in his  antagonist's prowess was now fast turning into a hideous contradiction,  and all the while drink and the lost hours that had clamored for their  price were taking it.    
De Mezy began to give back. His breath grew shorter and he gasped. The  deep mottled red returned to his cheeks, and terror took whole  possession of him. He had struck down his man before and he had laughed,  but he had never faced such a swordsman as this strange youth of the  woods, with his smiling eyes and his face which was a mask despite the  smile.    
Nemours and Le Moyne turned pale. They saw that their leader had never  once passed the bar of steel before him, and that while he panted and  grew weary Lennox seemed stronger than ever. They saw, too, that the  youth was a swordsman far surpassing de Mezy and that now he was playing  with his enemy. He struck down his opponent's guard at will, and his  blade whistled about his body and face. Nemours' hand fell to his own  hilt, but the watchful Willet saw.    
"Be careful," the hunter said in a menacing tone. "Obey the rules or  I'll know the reason why."    
Nemours' hand fell away from the hilt, and he and Le Moyne exchanged  glances, but stood helpless. De Mezy had been driven backward in an  almost complete circle. His wrist and arm ached to the shoulder, and  always he saw before him the leaping steel and the smiling mask of a  face. He caught a glimpse of the blue sky and the shining river, and  then his eyes came back to the one that held his fate. Well for de Mezy  that he had made the offer that morning to substitute Willet for Lennox,  since youth, with the hot blood of battle pulsing in its veins, may  think too late of mercy. But Robert remembered. His revenge was already  complete. All had seen the pallid face of de Mezy, and all, whether  they knew anything of the sword or not, knew that he lay at the mercy of  his foe.    
"Strike and make an end!" gasped de Mezy.    
The sword flashed before his eyes again, but the blade did not touch  him. Instead his own sword was torn from his weakening grasp, and was  flung far upon the grass. Young Lennox, turning away, sheathed his  weapon.    
"Well done, Robert!" said Willet.    
De Mezy put his hand to his face, which was wet with perspiration, and  steadied himself. He had grown quite dizzy in the last few moments, and  the pulses in his head beat so heavily that he could neither see nor  think well. He was conscious that he stood unarmed before a victorious  foe, but he did not know Robert had put away his sword.    
"Why don't you strike?" he muttered.    
"Mr. Lennox is satisfied," said Nemours. "He does not wish the combat to  go further."    
"Unless Captain de Mezy insists on another trial," said de Galisonniere,  smiling a little, "but if he will take the advice of a countryman of his  he will let the matter rest where it is. Enough has been done to satisfy  the honor of everybody."    
He and Nemours exchanged significant glances. It was quite evident to de  Mezy's seconds that he was no match for Robert, and that another trial  would probably result in greater disaster, so Nemours and Le Moyne, in  behalf of their principal, promptly announced that they were satisfied,  and de Galisonniere and Glandelet said as much for theirs. Meanwhile  Monsieur Berryer and the other spectators, who had now risen to the  number of two score, continued to watch from the shelter of the trees.  They had seen the result with protruding eyes, but they had not  understood when the young victor thrust his sword back in its sheath.  They could not hear the talk, but it was quite clear that the duel was  over, and they turned away, somewhat disappointed that one of their own  had lost the combat, but somewhat pleased, too, that he had not lost his  own life at the same time.    
"Shake hands, gentlemen," said de Galisonniere blithely. "Although no  blood was shed it was a hot battle and I hope when you two meet again it  will be in friendship and not in enmity. You are a fine swordsman,  Lennox, and it was honorable of you, de Mezy, when you didn't know his  caliber, to offer to take on, because of his youth, the older man, Mr.  Willet."    
Robert came back and offered his hand frankly. De Mezy, whose head was  still ringing from his uncommon exertions and chagrin, took it. It was  bitter to have lost, but he still lived. In a manner as he saw it, he  had been disgraced, but time and the red wine and the white would take  away the sting. He still lived. That was the grand and beautiful fact.  Many more joyous days and nights awaited him in the company of Bigot and  Cadet and Pean, powerful men who knew how to exercise their power and  how to live at the same time. He should be grateful for a little while,  at least, to the young Bostonnais, and he shook the proffered hand as  heartily as his own damp, limp fingers would admit.    
"May your stay in Quebec be as pleasant as you wish," he said, a bit  thickly.    
"Thanks," said Robert, who read the man's mind thoroughly.    
De Galisonniere put away the unstained swords, quite satisfied with the  affair, himself and everybody. An important follower of Bigot had been  humbled, and yet he had not suffered in such a manner that he could call  for the punishment of the one who had humbled him. The very youth of the  Bostonnais would disarm resentment against him.    
De Mezy's party with formal bows drew away, and Robert and his friends  returned to the Inn of the Eagle.
