    &quot;When the funeral was over, Frank Dunbar, whom Philip regarded as   his most intimate friend, came up to him. 
  &quot;Philip,&quot; he said, &quot;my mother would like to have you spend a few   days with us while you are deciding what to do.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Frank!&quot; answered Philip. &quot;But until the auction I shall   remain at home. I shall soon enough be without a home.&quot; 
  &quot;But it will be very lonely for you,&quot; objected Frank. 
  &quot;No; I shall have my thoughts for company. When I am alone I can   think best of my future plans.&quot; 
  &quot;Won't you come to our house to meals, then?&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Frank! I will do that.&quot; 
  &quot;When is the auction to be?&quot; 
  &quot;To-day is Monday. It is appointed for Thursday.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope there will be something left for you.&quot; 
  &quot;There will be about enough left to pay my father's small debts and   his funeral expenses. I would not like to have him indebted to  others  for those. I don't think there will be anything over.&quot; 
  Frank looked perplexed. 
  &quot;I am sorry for you, Phil,&quot; he said. &quot;I wish we were rich, instead   of having hard work to make both ends meet. You would not lack for   anything then.&quot; 
  &quot;Dear Frank,&quot; said Philip earnestly, &quot;I never doubted your true   friendship. But I am not afraid that I shall suffer. I am sure I can   earn my living.&quot; 
  &quot;But why do you shut yourself up alone, Philip?&quot; asked Frank, not   satisfied to leave his friend in what he considered the gloomy   solitude of a house just visited by death. 
  &quot;I want to look over my father's papers. I may find out something   that I ought to know, and after the auction it will be too late.   Father had some directions to give me, but he did not live long   enough to do it. For three days I have the house to myself. After   that I shall perhaps never visit it again.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't be downhearted, Philip,&quot; said Frank, pressing his hand with   boyish sympathy. 
  &quot;I don't mean to be, Frank. I am naturally cheerful and hopeful. I   shall miss my poor father sadly: but grieving will not bring him   back. I must work for my living, and as I have no money to depend   upon, I cannot afford to lose any time in forming my plans.&quot; 
  &quot;You will come over to our house and take your meals!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Frank.&quot; 
  Frank Dunbar's father was a small farmer, who, as Frank had said,   found it hard work to make both ends meet. Among all the village   boys, he was the one whom Philip liked best, though there were many   others whose fathers were in hotter circumstances. For this,  however,  Philip cared little. Rich or poor, Frank suited him, and  they had  always been known as chums, to adopt the term used by the  boys in the  village. 
  It may be thought that as Philip's circumstances were no better,   such an intimacy was natural enough. But Philip Gray possessed   special gifts, which made his company sought after. He was a fine   singer, and played with considerable skill on the violin&#8212;an   accomplishment derived from his father, who had acted as his  teacher.  Then he was of a cheerful temperament, and this is a gift  which  usually renders the possessor popular, unless marred by  positive  defects or bad qualities. There were two or three young  snobs in the  village who looked down upon Philip on account of his  father's  poverty, but most were very glad to associate with our  hero, and have  him visit their homes. He was courteous to all, but  made&#8212;no secret of  his preference for Frank Dunbar. 
  When Philip parted from Frank, and entered the humble dwelling  which  had been his own and his father's home for years, there was a  sense  of loneliness and desolation which came over him at first. 
  His father was the only relative whom he knew, and his death,   therefore, left the boy peculiarly, alone in the world. Everything   reminded him of his dead father. But he did not allow himself to   dwell upon thoughts that would depress his spirits and unfit him for   the work that lay before him. 
  He opened his father's desk and began to examine his papers. There   was no will, for there was nothing to leave, but in one compartment   of the desk was a thick wallet, which he opened. 
  In it, among some receipted bills, was an envelope, on which was   written, in his father's well-known hand: 
  &quot;The contents of this envelope are probably of no value, but it  will  be as well to preserve the certificate of stock. There is a bare   possibility that it may some day be worth a trifle.&quot; 
  Philip opened the envelope and found a certificate for a hundred   shares of the Excelsior Gold Mine, which appeared to be located in   California. He had once heard his father speak of it in much the  same  terms as above. 
  &quot;I may as well keep it,&quot; reflected Philip. &quot;It will probably amount   to nothing, but there won't be much trouble in carrying around the   envelope.&quot; He also found a note of hand for a thousand dollars,   signed by Thomas Graham. 
  Attached to it was a slip of paper, on which he read, also in his   father's writing: 
  &quot;This note represents a sum of money lent to Thomas Graham, when I   was moderately prosperous. It is now outlawed, and payment could not   be enforced, even if Graham were alive and possessed the ability to   pay. Five years since, he left this part of the country for some   foreign country, and is probably dead, and I have heard nothing from   him in all that time. It will do no harm, and probably no good, to   keep his note,&quot; 
  &quot;I will keep it,&quot; decided Philip. &quot;It seems that this and the  mining  shares are all that father had to leave me. They will probably  never  yield me a cent, but I will keep them in remembrance of him.&quot; 
  Phillip found his father's watch. It was an old-fashioned gold   watch, but of no great value even when new. Now, after twenty years'   use, it would command a very small price at the coming sale. 
  Ever since Philip had been old enough to notice anything, he   remembered this watch, which was so closely identified with his   father that more than anything else it called him to mind. Philip   looked at it wistfully as it lay in his hand. &quot;I wish I could keep   it,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;No one else will value it much, but it   would always speak to me of my father. I wonder if I might keep it?&quot; 
  Philip had a mind to put it into his pocket, but the spirit of   honesty forbade. 
  &quot;It must be sold,&quot; he said, with a sigh. &quot;Without it there wouldn't   be enough to pay what we owe, and when I leave Norton, I don't want   any one to say that my father died in his debt.&quot; 
  There was nothing else in the desk which called for particular   notice or appeared to be of any special value. After a careful   examination, Philip closed it and looked around at the familiar   furniture of the few rooms which the house contained. 
  There was one object which he personally valued more than anything   else. This was his violin, on which he had learned all that he knew   of playing. His father had bought it for him four years before. It   was not costly, but it was of good tone, and Philip had passed many   pleasant hours in practicing on it. 
  &quot;I can take this violin, at any rate,&quot; said Philip to himself. &quot;It   belongs to me, and no one else has a claim on it. I think I will  take  it with me and leave it at Frank Dunbar's, so that it needn't  get into  the sale.&quot; 
  He put back the violin into the case and laid it on one side. Then   he sat down in the arm-chair, which had been his father's favorite   seat, and tried to fix his mind upon the unknown future which lay   before him. 
  He had sat there for half an hour, revolving in his mind various   thoughts and plans, when he heard a tap on the window, and looking   up, saw through the pane the coarse, red face of Nick Holden, a  young  fellow of eighteen, the son of the village butcher. 
  &quot;Let me in!&quot; said Nick; &quot;I want to see you on business.&quot;
