  Godfrey rose to his feet, red with mortification. His mother looked  disconcerted. Mr. Stone said nothing, but glanced significantly from  Godfrey to Mrs. Preston.
  &#8220;What is the matter, Godfrey?&#8221; she asked, rather sharply.
  &#8220;It was an accident,&#8221; said Godfrey, rather sheepishly.
  &#8220;You can go out and shut the door, and take care not to let such an  accident happen again. For some unknown reason, Mr. Stone prefers that  you should not be present, and, therefore, you must go.&#8221;
  For once, Godfrey found nothing to say, but withdrew in silence.
  &#8220;You appear to have formed a prejudice against Godfrey, Mr. Stone,&#8221;  said Mrs. Preston.
  &#8220;I may have formed an unfavorable judgment of him on some points,&#8221;  said the teacher. &#8220;I judge of him by his conduct.&#8221;
  &#8220;To say that Andrew Burke is his superior is insulting to him and  his family, as well as ludicrous.&#8221;
  &#8220;I beg pardon, Mrs. Preston, but I must dissent from both your  statements. Andrew Burke possesses some excellent qualities in which  Godfrey is deficient.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is a poor working boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is none the worse for that.&#8221;
  &#8220;He should remember his position, and treat my son with proper  respect.&#8221;
  &#8220;I venture to say that Godfrey will receive all the respect to which  he is entitled. May I ask if you expect him to be treated with  deference, because his father is richer than those of the other boys?&#8221;
  &#8220;It seems to me only proper.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you expect me to treat him any better on that account?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think my son's social position should command respect.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Mrs. Preston, I entirely disagree with you,&#8221; said Mr. Stone,  firmly. &#8220;As a teacher, I have nothing whatever to do with the social  position of the children who come to me as pupils. From me a poor boy  will receive the same instruction, and the same treatment precisely as  the son of rich parents. If he behaves as he should, he will always  find in me a friend, as well as a teacher. Your son Godfrey shall have  no just complaint to make of my treatment. I will give him credit for  good conduct and faithful study, but no more than to Andrew Burke, or  to any other pupil under the same circumstances.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Stone, I am surprised at your singular style of talking. You  wish to do away with all social distinctions.&#8221;
  &#8220;I certainly do, madam, in my schoolroom, at least. There must be  social differences, I am aware. We cannot all be equally rich or  honored, but whatever may be the world's rule, I mean to maintain  strict impartiality in my schoolroom.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you require Andy Burke to apologize to Godfrey?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why should I?&#8221;
  &#8220;For his violent assault upon him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Certainly not. He was justified in his conduct.&#8221;
  &#8220;If my son was doing wrong, the Irish boy, instead of interfering,  should have waited till you came, and then reported the matter to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;And, meanwhile, stood by and seen Alfred Parker inhumanly treated?&#8221;
  &#8220;I presume the matter has been greatly exaggerated.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do not, madam.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do I understand that you decline to make reparation to my son?&#8221;
  &#8220;Reparation for what?&#8221;
  &#8220;For the manner in which he has been treated.&#8221;
  &#8220;I must have talked to little purpose, if I have not made it clear  that your son has only received his deserts. Of course, he is entitled  to no reparation, as you term it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Mr. Stone,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, her thin lips compressed with  indignation, &#8220;since Godfrey cannot meet with fair treatment, I shall be  compelled to withdraw him from your school.&#8221;
  &#8220;That must be as you please, madam,&#8221; said the teacher, quite unmoved  by the threatened withdrawal of his richest pupil.
  &#8220;I shall report to Colonel Preston your treatment of his son.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have no objection, madam.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are pursuing a very unwise course in alienating your wealthiest  patrons.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have no patrons, madam,&#8221; said Mr. Stone, proudly. &#8220;I return  faithful service for the moderate wages I receive, and the obligation,  if there is any, is on the part of those whose children I instruct.&#8221;
  &#8220;Really,&#8221; thought Mrs. Preston, &#8220;this man is very independent for a  poor teacher.&#8221;
  She resolved upon another shot, not in the best of taste.
  &#8220;You must not be surprised, Mr. Stone,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if the school  trustees refuse to employ you again.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mistake me utterly,&#8221; said the teacher, with dignity, &#8220;if you  suppose that any such threat or consideration will make me swerve from  my duty. However, though I did not propose to mention it, I will state  that this is the last term I shall teach in this village. I have been  engaged at double the salary in a neighboring city.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston was disappointed to hear this. It was certainly  vexatious that the man who had treated her son with so little  consideration, who had actually taken the part of a working boy against  him, should be promoted to a better situation. She had thought to make  him feel that he was in her power, but she now saw that her  anticipations were not to be realized.
  As she did not speak, Mr. Stone considered the interview closed, and  rose.
  &#8220;Good-evening, Mrs. Preston,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Good-evening, sir,&#8221; she responded, coldly.
  He bowed and withdrew.
  When Godfrey, who was not far off, though he had not thought it best  to play the part of eavesdropper again, heard the door close, he  hurried into the room.
  &#8220;Well, mother, what did he say?&#8221; he inquired, eagerly.
  &#8220;He obstinately refused to make any reparation to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you tell him what you thought of his treatment of me?&#8221; said  Godfrey, rather surprised that his mother's remonstrance had produced  no greater effect.
  &#8220;Yes, I expressed my opinion very plainly. I must say that he's a  very impudent man. The idea of a poor teacher putting on such airs!&#8221;  continued Mrs. Preston, tossing her head.
  &#8220;What did he say?&#8221;
  &#8220;That that Irish boy was superior to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd like to knock him over,&#8221; said Godfrey, wrathfully.
  Mrs. Preston was a lady, and it is not to be supposed that she  should join in her son's wish. Still, it did not occur to her that she  should mourn very much if Mr. Stone met with a reverse. She would like  to see his pride humbled, not reflecting that her own was greater and  less justifiable.
  &#8220;You ought to have told him that he would lose his school,&#8221; said  Godfrey. &#8220;That would have frightened him, for he is a poor man, and  depends on the money he gets for teaching.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is not going to teach here after this term.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good! Did he tell you that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is afraid of me, after all.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are mistaken, Godfrey. He is offered considerably higher pay in  another place.&#8221;
  Godfrey's countenance fell. It was as disagreeable to him as to his  mother to learn that Mr. Stone was to be promoted in his profession.
  &#8220;Shall I have to go to school again, mother?&#8221; he asked, after a  pause.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, with energy. &#8220;Upon that I have determined.  While Mr. Stone is teacher, you shall not go back. I will take care to  let it be known in the neighborhood why I keep you at home. I hope the  next teacher will be a man who understands the respect due to social  position. I don't care to have you put on an equality with such boys as  Andrew Burke. He is no fit associate for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is what I think, mother,&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;The low beggar! I'd  like to come up with him. Perhaps, I shall have a chance some day.&#8221;
  When Colonel Preston returned home, the whole story was told to him;  but, colored though it was, he guessed how matters actually stood, and  was far from becoming his son's partisan. He privately went to Mr.  Stone and obtained his version of the affair.
  &#8220;You did right, Mr. Stone,&#8221; he said, at the end. &#8220;If my son chooses  to act the bully, he must take the consequences. Mrs. Preston does not  look upon it in the same light, and insists upon my taking Godfrey from  school. For the sake of peace, I must do so, but you must not construe  it as showing any disapproval on my part of your course in the matter.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Colonel Preston,&#8221; said the teacher, warmly. &#8220;I can only  regret Mrs. Preston's displeasure. Your approval I highly value, and it  will encourage me in the path of duty.&#8221;
