  It seemed to Alan that in an instant a sudden change had come over  the world. There was silence in the cabin, except for the breath which  came like a sob to the girl's lips as she turned to the window and  looked out into the blaze of golden sunlight that filled the tundra. He  heard Tautuk's voice, calling to Keok away over near the reindeer  corral, and he heard clearly Keok's merry laughter as she answered him.  A gray-cheeked thrush flew up to the roof of Sokwenna's cabin and began  to sing. It was as if these things had come as a message to both of  them, relieving a tension, and significant of the beauty and glory and  undying hope of life. Mary Standish turned from the window with shining  eyes.
  &#8220;Every day the thrush comes and sings on our cabin roof,&#8221; she said.
  &#8220;It is&#8212;possibly&#8212;because you are here,&#8221; he replied.
  She regarded him seriously. &#8220;I have thought of that. You know, I  have faith in a great many unbelievable things. I can think of nothing  more beautiful than the spirit that lives in the heart of a bird. I am  sure, if I were dying, I would like to have a bird singing near me.  Hopelessness cannot be so deep that bird-song will not reach it.&#8221;
  He nodded, trying to answer in that way. He felt uncomfortable. She  closed the door which he had left partly open, and made a little  gesture for him to resume the chair which he had left a few moments  before. She seated herself first and smiled at him wistfully, half  regretfully, as she said:
  &#8220;I have been very foolish. What I am going to tell you now I should  have told you aboard the<I> Nome</I>. But I was afraid. Now I am not  afraid, but ashamed, terribly ashamed, to let you know the truth. And  yet I am not sorry it happened so, because otherwise I would not have  come up here, and all this&#8212;your world, your people, and you&#8212;have  meant a great deal to me. You will understand when I have made my  confession.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I don't want that,&#8221; he protested almost roughly. &#8220;I don't want  you to put it that way. If I can help you, and if you wish to tell me  as a friend, that's different. I don't want a confession, which would  imply that I have no faith in you.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you have faith in me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; so much that the sun will darken and bird-song never seem the  same if I lose you again, as I thought I had lost you from the ship.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh,<I> you mean that</I>!&#8221;
  The words came from her in a strange, tense, little cry, and he  seemed to see only her eyes as he looked at her face, pale as the  petals of the tundra daises behind her. With the thrill of what he had  dared to say tugging at his heart, he wondered why she was so white.
  &#8220;You mean that,&#8221; her lips repeated slowly, &#8220;after all that has  happened&#8212;even after&#8212;that part of a letter&#8212;which Stampede brought to  you last night&#8212;&#8221;
  He was surprised. How had she discovered what he thought was a  secret between himself and Stampede? His mind leaped to a conclusion,  and she saw it written in his face.
  &#8220;No, it wasn't Stampede,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He didn't tell me. It&#8212;just  happened. And after this letter&#8212;you still believe in me?&#8221;
  &#8220;I must. I should be unhappy if I did not. And I am&#8212;most perversely  hoping for happiness. I have told myself that what I saw over John  Graham's signature was a lie.&#8221;
  &#8220;It wasn't that&#8212;quite. But it didn't refer to you, or to me. It was  part of a letter written to Rossland. He sent me some books while I was  on the ship, and inadvertently left a page of this letter in one of  them as a marker. It was really quite unimportant, when one read the  whole of it. The other half of the page is in the toe of the slipper  which you did not return to Ellen McCormick. You know that is the  conventional thing for a woman to do&#8212;to use paper for padding in a  soft-toed slipper.&#8221;
  He wanted to shout; he wanted to throw up his arms and laugh as  Tautuk and Amuk Toolik and a score of others had laughed to the beat of  the tom-toms last night, not because he was amused, but out of sheer  happiness. But Mary Standish's voice, continuing in its quiet and  matter-of-fact way, held him speechless, though she could not fail to  see the effect upon him of this simple explanation of the presence of  Graham's letter.
  &#8220;I was in Nawadlook's room when I saw Stampede pick up the wad of  paper from the floor,&#8221; she was saying. &#8220;I was looking at the slipper a  few minutes before, regretting that you had left its mate in my cabin  on the ship, and the paper must have dropped then. I saw Stampede read  it, and the shock that came in his face. Then he placed it on the table  and went out. I hurried to see what he had found and had scarcely read  the few words when I heard him returning. I returned the paper where he  had laid it, hid myself in Nawadlook's room, and saw Stampede when he  carried it to you. I don't know why I allowed it to be done. I had no  reason. Maybe it was just&#8212;intuition, and maybe it was because&#8212;just in  that hour&#8212;I so hated myself that I wanted someone to flay me alive,  and I thought that what Stampede had found would make you do it. And I  deserve it! I deserve nothing better at your hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it isn't true,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;The letter was to Rossland.&#8221;
  There was no responsive gladness in her eyes. &#8220;Better that it were  true, and all that<I> is</I> true were false,&#8221; she said in a quiet,  hopeless voice. &#8220;I would almost give my life to be no more than what  those words implied, dishonest, a spy, a criminal of a sort; almost any  alternative would I accept in place of what I actually am. Do you begin  to understand?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid&#8212;I can not.&#8221; Even as he persisted in denial, the pain  which had grown like velvety dew in her eyes clutched at his heart, and  he felt dread of what lay behind it. &#8220;I understand&#8212;only&#8212;that I am  glad you are here, more glad than yesterday, or this morning, or an  hour ago.&#8221;
  She bowed her head, so that the bright light of day made a radiance  of rich color in her hair, and he saw the sudden tremble of the shining  lashes that lay against her cheeks; and then, quickly, she caught her  breath, and her hands grew steady in her lap.
  &#8220;Would you mind&#8212;if I asked you first&#8212;to tell me<I> your</I> story  of John Graham?&#8221; she spoke softly. &#8220;I know it, a little, but I think it  would make everything easier if I could hear it from you&#8212;now.&#8221;
  He stood up and looked down upon her where she sat, with the light  playing in her hair; and then he moved to the window, and back, and she  had not changed her position, but was waiting for him to speak. She  raised her eyes, and the question her lips had formed was glowing in  them as clearly as if she had voiced it again in words. A desire rose  in him to speak to her as he had never spoken to another human being,  and to reveal for her&#8212;and for her alone&#8212;the thing that had harbored  itself in his soul for many years. Looking up at him, waiting, partial  understanding softening her sweet face, a dusky glow in her eyes, she  was so beautiful that he cried out softly and then laughed in a strange  repressed sort of way as he half held out his arms toward her.
  &#8220;I think I know how my father must have loved my mother,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;But I can't make you feel it. I can't hope for that. She died when I  was so young that she remained only as a beautiful dream for me. But  for my father she<I> never</I> died, and as I grew older she became  more and more alive for me, so that in our journeys we would talk about  her as if she were waiting for us back home and would welcome us when  we returned. And never could my father remain away from the place where  she was buried very long at a time. He called it<I> home</I>, that  little cup at the foot of the mountain, with the waterfall singing in  summer, and a paradise of birds and flowers keeping her company, and  all the great, wild world she loved about her. There was the cabin,  too; the little cabin where I was born, with its back to the big  mountain, and filled with the handiwork of my mother as she had left it  when she died. And my father too used to laugh and sing there&#8212;he had a  clear voice that would roll half-way up the mountain; and as I grew  older the miracle at times stirred me with a strange fear, so real to  my father did my dead mother seem when he was home. But you look  frightened, Miss Standish! Oh, it may seem weird and ghostly now, but  it was<I> true</I>&#8212;so true that I have lain awake nights thinking of  it and wishing that it had never been so!&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you have wished a great sin,&#8221; said the girl in a voice that  seemed scarcely to whisper between her parted lips. &#8220;I hope someone  will feel toward me&#8212;some day&#8212;like that.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it was this which brought the tragedy, the thing you have asked  me to tell you about,&#8221; he said, unclenching his hands slowly, and then  tightening them again until the blood ebbed from their veins.  &#8220;Interests were coming in; the tentacles of power and greed were  reaching out, encroaching steadily a little nearer to our cup at the  foot of the mountain. But my father did not dream of what might happen.  It came in the spring of the year he took me on my first trip to the  States, when I was eighteen. We were gone five months, and they were  five months of hell for him. Day and night he grieved for my mother and  the little home under the mountain. And when at last we came back&#8212;&#8221;
  He turned again to the window, but he did not see the golden sun of  the tundra or hear Tautuk calling from the corral.
  &#8220;When we came back,&#8221; he repeated in a cold, hard voice, &#8220;a  construction camp of a hundred men had invaded my father's little  paradise. The cabin was gone; a channel had been cut from the  waterfall, and this channel ran where my mother's grave had been. They  had treated it with that same desecration with which they have  destroyed ten thousand Indian graves since then. Her bones were  scattered in the sand and mud. And from the moment my father saw what  had happened, never another sun rose in the heavens for him. His heart  died, yet he went on living&#8212;for a time.&#8221;
  Mary Standish had bowed her face in her hands. He saw the tremor of  her slim shoulders; and when he came back, and she looked up at him, it  was as if he beheld the pallid beauty of one of the white tundra  flowers.
  &#8220;And the man who committed that crime&#8212;was John Graham,&#8221; she said,  in the strangely passionless voice of one who knew what his answer  would be.
  &#8220;Yes, John Graham. He was there, representing big interests in the  States. The foreman had objected to what happened; many of the men had  protested; a few of them, who knew my father, had thrown up their work  rather than be partners to that crime. But Graham had the legal power;  they say he laughed as if he thought it a great joke that a cabin and a  grave should be considered obstacles in his way. And he laughed when my  father and I went to see him; yes,<I> laughed</I>, in that noiseless,  oily, inside way of his, as you might think of a snake laughing.
  &#8220;We found him among the men. My God, you don't know how I hated  him!&#8212;Big, loose, powerful, dangling the watch-fob that hung over his  vest, and looking at my father in that way as he told him what a fool  he was to think a worthless grave should interfere with his work. I  wanted to kill him, but my father put a hand on my shoulder, a quiet,  steady hand, and said: 'It is my duty, Alan.<I> My duty</I>.'
  &#8220;And then&#8212;it happened. My father was older, much older than Graham,  but God put such strength in him that day as I had never seen before,  and with his naked hands he would have killed the brute if I had not  unlocked them with my own. Before all his men Graham became a mass of  helpless pulp, and from the ground, with the last of the breath that  was in him, he cursed my father, and he cursed me. He said that all the  days of his life he would follow us, until we paid a thousand times for  what we had done. And then my father dragged him as he would have  dragged a rat to the edge of a piece of bush, and there he tore his  clothes from him until the brute was naked; and in that nakedness he  scourged him with whips until his arms were weak, and John Graham was  unconscious and like a great hulk of raw beef. When it was over, we  went into the mountains.&#8221;
  During the terrible recital Mary Standish had not looked away from  him, and now her hands were clenched like his own, and her eyes and  face were aflame, as if she wanted to leap up and strike at something  unseen between them.
  &#8220;And after that, Alan; after that&#8212;&#8221;
  She did not know that she had spoken his name, and he, hearing it,  scarcely understood.
  &#8220;John Graham kept his promise,&#8221; he answered grimly. &#8220;The influence  and money behind him haunted us wherever we went. My father had been  successful, but one after another the properties in which he was  interested were made worthless. A successful mine in which he was most  heavily interested was allowed to become abandoned. A hotel which he  partly owned in Dawson was bankrupted. One after another things  happened, and after each happening my father would receive a polite  note of regret from Graham, written as if the word actually came from a  friend. But my father cared little for money losses now. His heart was  drying up and his life ebbing away for the little cabin and the grave  that were gone from the foot of the mountain. It went on this way for  three years, and then, one morning, my father was found on the beach at  Nome, dead.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Dead</I>!&#8221;
  Alan heard only the gasping breath in which the word came from Mary  Standish, for he was facing the window, looking steadily away from her.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;murdered. I know it was the work of John Graham. He didn't do  it personally, but it was<I> his money</I> that accomplished the end.  Of course nothing ever came of it. I won't tell you how his influence  and power have dogged me; how they destroyed the first herd of reindeer  I had, and how they filled the newspapers with laughter and lies about  me when I was down in the States last winter in an effort to make<I>  your</I> people see a little something of the truth about Alaska. I am  waiting. I know the day is coming when I shall have John Graham as my  father had him under our mountain twenty years ago. He must be fifty  now. But that won't save him when the time comes. No one will loosen my  hands as I loosened my father's. And all Alaska will rejoice, for his  power and his money have become twin monsters that are destroying  Alaska just as he destroyed the life of my father. Unless he dies, and  his money-power ends, he will make of this great land nothing more than  a shell out of which he and his kind have taken all the meat. And the  hour of deadliest danger is now upon us.&#8221;
  He looked at Mary Standish, and it was as if death had come to her  where she sat. She seemed not to breathe, and her face was so white it  frightened him. And then, slowly, she turned her eyes upon him, and  never had he seen such living pools of torture and of horror. He was  amazed at the quietness of her voice when she began to speak, and  startled by the almost deadly coldness of it.
  &#8220;I think you can understand&#8212;now&#8212;why I leaped into the sea, why I  wanted the world to think I was dead, and why I have feared to tell you  the truth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;<I>I am John Graham's wife.</I>&#8220;
