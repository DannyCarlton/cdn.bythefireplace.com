   It was all new&#8212;most of it singularly dramatic and even appalling to  the woman who sat with the pearl-gray veil drawn closely about her  face. For eighteen hours she had been a keenly attentive, wide-eyed,  and partly frightened bit of humanity in this onrush of &#8220;the horde.&#8221;  She had heard a voice behind her speak of it as &#8220;the horde&#8221;&#8212;a deep,  thick, gruff voice which she knew without looking had filtered its way  through a beard. She agreed with the voice. It was the Horde&#8212;that  horde which has always beaten the trails ahead for civilization and  made of its own flesh and blood the foundation of nations. For months  it had been pouring steadily into the mountains&#8212;always in and never  out, a laughing, shouting, singing, blaspheming Horde, every ounce of  it toughened sinew and red brawn, except the Straying Angels. One of  these sat opposite her, a dark-eyed girl with over-red lips and  hollowed cheeks, and she heard the bearded man say something to his  companions about &#8220;dizzy dolls&#8221; and &#8220;the little angel in the other  seat.&#8221; This same voice, gruffened in its beard, had told her that ten  thousand of the Horde had gone up ahead of them. Then it whispered  something that made her hands suddenly tighten and a hot flush sweep  through her. She lifted her veil and rose slowly from her seat, as if  to rearrange her dress. Casually she looked straight into the faces of  the bearded man and his companion in the seat behind. They stared.  After that she heard nothing more of the Straying Angels, but only a  wildly mysterious confabulation about &#8220;rock hogs,&#8221; and &#8220;coyotes&#8221; that  blew up whole mountains, and a hundred and one things about the &#8220;rail  end.&#8221; She learned that it was taking five hundred steers a week to feed  the Horde that lay along the Grand Trunk Pacific between Hogan's Camp  and the sea, and that there were two thousand souls at Tete Jaune  Cache, which until a few months before had slumbered in a century-old  quiet broken only by the Indian and his trade. Then the train stopped  in its twisting trail, and the bearded man and his companion left the  car. As they passed her they glanced down. Again the veil was drawn  close. A shimmering tress of hair had escaped its bondage; that was all  they saw.
  [Illustration: &#8220;Look at MacDonald.... It's not the gold, but  MacDonald, that's taking me north, Ladygray.... Up there, another grave  is calling MacDonald.&#8221;]
  The veiled woman drew a deeper breath when they were gone. She saw  that most of the others were getting off. In her end of the car the  hollow-cheeked girl and she were alone. Even in their aloneness these  two women had not dared to speak until now. The one raised her veil  again, and their eyes met across the aisle. For a moment the big, dark,  sick-looking eyes of the &#8220;angel&#8221; stared. Like the bearded man and his  companion, she, too, understood, and an embarrassed flush added to the  colour of the rouge on her cheeks. The eyes that looked across at her  were blue&#8212;deep, quiet, beautiful. The lifted veil had disclosed to her  a face that she could not associate with the Horde. The lips smiled at  her&#8212;the wonderful eyes softened with a look of understanding, and then  the veil was lowered again. The flush in the girl's cheek died out, and  she smiled back.
  &#8220;You are going to Tete Jaune?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;Yes. May I sit with you for a few minutes? I want to ask  questions&#8212;so many!&#8221;
  The hollow-cheeked girl made room for her at her side.
  &#8220;You are new?&#8221;
  &#8220;Quite new&#8212;to this.&#8221;
  The words, and the manner in which they were spoken, made the other  glance quickly at her companion.
  &#8220;It is a strange place to go&#8212;Tete Jaune,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is a  terrible place for a woman.&#8221;
  &#8220;And yet you are going?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have friends there. Have you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  The girl stared at her in amazement. Her voice and her eyes were  bolder now.
  &#8220;And without friends you are going&#8212;<I>there?</I>&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You  have no husband&#8212;no brother&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What place is this?&#8221; interrupted the other, raising her veil so  that she could look steadily into the other's face. &#8220;Would you mind  telling me?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is Miette,&#8221; replied the girl, the flush reddening her cheeks  again. &#8220;There's one of the big camps of the railroad builders down on  the Flats. You can see it through the window. That river is the  Athabasca.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will the train stop here very long?&#8221;
  The Little Angel shrugged her thin shoulders despairingly.
  &#8220;Long enough to get me into The Cache mighty late to-night,&#8221; she  complained. &#8220;We won't move for two hours.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd be so glad if you could tell me where I can go for a bath and  something to eat. I'm not very hungry&#8212;but I'm terribly dusty. I want  to change some clothes, too. Is there a hotel here?&#8221;
  Her companion found the question very funny. She had a giggling fit  before she answered.
  &#8220;You're sure new,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;We don't have hotels up here. We  have bed-houses, chuck-tents, and bunk-shacks. You ask for Bill's Shack  down there on the Flats. It's pretty good. They'll give you a room,  plenty of water, and a looking-glass&#8212;an' charge you a dollar. I'd go  with you, but I'm expecting a friend a little later, and if I move I  may lose him. Anybody will tell you where Bill's place is. It's a red  an' white striped tent&#8212;and it's respectable.&#8221;
  The stranger girl thanked her, and turned for her bag. As she left  the car, the Little Angel's eyes followed her with a malicious gleam  that gave them the strange glow of candles in a sepulchral cavern. The  colours which she unfurled to all seeking eyes were not secret, and yet  she was filled with an inward antagonism that this stranger with the  wonderful blue eyes had dared to see them and recognize them. She  stared after the retreating form&#8212;a tall, slim, exquisitely poised  figure that filled her with envy and a dull sort of hatred. She did not  hear a step behind her. A hand fell familiarly on her shoulder, and a  coarse voice laughed something in her ear that made her jump up with an  artificial little shriek of pleasure. The man nodded toward the end of  the now empty car.
  &#8220;Who's your new friend?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;She's no friend of mine,&#8221; snapped the girl. &#8220;She's another one of  them Dolly Dimples come out to save the world. She's that innocent she  wonders why Tete Jaune ain't a nice place for ladies without escort. I  thought I'd help eggicate her a little an' so I sent her to Bill's  place. Oh, my Lord, I told her it was respectable!&#8221;
  She doubled over the seat in a fit of merriment, and her companion  seized the opportunity to look out of the window.
  The tall, blue-eyed stranger had paused for a moment on the last  step of the car to pin up her veil, fully revealing her face. Then she  stepped lightly to the ground, and found herself facing the sunlight  and the mountains. She drew a slow, deep breath between her parted  lips, and turned wonderingly, for a moment forgetful. It was the first  time she had left the train since entering the mountains, and she  understood now why some one in the coach had spoken of the Miette Plain  as Sunshine Pool. Where-ever she looked the mountains fronted her, with  their splendid green slopes reaching up to their bald caps of gray  shale and reddish rock or gleaming summits of snow. Into this  &#8220;pool&#8221;&#8212;this pocket in the mountains&#8212;the sun descended in a wonderful  flood. It stirred her blood like a tonic. She breathed more quickly; a  soft glow coloured her cheeks; her eyes grew more deeply violet as they  caught the reflection of the blue sky. A gentle wind fretted the loose  tendrils of brown hair about her face. And the bearded man, staring  through the car window, saw her thus, and for an hour after that the  hollow-cheeked girl wondered at the strange change in him.
  The train had stopped at the edge of the big fill overlooking the  Flats. It was a heavy train, and a train that was helping to make  history&#8212;a combination of freight, passenger, and &#8220;cattle.&#8221; It had  averaged eight miles an hour on its climb toward Yellowhead Pass and  the end of steel. The &#8220;cattle&#8221; had already surged from their stifling  and foul-smelling cars in a noisy inundation of curiously mixed  humanity. They were of a dozen different nationalities, and as the girl  looked at them it was not with revulsion or scorn but with a sudden  quickening of heartbeat and a little laugh that had in it something  both of wonder and of pride. This was the Horde, that crude, monstrous  thing of primitive strength and passions that was overturning mountains  in its fight to link the new Grand Trunk Pacific with the seaport on  the Pacific. In that Horde, gathered in little groups, shifting,  sweeping slowly toward her and past her, she saw something as  omnipotent as the mountains themselves. They could not know defeat. She  sensed it without ever having seen them before. For her the Horde now  had a heart and a soul. These were the builders of empire&#8212;the  man-beasts who made it possible for Civilization to creep warily and  without peril into new places and new worlds. With a curious shock she  thought of the half-dozen lonely little wooden crosses she had seen  through the car window at odd places along the line of rail.
  And now she sought her way toward the Flats. To do this she had to  climb over a track that was waiting for ballast. A car shunted past  her, and on its side she saw the big, warning red placards&#8212;Dynamite.  That one word seemed to breathe to her the spirit of the wonderful  energy that was expending itself all about her. From farther on in the  mountains came the deep, sullen detonations of the &#8220;little black giant&quot;  that had been rumbling past her in the car. It came again and again,  like the thunderous voice of the mountains themselves calling out in  protest and defiance. And each time she felt a curious thrill under her  feet and the palpitant touch of something that was like a gentle breath  in her ears. She found another track on her way, and other cars slipped  past her crunchingly. Beyond this second track she came to a beaten  road that led down into the Flats, and she began to descend.
  [Illustration: A tall, slim, exquisitely poised figure.... &#8220;Another  o' them Dotty Dimples come out to save the world. I thought I'd help  eggicate her a little, an' so I sent her to Bill's place. Oh, my Lord,  I told her it was respectable!&#8221;]
  Tents shone through the trees on the bottom. The rattle of the cars  grew more distant, and she heard the hum and laughter of voices and the  jargon of a phonograph. At the bottom of the slope she stepped aside to  allow a team and wagon to pass. The wagon was loaded with boxes that  rattled and crashed about as the wheels bumped over stones and roots.  The driver of the team did not look at her. He was holding back with  his whole weight; his eyes bulged a little; he was sweating, in his  face was a comedy of expression that made the girl smile in spite of  herself. Then she saw one of the bobbing boxes and the smile froze into  a look of horror. On it was painted that ominous word&#8212;DYNAMITE!
  Two men were coming behind her.
  &#8220;Six horses, a wagon an' old Fritz&#8212;blown to hell an' not a splinter  left to tell the story,&#8221; one of them was saying. &#8220;I was there three  minutes after the explosion and there wasn't even a ravelling or a  horsehair left. This dynamite's a dam' funny thing. I wouldn't be a  rock-hog for a million!&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd rather be a rock-hog than Joe&#8212;drivin' down this hill a dozen  times a day,&#8221; replied the other.
  The girl had paused again, and the two men stared at her as they  were about to pass. The explosion of Joe's dynamite could not have  startled them more than the beauty of the face that was turned to them  in a quietly appealing inquiry.
  &#8220;I am looking for a place called&#8212;Bill's Shack,&#8221; she said, speaking  the Little Sister's words hesitatingly. &#8220;Can you direct me to it,  please?&#8221;
  The younger of the two men looked at his companion without speaking.  The other, old enough to regard feminine beauty as a trap and an  illusion, turned aside to empty his mouth of a quid of tobacco, bent  over, and pointed under the trees.
  &#8220;Can't miss it&#8212;third tent-house on your right, with canvas striped  like a barber-pole. That phonnygraff you hear is at Bill's.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
  She went on.
  Behind her, the two men stood where she had left them. They did not  move. The younger man seemed scarcely to breathe.
  &#8220;Bill's place!&#8221; he gasped then. &#8220;I've a notion to tell her. I can't  believe&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Shucks!&#8221; interjected the other.
  &#8220;But I don't. She isn't that sort. She looked like a Madonna&#8212;with  the heart of her clean gone. I never saw anything so white an' so  beautiful. You call me a fool if you want to&#8212;I'm goin' on to Bill's!&#8221;
  He strode ahead, chivalry in his young and palpitating heart.  Quickly the older man was at his side, clutching his arm.
  &#8220;Come along, you cotton-head!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You ain't old enough or  big enough in this camp to mix in with Bill. Besides,&#8221; he lied, seeing  the wavering light in the youth's eyes, &#8220;I know her. She's going to the  right place.&#8221;
  At Bill's place men were holding their breath and staring. They were  not unaccustomed to women. But such a one as this vision that walked  calmly and undisturbed in among them they had never seen. There were  half a dozen lounging there, smoking and listening to the phonograph,  which some one now stopped that they might hear every word that was  spoken. The girl's head was high. She was beginning to understand that  it would have been less embarrassing to have gone hungry and dusty. But  she had come this far, and she was determined to get what she  wanted&#8212;if it was to be had. The colour shone a little more vividly  through the pure whiteness of her skin as she faced Bill, leaning over  his little counter. In him she recognized the Brute. It was blazoned in  his face, in the hungry, seeking look of his eyes&#8212;in the heavy pouches  and thick crinkles of his neck and cheeks. For once Bill Quade himself  was at a loss.
  &#8220;I understand that you have rooms for rent,&#8221; she said unemotionally.  &#8220;May I hire one until the train leaves for Tete Jaune Cache?&#8221;
  The listeners behind her stiffened and leaned forward. One of them  grinned at Quade. This gave him the confidence he needed to offset the  fearless questioning in the blue eyes. None of them noticed a newcomer  in the door. Quade stepped from behind his shelter and faced her.
  &#8220;This way,&#8221; he said, and turned to the drawn curtains beyond them.
  She followed. As the curtains closed after them a chuckling laugh  broke the silence of the on-looking group. The newcomer in the doorway  emptied the bowl of his pipe, and thrust the pipe into the  breast-pocket of his flannel shirt. He was bareheaded. His hair was  blond, shot a little with gray. He was perhaps thirty-eight, no taller  than the girl herself, slim-waisted, with trim, athletic shoulders. His  eyes, as they rested on the still-fluttering curtains, were a cold and  steady gray. His face was thin and bronzed, his nose a trifle  prominent. He was a man far from handsome, and yet there was something  of fascination and strength about him. He did not belong to the Horde.  Yet he might have been the force behind it, contemptuous of the  chuckling group of rough-visaged men, almost arrogant in his posture as  he eyed the curtains and waited.
  What he expected soon came. It was not the usual giggling, the usual  exchange of badinage and coarse jest beyond the closed curtains. Quade  did not come out rubbing his huge hands, his face crinkling with a sort  of exultant satisfaction. The girl preceded him. She flung the curtains  aside and stood there for a moment, her face flaming like fire, her  blue eyes filled with the flash of lightning. She came down the single  step. Quade followed her. He put out a hand.
  &#8220;Don't take offence, girly,&#8221; he expostulated. &#8220;Look here&#8212;ain't it  reasonable to s'pose&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He got no farther. The man in the door had advanced, placing himself  at the girl's side. His voice was low and unexcited.
  &#8220;You have made a mistake?&#8221; he said.
  She took him in at a glance&#8212;his clean-cut, strangely attractive  face, his slim build, the clear and steady gray of his eyes.
  &#8220;Yes, I have made a mistake&#8212;a terrible mistake!&#8221;
  &#8220;I tell you it ain't fair to take offence,&#8221; Quade went on. &#8220;Now,  look here&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  In his hand was a roll of bills. The girl did not know that a man  could strike as quickly and with as terrific effect as the gray-eyed  stranger struck then. There was one blow, and Quade went down limply.  It was so sudden that he had her outside before she realized what had  happened.
  &#8220;I chanced to see you go in,&#8221; he explained, without a tremor in his  voice. &#8220;I thought you were making a mistake. I heard you ask for  shelter. If you will come with me I will take you to a friend's.&#8221;
  &#8220;If it isn't too much trouble for you, I will go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And  for that&#8212;in there&#8212;thank you!&#8221;
