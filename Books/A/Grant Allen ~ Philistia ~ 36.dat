Ernest's unexpected success with 'London's Shame' was not, as Arthur  Berkeley at first feared it might be, the mere last dying flicker  of a weak and failing life. Arthur was quite right, indeed, when  he said one day to Lady Hilda that its very brilliancy and fervour  had the hectic glow about it, as of a man who was burning himself  out too fiercely and rapidly; you could read the feverish eagerness  of the writer in every line; but still, Lady Hilda answered with  her ordinary calm assurance that it was all going well, and that  Ernest only needed the sense of security to pull him round again;  and as usual, Lady Hilda's practical sagacity was not at fault.  The big pamphlet--for it was hardly more than that--soon proved  an opening for further work, in procuring which Hilda and Arthur  were again partially instrumental. An advanced Radical member  of Parliament, famous for his declamations against the capitalist  faction, and his enormous holding of English railway stock, was  induced to come forward as the founder of a new weekly paper,  'in the interest of social reform.' Of course the thing was got  up solely with an idea to utilising Ernest as editor, for, said  the great anti-capitalist with his usual charming frankness, 'the  young fellow has a positive money-value, now, if he's taken in hand  at once before the sensation's over, and there can be no harm in  turning an honest penny by exploiting him, you know, and starting  a popular paper.' When Ernest was offered the post of editor to  the new periodical, at a salary which almost alarmed him by its  plutocratic magnificence (for it was positively no less than six  hundred a year), he felt for a moment some conscientious scruples  about accepting so splendid a post. And when Lady Hilda in her  emphatic fashion promptly over-ruled these nascent scruples by the  application of the very simple solvent formula, 'Bosh!' he felt  bound at least to stipulate that he should be at perfect liberty  to say whatever he liked in the new paper, without interference or  supervision from the capitalist proprietor. To which the Radical  member, in his business capacity, immediately responded, 'Why,  certainly. What we want to pay you for is just your power of startling  people, which, in its proper place, is a very useful marketable  commodity. Every pig has its value--if only you sell it in the  best market.'    
'The Social Reformer, a Weekly Advocate of the New Economy,' achieved  at once an immense success among the working classes, and grew  before long to be one of the most popular journals of the second  rank in all London. The interest that Ernest had aroused by his big  pamphlet was carried on to his new venture, which soon managed to  gain many readers by its own intrinsic merits. 'Seen your brother's  revolutionary broadsheet, Le Breton?' asked a friend at the club  of Herbert not many weeks later--he was the same person who had  found it 'so very embarrassing' to recognise Ernest--in his shabby  days when walking with a Q.C.--'It's a dreadful tissue of the  reddest French communism, I believe, but still, it's scored the  biggest success of its sort in journalism, I'm told, since the  days of Kenealy's "Englishman." Bradbury, who's found the money to  start it--deuced clever fellow in his way, Bradbury!--is making an  awful lot out of the speculation, they say. What do you think of  the paper, eh?'    
Herbert drew himself up grimly. 'To tell you the truth,' he said  in his stiffest style, 'I haven't yet had time to look at a copy.  Ernest Le Breton's not a man in whose affairs I feel called upon to  take any special interest; and I haven't put myself to the trouble  of reading his second-hand political lucubrations. Faint echoes of  Max Schurz, all of it, no doubt; and having read and disposed of  Schurz himself long ago, I don't feel inclined now to go in for a  second supplementary course of Schurz and water.'    
'Well, well, that may be so,' the friend answered, turning over the  pages of the peccant periodical carelessly; 'but all the same I'm  afraid your brother's really going to do an awful lot of mischief  in the way of setting class against class, and stirring up the  dangerous orders to recognise their own power. You see, Le Breton,  the real danger of this sort of thing lies in the fact that your  brother Ernest's a more or less educated and cultivated person. I  don't say he's really got any genuine depth of culture--would you  believe it, he told me once he'd never read Rabelais, and didn't  want to?--and of course a man of true culture in the grain, like  you and me now, my dear fellow, would never dream of going and  mistaking these will-o'-the-wisps of socialism for the real guiding  light of regenerated humanity--of course not. But the dangerous  symptom at the present day lies just in the fact that while the  papers written for the mob used to be written by vulgar, noisy,  self-made, half-educated demagogues, they're sent out now with all  the authority and specious respectability of decently instructed  and comparatively literary English gentlemen. Now, nobody can  deny that that's a thing very seriously to be regretted; and for my  part I'm extremely sorry your brother has been ill-advised enough  to join the mob that's trying to pull down our comfortably built  and after all eminently respectable, even if somewhat patched up,  old British constitution.'    
'The subject's one,' Herbert answered curtly, 'in which I for my  part cannot pretend to feel the remotest personal interest.'    
Ernest and Edie, howerer, in the little lodgings up at Holloway,  which they couldn't bear to desert even now in this sudden burst  of incredible prosperity, went their own way as self-containedly  as usual, wholly unconcerned by the non-arrival of Mrs. Herbert  on a visit of ceremony, or the failure of the 'Social Reformer' to  pierce the lofty ethereal regions of abstract contemplation where  Herbert himself sat throned like an Epicurean god in the pure halo  of cultivated pococurantism. Every day, as that eminent medical  authority, Hilda Tregellis, had truly prophesied, Ernest's cheeks  grew less and less sunken, and a little colour returned slowly  to their midst; while Edie's face was less pale than of old, and  her smile began to recover something of its old-fashioned girlish  joyousness. She danced about once more as of old, and Arthur Berkeley,  when he dropped in of a Sunday afternoon for a chat with Ernest,  noticed with pleasure that little Miss Butterfly was beginning to  flit round again almost as naturally as in the old days when he  first saw her light little form among the grey old pillars of Magdalen  Cloisters. Yet he couldn't help observing, too, that his feeling  towards her was more one of mere benevolence now, and less of tender  regret, than it used to be even a few short months before, in the  darkest days of Edie's troubles. Could it be, he asked himself  more than once, that the tall stately picture of Hilda Tregellis  was overshadowing in his heart the natural photograph of that  unwedded Edie Oswald that he once imagined was so firmly imprinted  there? Ah well, ah well, it may be true that a man can love really  but once in his whole lifetime; and yet, the second spurious  imitation is positively sometimes a very good facsimile of the  genuine first impression, for all that.    
As the months went slowly round, too, the time came in the end for  good Herr Max to be released at last from his long imprisonment.  On the day that he came out, there was a public banquet at the  Marylebone dancing saloon; and all the socialists and communards  were there, and all the Russian nihilists, and all the other  wicked revolutionary plotters in all London: and in the chair sat  Ernest Le Breton, now the editor of an important social paper, while  at his left hand, to balance the guest of the evening, sat Arthur  Berkeley, the well-known dramatic author, who was himself more than  suspected of being the timid Nicodemus of the new faith. And when  Ernest announced that Herr Schurz had consented to aid him on the  'Social Reformer,' and to add the wisdom of age to the impetuosity  of youth in conducting its future, the simple enthusiasm of the wicked  revolutionists knew no bounds. And they cried 'Hoch!' and 'Viva!'  and 'Hooray!' and many other like inarticulate shouts in many  varieties of interjectional dialect all the evening; and everybody  agreed that after all Herr Max was <i>very</i> little grayer than before  the trial, in spite of his long and terrible term of imprisonment.    
He <i>was</i> a little embittered by his troubles, no doubt;--what can  you expect if you clap men in prison for the expression of their  honest political convictions?--but Ernest tried to keep his eye  steadily rather on the future than on the past; and with greater  ease and unwonted comforts the old man's cheerfulness as well as  his enthusiasm gradually returned. 'I'm too old now to do anything  more worth doing myself before I die,' he used to say, holding  Ernest's arm tightly in his vice-like grip: 'but I have great hopes  in spite of everything for friend Ernest; I have very great hopes  indeed for friend Ernest here. There's no knowing yet what he may  accomplish.'    
Ernest only smiled a trifle sadly, and murmured half to himself that  this was a hard world, and he began himself to fear there was no  fitting feeling for a social reformer except one of a brave despair.  'We can do little or nothing, after all,' he said slowly; 'and  our only consolation must be that even that little is perhaps just  worth doing.'
