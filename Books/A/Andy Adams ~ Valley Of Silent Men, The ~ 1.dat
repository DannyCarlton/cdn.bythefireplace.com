   In the mind of James Grenfell Kent, sergeant in the Royal   Northwest Mounted Police, there remained no shadow of a doubt. He   knew that he was dying. He had implicit faith in Cardigan, his   surgeon friend, and Cardigan had told him that what was left of  his  life would be measured out in hours&#8212;perhaps in minutes or  seconds. It  was an unusual case. There was one chance in fifty  that he might live  two or three days, but there was no chance at  all that he would live  more than three. The end might come with  any breath he drew into his  lungs. That was the pathological  history of the thing, as far as  medical and surgical science knew  of cases similar to his own. 
  Personally, Kent did not feel like a dying man. His vision and his   brain were clear. He felt no pain, and only at infrequent  intervals  was his temperature above normal. His voice was  particularly calm and  natural. 
  At first he had smiled incredulously when Cardigan broke the news.   That the bullet which a drunken half-breed had sent into his chest   two weeks before had nicked the arch of the aorta, thus forming an   aneurism, was a statement by Cardigan which did not sound  especially  wicked or convincing to him. &quot;Aorta&quot; and &quot;aneurism&quot;  held about as much  significance for him as his perichondrium or  the process of his  stylomastoid. But Kent possessed an unswerving  passion to grip at  facts in detail, a characteristic that had  largely helped him to earn  the reputation of being the best man-  hunter in all the northland  service. So he had insisted, and his  surgeon friend had explained. 
  The aorta, he found, was the main blood-vessel arching over and   leading from the heart, and in nicking it the bullet had so  weakened  its outer wall that it bulged out in the form of a sack,  just as the  inner tube of an automobile tire bulges through the  outer casing when  there is a blowout. 
  &quot;And when that sack gives way inside you,&quot; Cardigan had explained,   &quot;you'll go like that!&quot; He snapped a forefinger and thumb to drive  the  fact home. 
  After that it was merely a matter of common sense to believe, and   now, sure that he was about to die. Kent had acted. He was acting  in  the full health of his mind and in extreme cognizance of the   paralyzing shock he was contributing as a final legacy to the  world  at large, or at least to that part of it which knew him or  was  interested. The tragedy of the thing did not oppress him. A  thousand  times in his life he had discovered that humor and  tragedy were very  closely related, and that there were times when  only the breadth of a  hair separated the two. Many times he had  seen a laugh change suddenly  to tears, and tears to laughter. 
  The tableau, as it presented itself about his bedside now, amused   him. Its humor was grim, but even in these last hours of his life  he  appreciated it. He had always more or less regarded life as a  joke&#8212;a  very serious joke, but a joke for all that&#8212;a whimsical  and trickful  sort of thing played by the Great Arbiter on humanity  at large; and  this last count in his own life, as it was solemnly  and tragically  ticking itself off, was the greatest joke of all.  The amazed faces  that stared at him, their passing moments of  disbelief, their  repressed but at times visible betrayals of  horror, the steadiness of  their eyes, the tenseness of their lips  &#8212;all added to what he might  have called, at another time, the  dramatic artistry of his last great  adventure. 
  That he was dying did not chill him, or make him afraid, or put a   tremble into his voice. The contemplation of throwing off the mere   habit of breathing had never at any stage of his thirty-six years  of  life appalled him. Those years, because he had spent a  sufficient  number of them in the raw places of the earth, had  given him a  philosophy and viewpoint of his own, both of which he  kept unto  himself without effort to impress them on other people.  He believed  that life itself was the cheapest thing on the face of  all the earth.  All other things had their limitations. 
  There was so much water and so much land, so many mountains and so   many plains, so many square feet to live on and so many square  feet  to be buried in. All things could be measured, and stood up,  and  catalogued&#8212;except life itself. &quot;Given time,&quot; he would say, &quot;a  single  pair of humans can populate all creation.&quot; Therefore, being  the  cheapest of all things, it was true philosophy that life  should be the  easiest of all things to give up when the necessity  came. 
  Which is only another way of emphasizing that Kent was not, and   never had been, afraid to die. But it does not say that he  treasured  life a whit less than the man in another room, who, a  day or so  before, had fought like a lunatic before going under an  anesthetic for  the amputation of a bad finger. No man had loved  life more than he. No  man had lived nearer it. 
  It had been a passion with him. Full of dreams, and always with   anticipations ahead, no matter how far short realizations fell, he   was an optimist, a lover of the sun and the moon and the stars, a   worshiper of the forests and of the mountains, a man who loved his   life, and who had fought for it, and yet who was ready&#8212;at the   last&#8212;to yield it up without a whimper when the fates asked for  it. 
  Bolstered up against his pillows, he did not look the part of the   fiend he was confessing himself to be to the people about him.   Sickness had not emaciated him. The bronze of his lean, clean-cut   face had faded a little, but the tanning of wind and sun and  campfire  was still there. His blue eyes were perhaps dulled  somewhat by the  nearness of death. One would not have judged him  to be thirty-six,  even though over one temple there was a streak  of gray in his blond  hair&#8212;a heritage from his mother, who was  dead. Looking at him, as his  lips quietly and calmly confessed  himself beyond the pale of men's  sympathy or forgiveness, one  would have said that his crime was  impossible. 
  Through his window, as he sat bolstered up in his cot, Kent could   see the slow-moving shimmer of the great Athabasca River as it  moved  on its way toward the Arctic Ocean. The sun was shining, and  he saw  the cool, thick masses of the spruce and cedar forests  beyond, the  rising undulations of wilderness ridges and hills, and  through that  open window he caught the sweet scents that came with  a soft wind from  out of the forests he had loved for so many  years. 
  &quot;They've been my best friends,&quot; he had said to Cardigan, &quot;and when   this nice little thing you're promising happens to me, old man, I   want to go with my eyes on them.&quot; 
  So his cot was close to the window. 
  Nearest to him sat Cardigan. In his face, more than in any of the   others, was disbelief. Kedsty, Inspector of the Royal Northwest   Mounted Police, in charge of N Division during an indefinite leave  of  absence of the superintendent, was paler even than the girl  whose  nervous fingers were swiftly putting upon paper every word  that was  spoken by those in the room. O'Connor, staff-sergeant,  was like one  struck dumb. The little, smooth-faced Catholic  missioner whose  presence as a witness Kent had requested, sat with  his thin fingers  tightly interlaced, silently placing this among  all the other strange  tragedies that the wilderness had given up  to him. They had all been  Kent's friends, his intimate friends,  with the exception of the girl,  whom Inspector Kedsty had borrowed  for the occasion. With the little  missioner he had spent many an  evening, exchanging in mutual  confidence the strange and  mysterious happenings of the deep forests,  and of the great north  beyond the forests. O'Connor's friendship was a  friendship bred of  the brotherhood of the trails. It was Kent and  O'Connor who had  brought down the two Eskimo murderers from the mouth  of the  Mackenzie, and the adventure had taken them fourteen months.  Kent  loved O'Connor, with his red face, his red hair, and his big   heart, and to him the most tragic part of it all was that he was   breaking this friendship now. 
  But it was Inspector Kedsty, commanding N Division, the biggest   and wildest division in all the Northland, that roused in Kent an   unusual emotion, even as he waited for that explosion just over  his  heart which the surgeon had told him might occur at any  moment. On his  death-bed his mind still worked analytically. And  Kedsty, since the  moment he had entered the room, had puzzled  Kent. The commander of N  Division was an unusual man. He was  sixty, with iron-gray hair, cold,  almost colorless eyes in which  one would search long for a gleam of  either mercy or fear, and a  nerve that Kent had never seen even  slightly disturbed. It took  such a man, an iron man, to run N Division  according to law, for N  Division covered an area of six hundred and  twenty thousand square  miles of wildest North America, extending more  than two thousand  miles north of the 70th parallel of latitude, with  its farthest  limit three and one-half degrees within the Arctic  Circle. To  police this area meant upholding the law in a country  fourteen  times the size of the state of Ohio. And Kedsty was the man  who  had performed this duty as only one other man had ever succeeded   in doing it. 
  Yet Kedsty, of the five about Kent, was most disturbed. His face   was ash-gray. A number of times Kent had detected a broken note in   his voice. He had seen his hands grip at the arms of the chair he  sat  in until the cords stood out on them as if about to burst. He  had  never seen Kedsty sweat until now. 
  Twice the Inspector had wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. He   was no longer Minisak&#8212;&quot;The Rock&quot;&#8212;a name given to him by the  Crees.  The armor that no shaft had ever penetrated seemed to have  dropped  from him. He had ceased to be Kedsty, the most dreaded  inquisitor in  the service. He was nervous, and Kent could see that  he was fighting  to repossess himself. 
  &quot;Of course you know what this means to the Service,&quot; he said in a   hard, low voice. &quot;It means&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Disgrace,&quot; nodded Kent. &quot;I know. It means a black spot on the   otherwise bright escutcheon of N Division. But it can't be helped.  I  killed John Barkley. The man you've got in the guard-house,  condemned  to be hanged by the neck until he is dead, is innocent.  I understand.  It won't be nice for the Service to let it be known  that a sergeant in  His Majesty's Royal Mounted is an ordinary  murderer, but&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Not an ORDINARY murderer,&quot; interrupted Kedsty. &quot;As you have   described it, the crime was deliberate&#8212;horrible and inexcusable  to  its last detail. You were not moved by a sudden passion. You  tortured  your victim. It is inconceivable!&quot; 
  &quot;And yet true,&quot; said Kent. 
  He was looking at the stenographer's slim fingers as they put down   his words and Kedsty's. A bit of sunshine touched her bowed head,  and  he observed the red lights in her hair. His eyes swept to  O'Connor,  and in that moment the commander of N Division bent over  him, so close  that his face almost touched Kent's, and he  whispered, in a voice so  low that no one of the other four could  hear, 
  &quot;KENT&#8212;YOU LIE!&quot; 
  &quot;No, it is true,&quot; replied Kent. 
  Kedsty drew back, again wiping the moisture from his forehead. 
  &quot;I killed Barkley, and I killed him as I planned that he should   die,&quot; Kent went on. &quot;It was my desire that he should suffer. The  one  thing which I shall not tell you is WHY I killed him. But it  was a  sufficient reason.&quot; 
  He saw the shuddering tremor that swept through the shoulders of   the girl who was putting down the condemning notes. 
  &quot;And you refuse to confess your motive?&quot; 
  &quot;Absolutely&#8212;except that he had wronged me in a way that deserved   death.&quot; 
  &quot;And you make this confession knowing that you are about to die?&quot; 
  The flicker of a smile passed over Kent's lips. He looked at   O'Connor and for an instant saw in O'Connor's eyes a flash of  their  old comradeship. 
  &quot;Yes. Dr. Cardigan has told me. Otherwise I should have let the   man in the guard-house hang. It's simply that this accursed bullet   has spoiled my luck&#8212;and saved him!&quot; 
  Kedsty spoke to the girl. For half an hour she read her notes, and   after that Kent wrote his name on the last page. Then Kedsty rose   from his chair. 
  &quot;We have finished, gentlemen,&quot; he said. 
  They trailed out, the girl hurrying through the door first in her   desire to free herself of an ordeal that had strained every nerve  in  her body. The commander of N Division was last to go. Cardigan   hesitated, as if to remain, but Kedsty motioned him on. It was  Kedsty  who closed the door, and as he closed it he looked back,  and for a  flash Kent met his eyes squarely. In that moment he  received an  impression which he had not caught while the Inspector  was in the  room. It was like an electrical shock in its  unexpectedness, and  Kedsty must have seen the effect of it in his  face, for he moved back  quickly and closed the door. In that  instant Kent had seen in Kedsty's  eyes and face a look that was  not only of horror, but what in the face  and eyes of another man  he would have sworn was fear. 
  It was a gruesome moment in which to smile, but Kent smiled. The   shock was over. By the rules of the Criminal Code he knew that  Kedsty  even now was instructing Staff-Sergeant O'Connor to detail  an officer  to guard his door. The fact that he was ready to pop  off at any moment  would make no difference in the regulations of  the law. And Kedsty was  a stickler for the law as it was written.  Through the closed door he  heard voices indistinctly. Then there  were footsteps, dying away. He  could hear the heavy thump, thump  of O'Connor's big feet. O'Connor had  always walked like that, even  on the trail. 
  Softly then the door reopened, and Father Layonne, the little   missioner, came in. Kent knew that this would be so, for Father   Layonne knew neither code nor creed that did not reach all the  hearts  of the wilderness. He came back, and sat down close to  Kent, and took  one of his hands and held it closely in both of his  own. They were not  the soft, smooth hands of the priestly  hierarchy, but were hard with  the callosity of toil, yet gentle  with the gentleness of a great  sympathy. He had loved Kent  yesterday, when Kent had stood clean in  the eyes of both God and  men, and he still loved him today, when his  soul was stained with  a thing that must be washed away with his own  life. 
  &quot;I'm sorry, lad,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; 
  Something rose up in Kent's throat that was not the blood he had   been wiping away since morning. His fingers returned the pressure  of  the little missioner's hands. Then he pointed out through the  window  to the panorama of shimmering river and green forests. 
  &quot;It is hard to say good-by to all that, Father,&quot; he said. &quot;But, if   you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it. I'm not afraid of  it.  And why be unhappy because one has only a little while to  live?  Looking back over your life, does it seem so very long ago  that you  were a boy, a small boy?&quot; 
  &quot;The time has gone swiftly, very swiftly.&quot; 
  &quot;It seems only yesterday&#8212;or so?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, only yesterday&#8212;or so.&quot; 
  Kent's face lit up with the whimsical smile that long ago had   reached the little missioner's heart. &quot;Well, that's the way I'm   looking at it, Father. There is only a yesterday, a today, and a   tomorrow in the longest of our lives. Looking back from seventy  years  isn't much different from looking back from thirty-six WHEN  you're  looking back and not ahead. Do you think what I have just  said will  free Sandy McTrigger?&quot; 
  &quot;There is no doubt. Your statements have been accepted as a death-   bed confession.&quot; 
  The little missioner, instead of Kent, was betraying a bit of   nervousness. 
  &quot;There are matters, my son&#8212;some few matters&#8212;which you will want   attended to. Shall we not talk about them?&quot; 
  &quot;You mean&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Your people, first. I remember that once you told me there was no   one. But surely there is some one somewhere.&quot; 
  Kent shook his head. &quot;There is no one now. For ten years those   forests out there have been father, mother, and home to me.&quot; 
  &quot;But there must be personal affairs, affairs which you would like   to entrust, perhaps, to me?&quot; 
  Kent's face brightened, and for an instant a flash of humor leaped   into his eyes. &quot;It is funny,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Since you remind me of   it, Father, it is quite in form to make my will. I've bought a few   little pieces of land here. Now that the railroad has almost  reached  us from Edmonton, they've jumped up from the seven or  eight hundred  dollars I gave for them to about ten thousand. I  want you to sell the  lots and use the money in your work. Put as  much of it on the Indians  as you can. They've always been good  brothers to me. And I wouldn't  waste much time in getting my  signature on some sort of paper to that  effect.&quot; 
  Father Layonne's eyes shone softly. &quot;God will bless you for that,   Jimmy,&quot; he said, using the intimate name by which he had known  him.  &quot;And I think He is going to pardon you for something else, if  you have  the courage to ask Him.&quot; 
  &quot;I am pardoned,&quot; replied Kent, looking out through the window. &quot;I   feel it. I know it, Father.&quot; 
  In his soul the little missioner was praying. He knew that Kent's   religion was not his religion, and he did not press the service  which  he would otherwise have rendered. After a moment he rose to  his feet,  and it was the old Kent who looked up into his face, the  clean-faced,  gray-eyed, unafraid Kent, smiling in the old way. 
  &quot;I have one big favor to ask of you, Father,&quot; he said. &quot;If I've   got a day to live, I don't want every one forcing the fact on me  that  I'm dying. If I've any friends left, I want them to come in  and see  me, and talk, and crack jokes. I want to smoke my pipe.  I'll  appreciate a box of cigars if you'll send 'em up. Cardigan  can't  object now. Will you arrange these things for me? They'll  listen to  you&#8212;and please shove my cot a little nearer the window  before you  go.&quot; 
  Father Layonne performed the service in silence. Then at last the   yearning overcame him to have the soul speak out, that his God  might  be more merciful, and he said: &quot;My boy, you are sorry? You  repent that  you killed John Barkley?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I'm not sorry. It had to be done. And please don't forget the   cigars, will you, Father?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I won't forget,&quot; said the little missioner, and turned away. 
  As the door opened and closed behind him, the flash of humor   leaped into Kent's eyes again, and he chuckled even as he wiped   another of the telltale stains of blood from his lips. He had  played  the game. And the funny part about it was that no one in  all the world  would ever know, except himself&#8212;and perhaps one  other.
