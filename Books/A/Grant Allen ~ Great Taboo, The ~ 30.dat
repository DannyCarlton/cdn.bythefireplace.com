The great god had wounded him. But not to the heart. Felix, as good luck  would have it, happened to be wearing buckled braces. He had worn them on  board, and, like the rest of his costume, had, of course, never since  been able to discard them. They stood him in good stead now. The buckle  caught the very point of the bone-tipped spear, and broke the force of  the blow, as the great god lunged forward. The wound was but a graze, and  Tu-Kila-Kila's light shaft snapped short in the middle.    
Madder and wilder than ever, the savage pitched it away, yelling, rushed  forward with a fierce curse on his angry tongue, and flung himself, tooth  and nail, on his astonished opponent.    
The suddenness of the onslaught almost took the Englishman's breath away.  By this time, however, Felix had pulled together his ideas and taken in  the situation. Tu-Kila-Kila was attacking him now with his heavy stone  axe. He must parry those deadly blows. He must be alert, but watchful. He  must put himself in a posture of defence at once. Above all, he must keep  cool and have his wits about him.    
If he could but have drawn his knife, he would have stood a better chance  in that hand-to-hand conflict. But there was no time now for such tactics  as those. Besides, even in close fight with a bloodthirsty savage, an  English gentleman's sense of fair play never for one moment deserts him.  Felix felt, if they were to fight it out face to face for their lives,  they should fight at least on a perfect equality. Steel against stone was  a mean advantage. Parrying Tu-Kila-Kila's first desperate blow with the  haft of his own hatchet, he leaped aside half a second to gain breath and  strength. Then he rushed on, and dealt one deadly downstroke with the  ponderous weapon.    
For a minute or two they closed, in perfectly savage single combat.  Fire and Water, observant and impartial, stood by like seconds to see  the god himself decide the issue, which of the two combatants should be  his living representative. The contest was brief but very hard-fought.  Tu-Kila-Kila, inspired with the last frenzy of despair, rushed wildly  on his opponent with hands and fists, and teeth and nails, dealing his  blows in blind fury, right and left, and seeking only to sell his life  as dearly as possible. In this last extremity, his very superstitions  told against him. Everything seemed to show his hour had come. The  parrot's bite--the omen of his own blood that stained the dust of  earth--Ula's treachery--the chance by which the Korong had learned the  Great Taboo--Felix's accidental or providential success in breaking off  the bough--the length of time he himself had held the divine honors--the  probability that the god would by this time begin to prefer a new and  stronger representative--all these things alike combined to fire the  drunk and maddened savage with the energy of despair. He fell upon his  enemy like a tiger upon an elephant. He fought with his tomahawk and his  feet and his whole lithe body; he foamed at the mouth with impotent rage;  he spent his force on the air in the extremity of his passion.    
Felix, on the other hand, sobered by pain, and nerved by the fixed  consciousness that Muriel's safety now depended absolutely on his perfect  coolness, fought with the calm skill of a practised fencer. Happily he  had learned the gentle art of thrust and parry years before in England;  and though both weapon and opponent were here so different, the lesson of  quickness and calm watchfulness he had gained in that civilized school  stood him in good stead, even now, under such adverse circumstances.  Tu-Kila-Kila, getting spent, drew back for a second at last, and panted  for breath. That faint breathing-space of a moment's duration sealed his  fate. Seizing his chance with consummate skill, Felix closed upon the  breathless monster, and brought down the heavy stone hammer point blank  upon the centre of his crashing skull. The weapon drove home. It cleft a  great red gash in the cannibal's head. Tu-Kila-Kila reeled and fell.  There was an infinitesimal pause of silence and suspense. Then a great  shout went up from all round to heaven, "He has killed him! He has  killed him! We have a new-made god! Tu-Kila-Kila is dead! Long live  Tu-Kila-Kila!"    
Felix drew back for a moment, panting and breathless, and wiped his wet  brow with his sleeve, his brain all whirling. At his feet, the savage lay  stretched, like a log. Felix gazed at the blood-bespattered face  remorsefully. It is an awful thing, even in a just quarrel, to feel that  you have really taken a human life! The responsibility is enough to  appall the bravest of us. He stooped down and examined the prostrate body  with solemn reverence. Blood was flowing in torrents from the wounded  head. But Tu-Kila-Kila was dead--stone-dead forever.    
Hot tears of relief welled up into Felix's eyes. He touched the body  cautiously with a reverent hand. No life. No motion.    
Just as he did so, the woman Ula came forward, bare-limbed and beautiful,  all triumph in her walk, a proud, insensitive savage. One second she  gazed at the great corpse disdainfully. Then she lifted her dainty foot,  and gave it a contemptuous kick. "The body of Lavita, the son of Sami,"  she said, with a gesture of hatred. "He had a bad heart. We will cook it  and eat it." Next turning to Felix, "Oh, Tu-Kila-Kila," she cried,  clapping her hands three times and bowing low to the ground, "you are a  very great god. We will serve you and salute you. Am not I, Ula, one of  your wives, your meat? Do with me as you will. Toko, you are henceforth  the great god's Shadow!"    
Felix gazed at the beautiful, heartless creature, all horrified. Even on  Boupari, that cannibal island, he was hardly prepared for quite so low a  depth of savage insensibility. But all the people around, now a hundred  or more, standing naked before their new god, took up the shout in  concert. "The body of Lavita, the son of Sami," they cried. "A carrion  corpse! The god has deserted it. The great soul of the world has entered  the heart of the white-faced stranger from the disk of the sun; the King  of the Rain; the great Tu-Kila-Kila. We will cook and eat the body of  Lavita, the son of Sami. He was a bad man. He is a worn-out shell.  Nothing remains of him now. The great god has left him."    
They clapped their hands in a set measure as they recited this hymn.  The King of Fire retreated into the temple. Ula stood by, and whispered  low with Toko. There was a ceremonial pause of some fifteen minutes.  Presently, from the inner recesses of the temple itself, a low noise  issued forth as of a rising wind. For some seconds it buzzed and hummed,  droningly. But at the very first note of that holy sound Ula dropped her  lover's hand, as one drops a red-hot coal, and darted wildly off at  full speed, like some frightened wild beast, into the thick jungle. Every  other woman near began to rush away with equally instantaneous signs of  haste and fear. The men, on the other hand, erect and naked, with their  hands on their foreheads, crossed the taboo-line at once. It was the  summons to all who had been initiated at the mysteries--the sacred  bull-roarer was calling the assembly of the men of Boupari.    
For several minutes it buzzed and droned, that mystic implement, growing  louder and louder, till it roared like thunder. One after another, the  men of the island rushed in as if mad or in flight for their lives before  some fierce beast pursuing them. They ran up, panting, and dripping with  sweat; their hands clapped to their foreheads; their eyes starting wildly  from their staring sockets; torn and bleeding and lacerated by the thorns  and branches of the jungle, for each man ran straight across country from  the spot where he lay asleep, in the direction of the sound, and never  paused or drew breath, for dear life's sake, till he stood beside the  corpse of the dead Tu-Kila-Kila.    
And every moment the cry pealed louder and louder still. "Lavita, the son  of Sami, is dead, praise Heaven! The King of the Rain has slain him, and  is now the true Tu-Kila-Kila!"    
Felix bent irresolute over the fallen savage's bloodstained corpse. What  next was expected of him he hardly knew or cared. His one desire now was  to return to Muriel--to Muriel, whom he had rescued from something worse  than death at the hateful hands of that accursed creature who lay  breathless forever on the ground beside him.    
Somebody came up just then, and seized his hand warmly. Felix looked up  with a start. It was their friend, the Frenchman. "Ah, my captain, you  have done well," M. Peyron cried, admiring him. "What courage! What  coolness! What pluck! What soldiership! I couldn't see all. But I was in  at the death! And oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, how I admired and envied you!"    
By this time the bull-roarer had ceased to bellow among the rocks. The  King of Fire stood forth. In his hands he held a length of bamboo-stick  with a lighted coal in it. "Bring wood and palm-leaves," he said, in a  tone of command. "Let me light myself up, that I may blaze before  Tu-Kila-Kila."    
He turned and bowed thrice very low before Felix. "The accepted of  Heaven," he cried, holding his hands above him. "The very high god! The  King of all Things! He sends down his showers upon our crops and our  fields. He causes his sun to shine brightly over us. He makes our pigs  and our slaves bring forth their increase. All we are but his meat. We,  his people, praise him."    
And all the men of Boupari, naked and bleeding, bent low in response.  "Tu-Kila-Kila is great," they chanted, as they clapped their hands. "We  thank him that he has chosen a fresh incarnation. The sun will not fade  in the heavens overhead, nor the bread-fruits wither and cease to bear  fruit on earth. Tu-Kila-Kila, our god, is great. He springs ever young  and fresh, like the herbs of the field. He is a most high god. We, his  people, praise him."    
Four temple attendants brought sticks and leaves, while Felix stood  still, half dazed with the newness of these strange preparations. The  King of Fire, with his torch, set light to the pile. It blazed merrily on  high. "I, Fire, salute you," he cried, bending over it toward Felix.    
"Now cut up the body of Lavita, the son of Sami," he went on, turning  toward it contemptuously. "I will cook it in my flame, that Tu-Kila-Kila  the great may eat of it."    
Felix drew back with a face all aglow with horror and disgust. "Don't  touch that body!" he cried, authoritatively, putting his foot down firm.  "Leave it alone at once. I refuse to allow you." Then he turned to  M. Peyron. "The King of the Birds and I," he said, with calm resolve, "we  two will bury it."    
The King of Fire drew back at these strange words, nonplussed. This  was, indeed, an ill-omened break in the ceremony of initiation of a new  Tu-Kila-Kila, to which he had never before in his life been accustomed.  He hardly knew how to comport himself under such singular circumstances.  It was as though the sovereign of England, on coronation-day, should  refuse to be crowned, and intimate to the archbishop, in his full  canonicals, a confirmed preference for the republican form of Government.  It was a contingency that law and custom in Boupari had neither, in their  wisdom, foreseen nor provided for.    
The King of Water whispered low in the new god's ear. "You must eat of  his body, my lord," he said. "That is absolutely necessary. Every one of  us must eat of the flesh of the god; but you, above all, must eat his  heart, his divine nature. Otherwise you can never be full Tu-Kila-Kila."    
"I don't care a straw for that," Felix cried, now aroused to a full sense  of the break in Methuselah's story and trembling with apprehension. "You  may kill me if you like; we can die only once; but human flesh I can  never taste; nor will I, while I live, allow you to touch this dead man's  body. We will bury it ourselves, the King of the Birds and I. You may  tell your people so. That is my last word." He raised his voice to the  customary ceremonial pitch. "I, the new Tu-Kila-Kila," he said, "have  spoken it."    
The King of Fire and the King of Water, taken aback at his boldness,  conferred together for some seconds privately. The people meanwhile  looked on and wondered. What could this strange hitch in the divine  proceedings mean? Was the god himself recalcitrant? Never in their lives  had the oldest men among them known anything like it.    
And as they whispered and debated, awe-struck but discordant, a shout  arose once more from the outer circle--a mighty shout of mingled  surprise, alarm, and terror. "Taboo! Taboo! Fence the mysteries. Beware!  Oh, great god, we warn you. The mysteries are in danger! Cut her down!  Kill her! A woman! A woman!"    
At the words, Felix was aware of somebody bursting through the dense  crowd and rushing wildly toward him. Next moment, Muriel hung and sobbed  on his shoulder, while Mali, just behind her, stood crying and moaning.    
Felix held the poor startled girl in his arms and soothed her. And  all around another great cry arose from five hundred lips: "Two women  have profaned the mysteries of the god. They are Tu-Kila-Kila's  trespass-offering. Let us kill them and eat them!"
