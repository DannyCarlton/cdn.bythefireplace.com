"Three days, at least, before we reach Baden. How tiresome it is that  uncle won't go faster!" said Amy, as she tied on her hat next morning,  wondering as she did so if the baron would take the same boat.    
"As adventures have begun, I feel assured that they will continue to  cheer the way; so resign yourself and be ready for anything," replied  Helen, carefully arranging her bouquet in her travelling-basket.    
A tap at the door, which stood half open, made both look up. A tall,  brown, gentlemanly man, in a gray suit, with a leathern bag slung over  his shoulder, stood there, hat in hand, and meeting Helen's eyes,  bowed respectfully, saying in good English, but with a strong German  accent,--    
"Ladies, the major desired me to tell you the carriage waits."    
"Why, who--" began Amy, staring with her blue eyes full of wonder at  the stranger.    
He bowed again, and said, simply,--    
"Karl Hoffman, at your service, mademoiselle."    
"The courier--oh, yes! I forgot all about it. Please take these  things."    
Amy began to hand him her miscellaneous collection of bags, books,  shawls and cushions.    
"I'd no idea couriers were such decent creatures," whispered Amy, as  they followed him along the hall.    
"Don't you remember the raptures Mrs. Mortimer used to have over their  Italian courier, and her funny description of him? 'Beautiful to  behold, with a night of hair, eyes full of an infinite tenderness, and  a sumptuous cheek.'"    
Both girls laughed, and Amy averred that Karl's eyes danced with  merriment as he glanced over his shoulder, as the silvery peal sounded  behind him.    
"Hush! he understands English; we must be careful," said Helen, and  neither spoke again till they reached the carriage.    
Everything was ready, and as they drove away, the major, leaning  luxuriously back, exclaimed,--    
"Now I begin to enjoy travelling, for I'm no longer worried by  the thought of luggage, time-tables, trains, and the everlasting  perplexity of thalers, kreutzers, and pfenniges. This man is a  treasure; everything is done in the best manner, and his knowledge of  matters is really amazing."    
"He's a very gentlemanly-looking person," said Amy, eying a decidedly  aristocratic foot through the front window of the carriage, for Karl  sat up beside the driver.    
"He <i>is</i> a gentleman, my dear. Many of these couriers are well born  and educated, but, being poor, prefer this business to any other, as  it gives them variety, and often pleasant society. I've had a long  talk with Hoffman, and find him an excellent and accomplished fellow.  He has lost his fortune, it seems, through no fault of his own, so  being fond of a roving life, turned courier for a time, and we are  fortunate to have secured him."    
"But one doesn't know how to treat him," said Helen. "I don't like  to address him as a servant, and yet it's not pleasant to order a  gentleman about."    
"Oh, it will be easy enough as we go on together. Just call him  Hoffman, and behave as if you knew nothing about his past. He begged  me not to mention it, but I thought you'd like the romance of the  thing. Only don't either of you run away with him, as Ponsonby's  daughter did with her courier, who wasn't a gentleman, by the way."    
"Not handsome enough," said Amy. "I don't like blue eyes and black  hair. His manners are nice, but he looks like a gipsy, with his brown  face and black beard: doesn't he, Nell?"    
"Not at all. Gipsies haven't that style of face; they are thin, sharp,  and cunning in feature as in nature. Hoffman has large, well-moulded  features, and a mild, manly expression, which gives one confidence in  him."    
"He has a keen, wicked look in his blue eyes, as you will see, Nell.  I mean mischievously, not malignantly wicked. He likes fun, I'm sure,  for he laughed about the 'sumptuous cheek' till his own were red,  though he dared not show it, and was as grave as an owl when we met  uncle," said Amy, smiling at the recollection.    
"We shall go by boat to Biebrich, and then by rail to Heidelberg. We  shall get in late to-morrow night, but can rest a day, and then on to  Baden. Here we are; now make yourselves easy, as I do, and let Karl  take care of everything."    
And putting his hands in his pockets, the major strolled about the  boat, while the courier made matters comfortable for the day. So  easily and well did he do his duty, that both girls enjoyed watching  him after he had established them on the shady side of the boat, with  camp-stools for their feet, cushions to lean on, books and bags laid  commodiously at hand.    
As they sailed up the lovely Rhine they grew more and more  enthusiastic in their admiration and curiosity, and finding the meagre  description of the guide-books very unsatisfactory, Amy begged her  uncle to tell her all the legends of picturesque ruin, rock and river,  as they passed.    
"Bless me, child, I know nothing; but here's Hoffman, a German born,  who will tell you everything, I dare say. Karl, what's that old castle  up there? The young ladies want to know about it."    
Leaning on the railing, Hoffman told the story so well that he was  kept explaining and describing for an hour, and when he went away to  order lunch, Amy declared it was as pleasant as reading fairy tales to  listen to his dramatic histories and legends.    
At lunch the major was charmed to find his favorite wines and dishes  without any need of consulting dictionary or phrase-book beforehand,  or losing his temper in vain attempts to make himself understood.    
On reaching Biebrich, tired and hungry, at nightfall, everything was  ready for them, and all went to bed praising Karl, the courier, though  Amy, with unusual prudence, added,--    
"He is a new broom now; let us wait a little before we judge."    
All went well next day till nightfall, when a most untoward accident  occurred, and Helen's adventures began in earnest. The three occupied  a <i>coupe</i>, and being weary with long sitting, Helen got out at one of  the stations where the train paused for ten minutes. A rosy sunset  tempted her to the end of the platform, and there she found, what  nearly all foreign railway stations possess, a charming little garden.    
Amy was very tired, rather cross, and passionately fond of flowers, so  when an old woman offered to pull a nosegay for "the gracious lady,"  Helen gladly waited for it, hoping to please the invalid. Twice the  whistle warned her, and at last she ran back, but only in time to see  the train move away, with her uncle gesticulating wildly to the guard,  who shook his stupid German head, and refused to see the dismayed  young lady imploring him to wait for her.    
Just as the train was vanishing from the station, a man leaped from  a second-class carriage at the risk of his neck, and hurried back to  find Helen looking pale and bewildered, as well she might, left alone  and moneyless at night in a strange town.    
"Mademoiselle, it is I; rest easy; we can soon go on; a train passes  in two hours, and we can telegraph to Heidelberg that they may not  fear for you."    
"Oh, Hoffman, how kind of you to stop for me! What should I have done  without you, for uncle takes care of all the money, and I have only my  watch."    
Helen's usual self-possession rather failed her in the flurry of the  moment, and she caught Karl's arm with a feminine little gesture of  confidence very pleasant to see. Leading her to the waiting-room, he  ordered supper, and put her into the care of the woman of the place,  while he went to make inquiries and dispatch the telegram. In half an  hour he returned, finding Helen refreshed and cheerful, though a trace  of anxiety was still visible in her watchful eyes.    
"All goes excellently, mademoiselle. I have sent word to several posts  along the road that we are coming by the night train, so that Monsieur  le Major will rest tranquil till we meet. It is best that I give you  some money, lest such a mishap should again occur; it is not likely so  soon; nevertheless, here is both gold and silver. With this, one can  make one's way everywhere. Now, if mademoiselle will permit me to  advise, she will rest for an hour, as we must travel till dawn. I will  keep guard without and watch for the train."    
He left her, and having made herself comfortable on one of the sofas,  she lay watching the tall shadow pass and repass door and window, as  Karl marched up and down the platform, with the tireless tramp of a  sentinel on duty. A pleasant sense of security stole over her, and  with a smile at Amy's enjoyment of the adventure when it was over,  Helen fell asleep.    
A far-off shriek half woke her, and starting up, she turned to meet  the courier coming in to wake her. Up thundered the train, every  carriage apparently full of sleepy passengers, and the guard in a  state of sullen wrath at some delay, the consequences of which would  fall heaviest on him.    
From carriage to carriage hurried Karl and his charge, to be met with  everywhere by the cry, "All full," in many languages, and with every  aspect of inhospitality. One carriage only showed two places; the  other seats were occupied by six students, who gallantly invited the  lady to enter. But Helen shrunk back, saying,--    
"Is there no other place?"    
"None, mademoiselle; this, or remain till morning," said Karl.    
"Where will you go if I take this place?"    
"Among the luggage,--anywhere; it is nothing. But we must decide at  once."    
"Come with me; I'm afraid to be locked in here alone," said Helen,  desperately.    
"Mademoiselle forgets I am her courier."    
"I do not forget that you are a gentleman. Pray come in; my uncle will  thank you."    
"I will," and with a sudden brightening of the eyes, a grateful  glance, and an air of redoubled respect, Hoffman followed her into the  carriage.    
They were off at once, and the thing was done before Helen had time  to feel anything but the relief which the protection of his presence  afforded her.    
The young gentlemen stared at the veiled lady and her grim escort,  joked under their breath, and looked wistfully at the suppressed  cigars, but behaved with exemplary politeness till sleep overpowered  them, and one after the other dropped off asleep to dream of their  respective Gretchens.    
Helen could not sleep, and for hours sat studying the unconscious  faces before her, the dim landscape flying past the windows, or forgot  herself in reveries.    
Hoffman remained motionless and silent, except when she addressed  him, wakeful also, and assiduous in making the long night as easy as  possible.    
It was past midnight, and Helen's heavy eyelids were beginning to  droop, when suddenly there came an awful crash, a pang of mortal fear,  then utter oblivion.    
As her senses returned she found herself lying in a painful position  under what had been the roof of the car; something heavy weighed  down her lower limbs, and her dizzy brain rung with a wild uproar of  shrieks and groans, eager voices, the crash of wood and iron, and the  shrill whistle of the engine, as it rushed away for help.    
Through the darkness she heard the pant as of some one struggling  desperately, then a cry close by her, followed by a strong voice  exclaiming, in an agony of suspense,--    
"My God, will no one come!"    
"Hoffman, are you there?" cried Helen, groping in the gloom, with a  thrill of joy at the sound of a familiar voice.    
"Thank heaven, you are safe. Lie still. I will save you. Help is  coming. Have no fear!" panted the voice, with an undertone of fervent  gratitude in its breathless accents.    
"What has happened? Where are the rest?"    
"We have been thrown down an embankment. The lads are gone for help.  God only knows what harm is done."    
Karl's voice died in a stifled groan, and Helen cried out in alarm,--    
"Where are you? You are hurt?"    
"Not much. I keep the ruins from falling in to crush us. Be quiet,  they are coming."    
A shout answered the faint halloo he gave as if to guide them to the  spot, and a moment after, five of the students were swarming about the  wreck, intent on saving the three whose lives were still in danger.    
A lamp torn from some demolished carriage was held through an opening,  and Helen saw a sight that made her blood chill in her veins. Across  her feet, crushed and bleeding, lay the youngest of the students, and  kneeling close beside him was Hoffman, supporting by main strength a  mass of timber, which otherwise would fall and crush them all. His  face was ghastly pale, his eyes haggard with pain and suspense, and  great drops stood upon his forehead. But as she looked, he smiled with  a cheery.--    
"Bear up, dear lady, we shall soon be out of danger. Now, lads, work  with a will; my strength is going fast."    
They did work like heroes, and even in her pain and peril, Helen  admired the skill, energy, and courage of the young men, who, an hour  ago, had seemed to have no ideas above pipes and beer. Soon Hoffman  was free, the poor senseless youth lifted out, and then, as tenderly  as if she were a child, they raised and set her down, faint but  unhurt, in a wide meadow, already strewn with sad tokens of the wreck.    
Karl was taken possession of as well as herself, forced to rest a  moment, drink a cordial draught from some one's flask, and be praised,  embraced, and enthusiastically blessed by the impetuous youths.    
"Where is the boy who was hurt? Bring him to me. I am strong now.  I want to help. I have salts in my pocket, and I can bind up his  wounds," said Helen, soon herself again.    
Karl and Helen soon brought back life and sense to the boy, and never  had human face looked so lovely as did Helen's to the anxious comrades  when she looked up in the moonlight with a joyful smile, and softly  whispered,--    
"He is alive."    
For an hour terrible confusion reigned, then the panic subsided a  little, and such of the carriages as were whole were made ready to  carry away as many as possible; the rest must wait till a return train  could be sent for them.    
A struggle of course ensued, for every one wished to go on, and fear  made many selfish. The wounded, the women and children, were taken, as  far as possible, and the laden train moved away, leaving many anxious  watchers behind.    
Helen had refused to go, and had given her place to poor Conrad,  thereby overwhelming his brother and comrades with gratitude. Two went  on with the wounded lad; the rest remained, and chivalrously devoted  themselves to Helen as a body-guard.    
The moon shone clearly, the wide field was miles from any hamlet,  and a desolate silence succeeded to the late uproar, as the band of  waiters roamed about, longing for help and dawn.    
"Mademoiselle, you shiver; the dew falls, and it is damp here; we must  have a fire;" and Karl was away to a neighboring hedge, intent on  warming his delicate charge if he felled a forest to do it.    
The students rushed after him, and soon returned in triumph to build  a glorious fire, which drew all forlorn wanderers to its hospitable  circle. A motley assemblage; but mutual danger and discomfort produced  mutual sympathy and good will, and a general atmosphere of friendship  pervaded the party.    
"Where is the brave Hoffman?" asked Wilhelm, the blond student, who,  being in the Werther period of youth, was already madly in love with  Helen, and sat at her feet catching cold in the most romantic manner.    
"Behold me! The little ones cry for hunger, so I ransack the ruins and  bring away my spoils. Eat, Kinder, eat and be patient."    
As he spoke Karl appeared with an odd collection of baskets, bags, and  bottles, and with a fatherly air that won all the mothers, he gave  the children whatever first appeared, making them laugh in spite of  weariness and hunger by the merry speeches which accompanied his  gifts.    
"You too need something. Here is your own basket with the lunch I  ordered you. In a sad state of confusion, but still eatable. See,  it is not bad," and he deftly spread on a napkin before Helen cold  chicken, sandwiches, and fruit.    
His care for the little ones as well as for herself touched her and  her eyes filled, as she remembered that she owed her life to him, and  recalled the sight of his face in the overturned car.    
Her voice trembled a little as she thanked him, and the moonlight  betrayed her wet eyes. He fancied she was worn out with excitement and  fatigue, and anxious to cheer her spirits, he whispered to Wilhelm and  his mates,--    
"Sing, then, comrades, and while away this tedious night. It is hard  for all to wait so long, and the babies need a lullaby."    
The young men laughed and sang as only German students can sing,  making the night musical with blithe drinking songs, tender love-lays,  battle-hymns, and Volkslieder sweeter than any songs across the water.    
Every heart was cheered and warmed by the magic of the music, the  babies fell asleep, strangers grew friendly, fear changed to courage,  and the most forlorn felt the romance of that bivouac under the summer  sky.    
Dawn was reddening the east when a welcome whistle broke up the camp.  Every one hurried to the railway, but Helen paused to gather a handful  of blue forget-me-nots, saying to Hoffman, who waited with her wraps  on his arm,--    
"It has been a happy night, in spite of the danger and discomfort. I  shall not soon forget it; and take these as a souvenir."    
He smiled, standing bare-headed in the chilly wind, for his hat was  lost, his coat torn, hair dishevelled, and one hand carelessly bound  up in his handkerchief. Helen saw these marks of the night's labors  and perils for the first time, and as soon as they were seated desired  to see his hand.    
"It is nothing,--a scratch, a mere scratch, I give you my word,  mademoiselle," he began, but Wilhelm unceremoniously removed the  handkerchief, showing a torn and bleeding hand which must have been  exquisitely painful.    
Helen turned pale, and with a reproachful glance skilfully bound it up  again, saying, as she handed a silken scarf to Wilhelm,--    
"Make of that a sling, please, and put the poor hand in it. Care must  be taken, or harm will come of it."    
Hoffman submitted in bashful silence, as if surprised and touched by  the young lady's interest. She saw that, and added gratefully,--    
"I do not forget that you saved my life, though you seem to have done  so. My uncle will thank you better than I can."    
"I already have my reward, mademoiselle," he returned, with a  respectful inclination and a look she could neither understand nor  forget.
