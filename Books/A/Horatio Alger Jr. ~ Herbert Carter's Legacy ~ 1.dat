   Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and  himself  remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born  at  Revere, Mass., January 13, 1834. He was the son of a clergyman; was   graduated at Harvard College in 1852, and at its Divinity School in   1860; and was pastor of the Unitarian Church at Brewster, Mass., in   1862-66. 
  In the latter year he settled in New York and began drawing public   attention to the condition and needs of street boys. He mingled with   them, gained their confidence, showed a personal concern in their   affairs, and stimulated them to honest and useful living. With his   first story he won the hearts of all red-blooded boys everywhere, and   of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies were sold   during the author's lifetime. 
  In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, bald-headed   man, with cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused   all who met him. He died at Natick, Mass., July 18, 1899. 
  Mr. Alger's stories are as popular now as when first published,   because they treat of real live boys who were always up and about&#8212;   just like the boys found everywhere to-day. They are pure in tone and   inspiring in influence, and many reforms in the juvenile life of New   York may be traced to them. Among the best known are: 
  Strong and Steady; Strive and Succeed; Try and Trust; Bound to   Rise; Risen from the Ranks; Herbert Carter's Legacy; Brave and Bold;   Jack's Ward; Shifting for Himself; Wait and Hope; Paul the Peddler;   Phil the Fiddler; Slow and Sure; Julius the Street Boy; Tom the   Bootblack; Struggling Upward; Facing the World; The Cash Boy; Making   His Way; Tony the Tramp; Joe's Luck; Do and Dare; Only an Irish Boy;   Sink or Swim; A Cousin's Conspiracy; Andy Gordon; Bob Burton; Harry   Vane; Hector's Inheritance; Mark Mason's Triumph; Sam's Chance; The   Telegraph Boy; The Young Adventurer; The Young Outlaw; The Young   Salesman, and Luke Walton.
