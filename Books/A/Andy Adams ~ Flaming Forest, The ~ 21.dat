  As Carrigan stripped off his shirt, he knew that at least in one   way he had met more than his match in St. Pierre Boulain. In the   splendid service of which he was a part he had known many men of  iron  and steel, men whose nerve and coolness not even death could  very  greatly disturb. Yet St. Pierre, he conceded, was their  master&#8212;and  his own. For a flash he had transformed the chief of  the Boulains into  a volcano which had threatened to break in  savage fury, yet neither  the crash nor destruction had come. And  now St. Pierre was smiling  again, as Carrigan faced him, stripped  to the waist. He betrayed no  sign of the tempest of passion that  had swept him a few minutes  before. His cool, steely eyes had in  them a look that was positively  friendly, as Concombre Bateese  marked in the hard sand the line of the  circle within which no man  might come. And as he did this and St.  Pierre's people crowded  close about it, St. Pierre himself spoke in a  low voice to David. 
  &quot;M'sieu, it seems a shame that we should fight. I like you. I have   always loved a man who would fight to protect a woman, and I shall  be  careful not to hurt you more than is necessary to make you see   reason&#8212;and to win the wagers. So you need not be afraid of my   killing you, as Bateese might have done. And I promise not to  destroy  your beauty, for the sake of&#8212;the lady in the bateau. My  Carmin, if  she knew you spied through her window last night, would  say kill you  with as little loss of time as possible, for as  regards you her sweet  disposition was spoiled when you hung her  brother, m'sieu. Yet to me  she is an angel!&quot; 
  Contempt for the man who spoke of his wife and the infamous Carmin   Fanchet in the same breath drew a sneer to Carrigan's lips. He  nodded  toward the waiting circle of men. 
  &quot;They are ready for the show, St. Pierre. You talk big. Now let us   see if you can fight.&quot; 
  For another moment St. Pierre hesitated. &quot;I am so sorry, m'sieu&#8212; 
  &quot;Are you ready, St. Pierre?&quot; 
  &quot;It is not fair, and she will never forgive me. You are no match   for me. I am half again as heavy.&quot; 
  &quot;And as big a coward as you are a scoundrel, St. Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;It is like a man fighting a boy.&quot; 
  &quot;Yet it is less dishonorable than betraying the woman who is your   wife for another who should have been hanged along with her  brother,  St. Pierre.&quot; 
  Boulain's face darkened. He drew back half a dozen steps and cried   out a word to Bateese. Instantly the circle of waiting men grew  tense  as the half-breed jerked the big handkerchief from his head  and held  it out at arm's length. Yet, with that eagerness for the  fight there  was something else which Carrigan was swift to sense.  The attitude of  the watchers was not one of uncertainty or of very  great expectation,  in spite of the staring faces and the muscular  tightening of the line.  He knew what was passing in their minds  and in the low whispers from  lip to lip. They were pitying him.  Now that he stood stripped, with  only a few paces between him and  the giant figure of St. Pierre, the  unfairness of the fight struck  home even to Concombre Bateese. Only  Carrigan himself knew how  like tempered steel the sinews of his body  were built. But to the  eye, in size alone, he stood like a boy before  St. Pierre. And St.  Pierre's people, their voices stilled by the  deadly inequality of  it, were waiting for a slaughter and not a fight. 
  A smile came to Carrigan's lips as he saw Bateese hesitating to   drop the handkerchief, and with the swiftness of the trained  fighter  he made his first plan for the battle before the cloth  fell from the  half-breed's fingers, As the handkerchief fluttered  to the ground, he  faced St. Pierre, the smile gone. 
  &quot;Never smile when you fight,&quot; the greatest of all masters of the   ring had told him. &quot;Never show anger, Don't betray any emotion at  all  if you can help it.&quot; 
  Carrigan wondered what the old ring-master would say could he see   him now, backing away slowly from St. Pierre as the giant advanced   upon him, for he knew his face was betraying to St. Pierre and his   people the deadliest of all sins&#8212;anxiety and indecision. Very   closely, yet with eyes that seemed to shift uneasily, he watched  the  effect of his trick on Boulain. Twice the huge riverman  followed him  about the ring of sand, and the steely glitter in his  eyes changed to  laughter, and the tense faces of the men about  them relaxed. A subdued  ripple of merriment rose where there had  been silence. A third time  David maneuvered his retreat, and his  eyes shot furtively to Concombre  Bateese and the men at his back.  They were grinning. The half-breed's  mouth was wide open, and his  grotesque body hung limp and astonished.  This was not a fight! It  was a comedy&#8212;like a rooster following a  sparrow around a  barnyard! And then a still funnier thing happened,  for David began  to trot in a circle around St. Pierre, dodging and  feinting, and  keeping always at a safe distance. A howl of laughter  came from  Bateese and broke in a roar from the men. St. Pierre stopped  in  his tracks, a grin on his face, his big arms and shoulders limp   and unprepared as Carrigan dodged in close and out again. And  then&#8212; 
  A howl broke in the middle of the half-breed's throat. Where there   had been laughter, there came a sudden shutting off of sound, a  great  gasp, as if made by choking men. Swifter than anything they  had ever  seen in human action Carrigan had leaped in. They saw him  strike. They  heard the blow. They saw St. Pierre's great head rock  back, as if  struck from his shoulders by a club, and they saw and  heard another  blow, and a third&#8212;like so many flashes of  lightning&#8212;and St. Pierre  went down as if shot. The man they had  laughed at was no longer like a  hopping sparrow. He was waiting,  bent a little forward, every muscle  in his body ready for action.  They watched for him to leap upon his  fallen enemy, kicking and  gouging and choking in the riverman way. But  David waited, and St.  Pierre staggered to his feet. His mouth was  bleeding and choked  with sand, and a great lump was beginning to swell  over his eye. A  deadly fire blazed in his face, as he rushed like a  mad bull at  the insignificant opponent who had tricked and humiliated  him.  This time Carrigan did not retreat, but held his ground, and a   yell of joy went up from Bateese as the mighty bulk of the giant   descended upon his victim. It was an avalanche of brute-force,   crushing in its destructiveness, and Carrigan seemed to reach for  it  as it came upon him. Then his head went down, swifter than a  diving  grebe, and as St. Pierre's arm swung like an oaken beam  over his  shoulder, his own shot in straight for the pit of the  other's stomach.  It was a bull's-eye blow with the force of a  pile-driver behind it,  and the groan that forced its way out of  St. Pierre's vitals was heard  by every ear in the cordon of  watchers. His weight stopped, his arms  opened, and through that  opening Carrigan's fist went a second time to  the other's jaw, and  a second time the great St. Pierre Boulain  sprawled out upon the  sand. And there he lay, and made no effort to  rise. 
  Concombre Bateese, with his great mouth agape, stood for an   instant as if the blow had stunned him in place of his master.  Then,  suddenly he came to life, and leaped to David's side. 
  &quot;Diable! Tonnerre! You have not fight Concombre Bateese yet!&quot; he   howled. &quot;Non, you have cheat me, you have lie, you have run lak  cat  from Concombre Bateese, ze stronges' man on all T'ree River!  You are  wan' gran' coward, wan poltroon, an' you 'fraid to fight  ME, who ees  greates' fightin' man in all dees countree! Sapristi!  Why you no hit  Concombre Bateese, m'sieu? Why you no hit ze  greates' fightin' man  w'at ees&#8212;&quot; 
  David did not hear the rest. The opportunity was too tempting. He   swung, and with a huge grunt the gorilla-like body of Concombre   Bateese rolled over that of the chief of the Boulains. This time   Carrigan did not wait, but followed up so closely that the half-   breed had scarcely gathered the crook out of his knees when  another  blow on the jaw sent him into the sand again. Three times  he tried the  experiment of regaining his feet, and three times he  was knocked down.  After the last blow he raised himself groggily  to a sitting posture,  and there he remained, blinking like a  stunned pig, with his big hands  clutching in the sand. He stared  up unseeingly at Carrigan, who waited  over him, and then stupidly  at the transfixed cordon of men, whose  eyes were bulging and who  were holding their breath in the  astonishment of this miracle  which had descended upon them. They heard  Bateese muttering  something incoherent as his head wobbled, and St.  Pierre himself  seemed to hear it, for he stirred and raised himself  slowly, until  he also was sitting in the sand, staring at Bateese. 
  Carrigan picked up his shirt, and the riverman who had brought him   from the bateau returned with him to the canoe. There was no   demonstration behind them. To David himself the whole thing had  been  an amazing surprise, and he was not at all reluctant to leave  as  quickly as his dignity would permit, before some other of St.  Pierre's  people offered to put a further test upon his prowess. He  wanted to  laugh. He wanted to thank God at the top of his voice  for the absurd  run of luck that had made his triumph not only easy  but utterly  complete. He had expected to win, but he had also  expected a terrific  fight before the last blow was struck. And  there had been no fight! He  was returning to the bateau without a  scratch, his hair scarcely  ruffled, and he had defeated not only  St, Pierre, but the giant  half-breed as well! It was  inconceivable&#8212;and yet it had happened; a  veritable burlesque, an  opera-bouffe affair that might turn quickly  into a tragedy if  either St. Pierre or Concombre Bateese guessed the  truth of it.  For in that event he might have to face them again, with  the god  of luck playing fairly, and he was honest enough with himself  to  confess that the idea no longer held either thrill or desire for   him. Now that he had seen both St. Pierre and Bateese stripped for   battle, he had no further appetite for fistic discussion with  them.  After all, there was a merit in caution, and he had several  lucky  stars to bless just at the present moment! 
  Inwardly he was a bit suspicious of the ultimate ending of the   affair. St. Pierre had almost no cause for complaint, for it was  his  own carelessness, coupled with his opponent's luck, that had  been his  undoing&#8212;and luck and carelessness are legitimate factors  of every  fight, Carrigan told himself. But with Bateese it was  different. He  had held up his big jaw, uncovered and tempting,  entreating some one  to hit him, and Carrigan had yielded to that  temptation. The blow  would have stunned an ox. Three others like  it had left the huge  half-breed sitting weak-mindedly in the sand,  and no one of those  three blows were exactly according to the  rules of the game. They had  been mightily efficacious, but the  half-breed might demand a rehearing  when he came fully into his  senses. 
  Not until they were half-way to the bateau did Carrigan dare to   glance back over his shoulder at the man who was paddling, to see   what effect the fistic travesty had left on him. He was a big-   mouthed, clear-eyed, powerfully-muscled fellow, and he was  grinning  from ear to ear. 
  &quot;Well, what did you think of it, comrade?&quot; 
  The other gave his shoulders a joyous shrug. 
  &quot;Mon Dieu! Have you heard of wan garcon named Joe Clamart, m'sieu?   Non? Well, I am Joe Clamart what was once great fightin' man.  Bateese  hav' whip' me five times, m'sieu&#8212;so I say it was wan gr-  r-r-a-n'  fight! Many years ago I have seen ze same t'ing in  Montreal&#8212;ze boxeur  de profession. Oui, an' Rene Babin pays me  fifteen prime martin  against which I put up three scrubby red fox  that you would win. They  were bad, or I would not have gambled,  m'sieu. It ees fonny!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it is funny,&quot; agreed David. &quot;I think it is a bit too funny.   It is a pity they did not stand up on their legs a little longer!&quot;   Suddenly an inspiration hit him. &quot;Joe, what do you say&#8212;shall you  and  I return and put up a REAL fight for them?&quot; 
  Like a sprung trap Joe Clamart's grinning mouth dosed. &quot;Non, non,   non,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Dere has been plenty fight, an' Joe Clamart  mus'  save hees face tor Antoinette Roland, who hate ze sign of  fight lak  she hate ze devil, m'sieu! Non, non!&quot; 
  His paddle dug deeper into the water, and David's heart felt   lighter. If Joe was an average barometer, and he was a husky and   fearless-looking chap, it was probable that neither St. Pierre nor   Bateese would demand another chance at him, and St. Pierre would  pay  his wager. 
  He could see no one aboard the bateau when he climbed from the   canoe. Looking back, he saw that two other canoes had started from   the opposite shore. Then he went to his cabin door, opened it, and   entered, Scarcely had the door closed behind him when he stopped,   staring toward the window that opened on the river. 
  Standing full in the morning glow of it was Marie-Anne Boulain.   She was facing him. Her cheeks were flushed. Her red lips were   parted. Her eyes were aglow with a fire which she made no effort  to  hide from him. In her hand she still held the binoculars he had  left  on the cabin table. He guessed the truth. Through the glasses  she had  watched the whole miserable fiasco. 
  He felt creeping over him a sickening shame, and his eyes fell   slowly from her to the table. What he saw there caught his breath  in  the middle. It was the entire surgical outfit of Nepapinas, the  old  Indian doctor. And there were basins of water, and white  strips of  linen ready for use, and a pile of medicated cotton, and  all sorts of  odds and ends that one might apply to ease the  agonies of a dying man,  And beyond the table, huddled in so small  a heap that he was almost  hidden by it, was Nepapinas himself,  disappointment writ in his  mummy-like face as his beady eyes  rested on David. 
  The evidence could not be mistaken. They had expected him to come   back more nearly dead than alive, and St. Pierre's wife had  prepared  for the thing she had thought inevitable. Even his bed  was nicely  turned down, its fresh white sheets inviting an  occupant! 
  And David, looking at St. Pierre's wife again, felt his heart   beating hard in his breast at the look which was in her eyes. It  was  not the scintillation of laughter, and the flame in her cheeks  was not  embarrassment. She was not amused. The ludicrousness of  her mislaid  plans had not struck her as they had struck him. She  had placed the  binoculars on the table, and slowly she came to  him. Her hands reached  out, and her fingers rested like the touch  of velvet on his arms. 
  &quot;It was splendid!&quot; she said softly, &quot;It was splendid!&quot; 
  She was very near, her breast almost touching him, her hands   creeping up until the tips of her fingers rested on his shoulders,   her scarlet mouth so close he could feel the soft breath of it in  his  face. 
  &quot;It was splendid!&quot; she whispered again. 
  And then, suddenly, she rose up on her tiptoes and kissed him. So   swiftly was it done that she was gone before he sensed that wild   touch of her lips against his own. Like a swallow she was at the   door, and the door opened and closed behind her, and for a moment  he  heard the quick running of her feet. Then he looked at the old  Indian,  and the Indian, too, was staring at the door through which  St.  Pierre's wife had flown.
