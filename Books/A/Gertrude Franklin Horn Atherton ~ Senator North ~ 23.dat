Betty never denied that she enjoyed her visit to California, despite  the several thousand miles between the Atlantic and the Pacific  coasts, and Senator North's rooted aversion to writing letters. She  received exactly three brief epistles from him in almost as many  months, but in one he said that he missed her even in the North, in  another that Washington was not Washington without her, and in the  third that he looked forward with pleasure to the cool Adirondacks and  herself.
