The term 'simultaneous' is primarily and most appropriately  applied to those things the genesis of the one of which is  simultaneous with that of the other; for in such cases neither is  prior or posterior to the other. Such things are said to be  simultaneous in point of time. Those things, again, are  'simultaneous' in point of nature, the being of each of which  involves that of the other, while at the same time neither is the  cause of the other's being. This is the case with regard to the  double and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since,  if there is a double, there is also a half, and if there is a  half, there is also a double, while at the same time neither is  the cause of the being of the other.    
Again, those species which are distinguished one from another and  opposed one to another within the same genus are said to be  'simultaneous' in nature. I mean those species which are  distinguished each from each by one and the same method of  division. Thus the 'winged' species is simultaneous with the  'terrestrial' and the 'water' species. These are distinguished  within the same genus, and are opposed each to each, for the  genus 'animal' has the 'winged', the 'terrestrial', and the  'water' species, and no one of these is prior or posterior to  another; on the contrary, all such things appear to be  'simultaneous' in nature. Each of these also, the terrestrial,  the winged, and the water species, can be divided again into  subspecies. Those species, then, also will be 'simultaneous'  point of nature, which, belonging to the same genus, are  distinguished each from each by one and the same method of  differentiation.    
But genera are prior to species, for the sequence of their being  cannot be reversed. If there is the species 'water-animal', there  will be the genus 'animal', but granted the being of the genus  'animal', it does not follow necessarily that there will be the  species 'water-animal'.    
Those things, therefore, are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature,  the being of each of which involves that of the other, while at  the same time neither is in any way the cause of the other's  being; those species, also, which are distinguished each from  each and opposed within the same genus. Those things, moreover,  are 'simultaneous' in the unqualified sense of the word which  come into being at the same time.
