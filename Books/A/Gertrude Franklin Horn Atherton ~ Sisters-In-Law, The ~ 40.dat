Mortimer looked nonplussed when Alexina informed him at dinner of the  immediate solution of their difficulties. He detested Tom and Maria Abbott;  there were certain things he could forget in his aristocratic wife's  presence, far as she had withdrawn, but never in theirs. Moreover he feared  Abbott. He was as keen as a hawk; an unconsidered word and he might as well  have told the whole story. Well, he never talked much anyhow; he would  merely talk less.    
When Alexina asked him if he had any better plan to propose he was forced  to shrug his shoulders and set his lips in a straight line of resignation.  When she told him what her original plan had been he was so appalled, so  humiliated at the bare thought of his wife in a servant's apron (to say  nothing of the culinary arrangements) that he almost warmed to the Abbotts.

Ten days later, on the eve of the Abbotts' arrival, the equanimity of  spirit he was striving to regain by the simple process of thinking of  something else when his late delinquencies obtruded themselves, received  a severe shock. Alexina handed him a cheque for ten thousand dollars and  asked him to place it to Gora's account in the bank where she kept her  savings.    
"Where did you get it?" he asked stupidly, staring at the slip of paper so  heavily freighted.    
"Anne Montgomery sold some of my things to a good-natured ignoramus whose  husband made a fortune in Tonopah. She doesn't know how to buy and Anne  advises her."    
"What did you sell? Your jewels?"    
"Some. I never wear anything but the pearls anyhow; and it's bad taste to  wear jewels unless you're wealthy. I had some old lace that is hard to buy  now, and real lace isn't the fashion any more. New rich people always think  it's just the thing. I also sold her two of the biggest and clumsiest of  the Italian pieces. She is crazy about them. Anne told her that they were  as good as a passport."    
Mortimer sprang to the only, the naive, the eternal masculine conclusion.    
"You do love me still!" The dull eyes of his spirit flashed with the sudden  rejuvenation of his heavy body. "I never really believed you had ceased to  care....you were capricious like all women...a little spoilt. I knew that  if I had patience...Only a loving wife would do such a thing."    
Alexina made a wry face at the banality of his climax, although the fatuous  outburst had barely amused her.    
"No, I don't love you in the least, Mortimer, and never shall. Make up your  mind to that. Love some one else if you like....I did this for two reasons:  I did not have the courage to tell Gora the truth--and that I was too  unjust and penurious to restore the money you had taken; and as your wife  it would have hurt my pride unbearably."    
"And you are not afraid to trust me with this money?" he asked, his voice  toneless.    
"Not in the least. There's no other way to manage it and I fancy you know  what would happen if you didn't hand it over. There is such a thing as the  last straw."
