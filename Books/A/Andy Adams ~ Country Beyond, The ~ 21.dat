  A slow illumination filled the cabin, first the yellow flare of a   match and then the light of a lamp, and as Father John's waxen  face  grew out of the darkness Peter whimpered and whined and  scratched  with, his paws at the closed door. 
  Oosimisk, the Leaf Bud, stood like a statue, with her wide, dark   eyes staring at Father John, but scarcely seeming to breathe. 
  In the old Missioner's face came a trembling smile and a look of   triumph as he read the fear-written question in her steady gaze 
  &quot;All is well, Oosimisk,&quot; he said quietly, speaking in Cree. &quot;They   are safely away, and will not be caught. Continue with your duties   and let no one see that anything unusual has happened. Breault  will  come very soon.&quot; 
  He straightened his shoulders, as if to give himself confidence   and strength, and then he called Peter, and comforted the dog  whose  master and mistress were fleeing through the dark. 
  &quot;They have reached the pool,&quot; he said, seating himself and holding   Peter's shaggy head between his hands. &quot;They have just about  reached  the pool, and Breault must be entering the clearing on the  other side.  Roger cannot miss the canoe&#8212;twenty paces down and  with nothing to  shadow it overhead; I think he has found it by  this time, and in  another half minute they will be off. And it is  very black down the  Burntwood, with deep timber close to the  water, and for many miles no  man can follow by night along its  shores. &quot;Suddenly his hands  tightened, and the Leaf Bud, watching  him slyly, saw the last of  suspense go out of his face. &quot;And now&#8212;  they are safe,&quot; he cried  exultantly. &quot;They must be on their way&#8212;  and Breault has not come  across the clearing!&quot; 
  He rose to his feet, and began pacing back and forth, while Peter   sniffed yearningly at the door again. Oosimisk, with the caution  of  her race in moments of danger, was drawing the curtains at the   windows, and Father John smiled his approbation. He did not want   Breault, the man-hunter, peering through one of the windows at  him.  Even as he walked back and forth he listened intently for  Breault's  footsteps. Peter, with a sigh, gave up his scratching  and settled  himself on his haunches close to Nada's door. 
  Father John, in passing him, paused to lay a hand on his head. 
  &quot;Some day it may please God to let us go to them,&quot; he consoled,   speaking for himself even more than for Peter. &quot;Some day, when  they  are far away&#8212;and safe.&quot; 
  He felt Peter suddenly stiffen under his hand, and from the Leaf   Bud came a low, swift word of warning. 
  She began singing softly, and dishes and pans already clean   rattled under her hands in the kitchen, and she continued to sing   even as the cabin door opened and Breault the man-hunter stood in  it. 
  The unexpectedness of his appearance, without the sound of a   warning footstep outside, was amazing even to Peter. In the open  door  he stood for a moment, his thin, ferret-like face standing  out against  the black background of the night, and his strange  eyes, apparently  half closed yet bright as diamonds, sweeping the  interior without  effort but with the quickness of lightning. 
  There was something deadly and foreboding about him as he stood   here, and Peter growled low in his throat. Recognition flashed  upon  him in an instant. It was the man of the snow-dune, away up  on the  Barren, the man whom he had mistrusted from the beginning,  and from  whom they had fled into the face of the Big Storm months  ago. His mind  worked swiftly, even as swiftly as Breault's in its  way, and without  any process of reasoning he sensed menace and  enmity in this man's  appearance, and associated with it the  mysterious flight of Jolly  Roger and Nada. 
  Breault had nodded, without speaking. Then his eyes rested on   Peter, and his face broke into a twisted sort of smile. It was not   altogether unpleasant, yet was there something about it which made   one shiver. It spoke the character of the man, pitiless,  determined,  omniscient almost, as if the spirit of a grim and  unrelenting fate  walked with him. 
  Again he nodded, and held out a hand. 
  &quot;Peter,&quot; he called. &quot;Come here, Peter!&quot; 
  Peter flattened his ears a fraction of an inch, but did not move.   Even that fraction of an inch caught Breault's keen eyes. 
  &quot;Still a one-man dog,&quot; he observed, stepping well inside the   cabin, and facing Father John. &quot;Where is McKay, Father?&quot; 
  He had not closed the door, and Peter saw his chance. The Leaf Bud   saw him pass like a shot out into the night, but as he went she  made  no effort to call him back, for her ears were wide open as  Breault  repeated his question, 
  &quot;Where is McKay, Father?&quot; 
  Peter heard the man-hunter's voice from the darkness outside. For   barely an instant he paused, picking up the fresh scent of Nada  and  Jolly Roger. It was easy to follow&#8212;straight to the pool, and  from the  pool twenty paces down-stream, where a little finger of  sand and  pebbles had been formed by the eddies. In this bar was  fresh imprint  of the canoe, and here the footprints ended. 
  Peter whimpered, peering into the tunnel of darkness between   forest trees, where the water rippled and gurgled softly on its  way  into a deeper and more tangled wilderness. He waded belly-deep  into  the current, half determined to swim; and then he waited,  listening  intently, but could hear no sound of voice or paddle  stroke. 
  Yet he knew Jolly Roger and Nada could not be far away. 
  He returned to the edge of the pool, and began sniffing his way   down-stream, pausing every two or three minutes to listen. Now and   then he caught the presence of those he sought, in the air, but  those  intervals in which he stopped to catch sound of voice or  paddle lost  him time, so the canoe was traveling faster than  Peter. 
  Half way between himself and the bow of that canoe McKay could   dimly make out Nada's pale face in the star glow that filtered  like a  mist through the tops of the close-hanging trees. 
  Scarcely above his breath he laughed in joyous confidence. 
  &quot;At last my dream is coming true, Nada,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You are   mine. And we are going into another world. And no one will ever  find  us there&#8212;no one but Father John, when we send him word. You  are not  afraid?&quot; 
  Her voice trembled a little in the gloom. 
  &quot;No, I am not afraid. But it is dark&#8212;so dark&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;The moon will be with us again in a few nights&#8212;your moon, with   the Old Man smiling down on us. I know how the Man in the Moon  must  feel when he's on the other side of the world, and can't see  you,  Nada.&quot; 
  Her silence made him lean toward her, striving to get a better   view of her face where the starlight broke through an opening in  the  tree-tops. 
  And in that moment he heard a little breath that was almost a sob. 
  &quot;It's Peter,&quot; she said, before he could speak. &quot;Oh, Roger, why   didn't we bring Peter?&quot; 
  &quot;Possibly&#8212;we should have,&quot; he replied, skipping a stroke with his   paddle. &quot;But I think we have done the best thing for Peter. He is  a  wilderness dog, and has never known anything different. Over  there,  where we are going&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I understand. And some day, Father John will bring him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. He has promised that. Peter will come to us when Father John   comes.&quot; 
  She had turned, looking into the pit-gloom ahead of them, so dark   that the canoe seemed about to drive against a wall. Under its bow   the water gurgled like oil. 
  &quot;We are entering the big cedar swamp,&quot; he explained. &quot;It is like   Blind Man's Buff, isn't it? Can you see?&quot; 
  &quot;Not beyond the bow of the canoe, Roger.&quot; 
  &quot;Work back to me,&quot; he said, &quot;very carefully.&quot; 
  She came, obediently. 
  &quot;Now turn slowly, so that you face the bow, and lean back with   your head against my knees.&quot; 
  This also, she did. 
  &quot;This is much nicer,&quot; she whispered, nestling her head comfortably   against him. &quot;So much nicer.&quot; 
  By leaning over until his back nearly cracked he was able to find   her lips in the darkness. 
  &quot;I was thinking of the brush that overhangs the stream,&quot; he   explained when he had straightened himself. &quot;Sitting up as you  were  it might have caused you hurt.&quot; 
  There was a little silence between them, in which his paddle   caught again its slow and steady rhythm. Then, 
  &quot;Were you thinking only of the brush, Roger&#8212;and of the hurt it   might cause me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, only of that,&quot; and he chuckled softly. 
  &quot;Then I don't think it nice here at all,&quot; she complained. &quot;I shall   sit up straight so the brush may put my eyes out!&quot; 
  But her head pressed even closer against him, and careful not to   interrupt his paddle-stroke she touched his face for an instant  with  her hand. 
  &quot;It's there,&quot; she purled, as if utterly comforted. &quot;I wanted to be   sure&#8212;it is so dark!&quot; 
  With cimmerian blackness on all sides of them, and a chaotic   tunnel ahead, they were happy. Staring straight before him, though   utterly unable to see, McKay sensed in every movement he made and  in  every breath he drew the exquisite thrill of a miracle. And the  same  thrill swept into him and through him from the softly  breathing body  of Nada. Light or darkness made no difference now.  Together,  inseparable from this time forth, they had started on  the one great  adventure of their lives, and for them fear had  ceased to exist. The  night sheltered them. Its very blackness held  in its embrace a warmth  of welcome and of unending hope. Twice in  the next half hour he put  his hand to Nada's face, and each time  she pressed her lips against  it, sweet with that confidence which  so completely possessed her soul. 
  Very slowly they moved through the swamp, for because of the gloom   his paddle-strokes were exceedingly short, and he was feeling his   way. Frequently he ran into brush, or struck the boggy shore, and   occasionally Nada would hold lighted matches while he extricated  the  canoe from tree-tops and driftwood that impeded the way. He  loved the  brief glimpses he caught of her face in the match-glow,  and twice he  deliberately wasted the tiny flares that he might  hold the vision of  her a little longer. 
  At last he began to feel the pulse of a current against his   paddle, and soon after that the star-mist began filtering through  the  thinning tree-tops again, so that he knew they were almost  through the  swamp. Another half-hour and they were free of it,  with a clear sky  overhead and the cheering song of running water  on both sides of them. 
  Nada sat up, and it was now so light that he could see the soft   shimmer of her hair in the starlight. He also saw a pretty little   grimace in her face, even as she smiled at him. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I can't move,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;UGH! my feet are asleep&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;We'll go ashore and stretch ourselves,&quot; said McKay, who had   looked at his watch in the light of the last match. &quot;We've two  hours  the start of Breault, and there is no other canoe.&quot; 
  He began watching the shore closely, and it was not long before he   made out the white smoothness of a sandbar on their right. Here  they  landed and for half an hour rested their cramped limbs. 
  Then they went on, and in his heart McKay blessed the deep swamp   that lay between them and Breault. 
  &quot;I don't think he can make it without a canoe, even if he guesses   we went this way,&quot; he explained to Nada. &quot;And that means&#8212;we are   safe.&quot; 
  There was a cheery ring in his voice which would have changed to   the deadness of cold iron could he have looked back into that   sluggish pit of the Burntwood through which they had come, or  could  he have seen into the heart of the still blacker swamp. 
  For through the swamp, feeling his way in the black abysses and   amid the monster-ghosts of darkness, came Peter. 
  And down the Burntwood, between the boggy mucklips of the swamp, a   man followed with slow but deadly surety, guiding with a long pole   two light cedar timbers which he had lashed together with wire,  and  which bore him safely and in triumph where the canoe had gone  before  him. 
  This man was Breault, the man-hunter. 
  &quot;The swamp will hold him!&quot; McKay was saying again, exultantly.   &quot;Even if he guesses our way, the swamp will hold him back, Nada.&quot; 
  &quot;But he won't know the way we have come,&quot; cried Nada, the faith in   her voice answering his own. &quot;Father John will guide him in  another  direction.&quot; 
  Back in the pit-gloom, with a grim smile now and then relaxing the   tight-set compression of his thin lips, and with eyes that stared   like a night-owl's into the gloom ahead of him, Breault poled   steadily on.
