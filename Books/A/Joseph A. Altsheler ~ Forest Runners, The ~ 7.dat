Shif'less Sol rose to a sitting position, and carefully cracked his  joints, one by one.    
"I wuz a bit afeard, Paul," he said, "that I had jest petrified, layin'  thar so long. A tired man likes to rest, but thar ain't no sense in  turnin' hisself into a stone image."    
Sol seemed so careless and easy that Paul drew an inference from his  manner.    
"You are not expecting anything more from them just now, Sol?"    
His nod toward the forest indicated the "them."    
"No, not yet a while," replied Shif'less Sol. "I guess they'll lay by  until night."    
His face showed some apprehension as he spoke of night, but it was gone  quickly. Shif'less Sol was not a man who took troubles to heart, else he  never would have earned his name.    
"We'll jest chaw a little more venison, Paul," he said. "I know you think  a drink o' water would go pow'ful well with it, an' so do I; but since it  ain't to be had, we'll jest do without it and say no more."    
The remainder of the day passed undisturbed, but as the first wan shade of  twilight appeared the men began to look closely to their arms. Horns were  held up to the light in order that the powder line might show, bullets  were counted, and flints examined. Paul knew what it all meant. The  Shawnees would attack in the darkness, and there would be all the  confusion of a midnight battle, when one might not be able to tell friend  from friend nor foe from foe. The sense of weirdness and awe overcame him  again. They were but the tiniest of atoms in that vast wilderness, which  would be just the same to-morrow and the next day, no matter who won.    
But Paul had in him the stuff of which heroes are made, and his strong  will brought his mind back to present needs. He, too, measured his powder  and counted his bullets, while he strove also to forget the hot thirst  that tormented him.    
The sun sank in the forest, the wan twilight deepened into shadow, and the  shadow darkened into night. The trees where the Shawnees lay hidden were  gone in the dusk, which hung so close that Paul could see but the nearest  of his comrades. Only the murmur of night insects and the faint rustle of  leaves came to his ears. The feeling of awe returned, and his blood grew  chill. Then it was a relief to him to know that he had a comrade in this  sensation.    
"Ef an owl would only hoot once or twice now," whispered Shif'less Sol, "I  think I'd jump right out o' my huntin' shirt."    
Paul laughed and felt better.    
"Now, Paul," continued Shif'less Sol, very gravely this time, "lemme give  you a piece o' mighty good advice. When the muss comes on, don't move  about much. Lay close. Stick to me an' Henry, an' then thar ain't so much  chance to git mixed up with them that's lookin' fur you here."    
"I'll remember what you say, Sol," replied Paul earnestly, as he girded  his spirit for action. He knew that the attack would come very soon, as  the Indians would choose the darkest period before the moon rose. Nor was  he wrong. The battle in the night began only a half hour later.    
Paul first saw a pink point appear in the darkness, but he knew that it  was the flame from a rifle shot. It came from a place not far away, to  which some Shawnee had crawled; but the hunters paid no attention to it,  nor to a second, nor to a third, as all the bullets flew wild. Paul,  forgetting for the moment that those bullets were sent to kill, became  engrossed in the spectacle of the fireworks. He was always wondering where  the next spurt of blue or pink flame would break through the darkness,  and the popping of the shots formed a not unpleasant sound in the night.    
"Comin' closer, comin' closer, Paul!" whispered Shif'less Sol. "One o'  them bullets flyin' in the dark may hit somethin' putty soon."    
Sol was a prophet. A hunter not far away uttered a low cry. He was struck  in the shoulder, but after the single cry he was silent. Henry was the  first to see one of the creeping brown bodies and fired, and after that  the shots on either side increased fast. It was all confused and terrible  to Paul. The darkness, instead of thinning to accustomed eyes, seemed to  him to grow heavier. The pin points of light from the rifle fire  multiplied themselves into hundreds, and the front of the foe shifted  about, as if they were trying to curve around the defenders.    
Paul could not definitely say that he saw a single savage, but he fired  now and then at the flashes of light, and also tried to obey Sol's  injunction about sticking close to him and Henry. But he was not always  sure that the figures near him were theirs, the darkness remaining so  intense. He heard occasional low cries, the light impact of bullets, and  the shuffling sound of feet, but he was fast losing any ordered view of  the battle. He knew now that the savages were very close, that the combat  was almost hand to hand, but he knew little else. The night enclosed all  the furious border conflict, and hid the loss or gain of either side from  all but the keenest eyes.    
Paul could never tell how long this lasted, but he felt confident that the  area of conflict was shifting. Having first faced one side, they were now  facing another, as the savages wheeled about them. He rose to his feet in  order to keep with his friends. He had been loading and firing more  rapidly than he knew, and the barrel of his rifle was hot to his touch. He  stood a moment listening for the savages, and then turned to two  indistinct figures near him.    
"Sol," he said, "can you and Henry see them?"    
The two indistinct figures suddenly became distinct, and sprang upon him.  He was seized in a powerful grasp and hurled down so violently that he  became unconscious for a little while. Why he was not killed he did not  know that night, nor ever after--probably they wished to show a trophy.  When he gathered his scattered senses he was being dragged away, and his  hands were bound. He was too dazed to cry aloud for rescue, but he  remembered afterwards that the battle behind him was waning at the time.    
He was dragged deeper into the forest, and the shots on the hill became  fainter and fewer. His sight cleared, but the darkness was so great that  he could yet see little except the warrior who pulled him along. Paul made  an effort and gained a better footing. It hurt his pride to be dragged,  and now he walked on in the path that the warrior indicated.    
They stopped after a while in an open space in the forest. The moon was  clearing a little, and Paul saw other warriors standing about. Nearly all  were wounded. Hideous and painted they were, with savage eyes filled with  rage and disappointment, and the looks they gave Paul made him consider  himself as one dead.    
As the moon cleared, more warriors drifted back into the glade. Some of  these, too, bore wounds, and Paul's heart leaped up with fierce joy as he  saw that they had been defeated. The firing had ceased and the wilderness  was returning to silence, broken only by the low words of the savages and  the soft sound of their moccasins on the earth.    
Paul was still in a sort of daze. The warriors were grouped about him,  their sole visible trophy of the battle, and they regarded him with  vengeful eyes. But he had passed through so much that he was not afraid.  His only feeling was that of dull stupefaction, and mingled with it a sort  of lingering pride that his comrades had been the victors, although he  himself was a prisoner. He did not know whether they would kill him or  take him with them, and at that moment his mind was so dulled that he felt  little curiosity about the question.    
A thin, sharp-faced warrior of middle years seemed to be the leader of the  band, and he talked briefly to the others. They nodded toward Paul, and  then, with a warrior on each side of the prisoner, they started northward.  Paul, his brain clearing, judged that they were taking him as a trophy, as  a prize to show in their village before putting him to death.    
They marched silently through the forest, curving far to the left of the  battlefield. The warriors were about a score in number, and Paul thought  they must have lost at least half as many in battle. Their hideous paint  and their savage faces filled him with repulsion. Their wild life and the  mystery of wild nature did not appeal to him as they had once appealed to  Henry in a similar position. To Paul, the chief thing about the wilderness  was the magnificent home it would make in the future for a great white  race. Spared for the present, he expected to live. Henry had saved him  once, and he and his comrades would come again to the rescue.    
He stumbled at first in their rapid flight from weakness, and the warrior  next to him struck him a blow as a reminder. Paul would have struck back,  but his hands were tied, and he could only guard himself against another  stumble. Pride sustained him.    
They did not stop until nearly dawn, when they camped by the bank of a  creek and ate. Paul's arms were unbound, and the hatchet-faced chief  tossed him a piece of venison, which he ate greedily because he was very  hungry. Then, as the warriors seemed in no hurry to move, he sagged slowly  over on his side and went to sleep. Despite his terrible situation, he was  so thoroughly worn out that he could not hold up his head any longer.    
When Paul awoke the sun was high, and he was lying where he had sunk down.  The warriors were about him, some sitting on the grass or lying full  length, but the party seemed more numerous than it was the night before.  He looked again. It was certainly more numerous, and there, too, sitting  near him, was a white youth of nearly his own age. Paul rose up, inspired  with a feeling of sympathy, and perhaps of comradeship, and then, to his  utter amazement, he saw that the youth was Braxton Wyatt, one of the boys  who had come over the mountains with the group that had settled Wareville.    
Braxton Wyatt, a year or two older than Paul, had always been disliked at  Wareville. Of a sarcastic, sneering, unpleasant temperament, he habitually  made enemies, and did not seem to care. Paul disliked him heartily, but in  this moment of sudden meeting he felt only sympathy and fellowship. They  were captives together, and all feeling of hostility was swept from his  mind.    
"Braxton!" he exclaimed. "Have they got you, too?"    
Wyatt rose up, came to Paul, and took his hand in the friendliest manner.    
"Yes, Paul," he said. "I was out hunting, thinking that there were no  savages south of the Ohio, and I was taken last night by a band which  joined yours this morning while you slept."    
"Why haven't they killed us?" asked Paul.    
"I suppose they'd rather show us to the tribe first, or maybe they think  they can adopt us, as Henry Ware was once. They haven't treated me badly."    
"That may be because you were taken without any loss to them," said Paul.  "We've had a big fight, and I'm the only one they got. Henry Ware, Tom  Ross, Shif'less Sol, and the others beat them off."    
"That was grand fighting!" said Braxton. "Tell me about it."    
Wyatt's fellowship and sympathy greatly cheered Paul, and he told in  detail about the battle with the band, and all that preceded it. Braxton  Wyatt listened with attention, but more than once expressed surprise.    
"How many did you say were left back there on the hill?" he asked at last.    
"We were ten when we began the fighting," replied Paul. "One that I know  of was killed, and it is likely that one or two more were. Then I'm gone.  Not more than six or seven can be left, but they are the best men in all  these woods. Twice their number of Indians cannot whip them."    
Paul said the last words proudly, and then he added:    
"Henry and Ross and Shif'less Sol will come for me. They'll be sure to do  it. And they'll rescue you, too."    
Braxton Wyatt looked thoughtful.    
"I think you're right," he said; "but it'll be a very risky thing for  them, especially if the Shawnees expect it. Be sure you don't let the  Indians think you are dreaming of such a thing."    
"Of course not," said Paul.    
The sharp-faced chief now came up, and said something to Wyatt. Braxton  replied in the Indian tongue.    
"I didn't know that you understood any Shawnee," said Paul in surprise, as  the chief turned away.    
"I've picked it up, a word here and a word there," replied Wyatt, "and I  find it very useful now. The Chief--Red Eagle is his name--says that if  you'll give 'em no trouble, he won't bind your hands again, for the  present, anyway. I've followed that plan, and I've found it a heap easier  for myself."    
Paul pondered a little. Braxton Wyatt's advice certainly seemed good, and  he did not wish to be bound again. It would be better to go along in  docile fashion.    
"All right, Braxton," he said, "I'll do as you suggest. We won't make them  any trouble now, but after a while we'll escape."    
"That's the best way," said Wyatt.    
Red Eagle and another warrior, who seemed to be his lieutenant, were  talking earnestly. The chief presently beckoned to Wyatt, who went over to  him and replied to several questions. But Wyatt came back in a few  moments, and took his seat again beside Paul.    
A half hour later they resumed the march, and Paul knew by the sun that  they were going northward. Hence he inferred that they would make no  further attack upon the white hunters, and were bound for what they  called home. Refreshed by his rest and sleep, and relieved by the removal  of the bandages from his wrists, he walked beside Wyatt with a springy  step, and his outlook upon life was fairly cheerful. It was wonderful what  the comradeship of one of his own kind did for him! After all, he had  probably been deceived about Braxton Wyatt. Merely because his ways were  not the ways of Henry and Paul was not proof that he was not the right  kind of fellow. Now he was sympathetic and helpful enough, when sympathy  and help were needed.    
The march northward was leisurely. The Shawnees seemed to have no further  expectation of meeting a foe, and they were not so vigilant. Paul and  Braxton Wyatt were kept in the center of the group, but they were  permitted to talk as much as they pleased, and Paul was not annoyed by any  blow or kick.    
"Have you any idea how far it is to their village, Braxton?" Paul asked.    
"A long distance," replied Wyatt. "We shall not be there under two weeks,  and as the party may turn aside for hunting or something else, it may be  much longer."    
"It will give Henry and Ross and the others more time to rescue us," said  Paul.    
Braxton Wyatt shrugged his shoulders.    
"I wouldn't put much hope in that if I were you, Paul," he said. "This  band is very strong. Since the two parties joined it numbers forty  warriors, and our friends could do nothing. We must pretend to like them,  to fall in with their ways, and to behave as if we liked the wild life as  well as that back in the settlements, and in time would like it better."    
"I could never do that," said Paul. "All kinds of savages repel me."    
Braxton Wyatt shrugged his shoulders again.    
"One must do the best he can," he said briefly.    
The leisurely march proceeded, and they camped the next afternoon in the  midst of a magnificent forest of beech, oak, and hickory, building a great  fire, and lounging about it in apparently careless fashion. But Paul was  enough of a woodsman to know that some of the warriors were on watch, and  he and Braxton, as usual, were compelled to sit in the center of the  group, where there was no shadow of a chance to escape.    
Hunters whom they had sent out presently brought in the bodies of two  deer, and then they had a great feast. The venison was half cooked in  strips and chunks over the coals, and the warriors ate it voraciously,  chattering to each other, meanwhile, as Paul did not know that Indians  ever talked.    
"What are they saying, Braxton?" he asked.    
"I can't catch it very well," replied Wyatt, "but I think they are talking  about a stay near the Ohio--for hunting, I suppose. That ought to be a  good thing for us, because they certainly will not decide about our fate  until we get back to their village, and the more they are used to us the  less likely they are to put us to death."    
Paul watched the warriors eating, and they were more repellent to him than  ever. Savages they were, and nothing could make them anything else. His  ways could never become their ways. But the fresh deer meat looked very  good, and the pleasant aroma filled his nostrils. Braxton Wyatt noticed  his face.    
"Are you hungry, Paul?" he asked.    
"No, not hungry; merely starving to death."    
Wyatt laughed.    
"I'm in the same condition," he said, "but I can soon change it."    
He spoke to Red Eagle, and the thin-faced chief nodded. Then Braxton  picked up two sharpened sticks that the savages had used, and also two  large pieces of venison. One stick and one piece he handed to Paul.    
"Now we also will cook and dine," he said.    
Paul's heart warmed toward Braxton Wyatt. Certainly he had done him wrong  in his thoughts when they lived at Wareville. But he was thinking the  next moment about the pleasant odor of the deer meat as he fried it over  the coals. Then he ate hungrily, and with a full stomach came peace for  the present, and confidence in the future. He slept heavily that night,  stretched on the ground before the fire, near Braxton Wyatt, and he did  not awaken until late the next morning.    
The Indians were very slow and leisurely about departing, and Paul  realized now that, vigilant and wonderful as they were in action, they  were slothful and careless when not on the war path, or busy with the  chase. He saw, also, that the band was entirely too strong to be attacked  by Henry and his friends.    
They marched northward several days more, at the same dawdling pace, and  then they stopped a week at one place for the hunting. Half the warriors  would go into the forest, and the next day the other half would go, the  first remaining. They brought in an abundance of game, and Paul never  before saw men eat as they ate. It seemed to him that they must be trying  to atone for a fast of at least six months, and those who were not hunting  that day would lie around the fire for hours like animals digesting their  food. He and Braxton Wyatt were still treated well, and their hands  remained unbound, although they were never allowed to leave the group of  warriors.    
Paul was glad enough of the rest and delay, but the life of the Shawnees  did not please him. He was too fastidious by nature to like their  alternate fits of laziness and energy, their gluttony and lethargy  afterwards, but he took care not to show his repulsion. He acted upon  Wyatt's advice, and behaved in the friendliest manner that he could assume  toward his captors. Wyatt once spoke his approval. "The Chief, Red Eagle,  thinks of adopting you, if you should fall into their ways," said Wyatt.    
"He may adopt me, but I'll never adopt him," replied Paul sturdily.    
But Wyatt only laughed and shrugged his shoulders, after his fashion.    
A few days later they reached the Ohio. It was running bankful, and where  Paul saw it the stream was a mile wide, a magnificent river, cutting off  the unknown south from the unknown north, and bearing on its yellow bosom  silt from lands hundreds of miles away. The warriors took hidden canoes  from the forest at the shore, and Paul thought they would cross at once  and continue their journey northward, but they did not do so. Instead,  they dawdled about in the thick forest that clothed the southern bank, and  ate more venison and buffalo meat, although they did not kindle any fire.  A day or two passed thus amid glorious sunshine, and Paul still could not  understand why they waited.    
Meanwhile he still clung tenaciously to his great hope. He might escape,  he might be rescued, and then Henry and he would resume their task which  would help so much to save Kentucky. No matter what happened, Paul would  never lose sight of this end.
