The wildflowers were on the green hills: the flame-colored velvet skinned  poppy, the purple and yellow lupins, the pale blue "babyeyes," buttercups,  dandelions and sweetbrier, fields of yellow mustard. The gardens about  the Bay and down the Peninsula were almost licentious in their vehement  indulgence in color. Every flower that grows north, south, east, west, on  the western hemisphere and the eastern, was to be found in some one of  these gardens of Central California; the poinsettia cheek by jowl with  periwinkle and the hedges of marguerite; heavy-laden trees of magnolia  above beds of Russian violets. Pomegranate trees and sweet peas,  bridal wreath and camellia, begonia, fuchsias, heliotrope, hydrangea,  chrysanthemums, roses, roses, roses....Little orchards of almond trees,  their blossoms a pink mist against a clear blue sky....The mariposa lily  was awake in the forests; infinitesimal yellow pansies made a soft carpet  for the feet of the deer and the puma....In the old Spanish towns of the  south, the Castilian roses were in bloom and as sweet and pink and  poignant as when Rezanov sailed through the Golden Gate in the April of  eighteen-six, or Chonita Iturbi y Moncada, the doomswoman, danced on the  hearts of men in Monterey....From end to end of the great Santa Clara  Valley the fruit trees were in bloom, a hundred thousand acres and more of  pure white blossoms or delicate pink. Bascom Luning took Alexina over it  one day in his air-car, as she called it, and from above it looked like a  scented sea that was all foam.    
But no such riot and glory had come to San Francisco. This was the season  for winds that seemed to blow from the four points of the compass at  once and of ghostly fogs that stole up and down the streets of the city,  abandoning the hills to bank in the valleys, as if seeking warmth; abruptly  deserting the lowlands to prowl along the heights, always searching,  searching, these pure white lovely fogs of San Francisco, for something  lost and never found.

"I hope they're not too artistic to keep their rooms warm," said Aileen,  as they drove from her house where Gora and Alexina had dined, down to  the Club of the Seven Arts. "I have smoked so much, intending to prove in  public how really virtuous a society girl is, in contrast to Bohemia, that  I'm nearly frozen."    
"Keep your wrap on," said Alexina. "Who cares? I have always been wild to  get into real Bohemian circles, meet authors and artists. We do lead the  most provincial life. All circles should overlap--the best of all, anyhow.  That is the way I would remold society if I were rich and powerful--"    
"Good heavens Alex, you are not idealizing this crowd we are going to meet  to-night? They're just a lot of second and third raters--"    
"What do you know about them?"    
"I keep my feet on the ground and my head out of the clouds. I know more or  less what it must be. Besides, the last time I was in New York I was taken  several times to the restaurants and studios of Greenwich Village. I could  only convey my opinion of it in many swear words. This must be a sort of  chromo of it....Gora, are you as wildly excited as Alex is? I know she is  because her spine is rigid; and she is probably colder than I am."    
"Well, anyhow," said Alexina defiantly, "it will be something I never saw  before."    
"It will, darling. Well. Gora, what do you anticipate?"    
Gora laughed. "I wonder? I don't think I've thought much about it. The  circumstances of my life have developed the habit of switching off my  imagination except when I am at my desk. I've also formed the habit of  taking things as they come. I'll manage to extract something from this, one  way or another."    
<b>III</b>    
The car stopped before a narrow house in the rebuilt portion of the city.  The door was opened immediately and the three guests of honor, apparently  very late, as a large room beyond the vestibule appeared to be crowded,  were marshaled up a narrow stair into a dressing-room under the eaves.    
"Looks like the loft of a barn," grumbled Aileen. There was no attendant to  hear. "Well, I'm not going to leave my cloak, for several reasons--only one  of which is that if this room is a sample my ill-covered bones will rattle  together downstairs."    
She wore a gown of black chiffon with a green jade necklace and a band of  green in her fashionably done fair hair. Alexina's gown was a soft white  satin that fitted closely and made her look very tall and slim and round,  the corsage trimmed with the only color she ever wore. Her hair was done in  a classic knot and held with a comb--a present from Aileen--designed from  periwinkles and green leaves and sparkling dew-drops.    
Gora shook out the skirt of her only evening-gown, a well-made black satin,  very severe, but always relieved by a flower of some sort. To-night she  wore a poinsettia, whose peculiarly vivid red brought out the warm browns  of her skin and hair. She had a superb neck and shoulders and bust, and the  skin of her body was a delicate honey color that melted imperceptibly into  the deeper tones of her throat and face.    
"Alexina," she said, "let us perish but exhibit all our points. Your arms  and hands were modeled for some untraced Greek ancestress and born again.  Your neck is almost as good as mine, if not quite so solid...."    
She had a spot of crimson on her high cheek bones and admitted to the  discerning Aileen that she was the least bit excited. After all, the  keenest brains of San Francisco might be down in that long raftered room  they had glimpsed, and in any case she was about to be judged by a new  standard.    
"Oh, don't let that worry you," Aileen began.    
A door at the end of the room opened abruptly and a small woman came  forward almost panting. "I just ran up those stairs," she cried. "But I was  bound to be the first. I used to go to school with your mother down on Bush  Street--dear Minnie Morrison!"    
She was a woman of fifty or sixty, with a nose like an inflamed button,  eyes that watered freely, and a shabby black hat somewhat on one side.    
"But my mother never went to school in San Francisco," said Gora stiffly,  and eyeing this first precipitate member of the intellectual world with  profound disfavor.    
"Oh, yes, she did. We were the most intimate friends. To think that dear  Minnie's daughter--"    
"Her name was not Minnie Morrison--"    
'Oh, yes, it was--"    
"Don't mind her so much, Gora dear." Aileen did not trouble to lower her  voice. "She's drunk. Let's go down."    
Another woman entered the same door almost as hastily, but she was a  stately and rather handsome woman of forty, who gave the intruder such a  withering look from her serene blue eyes that the unrefined member of the  Seven Arts slunk out and could be heard stumbling down the stairs.    
"I followed as soon as some one told me that Miss Skeers had come up here,"  she said apologetically. "She is not always herself, poor thing. Once  she was quite distinguished as a local magazine writer, but...well, you  know...all people do not have the good fortune to have their genius  universally recognized, and the results are sometimes disastrous. We are  so proud to welcome you to-night, Miss Dwight, and--and--your charming  friends. I am Jane Upton Halsey." She appeared to think no further  explanation necessary.    
"Oh, yes," murmured the bewildered Gora. "It was you who wrote to me."    
"Exactly. I am chairman of the reception committee." She looked expectant,  then piqued, and added hastily: "Will you come downstairs? What lovely  gowns. I should like to paint you all."    
She herself was a symphony in pink ("dago pink," whispered Aileen  wickedly), and she wore a small pink silk turban, apparently made from the  same bolt as the gown.    
"Perhaps we should have worn hats," said Gora nervously. "I didn't know--I  thought..."    
"You are just all right. Anything goes here. We wear what's becoming,  what we can afford, and what is our own idea of the right thing. Nobody  criticizes anybody else."    
"Now, this is life!" said Alexina to Aileen. "You will admit we never found  anything like that before."    
"Just you watch and catch them criticizing us....Rather effective--what?"    
They were descending a staircase that led directly into the crowded room  below, and they looked down upon a mass of upturned expectant faces, Gora  was ahead with Miss Halsey, and as she reached the floor the faces  changed their angle; it was apparent that they were not interested in her  satellites.    
"Let's stop here for a moment and watch," said Alexina. "It's too  interesting. They look as if they'd eat her alive."    
The whole company seemed to be seething about Gora, and as they were  rapidly presented by Miss Halsey and passed on they produced the effect,  in the inner circles, of a maelstrom. On the outer edge the women frankly  stood on chairs to get a better look at the new lion, or pushed forward  with frenzied determination to the fixed center of the whirlpool, whose  gracious smile was becoming strained.    
"Poor Gora!" said Aileen. "We do it better. A few picked souls at a time;  or, even when it's a tea, just casual introductions at decent intervals,  and not too many references to the immortal work."    
"It's simply great for Gora, anyhow; for, big or little, they're her own  sort. And they're not snobs, They don't care tuppence for us."    
"You're right there. I went to a big reception of all the arts in Paris  once and the only people any one kowtowed to were two disgustingly rich  New York women who had never done anything. But no one can be blamed for  national characteristics. Heavens! What an olla podrida!"    
Some of the men were in evening dress, but the greater number were not.  They were of all ages, shaves, neckties and haircuts. The women wore every  variety of hat, from an immense sailor perched above an immense fat face,  above an immense shirtwaist bust, to minute turbans and waving plumes. They  wore tailored suits, high "one piece" frocks of any material from chiffon  to serge, symphonic confections like Miss Halsey's, and flowing robes  presumably artistic. None wore full evening dress except the guests of  honor. All, however, did not wear hats, and they arranged their hair as  individually as Alexina.    
<b>IV</b>    
"This may be our chance to see the art exhibit," said Aileen. "They'll  remember us in time, or Gora will...."    
They descended into the room but had waited too long. Miss Halsey, turning  the guest of honor over to the second in command, a woman of portentous  seriousness, made her way hastily to the mere butterflies; who endeavored  vainly to slink away under cover of the rotating crowd.    
"You won't think me rude, I hope," she cried, "but I had to start things  going, and it is awkward for all to introduce three people at a time."    
"You were most considerate," said Alexina amiably. "But we only came to  witness Gora's triumph, and we enjoy looking on, anyhow....We were about to  look at the pictures...."    
"You must meet some of our more brilliant members," said Miss Halsey  firmly. "They would never forgive me, and have been almost as excited at  meeting two such distinguished members of society as at meeting Miss Dwight  herself. Now, if you...if you...that is..."    
"Our names are Jane Boughton and Mamie Featherhurst," supplied Aileen,  transfixing the lady with her wicked green eyes.    
"Oh, yes, to be sure...there has been so much to think of...but your names  are so often in the society columns...it seems to me I recall that one of  you is the daughter of a famous judge--"    
"Boughton. He's under indictment, you know, for graft, bribery, and  corruption."    
"Oh...ah...how unfortunate," Miss Halsey's jaw fell. Even she had  heard--vaguely in her studio--of the scandal of Judge Boughton, and she  wondered how she had been so absent-minded as to invite a member of his  family to the club.    
"You see," said Aileen coolly. "I am not fit to associate with your  members, and as Miss Featherhurst is still my loyal friend, we'll just go  over and sit in a corner--"    
"Indeed you shall do nothing of the kind. You are our guests, and--please  for this evening forget everything else."    
"You nasty little beast," hissed Alexina into Aileen's discomforted ear.  "She's worth two of you."    
"So she is," said Aileen contritely, "I'll behave better."    
Miss Halsey, who had been signaling several members and rounding up others,  returned, Alexina blazed her eyes at Aileen, who murmured hastily to the  hostess: "I was just joking. I am Judge Lawton's daughter, and this is Mrs.  Mortimer Dwight, Gora's sister-in-law. I'd never have told such a whopper  but I'm so nervous and shy. I didn't think I could go through the ordeal."    
"Oh, you poor child. Well, you'll find we're not terrible in the least.  Now, don't try to remember names. They'll remember yours--better than I  did!"    
Another small eddying circle formed about the luminaries from a lower  sphere. This proved to be much like similar performances in any stratum of  society. All murmured platitudes, or nothing. Nobody tried to be original  or witty. Alexina and Aileen gradually disengaged themselves and were  making their way toward the pictures that turned the four walls into a  harmonious mass of color, when an old man came tottering up. He had bright,  eyes and a pleasant face.    
"Which is Mrs. Dwight?" he asked eagerly. Alexina bent her lofty head and  smiled down upon him.    
"Of course. Little Alexina. I remember you when you were a dear little girl  and I used to see you playing about the house when I went up to have a  good powwow with that clever grandfather of yours, Alex Groome--one of the  ablest politicians this town ever had; and straight, damn straight."    
"Alexander Groome was my father."    
"Oh, no, he wasn't. He was your grandfather. You are the daughter...let me  see...there were two or three young ladies....I remember when they came out  in the eighties...and a boy or two...."    
"I am sorry to be rude, but Alexander Groome was my father. I came along  rather late."    
"Impossible!...Well, I suppose you know best..." and he drifted off.    
"This seems to be a home for incurables," said Aileen. "I am sure I don't  know how I shall get through the evening. Gora has a slight sense of humor,  you have quite a keen one, but mine is positively fiendish....Oh, Lord!"    
Miss Halsey was trailing them, her hand resting lightly on the arm of  another woman.    
"Now this is something like," whispered Aileen. "Witch of Endor got up to  look like Carmen."    
The oncoming luminary was a singular-looking woman who may have been  considerably less so in the privacy of her dressing-room; she had evidently  expended much thought upon supplementing the niggardliness of Nature. Her  unwashed-looking black hair was dressed very high and stuck with immense  pins. Large, circular, highly colored, imitation jade rings dangled in  tiers from her ear-lobes, and at least eight rows of colored beads covered  the front of her loose, fringed, embroidered, beaded gown. She had a  haggard face, deeply lined and badly painted, but something, an emanation  perhaps, seemed to proclaim that she was still young.    
"This, dear Mrs. Dwight and Miss Lawton, is Alma De Quincey Smith, with  whose work you are of course familiar. She had her reception last week but  was only too glad to come to-night and extend the welcoming hand of the  east to our new daughter of the west."    
Miss De Quincey Smith barely gave her time to finish. She darted forward  and grasped Aileen's hand. "Oh, you must let me tell you how wonderful I  think your unique green eyes go with that jade. I've been watching you!"  She spoke with the eager unthinking impulsiveness of a child, which, oddly,  made her look like a very old woman.    
"Too nice of you," murmured Aileen, who was determined to behave.    
"And you!" she cried, turning to Alexina. "Your eyes simply blaze. You look  like a long white arum lily. And dusky hair, not merely black. Oh, I do  think you are both too wonderful, and I am sure all these splendid artists  here will want to paint you."    
Alexina and Aileen were not accustomed to such spontaneous and unbridled  admiration and they thought Miss Smith quite fascinating if rather queer.  But Miss Smith did not number tact among her gifts and rushed on.    
"Gora Dwight is too wonderful looking for words. We are all crazy over  her. All the artists want to paint her already. Her coloring and style are  unique and she suggests tragedy--with those marvelous pale eyes in that  dark face--those heavy dark brows and heavy masses of hair. I have  suggested that Folkes--your greatest portrait painter, you know,--paint  her as Medea, or as the Genius of the Revolution, How proud you must be of  her!"    
"So we are," murmured Aileen. "We think she is the only woman writer in  America worth mentioning. Why don't you paint her yourself?"    
"I? I am not an artist--with the brush! I am an author, Alma De Quincey  Smith."    
"Oh!..." Aileen's voice trailed off vaguely, "What do you write? Plays?  Essays?..."    
"I--why, I'm one of the best--my stories appear constantly in the best  magazines." Miss Smith, who had been deserted some time since by Miss  Halsey, looked abject, helpless, and infuriated.    
"Oh! We only read the worst. It must be wonderful to be famous. Come, Alex,  we must see the pictures. They're going to have music and supper later."    
<b>V</b>    
"Nevertheless," said Alexina, "they are real as far as they go, and they  really do things, good or bad. They work, they aspire; they dream, and  perhaps with reason, of a glorious future, when they will be as famous and  successful as the founders of the club. Even if they fail they will have  had the wonderful dream. Nothing can take that from them. I envy them--envy  them!"    
They were standing in a far corner of the room, after having examined three  or four admirable and many passable paintings. Aileen looked at her in  surprise. They had both been remarking upon the comic aspects of the  intellectual life, and Alexina's outburst was unexpected. Aileen had  seldom seen her vehement since they had outgrown their youthful habit of  wrangling. She was still more astonished when she turned from a view of the  Latin-seeming roofs of San Francisco from Twin Peaks, to Alexina's face. It  looked drawn and desperate.    
"Well, most of them will fail," she said lightly. "Look at these pictures!  That is what is the matter with California--too much talent. You must be as  individual as a talking monkey to get your head above the crowd. All these  poor devils are doomed to the local reputation."    
"Even so they have something to live for, mean something, do something.  What do I mean to myself or anyone? What have I accomplished? The man I  married is a dummy-husband; means nothing to me nor I to him. I have no  children. Even my housekeeping for Maria is a farce; James really does it  all. I mean nothing to society now that I can no longer entertain it. I  haven't even a decent vice. I don't smoke and gamble like you, nor have  lovers like some of the others. I'm simply a nonentity--nothing!"    
"You have personality...beauty...." Aileen was completely at a loss. "I  hate being banal like that Smith idiot...but you are the perfection of a  type. That is something. And you cultivate your mind--"    
"My mind! What does it amount to? Anybody can pack a brain. I'd like one of  those that gives out something, however little. But I can't help that. The  point is I don't live. I don't care a hang about personality that doesn't  get anywhere, and I care still less about being a finished type--that's the  work of dead and gone ancestors, anyhow, not mine....I wish I could fall in  love with James Kirkpatrick. I'd feel more justified in my own eyes if I  were living with him over in the Mission--"    
"His old mother would chase you out with a broom and use Biblical language.  Of course I know you must be bored, Alex dear. Can't you manage to go  abroad and live for a time?"    
"No, I can't, and I don't see what difference that would make. But I'll  tell you what I shall do. If Tom and Maria want to rent the house next year  they can have it but I'll not live there. I'll not be 'held up' any longer.  I'll stand on my own feet--in other words get a job. No--I've some loose  money, I'll start in business."    
"Good for you. Perhaps dad'll let me go in with you. Don't imagine I don't  get sick of my racketing life; and when I have a spasm of reform I nearly  take seriously to drink, I'm so bored. Would you have me for partner?"    
"Wouldn't I? That is if you would be serious about it. I am, let me tell  you. The whole family can perform suttee for all I care. I'm going to do  something that will give me a place in the main stream of life."    
"Trust me. I have been considering Bob's fifteenth proposal--Mr. Cheever  has promised him a full partnership the day he marries, and it wouldn't  be so bad. Bobby is a good sport, and we'd live the out-door life at  Burlingame instead of the in--sports...tournaments...polo...cut out  dissipation. We've both really had enough of it. But I believe business  would be more interesting. After all that's what you marry for unless you  want children--which I don't--to be interested. What'll we be? Decorators?"    
"I suppose so. But all this has only just come to a head, although I know  now that it has been slowly gathering force in my deepest deeps. If we do  I'll take Alice on. She's sick of the game too and she has simply ripping  ideas."    
"Perfect. 'Dwight, Thorn--', no, 'Thorndyke, Lawton and Dwight.' I'm too  excited--convicts must feel like that when they tunnel a hole and get out.  It will be our real, our first adventure."
