But Alexander had small liking for his employment. He had as much  affinity with the sordid routine of a general store and counting-house  as Tom Mitchell had with the angels. But pride and ambition carried him  through most of the distasteful experiences of his life. He would come  short in nothing, and at that tender age, when his relatives were  prepared to forgive his failures with good-humoured tact, he was willing  to sacrifice even his books to clerical success. He soon discovered that  he had that order of mind which concentrates without effort upon what  ever demands its powers,--masters the detail of it with incredible  swiftness. At first he was a general clerk, and attended to the loading  and unloading of Mr. Cruger's sloops; after a time he was made  bookkeeper; it was not long before he was in charge of the  counting-house. He got back to his books in time--for business in the  Islands finishes at four o'clock--and when he had learned all the Latin,  Greek, Hebrew, and mathematics Hugh Knox could teach him, he spent his  leisure hours with Pope, Plutarch, Shakespeare, Milton, Plato, and the  few other English poets and works of Greek philosophers which Knox  possessed, as well as several abridged histories of England and Europe.  These interested him more than aught else, purely literary as his  proclivities were supposed to be, and he read and reread them, and  longed for some huge work in twenty volumes which should reveal Europe  to his searching vision. But this was when he was fourteen, and had  almost forgotten what the life of a mere boy was like. Shortly after he  entered Mr. Cruger's store he wrote his famous letter to young Stevens.  It will bear republication here, and its stilted tone, so different from  the concise simplicity of his business letters, was no doubt designed to  produce an effect on the mind of his more fortunate friend. He became a  master of style, and before he was twenty; but there is small indication  of the achievement in this letter, lovable as it is:--    <blockquote>
 ST. CROIX, November 11, 1769.    
 DEAR EDWARD, This serves to acknowledge the receipt of yours per   Capt. Lowndes, which was delivered me yesterday The truth of Capt.   Lightbowen and Lowndes' information is now verified by the presence   of your father and sister, for whose safe arrival I pray, and that   they may convey that satisfaction to your soul, that must naturally   flow from the sight of absent friends in health; and shall for news   this way, refer you to them.    
 As to what you say, respecting your soon having the happiness of   seeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of your hopes, provided   they are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not; though doubt   whether I shall be present or not, for to confess my weakness, Ned,   my ambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling   condition of a clerk, or the like, to which my fortune condemns me,   and would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt   my station. I am confident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any   hopes of immediate preferment, nor do I desire it; but I mean to   prepare the way for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may   be justly said to build castles in the air; my folly makes me   ashamed, and beg you'll conceal it; yet, Neddy, we have seen such   schemes successful, when the projector is constant. I shall   conclude by saying I wish there was a war.    
 I am, Dear Edward, Yours    
 ALEX. HAMILTON.    
 P.S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, and pleased to   see you give such close application to study.</blockquote>    
He hoped that in time Mr. Cruger would find it necessary to send him to  New York; but his employer found him too useful on St. Croix, and  recognized his abilities, not to the extent of advancing his  intellectual interests, but of taxing and developing his capacity for  business and its heavy responsibilities. In the following year he placed  him in temporary charge of his branch house, in Frederikstadt, and  Alexander never wished for war so desperately as when he stood under the  arcade on Bay Street and stared out at the shallow green roadstead and  the inimitable ocean beyond. Frederikstadt was a hamlet compared to  Christianstadt, and unredeemed--the arcades excepting--by any of the  capital's architectural or natural beauty. Alexander believed it to be  the hottest, dullest, and most depressing spot on either hemisphere. The  merchants and other residents were astonished that Nicolas Cruger should  send a lad of thirteen to represent him in matters which involved large  sums of money, but they recognized young Hamilton's ability even while  they stared with some rudeness at the small figure in white linen, and  the keen but very boyish face. When they passed him under the arcades,  and asked him what ship he expected to heave in sight, he was tempted to  say a man-of-war, but had no mind to reveal himself to the indifferent.  He read from sundown until midnight or later, by the light of two long  candles protected from draughts and insects by curving glass chimneys.  Mosquitoes tormented him and cockroaches as long as his hand ran over  the table; occasionally a land-crab rattled across the room, or a  centipede appeared on the open page. But he was accustomed to these  embellishments of tropic life, and although he anathematized them and  the heat, he went on with his studies. It was about this time that he  began to indulge in literary composition; and although less gifted boys  than Alexander Hamilton struggle through this phase of mental  development as their body runs the gamut of juvenile complaints, still  it may be that had not his enormous energies been demanded in their  entirety by a country in the terrible straits of rebirth, or had he  dwelt on earth twenty years longer, he would have realized the ambitions  of his mother and Hugh Knox, and become one of the greatest literary  forces the world has had. But although this exercise of his restless  faculties gave him pleasure, it was far from satisfying him, even then.  He wanted the knowledge that was locked up in vast libraries far beyond  that blinding stretch of sea, and he wanted action, and a sight of and a  part in the great world. Meanwhile, he read every book he could find on  the Island, made no mistakes in Mr. Cruger's counting-house, and stood  dreaming under the arcade for hours at a time, muttering his thoughts,  his mobile features expressing the ceaseless action of his brain.    
Sometime during the previous year Peter Levine had returned to St. Croix  for his health, and he remained with relatives for some time. He and  Alexander met occasionally and were friendly. As he was a decent little  chap our hero forgave him his paternity, although he never could quite  assimilate the fact that he was his mother's child.    
Alexander returned, after six months of Frederikstadt, to the East End  of the Island. A few months later, Mr. Cruger, whose health had failed,  went to New York for an extended sojourn, leaving the entire  responsibility of the business in young Hamilton's hands. Men of all  ages were forced to obey and be guided by a boy in the last weeks of his  fourteenth year, and there were many manifestations of jealous ill-will.  Some loved, others hated him, but few submitted gracefully to a  leadership which lowered their self-esteem. For the first time Alexander  learned that even a mercantile life can be interesting. He exercised all  the resources of his inborn tact with those who had loved and those who  did not hate him, and won them to a grateful acceptance of a mastership  which was far more considerate and sympathetic than anything they had  known. As for his enemies, he let them see the implacable quality of his  temper, mortified them by an incessant exposure of their failings,  struck aside their clumsy attempts to humiliate him with the keen blade  of a wit that sent them skulking. Finally they submitted, but they  cursed him, and willingly would have wrung his neck and flung him into  the bay. As for Hamilton, there was no compromise in him, even then,  where his enemies were concerned. He enjoyed their futile wrath, and  would not have lifted his finger to flash it into liking.    
Only once the tropical passions of his inheritance conquered his desire  to dominate through the forces of his will alone. One of the oldest  employees, a man named Cutter, had shown jealousy of young Hamilton from  the first, and a few days after Mr. Cruger's departure began to manifest  signs of open rebellion. He did his work ill, or not at all, absented  himself from the store for two days, and returned to his post without  excuse, squaring his shoulders about the place and sneering his contempt  of youthful cocks of the walk. Alexander struggled to maintain a  self-control which he felt to be strictly compatible with the dignity of  his position, although his gorge rose so high that it threatened to  choke him. The climax came when he gave Cutter a peremptory order, and  the man took out a cigar, lit it, and laughed in his face. For the next  few moments Alexander had a confused impression that he was in hell,  struggling his way through the roar and confusion of his nether  quarters. When he was himself again he was in the arms of his chief  assistant, and Mr. Cutter bled profusely on the floor. He was informed  later that he had "gone straight over the counter with a face like a  hurricane" and assaulted his refractory hireling with such incredible  rapidity of scientific fist that the man, who was twice his size, had  succumbed from astonishment and an almost supernatural terror.  Alexander, who was ashamed of himself, apologized at once, but gave the  man his choice of treating him with proper respect or leaving the store.  Cutter answered respectfully that he would remain; and he gave no  further trouble.    
"You'll get your head blown off one of these days," said Hugh Knox to  Alexander, on a Sunday, as they sat in the library over two long glasses  of "Miss Blyden," a fashionable drink made of sugar, rum, and the juice  of the prickly pear, which had been buried in the divine's garden for  the requisite number of months. "These Creoles are hot, even when  they're only Danes. It's not pleasant for those clerks, for it isn't as  if you had the look of the man you are. You look even younger than your  age, and for a man of thirty to say 'Yes, sir' to a brat like you chokes  him, and no wonder. I believe if there was a war this minute, you'd  rouse the Island and lead it to battle without a misgiving or an  apology. Well, don't let your triumphs lead to love of this business. I  happen to know that Cruger means to make a partner of you in a few  years, for he thinks the like of you never dropped into a merchant's  counting-house; but never forget that your exalted destiny is to be a  great man of letters, a historian, belike. You're taking to history, I  notice, and you're getting a fine vocabulary of your own."    
"I'd like to know what I'll write the history of if I'm to rot in this  God-forsaken place. Caribs? Puling rows between French and English? I'd  as well be up on Grange with my mother if it wasn't for you and your  books. I want the education of a collegian. I want to study and read  everything there is to be studied and read. I've made out a list of  books to send for, when I've money enough, as long as you are. It's  pinned on the wall of my room."    
"And I suppose you've never a qualm but that head of yours will hold it  all. You've a grand opinion of yourself, Alec."    
"That's a cutting thing for you to say to me, sir," cried Alexander,  springing to his feet. "I thought you loved me. If you think I'm a fool,  I'll not waste more of your time."    
"A West Indian temper beats the conceit out of the Irish. You'll control  yours when you're older, for there's nothing you won't do when you put  your mind to it, and you'll see the need for not making a fool of  yourself too often. But as for its present liking for exercise--it's a  long way the liveliest thing on St. Croix. However, you've forgiven me;  I know that by the twinkle in your eye, so I'll tell you that your brain  will hold all you care to put into it, and that you'll have made another  list as long as King Street before you're five years older. Meanwhile,  I've some books on theology and ethics you haven't had a dash at yet,  and you can't read my other old books too often. Each time you'll find  something new. Sitting up till midnight won't hurt you, but don't forget  to say your prayers."    
Knox, long since, had laid siege to Alexander's susceptible and ardent  mind with the lively batteries of his religious enthusiasms. His  favourite pupil was edifyingly regular in attendance at church, and said  his prayers with much fervour. The burden of his petitions was  deliverance from St. Croix.    
When this deliverance was effected by a thunderbolt from heaven, his  saving sense of humour and the agitated springs of his sympathy forbade  a purely personal application. But twenty years later he might have  reflected upon the opportune cause of his departure from St. Croix as  one of the ironies of the world's history; for an Island was devastated,  men were ruined, scores were killed, that one man might reach his proper  sphere of usefulness.
