Although Hamilton and Clinton had no liking for each other, they were  far from being the furious principals in one of those political hatreds  which the times were about to engender,--an intellectual cataclysm which  Hamilton was to experience in all its blackness, of which he was to be  the most conspicuous victim. He had by no means plumbed his depths as  yet. So far he had met with few disappointments, few stumbling blocks,  never a dead wall. Life had smiled upon him as if magnetized. At home he  found perfect peace, abroad augmenting ranks of followers, sufficient  work to use up his nervous energies, and the stimulant of enmity and  opposition that he loved. It was long since he had given way to rage,  although he flew into a temper occasionally. He told himself he was  become a philosopher, and was far from suspecting the terrible passions  which the future was to undam. His mother, with dying insight, had  divined the depth and fury of a nature which was all light on the  surface, and in its upper half a bewildering but harmonious  intermingling of strength, energy, tenderness, indomitability,  generosity, and intense emotionalism: a stratum so large and so  generously endowed that no one else, least of all himself, had suspected  that primeval inheritance which might blaze to ashes one of the most  nicely balanced judgements ever bestowed on a mortal, should his enemies  combine and beat his own great strength to the dust.    
But when Hamilton and Clinton approached the Court-house from opposite  directions, on the morning of the 17th, they did not cross the street to  avoid meeting, although they bowed with extreme formality and measured  each other with a keen and speculative regard. Clinton was now  forty-nine years old, his autocratic will, love of power, and knowledge  of men, in their contemptuous maturity. He was a large man, with the  military bearing of the born and finished martinet, a long hard nose,  and an irritated eye. The irritation kindled as it met Hamilton's, which  was sparkling with the eager determination of a youth which, although  desirable in itself, was become a presumption when pitted against those  eighteen additional distinguished years of the Governor of New York.  That there was a twinkle of amusement in the Federalist's eye was also  to his discredit.    
"The young fop," fumed Clinton, as he brushed a fleck of mud from his  own magnificent costume of black ducape, "he is the <i>enfant gate</i> of  politics, and I shall settle him here once for all. It will be a public  benefaction."    
The Court-house, which stood halfway up the hill, on the corner of Main  and East streets, and was surrounded by the shade of many maples, was a  two-story building of rough stones welded together by a ruder cement.  The roof sloped, and above was a belfry. The Convention was held in the  upper story, which was unbroken by partition; and with the windows open  upon what looked to be a virgin forest, so many were the ancient trees  remaining in the little town, the singing of birds, the shrilling of  crickets, the murmur of the leaves in an almost constant breeze, the old  Court-house of Poughkeepsie was by no means a disagreeable  gathering-place. Moreover, it was as picturesque within as it was  arcadian without; for the fine alert-looking men, with their powdered  hair in queues, their elaborately cut clothes of many colours, made for  the most part of the corded silk named ducape, their lawn and ruffles,  made up the details of a charming picture, which was far from appealing  to them, but which gives us a distinct pleasure in the retrospect.    
Governor Clinton was elected the President of the Convention. On the  right of the central table sat his forty-five henchmen, with Melancthon  Smith, one of the most astute and brilliant debaters of the time, well  to the front. Opposite sat Hamilton, surrounded by General Schuyler,  Jay, Duane, and Robert Livingston, the rest of his small following close  to the windows, but very alert, their gaze never ranging far from their  leader. Beyond the bar crowded the invited guests, many of them women in  all the finery of the time.    
If the anti-Federalists had entertained the idea of an immediate and  indefinite adjournment, they appear to have abandoned it without waste  of time; perhaps because long and tedious journeys in midsummer were not  to be played with; perhaps because they were sure of their strength;  possibly because Clinton was so strongly in favour of arranging  Hamilton's destinies once for all.    
Certainly at the outset the prospects of the Federalists were almost  ludicrous. The anti-Federalists were two-thirds against one-third,  fortified against argument, uncompromisingly opposed to union at the  expense of State sovereignty, clever and thinking men, most of them,  devoted to Clinton, and admirably led by an orator who acknowledged no  rival but Hamilton. The latter set his lips more than once, and his  heart sank, but only to leap a moment later with delight in the mere  test of strength.    
Clinton's first move was to attempt a vote at once upon the Constitution  as a whole, but he was beaten by Hamilton and many in his own ranks, who  were in favour of the fair play of free debate. The Governor was forced  to permit the Convention to go into a Committee of the Whole, which  would argue the Constitution section by section. Hamilton had gained a  great point, and he soon revealed the use he purposed to make of it.    
It is doubtful if his own followers had anticipated that he would speak  almost daily for three weeks, receiving and repelling the brunt of every  argument; and certainly Clinton had looked for no such feat.    
The contest opened on the Clintonian side, with the argument that an  amended Confederation was all that was necessary for the purposes of a  more general welfare. The plan advanced was that Congress should be  given the power to compel by force the payment of the requisitions which  the States so often ignored. Hamilton demolished this proposition with  one of his most scornful outbursts.    <blockquote>
 Coerce the States! [he cried]. Never was a madder project devised!   Do you imagine that the result of the failure of one State to   comply would be confined to that State alone? Are you so willing to   hazard a civil war? Consider the refusal of Massachusetts, the   attempt at compulsion by Congress. What a series of pictures does   this conjure up? A powerful State procuring immediate assistance   from other States, particularly from some delinquent! A complying   State at war with a non-complying State! Congress marching the   troops of one State into the bosom of another! This State   collecting auxiliaries and forming perhaps a majority against its   Federal head! And can any reasonable man be well disposed toward a   government which makes war and carnage the only means of supporting   itself?--a government that can exist only by the sword? And what   sort of a State would it be which would suffer itself to be used as   the instrument of coercing another? ... A Federal standing army,   then, must enforce the requisitions or the Federal treasury will be   left without supplies, and the government without support.... There   is but one cure for such an evil--to enable the national laws to   operate on individuals like the laws of the States. To take the old   Confederation as the basis of a new system, and to trust the sword   and the purse to a single assembly organized upon principles so   defective, giving it the full powers of taxation and the national   forces, would result in what--Despotism! To avoid the very issue   which appears to be held in such abject terror, a totally different   government from anything into which the old Confederation can be   twisted, or fitted out with wings and gables, must be established   with proper powers and proper checks and balances.</blockquote>    
His words created a palpable uneasiness. The outburst was the more  effective for following and preceding close passionless and pointed  reasoning, a trenchant review of other republics ancient and modern, and  an elaborate argument in favour of the representation prescribed by the  new Constitution.    
Hamilton was not only the most brilliant, resourceful, and unanswerable  orator of his time, but he was gifted with an almost diabolical power  over the emotions of men, which he did not hesitate to use. At this  momentous assembly he kept them in exercise; when he chose, he made his  audience weep; and the Clintonians weakened daily. Had not many years of  trouble and anxiety made their emotions peculiarly susceptible, Hamilton  would have attempted their agitation more sparingly; and had he been  theatrical and rhetorical in his methods, he would have lost his control  of them long before the end of the session. But he rarely indulged in a  trope or a flight, never in bathos nor in bursts of ill-balanced appeal.  Nothing ever was drier than the subjects he elucidated day after day for  three weeks: for he took the Constitution to pieces bit by bit, and  compelled them to listen to an analysis which, if propounded by another,  would have bored them to distraction, vitally interested as they were.  But he not only so illuminated the cold pages of the Constitution that  while they listened they were willing to swear it was more beautiful  than the Bible, but the torrent of his eloquence, never confusing, so  sharp was every feature of the Constitution to his own mind, the magic  of his personality, and his intense humanity in treating the driest  sections of the document, so bewitched his audience that, even when he  talked for six hours without pausing on the subject of taxation, perhaps  the baldest topic which the human understanding is obliged to consider,  there was not a sign of impatience in the ranks of the enemy.    
He by no means harrowed them daily; he was far too astute for that.  There were days together when he merely charmed them, and they sat with  a warm unconscious smile while he demolished bit by bit one of  Melancthon Smith's clever arguments, in a manner so courteous that even  his victim could only shrug his shoulders, although he cursed him  roundly afterward. Then, when his audience least expected an assault, he  would treat them to a burst of scorn that made them hitch their chairs  and glance uneasily at each other, or to a picture of future misery  which reduced them to pulp.    
Clinton was infuriated. Even he often leaned forward, forgetting his own  selfish ambitions when Hamilton's thrilling voice poured forth a rapid  appeal to the passions of his hearers; but he quickly resumed the  perpendicular, and set his lips to imprison a scarlet comment. He saw  that his men were weakening, and as much to the luminous expounding of  the Constitution, to the logic of the orator, as to a truly satanic  eloquence and charm. He held long private sessions at his mansion on the  turnpike, where he was assisted by much material argument. But even  Melancthon Smith, who distinguished himself in almost daily debate,  acknowledged more than once that Hamilton had convinced him; and others  asserted, with depression, that their minds, which they had supposed to  be their own,--or Clinton's,--seemed to be in a process of remaking.    
After all, for the most part, they were sincere and earnest; and  although it is difficult for us of the present day to comprehend that  enlightened men ever could have been so mad as to believe that the  country would prosper without union, that a mere State should have been  thought to be of greater importance than a Nation, or that a democratic  constitution, which permits us to coddle anarchists in our midst, and  the lower orders to menace the liberties of the upper, was ever an  object of terror to men of bitter republican ideals, yet the historic  facts confront us, and we wonder, when reading the astonishing  arguments of that long and hard-fought contest, if Hamilton's  constitution, had it passed the Great Convention, would not have  ratified with a no more determined opposition.    
Melancthon Smith was one of the brightest and most conspicuous men of  his time, but his name is forgotten to-day. He was sincere; he was, in  his way, patriotic; he was a clever and eloquent orator. Moreover, he  was generous and manly enough to admit himself beaten, as the sequel  will show. To insure greatness, must the gift of long foreknowledge be  added to brilliant parts and an honest character? If this be the  essential, no wonder Melancthon Smith is forgotten. We have him  asserting that in a country where a portion of the people live more than  twelve hundred miles from the centre, one body cannot legislate for the  whole. He apprehends the abolition of the State constitutions by a  species of under-mining, predicts their immediate dwindling into  insignificance before the comprehensive and dangerous power vested in  Congress. He believes that all rich men are vicious and intemperate, and  sees nothing but despotism and disaster in the Federal Constitution.    
But, like most of the speakers of that day, he was trenchant and  unadorned, so that his speeches are as easy reading as they must have  been agreeable to hear. It is a curious fact that the best speakers of  to-day resemble our forefathers in this respect of trenchant simplicity.  Mediocrity for half a century has ranted on the stump, and given  foreigners a false impression of American oratory. Those who indulge in  what may be called the open-air metaphor, so intoxicating is our  climate, may find consolation in this flight of Mr. Gilbert Livingston,  who had not their excuse; for the Court-house of Poughkeepsie was hot  and crowded. He is declaiming against the senatorial aristocrats lurking  in the proposed Constitution. "What," he cries, "what will be their  situation in a Federal town? Hallowed ground! Nothing so unclean as  State laws to enter there, surrounded as they will be by an impenetrable  wall of adamant and gold, the wealth of the whole country flowing into  it!" "<i>What</i>? What WALL?" cried a Federal. "A wall of gold, of adamant,  which will flow in from all parts of the continent." The joyous roar of  our ancestors comes down to us.    
Hamilton's speech, in which he as effectually disposed of every argument  against the Senate as Roger Sherman had done in the Great Convention, is  too long to be quoted; but it is as well to give the precise words in  which he defines the vital difference between republics and democracies.    <blockquote>
 It has been observed by an honourable gentleman [he said] that a   pure democracy, if it were practicable, would be the most perfect   government. Experience has proved that no position in politics is   more false than this. The ancient democracies, in which the people   themselves deliberated, never possessed one feature of good   government. Their very character was tyranny; their figure   deformity. When they assembled, the field of debate presented an   ungovernable mob, not only incapable of deliberation, but prepared   for every enormity. In these assemblies the enemies of the people   brought forward their plans of ambition systematically. They were   opposed by their enemies of another party; and it became a matter   of contingency, whether the people subjected themselves to be led   blindly by one tyrant or another.</blockquote>    
Again he says, in reply to Melancthon Smith:--    <blockquote>
 It is a harsh doctrine that men grow wicked as they improve and   enlighten their minds. Experience has by no means justified us in   the supposition that there is more virtue in one class of men than   in another. Look through the rich and the poor of this community,   the learned and the ignorant--Where does virtue predominate? The   difference indeed consists not in the quantity, but kind of vices   which are incident to various classes; and here the advantage of   character belongs to the wealthy. Their vices are probably more   favourable to the prosperity of the State than those of the   indigent; and partake less of moral depravity.</blockquote>    
More than once Hamilton left his seat and went up to the belfry to  strain his eyes down the Albany post road or over the Dutchess turnpike,  and every afternoon he rode for miles to the east or the south, hoping  to meet an express messenger with a letter from Madison, or with the  good tidings that New Hampshire had ratified. Madison wrote every few  days, sometimes hopefully, sometimes in gloom, especially if he were not  feeling well. Each letter was from ten to twelve days old, and it seemed  to Hamilton sometimes that he should burst with impatience and anxiety.  On the 24th of June, as he was standing in the belfry while Chancellor  Livingston rained his sarcasms, he thought he saw an object moving  rapidly down the white ribbon which cut the forest from the East. In  five minutes he was on his horse and the Dutchess turnpike. The object  proved to be the messenger from Rufus King, and the letter which  Hamilton opened then and there contained the news of the adoption of the  Constitution by New Hampshire.    
There was now a Nation, and nine States would be governed by the new  laws, whether New York, Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island  sulked unprotected in the out-skirts, or gracefully entered the league  before dragged in or driven. It was a glittering and two-edged weapon  for Hamilton, and he flashed it in the faces of the anti-Federalists  until they were well-nigh blinded. Nevertheless, he did not for a moment  underrate Clinton's great strength, and he longed desperately for good  news from Virginia, believing that the entrance of that important State  into the Union would have more influence upon the opposition than all  the arts of which he was master.
