Rosalind Wescott, a tall strong looking woman of twenty-seven, was  walking on the railroad track near the town of Willow Springs, Iowa. It  was about four in the afternoon of a day in August, and the third day  since she had come home to her native town from Chicago, where she was  employed.    
At that time Willow Springs was a town of about three thousand people.  It has grown since. There was a public square with the town hall in the  centre and about the four sides of the square and facing it were the  merchandising establishments. The public square was bare and grassless,  and out of it ran streets of frame houses, long straight streets that  finally became country roads running away into the flat prairie  country.    
Although she had told everyone that she had merely come home for a  short visit because she was a little homesick, and although she wanted  in particular to have a talk with her mother in regard to a certain  matter, Rosalind had been unable to talk with anyone. Indeed she had  found it difficult to stay in the house with her mother and father and  all the time, day and night, she was haunted by a desire to get out of  town. As she went along the railroad tracks in the hot afternoon  sunshine she kept scolding herself. "I've grown moody and no good. If I  want to do it why don't I just go ahead and not make a fuss," she  thought.    
For two miles the railroad tracks, eastward out of Willow Springs, went  through corn fields on a flat plain. Then there was a little dip in the  land and a bridge over Willow Creek. The Creek was altogether dry now  but trees grew along the edge of the grey streak of cracked mud that in  the fall, winter and spring would be the bed of the stream. Rosalind  left the tracks and went to sit under one of the trees. Her cheeks were  flushed and her forehead wet. When she took off her hat her hair fell  down in disorder and strands of it clung to her hot wet face. She sat  in what seemed a kind of great bowl on the sides of which the corn grew  rank. Before her and following the bed of the stream there was a dusty  path along which cows came at evening from distant pastures. A great  pancake formed of cow dung lay nearby. It was covered with grey dust  and over it crawled shiny black beetles. They were rolling the dung  into balls in preparation for the germination of a new generation of  beetles.    
Rosalind had come on the visit to her home town at a time of the year  when everyone wished to escape from the hot dusty place. No one had  expected her and she had not written to announce her coming. One hot  morning in Chicago she had got out of bed and had suddenly begun  packing her bag, and on that same evening there she was in Willow  Springs, in the house where she had lived until her twenty-first year,  among her own people. She had come up from the station in the hotel bus  and had walked into the Wescott house unannounced. Her father was at  the pump by the kitchen door and her mother came into the living room  to greet her wearing a soiled kitchen apron. Everything in the house  was just as it always had been. "I just thought I would come home for a  few days," she said, putting down her bag and kissing her mother.    
Ma and Pa Wescott had been glad to see their daughter. On the evening  of her arrival they were excited and a special supper was prepared.  After supper Pa Wescott went up town as usual, but he stayed only a few  minutes. "I just want to run to the postoffice and get the evening  paper," he said apologetically. Rosalind's mother put on a clean dress  and they all sat in the darkness on the front porch. There was talk, of  a kind. "Is it hot in Chicago now? I'm going to do a good deal of  canning this fall. I thought later I would send you a box of canned  fruit. Do you live in the same place on the North Side? It must be nice  in the evening to be able to walk down to the park by the lake."    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Rosalind sat under the tree near the railroad bridge two miles from  Willow Springs and watched the tumble bugs at work. Her whole body was  hot from the walk in the sun and the thin dress she wore clung to her  legs. It was being soiled by the dust on the grass under the tree.    
She had run away from town and from her mother's house. All during the  three days of her visit she had been doing that. She did not go from  house to house to visit her old schoolgirl friends, the girls who  unlike herself had stayed in Willow Springs, had got married and  settled down there. When she saw one of these women on the street in  the morning, pushing a baby carriage and perhaps followed by a small  child, she stopped. There was a few minutes of talk. "It's hot. Do you  live in the same place in Chicago? My husband and I hope to take the  children and go away for a week or two. It must be nice in Chicago  where you are so near the lake." Rosalind hurried away.    
All the hours of her visit to her mother and to her home town had been  spent in an effort to hurry away.    
From what? Rosalind defended herself. There was something she had come  from Chicago hoping to be able to say to her mother. Did she really  want to talk with her about things? Had she thought, by again breathing  the air of her home town, to get strength to face life and its  difficulties?    
There was no point in her taking the hot uncomfortable trip from  Chicago only to spend her days walking in dusty country roads or  between rows of cornfields in the stifling heat along the railroad  tracks.    
"I must have hoped. There is a hope that cannot be fulfilled," she  thought vaguely.    
Willow Springs was a rather meaningless, dreary town, one of thousands  of such towns in Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, Iowa, but her  mind made it more dreary.    
She sat under the tree by the dry bed of Willow Creek thinking of the  street in town where her mother and father lived, where she had lived  until she had become a woman. It was only because of a series of  circumstances she did not live there now. Her one brother, ten years  older than herself, had married and moved to Chicago. He had asked her  to come for a visit and after she got to the city she stayed. Her  brother was a traveling salesman and spent a good deal of time away  from home. "Why don't you stay here with Bess and learn stenography,"  he asked. "If you don't want to use it you don't have to. Dad can look  out for you all right. I just thought you might like to learn."    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
"That was six years ago," Rosalind thought wearily. "I've been a city  woman for six years." Her mind hopped about. Thoughts came and went. In  the city, after she became a stenographer, something for a time  awakened her. She wanted to be an actress and went in the evening to a  dramatic school. In an office where she worked there was a young man, a  clerk. They went out together, to the theatre or to walk in the park in  the evening. They kissed.    
Her thoughts came sharply back to her mother and father, to her home in  Willow Springs, to the street in which she had lived until her twenty-  first year.    
It was but an end of a street. From the windows at the front of her  mother's house six other houses could be seen. How well she knew the  street and the people in the houses! Did she know them? From her  eighteenth and until her twenty-first year she had stayed at home,  helping her mother with the housework, waiting for something. Other  young women in town waited just as she did. They like herself had  graduated from the town high school and their parents had no intention  of sending them away to college. There was nothing to do but wait. Some  of the young women--their mothers and their mothers' friends still  spoke of them as girls--had young men friends who came to see them on  Sunday and perhaps also on Wednesday or Thursday evenings. Others  joined the church, went to prayer meetings, became active members of  some church organization. They fussed about.    
Rosalind had done none of these things. All through those three trying  years in Willow Springs she had just waited. In the morning there was  the work to do in the house and then, in some way, the day wore itself  away. In the evening her father went up town and she sat with her  mother. Nothing much was said. After she had gone to bed she lay awake,  strangely nervous, eager for something to happen that never would  happen. The noises of the Wescott house cut across her thoughts. What  things went through her mind!    
There was a procession of people always going away from her. Sometimes  she lay on her belly at the edge of a ravine. Well it was not a ravine.  It had two walls of marble and on the marble face of the walls strange  figures were carved. Broad steps led down--always down and away. People  walked along the steps, between the marble walls, going down and away  from her.    
What people! Who were they? Where did they come from? Where were they  going? She was not asleep but wide awake. Her bedroom was dark. The  walls and ceiling of the room receded. She seemed to hang suspended in  space, above the ravine--the ravine with walls of white marble over  which strange beautiful lights played.    
The people who went down the broad steps and away into infinite  distance--they were men and women. Sometime a young girl like herself  but in some way sweeter and purer than herself, passed alone. The young  girl walked with a swinging stride, going swiftly and freely like a  beautiful young animal. Her legs and arms were like the slender top  branches of trees swaying in a gentle wind. She also went down and  away.    
Others followed along the marble steps. Young boys walked alone. A  dignified old man followed by a sweet faced woman passed. What a  remarkable man! One felt infinite power in his old frame. There were  deep wrinkles in his face and his eyes were sad. One felt he knew  everything about life but had kept something very precious alive in  himself. It was that precious thing that made the eyes of the woman who  followed him burn with a strange fire. They also went down along the  steps and away.    
Down and away along the steps went others--how many others, men and  women, boys and girls, single old men, old women who leaned on sticks  and hobbled along.    
In the bed in her father's house as she lay awake Rosalind's head grew  light. She tried to clutch at something, understand something.    
She couldn't. The noises of the house cut across her waking dream. Her  father was at the pump by the kitchen door. He was pumping a pail of  water. In a moment he would bring it into the house and put it on a box  by the kitchen sink. A little of the water would slop over on the  floor. There would be a sound like a child's bare foot striking the  floor. Then her father would go to wind the clock. The day was done.  Presently there would be the sound of his heavy feet on the floor of  the bedroom above and he would get into bed to lie beside Rosalind's  mother.    
The night noises of her father's house had been in some way terrible to  the girl in the years when she was becoming a woman. After chance had  taken her to the city she never wanted to think of them again. Even in  Chicago where the silence of nights was cut and slashed by a thousand  noises, by automobiles whirling through the streets, by the belated  footsteps of men homeward bound along the cement sidewalks after  midnight, by the shouts of quarreling men drunk on summer nights, even  in the great hubbub of noises there was comparative quiet. The  insistent clanging noises of the city nights were not like the homely  insistent noises of her father's house. Certain terrible truths about  life did not abide in them, they did not cling so closely to life and  did not frighten as did the noises in the one house on the quiet street  in the town of Willow Springs. How often, there in the city, in the  midst of the great noises she had fought to escape the little noises!  Her father's feet were on the steps leading into the kitchen. Now he  was putting the pail of water on the box by the kitchen sink. Upstairs  her mother's body fell heavily into bed. The visions of the great  marble-lined ravine down along which went the beautiful people flew  away. There was the little slap of water on the kitchen floor. It was  like a child's bare foot striking the floor. Rosalind wanted to cry  out. Her father closed the kitchen door. Now he was winding the clock.  In a moment his feet would be on the stairs--    
There were six houses to be seen from the windows of the Wescott house.  In the winter smoke from six brick chimneys went up into the sky. There  was one house, the next one to the Wescott's place, a small frame  affair, in which lived a man who was thirty-five years old when  Rosalind became a woman of twenty-one and went away to the city. The  man was unmarried and his mother, who had been his housekeeper, had  died during the year in which Rosalind graduated from the high school.  After that the man lived alone. He took his dinner and supper at the  hotel, down town on the square, but he got his own breakfast, made his  own bed and swept out his own house. Sometimes he walked slowly along  the street past the Wescott house when Rosalind sat alone on the front  porch. He raised his hat and spoke to her. Their eyes met. He had a  long, hawk-like nose and his hair was long and uncombed.    
Rosalind thought about him sometimes. It bothered her a little that he  sometimes went stealing softly, as though not to disturb her, across  her daytime fancies.    
As she sat that day by the dry creek bed Rosalind thought about the  bachelor, who had now passed the age of forty and who lived on the  street where she had lived during her girlhood. His house was separated  from the Wescott house by a picket fence. Sometimes in the morning he  forgot to pull his blinds and Rosalind, busy with the housework in her  father's house, had seen him walking about in his underwear. It was--  uh, one could not think of it.    
The man's name was Melville Stoner. He had a small income and did not  have to work. On some days he did not leave his house and go to the  hotel for his meals but sat all day in a chair with his nose buried in  a book.    
There was a house on the street occupied by a widow who raised  chickens. Two or three of her hens were what the people who lived on  the street called 'high flyers.' They flew over the fence of the  chicken yard and escaped and almost always they came at once into the  yard of the bachelor. The neighbors laughed about it. It was  significant, they felt. When the hens had come into the yard of the  bachelor, Stoner, the widow with a stick in her hand ran after them.  Melville Stoner came out of his house and stood on a little porch in  front. The widow ran through the front gate waving her arms wildly and  the hens made a great racket and flew over the fence. They ran down the  street toward the widow's house. For a moment she stood by the Stoner  gate. In the summer time when the windows of the Wescott house were  open Rosalind could hear what the man and woman said to each other. In  Willow Springs it was not thought proper for an unmarried woman to  stand talking to an unmarried man near the door of his bachelor  establishment. The widow wanted to observe the conventions. Still she  did linger a moment, her bare arm resting on the gate post. What bright  eager little eyes she had! "If those hens of mine bother you I wish you  would catch them and kill them," she said fiercely. "I am always glad  to see them coming along the road," Melville Stoner replied, bowing.  Rosalind thought he was making fun of the widow. She liked him for  that. "I'd never see you if you did not have to come here after your  hens. Don't let anything happen to them," he said, bowing again.    
For a moment the man and woman lingered looking into each other's eyes.  From one of the windows of the Wescott house Rosalind watched the  woman. Nothing more was said. There was something about the woman she  had not understood--well the widow's senses were being fed. The  developing woman in the house next door had hated her.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Rosalind jumped up from under the tree and climbed up the railroad  embankment. She thanked the gods she had been lifted out of the life of  the town of Willow Springs and that chance had set her down to live in  a city. "Chicago is far from beautiful. People say it is just a big  noisy dirty village and perhaps that's what it is, but there is  something alive there," she thought. In Chicago, or at least during the  last two or three years of her life there, Rosalind felt she had  learned a little something of life. She had read books for one thing,  such books as did not come to Willow Springs, books that Willow Springs  knew nothing about, she had gone to hear the Symphony Orchestra, she  had begun to understand something of the possibility of line and color,  had heard intelligent, understanding men speak of these things. In  Chicago, in the midst of the twisting squirming millions of men and  women there were voices. One occasionally saw men or at least heard of  the existence of men who, like the beautiful old man who had walked  away down the marble stairs in the vision of her girlhood nights, had  kept some precious thing alive in themselves.    
And there was something else--it was the most important thing of all.  For the last two years of her life in Chicago she had spent hours, days  in the presence of a man to whom she could talk. The talks had awakened  her. She felt they had made her a woman, had matured her.    
"I know what these people here in Willow Springs are like and what I  would have been like had I stayed here," she thought. She felt relieved  and almost happy. She had come home at a crisis of her own life hoping  to be able to talk a little with her mother, or if talk proved  impossible hoping to get some sense of sisterhood by being in her  presence. She had thought there was something buried away, deep within  every woman, that at a certain call would run out to other women. Now  she felt that the hope, the dream, the desire she had cherished was  altogether futile. Sitting in the great flat bowl in the midst of the  corn lands two miles from her home town where no breath of air stirred  and seeing the beetles at their work of preparing to propagate a new  generation of beetles, while she thought of the town and its people,  had settled something for her. Her visit to Willow Springs had come to  something after all.    
Rosalind's figure had still much of the spring and swing of youth in  it. Her legs were strong and her shoulders broad. She went swinging  along the railroad track toward town, going westward. The sun had begun  to fall rapidly down the sky. Away over the tops of the corn in one of  the great fields she could see in the distance to where a man was  driving a motor along a dusty road. The wheels of the car kicked up  dust through which the sunlight played. The floating cloud of dust  became a shower of gold that settled down over the fields. "When a  woman most wants what is best and truest in another woman, even in her  own mother, she isn't likely to find it," she thought grimly. "There  are certain things every woman has to find out for herself, there is a  road she must travel alone. It may only lead to some more ugly and  terrible place, but if she doesn't want death to overtake her and live  within her while her body is still alive she must set out on that  road."    
Rosalind walked for a mile along the railroad track and then stopped. A  freight train had gone eastward as she sat under the tree by the creek  bed and now, there beside the tracks, in the grass was the body of a  man. It lay still, the face buried in the deep burned grass. At once  she concluded the man had been struck and killed by the train. The body  had been thrown thus aside. All her thoughts went away and she turned  and started to tiptoe away, stepping carefully along the railroad ties,  making no noise. Then she stopped again. The man in the grass might not  be dead, only hurt, terribly hurt. It would not do to leave him there.  She imagined him mutilated but still struggling for life and herself  trying to help him. She crept back along the ties. The man's legs were  not twisted and beside him lay his hat. It was as though he had put it  there before lying down to sleep, but a man did not sleep with his face  buried in the grass in such a hot uncomfortable place. She drew nearer.  "O, you Mister," she called, "O, you--are you hurt?"    
The man in the grass sat up and looked at her. He laughed. It was  Melville Stoner, the man of whom she had just been thinking and in  thinking of whom she had come to certain settled conclusions regarding  the futility of her visit to Willow Springs. He got to his feet and  picked up his hat. "Well, hello, Miss Rosalind Wescott," he said  heartily. He climbed a small embankment and stood beside her. "I knew  you were at home on a visit but what are you doing out here?" he asked  and then added, "What luck this is! Now I shall have the privilege of  walking home with you. You can hardly refuse to let me walk with you  after shouting at me like that."    
They walked together along the tracks he with his hat in his hand.  Rosalind thought he looked like a gigantic bird, an aged wise old bird,  "perhaps a vulture" she thought. For a time he was silent and then he  began to talk, explaining his lying with his face buried in the grass.  There was a twinkle in his eyes and Rosalind wondered if he was  laughing at her as she had seen him laugh at the widow who owned the  hens.    
He did not come directly to the point and Rosalind thought it strange  that they should walk and talk together. At once his words interested  her. He was so much older than herself and no doubt wiser. How vain she  had been to think herself so much more knowing than all the people of  Willow Springs. Here was this man and he was talking and his talk did  not sound like anything she had ever expected to hear from the lips of  a native of her home town. "I want to explain myself but we'll wait a  little. For years I've been wanting to get at you, to talk with you,  and this is my chance. You've been away now five or six years and have  grown into womanhood.    
"You understand it's nothing specially personal, my wanting to get at  you and understand you a little," he added quickly. "I'm that way about  everyone. Perhaps that's the reason I live alone, why I've never  married or had personal friends. I'm too eager. It isn't comfortable to  others to have me about."    
Rosalind was caught up by this new view point of the man. She wondered.  In the distance along the tracks the houses of the town came into  sight. Melville Stoner tried to walk on one of the iron rails but after  a few steps lost his balance and fell off. His long arms whirled about.  A strange intensity of mood and feeling had come over Rosalind. In one  moment Melville Stoner was like an old man and then he was like a boy.  Being with him made her mind, that had been racing all afternoon, race  faster than ever.    
When he began to talk again he seemed to have forgotten the explanation  he had intended making. "We've lived side by side but we've hardly  spoken to each other," he said. "When I was a young man and you were a  girl I used to sit in the house thinking of you. We've really been  friends. What I mean is we've had the same thoughts."    
He began to speak of life in the city where she had been living,  condemning it. "It's dull and stupid here but in the city you have your  own kind of stupidity too," he declared. "I'm glad I do not live  there."    
In Chicago when she had first gone there to live a thing had sometimes  happened that had startled Rosalind. She knew no one but her brother  and his wife and was sometimes very lonely. When she could no longer  bear the eternal sameness of the talk in her brother's house she went  out to a concert or to the theatre. Once or twice when she had no money  to buy a theatre ticket she grew bold and walked alone in the streets,  going rapidly along without looking to the right or left. As she sat in  the theatre or walked in the street an odd thing sometimes happened.  Someone spoke her name, a call came to her. The thing happened at a  concert and she looked quickly about. All the faces in sight had that  peculiar, half bored, half expectant expression one grows accustomed to  seeing on the faces of people listening to music. In the entire theatre  no one seemed aware of her. On the street or in the park the call had  come when she was utterly alone. It seemed to come out of the air, from  behind a tree in the park.    
And now as she walked on the railroad tracks with Melville Stoner the  call seemed to come from him. He walked along apparently absorbed with  his own thoughts, the thoughts he was trying to find words to express.  His legs were long and he walked with a queer loping gait. The idea of  some great bird, perhaps a sea-bird stranded far inland, stayed in  Rosalind's mind but the call did not come from the bird part of him.  There was something else, another personality hidden away. Rosalind  fancied the call came this time from a young boy, from such another  clear-eyed boy as she had once seen in her waking dreams at night in  her father's house, from one of the boys who walked on the marble  stairway, walked down and away. A thought came that startled her. "The  boy is hidden away in the body of this strange bird-like man," she told  herself. The thought awoke fancies within her. It explained much in the  lives of men and women. An expression, a phrase, remembered from her  childhood when she had gone to Sunday School in Willow Springs, came  back to her mind. "And God spoke to me out of a burning bush." She  almost said the words aloud.    
Melville Stoner loped along, walking on the railroad ties and talking.  He seemed to have forgotten the incident of his lying with his nose  buried in the grass and was explaining his life lived alone in the  house in town. Rosalind tried to put her own thoughts aside and to  listen to his words but did not succeed very well. "I came home here  hoping to get a little closer to life, to get, for a few days, out of  the company of a man so I could think about him. I fancied I could get  what I wanted by being near mother, but that hasn't worked. It would be  strange if I got what I am looking for by this chance meeting with  another man," she thought. Her mind went on recording thoughts. She  heard the spoken words of the man beside her but her own mind went on,  also making words. Something within herself felt suddenly relaxed and  free. Ever since she had got off the train at Willow Springs three days  before there had been a great tenseness. Now it was all gone. She  looked at Melville Stoner who occasionally looked at her. There was  something in his eyes, a kind of laughter--a mocking kind of laughter.  His eyes were grey, of a cold greyness, like the eyes of a bird.    
"It has come into my mind--I have been thinking--well you see you have  not married in the six years since you went to live in the city. It  would be strange and a little amusing if you are like myself, if you  cannot marry or come close to any other person," he was saying.    
Again he spoke of the life he led in his house. "I sometimes sit in my  house all day, even when the weather is fine outside," he said. "You  have no doubt seen me sitting there. Sometimes I forget to eat. I read  books all day, striving to forget myself and then night comes and I  cannot sleep.    
"If I could write or paint or make music, if I cared at all about  expressing what goes on in my mind it would be different. However, I  would not write as others do. I would have but little to say about what  people do. What do they do? In what way does it matter? Well you see  they build cities such as you live in and towns like Willow Springs,  they have built this railroad track on which we are walking, they marry  and raise children, commit murders, steal, do kindly acts. What does it  matter? You see we are walking here in the hot sun. In five minutes  more we will be in town and you will go to your house and I to mine.  You will eat supper with your father and mother. Then your father will  go up town and you and your mother will sit together on the front  porch. There will be little said. Your mother will speak of her  intention to can fruit. Then your father will come home and you will  all go to bed. Your father will pump a pail of water at the pump by the  kitchen door. He will carry it indoors and put it on a box by the  kitchen sink. A little of the water will be spilled. It will make a  soft little slap on the kitchen floor--"    
"Ha!"    
Melville Stoner turned and looked sharply at Rosalind who had grown a  little pale. Her mind raced madly, like an engine out of control. There  was a kind of power in Melville Stoner that frightened her. By the  recital of a few commonplace facts he had suddenly invaded her secret  places. It was almost as though he had come into the bedroom in her  father's house where she lay thinking. He had in fact got into her bed.  He laughed again, an unmirthful laugh. "I'll tell you what, we know  little enough here in America, either in the towns or in the cities,"  he said rapidly. "We are all on the rush. We are all for action. I sit  still and think. If I wanted to write I'd do something. I'd tell what  everyone thought. It would startle people, frighten them a little, eh?  I would tell you what you have been thinking this afternoon while you  walked here on this railroad track with me. I would tell you what your  mother has been thinking at the same time and what she would like to  say to you."    
Rosalind's face had grown chalky white and her hands trembled. They got  off the railroad tracks and into the streets of Willow Springs. A  change came over Melville Stoner. Of a sudden he seemed just a man of  forty, a little embarrassed by the presence of the younger woman, a  little hesitant. "I'm going to the hotel now and I must leave you  here," he said. His feet made a shuffling sound on the sidewalk. "I  intended to tell you why you found me lying out there with my face  buried in the grass," he said. A new quality had come into his voice.  It was the voice of the boy who had called to Rosalind out of the body  of the man as they walked and talked on the tracks. "Sometimes I can't  stand my life here," he said almost fiercely and waved his long arms  about. "I'm alone too much. I grow to hate myself. I have to run out of  town."    
The man did not look at Rosalind but at the ground. His big feet  continued shuffling nervously about. "Once in the winter time I thought  I was going insane," he said. "I happened to remember an orchard, five  miles from town where I had walked one day in the late fall when the  pears were ripe. A notion came into my head. It was bitter cold but I  walked the five miles and went into the orchard. The ground was frozen  and covered with snow but I brushed the snow aside. I pushed my face  into the grass. In the fall when I had walked there the ground was  covered with ripe pears. A fragrance arose from them. They were covered  with bees that crawled over them, drunk, filled with a kind of ecstacy.  I had remembered the fragrance. That's why I went there and put my face  into the frozen grass. The bees were in an ecstasy of life and I had  missed life. I have always missed life. It always goes away from me. I  always imagined people walking away. In the spring this year I walked  on the railroad track out to the bridge over Willow Creek. Violets grew  in the grass. At that time I hardly noticed them but today I  remembered. The violets were like the people who walk away from me. A  mad desire to run after them had taken possession of me. I felt like a  bird flying through space. A conviction that something had escaped me  and that I must pursue it had taken possession of me."    
Melville Stoner stopped talking. His face also had grown white and his  hands also trembled. Rosalind had an almost irresistible desire to put  out her hand and touch his hand. She wanted to shout, crying--"I am  here. I am not dead. I am alive." Instead she stood in silence, staring  at him, as the widow who owned the high flying hens had stared.  Melville Stoner struggled to recover from the ecstasy into which he had  been thrown by his own words. He bowed and smiled. "I hope you are in  the habit of walking on railroad tracks," he said. "I shall in the  future know what to do with my time. When you come to town I shall camp  on the railroad tracks. No doubt, like the violets, you have left your  fragrance out there." Rosalind looked at him. He was laughing at her as  he had laughed when he talked to the widow standing at his gate. She  did not mind. When he had left her she went slowly through the streets.  The phrase that had come into her mind as they walked on the tracks  came back and she said it over and over. "And God spoke to me out of a  burning bush." She kept repeating the phrase until she got back into  the Wescott house.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Rosalind sat on the front porch of the house where her girlhood had  been spent. Her father had not come home for the evening meal. He was a  dealer in coal and lumber and owned a number of unpainted sheds facing  a railroad siding west of town. There was a tiny office with a stove  and a desk in a corner by a window. The desk was piled high with  unanswered letters and with circulars from mining and lumber companies.  Over them had settled a thick layer of coal dust. All day he sat in his  office looking like an animal in a cage, but unlike a caged animal he  was apparently not discontented and did not grow restless. He was the  one coal and lumber dealer in Willow Springs. When people wanted one of  these commodities they had to come to him. There was no other place to  go. He was content. In the morning as soon as he got to his office he  read the Des Moines paper and then if no one came to disturb him he sat  all day, by the stove in winter and by an open window through the long  hot summer days, apparently unaffected by the marching change of  seasons pictured in the fields, without thought, without hope, without  regret that life was becoming an old worn out thing for him.    
In the Wescott house Rosalind's mother had already begun the canning of  which she had several times spoken. She was making gooseberry jam.  Rosalind could hear the pots boiling in the kitchen. Her mother walked  heavily. With the coming of age she was beginning to grow fat.    
The daughter was weary from much thinking. It had been a day of many  emotions. She took off her hat and laid it on the porch beside her.  Melville Stoner's house next door had windows that were like eyes  staring at her, accusing her. "Well now, you see, you have gone too  fast," the house declared. It sneered at her. "You thought you knew  about people. After all you knew nothing." Rosalind held her head in  her hands. It was true she had misunderstood. The man who lived in the  house was no doubt like other people in Willow Springs. He was not, as  she had smartly supposed, a dull citizen of a dreary town, one who knew  nothing of life. Had he not said words that had startled her, torn her  out of herself?    
Rosalind had an experience not uncommon to tired nervous people. Her  mind, weary of thinking, did not stop thinking but went on faster than  ever. A new plane of thought was reached. Her mind was like a flying  machine that leaves the ground and leaps into the air.    
It took hold upon an idea expressed or implied in something Melville  Stoner had said. "In every human being there are two voices, each  striving to make itself heard."    
A new world of thought had opened itself before her. After all human  beings might be understood. It might be possible to understand her  mother and her mother's life, her father, the man she loved, herself.  There was the voice that said words. Words came forth from lips. They  conformed, fell into a certain mold. For the most part the words had no  life of their own. They had come down out of old times and many of them  were no doubt once strong living words, coming out of the depth of  people, out of the bellies of people. The words had escaped out of a  shut-in place. They had once expressed living truth. Then they had gone  on being said, over and over, by the lips of many people, endlessly,  wearily.    
She thought of men and women she had seen together, that she had heard  talking together as they sat in the street cars or in apartments or  walked in a Chicago park. Her brother, the traveling salesman, and his  wife had talked half wearily through the long evenings she had spent  with them in their apartment. It was with them as with the other  people. A thing happened. The lips said certain words but the eyes of  the people said other words. Sometimes the lips expressed affection  while hatred shone out of the eyes. Sometimes it was the other way  about. What a confusion!    
It was clear there was something hidden away within people that could  not get itself expressed except accidentally. One was startled or  alarmed and then the words that fell from the lips became pregnant  words, words that lived.    
The vision that had sometimes visited her in her girlhood as she lay in  bed at night came back. Again she saw the people on the marble  stairway, going down and away, into infinity. Her own mind began to  make words that struggled to get themselves expressed through her lips.  She hungered for someone to whom to say the words and half arose to go  to her mother, to where her mother was making gooseberry jam in the  kitchen, and then sat down again. "They were going down into the hall  of the hidden voices," she whispered to herself. The words excited and  intoxicated her as had the words from the lips of Melville Stoner. She  thought of herself as having quite suddenly grown amazingly,  spiritually, even physically. She felt relaxed, young, wonderfully  strong. She imagined herself as walking, as had the young girl she had  seen in the vision, with swinging arms and shoulders, going down a  marble stairway--down into the hidden places in people, into the hall  of the little voices. "I shall understand after this, what shall I not  understand?" she asked herself.    
Doubt came and she trembled a little. As she walked with him on the  railroad track Melville Stoner had gone down within herself. Her body  was a house, through the door of which he had walked. He had known  about the night noises in her father's house--her father at the well  by the kitchen door, the slap of the spilled water on the floor. Even  when she was a young girl and had thought herself alone in the bed in  the darkness in the room upstairs in the house before which she now  sat, she had not been alone. The strange bird-like man who lived in the  house next door had been with her, in her room, in her bed. Years later  he had remembered the terrible little noises of the house and had known  how they had terrified her.    
There was something terrible in his knowledge too. He had spoken, given  forth his knowledge, but as he did so there was laughter in his eyes,  perhaps a sneer.    
In the Wescott house the sounds of housekeeping went on. A man who had  been at work in a distant field, who had already begun his fall  plowing, was unhitching his horses from the plow. He was far away,  beyond the street's end, in a field that swelled a little out of the  plain. Rosalind stared. The man was hitching the horses to a wagon. She  saw him as through the large end of a telescope. He would drive the  horses away to a distant farmhouse and put them into a barn. Then he  would go into a house where there was a woman at work. Perhaps the  woman like her mother would be making gooseberry jam. He would grunt as  her father did when at evening he came home from the little hot office  by the railroad siding. "Hello," he would say, flatly, indifferently,  stupidly. Life was like that.    
Rosalind became weary of thinking. The man in the distant field had got  into his wagon and was driving away. In a moment there would be nothing  left of him but a thin cloud of dust that floated in the air. In the  house the gooseberry jam had boiled long enough. Her mother was  preparing to put it into glass jars. The operation produced a new  little side current of sounds. She thought again of Melville Stoner.  For years he had been sitting, listening to sounds. There was a kind of  madness in it.    
She had got herself into a half frenzied condition. "I must stop it,"  she told herself. "I am like a stringed instrument on which the strings  have been tightened too much." She put her face into her hands,  wearily.    
And then a thrill ran through her body. There was a reason for Melville  Stoner's being what he had become. There was a locked gateway leading  to the marble stairway that led down and away, into infinity, into the  hall of the little voices and the key to the gateway was love. Warmth  came back into Rosalind's body. "Understanding need not lead to  weariness," she thought. Life might after all be a rich, a triumphant  thing. She would make her visit to Willow Springs count for something  significant in her life. For one thing she would really approach her  mother, she would walk into her mother's life. "It will be my first  trip down the marble stairway," she thought and tears came to her eyes.  In a moment her father would be coming home for the evening meal but  after supper he would go away. The two women would be alone together.  Together they would explore a little into the mystery of life, they  would find sisterhood. The thing she had wanted to talk about with  another understanding woman could be talked about then. There might yet  be a beautiful outcome to her visit to Willow Springs and to her  mother.
