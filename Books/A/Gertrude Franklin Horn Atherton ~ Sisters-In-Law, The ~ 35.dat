Alexina felt only an intolerable ennui. Gora had gone in the morning;  she sat alone in her room. Of course she must have that explanation with  Mortimer, but any time before the first of the month would do. She was far  less concerned with that now than with the problem: what to do with her  life. How was she to continue to live in the same house with him? Perhaps  in far smaller quarters than these? For she could not leave him. She had  no visible excuse, and no desire to admit to the world that she had made  woman's superlative mistake.    
She scowled at the lovely room in which she had expected to find  compensation in dreams, the setting for an unreal and enchanted world.    
Dreams had died out of her. For the first time in her sheltered existence  she appreciated the grim reality of life. She was no longer sheltered,  secluded, one of the "fortunate class." Ways and means would occupy most of  her time henceforth. And it was not the privations she shrank from but  the contacts with the ugly facts of life; a side she had found extremely  picturesque in novels, but knew from, occasional glimpses to be merely  repulsive and demoralizing.    
And of whom could she ask advice! She must make changes and make them  quickly. Four thousand dollars a year!...and taxes--besides the new income  tax--to be paid on the downtown property, the fiats, the land on which her  home stood, Ballinger House itself and all its contents.    
She knew vaguely that many girls these days were given special training of  some sort even where their parents were well off; but more particularly  where the father was what is known as a high-salaried man; or even a  moderately successful professional or business man--all of whose expenses  arid incomes balanced too nicely for investments.    
Not in her set! Joan, bored after her third season with dancing in winter  and "sitting round Alta" in summer, had asked permission to become a  trained nurse like Gora, or go into the decorating business, "any old  thing"; and Maria Abbott had simply stared at her in horror; even her  father had asked her angrily if she wished to disgrace him, advertise him  as unable to provide for his family. No self-respecting American, etc.    
But something must be done. She wished to live on in Ballinger House if  possible, not only because she loved it, or to avoid the commiserations  of the world; she had no desire to live in narrow quarters with her  husband....And she knew nothing, was fit for nothing, belonged to a silly  class that still looked upon women workers as de-classed, although to be  sure two or three whose husbands had left them penniless had gone into  business and were loyally tolerated, if deeply deplored.    
The day after her return from Europe Alice Thorndyke had come into this  room and thrown herself down on the couch, her long, languorous body  looking as if set on steel springs, her angelic blonde beauty distorted  with fury and disgust, and poured out her hatred of men and all their ways,  her loathing for society and gambling and all the stupid vicious round of  the life both public and secret she had elected to lead....She had had  enough of it....After all, she had some brains and she wanted to use them.  She wanted to go into the decorating business. There was an opening. She  had a natural flair for that sort of thing. See what she had managed to do  with that old ark she had inherited, and on five cents a year....When she  had asked her sister to advance the money Sibyl had flown into one of her  worst rages and thrown a gold hair brush through a Venetian mirror. Didn't  she give her clothes by the dozen that she hadn't worn a month? Did any  girl have a better time in society? Was any girl luckier at poker? Was any  girl more popular with men--too bad it was generally the married ones that  lost their heads....Better if she stopped fooling and married. By and by it  would be too late.    
But she didn't want to marry. She was sick of men. She wanted to get out of  her old life altogether and cultivate a side of her mind and character  that had stagnated so far...also to enjoy the independent life of  a money-earner...life in an entirely different world...something  new...new...new.    
Alexina had offered to lend her the capital, for Alice had a hard cool  head. But she had refused, saying she could mortgage her old barrack if  it came to that...but she didn't know...it would he a break....Sib might  never speak to her again...people were such snobs...and she mightn't like  it...she wished she had been born of poor but honest parents and put to  work in a canning factory or married the plumber.    
She had done nothing, and Alexina wondered if she would have the courage to  go into some sort of business with herself...they could give out they  were bored, seeking a new distraction...save the precious pride of their  families.    
She leaned forward and took her head in her hands. If she only had some one  to talk things over with. It was impossible to confide in Gora, in any  one. If she broached the subject to Tom Abbott, to Judge Lawton, even in a  roundabout way, they would suspect at once. Aileen and Janet and the other  girls did not know enough. They would suspect also. But her head would  burst if she didn't consult some one. She was too horribly alone. And  after all she was still very young. She had talked largely of her  responsibilities, but as a matter of fact until now she had never had one  worth the name.    
Suddenly she thought of James Kirkpatrick.    
<b>II</b>    
The lessons in socialism had died a natural death long since. But Alexina  and Aileen and Janet had never quite let him go. Whenever there was a great  strike on, either in California or in any part of the nation, they invited  him to take tea with them at least once a week while it lasted and tell  them all the "ins." This he was nothing loath to do, and waived the  question of remuneration aside with a gesture. He was now a foreman, and  vice-president of his union, and it gave him a distinct satisfaction to  confer a favor upon these "lofty dames," whom, however, he liked better as  time went on. Alexina he had always worshiped and the only time he ceased  to be a socialist was when he ground his teeth and cursed fate for not  making him a gentleman and giving him a chance before she was corralled by  that sawdust dude.    
He had also remained on friendly terms with Gora, who had cold-bloodedly  studied him and made him the hero of a grim strike story. But as he never  read polite literature their friendship was unimpaired.    
<b>II</b>    
He came to tea that afternoon in response to a telephone call from Alexina.  She had put on a tea gown of periwinkle blue chiffon and a silver fillet  about her head, and looked to Mr. Kirkpatrick's despairing gaze as she  intended to look--beautiful, of course, but less woman than goddess.  Exquisite but not tempting. She was quite aware of the young workman's  hopeless passion and she managed him as skillfully as she did the more  assured, sophisticated, and sometimes "illuminated" Jimmie Thorne and  Bascom Luning.    
She received him in the great drawing-room behind the tea-table, laden with  the massive silver of dead and gone Ballingers.    
"I've only been home a week," she said gayly. "See what a good friend I am.  I've scarcely seen any one. Did you get my post cards?"    
"I did and I've framed them, if you don't mind my saying so."    
"I hoped you would. I picked out the prettiest I could find. They do have  such beauties in Europe. Just think, it was my first visit. I was wildly  excited. Wouldn't you like to go?"    
"Naw. America's good enough for me. 'Fris--oh, Lord! San Francisco--for  that matter. I'd like to go to the next International Socialist Congress  all right--next year. Maybe I will. I guess that would give me enough of  Europe to last me the rest of my natural life."    
"I met a good many Frenchmen, and I have a friend married to a very clever  one. He says they expect a war with Germany in a year two--"    
"There'll never be another war. Not in Europe or anywhere else. The  socialists won't permit it."    
"There are a good many socialists--and syndicalists--in France, and it's  quite true they're doing all they can to prevent any money being voted  for the army or expended if it is voted; but I happen to know that the  Government has asked the president of the Red Cross to train as many nurses  as she can induce to volunteer, and as quickly as possible. My friend  Madame Morsigny was to begin her training a few days after I left."    
"Hm. So. I hadn't heard a word of it."    
"We get so much European news out here! America first! Especially in the  matter of murders and hold-ups. Who cares for a possible war in Europe when  the headlines are as black as the local crimes they announce?"    
"Sure thing. Great little old papers. But don't let any talk of war from  anywhere at all worry you. And I'll tell you why. At the last International  Congress all the socialists of all the nations were ready to agree that all  labor should lay down its tools--quit work--go on a colossal strike--the  moment those blood-sucking capitalists at the top, those sawdust kings and  kaisers and tsars--or any president for that matter--declared war for any  cause whatsoever. All, that is, but the German delegates. They couldn't see  the light. Now they have. When we meet next August the resolution will  be unanimous. Take it from me. You've read of your last war in some old  history book. Peace from now on, and thank the socialists."    
"I should. But suppose Germany should declare war before next August?"    
"She won't. She ain't ready. She'd have done it after that there 'Agadir  Incident' if she'd dared. That is to say been good and ready. Now she's got  to wait for another good excuse and there ain't one in sight."    
"But you believe she'd like to precipitate a war in Europe for her own  purposes?"    
"She'd like it all right." And he quoted freely from Treitschke and  Bernhardi, while Alexina as ever looked at him in wonder. He seemed to be  more deeply read every time she met him, and he remained exactly the same  James Kirkpatrick. "What an adventitious thing breeding was! Mortimer had  it!"    
"Well, I am glad I spoke of it. You have relieved my mind, for you speak  as one with authority....There is something else I want to talk to you  about....A friend of mine is in a dilemma and I don't quite know how to  advise her....We're all such a silly set of moths--"    
"No moth about you!" interrupted Mr. Kirkpatrick firmly. "Some of  them--those others, if you like. The only redeeming virtue I can see in  most of them is that they are what they are and don't give a damn. But  you--you've got more brains and common sense than the whole bunch of women  in this town put together."    
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I'm afraid I've addled my brains trying to cultivate  them, and what I'm more afraid of is that I've addled my common sense." She  spoke with such gayety, with such a roguish twinkle, and curve of lip, that  neither then nor later did he suspect that she was the heroine of her own  tale.    
"Well, fire away. No, thanks, no more. I only drink tea to please you  anyway. Tea is so much hot water to me."    
"Well, smoke." She pushed the box of cigarettes toward him. "I know you  smoke a pipe, but I won't let my husband smoke one at home. It's bad for my  curtains....This is it--One of my friends, poor thing, has had a terrible  experience: discovered that her husband has stolen the part of her little  fortune whose income enabled them to do something more than keep alive. You  see, it's a sad case. She believed in him, and he had always been the most  honest creature in the world; and that's as much of a blow as the loss of  the money."    
"What'd he do it for?"    
"Oh, I know so little about business...he wanted to get rich too quickly I  suppose...speculated or something...perhaps got into a hole. This has been  a bad year."    
"Poor chap!" said Kirkpatriek reflectively.    
"You're not commiserating <i>him</i>?"    
"Ain't I, just? He done it, didn't he? He's got to pay the piper, hasn't  he? Women don't know anything about the awful struggles and temptations of  the rotten business world. He didn't do it because he wanted to, you can  bet your life on that. He's just another poor victim of a vicious system.  A fly in the same old web; same old fat spider in the middle!. Not capital  enough. Hard times and the little man goes under, no matter if he's a darn  sight better fellow than the bloated beast on top--"    
"You mean if we were living in the Socialistic Utopia no man could go  under?"    
"I mean just that. It's a sin and a shame, A fine young fellow--"    
"Remember, you don't know anything about him. He's not a bad sort and has  always been quite honest before; but he's not very clever. If he were he  wouldn't have got himself into a predicament. He had a good start, far  better than nine-tenths of the millionaires in this country had in their  youth."    
"Oh, I don't care anything about that. If all men were equally clever in  chasing the almighty dollar there'd be no excuse for socialism. It's our  job to displace the present rotten system of government with one in which  the weak couldn't be crowded out, where all that are willing to work will  have an equal chance--and those that ain't willing will have to work anyhow  or starve....One of the thousand things the matter with the present system  is that the square man is so often in the round hole. In the socialized  state every man will he guided to the place which exactly fits his  abilities. No weaker to the wall there,"    
"You think you can defy Nature to that extent!"    
"You bet."    
"Well. I'm too much distracted by my friend's predicament to discuss  socialism....I rather like the idea though of the strong man having the  opportunity to prove himself stronger than Life...find out what, he was put  on earth and endowed with certain characteristics for...rather a pity all  that should atrophy....However--what shall my friend do? Continue to live  with a man she despises?"    
"She's no right to despise him or anybody. It's the system, I tell you. And  no doubt she's just as weak in some way herself. Every man jack of us is so  chuck full of faults and potential crime it's a wonder we don't break out  every day in the week, and if women are going to desert us when the  old Adam runs head on into some one of the devilish traps the present  civilization has set out all over the place, instead of being able to  sidestep it once more, well--she'd best divorce herself from the idea  of matrimony before she goes in for the thing itself. Would I desert my  brother if he got into trouble? Would you?"    
"N--o, I suppose you are right, and I doubt if she would leave him anyway.  However...there's the other aspect. What can a woman in her position do to  help matters out? You have met a good many of her kind here. Fancy Miss  Lawton or Mrs. Bascom or Miss Maynard forced to work--"    
"I can't. If I had imagination enough for that I'd be writin' novels like  Miss Dwight."    
"I believe they'd do better than you think. Well, this friend isn't quite  so much absorbed in society and poker and dress. She's more like--well,  there's Mrs. Ruyler, for instance. She was very much like the rest of us,  and now we never see her. She's as devoted to ranching as her husband."    
"There was sound bourgeois French blood there," he said shrewdly. "And she  wasn't brought up like the rest of you. Don't you forget that."    
"Then you think we're hopeless?"    
"No, I don't. Three or four women of your crowd--a little older, that's  all--are doin' first-rate in business, and they were light-headed enough  in their time, I'll warrant. And you, for instance--if you came up against  it--"    
"Yes? What could I do?" cried Alexina gayly. "But alas! you admit you have  no imagination."    
"Don't need any. You'd be good for several things. You could go into  the insurance business like Mrs. Lake, or into real estate like Mrs.  Cole--people like to have a pretty and stylish young lady showin' 'em  round flats. Or you could buy an orchard like the Ruylers--that'd require  capital. If we had the socialistic state you'd be put on one of the  thinking boards, so to speak. That's the point. You've got no training, but  you've got a thinker. You'd soon learn. But I'm not so sure of your  friend. Somehow, you've given me the impression she's just one of these  lady-birds."    
"I'm afraid she is," said Alexina with a sigh. "But you're so good to take  an interest....Suppose you had the socialistic state now--to-morrow, what  would you do with all these--lady-birds?"    
"I'd put 'em in a sanatorium until they got their nerves patched up, and  then I'd turn 'em over to a trainer who'd put them into a normal physical  condition; and then I'd put 'em at hard labor--every last one of 'em."    
"Oh, dear, Mr. Kirkpatrick, would you?"    
"Yes," he said grimly. "It 'ud be their turn."
