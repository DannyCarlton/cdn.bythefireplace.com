   Outside Kent's window was Spring, the glorious Spring of the   Northland, and in spite of the death-grip that was tightening in  his  chest he drank it in deeply and leaned over so that his eyes  traveled  over wide spaces of the world that had been his only a  short time  before. 
  It occurred to him that he had suggested this knoll that   overlooked both settlement and river as the site for the building   which Dr. Cardigan called his hospital. It was a structure rough  and  unadorned, unpainted, and sweetly smelling with the aroma of  the  spruce trees from the heart of which its unplaned lumber was  cut. The  breath of it was a thing to bring cheer and hope. Its  silvery walls,  in places golden and brown with pitch and freckled  with knots, spoke  joyously of life that would not die, and the  woodpeckers came and  hammered on it as though it were still a part  of the forest, and red  squirrels chattered on the roof and  scampered about in play with a  soft patter of feet. 
  &quot;It's a pretty poor specimen of man that would die up here with   all that under his eyes,&quot; Kent had said a year before, when he and   Cardigan had picked out the site. &quot;If he died looking at that,  why,  he just simply ought to die, Cardigan,&quot; he had laughed. 
  And now he was that poor specimen, looking out on the glory of the   world! 
  His vision took in the South and a part of the East and West, and   in all those directions there was no end of the forest. It was  like a  vast, many-colored sea with uneven billows rising and  falling until  the blue sky came down to meet them many miles away.  More than once  his heart ached at the thought of the two thin ribs  of steel creeping  up foot by foot and mile by mile from Edmonton,  a hundred and fifty  miles away. It was, to him, a desecration, a  crime against Nature, the  murder of his beloved wilderness. For in  his soul that wilderness had  grown to be more than a thing of  spruce and cedar and balsam, of  poplar and birch; more than a  great, unused world of river and lake  and swamp. It was an  individual, a thing. His love for it was greater  than his love for  man. It was his inarticulate God. It held him as no  religion in  the world could have held him, and deeper and deeper it  had drawn  him into the soul of itself, delivering up to him one by one  its  guarded secrets and its mysteries, opening for him page by page   the book that was the greatest of all books. And it was the wonder  of  it now, the fact that it was near him, about him, embracing  him,  glowing for him in the sunshine, whispering to him in the  soft breath  of the air, nodding and talking to him from the crest  of every ridge,  that gave to him a strange happiness even in these  hours when he knew  that he was dying. 
  And then his eyes fell nearer to the settlement which nestled   along the edge of the shining river a quarter of a mile away.  That,  too, had been the wilderness, in the days before the  railroad came.  The poison of speculation was stirring, but it had  not yet destroyed.  Athabasca Landing was still the door that  opened and closed on the  great North. Its buildings were scattered  and few, and built of logs  and rough lumber. Even now he could  hear the drowsy hum of the distant  sawmill that was lazily turning  out its grist. Not far away the  wind-worn flag of the British  Empire was floating over a Hudson Bay  Company's post that had  bartered in the trades of the North for more  than a hundred years.  Through that hundred years Athabasca Landing had  pulsed with the  heart-beats of strong men bred to the wilderness.  Through it,  working its way by river and dog sledge from the South,  had gone  the precious freight for which the farther North gave in  exchange  its still more precious furs. And today, as Kent looked down  upon  it, he saw that same activity as it had existed through the years   of a century. A brigade of scows, laden to their gunwales, was  just  sweeping out into the river and into its current. Kent had  watched the  loading of them; now he saw them drifting lazily out  from the shore,  their long sweeps glinting in the sun, their crews  singing wildly and  fiercely their beloved Chanson des Voyageurs as  their faces turned to  the adventure of the North. 
  In Kent's throat rose a thing which he tried to choke back, but   which broke from his lips in a low cry, almost a sob. He heard the   distant singing, wild and free as the forests themselves, and he   wanted to lean out of his window and shout a last good-by. For the   brigade&#8212;a Company brigade, the brigade that had chanted its songs  up  and down the water reaches of the land for more than two  hundred and  fifty years&#8212;was starting north. And he knew where it  was  going&#8212;north, and still farther north; a hundred miles, five  hundred,  a thousand&#8212;and then another thousand before the last of  the scows  unburdened itself of its precious freight. For the lean  and  brown-visaged men who went with them there would be many  months of  clean living and joyous thrill under the open skies.  Overwhelmed by  the yearning that swept over him, Kent leaned back  against his pillows  and covered his eyes. 
  In those moments his brain painted for him swiftly and vividly the   things he was losing. Tomorrow or next day he would be dead, and  the  river brigade would still be sweeping on&#8212;on into the Grand  Rapids of  the Athabasca, fighting the Death Chute, hazarding  valiantly the rocks  and rapids of the Grand Cascade, the  whirlpools of the Devil's Mouth,  the thundering roar and boiling  dragon teeth of the Black Run&#8212;on to  the end of the Athabasca, to  the Slave, and into the Mackenzie, until  the last rock-blunted  nose of the outfit drank the tide-water of the  Arctic Ocean. And  he, James Kent, would be DEAD! 
  He uncovered his eyes, and there was a wan smile on his lips as he   looked forth once more. There were sixteen scows in the brigade,  and  the biggest, he knew, was captained by Pierre Rossand. He  could fancy  Pierre's big red throat swelling in mighty song, for  Pierre's wife was  waiting for him a thousand miles away. The scows  were caught steadily  now in the grip of the river, and it seemed  to Kent, as he watched  them go, that they were the last fugitives  fleeing from the  encroaching monsters of steel. Unconscious of the  act, he reached out  his arms, and his soul cried out its farewell,  even though his lips  were silent. 
  He was glad when they were gone and when the voices of the   chanting oarsmen were lost in the distance. Again he listened to  the  lazy hum of the sawmill, and over his head he heard the  velvety run of  a red squirrel and then its reckless chattering.  The forests came back  to him. Across his cot fell a patch of  golden sunlight. A stronger  breath of air came laden with the  perfume of balsam and cedar through  his window, and when the door  opened and Cardigan entered, he found  the old Kent facing him. 
  There was no change in Cardigan's voice or manner as he greeted   him. But there was a tenseness in his face which he could not   conceal. He had brought in Kent's pipe and tobacco. These he laid  on  a table until he had placed his head close to Kent's hearty  listening  to what he called the bruit&#8212;the rushing of blood  through the  aneurismal sac. 
  &quot;Seems to me that I can hear it myself now and then,&quot; said Kent.   &quot;Worse, isn't it?&quot; 
  Cardigan nodded. &quot;Smoking may hurry it up a bit,&quot; he said. &quot;Still,   if you want to&#8212;&quot; 
  Kent held out his hand for the pipe and tobacco. &quot;It's worth it.   Thanks, old man.&quot; 
  Kent loaded the pipe, and Cardigan lighted a match. For the first   time in two weeks a cloud of smoke issued from between Kent's  lips. 
  &quot;The brigade is starting north,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Mostly Mackenzie River freight,&quot; replied Cardigan. &quot;A long run.&quot; 
  &quot;The finest in all the North. Three years ago O'Connor and I made   it with the Follette outfit. Remember Follette&#8212;and Ladouceur?  They  both loved the same girl, and being good friends they decided  to  settle the matter by a swim through the Death Chute. The man  who came  through first was to have her. Gawd, Cardigan, what funny  things  happen! Follette came out first, but he was dead. He'd  brained himself  on a rock. And to this day Ladouceur hasn't  married the girl, because  he says Follette beat him; and that  Follette's something-or-other  would haunt him if he didn't play  fair. It's a queer&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped and listened. In the hall was the approaching tread of   unmistakable feet. 
  &quot;O'Connor,&quot; he said. 
  Cardigan went to the door and opened it as O'Connor was about to   knock. When the door closed again, the staff-sergeant was in the  room  alone with Kent. In one of his big hands he clutched a box of  cigars,  and in the other he held a bunch of vividly red fire-  flowers. 
  &quot;Father Layonne shoved these into my hands as I was coming up,&quot; he   explained, dropping them on the table. &quot;And I&#8212;well&#8212;I'm breaking   regulations to come up an' tell you something, Jimmy. I never  called  you a liar in my life, but I'm calling you one now!&quot; 
  He was gripping Kent's hands in the fierce clasp of a friendship   that nothing could kill. Kent winced, but the pain of it was joy.  He  had feared that O'Connor, like Kedsty, must of necessity turn  against  him. Then he noticed something unusual in O'Connor's face  and eyes.  The staff-sergeant was not easily excited, yet he was  visibly  disturbed now. 
  &quot;I don't know what the others saw, when you were making that   confession, Kent. Mebby my eyesight was better because I spent a  year  and a half with you on the trail. You were lying. What's your  game,  old man?&quot; 
  Kent groaned. &quot;Have I got to go all over it again?&quot; he appealed. 
  O'Connor began thumping back and forth over the floor. Kent had   seen him that way sometimes in camp when there were perplexing   problems ahead of them. 
  &quot;You didn't kill John Barkley,&quot; he insisted. &quot;I don't believe you   did, and Inspector Kedsty doesn't believe it&#8212;yet the mighty queer   part of it is&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What?&quot; 
  &quot;That Kedsty is acting on your confession in a big hurry. I don't   believe it's according to Hoyle, as the regulations are written.  But  he's doing it. And I want to know&#8212;it's the biggest thing I  EVER  wanted to know&#8212;did you kill Barkley?&quot; 
  &quot;O'Connor, if you don't believe a dying man's word&#8212;you haven't   much respect for death, have you?&quot; 
  &quot;That's the theory on which the law works, but sometimes it ain't   human. Confound it, man, DID YOU?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  O'Connor sat down and with his finger-nails pried open the box of   cigars. &quot;Mind if I smoke with you?&quot; he asked. &quot;I need it. I'm shot  up  with unexpected things this morning. Do you care if I ask you  about  the girl?&quot; 
  &quot;The girl!&quot; exclaimed Kent. He sat up straighter, staring at   O'Connor. 
  The staff-sergeant's eyes were on him with questioning steadiness.   &quot;I see&#8212;you don't know her,&quot; he said, lighting his cigar. &quot;Neither  do  I. Never saw her before. That's why I am wondering about  Inspector  Kedsty. I tell you, it's queer. He didn't believe you  this morning,  yet he was all shot up. He wanted me to go with him  to his house. The  cords stood out on his neck like that&#8212;like my  little finger. 
  &quot;Then suddenly he changed his mind and said we'd go to the office.   That took us along the road that runs through the poplar grove. It   happened there. I'm not much of a girl's man, Kent, and I'd be a  fool  to try to tell you what she looked like. But there she was,  standing  in the path not ten feet ahead of us, and she stopped me  in my tracks  as quick as though she'd sent a shot into me. And she  stopped Kedsty,  too. I heard him give a sort of grunt&#8212;a funny  sound, as though some  one had hit him. I don't believe I could  tell whether she had a dress  on or not, for I never saw anything  like her face, and her eyes, and  her hair, and I stared at them  like a thunder-struck fool. She didn't  seem to notice me any more  than if I'd been thin air, a ghost she  couldn't see. 
  &quot;She looked straight at Kedsty, and she kept looking at him&#8212;and   then she passed us. Never said a word, mind you. She came so near  I  could have touched her with my hand, and not until she was that  close  did she take her eyes from Kedsty and look at me. And when  she'd  passed I thought what a couple of cursed idiots we were,  standing  there paralyzed, as if we'd never seen a beautiful girl  before in our  lives. I went to remark that much to the Old Man  when&#8212;&quot; 
  O'Connor bit his cigar half in two as he leaned nearer to the cot. 
  &quot;Kent, I swear that Kedsty was as white as chalk when I looked at   him! There wasn't a drop of blood left in his face, and he was   staring straight ahead, as though the girl still stood there, and  he  gave another of those grunts&#8212;it wasn't a laugh&#8212;as if  something was  choking him. And then he said: 
  &quot;'Sergeant, I've forgotten something important. I must go back to   see Dr. Cardigan. You have my authority to give McTrigger his  liberty  at once!'&quot; 
  O'Connor paused, as if expecting some expression of disbelief from   Kent. When none came, he demanded, 
  &quot;Was that according to the Criminal Code? Was it, Kent?&quot; 
  &quot;Not exactly. But, coming from the S.O.D., it was law.&quot; 
  &quot;And I obeyed it,&quot; grunted the staff-sergeant. &quot;And if you could   have seen McTrigger! When I told him he was free, and unlocked his   cell, he came out of it gropingly, like a blind man. And he would  go  no farther than the Inspector's office. He said he would wait  there  for him.&quot; 
  &quot;And Kedsty?&quot; 
  O'Connor jumped from his chair and began thumping back and forth   across the room again. &quot;Followed the girl,&quot; he exploded. &quot;He  couldn't  have done anything else. He lied to me about Cardigan.  There wouldn't  be anything mysterious about it if he wasn't sixty  and she less than  twenty. She was pretty enough! But it wasn't her  beauty that made him  turn white there in the path. Not on your  life it wasn't! I tell you  he aged ten years in as many seconds.  There was something in that  girl's eyes more terrifying to him  than a leveled gun, and after he'd  looked into them, his first  thought was of McTrigger, the man you're  saving from the hangman.  It's queer, Kent. The whole business is  queer. And the queerest of  it all is your confession.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it's all very funny,&quot; agreed Kent. &quot;That's what I've been   telling myself right along, old man. You see, a little thing like  a  bullet changed it all. For if the bullet hadn't got me, I assure  you I  wouldn't have given Kedsty that confession, and an innocent  man would  have been hanged. As it is, Kedsty is shocked,  demoralized. I'm the  first man to soil the honor of the finest  Service on the face of the  earth, and I'm in Kedsty's division.  Quite natural that he should be  upset. And as for the girl&#8212;&quot; 
  He shrugged his shoulders and tried to laugh. &quot;Perhaps she came in   this morning with one of the up-river scows and was merely taking  a  little constitutional,&quot; he suggested. &quot;Didn't you ever notice,   O'Connor, that in a certain light under poplar trees one's face is   sometimes ghastly?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I've noticed it, when the trees are in full leaf, but not   when they're just opening, Jimmy. It was the girl. Her eyes  shattered  every nerve in him. And his first words were an order  for me to free  McTrigger, coupled with the lie that he was coming  back to see  Cardigan. And if you could have seen her eyes when she  turned them on  me! They were blue&#8212;blue as violets&#8212;but shooting  fire. I could  imagine black eyes like that, but not blue ones.  Kedsty simply wilted  in their blaze. And there was a reason&#8212;I  know it&#8212;a reason that sent  his mind like lightning to the man in  the cell!&quot; 
  &quot;Now, that you leave me out of it, the thing begins to get   interesting,&quot; said Kent. &quot;It's a matter of the relationship of  this  blonde girl and&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;She isn't blonde&#8212;and I'm not leaving you out of it,&quot; interrupted   O'Connor. &quot;I never saw anything so black in my life as her hair.  It  was magnificent. If you saw that girl once, you would never  forget her  again as long as you lived. She has never been in  Athabasca Landing  before, or anywhere near here. If she had, we  surely would have heard  about her. She came for a purpose, and I  believe that purpose was  accomplished when Kedsty gave me the  order to free McTrigger.&quot; 
  &quot;That's possible, and probable,&quot; agreed Kent. &quot;I always said you   were the best clue-analyst in the force, Bucky. But I don't see  where  I come in.&quot; 
  O'Connor smiled grimly. &quot;You don't? Well, I may be both blind and   a fool, and perhaps a little excited. But it seemed to me that  from  the moment Inspector Kedsty laid his eyes on that girl he was  a little  too anxious to let McTrigger go and hang you in his  place. A little  too anxious, Kent.&quot; 
  The irony of the thing brought a hard smile to Kent's lips as he   nodded for the cigars. &quot;I'll try one of these on top of the pipe,&quot;  he  said, nipping off the end of the cigar with his teeth. &quot;And you  forget  that I'm not going to hang, Bucky. Cardigan has given me  until  tomorrow night. Perhaps until the next day. Did you see  Rossand's  fleet leaving for up north? It made me think of three  years ago!&quot; 
  O'Connor was gripping his hand again. The coldness of it sent a   chill into the staff-sergeant's heart. He rose and looked through  the  upper part of the window, so that the twitching in his throat  was  hidden from Kent. Then he went to the door. 
  &quot;I'll see you again tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;And if I find out   anything more about the girl, I'll report.&quot; 
  He tried to laugh, but there was a tremble in his voice, a break   in the humor he attempted to force. 
  Kent listened to the tramp of his heavy feet as they went down the   hall.
