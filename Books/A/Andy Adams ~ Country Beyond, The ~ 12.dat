  In Cassidy's canoe, driving himself with steady strokes deeper   into the mystery of the starlit waters of Wollaston, Jolly Roger  felt  the night suddenly filled with an exhilarating tonic. Its  deadness was  gone. Its weight had lifted. A ripple broke the star  gleams where an  increasing breeze touched the surface of the lake.  And the thrill of  adventure stirred in his blood. He laughed as he  put his skill and  strength in the sweep of his paddle, and for a  time the thought that  he was an outlaw, and in losing Nada had  lost everything in life worth  righting for, was not so oppressive.  It was the old, joyous laugh,  stirred by his sense of humor, and  the trick he had played on Cassidy.  He could imagine Cassidy back  on the shore, his temper redder than his  hair as he cursed and  tore up the sand in his search for another  canoe. 
  &quot;We're inseparable,&quot; Jolly Roger explained to Peter. &quot;Wherever I   go, Cassidy is sure to follow. You see, it's this way. A long time   ago someone gave Cassidy what they call an assignment, and in that   assignment it says 'go get Jolly Roger McKay, dead or alive'&#8212;or   something to that effect. And Cassidy has been on the job ever  since.  But he can't quite catch up with me, Pied-Bot. I'm always a  little  ahead.&quot; 
  And yet, even as he laughed, there was in Jolly Roger's heart a   yearning to which he had never given voice. Half a dozen times he   might have killed Cassidy, and an equal number of times Cassidy  might  have killed him. But neither had taken advantage of the  opportunity to  destroy. They had played the long and thrilling  game like men, and  because of the fairness and sportsmanship of  the man who hunted him  Jolly Roger thought of Cassidy as he might  have thought of a brother,  and more than once he yearned to go to  him, and hold out his hand in  friendship. Yet he knew Corporal  Cassidy was the deadliest menace the  earth held for him, a menace  that had followed him like a shadow  through months and years&#8212;  across the Barren Lands, along the rim of  the Arctic, down the  Mackenzie, and back again&#8212;a menace that never  tired, and was  never far behind in that ten thousand miles of  wilderness they had  covered. Together in the bloodstirring game of One  against One  they had faced the deadliest perils of the northland. They  had  gone hungry, and cold, and more than once a thousand miles of   nothingness lay behind them, and death seemed preferable to  anything  that might lie ahead. Yet in that aloneness, when  companionship was  more precious than anything else on earth,  neither had cried quits.  The game had gone on, Cassidy after his  man&#8212;and Jolly Roger McKay  fighting for his freedom. 
  As he headed his canoe north and east, Jolly Roger thought again   of the wager made weeks ago down at Cragg's Ridge, when he had  turned  the tables on Cassidy and when Cassidy had made a solemn  oath to  resign from the service if he failed to get his man in  their next  encounter. He knew Cassidy would keep his word, and  something told him  that tonight the last act in this tragedy of  two had begun. He  chuckled again as he pictured the probable  course of events on shore.  Cassidy, backed by the law, was  demanding another canoe and a  necessary outfit of Slim Buck. Slim  Buck, falling back on his tribal  dignity, was killing all possible  time in making the preparations.  When pursuit was resumed Jolly  Roger would have at least a mile the  start of the red-headed  nemesis who hung to his trail. And Wollaston  Lake, sixty miles  from end to end, and half as wide, offered plenty of  room in which  to find safety. 
  The rising of the wind, which came from the south and west, was   pleasing to Jolly Roger, and he put less caution and more force  into  the sweep of his paddle. For two hours he kept steadily  eastward, and  then swung a little north, guiding himself by the  stars. With the  breaking of dawn he made out the thickly wooded  shore on the opposite  side of the lake from Slim Buck's camp, and  before the sun was half an  hour high he had drawn up his canoe at  the tip of a headland which  gave him a splendid view of the lake  in all directions. 
  From this point, comfortably encamped in the cool shadows of a   thick clump of spruce, Jolly Roger and Peter watched all that day  for  a sign of their enemy. As far as the eye could reach no  movement of  human life appeared on the quiet surface of Wollaston.  Not until that  hazy hour between sunset and dusk did he build a  fire and cook a meal  from the supplies in Cassidy's pack, for he  knew smoke could be  discerned much farther than a canoe. Yet even  as he observed this  caution he was confident there was no longer  any danger in returning  to Yellow Bird and her people. 
  &quot;You see, Pied-Bot,&quot; he said, discussing the matter with Peter,   while he smoked a pipeful of tobacco in the early evening,  &quot;Cassidy  thinks we're on our way north, as fast as we can go.  He'll hit for the  upper end of the Lake and the Black River  waterway, and keep right on  into the Porcupine country. It's a big  country up there, and we've  always taken plenty of space for our  travels. Shall we go back to  Yellow Bird, Peter? And Sun Cloud?&quot; 
  Peter tried to answer, and thumped his tail, but even as he asked   the questions there was a doubt growing in Jolly Roger's mind. He   wanted to go back, and as darkness gathered about him he was urged  by  a great loneliness. Only Yellow Bird grieved with him in his  loss of  Nada, and understood how empty life had become for him.  She had, in a  way, become a part of Nada; her presence raised him  out of despair,  her voice gave him hope, her unconquerable spirit  &#8212;fighting for his  happiness&#8212;inspired him until he saw light where  there had been only  darkness. The impelling desire to return to  her brought him to his  feet and down to the pebbly shore of the  lake, where the water rippled  softly in the thickening gloom. But  a still more powerful force held  him back, and he went to his  blankets, spread over a thick couch of  balsam boughs. For hours  his eyes were wide open and sleepless. 
  He no longer thought of Cassidy, but of Yellow Bird. Doubt&#8212;a   charitable inclination to half believe&#8212;gave way in him to a   conviction which he could not fight down. More than once in his  years  of wilderness life strange facts had compelled him to give  some  credence to the power of the Indian conjurer. Belief in the  mastery of  the mind was part of his faith in nature. It had come  to him from his  mother, who had lived and died in the strength of  her creed. 
  &quot;Think hard, and with faith, if you want anything to come true,&quot;   she had told him. And this was also Yellow Bird's creed. Was it   possible she had told him the truth? Had her mind actually  communed  with the mind of Nada? Had she, through the sheer force  of her  illimitable faith, projected her subconscious self into the  future  that she might show him the way? His eyes were staring, his  ears  unhearing, as he thought of the proof which Yellow Bird had  given to  him. A few hours ago she had brought him warning of  impending danger.  There had been no hesitation and no doubt. She  had come to him  unequivocal and sure. Without seeing, without  hearing, she knew  Cassidy was stealing upon him through the night. 
  In the darkness Jolly Roger sat up, his heart beating fast.   Without effort, and with no thought of the necessity of proof,  Yellow  Bird had given him a test of her power. It had been a  spontaneous and  unstaged thing, a woman's heart reaching out for  him&#8212;as she had  promised that it would. And yet, even as the  simplicity and truth of  it pressed upon him, doubt followed with  its questions. If, after  this, Yellow Bird had told him to return  to Nada as swiftly as he  could, he would have believed, and this  night would have seen him on  his way. But she had warned him  against this, predicting desolation  and grief if he returned. She  had urged him to go on, somewhere,  anywhere, seeking for an  illusion and an unreality which the spirits  had named, to her as  the Country Beyond. And when he reached this  Country Beyond,  wherever it might be, he would possess Nada again, and  happiness  for all time. After all, there was something archaically  crude in  what he was trying to believe, when he came to analyze it.  Yellow  Bird possessed her powers, but they were definitely limited.  And  to believe beyond those limitations, to ride upon the wings of   superstition and imagination, was sheer savagery. 
  Jolly Roger stretched himself upon his blankets again, repeating   this final argument to himself. But as the night drew closer about   him, and his eyes closed, and sleep came, there was a lightness in   his heart which he had not known for many days. He dreamed, and  his  dream was of Nada. He was with her again and it seemed, in  this dream,  that Yellow Bird was always watching them, and they  could not quite  get away from her. They ran through the jackpine  openings where the  strawberries and blue violets grew, and he  always ran behind Nada, so  he could see her brown curls flying  about her. 
  But they never could rid themselves of Yellow Bird, no matter how   fast they ran or where they tried to hide. From somewhere Yellow   Bird's dark eyes would look out at them, and finally, laughing at  his  own discomfiture, he drew Nada down beside him in a little  fen, white  and yellow and blue with wildflowers, and boldly took  her head in his  arms and kissed her&#8212;with Yellow Bird looking at  them from behind a  banksian clump twenty feet away. So real was  the kiss, and so real the  warm pressure of Nada's slim arms about  his neck that he awoke with a  glad cry&#8212;and sat up to find the  dawn had come. 
  For a few moments he sat stupidly, looking about him as if not   quite believing the unreality of it all. Then with Peter he went  down  to the edge of the lake. 
  All that day Peter sensed a quiet change in his master. Jolly   Roger did not talk. He did not whistle or laugh, but moved quietly   when he moved at all, with a set, strange look in his face. He was   making his last big fight against the desire to return to Cragg's   Ridge. Yellow Bird's predictions, and her warning, had no  influence  with him now. He was thinking of Nada alone. She was  back there,  waiting for him, praying for his return, ready and  happy to become a  fugitive with him&#8212;to accept her chances of life  or death, of  happiness or grief, in his company. A dozen times the  determination to  return for her almost won. But each time came the  other picture&#8212;a  vision of ceaseless flight, of hiding, of hunger  and cold and never  ending hardship, and at the last, inevitable as  the dawning of another  day&#8212;prison, and possibly the hangman. 
  Not until late that afternoon did Peter see the old Jolly Roger in   the face of his master. And Jolly Roger said: 
  &quot;We've made up our mind, Pied-Bot. We can't go back. We'll hit   north and spend the winter along the edge of the Barren Lands.  It's  the biggest country I know of, and if Cassidy comes&#8212;&quot; 
  He shrugged his shoulders grimly. 
  In half an hour they had started, with the sun beginning to sink   in the west. 
  For two days Jolly Roger and Peter paddled their way slowly up the   eastern shore of Wollaston. That he had correctly analyzed the  mental  arguments which would guide Cassidy in his pursuit Jolly  Roger had  little doubt. He would keep to the west shore, and up  through the  Hatchet Lake and Black River waterways, as his quarry  had never failed  to hit straight for the farther north in time of  peril. Meanwhile  Jolly Roger had decided to make his way without  haste up the east  shore of Wollaston, and paddle north and east  through the Du Brochet  and Thiewiaza River waterways. If these  courses were followed, each  hour would add to the distance between  them, and when the way was safe  they would head straight for the  Barren Lands. 
  Peter, and only Peter, sensed the glory of that third afternoon   when they paddled slowly ashore close to the shimmering stream of   spring water that was called Limping Moose Creek. The sun was  still  two hours high in the west. There was no wind, and Wollaston  was like  a mirror; yet in the still air was the clean, cool tang  of early  autumn, and shoreward the world reached out in ridges and  billows of  tinted forests, with a September haze pulsing softly  over them, fleecy  as the misty shower of a lady's powder puff. It  was destined to be a  memorable afternoon for Peter, a going down  of the sun that he would  never forget as long as he lived. 
  Yet there was no warning of the thing impending, and his eyes saw   only the mystery and wonder of the big world, and his ears heard  only  the drowsing murmur of it, and his nose caught only the sweet  scents  of cedars and balsams and of flowering and ripening things.  Straight  ahead, beyond the white shore line, was a low ridge, and  this  ridge&#8212;where it was not purple and black with the evergreen&#8212;  was red  with the crimson blotches of mountain-ash berries, and  patches of fire  flowers that glowed like flame in the setting sun. 
  From out of this paradise, as they drew near to it, came softly   the voice and song of birds and the chatter of red squirrels. A  big  jay was screeching over it all, and between the first ridge  and the  second&#8212;which rose still higher beyond it&#8212;a cloud of  crows were  circling excitedly over a mother black bear and her  half grown cubs as  they feasted on the red ash berries. But Peter  could not smell the  bears, nor hear them, and the distant crows  were of less interest than  the wonder and mystery of the shore  close at hand. 
  He turned from his place in the bow of the canoe, and looked at   his master. There was little of inspiration in Jolly Roger's face  or  eyes. The glory of the world ahead gave him no promise, as it  gave  promise to Peter. Beyond what he could see there lay, for  him, a vast  emptiness, a chaos of loneliness, an eternity of  shattered hopes and  broken dreams. Love of life was gone out of  him. He saw no beauty. The  sun had changed. The sky was different.  The bigness of his wilderness  no longer thrilled him, but  oppressed him. 
  Peter sensed sharply the change in his master without knowing the   reason for it. Just as the world had changed for Jolly Roger, so   Jolly Roger had changed for Peter. 
  They landed on a beach of sand, soft as a velvet carpet. Peter   jumped out. A long-legged sandpiper and her mate ran down the  shore  ahead of him. He perked up his angular ears, and then his  nose caught  a fresh scent under his feet where a porcupine had  left his trail. And  he heard more clearly the raucous tumult of  the jay and the musical  chattering of the red squirrels. 
  All these things were satisfactory to Peter. They were life, and   life thrilled him, just as it had thrilled his master a few days  ago.  He adventured a little distance up to the edge of the green  willows  and the young birch and the crimson masses of fire flowers  that  fringed the beginning of the forest. It had rained recently  here, and  the scents were fresh and sweet. 
  He found a wild currant bush, glistening with its juscious black   berries, and began nibbling at them. A gopher, coming to his  supper  bush, gave a little squeak of annoyance, and Peter saw the  bright eyes  of the midget glaring at him from under a big fern  leaf. Peter wagged  his tail, for the savagery of his existence was  qualified by that  mellowing sense of humor which had always been a  part of his master.  He yipped softly, in a companionable sort of  way. 
  And then there smote upon his ears a sound which hardened every   muscle in his body. 
  &quot;Throw up your hands, McKay!&quot; 
  He turned his head. Close to him stood a man. In an instant he had   recognized him. It was the man whose scent he had first discovered   down at Cragg's Ridge, the man from whom his master was always   running away, the man whose voice he had heard again at Yellow  Bird's  Camp a few nights ago&#8212;Corporal Terence Cassidy, of the  Royal  Northwest Mounted Police. 
  Twenty paces away stood McKay. His dunnage was on his back, his   paddle in his hand. And Cassidy, smiling grimly, a dangerous humor  in  his eyes, was leveling an automatic at his breast. It was, in  that  instant, a tableau which no man could ever forget. Cassidy  was  bareheaded, and the sun burned hotly in his red hair. And his  face was  red, and in the pale blue of his Irish eyes was a fierce  joy of  achievement. At last, after months and years, the thrilling  game of  One against One was at an end. Cassidy had made the last  move, and he  was winner. 
  For half a minute after the command to throw up his hands McKay   did not move. And Cassidy did not repeat the command, for he  sensed  the shock that had fallen upon his adversary, and was  charitable  enough to give him time. And then, with something like  a deep sigh  from between his lips, Jolly Roger's body sagged. The  dunnage dropped  from his shoulder to the sand. The paddle slipped  from his hand.  Slowly he raised his arms above his head, and  Cassidy laughed softly. 
  A few days ago McKay would have grinned back, coolly, good   humoredly, appreciative of the other's craftsmanship even in the  hour  of his defeat. But today there was another soul within him. 
  His eyes no longer saw the old Cassidy, brave and loyal to his   duty, a chivalrous enemy, the man he had yearned to love as  brother  loves brother, even in the hours of sharpest pursuit. In  Cassidy he  saw now the hangman himself. The whole world had turned  against him,  and in this hour of his greatest despair and  hopelessness a bitter  fate had turned up Cassidy to deal him the  finishing blow. 
  A swift rage burned in him, even as he raised his hands. It swept   through his brain in a blinding inundation. He did not think of  the  law, or of death, or of freedom. It was the unfairness of the  thing  that filled his soul with the blackness of one last terrible  desire  for vengeance. Cassidy's gun, leveled at his breast, meant  nothing. A  thousand guns leveled at his breast would have meant  nothing. A  choking sound came from his lips, and like a shot his  right hand went  to his revolver holster. 
  In that last second or two Cassidy had foreseen the impending   thing, and with the movement of the other's hand he cried out: 
  &quot;Stop! For God's sake stop&#8212;or I shall fire!&quot; 
  Even into the soul of Peter there came in that moment the   electrical thrill of something terrific about to happen, of  impending  death, of tragedy close at hand. Once, a long time ago,  Peter had felt  another moment such as this&#8212;when he had buried his  fangs in Jed  Hawkins' leg to save Nada. 
  In that fraction of a second which carried Peter through space,   Corporal Cassidy's finger was pressing the trigger of his  automatic,  for McKay's gun was half out of its holster. He was  aiming at the  other's shoulder, somewhere not to kill. 
  The shock of Peter's assault came simultaneously with the   explosion of his gun, and McKay heard the hissing spit of the  bullet  past his ear. His arm darted out. And as Peter buried his  teeth deeper  into Cassidy's leg, he heard a second shot, and knew  that it came from  his master. There was no third. Cassidy drooped,  and something like a  little laugh came from him&#8212;only it was not a  laugh. His body sagged,  and then crumpled down, so that the weight  of him fell upon Peter. 
  For many seconds after that Jolly Roger stood with his gun in his   hand, not a muscle of his body moving, and with something like  stupor  in his staring eyes. Peter struggled out from under  Cassidy, and  looked inquisitively from his master to the man who  lay sprawled out  like a great spider upon the sand. It was then  that life seemed to  come back into Jolly Roger's body. His gun  fell, as if it was the last  thing in the world to count for  anything now, and with a choking cry  he ran to Cassidy and dropped  upon his knees beside him. 
  &quot;Cassidy&#8212;Cassidy&#8212;&quot; he cried. &quot;Good God, I didn't mean to do it!   Cassidy, old pal&#8212;&quot; 
  The agony in his voice stilled the growl in Peter's throat. McKay   saw nothing for a space, as he raised Cassidy's head and  shoulders,  and brushed back the mop of red hair. Everything was a  blur before his  eyes. He had killed Cassidy. He knew it. He had  shot to kill, and not  once in a hundred times did he miss his  mark. At last he was what the  law wanted him to be&#8212;a murderer.  And his victim was Cassidy&#8212;the man  who had played him fairly and  squarely from beginning to end, the man  who had never taken a mean  advantage of him, and who had died there in  the white sand because  he had not shot to kill. With sobbing breath he  cried out his  grief, and then, looking down, he saw the miracle in  Cassidy's  face. The Irishman's eyes were wide open, and there was  pain, and  also a grin, about his mouth. 
  &quot;I'm glad you're sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd hate to have a bad opinion   of you, McKay. But&#8212;you're a rotten shot!&quot; 
  His body sagged heavily, and the grin slowly left his lips, and a   moan came from between them. He struggled and spoke. 
  &quot;It may be&#8212;you'll want help, McKay. If you do&#8212;there's a cabin   half a mile up the creek. Saw the smoke&#8212;heard axe&#8212;I don't blame   you. You're a good sport&#8212;pretty quick&#8212;but&#8212;rotten shot! Oh,   Lord&#8212;such&#8212;rotten&#8212;shot&#8212;&quot; 
  And he tried vainly to grin up into Jolly Roger's face as he   became a lifeless weight in the other's arms. 
  Jolly Roger was sobbing. He was sobbing, in a strange, hard man-   fashion, as he tore open Cassidy's shirt and saw the red wound  that  went clean through Cassidy's right breast just under the  shoulder. And  Peter still heard that strange sound coming from his  lips, a moaning  as if for breath, as his master ran and brought up  water, and worked  over the fallen man. And then he got under  Cassidy, and rose up with  him on his shoulders, and staggered off  with him toward the creek.  There he found a path, a narrow foot  trail, and not once did he stop  with his burden until he came into  a little clearing, out of which  Cassidy had seen the smoke rising.  In this clearing was a cabin, and  from the cabin came an old man  to meet him&#8212;an old man and a girl. 
  At first something shot up into Peter's throat, for he thought it   was Nada who came behind the grizzled and white-headed man. There  was  the same lithe slimness in her body, the same brown glint in  her hair,  and the same&#8212;but he saw then that it was not Nada. She  was older. She  was a bit taller. And her face was white when she  saw the bleeding  burden on Jolly Roger's back. 
  &quot;I shot him,&quot; panted McKay. &quot;God knows I didn't mean to! I'm   afraid&#8212;&quot; 
  He did not finish giving voice to the fear that Cassidy was dead&#8212;   or dying, and for a moment he saw only the big staring eyes of the   girl as the gray-bearded man helped him with his burden. Not until   the Irishman was on a cot in the cabin did he discover how  childishly  weak he had become and what a terrific struggle he had  made with the  weight on his shoulders. He sank into a chair, while  the old trapper  worked over Cassidy. 
  He heard the girl call him grandfather. She was no longer   frightened, and she moved like a swift bird about the cabin,  getting  water and bandages and pillows, and the sight of fresh  blood and of  Cassidy's dead-white face brought a glow of  tenderness into her eyes.  McKay, sitting dumbly, saw that her  hands were doing twice the work  his own could have accomplished,  and not until he heard a low moan  from the wounded man did he come  to her side. 
  &quot;The bullet went through clean as a whistle,&quot; the old man said.   &quot;Lucky you don't use soft nosed bullets, friend.&quot; 
  A deep sigh came from Cassidy's lips. His eyelids fluttered, and   then slowly his eyes opened. The girl was bending over him, and   Cassidy saw only her face, and the brown sheen of her hair. 
  &quot;He'll live?&quot; Jolly Roger said tremulously. 
  The older man remained mute. It was Cassidy, turning his head a   little, who answered weakly. 
  &quot;Don't worry, McKay. I'll&#8212;live.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger bent over the cot, between Cassidy and the girl.   Gently he took one of the wounded man's hands in both his own. 
  &quot;I'm sorry, old man,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You won, fair and square. And   I won't go far away. I'll be waiting for you when you get on your   feet. I promise that. I'll wait.&quot; 
  A wan smile came over Cassidy's lips, and then he moaned again,   and his eyes closed. The girl thrust Jolly Roger back. 
  &quot;No&#8212;you better not go far, an' you better wait,&quot; she said, and   there was an unspoken thing in the dark glow of her eyes that made   him think of Nada on that day when she told him how Jed Hawkins  had  struck her in the cabin at Cragg's Ridge. 
  That night Jolly Roger made his camp close to the mouth of the   Limping Moose. And for three days thereafter his trail led only   between this camp and the cabin of old Robert Baron and his   granddaughter, Giselle. All this time Cassidy was telling things  in a  fever. He talked a great deal about Jolly Roger. And the  girl, nursing  him night and day, with scarcely a wink of sleep  between, came to  believe they had been great comrades, and had  been inseparable for a  long time. Even then she would not let  McKay take her place at  Cassidy's side. The third day she started  him off for a post sixty  miles away to get a fresh supply of  bandages and medicines. 
  It was evening, three days later, when Jolly Roger and Peter   returned. The windows of the cabin were brightly lighted, and  McKay  came up to one of these windows and looked in. Cassidy was  bolstered  up in his cot. He was very much alive, and on the floor  at his side,  sitting on a bear rug, was the girl. A lump rose in  Jolly Roger's  throat. Quietly he placed the bundle which he had  brought from the  post close up against the door, and knocked. When  Giselle opened it he  had disappeared into darkness, with Peter at  his heels. 
  The next morning he found old Robert and said to him: 
  &quot;I'm restless, and I'm going to move a little. I'll be back in two   weeks. Tell Cassidy that, will you?&quot; 
  Ten minutes later he was paddling up the shore of Wollaston, and   for a week thereafter he haunted the creeks and inlets, always on  the  move. Peter saw him growing thinner each day. There was less  and less  of cheer in his voice, seldom a smile on his lips, and  never did his  laugh ring out as of old. Peter tried to understand,  and Jolly Roger  talked to him, but not in the old happy way. 
  &quot;We might have finished him, an' got rid of him for good,&quot; he said   to Peter one chilly night beside their campfire. &quot;But we couldn't,   just like we couldn't have brought Nada up here with us. And we're   going back. I'm going to keep that promise. We're going back,  Peter,  if we hang for it!&quot; 
  And Jolly Roger's jaw would set grimly as he measured the time   between. 
  The tenth day came and he set out for the mouth of the Canoe   River. On the afternoon of the twelfth he paddled slowly into  Limping  Moose Creek. Without any reason he looked at his watch  when he started  for old Robert's cabin. It was four o'clock. He  was two days ahead of  his promise, and there was a bit of  satisfaction in that. There was an  odd thumping at his heart. He  had faith in Cassidy, a belief that the  Irishman would call their  affair a draw, and tell him to take another  chance in the big  open. He was the sort of man to live up to the  letter of a wager,  when it was honestly made. But, if he didn't&#8212; 
  Jolly Roger paused long enough to take the cartridges from his   gun. There would be no more shooting'&#8212;on his part. 
  The mellow autumn sun was flooding the open door of the cabin when   he came up. He heard laughter. It was Giselle. She was talking,  too.  And then he heard a man's voice&#8212;and from far off to his  right came  the chopping of an axe. Old Robert was at work. Giselle  and Cassidy  were at home. 
  He stepped up to the door, coughing to give notice of his   approach. And then, suddenly, he stopped, staring thunderstruck at   what was happening within. 
  Terence Cassidy was sitting in a big chair. The girl was behind   him. Her white arms were around his neck, her face was bent down,  her  lips were kissing him. 
  In an instant Cassidy's eyes had caught him. 
  &quot;Come in,&quot; he cried, so suddenly and so loudly that it startled   the girl. &quot;McKay, come in!&quot; 
  Jolly Roger entered, and the girl stood up straight behind   Cassidy's chair, her cheeks aflame and her eyes filled with the  glow  of the sunset. And Terence Cassidy was grinning in that old  triumphant  way as he leaned forward in his chair, gripping the  arms of it with  both hands. 
  &quot;McKay, you've lost,&quot; he cried. &quot;I'm the winner!&quot; 
  In the same moment he took the girl's hand and drew her from   behind his chair. 
  &quot;Giselle, do as you said you were going to do. Prove to him that   I've won.&quot; 
  Slowly she came to Jolly Roger. Her cheeks were like the red of   the sunset. Her eyes were flaming. Her lips were parted. And  dumbly  he waited, and wondered, until she stood close to him.  Then, swiftly,  her arms were around his neck, and she kissed him.  In an instant she  was back on her knees at the wounded man's side,  her burning face  hidden against him, and Cassidy was laughing, and  holding out both  hands to McKay. 
  &quot;McKay, Roger McKay, I want you to meet Mrs. Terence Cassidy, my   wife,&quot; he said. And the girl raised her face, so that her shining   eyes were on Jolly Roger. 
  Still dumbly he stood where he was. 
  &quot;The Missioner from Du Brochet was here yesterday, and married   us,&quot; he heard Cassidy saying. &quot;And we've written out my  resignation  together, old man. We've both won. I thank God you put  that bullet  into me down on the shore, for it's brought me  paradise. And here's my  hand on it, McKay&#8212;forever and ever!&quot; 
  Half an hour later, when McKay stumbled out into the forest trail   again, his eyes were blinded by tears and his heart choked by a  new  hope as big as the world itself. Yellow Bird was right, and  God must  have been with her that night when her soul went to  commune with  Nada's. For Yellow Bird had proved herself again. And  now he believed  her. 
  He believed in the world again. He believed in love and happiness   and the glory of life, and as he went down the narrow trail to his   canoe, with Peter close behind him, his heart was crying out  Nada's  name and Yellow Bird's promise that sometime&#8212;somewhere&#8212;  they two  would find happiness together, as Giselle and Terence  Cassidy had  found it. 
  And Peter heard the chopping of the distant axe, and the song of   birds, and the chattering of squirrels&#8212;but thrilling his soul  most  of all was the voice of his master, the old voice, the glad  voice, the  voice he had first learned to love at Cragg's Ridge in  the days of  blue violets and red strawberries, when Nada had  filled his world.
