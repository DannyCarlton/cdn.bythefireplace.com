  It seemed an interminable wait to Peter, back in the cabin. Jolly   Roger had put out the light, and when the moon came up the glow of  it  did not come into the dark room where Peter lay, for the open  door was  to the west, and curtains were drawn closely at both  windows. But  through the door he could see the first mellowing of  the night, and  after that the swift coming of a soft, golden  radiance which swallowed  all darkness and filled his world with  the ghostly shadows which  seemed alive, yet never made a sound. It  was a big, splendid moon this  night, and Peter loved the moon,  though he had seen it only a few  times in his three months of  life. It fascinated him more than the  sun, for it was always light  when the sun came, and he had never seen  the sun eat up darkness,  as the moon did. Its mystery awed him, but  did not frighten. He  could not quite understand the strange, still  shadows which were  always unreal when he nosed into them, and it  puzzled him why the  birds did not fly about in the moon glow, and sing  as they did in  the day-time. And something deep in him, many  generations older  than himself, made his blood run faster when this  thing that ate  up darkness came creeping through the sky, and he was  filled with  a yearning to adventure out into the strange glow of it,  quietly  and stealthily, watching and listening for things he had never   seen or heard. 
  In the gloom of the cabin his eyes remained fixed steadily upon   the open door, and for a long time he listened only for the  returning  footsteps of Jolly Roger and Nada. Twice he made efforts  to drag  himself to the edge of the bunk, but the movement sent  such a cutting  pain through him that he did not make a third. And  outside, after a  time, he heard the Night People rousing  themselves. They were very  cautious, these Night People, for  unlike the creatures of the dawn,  waking to greet the sun with  song and happiness, most of them were  sharp-fanged and long-  clawed-rovers and pirates of the great  wilderness, ready to kill.  And this, too, Peter sensed through the  generations of northland  dog that was in him. He heard a wolf howl,  coming faintly through  the night from miles away, and something told  him it was not a  dog. From nearer came the call of a moose, and that  same sense  told him he had heard a monster bear which his eyes had  never  seen. He did not know of the soft-footed, night-eyed creatures  of  prey&#8212;the fox, the lynx, the fisher-cat, the mink and the ermine,   nor of the round-eyed, feathered murderers in the tree-tops&#8212;yet  that  same something told him they were out there among the  shadows, under  the luring glow of the moon. And a thing happened,  all at once, to  stab the truth home to him. A baby snowshoe  rabbit, a third grown,  hopped out into the open close to the cabin  door, and as it nibbled at  the green grass, a gray catapult of  claw and feathers shot out of the  air, and Peter heard the crying  agony of the rabbit as the owl bore it  off into the thick spruce  tops. Even then&#8212;unafraid&#8212;Peter wanted to  go out into the moon  glow! 
  At last, there was an end to his wait. He heard footsteps, and   Jolly Roger came from out of the yellow moon-mist of the night and   stopped in front of the door. There he stood, making no sound, and   looking into the west, where the sky was ablaze with stars over  the  tree-tops. There was a glad little yip in Peter's throat, but  he  choked it back. Jolly Roger was strangely quiet, and Peter  could not  hear Nada, and as he sniffed, and gulped the lump in his  throat, he  seemed to catch the breath of something impending in  the air. Then  Jolly Roger came in, and sat down in darkness near  the table, and for  a long time Peter kept his eyes fixed on the  shadowy blotch of him  there in the gloom, and listened to his  breathing, until he could  stand it no longer, and whined. 
  The sound stirred Jolly Roger. He got up, struck a match&#8212;and then   blew the match out, and came and sat down beside Peter, and  stroked  him with his hand. 
  &quot;Peter,&quot; he said in a low voice, &quot;I guess we've got a job on our   hands. You began it today&#8212;and I've got to finish it. We're goin'  to  kill Jed Hawkins!&quot; 
  Peter snuggled closer. 
  &quot;Mebby I'm bad, and mebby the law ought to have me,&quot; Jolly Roger   went on in the darkness, &quot;but until tonight I never made up my  mind  to kill a man. I'm ready&#8212;now. If Jed Hawkins hurts her again  we're  goin' to kill him! Understand, Pied-Bot?&quot; 
  He got up, and Peter could hear him undressing. Then he made a   nest for Peter on the floor, and stretched himself out in the  bunk;  and after that, for a long time, there seemed to be  something heavier  than the gloom of night in the cabin for Peter,  and he listened and  waited and prayed in his dog way for Nada's  return, and wondered why  it was that she left him so long. And the  Night People held high  carnival under the yellow moon, and there  was flight and terror and  slaughter in the glow of it&#8212;and Jolly  Roger slept, and the wolf  howled nearer, and the creek chortled  its incessant song of running  water, and in the end Peter's eyes  closed, and a red-eyed ermine  peeped over the sill into the man-  and dog-scented stillness of the  outlaw's cabin. 
  For many days after this first night in the cabin, Peter did not   see Nada. There was more rain, and the creek flooded higher, so  that  each time Jolly Roger went over to Cragg's Ridge he took his  life in  his hands in fording the stream. Peter saw no one but  Jolly Roger, and  at the end of the second week he was going about  on his mended leg.  But there would always be a limp in his gait,  and always his right  hind-foot would leave a peculiar mark in the  trail. 
  These two weeks of helplessness were an education in Peter's life   and were destined to leave their mark upon him always. He learned  to  know Jolly Roger, not alone from seeing events, but through an   intuitive instinct that grew swiftly somewhere in his shrewd head.   This instinct, given widest scope in these weeks of helplessness,   developed faster than any other in him, until in the end, he could   judge Jolly Roger's humor by the sound of his approaching  footsteps.  Never was there a waking hour in which he was not  fighting to  comprehend the mystery of the change that had come  over his life. He  knew that Nada was gone, and each day that  passed put her farther away  from him, yet he also sensed the fact  that Jolly Roger went to her,  and when the outlaw returned to the  cabin Peter was filled with a  yearning hope that Nada was  returning with him. 
  But gradually Peter came to think less about Nada, and more about   Jolly Roger, until at last his heart beat with a love for this man   which was greater than all other things in his world. And in these   days Jolly Roger found in Peter's comradeship and growing   understanding a comforting outlet for the things which at times   consumed him. Peter saw it all&#8212;hours when Jolly Roger's voice and   laughter filled the cabin with cheer and happiness, and others  when  his face was set in grim lines, with that hard, far-away look  in his  eyes that Peter could never quite make out. It was at such  times, when  Jolly Roger held a choking grip on the love in his  heart, that he told  Peter things which he had never revealed to a  human soul. 
  In the dusk of one evening, as he sat wet with the fording of the   creek, he said to Peter, 
  &quot;We ought to go, Peter. We ought to pack up&#8212;and go tonight.   Because&#8212;sometimes I'm afraid of myself, Pied-Bot. I'd kill for  her.  I'd die for her. I'd give up the whole world, and live in a  prison  cell&#8212;if I could have her with me. And that's dangerous,  Peter,  because we can't have her. It's impossible, boy. She  doesn't guess why  I'm here. She doesn't know I've been outlawin'  it for years, and that  I'm hiding here because the Police would  never think of looking for  Jolly Roger McKay this close to  civilization. If I told her, she would  think I was worse than Jed  Hawkins, and she wouldn't believe me if I  told her I've outlawed  with my wits instead of a gun, and that I've  never criminally hurt  a person in my life. No, she wouldn't believe  that, Peter. And  she&#8212;she cares for me, Pied-Bot. That's the hell of  it! And she's  got faith in me, and would go with me to the Missioner's  tomorrow.  I know it. I can see it, feel it, and I&#8212;&quot; 
  His fingers tightened in the loose hide of Peter's neck. 
  &quot;Peter,&quot; he whispered in the thickening darkness. &quot;I believe   there's a God, but He's a different sort of God than most people   believe in. He lives in the trees out there, in the flowers, in  the  birds, the sky, in everything&#8212;and I hope that God will strike  me dead  if I do what isn't right with her, Peter! I do. I hope he  strikes me  dead!&quot; 
  And that night Peter knew that Jolly Roger tossed about restlessly   in his bunk, and slept but little 
  But the next morning he was singing, and the warm sun flooding   over the wilderness was not more cheerful than his voice as he  cooked  their breakfast. That, to Peter, was the most puzzling  thing about  this man. With gloom and oppression fastened upon him  he would rise up  suddenly, and start whistling or singing, and  once he said to Peter, 
  &quot;I take my cue from the sun, Peter Clubfoot. It's always shining,   no matter if the clouds are so thick underneath that we can't see  it.  A laugh never hurts a man, unless he's got a frozen lung.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger did not cross the ford that day.
