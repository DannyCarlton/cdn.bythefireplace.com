  For a full minute Philip paced back and forth without speaking.   Then he stopped, and faced Gregson, who was staring at him. 
  &quot;A million, Greggy,&quot; he repeated, in the same soft voice. &quot;A   hundred thousand dollars to my credit&#8212;in a First National Bank!   While I was up here hustling to get affairs on a working basis,  eager  to show the government and the people what we could do and  would do,  triumphing in our victory over the trust, and figuring  each day on my  scheme of making this big, rich north deal a  staggering blow to those  accursed combinations down there, they  were at work, too. While I was  dreaming and doing these things,  Brokaw and the others had formed the  Great Northern Fish and  Development Company, had incorporated it under  the laws of New  Jersey, and had already sold over a million dollars'  worth of  stock! The thing was in full swing when I reached  headquarters. I  had authorized Brokaw to act for me, and I found that  I was vice-  president of one of the biggest legalized robbery  combinations of  recent years. More money had been spent in advertising  than in  development work. Hundreds of thousands of copies of my  letters  from the north, filled to the brim with the enthusiasm I had  felt  for my work and projects, had been sent out broadcast, luring   buyers of stock. In one of these letters I had said that if a half  of  the lakes I had mapped out were fished the north could be made  to  produce a million tons of fish a year. Two hundred thousand  copies of  this letter were sent out, but Brokaw and his associates  had omitted  the words, 'If a half of the lakes mapped out were  fished.' It would  take fifteen thousand men, a thousand  refrigerator cars, and a capital  of five million to bring this  about. I was stunned by the enormity of  their fraud, and yet when  I threatened to bring the whole thing to  smash Brokaw only laughed  and pointed out that not a single caution  had been omitted. In all  of the advertising it was frankly stated that  our license was  provisional, subject to withdrawal if the company did  not keep  within laws. That very frankness was an advertisement. It was   something different. It struck home where it was meant to strike&#8212;   among small and unfledged investors. It roped them in by  thousands.  The shares were ten dollars each, and non-assessable.  Five out of six  orders were from one to five shares; ninety-nine  out of every hundred  were not above ten shares. It was damnable.  The very people for whom I  wanted the north to fight had been  humbugged to the tune of a million  and a quarter dollars. Within a  year Brokaw and the others had floated  a scheme which was worse  than any trust, for the trusts pay back a  part of their steals in  dividends. And _I_ was responsible! Do you  realize that, Greggy?  It was I who started the project. It was my  reports from the north  which chiefly induced people to buy. And this  company&#8212;a company  of robbers licensed under the law&#8212;I am its founder  and its vice-  president!&quot; 
  Philip dropped back into his chair. The face that he turned to   Gregson was damp with perspiration, though the room was chilly. 
  &quot;You stayed in,&quot; said Gregson. 
  &quot;I had to. There wasn't a loophole left open to me. There wasn't a   single point at which I could bring attack against Brokaw and the   others. They were six veritable Bismarcks of deviltry and  shrewdness.  They hadn't over-stepped the law. They had sold a  million and a  quarter of stock on a hundred-thousand-dollar  investment, but Brokaw  only laughed when I raged at this. 'Why,  Philip,' he said, 'we value  our license alone at over a million!'  And there was no law which could  prevent them from placing that  value upon it, or more. There was one  thing that I could do&#8212;and  only one. I could resign, decline to accept  my stock and the  hundred thousand, and publicly announce why I had  broken off my  connections with the company. I was about to do this  when cooler  judgment prevailed. It occurred to me that there would  have to be  an accounting. The company might sell a million and a  quarter of  stock&#8212;but in the end there would have to be an accounting.  If I  was out of the game it would be easily made. If I was in&#8212;well,  do  you see, Greggy? There was still a chance of making the company   win out as a legitimate enterprise, even though it began under the   black flag of piratical finance and fraud. Brokaw and the others  were  astonished at the stand I took. It was like throwing a big,  ripe plum  into the fire Brokaw was the first to hedge. He came  over to my side  in a private interview which we had, and for the  first time I  convinced him completely of the tremendous  possibilities before us. To  my surprise he began to show actual  enthusiasm in my favor. We figured  out how the company, if  properly developed, could be made to pay a  dividend of fifty cents  a share on the stock issued within two years.  This, I thought,  would be at least a partial return of the original  steal. Brokaw  worked the thing through in his own way. He was  authorized to vote  for one of the directors, who was in Europe, and he  won over two  of the others. As a consequence we voted all of the money  in the  treasury, nearly six hundred thousand dollars, and the  remainder  of the stock that was on the market, for development  purposes.  Brokaw then made the proposition that the company buy up any   interest that wished to withdraw. The two M. P.'s and a  professional  promoter from Toronto immediately sold out at fifty  thousand each.  With their original hundred thousand these three  retired with an  aggregate steal of nearly half a million. Pretty  good work for yours  truly, eh, Greggy! Good Heaven, think of it! I  started out to strike a  blow, to launch a gigantic project for the  people, and this was what I  had hatched! Robbery, bribery, fraud&#8212;  &quot; 
  He paused, his hands clenched until the blue veins stood out on   them like whipcords. 
  &quot;And&#8212;&quot; 
  Gregson spoke, uneasily. 
  &quot;And what?&quot; 
  Philip's fingers relaxed their grip on the table. 
  &quot;If that had been all, I wouldn't have called you up here,&quot; he   continued. &quot;I've taken a long time in coming down to the real hell  of  the affair, because I wanted you to understand the situation  from the  beginning. After I left Brokaw I came north again. I  possessed all the  funds necessary to make an honest working  organization out of the  Northern Fish and Development Company. I  hired two hundred additional  men, added twenty new fishing-  stations, began a second road-bed to  the main line, and started a  huge dam at Blind Indian Lake. We had  thirty horses, driven up  through the wilderness from Le Pas, and  twenty teams on the way.  There didn't appear to be an important  obstacle in the path of our  success, and I had recovered most of my  old enthusiasm when Brokaw  sprung a new mine under my feet. 
  &quot;He had written a long letter almost immediately after I left him,   which had been delayed at several places. In it he told me that he   had discovered a plot to wreck our enterprise, that some powerful   force was about to be pitted against us in the very country we  were  holding. I could see that Brokaw was tremendously worked up  when he  wrote the letter, and that for once he felt himself  outwitted by a  rival faction, and realized to the full a danger  which it took me some  time to comprehend. He had discovered  absolute evidence, he said, that  the bunch of trust capitalists  whom he had beaten were about to attack  us in another way. Their  forces were already moving into the north  country. Their object  was to stir up the country against us, to bring  about that  condition of unrest and antagonism between the people of  the north  and ourselves which would compel the government to take away  our  license. Remember, this license was only provisional. It was, in   fact, left to the people of the north to decide whether we should   remain among them or not. If they turned against us there would be   only one thing for the government to do. 
  &quot;At first Brokaw's letter caused me no very great uneasiness. I   knew the people up here. I knew that the Indian, the Breed, the   Frenchman, and the White of this God's country were as  invulnerable  to bribery as Brokaw himself is to the pangs of  conscience. I loved  them. I had faith in them. I knew them to  possess an honor which is  not known down there, where we have a  church on every four corners,  and where the Word of God is  preached day and night on the open  streets. I felt myself warming  with indignation as I replied to  Brokaw, resenting his  insinuations as to the crimes which a  'half-savage' people might  be induced to commit for a little whisky  and a little money. And  then&#8212;&quot; 
  Whittemore wiped his face. The lines settled deeper about his   mouth. 
  &quot;Greggy, a week after I received this letter two warehouses were   burned on the same night at Blind Indian Lake. They were three   hundred yards apart. There is absolutely no doubt that it was   incendiarism.&quot; 
  He waited in silence, but Gregson still sat watching him in   silence. 
  &quot;That was the beginning&#8212;three months ago. Since then some   mysterious force has been fighting us at every step. A week after  the  warehouses burned, a dredge and boat-building yard, which we  had  constructed at considerable expense at the mouth of the Gray  Beaver,  was destroyed by fire. A little later a 'premature'  explosion of  dynamite cost us ten thousand dollars and two weeks'  labor of fifty  men. I organized a special guard service, composed  of fifty of my best  men, but it seemed to do no good. Since then  we have lost three miles  of road-bed, destroyed by a washout. A  terrific charge of dynamite had  been used to let down upon us the  water of a lake which was situated  at the top of a ridge near our  right of way. Whoever our enemies are,  they seem to know our most  secret movements, and attack us whenever we  leave a vulnerable  point open. The most surprising part of the whole  affair is this:  in spite of my own efforts to keep our losses quiet  the rumor has  spread for hundreds of miles around us, even reaching  Churchill,  that the northerners have declared war against our  enterprise and  are determined to drive us out. Two-thirds of my men  believe this.  MacDougall, my engineer, believes it. Between my working  forces  and the Indians, French, and half-breeds about us there has  slowly  developed a feeling of suspicion and resentment. It is  growing&#8212;  every day, every hour. If it continues it can result in but  two  things&#8212;ruin for ourselves, triumph for those who are getting at   us in this dastardly manner. If something is not done very soon&#8212;   within a month&#8212;perhaps less&#8212;the country will run with the blood  of  vengeance from Churchill to the Barrens. If what I expect to  happen  does happen there will be no government road built to the  Bay, the new  buildings at Churchill will turn gray with disuse,  the treasures of  the north will remain undisturbed, the country  itself will slip back a  hundred years. The forest people will be  filled with hatred and  suspicion so long as the story of great  wrong travels down from father  to son. And this wrong, this crime&#8212;&quot; 
  Philip's face was white, cold, almost passionless in the grim   hardness that had settled in it. He unfolded a long typewritten   letter, and handed it to Gregson. 
  &quot;That letter is the final word,&quot; he explained. &quot;It will tell you   what I have not told you. In some way it was mixed in my mail and  I  did not discover the error until I had opened it. It is from the   headquarters of our enemies, addressed to the man who is in charge  of  their plot up here.&quot; 
  &quot;He waited, scarce breathing, while Gregson bent over the   typewritten pages. He noted the slow tightening of the other's   fingers as he turned from the first sheet to the second; he  watched  Gregson's face, the slow ebbing of color, the gray white  that followed  it, the stiffening of his arms and shoulders as he  finished. Then  Gregson looked up. 
  &quot;Good God!&quot; he breathed. 
  For a full half-minute the two men gazed at each other across the   table, without speaking.
