He was gone but for three minutes. Meanwhile, I buried my face in my  burning hands, and cried to myself in unspeakable misery.    
For, horrible as it sounds to say so, I knew perfectly well now that  Jack was Dr. Ivor: yet, in spite of that knowledge, I loved him  still. He was my father's murderer; and I couldn't help loving him!    
It was that that filled up the cup of my misery to overflowing. I  loved the man well: and I must turn to denounce him.    
He came back, flushed and hot, expecting thanks for his pains.    
"Well, she'll get you the lemon, Una," he said, panting. "I overtook  her by the big tulip-tree."    
I gazed at him fixedly, taking my hands from my face, with the tears  still wet on my burning cheek.    
"You've deceived me!" I cried sternly. "Jack, you've given me a  false name. I know who you are, now. You're no Jack at all. You're  Courtenay Ivor!"    
He drew back, quite amazed. Yet he didn't seem thunderstruck. Not  fear but surprise was the leading note on his features.    
"So you've found that out at last, Una!" he exclaimed, staring hard  at me. "Then you remember me after all, darling! You know who I am.  You haven't quite forgotten me. And you recall what has gone, do  you?"    
I rose from the sofa, ill as I was, in my horror.    
"You dare to speak to me like that, sir!" I cried. "You, whom I've  tracked out to your hiding-place and discovered! You, whom I've come  across the ocean to hunt down! You, whom I mean to give up this very  day to Justice! Let me go from your house at once! How dare you ever  bring me here? How dare you stand unabashed before the daughter of  the man you so cruelly murdered?"    
He drew back like one stung.    
"The daughter of the man I murdered!" he faltered out slowly, as in  a turmoil of astonishment. "The man <i>I</i> murdered! Oh, Una, is it  possible you've forgotten so much, and yet remember me myself? I  can't believe it, darling. Sit down, my child, and think. Surely,  surely the rest will come back to you gradually."    
His calmness unnerved me. What could he mean by these words? No  actor on earth could dissemble like this. His whole manner was  utterly unlike the manner of a man just detected in a terrible  crime. He seemed rather to reproach me, indeed, than to crouch; to  be shocked and indignant.    
"Explain yourself," I said coldly, in a very chilly voice.  "Courtenay Ivor, I give you three minutes to explain. At the end of  that time, if you can't exonerate yourself, I walk out of this house  to give you up, as I ought, to the arm of Justice!"    
He looked at me, all pity, yet inexpressibly reproachful.    
"Oh, Una," he cried, clasping his hands--those small white hands of  his--Aunt Emma's hands--the murderer's hands--how had I never  before noticed them?--"and I, who have suffered so much for you! I,  who have wrecked my whole life for you, ungrudgingly, willingly! I,  who have sacrificed even Elsie's happiness and Elsie's future for  you! This is too, too hard! Una, Una, spare me!"    
A strange trembling seized me. It was in my heart to rush forward  and clasp him to my breast. Murderer or no murderer, his look, his  voice, cut me sharply to the heart. Words trembled on the tip of my  tongue: "Oh, Jack, I love you!" But with a violent effort, I  repressed them sternly. This horrible revulsion seemed to tear me in  two. I loved him so much. Though till the moment of the discovery, I  never quite realised how deeply I loved him.    
"Courtenay Ivor," I said slowly, steeling myself once more for a  hard effort, "I knew who you were at once when I saw you poise  yourself on the parapet. Once before in my life I saw you like that,  and the picture it produced has burned itself into the very fibre  and marrow of my being. As long as I live, I can never get rid of  it. It was when you leapt from the window at The Grange, at  Woodbury, after murdering my father!"    
He started once more.    
"Una," he said solemnly, in a very clear voice, "there's some  terrible error somewhere. You're utterly mistaken about what took  place that night. But oh, great heavens! how am I ever to explain  the misconception to <i>you</i>? If you still think thus, it would be cruel  to undeceive you. I daren't tell you the whole truth. It would kill  you! It would kill you!"    
I drew myself up like a pillar of ice.    
"Go on," I said, in a hard voice; for I saw he had something to say.  "Don't mind for my heart. Tell me the truth. I can stand it."    
He hesitated for a minute or two.    
"I can't!" he cried huskily. "Dear Una, don't ask me! Won't you  trust me, without? Won't you believe me when I tell you, I never did  it?"    
"No, I can't," I answered with sullen resolution, though my eyes  belied my words. "I can't disbelieve the evidence of my own senses.  I <i>saw</i> you escape that night. I see you still. I've seen you for  years. I <i>know</i> it was you, and you only, who did it!"    
He flung himself down in a chair, and let his arms drop listlessly.    
"Oh! what can I ever do to disillusion you?" he cried in despair.  "Oh! what can I ever do? This is too, too terrible!"    
I moved towards the door.    
"I'm going," I said, with a gulp. "You've deceived me, Jack. You've  lied to me. You have given me feigned names. You have decoyed me to  your house under false pretences. And I recognise you now. I know  you in all your baseness. You're my father's murderer! Don't hope to  escape by playing on my feelings. I'd deserve to be murdered myself,  if I could act like that! I'm on my way to the police-office, to  give you in custody on the charge of murdering Vivian Callingham at  Woodbury!"    
He jumped up again, all anxiety.    
"Oh, no, you mustn't walk!" he cried, laying his hand upon my arm.  "Give me up, if you like; but wait till the buggy comes back, and  Elsie'll drive you round with me. You're not fit to go a step as you  are at present... Oh! what shall I ever do, though. You're so weak  and ill. Elsie'll never allow it."    
"Elsie'll never allow <i>what</i>?" I asked; though I felt it was rather  more grotesque than undignified and inconsistent thus to parley and  make terms with my father's murderer. Though, to be sure, it was  Jack, and I couldn't bear to refuse him.    
He kept his hand on my arm with an air of authority.    
"Una, my child," he said, thrusting me back--and even at that  moment of supreme horror, a thrill ran all through my body at his  touch and his words--"you <i>mustn't</i> go out of this house as you are  this minute. I refuse to allow it. I'm your doctor, and I forbid it.  You're under my charge, and I won't let you stir. If I did, I'd be  responsible."    
He pushed me gently into a chair.    
"I gave you but one false name," he said slowly--"the name of  Cheriton. To be sure I, was never christened John, but I'm Jack to  my intimates. It was my nickname from a baby. Jack's what I've  always been called at home--Jack's what, in the dear old days at  Torquay, you always called me. But I saw if I let you know who I was  at once, there'd be no chance of recalling the past, and so saving  you from yourself. To save you, I consented to that one mild  deception. It succeeded in bringing you here, and in keeping you  here till Elsie and I were once more what we'd always been to you. I  meant to tell you all in the end, when the right time came. Now,  you've forced my hand, and I don't know how I can any longer refrain  from telling you."    
"Telling me <i>what</i>?" I said icily. "What do you mean by your words?  Why all these dark hints? If you've anything to say, why not say it  like a man?"    
For I loved him so much that in my heart of hearts, I half hoped  there might still be some excuse, some explanation.    
He looked at me solemnly. Then he leant back in his chair and drew  his hand across his brow. I could see now why I hadn't recognised  that delicate hand before: white as it was by nature, hard work on  the farm had long bronzed and distorted it. But I saw also, for the  first time, that the palm was scarred with cuts and rents--exactly  like Minnie Moore's, exactly like Aunt Emma's.    
"Una," he began slowly, in a very puzzled tone, "if I could, I'd  give myself up and be tried, and be found guilty and executed for  your sake, sooner than cause you any further distress, or expose you  to the shock of any more disclosures. But I can't do that, on  Elsie's account. Even if I decided to put Elsie to that shame and  disgrace--which would hardly be just, which would hardly be manly of  me--Elsie knows all, and Elsie'd never consent to it. She'd never  let her brother be hanged for a crime of which (as she knows) he's  entirely innocent. And she'd tell out all in full court--every fact,  every detail--which would be worse for you ten thousand times in the  end than learning it here quietly."    
"Tell me all," I said, growing stony, yet trembling from head to  foot. "Oh, Jack,"--I seized his hand,--"I don't know what you mean!  But I somehow trust you. I want to know all. I can bear  anything--anything--better than this suspense. You <i>must</i> tell me! You  <i>must</i> explain to me!"    
"I will," he said slowly, looking hard into my eyes, and feeling my  pulse half unconsciously with his finger as he spoke. "Una darling,  you must make up your mind now for a terrible shock. I won't tell  you in words, for you'd never believe it. I'll <i>show</i> you who it was  that fired the shot at Mr. Callingham."    
He moved over to the other side of the room, and unlocking drawer  after drawer, took a bundle of photographs from the inmost secret  cabinet of a desk in the corner.    
"There, Una," he said, selecting one of them and holding it up  before my eyes. "Prepare yourself, darling. That's the person who  pulled the trigger that night in the library!"    
I looked at it and fell back with a deadly shriek of horror. It was  an instantaneous photograph. It represented a scene just before the  one the Inspector gave me. And there, in its midst, I saw myself as  a girl, with a pistol in my hand. The muzzle flashed and smoked. I  knew the whole truth. It was I myself who held the pistol and fired  at my father!
