  Harry waited eagerly for the next issue of the &#8220;Weekly Standard.&#8221; It  was received by Mr. Anderson in exchange for the &#8220;Centreville Gazette,&#8221;  and usually came to hand on Saturday morning. Harry was likely to  obtain the first chance of examining the paper, as he was ordinarily  sent to the post-office on the arrival of the morning mail.
  His hands trembled as he unfolded the paper and hurriedly scanned  the contents. But he looked in vain for his essay on Ambition. There  was not even a reference to it. He was disappointed, but he soon became  hopeful again.
  &#8220;I couldn't expect it to appear so soon,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;These city  weeklies have to be printed some days in advance. It may appear yet.&#8221;
  So he was left in suspense another week, hopeful and doubtful by  turns of the success of his first offering for the press. He was  rallied from time to time on his silence in the office, but he  continued to keep his secret. If his contribution was slighted, no one  should know it but himself.
  At last another Saturday morning came around and again he set out  for the post-office. Again he opened the paper with trembling fingers,  and eagerly scanned the well-filled columns. This time his search was  rewarded. There, on the first column of the last page, in all the glory  of print, was his treasured essay!
  A flash of pleasure tinged his cheek, and his heart beat rapidly, as  he read his first printed production. It is a great event in the life  of a literary novice, when he first sees himself. Even Byron says,&#8212;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's self in print.&#8221;
  To our young hero the essay read remarkably well&#8212;better than he had  expected; but then, very likely he was prejudiced in its favor. He read  it through three times on his way back to the printing office, and each  time felt better satisfied.
  &#8220;I wonder if any of the readers will think it was written by a boy?&#8221;  thought Harry. Probably many did so suspect, for, as I have said,  though the thoughts were good and sensible, the article was only  moderately well expressed. A practised critic would readily have  detected marks of immaturity, although it was a very creditable  production for a boy of sixteen.
  &#8220;Shall I tell Ferguson?&#8221; thought Harry.
  On the whole he concluded to remain silent just at present. He knew  Ferguson took the paper, and waited to see if he would make any remark  about it.
  &#8220;I should like to hear him speak of it, without knowing that I was  the writer,&#8221; thought our hero.
  Just before he reached the office, he discovered with satisfaction  the following editorial reference to his article:&#8212;
  &#8220;We print in another column an essay on 'ambition' by a new  contributor. It contains some good ideas, and we especially commend it  to the perusal of our young readers. We hope to hear from 'Franklin'  again.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's good,&#8221; thought Harry. &#8220;I am glad the editor likes it. I  shall write again as soon as possible.&#8221;
  &#8220;What makes you look so bright, Harry?&#8221; asked Ferguson, as he  re-entered the office. &#8220;Has any one left you a fortune?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Do I look happier than usual?&#8221;
  &#8220;So it seems to me.&#8221;
  Harry was spared answering this question, for Clapp struck in,  grumbling, as usual: &#8220;I wish somebody'd leave me a fortune. You  wouldn't see me here long.&#8221;
  &#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked his fellow-workman.
  &#8220;Cut work to begin with. I'd go to Europe and have a jolly time.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can do that without a fortune.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should like to know how?&#8221;
  &#8220;Be economical, and you can save enough in three years to pay for a  short trip. Bayard Taylor was gone two years, and only spent five  hundred dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, hang economy!&#8221; drawled Clapp. &#8220;It don't suit me. I should like  to know how a feller's going to economize on fifteen dollars a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;I could.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, no doubt,&#8221; sneered Clapp, &#8220;but a man can't starve.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come round and take supper with me, some night,&#8221; said Ferguson,  good-humoredly, &#8220;and you can judge for yourself whether I believe in  starving.&#8221;
  Clapp didn't reply to this invitation. He would not have enjoyed a  quiet evening with his fellow-workman. An evening at billiards or  cards, accompanied by bets on the games, would have been much more to  his mind.
  &#8220;Who is Bayard Taylor, that made such a cheap tour in Europe?&#8221; asked  Harry, soon afterward.
  &#8220;A young journalist who had a great desire to travel. He has lately  published an account of his tour. I don't buy many books, but I bought  that. Would you like to read it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very much.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can have it any time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
  On Monday, a very agreeable surprise awaited Harry.
  &#8220;I am out of copy,&#8221; he said, going up to Mr. Anderson's table.
  &#8220;Here's a selection for the first page,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson. &#8220;Cut it  in two, and give part of it to Clapp.&#8221;
  Could Harry believe his eyes! It was his own article on ambition,  and it was to be reproduced in the &#8220;Gazette.&#8221; Next to the delight of  seeing one's self in print for the first time, is the delight of seeing  that first article copied. It is a mark of appreciation which cannot be  mistaken.
  Still Harry said nothing, but, with a manner as unconcerned as  possible, handed the lower half of the essay to Clapp to set up. The  signature &#8220;Franklin&#8221; had been cut off, and the name of the paper from  which the essay had been cut was substituted.
  &#8220;Wouldn't Clapp feel disgusted,&#8221; thought Harry, &#8220;if he knew that he  was setting up an article of mine. I believe he would have a fit.&#8221;
  He was too considerate to expose his fellow-workman to such a  contingency, and went about his work in silence.
  That evening he wrote to the publisher of the &#8220;Standard,&#8221; inclosing  the price of two copies of the last number, which he desired should be  sent to him by mail. He wished to keep one himself, and the other he  intended to forward to his father, who, he knew, would sympathize with  him in his success as well as his aspirations. He accompanied the paper  by a letter in which he said,&#8212;
  &#8220;I want to improve in writing as much as, I can. I want to be  something more than a printer, sometime. I shall try to qualify myself  for an editor; for an editor can exert a good deal of influence in the  community. I hope you will approve my plans.&#8221;
  In due time Harry received the following reply:&#8212;
  &#8220;My dear son:&#8212;I am indeed pleased and proud to hear of your  success, not that it is a great matter in itself, but because I think  it shows that you are in earnest in your determination to win an  honorable position by honorable labor. I am sorry that my narrow means  have not permitted me to give you those advantages which wealthy  fathers can bestow upon their sons. I should like to have sent you to  college and given you an opportunity afterward of studying for a  profession. I think your natural abilities would have justified such an  outlay. But, alas! poverty has always held me back. It shuts out you,  as it has shut out me, from the chance of culture. Your college, my  boy, must be the printing office. If you make the best of that, you  will find that it is no mean instructor. Not Franklin alone, but many  of our most eminent and influential men have graduated from it.
  &#8220;You will be glad to hear that we are all well. I have sold the cow  which I bought of Squire Green, and got another in her place that  proves to be much better. We all send much love, and your mother wishes  me to say that she misses you very much, as indeed we all do. But we  know that you are better off in Centreville than you would be at home,  and that helps to make us contented. Don't forget to write every week.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Your affectionate father, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;HIRAM WALTON.
  &#8220;P. S.&#8212;If you print any more articles, we shall be interested to  read them.&#8221;
  Harry read this letter with eager interest. He felt glad that his  father was pleased with him, and it stimulated him to increased  exertions.
  &#8220;Poor father!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;He has led a hard life,  cultivating that rocky little farm. It has been hard work and poor pay  with him. I hope there is something better in store for him. If I ever  get rich, or even well off, I will take care that he has an easier  time.&#8221;
  After the next issue of the &#8220;Gazette&#8221; had appeared, Harry informed  Ferguson in confidence that he was the author of the article on  Ambition.
  &#8220;I congratulate you, Harry,&#8221; said his friend. &#8220;It is an excellent  essay, well thought out, and well expressed. I don't wonder, now you  tell me of it. It sounds like you. Without knowing the authorship, I  asked Clapp his opinion of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;What did he say?&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you sure it won't hurt your feelings?&#8221;
  &#8220;It may; but I shall get over it. Go ahead.&#8221;
  &#8220;He said it was rubbish.&#8221;
  Harry laughed.
  &#8220;He would be confirmed in his decision, if he knew that I wrote it,&#8221;  he said.
  &#8220;No doubt. But don't let that discourage you. Keep on writing by all  means, and you'll become an editor in time.&#8221;
