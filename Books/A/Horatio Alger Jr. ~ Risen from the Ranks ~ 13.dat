  A week later Harry Walton received the following note:&#8212;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Centreville, May 16th, 18&#8212;, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Dear Sir: At the last meeting of the Clionian <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Society you were elected a member. The next meeting <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;will be held on Thursday evening, in the Academy <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;building. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yours truly, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;GEORGE SANBORN, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Secretary. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;MR. HARRY WALTON.&#8221;
  Our hero read this letter with satisfaction. It would be pleasant  for him to become acquainted with the Academy students, but he thought  most of the advantages which his membership would afford him in the way  of writing and speaking. He had never attempted to debate, and dreaded  attempting it for the first time; but he knew that nothing desirable  would be accomplished without effort, and he was willing to make that  effort.
  &#8220;What have you there, Walton?&#8221; asked Clapp, noticing the letter  which he held in his hand.
  &#8220;You can read it if you like,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Clapp; &#8220;so you are getting in with the Academy boys?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why shouldn't he?&#8221; said Ferguson.
  &#8220;Oh, they're a stuck-up set.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't find them so&#8212;that is, with one exception,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;They are mostly the sones of rich men, and look down on those who  have to work for a living.&#8221;
  Clapp was of a jealous and envious disposition, and he was always  fancying slights where they were not intended.
  &#8220;If I thought so,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I would not join the Society, but as  they have elected me, I shall become a member, and see how things turn  out.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a good plan, Harry,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;It will be a great  advantage to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I had a chance to attend the Academy for a couple of years,&#8221;  said our hero, thoughtfully.
  &#8220;I don't,&#8221; said Clapp. &#8220;What's the good of studying Latin and Greek,  and all that rigmarole? It won't bring you money, will it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;Education will make a man more competent to  earn money, at any rate in many cases. I have a cousin, who used to go  to school with me, but his father was able to send him to college. He  is now a lawyer in Boston, making four or five times my income. But it  isn't for the money alone that an education is worth having. There is a  pleasure in being educated.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I think,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I don't see it,&#8221; said Clapp. &#8220;I wouldn't be a bookworm for anybody.  There's Walton learning French. What good is it ever going to do him?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can tell you better by and by, when I know a little more,&#8221; said  Harry. &#8220;I am only a beginner now.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dr. Franklin would never have become distinguished if he had been  satisfied with what he knew as an apprentice,&#8221; said Ferguson.
  &#8220;Oh, if you're going to bring up Franklin again, I've got through,&#8221;  said Clapp with a sneer. &#8220;I forgot that Walton was trying to be a  second Franklin.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see much chance of it,&#8221; said Harry, good-humoredly. &#8220;I  should like to be if I could.&#8221;
  Clapp seemed to be in an ill-humor, and the conversation was not  continued. He had been up late the night before with Luke Harrison, and  both had drank more than was good for them. In consequence, Clapp had a  severe headache, and this did not improve his temper.
  &#8220;Come round Thursday evening, Harry,&#8221; said Oscar Vincent, &#8220;and go to  the Society with me. I will introduce you to the fellows. It will be  less awkward, you know.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar. I shall be glad to accept your escort.&#8221;
  When Thursday evening came, Oscar and Harry entered the Society hall  arm in arm. Oscar led his companion up to the Secretary and introduced  him.
  &#8220;I am glad to see you, Mr. Walton,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Will you sign your  name to the Constitution? That is all the formality we require.&#8221;
  &#8220;Except a slight pecuniary disbursement,&#8221; added Oscar.
  &#8220;How much is the entrance fee?&#8221; asked Harry.
  &#8220;One dollar. You win pay that to the Treasurer.&#8221;
  Oscar next introduced our hero to the President, and some of the  leading members, all of whom welcomed him cordially.
  &#8220;Good-evening, Mr. Fletcher,&#8221; said Harry, observing that young  gentleman near him.
  &#8220;Good-evening, sir,&#8221; said Fletcher stiffly, and turned on his heel  without offering his hand.
  &#8220;Fletcher don't feel well,&#8221; whispered Oscar. &#8220;He had a visit from a  poor relation the other day&#8212;a tin-pedler&#8212;and it gave such a shock to  his sensitive system that he hasn't recovered from it yet.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't imagine Mr. Fletcher had such a plebeian relative,&#8221; said  Harry.
  &#8220;Nor did any of us. The interview was rich. It amused us all, but  what was sport to us was death to poor Fitz. You have only to make the  most distant allusion to a tin-pedler in his hearing, and he will  become furious.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will be careful.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, it won't do any harm. The fact was, the boy was getting too  overbearing, and putting on altogether too many airs. The lesson will  do him good, or ought to.&#8221;
  Here the Society was called to order, and Oscar and Harry took their  seats.
  The exercises proceeded in regular order until the President  announced a declamation by Fitzgerald Fletcher.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Fletcher, rising, &#8220;I must ask to be excused. I  have not had time to prepare a declamation.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Tom Carver, &#8220;under the circumstances I hope  you will excuse Mr. Fletcher, as during the last week he has had an  addition to his family.&#8221;
  There was a chorus of laughter, loud and long, at this sally. All  were amused except Fletcher himself, who looked flushed and provoked.
  &#8220;Mr. Fletcher is excused,&#8221; said the President, unable to refrain  from smiling. &#8220;Will any member volunteer to speak in his place? It will  be a pity to have our exercises incomplete.&#8221;
  Fletcher was angry, and wanted to be revenged on somebody. A bright  idea came to him. He would place the &#8220;printer's devil,&#8221; whose admission  to the Society he resented, in an awkward position. He rose with a  malicious smile upon his face.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; he said, &#8220;doubtless Mr. Walton, the new member who  has done us the<I> honor</I> to join our society, will be willing to  supply my place.&#8221;
  &#8220;We shall certainly be glad to hear a declamation from Mr. Walton,  though it is hardly fair to call upon him at such short notice.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can't you speak something, Harry?&#8221; whispered Oscar. &#8220;Don't do it,  unless you are sure you can get through.&#8221;
  Harry started in surprise when his name was first mentioned, but he  quickly resolved to accept his duty. He had a high reputation at home  for speaking, and he had recently learned a spirited poem, familiar, no  doubt, to many of my young readers, called &#8220;Shamus O'Brien.&#8221; It is the  story of an Irish volunteer, who was arrested for participating in the  Irish rebellion of '98, and is by turns spirited and pathetic. Harry  had rehearsed it to himself only the night before, and he had  confidence in a strong and retentive memory. At the President's  invitation he rose to his feet, and said, &#8220;Mr. President, I will do as  well as I can, but I hope the members of the Society will make  allowance for me, as I have had no time for special preparation.&#8221;
  All eyes were fixed with interest upon our hero, as he advanced to  the platform, and, bowing composedly, commenced his declamation. It was  not long before that interest increased, as Harry proceeded in his  recitation. He lost all diffidence, forgot the audience, and entered  thoroughly into the spirit of the piece. Especially when, in the trial  scene, Shamus is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty, Harry  surpassed himself, and spoke with a spirit and fire which brought down  the house. This is the passage:&#8212;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;My lord, if you ask me, if in my life-time <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;I thought any treason, or did any crime, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;That should call to my cheek, as I stand alone here, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;The hot blush of shame, or the coldness of fear, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Though I stood by the grave to receive my death-blow, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Before God and the world I would answer you, no! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;But if you would ask me, as I think it like, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;If in the rebellion I carried a pike, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;An' fought for ould Ireland from the first to the close, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;I answer you,<I> yes</I>; and I tell you again, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Though I stand here to perish, it's my glory that then <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;In her cause I was willing my veins should run dhry, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;An' that now for her sake I am ready to die.&#8221;
  After the applause had subsided, Harry proceeded, and at the  conclusion of the declamation, when he bowed modestly and left the  platform, the hall fairly shook with the stamping, in which all joined  except Fletcher, who sat scowling with dissatisfaction at a result so  different from his hopes. He had expected to bring discomfiture to our  hero. Instead, he had given him an opportunity to achieve a memorable  triumph.
  &#8220;You did yourself credit, old boy!&#8221; said Oscar, seizing and wringing  the hand of Harry, as the latter resumed his seat. &#8220;Why, you ought to  go on the stage!&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;I am glad I got through well.&#8221;
  &#8220;Isn't Fitz mad, though? He thought you'd break down. Look at him!&#8221;
  Harry looked over to Fletcher, who, with a sour expression, was  sitting upright, and looking straight before him.
  &#8220;He don't look happy, does he?&#8221; whispered Oscar, comically.
  Harry came near laughing aloud, but luckily for Fletcher's peace of  mind, succeeded in restraining himself.
  &#8220;He won't call you up again in a hurry; see if he does,&#8221; continued  Oscar.
  &#8220;I am sure we have all been gratified by Mr. Walton's spirited  declamation,&#8221; said the President, rising. &#8220;We congratulate ourselves  upon adding so fine a speaker to our society, and hope often to have  the pleasure of hearing him declaim.&#8221;
  There was a fresh outbreak of applause, after which the other  exercises followed. When the meeting was over the members of the  Society crowded around Harry, and congratulated him on his success.  These congratulations he received so modestly, as to confirm the  favorable impression he had made by his declamation.
  &#8220;By Jove! old fellow,&#8221; said Oscar, as they were walking home, &#8220;I am  beginning to be proud of you. You are doing great credit to your  teacher.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Professor,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Don't compliment me too much,  or I may become vain, and put on airs.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you do, I'll get Fitz to call, and remind you that you are only  a printer's devil, after all.&#8221;
