  James Leech was furious at the humiliation. What he, a gentleman's   son, to be knocked down and triumphed over by a boy who was compelled   to work! Why, it was almost a sacrilege and no punishment could be too   severe for such, flagrant outrage. How should he be revenged? First of   all, he would get Herbert discharged from his present employment.   Surely Mr. Cameron would not continue to avail himself of the services   of a common bully. To attain this, he decided to reveal the matter to   his father. 
  &#8220;That boy actually knocked you down!&#8221; exclaimed the squire. &#8220;But  why  did you permit him?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He took me by surprise,&#8221; said James. 
  &#8220;And what did you do? Did you knock him over?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I would,&#8221; said James, &#8220;but I didn't care to pursue him. I thought  I  would wait and tell you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And what do you want me to do?&#8221; 
  &#8220;To get Mr. Cameron to turn him off. I want him to starve,&#8221; said   James, bitterly. 
  &#8220;You express yourself too strongly, James; but, under the   circumstances, I can't blame you much. The boy is evidently a   ruffian.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, he is a ruffian and a brute, and I don't see what Mr. Cameron   sees about him to like, I am sure.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Probably the boy makes him think he is a model of excellence. Such   boys are apt to be deceitful.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He's deceitful enough. You'd think butter wouldn't melt in his   mouth.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shall make such representations to Mr. Cameron as, I flatter   myself, will dispose of the case of this young rascal and make him   repent his brutal and unprovoked assault. I'll go over to-morrow   forenoon to the hotel and speak to him on the subject,&#8221; said the   squire, pompously. 
  &#8220;Thank you, father. Put it as strong as you can.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I will, you may be assured of that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I can only get him turned off, I won't mind his hitting me,&#8221;   thought James. &#8220;I hope to see him in the penitentiary some day. It   would do him good.&#8221; 
  It so happened that Cameron had met Herbert in a walk he took  before  breakfast and had been informed of the occurrence of the  evening  previous. 
  &#8220;I don't know whether I ought to have struck James,&#8221; said Herbert,  in  conclusion; &#8220;but when he called my mother and myself low, I  couldn't  help it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am glad you did it,&#8221; said the young collegian. &#8220;The boy is a   disagreeable cub and deserves more than one lesson of that sort.   Didn't he offer to hit you back?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I supposed. I don't approve of fighting; but if he had shown a   little courage to back his insolence, I should have despised him less.   What will he do?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He will injure me, if he can,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;We will see what comes of it. Meanwhile, in this matter, you may   count upon my support.&#8221; 
  Herbert thanked his friend, not realizing how likely Cameron was to  be  called upon to redeem, his promise. 
  Shortly after breakfast, Cameron was told that Squire Leech wished  to  see him. 
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said the squire. &#8220;This is an early  call.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not too early, sir,&#8221; said the young collegian. 
  &#8220;The fact is, I have called on unpleasant business.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Really, sir, I am sorry to hear it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is about the Carter boy who is in your employ.&#8221; 
  &#8220;By the Carter boy, you mean my young friend, Herbert Carter, I   suppose,&#8221; said Cameron, significantly. 
  &#8220;Of course if you choose to regard him as a friend.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I certainly do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think you will look upon him in that light when you hear  that  last evening he brutally assaulted my son James, without  provocation,  in the village street, taking him by surprise and  knocking him over.&#8221; 
  Cameron did not seem as much shocked as the squire anticipated. He   took the revelation very coolly. 
  &#8220;You say he did this without provocation?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, Mr. Cameron.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Did James tell you this?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He did; and he is a boy of truth.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But perhaps he did not look upon it as a provocation when he  called  Herbert and his mother low.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He didn't say anything about that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I dare say not.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And even if he did use the word, it would not justify Carter in   brutally assaulting him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I confess I don't agree with you there, Squire Leech. I hate   brutality as much as anyone and an unprovoked assault I certainly look   upon as brutal. But for a boy to resent an insult directed against his   mother is quite a different matter, and if Herbert had not acted as he   did, I should have been ashamed of him.&#8221; 
  Squire Leech flushed all over his face. This certainly was plain   speaking. 
  &#8220;You have probably been misled by Carter's statement. I don't  believe  my boy did anything, or said anything, that Carter had a right  to  complain of.&#8221; 
  &#8220;From what I have observed of your son, I regret to differ with  you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are prejudiced against James.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I was not to begin with; but what I have seen of him, certainly,  has  not prepossessed me in his favor. He seems disposed to be insolent  to  those whom he fancies beneath him in social position.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you refer to the Carter boy,&#8221; said the squire, pompously, &#8220;I   should say that James is right in regarding him as a social inferior.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I won't argue that point, or consider how far the possession of   money, which is certainly the only point in which Herbert is inferior,   justifies your son in looking down upon him. I will only say that he   has no right to insult his social inferiors.&#8221; 
  The discussion had assumed such a different character from what the   squire anticipated, that he found it difficult to come to the request   he had in view. But he did it. 
  &#8220;I am certainly astonished, Mr. Cameron, to find you so prejudiced   against my son. If you should find you had done him an injustice, and   that the Carter boy was really the aggressor last evening, will you be   willing to discharge him from your employment?&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I find Herbert justifies your denunciations and his assault was   unprovoked, I will discharge him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then you can do it at once. You have my son's word for it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And I have Herbert's word for the contrary.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Between the two, I believe James.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Does James deny that he called Herbert and his mother low?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have not asked him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you will do so and bring me his assurance that he said nothing  of  the kind, I will examine Herbert again and try to get at the  truth.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well; I will put the question to him.&#8221; 
  Squire Leech did so on his return home. 
  &#8220;I don't know but I called him something of the kind,&#8221; James  admitted;  &#8220;but it's true, isn't it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;As to that, the boy certainly acted in a very low manner. But you   shouldn't have called him so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I couldn't help it, when I heard him boasting of Mr. Cameron's  having  taken supper at his house. Won't Cameron discharge him?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said the squire, shortly; &#8220;he is infatuated about; that boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suppose we cut both of them?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It won't do, James. Mr. Cameron's father is a wealthy  manufacturer&#8212;  much richer than I am. We must keep on good terms with  him, but we  needn't notice the Carter boy. Some day he and his mother  will be in  my power.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope so, father. I want to bring him to his knees, the proud   beggar!&#8221; 
  It was a bitter pill for James to swallow, seeing his rival high in   the favor of the young collegian.
