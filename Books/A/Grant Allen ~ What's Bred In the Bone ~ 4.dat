And, indeed, if brain-waves had been in question at all, they  ought, without a doubt, to have informed Guy Waring that at the  very moment when he was going out to send off his telegram, his  brother Cyril was sitting disconsolate, with dark blue lips and  swollen eyelids, on the footboard of the railway carriage in the  Lavington tunnel. Cyril was worn out with digging by this time,  for he had done his best once more to clear away the sand towards  the front of the train in the vague hope that he might succeed in  letting in a little more air to their narrow prison through the  chinks and interstices of the fallen sandstone. Besides, a man in  an emergency must do something, if only to justify his claim to  manliness--especially when a lady is looking on at his efforts.    
So Cyril Waring had toiled and moiled in that deadly atmosphere for  some hours in vain, and now sat, wearied out and faint from foul  vapours, by Elma's side on the damp, cold footboard. By this time  the air had almost failed them. They gasped for breath, their heads  swam vaguely. A terrible weight seemed to oppress their bosoms.  Even the lamps in the carriages flickered low and burned blue.  The atmosphere of the tunnel, loaded from the very beginning with  sulphurous smoke, was now all but exhausted. Death stared them in  the face without hope of respite--a ghastly, slow death by gradual  stifling.    
"You <i>must</i> take a little water," Elma murmured, pouring out the  last few drops for him into the tin cup--for Cyril had brought a  small bottleful that morning for his painting, as well as a packet  of sandwiches for lunch. "You're dreadfully tired. I can see your  lips are parched and dry with digging."    
She was deathly pale herself, and her own eyes were livid, for by  this time she had fairly given up all hope of rescue; and, besides,  the air in the tunnel was so foul and stupefying, she could hardly  speak; indeed, her tongue clung to her palate. But she poured out  the last few drops into the cup for Cyril and held them up imploringly,  with a gesture of supplication. These two were no strangers to one  another now. They had begun to know each other well in those twelve  long hours of deadly peril shared in common.    
Cyril waved the cup aside with a firm air of dissent.    
"No, no," he said, faintly, "you must drink it yourself. Your need  is greater far than mine."    
Elma tried to put it away in turn, but Cyril would not allow her.  So she moistened her mouth with those scanty last drops, and turned  towards him gratefully.    
"There's no hope left now," she said, in a very resigned voice.  "We must make up our minds to die where we stand. But I thank you,  oh, I thank you so much, so earnestly."    
Cyril, for his part, could hardly find breath to speak.    
"Thank you," he gasped out, in one last despairing effort. "Things  look very black; but while there's life there's hope. They may even  still, perhaps, come up with us."    
As he spoke, a sound broke unexpectedly on the silence of their  prison. A dull thud seemed to make itself faintly heard from beyond  the thick wall of sand that cut them off from the daylight. Cyril  stared with surprise. It was a noise like a pick-axe. Stooping  hastily down, he laid his ear against the rail beside the shattered  carriage.    
"They're digging!" he cried earnestly, finding words in his joy.  "They're digging to reach us! I can hear them! I can hear them!"    
Elma glanced up at him with a certain tinge of half-incredulous  surprise.    
"Yes, they're digging, of course," she said quickly. "I knew they'd  dig for us, naturally, as soon as they missed us. But how far off  are they yet? That's the real question. Will they reach us in time?  Are they near or distant?"    
Cyril knelt down on the ground as before, in an agony of suspense,  and struck the rail three times distinctly with his walking-stick.  Then he put his ear to it and listened, and waited. In less than  half a minute three answering knocks rang, dim but unmistakable,  along the buried rail. He could even feel the vibration on the iron  with his face.    
"They hear us! They hear us!" he cried once more, in a tremor of  excitement. "I don't think they're far off. They're coming rapidly  towards us."    
At the words Elma rose from her seat, still paler than ever, but  strangely resolute, and took the stick from his hand with a gesture  of despair. She was almost stifled. But. she raised it with method.  Knocking the rail twice, she bent down her head and listened in  turn. Once more two answering knocks rang sharp along the connecting  line of metal. Elma shook her head ominously.    
"No, no, they're a very long way off still," she murmured, in  a faltering tone. "I can hear it quite well. They can never reach  us!"    
She seated herself on a fragment of the broken carriage, and buried  her face in her hands once more in silence. Her heart was full.  Her head was very heavy. She gasped and struggled. Then a sudden  intuition seized her, after her kind. If the rail could carry the  sound of a tap, surely it might carry the human voice as well.  Inspired with the idea, she rose again and leant forward.    
A second time she knocked two quick little taps, ringing sharp on  the rail, as if to bespeak attention; then, putting her mouth close  to the metals, she shouted aloud along them with all the voice that  was left her--    
"Hallo, there, do you hear? Come soon, come fast. We're alive,  but choking!"    
Quick as lightning an answer rang back as if by magic, along the  conducting line of the rail--a strange unexpected answer.    
"Break the pipe of the wires," it said, and then subsided instantly.    
Cyril, who was leaning down at her side at the moment with his ear  to the rail, couldn't make out one word of it. But Elma's sharp  senses, now quickened by the crisis, were acute as an Oriental's  and keen as a beagle's.    
"Break the pipe of the wires," they say, she exclaimed, starting  back and pondering. "What on earth can they mean by that? What  on earth can they be driving at? 'Break the pipe of the wires.' I  don't understand them."    
Hardly had she spoken, when another sharp tap resounded still more  clearly along the rail at her feet. She bent down her head once  more, and laid her eager ear beside it in terrible suspense. A rough  man's voice--a navvy's, no doubt, or a fireman's--came speeding  along the metal; and it said in thick accents--    
"Do you hear what I say? If you want to breathe freer, break the  pipe of the wires, and you'll get fresh air from outside right  through it."    
Cyril this time had caught the words, and jumped up with a sudden  air of profound conviction. It was very dark, and the lamps were  going out, but he took his fusee-box from his pocket and struck a  light hastily. Sure enough, on the left-hand side of the tunnel,  half buried in rubbish, an earthenware pipe ran along by the edge  near the wall of the archway. Cyril raised his foot and brought  his heel down upon it sharply with all the strength and force he  had still left in him. The pipe broke short, and Cyril saw within  it a number of telegraph wires for the railway service. The tube  communicated directly with the air outside. They were saved! They  were saved! Air would come through the pipe! He saw it all now! He  dimly understood it!    
At the self-same moment, another sound of breaking was heard more  distinctly at the opposite end, some thirty or forty feet off through  the tunnel. Then a voice rang far clearer, as if issuing from the  tube, in short, sharp sentences--    
"We'll pump you in air. How many of you are there? Are you all  alive? Is any one injured?"    
Cyril leant down and shouted back in reply--    
"We're two. Both alive. Not hurt. But sick and half dead with  stifling. Send us air as soon as ever you can. And if possible pass  us a bottle of water."    
Some minutes elapsed--three long, slow minutes of it--intense  anxiety. Elma, now broken down with terror and want of oxygen,  fell half fainting forward towards the shattered tube. Cyril held  her up in his supporting arms, and watched the pipe eagerly. It  seemed an age; but, after a time, he became conscious of a gust of  air blowing cold on his face. The keen freshness revived him.    
He looked about him and drew a deep breath. Cool air was streaming  in through the broken place. Quick as thought, he laid Elma's mouth  as close as he could lay it to the reviving current. Her eyes were  closed. After a painful interval, she opened them languidly. Cyril  chafed her hands with his, but his chafing seemed to produce very  little effect. She lay motionless now with her eyelids half shut,  and the whites of her eyes alone showing through them. The close,  foul air of that damp and confined spot had worked its worst, and  had almost asphyxiated her. Cyril began to fear the slight relief  had arrived five minutes too late. And it must still in all  probability be some hours at least before they could be actually  disentombed from that living vault or restored to the open air of  heaven.    
As he bent over her and held his breath in speechless suspense,  the voice called out again more loudly than ever--    
"Look out for the ball in the tube. We're sending you water!"    
Cyril watched the pipe closely and struck another light. In a minute,  a big glass marble came rattling through, with a string attached  to it.    
"Pull the string!" the voice cried; and Cyril pulled with a will.  Now and again, the object attached to it struck against some  projecting ledge or angle where the pipes overlapped. But at last,  with a little humouring, it came through in safety. At the end was  a large india-rubber bottle, full of fresh water, and a flask of  brandy. The young man seized them both with delight and avidity,  and bathed Elma's temples over and over again with the refreshing  spirit. Then he poured a little into the cup, and filling it up  with water, held it to her lips with all a woman's tenderness. Elma  gulped the draught down unconsciously, and opened her eyes at once.  For a moment she stared about her with a wild stare of surprise.    
Then, of a sudden, she recollected where she was, and why, and  seizing Cyril's hand, pressed it long and eagerly.    
"If only we can hold out for three hours more," she cried, with  fresh hope returning, "I'm sure they'll reach us; I'm sure they'll  reach us!"
