I should have been glad to find an old Almanac of Nevis which contained  a description of its 11th of January, 1757. But one January is much like  another in the Leeward Islands, and he who has been there can easily  imagine the day on which Alexander Hamilton was born. The sky was a  deeper blue than in summer, for the sun was resting after the terrific  labours of Autumn, and there was a prick in the trade winds which  stimulated the blood by day and chilled it a trifle at night. The slave  women moved more briskly, followed by a trotting brood of "pic'nees,"  one or more clinging to their hips, all bewailing the rigours of winter.  Down in the river where they pounded the clothes on the stones, they  vowed they would carry the next linen to the sulphur springs, for the  very marrow in their bones was cold. In the Great Houses there were no  fires, but doors and windows were closed early and opened late, and  blankets were on every bed. The thermometer may have stood at 72 deg..    
Nevis herself was like a green jewel casket, after the autumn rains.  Oranges and sweet limes were yellow in her orchards, the long-leaved  banana trees were swelling with bunches of fruit, the guavas were ready  for cream and the boiling. The wine was in the cocoanut, the royal palms  had shed their faded summer leaves and glittered like burnished metal.  The gorgeous masses of the croton bush had drawn fresh colour from the  rain. In the woods and in the long avenues which wound up the mountain  to the Great House of every estate, the air was almost cold; but out  under the ten o'clock sun, even a West Indian could keep warm, and the  negroes sang as they reaped the cane. The sea near the shore was like  green sunlight, but some yards out it deepened into that intense hot  blue which is the final excess of West Indian colouring. The spray flew  high over the reef between Nevis and St. Kitts, glittering like the salt  ponds on the desolate end of the larger island, the roar of the breakers  audible in the room where the child who was to be called Alexander  Hamilton was born.    
Rachael rose to a ceaseless demand upon her attention for which she was  grateful during the long days of Hamilton's absence. Alexander turned  out to be the most restless and monarchical of youngsters and preferred  his mother to his black attendants. She ruled him with a firm hand,  however, for she had no mind to lessen her pleasure in him, and although  she could not keep him quiet, she prevented the blacks from spoiling  him.    
During the hurricane months Hamilton yielded to her nervous fears, as he  had done in the preceding year, and crossed to St. Kitts but seldom. As  a matter of fact, hurricanes of the first degree, are rare in the West  Indies, the average to each island being one in a century. But from the  25th of August, when all the Caribbean world prostrates itself in church  while prayers for deliverance from the awful visitation are read, to the  25th of October, when the grateful or the survivors join in  thanksgiving, every wind alarms the nervous, and every round woolly  cloud must contain the white squall. Rachael knew that Nevis boats had  turned over when minor squalls dashed down the Narrows between the  extreme points of the Islands, and that they were most to be dreaded in  the hurricane season. Hamilton's inclination was to spare in every  possible way the woman who had sacrificed so much for him, and he asked  little urging to idle his days in the cool library with his charming  wife and son. Therefore his business suffered, for his partners took  advantage of his negligence; and the decay of their fortunes began when  Rachael, despite the angry protests of Archibald Hamn, sold her property  on St. Kitts and gave Hamilton the money. He withdrew from the firm  which had treated him inconsiderately, and set up a business for  himself. For a few years he was hopeful, although more than once  obliged to borrow money from his wife. She gave freely, for she had been  brought up in the careless plenty of the Islands. Mary Fawcett,  admirable manager as she was, had been lavish with money, particularly  when her favourite child was in question; and Rachael's imagination had  never worked toward the fact that money could roll down hill and not  roll up again. She was long in discovering that the man she loved and  admired was a failure in the uninteresting world of business. He was a  brilliant and charming companion, read in the best literatures of the  world, a thoughtful and adoring husband. It availed Archibald Hamn  nothing to rage or Dr. Hamilton to remonstrate. Rachael gradually  learned that Hamilton was not as strong as herself, but the maternal  instinct, so fully aroused by her child, impelled her to fill out his  nature with hers, while denying nothing to the man who did all he could  to make her happy.    
In the third year Hamilton gave up his sail-boat, and had himself rowed  across the Narrows, where the overlooker of a salt estate he had bought  awaited him with a horse. Once he would have thought nothing of walking  the eight miles to Basseterre, but the Tropics, while they sharpen the  nerves, caress unceasingly the indolence of man. During the hurricane  season he crossed as often as he thought necessary, for with expert  oarsmen there was little danger, even from squalls, and the distance was  quickly covered.    
Gradually Rachael's position was accepted. Nothing could alter the fact  that she was the daughter of Dr. and Mary Fawcett, and Hamilton was of  the best blood in the Kingdom. She was spoken of generally as Mistress  Hamilton, and old friends of her parents began to greet her pleasantly  as she drove about the Island with her beautiful child. In time they  called, and from that it was but another step to invite, as a matter of  course, the young Hamiltons to their entertainments. After all, Rachael  was not the first woman in tropical Great Britain to love a man she  could not marry, and it was fatiguing to ask the everlasting question of  whether the honesty of a public irregular alliance were not  counterbalanced by its dangerous example. It was a day of loose morals,  the first fruit of the vast scientific movement of the century, whose  last was the French Revolution. Moreover, the James Hamiltons were  delightful people, and life on the Islands was a trifle monotonous at  times; they brought into Nevis society fresh and unusual personalities,  spiced with a salient variety. Hamilton might almost be said to have  been born an astute man of the world. He opened his doors with an  accomplished hospitality to the most intelligent and cultivated people  of the Island, ignoring those who based their social pretensions on rank  and wealth alone. In consequence he and his wife became the leaders of a  small and exclusive set, who appreciated their good fortune. Dr.  Hamilton and a few other Kittifonians were constant visitors in this  hospitable mansion. Christiana Huggins, who had taken a bold stand from  the first, carried her father there one day in triumph, and that austere  parent laid down his arms. All seemed well, and the crumbling of the  foundations made no sound.    
And Alexander? He was an excitable and ingenious imp, who saved himself  from many a spanking by his sparkling mind and entrancing sweetness of  temper. He might fly at his little slaves and beat them, and to his  white playmates he never yielded a point; but they loved him, for he was  generous and honest, and the happiest little mortal on the Island. He  could get into as towering a rage as old John Fawcett, but he was  immediately amenable to the tenderness of his parents.    
When he was four years old he was sent to a small school, which happened  to be kept by a Jewess. In spite of his precocity his parents had no  wish to force a mind which, although delightful to them in its saucy  quickness, aroused no ambitious hopes; they sent him to school merely  that there might be less opportunity to spoil him at home. His new  experience was of a brief duration.    
Hamilton on a Sunday was reading to Rachael in the library. Alexander  shoved a chair to the table and climbed with some difficulty, for he was  very small, to an elevated position among the last reviews of Europe.  He demanded the attention of his parents, and, clasping his hands behind  his back, began to recite rapidly in an unknown tongue. The day was very  hot, and he wore nothing but a white apron. His little pink feet were  bare on the mahogany, and his fair curls fell over a flushed and earnest  face, which at all times was too thin and alert to be angelic or  cherubic. Hamilton and Rachael, wondering whom he fancied himself  imitating, preserved for a moment a respectful silence, then, overcome  by his solemn countenance and the fluency of his outlandish utterance,  burst into one of those peals of sudden laughter which seem to strike  the most sensitive chord in young children. Alexander shrieked in wrath  and terror, and made as if to fling himself on his mother's bosom, then  planted his feet with an air of stubborn defiance, and went on with his  recital. Hamilton listened a moment longer, then left the house  abruptly. He returned in wrath.    
"That woman has taught him the Decalogue in Hebrew!" he exclaimed. "'Tis  a wonder his brains are not addled. He will sail boats in the  swimming-bath and make shell houses in the garden for the next three  years. We'll have no more of school."
