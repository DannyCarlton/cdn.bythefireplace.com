When Elma woke up next morning, it was broad daylight. She woke  with a start, to find herself lying upon the bed where she had flung  herself. For a minute or two she couldn't recollect or recall to  herself how it had all come about. It was too remote from anything  in her previous waking thought, too dream-like, too impossible. Then  an unspeakable horror flashed over her unawares. Her face flushed  hot. Shame and terror overcame her. She buried her head in her hands  in an agony of awe. Her own self-respect was literally outraged.  It wasn't exactly remorse; it wasn't exactly fear; it was a strange  creeping feeling of ineffable disgust and incredulous astonishment.    
There could be but one explanation of this impossible episode. She  must have gone mad all at once! She must be a frantic lunatic!    
A single thought usurped her whole soul. If she was going mad--if  this was really mania--she could never, never, never--marry Cyril  Waring.    
For in a flash of intuition she knew that now. She knew she was in  love. She knew he loved her.    
In that wild moment of awakening all the rest mattered nothing.  The solitary idea that ran now through her head, as the impulse to  dance had run through it last night, was the idea that she could  never marry Cyril Waring. And if Cyril Waring could have seen her  just then! her cheeks burned yet a brighter scarlet at that thought  than even before. One virginal blush suffused her face from chin  to forehead. The maidenly sense of shame consumed and devoured her.    
Was she mad? Was she mad? And was this a lucid interval?    
Presently, as she lay still on her bed all dressed, and with her  face in her hands, trembling for very shame, a little knock sounded  tentatively at the door of her bedroom. It was a timid, small knock,  very low and soft, and, as it were, inquiring. It seemed to say  in an apologetic sort of undertone, "I don't know whether you're  awake or not just yet; and if you're still asleep, pray don't let  me for a moment disturb or arouse you."    
"Who's there?" Elma mustered up courage to ask, in a hushed voice  of terror, hiding her head under the bed-clothes.    
"It's me, darling," Mrs. Clifford answered, very softly and sweetly.  Elma had never heard her mother speak in so tender and gentle a  tone before, though they loved one another well, and were far more  sympathetic than most mothers and daughters. And besides, that  knock was so unlike mamma's. Why so soft and low?    
Had mamma discovered her? With a despairing sense of being caught  she looked down at her tell-tale clothes and the unslept-in bed.    
"Oh, what shall I ever do?" she thought to herself, confusedly. "I  can't let mamma come in and catch me like this. She'll ask why on  earth I didn't undress last night. And then what could I ever say?  How could I ever explain to her?"    
The awful sense of shame-facedness grew upon her still more deeply  than ever. She jumped up and whispered through the door, in a  very penitent voice, "Oh, mother, I can't let you in just yet. Do  you mind waiting five minutes? Come again by-and-by. I--I--I'm so  awfully tired and queer this morning somehow."    
Mrs. Clifford's voice had an answering little ring of terror in  it, as she replied at once, in the same soft tone--    
"Very well, darling. That's all right. Stay as long as you like.  Don't trouble to get up if you'd rather have your breakfast in bed.  And don't hurry yourself at all. I'll come back by-and-by and see  what's the matter."    
Elma didn't know why, but by the very tone of her mother's voice she  felt dimly conscious something strange had happened. Mrs. Clifford  spoke with unusual gentleness, yet with an unwonted tremor.    
"Thank you, dear," Elma answered through the door, going back to  the bedside and beginning to undress in a tumult of shame. "Come  again by-and-by. In just five minutes." It would do her good, she  knew, in spite of her shyness, to talk with her mother. Then she  folded her clothes neatly, one by one, on a ohair; hid the peccant  boa away in its own lower drawer; buttoned her neat little embroidered  nightdress tightly round her throat; arranged her front hair into  a careless disorder; and tried to cool down her fiery red cheeks  with copious bathing in cold water. When Mrs. Clifford came back  five minutes later, everything looked to the outer eye of a mere  casual observer exactly as if Elma had laid in bed all night, curled  up between the sheets, in the most orthodox fashion.    
But all these elaborate preparations didn't for one moment deceive  the mother's watchful glance, or the keen intuition shared by all  the women of the Clifford family. She looked tenderly at Elma--Elma  with her face half buried in the pillows, and the tell-tale flush  still crimsoning her cheek in a single round spot; then she turned  for a second to the clothes, too neatly folded on the chair by the  bedside, as she murmured low--    
"You're not well this morning, my child. You'd better not get up.  I'll bring you a cup of tea and some toast myself. You don't feel  hungry, of course. Ah, no, I thought not. Just a slice of dry  toast--yes, yes. I have been there. Some eau de Cologne on your  forehead, dear? There, there, don't cry, Elma. You'll be better  by-and-by. Stop in bed till lunch-time. I won't let Lucy come up  with the tea, of course. You'd rather be alone. You were tired last  night. Don't be afraid, my darling. It'll soon pass off. There's  nothing on earth, nothing at all to be alarmed at."    
She laid her hand nervously on Elma's arm. Half dead with shame as  she was, Elma noticed it trembled. She noticed, too, that mamma  seemed almost afraid to catch her eye. When their glance met for  an instant the mother's eyelids fell, and her cheek, too, burned  bright red, almost as red, Elma felt, as her own that nestled hot  so deep in the pillow. Neither said a word to the other of what  she thought or felt. But their mute sympathy itself made them  more shame-faced than ever. In some dim, indefinite, instinctive  fashion, Elma knew her mother was vaguely aware what she had done  last night. Her gaze fell half unconsciously on the bottom drawer.  With quick insight, Mrs. Clifford's eye followed her daughter's.  Then it fell as before. Elma looked up at her terrified, and burst  into a sudden flood of tears. Her mother stooped down and caught her  wildly in her arms. "Cry, cry, my darling," ahe murmured, clasping  her hard to her breast. "Cry, cry; it'll do you good; there's safety  in crying. Nobody but I shall come near you to-day. Nobody else  shall know! Don't be afraid of me! Have not I been there, too? It's  nothing, nothing."    
With a burst of despair, Elma laid her face in her mother's bosom.  Some minutes later, Mrs. Clifford went down to meet her husband in  the breakfast-room.    
"Well?" the father asked, shortly, looking hard at his wife's face,  which told its own tale at once, for it was white and pallid.    
"Well!" Mrs. Clifford answered, with a pre-occupied air. "Elma's  not herself this morning at all. Had a nervous turn after she went  to her room last night. I know what it is. I suffered from them  myself when I was about her age." Her eyes fell quickly and she  shrank from her husband's searching glance. She was a plump-faced  and well-favoured British matron now, but once, many years before,  as a slim young girl, she had been in love with somebody--somebody  whom by superior parental wisdom she was never allowed to marry,  being put off instead with a well-connected match, young Mr. Clifford  of the Colonial Office. That was all. No more romance than that.  The common romance of every woman's heart. A forgotten love. Yet  she tingled to remember it.    
"And you think?" Mr. Clifford asked, laying down his newspaper and  looking very grave.    
"I don't think. I know," his wife answered hastily. "I was wrong  the other day, and Elma's in love with that young man, Cyril Waring.  I know more than that, Reginald; I know you may crush her; I know  you may kill her; but if you don't want to do that, I know she  must marry him. Whether we wish it, or whether we don't, there's  nothing else to be done. As things stand now, it's inevitable,  unavoidable. She'll never be happy with anybody else--she must have  <i>him</i>--and I, for one, won't try to prevent her."    
Mr. Reginald Clifford, C.M.G., sometime Administrator of the  island of St. Kitts, gazed at his wife in blank astonishment. She  spoke decidedly; he had never heard her speak with such firmness  in his life before. It fairly took his breath away. He gazed at  his wife blankly as he repeated to himself in very slow and solemn  tones, each word distinct, "You, for one, won't try to prevent  her!"    
"No, I won't," Mrs. Clifford retorted defiantly, assured in her  own mind she was acting right. "Elma's really in love with him;  and I won't let Elma's life be wrecked--as some lives have been  wrecked, and as some mothers would wreck it."    
Mr. Clifford leaned back in his chair, one mass of astonishment,  and let the Japanese paper-knife he was holding in his right hand  drop clattering from his fingers. "If I hadn't heard you say it  yourself, Louisa," he answered, with a gasp, "I could never have  believed it. I could--never--have--believed it. I don't believe  it even now. It's impossible, incredible."    
"But it's true," Mrs. Clifford repeated. "Elma must marry the man  she's in love with."    
Meanwhile poor Elma lay alone in her bedroom upstairs, that awful  sense of remorse and shame still making her cheeks tingle with  unspeakable horror. Mrs. Clifford brought up her cup of tea herself.  Elma took it with gratitude, but still never dared to look her  mother in the face. Mrs. Clifford, too, kept her own eyes averted.  It made Elma's self-abasement even profounder than before to feel  that her mother instinctively knew everything.    
The poor child lay there long, with a burning face and tingling  ears, too ashamed to get up and dress herself and face the outer  world, too ashamed to go down before her father's eyes, till long  after lunchtime. Then there came a noise at the door once more;  the rustling of a dress; a retreating footstep. Somebody pushed an  envelope stealthily under the door. Elma picked it up and examined  it curiously. It bore a penny stamp, and the local postmark. It  must have come then by the two o'clock delivery, without a doubt;  but the address, why, the address was written in some unknown hand,  and in printing capitals. Elma tore it open with a beating heart,  and read the one line of manuscript it contained, which was also  written in the same print-like letters.    
"Don't be afraid," the letter said, "It will do you no harm. Resist  it when it comes. If you do, you will get the better of it."    
Elma looked at the letter over and over again in a fever of dismay.  She was certain it was her mother had written that note. But she  read it with tears, only half-reassured--and then burnt it to ashes,  and proceeded to dress herself.    
When she went down to the drawing-room, Mrs. Clifford rose from  her seat, and took her hand in her own, and kissed her on one cheek  as if nothing out of the common had happened in any way. The talk  between them was obtrusively commonplace. But all that day long,  Elma noticed her mother was far tenderer to her than usual; and  when she went up to bed Mrs. Clifford held her fingers for a moment  with a gentle pressure, and kissed her twice upon her eyes, and  stifled a sigh, and then broke from the room as if afraid to speak  to her.
