  During the first few moments in which the canoe moved swiftly over   the surface of the lake an amazing change had taken place in  Neewa.  Challoner did not see it, and Miki was unconscious of it.  But every  fibre in Neewa's body was atremble, and his heart was  thumping as it  had pounded on that glorious day of the fight  between his mother and  the old he-bear. It seemed to him that  everything that he had lost was  coming back to him, and that all  would be well very soon&#8212;FOR HE  SMELLED HIS MOTHER! And then he  discovered that the scent of her was  warm and strong in the furry  black mass under his feet, and he  smothered himself down in it,  flat on his plump little belly, and  peered at Challoner over his  paws. 
  It was hard for him to understand&#8212;the man-beast back there,   sending the canoe through the water, and under him his mother,  warm  and soft, but so deadly still! He could not keep the whimper  out of  his throat&#8212;his low and grief-filled call for HER. And  there was no  answer, except Miki's responsive whine, the crying of  one child for  another. Neewa's mother did not move. She made no  sound. And he could  see nothing of her but her black and furry  skin&#8212;without head, without  feet, without the big, bald paws he  had loved to tickle, and the ears  he had loved to nip. There was  nothing of her but the patch of black  skin&#8212;and the SMELL. 
  But a great comfort warmed his frightened little soul. He felt the   protecting nearness of an unconquerable and abiding force and in  the  first of the warm sunshine his back fluffed up, and he thrust  his  brown nose between his paws and into his mother's fur. Miki,  as if  vainly striving to solve the mystery of his new-found chum,  was  watching him closely from between his own fore-paws. In his  comical  head&#8212;adorned with its one good ear and its one bad one,  and  furthermore beautified by the outstanding whiskers inherited  from his  Airedale ancestor&#8212;he was trying to come to some sort of  an  understanding. At the outset he had accepted Neewa as a friend  and a  comrade&#8212;and Neewa had thanklessly given him a good mauling  for his  trouble. That much Miki could forgive and forget. What he  could not  forgive was the utter lack of regard which Neewa seemed  to possess for  him. His playful antics had gained no recognition  from the cub. When  he had barked and hopped about, flattening and  contorting himself in  warm invitation for him to join in a game of  tag or a wrestling match,  Neewa had simply stared at him like an  idiot. He was wondering,  perhaps, if Neewa would enjoy anything  besides a fight. It was a long  time before he decided to make  another experiment. 
  It was, as a matter of fact, halfway between breakfast and noon.   In all that time Neewa had scarcely moved, and Miki was finding   himself bored to death. The discomfort of last night's storm was  only  a memory, and overhead there was a sun unshadowed by cloud.  More than  an hour before Challoner's canoe had left the lake, and  was now in the  clear-running water of a stream that was making its  way down the  southward slope of the divide between Jackson's Knee  and the  Shamattawa. It was a new stream to Challoner, fed by the  large lake  above, and guarding himself against the treachery of  waterfall and  rapid he kept a keen lookout ahead. For a matter of  half an hour the  water had been growing steadily swifter, and  Challoner was satisfied  that before very long he would be  compelled to make a portage. A  little later he heard ahead of him  the low and steady murmur which  told him he was approaching a  danger zone. As he shot around the next  bend, hugging fairly close  to shore, he saw, four or five hundred  yards below him, a rock-  frothed and boiling maelstrom of water. 
  Swiftly his eyes measured the situation. The rapids ran between an   almost precipitous shore on one side and a deep forest on the  other.  He saw at a glance that it was the forest side over which  he must make  the portage, and this was the shore opposite him and  farthest away.  Swinging his canoe at a 45-degree angle he put all  the strength of  body and arms into the sweep of his paddle. There  would be just time  to reach the other shore before the current  became dangerous. Above  the sweep of the rapids he could now hear  the growling roar of a  waterfall below. 
  It was at this unfortunate moment that Miki decided to venture one   more experiment with Neewa. With a friendly yip he swung out one  of  his paws. Now Miki's paw, for a pup, was monstrously big, and  his  foreleg was long and lanky, so that when the paw landed  squarely on  the end of Neewa's nose it was like the swing of a  prize-fighter's  glove. The unexpectedness of it was a further  decisive feature in the  situation; and, on top of this, Miki swung  his other paw around like a  club and caught Neewa a jolt in the  eye. This was too much, even from  a friend, and with a sudden  snarl Neewa bounced out of his nest and  clinched with the pup. 
  Now the fact was that Miki, who had so ingloriously begged for   mercy in their first scrimmage, came of fighting stock himself.  Mix  the blood of a Mackenzie hound&#8212;which is the biggest-footed,   biggest-shouldered, most powerful dog in the northland&#8212;with the   blood of a Spitz and an Airedale and something is bound to come of   it. While the Mackenzie dog, with his ox-like strength, is  peaceable  and good-humoured in all sorts of weather, there is a  good deal of the  devil in the northern Spitz and Airedale and it  is a question which  likes a fight the best. And all at once good-  humoured little Miki  felt the devil rising in him. This time he  did not yap for mercy. He  met Neewa's jaws, and in two seconds  they were staging a first-class  fight on the bit of precarious  footing in the prow of the canoe. 
  Vainly Challoner yelled at them as he paddled desperately to beat   out the danger of the rapids. Neewa and Miki were too absorbed to   hear him. Miki's four paws were paddling the air again, but this  time  his sharp teeth were firmly fixed in the loose hide under  Neewa's  neck, and with his paws he continued to kick and bat in a  way that  promised effectively to pummel the wind out of Neewa had  not the thing  happened which Challoner feared. Still in a clinch  they rolled off the  prow of the canoe into the swirling current of  the stream. 
  For ten seconds or so they utterly disappeared. Then they bobbed   up, a good fifty feet below him, their heads close together as  they  sped swiftly toward the doom that awaited them, and a choking  cry  broke from Challoner's lips. He was powerless to save them,  and in his  cry was the anguish of real grief. For many weeks Miki  had been his  only chum and comrade. 
  Held together by the yard-long rope to which they were fastened,   Miki and Neewa swept into the frothing turmoil of the rapids. For   Miki it was the kindness of fate that had inspired his master to   fasten him to the same rope with Neewa. Miki, at three months of   age&#8212;weight, fourteen pounds&#8212;was about 80 per cent. bone and only  a  half of 1 per cent. fat; while Neewa, weight thirteen pounds,  was  about 90 per cent. fat. Therefore Miki had the floating  capacity of a  small anchor, while Neewa was a first-class life-  preserver, and  almost unsinkable. 
  In neither of the youngsters was there a yellow streak. Both were   of fighting stock, and, though Miki was under water most of the  time  during their first hundred-yard dash through the rapids,  never for an  instant did he give up the struggle to keep his nose  in the air.  Sometimes he was on his back and sometimes on his  belly; but no matter  what his position, he kept his four overgrown  paws going like paddles.  To an extent this helped Neewa in the  heroic fight he was making to  keep from shipping too much water  himself. Had he been alone his ten  or eleven pounds of fat would  have carried him down-stream like a toy  balloon covered with fur,  but, with the fourteen-pound drag around his  neck, the problem of  not going under completely was a serious one.  Half a dozen times  he did disappear for an instant when some undertow  caught Miki and  dragged him down&#8212;head, tail, legs, and all. But Neewa  always rose  again, his four fat legs working for dear life. 
  Then came the waterfall. By this time Miki had become accustomed   to travelling under water, and the full horror of the new  cataclysm  into which they were plunged was mercifully lost to him.  His paws had  almost ceased their motion. He was still conscious of  the roar in his  ears, but the affair was less unpleasant than it  was at the beginning.  In fact, he was drowning. To Neewa the  pleasant sensations of a  painless death were denied. No cub in the  world was wider awake than  he when the final catastrophe came. His  head was well above water and  he was clearly possessed of all his  senses. Then the river itself  dropped out from under him and he  shot down in an avalanche of water,  feeling no longer the drag of  Miki's weight at his neck. 
  How deep the pool was at the bottom of the waterfall Challoner   might have guessed quite accurately. Could Neewa have expressed an   opinion of his own, he would have sworn that it was a mile. Miki  was  past the stage of making estimates, or of caring whether it  was two  feet or two leagues. His paws had ceased to operate and he  had given  himself up entirely to his fate. But Neewa came up  again, and Miki  followed, like a bobber. He was about to gasp his  last gasp when the  force of the current, as it swung out of the  whirlpool, flung Neewa  upon a bit of partly submerged driftage,  and in a wild and strenuous  effort to make himself safe Neewa  dragged Miki's head out of water so  that the pup hung at the edge  of the driftage like a hangman's victim  at the end of his rope.
