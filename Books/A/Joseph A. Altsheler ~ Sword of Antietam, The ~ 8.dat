  Dick carried the news to Pennington who danced with delight.
  &#8220;We've got 'em! we've got 'em!&#8221; he cried over and over again.
  &#8220;So we have,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;we'll be marching in a half hour and then  the trap will shut down so tight on Robert Lee that he'll never raise  the lid again.&#8221;
  It was nearly noon, and they expected every moment the order to  start, but it did not come. Dick began to be tormented by an astonished  impatience, and he saw that Colonel Winchester suffered in the same  way. The army showed no signs of moving. Was it possible that McClellan  would not advance at once on Lee, whom the scouts had now located  definitely? The hot afternoon hours grew long as they passed one by  one, and many a brave man ate his heart out with anger at the delay.  Dick saw Sergeant Whitley walking up and down, and he was eager to hear  his opinion.
  &#8220;What is it, sergeant?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why do we sit here, twiddling our  thumbs when there is an army waiting to be taken by us?&#8221;
  &#8220;You're a commissioned officer, sir, and I'm only a private.&#8221;
  &#8220;Never mind about that. You're a veteran of many years and many  fights, and I know but little. Why do we sit still in the dust and fail  to take the great prize that's offered to us?&#8221;
  &#8220;The men of an army, sir, do the fighting, but its generals are its  brains. It is for the brains to judge, to see and to command. The  generals cannot win without the men, and the men cannot win without the  generals. Now, in this case, sir, you can see&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped and shrugged his shoulders, as if it were not for him to  say any more.
  &#8220;I see,&#8221; said Dick bitterly. &#8220;You needn't say it, sergeant, but I'll  say it for you. General McClellan has been overcome by caution again,  and he sees two Johnnies where but one stands.&#8221;
  Sergeant Whitley shrugged his shoulders again, but said nothing.  Dick was about to turn away, when he saw a tall, thin figure  approaching.
  &#8220;Mr. Warner,&#8221; said Sergeant Whitley.
  &#8220;So it is,&#8221; exclaimed Dick. &#8220;It's really good old George come to  help us!&#8221;
  He rushed forward and shook hands with Warner who although thin and  pale was as cool and apparently almost as strong as ever.
  &#8220;Here I am, Dick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the great battle hasn't been  fought. I knew they couldn't fight it without me. The hospital at  Washington dismissed me in disgrace because I got well so fast. 'What's  the use,' said one of the doctors, 'in getting up and running away to  the army to get killed? You could die much more comfortably here in  bed.' 'Not at all,' I replied. 'I don't get killed when I'm with the  army. I merely get nearly killed. Then I lie unconscious on the field,  in the rain, until some good friend comes along, takes me away on his  back and puts me in a warm bed. It's a lot safer than staying in your  hospital all the time.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Oh, shut up, George! Come and see the boys. They'll be glad to know  you're back&#8212;what's left of 'em.&#8221;
  Warner's welcome was in truth warm. He seemed more phlegmatic than  ever, but he opened his eyes wide when they told him of the dispatch  that had been lost and found.
  &#8220;General McClellan must have been waiting for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Tell  him I've come.&#8221;
  But General McClellan did not yet move. The last long hour of the  day passed. The sun set in red and gold behind the western mountains,  and the Army of the Potomac still rested in its camp, although privates  even knew that precious hours were being lost, and that booming cannon  might already be telling the defenders of Harper's Ferry that Jackson  was at hand.
  Nor were they far wrong. While McClellan lingered on through the  night, never moving from his camp, Jackson and his generals were  pushing forward with fiery energy and at dawn the next day had  surrounded Harper's Ferry and its doomed garrison of more than twelve  thousand men.
  But these were things that Dick could not guess that night. One  small detachment had been sent ahead by McClellan, chiefly for scouting  purposes, and in the darkness the boy who had gone a little distance  forward with Colonel Winchester heard the booming of cannon. It was a  faint sound but unmistakable, and Dick glanced at his chief.
  &#8220;That detachment has come into contact with the rebels somewhere  there in the mountains,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the ridges and valleys are  bringing us the echoes. Oh, why in Heaven's name are we delayed here  through all the precious moments! Every hour's delay will cost the  lives of ten thousand good men!&#8221;
  And it is likely that in the end Colonel Winchester's reckoning was  too moderate. He and Dick gazed long in the direction in which Harper's  Ferry lay, and they listened, too, to the faint mutter of the guns  among the hills. Before dawn, scouts came in, saying that there had  been hard fighting off toward Harper's Ferry, and that Lee with the  other division of the Southern army was retreating into a peninsula  formed by the junction of the river Antietam with the Potomac, where he  would await the coming of Jackson, after taking Harper's Ferry.
  &#8220;Jackson hasn't taken Harper's Ferry yet,&#8221; said Dick, when he heard  the news. &#8220;Many of Banks' veterans of the valley are there, and, our  men instead of being crushed by defeat, are always improved by it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Still, I wish we'd march,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;I didn't come here merely  to go into camp. I might as well have stayed in the hospital.&#8221;
  Nevertheless they moved at daylight. McClellan had made up his mind  at last, and the army advanced joyfully to shut down the trap on Lee.  Dick's spirits rose with the sun and the advance of the troops. They  had delayed, but they would get Lee yet. There was nothing to tell them  that Harper's Ferry had fallen, and Jackson's force must still be  detained there far away. They ought to strike Lee on the morrow and  destroy him, and then they would destroy Jackson. Oh, Lee and Jackson  had been reckless generals to venture beyond the seceding states!
  They marched fast now, and the fiery Hooker soon to be called  Fighting Joe led the advance. He was eager to get at Lee, who some said  did not now have more than twenty thousand men with him, although  McClellan insisted on doubling or tripling his numbers and those of  Jackson. Scouts and skirmishers came in fast now. Yes, Lee was between  the Antietam and the Potomac and they ought to strike him on the  morrow. The spirits of the Army of the Potomac continually rose.
  Dick remained in a joyous mood. He had been greatly uplifted by the  return of his comrade, Warner, for whom he had formed a strong  attachment, and he could not keep down the thought that they would now  be able to trap Lee and end the war. The terrible field of the Second  Manassas was behind him and forgotten for the time. They rode now to a  new battle and to victory.
  Another great cloud of dust like that at Manassas rolled slowly on  toward the little river or creek of Antietam, but the heat was not so  great now. A pleasant breeze blew from the distant western mountains  and cooled the faces of the soldiers. The country through which they  were passing was old for America. They saw a carefully cultivated soil,  good roads and stone bridges.
  None of the lads and young men around Colonel Winchester rejoiced  more than Warner. Released from the hospital and with his tried  comrades once more he felt as if he were the dead come back. He was in  time, too, for the great battle which was to end the war. The cool wind  that blew upon his face tingled with life and made his pulses leap.  Beneath the granite of his nature and a phlegmatic exterior, he  concealed a warm heart that always beat steadfastly for his friends and  his country.
  &#8220;Dick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have they heard anything directly from Harper's  Ferry?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a word, at least none that I've heard about, but it's quite  sure that Jackson hasn't taken the place yet. Why should he? We have  there twelve or thirteen thousand good men, most of whom have proven  their worth in the valley. Why, they ought to beat him off entirely.&#8221;
  &#8220;And while they're doing that we ought to be taking Mr. Lee and a  lot of well-known Confederate gentlemen. I've made a close calculation,  Dick, and I figure that the chances are at least eighty per cent in  favor of our taking or destroying Lee's army.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish we had started sooner,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;We've lost a whole  day, one of the most precious days the world has ever known.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're right, Frank, and I've allowed that fact to figure  importantly in my reckoning. If it were not for the lost day I'd figure  our chance of making the finishing stroke at ninety-five per cent. But  boys, it's glorious to be back with you. Once, I thought when we were  marching back and forth so much that if I could only lie down and rest  for a week or two I'd be the happiest fellow on earth. But it became  awful as I lay there, day after day. I had suddenly left the world. All  the great events were going on without me. North or South might win,  while I lay stretched on a hospital bed. It was beyond endurance. If I  hadn't got well so fast that they could let me go, I'd have climbed out  of the window with what strength I had, and have made for the army  anyhow. Did you ever feel a finer wind than this? What a beautiful  country! It must be the most magnificent in the world!&#8221;
  Dick and Pennington laughed. Old George was growing gushy. But they  understood that he saw with the eyes of the released prisoner.
  &#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;and it's a pity that it should be  ripped up by war. Listen, boys, there's the call that's growing mighty  familiar to us all!&#8221;
  Far in front behind the hills they heard the low grumbling of  cannon. And further away to the west they heard the same sinister  mutter. The Confederates were scattered widely, and the fateful Orders  No. 191 might cause their total destruction, but they were on guard,  nevertheless. Jackson, foreseeing the possible advance of McClellan,  had sent back Hill with a division to help Lee, and to delay the  Northern army until he himself should come with all his force.
  In this desperate crisis of the Confederacy, more desperate than any  of the Southern generals yet realized, the brain under the old slouch  hat never worked with more precision, clearness and brilliancy. He  would not only do his own task, but he would help his chief while doing  it. When McClellan began his march after a delay of a day he was nearer  to Lee than Jackson was and every chance was his, save those that  lightning perception and unyielding courage win.
  The lads heard the mutter of the cannon grow louder, and rise to a  distant thunder. Far ahead of them, where high hills thick with forest  rose, they saw smoke and flashes of fire. A young Maryland cavalry  officer, riding near, explained to them that the point from which the  cannonade came was a gap in South Mountain, although it was as yet  invisible, owing to the forest.
  &#8220;We heard that Lee's army was much further away,&#8221; said Warner to  Dick. &#8220;What can it mean? What force is there fighting our vanguard?&#8221;
  It was Shepard, the spy, who brought them the facts. He had already  reported to General McClellan, when he approached Colonel Winchester.  His face was worn and drawn, and he was black under the eyes. His  clothes were covered with dust. His body was weary almost unto death,  but his eyes burned with the fire of an undying spirit.
  &#8220;I've been all the night and all this morning in the mountains and  hills,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Harper's Ferry is not yet taken, but I think it will  fall. But Hill, McLaws and Longstreet are all in this pass or the other  which leads through the mountain. They mean to hold us as long as they  can, and then hang on to the flank of our army.&#8221;
  He passed on and the little regiment advanced more rapidly. Dick saw  Colonel Winchester's eyes sparkling and he knew he was anxious to be in  the thick of it. Other and heavier forces were deploying upon the same  point, but Winchester's regiment led.
  As they approached a deadly fire swept the plain and the hills.  Rifle bullets crashed among them and shell and shrapnel came whining  and shrieking. Once more the Winchester regiment, as it had come to be  called, was smitten with a bitter and deadly hail. Men fell all around  Dick but the survivors pressed on, still leading the way for the heavy  brigades which they heard thundering behind them.
  The mouth of the pass poured forth fire and missiles like a volcano,  but Dick heard Colonel Winchester still shouting to his men to come on,  and he charged with the rest. The fire became so hot that the vanguard  could not live in it without shelter, and the colonel, shouting to the  officers to dismount, ordered them all to take cover behind trees and  rocks.
  Dick who had been carried a little ahead of the rest, sprang down,  still holding his horse, and made for a great rock which he saw on one  side just within the mouth of the pass. His frightened horse reared and  jerked so violently that he tore the bridle from the lad's hand and ran  away.
  Dick stood for a moment, scarcely knowing what to do, and then, as a  half dozen bullets whistled by his head, urging him to do something, he  finished his dash for the rock, throwing himself down behind it just as  a half a dozen more bullets striking on the stone told him that he had  done the right thing in the very nick of time.
  He carried with him a light rifle of a fine improved make, a number  of which had been captured at the Second Manassas, and which some of  the younger officers had been allowed to take. He did not drop it in  his rush for the rock, holding on to it mechanically.
  He lay for at least a minute or two flat upon the ground behind the  great stone, while the perspiration rolled from his face and his hair  prickled at the roots. He could never learn to be unconcerned when a  dozen or fifteen riflemen were shooting at him.
  When he raised his head a little he saw that the Winchester regiment  had fallen back, and that, in truth, the entire advance had stopped  until it could make an attack in full force upon the enemy.
  Dick recognized with a certain grim humor that he was isolated. He  was just a little Federal island in a Confederate sea. Up the gap he  saw cannon and masses of gray infantry. Gathered on a comparatively  level spot was a troop of cavalry. He saw all the signs of a desperate  defense, and, while he watched, the great guns of the South began to  fire again, their missiles flying far over his head toward the Northern  army.
  Dick was puzzled, but for the present he did not feel great alarm  about himself. He lay almost midway between the hostile forces, but it  was likely that they would take no notice of him.
  With a judgment born of a clear mind, he lay quite still, while the  hostile forces massed themselves for attack and defense. Each was  feeling out the other with cannon, but every missile passed well over  his head, and he did not take the trouble to bow to them as they sailed  on their errands. Yet he lay close behind that splendid and friendly  rock.
  He knew that the Southerners would have sharpshooters and  skirmishers ahead of their main force. They would lie behind stones,  trees and brush and at any moment one of them might pick him off. The  Confederate force seemed to incline to the side of the valley, opposite  the slope on which he lay, and he was hopeful that the fact would keep  him hidden until the masses of his own people could charge into the  gap.
  It was painful work to flatten his body out behind a stone and lie  there. No trees or bushes grew near enough to give him shade, and the  afternoon sun began to send down upon him direct rays that burned. He  wondered how long it would be until the Union brigades came. It seemed  to him that they were doing a tremendous amount of waiting. Nothing was  to be gained by this long range cannon fire. They must charge home with  the bayonet.
  He raised himself a little in order that he might peep over the  stone and see if the charge were coming, and then with a little cry he  dropped back, a fine gray powder stinging his face. A rifle had been  fired across the valley and a bullet chipping the top of the rock  sheltering Dick warned him that he was not the only sharpshooter who  lay in an ambush.
  Peeping again from the side of the rock, he saw curls of blue smoke  rising from a point behind a stone just like his own on the other side  of the valley. It was enough to tell him that a Southern sharpshooter  lay there and had marked him for prey.
  Dick's anger rose. Why should anyone seek his life, trying to pick  him off as if he were a beast of prey? He had been keeping quiet,  disturbing nobody, merely seeking a chance to escape, when this  ruthless rebel had seen him. He became in his turn hot and fiercely  ready to give bullet for bullet. Smoke floating through the pass and  the flash of the cannon, made him more eager to hit the sharpshooter  who was seeking so hard to hit him.
  Watching intently he caught a glimpse of a gray cap showing above  the rock across the valley, and, raising his light rifle, he fired,  quick as a flash. The return shot came at once, and chipped the rock as  before, but he dropped back unhurt, and peeping from the side he could  see nothing. He might or might not have slain his enemy. The gray cap  was no longer visible, and he watched to see if it would reappear.
  He heard the sound of a great cannonade before the mouth of the  pass, and he saw his own people advancing in force, their lines  extending far to the left and right, with several batteries showing at  intervals. Then came the rebel yell from the pass and as the Union  lines advanced the Southerners poured upon them a vast concentrated  fire.
  Dick, watching through the smoke and forgetful of his enemy across  the valley, saw the Union charge rolled back. But he also saw the men  out of range gathering themselves for a new attack. Within the pass  preparations were going on to repel it a second time. Then he glanced  toward the opposite rock and dropped down just in time. He had seen a  rifle barrel protruding above it, and a second later the bullet  whistled where his head had been.
  He grew angrier than ever. He had left that sharpshooter alone for  at least ten minutes, while he watched charge and repulse, and he  expected to be treated with the same consideration. He would pay him  for such ferocity, and seeing an edge of gray shoulder, he fired.
  No sign came from the rock, and Dick was quite sure that he had  missed. The blood mounted to his head and surcharged his brain. A  thousand little pulses that he had never heard of before began to beat  in his head, and he was devoured by a consuming anger. He vowed to get  that fellow yet.
  Lying flat upon his stomach he drew himself around the edge of the  rock and watched. There was a great deal of covering smoke from the  artillery in the pass now, and he believed that it would serve his  purpose.
  But when he got a little distance away from the rock the bank of  smoke lifted suddenly, and it was only by quickly flattening himself  down behind a little ridge of stone that he saved his life. The  sharpshooter's bullet passed so close to his head that Dick felt as if  he had received a complete hair cut, all in a flash.
  He fairly sprang back to the cover of his rock. What a fine rock  that was! How big and thick! And it was so protective! In a spirit of  defiance he fired at the top of the other stone and saw the gray dust  shoot up from it. Quick came the answering shot, and a little piece of  his coat flew with it. That was certainly a great sharpshooter across  the valley! Dick gave him full credit for his skill.
  Then he heard the rolling of drums and the mellow call of trumpets  in front of the pass. Taking care to keep well under cover he looked  back. The Union army was advancing in great force now, its front tipped  with a long line of bayonets and the mouths of fifty cannon turned to  the pass. In front of them swarmed the skirmishers, eager, active  fellows leaping from rock to rock and from tree to tree.
  Dick foresaw that the second charge would not fail. Its numbers were  so great that it would at least enter the pass and hold the mouth of  it. Already a mighty cannonade was pouring a storm of death over the  heads of the skirmishers toward the defenders, and the brigades came on  steadily and splendidly to the continued rolling of the drums.
  Dick rose up again, watching now for his enemy who, he knew, could  not remain much longer behind the rock, as he would soon be within  range of the Northern skirmishers advancing on that side.
  He fancied that he could hear the massive tread of the thousands  coming toward the pass, and the roll of the drums, distinct amid the  roar of the cannon, told him that his comrades would soon be at hand,  driving everything before them. But his eyes were for that big rock on  the other side of the valley. Now was his time for revenge upon the  sharpshooter who had sought his life with such savage persistence. The  Northern skirmishers were drawing nearer and the fellow must flee or  die.
  Suddenly the sharpshooter sprang from the rock, and up flew Dick's  rifle as he drew a bead straight upon his heart. Then he dropped the  weapon with a cry of horror. Across the valley and through the smoke he  recognized Harry Kenton, and Harry Kenton looking toward his enemy  recognized him also.
  Each threw up his hand in a gesture of friendliness and  farewell&#8212;the roar of the battle was so loud now that no voice could  have been heard at the distance&#8212;and then they disappeared in the  smoke, each returning to his own, each heart thrilling with a great  joy, because its owner had always missed the sharpshooter behind the  stone.
  The impression of that vivid encounter in the pass was dimmed for a  while for Dick by the fierceness of the fighting that followed. The  defense had the advantage of the narrow pass and the rocky slopes, and  numbers could not be put to the most account. Nevertheless, the  Confederates were pressed back along the gap, and when night came the  Union army was in full possession of its summit.
  But at the other gap the North had not achieved equal success.  Longstreet, marching thirteen miles that day, had come upon the field  in time, and when darkness fell the Southern troops still held their  ground there. But later in the night Hill and Longstreet, through fear  of being cut off, abandoned their positions and marched to join Lee.
  Dick and his comrades who did not lie down until after midnight had  come, felt that a great success had been gained. McClellan had been  slow to march, but, now that he was marching, he was sweeping the enemy  out of his way.
  The whole Army of the Potomac felt that it was winning and McClellan  himself was exultant. Early the next morning he reported to his  superior at Washington that the enemy was fleeing in panic and that  General Lee admitted that he had been &#8220;shockingly whipped.&#8221;
  Full of confidence, the army advanced to destroy Lee, who lay  between the peninsula of the Antietam and the Potomac, but just about  the time McClellan was writing his dispatch, the white flag was hoisted  at Harper's Ferry, the whole garrison surrendered, and messengers were  on their way to Lee with the news that Stonewall Jackson was coming.
