Betty awoke the next morning with the impression that she was  somewhere on the border of a negro camp-meeting. She had passed more  than one when driving in the country, and been impressed with the  religious frenzy for which the human voice seemed the best possible  medium. As she achieved full consciousness, she understood that it was  not a chorus of voices that filled her ear, but one,--rich, sonorous,  impassioned. It was singing one of the popular Methodist hymns with a  fervour which not even its typical African drawl and wail could  temper. It was some moments before Betty realized that the singer was  Harriet Walker, and then she sprang out of bed and flung on her  wrapper.    
"Great heaven!" she thought. "How shall we ever be able to keep her  secret? A bandanna gown and a voice like a cornfield darky's! I  suppose all the servants are listening in the hall."    
They were,--even the upper servants, who were English,--but they  scuttled away as their mistress appeared. She crossed the hall to  Harriet's room, rapped loudly, and entered. Her new sister, still in  her nightgown, was enjoying the deep motion of a rocking-chair, hymn-  book in hand. She brought her song to a halt as Betty appeared, but it  was some seconds before the inspired expression in her eyes gave place  to human greeting. Her face happened to be in shadow, and for the  moment Betty saw her black. Her finely cut features were indistinct,  and the ignorant fanaticism of a not remote grandmother looked from  her eyes. "Harriet!" exclaimed Betty. "I don't want to be unkind, but  you must not do that again. If you want to keep your secret, never  sing a hymn again as long as you live."    
"Ah!" Harriet gave a gasp, then a half-sob. "Ah! But I love to sing  them, honey. I have sung them every Sunday all my life, and <i>he</i> loved  them. He said I could sing with anybody, he wouldn't except angels. I  'most felt he was listening."    
"You have a magnificent voice, and you must have it cultivated. But  never sing another hymn."    
"When I go to church I know I'll just shout--without knowing what I'm  doing."    
"Then don't go to church," said Betty, desperately.    
"I must! I must! What'll the Lode say to me? Oh, my po' old uncle!"    
She was weeping like a passionate child. Betty sat down beside her and  took her hand.    
"Come," she said, "listen to me. The first time I saw you the deepest  impression I received of you was one of fine self-control. Doubtless  you wept and stormed a good deal before you acquired it--at all the  different stages of what was both renunciation and acquisition. The  last few days have unsettled you a little because you have found  yourself in a new world, minus all your old responsibilities and  trials, and the experience has made you feel younger, robbed you of  some of your hold on yourself. But that habit of self-control is  in your brain,--it is the last to leave us,--and all you have to do is  to sit down and think hard and adjust yourself. It is even more  important that you make no mistakes now than it was before. Fate  seldom gives any one two chances to begin life over again. Think hard  and keep a tight rein on yourself."    
Betty had more than negro hymns in her mind, but she did not care to  be explicit. The generalities of the subject were disagreeable enough.    
Harriet had ceased her sobbing and was listening intently. She dried  her eyes as Betty finished speaking.    
"You are right, honey," she said. "And I reckon you haven't spoken any  too soon, for I was likely to get my head turned. I'll go to church  and I <i>won't</i> sing. First I'll tie a string round my neck to remember,  and after that it'll be easy. I'm afraid I'm just naturally lazy, and  if I didn't watch myself I'd soon forget all the hard lessons I've  learned and get to be like some fat ornary old nigger who's got an  easy job."    
Betty shuddered. "The white race is not devoid of laziness. If you  want a reason for yours, just remember that the Southern sun has  prevented many a man from becoming great. Keep your mind as far away  from the other thing as possible."    
"Oh, I think I'll forget it. I felt that way yesterday. But perhaps  I'd better not," she added anxiously, as her glance fell on the hymn-  book. "No cross, no crown."    
"You will find crosses enough as you go through life," said Betty,  dryly. She rose to go, and Harriet rose also and drew herself up to  her full height. For the moment she looked again the tragic figure of  the first day of their acquaintance.    
"You must have seen by this time how ignorant I am," she said  mournfully. "Poor old uncle gave me all the schooling he had himself,  but I knew even then it wasn't what they have nowadays. And I've had  so few books to read. Once I found a five-dollar bill, and as he  wouldn't take it--the most I could do--I tramped all the way to the  nearest town and back, twenty miles, and bought a big basket full of  cheap reprints of English standard novels. Those and the few old Latin  books and the Bible and the Pilgrim's Progress are about all I've ever  read. I felt like writing you that when I read his letter, and also  telling you that I was afraid you wouldn't find me a lady in your  sense of the word--"    
"You are my sister," interrupted Betty; "of course you are a lady.  Dismiss any other idea from your mind. And in a year you will know so  much that I shall be afraid of you. I have neglected my books for  several years."    
"You are mighty good, and I'll humbly take all the advice you'll give  me."    
Betty went back to her room and sought the warm nest she had left.  "She makes me feel old," she thought. "Am I to be responsible for the  development of her character? I can't send her off to Europe yet.  There's nothing to do but keep her for at least a year, until she  knows something of the world and feels at home in it. Meanwhile I  suppose I must be her guide and philosopher! I believe that my  acquaintance with Senator North has made me feel like a child. He is  so much wiser in a minute than I could be in a lifetime; and as I have  made him the pivot on which the world revolves, no wonder I feel small  by contrast.    
"But after all, I am twenty-seven, and what is more, I have seen a  good deal of men," she added abruptly. And in a moment she admitted  that she had allowed her heart, full of the youth of unrealities and  dreams, to act independently of her more mature intelligence.    
"And that is the reason I have been so happy," she mused. "There is a  facer for the intelligence. As long as I have exercised it I have  never felt as if I were walking on air and song."    
But still her imagination did not wander beyond today's meeting and  many like it. He was married, and, independent as she was, she had  received that sound training in the conventions from which the mind  never wholly recovers. She registered a vow then and there that she  would become his friend of friends, the woman to whom he came for all  his pleasant hours, in time his confidante. She would devote her  thought to the making of herself into the companion he most needed and  desired; and she would conceal her love lest he conceive it his duty  to avoid her. She wondered if she had betrayed herself, and concluded  that she had not. Even he could not guess how much of her admiration  emanated from frankness and how much from coquetry. She would be  careful in the future.    
"That point settled," she thought, curling down deeper into her bed  and preparing for a nap, "I'll anticipate his coming and think about  him with all the youthful exuberance I please."
