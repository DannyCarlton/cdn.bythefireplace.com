There is still a third difference--the manner in which each of these  objects may be imitated. For the medium being the same, and the objects  the same, the poet may imitate by narration--in which case he can either  take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person,  unchanged--or he may present all his characters as living and moving  before us.    
These, then, as we said at the beginning, are the three differences which  distinguish artistic imitation,--the medium, the objects, and the manner.  So that from one point of view, Sophocles is an imitator of the same kind  as Homer--for both imitate higher types of character; from another point  of view, of the same kind as Aristophanes--for both imitate persons  acting and doing. Hence, some say, the name of 'drama' is given to such  poems, as representing action. For the same reason the Dorians claim the  invention both of Tragedy and Comedy. The claim to Comedy is put forward  by the Megarians,--not only by those of Greece proper, who allege that it  originated under their democracy, but also by the Megarians of Sicily,  for the poet Epicharmus, who is much earlier than Chionides and Magnes,  belonged to that country. Tragedy too is claimed by certain Dorians of  the Peloponnese. In each case they appeal to the evidence of language.  The outlying villages, they say, are by them called <img src="/media/symbols/kappa.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/omega.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/mugt.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/iota.gif">,  by the Athenians <img src="/media/symbols/delta.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/eta.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/mugt.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/iota.gif">: and they assume that  Comedians were so named not from <img src="/media/symbols/kappa.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/omega.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/mugt.gif">'<img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/zeta.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/epsilon.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/iota.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/nu.gif">,  'to revel,' but because they wandered from village to village (<img src="/media/symbols/kappa.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/tau.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"> &nbsp;  <img src="/media/symbols/kappa.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/omega.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/mugt.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/sigma.gif">, being excluded  contemptuously from the city. They add also that the Dorian word for  'doing' is <img src="/media/symbols/delta.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/rho.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/nu.gif">, and the Athenian, <img src="/media/symbols/pi.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/rho.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/alpha.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/tau.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/tau.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/epsilon.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/iota.gif"><img src="/media/symbols/nu.gif">.    
This may suffice as to the number and nature of the various modes of  imitation.
