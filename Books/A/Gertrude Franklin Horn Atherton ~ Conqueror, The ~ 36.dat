Hamilton rejoined the army at Valley Forge and soon recovered his health  and spirits. It was well that the spirits revived, for no one else  during that terrible winter could lay claim to any. The Headquarters  were in a small valley, shut in by high hills white with snow and black  with trees that looked like iron. The troops were starving and freezing  and dying a mile away, muttering and cursing, but believing in  Washington. On a hill beyond the pass Lafayette was comfortable in  quarters of his own, but bored and fearing the worst. Laurens chafed at  the inaction; he would have had a battle a day. As the winter wore on,  the family succumbed to the depressing influence of unrelieved monotony  and dread of the future, and only Hamilton knew to what depths of  anxiety Washington could descend. But despair had no part in Hamilton's  creed. He had perfect faith in the future, and announced it  persistently. He assumed the mission of keeping the family in good  cheer, and they gave him little time for his studies. As for Washington,  even when Hamilton was not at his desk, he made every excuse to demand  his presence in the private office; and Hamilton in his prayers  humorously thanked his Almighty for the gift of a cheerful disposition.  It may be imagined what a relief it was when he and Laurens, Meade, or  Tilghman raced each other up the icy gorge to Lafayette's, where they  were often jollier the night through than even a cheerful disposition  would warrant. Hamilton, although he had not much of a voice, learned  one camp-song, "The Drum," and this he sang with such rollicking abandon  that it fetched an explosive sigh of relief from the gloomiest breast.    
There were other duties from which Hamilton fled to the house on the  hill for solace. Valley Forge harboured a heterogeneous collection of  foreigners, whose enthusiasm had impelled them to offer swords and  influence to the American cause: Steuben, Du Portail, De Noailles,  Custine, Fleury, Du Plessis, the three brothers Armand, Ternant,  Pulaski, and Kosciusko. They had a thousand wants, a thousand  grievances, and as Washington would not be bothered by them, their daily  recourse was Hamilton, whom they adored. To him they could lament in  voluble French; he knew the exact consolation to administer to each, and  when it was advisable he laid their afflictions before Washington or the  Congress. They bored him not a little, but he sympathized with them in  their Cimmerian exile, and it was necessary to keep them in the country  for the sake of the moral effect. But he congratulated himself on his  capacity for work.    
"I used to wish that a hurricane would come and blow Cruger's store to  Hell," he said one day to Laurens, "but I cannot be sufficiently  thankful for that experience now. It made me as methodical as a machine,  gave my brain a system without which I never could cope with this mass  of work. I have this past week dried the tears of seven Frenchmen,  persuaded Steuben that he is not Europe, nor yet General Washington, and  without too much offending him, written a voluminous letter to Gates  calculated to make him feel what a contemptible and traitorous ass he  is, yet giving him no chance to run, blubbering, with it to the  Congress, and official letters <i>ad nauseum</i>. I wish to God I were out of  it all, and about to ride into battle at the head of a company of my  own."    
"And how many widows have you consoled?" asked Laurens. He was huddled  in his cot, trying to keep warm.    
"None," said Hamilton, with some gloom. "I haven't spoken to a woman for  three weeks."    
It was a standing joke at Headquarters that Washington always sent  Hamilton to console the widows. This he did with such sympathy and tact,  such address and energy, that his friends had occasionally been forced  to extricate him from complications. But it was an accomplishment in  which he excelled as long as he lived.    
"The Chief will never let you go," pursued Laurens. "And as there is no  one to take your place, you really should not wish it. Washington may be  the army, but you are Washington's brain, and of quite as much  importance. You should never forget--"    
"Come out and coast. That will warm your blood," interrupted Hamilton.  His own sense of duty was not to be surpassed, but he had rebellious  moods, when preaching suggested fisticuffs.    
Outside they met a messenger from Lafayette, begging them to repair to  his quarters at once. There they found him entertaining a party of  charming women from a neighbouring estate; and a half-hour later the  dignity and fashion of Washington's family might have been seen coasting  down a steep hill with three Philadelphian exiles, who were as  accomplished in many ways as they were satisfying to look upon.    
It was one of those days when a swift freeze has come with a rain-storm.  Hamilton had stood at the window of the office for an hour, early in the  day, biting the end of his quill, and watching the water change to ice  as it struck the naked trees, casing every branch until, when the sun  came out, the valley was surrounded by a diamond forest, the most  radiant and dazzling of winter sights. The sun was still out, its light  flashed back from a million facets, the ground was hard and white, the  keen cold air awoke the blood, and the three young men forgot their  grumblings, and blessed the sex which has alleviated man's burdens so  oft and well.
