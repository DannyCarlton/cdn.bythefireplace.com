  Alan Holt saw the slim figure of the girl silhouetted against the  vivid light of the open doorway of the upper-deck salon. He was not  watching her, nor did he look closely at the exceedingly attractive  picture which she made as she paused there for an instant after leaving  Captain Rifle. To him she was only one of the five hundred human atoms  that went to make up the tremendously interesting life of one of the  first ships of the season going north. Fate, through the suave agency  of the purser, had brought him into a bit closer proximity to her than  the others; that was all. For two days her seat in the dining-salon had  been at the same table, not quite opposite him. As she had missed both  breakfast hours, and he had skipped two luncheons, the requirements of  neighborliness and of courtesy had not imposed more than a dozen words  of speech upon them. This was very satisfactory to Alan. He was not  talkative or communicative of his own free will. There was a certain  cynicism back of his love of silence. He was a good listener and a  first-rate analyst. Some people, he knew, were born to talk; and  others, to trim the balance, were burdened with the necessity of  holding their tongues. For him silence was not a burden.
  In his cool and causal way he admired Mary Standish. She was very  quiet, and he liked her because of that. He could not, of course,  escape the beauty of her eyes or the shimmering luster of the long  lashes that darkened them. But these were details which did not thrill  him, but merely pleased him. And her hair pleased him possibly even  more than her gray eyes, though he was not sufficiently concerned to  discuss the matter with himself. But if he had pointed out any one  thing, it would have been her hair&#8212;not so much the color of it as the  care she evidently gave it, and the manner in which she dressed it. He  noted that it was dark, with varying flashes of luster in it under the  dinner lights. But what he approved of most of all were the smooth,  silky coils in which she fastened it to her pretty head. It was an  intense relief after looking on so many frowsy heads, bobbed and  marcelled, during his six months' visit in the States. So he liked her,  generally speaking, because there was not a thing about her that he  might dislike.
  He did not, of course, wonder what the girl might be thinking of  him&#8212;with his quiet, stern face, his cold indifference, his rather  Indian-like litheness, and the single patch of gray that streaked his  thick, blond hair. His interest had not reached anywhere near that  point.
  Tonight it was probable that no woman in the world could have  interested him, except as the always casual observer of humanity.  Another and greater thing gripped him and had thrilled him since he  first felt the throbbing pulse of the engines of the new steamship<I>  Nome</I> under his feet at Seattle. He was going<I> home</I>. And home  meant Alaska. It meant the mountains, the vast tundras, the  immeasurable spaces into which civilization had not yet come with its  clang and clamor. It meant friends, the stars he knew, his herds,  everything he loved. Such was his reaction after six months of exile,  six months of loneliness and desolation in cities which he had learned  to hate.
  &#8220;I'll not make the trip again&#8212;not for a whole winter&#8212;unless I'm  sent at the point of a gun,&#8221; he said to Captain Rifle, a few moments  after Mary Standish had left the deck. &#8220;An Eskimo winter is long  enough, but one in Seattle, Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York is  longer&#8212;for me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I understand they had you up before the Committee on Ways and Means  at Washington.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, along with Carl Lomen, of Nome. But Lomen was the real man. He  has forty thousand head of reindeer in the Seward Peninsula, and they  had to listen to him. We may get action.&#8221;
  &#8220;May!&#8221; Captain Rifle grunted his doubt. &#8220;Alaska has been waiting ten  years for a new deck and a new deal. I doubt if you'll get anything.  When politicians from Iowa and south Texas tell us what we can have and  what we need north of Fifty-eight&#8212;why, what's the use? Alaska might as  well shut up shop!&#8221;
  &#8220;But she isn't going to do that,&#8221; said Alan Holt, his face grimly  set in the moonlight. &#8220;They've tried hard to get us, and they've made  us shut up a lot of our doors. In 1910 we were thirty-six thousand  whites in the Territory. Since then the politicians at Washington have  driven out nine thousand, a quarter of the population. But those that  are left are hard-boiled. We're not going to quit, Captain. A lot of us  are Alaskans, and we are not afraid to fight.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;That we'll have a square deal within another five years, or know  the reason why. And another five years after that, we'll he shipping a  million reindeer carcasses down into the States each year. Within  twenty years we'll be shipping five million. Nice thought for the beef  barons, eh? But rather fortunate, I think, for the hundred million  Americans who are turning their grazing lands into farms and irrigation  systems.&#8221;
  One of Alan Holt's hands was clenched at the rail. &#8220;Until I went  down this winter, I didn't realize just how bad it was,&#8221; he said, a  note hard as iron in his voice. &#8220;Lomen is a diplomat, but I'm not. I  want to fight when I see such things&#8212;fight with a gun. Because we  happened to find gold up here, they think Alaska is an orange to be  sucked as quickly as possible, and that when the sucking process is  over, the skin will be worthless. That's modern, dollar-chasing  Americanism for you!&#8221;
  &#8220;And are you not an American, Mr. Holt?&#8221;
  So soft and near was the voice that both men started. Then both  turned and stared. Close behind them, her quiet, beautiful face flooded  with the moon-glow, stood Mary Standish.
  &#8220;You ask me a question, madam,&#8221; said Alan Holt, bowing courteously.  &#8220;No, I am not an American. I am an Alaskan.&#8221;
  The girl's lips were parted. Her eyes were very bright and clear.  &#8220;Please pardon me for listening,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I couldn't help it. I am  an American. I love America. I think I love it more than anything else  in the world&#8212;more than my religion, even.<I> America,</I> Mr. Holt.  And America doesn't necessarily mean a great many of America's people.  I love to think that I first came ashore in the<I> Mayflower</I>. That  is why my name is Standish. And I just wanted to remind you that Alaska<I>  is</I> America.&#8221;
  Alan Holt was a bit amazed. The girl's face was no longer placidly  quiet. Her eyes were radiant. He sensed the repressed thrill in her  voice, and he knew that in the light of day he would have seen fire in  her cheeks. He smiled, and in that smile he could not quite keep back  the cynicism of his thought.
  &#8220;And what do you know about Alaska, Miss Standish?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And yet I love it.&#8221; She pointed to the  mountains. &#8220;I wish I might have been born among them. You are  fortunate. You should love America.&#8221;
  &#8220;Alaska, you mean!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, America.&#8221; There was a flashing challenge in her eyes. She was  not speaking apologetically. Her meaning was direct.
  The irony on Alan's lips died away. With a little laugh he bowed  again. &#8220;If I am speaking to a daughter of Captain Miles Standish, who  came over in the<I> Mayflower</I>, I stand reproved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You  should be an authority on Americanism, if I am correct in surmising  your relationship.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; she replied with a proud, little tilt of her  glossy head, &#8220;though I think that only lately have I come to an  understanding of its significance&#8212;and its responsibility. I ask your  pardon again for interrupting you. It was not premeditated. It just  happened.&#8221;
  She did not wait for either of them to speak, but flashed the two a  swift smile and passed down the promenade.
  The music had ceased and the cabins at last were emptying themselves  of life.
  &#8220;A remarkable young woman,&#8221; Alan remarked. &#8220;I imagine that the  spirit of Captain Miles Standish may be a little proud of this  particular olive-branch. A chip off the old block, you might say. One  would almost suppose he had married Priscilla and this young lady was a  definite though rather indirect result.&#8221;
  He had a curious way of laughing without any more visible  manifestation of humor than spoken words. It was a quality in his voice  which one could not miss, and at times, when ironically amused, it  carried a sting which he did not altogether intend.
  In another moment Mary Standish was forgotten, and he was asking the  captain a question which was in his mind.
  &#8220;The itinerary of this ship is rather confused, is it not?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;rather,&#8221; acknowledged Captain Rifle. &#8220;Hereafter she will ply  directly between Seattle and Nome. But this time we're doing the Inside  Passage to Juneau and Skagway and will make the Aleutian Passage via  Cordova and Seward. A whim of the owners, which they haven't seen fit  to explain to me. Possibly the Canadian junket aboard may have  something to do with it. We're landing them at Skagway, where they make  the Yukon by way of White Horse Pass. A pleasure trip for flabby people  nowadays, Holt. I can remember&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;So can I,&#8221; nodded Alan Holt, looking at the mountains beyond which  lay the dead-strewn trails of the gold stampede of a generation before.  &#8220;I remember. And old Donald is dreaming of that hell of death back  there. He was all choked up tonight. I wish he might forget.&#8221;
  &#8220;Men don't forget such women as Jane Hope,&#8221; said the captain softly.
  &#8220;You knew her?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. She came up with her father on my ship. That was twenty-five  years ago last autumn, Alan. A long time, isn't it? And when I look at  Mary Standish and hear her voice&#8212;&#8221; He hesitated, as if betraying a  secret, and then he added: &#8221;&#8212;I can't help thinking of the girl Donald  Hardwick fought for and won in that death-hole at White Horse. It's too  bad she had to die.&#8221;
  &#8220;She isn't dead,&#8221; said Alan. The hardness was gone from his voice.  &#8220;She isn't dead,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;That's the pity of it. She is as much a  living thing to him today as she was twenty years ago.&#8221;
  After a moment the captain said, &#8220;She was talking with him early  this evening, Alan.&#8221;
  &#8220;Miss Captain Miles Standish, you mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. There seems to be something about her that amuses you.&#8221;
  Alan shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Not at all. I think she is a most  admirable young person. Will you have a cigar, Captain? I'm going to  promenade a bit. It does me good to mix in with the sour-doughs.&#8221;
  The two lighted their cigars from a single match, and Alan went his  way, while the captain turned in the direction of his cabin.
  To Alan, on this particular night, the steamship<I> Nome</I> was  more than a thing of wood and steel. It was a living, pulsating being,  throbbing with the very heart-beat of Alaska. The purr of the mighty  engines was a human intelligence crooning a song of joy. For him the  crowded passenger list held a significance that was almost epic, and  its names represented more than mere men and women. They were the vital  fiber of the land he loved, its heart's blood, its very  element&#8212;&#8220;giving in.&#8221; He knew that with the throb of those engines  romance, adventure, tragedy, and hope were on their way north&#8212;and with  these things also arrogance and greed. On board were a hundred  conflicting elements&#8212;some that had fought for Alaska, others that  would make her, and others that would destroy.
  He puffed at his cigar and walked alone, brushing sleeves with men  and women whom he scarcely seemed to notice. But he was observant. He  knew the tourists almost without looking at them. The spirit of the  north had not yet seized upon them. They were voluble and rather  excitedly enthusiastic in the face of beauty and awesomeness. The  sour-doughs were tucked away here and there in shadowy nooks, watching  in silence, or they walked the deck slowly and quietly, smoking their  cigars or pipes, and seeing things beyond the mountains. Between these  two, the newcomers and the old-timers, ran the gamut of all human  thrill for Alan, the flesh-and-blood fiber of everything that went to  make up life north of Fifty-four. And he could have gone from man to  man and picked out those who belonged north of Fifty-eight.
  Aft of the smoking-room he paused, tipping the ash of his cigar over  the edge of the rail. A little group of three stood near him, and he  recognized them as the young engineers, fresh from college, going up to  work on the government railroad running from Seward to Tanana. One of  them was talking, filled with the enthusiasm of his first adventure.
  &#8220;I tell you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;people don't know what they ought to know  about Alaska. In school they teach us that it's an eternal icebox full  of gold, and is headquarters for Santa Claus, because that's where  reindeer come from. And grown-ups think about the same thing. Why&#8221;&#8212;he  drew in a deep breath&#8212;&#8220;it's nine times as large as the state of  Washington, twelve times as big as the state of New York, and we bought  it from Russia for less than two cents an acre. If you put it down on  the face of the United States, the city of Juneau would be in St.  Augustine, Florida, and Unalaska would be in Los Angeles. That's how  big it is, and the geographical center of our country isn't Omaha or  Sioux City, but exactly San Francisco, California.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good for you, sonny,&#8221; came a quiet voice from beyond the group.  &#8220;Your geography is correct. And you might add for the education of your  people that Alaska is only thirty-seven miles from Bolshevik Siberia,  and wireless messages are sent into Alaska by the Bolsheviks urging our  people to rise against the Washington government. We've asked  Washington for a few guns and a few men to guard Nome, but they laugh  at us. Do you see a moral?&#8221;
  From half-amused interest Alan jerked himself to alert tension. He  caught a glimpse of the gaunt, old graybeard who had spoken, but did  not know him. And as this man turned away, a shadowy hulk in the  moonlight, the same deep, quiet voice came back very clearly:
  &#8220;And if you ever care for Alaska, you might tell your government to  hang a few such men as John Graham, sonny.&#8221;
  At the sound of that name Alan felt the blood in him run suddenly  hot. Only one man on the face of the earth did he hate with undying  hatred, and that man was John Graham. He would have followed, seeking  the identity of the stranger whose words had temporarily stunned the  young engineers, when he saw a slim figure standing between him and the  light of the smoking-room windows. It was Mary Standish. He knew by her  attitude that she had heard the words of the young engineer and the old  graybeard, but she was looking at<I> him</I>. And he could not remember  that he had ever seen quite that same look in a woman's face before. It  was not fright. It was more an expression of horror which comes from  thought and mental vision rather than physical things. Instantly it  annoyed Alan Holt. This was the second time she had betrayed a too  susceptible reaction in matters which did not concern her. So he said,  speaking to the silent young men a few steps away:
  &#8220;He was mistaken, gentlemen. John Graham should not be hung. That  would be too merciful.&#8221;
  He resumed his way then, nodding at them as he passed. But he had  scarcely gone out of their vision when quick footsteps pattered behind  him, and the girl's hand touched his arm lightly.
  &#8220;Mr. Holt, please&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped, sensing the fact that the soft pressure of her fingers  was not altogether unpleasant. She hesitated, and when she spoke again,  only her finger-tips touched his arm. She was looking shoreward, so  that for a moment he could see only the lustrous richness of her smooth  hair. Then she was meeting his eyes squarely, a flash of challenge in  the gray depths of her own.
  &#8220;I am alone on the ship,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have no friends here. I want  to see things and ask questions. Will you ... help me a little?&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean ... escort you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, if you will. I should feel more comfortable.&#8221;
  Nettled at first, the humor of the situation began to appeal to him,  and he wondered at the intense seriousness of the girl. She did not  smile. Her eyes were very steady and very businesslike, and at the same  time very lovely.
  &#8220;The way you put it, I don't see how I can refuse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As for  the questions&#8212;probably Captain Rifle can answer them better than I.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't like to trouble him,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;He has much to think  about. And you are alone.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, quite alone. And with very little to think about.&#8221;
  &#8220;You know what I mean, Mr. Holt. Possibly you can not understand me,  or won't try. But I'm going into a new country, and I have a passionate  desire to learn as much about that country as I can before I get there.  I want to know about many things. For instance&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why did you say what you did about John Graham? What did the other  man mean when he said he should be hung?&#8221;
  There was an intense directness in her question which for a moment  astonished him. She had withdrawn her fingers from his arm, and her  slim figure seemed possessed of a sudden throbbing suspense as she  waited for an answer. They had turned a little, so that in the light of  the moon the almost flowerlike whiteness of her face was clear to him.  With her smooth, shining hair, the pallor of her face under its  lustrous darkness, and the clearness of her eyes she held Alan  speechless for a moment, while his brain struggled to seize upon and  understand the something about her which made him interested in spite  of himself. Then he smiled and there was a sudden glitter in his eyes.
  &#8220;Did you ever see a dog fight?&#8221; he asked.
  She hesitated, as if trying to remember, and shuddered slightly.  &#8220;Once.&#8221;
  &#8220;What happened?&#8221;
  &#8220;It was my dog&#8212;a little dog. His throat was torn&#8212;&#8221;
  He nodded. &#8220;Exactly. And that is just what John Graham is doing to  Alaska, Miss Standish. He's the dog&#8212;a monster. Imagine a man with a  colossal financial power behind him, setting out to strip the wealth  from a new land and enslave it to his own desires and political  ambitions. That is what John Graham is doing from his money-throne down  there in the States. It's the financial support he represents, curse  him! Money&#8212;and a man without conscience. A man who would starve  thousands or millions to achieve his ends. A man who, in every sense of  the word, is a murderer&#8212;&#8221;
  The sharpness of her cry stopped him. If possible, her face had gone  whiter, and he saw her hands clutched suddenly at her breast. And the  look in her eyes brought the old, cynical twist back to his lips.
  &#8220;There, I've hurt your puritanism again, Miss Standish,&#8221; he said,  bowing a little. &#8220;In order to appeal to your finer sensibilities I  suppose I must apologize for swearing and calling another man a  murderer. Well, I do. And now&#8212;if you care to stroll about the ship&#8212;&#8221;
  From a respectful distance the three young engineers watched Alan  and Mary Standish as they walked forward.
  &#8220;A corking pretty girl,&#8221; said one of them, drawing a deep breath. &#8220;I  never saw such hair and eyes&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm at the same table with them,&#8221; interrupted another. &#8220;I'm second  on her left, and she hasn't spoken three words to me. And that fellow  she is with is like an icicle out of Labrador.&#8221;
  And Mary Standish was saying: &#8220;Do you know, Mr. Holt, I envy those  young engineers. I wish I were a man.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you were,&#8221; agreed Alan amiably.
  Whereupon Mary Standish's pretty mouth lost its softness for an  instant. But Alan did not observe this. He was enjoying his cigar and  the sweet air.
