Congress reassembled, and on the 2d of January Hamilton sent in his  Report on Public Credit. By this time excitement and anxiety, to say  nothing of cupidity, were risen to fever pitch. All realized that they  were well in the midst of a national crisis, for the country was  bankrupt, and her foreign and domestic debts footed up to quite eighty  millions of dollars--a stupendous sum in the infancy of a nation, when  there was little specie in the country, and an incalculable amount of  worthless paper, with long arrears of interest besides. If Hamilton  could cope with this great question, and if Congress, with its  determined anti-government party, would support him, the Union and its  long-suffering patriots would enter upon a season of prosperity and  happiness. If the one were inadequate to meet the situation, or the  other failed in its national duty, the consequences must be deeper  wretchedness and disaster than anything they yet had endured. The  confidence in Hamilton was very widespread, for not only were his great  abilities fully recognized, but his general opinions on the subject had  long been known, and approved by all but the politicians on the wrong  side. The confidence had been manifested in a manner little to his  liking: speculators had scoured the country, buying up government  securities at the rate of a few shillings on the pound, taking advantage  of needy holders, who dwelt, many of them, in districts too remote from  the centre of action to know what the Government was about. And even  before this "signal instance of moral turpitude," the fact that so many  old soldiers who had gone home with no other pay than government  securities, to be exchanged for specie at the pleasure of a government  which nobody had trusted, had sold out for a small sum, was one of the  agitating themes of the country; and opinion was divided upon the right  of the assignees to collect the full amount which the new government  might be prepared to pay, while the moral rights of the worthy and  original holder were ignored. It was understood, however, that Hamilton  had given no more searching thought to any subject than to this.    
The public was not admitted to the galleries of Congress in those days,  but a great crowd packed Wall and Broad streets while the Report was  reading and until some hint of its contents filtered through the guarded  doors. Hamilton himself was at home with his family, enjoying a day of  rest. It is one of the most curious incidents in his career, as well as  one of the highest tributes to his power over men, that Congress, after  mature deliberation, decided that it would be safer to receive his  Report in writing than in the form of a personal address from a man who  played so dangerously upon the nerve-board of the human nature. There  hardly could be any hidden witchery in a long paper dealing with so  unemotional a subject as finance; but no man could foresee what might be  the effect of the Secretary's voice and enthusiasm,--which was  perilously communicable,--his inevitable bursts of spontaneous  eloquence. But Hamilton had a pen which served him well, when he was  forced to substitute it for the charm of his personality. It was so  pointed, simple, and powerful, it classified with such clarity, it  expressed his convictions so unmistakably, and conveyed his subtle  appeals to human passions so obediently, that it rarely failed to  quiver like an arrow in the brain to which it was directed. And this  particular report was vitalized by the author's overwhelming sense of  the great crisis with which he was dealing. Reading it to-day, a hundred  and eleven years after it was written, and close to the top of a  twelve-story building, which is a symbol of the industry and progress  for which he more than any man who has ever dedicated his talents to the  United States is responsible, it is so fresh and convincing, so earnest,  so insistent, so courteously peremptory, that the great century which  lies between us and that empire-making paper lapses from the memory, and  one is in that anxious time, in the very study of the yet more anxious  statesman; who, on a tropical island that most of his countrymen never  will see, came into being with the seed of an unimagined nation in his  brain.    
To condense Hamilton is much like attempting to increase the density of  a stone, or to reduce the alphabet to a tabloid. I therefore shall make  no effort to add another failure to the several abstracts of this  Report. The heads of his propositions are sufficient. The Report is  accessible to all who find the subject interesting. The main points were  these: The exploding of the discrimination fallacy; the assumption of  the State debts by the Government; the funding of the entire amount of  the public debt, foreign, domestic, and State; three new loans, one to  the entire amount of the debt, another of $10,000,000, a third of  $12,000,000; the prompt payment of the arrears and current interest of  the foreign loan on the original terms of the contract; the segregating  of the post-office revenue, amounting to about a million dollars, for a  sinking fund, that the creation of a debt should always be accompanied  by the means of extinguishment; increased duties on foreign commodities,  that the government might be able to pay the interest on her new debts  and meet her current expenses; and more than one admonition for prompt  action, as the credit of the nation was reaching a lower level daily,  besides sinking more hopelessly into debt through arrears of interest.  The indebtedness he divided as follows: The foreign debt, $10,070,307,  with arrears of interest amounting to $1,640,071. The liquidated  domestic debt, $27,383,917, with arrears of interest amounting to  $13,030,168. The unliquidated part he estimated at $2,000,000, and the  aggregate debt of the State at $25,000,000; making a total of nearly  $80,000.000.    
He also hinted at his long-cherished scheme of a National Bank, and a  possible excise law, and gave considerable space to the miserable  condition of landed property and the methods by which it might be  restored to its due value.
