During the next week or so, as chance would have it, Cleer Trevennack  fell in more than once on her walks with Eustace Le Neve and Walter  Tyrrel. They had picked up acquaintance in an irregular way, to be  sure; but Cleer hadn't happened to be close by when her father uttered  those strange words to his wife, "It was he who did it; it was he who  killed our boy"; nor did she notice particularly the marked abruptness  of Tyrrel's departure on that unfortunate occasion. So she had no such  objection to meeting the two young men as Trevennack himself not  unnaturally displayed; she regarded his evident avoidance of Walter  Tyrrel as merely one of "Papa's fancies." To Cleer, Papa's fancies  were mysterious but very familiar entities; and Tyrrel and Le Neve  were simply two interesting and intelligent young men--the squire of  the village and a friend on a visit to him. Indeed, to be quite  confidential, it was the visitor who occupied the larger share of  Cleer's attention. He was so good-looking and so nice. His open face  and pink and white complexion had attracted her fancy from the very  first; and the more she saw of him the more she liked him.    
They met often--quite by accident, of course--on the moor and  elsewhere. Tyrrel, for his part, shrank somewhat timidly from the  sister of the boy, for his share in whose death he so bitterly  reproached himself; yet he couldn't quite drag himself off whenever he  found himself in Cleer's presence. She bound him as by a spell. He was  profoundly attracted to her. There was something about the pretty  Cornish girl so frank, so confiding, in one word, so magnetic, that  when once he came near her he couldn't tear himself away as he felt he  ought to. Yet he could see very well, none the less, it was for  Eustace Le Neve that she watched most eagerly, with the natural  interest of a budding girl in the man who takes her pure maiden fancy.  Tyrrel allowed with a sigh that this was well indeed; for how could he  ever dream, now he knew who she was, of marrying young Michael  Trevennack's sister?    
One afternoon the two friends were returning from a long ramble across  the open moor, when, near a little knoll of bare and weathered rock  that rose from a circling belt of Cornish heath, they saw Cleer by  herself, propped against the huge boulders, with her eyes fixed  intently on a paper-covered novel. She looked up and smiled as they  approached; and the young men, turning aside from their ill-marked  path, came over and stood by her. They talked for awhile about the  ordinary nothings of society small-talk, till by degrees Cleer chanced  accidentally to bring the conversation round to something that had  happened to her mother and herself a year or two since in Malta. Le  Neve snatched at the word; for he was eager to learn all he could  about the Trevennacks' movements, so deeply had Cleer already  impressed her image on his susceptible nature.    
"And when do you go back there?" he asked, somewhat anxiously. "I  suppose your father's leave is for a week or two only."    
"Oh, dear, no; we don't go back at all, thank heaven," Cleer answered,  with a sunny smile. "I can't bear exile, Mr. Le Neve, and I never  cared one bit for living in Malta. But this year, fortunately, papa's  going to be transferred for a permanence to England; he's to have  charge of a department that has something or other to do with  provisioning the Channel Squadron; I don't quite understand what; but  anyhow, he'll have to be running about between Portsmouth and  Plymouth, and I don't know where else; and mamma and I will have to  take a house for ourselves in London."    
Le Neve's face showed his pleasure. "That's well," he answered,  briskly. "Then you won't be quite lost! I mean, there'll be some  chance at least when you go away from here of one's seeing you  sometimes."    
A bright red spot rose deep on Cleer's cheek through the dark olive-  brown skin. "How kind of you to say so," she answered, looking down.  "I'm sure mamma'll be very pleased, indeed, if you'll take the trouble  to call." Then, to hide her confusion, she went on hastily, "And are  <i>you</i> going to be in England, too? I thought I understood the other day  from your friend you had something to do with a railway in South  America."    
"Oh, that's all over now," Le Neve answered, with a wave, well pleased  she should ask him about his whereabouts so cordially. "I was only  employed in the construction of the line, you know; I've nothing at  all to do with its maintenance and working, and now the track's laid,  my work there's finished. But as to stopping in England,--ah--that's  quite another thing. An engineer's, you know, is a roving life. He's  here to-day and there to-morrow. I must go, I suppose, wherever work  may take me. And there isn't much stirring in the markets just now in  the way of engineering."    
"I hope you'll get something at home," Cleer said, simply, with a  blush, and then blamed herself for saying it. She blushed again at the  thought. She looked prettiest when she blushed. Walter Tyrrel, a  little behind, stood and admired her all the while. But Eustace was  flattered she should think of wanting him to remain in England.    
"Thank you," he said, somewhat timidly, for her bashfulness made him a  trifle bashful in return. "I should like to very much--for more  reasons than one;" and he looked at her meaningly. "I'm getting tired,  in some ways, of life abroad. I'd much prefer to come back now and  settle down in England."    
Cleer rose as he spoke. His frank admiration made her feel self-  conscious. She thought this conversation had gone quite far enough for  them both for the present. After all, she knew so little of him,  though he was really very nice, and he looked at her so kindly! But  perhaps it would be better to go and hunt up papa. "I think I ought to  be moving now," she said, with a delicious little flush on her smooth,  dark cheek. "My father'll be waiting for me." And she set her face  across the moor in the opposite direction from the gate of Penmorgan.    
"We may come with you, mayn't we?" Eustace asked, with just an  undertone of wistfulness.    
But Tyrrel darted a warning glance at him. He, at least, couldn't go  to confront once more that poor dead boy's father.    
"I must hurry home," he said, feebly, consulting his watch with an  abstracted air. "It's getting so late. But don't let me prevent <i>you</i>  from accompanying Miss Trevennack."    
Cleer shrank away, a little alarmed. She wasn't quite sure whether it  would be perfectly right for her to walk about alone on the moorland  with only <i>one</i> young man, though she wouldn't have minded the two, for  there is safety in numbers. "Oh, no," she said, half frightened, in  that composite tone which is at once an entreaty and a positive  command. "Don't mind me, Mr. Le Neve. I'm quite accustomed to  strolling by myself round the cliff. I wouldn't make you miss your  dinner for worlds. And besides, papa's not far off. He went away from  me, rambling."    
The two young men, accepting their dismissal in the sense in which it  was intended, saluted her deferentially, and turned away on their own  road. But Cleer took the path to Michael's Crag, by the gully.    
From the foot of the crag you can't see the summit. Its own shoulders  and the loose rocks of the foreground hide it. But Cleer was pretty  certain her father must be there; for he was mostly to be found, when  tide permitted it, perched up on the highest pinnacle of his namesake  skerry, looking out upon the waters with a pre-occupied glance from  that airy citadel. The waves in the narrow channel that separate the  crag from the opposite mainland were running high and boisterous, but  Cleer had a sure foot, and could leap, light as a gazelle, from rock  to rock. Not for nothing was she Michael Trevennack's daughter, well  trained from her babyhood to high and airy climbs. She chose an easy  spot where it was possible to spring across by a series of boulders,  arranged accidentally like stepping-stones; and in a minute she was  standing on the main crag itself, a huge beetling mass of detached  serpentine pushed boldly out as the advance-guard of the land into the  assailing waves, and tapering at its top into a pyramidal steeple.    
The face of the crag was wet with spray in places; but Cleer didn't  mind spray; she was accustomed to the sea in all its moods and  tempers. She clambered up the steep side--a sheer wall of bare rock,  lightly clad here and there with sparse drapery of green sapphire, or  clumps of purple sea-aster, rooted firm in the crannies. Its front was  yellow with great patches of lichen, and on the peaks, overhead, the  gulls perched, chattering, or launched themselves in long curves upon  the evening air. Cleer paused half way up to draw breath and admire  the familiar scene. Often as she had gone there before, she could  never help gazing with enchanted eyes on those brilliantly colored  pinnacles, on that deep green sea, on those angry white breakers that  dashed in ceaseless assault against the solid black wall of rock all  round her. Then she started once more on her climb up the uncertain  path, a mere foothold in the crannies, clinging close with her tiny  hands as she went to every jutting corner or weather-worn rock, and  every woody stem of weather-beaten sea plants.    
At last, panting and hot, she reached the sharp top, expecting to find  Trevennack at his accustomed post on the very tallest pinnacle of the  craggy little islet. But, to her immense surprise, her father wasn't  there. His absence disquieted her. Cleer stood up on the fissured mass  of orange-lichened rock that crowned the very summit, dispossessing  the gulls who flapped round her as she mounted it; then, shading her  eyes with her hand, she looked down in every direction to see if she  could descry that missing figure in some nook of the crag. He was  nowhere visible. "Father!" she cried aloud, at the top of her voice;  "father! father! father!" But the only answer to her cry was the sound  of the sea on the base, and the loud noise of the gulls, as they  screamed and fluttered in angry surprise over their accustomed  breeding-grounds.    
Alarmed and irresolute, Cleer sat down on the rock, and facing  landwards for awhile, waved her handkerchief to and fro to attract, if  possible, her father's attention. Then she scanned the opposite  cliffs, beyond the gap or chasm that separated her from the mainland;  but she could nowhere see him. He must have forgotten her and gone  home to dinner alone, she fancied now, for it was nearly seven  o'clock. Nothing remained but to climb down again and follow him. It  was getting full late to be out by herself on the island. And tide was  coming in, and the surf was getting strong--Atlantic swell from the  gale at sea yesterday.    
Painfully and toilsomely she clambered down the steep path, making her  foothold good, step by step, in the slippery crannies, rendered still  more dangerous in places by the sticky spray and the brine that dashed  over them from the seething channel. It was harder coming down, a good  deal, than going up, and she was accustomed to her father's hand to  guide her--to fit her light foot on the little ledges by the way, or  to lift her down over the steepest bits with unfailing tenderness. So  she found it rather difficult to descend by herself--both difficult  and tedious. At last, however, after one or two nasty slips, and a  false step or so on the way that ended in her grazing the tender skin  on those white little fingers, Cleer reached the base of the crag, and  stood face to face with the final problem of crossing the chasm that  divided the islet from the opposite mainland.    
Then for the first time the truth was borne in upon her with a sudden  rush that she couldn't get back--she was imprisoned on the island. She  had crossed over at almost the last moment possible. The sea now quite  covered two or three of her stepping-stones; fierce surf broke over  the rest with each advancing billow, and rendered the task of jumping  from one to the other impracticable even for a strong and sure-footed  man, far more for a slight girl of Cleer's height and figure.    
In a moment the little prisoner took in the full horror of the  situation. It was now about half tide, and seven o'clock in the  evening. High water would therefore fall between ten and eleven; and  it must be nearly two in the morning, she calculated hastily, before  the sea had gone down enough to let her cross over in safety. Even  then, in the dark, she dared hardly face those treacherous stepping-  stones. She must stop there till day broke, if she meant to get ashore  again without unnecessary hazard.    
Cleer was a Trevennack, and therefore brave; but the notion of  stopping alone on that desolate island, thronged with gulls and  cormorants, in the open air, through all those long dark hours till  morning dawned, fairly frightened and appalled her. For a minute or  two she crouched and cowered in silence. Then, overcome by terror, she  climbed up once more to the first platform of rock, above the reach of  the spray, and shouted with all her might, "Father! father! father!"    
But 'tis a lonely coast, that wild stretch by the Lizard. Not a soul  was within earshot. Cleer sat there still, or stood on top of the  crag, for many minutes together, shouting and waving her handkerchief  for dear life itself; but not a soul heard her. She might have died  there unnoticed; not a creature came near to help or deliver her. The  gulls and the cormorants alone stared at her and wondered.    
Meanwhile, tide kept flowing with incredible rapidity. The gale in the  Atlantic had raised an unwonted swell; and though there was now little  wind, the breakers kept thundering in upon the firm, sandy beach with  a deafening roar that drowned Cleer's poor voice completely. To add to  her misfortunes, fog began to drift slowly with the breeze from  seaward. It was getting dark too, and the rocks were damp. Overhead  the gulls screamed loud as they flapped and circled above her.    
In an agony of despair, Cleer sat down all unnerved on the topmost  crag. She began to cry to herself. It was all up now. She knew she  must stop there alone till morning.
