<b>I</b> 
Upon your hearse this flower I lay.<br> Brief be your sleep! You shall be known<br> When lesser men have had their day:<br> Fame blossoms where true seed is sown,<br> Or soon or late, let Time wrong what it may. 
<b>II</b> 
Unvext by any dream of fame,<br> You smiled, and bade the world pass by:<br> But I--I turned, and saw a name<br> Shaping itself against the sky--<br> White star that rose amid the battle's flame! 
<b>III</b> 
Brief be your sleep, for I would see<br> Your laurels--ah, how trivial now<br> To him must earthly laurel be<br> Who wears the amaranth on his brow!<br> How vain the voices of mortality!
