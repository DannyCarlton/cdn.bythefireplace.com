  Nanette, the woman, saw Jacques come out of the edge of the timber   late in the afternoon, dragging something on the snow behind him.  In  her heart, ever since her husband had begun to talk about him,  she had  kept secret to herself a pity for the wild dog. Long  before the last  baby had come she had loved a dog. It was this dog  that had given her  the only real affection she had known in the  company of The Brute, and  with barbarous cruelty Le Beau had  driven it from her. Nanette herself  had encouraged it to seek  freedom in the wilderness, as Netah had at  last sought his.  Therefore she had prayed that the wild dog of the  trapline might  escape. 
  As Le Beau came nearer she saw that what he drew after him upon   the snow was a sledge-drag made of four lengths of sapling, and  when,  a moment later, she looked down at its burden, she gave a  little cry  of horror. 
  Miki's four feet were tied so firmly to the pieces of sapling that   he could not move. A cord about his neck was fastened to one of  the  crossbars, and over his jaws Le Beau had improvised a muzzle  of  unbreakable BABICHE thong. He had done all this before Miki  regained  consciousness after the clubbing. The woman stared, and  there was a  sudden catch in her breath after the little cry that  had fallen from  her lips. Many times she had seen Jacques club his  dogs, but never had  she seen one clubbed like this. Miki's head  and shoulders were a mass  of frozen blood. And then she saw his  eyes. They were looking straight  up at her. She turned, fearing  that Jacques might see what was in her  face. 
  Le Beau dragged his burden straight into the cabin, and then stood   back and rubbed his hands as he looked at Miki on the floor.  Nanette  saw that he was in a strangely good humour, and waited. 
  &quot;By the Blessed Saints, but you should have seen him kill Netah&#8212;   almost,&quot; he exulted. &quot;OUI; he had him down by the throat quicker  than  you could flash your eye, and twice he was within an inch of  my life  when I fought him with the club. DIEU! I say, what will  happen to  Durant's dog when they meet at Post Fort 0' God? I will  make a side  wager that he kills him before the second-hand of LE  FACTEUR'S watch,  goes round twice. He is splendid! Watch him,  Nanette, while I go make  a corral for him alone. If I put him in  with the pack he will kill  them all.&quot; 
  Miki's eyes followed him as he disappeared through the cabin door.   Then he looked swiftly back to Nanette. She had drawn nearer. Her   eyes were shining as she bent over him. A snarl rose in Miki's   throat, and died there. For the first time he was looking upon  WOMAN.  He sensed, all at once, a difference as vast as the world  itself. In  his bruised and broken body his heart stood still.  Nanette spoke to  him. Never in his life had he heard a voice like  hers&#8212;soft and  gentle, with a breaking sob in it; and then&#8212;  miracle of miracles&#8212;she  had dropped on her knees and her hands  were at his head! 
  In that instant his spirit leapt back through the generations&#8212;   back beyond his father, and his father's father; back to that far  day  when the blood in the veins of his race was &quot;just dog,&quot; and he  romped  with children, and listened to the call of woman, and  worshipped at  the shrine of humankind. And now the woman had run  quickly to the  stove, and was back again with a dish of warm water  and a soft cloth,  and was bathing his head, talking to him all the  time in that gentle,  half-sobbing voice of pity and of love. He  closed his eyes&#8212;no longer  afraid. A great sigh heaved out of his  body. He wanted to put out his  tongue and lick the slim white  hands that were bringing him peace and  comfort. And then the  strangest thing of all happened. In the crib the  baby sat up and  began to prattle. It was a new note to Miki, a new  song of Life's  spring-tide to him, but it thrilled him as nothing else  in all the  world had ever thrilled him before. He opened his eyes  wide&#8212;and  whined. 
  A laugh of joy&#8212;new and strange even to herself&#8212;came into the   woman's voice, and she ran to the crib and returned with the baby  in  her arms. She knelt down beside him again, and the baby, at  sight of  this strange plaything on the floor, thrust out its  little arms, and  kicked its tiny moccasined feet, and cooed and  laughed and squirmed  until Miki strained at his thongs to get a  little nearer that he might  touch this wonderful creature with his  nose. He forgot his pain. He no  longer sensed the agony of his  bruised and beaten jaws. He did not  feel the numbness of his  tightly bound and frozen legs. Every instinct  in him was centred  in these two. 
  And the woman, now, was beautiful. She UNDERSTOOD; and the gentle   heart throbbed in her bosom, forgetful of The Brute. Her eyes  glowed  with the soft radiance of stars. Into her pale cheeks came  a sweet  flush. She sat the baby down, and with the cloth and warm  water  continued to bathe Miki's head. Le Beau, had he been human,  must have  worshipped her then as she knelt there, all that was  pure and  beautiful in motherhood, an angel of mercy, radiant for a  moment in  her forgetfulness of HIM. And Le Beau DID enter&#8212;and see  her&#8212;so  quietly that for a space she did not realize his presence;  and with  him staring down on her she continued to talk and laugh  and half sob,  and the baby kicked and prattled and flung out its  little arms wildly  in the joy of these exciting moments. 
  Le Beau's thick lips drew back in an ugly leer, and he gave a   savage curse. Nanette flinched as if struck a blow. 
  &quot;Get up, you fool!&quot; he snarled. 
  She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms. Miki saw the   change, and the greenish fire returned into his eyes when he  caught  sight of Le Beau. A deep and wolfish snarl rose in his  throat. 
  Le Beau turned on Nanette. The glow and the flush had not quite   gone from her eyes and cheeks as she stood with the baby hugged up  to  her breast, and her big shining braid had fallen over her  shoulder,  glistening with a velvety fire in the light that came  through the  western window. But Le Beau saw nothing of this. 
  &quot;If you make a POOS (a house-kitten) of that dog&#8212;a thing like you   made of Minoo, the breed-bitch, I will&#8212;&quot; 
  He did not finish, but his huge hands were clinched, and there was   an ugly passion in his eyes. Nanette needed no more than that. She   understood. She had received many blows, but there was the memory  of  one that never left her, night or day. Some day, if she could  ever get  to Post Fort O' God, and had the courage, she would tell  LE FACTEUR of  that blow&#8212;how Jacques Le Beau, her husband, struck  it at the nursing  time, and her bosom was so hurt that the baby of  two years ago had  died. She would tell it, when she knew she and  the baby would be safe  from the vengeance of the Brute. And only  LE FACTEUR&#8212;the Big Man at  Post Fort O' God a hundred miles away&#8212;  was powerful enough to save  her. 
  It was well that Le Beau did not read this thought in her mind   now. With his warning he turned to Miki and dragged him out of the   cabin to a cage made of saplings in which the winter before he had   kept two live foxes. A small chain ten feet in length he fastened   around Miki's neck and then to one of the sapling bars before he   thrust his prisoner inside the door of the prison and freed him by   cutting the BABICHE thongs with a knife. 
  For several minutes after that Miki lay still while the blood made   its way slowly through his numbed and half-frozen limbs. At last  he  staggered to his feet, and then it was that Le Beau chuckled   jubilantly and turned back to the cabin. 
  And now followed many days that were days of hell and torment for   him&#8212;an unequal struggle between the power of The Brute and the   spirit of the Dog. 
  &quot;I must break you&#8212;OW! by the Christ! I WILL break you!&quot;&#8212;Le Beau   would say time and again when he came with the club and the whip.  &quot;I  will make you crawl to me&#8212;OUI, and when I say fight you will  fight!&quot; 
  It was a small cage, so small that Miki could not get away from   the reach of the club and the whip. They maddened him&#8212;for a time,   and Le Beau's ugly soul was filled with joy as Miki launched  himself  again and again at the sapling bars, tearing at them with  his teeth  and frothing blood like a wolf gone mad. For twenty  years Le Beau had  trained fighting dogs, and this was his way. So  he had done with Netah  until The Killer was mastered, and at his  call crept to him on his  belly. 
  Three times, from a window in the cabin, Nanette looked forth on   these horrible struggles between the man and the dog, and the  third  time she buried her face in her arms and sobbed; and when Le  Beau came  in and found her crying he dragged her to the window and  made her look  out again at Miki, who lay bleeding and half dead in  the cage. It was  a morning on which he started the round of his  traps, and he was  always gone until late the following day. And  never was he more than  well out of sight than Nanette would run  out and go to the cage. 
  It was then that Miki forgot The Brute. At times so beaten and   blinded that he could scarcely stand or see, he would crawl to the   bars of the cage and caress the soft hands that Nanette held in   fearlessly to him. And then, after a little, Nanette began to  bring  the baby out with her, bundled up like a little Eskimo, and  in his joy  Miki whimpered and wagged his tail and grovelled in his  worship before  these two. 
  It was in the second week of his captivity that the wonderful   thing happened. Le Beau was gone, and there was a raging blizzard   outside to which Nanette dared not expose the baby. So she went to   the cage, and with a heart that beat wildly, she unbarred the   door&#8212;and brought Miki into the cabin! If Le Beau should ever   discover what she had done&#8212;! 
  The thought made her shiver. 
  After this first time she brought him into the cabin again and   again. Once her heart stood still when Le Beau saw blood on the   floor, and his eyes shot at her suspiciously. Then she lied. 
  &quot;I cut my finger she said,&quot; and a moment later, with her back to   him, she DID cut it, and when Jacques looked at her hand he saw a   cloth about the finger, with blood-stain on it. 
  After that Nanette always watched the floor carefully. 
  More and more this cabin, with the woman and the baby in it,   became a paradise for Miki. Then came the time when Nanette dared  to  keep him in the cabin with her all night, and lying close to  the  precious cradle Miki never once took his eyes from her. It was  late  when she prepared for bed. She changed into a long, soft  robe, and  then, sitting near Miki, with her bare little feet in  the fireglow,  she took down her wonderful hair and began brushing  it. It was the  first time Miki had seen this new and marvellous  garment about her. It  fell over her shoulders and breast and  almost to the floor in a  shimmering glory, and the scent of it was  so sweet that Miki crept a  few inches nearer, and whimpered  softly. After she had done brushing  it Miki watched her as her  slim fingers plaited it into two braids;  and then, before she put  the light out, a still more curious thing  happened. She went to  her bed, made of saplings, against the wall, and  from its hiding  place under the blankets drew forth tenderly a little  ivory  Crucifix. With this in her hands she knelt upon the log floor,  and  Miki listened to her prayer. He did not know, but she was asking   God to be good to her baby&#8212;the little Nanette in the crib. 
  After that she cuddled the baby up in her arms, and put out the   light, and went to bed; and through all the hours of the night  Miki  made no sound that would waken them. 
  In the morning, when Nanette opened her eyes, she found Miki with   his head resting on the edge of the bed, close to the baby that  was  nestled against her bosom. 
  That morning, as she built the fire, something strange and   stirring in Nanette's breast made her sing. Le Beau would be away   until dark that night, and she would never dare to tell him what  she  and the baby and the dog were going to do. It was her  birthday.  Twenty-six; and it seemed to her that she had lived the  time of two  lives! And eight of those years with The Brute! But  to-day they would  celebrate, they three. All the morning the cabin  was filled with a new  spirit&#8212;a new happiness. 
  Years ago, before she had met Le Beau, the Indians away back on   the Waterfound had called Nanette &quot;Tanta Penashe&quot; (&quot;the Little  Bird&quot;)  because of the marvellous sweetness of her voice. And this  morning she  sang as she prepared the birthday feast; the sun  flooded through the  windows, and Miki whimpered happily and  thumped his tail, and the baby  cackled and crowed, and The Brute  was forgotten. In that forgetfulness  Nanette was a girl again,  sweet and beautiful as in those days when  old Jackpine, the Cree&#8212;  who was now dead&#8212;had told her that she was  born of the flowers.  The wonderful dinner was ready at last, and to  the baby's delight  Nanette induced Miki to sit on a chair at the  table. He felt  foolish there, and he looked so foolish that Nanette  laughed until  her long dark lashes were damp with tears; and then,  when Miki  slunk down from the chair, feeling his shame horribly, she  ran to  him and put her arms around him and pleaded with him until he  took  his place at the table again. 
  So the day passed until mid-afternoon, when Nanette cleared away   all signs of the celebration and locked Miki in his cage. It was   fortunate she was ahead of time, for scarcely was she done when Le   Beau came into the edge of the clearing, and with him was Durant,  his  acquaintance and rival from the edge of the Barrens farther  north.  Durant had sent his outfit on to Port O' God by an Indian,  and had  struck south and west with two dogs and a sledge to visit  a cousin for  a day or two. He was on his way to the Post when he  came upon Le Beau  on his trapline. 
  Thus much Le Beau told Nanette, and Nanette looked at Durant with   startled eyes. They were a good pair, Jacques and his guest, only   that Durant was older. She had become somewhat accustomed to the   brutality in Le Beau's face, but she thought that Durant was a   monster. He made her afraid, and she was glad when they went from  the  cabin. 
  &quot;Now I will show you the BETE that is going to kill your POOS as   easily as your lead-whelp killed that rabbit to-day, m'sieu,&quot;  exulted  Jacques. &quot;I have told you but you have not seen!&quot; 
  And he took with him the club and the whip. 
  Like a tiger fresh out of the jungles Miki responded to the club   and the whip to-day, until Durant himself stood aghast, and  exclaimed  under his breath: &quot;MON DIEU! he is a devil!&quot; 
  From the window Nanette saw what was happening, and out of her   rose a cry of anguish. Sudden as a burst of fire there arose in   her&#8212;triumphant at last and unafraid&#8212;that thing which for years  The  Brute had crushed back: her womanhood resurrected! Her soul  broken  free of its shackles! Her faith, her strength, her courage!  She turned  from the window and ran to the door, and out over the  snow to the  cage; and for the first time in her life she struck at  Le Beau, and  beat fiercely at the arm that was wielding the club. 
  &quot;You beast!&quot; she cried. &quot;I tell you, you SHALL NOT! Do you hear?   You SHALL NOT!&quot; 
  Paralyzed with amazement, The Brute stood still. Was this Nanette,   his slave? This wonderful creature with eyes that were glowing  fire  and defiance, and a look in her face that he had never seen  in any  woman's face before? NON&#8212;impossible! Hot rage rose in him,  and with a  single sweep of his powerful arm he flung her back so  that she fell to  the earth. With a wild curse he lifted the bar of  the cage door. 
  &quot;I will kill him, now; I will KILL him!&quot; he almost shrieked. &quot;And   it is YOU&#8212;YOU&#8212;you she-devil! who shall eat his heart alive! I  will  force it down your throat: I will&#8212;&quot; 
  He was dragging Miki forth by the chain. The club rose as Miki's   head came through. In another instant it would have beaten his  head  to a pulp&#8212;but Nanette was between it and the dog like a  flash, and  the blow went wild. It was with his fist that Le Beau  struck out now,  and the blow caught Nanette on the shoulder and  sent her frail body  down with a crash. The Brute sprang upon her.  His fingers gripped in  her thick, soft hair. 
  And then&#8212; 
  From Durant came a warning cry. It was too late. A lean gray   streak of vengeance and retribution, Miki was at the end of his  chain  and at Le Beau's throat. Nanette HEARD! Through dazed eyes  she SAW!  She reached out gropingly and struggled to her feet, and  looked just  once down upon the snow. Then, with a terrible cry,  she staggered  toward the cabin. 
  When Durant gathered courage to drag Le Beau out of Miki's reach   Miki made no movement to harm him. Again, perhaps, it was the   Beneficent Spirit that told him his duty was done. He went back  into  his cage, and lying there on his belly looked forth at  Durant. 
  And Durant, looking at the blood-stained snow and the dead body of   The Brute, whispered to himself again: 
  &quot;MON DIEU! he is a devil!&quot; 
  In the cabin, Nanette was upon her knees before the crucifix.
