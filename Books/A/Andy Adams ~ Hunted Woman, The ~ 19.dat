  Joanne's white lips spoke first.
  &#8220;The tunnel is closed!&#8221; she whispered.
  Her voice was strange. It was not Joanne's voice. It was unreal,  terrible, and her eyes were terrible as they looked steadily into his.  Aldous could not answer; something had thickened in his throat, and his  blood ran cold as he stared into Joanne's dead-white face and saw the  understanding in her eyes. For a space he could not move, and then, as  suddenly as it had fallen upon him, the effect of the shock passed  away.
  [Illustration: &#8220;The tunnel is closed,&#8221; she whispered.... &#8220;That means  we have just forty-five minutes to live.... Let us not lie to one  another.&#8221;]
  He smiled, and put out a hand to her.
  &#8220;A slide of rock has fallen over the mouth of the tunnel,&#8221; he said,  forcing himself to speak as if it meant little or nothing. &#8220;Hold the  lantern, Joanne, while I get busy.&#8221;
  &#8220;A slide of rock,&#8221; she repeated after him dumbly.
  She took the lantern, her eyes still looking at him in that stricken  way, and with his naked hands John Aldous set to work. Five minutes and  he knew that it was madness to continue. Hands alone could not clear  the tunnel. And yet he worked, tearing into the rock and shale like an  animal; rolling back small boulders, straining at larger ones until the  tendons of his arms seemed ready to snap and his veins to burst. For a  few minutes after that he went mad. His muscles cracked, he panted as  he fought with the rock until his hands were torn and bleeding, and  over and over again there ran through his head Blackton's last words&#8212;<I> Four o'clock this afternoon!&#8212;Four o'clock this afternoon!</I>
  Then he came to what he knew he would reach very soon, a solid wall!  Rock and shale and earth were packed as if by battering rams. For a few  moments he fought to control himself before facing Joanne. Over him  swept the grim realization that his last fight must be for her. He  steadied himself, and wiped the dust and grime from his face with his  handkerchief. For the last time he swallowed hard. His soul rose within  him almost joyously now in the face of this last great fight, and he  turned&#8212;John Aldous, the super-man. There was no trace of fear in his  face as he went to her. He was even smiling in that ghostly glow of the  lantern.
  &#8220;It is hard work, Joanne.&#8221;
  She did not seem to hear what he had said. She was looking at his  hands. She held the lantern nearer.
  &#8220;Your hands are bleeding, John!&#8221;
  It was the first time she had spoken his name like that, and he was  thrilled by the calmness of her voice, the untrembling gentleness of  her hand as it touched his hand. From his bruised and bleeding flesh  she raised her eyes to him, and they were no longer the dumb, horrified  eyes he had gazed into fifteen minutes before. In the wonder of it he  stood silent, and the moment was weighted with an appalling silence.
  It came to them both in that instant&#8212;the<I> tick-tick-tick</I> of  the watch in his pocket!
  Without taking her eyes from his face she asked:
  &#8220;What time is it. John?&#8221;
  &#8220;Joanne&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not afraid,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I was afraid this afternoon, but  I am not afraid now. What time is it, John?&#8221;
  &#8220;My God&#8212;they'll dig us out!&#8221; he cried wildly. &#8220;Joanne, you don't  think they won't dig us out, do you? Why, that's impossible! The slide  has covered the wires. They've got to dig us out! There is no  danger&#8212;none at all. Only it's chilly, and uncomfortable, and I'm  afraid you'll take cold!&#8221;
  &#8220;What time is it?&#8221; she repeated softly.
  For a moment he looked steadily at her, and his heart leaped when he  saw that she must believe him, for though her face was as white as an  ivory cross she was smiling at him&#8212;yes! she was smiling at him in that  gray and ghastly death-gloom of the cavern!
  He brought out his watch, and in the lantern-glow they looked at it.
  &#8220;A quarter after three,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By four o'clock they will be at  work&#8212;Blackton and twenty men. They will have us out in time for  supper.&#8221;
  &#8220;A quarter after three,&#8221; repeated Joanne, and the words came  steadily from her lips. &#8220;That means&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He waited.
  &#8220;<I>We have forty-five minutes in which to live!</I>&#8221; she said.
  Before he could speak she had thrust the lantern into his hand, and  had seized his other hand in both her own.
  &#8220;If there are only forty-five minutes let us not lie to one  another,&#8221; she said, and her voice was very close. &#8220;I know why you are  doing it, John Aldous. It is for me. You have done a great deal for me  in these two days in which one 'can be born, and live, and die.' But in  these last minutes I do not want you to act what I know cannot be the  truth. You know&#8212;and I know. The wires are laid to the battery rock.  There is no hope. At four o'clock&#8212;we both know what will happen. And  I&#8212;am not afraid.&#8221;
  She heard him choking for speech. In a moment he said:
  &#8220;There are other lanterns&#8212;Joanne. I saw them when I was looking for  the scarf. I will light them.&#8221;
  He found two lanterns hanging against the rock wall. He lighted  them, and the half-burned candle.
  &#8220;It is pleasanter,&#8221; she said.
  She stood in the glow of them when he turned to her, tall, and  straight, and as beautiful as an angel. Her lips were pale; the last  drop of blood had ebbed from her face; but there was something glorious  in the poise of her head, and in the wistful gentleness of her mouth  and the light in her eyes. And then, slowly, as he stood looking with a  face torn in its agony for her, she held out her arms.
  &#8220;John&#8212;John Aldous&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Joanne! Oh, my God!&#8212;Joanne!&#8221;
  She swayed as he sprang to her, but she was smiling&#8212;smiling in that  new and wonderful way as her arms reached out to him, and the words he  heard her say came low and sobbing:
  &#8220;John&#8212;John, if you want to, now&#8212;you can tell me that my hair is  beautiful!&#8221;
  And then she was in his arms, her warm, sweet body crushed close to  him, her face lifted to him, her soft hands stroking his face, and over  and over again she was speaking his name while from out of his soul  there rushed forth the mighty flood of his great love; and he held her  there, forgetful of time now, forgetful of death itself; and he kissed  her tender lips, her hair, her eyes&#8212;conscious only that in the hour of  death he had found life, that her hands were stroking his face, and  caressing his hair, and that over and over again she was whispering  sobbingly his name, and that she loved him. The pressure of her hands  against his breast at last made him free her. And now, truly, she was  glorious. For the triumph of love had overridden the despair of death,  and her face was flooded with its colour and in her eyes was its glory.
  And then, as they stood there, a step between them, there  came&#8212;almost like the benediction of a cathedral bell&#8212;the soft, low  tinkling chime of the half-hour bell in Aldous' watch!
  It struck him like a blow. Every muscle in him became like rigid  iron, and his torn hands clenched tightly at his sides.
  &#8220;Joanne&#8212;Joanne, it is impossible!&#8221; he cried huskily, and he had her  close in his arms again, even as her face was whitening in the  lantern-glow. &#8220;I have lived for you, I have waited for you&#8212;all these  years you have been coming, coming, coming to me&#8212;and now that you are  mine&#8212;<I>mine</I>&#8212;it is impossible! It cannot happen&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He freed her again, and caught up a lantern. Foot by foot he  examined the packed tunnel. It was solid&#8212;not a crevice or a break  through which might have travelled the sound of his voice or the  explosion of a gun. He did not shout. He knew that it would be  hopeless, and that his voice would be terrifying in that sepulchral  tomb. Was it possible that there might be some other opening&#8212;a  possible exit&#8212;in that mountain wall? With the lantern in his hand he  searched. There was no break. He came back to Joanne. She was standing  where he had left her. And suddenly, as he looked at her, all fear went  out of him, and he put down the lantern and went to her.
  &#8220;Joanne,&#8221; he whispered, holding her two hands against his breast,  &#8220;you are not afraid?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I am not afraid.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you know&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; and she leaned forward so that her head lay partly  against their clasped hands and partly upon his breast.
  &#8220;And you love me, Joanne?&#8221;
  &#8220;As I never dreamed that I should love a man, John Aldous,&#8221; she  whispered.
  &#8220;And yet it has been but two days&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;And I have lived an eternity,&#8221; he heard her lips speak softly.
  &#8220;You would be my wife?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;To-morrow?&#8221;
  &#8220;If you wanted me then, John.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thank God,&#8221; he breathed in her hair. &#8220;And you would come to me  without reservation, Joanne, trusting me, believing in me&#8212;you would  come to me body, and heart, and soul?&#8221;
  &#8220;In all those ways&#8212;yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thank God,&#8221; he breathed again.
  He raised her face. He looked deep into her eyes, and the glory of  her love grew in them, and her lips trembled as she lifted them ever so  little for him to kiss.
  &#8220;Oh, I was happy&#8212;so happy,&#8221; she whispered, putting her hands to his  face. &#8220;John, I knew that you loved me, and oh! I was fighting so hard  to keep myself from letting you know how happy it made me. And here, I  was afraid you wouldn't tell me&#8212;before it happened. And  John&#8212;John&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  She leaned back from him, and her white hands moved like swift  shadows in her hair, and then, suddenly, it billowed about her&#8212;her  glorious hair&#8212;covering her from crown to hip; and with her hands she  swept and piled the lustrous masses of it over him until his face, and  head, and shoulders were buried in the flaming sheen and sweet perfume  of it.
  He strained her closer. Through the warm richness of her tresses his  lips pressed her lips, and they ceased to breathe. And up to their  ears, pounding through that enveloping shroud of her hair came the<I>  tick-tick-tick</I> of the watch in his pocket.
  &#8220;Joanne,&#8221; he whispered.
  &#8220;Yes, John.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are not afraid of&#8212;death?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, not when you are holding me like this, John.&#8221;
  He still clasped her hands, and a sweet smile crept over her lips.
  &#8220;Even now you are splendid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, I would have you that  way, my John!&#8221;
  Again they stood up in the unsteady glow of the lanterns.
  &#8220;What time is it?&#8221; she asked.
  He drew out his watch, and as they both looked his blood ran cold.
  &#8220;Twelve minutes,&#8221; she murmured, and there was not a quiver in her  voice. &#8220;Let us sit down, John&#8212;you on this box, and I on the floor, at  your feet&#8212;like this.&#8221;
  He seated himself on the box, and Joanne nestled herself at his  knees, her hands clasped in his.
  &#8220;I think, John,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;that very, very often we would  have visited like this&#8212;you and I&#8212;in the evening.&#8221;
  A lump choked him, and he could not answer.
  &#8220;I would very often have come and perched myself at your feet like  this.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, yes, my beloved.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you would always have told me how beautiful my hair  was&#8212;always. You would not have forgotten that, John&#8212;or have grown  tired?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, no&#8212;never!&#8221;
  His arms were about her. He was drawing her closer.
  &#8220;And we would have had beautiful times together, John&#8212;writing, and  going adventuring, and&#8212;and&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He felt her trembling, throbbing, and her arms tightened about him.
  And now, again up through the smother of her hair, came the<I>  tick-tick-tick</I> of his watch.
  He felt her fumbling at his watch pocket, and in a moment she was  holding the timepiece between them, so that the light of the lantern  fell on the face of it.
  &#8220;It is three minutes of four, John.&#8221;
  The watch slipped from her fingers, and now she drew herself up so  that her arms were about his neck, and their faces touched.
  &#8220;Dear John, you love me?&#8221;
  &#8220;So much that even now, in the face of death, I am happy,&#8221; he  whispered. &#8220;Joanne, sweetheart, we are not going to be separated. We  are going&#8212;together. Through all eternity it must be like this&#8212;you and  I, together. Little girl, wind your hair about me&#8212;tight!&#8221;
  &#8220;There&#8212;and there&#8212;and there, John! I have tied you to me, and you  are buried in it! Kiss me, John&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  And then the wild and terrible fear of a great loneliness swept  through him. For Joanne's voice had died away in a whispering breath,  and the lips he kissed did not kiss him back, and her body lay heavy,  heavy, heavy in his arms. Yet in his loneliness he thanked God for  bringing her oblivion in these last moments, and with his face crushed  to hers he waited. For he knew that it was no longer a matter of  minutes, but of seconds, and in those seconds he prayed, until up  through the warm smother of her hair&#8212;with the clearness of a tolling  bell&#8212;came the sound of the little gong in his watch striking the Hour  of Four!
  In space other worlds might have crumbled into ruin; on earth the  stories of empires might have been written and the lives of men grown  old in those first century-long seconds in which John Aldous held his  breath and waited after the chiming of the hour-bell in the watch on  the cavern floor. How long he waited he did not know; how closely he  was crushing Joanne to his breast he did not realize. Seconds, minutes,  and other minutes&#8212;and his brain ran red in dumb, silent madness. And  the watch! It<I> ticked, ticked, ticked!</I> It was like a hammer.
  He had heard the sound of it first coming up through her hair. But  it was not in her hair now. It was over him, about him&#8212;it was no  longer a ticking, but a throb, a steady, jarring, beating throb. It  grew louder, and the air stirred with it. He lifted his head. With the  eyes of a madman he stared&#8212;and listened. His arms relaxed from about  Joanne, and she slipped crumpled and lifeless to the floor. He  stared&#8212;and that steady<I> beat-beat-beat</I>&#8212;a hundred times louder  than the ticking of a watch&#8212;pounded in his brain. Was he mad? He  staggered to the choked mouth of the tunnel, and then there fell shout  upon shout, and shriek upon shriek from his lips, and twice, like a  madman now, he ran back to Joanne and caught her up in his arms,  calling and sobbing her name, and then shouting&#8212;and calling her name  again. She moved; her eyes opened, and like one gazing upon the spirit  of the dead she looked into the face of John Aldous, a madman's face in  the lantern-glow.
  &#8220;John&#8212;John&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  She put up her hands, and with a cry he ran with her in his arms to  the choked tunnel.
  &#8220;Listen! Listen!&#8221; he cried wildly. &#8220;Dear God in Heaven, Joanne&#8212;can  you not hear them? It's Blackton&#8212;Blackton and his men! Hear&#8212;hear the  rock-hammers smashing! Joanne&#8212;Joanne&#8212;we are saved!&#8221;
  She did not sense him. She swayed, half on her feet, half in his  arms, as consciousness and reason returned to her. Dazedly her hands  went to his face in their old, sweet way. Aldous saw her struggling to  understand&#8212;to comprehend; and he kissed her soft upturned lips,  fighting back the excitement that made him want to raise his voice  again in wild and joyous shouting.
  &#8220;It is Blackton!&#8221; he said over and over again. &#8220;It is Blackton and  his men! Listen!&#8212;you can hear their picks and the pounding of their  rock-hammers!&#8221;
