  It was with very little confidence in his ultimate success that   Herbert set out on his borrowing expedition. The number of those who   could be called capitalists in a small village like Wrayburn was very   small, and it happened very remarkably that all of them were short of   funds. One man had just bought a yoke of oxen, and so spent all his   available cash; another had been shingling his barn; and still another   confessed to having money, but it was in the savings bank, and he   didn't like to disturb it. 
  So, at supper time, Herbert came in, depressed and dispirited. 
  &#8220;Well, mother, it's no use,&#8221; he said, as her anxious look met his. 
  &#8220;I didn't much think you could borrow the money,&#8221; she answered,  trying  to look cheerful. 
  &#8220;There's only one thing remains to be done,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;To try to induce the squire to give us more time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think he will do that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nor I. In that case we must come to his terms; but it's a pity to   sacrifice the property, mother.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, Herbert; I shall be sorry to leave the old place,&#8221; she  sighed.  &#8220;You were born here, and your father was always very much  attached to  it. But poor folks can't have everything they wish, and it  might be  worse.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, it might be worse, and if the squire was not so bent in  getting  the place into his hands, it might be better.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose we ought not to blame him for looking out for his own   interest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, we ought; when it seems that he is ready to injure his poorer   neighbors.&#8221; 
  Mrs. Carter did not reply. She did not wish further to incense her  son  against the squire, yet in her heart she could not help agreeing  with  him. 
  The next day Herbert did not go to work as usual. He did not feel  like  it, while matters were in such uncertainty. He knew the squire  would  be at the cottage a little before twelve o'clock, and he wanted  to be  with his mother at that time, for he felt that, if the place  must be  sold, he would be more likely to get good terms for it than  his  mother, who was of an easy and yielding disposition. 
  He took a little walk in the course of the forenoon, not with any   particular object in view, but in order to pass the time. As he was   passing the hotel&#8212;for there was a small hotel in the village&#8212;he   heard his name called. Turning round, he found that it was the   landlord who had called him. 
  &#8220;Come here a minute, Herbert,&#8221; he said. 
  Herbert obeyed the summons. 
  &#8220;What are you doing nowadays?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;I have turned farmer,&#8221; said our hero. 
  &#8220;Whom are you working for?&#8221; 
  &#8220;For myself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How is that? I don't understand.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am cultivating Mr. Crane's land on shares.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Does it take up all jour time?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No; I would only work part of the day if I had anything else to  do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll tell you what I have been thinking of. There's a young man   boarding with me from the city, a Mr. Cameron. He was a college   student, but his eyes gave out, and the doctor sent him out of the   city to get well. He wants some one to read to him part of the time,   and go about with him for company. He is from a rich family&#8212;the son   of a wealthy manufacturer&#8212;and he will be willing to pay a fair   price.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you think I would suit him?&#8221; asked Herbert, eagerly. 
  &#8220;Yes, I think you would. You are a good scholar, and when I  mentioned  you to him, he said he would like to see you. He said he  would prefer  a boy, as he would be more ready to adapt himself to his  wishes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;When can I see Mr. Cameron?&#8221; asked our hero. 
  &#8220;Come in now. You will find him in his room. Here, John, show  Herbert  up to number six.&#8221; 
  Herbert was ushered into one of the best rooms the hotel afforded.  A  young man, of pleasant appearance, was sitting at the window, with a   green shade over his eyes. He pushed up this, that he might see   Herbert. 
  &#8220;This is Herbert Carter, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said John, unceremoniously. 
  &#8220;I am glad to see you, Herbert,&#8221; said the young man, smiling as he   extended his hand. He was secretly pleased with Herbert's open and   manly face. &#8220;Did the landlord say why I might need your assistance?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He said your eyes were affected.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, they broke down a month since. I am a student of Yale  College,  in the junior class. I suppose I tasked my eyes too severely.  At any  rate, they gave out, and I am forbidden to use them at all.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That must be a great loss to you,&#8221; said Herbert, with sympathy. 
  &#8220;It is. I am very fond of reading and study, and the time passes  very  heavily in the absence of my usual employment.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know what I should do if I could not use my eyes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You would find it a great hardship. Now I must tell you why I came   here. The doctor told me I should be better off in the country than in   the city. He said that the sight of the green grass would be good for   me, and the fresh air, in improving my general health, would help my   eyes also. I hadn't much choice as to a place, but some one mentioned   Wrayburn, and so I came here. But I soon found that, unless I got some   pleasant company and some one who could read to me, I should die of   weariness. That brings me to my object in asking you to call upon me.   How is your time occupied?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have taken an acre of land to cultivate on shares,&#8221; answered   Herbert. &#8220;It was because I could find nothing else to do, and must do   something.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Does that keep you pretty busy?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is planting time now, but I could get along with working there   half a day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And could you place yourself at my disposal the other half?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should be glad to do it,&#8221; answered Herbert. 
  &#8220;Suppose, then, that you work in the field in the forenoon, and  give  me every afternoon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All right,&#8221; said Herbert, promptly. 
  &#8220;Now comes another question. What pay would you expect for giving  me  so much of your time?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shouldn't know what to charge, Mr. Cameron. I leave that matter   entirely with you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Would you be satisfied with five dollars a week?&#8221; 
  Five dollars a week! Herbert could hardly believe his ears. Why, he   would have been well paid if this had been given him for the whole of   his time, but for half it seemed munificent. 
  &#8220;I am afraid I can't earn that much,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I would be  willing  to take less.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You don't know how hard I shall make you work&#8221; said the young man,   smiling. &#8220;I insist upon paying you five dollars a week.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't seriously object,&#8221; said Herbert, smiling; but if you  think,  after the first week, that it is too much, you can pay me  less.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I see that we are not likely to quarrel on the subject of salary,   then. When can you begin?&#8221; 
  &#8220;This afternoon, if you wish.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I do wish it, otherwise the afternoon would pass very slowly to  me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then, I will be here at one o'clock.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Half past one will do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I will be on hand. Till then I will bid you good morning, as I  shall  be wanted at home.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well, Herbert.&#8221; 
  Herbert left the room and hurried home, for it was nearly twelve.  On  the way he stopped at the post office, and found a letter addressed  to  his mother. He did not recognize the handwriting, nor, such was his   hurry, did he notice where it was postmarked. He had no watch, but   thought it must be close upon twelve o'clock. So he thrust the letter   into his pocket, and continued his way homeward on a half run. He was   in time, for, just as he reached the front gate from one direction,   the squire reached it from the other. 
  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said the squire, a little stiffly. &#8220;Is your mother  at  home?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I presume she is. Won't you come in?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wonder if they've got the money ready,&#8221; thought the squire, as  he  followed Herbert into the modest sitting room.
