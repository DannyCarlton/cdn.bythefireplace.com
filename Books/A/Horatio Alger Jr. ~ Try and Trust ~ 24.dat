  It was certainly a startling discovery for Herbert to make, that  out of  sixty dollars he had only four left, now that he had paid for  another  day at the hotel, and this small sum must be further  diminished by the  expense of a breakfast. Unfortunately, too, he was  quite hungry, for his  misfortune had not taken away his appetite. 
  &quot;I will make a good breakfast, at any rate,&quot; said Herbert,   philosophically. &quot;Afterwards, I will consider what to do.&quot; 
  He ordered a substantial breakfast, which, even at the low prices  of a  dozen years ago, amounted to fifty cents, and did full justice to  what  was set before him. 
  After paying at the desk, he went outside. 
  It was a bright, sunshiny morning, and this, with the comfortable   feeling produced by having eaten a good breakfast, gave him courage  for  the new career upon which he was about to enter. 
  While considering what he should do first, the thought of the  letter  given him by Mr. Carroll flashed upon him. He felt for it  hastily, and  was rejoiced to find that that was safe, at least.  Greenleaf had not  taken that away, fortunately. 
  He looked at the direction. It was addressed to 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Messrs. Godfrey Lynn, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  No. &#8212;&#8212; Pearl St.&quot; 
  It was not sealed, and was probably meant to be read by Herbert. At  any  rate, our hero so concluded, and opened the letter, not without   curiosity as to what Mr. Carroll had written about him. He knew it  must  be favorable, of course, but found it even more so than he  anticipated. 
  Here it is: 
  &quot;MY DEAR MR. GODFREY: This letter will be handed you by a young  friend  of mine, by name Herbert Mason. My acquaintance with him has  been brief,  but he has been able, by his coolness and bravery, to do  me a most  important service, having saved me from being robbed of a  large sum of  money while acting as my escort from Ohio to  Philadelphia. I have talked  with him freely about his plans, and find  that he will reach New York  without friends, and with a very small sum  of money, hoping before it is  gone to secure a place in some  counting-room, where he can make an  honest living. I feel a strong  interest in his success, and am persuaded  that wherever he is placed,  he will show rare capacity and fidelity. I  wish it might be in your  power to receive him into your own counting-  room. But, of course,  that must be according to your convenience. At any  rate, may I rely on  you to act a friendly part by my young friend, and  to exert your  influence toward procuring him a position elsewhere, if  you cannot  employ him yourself? Anything that you may have it in your  power to do  for Herbert, I shall consider as a favor done to myself. 
  I have just left my daughter, who, with her family, is well.  Sincerely,  your friend, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  JAMES CARROLL.&quot; 
  &quot;That is a very kind letter,&quot; thought Herbert, gratefully. &quot;I hope  it  will do me good.&quot; 
  He decided to call and deliver it the same forenoon. If he had not  been  robbed of nearly the whole of his small capital, he would, first,  have  gone about the city, which was entirely new to him. But, with  less than  four dollars between himself and utter destitution, he felt  that he had  no time for sight-seeing. It was necessary that he should  get to work as  soon as possible. 
  He waited till ten o'clock, thinking it possible that the heads of  the  firm might not reach the counting-room till about that time. It  was now  eight o'clock only. He had two hours, therefore, to look about  him. 
  &quot;Shine yer boots?&quot; said a ragged urchin, approaching, with a  suggestive  look at his soiled shoes. 
  It occurred to Herbert that it would be best to look as well as  possible  when visiting Godfrey. 
  &quot;Ten cents.&quot; 
  &quot;It's too much,&quot; said Herbert, thinking how few dimes constituted  his  entire worldly wealth. 
  &quot;Well, five, then,&quot; said the bootblack, coming down to his regular   price. 
  &quot;Do you get much to do?&quot; asked our hero. 
  &quot;Some days I get considerable.&quot; 
  &quot;How much do you make?&quot; 
  &quot;Pleasant days I makes a dollar, but when it rains, there ain't  much to  do.&quot; 
  &quot;How much do you have to pay for sleeping?&quot; 
  &quot;Six cents.&quot; 
  &quot;Six cents!&quot; repeated Herbert, in surprise. &quot;Where can you get  lodged  for that?&quot; 
  &quot;At the lodgin' house, corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets.&quot; 
  &quot;Well,&quot; thought Herbert, &quot;I needn't starve. If I can't get anything   better to do, I can buy a box of blacking and a brush, and set up in   business for myself.&quot; 
  To be sure, this would not be an agreeable occupation, but Herbert  was  bound to make a living by honest labor. If one avenue was closed  to him,  he must enter such as were open to him. He could not afford to  be  particular. 
  After his shoes were brushed, he crossed the park, and walked up   Broadway. It was a wonderful sight to the country-bred boy, this gay   thoroughfare, with its busy and bustling crowds, and its throngs of   vehicles, never ceasing wholly, save at the dead hours of night. He   thought to himself what a quantity of business there must be to do.   Certainly, there must be room for one more worker. So, on the whole,  the  busy scene gave him courage, and he sauntered along as cheerfully  as if  he were not next-door to a beggar. 
  But at last the time came when he might safely seek out the  gentleman to  whom he had an introduction. Being a stranger in the  city, he had to  inquire for Pearl Street from a policeman, who  answered his inquiry very  civilly. He followed the direction, and  found it at length. But the  number of which he was in search was not  so easily found, for he found  the street meandered in a very  perplexing way, so that at times he was  not quite sure whether he was  still in it, or had wandered from his way. 
  At last he found the place. It was a large, solid-looking building,  of  four stories in height. There were a number of boxes outside on the   sidewalk. Inside, there was a large apartment occupying the entire  first  floor, with the exception of a room in the rear, which had been   partitioned off for a counting-room. The partition was of glass, and,  as  he looked from the entrance, he could see a couple of high desks  and a  table. 
  &quot;Is this Godfrey Lynn's?&quot; he asked of a porter at the entrance. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the porter. 
  &quot;I want to see Mr. Godfrey.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think he's in. You can go to the office and inquire.&quot; 
  Accordingly, Herbert passed down the length of the warehouse, and,   pausing a moment before the door, he opened it, and entered. 
  There were two persons in the office. One was a thin-faced man, who  sat  on a high stool at one of the desks, making entries apparently in  the  ledger. This was the bookkeeper, Mr. Pratt, a man with a  melancholy  face, who looked as if he had lived to see the vanity of  all things  earthly. He had a high forehead naturally&#8212;made still  higher by the loss  of his front hair. Apparently, he was not a man to  enjoy conviviality,  or to shine on any festive occasion. 
  Besides Mr. Pratt, there was a boy, if we may take the liberty of   calling him such, of about Herbert's age. He was fashionably dressed,   and his hair was arranged with exceeding care. In fact, as Herbert   entered, he was examining the set of his necktie in a little  hand-glass,  which he had taken from his coat pocket. Not quite suiting  him, he set  himself to rearranging it. 
  &quot;Have you copied that bill, Thomas?&quot; asked Mr. Pratt, looking up. 
  &quot;Not yet, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;You have been long enough about it. Put back that glass. You are  quite  too much troubled about your appearance.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir. 
  &quot;If I didn't look any better than some people,&quot; said Thomas, sotto  voce,  &quot;I shouldn't look in a glass very often.&quot; 
  Herbert naturally concluded that Mr. Pratt was the man to whom his   inquiries should be addressed. 
  &quot;I would like to see Mr. Godfrey, sir.&quot; he said. 
  &quot;He is out of the city.&quot; 
  &quot;Out of the city!&quot; repeated Herbert, disappointed. &quot;When will he be   back?&quot; 
  &quot;Nor till day after to-morrow.&quot; 
  Herbert's countenance fell. In his reduced circumstances, he could   hardly afford to wait two days. At his present rate of expenditure, he   would be penniless by that time. 
  &quot;Is Mr. Lynn likely to be in soon?&quot; he asked, thinking that perhaps  he  would do in Mr. Godfrey's absence. 
  &quot;No; he is sick at home. He may not be here for a week. Perhaps, I  can  attend to your business,&quot; he added. &quot;What is it?&quot; 
  &quot;I think,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;that I will wait till day after  to-morrow, if  you think Mr. Godfrey will be back then. I have a letter  for him.&quot; 
  &quot;If it's a business letter, you had better leave it.&quot; 
  &quot;It is a letter of introduction,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I would rather  present  it in person.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well,&quot; and Mr. Pratt went back to his ledger. 
  Thomas looked critically at the boy who had a letter of  introduction to  Mr. Godfrey, and said to himself, &quot;He got his clothes  from a country  tailor, I'll bet a hat.&quot;
