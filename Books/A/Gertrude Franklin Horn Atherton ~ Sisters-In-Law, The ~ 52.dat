<b>I</b>    
One day at the Hotel Crillon she thought she had found him.    
She had passed the portals of that fortress with some delay, for the  American Commission protected itself as if it dwelt under the shadow of  imminent assassination and theft; whereas it was merely exclusive. The  sentries at the door demanded her permit, and passed her in with intense  suspicion to the inner guard. This was composed of three polite but very  young lieutenants in smart new uniforms with no blight of war on them, and  flagrantly of the American aristocracy.    
With these she had less trouble, for they recognized her social status and  accepted her explanation that she had been invited for tea with one of the  ladies of the Commission. Nevertheless, they knew their duty and Alexina  was followed up to the door of her hostess' suite by another young guardian  who watched her entrance through the sacred door as carefully as if he  suspected her of carrying a bomb in her muff.

The party numbered about thirty, and Alexina, after chatting with the few  she knew, was standing apart by a small table drinking a cup of tea  with three lumps of sugar in it and consuming cakes like a greedy  boarding-school girl home for the holidays, when she caught sight of a  man in the British khaki, a major by his insignia, a tall man, thin and  straight, standing with his back to her at the opposite end of the room. He  was talking to the host and a small group of men. She glimpsed something  like half of his profile when he turned from the host for a moment. Like  all men in khaki, when not pronounced brunettes, his complexion and hair  looked the same color as his uniform.    
Nevertheless...if she could only see his eyes...he turned his full  profile...she had never glanced at Gathbroke's profile; he had given her no  opportunity!...Certainly she had not the faintest idea whether the man of  the embassy had had a snub nose or the thin straight feature of this man  who would have attracted her attention in any ease if only because he did  not carry his shoulders with the disillusioning obliquity of the British  Army...why did he not turn round? Alexina felt an impulse to throw her cup  straight across the room at the back of that well-shaped head.    
Suddenly he shook hands with his host, nodded to the others and left the  room.    
<b>III</b>    
Alexina set her cup and saucer down on the table, forebore to interrupt her  hostess, who was known to talk steadily in order to avoid questions, and  walked quickly and deliberately out after him. It is a primitive instinct  in woman to chase the male; but civilization having initiated her into the  art of permitting him to chase her, Alexina was merely bent upon giving  this man his chance if the interest had been mutual and existed beyond the  moment.    
One lift was descending as she reached the outer corridor and the other  was closed. She ran down the wide staircase as rapidly as a woman in  fashionable skirts may. There was no British uniform in the hall below.

She stood for a quarter of an hour under the arcade before the Crillon  waiting for a taxi, staring out into the dreary mist of rain, at the round  soft blurs of light in the Place de la Concorde, but in no wise depressed.  What did it matter if she had not met him to-day? The conviction that she  should meet him before long was as strong as if she were ever hopeful  sixteen....That was the real secret of her elation. She felt very young and  entirely carefree. She reflected that if she had met Gathbroke, or whoever  he might be, during the last three years of the war she would have felt  neither joy nor elation, however interested she might have been. To love  and dream and enjoy when men were falling every minute, writhing in agony,  gasping out their life, would have seemed to her grossly unaesthetic if  nothing worse. It was not in the picture. The primal impulses she had  experienced at the front to that harsh music of Death's orchestra were  natural enough; but safe (comparatively!) in Paris, certainly quiet, the  romance of love would have been as incongruous and heartless as to go out  to the great hospital at Neuilly and tango through a ward of dying men.    
But now! She had done her part. She could do no more. Men still must die,  but in every comfort, with every consolation. And there would be no more  recruits.    
She was free. She was young, young, young again.    
And at this moment her heart emptied itself of song and sank like lead  in her breast. She pressed her muff against her face to hide the sudden  grimace she was sure contorted it; there had been few moments in her life  when she had not been mistress of her features, but this was one of them.    
Gora Dwight was walking rapidly toward her.
