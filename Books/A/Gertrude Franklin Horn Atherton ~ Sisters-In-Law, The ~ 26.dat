Mr. Kirkpatrick realized his ambition to see with his own sharp puncturing  little eyes (Aileen said they reminded her of a sewing-machine needle  playing staccato) several of the most flagrant examples of capitalistic  extravagance where parasitic femalehood idled away their useless lives  and servitors battened. In other words the extremely comfortable or the  shamelessly luxurious homes built for the most part by still active  business men whose first real period of rest would be in a small stone  residence in a certain silent city Down the Peninsula.    
Several were already occupied by their widows. In a climate where a man can  work three hundred and sixty-five days of the year the temptation to do so  is strong, and not conducive to longevity.    
The Ferdinand Thorntons, Trennahans, Hofers and others who had lost their  city homes on Nob Hill had not rebuilt, but lived the year round in their  country houses at Burlingame, San Mateo, Alta, Menlo Park, Atherton, or  "across the Bay," using the hotels when they came to town for dances, but  motoring home after the theater.    
Fortunately the finest and all of the newest mansions had been built in the  Western Addition and escaped the fire. Sibyl Bascom's father-in-law had  erected, shortly before his death, a large square granite palace more or  less in the Italian style, and as his widow preferred to live in Santa  Barbara, Frank Bascom had taken it over for himself and his bride.    
Olive had carried her millions to France and found her marquis. (As he  was wealthy himself they contributed little to the current gossip of San  Francisco.)    
Janet Maynard lived with her mother, another widow of unrestricted means,  in a large low Spanish house with a patio, built by a famous local  architect with such success that Rex Roberts when he married Polly Luning,  had bought the nearest vacant lot and ordered a romantic mansion as nearly  like that of his wife's intimate friend as possible. He would live in it as  soon as the idiosyncrasies of The Architect and Labor would permit,    
Mrs. Clement Hunter had another pale gray stone palace, supported in front  by noble pillars and commanding a superb view of the Bay, the Golden Gate,  and Mount Tamalpais.    
Aileen and her father lived in an old wooden house with a modern facade of  stucco, and surrounded by a garden filled with somewhat blighted  geraniums, fuchsias, sweet alicias, heliotrope, mignonette, and other  nineteenth-century posies beloved of Mrs. Lawton in her romantic and  innocent youth.    
Sibyl and Alice Thorndyke's father had left his girls a square bow-windowed  mansard-roofed double house, built in eighteen-seventy-eight, and  unreclaimed. With it went a moderate income, and Alice lived on under the  ugly old roof chaperoned by an aunt, who had been chosen from a liberal  assortment of relatives because she was almost deaf, quite myopic, and so  terrified of draughts that her absence when convenient could always be  counted on.

All of these young women belonged to Alexina's personal set, and joined the  class in socialism, as they joined anything the stronger spirits among  them suggested; and they attended as regularly as could be expected of  "parasites" who were mainly interested in society, dress, poker, and some  absorbing creature of the other sex.    
Mr. Kirkpatrick hated them all with the exception of Alexina, Aileen, Mrs.  Price Ruyler, the half-French wife of a New Yorker, recently adopted by  California, and Mrs. Hunter, who had joined out of curiosity, having read a  certain amount of socialism, but never met a socialist.    
She confided to Mrs. Thornton that she was not acutely anxious to meet  another, and Mrs. Thornton replied tartly:    
"What do you want to belong to such a class for? It's rank hyprocrisy to  pretend interest in a question we all hate the very name of, and to give  the creature money that he no doubt turns over to the 'cause' with his  tongue in his cheek. I'd never give one of them the satisfaction of knowing  that I recognized his existence."    
Said Maria Abbott firmly: "Exactly. We should ignore them, just as we  ignore envious and spiteful and ill-bred outsiders of any sort."    
"But we may not be able to ignore them," said Mrs. Hunter. "Their  organization is the best of any party even if their numbers are not  overwhelming. If they are content to advance slowly and by purely political  methods there is no knowing who will own this or any government fifty years  hence. For my part I'd rather they all turn raging anarchists; then we  could turn machine guns on them and clean 'em out. I hate them, for I was  too long getting where I am now, and I want to stay. But I don't make the  mistake of ignoring them, and I rather like having a squint at them at  close quarters. Kirkpatrick has taken us to several socialist meetings...we  borrow the servants' coats and mutilate our oldest hats....Socialism seems  to me rather more endurable than the socialists, and of these Kirkpatrick  is about the sanest I have heard. They rant and froth, contradict  themselves and one another, wander from the point and never get  anywhere....That would give me hope if it were not for the fact that poor  California is a magnet for the cranks of every fad as well as for the  riff-raff and derelicts....My other hope is that even they--that is to say  the least unbalanced of them--will come in time to realize that socialism  is economically unsound--"    
"Do you mean to say," cried Mrs. Abbott, "that Alexina has gone to  socialist meetings?"    
"Rather. She's very keen--"    
"Believes in it?"    
"Rather not. But she is naturally thorough--has a really extraordinary  tendency, for a San Franciscan of her sex and status, to finish anything  she has begun. Sometimes when she is arguing with Kirkpatrick she sticks  out that chin of hers so far that you notice how square it is. She has him  pretty well tamed though. When he is ready to eat the rest of us alive she  can smooth him down like a regular lion tamer."    
"Well, you're nothing but a lot of parlor socialists," said Mrs. Thornton  disgustedly. "And just as ridiculous as any other hybrids. But I'm relieved  that it hasn't spoiled your taste for the simpler pleasures of life. Maria,  as you don't play poker we'll have a game of bridge, Ladie, ring for  cocktails, will you--or would you rather have a gin fizz? Don't look so  horrified, Maria. We're better than socialists, anyhow; if they did win  out you'd have farther to fall than we, for you're a moss-backed old  conservative who hates change of any sort, while we not only love change of  all sorts but are regular anarchists: do as we please and snap our fingers  at the world. Here we are."    
The three were in Mrs. Thornton's Moorish palace half way between San Mateo  and Burlingame, a situation that symbolized the connecting bridge between  the old and new order for Mrs. Abbott. Mrs. Thornton was a lineal  descendant of the Rincon Hill of the sixties and had made her debut with  Maria Groome in the eighties. But she had married an immoderately rich man  and had a barbaric taste for splendor that formed the proper setting for  her own somewhat barbaric beauty, and imperious temper. Her dark and  splendid beauty was waning, for in the matter of giving aid to nature with  secrecy or with art she was faithful to the old tradition. But she was  always an imposing figure and as close to being the first power in San  Francisco society as that happy-go-lucky independent class would ever  tolerate.    
<b>III</b>    
Kirkpatrick liked Mrs. Hunter, regarding her as "an honest plain-spoken  dame without any frills." This estimate applied not only to her temperament  but to her costumes. He admired her severe tailored suits (although he  sensed their cost) and her smart, plain, hard, little hats.    
The "frills and furbelows" of the younger "spenders" irritated the group of  nerves appropriated by his class-consciousness almost beyond endurance; but  he managed to stand it by reminding himself that irritation of all such was  a healthy sign and vastly preferable to insidious tolerance.    
Mrs. Hunter was also as regular in her attendance as Mrs. Dwight, Miss  Lawton and Mrs. Price Ruyler, and asked fairly intelligent questions. The  others floated in and out, and one by one dropped from the class, until  toward the middle of the second winter none remained but Alexina, Aileen,  Mrs. Hunter and Helene Ruyler, who, like Aileen, found in the "frantic  interest" of the materialistic creed which antagonized every instinct in  them, a distraction from the excessive gambling which had threatened to  wreck their nerves, purses, and peace of mind. They confided this artlessly  to Mr. Kirkpatrick, who replied dryly that they were the best argument he  had in stock.    
But if the major part of his fashionable class deserted him in due course  he had meanwhile seen the inside of their homes; and in each case, Alexina,  who divined his interest, arranged to have him shown over the house from  the kitchens and pantries straight up to the servants' quarters.    
These he found unexpectedly comfortable and complete. In fact, they were so  much more modern and adorned than the little cottage in the Mission where  he lived with his mother that he longed for the immediate installation of a  system that would teach these workers what real work was. What enraged him  further was their "airs." They too obviously looked upon him as an alien  intruder, whereas their mistresses, until socialism bored them, were, for  the most part, as charmingly courteous as his one reliable friend, Mrs.  Mortimer Dwight.    
<b>IV</b>    
During the first winter and spring while his pupils were still fairly  regular in their attendance, he was both incensed and grimly amused by  their various idiosyncrasies. He soon became accustomed to their vanity  boxes and their public application of powder and lip stick, the frank  crossing of their knees that exhibited more diaphanous silk than he had  ever seen in his life before, the polite excitement that any new article  of attire worn by one seemed to induce in all, the wicked but on the whole  good-natured baiting of Aileen Lawton and Polly Roberts, the alternate  insolence and Circean glances of Mrs. Bascom, who amused herself  "practicing on him," and the constant smoking of most of them.    
But what he could neither understand nor accept was their attitude toward  one another. They would all rush at the hostess of the day as they entered,  or at late comers, with the excited enthusiasm of loved and loving  intimates who had not met for months; and Kirkpatrick, who missed nothing,  knew that they met once a day if not oftener.    
In spite of their intimacy their warm enraptured greetings carried a patent  measure of admiration and even respect. It was always at least fifteen  minutes before they would settle down for "work" and meanwhile they  chattered about their common interests, but always with the air of relating  long-delayed information and a frank desire to give of their best. He could  have understood "gush," and sentimentalism, but this attitude of which he  had neither heard nor read bothered him until one day he had a sudden,  flash of enlightenment.    
<b>V</b>    
"Is it class-consciousness?"    
He asked the question of Gora, who dropped in upon a class at Alexina's or  Aileen's sometimes on a free afternoon, and with whom he was walking down  to the trolley car.    
"Something like that. Caste they would call it if they thought about it at  all, which to do them justice they don't....It used to be the fashion  in San Francisco for everybody to 'knock' everybody else. Then came a  revulsion and everybody began to praise and boost. You see it in all  circles, but the way it has taken that crowd is to show their intense  loyalty to one another by a constant reminder of it in manner, and in  refraining from criticism of one another, no matter how much they may  gossip about others outside of their particular set. Once, just to try my  sister-in-law, I told her that in my nursing I had stumbled across evidence  of an illicit love affair going on between one of her friends and a married  man, the husband of my patient. My sister became so remote that I had the  impression for a few moments that she really wasn't there. Once it would  have infuriated me, but I have improved my sense of humor and developed my  philosophy, so I merely turned the conversation, as she wouldn't speak at  all. She had quite withdrawn--still further into the sacred preserves, I  suppose....    
"They are not only loyal but really seem to have the most exalted  admiration for one another because they are all of the same heaven-born  stock....That is not all, however. The truth of the matter is that they get  so bored out here they would go frantic if they did not cultivate as many  kinds of excitement and indigenous admirations as their wits are equal to.  When they can, they vary the monotony of life with summers in Europe and  winters in New York--or Santa Barbara, where they meet many interesting  people from the East or England; but some of them won't leave their busy  husbands or the husbands won't be left; or parents are not amenable; so  they try to create an atmosphere of high spirits and sheer delight in youth  and one another, and the result is almost a work of art. I rather respect  them, but I envy them a good deal less than before I knew them so well."    
"Oh, you envied them? They should envy you."    
"Well, they don't! Yes, I envied them because it is my natural right to be  one of them and fate slammed the door before I was born. It embittered my  first youth, and it might have become an obsession after my brother married  into society if I had not found the right kind of work. That and the boring  Sundays I've spent at Rincona, and the experiences I have had with that  young set, who are always at Mrs. Dwight's more or less; besides a profound  satisfaction in accomplishing literary work that not one of them could do  to save their lives--all this has routed a good deal of my old bitterness  of spirit. I am not sorry that I had it and indulged it, however.  Discontent and resentment put spurs on the soul. Anything is better than  smugness,"    
"It's made you different enough from these others, all right. Even  from Mrs. Dwight, who is different herself....I'd rather you'd stayed  discontented. The whole scheme's all wrong and you know it. You've suffered  from it. You should be the last to tolerate it. When they're jabbering away  about their ninny affairs they pay as little attention to you as they do to  me. They forget our existence. We don't belong, as they say. There isn't,  one of them except Mrs. Dwight that I wouldn't give my eye teeth to see  hanging out the wash or running a machine in a factory."'    
Gora turned to him with a smile. At this time she was as nearly happy as  was possible for that insurgent too aspiring spirit.    
"Nevertheless, they've made you over in a way--Oh, don't flame! I don't  mean your principles...other ways that won't hurt you in the least. You  cut your hair differently. You wear better shoes. You have your clothes  pressed--the suit you wear up here anyhow. You've reformed your speech  somewhat, and you know a good deal more about many things than you did  a few months ago. I am expecting any day to see you wearing a 'boiled'  shirt."    
"Oh, no, not that! It'd never do. It's true enough I got to feeling  self-conscious about my rough clothes and boots, especially after I met  that dude brother of yours one day in the hall and he gave me a once-over  that made me feel like a tramp."    
"Oh!...But he was snubbed himself not so very long ago, and I suppose  it gives him a certain pleasure to snub some one else, I am ashamed of  him....But tell me, don't you like them rather better than you expected?  Find them rather a better sort? You must see that there is practically no  leisure class as far as the men are concerned--"    
"They have time enough to go chicken chasing--"    
"Well, aside from that? At least they do work. And the younger women? You  knew before that they were frivolous because they had too much money and  too few responsibilities. Many of the older women have a serious and useful  side, even if they do waste an unholy amount of time at cards."    
"Well, if you ask me, their manners, when they remember to use 'em, are  better than I expected. Only that Miss Thorndyke is cold and haughty, but  perhaps that's because she's poor (for her), or is covering up something,  or is just plain stupid....Mrs. Dwight's manners are always perfect. She's  my idea of a lady--just! And in the new system there'll be a long sight  more ladies than is possible now, only no aristocrats....Yes, they're  decent enough considering they're rotten poisoned by money and thinkin'  themselves better'n the mass; and I like their affection for one another.  But they could be all that in the socialist state and more too. They'd have  to cut out drink and gambling, and a few other diversions some of 'em'll  drift into, if one or two of 'em haven't already--just through being bored  to death."    
"Do you honestly think socialism means universal virtue?"    
"No, I don't. I'm no such greenhorn; though there's some that does, or  pretends to....But I mean there'd be no <i>drifting</i> into vice like there  is now, no indulgence of any old weakness because temptation was always  following them about or just round the corner. That's the trouble  now....But in the most perfect state some would be watching out for their  chance, just because the old Adam was too strong in spite of the fact that  all the old reminders had disappeared."    
"More likely they'd all murder one another because they were some ten  thousand times more bored than that poor little group whose brains you are  addling."    
"I don't like to hear you talk like that, Miss Gora. You ought to give  that pen of yours to socialism. There would be all the revenge you could  want--and it's what you're entitled to. Then I could call you Comrade  Gora."    
"Call me Comarade by all means if it hurts you to say Miss to a fellow  worker....You admit then that envy of a society you were not born into and  which refuses to acknowledge you as an equal, is the secret of your desire  to pull it down?"    
"Partly that." he admitted cooly. "Not that I'd change places with any of  those fat millionaires I see shuffling down the steps of the Pacific-Union  Club--although I'll admit to you what I wouldn't to these young devils in  my class, that I know some socialists who would. I hate the sight of 'em.  But I want to do away with class-rights and class-distinctions, not only  because I just naturally have no use for them but because I want to put an  end to the misery of the world."    
"You mean the material misery. What would you do with the other seven  hundred different varieties?"    
"Well....I guess each case would have to take care of itself. Perhaps we'd  get round to it after a while. Get power and class-envy out of the world,  and some genius, like as not, would invent a post-graduate course of  colleges for human nature. All things are possible."    
"You are an optimist! Here's our car. Come home with me and share the  supper that I pay for with the tainted money of a plutocrat. Only we  haven't any real plutocrats in San Francisco. Only modest millionaires.  Will you?"    
"Yes." said Mr. Kirkpatrick. "And thank you kindly." He even smiled, for he  was developing a latent heavily overlain seed of humor; inherited from the  full bay tree that had flourished in his grandfather, born in County Clare,  where men sometimes indulged in rebellion but did not take themselves too  seriously withal.
