Mr. Hamn responded at once to the widow's call, his adjacence giving him  the advantage of Dr. Hamilton, of whom he was a trifle jealous. He was  an old bachelor and had proposed to Mistress Fawcett--a captivating  woman till her last hour--twice a year since her husband's death. But  matrimony had been a bitter medicine for Mary after her imagination had  ceased to sweeten it, and her invariable answer to her several suitors  was the disquieting assertion that if ever she was so rash as to take  another husband, she certainly should kill him. Archibald was not the  man to conquer her prejudices, although she loved the sterling in him  and attached him to her by every hook of friendship. He was a dark  nervous little man, spare as most West Indians, used a deal of snuff,  and had a habit of pushing back his wig with a jerking forearm when in  heated controversy with Dr. Hamilton, or expounding matrimony to the  widow.    
Dr. Hamilton, for whose arrival Mr. Hamn was kept waiting,--Mistress  Fawcett tarried until her daughter fell asleep,--was a large square man,  albeit lean, and only less nervous than the widow's suitor. His white  locks were worn in a queue, a few escaping to soften his big powerful  face. Both men wore white linen, but Dr. Hamilton was rarely seen  without his riding-boots, his advent, except in Mistress Fawcett's  house, heralded by the clanking of spurs. Mary would have none of his  spurs on her mahogany floors, and the doctor never yet had been able to  dodge the darkey who stood guard at her doorstep.    
The two men exchanged mild surmises as to the cause of the summons; but  as similar summons occurred when newly wedded blacks were pounding each  other's heads, provoked thereto by the galling chain of decency, or an  obeah doctor had tied a sinister warning to Mistress Fawcett's knocker,  neither of the gentlemen anticipated serious work. When Mary Fawcett  entered the long room, however, both forgot the dignity of their years  and position, and ran forward.    
Dr. Hamilton lifted her as if she had been a palm leaf, and laid her on  the sofa. He despatched Mr. Hamn for a glass of Spanish port, and  forbade her to speak until he gave permission.    
But Mary Fawcett made brief concessions to the weakness of the flesh.  She drank the wine, then sat up and told her story.    
"Oh, Mary," said Dr. Hamilton, sadly, "why do you ask our advice? Your  ear may listen, but never your mind. If it were a matter of business, we  might even be allowed to act for you; but in a domestic--"    
"What?" cried Mistress Fawcett; "have I not asked your advice a thousand  times about Rachael, and have I not always taken it?"    
"I recall many of the conversations, but I doubt if you could recall the  advice. However, if you want it this time, I will give it to you. Don't  force the girl to marry against her will--assuredly not if the man is  repulsive to her. For all your brains you are a baby about men and  women. Rachael knows more by instinct. She is an extraordinary girl, and  should be allowed time to make her own choice. If you are afraid of  death, leave her to me. I will legally adopt her now, if you choose--"    
"Yes, and should you die suddenly, your wife would think Rachael one too  many, what with your brood and the Edwardses to boot." Mistress Fawcett  was nettled by his jibe at the limit of her wisdom. "I shall leave her  with a husband. To that I have made up my mind. What have you to say,  Archibald?"    
This was an advantage which Mr. Hamn never failed to seize; he always  agreed with the widow; Dr. Hamilton never did. Moreover, he was  sincerely convinced that--save, perhaps, in matters of money--Mary  Fawcett could not err.    
"I like the appearance of this Dane," he said, reassuringly, "and his  little country has a valiant history. This young man is quite  prince-like in his bearing, and his extreme fairness is but one more  evidence of his high breeding--"    
"He looks like a shark's belly," interrupted Dr. Hamilton, "I don't  wonder he sickens Rachael. I have nothing against him but his  appearance, but if he came after Kitty I'd throw him out by the seat of  his breeches."    
"He never looked at Kitty, at Government House, nor at Mistress  Montgomerie's," cried Mary. "You are jealous, Will, because Rachael has  carried off the foreign prize."    
Dr. Hamilton laughed, then added seriously, "I am too fond of the girl  to forbear to give my advice. Let her choose her own husband. If you  dare to cut out her future, as if it were one of her new frocks, you  have more courage than I. She has more in her than twenty women. Let her  alone for the next five years, then she will have no one to answer to  but herself. Otherwise, my lady, you may find yourself holding your  breath in a hurricane track, with no refuge from the storm you've  whipped up but five feet underneath. If you won't give her to me, there  are her sisters. They are all wealthy--"    
"They are years older than Rachael and would not understand her at all."    
"I can't see why they should not understand her as well as a strange  man."    
"He will be her husband, madly in love with her."    
"Levine will never be madly in love with anybody. Besides, it would not  matter to Rachael if her sisters did not understand her; she has too  strong a brain not to be independent of the ordinary female nonsense;  moreover, she has a fine disposition and her own property. But if her  husband did not understand her,--in other words, if their tastes proved  as opposite as their temperaments,--it would make a vast deal of  difference. Sisters can be got rid of, but husbands--well, you know the  difficulties."    
"I will think over all you have said," replied Mary, with sudden  humility; she had great respect for the doctor. "But don't you say a  word to Rachael."    
"I'm far too much afraid of you for that. But I wish that Will were home  or Andrew old enough. I'd set one of them on to cut this Dane out. Well,  I must go; send for me whenever you are in need of advice," and with a  parting laugh he strode out of the house and roared to the darkey to  come and fasten his spurs.    
Archibald Hamn, who foresaw possibilities in the widow's loneliness, and  who judged men entirely by their manners, remained to assure Mistress  Fawcett of the wisdom of her choice, and to offer his services as  mediator. Mary laughed and sent him home. She wrote to Levine not to  call until she bade him, and for several days pondered deeply upon her  daughter's opposition and Dr. Hamilton's advice. The first result of  this perturbing distrust in her own wisdom was a violent attack of  rheumatism in the region of her heart; and while she believed herself to  be dying, she wrung from her distracted daughter a promise to marry  Levine. She recovered from the attack, but concluded that, the promise  being won, it would be folly to give it back. Moreover, the desire to  see her daughter married had been aggravated by her brush with death,  and after another interview with Levine, in which he promised all that  the fondest mother could demand, she opened her chests of fine linen.    
Rachael submitted. She dared not excite her mother. Her imagination,  always vivid though it was, refused to picture the end she dreaded; and  she never saw Levine alone. His descriptions of life in Copenhagen  interested her, and when her mother expatiated upon the glittering  destiny which awaited her, ambition and pride responded, although  precisely as they had done in her day dreams. She found herself  visioning Copenhagen, jewels, brocades, and courtiers; but she realized  only when she withdrew to St. Kitts, that Levine had not entered the  dream, even to pass and bend the knee. Often she laughed aloud in  merriment. As the wedding-day approached, she lost her breath more than  once, and her skin chilled. During the last few days before the ceremony  she understood for the first time that it was inevitable. But time--it  was now three months since the needlewomen were set at the  trousseau--and her unconscious acceptance of the horrid fact had trimmed  her spirit to philosophy, altered the habit of her mind. She saw her  mother radiant, received the personal congratulations of every family on  the Island. Her sisters came from St. Croix, and made much of the little  girl who was beginning life so brilliantly; beautiful silks and laces  had come from New York, and Levine had given her jewels, which she tried  on her maid every day because she thought the mustee's tawny skin  enhanced their lustre. She was but a child in spite of her intellect.  Her union with the Dane came to appear as one of the laws of life, and  she finished by accepting it as one accepted an earthquake or a  hurricane. Moreover, she was profoundly innocent.
