In all of the time of The Marching Men there was but one bit of  written matter from the leader McGregor. It had a circulation running  into the millions and was printed in every tongue spoken in America. A  copy of the little circular lies before me now.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>THE MARCHERS <br> <br>  "They ask us what we mean. <br>  Well, here is our answer. <br>  We mean to go on marching. <br>  We mean to march in the morning and in the evening when the sun <br>  goes down. <br>  On Sundays they may sit on their porches or shout at men playing <br>  ball in a field <br>  But we will march. <br>  On the hard cobblestones of the city streets and through the dust <br>  of country roads we will march. <br>  Our legs may be weary and our throats hot and dry, <br>  But still we will march, shoulder to shoulder. <br>  We will march until the ground shakes and tall buildings tremble. <br>  Shoulder to shoulder we will go--all of us-- <br>  On and on forever. <br>  We will not talk nor listen to talk. <br>  We will march and we will teach our sons and our daughters to <br>  march. <br>  Their minds are troubled. Our minds are clear. <br>  We do not think and banter words. <br>  We march. <br>  Our faces are coarse and there is dust in our hair and beards. <br>  See, the inner parts of our hands are rough. <br>  And still we march--we the workers."re <br>
