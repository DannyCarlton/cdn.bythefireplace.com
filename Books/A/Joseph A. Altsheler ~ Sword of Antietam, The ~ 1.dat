   The first youth rode to the crest of the hill, and, still sitting on  his horse, examined the country in the south with minute care through a  pair of powerful glasses. The other two dismounted and waited  patiently. All three were thin and their faces were darkened by sun and  wind. But they were strong alike of body and soul. Beneath the faded  blue uniforms brave hearts beat and powerful muscles responded at once  to every command of the will.
  &#8220;What do you see, Dick?&#8221; asked Warner, who leaned easily against his  horse, with one arm over the pommel of his saddle.
  &#8220;Hills, valleys, mountains, the August heat shimmering over all, but  no human being.&#8221;
  &#8220;A fine country,&#8221; said young Pennington, &#8220;and I like to look at it,  but just now my Nebraska prairie would be better for us. We could at  least see the advance of Stonewall Jackson before he was right on top  of us.&#8221;
  Dick took another long look, searching every point in the half  circle of the south with his glasses. Although burned by summer the  country was beautiful, and neither heat nor cold could take away its  picturesqueness. He saw valleys in which the grass grew thick and  strong, clusters of hills dotted with trees, and then the blue loom of  mountains clothed heavily with foliage. Over everything bent a dazzling  sky of blue and gold.
  The light was so intense that with his glasses he could pick out  individual trees and rocks on the far slopes. He saw an occasional  roof, but nowhere did he see man. He knew the reason, but he had become  so used to his trade that at the moment, he felt no sadness. All this  region had been swept by great armies. Here the tide of battle in the  mightiest of all wars had rolled back and forth, and here it was  destined to surge again in a volume increasing always.
  &#8220;I don't find anything,&#8221; repeated Dick, &#8220;but three pairs of eyes are  better than none. George, you take the glasses and see what you can see  and Frank will follow.&#8221;
  He dismounted and stood holding the reins of his horse while the  young Vermonter looked. He noticed that the mathematical turn of  Warner's mind showed in every emergency. He swept the glasses back and  forth in a regular curve, not looking here and now there, but taking  his time and missing nothing. It occurred to Dick that he was a type of  his region, slow but thorough, and sure to win after defeat.
  &#8220;What's the result of your examination?&#8221; asked Dick as Warner passed  the glasses in turn to Pennington.
  &#8220;Let x equal what I saw, which is nothing. Let y equal the result I  draw, which is nothing. Hence we have x + y which still equals  nothing.&#8221;
  Pennington was swifter in his examination. The blood in his veins  flowed a little faster than Warner's.
  &#8220;I find nothing but land and water,&#8221; he said without waiting to be  asked, &#8220;and I'm disappointed. I had a hope, Dick, that I'd see  Stonewall Jackson himself riding along a slope.&#8221;
  &#8220;Even if you saw him, how would you know it was Stonewall?&#8221;
  &#8220;I hadn't thought of that. We've heard so much of him that it just  seemed to me I'd know him anywhere.&#8221;
  &#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;Remember all the tales we've heard about  his whiskers, his old slouch hat and his sorrel horse.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd like to see him myself,&#8221; confessed Dick. &#8220;From all we hear he's  the man who kept McClellan from taking Richmond. He certainly played  hob with the plans of our generals. You know, I've got a cousin, Harry  Kenton, with him. I had a letter from him a week ago&#8212;passing through  the lines, and coming in a round-about way. Writes as if he thought  Stonewall Jackson was a demigod. Says we'd better quit and go home, as  we haven't any earthly chance to win this war.&#8221;
  &#8220;He fights best who wins last,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;I'm thinking I won't  see the green hills of Vermont for a long time yet, because I mean to  pay a visit to Richmond first. Have you got your cousin's letter with  you, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I destroyed it. I didn't want it bobbing up some time or other  to cause either of us trouble. A man I know at home says he's kept out  of a lot of trouble by 'never writin' nothin' to nobody.' And if you do  write a letter the next best thing is to burn it as quick as you can.&#8221;
  &#8220;If my eyes tell the truth, and they do,&#8221; said Pennington, &#8220;here  comes a short, thick man riding a long, thick horse and he&#8212;the man,  not the horse&#8212;bears a startling resemblance to our friend, ally, guide  and sometime mentor, Sergeant Daniel Whitley.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it's the sergeant,&#8221; said Dick, looking down into the valley,  &#8220;and I'm glad he's joining us. Do you know, boys, I often think these  veteran sergeants know more than some of our generals.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's not an opinion. It's a fact,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;Hi, there,  sergeant! Here are your friends! Come up and make the same empty report  that we've got ready for the colonel.&#8221;
  Sergeant Daniel Whitley looked at the three lads, and his face  brightened. He had a good intellect under his thatch of hair, and a  warm heart within his strong body. The boys, although lieutenants, and  he only a sergeant in the ranks, treated him usually as an equal and  often as a superior.
  Colonel Winchester's regiment and the remains of Colonel Newcomb's  Pennsylvanians had been sent east after the defeat of the Union army at  the Seven Days, and were now with Pope's Army of Virginia, which was to  hold the valley and also protect Washington. Grant's success at Shiloh  had been offset by McClellan's failure before Richmond, and the  President and his Cabinet at Washington were filled with justifiable  alarm. Pope was a western man, a Kentuckian, and he had insisted upon  having some of the western troops with him.
  The sergeant rode his horse slowly up the slope, and joined the lads  over whom he watched like a father.
  &#8220;And what have the hundred eyes of Argus beheld?&#8221; asked Warner.
  &#8220;Argus?&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;I don't know any such man. Name sounds  queer, too.&#8221;
  &#8220;He belongs to a distant and mythical past, sergeant, but he'd be  mighty useful if we had him here. If even a single one of his hundred  eyes were to light on Stonewall Jackson, it would be a great service.&#8221;
  The sergeant shook his head and looked reprovingly at Warner.
  &#8220;It ain't no time for jokin',&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I was never further from it. It seems to me that we need a lot of  Arguses more than anything else. This is the enemy's country, and we  hear that Stonewall Jackson is advancing. Advancing where, from what  and when? There is no Argus to tell. The country supports a fairly  numerous population, but it hasn't a single kind or informing word for  us. Is Stonewall Jackson going to drop from the sky, which rumor says  is his favorite method of approach?&#8221;
  &#8220;He's usin' the solid ground this time, anyway,&#8221; said Sergeant  Daniel Whitley. &#8220;I've been eight miles farther south, an' if I didn't  see cavalry comin' along the skirt of a ridge, then my eyes ain't any  friends of mine. Then I came through a little place of not more'n five  houses. No men there, just women an' children, but when I looked back I  saw them women an' children, too, grinnin' at me. That means somethin',  as shore as we're livin' an' breathin'. I'm bettin' that we new fellows  from the west will get acquainted with Stonewall Jackson inside of  twenty-four hours.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't mean that? It's not possible!&#8221; exclaimed Dick, startled.  &#8220;Why, when we last heard of Jackson he was so far south we can't expect  him in a week!&#8221;
  &#8220;You've heard that they call his men the foot cavalry,&#8221; said the  sergeant gravely, &#8220;an' I reckon from all I've learned since I come east  that they've won the name fair an' true. See them woods off to the  south there. See the black line they make ag'inst the sky. I know, the  same as if I had seen him, that Stonewall Jackson is down in them  forests, comin' an' comin' fast.&#8221;
  The sergeant's tone was ominous, and Dick felt a tingling at the  roots of his hair. The western troops were eager to meet this new  Southern phenomenon who had suddenly shot like a burning star across  the sky, but for the first time there was apprehension in his soul. He  had seen but little of the new general, Pope, but he had read his  proclamations and he had thought them bombastic. He talked lightly of  the enemy and of the grand deeds that he was going to do. Who was Pope  to sweep away such men as Lee and Jackson with mere words!
  Dick longed for Grant, the stern, unyielding, unbeatable Grant whom  he had known at Shiloh. In the west the Union troops had felt the  strong hand over them, and confidence had flowed into them, but here  they were in doubt. They felt that the powerful and directing mind was  absent.
  Silence fell upon them all for a little space, while the four gazed  intently into the south, strange fears assailing everyone. Dick never  doubted that the Union would win. He never doubted it then and he never  doubted it afterward, through all the vast hecatomb when the flag of  the Union fell more than once in terrible defeat.
  But their ignorance was mystifying and oppressive. They saw before  them the beautiful country, the hills and valleys, the forest and the  blue loom of the mountains, so much that appealed to the eye, and yet  the horizon, looking so peaceful in the distance, was barbed with  spears. Jackson was there! The sergeant's theory had become conviction  with them. Distance had been nothing to him. He was at hand with a  great force, and Lee with another army might fall at any time upon  their flank, while McClellan was isolated and left useless, far away.
  Dick's heart missed a beat or two, as he saw the sinister picture  that he had created in his own mind. Highly imaginative, he had leaped  to the conclusion that Lee and Jackson meant to trap the Union army,  the hammer beating it out on the anvil. He raised the glasses to his  eyes, surveyed the forests in the South once more, and then his heart  missed another beat.
  He had caught the flash of steel, the sun's rays falling across a  bayonet or a polished rifle barrel. And then as he looked he saw the  flash again and again. He handed the glasses to Warner and said  quietly:
  &#8220;George, I see troops on the edge of that far hill to the south and  the east. Can't you see them, too?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I can make them out clearly now, as they pass across a bit of  open land. They're Confederate cavalry, two hundred at least, I should  say.&#8221;
  Dick learned long afterward that it was the troop of Sherburne, but,  for the present, the name of Sherburne was unknown to him. He merely  felt that this was the vanguard of Jackson riding forward to set the  trap. The men were now so near that they could be seen with the naked  eye, and the sergeant said tersely:
  &#8220;At last we've seen what we were afraid we would see.&#8221;
  &#8220;And look to the left also,&#8221; said Warner, who still held the  glasses. &#8220;There's a troop of horse coming up another road, too. By  George, they're advancing at a trot! We'd better clear out or we may be  enclosed between the two horns of their cavalry.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll go back to our force at Cedar Run,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and report  what we've seen. As you say, George, there's no time to waste.&#8221;
  The four mounted and rode fast, the dust of the road flying in a  cloud behind their horses' heels. Dick felt that they had fulfilled  their errand, but he had his doubts how their news would be received.  The Northern generals in the east did not seem to him to equal those of  the west in keenness and resolution, while the case was reversed so far  as the Southern generals were concerned.
  But fast as they went the Southern cavalry was coming with equal  speed. They continually saw the flash of arms in both east and west.  The force in the west was the nearer of the two. Not only was Sherburne  there, but Harry Kenton was with him, and besides their own natural  zeal they had all the eagerness and daring infused into them by the  great spirit and brilliant successes of Jackson.
  &#8220;They won't be able to enclose us between the two horns of their  horsemen,&#8221; said Sergeant Whitley, whose face was very grave, &#8220;and the  battle won't be to-morrow or the next day.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not? I thought Jackson was swift,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;Cause it will be fought to-day. I thought Jackson was swift, too,  but he's swifter than I thought. Them feet cavalry of his don't have to  change their name. Look into the road comin' up that narrow valley.&#8221;
  The eyes of the three boys followed his pointing finger, and they  now saw masses of infantry, men in gray pressing forward at full speed.  They saw also batteries of cannon, and Dick almost fancied he could  hear the rumble of their wheels.
  &#8220;Looks as if the sergeant was right,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;Stonewall  Jackson is here.&#8221;
  They increased their speed to a gallop, making directly for Cedar  Run, a cold, clear little stream coming out of the hills. It was now  about the middle of the morning and the day was burning hot and  breathless. Their hearts began to pound with excitement, and their  breath was drawn painfully through throats lined with dust.
  A long ridge covered with forest rose on one side of them and now  they saw the flash of many bayonets and rifle barrels along its lowest  slope. Another heavy column of infantry was advancing, and presently  they heard the far note of trumpets calling to one another.
  &#8220;Their whole army is in touch,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;The trumpets  show it. Often on the plains, when we had to divide our little force  into detachments, they'd have bugle talk with one another. We must go  faster if we can.&#8221;
  They got another ounce of strength out of their horses, and now they  saw Union cavalry in front. In a minute or two they were among the blue  horsemen, giving the hasty news of Jackson's advance. Other scouts and  staff officers arrived a little later with like messages, and not long  afterward they heard shots behind them telling them that the hostile  pickets were in touch.
  They watered their horses in Cedar Run, crossed it and rejoined  their own regiment under Colonel Arthur Winchester. The colonel was  thin, bronzed and strong, and he, too, like the other new men from the  West, was eager for battle with the redoubtable Jackson.
  &#8220;What have you seen, Dick?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Is it a mere scouting  force of cavalry, or is Jackson really at hand?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think it's Jackson himself. We saw heavy columns coming up. They  were pressing forward, too, as if they meant to brush aside whatever  got in their way.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll show them!&#8221; exclaimed Colonel Winchester. &#8220;We've only  seven thousand men here on Cedar Run, but Banks, who is in immediate  command, has been stung deeply by his defeats at the hands of Jackson,  and he means a fight to the last ditch. So does everybody else.&#8221;
  Dick, at that moment, the thrill of the gallop gone, was not so  sanguine. The great weight of Jackson's name hung over him like a  sinister menace, and the Union troops on Cedar Run were but seven  thousand. The famous Confederate leader must have at least three times  that number. Were the Union forces, separated into several armies, to  be beaten again in detail? Pope himself should be present with at least  fifty thousand men.
  Their horses had been given to an orderly and Dick threw himself  upon the turf to rest a little. All along the creek the Union army,  including his own regiment, was forming in line of battle but his  colonel had not yet called upon him for any duty. Warner and Pennington  were also resting from their long and exciting ride, but the sergeant,  who seemed never to know fatigue, was already at work with his men.
  &#8220;Listen to those skirmishers,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;It sounds like the  popping of corn at home on winter evenings, when I was a little boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;But a lot more deadly,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;I wouldn't like to be a  skirmisher. I don't mind firing into the smoke and the crowd, but I'd  hate to sit down behind a stump or in the grass and pick out the spot  on a man that I meant for my bullet to hit.&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't have to do any such work, Frank,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;Hark to  it! The sergeant was right. We're going to have a battle to-day and a  big one. The popping of your corn, Dick, has become an unbroken sound.&#8221;
  Dick, from the crest of the hillock on which they lay, gazed over  the heads of the men in blue. The skirmishers were showing a hideous  activity. A continuous line of light ran along the front of both  armies, and behind the flash of the Southern firing he saw heavy masses  of infantry emerging from the woods. A deep thrill ran through him.  Jackson, the famous, the redoubtable, the unbeatable, was at hand with  his army. Would he remain unbeaten? Dick said to himself, in unspoken  words, over and over again, &#8220;No! No! No! No!&#8221; He and his comrades had  been victors in the west. They must not fail here.
  Colonel Winchester now called to them, and mounting their horses  they gathered around him to await his orders. These officers, though  mere boys, learned fast. Dick knew enough already of war to see that  they were in a strong position. Before them flowed the creek. On their  flank and partly in their front was a great field of Indian corn. A  quarter of a mile away was a lofty ridge on which were posted Union  guns with gunners who knew so well how to use them. To right and left  ran the long files of infantry, their faces white but resolute.
  &#8220;I think,&#8221; said Dick to Warner, &#8220;that if Jackson passes over this  place he will at least know that we've been here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, he'll know it, and besides he'll make quite a halt before  passing. At least, that's my way of thinking.&#8221;
  There was a sudden dying of the rifle fire. The Union skirmishers  were driven in, and they fell back on the main body which was silent,  awaiting the attack. Dick was no longer compelled to use the glasses.  He saw with unaided eye the great Southern columns marching forward  with the utmost confidence, heavy batteries advancing between the  regiments, ready at command to sweep the Northern ranks with shot and  shell.
  Dick shivered a little. He could not help it. They were face to face  with Jackson, and he was all that the heralds of fame had promised. He  had eye enough to see that the Southern force was much greater than  their own, and, led by such a man, how could they fail to win another  triumph? He looked around upon the army in blue, but he did not see any  sign of fear. Both the beaten and the unbeaten were ready for a new  battle.
  There was a mighty crash from the hill and the Northern batteries  poured a stream of metal into the advancing ranks of their foe.
  The Confederate advance staggered, but, recovering itself, came on  again. A tremendous cheer burst from the ranks of the lads in blue.  Stonewall Jackson with all his skill and fame was before them, but they  meant to stop him. Numbers were against them, and Banks, their leader,  had been defeated already by Jackson, but they meant to stop him,  nevertheless.
  The Southern guns replied. Posted along the slopes of Slaughter  Mountain, sinister of name, they sent a sheet of death upon the Union  ranks. But the regiments, the new and the old, stood firm. Those that  had been beaten before by Jackson were resolved not to be beaten again  by him, and the new regiments from the west, one or two of which had  been at Shiloh, were resolved never to be beaten at all.
  &#8220;The lads are steady,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;It's a fine sign.  I've news, too, that two thousand men have come up. We shall now have  nine thousand with which to withstand the attack, and I don't believe  they can drive us away. Oh, why isn't Pope himself here with his whole  army? Then we could wipe Jackson off the face of the earth!&#8221;
  But Pope was not there. The commander of a huge force, the man of  boastful words who was to do such great things, the man who sent such  grandiloquent dispatches from &#8220;Headquarters in the Saddle,&#8221; to the  anxious Lincoln at Washington, had strung his numerous forces along in  detachments, just as the others had done before him, and the booming of  Jackson's cannon attacking the Northern vanguard with his whole army  could not reach ears so far away.
  The fire now became heavy along the whole Union front. All the  batteries on both sides were coming into action, and the earth trembled  with the rolling crash. The smoke rose and hung in clouds over the  hills, the valley and the cornfield. The hot air, surcharged with dust,  smoke and burned gunpowder, was painful and rasping to the throat. The  frightful screaming of the shells filled the air, and then came the  hissing of the bullets like a storm of sleet.
  Colonel Winchester and his staff dismounted, giving their horses to  an orderly who led them to the rear. Horses would not be needed for the  present, at least, and they had learned to avoid needless risk.
  The attack was coming closer, and the bullets as they swept through  their ranks found many victims. Colonel Winchester ordered his regiment  to kneel and open fire, being held hitherto in reserve. Dick snatched  up a rifle from a soldier who had fallen almost beside him, and he saw  that Warner and Pennington had equipped themselves in like fashion.
  A strong gust of wind lifted the smoke before them a little. Dick  saw many splashes of water on the surface of the creek where bullets  struck, and there were many tiny spurts of dust in the road, where  other bullets fell. Then he saw beyond the dark masses of the Southern  infantry. It seemed to him that they were strangely close. He believed  that he could see their tanned faces, one by one, and their vengeful  eyes, but it was only fancy.
  The next instant the signal was given, and the regiment fired as  one. There was a long flash of fire, a tremendous roaring in Dick's  ears, then for an instant or two a vast cloud of smoke hid the  advancing gray mass. When it was lifted a moment later the men in gray  were advancing no longer. Their ranks were shattered and broken, the  ground was covered with the fallen and the others were reeling back.
  &#8220;We win! We win!&#8221; shouted Pennington, wild with enthusiasm.
  &#8220;For the present, at least,&#8221; said Warner, a deep flush blazing in  either cheek.
  There was no return fire just then from that point, and the smoke  lifted a little more. Above the crash of the battle which raged  fiercely on either flank, they heard the notes of a trumpet rising,  loud, clear, and distinct from all other sounds. Dick knew that it was  a rallying call, and then he heard Pennington utter a wild shout.
  &#8220;I see him! I see him!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It's old Stonewall himself! There  on the hillock, on the little horse!&#8221;
  The vision was but for an instant. Dick gazed with all his eyes, and  he saw several hundred yards away a thickset man on a sorrel horse. He  was bearded and he stooped a little, seeming to bend an intense gaze  upon the Northern lines.
  There was no time for anyone to fire, because in a few seconds the  smoke came back, a huge, impenetrable curtain, and hid the man and the  hillock. But Dick had not the slightest doubt that it was the great  Southern leader, and he was right. It was Stonewall Jackson on the  hillock, rallying his men, and Dick's own cousin, Harry Kenton, rode by  his side.
  They reloaded, but a staff officer galloped up and delivered a  written order to Colonel Winchester. The whole regiment left the line,  another less seasoned taking its place, and they marched off to one  flank, where a field of wheat lately cut, and a wood on the extreme  end, lay before them. Behind them they heard the battle swelling anew,  but Dick knew that a new force of the foe was coming here, and he felt  proud that his own regiment had been moved to meet an attack which  would certainly be made with the greatest violence.
  &#8220;Who are those men down in the wheat-field?&#8221; asked Pennington.
  &#8220;Our own skirmishers,&#8221; replied Warner. &#8220;See them running forward,  hiding behind the shocks of straw and firing!&#8221;
  The riflemen were busy. They fired from the shelter of every straw  stack in the field, and they stung the new Southern advance, which was  already showing its front. Southern guns now began to search the wheat  field. A shell struck squarely in the center of one of the shocks  behind which three Northern skirmishers were kneeling. Dick saw the  straw fly into the air as if picked up by a whirlwind. When it settled  back it lay in scattered masses and three dark figures lay with it,  motionless and silent. He shuddered and looked away.
  The edge of the wood was now lined with Southern infantry, and on  their right flank was a numerous body of cavalry. Officers were waving  their swords aloft, leading the men in person to the charge.
  &#8220;The attack will be heavy here,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;Ah, there  are our guns firing over our heads. We need 'em.&#8221;
  The Southern cannon were more numerous, but the Northern guns,  posted well on the hill, refused to be silenced. Some of them were  dismounted and the gunners about them were killed, but the others,  served with speed and valor, sprayed the whole Southern front with a  deadly shower of steel.
  It was this welcome metal that Dick and his comrades heard over  their heads, and then the trumpets rang a shrill note of defiance along  the whole line. Banks, remembering his bitter defeats and resolved upon  victory now, was not awaiting the attack. He would make it himself.
  The whole wing lifted itself up and rushed through the wheat field,  firing as they charged. The cannon were pushed forward and poured in  volleys as fast as the gunners could load and discharge them. Dick felt  the ground reeling beneath his feet, but he knew that they were  advancing and that the enemy was giving way again. Stonewall Jackson  and his generals felt a certain hardening of the Northern resistance  that day. The recruits in blue were becoming trained now. They did not  break in a panic, although their lines were raked through and through  by the Southern shells. New men stepped in the place of the fallen, and  the lines, filled up, came on again.
  The Northern wing charging through the wheat field continued to bear  back the enemy. Jackson was not yet able to stop the fierce masses in  blue. A formidable body of men issuing from the Northern side of the  wood charged with the bayonet, pushing the charge home with a courage  and a recklessness of death that the war had not yet seen surpassed.  The Southern rifles and cannon raked them, but they never stopped,  bursting like a tornado upon their foe.
  One of Jackson's Virginia regiments gave way and then another. The  men in blue from the wood and Colonel Winchester's regiment joined,  their shouts rising above the smoke while they steadily pushed the  enemy before them.
  Dick as he shouted with the rest felt a wild exultation. They were  showing Jackson what they could do! They were proving to him that he  could not win always. His joy was warranted. No such confusion had ever  before existed in Jackson's army. The Northern charge was driven like a  wedge of steel into its ranks.
  Jackson had able generals, valiant lieutenants, with him, Ewell and  Early, and A. P. Hill and Winder, and they strove together to stop the  retreat. The valiant Winder was mortally wounded and died upon the  field, and Jackson, with his wonderful ability to see what was  happening and his equal power of decision, swiftly withdrew that wing  of his army, also carrying with it every gun.
  A great shout of triumph rose from the men in blue as they saw the  Southern retreat.
  &#8220;We win! We win!&#8221; cried Pennington again.
  &#8220;Yes, we win!&#8221; shouted Warner, usually so cool.
  And it did seem even to older men that the triumph was complete. The  blue and the gray were face to face in the smoke, but the gray were  driven back by the fierce and irresistible charge, and, as their flight  became swifter, the shells and grape from the Northern batteries  plunged and tore through their ranks. Nothing stopped the blue wave. It  rolled on and on, sweeping a mass of fugitives before it, and engulfing  others.
  Dick had no ordered knowledge of the charge. He was a part of it,  and he saw only straight in front of him, but he was conscious that all  around him there was a fiery red mist, and a confused and terrible  noise of shouting and firing. But they were winning! They were beating  Stonewall Jackson himself. His pulses throbbed so hard that he thought  his arteries would burst, and his lips were dry and blackened from  smoke, burned gunpowder and his own hot breath issuing like steam  between them.
  Then came a halt so sudden and terrible that it shook Dick as if by  physical contact. He looked around in wonder. The charge was spent, not  from its lack of strength but because they had struck an obstacle. They  had reckoned ill, because they had not reckoned upon all the resources  of Stonewall Jackson's mind. He had stemmed the rout in person and now  he was pushing forward the Stonewall Brigade, five regiments, which  always had but two alternatives, to conquer or to die. Hill and Ewell  with fresh troops were coming up also on his flanks, and now the blue  and the gray, face to face again, closed in mortal combat.
  &#8220;We've stopped! We've stopped! Do you hear it, we've stopped!&#8221;  exclaimed Pennington, his face a ghastly reek of dust and perspiration,  his eyes showing amazement and wonder how the halt could have happened.  Dick shared in the terrible surprise. The fire in front of him deepened  suddenly. Men were struck down all about him. Heavy masses of troops in  gray showed through the smoke. The Stonewall Brigade was charging, and  regiments were charging with it on either side.
  The column in blue was struck in front and on either flank. It not  only ceased its victorious advance, but it began to give ground. The  men could not help it, despite their most desperate efforts. It seemed  to Dick that the earth slipped under their feet. A tremendous  excitement seized him at the thought of victory lost just when it  seemed won. He ran up and down the lines, shouting to the men to stand  firm. He saw that the senior officers were doing the same, but there  was little order or method in his own movements. It was the excitement  and bitter humiliation that drove him on.
  He stumbled in the smoke against Sergeant Whitley. The sergeant's  forehead had been creased by a bullet, but so much dust and burned  gunpowder had gathered upon it that it was as black as the face of a  black man.
  &#8220;Are we to lose after all?&#8221; exclaimed Dick.
  It seemed strange to him, even at that moment, that he should hear  his own voice amid such a roar of cannon and rifles. But it was an  undernote, and he heard with equal ease the sergeant's reply:
  &#8220;It ain't decided yet, Mr. Mason, but we've got to fight as we never  fought before.&#8221;
  The Union men, both those who had faced Jackson before and those who  were now meeting him for the first time, fought with unsurpassed valor,  but, unequal in numbers, they saw the victory wrenched from their  grasp. Jackson now had his forces in the hollow of his hand. He saw  everything that was passing, and with the mind of a master he read the  meaning of it. He strengthened his own weak points and increased the  attack upon those of the North.
  Dick remained beside the sergeant. He had lost sight of Colonel  Winchester, Warner and Pennington in the smoke and the dreadful  confusion, but he saw well enough that his fears were coming true.
  The attack in front increased in violence, and the Northern army was  also attacked with fiery energy on both flanks. The men had the actual  physical feeling that they were enclosed in the jaws of a vise, and,  forced to abandon all hope of victory, they fought now to escape. Two  small squadrons of cavalry, scarce two hundred in number, sent forward  from a wood, charged the whole Southern army under a storm of cannon  and rifle fire. They equalled the ride of the Six Hundred at Balaklava,  but with no poet to celebrate it, it remained like so many other  charges in this war, an obscure and forgotten incident.
  Dick saw the charge of the horsemen, and the return of the few. Then  he lost hope. Above the roar of the battle the rebel yell continually  swelled afresh. The setting sun, no longer golden but red, cast a  sinister light over the trampled wheat field, the slopes and the woods  torn by cannon balls. The dead and the wounded lay in thousands, and  Banks, brave and tenacious, but with bitter despair in his heart, was  seeking to drag the remains of his army from that merciless vise which  continued to close down harder and harder.
  Dick's excitement and tension seemed to abate. He had been keyed to  so high a pitch that his pulses grew gentler through very lack of  force, and with the relaxation came a clearer view. He saw the sinking  red sun through the banks of smoke, and in fancy he already felt the  cool darkness upon his face after the hot and terrible August day. He  knew that night might save them, and he prayed deeply and fervently for  its swift coming.
  He and the sergeant came suddenly to Colonel Winchester, whose hat  had been shot from his head, but who was otherwise unharmed. Warner and  Pennington were near, Warner slightly wounded but apparently unaware of  the fact. The colonel, by shout and by gesture, was gathering around  him the remains of his regiment. Other regiments on either side were  trying to do the same, and eventually they formed a compact mass which,  driving with all its force back toward its old position, reached the  hills and the woods just as the jaws of Stonewall Jackson's vise shut  down, but not upon the main body.
  Victory, won for a little while, had been lost. Night protected  their retreat, and they fought with a valor that made Jackson and all  his generals cautious. But this knowledge was little compensation to  the Northern troops. They knew that behind them was a great army, that  Pope might have been present with fifty thousand men, sufficient to  overwhelm Jackson. Instead of the odds being more than two to one in  their favor, they had been two to one against them.
  It was a sullen army that lay in the woods in the first hour or two  of the night, gasping for breath. These men had boasted that they were  a match for those of Jackson, and they were, if they could only have  traded generals. Dick and his comrades from the west began to share in  the awe that the name of Stonewall Jackson inspired.
  &#8220;He comes up to his advertisements. There ain't no doubt of it,&#8221;  said Sergeant Whitley. &#8220;I never saw anybody fight better than our men  did, an' that charge of the little troop of cavalry was never beat  anywhere in the world. But here we are licked, and thirty or forty  thousand men of ours not many miles away!&#8221;
  He spoke the last words with a bitterness that Dick had never heard  in his voice before.
  &#8220;It's simple,&#8221; said Warner, who was binding up his little wound with  his own hand. &#8220;It's just a question in mathematics. I see now how  Stonewall Jackson won so many triumphs in the Valley of Virginia. Give  Jackson, say, fifteen thousand men. We have fifty thousand, but we  divide them into five armies of ten thousand apiece. Jackson fights  them in detail, which is five battles, of course. His fifteen thousand  defeat the ten thousand every time. Hence Jackson with fifteen thousand  men has beaten our side. It's simple but painful. In time our leaders  will learn.&#8221;
  &#8220;After we're all killed,&#8221; said Pennington sadly.
  &#8220;And the country is ripped apart so that it will take half a century  to put the pieces back together again and put 'em back right,&#8221; said  Dick, with equal sadness.
  &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Sergeant Whitley with returning cheerfulness.  &#8220;Other countries have survived great wars and so will ours.&#8221;
  Some food was obtained for the exhausted men and they ate it  nervously, paying little attention to the crackling fire of the  skirmishers which was still going on in the darkness along their front.  Dick saw the pink flashes along the edges of the woods and the wheat  field, but his mind, deadened for the time, took no further  impressions. Skirmishers were unpleasant people, anyway. Let them fight  down there. It did not matter what they might do to one another. A  minute or two later he was ashamed of such thoughts.
  Colonel Winchester, who had been to see General Banks, returned  presently and told them that they would march again in half an hour.
  &#8220;General Banks,&#8221; he said with bitter irony, &#8220;is afraid that a  powerful force of the rebels will gain his rear and that we shall be  surrounded. He ought to know. He has had enough dealings with Jackson.  Outmaneuvered and outflanked again! Why can't we learn something?&#8221;
  But he said this to the young officers only. He forced a  cheerfulness of tone when he spoke to the men, and they dragged  themselves wearily to their feet in order to begin the retreat. But  though the muscles were tired the spirit was not unwilling. All the  omens were sinister, pointing to the need of withdrawal. The vicious  skirmishers were still busy and a crackling fire came from many points  in the woods. The occasional rolling thunder of a cannon deepened the  somberness of the scene.
  All the officers of the regiment had lost their horses and they  walked now with the men. A full moon threw a silvery light over the  marching troops, who strode on in silence, the wounded suppressing  their groans. A full moon cast a silvery light over the pallid faces.
  &#8220;Do you know where we are going?&#8221; Dick asked of the Vermonter.
  &#8220;I heard that we're bound for a place called Culpeper Court House,  six or seven miles away. I suppose we'll get there in the morning, if  Stonewall Jackson doesn't insist on another interview with us.&#8221;
  &#8220;There's enough time in the day for fighting,&#8221; said Pennington,  &#8220;without borrowing of the night. Hear that big gun over there on our  right! Why do they want to be firing cannon balls at such a time?&#8221;
  They trudged gloomily on, following other regiments ghostly in the  moonlight, and followed by others as ghostly. But the sinister omens,  the flash of rifle firing and the far boom of a cannon, were always on  their flanks. The impression of Jackson's skill and power which Dick  had gained so quickly was deepening already. He did not have the  slightest doubt now that the Southern leader was pressing forward  through the woods to cut them off. As the sergeant had said truly, he  came up to his advertisements and more. Dick shivered and it was a  shiver of apprehension for the army, and not for himself.
  In accordance with human nature he and the boy officers who were his  good comrades talked together, but their sentences were short and  broken.
  &#8220;Marching toward a court house,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;What'll we do  when we get there? Lawyers won't help us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not so much marching toward a court house as marching away from  Jackson,&#8221; said the Vermonter.
  &#8220;We'll march back again,&#8221; said Dick hopefully.
  &#8220;But when?&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;Look through the trees there on our  right. Aren't those rebel troops?&#8221;
  Dick's startled gaze beheld a long line of horsemen in gray on their  flank and only a few hundred yards away.
