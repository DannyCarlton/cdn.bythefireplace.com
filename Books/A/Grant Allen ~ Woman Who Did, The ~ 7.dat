Thus, half against his will, Alan Merrick was drawn into this  irregular compact.    
Next came that more difficult matter, the discussion of ways and  means, the more practical details. Alan hardly knew at first on  what precise terms it was Herminia's wish that they two should pass  their lives together. His ideas were all naturally framed on the  old model of marriage; in that matter, Herminia said, he was still  in the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity. He took it  for granted that of course they must dwell under one roof with one  another. But that simple ancestral notion, derived from man's  lordship in his own house, was wholly adverse to Herminia's views  of the reasonable and natural. She had debated these problems at  full in her own mind for years, and had arrived at definite and  consistent solutions for every knotty point in them. Why should  this friendship differ at all, she asked, in respect of time and  place, from any other friendship? The notion of necessarily  keeping house together, the cramping idea of the family tie,  belonged entirely to the regime of the manmade patriarchate, where  the woman and the children were the slaves and chattels of the lord  and master. In a free society, was it not obvious that each woman  would live her own life apart, would preserve her independence, and  would receive the visits of the man for whom she cared,--the father  of her children? Then only could she be free. Any other method  meant the economic and social superiority of the man, and was  irreconcilable with the perfect individuality of the woman.    
So Herminia reasoned. She rejected at once, therefore, the idea of  any change in her existing mode of life. To her, the friendship  she proposed with Alan Merrick was no social revolution; it was but  the due fulfilment of her natural functions. To make of it an  occasion for ostentatious change in her way of living seemed to her  as unnatural as is the practice of the barbarians in our midst who  use a wedding--that most sacred and private event in a young girl's  life--as an opportunity for display of the coarsest and crudest  character. To rivet the attention of friends on bride and  bridegroom is to offend against the most delicate susceptibilities  of modesty. From all such hateful practices, Herminia's pure mind  revolted by instinct. She felt that here at least was the one  moment in a woman's history when she would shrink with timid  reserve from every eye save one man's,--when publicity of any sort  was most odious and horrible.    
Only the blinding effect of custom, indeed, could ever have shut  good women's eyes to the shameful indecorousness of wedding  ceremonial. We drag a young girl before the prying gaze of all the  world at the very crisis in her life, when natural modesty would  most lead her to conceal herself from her dearest acquaintance.  And our women themselves have grown so blunted by use to the  hatefulness of the ordeal that many of them face it now with  inhuman effrontery. Familiarity with marriage has almost killed  out in the maidens of our race the last lingering relics of native  modesty.    
Herminia, however, could dispense with all that show. She had a  little cottage of her own, she told Alan,--a tiny little cottage,  in a street near her school-work; she rented it for a small sum,  in quite a poor quarter, all inhabited by work-people. There she  lived by herself; for she kept no servants. There she should  continue to live; why need this purely personal compact between  them two make any difference in her daily habits? She would go  on with her school-work for the present, as usual. Oh, no, she  certainly didn't intend to notify the head-mistress of the school  or any one else, of her altered position. It was no alteration of  position at all, so far as she was concerned; merely the addition  to life of a new and very dear and natural friendship. Herminia  took her own point of view so instinctively indeed,--lived so  wrapped in an ideal world of her own and the future's,--that Alan  was often quite alarmed in his soul when he thought of the rude  awakening that no doubt awaited her. Yet whenever he hinted it to  her with all possible delicacy, she seemed so perfectly prepared  for the worst the world could do, so fixed and resolved in her  intention of martyrdom, that he had no argument left, and could  only sigh over her.    
It was not, she explained to him further, that she wished to  conceal anything. The least tinge of concealment was wholly alien  to that frank fresh nature. If her head-mistress asked her a  point-blank question, she would not attempt to parry it, but would  reply at once with a point blank answer. Still, her very views on  the subject made it impossible for her to volunteer information  unasked to any one. Here was a personal matter of the utmost  privacy; a matter which concerned nobody on earth, save herself and  Alan; a matter on which it was the grossest impertinence for any  one else to make any inquiry or hold any opinion. They two chose  to be friends; and there, so far as the rest of the world was  concerned, the whole thing ended. What else took place between  them was wholly a subject for their own consideration. But if ever  circumstances should arise which made it necessary for her to avow  to the world that she must soon be a mother, then it was for the  world to take the first step, if it would act upon its own hateful  and cruel initiative. She would never deny, but she would never go  out of her way to confess. She stood upon her individuality as a  human being.    
As to other practical matters, about which Alan ventured delicately  to throw out a passing question or two, Herminia was perfectly  frank, with the perfect frankness of one who thinks and does  nothing to be ashamed of. She had always been self-supporting, she  said, and she would be self-supporting still. To her mind, that  was an essential step towards the emancipation of women. Their  friendship implied for her no change of existence, merely an  addition to the fulness of her living. He was the complement of  her being. Every woman should naturally wish to live her whole  life, to fulfil her whole functions; and that she could do only by  becoming a mother, accepting the orbit for which nature designed  her. In the end, no doubt, complete independence would be secured  for each woman by the civilized state, or in other words by the  whole body of men, who do the hard work of the world, and who would  collectively guarantee every necessary and luxury to every woman of  the community equally. In that way alone could perfect liberty of  choice and action be secured for women; and she held it just that  women should so be provided for, because the mothers of the  community fulfil in the state as important and necessary a function  as the men themselves do. It would be well, too, that the mothers  should be free to perform that function without preoccupation of  any sort. So a free world would order things. But in our present  barbaric state of industrial slavery, capitalism, monopoly,--in  other words under the organized rule of selfishness,--such a course  was impossible. Perhaps, as an intermediate condition, it might  happen in time that the women of certain classes would for the most  part be made independent at maturity each by her own father; which  would produce for them in the end pretty much the same general  effect of freedom. She saw as a first step the endowment of the  daughter. But meanwhile there was nothing for it save that as many  women as could should aim for themselves at economic liberty, in  other words at self-support. That was an evil in itself, because  obviously the prospective mothers of a community should be relieved  as far as possible front the stress and strain of earning a  livelihood; should be set free to build up their nervous systems to  the highest attainable level against the calls of maternity. But  above all things we must be practical; and in the practical world  here and now around us, no other way existed for women to be free  save the wasteful way of each earning her own livelihood.  Therefore she would continue her schoolwork with her pupils as long  as the school would allow her; and when that became impossible,  would fall back upon literature.    
One other question Alan ventured gently to raise,--the question of  children. Fools always put that question, and think it a crushing  one. Alan was no fool, yet it puzzled him strangely. He did not  see for himself how easy is the solution; how absolutely Herminia's  plan leaves the position unaltered. But Herminia herself was as  modestly frank on the subject as on every other. It was a moral  and social point of the deepest importance; and it would be wrong  of them to rush into it without due consideration. She had duly  considered it. She would give her children, should any come, the  unique and glorious birthright of being the only human beings ever  born into this world as the deliberate result of a free union,  contracted on philosophical and ethical principles. Alan hinted  certain doubts as to their up-bringing and education. There, too,  Herminia was perfectly frank. They would be half hers, half his;  the pleasant burden of their support, the joy of their education,  would naturally fall upon both parents equally. But why discuss  these matters like the squalid rich, who make their marriages a  question of settlements and dowries and business arrangements?  They two were friends and lovers; in love, such base doubts could  never arise. Not for worlds would she import into their mutual  relations any sordid stain of money, any vile tinge of bargaining.  They could trust one another; that alone sufficed for them.    
So Alan gave way bit by bit all along the line, overborne by  Herminia's more perfect and logical conception of her own  principles. She knew exactly what she felt and wanted; while he  knew only in a vague and formless way that his reason agreed with  her.    
A week later, he knocked timidly one evening at the door of a  modest little workman-looking cottage, down a small side street in  the back-wastes of Chelsea. 'Twas a most unpretending street;  Bower Lane by name, full of brown brick houses, all as like as  peas, and with nothing of any sort to redeem their plain fronts  from the common blight of the London jerry-builder. Only a soft  serge curtain and a pot of mignonette on the ledge of the window,  distinguished the cottage at which Alan Merrick knocked from the  others beside it. Externally that is to say; for within it was as  dainty as Morris wall-papers and merino hangings and a delicate  feminine taste in form and color could make it. Keats and Shelley  lined the shelves; Rossetti's wan maidens gazed unearthly from the  over-mantel. The door was opened for him by Herminia in person;  for she kept no servant,--that was one of her principles. She was  dressed from head to foot in a simple white gown, as pure and sweet  as the soul it covered. A white rose nestled in her glossy hair;  three sprays of white lily decked a vase on the mantel-piece. Some  dim survival of ancestral ideas made Herminia Barton so array  herself in the white garb of affiance for her bridal evening. Her  cheek was aglow with virginal shrinking as she opened the door, and  welcomed Alan in. But she held out her hand just as frankly as  ever to the man of her free choice as he advanced to greet her.  Alan caught her in his arms and kissed her forehead tenderly. And  thus was Herminia Barton's espousal consummated.
