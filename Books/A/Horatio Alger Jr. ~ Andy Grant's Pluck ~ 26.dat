Andy told Mr. Crawford about the poor family he had visited, and what he had done to help them.
&ldquo;You must let me refund the money, Andy,&rdquo; said his employer. &ldquo;Five dollars is a good deal for a boy to give.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don't forget that I have a double income, Mr. Crawford. I would prefer that this money should come from me. If you are willing to give another five dollars, it will be appreciated.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then I will make it ten. Will you take charge of this bill and give it to Mrs. Carter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure, Mr. Crawford. You have no idea what happiness it will give the family.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am glad you called my attention to their needs. If I could do anything more to help them-&rdquo;
&ldquo;You can if you know anyone who wants a typewriter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is the boy able to work a typewriter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, but the mother is. Before her marriage she was in a lawyer's office.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is a fortunate suggestion. I have a college friend-a classmate at Columbia-Mr. Gardner, who has just parted with his typewriter, who is about to be married.&rdquo;
&ldquo;May I call at his office, and ask for the situation for Mrs. Carter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes; it is on Nassau Street.&rdquo;
Andy seized his hat and went over to the lawyer's office.
It was at 132 Nassau Street, in the Vanderbilt Building. He went up in the elevator and found Mr. Gardner in.
&ldquo;I come from Mr. Crawford,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;He says you need a typewriter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Are you a typewriter?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No; I ask for the position for a lady;&rdquo; and he told the story.
&ldquo;You say she has had experience in a lawyer's office?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That will make her more desirable. When can she call?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will have her here to-morrow morning at any hour.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Say ten o'clock-a little before, perhaps.&rdquo;
The lawyer was a pleasant-looking man of medium age, and Andy felt sure that he would be a kind and considerate employer.
After office hours, and before going up to his pupil, Andy called at the humble home of Mrs. Carter. The widow's face brightened as she saw him.
&ldquo;You are my good friend,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You are welcome.&rdquo;
&ldquo;My employer, Mr. Crawford, sends you this,&rdquo; and Andy displayed the bill.
&ldquo;It is a godsend. It will enable me to pay my rent, due on Saturday, and give me three dollars over.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But that is not all. I have procured you a situation as typewriter in a lawyer's office. You will have to be&nbsp;on hand to-morrow morning a little before ten. The office is Mr. Gardner's, at 132 Nassau Street.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can hardly believe in my good fortune, I will be there.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can you leave the children?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will ask my neighbor, Mrs. Parker, to look after them. What a good young man you are!&rdquo; she exclaimed, gratefully.
&ldquo;Not young man-boy,&rdquo; corrected Andy, with a smile,
&ldquo;Won't you stay and take a cup of tea?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Carter, but I have an evening engagement. Oh, by the way, I forgot to say that Mr. Gardner will pay you ten dollars a week.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I shall feel rich. I shall no longer be worried by thoughts of starvation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sometime you might consult Mr. Gardner about your brother-in-law's withholding your share of the estate. He will be able to advise you.&rdquo;
Andy felt a warm glow in his heart at the thought of the happiness he had been instrumental in bringing to the poor family. He had learned the great lesson that some never learn, that there is nothing so satisfactory as helping others. We should have a much better world if that was generally understood.
The next day Andy received a letter from his stanch friend, Valentine Burns. He read it eagerly, for it brought him some home news, and in spite of his success he had not forgotten Arden and his many friends there..
This was the&nbsp;letter:
<!-- -->
&ldquo;D<small>EAR</small> A<small>NDY</small> : How long it seems since I saw you! You know that you were my most intimate friend, and of course I miss you very much. To be sure, there is Conrad, who seems willing to bestow his company upon me, as my father happens to be pretty well off, but I look upon Conrad as a snob, and don't care much about him. When wve met yesterday, he inquired after you.
&ldquo;'What's your friend, Andy Grant, doing in the city?'
&ldquo;'He is in a real estate office,' I replied.
&ldquo;'Humph! how much does he get paid?'
&ldquo;'Five dollars.'
&ldquo;'That is probably more than he earns, but it isn't much to live upon.'
&ldquo;I didn't care to tell him that you had another income, but said: 'Don't you think you could live on it?'
&ldquo;'I couldn't live on ten dollars a week,' said Conrad, loftily. 'But, then, I haven't been accustomed to live like Andy Grant.'
&ldquo;It must be pleasant to you to know that Conrad feels so much interest in your welfare.
&ldquo;Sometimes I see your father. He looks careworn. I suppose he is thinking of the difficult position in which he is placed. I am sorry to say that last week he lost his best cow by some disease. I heard that he valued it at fifty dollars. I hope that you won't let this worry you. The tide will turn sometime. I saw your mother day before yesterday. She is glad of your success, but of course she misses you. She always receives me very cordially, knowing that we are intimate friends.
&ldquo;I wish I could see you, Andy. You have no idea how I miss you. I like quite a number of the boys, but none is so near to me as you were.
&ldquo;Well, Andy, I must close. Come to Arden soon, if you can. It will do us good to see you, and I think even&nbsp;Conrad will be glad, as it will give him a chance to pump you as to your position.<p align=&quot;center&quot;
<right>&ldquo;Your affectionate friend,
<right>&ldquo;V<small>ALENTINE</small> B<small>URNS</small>.&rdquo;

&ldquo;So father has lost his best cow-old Whitey,&rdquo; said Andy, thoughtfully. &ldquo;If I were not owing money to Mr. Crawford for the land in Tacoma I would buy him a new one, but sometime I hope the land will be valuable, and then I can make the loss good to father.&rdquo;
The reader has not, I hope, forgotten Andy's fellow lodger, S. Byron Warren. Mr. Warren was always writing something for the <i>Century</i>, the <i>Atlantic</i>, or some other leading magazine, but never had been cheered by an acceptance. The magazine editors seemed leagued against him.
But one evening when Andy returned from the office, be found Mr. Warren beaming with complacence.
&ldquo;You look happy to-night, Mr. Warren,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the author; &ldquo;look at that.&rdquo;
He held out to Andy an eight-page paper called <i> The Weekly Magnet</i>, and pointed out a story of two columns on the second page. Under the title Andy read, &ldquo;By S. Byron Warren.&rdquo; It was called &ldquo;The Magician's Spell; A Tale of Sunny Spain.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;When did you write the story?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Last winter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How does it happen to be published so late ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You see, I sent it first to <i>Scribner's</i>, then to&nbsp;<i>Harper's</i> and then to the <i>Atlantic</i>. They didn't seem to fancy it, so I sent it to the <i>Magnet</i>.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hope they paid you for it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Warren, proudly. &ldquo;They gave me a dollar and a half for it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Isn't that rather small?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, it is small, but the paper is poor. The editor wrote to me that he would be glad to pay me ten dollars for such a sketch when they are more prosperous.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I suppose you will write again? You must feel greatly encouraged.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have been writing another story to-day. I shall mail it to them to-morrow.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hope the <i> Magnet</i> will prosper for your sake.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you. I hope so, too. Ah, Andy, you don't know how it seems to see your own words in print!&rdquo; said the author.
&ldquo;I am afraid I never shall, Mr. Warren. I was not intended for an author.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, I think you might write something,&rdquo; said patronizingly.
&ldquo;No; I shall leave the literary field to you.&rdquo;
