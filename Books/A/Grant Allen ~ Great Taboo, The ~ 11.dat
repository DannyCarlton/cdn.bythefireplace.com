Toward midnight Muriel began to doze lightly from pure fatigue.    
"Put a pillow under her head, and let her sleep," Felix said in a  whisper. "Poor child, it would be cruel to send her alone to-night into  her own quarters."    
And Mali slipped a pillow of mulberry paper under her mistress's head,  and laid it on her own lap, and bent down to watch her.    
But outside, beyond the line, the natives murmured loud their discontent.  "The Queen of the Clouds stays in the King of the Rain's hut to-night,"  they muttered, angrily. "She will not listen to us. Before morning, be  sure, the Tempest will be born of their meeting to destroy us."    
About two o'clock there came a lull in the wind, which had been rising  steadily ever since that lurid sunset. Felix looked out of the hut door.  The moon was full. It was almost as clear as day with the bright tropical  moonlight, silvery in the open, pale green in the shadow. The people were  still squatting in great rings round the hut, just outside the taboo  line, and beating gongs, and sticks and human bones, to keep time to the  lilt of their lugubrious litany.    
The air felt unusually heavy and oppressive. Felix raised his eyes to the  sky, and saw whisps of light cloud drifting in rapid flight over the  scudding moon. Below, an ominous fog bank gathered steadily westward.  Then one clap of thunder rent the sky. After it came a deadly silence.  The moon was veiled. All was dark as pitch. The natives themselves fell  on their faces and prayed with mute lips. Three minutes later, the  cyclone had burst upon them in all its frenzy.    
Such a hurricane Felix had never before experienced. Its energy was  awful. Round the palm-trees the wind played a frantic and capricious  devil's dance. It pirouetted about the atoll in the mad glee of  unconsciousness. Here and there it cleared lanes, hundreds of yards in  length, among the forest-trees and the cocoanut plantations. The noise of  snapping and falling trunks rang thick on the air. At times the cyclone  would swoop down from above upon the swaying stem of some tall and  stately palm that bent like grass before the wind, break it off short  with a roar at the bottom, and lay it low at once upon the ground, with a  crash like thunder. In other places, little playful whirlwinds seemed to  descend from the sky in the very midst of the dense brushwood, where they  cleared circular patches, strewn thick under foot with trunks and  branches in their titanic sport, and yet left unhurt all about the  surrounding forest. Then again a special cyclone of gigantic proportions  would advance, as it were, in a single column against one stem of a  clump, whirl round it spirally like a lightning flash, and, deserting it  for another, leave it still standing, but turned and twisted like a screw  by the irresistible force of its invisible fingers. The storm-god, said  Toko, was dancing with the palm-trees. The sight was awful. Such  destructive energy Felix had never even imagined before. No wonder the  savages all round beheld in it the personal wrath of some mighty spirit.    
For in spite of the black clouds they could <i>see</i> it all--both the  Europeans and the islanders. The intense darkness of the night was  lighted up for them every minute by an almost incessant blaze of sheet  and forked lightning. The roar of the thunder mingled with the roar of  the tempest, each in turn overtopping and drowning the other. The hut  where Felix and Muriel sheltered themselves shook before the storm; the  very ground of the island trembled and quivered--like the timbers of a  great ship before a mighty sea--at each onset of the breakers upon the  surrounding fringe-reef. And side by side with it all, to crown their  misery, wild torrents of rain, descending in waterspouts, as it seemed,  or dashed in great sheets against the roof of their frail tenement,  poured fitfully on with fierce tropical energy.    
In the midst of the hut Muriel crouched and prayed with bloodless lips to  Heaven. This was too, too terrible. It seemed incredible to her that on  top of all they had been called upon to suffer of fear and suspense at  the hands of the savages, the very dumb forces of nature themselves  should thus be stirred up to open war against them. Her faith in  Providence was sorely tried. Dumb forces, indeed! Why, they roared with  more terrible voices than any wild beast on earth could possibly compass.  The thunder and the wind were howling each other down in emulous din, and  the very hiss of the lightning could be distinctly heard, like some huge  snake, at times above the creaking and snapping of the trees before the  gale in the surrounding forest.    
Muriel crouched there long, in the mute misery of utter despair. At her  feet Mali crouched too, as frightened as herself, but muttering aloud  from time to time, in a reproachful voice, "I tell Missy Queenie what  going to happen. I warn her not. I tell her she must not eat that very  bad storm-apple. But Missy Queenie no listen. Her take her own way, then  storm come down upon us."    
And Felix's Shadow, in his own tongue, exclaimed more than once in the  self-same tone, half terror, half expostulation, "See now what comes from  breaking taboo? You eat the storm-fruit. The storm-fruit suits ill with  the King of the Rain and the Queen of the Clouds. The heavens have broken  loose. The sea has boiled. See what wind and what flood you are bringing  upon us."    
By and by, above even the fierce roar of the mingled thunder and cyclone,  a wild orgy of noise burst upon them all from without the hut. It was a  sound as of numberless drums and tom-toms, all beaten in unison with the  mad energy of fear; a hideous sound, suggestive of some hateful heathen  devil-worship. Muriel clapped her hands to her ears in horror. "Oh,  what's that?" she cried to Felix, at this new addition to their endless  alarms. "Are the savages out there rising in a body? Have they come to  murder us?"    
"Perhaps," Felix said, smoothing her hair with his hand, as a mother  might soothe her terrified child, "perhaps they're angry with us for  having caused this storm, as they think, by our foolish action. I believe  they all set it down to our having unluckily eaten that unfortunate  fruit. I'll go out to the door myself and speak to them."    
Muriel clung to his arm with a passionate clinging.    
"Oh, Felix," she cried, "no! Don't leave me here alone. My darling, I  love you. You're all the world there is left to me now, Felix. Don't go  out to those wretches and leave me here alone. They'll murder you!  they'll murder you! Don't go out, I implore you. If they mean to kill us,  let them kill us both together, in one another's arms. Oh, Felix, I am  yours, and you are mine, my darling!"    
It was the first time either of them had acknowledged the fact; but  there, before the face of that awful convulsion of nature, all the little  deceptions and veils of life seemed rent asunder forever as by a flash of  lightning. They stood face to face with each other's souls, and forgot  all else in the agony of the moment. Felix clasped the trembling girl in  his arms like a lover. The two Shadows looked on and shook with silent  terror. If the King of the Rain thus embraced the Queen of the Clouds  before their very eyes, amid so awful a storm, what unspeakable effects  might not follow at once from it! But they had too much respect for those  supernatural creatures to attempt to interfere with their action at such  a moment. They accepted their masters almost as passively as they  accepted the wind and the thunder, which they believed to arise from  them.    
Felix laid his poor Muriel tenderly down on the mud floor again. "I  <i>must</i> go out, my child," he said. "For the very love of <i>you</i>, I must  play the man, and find out what these savages mean by their drumming."    
He crept to the door of the hut (for no man could walk upright before  that awful storm), and peered out into the darkness once more, awaiting  one of the frequent flashes of lightning. He had not long to wait. In a  moment the sky was all ablaze again from end to end, and continued so  for many seconds consecutively. By the light of the continuous zigzags  of fire, Felix could see for himself that hundreds and hundreds of  natives--men, women, and children, naked, or nearly so, with their hair  loose and wet about their cheeks--lay flat on their faces, many courses  deep, just outside the taboo line. The wind swept over them with  extraordinary force, and the tropical rain descended in great floods upon  their bare backs and shoulders. But the savages, as if entranced, seemed  to take no heed of all these earthly things. They lay grovelling in the  mud before some unseen power; and beating their tom-toms in unison, with  barbaric concord, they cried aloud once more as Felix appeared, in a  weird litany that overtopped the tumultuous noise of the tempest, "Oh,  Storm-God, hear us! Oh, great spirit, deliver us! King of the Rain and  Queen of the Clouds, befriend us! Be angry no more! Hide your wrath from  your people! Take away your hurricane, and we will bring you many gifts.  Eat no longer of the storm-apple--the seed of the wind--and we will feed  you with yam and turtle, and much choice bread-fruit. Great king, we are  yours; you shall choose which you will of our children for your meat and  drink; you shall sup on our blood. But take your storm away; do not  utterly drown and submerge our island!"    
As they spoke they crawled nearer and nearer, with gliding serpentine  motion, till their heads almost touched the white line of coral. But not  a man of them all went one inch beyond it. They stopped there and gazed  at him. Felix signed to them with his hand, and pointed vaguely to the  sky, as much as to say <i>he</i> was not responsible. At the gesture the whole  assembly burst into one loud shout of gratitude. "He has heard us, he has  heard us!" they exclaimed, with a perfect wail of joy. "He will not  utterly destroy us. He will take away his storm. He will bring the sun  and the moon back to us."    
Felix returned into the hut, somewhat reassured so far as the attitude of  the savages went. "Don't be afraid of them, Muriel," he cried, taking her  passionately once more in a tender embrace. "They daren't cross the  taboo. They won't come near; they're too frightened themselves to dream  of hurting us."
