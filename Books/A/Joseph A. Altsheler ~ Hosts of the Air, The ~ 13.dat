It snowed all that day and all the next night. The lateness of the  season seemed to add to the violence of the storm, as if it would make  one supreme effort on these heights before yielding to the coming  spring. Many of the pines were blown down, and the snow lay several feet  deep everywhere. Now and then they heard thunderous sounds from the  gorges telling them that great slides were taking place, and it was  absolutely certain now that no one from the valley below could reach the  lodge for days.    
The sight from the windows of the house, when the driving snow thinned  enough to permit a view, was magnificent. They saw far away peak on peak  and ridge on ridge, clothed in white, and sometimes they beheld the  valley filled with vast clouds of mists and vapors. Once John thought he  caught a glimpse of Zillenstein, a menacing gray shadow far below, but  the clouds in an instant floated between and he was not sure.    
Yet it was a period of enchantment in the life of John Scott. Their very  isolation on the mountain, with Suzanne there in the double role of  servant and guardian, seemed to draw Julie and him more closely  together. The world had practically melted away beneath their feet. The  great war was gone for them. He was only twenty-two, but his experience  had made him mentally much older, and she, too, had gained in knowledge  and command of herself by all through which she had passed.    
She showed to John a spirit and courage which he had never seen  surpassed in any woman, and mingled with it all was a lightness and wit  that filled the whole house with sunshine, despite the great storm that  raged continually without. In the music-room was a piano, and she played  upon it the beautiful French "little songs" that John loved. There were  books and magazines in plenty, and now he read to her and then she read  to him. Sometimes they sat in silence and through the thick glass of the  windows watched the snow driving by.    
The hours were too few for John. He served her as the crusader served  his chosen lady. The spirit of the old knights of chivalry that had  descended upon him still held him in a spell that he did not wish to  break. Often she mocked at him and laughed at him, and then he liked her  all the better. No placid, submissive woman, shrinking before the  dangers, would have pleased him. In her light laughter and her banter,  even at his expense, he read a noble courage and a lofty soul, and in  their singular isolation it was given to him to see her spirit, so  strong and yet so rarely sweet in a manner that the circumstances of  ordinary life could never have brought forth. And the faithful Suzanne,  still in her double role of servant and guardian, served and guarded  them both.    
John at this time began to feel a more forgiving spirit toward  Auersperg. It might well be that this man of middle years, so thoroughly  surrounded by old, dead things that he had never seen the world as it  really was, had been bewitched. A sort of moon madness had made him  commit his extraordinary deed, and John could view it with increasing  tolerance because he had been bewitched himself.    
He made another and more extended survey of their stores and confirmed  his first opinion that the lodge was furnished in full princely style.  They need not lack for any of the comforts, nor for many luxuries, no  matter how long they remained.    
On the morning of the third day the storm ceased and they looked out  upon a white, shining world of snow, lofty and impressive, peaks and  ridges outlined sharply against a steel-blue sky. John had found a pair  of powerful glasses in the lodge and with them he was now able to make  out Zillenstein quite clearly. Clothed in snow, a castle all in white,  it was nevertheless more menacing than ever.    
John believed that Muller would surely come, and many and many a time he  thought over the problem how to deal with him. But the new, windless day  passed and there was no sign of the forester. John himself went forth,  breaking paths here and there through the snow, but he discovered  nothing. He began to believe that Muller had been forced to take shelter  at the start of the storm and could not now return. His hope that it was  so strong that his mind turned it into a fact, and Muller disappeared  from his thoughts.    
The garage, besides the great automobile, contained a smaller one, but  John kept the limousine in mind. He intended when the time came to  escape in it with the two women, if possible. There might be a road  leading down the other side of the mountain, and toward Italy. If so, he  would surely try to get through when the melting of the snow permitted.    
Meanwhile he devoted himself with uncommon zest to household duties. He  cleared new paths about the lodge, moved in much of the wood where it  would be more convenient for Suzanne, cleaned and polished the guns and  revolvers in the little armory, inspected the limousine and put it in  perfect order, and did everything else that he could think of to make  their mountain castle luxurious and defensible.    
Julie often joined him in these tasks, and John did not remonstrate,  knowing that work and occupation kept a mind healthy. Wrapped in her  great red cloak and wearing the smallest pair of high boots that he  could find in the lodge, she often shoveled snow with him, as he  increased the number of runways to the small outlying buildings, or to  other parts of their domain. Thus they filled up the hours and prevented  the suspense which otherwise would have been acute, despite their  comfortable house.    
She continually revealed herself to him now. The shell that encloses a  young French girl had been broken by the hammer of war and she had  stepped forth, a woman with a thinking and reasoning mind of uncommon  power. It seemed often to John that the soul of the great Lannes had  descended upon this slender maid who was of his own blood. Like many  another American, he had thought often of those marshals of Napoleon who  had risen from obscurity to such heights, and of them all, the  republican and steadfast Lannes had been his favorite. Her spirit was  the same. He found in it a like simplicity and courage. They seldom  talked of the war, but when they did she expressed unbounded faith in  the final triumph of her nation and of those allied with it.    
"I have read what the world was saying of France," she said one day when  they stood together on the snowy slope. "We hear, we girls, although we  are mostly behind the walls. They have told us that we were declining as  a nation, and many of our own people believed it."    
"The charge will never be made again against the French Republic," said  John. "The French, by their patience and courage in the face of  preliminary defeat and their dauntless resolution, have won the  admiration of all the world."    
"And many Americans are fighting for us. Tell me, John, why did you join  our armies?"    
"An accident first, as you know. There was that meeting with your  brother at the Austrian border, and my appearance in the apparent role  of a spy, and then my great sympathy with the French, who I thought and  still think were attacked by a powerful and prepared enemy bent upon  their destruction. Then I thought and still think that France and  England represent democracy against absolutism, and then, although  every one of these reasons is powerful enough alone, yet another has  influenced me strongly."    
"And what is that other, John?"    
"It's intangible, Julie. It has been weighed and measured by nearly all  the great philosophers, but I don't think any two of them have ever  agreed about the result."    
"You are a philosopher, sir, too, are you not? How do you define it?"    
"I don't know that I've arrived at any conclusion."    
"And yet, John, I thought that you were a man of decision."    
"That's irony, Julie. But men of decision perhaps are puzzled by it more  than anybody else."    
"Then you can neither describe it nor give it a name?"    
"It has names, several--but most of them are misleading," said John,  thoughtfully.    
"So you leave it to me to discover what this mysterious influence may  be, or to remain forever in ignorance of it."    
In her dark red cloak with tendrils of the deep golden hair showing at  the edge of her hood, she seemed to John a very sprite of the snows, and  the blue eyes said clearly to the gray:    
"I know!"    
And the gray answered back in the same language:    
"I know!"    
Nevertheless John would not let words betray him. He thought that the  mountain and their isolation gave him an unfair advantage, and the young  crusader upon whom the mantle of chivalry had descended had too  knightly a soul to use it, at least in speech.    
"And so, sir," she said, "you will not venture upon such an abstruse  subject?"    
"No, I think not. I don't believe you could call it an evasion, but  perhaps it's fear."    
"Fear of what, John?"    
"I'm not sure about that, either. Perhaps elsewhere and under more  suitable circumstances I may be able to put my thought into words,  precise and understandable. It will take time, but that I shall do so  some day I have no doubt."    
She looked away, and then the two, the snow shovels in their hands,  walked back gravely to the lodge. Suzanne stood in the doorway watching  them. She knew that they were wholly oblivious of her presence, that  they had not even seen her, yet the heart of the stern peasant woman was  warm within her, although she felt that she now had two children instead  of one under her care.    
Neither was Suzanne given up wholly to the present. She spent many  anxious hours thinking of the future. The deep snow could not last  forever. Already there was a warmer breath in the air. When it began to  melt it would go fast, and then Auersperg--if he were still at  Zillenstein--eaten up with impatience and anger because he could hear  nothing from the lodge, would act, and he would show no mercy to the  young man with the brown hair and the gray eyes, who was now walking by  the side of her beloved Julie.    
John himself took notice the next day of the signs. Spring, which  already held sway in the lowlands, was creeping up the slope of the  highlands. The sun was distinctly warmer and tiny rivulets of water  flowed along the edges of the runways. In a few more days retainers of  Auersperg or troops would come up the mountain. The prince himself might  have been compelled to return to the war, but he would certainly leave  orders in capable hands. John never deluded himself for a moment upon  that subject. His shoveling in the snow made him quite sure now that a  road led over the mountain and southward, and he had made up his mind to  take the automobile and the two women and try it, as soon as the snow  melted enough to permit of such an attempt. One might get through, and  he had proved for himself that fortune favors the daring.    
In his explorations on the southern slope he came to a deep gulch in  which the tops of scrub pines showed above the snow. Following its edge  for some distance his eye at length was caught by a dark shape on the  rocks. He climbed slowly and painfully down to it and saw the body of a  man, clothed like a German forester. His neck and many of his bones were  broken, and his body was bruised frightfully.    
John had no doubt that it was the missing Muller, and it was altogether  likely that in the storm he had made a misstep, and had fallen into the  ravine to instant death.    
"What are you going to do?" asked Julie, who saw him going out, spade on  shoulder.    
"I've found Muller at last," he replied soberly.    
"Oh! I am sorry!" she said, shuddering as she looked at the spade.    
"It's all I can do for him now."    
"I'm glad you thought to do as much."    
When John returned he had carefully wiped all the earth from the snow  shovel. The subject of Muller was never again mentioned by either of  them, and while he experienced sorrow for a man whom he had never seen  and who was an official enemy, he felt that a shadow was lifted from  them.    
The sun grew much warmer the next day, and the snow began to melt fast.  The rivulets in the runways swelled rapidly. The snow sank inch by inch,  and warm winds blew on the slopes. The pines were now clear and little  rivers were running down every ravine and gulch. The thunder of great  masses of snow, loosened by the thaw and gathering weight as they rolled  down the mountain side, came to their ears. The sky was a brilliant  blue, pouring down continuous warm beams, and it was obvious that it  would not be long before the automobile road was clear. Then the blue  eyes turned a questioning gaze upon the gray.    
"Yes, I'm preparing for us to go soon," said John.    
"Which way?" asked Julie.    
"Toward Italy, I think."    
"Is it possible for us to get through?"    
"I don't know. The hardships and the dangers undoubtedly will be great."    
"But one can endure them."    
"You have little to fear. Prince Karl of Auersperg offers you  morganatic marriage, and he thinks that he is honoring you."    
"But do you, John, think that he is honoring me?"    
"Although you would probably be a mere countess and not a princess, your  position nevertheless would be great in most continental eyes, far  grander than if you were to marry some obscure republican."    
"You haven't answered me. Do you think the Prince of Auersperg would be  honoring me?"    
"I'm not a judge to make decisions. I'm merely stating the facts on  either side."    
"But suppose I should meet this simple and obscure republican and,  through some singular chance, should happen to love him, would it not be  better for my pride and more promising for my happiness to marry him on  terms of full equality rather than to marry Prince Karl of Auersperg, a  man old enough to be my father, and yet remain all my life his inferior?  As we understand it in France and as you understand it in America,  republicanism means equality, does it not, sir?"    
"If it doesn't mean that it means nothing."    
"Then, sir, being what I am, you may be sure that I shall not stay here  to await Prince Karl of Auersperg, and his unsought honors."    
"You are the judge, Julie, after all, and I believed it was the decision  you would make. Yet, it was only fair to lay the full facts before you."    
John knew that the attempt to escape southward through the mountains  would be attended by great danger, not only from the Austrians, but  from the risks of the road itself, when the great automobile, slipping  on melting snow and ice, might go crashing at any moment into a gorge.  Yet it must be done. Another day brought home the extreme necessity of  it. All the mountains thundered with the sliding snow, and the prince's  men would certainly come soon.    
The garage contained an ample supply of gasoline and extra tires, and  John saw that the machine was in perfect order. He also stored in it  clothing, food for many days, two rifles and many cartridges. It was  thus at once a carriage, a home and a fortress. Then he told Julie that  they must start the next morning. Enough snow was gone to disclose the  road leading southward, and he believed that he could drive the  limousine down the mountain.    
"Are you willing to trust yourself to me, Julie?" he asked.    
"Through everything," she replied.    
Suzanne also was eager to go, and, in her character now as a full member  of the little company, she did not hesitate to say so.    
"Our comfort here may cause us to linger too long, sir," she said to  John, when Julie was not present. "My mistress has been twice in the  hands of the Prince of Auersperg and twice through you she has escaped  him. There is certain death for you if he finds you and I know not what  for my mistress if she should be taken by him once more. Hardened by his  years and her resistance he would seek to break her. It has seemed to  me sometimes, sir, that you were sent by God to save us."    
The woman's faith, which had so completely replaced her original  distrust and hostility, moved John.    
"Suzanne," he said, "she shall never again be in the power of that man.  I don't know what the future holds for us, but I think I can promise her  escape from Auersperg."    
"And others will come to help us," said Suzanne, with all the intensity  of a prophetess. "You left word, you have said, which way you were  going, and it will reach Monsieur Philip. It will not be so hard to  trace us to Zillenstein, and he will surely follow. He flies in the air  like the eagle, and we will see him some day black against the sky."    
The two by the same impulse looked up. But there was nothing showing in  the blue vault, save feathery white clouds. Nevertheless the faith of  neither was dimmed.    
"I feel the certainty of it, too," said John. "Philip and the <i>Arrow</i>  will answer to our call."    
"And my father," said Suzanne in the same tones of unshakable faith. "He  was left a prisoner in Munich, but few prisons can hold Antoine Picard.  He will surely seek us through all the mountains."    
John's faith was already strong, but Suzanne's made it stronger. A high  nature always tries to deserve the trust it receives. Early the  following morning the automobile was ready, and Julie and Suzanne,  wrapped in their cloaks, took their places inside. John stood beside it,  in chauffeur's garb with cap and glasses.    
"It's the last look at the lodge, Julie," he said. "When the Prince of  Auersperg built it he never dreamed that it would serve as a refuge for  those who were escaping from him. But it hasn't been such a bad home,  has it?"    
"No," she replied. "It will always have a place among my pleasant  memories."    
"And among mine."    
He sprang into his seat and grasped the wheel. The automobile began a  slow and cautious descent of the mountain's southward slope. However  reluctant one is to prepare for a start there is invariably a certain  elation after the start is made, and John felt the uplift now. He could  not yet see his way out of Austria, but he felt that he would find it.  He did not even know where their present road led, except that it  disappeared in a valley, filled with mists and vapors from the melting  snows.    
John had preserved the pass given to him by the German officer, and  thinking he might be able to make use of it again, he dropped the name  of John Scott once more and returned to that of Jean Castel, asking  Julie and Suzanne to remember the change, whenever they should meet  anyone. But it was a long before they saw a human being.    
They came at last to the bottom of a narrow valley, and the strain of  driving under such dangerous circumstances had been so great that John  felt compelled to take a rest of a half-hour. Julie descended from the  machine and walked back and forth in the road. They saw that they were  in a narrow valley down which flowed a stream, much swollen by the  melting snow. But the grass and foliage were heavy here and the air was  warm.    
"I have resolved, Julie," said John, "to say, if we are pressed closely,  that you are a lady of the household of the Prince of Auersperg,  accompanied by your maid, and that, wishing to get out of the war zone,  I'm deputed to carry you to the port of Trieste. I can't think of  anything else that seems likely to serve us better."    
"We're in your hands."    
"Aye, so we are, sir," said the bold Suzanne, "but we also have hands of  our own and can help."    
"I know it, Suzanne, and I know that you will not fail when the time  comes."    
Julie returned to the machine and John put his hand on the wheel again,  finding it a great relief to drive on a fairly level road. Throughout  the descent of the slope he had been in fear of skidding and a fatal  smash. Although much snow was left on the crests and sides of the  mountains, none was visible in the valley, and the great mass of green  foliage was restful to the eye.    
"The first inhabitant to greet us," said John.    
A man driving a flock of sheep was coming toward them. He was a sturdy  fellow, with a red feather in his cap, which was cocked a bit saucily on  one side of his head. It was evident that he was a shepherd, whose sheep  had been driven into the lowlands by the storm. John, both from prudence  and natural consideration, brought his machine down to a slow pace, and  spoke pleasantly to the man, who was looking at them with much  curiosity.    
"We're from the family of the Prince of Auersperg," said John, "and  we're making our way toward the coast. The prince wishes a lady whom he  esteems very highly to reach Trieste as soon as possible. Where can we  find the best inn for the night?"    
"The village of Tellnitz, which you should reach about dark, has a  famous inn, and there is no finer landlord than Herr Leinfelder."    
John thanked him, and drove on, increasing his speed, after he had  passed the sheep. He looked back once, and saw the shepherd placidly  driving his flock before him. He was singing, too, and the musical notes  came to them, telling them very clearly that one Austrian, at least, did  not suspect them.    
"Our first test has been passed successfully," said John, "and I look  upon it as a good omen. But don't forget that I'm Jean Castel of  Lorraine, French by descent, but a devoted German subject, in the  service of the Prince of Auersperg. I intend that we shall pass the  night in the inn of the good Herr Leinfelder at Tellnitz, and I believe  that we will go on the next day still unsuspected. I've seen no  telephone wires in the valley, and doubtless there is no connection  between Zillenstein and Tellnitz."    
They passed more peasants, none of whom asked them any questions, but  they saw no soldiers.    
Toward night they beheld the usual lofty church spire, and then the  huddled houses of a small village. One rather larger than the others and  with a red-tiled roof John thought must be the inn of the good Herr  Leinfelder, and his surmise proved to be correct.    
"It's fortunate that you are blond," said John to Julie, "as most people  think the French are dark. Still, both you and Suzanne look French, and  I recommend that you do not take off your wraps until you go to your  room, and that you also have your dinner served there. It's best for  you, Mademoiselle Julie, to be seen as little as possible, and your role  as a great lady of the semi-royal house of Auersperg permits it. Now,  may I lay the injunction upon both you and Suzanne that you permit me to  do all the talking?"    
"I obey," said Julie, "but I'm not so sure of Suzanne."    
"I never talk unless it's needful for me to speak," said Suzanne with  dignity.    
Many eyes watched the great limousine as it rolled into Tellnitz, and  stopped before the excellent inn of Herr Johann Ignatz Leinfelder. Herr  Leinfelder himself appeared upon the gravel, his round red face beaming  at the sight of guests, evidently of importance, at a time when so few  guests of any kind at all came. John in his role of chauffeur said to  him with an air of importance:    
"A lady of the family of Prince Karl of Auersperg, on her way to  Trieste. She wishes a room, the very best room you have, to which she  can retire with her maid and seek the rest she so badly needs after her  long journey over bad roads."    
The good Herr Leinfelder bowed low. John's manner impressed him. It was  a perfect reproduction of the style affected by the flunkies of the  great.    
"We have a splendid chamber for the princess and a smaller one adjoining  for her maid," said the host. "It's an honor to Tellnitz and to me that  a lady of the house of Auersperg should stop at my inn. The prince  himself, we hear, has returned to the great war."    
"Ah!" said John, but there was immense satisfaction under the subdued  "ah" over the important information coming to him by mere chance. He  opened the door for Julie and Suzanne to alight, and still heavily  muffled they were bowed into the house by Herr Leinfelder.    
"I shall be on guard tonight," whispered John to Julie, as she passed.  "Did you hear him say that the Prince of Auersperg had gone back to the  war?"    
She nodded as she disappeared into the interior of the inn, and he knew  that a weight had been lifted from her heart also. The pursuit surely  could not be so fierce and lasting when the one who gave it impulse was  gone.    
There was a small garage behind the inn, and the great automobile almost  filled it, but John, clinging to his role of chauffeur, which was  expedient in every sense, would not trust it to any of the servants of  the hotel. He inspected it carefully himself, saw that everything was in  proper order, and not until then did he enter the inn in search of food  and fire.    
"My mistress?" he asked of August, the head waiter. "Has she been  properly served? His Highness, Prince Karl of Auersperg, will not  forget it if a lady of his family does not receive the deference due to  her."    
"Dinner has just been served to the princess," said August,  deferentially, as the chauffeur's tone had been peremptory. "I return in  a moment myself to see that every detail is attended to properly."    
"Then look to it," said John, as he slipped a five-kronen piece into his  hand, "and see also that she is not disturbed afterward. Her Highness  wishes a good night's rest."    
August bowed low with gratitude and hurried away to do his commission.  John himself, as a man who carried gold, was treated with deference, and  he had an excellent dinner in a dining-room that contained but three or  four other guests. Here in accordance with his plan he talked rather  freely with Herr Leinfelder, and the few servants that the war had left  him.    
He enlarged upon the greatness of Prince Karl of Auersperg and the  ancient grandeur of his Castle of Zillenstein. He referred vaguely to  the young princess whom he escorted as a cousin or a niece, and spoke  complacently because he had been assigned to the important duty of  taking her to Trieste. There was need of haste, too. He knew his orders,  and he would start in the morning at the very first breath of dawn. He  was also empowered, if necessary, to fight for her safety. The rifles  and pistols in the automobile were sufficient proof of it, and he had  been trained to shoot by the Prince's head forester, Muller.    
Herr Johann Ignatz Leinfelder was much impressed. This young chauffeur  who spoke with such assurance was a fine, upstanding fellow, obviously  strong and brave, the very kind of a man whom a prince like Auersperg  would employ on a duty of such great importance. Hence, Herr Leinfelder  bowed lower than ever, when he spoke to John.    
After dinner, the waiter, August, came with word that the princess was  much refreshed and bade her chauffeur come to her apartments for orders.  He found her standing by a window with the watchful Suzanne hovering  near, but he did not speak until the waiter withdrew and closed the  door.    
The paleness begat by the long weariness of the ride was gone from her  face, the beautiful color flowing back in a full tide, and she stood up  straight and strong. The room was lighted by two tall candles, and the  glow in John's eyes was met by an answering glow in hers.    
"You think it wise to spend the night here?" she asked.    
"It seems to me that we should risk it. In the darkness the roads will  be dangerous from the melting snows. Nor should we exhaust ourselves in  the first stage of our flight. It's scarcely possible that any word from  Zillenstein can reach Tellnitz tonight and tomorrow we'll be far away.  What say you, Suzanne?"    
"I agree, sir, with you, who are our master here," replied Suzanne with  uncommon deference. "A start at dawn, and we can leave pursuit behind  for the present at least."    
Julie smiled a little at this proof that young Scott's conquest of her  stern maid was complete.    
"I'll bid Herr Leinfelder have breakfast for us at the earliest possible  moment," he said, "and now, I think it would be better for you two to  sleep, because tomorrow we may need all our strength. You know as well  as I the dangers that lie before us."    
Outside the door he was the haughty chauffeur again, the subservient  servant of Auersperg, and the arrogant patron of the innkeeper and  waiters. He secured a good room for himself, in which he slept until he  was called by his order at the first light of dawn, and he was assured  by the manner of Herr Leinfelder that no word of the fugitives had come  in the night.    
"Breakfast is ready for the princess," said the innkeeper, bowing.    
John knocked at her door, and she came forth at once, followed by  Suzanne, both fully dressed for the journey.    
"No alarm has yet come to Tellnitz," whispered John, as she passed.  "Remember that they think you a princess of the house of Auersperg, and  that we must start in a half-hour."    
He ate his own breakfast at another table, and within the appointed time  the great limousine was at the door. Herr Leinfelder and his staff had  no reason to change their belief that the lady of such manifest youth  and beauty was a princess, as their chauffeur gave gratuities in truly  royal style, and then whirled them away in a manner that was obviously  ducal.    
The morning was fresh and beautiful, silver as yet, since only an edge  of the sun was showing over the hills, but it was fragrant with the odor  of foliage and of wild flowers, blossoming in the nooks and crannies  under the slopes. John felt a great surge of the spirits and he sent the  machine forward at a rate that made the air rush in a swift current  behind them.    
"The first stage of our flight has been passed in safety," he said to  Julie.    
"It's an omen that we'll be as fortunate with the second."    
"And with the third."    
"And with all the others."    
She flashed him a brilliant smile, and John felt that he could drive  over any obstacle. He sent the machine forward faster than ever, and the  road stretched before them, long and white.
