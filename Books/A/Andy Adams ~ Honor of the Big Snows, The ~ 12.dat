  It was a long winter for Cummins and M&eacute;lisse. It was a longer one  for  Jan. He had taken with him a letter from the factor at Lac Bain to  the  factor at Churchill, and he found quarters with the chief clerk's   assistant at the post&#8212;a young, red-faced man who had come over on the   ship from England. He was a cheerful, good-natured young fellow, and   when he learned that his new associate had tramped all the way from   the Barren Lands to attend the new public school, he at once invested   himself with the responsibilities of a private tutor. 
  He taught Jan, first of all, to say &quot;is&quot; in place of &quot;ees.&quot; It was  a  tremendous lesson for Jan, but he struggled with it manfully, and a   week after his arrival, when one evening he was tuning his violin to   play for young MacDonald, he said with eager gravity: 
  &quot;Ah, I have it now, Mr. MacDonald. It ees not 'EES,' it ees 'EES!'&quot; 
  MacDonald roared, but persisted, and in time Jan began to get the   twist out of his tongue. 
  The school opened in November, and Jan found himself one of twenty  or  so, gathered there from forty thousand square miles of wilderness.  Two  white youths and a half-breed had come from the Etawney; the  factor at  Nelson House sent up his son, and from the upper waters of  the Little  Churchill there came three others. 
  From the first, Jan's music found him a premier place in the  interest  of the tutor sent over by the company. He studied by night as  well as  by day, and by the end of the second month his only competitor  was the  youth from Nelson House. His greatest source of knowledge was  not the  teacher, but MacDonald. There was in him no inherent desire  for the  learning of the people to the south. That he was storing away,  like a  faithful machine, for the use of M&eacute;lisse. But MacDonald gave  him that  for which his soul longed&#8212;a picture of life as it existed in  the  wonderful world beyond the wilderness, to which some strange  spirit  within him, growing stronger as the weeks and months passed,  seemed  projecting his hopes and his ambitions. 
  Between his thoughts of M&eacute;lisse and Lac Bain, he dreamed of that  other  world; and several times during the winter he took the little  roll  from the box of his violin, and read again and again the written  pages  that it contained. 
  &quot;Some time I will go,&quot; he assured himself always. &quot;Some time, when   M&eacute;lisse is a little older, and can go too.&quot; 
  To young MacDonald, the boy from Lac Bain was a &quot;find.&quot; The  Scottish  youth was filled with an immense longing for home; and as his   homesickness grew, he poured more and more into Jan's attentive ears   his knowledge of the world from which he had come. He told him the   history of the old brass cannon that lay abandoned among the vines and   bushes, where a fort had stood at Churchill many years before. He   described the coming of the first ship into the great bay; told of   Hudson and his men, of great wars that his listener had never dreamed   of, of kings and queens and strange nations. At night he read a great   deal to Jan out of books that he had brought over with him. 
  As the weeks and months passed, the strange spirit that was calling  to  the forest boy out of that other world stirred more restlessly  within  him. At times it urged him to confide in MacDonald what was  hidden  away in the box of his violin. 
  The secret nearly burst from him one Sunday, when MacDonald said: 
  &quot;I'm going home on the ship that comes over next summer. What do  you  say to going back with me, Jan?&quot; 
  The spirit surged through Jan in a hot flood, and it was only an   accident that kept him from saying what was in his heart. 
  They were standing with the icy bay stretching off in interminable   miles toward the pole. A little way from them, the restless tide was   beating up through the broken ice, and eating deeper into the frozen   shore. From out of the bank there projected, here and there, the ends   of dark, box-like objects, which, in the earlier days of the company,   had been gun-cases. In them were the bones of men who had lived and   died an age ago; and as Jan looked at the silent coffins, now falling   into the sea, another spirit&#8212;the spirit that bound him to M&eacute;lisse&#8212;   entered into him, and he shuddered as he thought of what might happen   in the passing of a year. 
  It was this spirit that won. In the spring, Jan went back to Lac  Bain  with the company's supplies. The next autumn he followed the  school to  York Factory, and the third year he joined it at Nelson  House. Then  the company's teacher died, and no one came to fill his  place. 
  In midwinter of this third year, Jan returned to Lac Bain, and,   hugging the delighted M&eacute;lisse close in his arms, he told her that   never again would he go away without her. M&eacute;lisse, tightening her arms   around his neck, made his promise sacred by offering her little   rosebud of a mouth for him to kiss. Later, the restless spirit   slumbering within his breast urged him to speak to Cummins. 
  &quot;When M&eacute;lisse is a little older, should we not go with her into the   South?&quot; he said. &quot;She must not live for ever in a place like this.&quot; 
  Cummins looked at him for an instant as if he did not understand.  When  Jan's meaning struck home, his eyes hardened, and there was the   vibrant ring of steel in his quiet voice. 
  &quot;Her mother will be out there under the old spruce until the end of   time,&quot; he said slowly; &quot;and we will never leave her&#8212;unless, some day,   M&eacute;lisse goes alone.&quot; 
  From that hour Jan no longer looked into the box of his violin. He   struggled against the desire that had grown with his years until he   believed that he had crushed it and stamped it out of his existence.   In his life there came to be but one rising and one setting of the   sun. M&eacute;lisse was his universe. She crowded his heart until beyond her   he began to lose visions of any other world. 
  Each day added to his joy. He called her &quot;my little sister,&quot; and  with  sweet gravity M&eacute;lisse called him &quot;brother Jan,&quot; and returned in  full  measure his boundless love. He marked the slow turning of her  flaxen  hair into sunny gold, and month by month watched joyfully the   deepening of that gold into warm shades of brown. She was to be like   her mother! Jan's soul rejoiced, and in his silent way Cummins offered   up wordless prayers of thankfulness. 
  So matters stood at Post Lac Bain in the beginning of M&eacute;lisse's  ninth  year, when up from the south there came a rumor. As civil war  spreads  its deepest gloom, as the struggle of father against son and  brother  against brother stifles the breathing of nations, so this  rumor set  creeping a deep pall over the forest people. 
  Rumor grew into rumor. From the east, the south and the west they   multiplied, until on all sides the Paul Reveres of the wilderness   carried news that the Red Terror was at their heels, and the chill of   a great fear swept like a shivering wind from the edge of civilization   to the bay.
