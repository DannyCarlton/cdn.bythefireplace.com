  The next morning Jan struck out over his old trail to the Hasabala.   The Crees were gone. He spent a day swinging east and west, and found   old trails leading into the north. 
  &quot;They have gone up among the Eskimos,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Ah,  Kazan,  what in the name of the saints is that?&quot; 
  The leading dog dropped upon his haunches with a menacing growl as  a  lone figure staggered across the snow toward them. It was Croisset.   With a groan, he dropped upon the sledge. 
  &quot;I am sick and starving!&quot; he wailed. &quot;The fiend himself has got  into  my cabin, and for three days I've had nothing but snow and a raw   whisky-jack!&quot; 
  &quot;Sick!&quot; cried Jan, drawing a step away from him. 
  &quot;Yes, sick from an empty belly, and this, and this!&quot; He showed a   forearm done up in a bloody rag, and pointed to his neck, from which   the skin was peeling. &quot;I was gone ten days with that red cloth you   gave me; and when I came back, if there wasn't the horror itself   grinning at me from the top of my own shanty! I tried to get in, but   my wife barred the door, and said that she would shoot me if I didn't   get back into the woods. I tried to steal in at night through a   window, and she drenched me in hot water. I built a wigwam at the edge   of the forest, and stayed there for five days. Hon-gree! Blessed   saints, I had no matches, no grub; and when I got close enough to yell   these things to her, she kept her word and plunked me through a crack   in the door, so that I lost a pint of blood from this arm.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll give you something to eat,&quot; laughed Jan, undoing his pack.  &quot;How  long has the red flag been up?&quot; 
  &quot;I've lost all count of time, but it's twelve days, if an hour, and  I  swear it's going to take all winter to get it down!&quot; 
  &quot;It's not the plague. Go back and tell your wife so.&quot; 
  &quot;And get shot for my pains!&quot; groaned Croisset, digging into meat  and  biscuit. &quot;I'm bound for Lac Bain, if you'll give me a dozen  matches.  That whisky-jack will remain with me until I die, for when I  ate him I  forgot to take out his insides!&quot; 
  &quot;You're a lucky man, Croisset. It's good proof that she loves you.&quot; 
  &quot;If bullets and hot water and an empty belly are proofs, she loves  me  a great deal, Jan Thoreau! Though I don't believe she meant to hit  me.  It was a woman's bad aim.&quot; 
  Jan left him beside a good fire, and turned into the southwest to  burn  Langlois and his cabin. The red flag still floated where he had  seen  it weeks before. The windows were thicker with frost. He shouted,  beat  upon the door with the butt of his rifle and broke in the  windows. The  silence of death quickened the beating of his heart when  he stopped to  listen. There was no doubt that Langlois lay dead in his  little home. 
  Jan brought dry brushwood from the forest, and piled it high  against  the logs. Upon his sledge he sat and watched the fire until  the cabin  was a furnace of leaping flame. 
  He continued westward. At the head of the Porcupine he found the   remains of three burned wigwams, and from one of them he dug out   charred bones. Down the Porcupine he went slowly, doubling to the east   and west, until, at its junction with Gray Otter Creek, he met a Cree,   who told him that twenty miles farther on there was an abandoned   village of six teepees. Toward these he boldly set forth, praying as   he went that the angels were guarding M&eacute;lisse at Post Lac Bain. 
  Croisset reached the post forty-eight hours after he had  encountered  Jan. 
  &quot;The red flag is everywhere!&quot; he cried, catching sight of the  signal  over Mukee's cabin. &quot;It is to the east and west of the Hasabala  as  thick as jays in springtime!&quot; 
  The Cree from the Gray Otter drove in on his way north. 
  &quot;Six wigwams with dead in them,&quot; he reported in his own language to   Williams. &quot;A company man, with a one-eyed leader and four trailers,   left the Gray Otter to burn them.&quot; 
  Williams took down his birch-bark moose-horn and bellowed a weird   signal to Cummins, who opened a crack of his door to listen, with   M&eacute;lisse close beside him. 
  &quot;Thoreau is in the thick of it to the south,&quot; he called. &quot;There's  too  much of it for him, and I'm going down with the dogs. Croisset  will  stay in the store for a few days.&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse heard the words, and her eyes were big with fear when her   father turned from closing and bolting the door. In more than a   childish way, she knew that Jan had gone forth to face a great danger.   The grim laws of the savage world in which she lived had already begun   to fix their influence upon her, quickening her instinct and reason,   just as they hastened the lives of Indian children into the   responsibilities of men and women before they had reached fifteen. 
  She knew what the red flag over Mukee's cabin meant. She knew that  the  air of this world of hers had become filled with peril to those  who  breathed it, and that people were dying out in the forests; that  all  about them there was a terrible, unseen thing which her father  called  the plague, and that Jan had gone forth to fight it, to breathe  it,  and, perhaps, to die in it. Their own door was locked and bolted   against it. She dared not even thrust her head from the window which   was opened for a short time each day; and until Cummins assured her   that there was no danger in the sunshine, she shunned the few pale   rays that shot through the cabin-window at midday. 
  Unconsciously, Cummins added to her fears in more ways than one,  and  as he answered her questions truthfully, her knowledge increased  day  by day. She thought more and more of Jan. She watched for him  through  the two windows of her home. Every sound from outside brought  her to  them with eager hope; and always, her heart sank with  disappointment,  and the tears would come very near to her eyes, when  she saw nothing  but the terrible red flag clinging to the pole over  Mukee's cabin. 
  In the little Bible which her mother had left there was written, on   the ragged fly-leaf, a simple prayer. Each night, as she knelt beside   her cot and repeated this prayer, she paused at the end, and added: 
  &quot;Dear Father in Heaven, please take care of Jan!&quot; 
  The days brought quick changes now. One morning the moose-horn  called  Cummins to the door. It was the fifth day after Williams had  gone  south. 
  &quot;There was no smoke this morning, and I looked through the window,&quot;   shouted Croisset. &quot;Mukee and the old man are both dead. I'm going to   burn the cabin.&quot; 
  A stifled groan of anguish fell from Cummins' lips as he went like  a  dazed man to his cot and flung himself face downward upon it.  M&eacute;lisse  could see his strong frame shaking, as if he were crying like  a child;  and twining her arms tightly about his neck, she sobbed out  her  passionate grief against his rough cheek. She did not know the  part  that Mukee had played in the life of the sweet woman who had once   lived in this same little cabin; she knew only that he was dead; that   the terrible thing had killed him and that, next to her father and   Jan, she had loved him more than any one else in the world. 
  Soon she heard a strange sound, and ran to the window. Mukee's  cabin  was in flames. Wild-eyed and tearless with horror, she watched  the  fire as it burst through the broken windows and leaped high up  among  the black spruce. In those flames was Mukee! She screamed, and  her  father sprang to her with a strange cry, running with her from the   window into the little room where she slept. 
  The next morning, when Cummins went to awaken her, his face went as   white as death. M&eacute;lisse was not asleep. Her eyes were wide open and   staring at him, and her soft cheeks burned with the hot glow of fire. 
  &quot;You are sick, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he whispered hoarsely. &quot;You are sick!&quot; 
  He fell upon his knees beside her, and lifted her face in his  hands.  The touch of it sent a chill to his heart&#8212;such as he had not  felt  since many years ago, in that other room a few steps away. 
  &quot;I want Jan,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;I want Jan to come back to me!&quot; 
  &quot;I will send for him, dear. He will come back soon. I will go out  and  send Croisset.&quot; 
  He hid his face from her as he dragged himself away. Croisset saw  him  coming, and came out of the store to meet him. A hundred yards  away  Cummins stopped. 
  &quot;Croisset, for the love of God, take a team and go after Jan  Thoreau,&quot;  he called &quot;Tell him that M&eacute;lisse is dying of the plague.  Hurry,  hurry!&quot; 
  &quot;Night and day!&quot; shouted Croisset. 
  Twenty minutes later, from the cabin window, Cummins saw him start. 
  &quot;Jan will be here very soon, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he said, running his fingers   gently through her hair. 
  It fell out upon the pillow in thick brown waves, and the sight of  it  choked him with the memory of another vision which would remain  with  him until the end of time. It was her mother's hair, shining  softly in  the dim light; her mother's eyes looked up at him as he sat  beside her  through all this long day. 
  Toward evening there came a change. The fever left the child's  cheeks.  Her eyes closed, and she fell asleep. Through the night  Cummins sat  near the door, but in the gray dawn, overcome by his long  vigil, his  head dropped upon his breast, and he slumbered. 
  When he awoke the cabin was filled with light He heard a sound,  and,  startled, sprang to his feet. M&eacute;lisse was at the stove building a   fire! 
  &quot;I'm better this morning, father. Why didn't you sleep until  breakfast  was ready?&quot; 
  Cummins stared. Then he gave a shout, made a rush for her, and   catching her up in his arms, danced about the cabin like a great bear,   overturning the chairs, and allowing the room to fill with smoke in   his wild joy. 
  &quot;It's what you saw through the window that made you sick, M&eacute;lisse,&quot;  he  cried, putting her down at last. &quot;I thought&#8212;&quot; He paused, and  added,  his voice trembling: &quot;I thought you were going to be sick for  more  than one day, my sweet little woman!&quot; 
  He opened one of the windows to let in the fresh air of the  morning. 
  When Croisset returned, he did not find a red flag over Cummins'   cabin; nor did he bring word of Jan. For three days he had followed   the trails to the south without finding the boy. But he brought back   other news. Williams was sick with the plague in a Cree wigwam on the   lower Porcupine. It was the last they ever heard of the factor, except   that he died some time in March, and was burned by the Crees. 
  Croisset went back over the Churchill trail, and found his wife  ready  to greet him with open arms. After that he joined Per-ee, who  came in  from the north, in another search for Jan. They found neither  trace  nor word of him after passing the Gray Otter, and Cummins gave  up  hope. 
  It was not for long that their fears could be kept from M&eacute;lisse.  This  first bitter grief that had come into her life fell upon her with  a  force which alarmed Cummins, and cast him into deep gloom. She no   longer loved to play with her things in the cabin. For days at a time   she would not touch the books which Jan had brought from Churchill,   and which he had taught her to read. She found little to interest her   in the things which had been her life a few weeks before. 
  With growing despair, Cummins saw his own efforts fail. As the days   passed M&eacute;lisse mingled more and more with the Indian and half-breed   children, and spent much of her time at the company's store, listening   to the talk of the men, silent, attentive, unresponsive to any efforts   they might make to engage her smiles. From her own heart she looked   out upon a world that had become a void for her. Jan had been mother,   brother, and everything that was tender and sweet to her&#8212;and he was   gone. Mukee, whom she had loved, was gone. Williams was gone. The   world was changed, terribly and suddenly, and it added years to her   perspective of things. 
  Each day, as the weeks went on, and the spring sun began to soften  the  snow, she became a little more like the wild children at Lac Bain  and  in the forest. For Jan, she had kept her hair soft and bright,  because  he praised her for it and told her it was pretty. Now it hung  in  tangles down her back. 
  There came a night when she forgot her prayer, and Cummins did not   notice it. He failed to notice it the next night, and the next.   Plunged deep in his own gloom, he was unobservant of many other   things, so that, in place of laughter and joy and merry rompings, only   gloomy and oppressive shadows of things that had come and gone filled   the life of the little cabin. 
  They were eating dinner, one day in the early spring, with the   sunshine flooding in upon them, when a quick, low footfall caused   M&eacute;lisse to lift her eyes in the direction of the open door. A strange   figure stood there, with bloodless face, staring eyes, and garments   hanging in tatters&#8212;but its arms were stretched out, as those same   arms had been held out to her a thousand times before, and, with the   old glad cry, M&eacute;lisse darted with the swiftness of a sun-shadow beyond   Cummins, crying: 
  &quot;Jan, Jan&#8212;my Jan!&quot; 
  Words choked in Cummins' throat when he saw the white-faced figure   clutching M&eacute;lisse to its breast. 
  At last he gasped &quot;Jan!&quot; and threw out his arms, so that both were   caught in their embrace. 
  For an instant Jan turned his face up to the light The other stared   and understood. 
  &quot;You have been sick,&quot; he said, &quot;but it has left no marks.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank God!&quot; breathed Jan. 
  M&eacute;lisse raised her head, and stroked his cheeks with her two hands.   That night she remembered her prayer, and at its end she added: 
  &quot;Dear Father in Heaven, thank you for sending back Jan!&quot;
