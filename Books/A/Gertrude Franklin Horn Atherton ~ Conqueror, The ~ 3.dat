Nevis gave of her bounty to none more generously than to John and Mary  Fawcett. In 1685 the revocation of the Edict of Nantes had sent the  Huguenots swarming to America and the West Indies. Faucette was but a  boy when the Tropics gave him shelter, and learning was hard to get;  except in the matter of carving Caribs. But he acquired the science of  medicine somehow, and settled on Nevis, remodelled his name, and became  a British subject. Brilliant and able, he was not long accumulating a  fortune; there were swamps near Charles Town that bred fever, and the  planters lived as high and suffered as acutely as the English squires of  the same period. His wife brought him money, and in 1714 they received a  joint legacy from Captain Frank Keynall; whether a relative of hers or a  patient of his, the Records do not tell.    
Mary Fawcett was some twenty years younger than her husband, a  high-spirited creature, with much intelligence, and a will which in  later years John Fawcett found himself unable to control. But before  that period, when to the disparity in time were added the irritabilities  of age in the man and the imperiousness of maturity in the woman, they  were happy in their children, in their rising fortunes, and, for a  while, in one another.    
For twenty-eight years they lived the life of the Island. They built a  Great House on their estate at Gingerland, a slope of the Island which  faces Antigua, and they had their mansion in town for use when the  Captain-General was abiding on Nevis. While Mary Fawcett was bringing up  and marrying her children, managing the household affairs of a large  estate, and receiving and returning the visits of the other grandees of  the Island, to say nothing of playing her important part in all social  functions, life went well enough. Her children, far away from the swamps  of Charles Town, throve in the trade winds which temper the sun of Nevis  and make it an isle of delight. When they were not studying with their  governesses, there were groves and gorges to play in, ponies to ride,  and monkeys and land crabs to hunt. Later came the gay life of the  Capital, the routs at Government House, frequent even when the Chief was  elsewhere, the balls at neighbouring estates, the picnics in the cool  high forests, or where more tropical trees and tree ferns grew thick,  the constant meeting with distinguished strangers, and the visits to  other islands.    
The young Fawcetts married early. One went with her husband, Peter  Lytton, to the island of St. Croix. The Danish Government, upon  obtaining possession of this fertile island, in 1733, immediately issued  an invitation to the planters of the Leeward Caribbees to immigrate,  tempting many who were dissatisfied with the British Government or  wished for larger estates than they could acquire on their own populous  islands. Members of the Lytton, Mitchell, and Stevens families of St.  Christopher were among the first to respond to the liberal offer of the  Danish Government. The two sons of James Lytton, Peter and James, grew  up on St. Croix, Danish by law, British in habit and speech; and both  married women of Nevis. Peter was the first to wed, and his marriage to  young Mary Fawcett was the last to be celebrated in the Great House at  Gingerland.    
When Peter Lytton and his wife sailed away, as other sons and other  daughters had sailed before, to return to Nevis rarely,--for those were  the days of travel unveneered,--John and Mary Fawcett were left alone:  their youngest daughter, she who afterward became the wife of Thomas  Mitchell of St. Croix, was at school in England.    
By this time Dr. Fawcett had given up his practice and was living on his  income. He took great interest in his cane-fields and mills, and in the  culture of limes and pine-apples; but in spite of his outdoor life his  temper soured and he became irritable and exacting. Gout settled in him  as a permanent reminder of the high fortunes of his middle years, and  when the Gallic excitability of his temperament, aggravated by a  half-century of hot weather, was stung to fiercer expression by the  twinges of his disease, he was an abominable companion for a woman  twenty years closer to youth.    
In the solitudes of the large house Mary Fawcett found life unendurable.  Still handsome, naturally gay of temper, and a brilliant figure in  society, she frequently deserted her elderly husband for weeks at a  time. The day came when he peremptorily forbade her to leave the place  without him. For a time she submitted, for although a woman of uncommon  independence of spirit, it was not until 1740 that she broke free of  traditions and astonished the island of Nevis. She shut herself up with  her books and needlework, attended to her house and domestic negroes  with the precision of long habit, saw her friends when she could, and  endured the exactions of her husband with only an occasional but mighty  outburst.    
It was in these unhappy conditions that Rachael Fawcett was born.
