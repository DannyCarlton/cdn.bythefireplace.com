  The big room was empty when Jan came quietly through the open door.  He  stopped to listen, and caught a faint laugh from the other room,  and  then another; and to give warning of his presence, he coughed  loudly  and scraped a chair along the floor. A moment's silence  followed. The  farther door opened a little, and then it opened wide,  and M&eacute;lisse  came out. 
  &quot;Now what do you think of me, brother Jan?&quot; She stood in the light  of  the window through which came the afternoon sun, her hair piled in   glistening coils upon the crown of her head, as they had seen them in   the pictures, her cheeks flushed, her eyes glowing questioningly at   Jan. 
  &quot;Do I look&#8212;as you thought&#8212;I would, Jan?&quot; she persisted, a little   doubtful at his silence. She turned, so that he saw the cluster of   soft curls that fell upon her shoulder, with sprigs of bakneesh half   smothered in them. &quot;Do I?&quot; 
  &quot;You are prettier than I have ever seen you, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he replied   softly. 
  There was a seriousness in his voice that made her come to him in  her  old impulsive, half-childish way. She lifted her hands and rested  them  on his shoulders, as she had always done when inviting him to  toss her  above his head. 
  &quot;If I am prettier&#8212;and you like me this way&#8212;why don't you&#8212;&quot; 
  She finished with a sweet, upturned pouting of her mouth, and, with  a  sudden, laughing cry, Jan caught her in his arms and kissed the lips   she held up to him. It was but an instant, and he freed her, a hot   blush burning in his brown cheeks. 
  &quot;My dear brother!&quot; she laughed at him, gathering up the bakneesh on   the table. &quot;I love to have you kiss me, and now I have to make you do   it. Father kisses me every morning when he goes to the store. I   remember when you used to kiss me every time you came home, but now   you forget to do it at all. Do brothers love their sisters less as   they grow older?&quot; 
  &quot;Sometimes they love the SISTER less and the OTHER GIRL more, ma  belle  M&eacute;lisse,&quot; came a quick voice from the door, and Jean de Gravois   bounded in like a playful cat, scraping and bowing before M&eacute;lisse   until his head nearly touched the floor. &quot;Lovely saints, Jan Thoreau,   but she IS a woman, just as my Iowaka told me! And the cakes&#8212;the   bread&#8212;the pies! You must delay the supper my lady, for the good Lord   deliver me if I haven't spilled all the dough on the floor! Swas-s-s-   s-h&#8212;such a mess! And my Iowaka did nothing but laugh and call me a   clumsy dear!&quot; 
  &quot;You're terribly in love, Jean,&quot; cried M&eacute;lisse, laughing until her   eyes were wet; &quot;just like some of the people in the books which Jan   and I read.&quot; 
  &quot;And I always shall be, my dear, so long as the daughter of a  princess  and the great-granddaughter of a chef de bataillon allows me  to mix  her dough!&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse flung the red shawl over her head, still laughing. 
  &quot;I will go and help her, Jean.&quot; 
  &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; gasped Gravois, looking searchingly at Jan, when she  had  left. &quot;Shall I give you my best wishes, Jan Thoreau? Does it  signify?&quot; 
  &quot;Signify&#8212;what?&quot; 
  The little Frenchman's eyes snapped. 
  &quot;Why, when our pretty Cree maiden becomes engaged, she puts up her   hair for the first time, that is all, my dear Jan. When I asked my   blessed Iowaka to be my wife, she answered by running away from me,   taunting me until I thought my heart had shriveled into a bit of salt   blubber; but she came back to me before I had completely died, with   her braids done up on the top of her head!&quot; 
  He stopped suddenly, startled into silence by the strange look that   had come into the other's face. For a full minute Jan stood as if the   power of movement had gone from him. He was staring over the   Frenchman's head, a ghastly pallor growing in his cheeks. 
  &quot;No&#8212;it&#8212;means&#8212;nothing,&quot; he said finally, speaking as if the words   were forced from him one by one. 
  He dropped into a chair beside the table like one whose senses had   been dulled by an unexpected blow. With a great sighing breath that   was almost a sob, he bowed his head upon his arms. 
  &quot;Jan Thoreau,&quot; whispered Jean softly, &quot;have you forgotten that it  was  I who killed the missioner for you, and that through all of these   years Jean de Gravois has never questioned you about the fight on the   mountain top?&quot; There was in his voice, as gentle as a woman's, the   vibrant note of a comradeship which is next to love&#8212;the comradeship   of man for man in a world where friendship is neither bought nor sold.   &quot;Have you forgotten, Jan Thoreau? If there is anything Jean de Gravois   can do?&quot; 
  He sat down opposite Jan, his thin, eager face propped in his  hands,  and watched silently until the other lifted his head. Their  eyes met,  steady, unflinching, and in that look there were the oath  and the seal  of all that the honor of the big snows held for those  two. 
  Still without words, Jan reached within his breast and drew forth  the  little roll which he had taken from his violin. One by one he  handed  the pages over to Jean de Gravois. 
  &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; said Jean, when he had finished reading. He spoke no  other  words. White-faced, the two men stared, Jan's throat twitching,   Gravois' brown fingers crushing the rolls he held. 
  &quot;That was why I tried to kill the missioner,&quot; said Jan at last. He   pointed to the more coarsely written pages under Jean's hand. &quot;And   that&#8212;that&#8212;is why it could not signify that M&eacute;lisse has done up her   hair.&quot; He rose to his feet, straining to keep his voice even, and   gathered up the papers so that they shot back into the little   cylinder-shaped roll again. &quot;Now do you understand?&quot; 
  &quot;I understand,&quot; replied Jean in a low voice, but his eyes glittered   like dancing dragon-flies as he raised his elbows slowly from the   table and stretched his arms above his head. &quot;I understand, Jan   Thoreau, and I praise the blessed Virgin that it was Jean de Gravois   who killed the missioner out upon the ice of Lac Bain!&quot; 
  &quot;But the other,&quot; persisted Jan, &quot;the other, which says that I&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Stop!&quot; cried Jean sharply. He came around the table and seized  Jan's  hands in the iron grip of his lithe, brown fingers. &quot;That is  something  for you to forget. It means nothing&#8212;nothing at all, Jan  Thoreau! Does  any one know but you and me?&quot; 
  &quot;No one. I intended that some day M&eacute;lisse and her father should  know;  but I waited too long. I waited until I was afraid, until the  horror  of telling her frightened me. I made myself forget, burying it  deeper  each year, until to-day&#8212;on the mountain&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And to-day, in this cabin, you will forget again, and you will  bury  it so deep that it will never come back. I am proud of you, Jan   Thoreau. I love you, and it is the first time that Jean de Gravois has   ever said this to a man. Ah, I hear them coming!&quot; 
  With an absurd bow in the direction of the laughing voices which  they  now heard, the melodramatic little Frenchman pulled Jan to the  door.  Half-way across the open were M&eacute;lisse and Iowaka, carrying a  large  Indian basket between them, and making merry over the task. When  they  saw Gravois and Jan, they set down their burden and waved an   invitation for the two men to come to their assistance. 
  &quot;You should be the second happiest man in the world, Jan Thoreau,&quot;   exclaimed Jean. &quot;The first is Jean de Gravois!&quot; 
  He set off like a bolt from a spring-gun in the direction of the  two  who were waiting for them. He had hoisted the basket upon his  shoulder  by the time Jan arrived. 
  &quot;Are you growing old, too, Jan?&quot; bantered M&eacute;lisse, as she dropped a   few steps behind Jean and his wife. &quot;You come so slowly!&quot; 
  &quot;I think I'm twenty-nine.&quot; 
  &quot;You think!&quot; Her dancing eyes shot up to his, bubbling over with  the  mischief which she had been unable to suppress that day. &quot;Why,  Jan&#8212;&quot; 
  He had never spoken to M&eacute;lisse as he did now. 
  &quot;I was born some time in the winter, M&eacute;lisse&#8212;like you. Perhaps it  was  yesterday, perhaps it is to-morrow. That is all I know.&quot; 
  He looked at her steadily, the grief which he was fighting to keep   back tightening the muscles about his mouth. 
  Like the quick passing of sunshine, the fun swept from her face,   leaving her blue eyes staring up at him, filled with a pain which he   had never seen in them before. In a moment he knew that she had   understood him, and he could have cut out his tongue. Her hand reached   his arm, and she stopped him, her face lifted pleadingly, the tears   slowly gathering in her eyes. 
  &quot;Forgive me!&quot; she whispered, her voice breaking into a sob. &quot;Dear,   dear Jan, forgive me!&quot; She caught one of his hands in both her own,   and for an instant held it so that he could feel the throbbing of her   heart. &quot;To-day is your birthday, Jan&#8212;yours and mine, mine and yours&#8212;   and we will always have it that way&#8212;always&#8212;won't we, Jan?&quot;
