  It was the Flying-Up Moon&#8212;deep and slumbering midsummer&#8212;in all   the land of Keewatin. From Hudson Bay to the Athabasca and from  the  Hight of Land to the edge of the Great Barrens, forest, plain,  and  swamp lay in peace and forgetfulness under the sun-glowing  days and  the star-filled nights of the August MUKOO-SAWIN. It was  the breeding  moon, the growing moon, the moon when all wild life  came into its own  once more. For the trails of this wilderness  world&#8212;so vast that it  reached a thousand miles east and west and  as far north and  south&#8212;were empty of human life. At the Hudson  Bay Company's  posts&#8212;scattered here and there over the illimitable  domain of fang  and claw&#8212;had gathered the thousands of hunters and  trappers, with  their wives and children, to sleep and gossip and  play through the few  weeks of warmth and plenty until the strife  and tragedy of another  winter began. For these people of the  forests it was MUKOO-SAWIN&#8212;the  great Play Day of the year; the  weeks in which they ran up new debts  and established new credits  at the Posts; the weeks in which they  foregathered at every Post  as at a great fair&#8212;playing, and making  love, and marrying, and  fattening up for the many days of hunger and  gloom to come. 
  It was because of this that the wild things had come fully into   the possession of their world for a space. There was no longer the   scent of man in all the wilderness. They were not hunted. There  were  no traps laid for their feet, no poison-baits placed  temptingly where  they might pass. In the fens and on the lakes the  wildfowl squawked  and honked unfearing to their young, just  learning the power of wing;  the lynx played with her kittens  without sniffing the air for the  menace of man; the cow moose went  openly into the cool water of the  lakes with their calves; the  wolverine and the marten ran playfully  over the roofs of deserted  shacks and cabins; the beaver and the otter  tumbled and frolicked  in their dark pools; the birds sang, and through  all the  wilderness there was the drone and song of Nature as some  Great  Power must at first have meant that Nature should be. A new   generation of wild things had been born. It was a season of Youth,   with tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of little  children  of the wild playing their first play, learning their  first lessons,  growing up swiftly to face the menace and doom of  their first winter.  And the Beneficent Spirit of the forests,  anticipating what was to  come, had prepared well for them.  Everywhere there was plenty. The  blueberries, the blackberries,  the mountain-ash and the saskatoons  were ripe; tree and vine were  bent low with their burden of fruit. The  grass was green and  tender from the summer rains. Bulbous roots were  fairly popping  out of the earth; the fens and the edges of the lakes  were rich  with things to eat, overhead and underfoot the horn of  plenty was  emptying itself without stint. 
  In this world Neewa and Miki found a vast and unending   contentment. They lay, on this August afternoon, on a sun-bathed   shelf of rock that overlooked a wonderful valley. Neewa, stuffed  with  luscious blueberries, was asleep. Miki's eyes were only  partly closed  as he looked down into the soft haze of the valley.  Up to him came the  rippling music of the stream running between  the rocks and over the  pebbly bars below, and with it the soft and  languorous drone of the  valley itself. He napped uneasily for half  an hour, and then his eyes  opened and he was wide awake. He took a  sharp look over the valley.  Then he looked at Neewa, who, fat and  lazy, would have slept until  dark. It was always Miki who kept him  on the move. And now Miki barked  at him gruffly two or three  times, and nipped at one of his ears. 
  &quot;Wake up!&quot; he might have said. &quot;What's the sense of sleeping on a   day like this? Let's go down along the creek and hunt something.&quot; 
  Neewa roused himself, stretched his fat body, and yawned. Sleepily   his little eyes took in the valley. Miki got up and gave the low  and  anxious whine which always told his companion that he wanted  to be on  the move. Neewa responded, and they began making their  way down the  green slope into the rich bottom between the two  ridges. 
  They were now almost six months of age, and in the matter of size   had nearly ceased to be a cub and a pup. They were almost a dog  and a  bear. Miki's angular legs were getting their shape; his  chest had  filled out; his neck had grown until it no longer seemed  too small for  his big head and jaws, and his body had increased in  girth and length  until he was twice as big as most ordinary dogs  of his age. 
  Neewa had lost his round, ball-like cubbishness, though he still   betrayed far more than Miki the fact that he was not many months  lost  from his mother. But he was no longer filled with that  wholesome love  of peace that had filled his earlier cubhood. The  blood of Soominitik  was at last beginning to assert itself, and he  no longer sought a  place of safety in time of battle&#8212;unless the  grimness of utter  necessity made it unavoidable. In fact, unlike  most bears, he loved a  fight. If there were a stronger term at  hand it might be applied to  Miki, the true son of Hela. Youthful  as they were, they were already  covered with scars that would have  made a veteran proud. Crows and  owls, wolf-fang and fisher-claw  had all left their marks, and on  Miki's side was a bare space  eight inches long left as a souvenir by a  wolverine. 
  In Neewa's funny round head there had grown, during the course of   events, an ambition to have it out some day with a citizen of his  own  kind; but the two opportunities that had come his way were  spoiled by  the fact that the other cubs' mothers were with them.  So now, when  Miki led off on his trips of adventure, Neewa always  followed with  another thrill than that of getting something to  eat, which so long  had been his one ambition. Which is not to say  that Neewa had lost his  appetite. He could eat more in one day  than Miki could eat in three,  mainly because Miki was satisfied  with two or three meals a day while  Neewa preferred one&#8212;a  continuous one lasting from dawn until dark. On  the trail he was  always eating something. 
  A quarter of a mile along the foot of the ridge, in a stony coulee   down which a tiny rivulet trickled, there grew the finest wild   currants in all the Shamattawa country. Big as cherries, black as   ink, and swelling almost to the bursting point with luscious  juice,  they hung in clusters so thick that Neewa could gather them  by the  mouthful. Nothing in all the wilderness is quite so good as  one of  these dead-ripe black currants, and this coulee wherein  they grew so  richly Neewa had preempted as his own personal  property. Miki, too,  had learned to eat the currants; so to the  coulee they went this  afternoon, for such currants as these one  can eat even when one is  already full. Besides, the coulee was  fruitful for Miki in other ways.  There were many young partridges  and rabbits in it&#8212;&quot;fool hens&quot; of  tender flesh and delicious  flavour which he caught quite easily, and  any number of gophers  and squirrels. 
  To-day they had scarcely taken their first mouthful of the big   juicy currants when an unmistakable sound came to them.  Unmistakable  because each recognized instantly what it meant. It  was the tearing  down of currant bushes twenty or thirty yards  higher up the coulee.  Some robber had invaded their treasure-  house, and instantly Miki  bared his fangs while Neewa wrinkled up  his nose in an ominous snarl.  Soft-footed they advanced toward the  sound until they came to the edge  of a small open space which was  as flat as a table. In the centre of  this space was a clump of  currant bushes not more than a yard in  girth, and black with  fruit; and squatted on his haunches there,  gathering the laden  bushes in his arms, was a young black bear about  four sizes larger  than Neewa. 
  In that moment of consternation and rage Neewa did not take size   into consideration. He was much in the frame of mind of a man   returning home to discover his domicile, and all it contained, in   full possession of another. At the same time here was his ambition   easily to be achieved&#8212;his ambition to lick the daylight out of a   member of his own kind. Miki seemed to sense this fact. Under   ordinary conditions he would have led in the fray, and before  Neewa  had fairly got started, would have been at the impudent  interloper's  throat. But now something held him back, and it was  Neewa who first  shot out&#8212;like a black bolt&#8212;landing squarely in  the ribs of his  unsuspecting enemy. 
  (Old Makoki, the Cree runner, had he seen that attack, would   instantly have found a name for the other bear&#8212;&quot;Petoot-a-wapis-   kum,&quot; which means, literally: &quot;Kicked-off-his-Feet.&quot; Perhaps he  would  have called him &quot;Pete&quot; for short. For the Cree believes in  fitting  names to fact, and Petoot-a-wapis-kum certainly fitted the  unknown  bear like a glove.) 
  Taken utterly by surprise, with his mouth full of berries, he was   bowled over like an overfilled bag under the force of Neewa's  charge.  So complete was his discomfiture for the moment that Miki,  watching  the affair with a yearning interest, could not keep back  an excited  yap of approbation. Before Pete could understand what  had happened,  and while the berries were still oozing from his  mouth, Neewa was at  his throat&#8212;and the fun began. 
  Now bears, and especially young bears, have a way of fighting that   is all their own. It reminds one of a hair-pulling contest between   two well-matched ladies. There are no rules to the game&#8212;  absolutely  none. As Pete and Neewa clinched, their hind legs began  to do the  fighting, and the fur began to fly. Pete, being already  on his back&#8212;a  first-class battling position for a bear&#8212;would  have possessed an  advantage had it not been for Neewa's ferocious  hold at his throat. As  it was, Neewa sank his fangs in to their  full length, and scrubbed  away for dear life with his sharp hind  claws. Miki drew nearer at  sight of the flying fur, his soul  filled with joy. Then Pete got one  leg into action, and then the  other, and Miki's jaws came together  with a sudden click. Over and  over the two fighters rolled, Neewa  holding to his throat-grip,  and not a squeal or a grunt came from  either of them. Pebbles and  dirt flew along with hair and fur. Stones  rolled with a clatter  down the coulee. The very air trembled with the  thrill of combat.  In Miki's attitude of tense waiting there was  something now of  suspicious anxiety. With eight furry legs scratching  and tearing  furiously, and the two fighters rolling and twisting and   contorting themselves like a pair of windmills gone mad, it was   almost impossible for Miki to tell who was getting the worst of   it&#8212;Neewa or Pete; at least he was in doubt for a matter of three  or  four minutes. 
  Then he recognized Neewa's voice. It was very faint, but for all   that it was an unmistakable bawl of pain. 
  Smothered under Pete's heavier body Neewa began to realize, at the   end of those three or four minutes, that he had tackled more than  was  good for him. It was altogether Pete's size and not his  fighting  qualities, for Neewa had him outpointed there. But he  fought on,  hoping for some good turn of luck, until at last Pete  got him just  where he wanted him and began raking him up and down  his sides until  in another three minutes he would have been half  skinned if Miki  hadn't judged the moment ripe for intervention.  Even then Neewa was  taking his punishment without a howl. 
  In another instant Miki had Pete by the ear. It was a grim and   terrible hold. Old Soominitik himself would have bawled lustily in   the circumstances. Pete raised his voice in a howl of agony. He   forgot everything else but the terror and the pain of this new   SOMETHING that had him by the ear, and he rent the air with his   outcry. His lamentation poured in an unbroken spasm of sound from  his  throat. Neewa knew that Miki was in action. 
  He pulled himself from under the young interloper's body&#8212;and not   a second too soon. Down the coulee, charging like a mad bull, came   Pete's mother. Neewa was off like a shot just as she made a  powerful  swing at him. The blow missed, and the old bear turned  excitedly to  her bawling offspring. Miki, hanging joyously to his  victim, was  oblivious of his danger until Pete's mother was almost  upon him. He  caught sight of her just as her long arm shot out  like a wooden beam.  He dodged; and the blow intended for him  landed full against the side  of the unfortunate Pete's head with a  force that took him clean off  his feet and sent him flying like a  football twenty yards down the  coulee. 
  Miki did not wait for further results. Quick as a flash he was in   a currant thicket tearing down the little gulch after Neewa. They   came out on the plain together, and for a good ten minutes they  did  not halt in their flight long enough to look back. When they  did, the  coulee was a mile away. They sat down, panting. Neewa's  red tongue was  hanging out in his exhaustion. He was scratched and  bleeding; loose  hair hung all over him. As he looked at Miki there  was something in  the dolorous expression of Neewa's face which was  a confession of the  fact that he realized Pete had licked him.
