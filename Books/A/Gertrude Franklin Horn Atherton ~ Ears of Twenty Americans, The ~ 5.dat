"Yes, yes, indeed, Blandina," exclaimed Benicia, "they had no chance at  all last night, for we danced until dawn, and perhaps they were afraid  of Don Thomas Larkin. But we shall talk and have music to-night, and  those fine new tables that came on the last ship from Boston must not be  destroyed."    
"Well, if you really think--" said Blandina, who always thought exactly  as Benicia did. She opened a door and called:--    
"Flujencio."    
"Well, my sister?"    
A dreamy-looking young man in short jacket and trousers of red silk  entered the room, sombrero in one hand, a cigarito in the other.    
"Flujencio, you know it is said that these 'Yankees' always 'whittle'  everything. We are afraid they will spoil the furniture to-night; so  tell one of the servants to cut a hundred pine slugs, and you go down  to the store and buy a box of penknives. Then they will have plenty to  amuse themselves with and will not cut the furniture."    
"True! True! What a good idea! Was it Benicia's?" He gave her a glance  of languid adoration. "I will buy those knives at once, before I forget  it," and he tossed the sombrero on his curls and strode out of the  house.    
"How dost thou like the Senor Lieutenant Russell, Benicia?"    
Benicia lifted her chin, but her cheeks became very pink.    
"Well enough. But he is like all the Americans, very proud, and thinks  too well of his hateful country. But I shall teach him how to flirt. He  thinks he can, but he cannot."    
"Thou canst do it, Benicia--look! look!"    
Lieutenant Russell and a brother officer were sauntering slowly by and  looking straight through the grated window at the beautiful girls in  their gayly flowered gowns. They saluted, and the girls bent their  slender necks, but dared not speak, for Dona Francesca Hernandez was in  the next room and the door was open. Immediately following the American  officers came Don Fernando Altimira on horseback. He scowled as he saw  the erect swinging figures of the conquerors, but Benicia kissed the  tips of her fingers as he flung his sombrero to the ground, and he  galloped, smiling, on his way.    
That night the officers of the United States squadron met the society of  Monterey at the house of Don Jorje Hernandez. After the contradanza, to  which they could be admiring spectators only, much to the delight of the  caballeros, Benicia took the guitar presented by Flujencio, and letting  her head droop a little to one side like a lily bent on its stalk by the  breeze, sang the most coquettish song she knew. Her mahogany brown hair  hung unconfined over her white shoulders and gown of embroidered silk  with its pointed waist and full skirt. Her large brown eyes were  alternately mischievous and tender, now and again lighted by a sudden  flash. Her cheeks were pink; her round babylike arms curved with all the  grace of the Spanish woman. As she finished the song she dropped her  eyelids for a moment, then raised them slowly and looked straight at  Russell.    
"By Jove, Ned, you are a lucky dog!" said a brother officer. "She's the  prettiest girl in the room! Why don't you fling your hat at her feet, as  these ardent Californians do?"    
"My cap is in the next room, but I will go over and fling myself there  instead."    
Russell crossed the room and sat down beside Benicia.    
"I should like to hear you sing under those cypresses out on the ocean  about six or eight miles from here," he said to her. "I rode down the  coast yesterday. Jove! what a coast it is!"    
"We will have a merienda there on some evening," said Dona Eustaquia,  who sat beside her daughter. "It is very beautiful on the big rocks to  watch the ocean, under the moonlight."    
"A merienda?"    
"A peek-neek."    
"Good! You will not forget that?"    
She smiled at his boyishness. "It will be at the next moon. I promise."    
Benicia sang another song, and a half-dozen caballeros stood about  her, regarding her with glances languid, passionate, sentimental,  reproachful, determined, hopeless. Russell, leaning back in his chair,  listened to the innocent thrilling voice of the girl, and watched her  adorers, amused and stimulated. The Californian beauty was like no other  woman he had known, and the victory would be as signal as the capture of  Monterey. "More blood, perhaps," he thought, "but a victory is a poor  affair unless painted in red. It will do these seething caballeros good  to learn that American blood is quite as swift as Californian."    
As the song finished, the musicians began a waltz; Russell took the  guitar from Benicia's hand and laid it on the floor.    
"This waltz is mine, senorita," he said.    
"I no know--"    
"Senorita!" said Don Fernando Altimira, passionately, "the first waltz  is always mine. Thou wilt not give it to the American?"    
"And the next is mine!"    
"And the next contradanza!"    
The girl's faithful retinue protested for their rights. Russell could  not understand, but he translated their glances, and bent his lips to  Benicia's ear. That ear was pink and her eyes were bright with roguish  triumph.    
"I want this dance, dear senorita. I may go away any day. Orders may  come to-morrow which will send me where I never can see you again. You  can dance with these men every night of the year--"    
"I give to you," said Benicia, rising hurriedly. "We must be hospitable  to the stranger who comes to-day and leaves to-morrow," she said in  Spanish to the other men. "I have plenty more dances for you."    
After the dance, salads and cakes, claret and water, were brought to the  women by Indian girls, who glided about the room with borrowed grace,  their heads erect, the silver trays held well out. They wore bright red  skirts and white smocks of fine embroidered linen, open at the throat,  the sleeves very short. Their coarse hair hung in heavy braids; their  bright little eyes twinkled in square faces scrubbed until they shone  like copper.    
"Captain," said Russell to Brotherton, as the men followed the host into  the supper room, "let us buy a ranch, marry two of these stunning  girls, and lie round in hammocks whilst these Western houris bring us  aguardiente and soda. What an improvement on Byron and Tom Moore! It  is all so unhackneyed and unexpected. In spite of Dana and Robinson I  expected mud huts and whooping savages. This is Arcadia, and the women  are the most elegant in America."    
"Look here, Ned," said his captain, "you had better do less flirting and  more thinking while you are in this odd country. Your talents will get  rusty, but you can rub them up when you get home. Neither Californian  men nor women are to be trifled with. This is the land of passion, not  of drawing-room sentiment."    
"Perhaps I am more serious than you think. What is the matter?" He spoke  to a brother officer who had joined them and was laughing immoderately.    
"Do you see those Californians grinning over there?" The speaker  beckoned to a group of officers, who joined him at once. "What job do  you suppose they have put up on us? What do you suppose that mysterious  table in the sala means, with its penknives and wooden sticks? I thought  it was a charity bazaar. Well, it is nothing more nor less than a trick  to keep us from whittling up the furniture. We are all Yankees to them,  you know. Preserve my Spanish!"    
The officers shouted with delight. They marched solemnly back into the  sala, and seating themselves in a deep circle about the table,  whittled the slugs all over the floor, much to the satisfaction of the  Californians.
