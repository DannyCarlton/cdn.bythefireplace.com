  A broken, choking breath&#8212;a stifled sound that was scarcely a  cry&#8212;was all that came from Langdon's lips as he saw the monstrous  grizzly looking at him. In the ten seconds that followed he lived  hours.
  His first thought was that he was powerless&#8212;utterly powerless. He  could not even run, for the rock wall was behind him; he could not  fling himself valleyward, for there was a sheer fall of a hundred feet  on that side. He was face to face with death, a death as terrible as  that which had overtaken the dogs.
  And yet in these last moments Langdon did not lose himself in  terror. He noted even the redness in the avenging grizzly's eyes. He  saw the naked scat along his back where one of his bullets had plowed;  he saw the bare spot where another of his bullets had torn its way  through Thor's fore-shoulder. And he believed, as he observed these  things, that Thor had deliberately trailed him, that the bear had  followed him along the ledge and had cornered him here that he might  repay in full measure what had been inflicted upon him.
  Thor advanced&#8212;just one step; and then in that slow, graceful  movement, reared himself to full height. Langdon, even then, thought  that he was magnificent. On his part, the man did not move; he looked  steadily up at Thor, and he had made up his mind what to do when the  great beast lunged forward. He would fling himself over the edge. Down  below there was one chance in a thousand for life. There might be a  ledge or a projecting spur to catch him.
  And Thor!
  Suddenly&#8212;unexpectedly&#8212;he had come upon man! This was the creature  that had hunted him, this was the creature that had hurt him&#8212;and it  was so near that he could reach out with his paw and crush it! And how  weak, and white, and shrinking it looked now! Where was its strange  thunder? Where was its burning lightning? Why did it make no sound?
  Even a dog would have done more than this creature, for the dog  would have shown its fangs; it would have snarled, it would have  fought. But this thing that was man did nothing. And a great, slow  doubt swept through Thor's massive head. Was it really this shrinking,  harmless, terrified thing that had hurt him? He smelled the man-smell.  It was thick. And yet this time there came with it no hurt.
  And then, slowly again, Thor came down to all fours. Steadily he  looked at the man.
  Had Langdon moved then he would have died. But Thor was not, like  man, a murderer. For another half-minute he waited for a hurt, for some  sign of menace. Neither came, and he was puzzled. His nose swept the  ground, and Langdon saw the dust rise where the grizzly's hot breath  stirred it. And after that, for another long and terrible thirty  seconds, the bear and the man looked at each other.
  Then very slowly&#8212;and doubtfully&#8212;Thor half turned. He growled. His  lips drew partly back. Yet he saw no reason to fight, for that  shrinking, white-faced pigmy crouching on the rock made no movement to  offer him battle. He saw that he could not go on, for the ledge was  blocked by the mountain wall. Had there been a trail the story might  have been different for Langdon. As it was, Thor disappeared slowly in  the direction from which he had come, his great head hung low, his long  claws click, click, clicking like ivory castanets as he went.
  Not until then did it seem to Langdon that he breathed again, and  that his heart resumed its beating. He gave a great sobbing gasp. He  rose to his feet, and his legs seemed weak. He waited&#8212;one minute, two,  three; and then he stole cautiously to the twist in the ledge around  which Thor had gone.
  The rocks were clear, and he began to retrace his own steps toward  the meadowy break, watching and listening, and still clutching the  broken parts of his rifle. When he came to the edge of the plain he  dropped down behind a huge boulder.
  Three hundred yards away Thor was ambling slowly over the crest of  the dip toward the eastward valley. Not until the bear reappeared on  the farther ridge of the hollow, and then vanished again, did Langdon  follow.
  When he reached the slope on which he had hobbled his horse Thor was  no longer in sight. The horse was where he had left it. Not until he  was in the saddle did Langdon feel that he was completely safe. Then he  laughed, a nervous, broken, joyous sort of laugh, and as he scanned the  valley he filled his pipe with fresh tobacco.
  &#8220;You great big god of a bear!&#8221; he whispered, and every fibre in him  was trembling in a wonderful excitement as he found voice for the first  time. &#8220;You&#8212;you monster with a heart bigger than man!&#8221; And then he  added, under his breath, as if not conscious that he was speaking: &#8220;If  I'd cornered you like that I'd have killed you! And you! You cornered  me, and let me live!&#8221;
  He rode toward camp, and as he went he knew that this day had given  the final touch to the big change that had been working in him. He had  met the King of the Mountains; he had stood face to face with death,  and in the last moment the four-footed thing he had hunted and maimed  had been merciful. He believed that Bruce would not understand; that  Bruce could not understand; but unto himself the day and the hour had  brought its meaning in a way that he would not forget so long as he  lived, and he knew that hereafter and for all time he would not again  hunt the life of Thor, or the lives of any of his kind.
  Langdon reached the camp and prepared himself some dinner, and as he  ate this, with Muskwa for company, he made new plans for the days and  weeks that were to follow. He would send Bruce back to overtake  Metoosin the next day, and they would no longer hunt the big grizzly.  They would go on to the Skeena and possibly even up to the edge of the  Yukon, and then swing eastward into the caribou country some time early  in September, hitting back toward civilization on the prairie side of  the Rockies. He would take Muskwa with them. Back in the land of men  and cities they would be great friends. It did not occur to him just  then what this would mean for Muskwa.
  It was two o'clock, and he was still dreaming of new and unknown  trails into the North when a sound came to rouse and disturb him. For a  few minutes he paid no attention to it, for it seemed to be only a part  of the droning murmur of the valley. But slowly and steadily it rose  above this, and at last he got up from where he was lying with his back  to a tree and walked out from the timber, where he could hear more  plainly.
  Muskwa followed him, and when Langdon stopped the tan-faced cub also  stopped. His little ears shot out inquisitively. He turned his head to  the north. From that direction the sound was coming.
  In another moment Langdon had recognized it, and yet even then he  told himself that his ears must be playing him false. It could not be  the barking of dogs! By this time Bruce and Metoosin were far to the  south with the pack; at least Metoosin should be, and Bruce was on his  return to the camp! Quickly the sound grew more distinct, and at last  he knew that he could not be mistaken. The dogs were coming up the  valley. Something had turned Bruce and Metoosin northward instead of  into the south. And the pack was giving tongue&#8212;that fierce, heated  baying which told him they were again on the fresh spoor of game. A  sudden thrill shot through him. There could be but one living thing in  the length and breadth of the valley that Bruce would set the dogs  after, and that was the big grizzly!
  For a few moments longer Langdon stood and listened. Then he hurried  back to camp, tied Muskwa to his tree, armed himself with another  rifle, and resaddled his horse. Five minutes later he was riding  swiftly in the direction of the range where a short time before Thor  had given him his life.
