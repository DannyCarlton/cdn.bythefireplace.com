I held his hand tight. It was so pleasant to know I could love him  now with a clear conscience, even if I had to give myself up to the  police to-morrow. And indeed, being a woman, I didn't really much  care whether they took me or not, if only I could love Jack, and  know Jack loved me.    
"You must tell me everything--this minute--Jack," I said, clinging  to him like a child. "I can't bear this suspense. Begin telling me  at once. You'll do me more harm than good if you keep me waiting any  longer."    
Jack took instinctively a medical view of the situation.    
"So I think, my child," he said, looking lovingly at me. "Your  nerves are on the rack, and will be the better for unstringing. Oh,  Una, it's such a comfort that you know at last who I am! It's such a  comfort that I'm able to talk to you to-day just as we two used to  talk four years ago in Devonshire!"    
"Did I love you then, Jack?" I whispered, nestling still closer to  him, in spite of my horror. Or rather, my very horror made me feel  more acutely than ever the need for protection. I was no longer  alone in the world. I had a man to support me.    
"You told me so, darling," he answered, smoothing my hair with his  hand. "Have you forgotten all about it? Doesn't even that come back?  Can't you remember it now, when I've told you who I am and how it  all happened?"    
I shook my head.    
"All cloudy still," I replied, vaguely. "Some dim sense of  familiarity, perhaps,--as when people say they have a feeling of  having lived all this over somewhere else before,--but nothing more  certain, nothing more definite."    
"Then I must begin at the beginning," Jack answered, bracing himself  for his hard task, "and reconstruct your whole life for you, as far  as I know it, from your very childhood. I'm particularly anxious you  should not merely be <i>told</i> what took place, but should remember the  past. There are gaps in my own knowledge I want you to eke out.  There are places I want you to help me myself over. And besides,  it'll be more satisfactory to yourself to remember than to be told  it."    
I leaned back, almost exhausted. Incredible as it may seem to you,  in spite of that awful photograph, I couldn't really believe even so  I had killed my father. And yet I knew very well now that Jack, at  least, hadn't done it. That was almost enough. But not quite. My  head swam round in terror. I waited and longed for Jack to explain  the whole thing to me.    
"You remember," he said, watching me close, "that when you lived as  a very little girl in Australia you had a papa who seems different  to you still from the papa in your later childish memories?"    
"I remember it very well," I replied. "It came back to me on the  Sarmatian. I think of him always now as the papa in the loose white  linen coat. The more I dwell on him, the more does he come out to me  as a different man from the other one--the father...I shot at The  Grange, at Woodbury. The father that lives with me in that  ineffaceable Picture."    
"He <i>was</i> a different man," Jack answered, with a sudden burst, as if  he knew all my story. "Una, I may as well relieve your mind all at  once on that formidable point. You shot that man"--he pointed to the  white-bearded person in the photograph,--"but it was not parricide:  it was not even murder. It was under grave provocation...in more  than self-defence...and he was <i>not</i> your father."    
"Not my father!" I cried, clasping my hands and leaning forward in  my profound suspense. "But I killed him all the same! Oh, Jack, how  terrible!"    
"You must quiet yourself, my child," he said, still soothing me  automatically. "I want your aid in this matter. You must listen to  me calmly, and bring your mind to bear on all I say to you."    
Then he began with a regular history of my early life, which came  back to me as fast as he spoke, scene by scene and year by year, in  long and familiar succession. I remembered everything, sometimes  only when he suggested it; but sometimes also, before he said the  words, my memory outran his tongue, and I put in a recollection or  two with my own tongue as they recurred to me under the stimulus of  this new birth of my dead nature. I recalled my early days in the  far bush in Australia; my journey home to England on the big steamer  with mamma; the way we travelled about for years from place to place  on the Continent. I remembered how I had been strictly enjoined,  too, never to speak of baby; and how my father used to watch my  mother just as closely as he watched me, always afraid, as it  appeared to me, she should make some verbal slip or let out some  great secret in an unguarded moment. He seemed relieved, I  recollected now, when my poor mother died: he grew less strict with  me then, but as far as I could judge, though he was careful of my  health, he never really loved me.    
Then Jack reminded me further of other scenes that came much later  in my forgotten life. He reminded me of my trip to Torquay, where I  first met him: and all at once the whole history of my old visits to  the Moores came back like a flood to me. The memory seemed to  inundate and overwhelm my brain. They were the happiest time of all  life, those delightful visits, when I met Jack and fell in love with  him, and half confided my love to my Cousin Minnie. Strange to say,  though at Torquay itself I'd forgotten it all, in that little  Canadian house, with Jack by my side to recall it, it rushed back  like a wave upon me. I'd fallen in love with Jack without my  father's knowledge or consent; and I knew very well my father would  never allow me to marry him. He had ideas of his own, my father,  about the sort of person I ought to marry: and I half suspected in  my heart of hearts he meant if possible always to keep me at home  single to take care of him and look after him. I didn't know, as  yet, he had sufficient reasons of his own for desiring me to remain  for ever unmarried.    
I remembered, too, that I never really loved my father. His nature  was hard, cold, reserved, unsympathetic. I only feared and obeyed  him. At times, my own strong character came out, I remembered, and I  defied him to his face, defied him openly. Then there were scenes in  the house, dreadful scenes, too hateful to dwell upon: and the  servants came up to my room at the end and comforted me.    
So, step by step, Jack reminded me of everything in my own past  life, up to the very night of the murder, from which my Second State  dated. I'd come back from Torquay a week or two before, very full  indeed of Jack, and determined at all costs, sooner or later, to  marry him. But though I had kept all quiet, papa had suspected my  liking on the day of the Berry Pomeroy athletics, and had forbidden  me to see Jack, or to write to him, or to have anything further to  say to him. He was determined, he told me, whoever I married, I  shouldn't at least marry a beggarly doctor. All that I remembered;  and also how, in spite of the prohibition, I wrote letters to Jack,  but could receive none in return--lest my father should see them.    
And still, the central mystery of the murder was no nearer solution.  I held my breath in terror. Had I really any sort of justification  in killing him?    
Dimly and instinctively, as Jack went on, a faint sense of  resentment and righteous indignation against the man with the white  beard rose up vaguely in my mind by slow degrees. I knew I had been  angry with him, I knew I had defied him, but how or why as yet I  knew not.    
Then Jack suddenly paused, and began in a different voice a new part  of his tale. It was nothing I remembered or could possibly remember,  he said; but it was necessary to the comprehension of what came  after, and would help me to recall it. About a week after I left  Torquay, it seemed, Jack was in his consulting-room at Babbicombe  one day, having just returned from a very long bicycle ride--for he  was a first-rate cyclist,--when the servant announced a new  patient; and a very worn-out old man came in to visit him.    
The man had a ragged grey beard and scanty white hair; he was clad  in poor clothes, and had tramped on foot all the way from London to  Babbicombe, where Jack used to practice. But Jack saw at once under  this rough exterior he had the voice and address of a cultivated  gentleman, though he was so broken down by want and long suffering  and exposure and illness that he looked like a beggar just let loose  from the workhouse.    
I held my breath as Jack showed me the poor old man's photograph. It  was a portrait taken after death--for Jack attended him to the end  through a fatal illness;--and it showed a face thin and worn, and  much lined by unspeakable hardships. But I burst out crying at once  the very moment I looked at it. For a second or two, I couldn't say  why: I suppose it was instinct. Blood is thicker than water, they  tell us; and I have the intuition of kindred very strong in me, I  believe. But at any rate, I cried silently, with big hot tears,  while I looked at that dead face of silent suffering, as I never had  cried over the photograph of the respectable-looking man who lay  dead on the floor of the library, and whom I was always taught to  consider my father. Then it came back to me, why... I gazed at it  and grew faint. I clutched Jack's arm for support. I knew what it  meant now. The poor worn old man who lay dead on the bed with that  look of mute agony on his features--was my first papa: the papa in  the loose white linen coat: the one I remembered with childlike love  and trustfulness in my earliest babyish Australian recollections!    
I couldn't mistake the face. It was burnt into my brain now. This  was he, though much older and sadder, and more scarred and lined by  age and weather. It was my very first papa. My own papa. I cried  silently still. I couldn't bear to look at it. Then the real truth  broke upon me once more. This, and this alone, was in very deed my  one real father!    
I seized the faded photograph and pressed it to my lips.    
"Oh, I know him!" I cried wildly. "It's my father! My father!"    
Some minutes passed before Jack could go on with his story. This  rush of emotions was too much for me for a while. I could hardly  hear him or attend to him, so deeply did it stir me.    
At last I calmed down, still holding that pathetic photograph on the  table before me.    
"Tell me all about him," I murmured, sobbing. "For, Jack, I remember  now, he was so good and kind, and I loved him--I loved him."    
Jack went on with his story, trying to soothe me and reassure me.  The old man introduced himself by very cautious degrees as a person  in want, not so much of money, though of that to be sure he had  none, as of kindness and sympathy in a very great sorrow. He was a  shipwrecked mariner, in a sense: shipwrecked on the sea of Life and  on the open Pacific as well. But once he had been a clergyman, and a  man of education, position, reputation, fortune.    
Gradually as he went on Jack began to grasp at the truth of this  curious tale. The worn and battered stranger had but lately landed  in London from a sailing vessel which had brought him over from a  remote Pacific islet: not a tropical islet of the kind with whose  palms and parrots we are all so familiar, but a cold and snowy rock,  away off far south, among the frosts and icebergs, near the  Antarctic continent. There for twenty long years that unhappy man  had lived by himself a solitary life.    
I started at the sound.    
"For twenty years!" I exclaimed. "Oh, Jack, you must be wrong; for  how could that be? I was only eighteen when all this happened. How  could my real father have been twenty years away from me, when I was  only eighteen, and I remember him so perfectly?"    
Jack looked at me and shook his head.    
"You've much to learn yet, Una," he answered. "The story's a long  one. You were <i>not</i> eighteen but twenty-two at the time. You've been  deliberately misled as to your own age all along. You developed  late, and were always short for your real years, not tall and  precocious as we all of us imagined. But you were four years older  than Mr. Callingham pretended. You're twenty-six now, not  twenty-two as you think. Wait, and in time you'll hear all about  it."    
He went on with his story. I listened, spell-bound. The unhappy  man explained to Jack how he had been wrecked on the voyage, and  escaped on a raft with one other passenger: how they had drifted far  south, before waves and current, till they were cast at last on this  wretched island: how they remained there for a month or two, picking  up a precarious living on roots and berries and eggs of sea-birds:  and how at last, one day, he had come back from hunting limpets and  sea-urchins on the shore of a lonely bay--to find, to his  amazement, his companion gone, and himself left alone on that  desolate island. His fellow-castaway, he knew then, had deceived and  deserted him!    
There was no room, indeed, to doubt the treachery of the wretched  being who had so basely treated him. As he looked, a ship under full  sail stood away to northward. In vain the unhappy man made wild  signals from the shore with his tattered garments. No notice was  taken of them. His companion must deliberately have suppressed the  other's existence, and pretended to be alone by himself on the  island.    
"And his name?" Jack asked of the poor old man, horrified.    
The stranger answered without a moment's pause:    
"His name, if you want it--was Vivian Callingham."    
"And yours?" Jack continued, as soon as he could recover from his  first shock of horror.    
"And mine," the poor castaway replied, "is Richard Wharton."    
As Jack told me those words, another strange thrill ran through me.    
"Richard Wharton was the name of mamma's first husband. Then I'm not  a Callingham at all!" I cried, unable to take it all in at first in  its full complexity. "I'm really a Wharton!"    
Jack nodded his head in assent.    
"Yes, you're really a Wharton," he said. "You're the baby that died,  as we all were told. Your true Christian name's Mary. But, Una, you  were always Una to all of us in England; and though the real Una  Callingham died when you were a little girl of three or four years  old, you'll be Una always now to Elsie and me. We can't think of you  as other than we've always called you."    
Then he went on to explain to me how the stranger had landed in  London, alone and friendless, twenty years later, from a passing  Australian merchant vessel which had picked him up on the island.  All those years he had waited, and fed himself on eggs of penguins.  He landed by himself, the crew having given him a suit of old  clothes, and subscribed to find him in immediate necessaries. He  began to inquire cautiously in London about his wife and family. At  first, he could learn little or nothing; for nobody remembered him,  and he feared to ask too openly, a sort of Enoch Arden terror  restraining him from proclaiming his personality till he knew  exactly what had happened in his long absence. But bit by bit, he  found out at last that his wife had married again, and was now long  dead: and that the man she had married was Vivian Callingham, his  own treacherous companion on the Crozet Islands. As soon as he  learned that, the full depth of the man's guilt burst upon him like  a thunderbolt. Richard Wharton understood now why Vivian Callingham  had left him alone on those desert rocks, and sailed away in the  ship without telling the captain of his fellow-castaway's plight. He  saw the whole vile plot the man had concocted at once, and the steps  he had taken to carry it into execution.    
Vivian Callingham, whom I falsely thought my father, had gone back  to Australia with pretended news of Richard Wharton's death. He had  sought my widowed mother in her own home up country, and told her a  lying tale of his devotion to her husband in his dying moments on  that remote ocean speck in the far Southern Pacific. By this story  he ingratiated himself. He knew she was rich: he knew she was worth  marrying: and to marry her, he had left my own real father, Richard  Wharton, to starve and languish for twenty years among rocks and  sea-fowl on a lonely island!    
My blood ran cold at such a tale of deadly treachery. I remembered  now to have heard some small part of it before. But much of it, as  Jack told it to me, was quite new and unexpected. No wonder I had  turned in horror that night from the man I long believed to be my  own father, when I learned by what vile and cruelly treacherous  means he had succeeded in imposing his supposed relationship upon  me! But still, all this brought me no nearer the real question of  questions--why did I shoot him?
