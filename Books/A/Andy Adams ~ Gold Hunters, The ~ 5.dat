  It was some time before Roderick moved from his concealment behind  the rock. It was not fear that held him there, but a knowledge within  him that he needed to think, to collect his senses as he would have  expressed it if Wabi had been with him. For a brief spell he was  stunned by the succession of surprises which he had encountered, and he  felt that now, if ever in his life, he needed control of himself. He  did not attempt to solve the mystery of the trail beyond the fact that  it was not made by a bear and that the handprint on the log was not  made by a man. But he was certain of one thing. In some way Minnetaki  was associated with both.
  When he continued his pursuit he made his way with extreme caution.  At each new turn in the trail he fell behind some rock or clump of  bushes and scanned the gorge as far as he could see ahead of him. But  each moment these distances of observation became shorter. The ridge on  his left became almost a sheer wall; on his right a second ridge closed  in until the gorge had narrowed to a hundred feet in width, choked by  huge masses of rock thrown there in some mighty upheaval of past ages.  It was very soon apparent to Rod that the mysterious person whom he was  pursuing was perfectly at home in the lonely chasm. As straight as a  drawn whip-lash his trail led from one break in the rocky chaos to  another. Never did he err. Once the tracks seemed to end squarely  against a broad face of rock, but there the young hunter found a cleft  in the granite wall scarcely wider than his body, through which he  cautiously wormed his way. Where this cleft opened into the chasm again  the fugitive had rested for a few moments, and had placed some burden  upon the snow at his feet. A single glance disclosed what this burden  had been, for in the snow was that same clearly-defined impression of a  human hand!
  There was no longer a doubt in Roderick's mind. He was on the trail  of Minnetaki's captor, and the outlaw was carrying his victim in his  arms! Minnetaki was injured! Perhaps she was dead. The fear gripped at  his heart until he looked again at the imprint in the snow&#8212;the widely  spread fingers, the flat, firm palm. Only a living hand would have left  its mark in that manner.
  As on that autumn day in the forest, when he had fought for  Minnetaki's life, so now all hesitation and fear left him. His blood  leaped with anticipation rather than excitement, and he was eager for  the moment when he would once more throw his life in the balance in  behalf of Wabi's sister. He was determined to take advantage of the  Woonga fighting code and fire upon his enemy from ambush if the  opportunity offered, but at the same time he had no dread at the  thought of engaging in a closer struggle if this should be necessary.  He looked well to his rifle, loosened his big army revolver in its  holster, and saw that his hunting-knife did not stick in its scabbard.  A short distance from the cleft in the wall of rock the outlaw had  rested again; and this time, when he continued his flight, Minnetaki  had walked beside him.
  A peculiarity in the new trail struck Rod, and for some moments he  was at a loss to account for it. One of the girl's dainty feet left its  moccasin imprint very distinctly; the mark of the other was no more  than a formless blotch in the snow. Then the youth thought of the  footprints that were leading on Mukoki and Wabigoon, and despite his  desperate situation he could not repress a smile. He had been right.  The Woongas had taken off one of Minnetaki's moccasins and were using  it to make a false trail into the northwest. Those formless tracks  ahead of him meant that one of the Indian maiden's feet was wrapped  with a bit of cloth or fur to protect it from the cold.
  Rod soon perceived that the flight of the outlaw and his captive was  now much more rapid, and he quickened his own pace. The chasm grew  wilder. At times it appeared impassable, but always the trail of the  fugitives led straight to some hidden cleft through which the boy  followed, holding his breath in tense expectancy of what might happen  at any instant.
  Suddenly Rod stopped. From ahead of him he was sure that he had  heard a sound. He scarcely breathed while he listened. But there came  no repetition of the noise. Had some animal, a fox or a wolf, perhaps,  set a stone rolling down one of the precipitous walls of the chasm? He  went on slowly, listening, watching. A few paces more and he stopped  again. There was a faint, suspicious odor in the air; a turn around the  end of a huge mass of rock and his nostrils were filled with it, the  pungent odor of smoke mingled with the sweet scent of burning cedar!
  There was a fire ahead of him. More than that, it was not a gunshot  away!
  For a space of sixty seconds he stood still, nerving himself for the  final step. His resolution was made. He would creep upon the outlaw and  shoot him down. There would be no warning, no quarter, no parley. Foot  by foot he advanced, as stealthily as a fox. The odor of smoke came to  him more plainly; over his head he saw thin films of it floating lazily  up the chasm. It came from beyond another of those walls of rock which  seemed to bar his way, creeping up over it as though the fire were just  on the other side. With his rifle half to his shoulder Rod stole  through the break in this wall. At its farther end he peered out  cautiously, exposing his face an inch at a time. Wider and wider became  his vision. There was no trail ahead. The outlaw and his captive were  behind the rock!
  With his rifle now full to his shoulder Rod stepped boldly forth and  whirled to the left. Twenty feet away, almost entirely concealed among  the tumbled masses of boulders, was a small cabin. About it there were  no signs of life with the exception of a thin wreath of smoke rising  like a ghostly spiral up the side of the chasm wall; from it there came  no sound. Rod's index finger quivered on the trigger of his rifle.  Should he wait&#8212;until the outlaw came forth? Half a minute he stood  there, a minute, two minutes, and still he heard nothing, saw nothing.  He advanced a step, then another, and still another, until he saw the  open door of the cabin. And as he stood there, his rifle leveled, there  came to him a faint, sobbing cry, a cry that reached out and caught him  like a strong hand and brought him in a single desperate leap to the  door itself.
  Inside the cabin was Minnetaki, alone! She was crouched upon the  floor, her beautiful hair tumbling in disheveled masses over her  shoulders and into her lap, her face, as white as death, staring wildly  at the youth who had appeared like an apparition before her.
  In an instant Rod was at her side, upon his knees. For that brief  moment he had lost his caution, and only a terrible cry from the girl  turned him back again, half upon his feet, to the door. Standing there,  about to spring upon him, was one of the most terrifying figures he had  ever seen. In a flash he saw the huge form of an Indian, a terrible  face, the gleam of an uplifted knife. In such a crisis one's actions  are involuntary, machine-like, as if life itself, hovering by a thread,  protects itself in its own manner without thought or reasoning on the  part of the human creature it animates. Rod neither thought nor  reasoned; without any motive on his own part, he flung himself face  downward upon the cabin floor. And the move saved him. With a guttural  cry the savage leaped toward him, struck out with his knife and missed,  stumbled over the boy's prostrate form and fell beside him.
  Months of hardship and adventure in the wilderness had made Rod as  lithe as a forest cat, his muscles like steel. Without rising he flung  himself upon his enemy, his own knife raised in gleaming death above  the savage's breast. But the Woonga was as quick. Like a flash he  struck up with one of his powerful arms and the force of the blow that  was descending upon him fell to the earth floor. In another instant his  free arm had encircled Rod's neck, and for a few brief moments the two  were locked in a crushing embrace, neither being able to use the weapon  in his hand without offering an advantage to the other.
  In that respite, which only death could follow, Rod's brain worked  with the swiftness of fire. He was lying face downward upon his enemy;  the Woonga was flat upon his back, the latter's knife hand stretched  out behind his head with Rod's knife hand locking it. For either to  strike a blow both of their fighting hands must be freed. In the first  instant of that freedom, the savage, with his arm already extended,  could deliver a blow sooner than his antagonist, who would have to  raise his arm as well as strike. In other words, by the time Rod's  knife was poised his enemy's would be buried in his breast. With a  curious thrill the white youth saw the fearful odds against him in  their position. If he remained clutched in the Indian's embrace there  would be only one end. He would die, and Minnetaki would be more than  ever in the power of her captor.
  There was only one chance now, and that was to break away, at least  to free himself enough to get hold of his revolver. He was nerving  himself for the strain when, turning his head a trifle sidewise, he saw  Minnetaki. The girl had risen to her feet, and Rod saw that her hands  were bound behind her. She, too, realized the disadvantage of Rod's  position in the contest, and now with a thrilling cry she sprang to the  outlaw's head and stepped with all her weight upon his extended arm.
  &#8220;Quick, Rod&#8212;quick!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Strike! Strike!&#8221;
  With a terrible yell the powerful savage wrenched his arm free; in a  last superhuman effort he swung his knife upward as Rod's blade sank to  the hilt in his breast, and the blow fell with a sickening thud under  Rod's arm. With a sharp cry the young hunter staggered to his feet, and  the Indian's knife fell from him, red with blood. Making an effort to  control himself he picked up the knife and loosed the captive girl's  arms.
  There came over him then a strange dizziness, a weakness in his  limbs. He was conscious that his head was sinking, and he knew, too,  that a pair of arms was about him, and that from what seemed to be a  great, great distance a voice was calling to him, calling his name. And  then he seemed to be sinking into a deep and painless sleep.
  When he regained consciousness his eyes were first turned to the  door, which was still open, and through which he caught the white gleam  of the snow. A hand was pressed gently upon his face.
  &#8220;Rod&#8212;&#8221;
  Minnetaki spoke in a whisper, a whisper that trembled with gladness,  with relief. Rod smiled. Weakly he lifted a hand and touched the sweet,  white face above him.
  &#8220;I'm glad to see you&#8212;Minnetaki&#8212;&#8221; he breathed.
  The girl quickly put a cup of cold water to his lips.
  &#8220;You mustn't try to move,&#8221; she said softly, her eyes glowing. &#8220;It  isn't a very bad wound, and I've dressed it nicely. But you mustn't  move&#8212;or talk&#8212;or it may begin bleeding again.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I'm so glad to see you, Minnetaki,&#8221; persisted the youth. &#8220;You  don't know how disappointed I was to find you gone when we returned to  Wabinosh House from our hunting trip. Wabi and Mukoki&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Sh-h-h-h!&#8221;
  Minnetaki placed her hand upon his lips.
  &#8220;You must keep quiet, Roderick. Don't you know how curious I am to  know how you are here? But you must not tell me&#8212;now. Let me do the  talking. Will you? Please!&#8221;
  Involuntarily the young girl's eyes left his face, and Rod, weakly  following her gaze, saw that a blanket had been spread over a huddled  heap in the middle of the floor. He shuddered, and feeling the sudden  tremor in his hand Minnetaki turned to him quickly, her cheeks whiter  than before, but her eyes shining like stars.
  &#8220;It is Woonga,&#8221; she whispered. In her voice was a thrilling tremble.  &#8220;It is Woonga, and he is dead!&#8221;
  Rod understood the look in her face now. Woonga, the Nemesis of her  people, the outlaw chief who had sworn vengeance on the house of  Wabinosh, and whose murderous hand had hovered for years like a  threatening cloud over the heads of the factor and his wife and  children, was dead! And he, Roderick Drew, who once before had saved  Minnetaki's life, had killed him. In his weakness and pain he smiled,  and said,
  &#8220;I am glad, Minne&#8212;&#8221;
  He did not finish. There had come a stealthy, crumbling step to the  door, and in another moment Mukoki and Wabigoon were in the little  cabin.
