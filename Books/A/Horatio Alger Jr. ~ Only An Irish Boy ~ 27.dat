  Fairfax had an object in remaining behind. He wanted to see if there  was any way for him to get into Andy's room during the night, that he  might rob him in his sleep. To his great satisfaction, he found that  there was a door between the two rooms, for the accommodation of  persons in the same party, who wished to be in adjoining apartments. It  was, however, locked, but Fairfax was not unprepared for such an  emergency. He took a bunch of keys from his pocket, and tried them, one  after another, in the lock. There was one that would very nearly fit.  For this again, Fairfax was prepared. He took from the same pocket a  file, and began patiently to file away the key till it should fit. He  tried it several times before he found that it fitted. But at last  success crowned his efforts. The door opened.
  His eyes danced with exultation, as he saw this.
  &#8220;I might as well be in the same room,&#8221; he said, to himself. &#8220;Now,  you young rascal, I shall take your money, and be revenged upon you at  the same time.&#8221;
  He carefully locked the door, and then, feeling that he had done all  that was necessary to do at present, went downstairs, and took supper.  Andy was out, and did not see him.
  Meanwhile, our young hero was out seeing the sights. He walked up  Washington Street, and at Boylston Street turned and reached Tremont  Street, when he saw the Common before him. It looked pleasant, and Andy  crossed the street, and entered. He walked wherever fancy led, and then  found himself, after a while, in a comparatively secluded part. Here he  met with an adventure, which I must describe.
  Rather a shabby-looking individual in front of him suddenly stooped  and picked up a pocketbook, which appeared to be well filled with  money. He looked up, and met Andy's eyes fixed upon it. This was what  he wanted.
  &#8220;Here's a pocketbook,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Somebody must have dropped it.&#8221;
  Andy was interested.
  &#8220;It seems to have considerable money in it,&#8221; said the finder.
  &#8220;Open it, and see,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;I hain't time. I have got to leave the city by the next train. I  mean, I haven't time to advertise it, and get the reward which the  owner will be sure to offer. Are you going to stay in the city long?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm going out to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;I must go. I wish I knew what to do.&#8221;
  He seemed to be plunged into anxious thought.
  &#8220;I'll tell you what I'll do,&#8221; he said, as if a bright idea had  suddenly struck him. &#8220;You take the pocketbook, and advertise it. If the  owner is found, he will give you a reward. If not, the whole will  belong to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;Hand it over.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;I shall expect something myself, as I  was the one to find it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll give you half.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I shall be out of the city. I'll tell you what give me ten  dollars, and I'll make it over to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's rather steep,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;Heft it. There must be a lot of money inside.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm afraid the reward might be less than ten dollars,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;Well, I'm in a great hurry&#8212;give me five.&#8221;
  It is possible that Andy, who was not acquainted with the &#8220;drop  game,&#8221; might have agreed to this, but a policeman hove in sight, and  the shabby individual scuttled away without further ceremony, leaving  Andy a little surprised, with the pocketbook in his hand.
  &#8220;What's he in such a hurry for?&#8221; thought our hero.
  He opened the pocketbook, and a light flashed upon him, as he  perceived that there was no money inside, but was stuffed with rolls of  paper.
  &#8220;He wanted to swindle me,&#8221; thought Andy. &#8220;It's lucky I didn't pay  him five dollars. Anyway, I'll keep it. The pocketbook is worth  something.&#8221;
  He put it in his pocket, without taking the trouble to remove the  contents.
