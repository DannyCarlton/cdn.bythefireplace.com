<b>GLOUCESTER, AUGUST, 1720</b> 
The wind it wailed, the wind it moaned,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the white caps flecked the sea;<br> "An' I would to God," the skipper groaned,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I had not my boy with me!" 
Snug in the stern-sheets, little John<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Laughed as the scud swept by;<br> But the skipper's sunburnt cheek grew wan<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he watched the wicked sky. 
"Would he were at his mother's side!"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the skipper's eyes were dim.<br> "Good Lord in heaven, if ill betide,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What would become of him! 
"For me--my muscles are as steel,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For me let hap what may;<br> I might make shift upon the keel<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the break o' day. 
"But he, he is so weak and small,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So young, scarce learned to stand--<br> O pitying Father of us all,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I trust him in Thy hand! 
"For Thou, who markest from on high<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sparrow's fall--each one!--<br> Surely, O Lord, thou'lt have an eye<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On Alec Yeaton's son!" 
Then, helm hard-port; right straight he sailed<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Towards the headland light:<br> The wind it moaned, the wind it wailed,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And black, black fell the night. 
Then burst a storm to make one quail<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though housed from winds and waves--<br> They who could tell about that gale<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must rise from watery graves! 
Sudden it came, as sudden went;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ere half the night was sped,<br> The winds were hushed, the waves were spent,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the stars shone overhead. 
Now, as the morning mist grew thin,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The folk on Gloucester shore<br> Saw a little figure floating in<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secure, on a broken oar! 
Up rose the cry, "A wreck! a wreck!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pull, mates, and waste no breath!"--<br> They knew it, though 'twas but a speck<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the edge of death! 
Long did they marvel in the town<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At God his strange decree,<br> That let the stalwart skipper drown<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the little child go free!
