Dawn came, very clear and beautiful, with the air crisp and cool. Robert  divided the last of the venison between Tayoga and himself, and when he  had eaten his portion he was still hungry. He was quite certain that the  Onondaga also craved more, but a stoic like Tayoga would never admit it.  His belief the day before that this was the time for him to go forth and  hunt was confirmed. The game would be out, and so might be the savages,  but he must take the chance.    
Tayoga had kept his bow and quiver of arrows strapped to his back during  their retreat, and now they lay on a shelf in the cave. Robert looked at  them doubtfully and the eyes of the Onondaga followed him.    
"Perhaps it would be best," he said.    
"I can't bend the bow of Ulysses," said Robert, "but I may be able to  send in a useful arrow or two nevertheless."    
"You can try."    
"But I don't want any shot to go amiss."    
"Strap your rifle on your back, and take the bow and arrows also. If the  arrows fail you, or rather if you should fail the arrows, which always  go where they are sent, you can take the rifle, with which you are  almost as good as the Great Bear himself. And if you should encounter  hostile warriors prowling through the woods the rifle will be your best  defense."    
"I'll do as you advise, Tayoga, and do you keep a good watch at the  entrance. You're feeling a lot stronger today, are you not?"    
"So much so that I am almost tempted to take the bow and arrows myself,  while I leave you on guard."    
"Don't be too proud and boastful. Let's see you walk across the cave."    
Tayoga rose from the bed of leaves, on which he had been sitting, and  strode firmly back and forth two or three times. He was much thinner  than he had been a week before, but his eyes were sparkling now and the  bronze of his skin was clear and beautiful. All his nerves and muscles  were under complete control.    
"You're a great warrior again, Tayoga, thanks to my protecting care,"  said Robert, "but I don't think you're yet quite the equal of Tododaho  and Hayowentha when they walked the earth, and, for that reason, I shall  not let you go out hunting. Now, take your rifle, which I saved along  with you, and sit on that ledge of stone, where you can see everything  approaching the cave and not be seen yourself."    
"I obey, O Dagaeoga. I obey you always when the words you speak are  worth being obeyed. See, I take the seat you direct, and I hold my rifle  ready."    
"Very good. Be prepared to fire on an instant's notice, but be sure you  don't fire at me when I come striding down the valley bearing on my  shoulders a fat young deer that I have just killed."    
"Have no fear, Dagaeoga. I shall be too glad to see you and the deer to  fire."    
With the rifle so adjusted across his back that, if need be, he could  disengage it at once, the quiver fastened also and Tayoga's bow in his  hand, Robert made ready.    
"Now, Tayoga," he said, "exert that famous will of yours like a true  medicine man of the Hodenosaunee. While I am absent, so direct me with  the concentrated power of your mind that I shall soon find a fat young  deer, and that my arrow shall not miss. I'll gratefully receive all the  help you can give me in this way, though I won't neglect, if I see the  deer, to take the best aim I can with bow and arrow."    
"Do not scoff, O Dagaeoga. The lore and belief of my nation and of the  whole Hodenosaunee are based upon the experience of many centuries. And  do you not say in your religion that the prayer of the righteous  availeth? Do you think your God, who is the same as my Manitou, intended  that only the prayers of the white men should have weight, and that  those of the red men should vanish into nothingness like a snowflake  melting in the air? I may not be righteous,--who knows whether he is  righteous or not?--but, at least, I shall pray in a righteous cause."    
"I don't mock, Tayoga, and maybe the power of your wish, poured in a  flood upon me, will help. Yes, I know it will, and I go now, sure that I  will soon find what I seek."    
He left the cave and passed up the valley, full of confidence. The  earnestness of Tayoga had made a great impression upon him, clothing him  about with an atmosphere that was surcharged with belief, and, as he  breathed in this air, it made his veins fairly sparkle, not alone with  hope, but with certainty.    
He walked up a deep defile which gradually grew shallower, and then  ascended rapidly. Finally he came out on a crest, crowned with splendid  trees, and he drew a great breath of pleasure as he looked upon a vast  green wilderness, deepened in color by the long and recent rains, and  upon the far western horizon a dim but splendid band of silver which he  knew was Andiatarocte. A lover of beauty, and with the soul of a poet,  he could have stood, gazing a long time, but there was a sterner task  forward than the contemplation of nature in the wild.    
He must sink the poet in the hunter, and he began to look for tracks of  game, which he felt sure would be plentiful in the forest, since men had  long been hunting one another instead of the deer. He had an abundance  of will of his own, but he felt also, despite a certain incredulity of  the reason, that the concentrated will of his distant comrade was  driving him on.    
He walked about a mile, remaining well under cover, having a double  object, to keep himself hidden from foes and also to find traces of  game. His confidence that he would find it, and very quickly, was not  abated, and, at the end of a mile, he saw a broad footprint on the turf  that made him utter a low exclamation of delight. It was larger than  that of a cow, and more pointed. He knew at once that it had been made  by a moose, the great animal which was then still to be found in the  forests of Northern New York.    
The tracks led northward and he studied them with care. The wind had  risen and was blowing toward him, which was favorable for his pursuit,  as the sound of his own footsteps rustling the grass or breaking a  little stick would not be likely to reach the ear of the moose. He was  convinced, too, that the tracks were not much more than two hours old,  and since the big animal was likely to be rambling along, nibbling at  the twigs, the chance was in favor of the hunter overtaking him very  soon.    
It was easy to follow the trail, the hoof prints were so large, and he  soon saw, too, the broken ends of twigs that had been nibbled by the  moose, and also exposed places on the trunks of trees where the bark had  been peeled off by the animal's teeth. He was sure that the game could  not be much more than a mile ahead, and his soul was filled with the  ardor of the chase. He was confident that he was pursuing a big bull, as  the fact was indicated by the size of the prints, the length of the  stride, and the height at which the moose had browsed on the twigs.  There were other facts he had learned among the Iroquois, indicating to  him it was a bull. While the tracks were pointed, they were less pointed  than those the cow generally makes, and the twigs that had been nibbled  were those of the fir, while the cow usually prefers the birch.    
The tracks now seemed to Robert to grow much fresher. Tayoga, with his  infallible eye and his wonderful gifts, both inherited and improved,  would have known just how fresh they were, but Robert was compelled to  confine his surmise to the region of the comparative. Nevertheless, he  knew that he was gaining upon the moose and that was enough. But as it  was evident by his frequent browsing that the animal was going slowly,  he controlled his eagerness sufficiently to exercise great wariness on  his own part. It might be that while he was hunting he could also become  the hunted. It was not at all impossible that the warriors of Tandakora  would fall upon his own track and follow.    
He looked back apprehensively, and once he returned and retraced his  steps for a little distance, but he could discern no evidence of an  enemy and he resumed his pursuit of the moose, going faster now, and  seeing twigs which apparently had been broken off only a few minutes  before. Then, as he topped a little rise, he saw the animal itself,  browsing lazily on the succulent bushes. It was a large moose, but to  Robert, although an experienced hunter, it loomed up at the moment like  an elephant. He had staked so much upon securing the game, and the issue  was so important that his heart beat hard with excitement.    
The wind was still in his favor, and, creeping as near as he dared, he  fitted an arrow to Tayoga's bow and pulled the string. The arrow struck  well in behind the shoulder and the moose leaped high. Another arrow  sang from the bow and found its heart, after which it ran a few steps  and fell. Robert's laborious task began, to remove at least a part of  the skin, and then great portions of the meat, as much as he could  carry, wrapped in the folds of the skin, portions from which he intended  to make steaks.    
He secured at least fifty pounds, and then he looked with regret at the  great body. He was not one to slay animals for sport's sake, and he  wished that the rangers and Mohawks might have the hundreds of pounds  of good moose meat, but he knew it was not destined for them. As he drew  away with his own burden his heirs to the rest were already showing  signs of their presence. From the thick bushes about came the rustling  of light feet, and now and then an eager and impatient snarl. Red eyes  showed, and as he turned away the wolves of the hills made a wild rush  for the fallen monarch. Robert, for some distance, heard them yapping  and snarling over the feast, and, despite his own success in securing  what he needed so badly, he felt remorse because he had been compelled  to give so fine an animal over to the wolves.    
His heart grew light again as he made his way back to the defile and the  cave. He carried enough food to last Tayoga and himself many days, if  necessity compelled them to remain long in the cave, but he did not  forget in his triumph to take every precaution for the hiding of his  trail, devoutly glad that it was hard ground, thick with stones, on  which he could step from one to another.    
Thus he returned, bearing his burden, and Tayoga, sitting near the  entrance, rifle on knee, greeted him with becoming words as one whom  Tododaho and Areskoui had guided to victory.    
"It is well, Dagaeoga," he said. "I was wishing for you to find a moose  and you found one. You were not compelled to use the rifle!"    
"No, the bow served, but I had to shoot two arrows where you would have  shot only one."    
"It is no disgrace to you. The bow is not the white man's weapon, at  least not on this continent. You withdrew the arrows, cleaned them and  returned them to the quiver?"    
"Yes. I didn't forget that. I know how precious arrows are, and now,  Tayoga, since it's important for you to get back your strength faster  than a wounded man ever got it back before, I think we'd better risk a  fire, and broil some of these fat, juicy steaks."    
"It is a danger, but we will do it. You gather the dead wood and we will  build the fire beside the mouth of the cave. Both of us can cook."    
It was an easy task for two such foresters to light a fire with flint  and steel, and they soon had a big bed of coals. Then they broiled the  steaks on the ends of sharpened sticks, passing them back and forth  quickly, in order to retain the juices.    
"Now, Tayoga," announced Robert, "I have a word or two to say to you."    
"Then say them quickly and do not let your eloquence become a stream,  because I am hungry and would eat, and where the moose steaks are plenty  talk is needed but little."    
"I merely wished to tell you that besides being our hunter, I'm also the  family doctor. Hence I give you my instructions."    
"What are they, O youth of many words?"    
"You can eat just as much of the moose steak as you like, and the  quicker you begin the better you will please me, because my manners  won't allow me to start first. Fall on, Tayoga! Fall on!"    
They ate hungrily and long. They would have been glad had they bread  also, but they did not waste time in vain regrets. When they had  finished and the measure of their happiness was full, they extinguished  the coals carefully, hid their store of moose meat on a high ledge in  the cave, and withdrew also to its shelter.    
"How much stronger do you feel now, Tayoga?" asked Robert.    
"In the language of your schools, my strength has increased at least  fifty per cent in the last hour."    
"I've the strength of two men myself now, and thinking it over, Tayoga,  I've come to the conclusion that was the best moose I ever tasted. He  was a big bull, and he may not have been young, but he furnished good  steaks. I'm sorry he had to die, but he died in a good cause."    
"Even so, Dagaeoga, and since we have eaten tremendously and have cooked  much of the meat for further use, it would be best for us to put out the  fire, and hide all trace of it, a task in which I am strong enough to  help you."    
They extinguished carefully every brand and coal, and even went so far  as to take dead leaves from the cave and throw them over the remains of  the fire in careless fashion as if they had been swept there by the  wind.    
"And now," said Robert, "if I had the power I would summon from the sky  another mighty rain to hide all signs of our banquet and of the  preparations for it. Suppose, Tayoga, you pray to Tododaho and Areskoui  for it and also project your mind so forcibly in the direction of your  wish that the wish will come true."    
"It is well not to push one's favor too far," replied Tayoga gravely.  "The heavens are too bright and shining now for rain. Moreover, if one  should pray every day for help, Tododaho and Areskoui would grow tired  of giving it. I think, however, that we have covered our traces well,  and the chance of discovery here by our enemies is remote."    
They put away the moose meat on a high ledge in the cave, and sat down  again to wait. Tayoga's wound was healing rapidly. The miracle for which  he had hoped was happening. His recovery was faster than that of any  other injured warrior whom he had ever known. He could fairly feel the  clean flesh knitting itself together in innumerable little fibers, and  already he could move his left arm, and use the fingers of his left  hand. Being a stoic, and hiding his feelings as he usually did, he said:    
"I shall recover, I shall be wholly myself again in time for the great  battle between the army of Waraiyageh and that of Dieskau."    
"I think, too, that we'll be in it," said Robert confidently. "Armies  move slowly and they won't come together for quite a while yet.  Meantime, I'm wondering what became of the rangers and the Mohawks."    
"We shall have to keep on wondering, but I am thinking it likely that  they prevailed over the forces of St. Luc and have passed on toward  Crown Point and Oneadatote. It may be that the present area of conflict  has passed north and east of us and we have little to fear from our  enemies."    
"It sounds as if you were talking out of a book again, Tayoga, but I  believe you're right."    
"I think the only foes whom we may dread in the next night and day are  four-footed."    
"You mean the wolves?"    
"Yes, Dagaeoga. When you left the body of the moose did they not  appear?"    
"They were fighting over it before I was out of sight. But they wouldn't  dare to attack you and me."    
"It is a strange thing, Dagaeoga, but whenever there is war in the woods  among men the wolves grow numerous, powerful and bold. They know that  when men turn their arms upon one another they are turned aside from the  wolves. They hang upon the fringes of the bands and armies, and where  the wounded are they learn to attack. I have noticed, too, since the  great war began that we have here bigger and fiercer wolves than any  we've ever known before, coming out of the vast wilderness of the far  north."    
"You mean the timber wolves, those monsters, five or six feet long, and  almost as powerful and dangerous as a tiger or a lion?"    
"So I do, Dagaeoga, and they will be abroad tonight, led by the body of  your moose and the portion we have here. Tododaho, sitting on his star,  has whispered to me that we are about to incur a great danger, one that  we did not expect."    
"You give me a creepy feeling, Tayoga. All this is weird and uncanny.  We've nothing to fear from wolves."    
"A thousand times we might have nothing to fear from them, but one time  we will, and this is the time. In a voice that I did not hear, but which  I felt, Tododaho told me so, and I know."    
"Then all we have to do is to build a fire in front of the cave mouth  and shut them off as thoroughly, as if we had raised a steel wall before  us."    
"The danger from a fire burning all night would be too great. While I do  not think any warriors of the enemy are wandering in this immediate  region, yet it is possible, and our bonfire would be a beacon to draw  them."    
"Then we'll have to meet 'em with bullets, but the reports of our rifles  might also draw Tandakora's warriors."    
"We will not use the rifles. We will sit at the entrance of the cave,  and you shall fight them with my bow and arrows. If we are pressed too  hard, we may resort to the rifles."    
Tayoga's words were so earnest and sententious, his manner so much that  of a prophet, that Robert, in spite of himself, believed in the great  impending danger that would come in the dark, and the hair on the back  of his neck lifted a little. Yet the day was still great and shining,  the forest tinted gold with the flowing sunlight, and the pure fresh air  blowing into the cave. There the two youths, the white and the red, took  their seats at either side of the entrance. Tayoga held his rifle across  his knees, but Robert put his and the quiver at his feet, while he held  the bow and one arrow in his hands.    
They talked a little from time to time and then relapsed into a long  silence. Robert noticed that nothing living stirred in the defile. No  more rabbits came out to play and no birds sang in the trees. He  considered it a sign, nay more, an omen that Tayoga's prediction was  coming true. The peril threatening them was great and imminent. His  sense of the sinister and uncanny increased. A chill ran through his  veins. The great shining day was going, and, although it was midsummer,  a cold wind was herald of the coming twilight. He shivered again, and  looked at the long shadows falling in the defile.    
"Tayoga," he said, "that uncanny talk of yours has affected me, but I  believe you've just made it all up. No wolves are coming to attack us."    
"Dagaeoga does not believe anything of the kind. He believes, instead,  what I have told him. His voice and his manner show it. He is sure the  wolves are coming."    
"You're right, Tayoga, I do believe it. There's every reason why I  shouldn't, but, in very truth and fact, I do. Our fine day is going  fast. Look how the twilight is growing on the mountains. From our nook  here I can just see the rim of the sun, who is your God, Areskoui. Soon  he will be gone entirely and then all the ridges will be lost in the  dusk. I hope--and I'm not jesting either--that you've said your prayer  to him."    
"As I told you, Dagaeoga, one must not ask too many favors. But now the  sun is wholly gone and the night will be dark. The wind rises and it  moans like the soul of an evil warrior condemned to wander between  heaven and earth. The night will be dark, and in two hours the wolves  will be here."    
Robert looked at him, but the face of the Onondaga was that of a seer,  and once more the blood of the white youth ran chill in his veins. He  was silent again, and now the minutes were leaden-footed, so slow, in  truth, that it seemed an hour would never pass and the two hours Tayoga  had predicted were an eternity. The afterglow disappeared and the  darkness was deep in the defile. The trees above were fused into a black  mass, and then, after an infinity of waiting, a faint note, sinister and  full of menace, came out of the wilderness. Tayoga and Robert glanced at  each other.    
"It is as you predicted," said Robert.    
"It is the howl of the great timber wolf from the far north who has made  himself the leader of the band," said the Onondaga. "When he howls again  he will be much nearer."    
Robert waited for an almost breathless minute or two, and then came the  malignant note, much nearer, as Tayoga had predicted, and directly after  came other howls, faint but equally sinister.    
"The great leader gives tongue a second time," said Tayoga, "and his  pack imitate him, but their voices are not so loud, because their lungs  are not so strong. They come straight toward us. Do you see, Dagaeoga,  that your nerves are steady, your muscles strong and your eyes bright. I  would that I could use the bow myself tonight, for the chance will be  glorious, but Manitou has willed otherwise. It is for you, Dagaeoga, to  handle my weapon as if you had been familiar with it all your life."    
"I will do my best, Tayoga. No man can do more."    
"Dagaeoga's best is very good indeed. Remember that if they undertake to  rush us we will use our rifles, but they are to be held in reserve.  Hark, the giant leader howls for the third time!"    
The long, piercing note came now from a point not very distant. Heard  in all the loneliness of the black forest it was inexpressively  threatening and evil. Not until his own note died did the howl of his  pack follow. All doubts that Robert may have felt fled at once. He  believed everything that Tayoga had said, and he knew that the  wolf-pack, reenforced by mighty timber wolves from the far north, was  coming straight toward the cave for what was left of the moose meat and  Tayoga and himself. His nerves shook for an instant, but the next moment  he put them under command, and carefully tested the bowstring.    
"It is good and strong," he said to Tayoga. "It will not be any fault of  the bow and arrow if the work is not done well. The fault will be mine  instead."    
"You will not fail, Dagaeoga," said the Onondaga. "Your great  imagination always excites you somewhat before the event, but when it  comes you are calm and steady."    
"I'll try to prove that you estimate me correctly."    
As their eyes were used to the dusk they could see each other well,  sitting on opposite sides of the cave mouth and sheltered by the  projection of the rocks. The great wolf howled once more and the pack  howled after him, but there followed an interval of silence that caused  Robert to think they had, perhaps, turned aside. But Tayoga whispered  presently:    
"I see the leader on the opposite side of the defile among the short  bushes. The pack is farther back. They know, of course, that we are  here. The leader is, as we surmised, a huge timber wolf, come down from  the far north. Do not shoot, Dagaeoga, until you get a good chance."    
"Do you think I should wait for the leader himself?"    
"No. Often the soul of a wicked warrior goes into the body of a wolf,  and the wolf becomes wicked, and also full of craft. The leader may not  come forward at first himself, but will send others to receive our  blows."    
There was no yapping and snarling from the wolves such as was usual, and  such as Robert had often heard, but they had become a phantom pack,  silent and ghost-like, creeping among the bushes, sinister and  threatening beyond all reckoning. Robert began to feel that, in very  truth, it was a phantom pack, and he wondered if his arrows, even if  they struck full and true, would slay. Nature, in her chance moments,  touches one among the millions with genius, and she had so tipped him  with living fire. His vivid and powerful imagination often made him see  things others could not see and caused him to clothe objects in colors  invisible to common eyes.    
Now the wolves, with their demon leader, were moving in silence among  the bushes, and he felt that in truth he would soon be fighting with  what Tayoga called evil spirits. For the moment, not the demon leader  alone, but every wolf represented the soul of a wicked warrior, and they  would approach with all the cunning that the warriors had known and  practiced in their lives.    
"Do you see the great beast now, Tayoga?" he whispered.    
"No, he is behind a rock, but there is another slinking forward, drawing  himself without noise over the ground. He must have been in life a  savage from the far region, west of the Great Lakes, perhaps an eater of  his own kind, as the wolf eats his."    
"I see him, Tayoga, just there on the right where the darkness lies like  a shroud. I see his jaws slavering too. He comes forward as a stalker,  and I've no doubt the soul of a most utter savage is hidden in his body.  He shall meet my arrow."    
"Wait a little, Dagaeoga, until you can be sure of your shot. There is  another creeping forward on the left in the same manner, and you'll want  to send a second arrow quickly at him."    
"I never saw a wolf-pack attack in this way before. They come like a  band of warriors with scouts and skirmishers, and I can see that they  have a force massed in the center for the main rush."    
"In a few more seconds you can take the wolf on the right. Bury your  arrow in his throat. It is as I said, Dagaeoga. Now that the moment has  come your hand is steady, your nerves are firm, and even in the dusk I  can see that your eyes are bright."    
It was true. Robert's imagination had painted the danger in the most  vivid colors, but now, that it was here, the beat of his pulse was as  regular as the ticking of a clock. Yet the unreal and sinister  atmosphere that clothed him about was not dispelled in the least, and he  could not rid himself of the feeling that in fighting them he was  fighting dead and gone warriors.    
Nearer and nearer came the great wolf on his right, dragging his body  over the ground for all the world like a creeping Indian. Robert's eyes,  become uncommonly keen in the dusk, saw the long fangs, the slavering  jaws and the red eyes, and he also saw the spot in the pulsing throat  where he intended that the sharp point of his arrow should strike.    
"Now!" whispered Tayoga.    
Robert fitted the shaft to the string, and deftly throwing his weight  into it bent the great bow. Then he loosed the arrow, and, singing  through the air, it buried itself almost to the feather in the big  beast's throat, just at the spot that he had chosen. The strangled howl  of despair and death that followed was almost like that of a human  being, but Robert did not stop to listen, as with all speed he fitted  another arrow to the string and fired at the beast on the left, with  equal success, piercing him in the heart.    
"Well done, Dagaeoga," whispered Tayoga. "Two shots and two wolves  slain. The skirmisher on the right and the skirmisher on the left both  are gone. There will be a wait now while the living devour their dead  comrades. Listen, you can hear them dragging the bodies into the  bushes."    
"After they have finished their cannibalism perhaps they will go away."    
"No, it is a great pack, and they are very hungry. In ten or fifteen  minutes they will be stalking us again. You must seek a shot at the  giant leader, but it will be hard for you to get it because he will keep  himself under cover, while he sends forth his warriors to meet your  arrows. Ah, he is great and cunning! Now, I am more sure than ever that  his body contains the soul of one of the most wicked of all warriors,  perhaps that of a brother of Tandakora. Yes, it must be a brother, the  blood of Tandakora."    
"Then Tandakora's brother would better beware. My desire to slay him  has increased, and if he's incautious and I get good aim I think I can  place an arrow so deep in him that the Ojibway's wicked soul will have  to seek another home."    
"Hear them growling and snarling in the bushes. It is over their  cannibalistic feast. Soon they will have finished and then they will  come back to us."    
The deadly stalking, more hideous than that carried on by men, because  it was more unnatural, was resumed. Robert discharged a third arrow, but  the fierce yelp following told him that he had inflicted only a wound.  He glanced instinctively at the Onondaga, fearing a reproof, but Tayoga  merely said:    
"If one shoots many times one must miss sometimes."    
A fourth shot touched nothing, but the Onondaga had no rebuke, a fifth  shot killed a wolf, a sixth did likewise, and Robert's pride returned.  The wolves drew off, to indulge in cannibalism again, and to consult  with their leader, who carried the soul of a savage in his body.    
Robert had sought in vain for a fair shot at the giant wolf. He had  caught one or two glimpses of him, but they were too fleeting for the  flight of an arrow, and, despite all reason and logic, he found himself  accepting Tayoga's theory that he was, in reality, a lost brother of  Tandakora, marshaling forward his forces, but keeping himself secure.  After the snarling and yelping over the horrible repast, another silence  followed in the bushes.    
"Perhaps they've had enough and have gone away," said Robert, hazarding  the hopeful guess a second time.    
"No. They will make a new attack. They care nothing for those that have  fallen. Watch well, Dagaeoga, and keep your arrows ready."    
"I think I'll become a good bowman in time," said Robert lightly, to  ease his feelings, "because I'm getting a lot of practice, and it seems  that I'll have a lot more. Perhaps I need this rest, but, so far as my  feelings are concerned, I wish the wolves would come on and make a final  rush. Their silence and invisibility are pretty hard on the nerves."    
He examined the bow carefully again, and put six arrows on the floor of  the cave beside him, with the quiver just beyond them. Tayoga sat  immovable, his rifle across his knees, ready in the last emergency to  use the bullet. Thus more time passed in silence and without action.    
It often seemed to Robert afterward that there was something unnatural  about both time and place. The darkness came down thicker and heavier,  and to his imaginative ear it had a faint sliding sound like the  dropping of many veils. So highly charged had become his faculties that  they were able to clothe the intangible and the invisible with bodily  reality. He glanced across at his comrade, whom his accustomed eyes  could see despite the blackness of the night. Tayoga was quite still. So  far as Robert could tell he had not stirred by a hair's breadth in the  last hour.    
"Do you hear anything?" whispered the white youth.    
"Nothing," replied the Onondaga. "Not even a dead leaf stirs before the  wind. There is no wind to stir it. But I think the pack will be coming  again very soon. They will not leave us until you shoot their demon  leader."    
"You mean Tandakora's brother! If I get a fair chance I'll certainly  send my best arrow at him, and I'm only sorry that it's not Tandakora  himself. You persist in your belief that the soul of a wicked warrior is  in the body of the wolf?"    
"Of course! As I have said, it is surely a brother of Tandakora, because  Tandakora himself is alive, and, as it cannot be his own, it must be  that of a monstrous one so much like his that it can be only a  brother's. That is why the wolf leader is so large, so fierce and so  cunning. I persist, too, in saying that all the wolves of this pack  contain the souls of wicked warriors. It is natural that they should  draw together and hunt together, and hunt men as they hunted them in  life."    
"I'm not disputing you, Tayoga. Both day and night have more things than  I can ever hope to understand, but it seems to me that night has the  more. I've been listening so hard, Tayoga, that I can't tell now where  imagination ends and reality begins, but I think I hear a footfall, as  soft as that of a leaf dropping to the ground, but a footfall just the  same."    
"I hear it too, Dagaeoga, and it is not the dropping of a leaf. It is a  wolf creeping forward, seeking to stalk us. He is on the right, and  there are others on both right and left. Now I know they are warriors,  or have been, since they use the arts of warriors rather than those of  wolves."    
"But if they should get in here they would use the teeth and claws of  wolves."    
"Teeth and claws are no worse than the torch, the faggot and the stake,  perhaps better. I hear two sliding wolves now, Dagaeoga, but I know that  neither is the giant leader. As before, he keeps under cover, while he  sends forward others to the attack."    
"Which proves that Tandakora's brother is a real general. I think I can  make out a dim outline now. It is that of the first wolf on the right,  and he does slide forward as if he were a warrior and not a wolf. I  think I'll give him an arrow."    
"Wait until he comes a dozen feet nearer, Dagaeoga, and you can be quite  sure. But when you do shoot snatch up another arrow quicker than you  ever did before in your life, because the leader, thinking you are not  ready, may jump from the shelter of the rocks to drive the rest of the  pack in a rush upon us."    
"You speak as if they were human beings, Tayoga."    
"Such is my thought, Dagaeoga."    
"Very well. I'll bear in mind what you say, and I'll pick an arrow for  Tandakora's brother."    
He chose a second arrow carefully and put it on the ledge beside him,  where it required but one sweep of his hand to seize it and fit it to  the string, when the first had been sent. He now distinctly saw the  creeping wolf, and again fancy laid hold of him and played strange  tricks with his eyes. The creeping figure changed. It was not that of a  wolf, but a warrior, intent upon his life. A strange terror, the terror  of the weird and unknown, seized him, but in an instant it passed, and  he drew the bowstring. When he loosed it the arrow stood deep in the  wolf's throat, but Robert did not see it. His eyes passed on like a  flash of lightning to a gigantic form that upreared itself from the  rocks, an enormous wolf with red eyes, glistening fangs and slavering  jaws.    
"Now!" shot forth Tayoga.    
Robert had already fitted a second arrow to the string and the immense  throat presented a target full and fair. Now, as always in the moment of  imminent crisis, his nerves were steady, never had they been more  steady, and his eyes pierced the darkness. Never before and never again  did he bend so well the bow of Ulysses. The arrow, feathered and barbed,  hummed through the air, going as straight and swift as a bullet to its  mark, and then it pierced the throat of the wolf so deep that the barb  stood out on one side and the feathers on the other.    
The wolf uttered a horrible growling shriek that was almost human to  Robert, leaped convulsively back and out of sight, but for a minute or  two they heard him threshing among the rocks and bushes. The whole pack  uttered a dismal howl. Their sliding sounds ceased, and the last dim  figure vanished.    
"I think it is all over with Tandakora's brother," said Robert.    
Tayoga said nothing, and Robert glanced at him. Beads of perspiration  stood on the brow of the Onondago, but his eyes glittered.    
"You have shot well tonight, O Dagaeoga," he said. "Never did a man  shoot better. Tonight you have been the greatest bowman in all the  world. You have slain the demon wolf, the leader of the pack. Perhaps  the wicked soul that inhabited his body has gone to inhabit the body of  another evil brute, but we are delivered. They will not attack again."    
"How do you know that, Tayoga?"    
"Because Tododaho, Tododaho who protects us, is whispering it to me. I  do not see him, but he is leaning down from his star, and his voice  enters my ear. Our fight with the wolf pack and its terrible leader is  finished. Steady, Dagaeoga! Steady! Make no excuses! The greatest of  warriors, the hero of a hundred battles, might well sink for a few  moments after such a combat!"    
Robert had collapsed suddenly. The great imagination driving forward his  will, and attuning him for such swift and tremendous action, failed, now  that the crisis had passed, and he dropped back against the ledge,  though his fingers still instinctively clutched the bow. Darkness was  before his eyes, and he was weak and trembling, but he projected his  will anew, and a little later sat upright, collected and firm.  Nevertheless, it was Tayoga who now took supreme command.    
"You have surely done enough for one night, Dagaeoga," he said.  "Tododaho himself, after doing so much, would have rested. Lie down now  on your blanket and I will watch for the remainder of the darkness. It  is true my left arm is lame and of no use for the present, but nothing  will come."    
"I'll do as you tell me, Tayoga," said Robert, "but first I give you  back your bow and arrows. They've served us well, though I little  thought I'd ever have to do work as a bowman."    
He was glad enough to stretch himself on the blanket and leaves, as he  realized that despite his will he had become weak. Presently he sank  into a deep slumber. When he awoke the sun was shining in the mouth of  the cave and Tayoga was offering him some of the tenderest of the moose  steak.    
"Eat, Dagaeoga," he said. "Though a warrior of the clan of the Bear, of  the nation Onondaga of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, I am proud  to serve the king of bowmen."    
"Cease your jesting at my expense, Tayoga."    
"It is not wholly a jest, but eat."    
"I will. Have you seen what is outside?"    
"Not yet. We will take our breakfast together, and then we will go forth  to see what we may see."    
They ate heartily, and then with rifles cocked passed into the defile,  where they found only the bones of wolves, picked clean by the others.  But the skeleton of the huge leader was gone, although the arrow that  had slain him was lying among the rocks.    
"The living must have dragged away his bones. A curious thing to do,"  said Robert.    
Tayoga was silent.
