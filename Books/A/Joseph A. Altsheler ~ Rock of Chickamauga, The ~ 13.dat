  Dick knew that he had saved young Woodville's life, but his  conscience was quite dear. If he had the same chance he would do it  over again, but he was sorry they had not caught Slade. He felt no  hostility toward the regular soldiers of the Confederacy, but he knew  there were guerillas on their side, as well as his own, who would stop  at nothing. He remembered Skelly, who, claiming to be a Union partisan,  nevertheless robbed and even killed those of either party whenever he  felt it safe to do so. Slade was his Southern complement, and he would  surely get together a new force as venomous as the old.
  But Colonel Winchester and the commander of the Ohio regiment were  full of pride in their exploit, as they had a right to be. They had  destroyed a swarm of wasps which had been buzzing and stinging almost  beyond endurance, and they were still prouder when they received the  thanks of General Thomas.
  The corps moved forward the next day, and soon the whole army was  united under Rosecrans. It was a powerful force, about ninety thousand  men, the staunch fighters of the West, veterans of great battles and  victories, and to the young officers it appeared invincible. Their  feeling that it was marching to another triumph was confirmed by the  news that Bragg was retreating.
  Yet the two armies were so close to each other that the Northern  vanguard skirmished with the Southern rearguard as they passed through  the mountains. At one point in a gap of the Cumberland Mountains the  Southerners made a sharp resistance, but they were quickly driven from  their position and the Union mass rolled slowly on. Exultation among  the troops increased.
  &#8220;We'll drive Bragg away down into the South against Grant,&#8221; said  Ohio to Dick, &#8220;and we'll crush him between the two arms of the vise.  That will finish everything in the West.&#8221;
  While Dick was exultant, too, he had certain reservations. He had  seen a like confidence carried to disaster in the East, although it did  not seem possible that the result here could be similar.
  &#8220;I don't think they'll keep on retreating forever, Ohio,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;All our supplies are coming from Nashville, and we are getting farther  away from our base every day.&#8221;
  But Ohio laughed.
  &#8220;Our chief task is to catch Bragg,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They said he was going  to occupy Chattanooga and wait for us. He's been in Chattanooga, but he  didn't wait for us there. He's left it already and gone on, anxious to  reach the Gulf before winter, I suppose.&#8221;
  The Union army in its turn entered Chattanooga, a little town of  which Dick had seldom heard before, although he greatly admired its  situation. The country about it was bold and romantic. It stood in a  sharp curve of the great river, the Tennessee. Not far away was the  lofty uplift of Lookout Mountain, a half-mile high, and there were long  ridges between which creeks or little rivers flowed down to the  Tennessee.
  One of these streams was the Chickamauga, which in the language of  the Cherokee Indians who had once owned this region means &#8220;the river of  death.&#8221; Why they called it so no one knew, but the name was soon to  have a terrible fitness. Chattanooga itself meant in the Cherokee  tongue &#8220;the hawk's nest,&#8221; and anybody could see the aptness of the  term.
  While Lookout Mountain was the loftiest summit, some of the other  ridges rose almost as high, through the gaps of which the Northern army  must pass if it continued the pursuit of Bragg.
  September had now come and the winds were growing crisper in the  high country. The feel of autumn was in the air, and the coolness made  the marching brisker. The division to which Dick belonged was advancing  slowly. He often saw Thomas, and his admiration for the grave, silent  man grew. It was said that Thomas was slow, but that he never made  mistakes. Now the rumor was spreading that he had warned Rosecrans to  be cautious, that Bragg had a powerful army and when he reached  favorable positions, would certainly turn and fight.
  Not many were impressed by these reports. They merely said it was  &#8220;Pap&#8221; Thomas' way of looking at the dark side of things first. Hadn't  they driven Bragg through the Cumberland Mountains and out of  Chattanooga, and now they would soon be on his heels deep down in  Georgia. But Dick, noticing Colonel Winchester's serious face, surmised  that he at least shared the opinion of his chief. And when the lad  looked up at the great coils and ridges he felt that, in truth, they  might go too far. If the Northern men were veterans, so were the  Southern, and neither had taken much change of the other at Shiloh,  Perryville and Stone River.
  The Winchester regiment was thrown forward as the vanguard of the  infantry, and the face of the colonel grew more serious than ever, when  the best scouts rode in with reports that the Southern retreat was now  very slow. There was news, too, that Slade had a new band much larger  than before, and they formed a rear guard of skirmishers which made  every moment of a Northern scout's life a moment of danger. The  Winchester regiment itself was often fired upon from ambush, and there  were vacant places in the ranks.
  Dick did not know whether it was his own intuition or the influence  that flowed from the opinions of Thomas and Winchester, but much of his  high exultation was abated. He regarded the lofty ridges and the deep  gaps with apprehension. It was a difficult country and the Southern  leaders must know that the Northern army was extended over a long line,  with Thomas holding the left.
  His premonitions had ample cause. Bragg as he fell back slowly had  gathered new forces. Rosecrans did not yet know it, but the army before  him was the most powerful that the South ever assembled in the West.  Polk and Cleburne and Breckinridge and Forrest and Fighting Joe Wheeler  and a whole long roll of famous Southern generals were there. Nor had  the vigilant eyes of the Confederacy in the East failed to note the  situation.
  Just as the armies were coming into touch a division of the Army of  Northern Virginia was passing by train over the mountains. It was led  by a thick-bearded, powerful man, no less a general than the renowned  Longstreet, sent to help Bragg. The veterans of the Army of Northern  Virginia would swell Bragg's ranks, and the great army, turning a  sanguine face northward, was eager for Rosecrans to come on. The  Southern force would number more than ninety thousand men, more  numerous than ever before or afterward in the West.
  It was now late in September, the eve of the eighteenth, and Dick  and his comrades lay near the little creek with the rhythmical name,  Chickamauga. It was the very night that a portion of the Army of  Northern Virginia had arrived in Bragg's camp. The preceding days had  been full of detached fighting, and the night had come heavy with omens  and presages. The least intelligent knew now that Bragg had stopped,  but they did not know that Longstreet was to be with him.
  Dick and his comrades sat by a smothered fire, and the vast tangle  of mountains and passes, of valleys and streams looked sinister to  them. There had been skirmishing throughout the day, and as the  darkness closed down they still heard occasional rifle shots on the  slopes and ridges.
  &#8220;Don't these mountains make you think of your native Vermont,  George?&#8221; asked Dick.
  &#8220;In a way, yes,&#8221; replied Warner, &#8220;but my hills are not bristling  with steel as these are.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, you New Englanders are fortunate. The war will never be carried  on on your soil. You shed your blood, but, after all, the states that  are trodden under foot by the armies suffer most.&#8221;
  &#8220;There are lights winking on the mountains again,&#8221; said Pennington.
  &#8220;Let 'em wink,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Their signals can't amount to much now.  We know that Bragg is before us, and a great battle can't be delayed  long. Fellows, I'm not so sure about the result.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come! Come, Dick!&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;It's not often you're downhearted.  What's struck you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing, George, but, between you and me and the gate post, I wish  that our old 'Pap' Thomas commanded all the army, instead of the left  merely. I've learned a few things to-day. The enemy is spreading out,  trying to enfold us on both wings.&#8221;
  &#8220;What of it?&#8221;
  &#8220;It means that they are sanguine of victory, and they want to stand  between us and Chattanooga, so they can cut off our retreat, after  we're beaten, as they think we surely will be. But their main force is  not far from us now, so a scout told me. It's massed heavily along the  right bank of the Chickamauga.&#8221;
  &#8220;And if there's a battle to-morrow we're likely to receive the first  attack?&#8221;
  &#8220;Could it come any better than at the place where Thomas stands?&#8221;
  They sat long by the fire and Dick could not rest. Shiloh, his  capture, and his knowledge of the secret Southern advance, of which he  could give no warning, came back to him with uncommon vividness. He  knew that no such surprise could occur here, but they seemed to be lost  in the wilderness. The mountains and forests oppressed him.
  &#8220;Well, Dick,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;we're posted strongly. We've rows of  sentinels as thick as hedges, and I've the colonel's permission to go  to sleep. I'll be slumbering in ten minutes, and I'd advise you to do  the same.&#8221;
  He lay on a blanket and soon slept. Pennington followed him to  slumberland, but Dick lingered. He saw lights still flashing on the  mountains, and he heard now and then reports from the rifles of the  skirmishers, who yet sought each other despite the darkness. But he  yielded at last and he, too, slept until the dawn, which should bring  nearly two hundred thousand men face to face in mortal combat.
  Dick was awake early. The September morning came, crisp and clear,  the sun showing red gleams over the mountains. He heard already the  sound of distant rifle shots in front, and, through his glasses, he saw  far away faint puffs of smoke. But it was a familiar sound in this  mighty war, and he found himself singularly calm. He never knew how he  was going to feel on the eve of battle. Sometimes the constriction at  his heart was painful, and sometimes its beat was smooth and regular.
  All the officers of the Winchester regiment were dismounted owing to  the rough nature of the country in which they were stationed. They held  the most uneven part of the center, where thickets and ravines were  many. Hot food and coffee were served to them, and new warmth and  courage flowed through their bodies.
  The distant fire increased, and, standing on a hillock, Dick looked  long through his glasses. A faint haze which had hung in the south was  clearing away. The rays of the sun were intensely bright. The brown of  autumn glowed like gold, and the red splashes here and there burned  scarlet. He saw pink dots appearing on a long line and he knew that the  skirmishers were active and wary.
  &#8220;There can be no doubt of the advance!&#8221; he said to Warner. &#8220;A strong  body of our cavalry disclosed their forward movement, and there are the  skirmishers signaling that Bragg is near. Wonderful fellows, those  sharpshooters! They're the eyes of the army. We stand in mass and fight  together, but every one of them individually takes his life in his own  hands. The firing is coming nearer. I think we'll be attacked first.&#8221;
  After a little pause Warner said:
  &#8220;I'm sorry our line is extended so much. What if they should cut  through and get behind us?&#8221;
  &#8220;They'll never do it while General Thomas is here. I believe they  called him 'Old Slow Top' at West Point, but if he's slow in advance  he's still slower in retreat. I'd rather have him commanding us just  now than any other general in the world.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think you're right, and here he comes! Listen to the cheering!&#8221;
  General Thomas rode slowly along his line, inspecting the position  of every regiment and making some changes. He showed no trace of  excitement. The face was calm and the heavy jaw was set firmly. If  Grant was a bulldog Thomas was another. The men knew him. They had seen  him stand like a rock before, and the thrill of confidence and courage  which help so much to win ran through them all.
  Dick saw the general speak to Colonel Winchester and then ride on  and out of sight. All the men in the regiment were lying down, but the  officers walked back and forth in front of the line. It was the  especial pride of the younger ones to appear unconcerned, and some were  able to make a brave pretense.
  But all the while the battle was rolling nearer. It was no longer an  affair of scouting parties. The skirmishers were driven in on either  side and the mighty Southern advance was coming forward in full battle  array. Shells began to shriek and fall among the Northern masses, and  the fire of cannon and rifles mingled in a sinister crash. But the  Union regiments, although not yet replying, remained steady, although  the shower of steel that was beginning to beat upon them found many a  mark. Vast columns of smoke pierced by fire rose in front.
  It seemed to Dick's vivid fancy that the earth was shaking with the  tread of the advancing brigades and the thunder of their artillery. But  he was still able to preserve his air of indifference, although his  heart was now beating hard and fast. Now and then when the smoke eddied  or the banks of it broke apart he raised his glasses and with their  powerful vision saw the long and deep Southern columns advancing, the  field batteries in the intervals pouring a storm of death.
  It was a sinister and terrible sight. The South presented here an  army outnumbering its force at Shiloh two to one, and they were  veterans now, led by veteran commanders. Moreover, they had Longstreet  and his matchless fighters from Lee's army to bear them up.
  &#8220;What do you see, Dick?&#8221; asked Pennington, his voice distinctly  audible through the steady roar.
  &#8220;Johnnies! Johnnies! Johnnies! Thousands and thousands of them and  then many thousands more. They're going to strike full upon us here!&#8221;
  &#8220;Let 'em come. We're taking root, growing deep into the ground and  old 'Pap' Thomas has grown deepest of us all! It'll be impossible to  move us!&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope so. There go our own cannon, too, and it's a welcome sound!  I can see the gaps smashed in their ranks by our fire, and ah, I see,  too&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped short in amazed surprise, and Pennington in wonder asked:
  &#8220;What is it you see, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;There's a heavy cavalry force on their flank, and I caught a  glimpse of a man on a great horse leading it. I know him. He's Colonel  George Kenton, father of Harry Kenton, that cousin of mine, of whom  I've spoken to you so often.&#8221;
  &#8220;And here he comes charging you! But it's happened hundreds and  hundreds of times in this war that relatives have come face to face in  battle, and it'll happen hundreds of times more. Are they within rifle  shot, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not yet, but they soon will be.&#8221;
  He slung the glasses back over his shoulder. The eye alone was  sufficient now to watch the charging columns. All the artillery on both  sides was coming into action, and the ripping crash of so many cannon  became so great that the officers could no longer hear one another  unless they shouted. The gorges and hills caught up the sound and gave  it back in increased volume.
  Dick heard a new note in the thunder. It was made by the swift beat  of hoofs, thousands of them, and the hair on his neck prickled at the  roots. Forrest and the wild cavalry of the South were charging on their  flanks. He felt a sudden horror lest he be trampled under the hoofs of  horses. By some curious twist of the mind his dread of such a fate was  far more acute at that moment than his fear of shells and bullets.
  Colonel Winchester, shouting imperiously, ordered him and all the  other young officers to step back now and lie down. Dick obeyed, and he  crouched by the side of Warner and Pennington. The great bank of fire  and smoke was rolling nearer and yet nearer, and the cannon were  fighting one another with all the speed and power of the gunners. Off  on the flank the ominous tread of Southern horsemen was coming fast.
  Bullets began now to rain among them. The regiment would have been  swept away bodily had the men not been lying down. But their time to  wait and hold their fire was at an end. The colonel gave the word, and  a sheet of light leaped from the mouths of their rifles. A vast gap  appeared in the Southern line before them, but in a minute or two it  closed up, and the Southern masses came on again, as menacing as ever.  Again Dick's regiment poured its shattering fire upon the Southern  columns and their front lines were blown away. Colonel Winchester at  once wheeled his men into a new position to meet the mass of Forrest's  cavalry rushing down upon their flank. He was just in time to help  other troops, not in numbers enough to withstand the shock.
  There were few moments in the lives of these lads as terrifying as  those when they turned to face the fierce Forrest, the uneducated  mountaineer who had intuitively mastered Napoleon's chief maxim of war,  to pour the greatest force upon the enemy's weakest point.
  The hurricane sweeping down upon them sent a chill to their hearts.  Dick saw a long line of foaming mouths, the lips drawn back from the  cruel white teeth, and manes flying wildly. Above them rose the faces  of the riders, their own eyes bloodshot, their sabers held aloft for  the deadly sweep. And the thunder of galloping hoofs was more menacing  than that of the cannon.
  Dick looked around him and saw faces turning pale. His own might be  whiter than any of theirs for all he knew, but he shouted with the  other officers:
  &#8220;Steady! Steady! Now pour it into 'em!&#8221;
  It was well that most of the men in the regiment had become  sharpshooters, and that despite the thumping of their hearts, they were  able to stand firm. Their sleet of bullets emptied a hundred saddles,  and slipping in the cartridges they fired again at close range. The  cavalry charge seemed to stop dead in its tracks, and in an instant a  scene of terrible confusion occurred. Wounded horses screaming in pain  rushed wildly back upon their own comrades or through the ranks of the  foe. Injured men, shot from their saddles, were seeking to crawl out of  the way. Whirling eddies of smoke alternately hid and disclosed  enemies, and from both left and right came the continuous and deafening  crash of infantry in battle.
  But Forrest's men paused only a moment or two. A great mass of them  galloped out of the smoke, over the bodies of their dead comrades and  directly into the Winchester regiment, shouting and slashing with their  great sabers. It was well for the men that their leader had so wisely  chosen ground rough and covered with bushes. Using every inch of  protection, they fired at horses and riders and thrust at them with  their bayonets.
  The battle became wild and confused, a turmoil of mingled horse and  foot, of firing and shouting and of glittering swords and bayonets. A  man on a huge horse made a great sweep at Dick's head with a red saber.  The boy dropped to his knees, and felt the broad blade whistle where  his head had been.
  The swordsman was borne on by the impetus of his horse, and Dick  caught one horrified glimpse of his face. It was Colonel Kenton, but  Dick knew that he did not know, nor did he ever know. It was never in  the lad's heart to tell his uncle how near he had come unwittingly to  shearing off the head of his own nephew.
  The charge of the cavalrymen carried them clear through the  Winchester regiment, but a regiment coming up to the relief drove them  back, and the great mass turning aside a little attacked anew and  elsewhere. A few moments of rest were permitted Dick and his comrades,  although the mighty battle wheeled and thundered all about them.
  But their regiment was a melancholy sight. A third of its numbers  were killed or wounded. The ground was torn and trampled, as if it had  been swept by a hurricane of wind and red rain. Dick had one slight  wound on his shoulder and another on his arm, but he did not feel them.  Pennington and Warner both had scratches, but the colonel was unharmed.
  &#8220;My God,&#8221; exclaimed Warner, &#8220;how did we happen to survive it!&#8221;
  &#8220;I live to boast that I've been ridden over by old Forrest himself,&#8221;  said Pennington.
  &#8220;How do you know it was Forrest?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because his horse was eight feet high and his sword was ten feet  long. He slashed at me with it a hundred times. I counted the strokes.&#8221;
  Then Pennington stopped and laughed hysterically, Dick seized him by  the arm and shook him roughly.
  &#8220;Stop it, Frank! Stop it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You're yourself, and you're  all right!&#8221;
  Pennington shook his body, brushed his hands over his eyes and said:
  &#8220;Thanks, Dick, old man; you've brought me back to myself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Get ready!&#8221; exclaimed Warner. &#8220;The cavalry have sheered off, but  the infantry are coming, a million strong! I can hear their tread  shaking the earth!&#8221;
  The broken regiment reloaded, drew its lines together and faced the  enemy anew. It seemed to their bloodshot eyes that the whole Southern  army was bearing down upon them. The Southern generals, skillful and  daring, were resolved to break through the Northern left, and the  attack attained all the violence of a convulsion.
  The great Southern line, blazing with fire and steel, advanced,  never stopping for a moment, while the fire of their cannon beat  incessantly upon the devoted brigades. It was well for the Northern  army, well for the Union that here was the Rock of Chickamauga. Amid  all the terrible uproar and the yet more terrible danger, Thomas never  lost his courage and presence of mind for a moment. Dick saw him more  than once, and he knew how he doubly and triply earned the famous name  which that day and the next were to give him.
  But the weight was so tremendous that they began to give ground.  They went back slowly, but they went back. Dick felt as if the whole  weight were pressing upon his own chest, and when he tried to shout no  words would come.
  Back they went, inch by inch, leaving the ground covered with their  dead. Dick was conscious only of a vast roar and shouting and the  continuous blaze of cannon and rifles in his very face. But he  understood the immensity of the crisis. By a huge victory in the West  the Confederacy would redress the loss of Gettysburg in the East. And  now it seemed that they were gaining it. For the first and only time in  the war they had the larger numbers in a great battle, and the ground  was of their own choosing.
  Elated over success gained and greater success hoped, the Southern  leaders poured their troops continually upon Thomas. If they could  break that wing, cut it off in fact, and rush in at the gap, they would  be between Rosecrans and Chattanooga and the Northern army would be  doomed. They made gigantic efforts. The cavalry charged again and  again. Huge masses of infantry hurled themselves upon the brigades of  Thomas, and every gun that could be brought into action poured shot and  shell into his lines.
  Many of the young as well as the old officers in Thomas' corps felt  the terrible nature of the crisis. Dick knew despite the hideous  turmoil that Thomas was the chief target of the Southern army. He  divined that the fortunes of the Union were swinging in the balance  there among those Tennessee hills and valleys. If Thomas were shattered  the turn of Grant farther south would come next. Vicksburg would have  been won in vain and the Union would be broken in the West.
  Order and cohesion were lost among many of the regiments, but the  men stood firm. The superb, democratic soldier fought for himself and  he, too, understood the crisis. They re-formed without orders and  fought continuously against overwhelming might. Ground and guns were  lost, but they made their enemy pay high for everything, and the slow  retreat never became a panic.
  &#8220;We're going back,&#8221; shouted Warner in Dick's ear. &#8220;Yes, we're going  back, but we'll come forward again. They'll never crush the old man.&#8221;
  Yet the pressure upon them never ceased. Bragg and his staff had the  right idea. Had anyone but Thomas stood before them they would have  shattered the Union left long since, but his slow, calm mind rose to  its greatest heights in the greatest danger. He understood everything  and he was resolved that his wing should not be broken. Wherever the  line seemed weakest he thrust in a veteran regiment, and he went  quickly back and forth, observing with a measuring eye every shift and  change of the battle.
  The Winchester regiment in its new position was still among the  gullies and bushes, and they were thankful for such shelter. Although  veterans now, most were lads, and they did not scorn to take cover  whenever they could. For a little while they did not reply to the  enemy's fire, but lay waiting and seeking to get back the breath which  seemed to be driven from their bodies by the very violence of the  concussion. Shrapnel, grape and canister whistled incessantly over  their heads, and on either flank the thunder of the battle swelled  rapidly.
  The Southern attack was spreading along the whole front, and it was  made with unexampled vigor. It even excelled the fiery rush at Stone  River, and the generals on both sides were largely the same that had  fought the earlier great battle. Polk, the bishop-general, still led  one wing for the South, Buckner massed Kentuckians who faced  Kentuckians on the other side, and Longstreet and Hill were to play  their great part for the South. Resolved to win a victory, the veteran  generals spared nothing, and the little Chickamauga, so singularly  named by the Indians &#8220;the river of death,&#8221; was running red.
  Dick crouched lower as the storm of shells swept over him. Despite  all his experience impulse made him bow his head while the whistling  death passed by. He felt a little shame that he, an officer, should  seek protection, but when he stole a look he saw that all the others,  Colonel Winchester included, were doing the same. Sergeant Whitley had  sunk down the lowest of them all, and, catching Dick's glance, he said  in clear, low tones audible under the storm:
  &#8220;Pardon me for saying it to you, an officer, Mr. Mason, but it's our  business not to get killed when it's not needed, so we can save  ourselves to be killed when it is needed.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose you're right, Sergeant. At any rate I'm glad enough to  keep under cover, but do you see anything in those woods over there?  We're on the extreme left flank here, and maybe they're trying to  overlap us.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I do. Men with rifles are in there. I'll speak to the  colonel.&#8221;
  He crawled to Colonel Winchester, who was crouched a dozen feet  away, and pointed to the wood, or rather thicket of scrub. But Dick  meanwhile saw increasing numbers of men there. They were beyond the  line of battle and were not obscured by the clouds of smoke. As he  stared he saw a weazened figure under an enormous, broad-brimmed hat,  and, although he could not discern the face at the distance, he knew  that it was Slade, come with a new and perhaps larger body of riflemen  to burn away the extreme left flank of the Union force.
  As the colonel and the sergeant crawled back Dick told them what he  had seen, and they recognized at once the imminence of the danger.  Colonel Winchester looked at the great columns of fire and smoke in  front of him. He did not know when the main attack would sweep down  upon them again, but he took his resolution at once.
  He ordered his men to wheel about, and, using Slade's own tactics,  to creep forward with their rifles. Most of his men were sharpshooters  and he felt that they would be a match for those whom the guerrilla  led. Sergeant Whitley kept by his side, and out of a vast experience in  border warfare advised him.
  Dick, Warner and Pennington armed themselves with rifles of the  fallen, and they felt fierce thrills of joy as they crept forward.  Burning with the battle fever, and enraged against this man Slade, Dick  put all his soul in the man-hunt. He merely hoped that Victor Woodville  was not there. He would fire willingly at any of the rest.
  Before they had gone far Slade and his riflemen began to fire.  Bullets pattered all about them, clipping twigs and leaves and striking  sparks from stones.
  Had the fire been unexpected it would have done deadly damage, but  all of the Winchesters, as they liked to call themselves, had kept  under cover, and were advancing Indian fashion. And now a consuming  rage seized them all. They felt as if an advantage had been taken of  them. While they were fighting a great battle in front a sly foe sought  to ambush them. They did not hate the Southern army which charged  directly upon them, but they did hate this band of sharpshooters which  had come creeping through the woods to pick them off, and they hated  them collectively and individually.
  It was Dick's single and fierce desire at that moment to catch sight  of Slade, whom he would shoot without hesitation if the chance came. He  looked for him continually as he crept from bush to bush, and he  withheld his fire until fortune might bring into his view the flaps of  that enormous hat. The whole vast battle of Chickamauga passed from his  mind. He was concentrated, heart and soul, upon this affair of outposts  in the thickets.
  Men around him were firing, and the bullets in return were knocking  up the leaves about him, but Dick's finger did not yet press the  trigger. The great hat was still hidden from view, but he heard Slade's  whistle calling to his men. Sergeant Whitley was by the lad's side, and  he glanced at him now and then. The wise sergeant read the youth's  face, and he knew that he was upon a quest, a deadly one.
  &#8220;Is it Slade you're looking for, Mr. Mason?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Yes, I want him!&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, if we see him, and you miss him, I think I'll take a shot at  him myself.&#8221;
  But Slade, crafty and cunning, kept himself well hidden. The two  bands fighting this Indian combat, while the great battle raged so near  them, were now very near to each other, but as they had both thickets  and a rocky outcrop for refuge, they fought from hiding. Nevertheless  many fell. Dick, the ferocity of the man-hunt continuing to burn his  brain, sought everywhere for Slade. Often he heard his silver whistle  directing his troop, but the man himself remained invisible. In his  eagerness the lad rose too high, but the sergeant pulled him down in  time, a bullet whistling a second later through the air where his head  had been.
  &#8220;Careful, Mr. Mason! Careful!&#8221; said Sergeant Whitley. &#8220;It won't do  you much good for one of his men to get you while you are trying to get  him!&#8221;
  Dick became more cautious. At last he caught a glimpse of the great  hat that he could not mistake, and, aiming very carefully, he fired.  Then he uttered an angry cry. He had missed, and when the sergeant was  ready to pull the trigger also Slade was gone.
  Now, the colonel called to his men, and rising they charged into the  wood. It was evidently no part of Slade's plan to risk destruction as  he blew a long high call on his whistle, and then he and all his men  save the dead melted away like shadows. The Winchesters stood among the  trees, gasping and staunching their wounds, but victorious.
  Now they had only a few moments for rest. Bugles called and they  rushed back to their old position just as the Southern cavalry, sabers  circling aloft swept down upon them again. They went once more through  that terrible turmoil of fire and flashing steel, and a second time the  Winchesters were victorious. But they could have stood no more, and  Thomas watching everything hurried to their relief a regiment, which  formed up before them to give them breathing time.
  The young soldiers threw themselves panting upon the ground, and  were assailed by a burning thirst. The canteens were soon emptied, and  still their lips and throats were parched. Exhausted by their  tremendous exertions, many of them sank into a stupor, although the  battle was at its zenith and the earth shook with the crash of the  heavy batteries.
  &#8220;General Thomas has had news that we're driven in elsewhere,&#8221; said  Dick.
  &#8220;And we've yielded ground here, too,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;But so slowly that it's been only a glacial movement. We've made  'em pay such a high price that I think old 'Pap' can boast he has held  his ground.&#8221;
  Dick did not know it then nor did the general himself, but 'Pap'  Thomas could boast of far more than having held his ground. His long  and stubborn resistance, his skill in moving his troops from point to  point at the right time, his coolness and judgment in weighing and  measuring everything right, in all the vast turmoil, confusion and  uncertainty of a great battle, had saved the Northern army from  destruction.
  Now, as the Winchester men lay gasping behind the fresh regiment,  Thomas, who continually passed along the line of battle, came among  them. He was a soldier's soldier, a soldier's general, and he spoke  encouraging words, most of which they could not hear amid the roar of  the battle, but his calm face told their import, and fresh courage came  into their hearts.
  The news spread gradually that Thomas only was holding fast, but now  his men instead of being discouraged were filled with pride. It was  they and they alone whom the Southerners could not overwhelm, and  Thomas and his generals inspired them with the belief that they were  invincible. Charge after charge broke against them. More ground was  yielded, but at the same immense price, and the corps, sullen,  indomitable, maintained its order, always presenting a front to the  foe, blazing with death.
  Thomas stood all day, while the Southern masses, flushed by victory  everywhere else, pressed harder. Terrible reports of defeat and  destruction came to him continually, but he did not flinch. He turned  the same calm face to everything, and said to the generals that  whatever happened they would keep their own front unbroken.
  The day closed with the men of Thomas still grim and defiant. The  dead lay in heaps along their front, but as the darkness settled down  on the unfinished battle they meant to fight with equal valor and  tenacity on the morrow. The first day had favored the South, had  favored it largely, but on the Union left hope still flamed high.
  Darkness swept over the sanguinary field. A cold wind of autumn blew  off the hills and mountains, and the men shivered as they lay on the  ground, but Thomas allowed no fires to be lighted. Food was brought in  the darkness, and those who could find them wrapped themselves in  blankets. Between the two armies lay the hecatombs of dead and the  thousands of wounded.
  Dick, his comrades and the rest of the regiment sat together in a  little open space behind a thicket. It was to be their position for the  fighting next day. Thomas, passing by, had merely given them an  approving look, and then had gone on to re-form his lines elsewhere.  Dick knew that all through the night he would be conferring with his  commander, Rosecrans, McCook and the others, and he knew, too, that  many of the Union soldiers would be at work, fortifying, throwing up  earthworks, and cutting down trees for abattis. He heard already the  ring of the axes.
  But the Winchester men rested for the present. Nature had made their  own position strong with a low hill, and a thicket in front. They lay  upon the ground, sheltering themselves from the cold wind, which cut  through bodies relaxed and almost bloodless after such vast physical  exertions and excitement so tremendous.
