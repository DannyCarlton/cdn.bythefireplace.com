I vex me not with brooding on the years<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That were ere I drew breath: why should I then<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Distrust the darkness that may fall again<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When life is done? Perchance in other spheres--<br> Dead planets--I once tasted mortal tears,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And walked as now among a throng of men,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pondering things that lay beyond my ken,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Questioning death, and solacing my fears.<br> Ofttimes indeed strange sense have I of this,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vague memories that hold me with a spell,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Touches of unseen lips upon my brow,<br> Breathing some incommunicable bliss!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In years foregone, O Soul, was all not well?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still lovelier life awaits thee. Fear not thou!
