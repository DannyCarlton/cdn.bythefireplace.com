  The day following the fight in the forest, Dixon found Jean de  Gravois  alone, and came up to him. 
  &quot;Gravois, will you shake hands with me?&quot; he said. &quot;I want to thank  you  for what you did to me yesterday. I deserved it. I have asked Miss   M&eacute;lisse to forgive me&#8212;and I want to shake hands with you.&quot; 
  Jean was thunderstruck. He had never met this kind of man. 
  &quot;Que diantre!&quot; he ejaculated, when he had come to his senses. &quot;Yes,  I  will shake hands!&quot; 
  For several days after this Jean could see that M&eacute;lisse made an  effort  to evade him. She did not visit Iowaka when he was in the  cabin.  Neither did she and Dixon go again into the forest. The young   Englishman spent more of his time at the store; and just before the   trappers began coming in, he went on a three-days' sledge-trip with   Croisset. 
  The change delighted Jean. The first time he met M&eacute;lisse after the   fight, his eyes flashed pleasure. 
  &quot;Jan will surely be coming home soon,&quot; he greeted her. &quot;What if the   birds tell him what happened out there on the trail?&quot; 
  She flushed scarlet. 
  &quot;Perhaps the same birds will tell us what has happened down on the   Nelson House trail, Jean,&quot; she retorted. 
  &quot;Pouf! Jan Thoreau doesn't give the snap of his small finger for  the  MacVeigh girl!&quot; Jean replied, warm in defense of his friend. 
  &quot;She is pretty,&quot; laughed M&eacute;lisse, &quot;and I have just learned that is  why  men like to&#8212;like them, I mean.&quot; 
  Jean strutted before her like a peacock. 
  &quot;Am I pretty, M&eacute;lisse?&quot; 
  &quot;No-o-o-o.&quot; 
  &quot;Then why&quot;&#8212;he shrugged his shoulders suggestively&#8212;&quot;in the  cabin&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Because you were brave, Jean. I love brave men!&quot; 
  &quot;You were glad that I pummeled the stranger, then?&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse did not answer, but he caught a laughing sparkle in the  corner  of her eye as she left him. 
  &quot;Come home, Jan Thoreau,&quot; he hummed softly, as he went to the  store.  &quot;Come home, come home, come home, for the little M&eacute;lisse has  grown  into a woman, and is learning to use her eyes!&quot; 
  Among the first of the trappers to come in with his furs was  MacVeigh.  He brought word that Jan had gone south, to spend the annual  holiday  at Nelson House, and Cummings told M&eacute;lisse whence the message  came. He  did not observe the slight change that came into her face,  and went  on: 
  &quot;I don't understand this in Jan. He is needed here for the  carnival.  Did you know that he was going to Nelson House?&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse shook her head. 
  &quot;MacVeigh says they have made him an offer to go down there as  chief  man,&quot; continued the factor. &quot;It is strange that he has sent no   explanation to me!&quot; 
  It was a week after the big caribou roast before Jan returned to  Lac  Bain. M&eacute;lisse saw him drive in from the Churchill trail; but while  her  heart fluttered excitedly, she steeled herself to meet him with at   least an equal show of the calm indifference with which he had left   her six weeks before. The coolness of his leave-taking still rankled   bitterly in her bosom. He had not kissed her; he had not even passed   his last evening with her. 
  But she was not prepared for the changed Jan Thoreau who came  slowly  through the cabin door. His hair and beard had grown, covering  the  smooth cheeks which he had always kept closely shaven. His eyes  glowed  with dull pleasure as she stood waiting for him, but there was  none of  the old flash and fire in them. There was a strangeness in his  manner,  an uneasiness in the shifting of his eyes, which caused the  half-  defiant flush to fade slowly from her cheeks before either had  spoken.  She had never known this Jan before, and her fortitude left  her as she  approached him, wonderingly, silent, her hands reaching out  to him. 
  &quot;Jan!&quot; she said. 
  Her voice trembled; her lips quivered. There was the old glorious   pleading in her eyes, and before it Jan bowed his unkempt head, and   crushed her hands tightly in his own. For a half-minute there was   silence, and in that half-minute there came a century between them. At   last Jan spoke. 
  &quot;I'm glad to see you again, M&eacute;lisse. It has seemed like a very long   time!&quot; 
  He lifted his eyes. Before them the girl involuntarily shrank back,   and Jan freed her hands. In them she saw none of the old love-glow,   nothing of their old comradeship. Inscrutable, reflecting no visible   emotion, they passed from her to the violin hanging on the wall. 
  &quot;I have not played in so long,&quot; he said, turning from her, &quot;that I   believe I have forgotten.&quot; 
  He took down the instrument, and his fingers traveled clumsily over   the strings. His teeth gleamed at her from out his half-inch growth of   beard, as he said: 
  &quot;Ah, you must play for me now, M&eacute;lisse! It has surely gone from Jan   Thoreau.&quot; 
  He held out the violin to her. 
  &quot;Not now, Jan,&quot; she said tremulously. &quot;I will play for you  to-night.&quot;  She went to the door of her room, hesitating for a moment,  with her  back to him. &quot;You will come to supper, Jan?&quot; 
  &quot;Surely, M&eacute;lisse, if you are prepared.&quot; 
  He hung up the violin as she closed the door, and went from the  cabin.  Jean de Gravois and Iowaka were watching for him, and Jean  hurried  across the open to meet him. 
  &quot;I am coming to offer you the loan of my razor,&quot; he cried gaily.   &quot;Iowaka says that you will be taken for a bear if the trappers see   you.&quot; 
  &quot;A beard is good to keep off the black flies,&quot; replied Jan. &quot;It is   approaching summer, and the black flies love to feast upon me. Let us   go down the trail, Jean. I want to speak with you.&quot; 
  Where there had been wood-cutting in the deep spruce they sat down,   facing each other. Jan spoke in French. 
  &quot;I have traveled far since leaving Lac Bain,&quot; he said. &quot;I went  first  to Nelson House, and from here to the Wholdaia. I found them at  Nelson  House, but not on the Wholdaia.&quot; 
  &quot;What?&quot; asked Jean, though he knew well what the other meant. 
  &quot;My brothers, Jean de Gravois,&quot; answered Jan, drawing his lips  until  his teeth gleamed in a sneering smile. &quot;My brothers, les b&ecirc;tes  de  charogne!&quot; 
  &quot;Devil take Croisset for telling you where they were!&quot; muttered  Jean  under his breath. 
  &quot;I saw the two at Nelson House,&quot; continued Jan. &quot;One of them is a   half-wit, and the other&quot;&#8212;he hunched his shoulders&#8212;&quot;is worse.   Petraud, one of the two who were at Wholdaia, was killed by a Cree   father last winter for dishonoring his daughter. The other   disappeared.&quot; 
  Jean was silent, his head leaning forward, his face resting in his   hands. 
  &quot;So you see, Jean de Gravois, what sort of creature is your friend  Jan  Thoreau!&quot; 
  Jean raised his head until his eyes were on a level with those of  his  companion. 
  &quot;I see that you are a bigger fool than ever,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Jan   Thoreau, what if I should break my oath&#8212;and tell M&eacute;lisse?&quot; 
  Unflinching the men's eyes met. A dull glare came into Jan's.  Slowly  he unsheathed his long knife, and placed it upon the snow  between his  feet, with the gleaming end of the blade pointing toward  Gravois. With  a low cry Jean sprang to his feet. 
  &quot;Do you mean that, Jan Thoreau? Do you mean to give the knife-   challenge to one who has staked his life for you and who loves you as   a brother?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Jan deliberately. &quot;I love you, Jean more than any other   man in the world; and yet I will kill you if you betray me to   M&eacute;lisse!&quot; He rose to his feet and stretched out his hands to the   little Frenchman. &quot;Jean, wouldn't you do as I am doing? Wouldn't you   have done as much for Iowaka?&quot; 
  For a moment Gravois was silent. 
  &quot;I would not have taken her love without telling her,&quot; he said  then.  &quot;That is not what you and I know as honor, Jan Thoreau. But I  would  have gone to her, as you should now go to M&eacute;lisse, and she would  have  opened her arms to me, as M&eacute;lisse would opens hers to you. That  is  what I would have done.&quot; 
  &quot;And that is what I shall never do,&quot; said Jan decisively, turning   toward the post. &quot;I could kill myself more easily. That is what I   wanted to tell you, Jean. No one but you and I must ever know!&quot; 
  &quot;I would like to choke that fool of a Croisset for sending you to  hunt  up those people at Nelson House and Wholdaia!&quot; grumbled Jean. 
  &quot;It was best for me.&quot; 
  They saw M&eacute;lisse leaving Iowaka's home when they came from the  forest.  Both waved their hands to her, and Jan cut across the open to  the  store. 
  Jean went to the Cummins cabin as soon as he was sure that he was  not  observed. There was little of the old vivacity in his manner as he   greeted M&eacute;lisse. He noted, too, that the girl was not her natural   self. There was a redness under her eyes which told him that she had   been crying. 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he said at last, speaking to her with his eyes fixed on  the  cap he was twisting in his fingers, &quot;there has come a great change   over Jan.&quot; 
  &quot;A very great change, Jean. If I were to guess, I should say that  his  heart has been broken down on the Nelson trail.&quot; 
  Gravois caught the sharp meaning in her voice, which trembled a  little  as she spoke. He was before her in an instant, his cap fallen  to the  floor, his eyes blazing as he caught her by the arms. 
  &quot;Yes, the heart of Jan Thoreau is broken!&quot; he cried. &quot;But it has  been  broken by nothing that lives on the Nelson House trail. It is  broken  because of&#8212;YOU!&quot; 
  &quot;I!&quot; M&eacute;lisse drew back from him with a breathless cry. &quot;I&#8212;I have   broken&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I did not say that,&quot; interrupted Jean. &quot;I say that it is broken   because of you. Mon Dieu, if only I might tell you!&quot; 
  &quot;Do-DO, Jean! Please tell me!&quot; She put her hands on his shoulders.  Her  eyes implored him. &quot;Tell me what I have done&#8212;what I can do,  Jean!&quot; 
  &quot;I can say that much to you, and no more,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Only  know  this, ma ch&egrave;re&#8212;that there is a great grief eating at the soul of  Jan  Thoreau, and that because of this grief he is changed. I know what   this grief is, but I am pledged never to reveal it. It is for you to   find out, and to do this, above all else&#8212;let him know that you love   him!&quot; 
  The color had faded from her startled face, but now it came back  again  in a swift flood. 
  &quot;That I love him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. Not as a sister any longer, M&eacute;lisse, but as a WOMAN!&quot;
