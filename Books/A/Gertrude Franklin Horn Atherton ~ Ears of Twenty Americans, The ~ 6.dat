After the entertainment was over, Russell strolled about the town. The  new moon was on the sky, the stars thick and bright; but dark corners  were everywhere, and he kept his hand on his pistol. He found himself  before the long low house of Dona Eustaquia Ortega. Not a light  glimmered; the shutters were of solid wood. He walked up and down,  trying to guess which was Benicia's room.    
"I am growing as romantic as a Californian," he thought; "but this  wonderful country pours its colour all through one's nature. If I  could find her window, I believe I should serenade her in true Spanish  fashion. By Jove, I remember now, she said something about looking  through her window at the pines on the hill. It must be at the back of  the house, and how am I going to get over that great adobe wall? That  gate is probably fastened with an iron bar--ah!"    
He had walked to the corner of the wall surrounding the large yard  behind and at both sides of Dona Eustaquia's house, and he saw,  ascending a ladder, a tall figure, draped in a serape, its face  concealed by the shadow of a sombrero. He drew his pistol, then laughed  at himself, although not without annoyance. "A rival; and he has got  ahead of me. He is going to serenade her."    
The caballero seated himself uncomfortably on the tiles that roofed the  wall, removed his sombrero, and Russell recognized Fernando Altimira. A  moment later the sweet thin chords of the guitar quivered in the quiet  air, and a tenor, so fine that even Russell stood entranced, sang to  Benicia one of the old songs of Monterey:--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>EL SUSPIRO <br> <br> Una mirada un suspiro, <br> Una lagrima querida, <br> Es balsamo a la herida <br> Que abriste en mi corazon. <br> <br> Por esa lagrima cara <br> Objeto de mi termina, <br> Yo te ame bella criatura <br> Desde que te vi llorar. <br> <br> Te acuerdas de aquella noche <br> En que triste y abatida <br> Una lagrima querida <br> Vi de tus ojos brotar.</small></i></blockquote><br>
Although Russell was at the base of the high wall he saw that a light  flashed. The light was followed by the clapping of little hands. "Jove!"  he thought, "am I really jealous? But damn that Californian!"    
Altimira sang two more songs and was rewarded by the same  demonstrations. As he descended the ladder and reached the open street  he met Russell face to face. The two men regarded each other for a  moment. The Californian's handsome face was distorted by a passionate  scowl; Russell was calmer, but his brows were lowered.    
Altimira flung the ladder to the ground, but fire-blooded as he was, the  politeness of his race did not desert him, and his struggle with English  flung oil upon his passion.    
"Senor," he said, "I no know what you do it by the house of the Senorita  Benicia so late in the night. I suppose you have the right to walk in  the town si it please yourself."    
"Have I not the same right as you--to serenade the Senorita Benicia? If  I had known her room, I should have been on the wall before you."    
Altimira's face flushed with triumph. "I think the Senorita Benicia  no care for the English song, senor. She love the sweet words of her  country: she no care for words of ice."    
Russell smiled. "Our language may not be as elastic as yours, Don  Fernando, but it is a good deal more sincere. And it can express as much  and perhaps--"    
"You love Benicia?" interrupted Altimira, fiercely.    
"I admire the Senorita Ortega tremendously. But I have seen her twice  only, and although we may love longer, we take more time to get there,  perhaps, than you do."    
"Ay! Dios de mi vida! You have the heart of rock! You chip it off in  little pieces, one to-day, another to-morrow, and give to the woman. I,  senor, I love Benicia, and I marry her. You understand? Si you take her,  I cut the heart from your body. You understand?"    
"I understand. We understand each other." Russell lifted his cap. The  Californian took his sombrero from his head and made a long sweeping  bow; and the two men parted.
