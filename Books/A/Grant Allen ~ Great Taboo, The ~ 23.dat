They looked at one another again with a wild surmise. The voice was as  the voice of some long past age. Could the parrot be speaking to them in  the words of seventeenth-century English?    
Even M. Peyron, who at first had received the strange discovery with  incredulity, woke up before long to the importance of this sudden and  unexpected revelation. The Tu-Kila-Kila who had taught Methuselah that  long poem or sermon, which native tradition regarded as containing the  central secret of their creed or its mysteries, and which the cruel and  cunning Tu-Kila-Kila of to-day believed to be of immense importance to  his safety--that Tu-Kila-Kila of other days was, in all probability, no  other than an English sailor. Cast on these shores, perhaps, as they  themselves had been, by the mercy of the waves, he had managed to master  the language and religion of the savages among whom he found himself  thrown; he had risen to be the representative of the cannibal god; and,  during long months or years of tedious exile, he had beguiled his leisure  by imparting to the unconscious ears of a bird the weird secret of his  success, for the benefit of any others of his own race who might be  similarly treated by fortune in future. Strange and romantic as it all  sounded, they could hardly doubt now that this was the real explanation  of the bird's command of English words. One problem alone remained to  disturb their souls. Was the bird really in possession of any local  secret and mystery at all, or was this the whole burden of the message he  had brought down across the vast abyss of time--"God save the king, and  to hell with all papists?"    
Felix turned to M. Peyron in a perfect tumult of suspense. "What he  recites is long?" he said, interrogatively, with profound interest. "You  have heard him say much more than this at times? The words he has just  uttered are not those of the sermon or poem you mentioned?"    
M. Peyron opened his hands expansively before him. "Oh, <i>mon Dieu</i>, no,  monsieur," he answered, with effusion. "You should hear him recite it.  He's never done. It is whole chapters--whole chapters; a perfect Henriade  in parrot-talk. When once he begins, there's no possibility of checking  or stopping him. On, on he goes. Farewell to the rest; he insists on  pouring it all forth to the very last sentence. Gabble, gabble, gabble;  chatter, chatter, chatter; pouf, pouf, pouf; boum, boum, boum; he runs  ahead eternally in one long discordant sing-song monotone. The person who  taught him must have taken entire months to teach him, a phrase at a  time, paragraph by paragraph. It is wonderful a bird's memory could hold  so much. But till now, taking it for granted he spoke only some wild  South Pacific dialect, I never paid much attention to Methuselah's  vagaries."    
"Hush. He's going to speak," Muriel cried, holding up, in alarm, one  warning finger.    
And the bird, his tongue-strings evidently loosened by the strange  recurrence after so many years of those familiar English sounds, "Pretty  Poll! Pretty Poll!" opened his mouth again in a loud chuckle of delight,  and cried, with persistent shrillness, "God save the king! A fig for  all arrant knaves and roundheads!"    
A creepier feeling than ever came over the two English listeners at those  astounding words. "Great heavens!" Felix exclaimed to the unsuspecting  Frenchman, "he speaks in the style of the Stuarts and the Commonwealth!"    
The Frenchman started. "<i>Epoque Louis Quatorze</i>!" he murmured,  translating the date mentally into his own more familiar chronology. "Two  centuries since! Oh, incredible! incredible! Methuselah is old, but not  quite so much of a patriarch as that. Even Humboldt's parrot could hardly  have lived for two hundred years in the wilds of South America."    
Felix regarded the venerable creature with a look of almost superstitious  awe. "Facts are facts," he answered shortly, shutting his mouth with a  little snap. "Unless this bird has been deliberately taught historical  details in an archaic diction--and a shipwrecked sailor is hardly likely  to be antiquarian enough to conceive such an idea--he is undoubtedly a  survival from the days of the Commonwealth or the Restoration. And you  say he runs on with his tale for an hour at a time! Good heavens, what  a thought! I wish we could manage to start him now. Does he begin it  often?"    
"Monsieur," the Frenchman answered, "when I came here first, though  Methuselah was already very old and feeble, he was not quite a dotard,  and he used to recite it all every morning regularly. That was the hour,  I suppose, at which the master, who first taught him this lengthy  recitation, used originally to impress it upon him. In those days his  sight and his memory were far more clear than now. But by degrees, since  my arrival, he has grown dull and stupid. The natives tell me that fifty  years ago, while he was already old, he was still bright and lively, and  would recite the whole poem whenever anybody presented him with his  greatest dainty, the claw of a moora-crab. Nowadays, however, when he can  hardly eat, and hardly mumble, he is much less persistent and less  coherent than formerly. To say the truth, I have discouraged him in his  efforts, because his pertinacity annoyed me. So now he seldom gets  through all his lesson at one bout, as he used to do at the beginning.  The best way to get him on is for me to sing him one of my French songs.  That seems to excite him, or to rouse him to rivalry. Then he will put  his head on one side, listen critically for a while, smile a superior  smile, and finally begin--jabber, jabber, jabber--trying to talk me down,  as if I were a brother parrot."    
"Oh, do sing now!" Muriel cried, with intense persuasion in her voice.  "I do so want to hear it." She meant, of course, the parrot's story.    
But the Frenchman bowed, and laid his hand on his heart. "Ah,  mademoiselle," he said, "your wish is almost a royal command. And yet, do  you know, it is so long since I have sung, except to please myself--my  music is so rusty, old pieces you have heard--I have no accompaniment,  no score--<i>mais enfin</i>, we are all so far from Paris!"    
Muriel didn't dare to undeceive him as to her meaning, lest he should  refuse to sing in real earnest, and the chance of learning the parrot's  secret might slip by them irretrievably. "Oh, monsieur," she cried,  fitting herself to his humor at once, and speaking as ceremoniously as if  she were assisting at a musical party in the Avenue Victor Hugo, "don't  decline, I beg of you, on those accounts. We are both most anxious to  hear your song. Don't disappoint us, pray. Please begin immediately."    
"Ah, mademoiselle," the Frenchman said, "who could resist such an appeal?  You are altogether too flattering." And then, in the same cheery voice  that Felix had heard on the first day he visited the King of Birds' hut,  M. Peyron began, in very decent style, to pour forth the merry sounds of  his rollicking song:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"Quand on conspi-re, <br> Quand sans frayeur <br> On peut se di-re <br> Conspirateur-- <br> Pour tout le mon-de <br> Il faut avoir <br> Perruque blon-de <br> Et collet noir."</small></i></blockquote><br>
He had hardly got as far as the end of the first stanza, however, when  Methuselah, listening, with his ear cocked up most knowingly, to the  Frenchman's song, raised his head in opposition, and, sitting bolt  upright on his perch, began to scream forth a voluble stream of words in  one unbroken flood, so fast that Muriel could hardly follow them. The  bird spoke in a thick and very harsh voice, and, what was more remarkable  still, with a distinct and extremely peculiar North Country accent. "In  the nineteenth year of the reign of his most gracious majesty, King  Charles the Second," he blurted out, viciously, with an angry look at the  Frenchman, "I, Nathaniel Cross, of the borough of Sunderland, in the  county of Doorham, in England, an able-bodied mariner, then sailing the  South Seas in the good bark Martyr Prince, of the Port of Great Grimsby,  whereof one Thomas Wells, gent., under God, was master--"    
"Oh, hush, hush!" Muriel cried, unable to catch the parrot's precious  words through the emulous echo of the Frenchman's music. "Whereof one  Thomas Wells, gent., under God, was master--go on, Polly."    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"Perruque blonde <br>  Et collet noir,"</small></i></blockquote><br>
the Frenchman repeated, with a half-offended voice, finishing his stanza.    
But just as he stopped, Methuselah stopped too, and, throwing back his  head in the air with a triumphant look, stared hard at his vanquished and  silenced opponent out of those blinking gray eyes of his. "I thought I'd  be too much for you!" he seemed to say, wrathfully.    
"Whereof one Thomas Wells, gent., under God, was master," Muriel  suggested again, all agog with excitement. "Go on, good bird! Go on,  pretty Polly."    
But Methuselah was evidently put off the scent now by the unseasonable  interruption. Instead of continuing, he threw back his head a second time  with a triumphant air and laughed aloud boisterously. "Pretty Polly," he  cried. "Pretty Polly wants a nut. Tu-Kila-Kila maroo! Pretty Poll! Pretty  Polly!"    
"Sing again, for Heaven's sake!" Felix exclaimed, in a profoundly  agitated mood, explaining briefly to the Frenchman the full significance  of the words Methuselah had just begun to utter.    
The Frenchman struck up his tune afresh to give the bird a start; but all  to no avail. Methuselah was evidently in no humor for talking just then.  He listened with a callous, uncritical air, bringing his white eyelids  down slowly and sleepily over his bleared gray eyes. Then he nodded his  head slowly. "No use," the Frenchman murmured, pursing his lips up  gravely. "The bird won't talk. It's going off to sleep now. Methuselah  gets visibly older every day, monsieur and mademoiselle. You are only  just in time to catch his last accents."
