Betty went to the Senate Gallery that afternoon for the first time in  several days. It was hard work to keep up with the calling frenzy of  Washington and cultivate one's intellect at the same time. There was  no one in the private gallery but an old man with a hayseed beard and  horny hands. He sat on the first chair in the front row, but rose  politely to let Betty pass; and she took off her veil and jacket and  gloves and settled herself for a comfortable afternoon. She felt  almost as much at home in this family section of the Senate Gallery as  in her own room with a copy of the Congressional Record in her hand.  Sometimes save for herself it would be empty, when every other  gallery, but the Diplomats', of that fine amphitheatre would be nearly  full. It was crowded, however, when it was unofficially known that a  favourite Senator would speak, or an important bill on the calendar  provoke a debate. Leontine no longer accompanied her mistress; she had  threatened to leave unless exempted from political duty.    
To-day a distinguished Senator on the other side of the Chamber was  attacking with caustic emphasis a Republican measure. He was the only  man in the Senate with a real Uncle Sam beard. Senator Shattuc's waved  like a golden fan from his powerful jaw; but the Democratic appendage  opposite was long and narrow, and whisked over the Senator's shoulder  like the tail of a comet, when he became heated in controversy. It was  flying about at a great rate to-day, and Betty was watching it with  much interest, when a proud voice remarked in her ear,--    
"That's my Senator, marm. He's powerful eloquent, ain't he?"    
Betty nodded. "He's quite a leader."    
"I allow he is. He's been leadin' in our State fur twenty years. I  allus wanted to hear him speak in Congress, and when I called on him  last Monday--when I come to Washington--he told me to come up here to-  day and hear him, and he would set me in the Senators' Gallery. And he  did."    
His voice became a distant humming in Betty's ears. Senator North had  entered and taken his seat. He apparently settled himself to listen to  the speech, and he looked as calm and unhurried as usual.    
"That's North," whispered the old man. "There wuz a lady in here a  spell since who pinted a lot of 'em out to me. He looks a little too  hard and stern to suit me. I like the kind that slaps you on the back  and says 'Howdy.' Now Senator North, he never would: I know plenty  that knows him. He's aristocratic; and I don't like his politics,  neither. I allus suspicion that politicians ain't all right when  they're aristocratic."    
"He does not happen to be a politician."    
"Hey?"    
"Don't you want to listen to your Senator? He is very eloquent."    
"He's been speakin' fur an hour steady," said the visitor to  Washington, philosophically. "I kinder thought I'd like to talk to you  a spell. Hev you seen the new library?" "Oh, yes; I live here."    
"Do ye? Well, you're lucky. For this city's so grand it's jest a  pleasure to walk around. And that Library's the most beautiful  buildin' I ever saw in all my seventy-two years. I've been twice a day  to look at it, and it makes me feel proud to be an Amurrican. If  Paradise is any more beautiful than that there buildin', I do want to  go there."    
Betty smiled with the swift sympathy she always felt for genuine  simplicity, and the old man's pride in his country's latest  achievement was certainly touching. She refrained from telling him  that she thought the red and yellow ceilings hideous, and delighted  him with the assurance that it was the finest modern building in the  world.    
"What's happened to ye?" he asked sharply, a moment later. "You've  straightened up and thrown back your head as if ye owned the hull  Senate."    
Senator North had wheeled about slowly and glanced up at the private  gallery. Then he had risen abruptly and gone into the cloak-room.    
"Perhaps I do," said Betty.    
She spoke thickly. It seemed incredible that he was coming up to the  gallery at last. She had another humble moment and felt it to be a  great honour. But she smiled so brilliantly at the old man that he  grinned with delight.    
"I presume you're the darter of one of these here Senators," he said;  "one of the rich ones. You look as if ye hed it all your own way in  life, and seein' as you're young and pretty, meanin' no offence, I'm  glad you hev. Is your pa one of the leadin' six?"    
"My father is dead." She heard the door open and turned her head  quickly. It was Senator Shattuc who had entered. He walked rapidly  down the aisle, took a seat in the second row of chairs, and gave her  a hearty grip of the hand.    
"How are you?" he asked. "I was glad to see you were up here. You  always look so pleased with the world that it does me good to get a  glimpse of you."    
Betty liked Senator Shattuc, and held him in high esteem, but at that  moment she would willingly have set fire to his political beard. She  was used to self-control, however, and she chatted pleasantly with him  for ten minutes, while her heart seemed to descend to a lower rib, and  her brain reiterated that eternal question of woman which must  reverberate in the very ears of Time himself.    
He came at last, and Senator Shattuc amiably got up and let him pass  in, then took the chair behind the old man and asked him a few good-  natured questions before turning to Betty again.    
"I started to come some time ago," said Senator North, "but I was  detained in one of the corridors. It is hard to escape being  buttonholed. This time it was by a young woman from my State who wants  a position in the Pension Office. If it had been a man I should have  ordered him about his business, but of course one of your charming sex  in distress is another matter. However, I got rid of her, and here I  am."    
"I knew you were coming. I should have waited for you." Now that he  was there she subdued her exuberance of spirit; but she permitted her  voice to soften and her eyes to express something more than  hospitality. He was looking directly into them, and his hard powerful  face was bright with pleasure.    
"It suddenly occurred to me that you might be up here," he said; "and  I lost no time finding out." He lowered his voice. "Did you go? Has it  turned out all right?"    
"Yes, I went! I'll tell you all about it on Sunday. I never had such a  painful experience."    
"Well, I'm glad you had it. You would have felt a great deal worse if  you had shirked it. However--Yes?"    
Senator Shattuc was asking him if he thought the Democratic Senator  was in his usual form.    
"No," he said, "I don't. What is he wasting his wind for, anyway?  We'll pass the bill, and he's all right with his constituents. They  know there's no more rabid watch-dog of the Treasury in America."    
"I suspect it does him good to bark at us," said Senator Shattuc.    
The old man looked uneasy. "Ain't that a great speech?" he asked.    
The two Senators laughed. "Well, it's better than some," said Shattuc.  "And few can make a better when he's got a subject worthy of him," he  added kindly.    
"That's perlite, seein' as you're a Republican. I allow as I'll go.  Good-day, marm. I'll never forgit as how you told me you'd bin all  over Yurrup and that there ain't no modern buildin' so fine as our new  Library. Good-day to ye, sirs."    
Senator Shattuc shook him warmly by the hand. Senator North nodded,  and Betty gave him a smile which she meant to be cordial but was a  trifle absent. She wished that Senator Shattuc would follow him, but  he sat down again at once. He, too, felt at home in that gallery, and  it had never occurred to him that one Senator might be more welcome  there than another. Senator North's face hardened, and Betty, fearing  that he would go, said hurriedly,--    
"Ar'n't you ever going to speak again? I have heard you only once."    
"I rarely make set speeches, although I not infrequently engage in  debate--when some measure comes up that needs airing."    
"You ought to speak oftener, North," said Senator Shattuc. "You always  wake us up."    
"You have no business to go to sleep. If I talked when I had nothing  to say, you'd soon cease to be waked up. Our friend over there has put  three of our esteemed colleagues to sleep. He'll clear the galleries  in a moment and interfere with Norris's record.--I suppose you have  never seen that memorable sight," he said to Betty: "an entire gallery  audience get up and walk out when a certain Senator takes the floor?"    
"How very rude!"    
"The great American public loves a show, and when the show is not to  its taste it has no hesitation in making its displeasure known."    
"Why do you despise the great American public? You never raise your  voice so that any one in the second row up here can hear you."    
"I have no love for the gallery. Nor do I talk to constituents. When  it is necessary to talk to my colleagues, I do so, and it matters  little to me whether the reporters and the public hear me or not. When  my constituents are particularly anxious to know what stand I have  taken on a certain question, I have the speech printed and send it to  them; but as a rule they take my course for granted and let me alone."    
"But tell me, Mr. North," said Betty, squaring about and putting her  questions so pointedly that he, perforce, must answer them, "would you  really not like to make a speech down there that would thrill the  nation, as the speeches of Clay and Webster used to? And you could  make a speech like that. <i>Why</i> don't you?"    
"My dear Miss Madison, if I attempted to thrill the American people by  lofty emotions and an impassioned appeal to their higher selves, I  should only bring down a storm of ridicule from seven-eighths of the  American press. I could survive that, for I should not read it, but my  effort would be thrown away. The people to whom it was directed would  feel ashamed of what thrill was left in it after it had reached them  through the only possible medium. This is the age--in this country--of  hard practical sense without any frills, or thrills. It is true that  there is a certain amount of sham oratory surviving in the Senate, but  the very fact that it is sham protects it from the press. The real  thing would irritate and alarm the spirits of mediocrity and  sensationalism which dominate the press to-day. A sensational speech,  one in which a man makes a fool of himself, it delights in, and it  encourages him by half a column of head-lines. A speech by a great  man, granted that we had one, carried away by lofty patriotism  and striving to raise his country, if only for a moment, to his own  pure altitude, would make the press feel uneasy and resentful, and it  would neutralize every word he uttered by the surest of all acids,  ridicule. An American statesman of to-day must be content to legislate  quietly, to use his intellect and his patriotism in the Committee  Room, and to keep a sharp eye on the bills brought forward by other  Committees. As for speeches, those look best in the Record which make  no appeal to the gallery. There, you cannot say I have not made you a  speech!" "Well, make me another, and tell me why you even consider the  power of the press. I mean, how you bring yourself even to think  about it. You have defied public opinion more than once. You have  stood up and told your own State that it was wrong and that you would  not legislate as it demanded. I am sure you would defy the whole  country, if you felt like it."    
"Ah, that is another matter. The hard-headed American respects honest  convictions, especially when they are maintained in defiance of self-  interest. I never shall lose my State by an unwavering policy, however  much I may irritate it for the moment. I could a heterogeneous Western  State, of course, but not a New England one. We are a conservative,  strong-willed race, and we despise the waverer. We are hard because it  always has been a hard struggle for survival with us. Therefore we  know what we want, and we have no desire to change when we get it.  There goes the bell for Executive Session. You and I must go our  different ways."
