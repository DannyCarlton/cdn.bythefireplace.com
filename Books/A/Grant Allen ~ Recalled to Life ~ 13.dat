Two days later, Cousin Willie drove us over to Berry Pomeroy. The  lion of the place is the castle, of course; but Minnie had told him  beforehand I wanted, for reasons of my own, to visit the  cricket-field where the sports were held "the year Dr. Ivor won the  mile race, you remember." So we went there straight. As soon as we  entered, I recognised the field at once, and the pavilion, and the  woods, as being precisely the same as those presented in the  photograph. But I got no further than that. The captain of the  cricket-club was on the ground that day, and I managed to get into  conversation with him, and strolled off in the grounds. There I  showed him the photograph, and asked if he could identify the man  climbing over the wagon: but he said he couldn't recognise him.  Somebody or other from Torquay, perhaps; not a regular resident. The  figures were so small, and so difficult to make sure about. If I'd  leave him the photograph, perhaps--but at that I drew back, for I  didn't want anybody, least of all at Torquay, to know what quest I  was engaged upon.    
We drove back, a merry party enough, in spite of my failure. Minnie  was always so jolly, and her mirth was contagious. She talked all  the way still of Dr. Ivor, half-teasing me. It was all very well my  pretending not to remember, she said; but why did I want to see the  cricket-field if it wasn't for that? Poor Courtenay! if only he  knew, how delighted he'd be to know he wasn't forgotten! For he  really took it to heart, my illness--she always called it my  illness, and so I suppose it was. From the day I lost my memory,  nothing seemed to go right with him; and he was never content till  he went and buried himself somewhere in the wilds of Canada.    
That evening again, I sat with Minnie in my room. I was depressed  and distressed. I didn't want to cry before Minnie, but I could have  cried with good heart for sheer vexation. Of course I couldn't bear  to go showing the photograph to all the world, and letting everybody  see I'd made myself a sort of amateur detective. They would mistake  my motives so. And yet I didn't know how I was ever to find out my  man any other way. It was that or nothing. I made up my mind I would  ask Cousin Willie.    
I took out the photograph, as if unintentionally, when I went to my  box, and laid it down with my curling-tongs on the table close by  Minnie. Minnie took it up abstractedly and looked at it with an  indefinite gaze.    
"Why, this is the cricket-field!" she cried, as soon as she  collected her senses. "One of your father's experiments. The  earliest acmegraphs. How splendidly they come out! See, that's Sir  Everard at the bottom; and there's little Jack Hillier above; and  this on one side's Captain Brooks; and there, in front of all--well,  you know <i>him</i> anyhow, Una. Now, don't pretend you forget! That's  Courtenay Ivor!"    
Her finger was on the man who stood poised ready to jump. With an  awful recoil, I drew back and suppressed a scream. It was on the tip  of my tongue to cry out, "Why, that's my father's murderer!"    
But, happily, with a great effort of will I restrained myself. I saw  it all at a glance. That, then, was the meaning of Dr. Marten's  warning! No wonder, I thought, the shock had disorganised my whole  brain. If Minnie was right, I was in love once with that man. And I  must have seen my lover murder my father!    
For I didn't doubt, from what Minnie said, I had really once loved  Dr. Ivor. Horrible and ghastly as it might be to realise it, I  didn't doubt it was the truth. I had once loved the very man I was  now bent on pursuing as a criminal and a murderer!    
"You're sure that's him, Minnie?" I cried, trying to conceal my  agitation. "You're sure that's Courtenay Ivor, the man stooping on  the wagon-top?"    
Minnie looked at me, smiling. She thought I was asking for a very  different reason.    
"Yes, that's him, right enough, dear," she said. "I could tell him  among a thousand. Why, the Moore hand alone would be quite enough to  know him by. It's just like my own. We've all of us got it--except  yourself. I always said you weren't one of us. You're a regular born  Callingham."    
I gazed at her fixedly. I could hardly speak.    
"Oh, Minnie!" I cried once more, "have you ... have you any  photograph of him?"    
"No, we haven't, dear," Minnie answered.    
"That was a fad of Courtenay's, you know. Wherever he went, he'd  never be photographed. He was annoyed that day that your father  should have taken him unawares. He hated being 'done,' he said. He's  so handsome and so nice, but he's not a bit conceited. And he was  such a splendid bicyclist! He rode over and back on his bicycle that  day, and then ran in all the races as if it were nothing."    
A light burst over me at once. This was circumstantial evidence. The  murderer who disappeared as if by magic the moment his crime was  committed must have come and gone all unseen, no doubt, on his  bicycle. He must have left it under the window till his vile deed  was done, and then leapt out upon it in a second and dashed off  whence he came like a flash of lightning.    
It was a premeditated crime, in that case, not the mere casual  result of a sudden quarrel.    
I must find out this man now, were it only to relieve my own sense  of mystery.    
"Minnie," I said once more, screwing up my courage to ask, "where's  Dr. Ivor now? I mean--that is to say--in what part of Canada?"    
Minnie looked at me and laughed.    
"There, I told you so!" she said, merrily. "It's not the least bit  of use your pretending you're not in love with him, Una. Why, just  look how you tremble! You're as white as a ghost! And then you say  you don't care for poor Courtenay! I forget the exact name of the  place where he lives, but I've got it in my desk, and I can tell you  to-morrow.--Oh, yes; it's Palmyra, on the Canada Pacific. I suppose  you want to write to him. Or perhaps you mean to go out and offer  yourself bodily."    
It was awful having to bottle up the truth in one's own heart, and  to laugh and jest like this; but I endured it somehow.    
"No, it's not that," I said gravely. "I've other reasons of my own  for asking his address, Minnie. I want to go out there, it's true;  but not because I cherish the faintest pleasing recollection of Dr.  Ivor in any way."    
Minnie scanned me over in surprise.    
"Well, how you <i>are</i> altered, Una!" she cried. "I love you, dear, and  like you every bit as much as ever. But you've changed so much. I  don't think you're at all what you used to be. You're so grave and  sombre."    
"No wonder, Minnie," I exclaimed, bursting gladly into tears--the  excuse was such a relief--"no wonder, when you think how much I've  passed through!"    
Minnie flung her arms around my neck, and kissed me over and over  again.    
"Oh, dear!" she cried, melting. "What have I done? What have I said?  I ought never to have spoken so. It was cruel of me--cruel, Una  dear. I shall stop here to-night, and sleep with you."    
"Oh, thank you, darling!" I cried. "Minnie, that <i>is</i> good of you. I'm  so awfully glad. For to-morrow I must be thinking of getting ready  for Canada."    
"Canada!" Minnie exclaimed, alarmed. "You're not really going to  Canada! Oh, Una, you're joking! You don't mean to say you're going  out there to find him!"    
I took her hand in mine, and held it up in the air above her head  solemnly.    
"Dear cousin," I said, "I love you. But you must promise me this one  thing. Whatever may happen, give me your sacred word of honour  you'll never tell anybody what we've said here to-night. You'll  kill me if you do. I don't want any living soul on earth to know of  it."    
I spoke so seriously, Minnie felt it was important.    
"I promise you," she answered, growing suddenly far graver than her  wont. "Oh, Una, I haven't the faintest idea what you mean, but no  torture on earth shall ever wring a word of it from me!"    
So I went to bed in her arms, and cried myself to sleep, thinking  with my latest breath, in a tremor of horror, that I'd found it at  last. Courtenay Ivor was the name of my father's murderer!
