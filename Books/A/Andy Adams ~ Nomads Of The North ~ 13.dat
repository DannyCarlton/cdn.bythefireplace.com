  In many years there had not been such a storm in all the Northland   as that which followed swiftly in the trail of the first snows  that  had driven Neewa into his den&#8212;the late November storm of  that year  which will long be remembered as KUSKETA PIPPOON (the  Black Year), the  year of great and sudden cold, of starvation and  of death. 
  It came a week after Miki had left the cavern wherein Neewa was   sleeping so soundly. Preceding that, when all the forest world lay   under its mantle of white, the sun shone day after day, and the  moon  and stars were as clear as golden fires in the night skies.  The wind  was out of the west. The rabbits were so numerous they  made hard  floors of the snow in thicket and swamp. Caribou and  moose were  plentiful, and the early cry of wolves on the hunt was  like music in  the ears of a thousand trappers in shack and teepee. 
  With appalling suddenness came the unexpected. There was no   warning. The day had dawned with a clear sky, and a bright sun   followed the dawn. Then the world darkened so swiftly that men on   their traplines paused in amazement. With the deepening gloom came  a  strange moaning, and there was something in that sound that  seemed  like the rolling of a great drum&#8212;the knell of an impending  doom. It  was THUNDER. The warning was too late. Before men could  turn back to  safety, or build themselves shelters, the Big Storm  was upon them. For  three days and three nights it raged like a mad  bull from out of the  north. In the open barrens no living creature  could stand upon its  feet. The forests were broken, and all the  earth was smothered. All  things that breathed buried themselves&#8212;  or died; for the snow that  piled itself up in windrows and  mountains was round and hard as leaden  shot, and with it came an  intense cold. 
  On the third day it was sixty degrees below zero in the country   between the Shamattawa and Jackson's Knee. Not until the fourth  day  did living things begin to move. Moose and caribou heaved  themselves  up out of the thick covering of snow that had been  their protection;  smaller animals dug their way out of the heart  of deep drifts and  mounds; a half of the rabbits and birds were  dead. But the most  terrible toll was of men. Many of those who  were caught out succeeded  in keeping the life within their bodies,  and dragged themselves back  to teepee and shack. But there were  also many who did not return&#8212;five  hundred who died between Hudson  Bay and the Athabasca in those three  terrible days of the KUSKETA  PIPPOON. 
  In the beginning of the Big Storm Miki found himself in the   &quot;burnt&quot; country of Jackson's Knee, and instinct sent him quickly  into  deeper timber. Here he crawled into a windfall of tangled  trunks and  tree-tops, and during the three days he did not move.  Buried in the  heart of the storm, there came upon him an  overwhelming desire to  return to Neewa's den, and to snuggle up to  him once more, even though  Neewa lay as if dead. The strange  comradeship that had grown up  between the two&#8212;their wanderings  together all through the summer, the  joys and hardships of the  days and months in which they had fought and  feasted like  brothers&#8212;were memories as vivid in his brain as if it  had all  happened yesterday. And in the dark wind-fall, buried deeper  and  deeper under the snow, he dreamed. 
  He dreamed of Challoner, who had been his master in the days of   his joyous puppyhood; he dreamed of the time when Neewa, the   motherless cub, was brought into camp, and of the happenings that  had  come to them afterward; the loss of his master, of their  strange and  thrilling adventures in the wilderness, and last of  all of Neewa's  denning-up. He could not understand that. Awake,  and listening to the  storm, he wondered why it was that Neewa no  longer hunted with him,  but had curled himself up into a round  ball, and slept a sleep from  which he could not rouse him. Through  the long hours of the three days  and nights of storm it was  loneliness more than hunger that ate at his  vitals. When on the  morning of the fourth day he came out from under  the windfall his  ribs were showing and there was a reddish film over  his eyes.  First of all he looked south and east, and whined. 
  Through twenty miles of snow he travelled back that day to the   ridge where he had left Neewa. On this fourth day the sun shone  like  a dazzling fire. It was so bright that the glare of the snow  pricked  his eyes, and the reddish film grew redder. There was only  a cold glow  in the west when he came to the end of his journey.  Dusk had already  begun to settle over the roofs of the forests  when he reached the  ridge where Neewa had found the cavern. It was  no longer a ridge. The  wind had piled the snow up over it in  grotesque and monstrous shapes.  Rocks and bushes were obliterated.  Where the mouth of the cavern  should have been was a drift ten  feet deep. Cold and hungry, thinned  by his days and nights of  fasting, and with his last hope of  comradeship shattered by the  pitiless mountains of snow, Miki turned  back over his trail. There  was nothing left for him now but the old  windfall, and his heart  was no longer the heart of the joyous comrade  and brother of  Neewa, the bear. His feet were sore and bleeding, but  still he  went on. The stars came out; the night was ghostly white in  their  pale fire; and it was cold&#8212;terribly cold. The trees began to   snap. Now and then there came a report like a pistol-shot as the   frost snapped at the heart of timber. It was thirty degrees below   zero. And it was growing colder. With the windfall as his only   inspiration Miki drove himself on. Never had he tested his  strength  or his endurance as he strained them now. Older dogs  would have fallen  in the trail or have sought shelter or rest. But  Miki was the true son  of Hela, his giant Mackenzie hound father,  and he would have continued  until he triumphed&#8212;or died. 
  But a strange thing happened. He had travelled twenty miles to the   ridge, and fifteen of the twenty miles back, when a shelf of snow   gave way under his feet and he was pitched suddenly downward. When  he  gathered his dazed wits and stood up on his half frozen legs he  found  himself in a curious place. He had rolled completely into a   wigwam-shaped shelter of spruce boughs and sticks, and strong in  his  nostrils was the SMELL OF MEAT. He found the meat not more  than a foot  from the end of his nose. It was a chunk of frozen  caribou flesh  transfixed on a stick, and without questioning the  manner of its  presence he gnawed at it ravenously. Only Jacques Le  Beau, who lived  eight or ten miles to the east, could have  explained the situation.  Miki had rolled into one of his trap-  houses, and it was the bait he  was eating. 
  There was not much of it, but it fired Miki's blood with new life.   There was smell in his nostrils now, and he began clawing in the   snow. After a little his teeth struck something hard and cold. It  was  steel&#8212;a fisher trap. He dragged it up from under a foot of  snow, and  with it came a huge rabbit. The snow had so protected  the rabbit that,  although several days dead, it was not frozen  stiff. Not until the  last bone of it was gone did Miki's feast  end. He even devoured the  head. Then he went on to the windfall,  and in his warm nest slept  until another day. 
  That day Jacques Le Beau&#8212;whom the Indians called &quot;Muchet-ta-aao&quot;   (the One with an Evil Heart)&#8212;went over his trapline and rebuilt  his  snow-smothered &quot;houses&quot; and re-set his traps. 
  It was in the afternoon that Miki, who was hunting, struck his   trail in a swamp several miles from the windfall. No longer was  his  soul stirred by the wild yearning for a master. He sniffed,   suspiciously, of Le Beau's snowshoe tracks and the crest along his   spine trembled as he caught the wind, and listened. He followed   cautiously, and a hundred yards farther on came to one of Le  Beau's  KEKEKS or trap-shelters. Here too, there was meat&#8212;fixed on  a peg.  Miki reached in. From under his fore-paw came a vicious  snap and the  steel jaws of a trap flung sticks and snow into his  face. He snarled,  and for a few moments he waited, with his eyes  on the trap. Then he  stretched himself until he reached the meat,  without advancing his  feet. Thus he had discovered the hidden  menace of the steel jaws, and  instinct told him how to evade them. 
  For another third of a mile he followed Le Beau's tracks. He   sensed the presence of a new and thrilling danger, and yet he did  not  turn off the trail. An impulse which he was powerless to  resist drew  him on. He came to a second trap, and this time he  robbed the bait-peg  without springing the thing which he knew was  concealed close under  it. His long fangs clicked as he went on. He  was eager for a glimpse  of the man-beast. But he did not hurry. A  third, a fourth, and a fifth  trap he robbed of their meat. 
  Then, as the day ended, he swung westward and covered quickly the   five miles between the swamp and his windfall. 
  Half an hour later Le Beau came back over the line. He saw the   first empty KEKEK, and the tracks in the snow. 
  &quot;TONNERRE!&#8212;a wolf!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;And in broad day!&quot; 
  Then a slow look of amazement crept into his face, and he fell   upon his knees in the snow and examined the tracks. 
  &quot;NON!&quot; he gasped. &quot;It is a dog! A devil of a wild dog&#8212;robbing my   traps!&quot; 
  He rose to his feet, cursing. From the pocket of his coat he drew   a small tin box, and from this box he took a round ball of fat. In   the heart of the fat was a strychnine capsule. It was a poison-  bait,  to be set for wolves and foxes. 
  Le Beau chuckled exultantly as he stuck the deadly lure on the end   of the bait-peg. 
  &quot;OW, a wild dog,&quot; he growled. &quot;I will teach him. To-morrow he will   be dead.&quot; 
  On each of the five ravished bait-pegs he placed a strychnine   capsule rolled in its inviting little ball of fat.
