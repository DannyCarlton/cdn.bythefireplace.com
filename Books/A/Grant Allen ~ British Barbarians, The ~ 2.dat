The time was Saturday afternoon; the place was Surrey; the person  of the drama was Philip Christy.    
He had come down by the early fast train to Brackenhurst. All the  world knows Brackenhurst, of course, the greenest and leafiest of  our southern suburbs. It looked even prettier than its wont just  then, that town of villas, in the first fresh tenderness of its wan  spring foliage, the first full flush of lilac, laburnum, horse-  chestnut, and guelder-rose. The air was heavy with the odour of May  and the hum of bees. Philip paused a while at the corner, by the  ivied cottage, admiring it silently. He was glad he lived there--  so very aristocratic! What joy to glide direct, on the enchanted  carpet of the South-Eastern Railway, from the gloom and din and  bustle of Cannon Street, to the breadth and space and silence and  exclusiveness of that upland village! For Philip Christy was a  gentlemanly clerk in Her Majesty's Civil Service.    
As he stood there admiring it all with roving eyes, he was startled  after a moment by the sudden, and as it seemed to him unannounced  apparition of a man in a well-made grey tweed suit, just a yard or  two in front of him. He was aware of an intruder. To be sure, there  was nothing very remarkable at first sight either in the stranger's  dress, appearance, or manner. All that Philip noticed for himself  in the newcomer's mien for the first few seconds was a certain  distinct air of social superiority, an innate nobility of gait  and bearing. So much at least he observed at a glance quite  instinctively. But it was not this quiet and unobtrusive tone,  as of the Best Society, that surprised and astonished him;  Brackenhurst prided itself, indeed, on being a most well-bred and  distinguished neighbourhood; people of note grew as thick there as  heather or whortleberries. What puzzled him more was the abstruser  question, where on earth the stranger could have come from so  suddenly. Philip had glanced up the road and down the road just two  minutes before, and was prepared to swear when he withdrew his eyes  not a soul loomed in sight in either direction. Whence, then, could  the man in the grey suit have emerged? Had he dropped from the  clouds? No gate opened into the road on either side for two hundred  yards or more; for Brackenhurst is one of those extremely  respectable villa neighbourhoods where every house--an eligible  family residence--stands in its own grounds of at least six acres.  Now Philip could hardly suspect that so well dressed a man of such  distinguished exterior would be guilty of such a gross breach of  the recognised code of Brackenhurstian manners as was implied in  the act of vaulting over a hedgerow. So he gazed in blank wonder  at the suddenness of the apparition, more than half inclined to  satisfy his curiosity by inquiring of the stranger how the dickens  he had got there.    
A moment's reflection, however, sufficed to save the ingenuous  young man from the pitfall of so serious a social solecism. It  would be fatal to accost him. For, mark you, no matter how  gentlemanly and well-tailored a stranger may look, you can never be  sure nowadays (in these topsy-turvy times of subversive radicalism)  whether he is or is not really a gentleman. That makes  acquaintanceship a dangerous luxury. If you begin by talking to a  man, be it ever so casually, he may desire to thrust his company  upon you, willy-nilly, in future; and when you have ladies of your  family living in a place, you really <i>cannot</i> be too particular what  companions you pick up there, were it even in the most informal and  momentary fashion. Besides, the fellow might turn out to be one of  your social superiors, and not care to know you; in which case, of  course, you would only be letting yourself in for a needless  snubbing. In fact, in this modern England of ours, this fatherland  of snobdom, one passes one's life in a see-saw of doubt, between  the Scylla and Charybdis of those two antithetical social dangers.  You are always afraid you may get to know somebody you yourself do  not want to know, or may try to know somebody who does not want to  know you.    
Guided by these truly British principles of ancestral wisdom,  Philip Christy would probably never have seen anything more of the  distinguished-looking stranger had it not been for a passing  accident of muscular action, over which his control was distinctly  precarious. He happened in brushing past to catch the stranger's  eye. It was a clear blue eye, very deep and truthful. It somehow  succeeded in riveting for a second Philip's attention. And it was  plain the stranger was less afraid of speaking than Philip himself  was. For he advanced with a pleasant smile on his open countenance,  and waved one gloveless hand in a sort of impalpable or half-  checked salute, which impressed his new acquaintance as a vaguely  polite Continental gesture. This affected Philip favourably: the  newcomer was a somebody then, and knew his place: for just in  proportion as Philip felt afraid to begin conversation himself with  an unplaced stranger, did he respect any other man who felt so  perfectly sure of his own position that he shared no such middle-  class doubts or misgivings. A duke is never afraid of accosting  anybody. Philip was strengthened, therefore, in his first idea,  that the man in the grey suit was a person of no small distinction  in society, else surely he would not have come up and spoken with  such engaging frankness and ease of manner.    
"I beg your pardon," the stranger said, addressing him in pure and  limpid English, which sounded to Philip like the dialect of the  very best circles, yet with some nameless difference of intonation  or accent which certainly was not foreign, still less provincial,  or Scotch, or Irish; it seemed rather like the very purest well of  English undefiled Philip had ever heard,--only, if anything, a  little more so; "I beg your pardon, but I'm a stranger hereabouts,  and I should be so <i>very</i> much obliged if you could kindly direct me  to any good lodgings."    
His voice and accent attracted Philip even more now he stood near  at hand than his appearance had done from a little distance. It was  impossible, indeed, to say definitely in set terms what there was  about the man that made his personality and his words so charming;  but from that very first minute, Philip freely admitted to himself  that the stranger in the grey suit was a perfect gentleman. Nay, so  much did he feel it in his ingenuous way that he threw off at once  his accustomed cloak of dubious reserve, and, standing still to  think, answered after a short pause, "Well, we've a great many very  nice furnished houses about here to let, but not many lodgings.  Brackenhurst's a cut above lodgings, don't you know; it's a  residential quarter. But I should think Miss Blake's, at  Heathercliff House, would perhaps be just the sort of thing to  suit you."    
"Oh, thank you," the stranger answered, with a deferential  politeness which charmed Philip once more by its graceful  expressiveness. "And could you kindly direct me to them? I don't  know my way about at all, you see, as yet, in this country."    
"With pleasure," Philip replied, quite delighted at the chance of  solving the mystery of where the stranger had dropped from. "I'm  going that way myself, and can take you past her door. It's only a  few steps. Then you're a stranger in England?"    
The newcomer smiled a curious self-restrained smile. He was both  young and handsome. "Yes, I'm a stranger in your England," he  answered, gravely, in the tone of one who wishes to avoid an  awkward discussion. "In fact, an Alien. I only arrived here this  very morning."    
"From the Continent?" Philip inquired, arching his eyebrows  slightly.    
The stranger smiled again. "No, not from the Continent," he  replied, with provoking evasiveness.    
"I thought you weren't a foreigner," Philip continued in a blandly  suggestive voice. "That is to say," he went on, after a second's  pause, during which the stranger volunteered no further statement,  "you speak English like an Englishman."    
"Do I?" the stranger answered. "Well, I'm glad of that. It'll make  intercourse with your Englishmen so much more easy."    
By this time Philip's curiosity was thoroughly whetted. "But you're  not an Englishman, you say?" he asked, with a little natural  hesitation.    
"No, not exactly what you call an Englishman," the stranger  replied, as if he didn't quite care for such clumsy attempts to  examine his antecedents. "As I tell you, I'm an Alien. But we  always spoke English at home," he added with an afterthought, as if  ready to vouchsafe all the other information that lay in his power.    
"You can't be an American, I'm sure," Philip went on, unabashed,  his eagerness to solve the question at issue, once raised, getting  the better for the moment of both reserve and politeness.    
"No, I'm certainly not an American," the stranger answered with a  gentle courtesy in his tone that made Philip feel ashamed of his  rudeness in questioning him.    
"Nor a Colonist?" Philip asked once more, unable to take the hint.    
"Nor a Colonist either," the Alien replied curtly. And then he  relapsed into a momentary silence which threw upon Philip the  difficult task of continuing the conversation.    
The member of Her Britannic Majesty's Civil Service would have  given anything just that minute to say to him frankly, "Well, if  you're not an Englishman, and you're not an American, and you're  not a Colonist, and you <i>are</i> an Alien, and yet you talk English like  a native, and have always talked it, why, what in the name of  goodness do you want us to take you for?" But he restrained himself  with difficulty. There was something about the stranger that made  him feel by instinct it would be more a breach of etiquette to  question him closely than to question any one he had ever met with.    
They walked on along the road for some minutes together, the  stranger admiring all the way the golden tresses of the laburnum  and the rich perfume of the lilac, and talking much as he went of  the quaintness and prettiness of the suburban houses. Philip  thought them pretty, too (or rather, important), but failed to see  for his own part where the quaintness came in. Nay, he took the  imputation as rather a slur on so respectable a neighbourhood: for  to be quaint is to be picturesque, and to be picturesque is to be  old-fashioned. But the stranger's voice and manner were so  pleasant, almost so ingratiating, that Philip did not care to  differ from him on the abstract question of a qualifying epithet.  After all, there's nothing positively insulting in calling a house  quaint, though Philip would certainly have preferred, himself, to  hear the Eligible Family Residences of that Aristocratic  Neighbourhood described in auctioneering phrase as "imposing,"  "noble," "handsome," or "important-looking."    
Just before they reached Miss Blake's door, the Alien paused for a  second. He took out a loose handful of money, gold and silver  together, from his trouser pocket. "One more question," he said,  with that pleasant smile on his lips, "if you'll excuse my  ignorance. Which of these coins is a pound, now, and which is a  sovereign?"    
"Why, a pound <i>is</i> a sovereign, of course," Philip answered briskly,  smiling the genuine British smile of unfeigned astonishment that  anybody should be ignorant of a minor detail in the kind of life he  had always lived among. To be sure, he would have asked himself  with equal simplicity what was the difference between a twenty-  franc piece, a napoleon, and a louis, or would have debated as to  the precise numerical relation between twenty-five cents and a  quarter of a dollar; but then, those are mere foreign coins, you  see, which no fellow can be expected to understand, unless he  happens to have lived in the country they are used in. The others  are British and necessary to salvation. That feeling is instinctive  in the thoroughly provincial English nature. No Englishman ever  really grasps for himself the simple fact that England is a foreign  country to foreigners; if strangers happen to show themselves  ignorant of any petty matter in English life, he regards their  ignorance as silly and childish, not to be compared for a moment to  his own natural unfamiliarity with the absurd practices of foreign  nations.    
The Alien, indeed, seemed to have learned beforehand this curious  peculiarity of the limited English intellect; for he blushed  slightly as he replied, "I know your currency, as a matter of  arithmetic, of course: twelve pence make one shilling; twenty  shillings make one pound--"    
"Of course," Philip echoed in a tone of perfect conviction; it  would never have occurred to him to doubt for a moment that  everybody knew intuitively those beggarly elements of the inspired  British monetary system.    
"Though they're singularly awkward units of value for any one  accustomed to a decimal coinage: so unreasonable and illogical,"  the stranger continued blandly, turning over the various pieces  with a dubious air of distrust and uncertainty.    
"I <i>beg</i> your pardon," Philip said, drawing himself up very stiff,  and scarcely able to believe his ears (he was an official of Her  Britannic Majesty's Government, and unused to such blasphemy). "Do  I understand you to say, you consider pounds, shillings, and pence  <i>unreasonable</i>?"    
He put an emphasis on the last word that might fairly have struck  terror to the stranger's breast; but somehow it did not. "Why,  yes," the Alien went on with imperturbable gentleness: "no order or  principle, you know. No rational connection. A mere survival from  barbaric use. A score, and a dozen. The score is one man, ten  fingers and ten toes; the dozen is one man with shoes on--fingers  and feet together. Twelve pence make one shilling; twenty shillings  one pound. How very confusing! And then, the nomenclature's so  absurdly difficult! Which of these is half-a-crown, if you please,  and which is a florin? and what are their respective values in  pence and shillings?"    
Philip picked out the coins and explained them to him separately.  The Alien meanwhile received the information with evident interest,  as a traveller in that vast tract that is called Abroad might note  the habits and manners of some savage tribe that dwells within its  confines, and solemnly wrapped each coin up in paper, as his  instructor named it for him, writing the designation and value  outside in a peculiarly beautiful and legible hand. "It's so  puzzling, you see," he said in explanation, as Philip smiled  another superior and condescending British smile at this infantile  proceeding; "the currency itself has no congruity or order: and  then, even these queer unrelated coins haven't for the most part  their values marked in words or figures upon them."    
"Everybody knows what they are," Philip answered lightly. Though  for a moment, taken aback by the novelty of the idea, he almost  admitted in his own mind that to people who had the misfortune to  be born foreigners, there <i>was</i> perhaps a slight initial difficulty  in this unlettered system. But then, you cannot expect England to  be regulated throughout for the benefit of foreigners! Though, to  be sure, on the one occasion when Philip had visited the Rhine and  Switzerland, he had grumbled most consumedly from Ostend to  Grindelwald, at those very decimal coins which the stranger seemed  to admire so much, and had wondered why the deuce Belgium, Germany,  Holland, and Switzerland could not agree among themselves upon a  uniform coinage; it would be so much more convenient to the British  tourist. For the British tourist, of course, is <i>not</i> a foreigner.    
On the door-step of Miss Blake's Furnished Apartments for Families  and Gentlemen, the stranger stopped again. "One more question," he  interposed in that same suave voice, "if I'm not trespassing too  much on your time and patience. For what sort of term--by the day,  month, year--does one usually take lodgings?"    
"Why, by the week, of course," Philip answered, suppressing a broad  smile of absolute surprise at the man's childish ignorance.    
"And how much shall I have to pay?" the Alien went on quietly.  "Have you any fixed rule about it?"    
"Of course not," Philip answered, unable any longer to restrain his  amusement (everything in England was "of course" to Philip). "You  pay according to the sort of accommodation you require, the number  of your rooms, and the nature of the neighbourhood."    
"I see," the Alien replied, imperturbably polite, in spite of  Philip's condescending manner. "And what do I pay per room in this  latitude and longitude?"    
For twenty seconds, Philip half suspected his new acquaintance of a  desire to chaff him: but as at the same time the Alien drew from  his pocket a sort of combined compass and chronometer which he  gravely consulted for his geographical bearings, Philip came to the  conclusion he must be either a seafaring man or an escaped lunatic.  So he answered him to the point. "I should think," he said quietly,  "as Miss Blake's are extremely respectable lodgings, in a first-  rate quarter, and with a splendid view, you'll probably have to pay  somewhere about three guineas."    
"Three what?" the stranger interposed, with an inquiring glance at  the little heap of coins he still held before him.    
Philip misinterpreted his glance. "Perhaps that's too much for  you," he suggested, looking severe; for if people cannot afford to  pay for decent rooms, they have no right to invade an aristocratic  suburb, and bespeak the attention of its regular residents.    
"Oh, that's not it," the Alien put in, reading his tone aright.  "The money doesn't matter to me. As long as I can get a tidy room,  with sun and air, I don't mind what I pay. It's the guinea I can't  quite remember about for the moment. I looked it up, I know, in a  dictionary at home; but I'm afraid I've forgotten it. Let me see;  it's twenty-one pounds to the guinea, isn't it? Then I'm to pay  about sixty-three pounds a week for my lodgings."    
This was the right spirit. He said it so simply, so seriously, so  innocently, that Philip was quite sure he really meant it. He was  prepared, if necessary, to pay sixty odd pounds a week in rent.  Now, a man like that is the proper kind of man for a respectable  neighbourhood. He'll keep a good saddle-horse, join the club, and  play billiards freely. Philip briefly explained to him the nature  of his mistake, pointing out to him that a guinea was an imaginary  coin, unrepresented in metal, but reckoned by prescription at  twenty-one shillings. The stranger received the slight correction  with such perfect nonchalance, that Philip at once conceived a  high opinion of his wealth and solvency, and therefore of his  respectability and moral character. It was clear that pounds and  shillings were all one to him. Philip had been right, no doubt,  in his first diagnosis of his queer acquaintance as a man of  distinction. For wealth and distinction are practically synonyms  in England for one and the same quality, possession of the  wherewithal.    
As they parted, the stranger spoke again, still more at sea. "And  are there any special ceremonies to be gone through on taking up  lodgings?" he asked quite gravely. "Any religious rites, I mean to  say? Any poojah or so forth? That is," he went on, as Philip's  smile broadened, "is there any taboo to be removed or appeased  before I can take up my residence in the apartments?"    
By this time Philip was really convinced he had to do with a  madman--perhaps a dangerous lunatic. So he answered rather testily,  "No, certainly not; how absurd! you must see that's ridiculous.  You're in a civilised country, not among Australian savages. All  you'll have to do is to take the rooms and pay for them. I'm sorry  I can't be of any further use to you, but I'm pressed for time  to-day. So now, good-morning."    
As for the stranger, he turned up the path through the lodging-  house garden with curious misgivings. His heart failed him. It was  half-past three by mean solar time for that particular longitude.  Then why had this young man said so briskly, "Good morning," at  3.30 P.M., as if on purpose to deceive him? Was he laying a trap?  Was this some wile and guile of the English medicine-men?
