The talk in the drawing-room of Mrs. Croix that night was of little else  but the Secretary's Report. Mrs. Croix, so said gossip, had concluded  that this was the proper time for the demise of her recalcitrant  officer, and had retired to weeds and a semi-seclusion while Mrs.  Washington pondered upon the propriety of receiving her. Her court cared  little for the facts, and vowed that she never had looked so fair or so  proud; Hamilton, that she shone with the splendour of a crystal star on  the black velvet skies of the Tropics. She wore, this evening, a few  yards of black gauze which left bare a crescent of her shining neck and  the lower arms. Her bright hair was arranged in a mass of ringlets,  after a fashion obtaining in Europe, and surmounted by a small turban of  gauze fastened with a diamond sun. Many of the men who visited her  habitually called her Lady Betty, for she was one of those women who  invite a certain playful familiarity while repelling intimacy. Hamilton  called her, as the fancy moved him, Egeria, Boadicea, or Lady Godiva.    
Clinton came in fuming. "It is not possible," he cried, "that the  Congress can be so mad as to be hoodwinked by this deep political scheme  for concentrating the liberties of the United States under the executive  heel. 'To cement more closely the union of the States and to add to  their security against foreign attack!' Forsooth! This assumption plan  is nothing more nor less than another of his dastardly schemes to  squeeze out of the poor States what little liberty he left them under  the Constitution. He could not obtain at Philadelphia all he wished for,  but now that Washington has given him both reins, he laughs in our  faces. I regret that I ever offered him my hand."    
"Then our party in Congress will fight him on political grounds?" asked  Mrs. Croix.    
"You may put it that way if you choose. It certainly will not be blinded  by his speciousness and aid him in his subtle monarchism. 'Contribute in  an eminent degree to an orderly, stable, and satisfactory arrangement of  the Nation's finances!' 'Several reasons which render it probable that  the situation of the State creditors will be worse than that of the  creditors of the Union, if there be not a national assumption of the  State debts!' And then his plan of debit and credit, with 'little doubt  that balances would appear in favour of all the States against the  United States!' My blood has boiled since I read that paper. I have  feared apoplexy. He is clever, that West Indian,--do they grow many  such?--but he did not select a country composed entirely of fools to  machinate in."    
"My dearest Governor," whispered Mrs. Croix, "calm yourself, pray. Only  you can cope with Mr. Hamilton. You must be the colossal spirit without  the walls of Congress to whom all will look for guidance. If you become  ill, the cause is lost."    
Clinton composed himself promptly, and asked Elbridge Gerry, of  Massachusetts, which, section of the Report he expected to attack first.  There were no Federalists present.    
Gerry shrugged his shoulders and shot a narrow glance of contempt at the  Governor. "Give me time, your Excellency, pray. Mr. Hamilton's paper has  the thought of a decade in it. It merits at least a week of thought on  our part. I never could agree with him in all things, but in some I am  at one with him; and I acknowledge myself deeply in his debt, insomuch  as he has taught me, among thousands of others, to 'think  continentally,' I certainly agree with him that to pay to present  holders the full value of their certificates, without discrimination, is  a matter of constitutional law, a violation of which would be a menace  to the new government. I shall support him on that point at the risk of  being accused of speculation."    
Stone, of Maryland, was striding up and down, but a degree less agitated  than the Governor of New York.    
"The man is cleverer than all the rest of us put together!" he  exclaimed. "Let us not forget that for an instant. A greater thought  than this of assumption has never been devised by man. If it be carried  into execution,--which God forbid,--it will prove a wall of adamant to  the Federal government, impregnable to any attempt on its fabric or  operations."    
"Oh, is it so bad as that?" asked Gerry. "Every fort falls if the siege  be sufficiently prolonged. I apprehend no such disaster, and I confess I  see much promise in at least two of Mr. Hamilton's schemes. After all,  the redemption of the country is what we must look to first."    
"You are a trimmer. Cannot you see that if the whole revenue of the  States be taken into the power of Congress, it will prove a band to draw  us so close together as not to leave the smallest interstice for  separation?"    
"But do you meditate separation?" asked Mrs. Croix. "Surely that would  be as great a crime as Mr. Hamilton's monarchical manoeuvres--if it be  true he practises such."    
"He is bold enough about them," snorted Clinton. "I do the man justice  to recognize his insolent frankness."    
"Those I cannot say I have observed," said Gerry. "Nor do I think that  we meditate separation. We are struggling out of one pit. It would be  folly to dig a deeper. And Massachusetts has a great debt, with  decreasing revenue for interest and redemption. I am not sure that  assumption would not be to her advantage. She stood the brunt of the  war. It is but fair that she should have relief now, even at the expense  of other States whose debt is insignificant; and she is able to take  care of herself against the Federal government--"    
"The brunt of the war!" exclaimed the Attorney-General of the Cabinet,  who, with the Speaker of the House, had just entered, and who had  controlled himself with difficulty for several seconds. "I beg to assure  you, sir, that Virginia may claim that honour. Her glorious patriotism,  her contributions in men and money--they exceeded those of any State in  the Union, sir."    
Gerry laughed. "I have no means of comparison by which patriotism may be  measured, Mr. Randolph," he said. "But we can produce figures, if  necessary, to prove our title to supremacy in the other matters you  mention. As you have reduced your debt, however, by an almost total  repudiation of your paper money--"    
"How about Mr. Madison?" asked Mrs. Croix, hurriedly. "He is your  fellow-statesman, Mr. Randolph, but he is Mr. Hamilton's devoted friend  and follower. Virginia may be sadly divided."    
"My fears have decreased on that point," said Randolph, drily. "Mr.  Madison's loyalty toward his State increases daily."    
"So does his ambition," observed Muhlenberg. "If I am not mistaken, he  has begun to chafe at Hamilton's arrangement of his destinies--and a  nature like that is not without deep and sullen jealousies. To be a  leader of leaders requires a sleepless art; to lead the masses is play  by comparison. Hamilton is a magician, but he is arrogant and impatient.  With all his art and control of men's minds, he will lose a follower now  and again, and not the least important would be--will be--Madison."    
"Have you proof?" asked Clinton, eagerly. "He would be of incomparable  value in our ranks. By the way, Aaron Burr is working to the front. He  is a born politician, if I am not mistaken, and is in a rapid process of  education. I feel sure that I have attached him to our cause by  appointing him Attorney-General of the Staite. He should make an  invaluable party man."    
"He will be attached to no cause," said Gerry. "He is, as you say, a  politician. There is not a germ of the statesman in him; nor of the  honest man, either, unless I am deeply mistaken. He is the only man of  note in the country who has not one patriotic act to his credit. He  fought, but so did every adventurous youth in the country; and had there  been anything more to his interest to do at the time, the Revolution  could have taken care of itself. But during all our trying desperate  years since--did he go once to Congress? Did he interest himself in the  Constitution, either at Philadelphia or Poughkeepsie? What record did he  make in the State Legislature during his one term of infrequent  attendance? While other men, notably Hamilton, of whom he betrays an  absurd jealousy, have been neglecting their private interests in the  public cause, he has been distinguishing himself as a femalist, and  thinking of nothing else but making money at the bar. I admit his  brilliancy, his intrepidity, and the exquisite quality of his address,  but I don't believe that an honest man who comes into contact with him  instinctively trusts him."    
"Oh, let us not indulge in such bitter personalities," cried Mrs. Croix,  who took no interest at that time in the temporary husband of her old  age. "Surely this coming legislation should compel every faculty. What  of the other debts?--of funding? Or, if it is still too soon to talk of  these matters with equilibrium," she added hastily, as Clinton turned  purple again, "pray tell me that the great question of deciding upon a  site for the Capital is nearing a solution. It has been such a source of  bitter agitation. I wish it were settled."    
"The House may or may not pass this bill for ten years in Philadelphia,  and the banks of the Potomac thereafter," growled the Senator from North  Carolina. "The Federalists have the majority, and they are determined to  keep the seat of government in the North, as they are determined to have  their monarchical will in everything. Madison hopes for some fortuitous  coincidence, but I confess I hardly know what he means."    
Gerry laughed. "When Madison takes to verbiage," he said, "I should  resort to a plummet and line."    
"Sir!" cried Randolph, limping toward the door in angry haste. "Mr.  Madison is one of the loftiest statesmen in the country!"    
"Has been. Centrifugal forces are in motion."    
"How everybody in politics does hate everybody else!" said Mrs. Croix,  with a patient sigh.
