  In two weeks all the business arrangements were completed, and  Ferguson and Harry became joint proprietors of the &#8220;Centreville  Gazette,&#8221; the latter being sole editor. The change was received with  favor in the village, as Harry had, as editor pro tem. for two months,  shown his competence for the position. It gave him prominence also in  town, and, though only nineteen, he already was classed with the  minister, the doctor and the lawyer. It helped him also with the weekly  papers to which he contributed in Boston, and his pay was once more  raised, while his sketches were more frequently printed. Now this was  all very pleasant, but it was not long before our hero found himself  overburdened with work.
  &#8220;What is the matter Harry? You look pale,&#8221; said Ferguson, one  morning.
  &#8220;I have a bad headache, and am feeling out of sorts.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't wonder at it. You are working too hard.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know about that.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do. You do nearly as much as I, as a compositor. Then you do all  the editorial work, besides writing sketches for the Boston papers.&#8221;
  &#8220;How can I get along with less? The paper must be edited, and I  shouldn't like giving up writing for the Boston papers.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell you what to do. Take a boy and train him up as a printer.  After a while he will relieve you almost wholly, while, by the time he  commands good wages, we shall be able to pay them.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a good idea, Ferguson. Do you know of any boy that wants to  learn printing?&#8221;
  &#8220;Haven't you got a younger brother?&#8221;
  &#8220;The very thing,&#8221; said Harry, briskly. &#8220;Father wrote to me last week  that he should like to get something for &#8212;&#8212;.&#8221;
  &#8220;Better write and offer him a place in the office.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will.&#8221;
  The letter was written at once. An immediate answer was received, of  a favorable nature. The boy was glad to leave home, and the father was  pleased to have him under the charge of his older brother.
  After he had become editor, and part proprietor of the &#8220;Gazette,&#8221;  Harry wrote to Oscar Vincent to announce his promotion. Though Oscar  had been in college now nearly two years, and they seldom met, the two  were as warm friends as ever, and from time to time exchanged letters.
  This was Oscar's reply:&#8212;
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;HARVARD COLLEGE, June 10.
  &#8220;DEAR MR. EDITOR: I suppose that's the proper way to address you  now. I congratulate you with all my heart on your brilliant success and  rapid advancement. Here you are at nineteen, while I am only a  rattle-brained sophomore. I don't mind being called that, by the way,  for at least it credits me with the possession of brains. Not that I am  doing so very badly. I am probably in the first third of the class, and  that implies respectable scholarship here.
  &#8220;But you&#8212;I can hardly realize that you, whom I knew only two or  three years since as a printer's apprentice (I won't use Fletcher's  word), have lifted yourself to the responsible position of sole editor.  Truly you have risen from the ranks!
  &#8220;Speaking of Fletcher, by the way, you know he is my classmate. He  occupies an honorable position somewhere near the foot of the class,  where he is likely to stay, unless he receives from the faculty leave  of absence for an unlimited period. I met him yesterday, swinging his  little cane, and looking as dandified as he used to.
  &#8220;'Hallo! Fletcher,' said I, 'I've just got a letter from a friend of  yours.'
  &#8220;'Who is it?' he asked.
  &#8220;'Harry Walton.'
  &#8220;'He never was a friend of mine,' said Fitz, turning up his  delicately chiselled nose,&#8212;'the beggarly printer's devil!'
  &#8220;I hope you won't feel sensitive about the manner in which Fitz  spoke of you.
  &#8220;'You've made two mistakes,' said I. 'He's neither a beggar nor a  printer's devil.'
  &#8220;'He used to be,' retorted Fitz.
  &#8220;'The last, not the first. You'll be glad to hear that he's getting  on well.'
  &#8220;'Has he had his wages raised twenty-five cents a week?' sneered  Fitz.
  &#8220;'He has lost his place,' said I.
  &#8220;Fletcher actually looked happy, but I dashed his happiness by  adding, 'but he's got a better one.'
  &#8220;'What's that?' he snarled.
  &#8220;'He has bought out the paper of Mr. Anderson, and is now sole  editor and part proprietor.'
  &#8220;'A boy like him buy a paper, without a cent of money and no  education!'
  &#8220;'You are mistaken. He had several hundred dollars, and as a writer  he is considerably ahead of either of us.'
  &#8220;'He'll run the paper into the ground,' said Fitz, prophetically.
  &#8220;'If he does, it'll only be to give it firmer root.'
  &#8220;'You are crazy about that country lout,' said Fitz. 'It isn't much  to edit a little village paper like that, after all.'
  &#8220;So you see what your friend Fitz thinks about it. As you may be in  danger of having your vanity fed by compliments from other sources, I  thought I would offset them by the candid opinion of a disinterested  and impartial scholar like Fitz.
  &#8220;I told my father of the step you have taken. 'Oscar,' said he,  'that boy is going to succeed. He shows the right spirit. I would have  given him a place on my paper, but very likely he does better to stay  where he is.'
  &#8220;Perhaps you noticed the handsome notice he gave you in his paper  yesterday. I really think he has a higher opinion of your talents than  of mine; which, of course, shows singular lack of discrimination.  However, you're my friend, and I won't make a fuss about it.
  &#8220;I am cramming for the summer examinations and hot work I find it, I  can tell you. This summer I am going to Niagara, and shall return by  way of the St. Lawrence and Montreal, seeing the Thousand Islands, the  rapids, and so on. I may send you a letter or two for the 'Gazette,' if  you will give me a puff in your editorial columns.&#8221;
  These letters were actually written, and, being very lively and  readable, Harry felt quite justified in referring to them in a  complimentary way. Fletcher's depreciation of him troubled him very  little.
  &#8220;It will make me neither worse nor better,&#8221; he reflected. &#8220;The time  will come, I hope, when I shall have risen high enough to be wholly  indifferent to such ill-natured sneers.&#8221;
  His brother arrived in due time, and was set to work as Harry  himself had been three years before. He was not as smart as Harry, nor  was he ever likely to rise as high; but he worked satisfactorily, and  made good progress, so that in six months he was able to relieve Harry  of half his labors as compositor. This, enabled him to give more time  to his editorial duties. Both boarded at Ferguson's, where they had a  comfortable home and good, plain fare.
  Meanwhile, Harry was acknowledged by all to have improved the paper,  and the most satisfactory evidence of the popular approval of his  efforts came in an increased subscription list, and this, of course,  made the paper more profitable. At the end of twelve months, the two  partners had paid off the money borrowed from Professor Henderson, and  owned the paper without incumbrance.
  &#8220;A pretty good year's work, Harry,&#8221; said Ferguson, cheerfully.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;but we'll do still better next year.&#8221;
