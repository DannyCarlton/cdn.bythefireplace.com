  After finishing her work at Colonel Preston's Mrs. Burke went home.  She did not see Mrs. Preston again, for the latter sent her the money  for her services by Ellen.
  &#8220;Mrs. Preston says you're not to come next week,&#8221; said Ellen.
  &#8220;She told me so herself this morning. She is angry because I took  the part of my boy against Master Godfrey.&#8221;
  &#8220;Godfrey's the hatefulest boy I ever see,&#8221; said Ellen, whose grammar  was a little defective. &#8220;He's always putting on airs.&#8221;
  &#8220;He struck my Andy, and Andy struck him back.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad he did,&#8221; said Ellen, emphatically. &#8220;I hope he'll do it  again.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want the boys to fight. Andy's a peaceable lad; and he'll  be quiet if he's let alone. But he's just like his poor father, and he  won't let anybody trample on him.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's where he's right,&#8221; said Ellen. &#8220;I'm sorry you're not coming  again, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;So am I, Ellen, for I need the money, but I'll stand by my boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;You iron real beautiful. I've heard Mrs. Preston say so often. She  won't get nobody that'll suit her so well.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you hear of anybody else that wants help, Ellen, will you send  them to me?&#8221;
  This Ellen faithfully promised, and Mrs. Burke went home, sorry to  have lost her engagement, but not sorry to have stood up for Andy, of  whom she was proud.
  Andy was at home when she returned. He had found enough to do at  home to occupy him so far. The next day he meant to go out in search of  employment. When his mother got back she found him cutting some brush  which he had obtained from the neighboring woods.
  &#8220;There, mother,&#8221; he said, pointing to a considerable pile, &#8220;you'll  have enough sticks to last you a good while.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Andy, dear. That'll save Mary and me a good deal of  trouble.&#8221;
  There was nothing in her words, but something in her tone, which led  Andy to ask:
  &#8220;What's the matter, mother? Has anything happened?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've got through working for Mrs. Preston, Andy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Got through? For to-day, you mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I'm not going to work there again.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
  &#8220;She complained of you, Andy.&#8221;
  &#8220;What did she say, mother?&#8221; asked our hero, listening with  attention.
  &#8220;She said you ought not to have struck Godfrey.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you tell her he struck me first?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;
  &#8220;And what did she say, thin?&#8221;
  &#8220;She said that you ought not to have struck him back.&#8221;
  &#8220;And what did you say, mother?&#8221;
  &#8220;I said my Andy wasn't the boy to stand still and let anybody beat  him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good for you, mother! Bully for you! That's where you hit the nail  on the head. And what did the ould lady say then?&#8221;
  &#8220;She told me I needn't come there again to work.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad you're not goin', mother. I don't want you to work for the  likes of her. Let her do her own ironin', the ould spalpeen!&#8221;
  In general, Andy's speech was tolerably clear of the brogue, but  whenever he became a little excited, as at present, it was more marked.  He was more angry at the slight to his mother than he would have been  at anything, however contemptuous, said to himself. He had that  chivalrous feeling of respect for his mother which every boy of his age  ought to have, more especially if that mother is a widow.
  &#8220;But, Andy, I'm very sorry for the money I'll lose.&#8221;
  &#8220;How much is it, mother?&#8221;
  &#8220;Seventy-five cents.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll make it up, mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know you will if you can, Andy; but work is hard to get, and the  pay is small.&#8221;
  &#8220;You might go back and tell Mrs. Preston that I'm a dirty spalpeen,  and maybe she'd take you back, mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't slander my own boy like that if she'd take me back  twenty times.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the way to talk, mother,&#8221; said Andy, well pleased. &#8220;Don't  you be afeared&#8212;we'll get along somehow. More by token, here's three  dollars I brought home with me yisterday.&#8221;
  Andy pulled out from his pocket six silver half-dollars, and offered  them to his mother.
  &#8220;Where did you get them, Andy?&#8221; she asked, in surprise.
  &#8220;Where did I get them? One way and another, by overwork. We won't  starve while them last, will we?&#8221;
  Andy's cheerful tone had its effect upon his mother.
  &#8220;Perhaps you're right, Andy,&#8221; she said, smiling. &#8220;At any rate we  won't cry till it's time.&#8221;
  &#8220;To-morrow I'll go out and see if I can find work.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you don't find it, Andy?&#8221; suggested his sister.
  &#8220;Then I'll take in washing,&#8221; said Andy, laughing. &#8220;It's an iligant  washer I'd make, wouldn't I now?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nobody'd hire you more than once, Andy.&#8221;
  By and by they had supper. If they had been alone they would have  got along on bread and tea; but &#8220;Andy needs meat, for he's a growing  boy,&#8221; said his mother.
  And so Mary was dispatched to the butcher's for a pound and a half  of beefsteak, which made the meal considerably more attractive. Mrs.  Burke felt that it was extravagant, particularly just as her income was  diminished, but she couldn't bear to stint Andy. At first she was not  going to eat, herself, meaning to save a part for Andy's breakfast; but  our hero found her out, and declared he wouldn't eat a bit if his  mother did not eat, too. So she was forced to take her share, and it  did her good, for no one can keep up a decent share of strength on  bread and tea alone.
  The next morning Andy went out in search of work. He had no very  definite idea where to go, or to whom to apply, but he concluded to put  in an application anywhere he could.
  He paused in front of the house of Deacon Jones, a hard-fisted old  farmer, whose reputation for parsimony was well known throughout the  village, but of this Andy, being a newcomer, was ignorant.
  &#8220;Wouldn't you like to hire a good strong boy?&#8221; he asked, entering  the yard.
  The deacon looked up.
  &#8220;Ever worked on a farm?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can you milk?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where did you work?&#8221;
  &#8220;In Carver.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's your name?&#8221;
  &#8220;Andy Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;
  &#8220;With my mother, Mrs. Burke, a little way down the road.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know&#8212;the Widder Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you got any work for me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Wait a minute, I'll see.&#8221;
  The deacon brought out an old scythe from the barn, and felt of the  edge. There was not much danger in so doing, for it was as dull as a  hoe.
  &#8220;This scythe needs sharpening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come and turn the  grindstone.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, here's a job, anyhow,&#8221; thought Andy. &#8220;Wonder what he'll give  me.&#8221;
  He sat down and began to turn the grindstone. The deacon bore on  heavily, and this made it hard turning. His arms ached, and the  perspiration stood on his brow. It was certainly pretty hard work, but  then he must be prepared for that, and after all he was earning money  for his mother. Still the time did seem long. The scythe was so  intolerably dull that it took a long time to make any impression upon  it.
  &#8220;Kinder hard turnin', ain't it?&#8221; said the deacon.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;This scythe ain't been sharpened for ever so long. It's as dull as  a hoe.&#8221;
  However, time and patience work wonders, and at length the deacon,  after a careful inspection of the blade of the scythe, released Andy  from his toil of an hour and a half, with the remark:
  &#8220;I reckon that'll do.&#8221;
  He put the scythe in its place and came out.
  Andy lingered respectfully for the remuneration of his labor.
  &#8220;He ought to give me a quarter,&#8221; he thought. But the deacon showed  no disposition to pay him, and Andy became impatient.
  &#8220;I guess I'll be goin',&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;All right. I ain't got anything more for you to do,&#8221; said the  deacon.
  &#8220;I'll take my pay now,&#8221; said Andy, desperately.
  &#8220;Pay? What for?&#8221; inquired the deacon, innocently.
  &#8220;For turning the grindstone.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't mean ter say you expect anything for that?&#8221; said the  deacon in a tone of surprise.
  &#8220;Yes I do,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;I can't work an hour and a half for  nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't expect to pay for such a trifle,&#8221; said the old man,  fumbling in his pocket.
  Finally he brought out two cents, one of the kind popularly known as  bung-towns, which are not generally recognized as true currency.
  &#8220;There,&#8221; said he in an injured tone. &#8220;I'll pay you, though I didn't  think you'd charge anything for any little help like that.&#8221;
  Andy looked at the proffered compensation with mingled astonishment  and disgust.
  &#8220;Never mind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can keep it. You need it more'n I do,  I'm thinkin'!&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you want it?&#8221; asked the deacon, surprised.
  &#8220;No, I don't. I'm a poor boy, but I don't work an hour and a half  for two cents, one of 'em bad. I'd rather take no pay at all.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a cur'us boy,&#8221; said the deacon, slowly sliding the pennies  back into his pocket. &#8220;I calc'late he expected more just for a little  job like that. Does he think I'm made of money?&#8221;
  As Andy went out of the yard, the idea dawned upon the deacon that  he had saved two cents, and his face was luminous with satisfaction.
