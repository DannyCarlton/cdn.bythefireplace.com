Lennox, Willet and Tayoga fell asleep, one by one, and the Onondaga was  the last to close his eyes. Then the three, wrapped in their blankets,  lay in complete darkness on the stone shelf, with the canoe beside them.  They were no more than the point of a pin in the vast wilderness that  stretched unknown thousands of miles from the Hudson to the Pacific,  apparently as lost to the world as the sleepers in a cave ages earlier,  when the whole earth was dark with forest and desert.    
Although the storm could not reach them it beat heavily for long hours  while they slept. The sweep of the rain maintained a continuous driving  sound. Boughs cracked and broke beneath it. The waters of the river,  swollen by the floods of tributary creeks and brooks, rose fast, bearing  upon their angry surface the wreckage of trees, but they did not reach  the stone shelf upon which the travelers lay.    
Tayoga awoke before the morning, while it was yet so dark that his  trained eyes could see but dimly the figures of his comrades. He sat up  and listened, knowing that he must depend for warning upon his hearing,  which had been trained to extreme acuteness by the needs of forest  life. All three of them were great wilderness trailers and scouts, but  Tayoga was the first of the three. Back of him lay untold generations  that had been compelled to depend upon the physical senses and the  intuition that comes from their uttermost development and co-ordination.  Now, Tayoga, the product of all those who had gone before, was also  their finest flower.    
He had listened at first, resting on his elbow, but after a minute or  two he sat up. He heard the rushing of the rain, the crack of  splintering boughs, the flowing of the rising river, and the gurgling of  its waters as they lapped against the stone shelf. They would not enter  it he knew, as he had observed that the highest marks of the floods lay  below them.    
The sounds made by the rain and the river were steady and unchanged. But  the intuition that came from the harmonious working of senses, developed  to a marvelous degree, sounded a warning note. A danger threatened. He  did not know what the danger was nor whence it would come, but the soul  of the Onondaga was alive and every nerve and muscle in his body was  attuned for any task that might lie before him. He looked at his  sleeping comrades. They did not stir, and their long, regular breathing  told him that no sinister threat was coming to them.    
But Tayoga never doubted. The silent and invisible warning, like a  modern wireless current, reached him again. Now, he knelt at the very  edge of the shelf, and drew his long hunting knife. He tried to pierce  the darkness with his eyes, and always he looked up the stream in the  direction in which they had come. He strained his ears too to the  utmost, concentrating the full powers of his hearing upon the river, but  the only sounds that reached him were the flowing of the current, the  bubbling of the water at the edges, and its lapping against a tree or  bush torn up by the storm and floating on the surface of the stream.    
The Onondaga stepped from the shelf, finding a place for his feet in  crevices below, the water rising almost to his knees, and leaned farther  forward to listen. One hand held firmly to a projection of stone above  and the other clasped the knife.    
Tayoga maintained the intense concentration of his faculties, as if he  had drawn them together in an actual physical way, until they bore upon  one point, and he poured so much strength and vitality into them that he  made the darkness thin away before his eyes and he heard noises of the  water that had not come to him before.    
A broken bough, a bush and a sapling washed past. Then came a tree, and  deflecting somewhat from the current it floated toward the shelf.  Leaning far over and extending the hand that held the knife, Tayoga  struck. When the blade came back it was red and the young Onondaga  uttered a tremendous war whoop that rang and echoed in the confines of  the stony hollow.    
Lennox and Willet sprang to their feet, all sleep driven away at once,  and instinctively grasped their rifles.    
"What is it, Tayoga?" exclaimed the startled Willet.    
"The attack of the savage warriors," replied the Onondaga. "One came  floating on a tree. He thought to slay us as we slept and take away our  scalps, but the river that brought him living has borne him away dead."    
"And so they know we're here," said the hunter, "and your watchfulness  has saved us. Well, Tayoga, it's one more deed for which we have to  thank you, but I think you'd better get back on the shelf. They can fire  from the other side, farther up, and although it would be at random, a  bullet or two might strike here."    
The Onondaga swung himself back and all three flattened themselves  against the rock. After Tayoga's triumphant shout there was no sound  save those of the river and the rain. But Robert expected it. He knew  the horde would be quiet for a while, hoping for a surprise the second  time after the first one had failed.    
"It was bold," he said, "for a single warrior to come floating down the  stream in search of us."    
"But it would have succeeded if Tayoga hadn't been awake," said the  hunter. "One warrior could have knifed us all at his leisure."    
"Where do you think they are now?"    
"They must be crouched in the shelter of rocks. If they had nothing over  them the storm would take the fighting spirit for the time out of  savages, even wild for scalps. I'm mighty glad we have the canoe. It  holds the food we need for a siege, and if the chance for escape comes  it will bear us away. I think, Tayoga, I can see a figure stirring  among the boulders on the other side farther up."    
"I see two," said the Onondaga, "and doubtless there are others whom we  cannot see. Keep close, my friends, I think they are going to fire."    
A dozen rifles were discharged from a point about a hundred yards away,  the exploding powder making red dots in the darkness, the bullets  rattling on the stone cliff or sending up little spurts of water from  the river. The volley was followed by a shrill, fierce war whoop, and  then nothing was heard but the flowing of the river and the rushing of  the rain.    
"You are not touched?" said Tayoga, and Robert and Willet quickly  answered in the negative.    
"They don't know just which way to aim their guns," said Willet, "and so  long as we keep quiet now they won't learn. That shout of yours, Tayoga,  was not enough to tell them."    
"But they must remember about where the hollow is, although they can't  pull trigger directly upon it, owing to the darkness and storm," said  Robert.    
"That about sums it up, my boy," said the hunter. "If they do a lot of  random firing the chances are about a hundred to one they won't hit us,  and the Indians don't have enough ammunition to waste that way."    
"I don't suppose we can launch the canoe and slip away in it?"    
"No, it would be swamped by the rain and the flood. It's likely, too,  that they're on watch for us farther down the stream."    
"Then this is our home and fortress for an indefinite time, and, that  being the case, I'm going to make myself as easy as I can."    
He drew the blanket under his body again and lay on his elbow, but he  held his rifle before him, ready for battle at an instant's notice. His  feeling of comfort returned and with it the sense of safety. The bullets  of the savages had gone so wild and the darkness was so deep that their  shelter appeared to him truly as a fortress which no numbers of  besiegers could storm.    
"Do you think they'll try floating down the stream on trees or logs  again, Tayoga?" he asked.    
"No, the danger is too great," replied the Onondaga. "They know now that  we're watching."    
An hour passed without any further sign from the foe. The rain decreased  somewhat in violence, but, as the wind rose, its rush and sweep made as  much sound as ever. Then the waiting was broken by scattering shots,  accompanied by detached war whoops, as if different bands were near.  From their shelter they watched the red dots that marked the discharges  from the rifles, but only one bullet came near them, and after chipping  a piece of stone over their heads it dropped harmlessly to the floor.    
"That was the one chance out of a hundred," said Willet, "and now we're  safe from the next ninety-nine bullets."    
"I trust the rule will work," said Robert.    
"I wish you'd hold my left hand in a firm grip," said Willet.    
"I will, but why?" returned the youth.    
"If I get a chance I'm going to drag up some of that dead and floating  wood and lay it along the edge of the shelf. In the dark the savages  can't pick us off, but we'll need a barrier in the morning."    
"You're right, Dave, of course. I'm sorry I didn't think of it myself."    
"One of us thought of it, and that's enough. Hold my hand hard, Robert.  Don't let your grip slip."    
By patient waiting and help from the others Willet was able to draw up  two logs of fair size, and some smaller pieces which they placed  carefully on the edge of the stone shelf. Lying flat behind them, they  would be almost hidden, and now they could await the coming of daylight  with more serenity.    
A long time passed. The three ate strips of the deer meat, and Robert  even slept for a short while. He awoke to find a further decrease in the  rain, although the river was still rising, and Tayoga and Willet were of  the opinion that it would stop soon, a belief that was justified in an  hour. Robert soon afterward saw the clouds move away, and disclose a  strip of dark blue sky, into which the stars began to come one by one.    
"The night will grow light soon," said Tayoga, "then it will darken  again for a little time before the coming of the day."    
"And we've built our breastwork none too soon," said Willet. "There'll  be so many stars by and by that those fellows can pick out our place and  send their bullets to it. What do you think, Tayoga? Is it just a band  taking the chance to get some scalps, or are they sent out by the  Governor General of Canada to do wicked work in the forest and then be  disowned if need be?"    
"I cannot tell," replied the Onondaga. "Much goes on in the land of  Onontio at Stadacona (Quebec). He talks long in whispers with the  northern chiefs, and often he does not let his left ear know what the  right ear hears. Onontio moves in the night, while Corlear sleeps."    
"That may be so, Tayoga, but whether it's so or not I like our  straightforward English and American way best. We may blunder along for  a while and lose at first, but to be open and honest is to be strong."    
"I did not say the ways of Corlear would prevail. It is not the talk of  Corlear that will keep the Hodenosaunee faithful to the English side,  but it is the knowledge of the fifty sachems that when Onontio is  speaking in a voice of honey he is to be trusted the least."    
Willet laughed.    
"I understand, Tayoga," he said. "You're for us not because you have so  much faith in Corlear, but because you have less in Onontio. Well, it's  a good enough reason, I suppose. But all Frenchmen are not tricksters.  Most of 'em are brave, and when they're friends they're good and true.  About all I've got to say against 'em is that they're willing to shut  their eyes to the terrible things their allies do in their name. But  I've had a lot to do with 'em on the border, and you can get to like  'em. Now, that St. Luc we met was a fine upstanding man."    
"But if an enemy, an enemy to be dreaded," said Tayoga with his usual  gravity.    
"I wouldn't mind that if it came to war. In such cases the best men make  the best enemies, I suppose. He had a sharp eye. I could see how he  measured us, and reckoned us up, but he looked most at Robert here."    
"His sharp eye recognized that I was the most important of the three,"  said Robert lightly.    
"Every fellow is mighty important to himself," said Willet, "and he  can't get away from it. Tayoga, do you think you see figures moving on  the other bank there, up the stream?"    
"Two certainly, others perhaps, Great Bear," replied the Onondaga. "I  might reach one with my rifle."    
"Don't try it, Tayoga. We're on the defense, and we'll let 'em make all  the beginnings. The sooner they shoot away their ammunition the better  it will be for us. I think they'll open fire pretty soon now, because  the night is growing uncommon bright. The stars are so big and shining,  and there are so many of them they all look as if they had come to a  party. Flatten yourselves down, boys! I can see a figure kneeling by a  bowlder and that means one shot, if not more."    
They lay close and Robert was very thankful now for the logs they had  dragged up from the water, as they afforded almost complete shelter. The  crouching warrior farther up the stream fired, and his bullet struck the  hollow above their heads.    
"A better aim than they often show," said Willet.    
More shots were fired, and one buried itself in the log in front of  Robert. He heard the thud made by the bullet as it entered, and once  more he was thankful for their rude breastwork. But it was the only one  that struck so close and presently the savages ceased their fire,  although the besieged three were still able to see them in the brilliant  moonlight among the bowlders.    
"They're getting a bit too insolent," said the hunter. "Maybe they think  it's a shorter distance from them to us than it is from us to them, and  that our bullets would drop before they got to 'em. I think, Tayoga,  I'll prove that it's not so."    
"Choose the man at the edge of the water," said Tayoga. "He has fired  three shots at us, and we should give him at least one in return."    
"I'll pay the debt, Tayoga."    
Robert saw the warrior, his head and shoulders and painted chest  appearing above the stone. The distance was great for accuracy, but the  light was brilliant, and the rifle of the hunter rose to his shoulder.  The muzzle bore directly upon the naked chest, and when Willet pulled  the trigger a stream of fire spurted from the weapon.    
The savage uttered a cry, shot forward and fell into the stream. His  lifeless body tossed like dead wood on the swift current, reappeared and  floated by the little fortress of the three. Robert shuddered as he saw  the savage face again, and then he saw it no more.    
The savages uttered a shout of grief and rage over the loss of the  warrior, but the besieged were silent. Willet, as he reloaded his rifle,  gave it an affectionate little pat or two.    
"It's a good weapon," he said, "and with a fair light I was sure I  wouldn't miss. We've given 'em fair warning that they've got a nest of  panthers here to deal with, and that when they attack they're taking  risks. Can you see any of 'em now, Tayoga?"    
"All have taken to cover. There is not one among them who is willing to  face again the rifle of the Great Bear."    
Willet smiled with satisfaction at the compliment. He was proud of his  sharp-shooting, and justly so, but he said modestly:    
"I had a fair target, and it will do for a warning. I think we can look  for another long rest now."    
The dark period that precedes the dawn came, and then the morning  flashed over the woods. Robert, from the hollow, looking across the far  shore, saw lofty, wooded hills and back of them blue mountains. Beads of  rain stood on the leaves, and the wilderness seemed to emerge, fresh and  dripping, from a glorious bath. Pleasant odors of the wild came to him,  and now he felt the sting of imprisonment there among the rocks. He  wished they could go at once on their errand. It was a most unfortunate  chance to have been found there by the Indians and to be held  indefinitely in siege. The flooded river would have borne them swiftly  in their canoe toward the St. Lawrence.    
"Mourning, Robert?" said Willet who noticed his face.    
"For the moment, yes," admitted young Lennox, "but it has passed. I  wanted to be going on this lively river and through the green wood, but  since I have to wait I can do it."    
"I feel the same way about it, and we're lucky to have such a fort as  the one we are in. I think the savages will hang on here for a long  while. Indians always have plenty of time. That's why they're more  patient than white men. Like as not we won't get a peep out of them all  the morning."    
"Lennox feels the beauty of the day," said Tayoga, "and that's why he  wants to leave the hollow and go into the woods. But if Lennox will only  think he'll know that other days as fine will come."    
The eye of the young Onondaga twinkled as he delivered his jesting  advice.    
"I'll be as patient as I can," replied Robert in the same tone, "but  tomorrow is never as good as today. I wait like you and Dave only  because I have to do so."    
"In the woods you must do as the people who live there do," said the  hunter philosophically. "They learn how to wait when they're young. We  don't know how long we'll be here. A little more of the deer, Tayoga.  It's close to the middle of the day now and we must keep our strength. I  wish we had better water than that of a flooded and muddy river to  drink, but it's water, anyhow."    
They ate, drank and refreshed themselves and another long period of  inaction followed. The warriors--at intervals--fired a few shots but  they did no damage. Only one entered the hollow, and it buried itself  harmlessly in their wooden barrier. They suffered from nothing except  the soreness and stiffness that came from lying almost flat and so long  in one position. The afternoon, cloudless and brilliant, waned, and the  air in the recess grew warm and heavy. Had it not been for the necessity  of keeping guard Robert could have gone to sleep again. The flood in the  river passed its zenith and was now sinking visibly. No more trees or  bushes came floating on the water. Willet showed disappointment over the  failure of the besiegers to make any decided movement.    
"I was telling you, Robert, a while ago," he said, "that Indians mostly  have a lot of time, but I'm afraid the band that's cornered us here has  got too much. They may send out a warrior or two to hunt, and the others  may sit at a distance and wait a week for us to come out. At least it  looks that way to a 'possum up a tree. What do you think of it, Tayoga?"    
"The Great Bear is right," replied the Onondaga. "He is always right  when he is not wrong."    
"Come now, Tayoga, are you making game of me?"    
"Not so, my brother, because the Great Bear is nearly always right and  very seldom wrong. It is given only to Manitou never to be wrong."    
"That's better, Tayoga. If I can keep up a high average of accuracy I'm  satisfied."    
Tayoga's English was always precise and a trifle bookish, like that of a  man speaking a language he has learned in a school, which in truth was  the case with the Onondaga. Like the celebrated Thayendanegea, the  Mohawk, otherwise known as Joseph Brant, he had been sent to a white  school and he had learned the English of the grammarian. Willet too  spoke in a manner much superior to that of the usual scout and hunter.    
"If the Indians post lines out of range and merely maintain a watch what  will we do?" asked Robert. "I, for one, don't want to stay here  indefinitely."    
"Nor do any of us," replied Willet. "We ought to be moving. A long delay  here won't help us. We've got to think of something."    
The two, actuated by the same impulse, looked at Tayoga. He was very  thoughtful and presently glanced up at the heavens.    
"What does the Great Bear think of the sky?" he asked.    
"I think it's a fine sky, Tayoga," Willet replied with a humorous  inflection. "But I've always admired it, whether it's blue or gray or  just black, spangled with stars."    
Tayoga smiled.    
"What does the Great Bear think of the sky?" he repeated. "Do the signs  say to him that the coming night will be dark like the one that has just  gone before?"    
"They say it will be dark, Tayoga, but I don't believe we'll have the  rain again."    
"We do not want the rain, but we do want the dark. Tonight when the moon  and stars fail to come we must leave the hollow."    
"By what way, Tayoga?"    
The Onondaga pointed to the river.    
"We have the canoe," he said.    
"But if they should hear or see us we'd make a fine target in it," said  Robert.    
"We won't be in it," said the Onondaga, "although our weapons and  clothes will."    
"Ah, I understand! We're to launch the canoe, put in it everything  including our clothes, except ourselves, and swim by the side of it.  Three good swimmers are we, Tayoga, and I believe we can do it."    
The Onondaga looked at Willet, who nodded his approval.    
"The chances will favor us, and we'd better try it," he said, "that is,  if the night is dark, as I think it will be."    
"Then it is agreed," said Robert.    
"It is so," said Tayoga.    
No more words were needed, and they strengthened their hearts for the  daring attempt, waiting patiently for the afternoon to wane and die into  the night, which, arrived moonless and starless and heavy with dark, as  they had hoped and predicted. Just before, a little spasmodic firing  came from the besiegers, but they did not deign to answer. Instead they  waited patiently until the night was far advanced and then they prepared  quickly for running the gauntlet, a task that would require the greatest  skill, courage and presence of mind. Robert's heart beat hard. Like the  others he was weary of the friendly hollow that had served them so well,  and the murmuring of the river, as it flowed, invited them to come on  and use it as the road of escape.    
The three took off all their clothing and disposed everything carefully  in the canoe, laying the rifles on top where they could be reached with  a single swift movement of the arm. Then they stared up and down the  stream, and listened with all their powers of hearing. No savage was to  be seen nor did anyone make a sound that reached the three, although  Robert knew they lay behind the rocks not so very far away.    
"They're not stirring, Tayoga," whispered the hunter. "Perhaps they  think we don't dare try the river, and in this case as in most others  the boldest way is the best. Take the other end of the canoe, and we'll  lift it down gently."    
He and the Onondaga lowered the canoe so slowly that it made no splash  when it took the water, and then the three lowered themselves in turn,  sinking into the stream to their throats.    
"Keep close to the bank," whispered the hunter, "and whatever you do  don't make any splash as you swim."    
The three were on the side of the craft next to the cliff and their  heads did not appear above its side. Then the canoe moved down the  stream at just about the speed of the current, and no human hands  appeared, nor was any human agency visible. It was just a wandering  little boat, set adrift upon the wilderness waters, a light shell, but  with an explorer's soul. It moved casually along, keeping nearest to the  cliff, the safest place for so frail a structure, hesitating two or  three times at points of rocks, but always making up its mind to go on  once more, and see where this fine but strange river led.    
Luckily it was very dark by the cliff. The shadows fell there like black  blankets, and no eye yet rested upon the questing canoe which kept its  way, idly exploring the reaches of the river. Gasna Gaowo, this bark  canoe of red elm, was not large, but it was a noble specimen of its  kind, a forest product of Onondaga patience and skill. On either side  near the prow was painted in scarlet a great eagle's eye, and now the  two large red eyes of the canoe gazed ahead into the darkness, seeking  to pierce the unknown.    
The canoe went on with a gentle, rocking motion made by the current,  strayed now and then a little way from the cliff, but always came back  to it. The pair of great red eyes stared at the cliff so close and at  the other cliff farther away and at the middle of the stream, which was  now tranquil and unruffled by the wreckage of the forest blown into the  water by the storm. The canoe also looked into one or two little coves,  and seeing nothing there but the river edge bubbling against the stone,  went on, came to a curve, rounded it in an easy, sauntering but skillful  fashion, and entered a straight reach of the stream.    
So far the canoe was having a lone and untroubled journey. The river  widening now and flowing between descending banks was wholly its own,  but clinging to the habit it had formed when it started it still hung to  the western bank. The night grew more and more favorable to the  undiscovered voyage it wished to make. Masses of clouds gathered and  hovered over that particular river, as if they had some especial object  in doing so, and they made the night so dark that the red eyes of the  canoe, great in size though they were, could see but a little way down  the stream. Yet it kept on boldly and there was a purpose in its course.  Often it seemed to be on the point of recklessly running against the  rocky shore, but always it sheered off in time, and though its advance  was apparently casual it was moving down the stream at a great rate.    
The canoe had gone fully four hundred yards when an Abenaki warrior on  the far side of the river caught a glimpse of a shadow moving in the  shadow of the bank, and a sustained gaze soon showed to him that it was  a canoe, and, in his opinion, a derelict, washed by the flood from some  camp a long distance up the stream. He watched it for a little while,  and was then confirmed in his opinion by its motion as it floated lazily  with the current.    
The darkness was not too great to keep the Abenaki from seeing that it  was a good canoe, a fine shell of Iroquois make, and canoes were  valuable. He had not been able to secure any scalp, which was a sad  disappointment, and now Manitou had sent this stray craft to him as a  consolation prize. He was not one to decline the gifts of the gods, and  he ran along the edge of the cliff until he came to a low point well  ahead of the canoe. Then he put his rifle on the ground, dropped lightly  into the stream, and swam with swift sure strokes for the derelict.    
As the warrior approached he saw that his opinion of the canoe was more  than justified. It had been made with uncommon skill and he admired its  strong, graceful lines. It was not often that such a valuable prize came  to a man and asked to be taken. He reached it and put one hand upon the  side. Then a heavy fist stretched entirely over the canoe and struck him  such a mighty blow upon the jaw that he sank senseless, and when he  revived two minutes later on a low bank where the current had cast him,  he did not know what had happened to him.    
Meanwhile the uncaptured canoe sailed on in lonely majesty down the  stream.    
"That was a shrewd blow of yours, Dave," said Robert. "You struck fairly  upon his jaw bone."    
"It's not often that I fight an Indian with my fists, and the chance  having come I made the most of it," said the hunter. "He may have been a  sentinel set to watch for just such an attempt as we are making, but  it's likely they thought if we made a dash for it we'd be in the canoe."    
"It was great wisdom for us to swim," said Tayoga. "Another sentinel  seeing the canoe may also think it was washed away somewhere and is  merely floating on the waters. I can see a heap of underbrush that has  gathered against a projecting point, and the current would naturally  bring the canoe into it. Suppose we let it rest there until it seems to  work free by the action of the water, and then go on down the river."    
"It's a good idea, Tayoga, but it's a pretty severe test to remain under  fire, so to speak, in order to deceive your enemy, when the road is open  for you to run away."    
"But we can do it, all three of us," said Tayoga, confidently.    
A spit of high ground projected into the river and in the course of time  enough driftwood brought by the stream and lodged there had made a raft  of considerable width and depth, against which the canoe in its  wandering course lodged. But it was evident that its stay in such a port  would be but temporary, as the current continually pushed and sucked at  it, and the light craft quivered and swayed continually under the action  of the current.    
The three behind the canoe thrust themselves back into the mass of  vegetation, reckless of scratches, and were hidden completely for the  time. Since he was no longer kept warm by the act of swimming Robert  felt the chill of the water entering his bones. His physical desire to  shiver he controlled by a powerful effort of the will, and, standing on  the bottom with his head among the boughs, he remained quiet.    
None of the three spoke and in a few minutes a warrior on the other side  of the stream, watching in the bushes, saw the dim outline of the canoe  in the darkness. He came to the edge of the water and looked at it  attentively. It was apparent to him, as it had been to the other savage,  that it was a stray canoe, and valuable, a fine prize for the taking.  But he was less impulsive than the first man had been and at that point  the river spread out to a much greater width. He did not know that his  comrade was lying on the bank farther up in a half stunned condition,  but he was naturally cautious and he stared at the canoe a long time.  He saw that the action of the current would eventually work it loose  from the raft, but he believed it would yet hang there for at least ten  minutes. So he would have time to go back to his nearest comrade and  return with him. Then one could enter the water and salvage the canoe,  while the other stayed on the bank and watched. Having reached this wise  conclusion he disappeared in the woods, seeking the second Indian, but  before the two could come together the canoe had worked loose and was  gone.    
The three hidden in the bushes had watched the Indian as well as the  dusk would permit and they read his mind. They knew that when he turned  away he had gone for help and they knew equally well that it was time  for the full power of the current to take effect.    
"Shove it off, Tayoga," whispered Willet, "and I think we'd better help  along with some strokes of our own."    
"It is so," said Tayoga.    
Now the wandering canoe was suddenly endowed with more life and purpose,  or else the current grew much swifter. After an uneasy stay with the  boughs, it left them quickly, sailed out toward the middle of the  stream, and floated at great speed between banks that were growing high  again. The friendly dark was also an increasing protection to the three  who were steering it. The heavy but rainless clouds continued to gather  over them, and the canoe sped on at accelerated speed in an opaque  atmosphere. A mile farther and Willet suggested that they get into the  canoe and paddle with all their might. The embarkation, a matter of  delicacy and difficulty, was made with success, and then they used the  paddles furiously.    
The canoe, suddenly becoming a live thing, leaped forward in the water,  and sped down the stream, as if it were the leader in a race. Far behind  them rose a sudden war cry, and the three laughed.    
"I suppose they've discovered in some way that we've fled," said Robert.    
"That is so," said Tayoga.    
"And they'll come down the river as fast as they can," said Willet, "but  they'll do no more business with us. I don't want to brag, but you can't  find three better paddlers in the wilderness than we are, and with a  mile start we ought soon to leave behind any number of warriors who have  to run through the woods and follow the windings of the stream."    
"They cannot catch us now," said Tayoga, "and I will tell them so."    
He uttered a war whoop so piercing and fierce that Robert was startled.  It cut the air like the slash of a sword, but it was a long cry, full of  varied meaning. It expressed satisfaction, triumph, a taunt for the foe,  and then it died away in a sinister note like a threat for any who tried  to follow. Willet laughed under his breath.    
"That'll stir 'em, Tayoga," he said. "You put a little dart squarely in  their hearts, and they don't like it. But they can squirm as much as  they please, we're out of their reach now. Hark, they're answering!"    
They heard a cry from the savage who had besieged them, but it was  followed by a long silence. The three paddled with their utmost  strength, the great muscles on their arms rising and falling with their  exertions, and beads of perspiration standing out on their foreheads.    
Hours passed. Mile after mile fell behind them. The darkness began to  thin, and then the air was shot with golden beams from the rising sun.  Willet, heaving an immense sigh of relief, laid his paddle across the  canoe.    
"The danger has passed," he said. "Now we'll land, put on our clothes  and become respectable."
