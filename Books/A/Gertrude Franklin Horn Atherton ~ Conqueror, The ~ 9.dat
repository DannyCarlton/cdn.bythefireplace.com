Two years passed. Rachael was twenty, a beautiful and stately creature,  more discussed and less seen than any woman on the islands of Nevis and  St. Christopher. Occasionally Christiana Huggins paid her a visit, or  Catherine Hamilton rode over for the day; but although Christiana at  least, loved her to the end, both were conscious of her superiority of  mind and experience, and the old intimacy was not resumed.    
Dr. Hamilton had used all his influence in the Council to promote a  special bill of divorce, for he wanted Rachael to be free to marry  again. He had no faith in the permanent resources of the intellect for a  young and seductive woman, and he understood Rachael very thoroughly.  The calm might be long, but unless Levine died or could be legally  disposed of, she would give the Islands a heavier shock than when the  innovation of Mary Fawcett had set them gabbling. Against the  conservatism of his colleagues, however, he could make no headway, and  both the Governor and Captain-General disapproved of a measure which  England had never sanctioned.    
But Dr. Hamilton and her mother were more disturbed at the failure of  the bill than Rachael. Time had lifted the shadow of her husband from  the race, but, never having loved, even a little, her imagination  modelled no pleasing features upon the ugly skull of matrimony. It is  true that she sometimes thought of herself as a singularly lonely being,  and allowed her mind to picture love and its companionships. As time  dimmed another picture she caught herself meditating upon woman's chief  inheritance, and moving among the shadows of the future toward that  larger and vitalizing part of herself which every woman fancies is on  earth in search of her. When she returned from these wanderings she  sternly reminded herself that her name was Levine, and that no woman  after such an escape had the right to expect more. She finally compelled  herself to admit that her avoidance of society was due to prudence as  well as to her stern devotion to intellect, then studied harder than  ever.    
But it is a poor fate that waits upon the gathering together of many  people.
