When Ernest Le Breton got a letter from the business house of a  well-known publishing firm, asking him whether he would consent to  supply appropriate letterpress for an illustrated work on the poor  of London, then in course of preparation, his delight and relief  were positively unbounded. That anyone should come and ask him for  work, instead of his asking them, was in itself a singular matter  for surprise and congratulation; that the request should be based  on the avowed ground of his known political and social opinions  was almost incredible. Ernest felt that it was a triumph, not only  for him, but for his dearly-loved principles and beliefs as well.  For the first time in his life, he was going to undertake a piece  of work which he not only thought not wrong, but even considered  hopeful and praise-worthy. Arthur Berkeley, who called round as if  by accident the same morning, saw with delight that Lady Hilda's  prognostication seemed likely to be fulfilled, and that if only  Ernest could be given some congenial occupation there was still  a chance, after all, for his permanent recovery; for it was clear  enough that as there was hope, there must be a little life yet left  in him.    
It was Lady Hilda who, as she herself expressively phrased it,  had squared the publishers. She had called upon the head of the  well-known house in person, and had told him fully and frankly  exactly what was the nature of the interest she took in the poor  of London. At first the publisher was scandalised and obdurate: the  thing was not regular, he said--not in the ordinary way of business;  his firm couldn't go writing letters of that sort to unknown young  authors and artists. If she wanted the work done, she must let them  give her own name as the promoter of the undertaking. But Hilda  persevered, as she always did; she smiled, pleaded, cajoled,  threatened, and made desperate love to the publisher to gain his  acquiescence in her benevolent scheme. After all, even publishers  are only human (though authors have been frequently known to deny  the fact); and human nature, especially in England, is apt to  be very little proof against the entreaties of a pretty girl who  happens also to be an earl's daughter. So in the end, when Lady Hilda  said most bewitchingly, 'I put it upon the grounds of a personal  favour, Mr. Percival,' the obdurate publisher gave way at last,  and consented to do her bidding gladly.    
For six weeks Ernest went daily with Ronald and the young artist into  the familiar slums of Bethnal Green, and Bermondsey, and Lambeth,  whose ins and outs he was beginning to know with painful accuracy;  and every night he came back, and wrote down with a glowing pen all  that he had seen and heard of distressing and terrible during his  day's peregrination. It was an awful task from one point of view,  for the scenes he had to visit and describe were often heart-rending;  and Arthur feared more than once that the air of so many loathsome  and noxious dens might still further accelerate the progress of  Ernest's disease; but Lady Hilda said emphatically, No; and somehow  Arthur was beginning now to conceive an immense respect for the  practical value of Lady Hilda's vehement opinions. As a matter of  fact, indeed, Ernest did not visibly suffer at all either from the  unwonted hard work or from the strain upon mind and body to which  he had been so little accustomed. Distressing as it all was, it  was change, it was variety, it was occupation, it was relief from  that terrible killing round of perpetual personal responsibility.  Above all, Ernest really believed that here at last was an  opportunity of doing some practical good in his generation, and he  threw himself into it with all the passionate ardour of a naturally  eager and vivid nature. The enthusiasm of humanity was upon him, and  it kept him going at high-pressure rate, with no apparent loss of  strength and vigour throughout the whole ordeal. To Arthur Berkeley's  intense delight, he was even visibly fatter to the naked eye at the  end of his six weeks' exploration of the most dreary and desolate  slums in all London.    
The book was written at white heat, as the best of such books always  are, and it was engraved and printed at the very shortest possible  notice. Terrible and ghastly it certainly was at last--instinct  with all the grim local colouring of those narrow, squalid,  fever-stricken dens, where misfortune and crime huddle together  indiscriminately in dirt and misery--a book to make one's blood run  cold with awe and disgust, and to stir up even the callous apathy  of the great rich capitalist West End to a passing moment's  ineffective remorse; but very clever and very graphic after its  own sort beyond the shadow of a question, for all its horror. When  Arthur Berkeley turned over the first proof-sheets of 'London's  Shame,' with its simple yet thrilling recital of true tales taken  down from the very lips of outcast children or stranded women, with  its awful woodcuts and still more awful descriptions--word-pictures  reeking with the vice and filth and degradation of the most  pestilent, overcrowded, undrained tenements--he felt instinctively  that Ernest Le Breton's book would not need the artificial aid of  Lady Hilda's influential friends in order to make it successful  and even famous. The Cabinet ministers might be as silent as they  chose, the indignant duke might confine his denunciations to the  attentive and sympathetic ear of his friend Lord Connemara; but  nothing on earth could prevent Ernest Le Breton's fiery and scathing  diatribe from immediately enthralling the public attention. Lady  Hilda had hit upon the exact subject which best suited his peculiar  character and temperament, and he had done himself full justice in  it. Not that Ernest had ever thought of himself, or even of his  style, or the effect he was producing by his narrative; it was just  the very non-self-consciousness of the thing that gave it its power.  He wrote down the simple thoughts that came up into his own eager  mind at the sight of so much inequality and injustice; and the  motto that Arthur prefixed upon the title-page, 'Facit indignatio  versum,' aptly described the key-note of that fierce and angry  final denunciation. 'Yes, Lady Hilda had certainly hit the right  nail on the head,' Arthur Berkeley said to himself more than once:  'A wonderful woman, truly, that beautiful, stately, uncompromising,  brilliant, and still really tender Hilda Tregellis.'    
Hilda, on her part, worked hard and well for the success of Ernest's  book as soon as it appeared. Nay, she even condescended (not being  what Ernest himself would have described as an ethical unit) to  practise a little gentle hypocrisy in suiting her recommendations  of 'London's Shame' to the tastes and feelings of her various  acquaintances. To her Radical Cabinet minister friend, she openly  praised its outspoken zeal for the cause of the people, and its  value as a wonderful storehouse of useful facts at first hand for  political purposes in the increasingly important outlying Metropolitan  boroughs. 'Just think, Sir Edmund,' she said, persuasively, 'how  you could crush any Conservative candidate for Hackney or the Tower  Hamlets out of that awful chapter on the East End match-makers;'  while with the Duke, to whom she presented a marked copy as a  sample of what our revolutionary thinkers were really coming to,  she insisted rather upon its wicked interference with the natural  rights of landlords, and its abominable insinuation (so subversive  of all truly English ideas as to liberty and property) that they  were bound not to poison their tenants by total neglect of sanitary  precautions. 'If I were you, now,' she said to the Duke in the  most seemingly simple-minded manner possible, 'I'd just quote those  passages I've marked in pencil in the House to-night on the Small  Urban Holdings Bill, and point out how the wave of Continental  Socialism is at last invading England with its devastating flood.'  And the Duke, who was a complacent, thick-headed, obstinate old  gentleman, congenitally incapable of looking at any question from  any other point of view whatsoever except that of his own order,  fell headlong passively into Lady Hilda's cruel little trap, and  murmured to himself as he rolled down luxuriously to the august  society of his peers that evening, 'Tremendous clever girl, Hilda  Tregellis, really. "Wave of Continental Socialism at last invading  England with its what-you-may-call-it flood," she said, if I remember  rightly. Capital sentence to end off one's speech with, I declare.  Devizes'll positively wonder where I got it from. I'd no idea before  that girl took such an intelligent interest in political questions.  So they want their cottages whitewashed, do they? What'll they ask  for next, I wonder? Do they think we're to be content at last with  one and a-half per cent, upon the fee-simple value of our estates,  I should like to know? Why, some of the places this writer-fellow  talks about are on my own property in The Rookery--"one of the most  noisome court-yards in all London," he actually calls it. Whitewash  their cottages, indeed! The lazy improvident creatures! They'll  be asking us to put down encaustic tiles upon the floors next, and  to paper their walls with Japanese leather or fashionable dados.  Really, the general ignorance that prevails among the working classes  as to the clearest principles of political economy is something  absolutely appalling, absolutely appalling.' And his Grace scribbled  a note in his memorandum-book of Hilda's ready-made peroration, for  fear he should forget its precise wording before he began to give  the House the benefit of his views that night upon the political  economy of Small Urban Holdings.    
Next morning, all London was talking of the curious coincidence  by which a book from the pen of an unknown author, published only  one day previously, had been quoted and debated upon simultaneously  in both Houses of Parliament on a single evening. In the Commons,  Sir Edmund Calverley, the distinguished Radical minister, had read  a dozen pages from the unknown work in his declamatory theatrical  fashion, and had so electrified the House with its graphic and  horrible details that even Mr. Fitzgerald-Grenville, the well-known  member for the Baroness Drummond-Lloyd (whose rotten or at least  decomposing borough of Cherbury Minor he faithfully represented in  three successive Parliaments), had mumbled out a few half-inaudible  apologetic sentences about this state of things being truly  deplorable, and about the necessity for meeting such a distressing  social crisis by the prompt and vigorous application of that excellent  specific and familiar panacea, a spirited foreign policy. In the  Lords, the Duke himself, by some untoward coincidence, had been  moved to make a few quotations, accompanied by a running fire of  essentially ducal criticism, from the very selfsame obscure author;  and to his immense surprise, even the members of his own party  moved uneasily in their seats during the course of his speech; while  later in the evening, Lord Devizes muttered to him angrily in the  robing-room, 'Look here, Duke, you've been and put your foot in it,  I assure you, about that Radical book you were ill-advised enough  to quote from. You ought never to have treated the Small Urban  Holdings Bill in the way you did; and just you mark my words,  the papers'll all be down upon you to-morrow morning, as sure as  daylight. You've given the "Bystander" such an opening against  you as you'll never forget till your dying day, I can tell you.'  And as the Duke drove back again after his arduous legislative  efforts that evening, he said to himself between the puffs at his  Havana, 'This comes, now, of allowing oneself to be made a fool  of by a handsome woman. How the dooce I could ever have gone and  taken Hilda Tregellis's advice on a political question is really  more than I can fathom:--and at my time of life too! And yet, all  the same, there's no denying that she's a devilish fine woman, by  Jove, if ever there was one.'    
Of course, everybody asked themselves next day what this book  'London's Shame' was like, and who on earth its author could be;  so much so, indeed, that a large edition was completely exhausted  within a fortnight. It was the great sensational success of that  London season. Everybody read it, discussed it, dissected it,  corroborated it, refuted it, fought over it, and wrote lengthy  letters to all the daily papers about its faults and its merits.  Imitators added their sincerest flattery: rivals proclaimed themselves  the original discoverers of 'London's Shame': one enterprising author  even thought of going to law about it as a question of copyright.  Owners of noisome lanes in the East End trembled in their shoes,  and sent their agents to inquire into the precise degree of squalor  to be found in the filthy courts and alleys where they didn't care  to trust their own sensitive aristocratic noses. It even seemed as  if a little real good was going to come at last out of Ernest Le  Breton's impassioned pleading--as if the sensation were going to  fall not quite flat at the end of its short run in the clubs and  drawing-rooms of London as a nine days' wonder.    
And Ernest Le Breton? and Edie? In the little lodgings at Holloway,  they sat first trembling for the result, and ready to burst with  excitement when Lady Hilda, up at the unwonted hour of six in the  morning, tore into their rooms with an early copy of the 'Times'  to show them the Duke's speech, and Sir Edmund's quotations, and  the editorial leader in which even that most dignified and reticent  of British journals condescended to speak with studiously moderated  praise of the immense collection of facts so ably strung together  by Mr. Ernest Le Breton (in all the legible glory of small capitals,  too,) as to the undoubtedly disgraceful condition of some at  least among our London alleys. How Edie clung around Lady Hilda  and kissed her! and how Lady Hilda kissed her back and cried over  her with tears of happier augury! and how they both kissed and  cried over unconscious wondering little Dot! And how Lady Hilda  could almost have fallen upon Ernest, too, as he sat gazing in  blank astonishment and delight at his own name in the magnificent  small capitals of a 'Times' leader. Between crying and laughing,  with much efficient aid in both from good Mrs. Halliss, they hardly  knew how they ever got through the long delightful hours of that  memorable epoch-making morning.    
And then there came the gradual awakening to the fact that this  was really fame--fame, and perhaps also competence. First in the  field, of course, was the editor of the 'Cosmopolitan Review,'  with a polite request that Ernest would give the readers of that  intensely hot-and-hot and thoughtful periodical the opportunity of  reading his valuable views on the East End outcast question, before  they had had time to be worth nothing for journalistic purposes,  through the natural and inevitable cooling of the public interest  in this new sensation. Then his old friends of the 'Morning  Intelligence' once more begged that he would be good enough to  contribute a series of signed and headed articles to their columns,  on the slums and fever dens of poverty-stricken London. Next,  an illustrated weekly asked him to join with his artist friend in  getting up another pilgrimage into yet undiscovered metropolitan  plague-spots. And so, before the end of a month, Ernest Le Breton,  for the first time in his life, had really got more work to do  than he could easily manage, and work, too, that he felt he could  throw his whole life and soul into with perfect honesty.    
When the first edition of 'London's Shame' was exhausted, there  was already a handsome balance to go to Ernest and his artist  coadjutor, who, by the terms of the agreement, were to divide  between them half the profits. The other half, for appearance'  sake, Lady Hilda and Arthur had been naturally compelled to reserve  for themselves: for of course it would not have been probable that  any publisher would have undertaken the work without any hope of  profit in any way. Arthur called upon Hilda at Lord Exmoor's house  in Wilton Place to show her the first balance-sheet and accompanying  cheque. 'What on earth can we do with it?' he asked seriously. 'We  can't divide it between us: and yet we can't give it to the poor  Le Bretons. I don't see how we're to manage.'    
'Why, of course,' Hilda answered promptly. 'Put it into the Consols  or whatever you call it, for the benefit of little Dot.'    
'The very thing!' Arthur answered in a tone of obvious admiration.  'What a wonderfully practical person you really are, Lady Hilda.'    
As to Ernest and Edie, when they got their own cheque for their  quarter of the proceeds, they gazed in awe and astonishment at the  bigness of the figure; and then they sat down and cried together  like two children, with their hands locked in one another's.    
'And you'll get well, now, Ernest dear,' Edie whispered gently.  'Why, you're ever so much fatter, darling, already. I'm sure you'll  get well in no time, now, Ernest.'    
'Upon my word, Edie,' Ernest answered, kissing her white forehead  tenderly, 'I really and truly believe I shall. It's my opinion  that Sir Antony Wraxall's an unmitigated ignorant humbug.'    
A few weeks later, when Ernest's remarkable article on 'How to Improve  the Homes of the Poor' appeared in one of the leading magazines,  Mr. Herbert Le Breton of the Education Office looked up from his  cup of post-prandial coffee in his comfortable dining-room at South  Kensington, and said musingly to his young wife, 'Do you know,  Ethel, it seems to me that my brother Ernest's going to score a  success at last with this slum-hunting business that he's lately  invented. There's an awful lot about it now in all the papers  and reviews. Perhaps it might be as well, after all, to scrape an  acquaintance with him again, especially as he's my own brother.  There's no knowing, really, when a man of his peculiar ill-regulated  mercurial temperament may be going to turn out famous. Don't you  think you'd better find out where they're living now--they've left  Holloway, no doubt, since this turn of the tide--and go and call  upon Mrs. Ernest?'    
Whereto Mrs. Herbert Le Breton, raising her eyes for a moment from  the pages of her last new novel, answered languidly: 'Don't you  think, Herbert, it'd be better to wait a little while and see how  things turn out with them in the long run, you know, before we  commit ourselves by going to call upon them? One swallow, you see,  doesn't make a summer, does it, dear, ever?' Whence the acute and  intelligent reader will doubtless conclude that Mrs. Herbert Le  Breton was a very prudent sensible young woman, and that perhaps  even Herbert himself had met at last with his fitting Nemesis. For  what worse purgatory could his bitterest foe wish for a selfishly  prudent and cold-hearted man, than that he should pass his whole  lifetime in congenial intercourse with a selfishly prudent and  cold-hearted wife, exactly after his own pattern?
