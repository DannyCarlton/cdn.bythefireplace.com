  Not until the silken flap of the tent had fallen behind Jeanne did   power of movement and speech return to Philip. He called her name  and  straggled to a sitting posture. Then he staggered to his feet.  He  could scarcely stand. Shooting pains passed like flashes of   electricity through his body. His right arm was numb and stiff,  and  he found that it was thickly bandaged. His head ached, his  legs could  hardly support him. He went to raise his left hand to  his head, but  stopped it in front of him, while a slow smile of  understanding crept  over his face. It was swollen and covered with  livid bruises. He  wondered if his body looked that way, and sank  down exhausted upon his  balsam bed. A minute later Pierre returned  with a cup of broth in his  hand. 
  Philip looked at him with less feverish eyes now. There was an   unaccountable change in the half-breed's appearance, as there had   been in Jeanne's. His face seemed thinner. There was a deep gloom  in  his eyes, a dejected droop to his shoulders. Philip accepted  the  broth, and drank it slowly, without speaking. He felt  strengthened.  Then he looked steadily at Pierre. The old pride had  fallen from  Pierre like a mask. His eyes dropped under Philip's  gaze. 
  Philip held up a hand. 
  &quot;Pierre!&quot; 
  The half-breed grasped it and waited. His lips tightened. 
  &quot;What is the matter?&quot; demanded Philip. &quot;What has happened to   Jeanne? You say she was not hurt&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;By the rocks, M'sieur,&quot; interrupted Pierre, quickly, kneeling   beside Philip. &quot;Listen. It is best that I tell you. You are a man,   you will understand, without being told all. From Churchill I  brought  news which it was necessary for me to tell Jeanne. It was  terrible  news, and she is distressed under its weight. Your honor  will not  allow you to inquire further, M'sieur. I can tell you no  more than  this&#8212;that it is a grief which belongs to but one person  on  earth&#8212;herself. I ask you to help me. Be blind to her  unhappiness,  M'sieur. Believe that it is the distress of the peril  through which  she has passed. A little later I will tell you all,  and you will  understand. But it is impossible now. I confide this  much in you&#8212;I  ask you this&#8212;because&#8212;&quot; 
  Pierre's eyes were half closed, and he looked as though unseeing   over Philip's head. 
  &quot;I ask you this,&quot; he repeated, softly, &quot;because I have guessed&#8212;   that you love her.&quot; 
  A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips. 
  &quot;I do, Pierre&#8212;I do&#8212;I do&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I have guessed it,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;You will help me&#8212;to save her!&quot; 
  &quot;Until death!&quot; 
  &quot;Then you will go with us to Fort o' God, and from there you will   go at once to your camp on Blind Indian Lake.&quot; 
  Philip felt the sweat breaking out over his face. He was still   weak. His voice was unnatural, and trembled. 
  &quot;You know&#8212;&quot; he gasped. 
  &quot;Yes, I know, M'sieur,&quot; replied Pierre. &quot;I know that you are in   charge there, and Jeanne knows. We knew who you were before we   appointed to meet you on the cliff. You must return to your men.&quot; 
  Philip was silent. For the moment every hope was crushed within   him. 
  He looked at Pierre. The half-breed's eyes were glowing, his   haggard cheeks were flushed. 
  &quot;And this is necessary?&quot; 
  &quot;It is absolutely necessary, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I will go. But first, Pierre, I must know a little more. I   cannot go entirely blind. Do they fear my men&#8212;at Fort o' God?&quot; 
  &quot;No, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;One more question, Pierre. Who is Lord Fitzhugh Lee?&quot; 
  For an instant Pierre's eyes widened. They grew black, and burned   with a strange, threatening fire. He rose slowly to his feet, and   placed both hands upon Philip's shoulders. For a full minute the  two  men stared into each other's face. Then Pierre spoke. His  voice was  soft and low, scarcely above a murmur, but it was filled  with  something that struck a chill to Philip's heart. 
  &quot;I would kill you before I would answer that question, M'sieur,&quot;   he said. &quot;No other person has ever done for Jeanne and I what you   have done. We owe you more than we can ever repay. Yet if you  insist  upon an answer to that question you make of me an enemy; if  you  breathe that name to Jeanne, you turn her away from you  forever.&quot; 
  Without another word he left the tent. 
  For many minutes Philip sat motionless where Pierre had left him.   The earth seemed suddenly to have dropped from under his feet,   leaving him in an illimitable chaos of mind. Gregson had deserted   him, with almost no word of explanation, and he would have staked  his  life upon Gregson's loyalty. Under other circumstances his   unaccountable action would have been a serious blow. But now it  was  overshadowed by the mysterious change that had come over  Jeanne. A few  hours before she had been happy, laughing and  singing as they drew  nearer to Fort o' God; each hour had added to  the brightness of her  eyes, the gladness in her voice. The change  had come with Pierre. and  at the bottom of it all was Lord  Fitzhugh Lee. Pierre had warned him  not to mention Lord Fitzhugh's  name to Jeanne, and yet only a short  time before he had spoken the  name boldly before Jeanne, and she had  betrayed no sign of  recognition or of fear. More than that, she had  assured him that  she had never heard the name before, that it was not  known at Fort  o' God. 
  Philip bowed his head in his hands, and his fingers clutched in   his hair. What did it all mean? He went back to the scene on the   cliff, when Pierre had roused himself at the sound of the name; he   thought of all that had happened since Gregson had come to  Churchill,  and the result was a delirium of thought that made his  temples throb.  He was sure&#8212;now&#8212;of but few things. He loved  Jeanne&#8212;loved her more  than he had ever dreamed that he could love  a woman, and he believed  that it would be impossible for her to  tell him a falsehood. He was  confident that she had never heard of  Lord Fitzhugh until Pierre  overtook them in their flight from  Churchill. He could see but one  thing to do, and that was to  follow Pierre's advice, accepting his  promise that in the end  everything would come out right. He had faith  in Pierre. 
  He rose to his feet and went to the tent-flap. An embarrassing   thought came to him, and he stopped, a flush of feverish color   suddenly mounting into his pale cheeks. He had kissed Jeanne in  the  chasm, when death thundered in their faces. He had kissed her  again  and again, and in those kisses he had declared his love. He  was glad,  and yet sorry; the knowledge that she must know of his  love filled him  with happiness, and yet with it there was the  feeling that it would  place a distance between him and Jeanne. 
  Jeanne was the first to see him when he came out of the tent. She   was sitting beside a small balsam shelter, and Pierre was busy  over a  fire, with his back turned to them. For a moment the two  looked at  each other in silence, and then Jeanne came toward him,  holding out  one of her hands. He saw that she was making a strong  effort to appear  natural, but there was something in his own face  that made her attempt  a poor one. The hand that she gave him  trembled. Her lips quivered.  For the first time her eyes failed to  meet his own in their limpid  frankness. 
  &quot;Pierre has told you what happened,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a miracle,   and I owe you my life. I have had my punishment for being so   careless.&quot; She tried to laugh at him now, and drew her hand away.  &quot;I  wasn't beaten against the rocks, like you, but&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;It was terrible,&quot; interrupted Philip, remembering Pierre's words,   and eager to put her at ease. &quot;You have stood up under it   beautifully. I am afraid of after effects. You must not collapse   under the strain now.&quot; 
  Pierre heard his last words and a smile flashed over his dark face   as he encountered Philip's glance. 
  &quot;It is true, M'sieur,&quot; he said. &quot;I know of no other woman who   would have stood up under such a thing as Jeanne has done. MON  DIEU,  when I found a part of the canoe wreckage far below I  thought that  both of you were dead!&quot; 
  Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his   strength. There was a weakness in his limbs that surprised him,  and a  sudden chill replaced the fever in his blood. Jeanne placed  her hand  upon his arm and thrust him gently toward the tent. 
  &quot;You must not exert yourself,&quot; she said, watching the pallor in   his face. &quot;You must be quiet, until after dinner.&quot; 
  He obeyed the pressure of her hand. Pierre followed into the tent,   and for a moment he was compelled to lean heavily upon the half-   breed. 
  &quot;It is the reaction, M'sieur,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;You are weak after   the fever. If you could sleep&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I can,&quot; murmured Philip, dizzily, dropping upon his balsam. &quot;But,   Pierre&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;I have something&#8212;to say to you&#8212;no questions&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Not now, M'sieur.&quot; 
  Philip heard the rustling of the flap, and Pierre was gone. He   felt more comfortable lying down. Dizziness and nausea left him,  and  he slept. It was the deep, refreshing sleep that always  follows the  awakening from fever. When he awoke he felt like his  old self, and  went outside. Pierre was alone; a blanket was drawn  across the front  of the balsam shelter, and the half-breed nodded  toward it in response  to Philip's inquiring glance. 
  Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.   When he had finished he leaned close to him, and said: 
  &quot;You have warned me to ask no questions, and I am going to ask   none. But you have not forbidden me to tell you things which I  know.  I am going to talk to you about Lord Fitzhugh Lee.&quot; 
  Pierre's dark eyes flashed. 
  &quot;M'sieur&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Listen!&quot; demanded Philip. &quot;I seek your confidence no further. But   I shall tell you what I know of Lord Fitzhugh Lee, if it makes us   fight. Do you understand? I insist upon this because you have as  good  as told me that this man is your enemy, and that he is at the  bottom  of Jeanne's trouble. He is also my enemy. And after I have  told you  why&#8212;you may change your determination to keep me a  stranger to your  trouble. If not&#8212;well, you can hold your tongue  then as well as now.&quot; 
  Quickly, without moving his eyes from Pierre's face, Philip told   his own story of Lord Fitzhugh Lee. And as he continued a strange   change came over the half-breed. When he came to the letters   revealing the plot to turn the northerners against his company a  low  cry escaped Pierre's lips. His eyes seemed starting from his  head.  Drops of sweat burst out upon his face. His fingers worked   convulsively, something rose in his throat and choked him. When   Philip had done he buried his face in his hands. For a few moments  he  remained thus, and then suddenly looked up. Livid spots burned  in his  cheeks, and he fairly hissed at Philip. 
  &quot;M'sieur, if this is not the truth&#8212;if this is a lie&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped. Something in Philip's eyes told him to go no further.   He was fearless, and he saw more than fearlessness in Philip's  face.  Such men believe, when they come together. 
  &quot;It is the truth,&quot; said Philip. 
  With a low, strained laugh Pierre held out his hand as a pledge of   his faith. 
  &quot;I believe in you, M'sieur,&quot; he said, and it seemed an effort for   him to speak. &quot;Do you know what I would have thought, if you had  told  this to Jeanne before I came?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;I would have thought, M'sieur, that she threw herself purposely   into the death of the Big Thunder rocks.&quot; 
  &quot;My God, you mean&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;That is all, M'sieur. I can say no more. Ah, there is Jeanne!&quot; he   cried, more loudly. &quot;Now we will take down the tent, and go.&quot; 
  Jeanne stood a dozen steps behind them when Philip turned. She   greeted him with a smile, and hastened to assist Pierre in  gathering  up the things about the camp. Philip was not blind to  her efforts to  evade him. He could see that it was a relief to her  when they were at  last in Pierre's canoe, and headed up the river.  They traveled till  late in the evening, and set up Jeanne's tent  by starlight. The  journey was continued at dawn. Late the  following afternoon the Little  Churchill swept through a low,  woodless country, called the White Fox  Barren. It was a narrow  barren and across it lay the forest and the  ridge mountains.  Behind these mountains and the forest the sun was  setting. Above  all else there rose out of the gathering gloom of  evening a single  ridge, a towering mass of rock which caught the last  glow of the  sun, and blazed like a signal-fire. 
  The canoe stopped. Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great   rock. 
  Then Jeanne, who was in the bow, turned her face to Philip, and   the glow of the rock itself suffused her cheeks as she pointed  over  the barren. 
  &quot;M'sieur Philip,&quot; she said, &quot;there is Fort o' God!&quot;
