Cyril felt all was up. Elma glanced at him trembling. This was  horrible, inconceivable, inexplicable, fatal. The very stars in  their courses seem to fight against Guy. Blind chance checkmated  them. No hope was left now, save in Gilbert Gildersleeve's own  sense of justice.    
But Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve sat there, transfixed with horror. No  answering gleam now shot through his dull, glazed eye. For he alone  knew that whatever made the case against the prisoner look worse,  made his own position each moment more awful and more intolerable.    
Through the rest of the case, Cyril sat in his place like a stone  figure. Counsel for the Crown generously abstained from putting  him into the witness-box to give testimony against his brother. Or  rather, they thought the facts themselves, as they had just come  out in court, more telling for the jury than any formal evidence.  The only other witness of importance was, therefore, the lad who  had sat on the gate by the entrance to The Tangle. As he scrambled  into the box Sir Gilbert's anxiety grew visibly deeper and more  acute than ever. For the boy was the one person who had seen him  at Mambury on the day of the murder; and on the boy depended his  sole chance of being recognised. At Tavistock, eighteen months  before, Sir Gilbert had left the cross-examination of this witness  in the hands of a junior, and the boy hadn't noticed him, sitting  down among the Bar with gown and wig on. But to-day, it was impossible  the boy shouldn't see him; and if the boy should recognise him--why,  then, Heaven help him.    
The lad gave his evidence-in-chief with great care and deliberateness.  He swore positively to Guy, and wasn't for a moment to be shaken in  cross-examination. He admitted he had been mistaken at Tavistock,  and confused the prisoner with Cyril--when he saw one of them  apart--but now that he saw 'em both together before his eyes at  once, why, he could take his solemn oath as sure as fate upon him.  Guy's counsel failed utterly to elicit anything of importance,  except--and here Sir Gilbert's face grew whiter than ever--except  that another gentleman whom the lad didn't know had asked at the  gate about the path, and gone round the other way as if to meet  Mr. Nevitt.    
"What sort of a gentleman?" the cross-examiner inquired, clutching  at this last straw as a mere chance diversion.    
"Well, a vurry big zart o' a gentleman," witness answered, unabashed.  "A vine vigger o' a man. Jest such another as thik 'un with the  wig ther."    
As he spoke he stared hard at the judge, a good scrutinizing stare.  Sir Gilbert quailed, and glanced instinctively, first at the boy,  and then at Elma. Not a spark of intelligence shone in the lad's  stolid eyes. But Elma's were fixed upon him with a serpentine glare  of awful fascination. "Thou art the man," they seemed to say to him  mutely. Sir Gilbert, in his awe, was afraid to look at them. They  made him wild with terror, yet they somehow fixed him. Try as he would  to keep his own from meeting them, they attracted him irresistibly.    
A ripple, of faint laughter ran lightly through the court at the  undisguised frankness of the boy's reply. The judge repressed it  sternly.    
"Oh, he was just such another one as his lordship, was he?" counsel  repeated, pressing the lad hard. "Now, are you quite sure you  remember all the people you saw that day? Are you quite sure the  other man who asked about passers-by wasn't--for example--the judge  himself who's sitting here?"    
Sir Gilbert glanced up with a quick, suspicious air. It was only  a shot at random--the common advocate's trick in trying to confuse  a witness over questions of identity; but to Sir Gilbert, under the  circumstances, it was inexpressibly distressing. "Well, it murt  'a been he," the lad answered, putting his head on one side, and  surveying the judge closely with prolonged attention. "Thik un 'ad  just such another pair o' 'ands as his lordship do 'ave. It murt  'a been his lordship 'urself as is zitting there."    
"This goes quite beyond the bounds of decency," Sir Gilbert murmured  faintly, with a vain endeavour to hold his hands on the desk in an  unconcerned attitude. "Have the kindness, Mr. Walters, to spare  the Bench. Attend to your examination. Observations of that sort  are wholly uncalled for."    
But the boy, once started, was not so easily repressed. "Why, it  was his lordship," he went on, scanning the judge still harder. "I  do mind his vurry voice. It was 'im, no doubt about it. I've zeed  a zight o' people, since I zeed 'im that day, but I do mind his  voice, and I do mind his 'ands, and I do mind his ve-ace the zame  as if it wur yesterday. Now I come to look, blessed if it wasn't  his lordship!"    
Guy's counsel smiled a triumphant smile. He had carried his point.  He had confused the witness. This showed how little reliance could  be placed upon the boy's evidence as to personal identity! He'd  identify anybody who happened to be suggested to him! But Sir  Gilbert's face grew yet more deadly pale. For he saw at a glance  this was no accident or mistake; the boy really remembered him!  And Elma's steadfast eyes looked him through and through, with that  irresistible appeal, still more earnestly than ever.    
Sir Gilbert breathed again. He had been recognised to no purpose.  Even this positive identification fell flat upon everybody.    
At last the examination and cross-examination were finished, and  Guy's counsel began his hopeless task of unravelling this tangled  mass of suggestion and coincidence. He had no witnesses to call;  the very nature of the case precluded that. All he could do was  to cavil over details, to point out possible alternatives, to lay  stress upon the absence of direct evidence, and to ask that the jury  should give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, if any doubt at  all existed in their minds as to his guilt or innocence. Counsel  had meant when he first undertook the case to lay great stress also  on the presumed absence of motive; but, after the fatal accident  which resulted in the disclosure of Montague Nevitt's pocket-book,  any argument on that score would have been worse than useless.  Counsel elected rather to pass the episode by in discreet silence,  and to risk everything on the uncertainty of the actual encounter.    
At last he sat down, wiping his brow in despair, after what he felt  himself to be a most feeble performance.    
Then Sir Gilbert began, and in a very tremulous and failing voice  summed briefly up the whole of the evidence.    
Men who remember Gildersleeve's old blustering manner stood aghast  at the timidity with which the famous lawyer delivered himself on  this, the first capital charge ever brought before him. He reminded  the jury, in very solemn and almost warning tones, that where a  human life was at stake, mere presumptive evidence should always  carry very little weight with it. And the evidence here was all  purely presumptive. The prosecution had shown nothing more than  a physical possibility that the prisoner at the bar might have  committed the murder. There was evidence of animus, it was true;  but that evidence was weak; there was partial identification; but  that identification lay open to the serious objection that all the  persons who now swore to Guy Waring's personality had sworn just  as surely and confidently before to his brother Cyril's. On the  whole, the judge summed up strongly in Guy's favour. He wiped his  clammy brow and looked appealingly at the bar. As the jury would  hope for justice themselves, let them remember to mete out nothing  but strict justice to the accused person who now stood trembling  in the dock before them.    
All the court stood astonished. Could this be Gildersleeve? Atkins  would never have summed up like that. Atkins would have gone in  point-blank for hanging him. And everybody thought Gildersleeve  would hang with the best. Nobody had suspected him till then of  any womanly weakness about capital punishment. There was a solemn  hush as the judge ended. Then everybody saw the unhappy man was  seriously ill. Great streams of sweat trickled slowly down his brow.  His eyes stared in front of him. His mouth twitched horribly. He  looked like a person on the point of apoplexy. The prisoner at the  bar gazed hard at him and pitied him.    
"He's dying himself, and he wants to go out with a clear conscience  at last," some one suggested in a low voice at the barristers'  table. The explanation served. It was whispered round the court  in a hushed undertone that the judge to-day was on his very last  legs, and had summed up accordingly. Late in life, he had learned  to show mercy, as he hoped for it.    
There was a deadly pause. The jury retired to consider their  verdict. Two men remained behind in court, waiting breathless for  their return. Two lives hung at issue in the balance while the jury  deliberated. Elma Clifford, glancing with a terrified eye from  one to the other, could hardly help pitying the guiltiest most.  His look of mute suffering was so inexpressibly pathetic.    
The twelve good men and true were gone for a full half-hour. Why,  nobody knew. The case was as plain as a pikestaff, gossipers said  in court. If he had been caught red-handed, he'd have been hanged  without remorse. It was only the eighteen months and the South  African episode that could make the jury hesitate for one moment  about hanging him.    
At last, a sound, a thrill, a movement by the door. Every eye  was strained forward. The jury trooped back again. They took their  places in silence. Sir Gilbert scanned their faces with an agonized  look. It was a moment of ghastly and painful suspense. He was  waiting for their verdict--on himself, and Guy Waring.
