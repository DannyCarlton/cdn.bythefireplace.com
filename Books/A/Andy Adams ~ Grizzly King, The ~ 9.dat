  The ledge where Thor and Muskwa lay caught the first gleams of the  morning sun, and as the sun rose higher the ledge grew warmer and  warmer, and Thor, when he awoke, merely stretched himself and made no  effort to rise. After his wounds and the<I> sapoos oowin</I> and the  feast in the valley he was feeling tremendously fine and comfortable,  and he was in no very great haste to leave this golden pool of  sunlight. For a long time he looked steadily and curiously at Muskwa.  In the chill of the night the little cub had snuggled up close between  the warmth of Thor's huge forearms, and still lay there, whimpering in  his babyish way as he dreamed.
  After a time Thor did something that he had never been guilty of  before&#8212;he sniffed gently at the soft little ball between his paws, and  just once his big flat red tongue touched the cub's face; and Muskwa,  perhaps still dreaming of his mother, snuggled closer. As little white  children have won the hearts of savages who were about to slay them, so  Muskwa had come strangely into the life of Thor.
  The big grizzly was still puzzled. Not only was he struggling  against an unaccountable dislike of all cubs in general, but also  against the firmly established habits of ten years of aloneness. Yet he  was beginning to comprehend that there was something very pleasant and  companionable in the nearness of Muskwa. With the coming of man a new  emotion had entered into his being&#8212;perhaps only the spark of an  emotion. Until one has enemies, and faces dangers, one cannot fully  appreciate friendship&#8212;and it may be that Thor, who now confronted real  enemies and a real danger for the first time, was beginning to  understand what friendship meant. Also it was drawing near to his  mating season, and about Muskwa was the scent of his mother. And so as  Muskwa continued to bask and dream in the sunshine, there was a growing  content in Thor.
  He looked down into the valley, shimmering in the wet of the night's  rain, and he saw nothing to rouse discontent; he sniffed the air, and  it was filled with the unpolluted sweetness of growing grass, of  flowers, and balsam, and water fresh from the clouds.
  Thor began to lick his wound, and it was this movement that roused  Muskwa. The cub lifted his head. He blinked at the sun for a  moment&#8212;then rubbed his face sleepily with his tiny paw and stood up.  Like all youngsters, he was ready for another day, in spite of the  hardships and toil of the preceding one.
  While Thor still lay restfully looking down into the valley, Muskwa  began investigating the crevices in the rock wall, and tumbled about  among the boulders on the ledge.
  From the valley Thor turned his eyes to the cub. There was curiosity  in his attitude as he watched Muskwa's antics and queer tumblings among  the rocks. Then he rose cumbrously and shook himself.
  For at least five minutes he stood looking down into the valley, and  sniffing the wind, as motionless as though carven out of rock. And  Muskwa, perking up his little ears, came and stood beside him, his  sharp little eyes peering from Thor off into sunlit space, and then  back to Thor again, as if wondering what was about to happen next.
  The big grizzly answered the question. He turned along the rock  shelf and began descending into the valley. Muskwa tagged behind, just  as he had followed the day before. The cub felt twice as big and fully  twice as strong as yesterday, and he no longer was obsessed by that  uncomfortable yearning for his mother's milk. Thor had graduated him  quickly, and he was a meat-eater. And he knew they were returning to  where they had feasted last night.
  They had descended half the distance of the slope when the wind  brought something to Thor. A deep-chested growl rolled out of him as he  stopped for a moment, the thick ruff about his neck bristling  ominously. The scent he had caught came from the direction of his  cache, and it was an odour which he was not in a humour to tolerate in  this particular locality. Strongly he smelled the presence of another  bear. This would not have excited him under ordinary conditions, and it  would not have excited him now had the presence been that of a female  bear. But the scent was that of a he-bear, and it drifted strongly up a  rock-cut ravine that ran straight down toward the balsam patch in which  he had hidden the caribou.
  Thor stopped to ask himself no questions. Growling under his breath,  he began to descend so swiftly that Muskwa had great difficulty in  keeping up with him. Not until they came to the edge of the plain that  overlooked the lake and the balsams did they stop. Muskwa's little jaws  hung open as he panted. Then his ears pricked forward, he stared, and  suddenly every muscle in his small body became rigid.
  Seventy-five yards below them their cache was being outraged. The  robber was a huge black bear. He was a splendid outlaw. He was,  perhaps, three hundred pounds lighter than Thor, but he stood almost as  high, and in the sunlight his coat shone with the velvety gloss of  sable&#8212;the biggest and boldest bear that had entered Thor's domain in  many a day. He had pulled the caribou carcass from its hiding-place and  was eating as Thor and Muskwa looked down on him.
  After a moment Muskwa peered up questioningly at Thor. &#8220;What are we  going to do?&#8221; he seemed to ask. &#8220;He's got our dinner!&#8221;
  Slowly and very deliberately Thor began picking his way down those  last seventy-five yards. He seemed to be in no hurry bow.
  When he reached the edge of the meadow, perhaps thirty or forty  yards from the big invader, he stopped again. There was nothing  particularly ugly in his attitude, but the ruff about his shoulders was  bigger than Muskwa had ever seen it before.
  The black looked up from his feast, and for a full half minute they  eyed each other. In a slow, pendulum-like motion the grizzly's huge  head swung from side to side; the black was as motionless as a sphinx.
  Four or five feet from Thor stood Muskwa. In a small-boyish sort of  way he knew that something was going to happen soon, and in that same  small-boyish way he was ready to put his stub of a tail between his  legs and flee with Thor, or advance and fight with him. His eyes were  curiously attracted by that pendulum-like swing of Thor's head. All  nature understood that swing. Man had learned to understand it. &#8220;Look  out when a grizzly rolls his head!&#8221; is the first commandment of the  bear-hunter in the mountains.
  The big black understood, and like other bears in Thor's domain, he  should have slunk a little backward, turned about and made his exit.  Thor gave him ample time. But the black was a new bear in the  valley&#8212;and he was not only that: he was a powerful bear, and  unwhipped; and he had overlorded a range of his own. He stood his  ground.
  The first growl of menace that passed between the two came from the  black.
  Again Thor advanced, slowly and deliberately&#8212;straight for the  robber. Muskwa followed halfway and then stopped and squatted himself  on his belly. Ten feet from the carcass Thor paused again; and now his  huge head swung more swiftly back and forth, and a low rumbling thunder  came from between his half-open jaws. The black's ivory fangs snarled;  Muskwa whined.
  Again Thor advanced, a foot at a time, and now his gaping jaws  almost touched the ground, and his huge body was hunched low.
  When no more than the length of a yardstick separated them there  came a pause. For perhaps thirty seconds they were like two angry men,  each trying to strike terror to the other's heart by the steadiness of  his look.
  Muskwa shook as if with the ague, and whined&#8212;softly and steadily he  whined, and the whine reached Thor's ears. What happened after that  began so quickly that Muskwa was struck dumb with terror, and he lay  flattened out on the earth as motionless as a stone.
  With that grinding, snarling grizzly roar, which is unlike any other  animal cry in the world, Thor flung himself at the black. The black  reared a little&#8212;just enough to fling himself backward easily as they  came together breast to breast. He rolled upon his back, but Thor was  too old a fighter to be caught by that first vicious ripping stroke of  the black's hind foot, and he buried his four long flesh-rending teeth  to the bone of his enemy's shoulder. At the same time he struck a  terrific cutting stroke with his left paw.
  Thor was a digger, and his claws were dulled; the black was not a  digger, but a tree-climber, and his claws were like knives. And like  knives they buried themselves in Thor's wounded shoulder, and the blood  spurted forth afresh.
  With a roar that seemed to set the earth trembling, the huge grizzly  lunged backward and reared himself to his full nine feet. He had given  the black warning. Even after their first tussle his enemy might have  retreated and he would not have pursued. Now it was a fight to the  death! The black had done more than ravage his cache. He had opened the  man-wound!
  A minute before Thor had been fighting for law and right&#8212;without  great animosity or serious desire to kill. Now, however, he was  terrible. His mouth was open, and it was eight inches from jaw to jaw;  his lips were drawn up until his white teeth and his red gums were  bared; muscles stood out like cords on his nostrils, and between his  eyes was a furrow like the cleft made by an axe in the trunk of a pine.  His eyes shone with the glare of red garnets, their greenish-black  pupils almost obliterated by the ferocious fire that was in them. Man,  facing Thor in this moment, would have known that only one would come  out alive.
  Thor was not a &#8220;stand-up&#8221; fighter. For perhaps six or seven seconds  he remained erect, but as the black advanced a step he dropped quickly  to all fours.
  The black met him halfway, and after this&#8212;for many minutes&#8212;Muskwa  hugged closer and closer to the earth while with gleaming eyes he  watched the battle. It was such a fight as only the jungles and the  mountains see, and the roar of it drifted up and down the valley.
  Like human creatures the two giant beasts used their powerful  forearms while with fangs and hind feet they ripped and tore. For two  minutes they were in a close and deadly embrace, both rolling on the  ground, now one under and then the other. The black clawed ferociously;  Thor used chiefly his teeth and his terrible right hind foot. With his  forearms he made no effort to rend the black, but used them to hold and  throw his enemy. He was fighting to get<I> under</I>, as he had flung  himself under the caribou he had disembowelled.
  Again and again Thor buried his long fangs in the other's flesh; but  in fang-fighting the black was even quicker than he, and his right  shoulder was being literally torn to pieces when their jaws met in  midair. Muskwa heard the clash of them; he heard the grind of teeth on  teeth, the sickening crunch of bone.
  Then suddenly the black was flung upon his side as though his neck  had been broken, and Thor was at his throat. Still the black fought,  his gaping and bleeding jaws powerless now as the grizzly closed his  own huge jaws on the jugular.
  Muskwa stood up. He was shivering still, but with a new and strange  emotion. This was not play, as he and his mother had played. For the  first time he was looking upon<I> battle</I>, and the thrill of it sent  the blood hot and fast through his little body. With a faint, puppyish  snarl he darted in. His teeth sank futilely into the thick hair and  tough hide of the black's rump. He pulled and he snarled; he braced  himself with his forefeet and tugged at his mouthful of hair, filled  with a blind and unaccountable rage.
  The black twisted himself upon his back, and one of his hind feet  raked Thor from chest to vent. That stroke would have disembowelled a  caribou or a deer; it left a red, open, bleeding wound three feet long  on Thor.
  Before it could be repeated, the grizzly swung himself sidewise, and  the second blow caught Muskwa. The flat of the black's foot struck him,  and for twenty feet he was sent like a stone out of a sling-shot. He  was not cut, but he was stunned.
  In that same moment Thor released his hold on his enemy's throat,  and swung two or three feet to one side. He was dripping blood. The  black's shoulders, chest, and neck were saturated with it; huge chunks  had been torn from his body. He made an effort to rise, and Thor was on  him again.
  This time Thor got his deadliest of all holds. His great jaws  clamped in a death-grip over the upper part of the black's nose. One  terrific grinding crunch, and the fight was over. The black could not  have lived after that. But this fact Thor did not know. It was now easy  for him to rip with those knifelike claws on his hind feet. He  continued to maul and tear for ten minutes after the black was dead.
  When Thor finally quit the scene of battle was terrible to look  upon. The ground was torn up and red; it was covered with great strips  of black hide and pieces of flesh; and the black, on the under side,  was torn open from end to end.
  Two miles away, tense and white and scarcely breathing as they  looked through their glasses, Langdon and Bruce crouched beside a rock  on the mountainside. At that distance they had witnessed the terrific  spectacle, but they could not see the cub. As Thor stood panting and  bleeding over his lifeless enemy, Langdon lowered his glass.
  &#8220;My God!&#8221; he breathed.
  Bruce sprang to his feet.
  &#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The black's dead! If we hustle we can get our  grizzly!&#8221;
  And down in the meadow Muskwa ran to Thor with a bit of warm black  hide in his mouth, and Thor lowered his great bleeding head, and just  once his red tongue shot out and caressed Muskwa's face. For the little  tan-faced cub had proved himself; and it may be that Thor had seen and  understood.
