Alan Merrick strode from his father's door that day stung with a  burning sense of wrong and injustice. More than ever before in  his life he realized to himself the abject hollowness of that  conventional code which masquerades in our midst as a system of  morals. If he had continued to "live single" as we hypocritically  phrase it, and so helped by one unit to spread the festering social  canker of prostitution, on which as basis, like some mediaeval  castle on its foul dungeon vaults, the entire superstructure of our  outwardly decent modern society is reared, his father no doubt  would have shrugged his shoulders and blinked his cold eyes, and  commended the wise young man for abstaining from marriage till his  means could permit him to keep a wife of his own class in the way  she was accustomed to. The wretched victims of that vile system  might die unseen and unpitied in some hideous back slum, without  touching one chord of remorse or regret in Dr. Merrick's nature.  He was steeled against their suffering. Or again, if Alan had sold  his virility for gold to some rich heiress of his set, like Ethel  Waterton--had bartered his freedom to be her wedded paramour in a  loveless marriage, his father would not only have gladly  acquiesced, but would have congratulated his son on his luck and  his prudence. Yet, because Alan had chosen rather to form a  blameless union of pure affection with a woman who was in every way  his moral and mental superior, but in despite of the conventional  ban of society, Dr. Merrick had cast him off as an open reprobate.  And why? Simply because that union was unsanctioned by the  exponents of a law they despised, and unblessed by the priests of a  creed they rejected. Alan saw at once it is not the intrinsic  moral value of an act such people think about, but the light in  which it is regarded by a selfish society.    
Unchastity, it has been well said, is union without love; and Alan  would have none of it.    
He went back to Herminia more than ever convinced of that spotless  woman's moral superiority to every one else he had ever met with.  She sat, a lonely soul, enthroned amid the halo of her own perfect  purity. To Alan, she seemed like one of those early Italian  Madonnas, lost in a glory of light that surrounds and half hides  them. He reverenced her far too much to tell her all that had  happened. How could he wound those sweet ears with his father's  coarse epithets?    
They took the club train that afternoon to Paris. There they slept  the night in a fusty hotel near the Gare du Nord, and went on in  the morning by the daylight express to Switzerland. At Lucerne and  Milan they broke the journey once more. Herminia had never yet  gone further afield from England than Paris; and this first glimpse  of a wider world was intensely interesting to her. Who can help  being pleased, indeed, with that wonderful St. Gothard--the crystal  green Reuss shattering itself in white spray into emerald pools by  the side of the railway; Wasen church perched high upon its  solitary hilltop; the Biaschina ravine, the cleft rocks of Faido,  the serpentine twists and turns of the ramping line as it mounts or  descends its spiral zigzags? Dewy Alpine pasture, tossed masses of  land-slip, white narcissus on the banks, snowy peaks in the  background--all alike were fresh visions of delight to Herminia;  and she drank it all in with the pure childish joy of a poetic  nature. It was the Switzerland of her dreams, reinforced and  complemented by unsuspected detail.    
One trouble alone disturbed her peace of mind upon that delightful  journey. Alan entered their names at all the hotels where they  stopped as "Mr. and Mrs. Alan Merrick of London." That deception,  as Herminia held it, cost her many qualms of conscience; but Alan,  with masculine common-sense, was firm upon the point that no other  description was practically possible; and Herminia yielded with a  sign to his greater worldly wisdom. She had yet to learn the  lesson which sooner or later comes home to all the small minority  who care a pin about righteousness, that in a world like our own,  it is impossible for the righteous always to act consistently up to  their most sacred convictions.    
At Milan, they stopped long enough to snatch a glimpse of the  cathedral, and to take a hasty walk through the pictured glories of  the Brera. A vague suspicion began to cross Herminia's mind, as she  gazed at the girlish Madonna of the Sposalizio, that perhaps she  wasn't quite as well adapted to love Italy as Switzerland. Nature  she understood; was art yet a closed book to her? If so, she would  be sorry; for Alan, in whom the artistic sense was largely  developed, loved his Italy dearly; and it would be a real cause of  regret to her if she fell short in any way of Alan's expectations.  Moreover, at table d'hote that evening, a slight episode occurred  which roused to the full once more poor Herminia's tender  conscience. Talk had somehow turned on Shelley's Italian wanderings;  and a benevolent-looking clergyman opposite, with that vacantly  well-meaning smile, peculiar to a certain type of country rector,  was apologizing in what he took to be a broad and generous spirit of  divine, toleration for the great moral teacher's supposed lapses  from the normal rule of tight living. Much, the benevolent-looking  gentleman opined, with beaming spectacles, must be forgiven to men  of genius. Their temptations no doubt are far keener than with most  of us. An eager imagination--a vivid sense of beauty--quick  readiness to be moved by the sight of physical or moral  loveliness--these were palliations, the old clergyman held, of much  that seemed wrong and contradictory to our eyes in the lives of so  many great men and women.    
At sound of such immoral and unworthy teaching, Herminia's ardent  soul rose up in revolt within her. "Oh, no," she cried eagerly,  leaning across the table as she spoke. "I can't allow that plea.  It's degrading to Shelley, and to all true appreciation of the  duties of genius. Not less but more than most of us is the genius  bound to act up with all his might to the highest moral law, to be  the prophet and interpreter of the highest moral excellence. To  whom much is given, of him much shall be required. Just because  the man or woman of genius stands raised on a pedestal so far above  the mass have we the right to expect that he or she should point us  the way, should go before us as pioneer, should be more careful of  the truth, more disdainful of the wrong, down to the smallest  particular, than the ordinary person. There are poor souls born  into this world so petty and narrow and wanting in originality that  one can only expect them to tread the beaten track, be it ever so  cruel and wicked and mistaken. But from a Shelley or a George  Eliot, we expect greater things, and we have a right to expect  them. That's why I can never quite forgive George Eliot--who knew  the truth, and found freedom for herself, and practised it in her  life--for upholding in her books the conventional lies, the  conventional prejudices; and that's why I can never admire Shelley  enough, who, in an age of slavery, refused to abjure or to deny his  freedom, but acted unto death to the full height of his principles."    
The benevolent-looking clergyman gazed aghast at Herminia. Then he  turned slowly to Alan. "Your wife," he said in a mild and  terrified voice, "is a <i>very</i> advanced lady."    
Herminia longed to blurt out the whole simple truth. "I am <i>not</i> his  wife. I am not, and could never be wife or slave to any man. This  is a very dear friend, and he and I are travelling as friends  together." But a warning glance from Alan made her hold her peace  with difficulty and acquiesce as best she might in the virtual  deception. Still, the incident went to her heart, and made her  more anxious than ever to declare her convictions and her practical  obedience to them openly before the world. She remembered, oh, so  well one of her father's sermons that had vividly impressed her in  the dear old days at Dunwich Cathedral. It was preached upon the  text, "Come ye out and be ye separate."    
From Milan they went on direct to Florence. Alan had decided to  take rooms for the summer at Perugia, and there to see Herminia  safely through her maternal troubles. He loved Perugia, he said;  it was cool and high-perched; and then, too, it was such a capital  place for sketching. Besides, he was anxious to complete his  studies of the early Umbrian painters. But they must have just one  week at Florence together before they went up among the hills.  Florence was the place for a beginner to find out what Italian art  was aiming at. You got it there in its full logical development--  every phase, step by step, in organic unity; while elsewhere you  saw but stages and jumps and results, interrupted here and there by  disturbing lacunae. So at Florence they stopped for a week en  route, and Herminia first learnt what Florentine art proposed to  itself.    
Ah, that week in Florence! What a dream of delight! 'Twas pure  gold to Herminia. How could it well be otherwise? It seemed to  her afterwards like the last flicker of joy in a doomed life,  before its light went out and left her forever in utter darkness.  To be sure, a week is a terribly cramped and hurried time in which  to view Florence, the beloved city, whose ineffable glories need at  least one whole winter adequately to grasp them. But failing a  winter, a week with the gods made Herminia happy. She carried away  but a confused phantasmagoria, it is true, of the soaring tower of  the Palazzo Vecchio, pointing straight with its slender shaft to  heaven; of the swelling dome and huge ribs of the cathedral, seen  vast from the terrace in front of San Miniato; of the endless  Madonnas and the deathless saints niched in golden tabernacles at  the Uffizi and the Pitti; of the tender grace of Fra Angelico at  San Marco; of the infinite wealth and astounding variety of  Donatello's marble in the spacious courts of the cool Bargello.  But her window at the hotel looked straight as it could look down  the humming Calzaioli to the pierced and encrusted front of  Giotto's campanile, with the cupola of San Lorenzo in the middle  distance, and the facade of Fiesole standing out deep-blue against  the dull red glare of evening in the background. If that were not  enough to sate and enchant Herminia, she would indeed have been  difficult. And with Alan by her side, every joy was doubled.    
She had never before known what it was to have her lover  continuously with her. And his aid in those long corridors, where  bambinos smiled down at her with childish lips, helped her  wondrously to understand in so short a time what they sought to  convey to her. Alan was steeped in Italy; he knew and entered into  the spirit of Tuscan art; and now for the first time Herminia found  herself face to face with a thoroughly new subject in which Alan  could be her teacher from the very beginning, as most men are  teachers to the women who depend upon them. This sense of support  and restfulness and clinging was fresh and delightful to her. It  is a woman's ancestral part to look up to the man; she is happiest  in doing it, and must long remain so; and Herminia was not sorry to  find herself in this so much a woman. She thought it delicious to  roam through the long halls of some great gallery with Alan, and  let him point out to her the pictures he loved best, explain their  peculiar merits, and show the subtle relation in which they stood  to the pictures that went before them and the pictures that came  after them, as well as to the other work of the same master or his  contemporaries. It was even no small joy to her to find that he  knew so much more about art and its message than she did; that she  could look up to his judgment, confide in his opinion, see the  truth of his criticism, profit much by his instruction. So well  did she use those seven short days, indeed, that she came to  Florence with Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, mere names;  and she went away from it feeling that she had made them real  friends and possessions for a life-time.    
So the hours whirled fast in those enchanted halls, and Herminia's  soul was enriched by new tastes and new interests. O towers of  fretted stone! O jasper and porphyry! Her very state of health  made her more susceptible than usual to fresh impressions, and drew  Alan at the same time every day into closer union with her. For  was not the young life now quickening within her half his and half  hers, and did it not seem to make the father by reflex nearer and  dearer to her? Surely the child that was nurtured, unborn, on  those marble colonnades and those placid Saint Catherines must draw  in with each pulse of its antenatal nutriment some tincture of  beauty, of freedom, of culture! So Herminia thought to herself as  she lay awake at night and looked out of the window from the  curtains of her bed at the boundless dome and the tall campanile  gleaming white in the moonlight. So we have each of us thought--  especially the mothers in Israel among us--about the unborn babe  that hastens along to its birth with such a radiant halo of the  possible future ever gilding and glorifying its unseen forehead.
