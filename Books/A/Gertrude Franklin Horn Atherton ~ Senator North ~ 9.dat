A month passed. Betty received with Lady Mary on Tuesdays, and under  that popular young matron's wing called on a number of women prominent  in the official life of the dying Administration, whom she received on  Fridays. They were very polite, and returned her calls promptly; but  they did not always remember her name, and her personality and  position impressed but a few of these women, overwhelmed with social  duties, visiting constituents, and people-with-letters. Most of them  paid from fifteen to twenty calls on six days out of seven, and had  filled their engagement books for the season during its first  fortnight. Betty was chagrined at first, then amused. Moreover, her  incomplete success raised the political world somewhat in Mrs.  Madison's estimation; she had expected that her house would be  besieged by these temporary beings, eager for a sniff at Old  Washington air. Betty realized that she must be content to go slowly  this winter, and begin to entertain as soon as the next season opened.  Lady Mary took her to four large receptions, and she was invited to  two or three dinners of a semi-official character; for several women  not only fancied her, but appreciated the fact that the official were  not the highest social honours in the land, and were glad to further  her plans.    
Senator Burleigh called several times. One day he arrived with a large  package of books: Bryce's "American Commonwealth," a volume containing  the Constitution and Washington's Farewell Address, and several of the  "American Statesmen" monographs.    
"Read all these," he said dictatorially. ("He certainly takes me very  seriously," thought Betty. "Doubtless he'll stand me in a corner with  my face to the wall if I don't get my lessons properly.") "I want you  to acquire the national sense. I don't believe a woman in this country  knows the meaning of the phrase. Study and think over the characters  of the men who created this country: Washington and Hamilton,  particularly. You'll know what I mean when you've read these little  volumes; and then I'll bring you some thirty volumes containing the  letters and despatches and communications to Congress of these two  greatest of all Americans. I don't know which I admire most. Hamilton  was the most creative genius of his century, but the very fact that he  was a genius of the highest order makes him hopeless as a standard.  But all men in public life who desire to attain the highest and most  unassailable position analyze the character of Washington and ponder  over it deeply. There never was a man so free from taint, there never  was such complete mental poise, there never was such cold, rarified,  unerring judgment. The man seems to us--who live in a turbulent day  when the effort to be and to remain high-minded makes the brain ache--  to have been nothing less than inspired. And his political wisdom is  as sound for to-day as for when he uttered it; although, for the life  of me, I cannot help disregarding his admonition to keep hands out of  foreign pie, this time. I want the country to go to the rescue of  Cuba, and I'll turn over every stone I can to that end."    
Betty had listened to him with much interest. "Would Washington have  gone?" she asked. "Would he advise it now, supposing he could?"    
"No, I don't believe he would. Washington had a brain of ice, and his  ideal of American prosperity was frozen within it. He would fear some  possible harm or loss to this country, and the other could be left to  the care of an all-merciful Providence. I love my country with as  sound a patriotism as a man may, and I revere the memory of  Washington, but I have not a brain of ice, and I think a country, like  a man, should think of others besides itself. And the United States  has got to that point where almost nothing could hurt it. A few  months' patriotic enthusiasm, for that matter, would do it no end of  good. If you care to listen, I'll read the Farewell Address to you."    
He read it in his sonorous rolling voice, that must have done as much  to make him a popular idol in his State as his more distinguished  gifts for public life. Betty decided that the more senatorial he was  the better she liked him. She knew that he was a favourite with men,  and had a vague idea that men, when in the exclusive society of their  own sex, always told witty anecdotes, but she could not imagine  herself making small talk with Senator Burleigh. Her day for small  talk, however, she fervently hoped was over.    
She had seen Senator North again but once. Lady Mary Montgomery gave a  great evening reception, as magnificent an affair of the sort as Betty  was likely to see in Washington. It was given in honour of a  distinguished Englishman, who, rumour whispered, had come over in the  interests of the General Arbitration Treaty between the United States  and Great Britain, now at the mercy of the Committee on Foreign  Relations. There was another impression, equally alive in Washington  that Lady Mary aspired to be the historic link between the two  countries. Certain it was that the Secretary of State, the British  Ambassador, and the Committee on Foreign Relations dined and called  constantly at her house. The Distinguished Guest had called on her  every day since his arrival.    
Betty knew what others divined; for the friends were inseparable, and  Mary Montgomery was very frank with her few intimates. "Of course I  want the treaty to go through," she had said to Betty, only the day  before her reception; "and I am quite wild to know what the Committee  are doing with it. But of course they will say nothing. Senator Ward  kisses my hand and talks Shakespeare and Socrates to me, and when I  use all my eloquence in behalf of a closer relationship between the  two greatest nations on earth--for I want an alliance to follow this  treaty--he says: <i>'Ma belle dame sans merci,</i> the American language  shall yet be spoken in the British Isles; I promise you that.' He is  one of the few Americans I cannot understand. He has eyes so heavy  that he never looks quite awake, and he is as quick as an Italian's  blade in retort. He has a large and scholarly intellect, and it is  almost impossible to make him serious. You never see him in his chair  on the floor of the Senate, although he sometimes drifts across the  room with a cigar in the hollow of his hand, and he is admittedly  one of its leading spirits, and the idol of a Western State--of all  things! Senator North is the reverse of transparent, but sometimes he  goes to the point in a manner which leaves nothing to be desired. He  is not on the Committee of Foreign Relations, so I asked him point  blank the other day if he thought the treaty would go through and if  he did not mean to vote for it. He is usually as polite as all men who  are successful in politics and like women, but he gave a short and  brutal laugh. 'Lady Mary,' he said, 'when some of my colleagues were  cultivating their muscles on the tail of your lion in the winter of  1895, I told them what I thought of them in language which only  senatorial courtesy held within bounds. If the Committee on Foreign  Relations--for whose members I have the highest respect: they are  picked men--should do anything so foolish and so unpatriotic as to  report back that treaty in a form to arouse the enthusiasm of  the British press, I fear I should disregard senatorial courtesy. But  the United States Senate does not happen to be composed of idiots, and  the President may amuse himself writing treaties, but he does not make  them.'    
"Then I asked him if he had no sentiment, if he did not think the  spirit of the thing fine: the union of the great English-speaking  races; and he replied that he saw no necessity for anything of the  sort: we did very well on our separate sides of the water; and as for  sentiment, we were like certain people,--much better friends while  coquetting than when married. He added that the divorce would be so  extremely painful. I asked him what was to prevent another lover's  quarrel, if there were no ring and no blessing, and he replied: 'Ah  that is another question. To keep out of useless wars with the old  country and to tie our hands fast to her quarrels are two things, and  the one we will do and the other we won't do.'    
"That is all he would say, but fortunately there is a less  conservative element in the Senate than his, although I believe they  all become saturated with that Constitution in time. I can see it  growing in Senator Burleigh."    
All elements had come to her reception to-night. Ambassadors and  Envoys Extraordinary were there in the full splendour of their  uniforms. So were Generals and Admirals; and the women of the Eastern  Legations had come in their native costumes. The portly ladies of the  Cabinet were as resplendent as their position demanded, and the  aristocracy of the Senate and the women of fashion were equally fine.  Other women were there, wives of men important but poor, who walked  unabashed in high-neck home-made frocks; and their pretty daughters,  were as simple as themselves. One wore a cheese-cloth frock, and  another a blue merino. The dames of the Plutocracy were there, blazing  with converted capital,--Westerners for the most part, with hogsheads  of money, who had come to the City of Open Doors to spend it. It was  seldom they were in the same room with the Old Washingtonians, and  when they were they sighed; then reminded themselves of recent dinners  to people whose names were half the stock in trade of the daily press.  Sally Carter, who regarded them through her lorgnette with much the  same impersonal interest as she would accord to actors on the boards,  wore a gown of azure satin trimmed with lace whose like was not to be  found in the markets of the world. Her hair was elaborately dressed,  and her thin neck sufficiently covered by a curious old collar of  pearls set with tiny miniatures. Careless as she was by day, it often  suited her to be very smart indeed by night. She looked brilliant; and  Jack Emory, who had been commanded by Betty to accept Lady Mary's  invitation, did not leave her side. And she snubbed her more worldly-  minded followers and devoted herself to his amusement.    
All the men wore evening clothes. It seemed to be an unwritten law  that the politician should have his dress-suit did his wife wear serge  for ever. Consequently they presented a more uniformly fine appearance  than their women, and most of them held themselves with a certain look  of power. Their faces were almost invariably keen and strong. Few of  the younger members of the House were here to-night, only those who  had been in it so many years that they were high in political  importance. Among them the big round form and smooth round head of  their present and perhaps most famous Speaker were conspicuous: the  United States was moving swiftly to the parting of the ways, and there  are times when a Speaker is a greater man than a President.    
What few authors Washington boasts were there, as well as Judges of  the Supreme Court, scholars, architects, scientists, and journalists.  And they moved amid great splendour. Lady Mary had thrown open her  ball-room, and the walls looked like a lattice-work of American Beauty  roses and thorns. Great bunches of the same expensive ornament swung  from the ceiling, and the piano was covered with a quilt of them  deftly woven together. The pale green drawing-room was as lavishly  decorated with pink and white orchids and lilies of the valley. Lady  Mary felt that she could vie in extravagance with the most ambitious  in her husband's ambitious land.    
Betty was entertaining four Senators, the Distinguished Guest, and the  Speaker of the House when she caught a glimpse of Senator North. She  immediately became a trifle absent, and permitted Senator Shattuc, who  liked to tell anecdotes of famous politicians, to take charge of the  conversation. While he was thinking her the one woman in Washington  charming enough to establish a <i>salon</i>, she was congratulating  herself that she should meet Senator North again when she looked her  best. She wore a wonderful new gown of mignonette green and ivory  white, and many pearls in her warm hair and on her beautiful neck. She  looked both regal and girlish, an effect she well knew how to produce.  Her head was thrown back and her eyes were sparkling with triumph as  they met Senator North's. He moved toward her at once.    
"I should be stupid to inquire after your health," he said as he shook  her hand. "You are positively radiant. I shall ask instead if you  still find time to come up and see us occasionally, and if we improve  on acquaintance?"    
"I go very often indeed, but I have seen you only three times."    
"I have been North for a week, and in my Committee Room a good deal  since my return."    
Betty was determined not to let slip this opportunity. She resented  the platitudes that are kept in stock by even the greatest minds, and  wished that he would hold out a peremptory arm and lead her to some  quiet corner and talk to her for an hour. But he evidently had a just  man's appreciation of the rights of others, for he betrayed no  intention to do anything of the kind. His eyes dwelt on her with frank  admiration, but Washington is the national headquarters of pretty  women, and he doubtless contented himself with a passing glimpse of  many. And this time Betty felt the full force of the man's magnetism.  She would have liked to put up a detaining hand and hold him there for  the rest of the evening. Even were there no chance for conversation,  she would have liked to be close beside him. She forgot, that he was  an ideal on a pedestal and shot him a challenging glance. "I have  hoped that you would come up to the gallery and call on me," she said  pointedly.    
He moved a step closer, then drew back. His face did not change.    
"I certainly shall when I am so fortunate as to see you up there," he  said. "But the fourth of March is not far off, and the pressure  accumulates. I am obliged to be in my Committee Room, as well as in  other Committee Rooms, for the better part of every day. But if I can  do anything for you, if there is any one you would care to meet, do  not fail to let me know. Send word to my room, and if possible I will  go to you."    
Betty looked at him helplessly. She wanted to ask him to call at her  house on Sunday, but felt a sudden diffidence. After all, why should  he care to call on her? He had more important things to think of; and  doubtless he spent his few leisure hours with some woman far more  brilliant than herself. Her head came down a trifle and she turned it  away. He stood there a moment longer, then said,--    
"Good-night," and, after a few seconds' hesitation, and with  unmistakable emphasis: "Remember that it would give me the greatest  possible pleasure to do anything for you I could." Immediately after,  he left the room.    
When she was alone an hour later, she anathematized herself for a  fool. Diffidence had no permanent part in her mental constitution. She  was sure that if she could talk with him for thirty consecutive  minutes she could interest him and attach him to her train. Her pride,  she felt, was now involved. She should estimate herself a failure  unless she compelled Senator North to forget the more experienced  women of the political world and spend his leisure hours with her.  She had been a brilliant success in other spheres, she would not fail  in this.    
But two more weeks passed and she did not see him. He came neither to  the floor of the Senate within her experience of it, nor to the  gallery. Nor did he appear to care for Society. Few of the Senators  did, for that matter. They did not mind dining out, as they had to  dine somewhere, and an agreeable and possibly handsome partner would  give zest to any meal; but they were dragged to receptions and escaped  as soon as they could.
