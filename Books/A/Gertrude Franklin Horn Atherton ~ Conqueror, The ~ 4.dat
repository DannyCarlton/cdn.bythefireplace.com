The last affliction the Fawcetts expected was another child. This little  girl came an unwelcome guest to a mother who hated the father, and to  Dr. Fawcett, not only because he had outgrown all liking for crying  babies, but because, as in his excited disturbance he admitted to his  wife, his fortune was reduced by speculations in London, and he had no  desire to turn to in his old age and support another child. Then Mary  Fawcett made up her definite mind: she announced her intention to leave  her husband while it was yet possible to save her property for herself  and the child to whom she soon became passionately attached. Dr. Fawcett  laughed and shut himself up in a wing where the sounds of baby distress  could not reach him; and it is doubtful if his glance ever lingered on  the lovely face of his youngest born. Thus came into the world under the  most painful conditions one of the unhappiest women that has lived. It  was her splendid destiny to become the mother of the greatest American  of his centuries, but this she died too soon to know, and she  accomplished her part with an immediate bitterness of lot which was  remorselessly ordained, no doubt, by the great Law of Compensation.    
There were no divorce laws on the Islands in the eighteenth century, not  even an act for separate maintenance; but Mary Fawcett was a woman of  resource. It took her four years to accomplish her purpose, but she got  rid of Dr. Fawcett by making him more than anxious to be rid of her. The  Captain-General, William Matthew, was her staunch friend and admirer,  and espoused her cause to the extent of issuing a writ of supplicavit  for a separate maintenance. Dr. Fawcett gradually yielded to pressure,  separated her property from his, that it might pass under her personal  and absolute control, and settled on her the sum of fifty-three pounds,  four shillings annually, as a full satisfaction for all her dower or  third part of his estate.    
Mistress Fawcett was no longer a woman of consequence, for even her  personal income was curtailed by the great drought of 1737, and Nevis,  complaisant to the gallantry of the age, was scandalized at the novelty  of a public separation. But she was free, and she was the woman to feel  that freedom to her finger tips; she could live a life with no will in  it but her own, and she could bring up her little girl in an atmosphere  of peace and affection. She moved to an estate she owned on St.  Christopher and never saw John Fawcett again. He died a few years later,  leaving his diminished property to his children. Rachael's share was the  house in Charles Town.    
The spot on which Rachael spent her childhood and brief youth was one of  the most picturesque on the mountain range of St. Christopher. Facing  the sea, the house stood on a lofty eminence, in the very shadow of  Mount Misery. Immediately behind the house were the high peaks of the  range, hardly less in pride than the cone of the great volcano. The  house was built on a ledge, but one could step from the terrace above  into an abrupt ravine, wrenched into its tortuous shape by earthquake  and flood, but dark for centuries with the immovable shades of a virgin  tropical forest. The Great House, with its spacious open galleries and  verandahs, was surrounded with stone terraces, overflowing with the  intense red and orange of the hybiscus and croton bush, the golden  browns and softer yellows of less ambitious plants, the sensuous tints  of the orchid, the high and glittering beauties of the palm and  cocoanut. The slopes to the coast were covered with cane-fields, their  bright young greens sharp against the dark blue of the sea. The ledge on  which the house was built terminated suddenly in front, but extended on  the left along a line of cliff above a chasm, until it sloped to the  road. On this flat eminence was an avenue of royal palms, which, with  the dense wood on the hill above it, was to mariners one of the most  familiar landmarks of the Island of "St. Kitts." From her verandah Mary  Fawcett could see, far down to the right, a large village of negro huts,  only the thatched African roofs visible among the long leaves of the  cocoanut palms with which the blacks invariably surround their  dwellings. Beyond was Brimstone Hill with its impregnable fortress. And  on the left, far out at sea, her purple heights and palm-fringed shores  deepening the exquisite blue of the Caribbean by day, a white ever  changing spirit in the twilight, and no more vestige of her under the  stars than had she sunk whence she came--Nevis. Mary Fawcett never set  foot on her again, but she learned to sit and study her with a whimsical  affection which was one of the few liberties she allowed her  imagination. But if the unhappiest years of her life had been spent  there, so had her fairest. She had loved her brilliant husband in her  youth, and all the social triumphs of a handsome and fortunate young  woman had been hers. In the deep calm which now intervened between the  two mental hurricanes of her life, she sometimes wondered if she had  exaggerated her past afflictions; and before she died she knew how  insignificant the tragedy of her own life had been.    
Although Rachael was born when her parents were past their prime, the  vitality that was in her was concentrated and strong. It was not enough  to give her a long life, but while it lasted she was a magnificent  creature, and the end was abrupt; there was no slow decay. During her  childhood she lived in the open air, for except in the cold nights of a  brief winter only the jalousies were closed; and on that high shelf even  the late summer and early autumn were not insufferable. Exhausted as the  trade winds become, they give what little strength is in them to the  heights of their favourite isles, and during the rest of the year they  are so constant, even when storms rage in the North Atlantic, that Nevis  and St. Christopher never feel the full force of the sun, and the winter  nights are cold.    
Rachael was four years old when her parents separated, and grew to  womanhood remembering nothing of her father and seeing little of her  kin, scattered far and wide. Her one unmarried sister, upon her return  from England, went almost immediately to visit Mrs. Lytton, and married  Thomas Mitchell, one of the wealthiest planters of St. Croix. Mary  Fawcett's children had not approved her course, for they remembered  their father as the most indulgent and charming of men, whose frequent  tempers were quickly forgotten; and year by year she became more wholly  devoted to the girl who clung to her with a passionate and uncritical  affection.    
Clever and accomplished herself, and quick with ambition for her best  beloved child, she employed the most cultivated tutors on the Island to  instruct her in English, Latin, and French. Before Rachael was ten years  old, Mistress Fawcett had the satisfaction to discover that the little  girl possessed a distinguished mind, and took to hard study, and to <i>les  graces</i>, as naturally as she rode a pony over the hills or shot the reef  in her boat.    
For several years the women of St. Christopher held aloof, but many of  the planters who had been guests at the Great House in Gingerland called  on Mistress Fawcett at once, and proffered advice and service. Of these  William Hamilton and Archibald Hamn became her staunch and intimate  friends. Mr. Hamn's estate adjoined hers, and his overlooker relieved  her of much care. Dr. James Hamilton, who had died in the year preceding  her formal separation, had been a close friend of her husband and  herself, and his brother hastened with assurance of his wish to serve  her. He was one of the eminent men of the Island, a planter and a member  of Council; also, a "doctor of physic." He carried Rachael safely  through her childhood complaints and the darkest of her days; and if his  was the hand which opened the gates between herself and history, who  shall say in the light of the glorified result that its master should  not sleep in peace?    
In time his wife called, and his children and stepchildren brought a new  experience into the life of Rachael. She had been permitted to gambol  occasionally with the "pic'nees" of her mother's maids, but since her  fourth year had not spoken to a white child until little Catherine  Hamilton came to visit her one morning and brought Christiana Huggins of  Nevis. Mistress Huggins had known Mary Fawcett too well to call with  Mistress Hamilton, but sent Christiana as a peace offering. Mary's first  disposition was to pack the child off while Mistress Hamilton was  offering her embarrassed explanations; but Rachael clung to her new  treasure with such shrieks of protest that her mother, disconcerted by  this vigour of opposition to her will, permitted the intruder to remain.    
The wives of other planters followed Mistress Hamilton, for in that soft  voluptuous climate, where the rush and fret of great cities are but a  witch's tale, disapproval dies early. They would have called long since  had they not been a trifle in awe of Nevis, more, perhaps, of Mistress  Fawcett's sharp tongue, then indolent. But when Mistress Hamilton  suddenly reminded them that they were Christians, and that Dr. Fawcett  was dead, they put on their London gowns, ordered out their coaches, and  called. Mary Fawcett received them with a courteous indifference. Her  resentment had died long since, and they seemed to her, with their  coaches and brocades and powdered locks, but the ghosts of the Nevis of  her youth. Her child, her estate, and her few tried friends absorbed  her. For the sake of her daughter's future, she ordered out her ancient  coach and made the round of the Island once a year. The ladies of St.  Kitts were as moderately punctilious.    
And so the life of Rachael Fawcett for sixteen years passed uneventfully  enough. Her spirits were often very high, for she inherited the Gallic  buoyancy of her father as well as the brilliant qualities of his mind.  In the serious depths of her nature were strong passions and a tendency  to melancholy, the result no doubt of the unhappy conditions of her  birth. But her mother managed so to occupy her eager ambitious mind with  hard study that the girl had little acquaintance with herself. Her  English studies were almost as varied as a boy's, and in addition to her  accomplishments in the ancient and modern languages, she painted, and  sang, played the harp and guitar. Mary Fawcett, for reasons of her own,  never let her forget that she was the most educated girl on the Islands.    
"I never was one to lie on a sofa all day and fan myself, while my  children sat on the floor with their blacks, and munched sugar-cane, or  bread and sling," she would remark superfluously. "All my daughters are  a credit to their husbands; but I mean that you shall be the most  brilliant woman in the Antilles."    
The immediate consequences of Rachael's superior education were two: her  girl friends ceased to interest her, and ambitions developed in her  strong imaginative brain. In those days women so rarely distinguished  themselves individually that it is doubtful if Rachael had ever heard of  the phenomenon, and the sum of her worldly aspirations was a wealthy and  intellectual husband who would take her to live and to shine at foreign  courts. Her nature was too sweet and her mind too serious for egoism or  the pettier vanities, but she hardly could help being conscious of the  energy of her brain; and if she had passed through childhood in  ignorance of her beauty, she barely had entered her teens when her happy  indifference was dispelled; for the young planters besieged her gates.    
Girls mature very early in the tropics, and at fourteen Rachael Fawcett  was the unresponsive toast from Basseterre to Sandy Point. Her height  was considerable, and she had the round supple figure of a girl who has  lived the out-door life in moderation; full of strength and grace, and  no exaggeration of muscle. She had a fine mane of reddish fair hair, a  pair of sparkling eager gray eyes which could go black with passion or  even excited interest, a long nose so sensitively cut that she could  express any mood she chose with her nostrils, which expanded quite  alarmingly when she flew into a temper, and a full well-cut mouth. Her  skin had the whiteness and transparency peculiar to the women of St.  Kitts and Nevis; her head and brow were nobly modelled, and the former  she carried high to the day of her death. It was set so far back on her  shoulders and on a line so straight that it would look haughty in her  coffin. What wonder that the young planters besieged her gates, that her  aspirations soared high, that Mary Fawcett dreamed of a great destiny  for this worshipped child of her old age? As for the young planters,  they never got beyond the gates, for a dragon stood there. Mistress  Fawcett had no mind to run the risk of early entanglements. When Rachael  was old enough she would be provided with a distinguished husband from  afar, selected by the experienced judgement of a woman of the world.    
But Mary Fawcett, still hot-headed and impulsive in her second  half-century, was more prone to err in crises than her daughter. In  spite of the deeper passions of her nature, Rachael, except when under  the lash of strong excitement, had a certain clearness of insight and  deliberation of judgement which her mother lacked to her last day.
