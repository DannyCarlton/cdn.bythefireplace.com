  That night, leaving Thornton still at supper in the little old  Windsor  Hotel, Jan slipped away, and with Kazan at his heels, crossed  the  frozen Saskatchewan to the spruce forest on the north shore. He  wanted  to be alone, to think, to fight with himself against a desire  which  was almost overpowering him. Once, long ago, he had laid his  soul bare  to Jean de Gravois, and Jean had given him comfort. To-night  he longed  to go to Thornton, as he had gone to Jean, and to tell him  the same  story, and what had passed that day in the office of the sub-   commissioner. In his heart there had grown something for Thornton that   was stronger than friendship&#8212;something that would have made him fight   for him, and die for him, as he would have fought and died for Jean de   Gravois. It was a feeling cemented by a belief that something was   troubling Thornton&#8212;that he, too, was filled with a loneliness and a   grief which he was trying to conceal. And yet he fought to restrain   himself from confiding in his new friend. It would do no good, he   knew, except by relieving him of a part of his mental burden. He   walked along the shore of the river and recrossed it again near the   company's offices. All were dark with the exception of the sub-   commissioner's room. In that there glowed a light. The sub-   commissioner was keeping his promise. He was working. He worked until   late, for Jan came back two hours after and saw the light still there. 
  A week&#8212;it might be ten days, the sub-commissioner had told him,  and  it would be over. Always something in the north drew Jan's eyes,  and  he looked there now, wondering what would happen to him after that   week was over. 
  Lights were out and people were in bed when he and Kazan returned  to  the hotel. But Thornton was up, sitting by himself in the gloom, as   Jan had first seen him at Le Pas. Jan sat down beside him. There was   an uneasy tremor in Thornton's voice when he said: 
  &quot;Jan, did you ever love a woman&#8212;love her until you were ready and   willing to die for her?&quot; 
  The suddenness of the question wrung the truth from Jan's lips in a   low, choking voice. For an instant he thought that Thornton must have   guessed his secret. 
  &quot;Yes, m'sieur.&quot; 
  Thornton leaned toward him, gripping his knees, and the misery in  his  face was deeper than Jan had ever seen it before. 
  &quot;I love a woman&#8212;like that,&quot; he went on tensely. &quot;A girl&#8212;not a  woman,  and she is one of your people, Jan&#8212;of the north, as innocent  as a  flower, more beautiful to ME than&#8212;than all the women I have ever  seen  before. She is at Oxford House. I am going home to&#8212;to save  myself.&quot;  &quot;Save yourself!&quot; cried Jan. &quot;Mon Dieu, m'sieur&#8212;does she not  love  you?&quot; 
  &quot;She would follow me to the end of the earth!&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;&quot; 
  Thornton straightened himself and wiped his pale face. Suddenly he   rose to his feet and motioned for Jan to follow him. He walked swiftly   out into the night, and still faster after that, until they passed   beyond the town. From where he stopped they could look over the   forests far into the pale light of the south. 
  &quot;THAT'S hell for me!&quot; said Thornton, pointing. &quot;It's what we call   civilization&#8212;but it's mostly hell, and it's all hell for me. It's a   hell of big cities, of strife, of blood-letting, of wickedness. I   never knew how great a hell it was until I came up here&#8212;among YOU. I   wish to God I could stay&#8212;always!&quot; 
  &quot;You love her,&quot; breathed Jan. &quot;You can stay.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't,&quot; groaned Thornton. &quot;I can't&#8212;unless&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What, m'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;Unless I lose everything&#8212;but her.&quot; 
  Jan's fingers trembled as they sought Thornton's hand. 
  &quot;And everything is&#8212;is&#8212;nothing when you give it for love and   happiness,&quot; he urged. &quot;The great God, I know&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Everything,&quot; cried Thornton. &quot;Don't you understand? I said   EVERYTHING!&quot; He turned almost fiercely upon his companion. &quot;I'd give   up my name&#8212;for HER. I'd bury myself back there in the forests and   never go out of them&#8212;for HER. I'd give up fortune, friends, lose   myself for ever&#8212;for HER. But I can't. Good God, don't you   understand?&quot; 
  Jan stared. His eyes grew large and dark. 
  &quot;I've spent ten years of WORSE than hell down there&#8212;with a woman,&quot;   went on Thornton. &quot;It happens among us&#8212;frequently, this sort of hell.   I came up here to get out of it for a time. You know&#8212;now. There is a   woman down there who&#8212;who is my wife. She would be glad if I never   returned. She is happy now, when I am away, and I have been happy&#8212;for   a time. I know what love is. I have felt it. I have lived it. God   forgive me, but I am almost tempted to go back&#8212;to HER!&quot; 
  He stopped at the change which had come in Jan, who stood as  straight  and as still as the blank spruce behind them, with only his  eyes  showing that there was life in him. Those eyes held Thornton's.  They  burned upon him through the gray gloom as he had never seen human  eyes  burn before. He waited, half startled, and Jan spoke. In his  voice  there was nothing of that which Thornton saw in his eyes. It was  low,  and soft, and though it had that which rung like steel, Thornton  could  not have understood or feared it more. 
  &quot;M'sieur, how far have you gone&#8212;WITH HER?&quot; Thornton understood and   advanced with his hands reaching out to Jan. 
  &quot;Only as far as one might go with the purest thing on earth,&quot; he  said.  &quot;I have sinned&#8212;in loving her, and in letting her love me, but  that is  all, Jan Thoreau. I swear that is all!&quot; 
  &quot;And you are going back into the south?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I am going back into the south.&quot; 
  The next day Thornton did not go. He made no sign of going on the   second day. So it was with the third, the fourth, and the fifth. On   each of these days Jan went once, in the afternoon, to the office of   the sub-commissioner, and Thornton always accompanied him. At times,   when Jan was not looking, there was a hungry light in his eyes as he   followed the other's movements, and once or twice Jan caught what was   left of this look when he turned unexpectedly. He knew what was in   Thornton's mind, and he pitied him, grieved with him in his own heart   until his own secret almost wrung itself from his lips. Somehow, in a   way that he could not understand, Thornton's sacrifice to honor, and   his despair, gave Jan strength, and a hundred times he asked himself   if a confession of his own misery would do as much for the other. He   repeated this thought to himself again and again on the afternoon of   the ninth day, when he went to the sub-commissioner's office alone.   This time Thornton had remained behind. He had left him in a gloomy   corner of the hotel room from which he had not looked up when Jan went   out with Kazan. 
  This ninth day was the last day for Jan Thoreau. In a dazed sort of   way he listened as the sub-commissioner told him that the work was   ended. They shook hands. It was dark when Jan came out from the   company's offices, dark with a pale gloom through which the stars were   beginning to glow&#8212;with a ghostly gloom, lightened still more in the   north with the rising fires of the northern lights. Alone Jan stood   for a few moments close down to the river. Across from him was the   forest, silent, black, reaching to the end of the earth, and over it,   like a signal light, beckoning him back to his world, the aurora sent   out its shafts of red and gold. And as he listened there came to him   faintly a distant wailing sound that he knew was the voice from that   world, and at the sound the hair rose along Kazan's spine, and he   whined deep down in his throat. Jan's breath grew quicker, his blood   warmer. Over there&#8212;across the river&#8212;his world was calling to him,   and he, Jan Thoreau, was now free to go. This very night he would bury   himself in the forest again, and when he lay down to sleep it would be   with his beloved stars above him, and the winds whispering sympathy   and brotherhood to him in the spruce tops. He would go&#8212;NOW. He would   say good-by to Thornton&#8212;and GO. 
  He found himself running, and Kazan ran beside him. He was  breathless  when he came to the one lighted street of the town. He  hurried to the  hotel and found Thornton sitting where he had left him. 
  &quot;It is ended, m'sieur,&quot; he cried in a low voice. &quot;It is over, and I  am  going. I am going to-night.&quot; 
  Thornton rose. &quot;To-night,&quot; he repeated. 
  &quot;Yes, to-night&#8212;now. I am going to pick up my things. Will you  come?&quot; 
  He went ahead of Thornton to the bare little room in which he had   slept while at the hotel. He did not notice the change in Thornton   until he had lighted a lamp. Thornton was looking at him doggedly.   There was an unpleasant look in his face, a flush about his eyes, a   rigid tenseness in the muscles of his jaws. 
  &quot;And I&#8212;I, too, am going to-night,&quot; he said. &quot;Into the South,   m'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;No, into the NORTH.&quot; There was a fierceness in Thornton's  emphasis.  He stood opposite Jan, leaning over the table on which the  light was  placed. &quot;I've broken loose,&quot; he went on. &quot;I'm not going  south&#8212;back to  that hell of mine. I'm never going south again. I'm  dead down there&#8212;  dead for all time. They'll never hear of me again.  They can have my  fortune&#8212;everything. I'm going North. I'm going to  live with YOU  people&#8212;and God&#8212;AND HER!&quot; 
  Jan sank into a chair, Thornton sat down in one across from him. 
  &quot;I am going back to her,&quot; he repeated. &quot;No one will ever know.&quot; 
  He could not account for the look in Jan's eyes nor for the nervous   twitching of the lithe brown hands that reached half across the table.   But Kazan's one eye told him more than Thornton could guess, and in   response to it that ominous shivering wave rose along his spine.   Thornton would never know that Jan's fingers twitched for an instant   in their old mad desire to leap at a human throat. 
  &quot;You will not do that,&quot; he said quietly. 
  &quot;Yes, I will,&quot; replied Thornton. &quot;I have made up my mind. Nothing  can  stop me but&#8212;death.&quot; 
  &quot;There is one other thing that can stop you, and will, m'sieur,&quot;  said  Jan as quietly as before. &quot;I, Jan Thoreau, will stop you.&quot; 
  Thornton rose slowly, staring down into Jan's face. The flush about   his eyes grew deeper. 
  &quot;I will stop you,&quot; repeated Jan, rising also. &quot;And I am not death.&quot; 
  He went to Thornton and placed his two hands upon his shoulders,  and  in his eyes there glowed now that gentle light which had made  Thornton  love him as he had loved no other man on earth. 
  &quot;M'sieur, I will stop you,&quot; he said again, speaking as though to a   brother. &quot;Sit down. I am going to tell you something. And when I have   told you this you will take my hand, and you will say, 'Jan Thoreau, I   thank the Great God that something like this has happened before, and   that it has come to my ears in time to save the one I love.' Sit down,   m'sieur.&quot;
