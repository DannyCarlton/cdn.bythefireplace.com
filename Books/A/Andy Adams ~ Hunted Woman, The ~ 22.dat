  Not until they had rushed up out of the coulee and had reached the  pathlike trail did the screaming cease. For barely an instant MacDonald  paused, and then ran on with a speed that taxed Aldous to keep up. When  they came to the little open amphitheatre in the forest MacDonald  halted again. Their hearts were thumping like hammers, and the old  mountaineer's voice came husky and choking when he spoke.
  &#8220;It wasn't far&#8212;from here!&#8221; he panted.
  Scarcely had he uttered the words when he sped on again. Three  minutes later they came to where the trail crossed the edge of a small  rock-cluttered meadow, and with a sudden spurt Aldous darted ahead of  MacDonald into this opening, where he saw two figures in the moonlight.  Half a dozen feet from them he stopped with a cry of horror. They were  Paul and Peggy Blackton! Peggy was dishevelled and sobbing, and was  frantically clutching at her husband. It was Paul Blackton who dragged  the cry from his lips. The contractor was swaying. He was hatless; his  face was covered with blood, and his eyes were only half open, as if he  were fighting to pull himself back into consciousness after a terrible  blow. Peggy's hair was down, her dress was torn at the throat, and she  was panting so that for a moment she could not speak.
  &#8220;They've got&#8212;Joanne!&#8221; she cried then. &#8220;They went&#8212;there!&#8221;
  She pointed, and Aldous ran where she pointed&#8212;into the timber on  the far side of the little meadow. MacDonald caught his arm as they  ran.
  &#8220;You go straight in,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I'll swing&#8212;to right&#8212;toward  river&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  For two minutes after that Aldous tore straight ahead. Then for  barely a moment he stopped. He had not paused to question Peggy  Blackton. His own fears told him who Joanne's abductors were. They were  men working under instructions from Quade. And they could not be far  away, for scarcely ten minutes had passed since the first scream. He  listened, and held his breath so that the terrific beating of his heart  would not drown the sound of crackling brush. All at once the blood in  him was frozen by a fierce yell. It was MacDonald, a couple of hundred  yards to his right, and after that yell came the bellowing shout of his  name.
  &#8220;Johnny! Johnny! Oh, Johnny!&#8221;
  He dashed in MacDonald's direction, and a few moments later heard  the crashing of bodies in the undergrowth. Fifty seconds more and he  was in the arena. MacDonald was fighting three men in a space over  which the spruce-tops grew thinly. The moon shone upon them as they  swayed in a struggling mass, and as Aldous sprang to the combat one of  the three reeled backward and fell as if struck by a battering-ram. In  that same moment MacDonald went down, and Aldous struck a terrific blow  with the butt of his heavy Savage. He missed, and the momentum of his  blow carried him over MacDonald. He tripped and fell. By the time he  had regained his, feet the two men had disappeared into the thick  shadows of the spruce forest. Aldous whirled toward the third man, whom  he had seen fall. He, too, had disappeared. A little lamely old Donald  brought himself to his feet. He was smiling.
  &#8220;Now, what do 'ee think, Johnny?&#8221;
  &#8220;Where is she? Where is Joanne?&#8221; demanded Aldous.
  &#8220;Twenty feet behind you, Johnny, gagged an' trussed up nice as a  whistle! If they hadn't stopped to do that work you wouldn't ha' seen  her ag'in, Johnny&#8212;s'elp me, God, you wouldn't! They was hikin' for the  river. Once they had reached the Frazer, and a boat&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He broke off to lead Aldous to a clump of dwarf spruce. Behind this,  white and still in the moonlight, but with eyes wide open and filled  with horror, lay Joanne. Hands and feet were bound, and a big  handkerchief was tied over her mouth. Twenty seconds later Aldous held  her shivering and sobbing and laughing hysterically by turns in his  arms, while MacDonald's voice brought Paul and Peggy Blackton to them.  Blackton had recovered from the blow that had dazed him. Over Joanne's  head he stared at Aldous. And MacDonald was staring at Blackton. His  eyes were burning a little darkly.
  &#8220;It's all come out right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it ain't a special nice  time o' night to be taking a' evening walk in this locality with a  couple o' ladies!&#8221;
  Blackton was still staring at Aldous, with Peggy clutching his arm  as if afraid of losing him.
  It was Peggy who answered MacDonald.
  &#8220;And it was a nice time of night for you to send a message asking us  to bring Joanne down the trail!&#8221; she cried, her voice trembling.
  &#8220;We&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; began Aldous, when he saw a sudden warning movement on  MacDonald's part, and stopped. &#8220;Let us take the ladies home,&#8221; he said.
  With Joanne clinging to him, he led the way. Behind them all  MacDonald growled loudly:
  &#8220;There's got t' be something done with these damned beasts of  furriners. It's gettin' so no woman ain't safe at night!&#8221;
  Twenty minutes later they reached the bungalow. Leaving Joanne and  Peggy inside, now as busily excited as two phoebe birds, and after  Joanne had insisted upon Aldous sleeping at the Blacktons' that night,  the two men accompanied MacDonald a few steps on his way back to camp.
  As soon as they were out of earshot Blackton began cursing softly  under his breath.
  &#8220;So you didn't send that damned note?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You haven't said  so, but I've guessed you didn't send it!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, we didn't send a note.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you had a reason&#8212;you and MacDonald&#8212;for not wanting the girls  to know the truth?&#8221;
  &#8220;A mighty good reason,&#8221; said Aldous. &#8220;I've got to thank MacDonald  for closing my mouth at the right moment. I was about to give it away.  And now, Blackton, I've got to confide in you. But before I do that I  want your word that you will repeat nothing of what I say to another  person&#8212;even your wife.&#8221;
  Blackton nodded.
  &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've suspected a thing or two, Aldous. I'll give  you my word. Go on.&#8221;
  As briefly as possible, and without going deeply into detail, Aldous  told of Quade and his plot to secure possession of Joanne.
  &#8220;And this is his work,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;I've told you this, Paul, so  that you won't worry about Peggy. You can see from to-night's events  that they were not after her, but wanted Joanne. Joanne must not learn  the truth. And your wife must not know. I am going to settle with  Quade. Just how and where and when I'm going to settle with him I don't  care to say now. But he's going to answer to me. And he's going to  answer soon.&#8221;
  Blackton whistled softly.
  &#8220;A boy brought the note,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He stood in the dark when he  handed it to me. And I didn't recognize any one of the three men who  jumped out on us. I didn't have much of a chance to fight, but if  there's any one on the face of the earth who has got it over Peggy when  it comes to screaming, I'd like to know her name! Joanne didn't have  time to make a sound. But they didn't touch Peggy until she began  screaming, and then one of the men began choking her. They had about  laid me out with a club, so I was helpless. Good God&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He shuddered.
  &#8220;They were river men,&#8221; said MacDonald. &#8220;Probably some of Tomman's  scow-men. They were making for the river.&#8221;
  A few minutes later, when Aldous was saying good-night to MacDonald,  the old hunter said again, in a whisper:
  &#8220;Now what do 'ee think, Johnny?&#8221;
  &#8220;That you're right, Mac,&#8221; replied Aldous in a low voice. &#8220;There is  no longer a choice. Joanne must go with us. You will come early?&#8221;
  &#8220;At dawn, Johnny.&#8221;
  He returned to the bungalow with Blackton, and until midnight the  lights there burned brightly while the two men answered a thousand  questions about the night's adventure, and Aldous told of his and  Joanne's plans for the honeymoon trip into the North that was to begin  the next day.
  It was half-past twelve when be locked the door of his and sat down  to think.
