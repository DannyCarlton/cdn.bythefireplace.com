  In the few minutes following the efficient and unexpected warning   of Bateese an entirely new element of interest entered into the   situation for David Carrigan. He had more than once assured  himself  that he had made a success of his profession of man-  hunting not  because he was brighter than the other fellow, but  largely because he  possessed a sense of humor and no vanities to  prick. He was in the  game because he loved the adventure of it. He  was loyal to his duty,  but he was not a worshipper of the law, nor  did he covet the small  monthly stipend of dollars and cents that  came of his allegiance to  it. As a member of the Scarlet Police,  and especially of &quot;N&quot; Division,  he felt the pulse and thrill of  life as he loved to live it. And the  greatest of all thrills came  when he was after a man as clever as  himself, or cleverer. 
  This time it was a woman&#8212;or a girl! He had not yet made up his   mind which she was. Her voice, low and musical, her poise, and the   tranquil and unexcitable loveliness of her face had made him, at   first, register her as a woman. Yet as he looked at the slim   girlishness of her figure in the bow of the canoe, accentuated by  the  soft sheen of her partly unbraided hair, he wondered if she  were  eighteen or thirty. It would take the clear light of day to  tell him.  But whether a girl or a woman, she had handled him so  cleverly that  the unpleasantness of his earlier experience began  to give way slowly  to an admiration for her capability. 
  He wondered what the superintendent of &quot;N&quot; Division would say if   he could see Black Roger Audemard's latest trailer propped up here  in  the center of the canoe, the prisoner of a velvety-haired but   dangerously efficient bit of feminine loveliness&#8212;and a bull-  necked,  chimpanzee-armed half-breed! 
  Bateese had confirmed the suspicion that he was a prisoner, even   though this mysterious pair were bent on saving his life. Why it  was  their desire to keep life in him when only a few hours ago one  of them  had tried to kill him was a. question which only the  future could  answer. He did not bother himself with that problem  now. The present  was altogether too interesting, and there was but  little doubt that  other developments equally important were close  at hand. The attitude  of both Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain and her  piratical-looking henchman  was sufficient evidence of that.  Bateese had threatened to knock his  head off, and he could have  sworn that the girl&#8212;or woman&#8212;had smiled  her approbation of the  threat. Yet he held no grudge against Bateese.  An odd sort of  liking for the man began to possess him, just as he  found himself  powerless to resist an ingrowing admiration for  Marie-Anne. The  existence of Black Roger Audemard became with him a  sort of  indefinite reality. Black Roger was a long way off. Marie-Anne  and  Bateese were very near. He began thinking of her as Marie-Anne. He   liked the name. It was the Boulain part of it that worked in him  with  an irritating insistence. 
  For the first time since the canoe journey had begun, he looked   beyond the darkly glowing head and the slender figure in the bow.  It  was a splendid night. Ahead of him the river was like a  rippling sheet  of molten silver. On both sides, a quarter of a  mile apart, rose the  walls of the forest, like low-hung, oriental  tapestries. The sky  seemed near, loaded with stars, and the moon,  rising with almost  perceptible movement toward the zenith, had  changed from red to a  mellow gold. Carrigan's soul always rose to  this glory of the northern  light. Youth and vigor, he told  himself, must always exist under those  unpolluted lights of the  upper worlds, the unspeaking things which had  told him more than  he had ever learned from the mouths of other men.  They stood for  his religion, his faith, his belief in the existence of  things  greater than the insignificant spark which animated his own  body.  He appreciated them most when there was stillness. And tonight  it  was still. It was so quiet that the trickling of the paddles was   like subdued music. From the forest there came no sound. Yet he  knew  there was life there, wide-eyed, questing life, life that  moved on  velvety wing and padded foot, just as he and Marie-Anne  and the  half-breed Bateese were moving in the canoe. To have  called out in  this hour would have taken an effort, for a supreme  and invisible Hand  seemed to have commanded stillness upon the  earth. 
  And then there came droning upon his ears a break in the   stillness, and as he listened, the shores closed slowly in,  narrowing  the channel until he saw giant masses of gray rock  replacing the thick  verdure of balsam, spruce, and cedar. The  moaning grew louder, and the  rocks climbed skyward until they hung  in great cliffs. There could be  but one meaning to this sudden  change. They were close to LE  SAINT-ESPRIT RAPIDE&#8212;the Holy Ghost  Rapids. Carrigan was astonished.  That day at noon he had believed  the Holy Ghost to be twenty or thirty  miles below him. Now they  were at its mouth, and he saw that Bateese  and Jeanne Marie-Anne  Boulain were quietly and unexcitedly preparing  to run that vicious  stretch of water. Unconsciously he gripped the  gunwales of the  canoe with both hands as the sound of the rapids grew  into low and  sullen thunder. In the moonlight ahead he could see the  rock walls  closing in until the channel was crushed between two  precipitous  ramparts, and the moon and stars, sending their glow  between those  walls, lighted up a frothing path of water that made  Carrigan hold  his breath. He would have portaged this place even in  broad day. 
  He looked at the girl in the bow. The slender figure Was a little   more erect, the glowing head held a little higher. In those  moments  he would have liked to see her face, the wonderful  something that must  be in her eyes as she rode fearlessly into the  teeth of the menace  ahead. For he could see that she was not  afraid, that she was facing  this thing with a sort of exultation,  that there was something about  it which thrilled her until every  drop of blood in her body was racing  with the impetus of the  stream itself. Eddies of wind puffing out from  between the chasm  walls tossed her loose hair about her back in a  glistening veil.  He saw a long strand of it trailing over the edge of  the canoe  into the water. It made him shiver, and he wanted to cry out  to  Bateese that he was a fool for risking her life like this. He   forgot that he was the one helpless individual in the canoe, and  that  an upset would mean the end for him, while Bateese and his  companion  might still fight on. His thought and his vision were  focused on the  girl&#8212;and what lay straight ahead. A mass of froth,  like a windrow of  snow, rose up before them, and the canoe plunged  into it with the  swiftness of a shot. It spattered in his face,  and blinded him for an  instant. Then they were out of it, and he  fancied he heard a note of  laughter from the girl in the bow. In  the next breath he called  himself a fool for imagining that. For  the run was dead ahead, and the  girl became vibrant with life, her  paddle flashing in and out, while  from her lips came sharp, clear  cries which brought from Eateese  frog-like bellows of response.  The walls shot past; inundations rose  and plunged under them;  black rocks whipped with caps of foam raced  up-stream with the  speed of living things; the roar became a drowning  voice, and  then&#8212;as if outreached by the wings of a swifter  thing&#8212;dropped  suddenly behind them. Smoother water lay ahead. The  channel  broadened. Moonlight filled it with a clearer radiance, and   Carrigan saw the girl's hair glistening wet, and her arms  dripping. 
  For the first time he turned about and faced Bateese. The half-   breed was grinning like a Cheshire cat! 
  &quot;You're a confoundedly queer pair!&quot; grunted Carrigan, and he   turned about again to find Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain as  unconcerned  as though running the Holy Ghost Rapids in the glow of  the moon was  nothing more than a matter of play. 
  It was impossible for him to keep his heart from beating a little   faster as he watched her, even though he was trying to regard her  in  a most professional sort of way. He reminded himself that she  was an  iniquitous little Jezebel who had almost murdered him.  Carmin Fanchet  had been like her, an AME DAMNEE&#8212;a fallen angel&#8212;  but his business  was not sympathy in such matters as these. At the  same time he could  not resist the lure of both her audacity and  her courage, and he found  himself all at once asking himself the  amazing question as to what her  relationship might be to Bateese.  It occurred to him rather  unpleasantly that there had been  something distinctly proprietary in  the way the half-breed had  picked her up on the sand, and that Bateese  had shown no  hesitation a little later in threatening to knock his  head off  unless he stopped talking to her. He wondered if Bateese was  a  Boulain. 
  The two or three minutes of excitement in the boiling waters of   the Holy Ghost had acted like medicine on Carrigan. It seemed to  him  that something had given way in his head, relieving him of an   oppression that had been like an iron hoop drawn tightly about his   skull. He did not want Bateese to suspect this change in him, and  he  slouched lower against the dunnage-pack with his eyes still on  the  girl. He was finding it increasingly difficult to keep from  looking at  her. She had resumed her paddling, and Bateese was  putting mighty  efforts in his strokes now, so that the narrow,  birchbark canoe shot  like an arrow with the down-sweeping current  of the river. A few  hundred yards below was a twist in the  channel, and as the canoe  rounded this, taking the shoreward curve  with dizzying swiftness, a  wide, still straight-water lay ahead.  And far down this Carrigan saw  the glow of fires. 
  The forest had drawn back from the river, leaving in its place a   broken tundra of rock and shale and a wide strip of black sand  along  the edge of the stream itself. Carrigan knew what it was&#8212;an  upheaval  of the tar-sand country so common still farther north,  the beginning  of that treasure of the earth which would some day  make the top of the  American continent one of the Eldorados of the  world. The fires drew  nearer, and suddenly the still night was  broken by the wild chanting  of men. David heard behind him a  choking note in the throat of  Bateese. A soft word came from the  lips of the girl, and it seemed to  Carrigan that her head was held  higher in the moon glow. The chant  increased in volume, a  rhythmic, throbbing, savage music that for a  hundred and fifty  years had come from the throats of men along the  Three Rivers. It  thrilled Carrigan as they bore down upon it. It was  not song as  civilization would have counted song. It was like an  explosion, an  exultation of human voice unchained, ebullient with the  love of  life, savage in its good-humor. It was LE GAITE DE COEUR of  the  rivermen, who thought and sang as their forefathers did in the   days of Radisson and good Prince Rupert; it was their merriment,   their exhilaration, their freedom and optimism, reaching up to the   farthest stars. In that song men were straining their vocal  muscles,  shouting to beat out their nearest neighbor, bellowing  like bulls in a  frenzy of sudden fun. And then, as suddenly as it  had risen in the  night, the clamor of voices died away. A single  shout came up the  river. Carrigan thought he heard a low rumble of  laughter. A tin pan  banged against another. A dog howled. The flat  of an oar played a  tattoo for a moment on the bottom of a boat.  Then one last yell from a  single throat&#8212;and the night was silent  again. 
  And that was the Boulain Brigade&#8212;singing at this hour of the   night, when men should have been sleeping if they expected to be  up  with the sun. Carrigan stared ahead. Shortly his adventure  would take  a new twist. Something was bound to happen when they  got ashore. The  peculiar glow of the fires had puzzled him. Now he  began to  understand. Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain's men were camped  in the edge of  the tar-sands and had lighted a number of natural  gas-jets that came  up out of the earth. Many times he had seen  fires like these burning  up and down the Three Rivers. He had  lighted fires of his own; he had  cooked over them and had  afterward had the fun and excitement of  extinguishing them with  pails of water. But he had never seen anything  quite like this  that was unfolding itself before his eyes now. There  were seven of  the fires over an area of half an acre&#8212;spouts of  yellowish flame  burning like giant torches ten or fifteen feet in the  air. And  between them he very soon made out great bustle and activity.  Many  figures were moving about. They looked like dwarfs at first,   gnomes at play in a little world made out of witchcraft. But  Bateese  was sending the canoe nearer with powerful strokes, and  the figures  grew taller, and the spouts of flame higher. Then he  knew what was  happening. The Boulain men were taking advantage of  the cool hours of  the night and were tarring up. 
  He could smell the tar, and he could see the big York boats drawn   up in the circle of yellowish light. There were half a dozen of  them,  and men stripped to the waist were smearing the bottoms of  the boats  with boiling tar and pitch. In the center was a big,  black cauldron  steaming over a gas-jet, and between this cauldron  and the boats men  were running back and forth with pails. Still  nearer to the huge  kettle other men were filling a row of kegs  with the precious black  GOUDRON that oozed up from the bowels of  the earth, forming here and  there jet-black pools that Carrigan  could see glistening in the flare  of the gas-lamps. He figured  there were thirty men at work. Six big  York boats were turned keel  up in the black sand. Close inshore, just  outside the circle of  light, was a single scow. 
  Toward this scow Bateese sent the canoe. And as they drew nearer,   until the laboring men ashore were scarcely a stone's throw away,  the  weirdness of the scene impressed itself more upon Carrigan.  Never had  he seen such a crew. There were no Indians among them.  Lithe,  quick-moving, bare-headed, their naked arms and shoulders  gleaming in  the ghostly illumination, they were racing against  time with the  boiling tar and pitch in the cauldron. They did not  see the approach  of the canoe, and Bateese did not draw their  attention to it. Quietly  he drove the birchbark under the shadow  of the big bateau. Hands were  waiting to seize and steady it.  Carrigan caught but a glimpse of the  faces. In another instant the  girl was aboard the scow, and Bateese  was bending over him. A  second time he was picked up like a child in  the chimpanzee-like  arms of the half-breed. The moonlight showed him a  scow bigger  than he had ever seen on the upper river, and two-thirds  of it  seemed to be cabin. Into this cabin Bateese carried him, and in   darkness laid him upon what Carrigan thought must be a cot built   against the wall. He made no sound, but let himself fall limply  upon  it. He listened to Bateese as he moved about, and closed his  eyes when  Bateese struck a match. A moment later he heard the door  of the cabin  close behind the half-breed. Not until then did he  open his eyes and  sit up. 
  He was alone. And what he saw in the next few moments drew an   exclamation of amazement from him. Never had he seen a cabin like   this on the Three Rivers. It was thirty feet long if an inch, and  at  least eight feet wide. The walls and ceiling were of polished  cedar;  the floor was of cedar closely matched. It was the  exquisite finish  and craftsmanship of the woodwork that caught his  eyes first. Then his  astonished senses seized upon the other  things. Under his feet was a  soft rug of dark green velvet. Two  magnificent white bearskins lay  between him and the end of the  room. The walls were hung with  pictures, and at the four windows  were curtains of ivory lace draped  with damask. The lamp which  Bateese had lighted was fastened to the  wall close to him. It was  of polished silver and threw a brilliant  light softened by a shade  of old gold. There were three other lamps  like this, unlighted.  The far end of the room was in deep shadow, but  Carrigan made out  the thing he was staring at&#8212;a piano. He rose to his  feet,  disbelieving his eyes, and made his way toward it. He passed   between chairs. Near the piano was another door, and a wide divan  of  the same soft, green upholstery. Looking back, he saw that what  he had  been lying upon was another divan. And dose to this were  book-shelves,  and a table on which were magazines and papers and a  woman's  workbasket, and in the workbasket&#8212;sound asleep&#8212;a cat! 
  And then, over the table and the sleeping cat, his eyes rested   upon a triangular banner fastened to the wall. In white against a   background of black was a mighty polar bear holding at bay a horde  of  Arctic wolves. And suddenly the thing he had been fighting to  recall  came to Carrigan&#8212;the great bear&#8212;the fighting wolves&#8212;the  crest of  St. Pierre Boulain! 
  He took a quick step toward the table&#8212;then caught at the back of   a chair. Confound his head! Or was it the big bateau rocking under   his feet? The cat seemed to be turning round in its basket. There   were half a dozen banners instead of one; the lamp was shaking in  its  bracket; the floor was tilting, everything was becoming  hideously  contorted and out of place. A shroud of darkness  gathered about him,  and through that darkness Carrigan staggered  blindly toward the divan.  He reached it just in time to fall upon  it like a dead man.
