That face which no man ever saw<br> And from his memory banished quite,<br> With eyes in which are Hamlet's awe<br> And Cardinal Richelieu's subtle light,<br> Looks from this frame. A master's hand<br> Has set the master-player here,<br> In the fair temple that he planned<br> Not for himself. To us most dear<br> This image of him! "It was thus<br> He looked; such pallor touched his cheek;<br> With that same grace he greeted us--<br> Nay, 'tis the man, could it but speak!"<br> Sad words that shall be said some day--<br> Far fall the day! O cruel Time,<br> Whose breath sweeps mortal things away,<br> Spare long this image of his prime,<br> That others standing in the place<br> Where, save as ghosts, we come no more,<br> May know what sweet majestic face<br> The gentle Prince of Players wore!
