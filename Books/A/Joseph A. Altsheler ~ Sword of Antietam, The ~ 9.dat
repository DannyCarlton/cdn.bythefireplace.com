  Dick and his comrades had not heard of the taking of Harper's Ferry  and they were full of enthusiasm that brilliant morning in  mid-September. McClellan, if slow to move, nevertheless had shown vigor  in action, and the sanguine youths could not doubt that they had driven  Lee into a corner. The Confederates, after the fierce fighting of the  day before, had abandoned both gaps, and the way at last lay clear  before the Army of the Potomac.
  Dick was mounted again. In fact his horse, after pulling the reins  from his hands and fleeing from the Confederate fire, had been retaken  by a member of his own regiment and returned to him. It was another  good omen. The lost had been found again and defeat would become  victory.
  But Dick said nothing to anybody of his duel with Harry Kenton. He  shuddered even now when he recalled it. And yet there had been no guilt  in either. Neither had known that the other lay behind the stone, but  happy chance had made all their bullets go astray. Again he was  thankful.
  &#8220;How did you stand that fighting yesterday afternoon, George?&#8221; Dick  asked of Warner.
  &#8220;First rate. The open air agreed with me, and as no bullet sought me  out I felt benefited. I didn't get away from that hospital too soon.  How far away is this Antietam River, behind which they say Lee lies?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's only eight miles from the gap,&#8221; said Pennington, who had been  making inquiries, &#8220;and as we have come three miles it must be only five  miles away.&#8221;
  &#8220;Correct,&#8221; said Warner, who was in an uncommonly fine humor. &#8220;Your  mathematical power grows every day, Frank. Let x equal the whole  distance from the gap to the Antietam, which is eight miles, let y  equal the distance which we have come which is three miles, then x  minus y equals the distance left, which is five miles. Wonderful!  wonderful! You'll soon have a great head on you, Frank.&#8221;
  &#8220;If some rebel cannoneer doesn't shoot it off in the coming battle.  By George, we're driving their skirmishers before us! They don't seem  to make any stand at all!&#8221;
  The vanguard certainly met with no very formidable resistance as it  advanced over the rolling country. The sound of firing was continuous,  but it came from small squads here and there, and after firing a few  volleys the men in gray invariably withdrew.
  Yet the Northern advance was slow. Colonel Winchester became  intensely impatient again.
  &#8220;Why don't we hurry!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Of all things in the world the  one that we need most is haste. With Jackson tied up before Harper's  Ferry, Lee's defeat is sure, unless he retreats across the Potomac, and  that would be equivalent to a defeat. Good Heavens, why don't we push  on?&#8221;
  He had not yet heard of the fall of Harper's Ferry, and that Jackson  with picked brigades was already on the way to join Lee. Had he known  these two vital facts his anger would have burned to a white heat.  Surely no day lost was ever lost at a greater cost than the one  McClellan lost after the finding of Orders No. 191.
  &#8220;Do you know anything about the Antietam, colonel?&#8221; asked Dick.
  &#8220;It's a narrow stream, but deep, and crossed by several stone  bridges. It will be hard to force a crossing here, but further up it  can be done with ease since we outnumber Lee so much that we can  overlap him by far. I have my information from Shepard, and he makes no  mistakes. There is a church, too, on the upper part of the peninsula, a  little church belonging to an order called the Dunkards.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ah,&#8221; murmured Dick, &#8220;the little church of Shiloh!&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;
  &#8220;There was a little church at Shiloh, too. The battle raged all  around it more than once. We lost it at first, but in the end we won.  It's another good omen. We're bound to achieve a great victory,  colonel.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope and believe so. We've the materials with which to do it. But  we've got to push and push hard.&#8221;
  The colonel raised his glasses and took a long look in front. Dick  also had a pair and he, too, examined the country before them. It was a  fine, rolling region and all the forest was gone, except clumps of  trees here and there. The whole country would have been heavy with  forest had it not been for the tramp of war.
  It was now nearly noon and the sunlight was brilliant and intense.  The glasses carried far. Dick saw a line of trees which he surmised  marked the course of the Antietam, and he saw small detachments of  cavalry which he knew were watching the advance of the Army of the  Potomac. Their purpose convinced him that Lee had not retreated across  the Potomac, but that he would fight and surely lose. Dick now believed  that so many good omens could not fail.
  A horseman galloped toward them. It was Shepard again, dustier than  ever, his face pale from weariness.
  &#8220;What is it, Mr. Shepard?&#8221; asked Colonel Winchester.
  &#8220;I've just reported to General McClellan that our whole command at  Harper's Ferry, thirteen thousand strong, surrendered early this  morning and that Jackson with picked men has already started to join  Lee!&#8221;
  &#8220;My God! My God!&#8221; cried the colonel. &#8220;Oh, that lost day! We ought to  have fought yesterday and destroyed Lee, while Harper's Ferry was still  holding out! What a day! What a day! Nothing can ever pay us back for  the losing of it!&#8221;
  Dick, too, felt a sinking of the heart, but despair was not written  on his face as it was on that of his colonel. Jackson might come, but  it would only be with a part of his force, that which marched the  swiftest, and the victory of the Army of the Potomac would be all the  grander. The more enemies crushed the better it would be for the Union.
  &#8220;Why, colonel!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;we can beat them anyhow!&#8221;
  &#8220;That's so, my lad, so we can! And so we will! It was childish of me  to talk as I did. Here, Johnson, blow your best on that trumpet. I want  our regiment to be the first to reach the Antietam.&#8221;
  Johnson blew a long and mellow tune and the Winchester regiment  swung forward at a more rapid gait. The weather, after a day or two of  coolness, had grown intensely hot again, and the noon sun poured down  upon them sheaves of fiery rays. Dick looked back, and he saw once more  that vast billowing cloud of dust made by the marching army. But in  front he saw only quiet and peace, save for a few distant horsemen who  seemed to be riding at random.
  &#8220;There's a little town called Sharpsburg in the peninsula formed by  the Potomac and the Antietam,&#8221; said Shepard, who stayed with them, his  immediate work done, &#8220;and the Potomac being very low, owing to the dry  season, there is one ford by which Lee can cross and go back to  Virginia. But he isn't going to cross without a battle, that's sure.  The rebels are flushed with victory, they think they have the greatest  leaders ever born and they believe, despite the disparity of numbers,  that they can beat us.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I believe they can't,&#8221; said Dick.
  &#8220;If it were not for that lost day we'd have 'em beaten now,&#8221; said  Shepard, &#8220;and we'd be marching against Jackson.&#8221;
  The regiment in its swift advance now came nearer to the Antietam,  the narrow but deep creek between its high banks. One or two shots from  the far side warned them to come more slowly, and Colonel Winchester  drew his men up on a knoll, waiting for the rest of the army to  advance.
  Dick put his glasses to his eyes, and slowly swept a wide curve on  the peninsula of Antietam. Great armies drawn up for battle were a  spectacle that no boy could ever view calmly, and his heart beat so  hard that it caused him actual physical pain.
  He saw through the powerful glasses the walls of the little village  of Sharpsburg, and to the north a roof which he believed was that of  the Dunkard Church, of which Shepard spoke. But his eyes came back from  the church and rested on the country around Sharpsburg. The Confederate  masses were there and he clearly saw the batteries posted along the  Antietam. Beyond the peninsula he caught glimpses of the broad Potomac.
  There lay Lee before them again, and now was the time to destroy his  army. Jackson, even with his vanguard, could not arrive before night,  and the main force certainly could not come from Harper's Ferry before  the morrow. Here was a full half day for the Army of the Potomac,  enough in which to destroy a divided portion of the Army of Northern  Virginia.
  But Colonel Winchester raged again and again in vain. There was no  attack. Brigade after brigade in blue came up and sat down before the  Antietam. The cannon exchanged salutes across the little river, but no  harm was done, and the great masses of McClellan faced the whole  peninsula, within which lay Lee with half of his army. The Winchester  regiment was moved far to the north, where its officers hopefully  believed that the first attack would be made. Here they extended beyond  Lee's line, and it would be easy to cross the Antietam and hurl  themselves upon his flank.
  Despite the delay, Dick and his comrades, thrilled at the great and  terrible panorama spread before them. The mid-September day had become  as hot as those of August had been. The late afternoon sun was brazen,  and immense clouds of dust drifted about. But they did not hide the  view of the armies, arrayed for battle, and with only a narrow river  between.
  Dick, through his own glasses saw Confederate officers watching them  also. He tried to imagine that this was Lee and that Longstreet, and  that one of the Hills, and the one who wore a gorgeous uniform must  surely be Stuart. Why should they be allowed to ride about so calmly?  His heart fairly ached for the attack. McClellan said that fifty  thousand men were there, and that Jackson was coming with fifty  thousand more, but Shepard, who always knew, said that they did not  number more than twenty thousand. What a chance! What a chance! He  almost repeated Colonel Winchester's words, but he was only a young  staff officer and it was not for him to complain. If he said anything  at all he would have to say it in a guarded manner and to his best  friends.
  The Winchester regiment went into camp in a pleasant grove at the  northern end of the Union line. Dick and his two young comrades had no  fault to find with their quarters. They had dry grass, warm air and the  open sky. A more comfortable summer home for a night could not be  asked. And there was plenty of food, too. The Army of the Potomac never  lacked it. The coffee was already boiling in the pots, and beef and  pork were frying in the skillets. Heavenly aromas arose.
  Dick and his comrades ate and drank, and then lay down in the grove.  If they must rest they would rest well. Now and then they heard the  booming of guns, and just before dark there had been a short artillery  duel across the Antietam, but now the night was quiet, save for the  murmur and movement of a great army. Through the darkness came the  sound of many voices and the clank of moving wheels.
  Dick asked permission for his two comrades and himself to go down  near the river and obtained it.
  &#8220;But don't get shot,&#8221; cautioned Colonel Winchester. &#8220;The Confederate  riflemen will certainly be on watch on the other side of the stream.&#8221;
  Dick promised and the three went forward very carefully among some  bushes. They were led on by curiosity and they did not believe that  they would be in any great danger. The singular friendliness which  always marked the pickets of the hostile armies in the Civil War would  prevail.
  It was several hundred yards down to the Antietam, and luckily the  ribbon of bushes held out. But when they were half way to the stream a  thick, dark figure rose up before them. Dick, in an instant, recognized  Sergeant Whitley.
  &#8220;We want to get a nearer view of the enemy,&#8221; said the boy.
  &#8220;I'll go with you,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;I'm on what may be called  scouting duty. Besides, I've a couple of friends down there by the  river, but on the other side.&#8221;
  &#8220;Friends on the other side of the Antietam. What do you mean,  sergeant?&#8221;
  &#8220;I was scouting along there and I came across 'em. Only one in fact  is an old acquaintance, an' he's just introduced me to the other.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's cryptic.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't rightly know what 'cryptic' means, but I guess I don't make  myself understood well. In my campaign on the plains against the  Indians I had a comrade named Bill Brayton. A Tennesseean, Bill was an'  a fine feller, too. Him an' me have bunked together many a time an'  we've dug out of the snow together, too, after the blizzards was over.  But when we saw the war comin' up, Bill had fool notions. Said he  didn't know anything 'bout the right an' wrong of it, guessed there was  some of each on each side, but whichever way his state would flop, he'd  flop. Well, we waited. Tennessee flopped right out of the Union an'  Bill flopped with it.
  &#8220;I felt powerful sorry when Bill told me good-bye, and so did he. I  ain't seen or heard of him since 'till to-night, when I was cruisin'  down there by the side of the river in the dark an' keepin' under cover  of the bushes. Had no intention of shootin' anybody. Just wanted to  take a look. I saw on the other side a dim figure walkin' up an' down,  rifle on shoulder. Thought I noticed something familiar about it, an'  the longer I watched the shorer I was.
  &#8220;At last I crept right to the edge of the bank an' layin' down lest  some fool who didn't know the manners of our war take a pot shot at me,  I called out, 'Bill Brayton, you thick-headed rebel, are you well an'  doin' well?'
  &#8220;You ought to have seen him jump. He stopped walkin', dropped his  rifle in the hollow of his arm, looked the way my voice come and called  out, likewise in a loud voice: 'Who's callin' me a thick-headed rebel?  Is it some blue-backed Yankee? You know we see nothin' of you but your  backs. Come out in the light, an' I'll let some sense into you with a  bullet.'
  &#8220;'Oh, no I won't,' says I, still layin' close, an' not mindin' his  taunt 'bout seein' our backs only. 'You couldn't hit me if I stood up  an' marked the place on my chest. Nothin' will save you but them days  on the plain in the blizzards when you was more useful with a shovel  than you are with a rifle, 'cause to-morrow at sunrise we're goin' to  cross this little river and tie all you fellows hand an' foot an' take  you away as prisoners to Washington.'
  &#8220;That made him mighty mad, but the part 'bout the blizzards on the  plains set him to thinkin', too. 'Who in thunderation are you?' sez he.  'You're Bill Brayton, of Tennessee, fightin' in the rebel army, when  you ought to know better,' says I. 'Now, who in thunderation am I?'  'Sufferin' Moses!' says he, 'that voice grows more like his every time  he speaks. It can't be that empty-headed galoot, Dan Whitley, who never  knew nothin' 'bout the rights an' wrongs of the war, an' had to go off  with the Yanks!'
  &#8220;'It's him an' nobody else,' says I, as I rose right up an' stood  there on the bank, 'an' mighty glad am I to see you Bill, an' to know  that your fool head ain't knocked off by a cannon ball.' He shorely  jumped up an' down with pleasure an' he called back: 'The good Lord  certainly watches over them that ain't got any sense. Dan, you  flat-headed, hump-backed, round-shouldered, thin-chested, knock-kneed,  club-footed son of a gun, I was never so glad to see anybody before in  my life.'
  &#8220;His eyes were shinin' with delight an' I know mine was, too.  Reunions of old friends who for all each know have been dead a year or  two, clean blowed to pieces by shells, or shot through by a hundred  rifle bullets are powerful affectin'. He come down to the edge of the  river an' he shot questions across to me, an' I shot questions at him,  an' I felt as if a brother had riz from the dead. An' as we can't shake  hands we reaches out the muzzles of our guns and shakes them towards  each other in the most friendly way. Then another picket comes up,  fellow by name of Henderson, from Mississippi. Bill introduces him to  his good old pal, an' we three have a friendly talk. Guess they're down  there yet, if you want to see 'em. I liked that fellow, Henderson, too,  though he was a powerful boaster.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;Lead on, but don't get us shot.&#8221;
  They went cautiously through the bushes to the bank of the river,  and then the sergeant blew softly between his fingers. Two figures at  once appeared on the other side, and Sergeant Whitley and the boys rose  up.
  &#8220;Mr. Brayton and Mr. Henderson,&#8221; said the sergeant politely, &#8220;I want  to introduce my friends, Lieutenant Mason, Lieutenant Warner and  Lieutenant Pennington.&#8221;
  &#8220;Movin' in mighty good comp'ny, though young, Dan,&#8221; said Brayton,  who was about Whitley's age and build.
  &#8220;They're officers, an' they're young, as you say,&#8221; said Whitley,  &#8220;but they're good ones.&#8221;
  &#8220;Them's the kind we eat alive, when we ain't got anything else to  eat,&#8221; said the Mississippian, a very tall, sallow and youngish man.  &#8220;We're never too strong on rations, and when I eat prisoners I like 'em  under twenty the best. They ain't had time to get tough. I speak right  now for that yellow-haired one in the middle.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can't swallow me,&#8221; said Pennington, good naturedly. &#8220;I'll just  turn myself crossways and stick in your throat.&#8221;
  &#8220;What are you fellows after around here, anyway?&#8221; continued the  Mississippian. &#8220;The weather's hot an' we all want to go in swimmin'  to-morrow, bein' as we have two rivers handy. Shore as you live if you  get to botherin' us we'll hurt you.&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't hurt us,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;because to-morrow we're going to  surround you and drive you into a coop.&#8221;
  &#8220;Drive us in a coop. See here, Yank, you're gettin' excited. Do you  know how many men we have here waitin' for you? Of course you don't.  Why, it's four hundred thousand, ain't it, Bill?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, it's just two hundred thousand. I don't believe in lyin' fur  effect, Jim.&#8221;
  &#8220;I ain't lyin'. There's two hundred thousand men. Then there's Bobby  Lee. That's a hundred thousand more, which makes three hundred  thousand. Then there's Stonewall Jackson, who's another hundred  thousand, which brings the figures up to exactly what I said, four  hundred thousand. Now, ain't I right, Bill?&#8221;
  &#8220;You shorely are, Jim. I was a fool for countin' the way I did. Will  you overlook it this time?&#8221;
  &#8220;Wa'al, I will this time, but be shore you don't do it ag'in. Now,  see here, you Yanks: we like you well enough. You're friends of Bill,  who is a friend of me. Just you take my advice an' go home. Start  to-night while the weather is warm, an' the roads are good. If you're  afraid of our chasin' you we'll give you a runnin' start of a hunderd  miles.&#8221;
  &#8220;Wa'al now, that's right kind of you,&#8221; said Whitley. &#8220;I for one  might take your advice, but I was froze up so much in them wild  mountains an' plains of the northwest that I like to go south when the  winter's comin' on. It's hot now, all right, but in two months the  chilly blasts will be seekin' my marrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was speakin' for your own good,&#8221; said the Mississippian gravely.  &#8220;Anyway, you won't be troubled by the cold weather 'cause if you don't  go back into the no'th where you belong, we'll be takin' you a prisoner  way down south, where you don't belong. But you could have a good time  there. We won't treat you bad. There's fine huntin' for b'ars in the  canebrake an' the rivers an' bayous are full of fish. Your captivity  won't be downright painful on you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Glad to get your welcome, Mr. Henderson,&#8221; said Whitley, &#8220;'cause  we've heard a lot 'bout the hospitality of Mississippi, an' we're  shorely goin' to stretch it. I'm comin', an' I'm bringin' a couple of  hundred thousand fellers 'bout my size with me. Funny thing, we'll all  wear blue coats just alike. Think you'd find room for us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Plenty of it. What was it the feller said&#8212;we welcome you with  bloody hands to hospitable graves&#8212;but we ain't feelin' that way  to-night. Got a plug of terbacker?&#8221;
  The sergeant took out a square of tobacco, cut it in exact halves  with his pocket knife, and tossed one-half across the Antietam, where  it was deftly caught by the Mississippian.
  &#8220;Thanks mightily,&#8221; said Henderson. &#8220;Mr. Commissary Banks used to  supply us with good things, then it was Mr. Commissary Pope, and now I  reckon it'll be Mr. Commissary McClellan. Say, how many fellers have  you got over thar, anyway?&#8221;
  &#8220;When I counted 'em last night,&#8221; replied the sergeant calmly, &#8220;there  was five hundred and twelve thousand two hundred and fifty-three  infantry, sixty-four thousand two hundred and nineteen cavalry an'  three thousand one hundred and seventy-five cannon, but I reckon we'll  receive reinforcements of three hundred thousand before mornin'.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll have more prisoners than I thought. Are you shore them  three hundred thousand reinforcements will get up in time?&#8221;
  &#8220;Quite shore. I've sent 'em word to hurry.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll have to take them, too.&#8221;
  &#8220;Time you fellers quit your talkin',&#8221; said Brayton, &#8220;a major or a  colonel may come strollin' 'long here any minute, an' they don't like  for us fellers to be too friendly. Dan, I'm powerful glad to see you  ag'in, an' I hope you won't get killed. I've a feelin' that you an' me  will be ridin' over the plains once more some day, an' we won't be  fightin' each other. We'll be fightin' Sioux an' Cheyennes an' all that  red lot, just as we did in the old days. Here's a good-bye.&#8221;
  He thrust out the muzzle of his gun, an' Whitley thrust out his.  Then they shook them at each other in friendly salute, and the little  group moved away from the river bank.
  &#8220;I'm glad I've seen Bill again,&#8221; said the sergeant. &#8220;Fine feller an'  that Mississippian with him was quaint like. Mighty big bragger.&#8221;
  &#8220;You did some bragging yourself, sergeant,&#8221; said Dick.
  &#8220;So I did, but it was in answer to Henderson. I'm glad we had that  little talk across the river. It was a friendly thing to do, before we  fall to slaughterin' one another.&#8221;
  They rejoined Colonel Winchester, and Dick worked through a part of  the night carrying orders and other messages. A great movement was  going on. Fresh troops were continually coming up, but there was little  noise beyond the Antietam, although he saw the light of many fires.
  He slept after midnight and awoke at dawn, expecting to go at once  into battle. Some of the troops were moved about and Colonel Winchester  began to rage again.
  &#8220;Good God! can it be possible!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;that another day will  be lost? Is General McClellan instead of General Lee waiting for  Jackson to come? With the enemy safely within the trap, we refuse to  shut it down upon him!&#8221;
  He said these things only within the hearing of Dick, who he knew  would never repeat them. But he was not the only one to complain. Men  higher in rank than he, generals, spoke their discontent openly. Why  would not McClellan attack? He had claimed that the rebels had two  hundred thousand men at the Seven Days, when it was well known that  half that figure or less was their true number. Why should he persist  in seeing the enemy double, and even if Lee did have fifty thousand men  on the other side of the Antietam, instead of the twenty thousand the  scouts assigned to him, the Army of the Potomac could defeat him before  Jackson came up.
  But McClellan was overcome by caution. In spite of everything he  doubled or tripled the numbers of the enemy. Personally brave beyond  dispute, he feared for his army. The position of the enemy on the  peninsula seemed to have changed somewhat through the night. He  believed that the batteries had been moved about, and he telegraphed to  Washington that he must find out exactly the disposition of Lee's  forces and where the fords were.
  Meanwhile the long, hot hours dragged on. The dust trodden up by so  many marching feet was terrible. It hung in clouds and added a sting to  the burning heat. Dick was wild with impatience, but he knew that it  was not worth while to say anything. He, Warner and Pennington, for the  lack of something else to do, lay on the dry grass, whispering and  watching as well as they could what was going on in Sharpsburg.
  Meanwhile Sharpsburg itself seemed a monument to peace. It was deep  in dust and the sun blazed on the roofs. Staff officers rode up, and  when they dismounted they lazily led their horses to the best shade  that could he found. Within a residence Lee sat in close conference  with his lieutenants, Stonewall Jackson and Longstreet. Now and then,  they looked at the reports of brigade commanders and sometimes they  studied the maps of Maryland and Virginia. Lee was calm and confident.  The odds against him&#8212;and he knew what they were&#8212;apparently mattered  nothing.
  He knew the strength and spirit of his army and to what a pitch it  was keyed by victory. Moreover, he knew McClellan, whom he had met at  the Seven Days, and he believed, in truth he felt positive that  McClellan would delay long enough for the remainder of Jackson's troops  to come up. Upon this belief he staked the future of the Confederacy in  the battle to be fought there between the Potomac and the Antietam. His  troops were worn by battles and tremendous marches. Jackson's men in  three days had marched sixty miles, and had fought a battle at Harper's  Ferry within that time, also, taking more than thirteen thousand  prisoners. Never before had the foot cavalry marched so hard.
  The men in gray, ragged and many of them barefooted, slept in the  woods about Sharpsburg all through the hot hours of the day. Their  officers had told them that the drums and bugles would call them when  needed, and they sank quietly into the deepest of slumbers. From where  they lay Red Hill, a spur of a mountain, separated them from the Union  army. It was only those like Dick and his comrades who mounted  elevations and who had powerful field glasses who could see into  Sharpsburg. The main Union force saw only the top of a church spire or  two in the village. But each felt fully the presence of the other and  knew that the battle could not be delayed long.
  Dick, in his anxiety and excitement, fell asleep. The heat and the  waiting seemed to overpower him. He did not know how long he had slept,  but he was awakened by the sharp call of a trumpet, and when he sprang  to his feet Warner told him it was about four o'clock.
  &#8220;What's up?&#8221; he cried, as he wiped the haze of heat and dust from  his eyes.
  &#8220;We're about to march,&#8221; replied Warner, &#8220;but as it's so late in the  day I don't think it can be a general attack. Still, I know that our  division is going to cross the Antietam. Up here the stream is narrower  than it is down below, and the banks are not so high. Look, the colonel  is beckoning to us! Here we go!&#8221;
  They sprang upon their horses, and a great corps advanced toward the  Antietam, far above the town of Sharpsburg. The sun had declined in the  West, and a breeze, bringing a little coolness, had begun to blow. They  did not see much preparation for defense beyond the river, but as they  advanced some cannon in the woods opened there. The Union cannon  replied, and then the brigades in blue moved forward swiftly.
  The officers and the cavalry galloped their horses into the little  river and Dick felt a fierce joy as the water was dashed into his face.  This was action, movement, the attack that had been delayed so long but  which was not yet too late. He thought nothing of the shells hissing  and shrieking over his head, and he shouted with the others in  exultation as they passed the fords of the Antietam and set foot on the  peninsula. The cannon dashed after them through the stream and up the  bank.
  A heavy rifle fire from the woods met them, but the triumphant  division pressed on. They were held back at the edge of the woods by  cannon aiding the rifles, and for some time a battle swayed back and  forth, but the Confederate resistance ceased suddenly. Infantry and  batteries disappeared in woods or beyond a ridge, and then Dick noticed  that night was coming. The sun was already hidden by the lofty slopes  of the western mountains, and there would be no battle that day. In  another half hour full darkness would be upon them.
  But Dick felt that something had been achieved. A powerful Union  force was now beyond the Antietam, with its feet rooted firmly in the  soil of the peninsula. It looked directly south at the Confederate army  and there was no barrier between. Lee would have to face at once,  Hooker on the north and McClellan on the east across the Antietam. The  Union army had been numerous enough to outflank him.
  Dick was quite sure of success now. They had lost two of the most  precious of all days instead of one, but they had closed the gap on the  north, through which Lee's army might march in an attempt to escape. It  was likely, too, that the last of Jackson's men would come that way and  the Union force would cut them off from Lee. Two entire army corps were  now beyond the Antietam, and they should be able to do anything.
  The Winchester regiment lay in deep woods, and the great division  although it had rested nearly all the day was quiet in the night. But  some ardent souls could not rest. A group of officers, including  Colonel Winchester and the three young members of his staff, walked  forward through the woods, taking the chance of stray shots from  sentinels or skirmishers. But they knew that this risk was not great.
  They passed near a mill, its wheels and saws silent now, and  presently as the moon rose they saw the square white walls of a  building shining in its light.
  &#8220;The Dunkard church,&#8221; said one of the officers. &#8220;I think we'd better  not go any closer. The Johnnies must be lying thick close at hand.&#8221;
  &#8220;The dim light off to the right must be made by their fires,&#8221; said  Colonel Winchester. &#8220;I wish I knew what troops they are. Jackson's  perhaps. It's a rough country, and all these forests and ridges and  hills will help the defense. I understand that the farms in here are  surrounded by stone fences and that, too, will help the Johnnies.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we'll get 'em,&#8221; said another confidently. &#8220;The battle can't be  put off any longer, and we're bound to smash 'em in the morning.&#8221;
  They remained in the darkness for a while, trying to see what was  passing toward the Southern lines, but they could see little. There was  some rifle firing after a while, and the occasional deep note of a  cannon, mostly at random and the little group walked back.
  &#8220;I'm going to sleep, Dick,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;I've just remembered that  I'm an invalid and that if I overtask myself it will be a bad thing for  McClellan to-morrow. The colonel doesn't want us any longer, and so  here goes.&#8221;
  &#8220;I follow,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;The dry earth is good enough for me.  May I stay on top of it for the next half century.&#8221;
  Warner and Pennington slept quickly, but Dick lay awake a long time,  listening to the stray rifle shots and the distant boom of a cannon at  far intervals. After a while, he looked at his watch and saw that it  was midnight. It was more than an hour later when slumber overtook him,  and while he and his comrades lay there the last of Jackson's men were  coming with the help that Lee needed so sorely.
  Two divisions which had been left at Harper's Ferry started at  midnight just as Dick was looking at his watch and at dawn they were  almost to the Potomac. On their flank was a cavalry brigade and A. P.  Hill was hurrying with another of infantry. Messenger after messenger  from them came to Lee that on the fateful day they with their fourteen  thousand bayonets would be in line when they were needed most.
  Few of those who fought for the Lost Cause ever cherished anything  more vividly than those hours between midnight and the next noon when  they marched at the double quick across hill and valley and forest to  the relief of their great commander. There was little need for the  officers to urge them on, and at sunrise the rolling of the cannon was  calling to them to come faster, always faster.
