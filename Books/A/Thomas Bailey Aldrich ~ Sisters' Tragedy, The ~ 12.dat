Who can say where Echo dwells?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In some mountain-cave, methinks,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the white owl sits and blinks;<br> Or in deep sequestered dells,<br> Where the foxglove hangs its bells,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Echo dwells.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Echo!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Echo!
