  The closing of the Academy made quite a difference in the life of  Centreville. The number of boarding scholars was about thirty, and  these, though few in number, were often seen in the street and at the  postoffice, and their withdrawal left a vacancy. Harry Walton felt  quite lonely at first; but there is no cure for loneliness like  occupation, and he had plenty of that. The greater part of the day was  spent in the printing office, while his evenings and early mornings  were occupied in study and reading. He had become very much interested  in French, in which he found himself advancing rapidly. Occasionally he  took tea at Mr. Ferguson's, and this he always enjoyed; for, as I have  already said, he and Ferguson held very similar views on many important  subjects. One evening, at the house of the latter, he saw a file of  weekly papers, which proved, on examination, to be back numbers of the  &#8220;Weekly Standard,&#8221; a literary paper issued in Boston.
  &#8220;I take the paper for my family,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;It contains quite  a variety of reading matter, stories, sketches and essays.&#8221;
  &#8220;It seems quite interesting,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Yes, it is. I will lend you some of the back numbers, if you like.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would like it. My father never took a literary paper; his means  were so limited that he could not afford it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think it is a good investment. There are few papers from which  you cannot obtain in a year more than the worth of the subscription.  Besides, if you are going to be an editor, it will be useful for you to  become familiar with the manner in which such papers are conducted.&#8221;
  When Harry went home he took a dozen copies of the paper, and sat up  late reading them. While thus engaged an idea struck him. It was this:  Could not he write something which would be accepted for publication in  the &#8220;Standard&#8221;? It was his great ambition to learn to write for the  press, and he felt that he was old enough to commence.
  &#8220;If I don't succeed the first time, I can try again,&#8221; he reflected.
  The more he thought of it, the more he liked the plan. It is very  possible that he was influenced by the example of Franklin, who, while  yet a boy in his teens, contributed articles to his brother's paper  though at the time the authorship was not suspected. Finally he decided  to commence writing as soon as he could think of a suitable subject.  This he found was not easy. He could think of plenty of subjects of  which he was not qualified to write, or in which he felt little  interest; but he rightly decided that he could succeed better with  something that had a bearing upon his own experience or hopes for the  future.
  Finally he decided to write on Ambition.
  I do not propose to introduce Harry's essay in these pages, but will  give a general idea of it, as tending to show his views of life.
  He began by defining ambition as a desire for superiority, by which  most men were more or less affected, though it manifested itself in  very different ways, according to the character of him with whom it was  found. Here I will quote a passage, as a specimen of Harry's style and  mode of expression.
  &#8220;There are some who denounce ambition as wholly bad and to be  avoided by all; but I think we ought to make a distinction between true  and false ambition. The desire of superiority is an honorable motive,  if it leads to honorable exertion. I will mention Napoleon as an  illustration of false ambition, which is selfish in itself, and has  brought misery and ruin, to prosperous nations. Again, there are some  who are ambitious to dress better than their neighbors, and their  principal thoughts are centred upon the tie of their cravat, or the cut  of their coat, if young men; or upon the richness and style of their  dresses, if they belong to the other sex. Beau Brummel is a noted  instance of this kind of ambition. It is said that fully half of his  time was devoted to his toilet, and the other half to displaying it in  the streets, or in society. Now this is a very low form of ambition,  and it is wrong to indulge it, because it is a waste of time which  could be much better employed.&#8221;
  Harry now proceeded to describe what he regarded as a true and  praiseworthy ambition. He defined it as a desire to excel in what would  be of service to the human race, and he instanced his old Franklin,  who, induced by an honorable ambition, worked his way up to a high  civil station, as well as a commanding position in the scientific  world. He mentioned Columbus as ambitious to extend the limits of  geographical knowledge, and made a brief reference to the difficulties  and discouragements over which he triumphed on the way to success. He  closed by an appeal to boys and young men to direct their ambition into  worthy channels, so that even if they could not leave behind a great  name, they might at least lead useful lives, and in dying have the  satisfaction of thinking that they done some service to the race.
  This will give a very fair idea of Harry's essay. There was nothing  remarkable about it, and no striking originality in the ideas, but it  was very creditably expressed for a boy of his years, and did even more  credit to his good judgment, since it was an unfolding of the  principles by which he meant to guide his own life.
  It must not be supposed that our hero was a genius, and that he  wrote his essay without difficulty. It occupied him two evenings to  write it, and he employed the third in revising and copying it. It  covered about five pages of manuscript, and, according to his estimate,  would fill about two-thirds of a long column in the &#8220;Standard.&#8221;
  After preparing it, the next thing was to find a<I> nom de plume</I>, for he shrank from signing his own name. After long consideration, he  at last decided upon Franklin, and this was the name he signed to his  maiden contribution to the press.
  He carried it to the post-office one afternoon, after his work in  the printing office was over, and dropped it unobserved into the  letter-box. He did not want the postmaster to learn his secret, as he  would have done had he received it directly from him, and noted the  address on the envelope.
  For the rest of the week, Harry went about his work weighed down  with his important secret&#8212;a secret which he had not even shared with  Ferguson. If the essay was declined, as he thought it might very  possibly be, he did not want any one to know it. If it were accepted,  and printed, it would be time enough then to make it known. But there  were few minutes in which his mind was not on his literary venture. His  preoccupation was observed by his fellow-workmen in the office, and he  was rallied upon it, good-naturedly, by Ferguson, but in a different  spirit by Clapp.
  &#8220;It seems to me you are unusually silent, Harry,&#8221; said Ferguson.  &#8220;You're not in love, are you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; said Harry, smiling. &#8220;It's rather too early  yet.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've known boys of your age to fancy themselves in love.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is is more likely thinking up some great discovery,&#8221; said Clapp,  sneering. &#8220;You know he's a second Franklin.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you for the compliment,&#8221; said our hero, good-humoredly, &#8220;but  I don't deserve it. I don't expect to make any great discovery at  present.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose you expect to set the river on fire, some day,&#8221; said  Clapp, sarcastically.
  &#8220;I am afraid it wouldn't do much good to try,&#8221; said Harry, who was  too sensible to take offence. &#8220;It isn't so easily done.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose some day we shall be proud of having been in the same  office with so great a man,&#8221; pursued Clapp.
  &#8220;Really, Clapp, you're rather hard on our young friend,&#8221; said  Ferguson. &#8220;He doesn't put on any airs of superiority, or pretend to  anything uncommon.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's very kind&#8212;such an intellect as he's got, too!&#8221; said Clapp.
  &#8220;I'm glad you found it out,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I haven't a very high idea  of my intellect yet. I wish I had more reason to do so.&#8221;
  Finding that he had failed in his attempt to provoke Harry by his  ridicule, Clapp desisted, but he disliked him none the less.
  The fact was, that Clapp was getting into a bad way. He had no high  aim in life, and cared chiefly for the pleasure of the present moment.  He had found Luke Harrison a congenial companion, and they had been  associated in more than one excess. The morning previous, Clapp had  entered the printing office so evidently under the influence of liquor,  that he had been sharply reprimanded by Mr. Anderson.
  &#8220;I don't choose to interfere with your mode of life, unwise and  ruinous as I may consider it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as long as it does not  interfere with your discharge of duty. But to-day you are clearly  incapacitated for labor, and I have a right to complain. If it happens  again, I shall be obliged to look for another journeyman.&#8221;
  Clapp did not care to leave his place just at present, for he had no  money saved up, and was even somewhat in debt, and it might be some  time before he got another place. So he rather sullenly agreed to be  more careful in future, and did not go to work till the afternoon. But  though circumstances compelled him to submit, it put him in bad humor,  and made him more disposed to sneer than ever. He had an unreasoning  prejudice against Harry, which was stimulated by Luke Harrison, who had  this very sufficient reason for hating our hero, that he had succeeded  in injuring him. As an old proverb has it &#8220;We are slow to forgive those  whom we have injured.&#8221;
