  Whenever Godfrey Preston had any difficulty with his father, he  always went to his mother, and from her, right or wrong, he was sure to  obtain sympathy. So in the present instance, failing to receive from  his father that moral support to which he deemed himself entitled, on  entering the house he sought out his mother.
  Mrs. Preston, who was rather a spare lady, with thin lips and a  sharp, hatchet-like face, was in her own room. She looked up as Godfrey  entered.
  &#8220;Well, Godfrey, what's the matter?&#8221; she asked, seeing on her son's  face an unmistakable expression of discontent.
  &#8220;Matter enough, mother. Father's always against me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know it. He appears to forget that you are his son. What is it  now?&#8221;
  &#8220;He came up just as I was thrashing a boy down in the yard.&#8221;
  &#8220;What boy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nobody you know, mother. It was only an Irish boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;What was your reason for punishing him?&#8221; asked Mrs. Preston,  adopting Godfrey's version of the affair.
  &#8220;He was impudent to me. He was leaning against the fence, and I  ordered him away. He was a ragged boy, with a bundle on a stick. Of  course, when he wouldn't move, I went out and thrashed him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Was your father there?&#8221;
  &#8220;He came up in the midst of it, and, instead of taking my part, he  took the part of the Irish boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see how Mr. Preston can be so unfair,&#8221; said his wife. &#8220;It  is his duty to stand by his family.&#8221;
  &#8220;I felt ashamed to have him scold me before the impudent boy. Of  course, he enjoyed it, and I suppose he will think he can be impudent  to me again.&#8221;
  &#8220;No doubt. I will speak to your father about it. He really shouldn't  be so inconsiderate. But what is that stain on your coat, Godfrey? I  should think you had been down on your back on the ground.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Godfrey, rather embarrassed, &#8220;I happened to slip as I was  wrestling with the fellow, and fell on my back. However, I was up again  directly and gave it to him, I can tell you. If father hadn't stopped  me I'd have laid him out,&#8221; he continued, in a swaggering tone.
  It will be seen that Godfrey did not always confine himself to the  truth. Indeed, he found it rather hard at all times to admit either  that he had been in the wrong or had been worsted. Even if his mother  sometimes suspected that his accounts were a trifle distorted, she  forbore to question their accuracy. Mother and son had a sort of tacit  compact by which they stood by each other, and made common cause  against Colonel Preston.
  &#8220;Don't you know the boy? Doesn't he live in the neighborhood?&#8221; asked  Mrs. Preston, after a pause.
  &#8220;He's just come into the town, but I'll tell you who he is. He's the  son of that woman that comes to work for you once a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mrs. Burke?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; he told me that his name was Andy Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;He ought to know his place too well to be impudent to one in your  position.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I think.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall speak to Mrs. Burke about her son's bad behavior.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you'd discharge her. That's a good way to punish the boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shouldn't object to doing that, Godfrey, but Mrs. Burke is a  capital hand at ironing shirts. Yours and your father's never looked so  nice as they have since she has been here.&#8221;
  Godfrey looked a little discontented. Being essentially mean, he  thought it would be an excellent plan to strike the son through the  mother.
  &#8220;You might threaten her, mother, a little. Tell her to make her boy  behave himself, or you'll discharge her.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will certainly speak to her on the subject, Godfrey.&#8221;
  At the table Mrs. Preston introduced the subject of Godfrey's  wrongs.
  &#8220;I am surprised, Mr. Preston, that you took part against Godfrey  when he was rudely assaulted this morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought Godfrey in the wrong, my dear. That was my reason.&#8221;
  &#8220;You generally appear to think your own son in the wrong. You are  ready to take part with any stranger against him,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston,  in a complaining manner.
  &#8220;I don't think you are quite right just there,&#8221; said her husband,  good-humoredly. &#8220;I must say, however, that Godfrey generally is in the  wrong.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are very unjust to him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't mean to be. I would be glad to praise him, but he is so  overbearing to those whom he considers his inferiors, that I am  frequently ashamed of his manner of treating others.&#8221;
  &#8220;The boy has some reason to feel proud. He must maintain his  position.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is his position?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think you need to ask. As our son he is entitled to a  degree of consideration.&#8221;
  &#8220;He will receive consideration enough if he deserves it, but this is  a republic, and all are supposed to be on an equality.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston tossed her head.
  &#8220;That's well enough to say, but don't you consider yourself above a  man that goes round sawing wood for a living?&#8221;
  &#8220;At any rate I would treat him with courtesy. Because I am richer,  and have a better education, it is no reason why I should treat him  with contempt.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I don't share your sentiments,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston. &#8220;I am  thankful that I know my position better. I mean to uphold the dignity  of the family, and I hope my son will do the same.&#8221;
  Colonel Preston shrugged his shoulders as his wife swept from the  room. He knew of old her sentiments on this subject, and he was aware  that she was not likely to become a convert to his more democratic  ideas.
  &#8220;I am afraid she will spoil Godfrey,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;The boy is  getting intolerable. I am glad this Irish boy gave him a lesson. He  seems a fine-spirited lad. I will help him if I can.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ellen,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston the next morning, &#8220;when Mrs. Burke comes  let me know.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, ma'am.&#8221;
  &#8220;She's come,&#8221; announced Ellen, half an hour later.
  Mrs. Preston rose from her seat and went into the laundry.
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mrs. Preston,&#8221; said Mrs. Burke.
  &#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; returned the other, stiffly. &#8220;Mrs. Burke, I hear  that your son behaved very badly to my Godfrey yesterday.&#8221;
  &#8220;It isn't like Andy, ma'am,&#8221; said the mother, quietly. &#8220;He's a good,  well-behaved lad.&#8221;
  &#8220;Godfrey tells me that he made a brutal assault upon him, quite  forgetting his superior position.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you sure Master Godfrey didn't strike him first?&#8221; asked the  mother.
  &#8220;Even if he had, your son shouldn't have struck back.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Mrs. Burke, her eyes flashing with spirit, meek as  she generally was.
  &#8220;Because it was improper,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, decisively.
  &#8220;I don't see that, ma'am. Andy isn't the boy to stand still and be  struck.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do I understand,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, in a freezing tone, &#8220;that you  uphold your son in his atrocious conduct?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, ma'am. I stand up for Andy, for he's a good boy, and if he  struck Master Godfrey it was because he was struck first.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is enough,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, angrily. &#8220;I shall not require  your services after to-day, Mrs. Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just as you like, ma'am,&#8221; said Mrs. Burke, with quiet pride, but  she thought, with a sinking heart, of the gap which this would make in  her scanty income.
