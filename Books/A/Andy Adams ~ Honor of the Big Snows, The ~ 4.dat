  In the days that followed, there came other things which Jan could  not  understand, and which he made no great effort to understand. He  talked  little, even to Cummins. He listened, and his eyes would  answer, or he  would reply with strange, eery little hunches of his  shoulders, which  ruffled up his hair. To the few simple souls at the  post, he brought  with him more than his starved body from out of the  unknown  wilderness. This was the chief cause of those things which he  could  not understand. 
  No man learned more of him than had Cummins. Even to Mukee, his   history was equally simple and short. Always he said that he came from   out of the north&#8212;which meant the Barren Lands; and the Barren Lands   meant death. No man had ever come across them as Jan had come; and at   another time, and under other circumstances, Cummins and his people   would have believed him mad. 
  But others had listened to that strange, sweet music that came to  them  from out of the forest on the night when the woman died, and  they,  like Cummins, had been stirred by thrilling thoughts. They knew  little  of God, as God is preached; but they knew a great deal about  Him in  other ways. They knew that Jan Thoreau had come like a  messenger from  the angels, that the woman's soul had gone out to meet  him, and that  she had died sweetly on John Cummins' breast while he  played. So the  boy, with his thin, sensitive face and his great,  beautiful eyes,  became a part of what the woman had left behind for  them to love. As a  part of her they accepted him, without further  questioning as to who  he was or whence he came. 
  In a way, he made up for her loss. The woman had brought something  new  and sweet into their barren lives, and he brought something new  and  sweet&#8212;the music of his violin. He played for them in the evening,  in  the factor's office; and at these times they knew that Cummins'  wife  was very near to them and that she was speaking to them through  the  things which Jan Thoreau played. 
  Music had long passed out of their lives. Into some, indeed, it had   never come. Years ago, Williams had been at a post where there was an   accordion. Cummins had heard music when he went down to civilization   for his wife, more than two years ago. To the others it was mystery   which stirred them to the depths of their souls, and which revealed to   them many things that had long been hidden in the dust of the past. 
  These were hours of triumph for Jan in the factor's office. Perched  on  a box, with his back to the wall, his head thrown back, his black  eyes  shining, his long hair giving to his face a half savage beauty,  he was  more than king to the grim-visaged men about him. They  listened,  movelessly, soundlessly; and when he stopped there was still  neither  move nor sound until he had wrapped his violin in its  bear-skin and  had returned to John Cummins and the little M&eacute;lisse. Jan  understood  the silence, and took it for what it meant. 
  But it was the audience in the little cabin that Jan liked best,  and,  most of all, he loved to have the little M&eacute;lisse alone. As the  days of  early spring trapping approached, and the wilderness for a  hundred  miles around the post was crisscrossed with the trails of the  Cree and  Chippewayan fur-seekers, Cummins was absent for days at a  time,  strengthening the company's friendships, and bargaining for the  catch  that would be coming to market about eight weeks later. 
  This was a year of intense rivalry, for the R&eacute;villons, French   competitors of the company, had established a post two hundred miles   to the west, and rumor spread that they were to give sixty pounds of   flour to the company's forty, and four feet of cloth to the yard. This   meant action among Williams and his people, and the factor himself   plunged into the wilderness. Mukee, the half-Cree, went among his   scattered tribesmen along the edge of the barrens, stirring them by   the eloquence of new promises and by fierce condemnation of the   interlopers to the west. Old Per-ee, with a strain of Eskimo in him,   went boldly behind his dogs to meet the little black people from   farther north, who came down after foxes and half-starved polar bears   that had been carried beyond their own world on the ice-floes of the   preceding spring. Young Williams, the factor's son, followed after   Cummins, and the rest of the company's men went into the south and   east. 
  The exodus left desolate lifelessness at the post. The windows of  the  fireless cabins were thick with clinging frost. There was no  movement  in the factor's office. The dogs were gone, and wolves and  lynx  sniffed closer each night. In the oppression of this desertion,  the  few Indian and half-breed children kept indoors, and Williams'   Chippewayan wife, fat and lazy, left the company's store securely   locked. 
  In this silence and lifelessness Jan Thoreau felt a new and ever-   increasing happiness. To him the sound of life was a thing vibrant   with harshness; quiet&#8212;the dead, pulseless quiet of lifelessness&#8212;was   beautiful. He dreamed in it, and it was then that his fingers   discovered new things in his violin. 
  He often sent Maballa, the Indian woman who cared for M&eacute;lisse, to   gossip with Williams' wife, so that he was alone a great deal with the   baby. At these times, when the door was safely barred against the   outside world, it was a different Jan Thoreau who crouched upon his   knees beside the cot. His face was aflame with a great, absorbing   passion which at other times he concealed. His beautiful eyes glowed   with hidden fires, and he whispered soothing, singsong things to the   child, and played softly upon his violin, leaning his black head far   down so that the baby M&eacute;lisse could clutch her appreciative fingers in   his hair. 
  &quot;Ah, ze sweet leetle white angel!&quot; he would cry, as she tugged and   kicked. &quot;I luf you so&#8212;I luf you, an' will stay always, ah' play ze   violon! Ah, mon Dieu, you will be ze gr-r-r-eat bea-utiful white angel   lak&#8212;HER!&quot; 
  He would laugh and coo like a mother, and talk, for at these times  Jan  Thoreau's tongue was as voluble as his violin. 
  Sometimes M&eacute;lisse listened as if she understood the wonderful  things  he was telling her. She would lie upon her back with her eyes  fixed  upon him, her little red fists doubled over his bow, or a thumb  thrust  into her mouth. And the longer she lay like this, gazing at him   blankly, the more convinced Jan became that she was understanding him;   and his voice grew soft and low, and his eyes shone with a soft mist   as he told her those things which John Cummins would have given much   to know. 
  &quot;Some day you shall understand why it happened, sweet M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he   whispered, bringing his eyes so near that she reached up an inquiring   finger to them. &quot;Then you will luf Jan Thoreau!&quot; 
  There were other times when Jan did not talk, but when the baby   M&eacute;lisse talked to him; and these were moments of even greater joy.   With the baby wriggling and kicking, and making queer noises in her   tiny cot, he would sit silently upon his heels, watching her with the   pride and happiness of a mother lynx in the first tumbling frolics of   her kittens. 
  Once, when M&eacute;lisse straightened herself for an instant, and half   reached up her tiny arms to him, laughing and cooing into his face, he   gave a glad cry, crushed his face down to hers, and did what he had   not dared to do before&#8212;kissed her. There was something about it that   frightened the little M&eacute;lisse, and she set up a wailing that sent Jan,   in a panic of dismay, for Maballa. It was a long time before he   ventured to kiss her again. 
  It was during this fortnight of desolation at the post that Jan   discovered the big problem for himself and John Cummins. In the last   days of the second week, he spent much of his time skirting the edge   of the barrens in search of caribou, that there might be meat in   plenty when the dogs and men returned a little later. One afternoon,   he returned early, while the pale sun was still in the sky, laden with   the meat of a musk-ox. As he came from the edge of the forest, his   slender body doubled over under the weight of his pack, a terrifying   sight greeted him in the little clearing at the post. 
  Upon her knees in front of their cabin was Maballa, industriously   rolling the half-naked little M&eacute;lisse about in a soft pile of snow,   and doing her work, as she firmly believed, in a most faithful and   thorough manner. With a shriek, Jan threw off his pack and darted   toward her like a wild thing. 
  &quot;Sacre bleu&#8212;you keel&#8212;keel ze leetle M&eacute;lisse!&quot; he cried shrilly,   snatching up the half-frozen child, &quot;Mon Dieu, she ees not papoose!   She ees ceevilize&#8212;ceevilize!&quot; and he ran swiftly with her into the   cabin, flinging back a torrent of Cree anathema at the dumbly   bewildered Maballa. 
  Jan left the rest of his musk-ox to the wolves and foxes. He went  out  into the snow, and found half a dozen other snow-wallows in which  the  helpless M&eacute;lisse had taken her chilling baths. He watched Maballa  with  a new growing terror, and fifty times a day he said to her: 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse ees not papoose! She ees ceevilize&#8212;lak HER!&quot; And he would   point to the lonely grave under the guardian spruce. 
  At last Maballa went into an ecstasy of understanding. M&eacute;lisse was  not  to be taken out and rolled in the snow; so she brought in the snow  and  rolled it over M&eacute;lisse! 
  When Jan discovered this, his tongue twisted itself into sounds so   terrible, and his face writhed so fiercely, that Maballa began to   comprehend that thereafter no snow at all, either out doors or in, was   to be used in the physical development of the little M&eacute;lisse. 
  This was the beginning of the problem, and it grew and burst forth  in  all its significance on the day before Cummins came in from the   wilderness. 
  For a week Maballa had been dropping sly hints of a wonderful thing   which she and the factor's half-breed wife were making for the baby.   Jan had visions of a gorgeous garment covered with beads and gaudy   braid, which would give the little M&eacute;lisse unending delight. On the   day before Cummins' arrival, Jan came in from chopping wood, and went   to the cot. It was empty. Maballa was gone. A sudden fear thrilled him   to the marrow, and he sprang back to the cabin door, ready to shriek   out the Indian woman's name. 
  A sound stopped him&#8212;the softest, sweetest sound in all the world  to  Jan Thoreau&#8212;and he whirled around like a cat. M&eacute;lisse was smiling  and  making queer, friendly little signals to him from the table. She  was  standing upright, wedged in a coffin-shaped thing from which only  her  tiny white face peered out at him; and Jan knew that this was   Maballa's surprise, M&eacute;lisse was in a papoose-sling! 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse, I say you shall be no papoose!&quot; he cried, running to the   table. &quot;You ees ceevilize! You shall be no papoose&#8212;not if twen'   t'ous'nd devil come tak Jan Thoreau!&quot; 
  And he snatched her from her prison, flung Maballa's handiwork out   into the snow, and waited impatiently for the return of John Cummins.
