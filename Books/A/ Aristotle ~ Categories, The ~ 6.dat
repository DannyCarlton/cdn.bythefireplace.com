Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some  quantities are such that each part of the whole has a relative  position to the other parts: others have within them no such  relation of part to part.    
Instances of discrete quantities are number and speech; of  continuous, lines, surfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and  place.    
In the case of the parts of a number, there is no common boundary  at which they join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two  fives have no common boundary, but are separate; the parts three  and seven also do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize,  would it ever be possible in the case of number that there should  be a common boundary among the parts; they are always separate.  Number, therefore, is a discrete quantity.    
The same is true of speech. That speech is a quantity is evident:  for it is measured in long and short syllables. I mean here that  speech which is vocal. Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for  its parts have no common boundary. There is no common boundary at  which the syllables join, but each is separate and distinct from  the rest.    
A line, on the other hand, is a continuous quantity, for it is  possible to find a common boundary at which its parts join. In  the case of the line, this common boundary is the point; in the  case of the plane, it is the line: for the parts of the plane  have also a common boundary. Similarly you can find a common  boundary in the case of the parts of a solid, namely either a  line or a plane.    
Space and time also belong to this class of quantities. Time,  past, present, and future, forms a continuous whole. Space,  likewise, is a continuous quantity; for the parts of a solid  occupy a certain space, and these have a common boundary; it  follows that the parts of space also, which are occupied by the  parts of the solid, have the same common boundary as the parts of  the solid. Thus, not only time, but space also, is a continuous  quantity, for its parts have a common boundary.    
Quantities consist either of parts which bear a relative position  each to each, or of parts which do not. The parts of a line bear  a relative position to each other, for each lies somewhere, and  it would be possible to distinguish each, and to state the  position of each on the plane and to explain to what sort of part  among the rest each was contiguous. Similarly the parts of a  plane have position, for it could similarly be stated what was  the position of each and what sort of parts were contiguous. The  same is true with regard to the solid and to space. But it would  be impossible to show that the arts of a number had a relative  position each to each, or a particular position, or to state what  parts were contiguous. Nor could this be done in the case of  time, for none of the parts of time has an abiding existence, and  that which does not abide can hardly have position. It would be  better to say that such parts had a relative order, in virtue of  one being prior to another. Similarly with number: in counting,  'one' is prior to 'two', and 'two' to 'three', and thus the parts  of number may be said to possess a relative order, though it  would be impossible to discover any distinct position for each.  This holds good also in the case of speech. None of its parts has  an abiding existence: when once a syllable is pronounced, it is  not possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the parts do  not abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities  consist of parts which have position, and some of those which  have not.    
Strictly speaking, only the things which I have mentioned belong  to the category of quantity: everything else that is called  quantitative is a quantity in a secondary sense. It is because we  have in mind some one of these quantities, properly so called,  that we apply quantitative terms to other things. We speak of  what is white as large, because the surface over which the white  extends is large; we speak of an action or a process as lengthy,  because the time covered is long; these things cannot in their  own right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance, should  any one explain how long an action was, his statement would be  made in terms of the time taken, to the effect that it lasted a  year, or something of that sort. In the same way, he would  explain the size of a white object in terms of surface, for he  would state the area which it covered. Thus the things already  mentioned, and these alone, are in their intrinsic nature  quantities; nothing else can claim the name in its own right,  but, if at all, only in a secondary sense.    
Quantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities  this is obvious; thus, there is nothing that is the contrary of  'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits long', or of a surface, or  of any such quantities. A man might, indeed, argue that 'much'  was the contrary of 'little', and 'great' of 'small'. But these  are not quantitative, but relative; things are not great or small  absolutely, they are so called rather as the result of an act of  comparison. For instance, a mountain is called small, a grain  large, in virtue of the fact that the latter is greater than  others of its kind, the former less. Thus there is a reference  here to an external standard, for if the terms 'great' and  'small' were used absolutely, a mountain would never be called  small or a grain large. Again, we say that there are many people  in a village, and few in Athens, although those in the city are  many times as numerous as those in the village: or we say that a  house has many in it, and a theatre few, though those in the  theatre far outnumber those in the house. The terms 'two cubits  long, "three cubits long,' and so on indicate quantity, the terms  'great' and 'small' indicate relation, for they have reference to  an external standard. It is, therefore, plain that these are to  be classed as relative.    
Again, whether we define them as quantitative or not, they have  no contraries: for how can there be a contrary of an attribute  which is not to be apprehended in or by itself, but only by  reference to something external? Again, if 'great' and 'small'  are contraries, it will come about that the same subject can  admit contrary qualities at one and the same time, and that  things will themselves be contrary to themselves. For it happens  at times that the same thing is both small and great. For the  same thing may be small in comparison with one thing, and great  in comparison with another, so that the same thing comes to be  both small and great at one and the same time, and is of such a  nature as to admit contrary qualities at one and the same moment.  Yet it was agreed, when substance was being discussed, that  nothing admits contrary qualities at one and the same moment. For  though substance is capable of admitting contrary qualities, yet  no one is at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at  the same time both white and black. Nor is there anything which  is qualified in contrary ways at one and the same time.    
Moreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be  contrary to themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of  'small', and the same thing is both great and small at the same  time, then 'small' or 'great' is the contrary of itself. But this  is impossible. The term 'great', therefore, is not the contrary  of the term 'small', nor 'much' of 'little'. And even though a  man should call these terms not relative but quantitative, they  would not have contraries.    
It is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears  to admit of a contrary. For men define the term 'above' as the  contrary of 'below', when it is the region at the centre they  mean by 'below'; and this is so, because nothing is farther from  the extremities of the universe than the region at the centre.  Indeed, it seems that in defining contraries of every kind men  have recourse to a spatial metaphor, for they say that those  things are contraries which, within the same class, are separated  by the greatest possible distance.    
Quantity does not, it appears, admit of variation of degree. One  thing cannot be two cubits long in a greater degree than another.  Similarly with regard to number: what is 'three' is not more  truly three than what is 'five' is five; nor is one set of three  more truly three than another set. Again, one period of time is  not said to be more truly time than another. Nor is there any  other kind of quantity, of all that have been mentioned, with  regard to which variation of degree can be predicated. The  category of quantity, therefore, does not admit of variation of  degree.    
The most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and  inequality are predicated of it. Each of the aforesaid quantities  is said to be equal or unequal. For instance, one solid is said  to be equal or unequal to another; number, too, and time can have  these terms applied to them, indeed can all those kinds of  quantity that have been mentioned.    
That which is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be  termed equal or unequal to anything else. One particular  disposition or one particular quality, such as whiteness, is by  no means compared with another in terms of equality and  inequality but rather in terms of similarity. Thus it is the  distinctive mark of quantity that it can be called equal and  unequal.
