  There was a rattling of knives and forks, a clink of glasses, and a   buzz of conversation. Doctor Mack was able to hear considerable of it.   There were anecdotes of the professors, accounts of narrow escapes   from &quot;flunking&quot; in the recitation-room, and remarks by no means   complimentary to some of the text-books in use in college. It was   evident that the collegians assembled cared more for a good time than   for study. Yet these seemed to be the chosen associates of his ward,   the doctor reflected. 
  As the feast proceeded, he grew more sober. He felt that college  life,  however much it was doing for the faithful students, was only   fostering self-indulgence in his ward. 
  &quot;Something must be done!&quot; reflected Doctor Mack. &quot;Desperate  diseases  require desperate remedies.&quot; 
  Again the chairman rapped for order, and again Walter's voice was   heard. 
  &quot;Brothers,&quot; he said, &quot;the material part of our banquet is ended. We   have gratified our appetites with the savory dishes provided by our   friend Daniels. We have quaffed the rare Falernian wine, of a vintage   unknown to Horace; we have quickened our wits, as I trust, under those   favorable conditions, and the time has now come for the feast of   reason and the flow of soul. Exhausted as we are by our labors in the   classroom&quot;&#8212;great laughter&#8212;&quot;we have sought refreshment in the way   that is most agreeable. It's a way we have at old Euclid! Sing!&quot; 
  Immediately the assembled company started up the well-known college   song: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive dull care away. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive dull care away. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And we think it is no sin, sir, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the Freshmen in, sir, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ease them of their tin, sir, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive dull care away. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a way we have at old Euclid, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive dull care away.&quot; 
  There were other verses, but these will serve as specimens. All  joined  in the chorus, and Doctor Mack, who remembered his own college  life,  felt almost tempted to add his voice to those of the young men  in the  opposite room. 
  &quot;But, pshaw!&quot; he thought. &quot;What would Walter and his friends think  to  hear an old graybeard like me taking part in the convivial songs?   There is no great harm in singing college songs, if it is accompanied   by good work in the recitation-room.&quot; 
  &quot;Brothers,&quot; resumed Walter, &quot;we will do our best to drive dull care   away. Let us forget, this happy evening, that there are such things as   logarithms, and sines, and tangents, and Greek tragedies. To-night our   hearts shall be uplifted by sentiment and song. Brother Corbett, you   will oblige us with 'Rumsty Ho!'&quot; 
  A young man with a pleasant voice sang this song, one unfamiliar to   the doctor: 
  &quot;A beggar man laid himself down to sleep, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho! <BR> &nbsp;A beggar man laid himself down to sleep <BR> &nbsp;By the banks of the Mersey, so high and steep, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho! 
  &quot;Two thieves came walking by that way, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho! <BR> &nbsp;Two thieves came walking by that way, <BR> &nbsp;And they came to the place where the old man lay, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho! 
  &quot;They stole his wallet and they stole his staff, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho! <BR> &nbsp;They stole his wallet and they stole his staff, <BR> &nbsp;And then broke out in a great horse-laugh, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!&quot; 
  There was more of this song, too. Next came &quot;Crambambuli,&quot; and then   &quot;Cocach-lunk&quot; both of which were familiar to the doctor. 
  Then Walter said: &quot;Brothers, I have great pleasure in stating that   Professor Griggs has concluded to honor our dinner by his learned   presence, and has consented to address us. Permit me to introduce   Professor Theophilus Griggs.&quot; 
  One of the company had made up as the mathematical professor. In a   nasal tone he made a rambling speech, in which he introduced   mathematical allusions, and used some of the favorite phrases of the   rather dull and prosy instructor, with whom all the students were   familiar, some to their sorrow. It seemed to be very amusing to the   boys present, as shown by their hearty laughter, but of course Doctor   Mack could not appreciate it. 
  Other songs and other speeches followed. Though for the most part   college songs, there were some of a more serious character. Time   slipped by, and at length Doctor Mack saw by his watch that it was   half-past eleven. 
  &quot;How long will they keep it up, I wonder?&quot; he asked himself. &quot;I  feel  drowsy.&quot; 
  He was answered by the chairman. 
  &quot;Brothers,&quot; he said, &quot;time waits for no man. The hour has arrived   when, according to agreement, we must wind up our festivities. Hand in   hand we will sing 'Auld Lang Syne,' hoping, at some auspicious season   after the coming vacation is over, to have another good time. I thank   you all for accepting my invitation, and hope you have enjoyed   yourselves.&quot; 
  &quot;Three cheers for Sherwood!&quot; cried one of the company. 
  They were given with a will. Then the parting song was sung, and  the  students retired to their rooms in one of the college dormitories. 
  Doctor Mack went thoughtfully to bed. 
  &quot;It is well I came,&quot; he reflected. &quot;Walter has done nothing  decidedly  wrong as yet, but it is evident he is not improving.&quot; 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said James Holdens as he met Doctor Mack the next morning,   &quot;did you hear the boys last night?&quot; 
  &quot;I couldn't very well help it,&quot; answered the doctor, smiling. &quot;That   young Sherwood seems to be very popular.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; he is very free with his money.&quot; 
  &quot;In what other way does he spend it?&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Daniels keeps half a dozen horses to let to students and  others.  Sherwood hires a team at least twice a week, and of course it  counts  up.&quot; 
  &quot;I was not able to spend money in that way when I attended  college.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you are a college graduate?&quot; said Holden. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Did you graduate at Euclid?&quot; 
  &quot;No; I am a Yale man.&quot; 
  &quot;I congratulate you, sir; I should like to graduate from Yale. 
  &quot;I hope you may, some time, my young friend. You would derive more   benefit, I'll be bound, than those young roysterers of last evening.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope they didn't keep you awake, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;They certainly did as long as they stayed. I should have gone to  bed  soon afterward, but that I had something on my mind. By the way,  don't  mention to any of the students that they had an unseen  listener.&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir.&quot; 
  Doctor Mack took the first train after breakfast, and returned to  his  home without seeing his ward. 
  Nancy Sprague questioned him eagerly. 
  &quot;And how is Master Walter?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;Very well, indeed, Nancy.&quot; 
  &quot;Was he surprised to see you?&quot; &quot;He didn't see me, Nancy.&quot; 
  &quot;He didn't see you!&quot; ejaculated the housekeeper. 
  &quot;No; the fact was, I went away on a matter of business, and it was  not  convenient to call on Walter. But I heard him.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see how you could have been near him without seeing him.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall see him soon, Nancy, and so will you. In two weeks  vacation  will be here. Examinations are near, and I might have  interfered with  his studies,&quot; the doctor added, with a little innocent  evasion. 
  &quot;To be sure, sir! To be sure! I make no doubt Master Walter is a  great  scholar.&quot; 
  &quot;I have very strong doubts on that point myself,&quot; thought Doctor  Mack,  but he did not care to express himself thus to Nancy. 
  &quot;I am so glad the dear boy is coming home soon,&quot; murmured the   housekeeper. &quot;He has been studying so hard he needs a good long rest.   I will make some cookies expressly for him after he comes. I don't   believe he gets any at college.&quot; 
  &quot;I wonder what Nancy would say if she could have seen Walter  presiding  at the supper, and heard the songs?&quot; thought Doctor Mack.
