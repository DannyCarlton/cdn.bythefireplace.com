    Late in the afternoon of the third day subsequent a man and a boy   might have been seen riding slowly through a rocky canon probably   eighty miles west from San Francisco. Both were mounted on the small   native horses of California, generally called mustangs. These  animals  possess a strength disproportioned to their size, and show  great  endurance. At times they have a playful habit of bucking, not  quite  agreeable to an inexperienced horseman. 
  The reader will already have guessed that the two riders are Jake   Bradley and Ben. The mustangs were on a walk, being apparently weary   with the day's tramp. 
  &quot;Well, Ben,&quot; said Bradley, &quot;what do you say to camping out for the   night?&quot; 
  &quot;I have no objection,&quot; said Ben, &quot;and I don't think my horse has.&quot; 
  &quot;He is better off than mine, having less to carry. Are you tired?&quot; 
  &quot;Not very tired, but my limbs are rather stiff.&quot; 
  &quot;What hotel shall we put up at, Ben?&quot; asked Bradley, with a  humorous  glance about him. 
  &quot;There isn't much choice,&quot; said Ben. &quot;The Canon Hotel seems to be   the only one that is open hereabouts. The only objection is, that we   shall have to sleep on the floor, with the windows all open.&quot; 
  &quot;That's about so, Ben,&quot; assented Bradley, laughing. &quot;I shouldn't   mind sleeping in a Christian bed to-night myself. Well, here goes!&quot; 
  As he spoke, he jumped from the back of his horse, and, taking out  a  rope, tethered it to a tree hard by. 
  Ben followed his example. 
  &quot;Now for the grub,&quot; said Bradley. &quot;I'm powerfully empty myself.  This  ridin' all day up and down hill is wearin' to the stomach. What  do  you say?&quot; 
  &quot;I've got a healthy appetite myself, Jake.&quot; 
  &quot;This yere Canon Hotel that you was talkin' about ain't  first-class.  It don't supply anything but cold victuals. Now, ef we  had a cup of  coffee to wash it down, and kinder warm us up, it would  go to the  right spot, eh, Ben?&quot; 
  &quot;You are right, Jake! but please don't speak of it again. It makes   my mouth water.&quot; 
  &quot;Stay here a few minutes, Ben, and I'll reconnoiter a little.   Perhaps I can find a better place for campin'.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, Jake!&quot; 
  While Bradley was absent Ben threw himself on the ground, and began   to think. It was the third day of the expedition. Ben enjoyed riding   through this new, unsettled country. He almost felt in the solitudes   of the woods and hills as if he were the original explorer of this   far-distant country. He was more than three thousand miles away from   his native town, entrusted with a mission of importance. The thought   was gratifying to his boyish fancy, and inspired him with a new  sense  of power and increased his self-reliance. He was glad,  however, to  have the company of Jake Bradley. He was ready to  acknowledge that his  chances of success, had he started alone, would  have been much  smaller, and certainly he would have found it  exceedingly lonesome. 
  His companion was not a man of culture, nor were his tastes   elevated, but there was a rough honesty about him, and a good humor,   which made him an agreeable companion. Besides, he knew the country,   and Ben felt secure in leaving the conduct of the trip to him. 
  &quot;I am glad I came out here,&quot; thought Ben, as, with his head  pillowed  on his knapsack, he looked up through the branches of the  tall trees  to the blue sky beyond. &quot;It's better than staying at home  and  working for Deacon Pitkin, or blacking boots for Sam Sturgis. Here  I  am my own man, free and don't need to run at anybody's bidding.&quot; 
  Probably most boys of Ben's age share his love of independence, but   it is neither practicable nor desirable that at sixteen a boy should   be his own master, much as he may desire it. In the case of our  hero,  circumstances had thrown him upon his own resources, and it  may be  added that he could better be trusted with the management of  himself  than most boys. 
  Ben's reverie was broken in upon by the return of his companion. 
  &quot;What are you dreamin' about, Ben?&quot; queried Jake. 
  &quot;I was thinking about home, Jake.&quot; 
  &quot;This don't look much like it, eh, Ben?&quot; 
  &quot;Not much.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, my lad, I've found something,&quot; continued Bradley. 
  &quot;Found something? What! a nugget?&quot; exclaimed Ben, in excitement. 
  &quot;Not much. This ain't the place for such a find as that.&quot; 
  &quot;What, then, Jake?&quot; 
  &quot;I've found a hotel.&quot; 
  &quot;Where?&quot; asked Ben eagerly. 
  &quot;Get up and stand by me. There! look yonder. What do you see?&quot; 
  &quot;It looks like smoke.&quot; 
  &quot;It is smoke. There's a cabin yonder. I've reconnoitered, and I  seed  the door open, and a woman inside. Now, I'm going to ask her to  give  us some supper and a bed. Won't that be fine?&quot; 
  &quot;Splendid, Jake!&quot; 
  &quot;Then unhitch that animal of yours, and we'll put our best foot   forrards, and maybe we'll get a hot supper and a Christian bed to   sleep in.&quot;
