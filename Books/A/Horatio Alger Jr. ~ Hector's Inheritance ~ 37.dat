    Armed with the affidavits which were to restore to him the position   in life of which his uncle had wickedly deprived him, Hector  returned  to San Francisco. He found Gregory unaffectedly glad to see  him. 
  &quot;Glad to see you back, Hector,&quot; he said; &quot;I missed you.&quot; 
  Hector was glad to find that Gregory had not taken advantage of his   absence to indulge in any of his old excesses. He began to hope that   he had already turned over the new leaf which was so desirable. 
  &quot;I know what you are thinking of,&quot; said Gregory, after Hector had   returned his salutation. &quot;You are wondering whether I 'cut up' any   while you were gone.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't look as if you had,&quot; said Hector, smiling. 
  &quot;No; I have had enough of sowing wild oats. It doesn't pay. Shall I   tell you what I did last evening?&quot; 
  &quot;If you like.&quot; 
  &quot;I attended a lecture illustrated with the stereopticon. I was in   bed at ten.&quot; 
  &quot;Gregory,&quot; said Hector, taking his hand, &quot;you don't know how glad I   am to hear this. I am sure your uncle will be delighted when you   return to him so changed.&quot; 
  &quot;I've made a great fool of myself,&quot; said Gregory, candidly.   &quot;Hereafter I am going to make you my model.&quot; 
  Hector blushed deeply, for he was a modest boy. 
  &quot;You compliment me too much, Gregory,&quot; he said. &quot;Still, if you are   in earnest, I will try to set you a good example.&quot; 
  &quot;You won't have any trouble in doing that. You are one of the   fellows that find it easy to be good.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not sure of that, Gregory. Still, I mean to do my best.&quot; 
  In the evening the two boys attended a theatrical performance. It   was not till after eleven o'clock that they emerged from the  theatre,  and slowly, not by the most direct way, sauntered home. 
  There was no thought of danger in the mind of either, yet, as a   fact, Hector had never in his life been exposed to peril so serious   as that evening. Lurking behind in the shadow a shabby-looking man   followed the two boys, keeping his eyes steadily on Hector. At a   place specially favorable, our hero was startled by hearing a bullet   whiz by his ear. He turned instantly, and so did Gregory. They saw a   man running, and they pursued him. They might not have caught up  with  him, but that he stumbled and fell. Instantly they were upon  him. 
  &quot;Well,&quot; he said, sullenly, &quot;you've caught me after all.&quot; 
  &quot;Were you the man who fired at me?&quot; asked Hector, &quot;or was it my   friend here you sought to kill?&quot; 
  &quot;I was firing at you,&quot; answered their captive, coolly. &quot;Now, what   are you going to do with me?&quot; 
  &quot;Was this forced upon you by want? Did you wish to rob me?&quot; 
  &quot;No; I had another motive.&quot; 
  &quot;What was it?&quot; 
  &quot;If I tell you, will you let me go free?&quot; 
  Hector hesitated. 
  The man proceeded, speaking with emphasis. 
  &quot;If I tell you who put me up to this, and furnish you proofs so  that  you can bring it to him, will you let me go?&quot; 
  &quot;You will not renew the attempt?&quot; asked Hector. 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered the man; &quot;it isn't likely; I shall have no further   motive.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I agree.&quot; 
  &quot;Read that letter, then.&quot; 
  &quot;There isn't light enough. Will you accompany me to the hotel,  where  I can read it?&quot; 
  &quot;I will.&quot; 
  The three walked together to the hotel, where Hector and Gregory   were staying. There Hector read the letter. He was astonished and   horrified when he discovered that it was from his uncle to this man,   with whom he seemed to have an acquaintance, describing Hector, and   promising him a thousand dollars if he would put him out of the way. 
  &quot;This is very important,&quot; said Hector, gravely. &quot;Are you ready to   accompany me to New York and swear to this?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, if you will pay my expenses.&quot; 
  By the next steamer Hector, Gregory and the stranger, who called   himself Reuben Pearce, sailed for New York.
