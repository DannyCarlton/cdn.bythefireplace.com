  Harry slept like one dead, but he was awakened at dawn, and he rose  yet  heavy with sleep and somewhat stiff from the severe exertions of  the day  before.  But it all came back in an instant, the army, the  march, and the  march yet to come. 
  They had but a scanty breakfast, the wagons not yet having come up,   and in a half hour they started again.  They grumbled mightily at  first,  because the day was bleak beyond words, heavy with clouds, and  sharp with  chill.  The country seemed deserted and certainly that  somber air was  charged with no omens of victory. 
  But in spite of everything the spirits of the young troops began to  rise.  They took a pride in this defiance of nature as well as man.   They could  endure cold and hunger and weariness as they would endure  battle, when it  came.  They went on thus three days, almost without  food and shelter.  Higher among the hills the snow sometimes beat upon  them in a hurricane,  and at night the winds howled as if they had come  down fresh from the  Arctic. 
  The spirits of the young troops, after rising, fell again, and  their feet  dragged.  Jackson, always watching, noticed it.  Beckoning  to several of  his staff, including Harry, he rode back along the  lines, giving a word  of praise here and two words of rebuke there.   They came at last to an  entire brigade, halted by the roadside, some  of the men leaning against  an old rail fence. 
  Jackson looked at the men and his face darkened.  It was his own   Stonewall Brigade, the one of which he was so proud, and which he had  led  in person into the war.  Their commander was standing beside a  tree,  and riding up to him he demanded fiercely: 
  &#8220;What is the meaning of this?  Why have you stopped?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I ordered a stop of a little while for the men to cook their  rations,&#8221;  replied General Garnett. 
  Jackson's face darkened yet further, and the blue eyes were  menacing. 
  &#8220;There is no time for that,&#8221; he said sharply. 
  &#8220;But the men can't go any farther without them.  It's impossible.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I never found anything impossible with this brigade.&#8221; 
  Jackson shot forth the words as if they were so many bullets, gave   Garnett a scornful look and rode on.  Harry followed him, as was his  duty,  but more slowly, and looked back.  He saw a deep red flush show  through  Garnett's sunburn.  But the preparations for cooking were  stopped  abruptly.  Within three minutes the Stonewall Brigade was in  line again,  marching resolutely over the frozen road.  Garnett had  recognized that  the impossible was possible&#8212;at least where Jackson  led. 
  Not many stragglers were found as they rode on toward the rear, but  every  regiment increased its speed at sight of the stern general.   After  circling around the rear he rode back toward the front, and he  left Harry  and several others to go more slowly along the flanks and  report to him  later. 
  When Harry was left alone he was saluted with the usual  good-humored  chaff by the soldiers who again demanded his horse of  him, or asked him  whether they were to fight or whether they were  training to be foot-  racers.  Harry merely smiled, and he came  presently to the Invincibles,  who were trudging along stubbornly, with  the officers riding on their  flanks.  Langdon was as cheerful as  usual. 
  &#8220;Things have to come to their worst before they get better,&#8221; he  said to  Harry, &#8220;and I suppose we've about reached the worst.  A sight  of the  enemy would be pleasant, even if it meant battle.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We're marching on Bath,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and we ought to strike it  to-night,  though I'm afraid the Yankees have got warning of our  coming.&#8221; 
  He was thinking of Shepard, who now loomed very large to him.  The   circumstances of their meetings were always so singular that this   Northern scout and spy seemed to him to possess omniscience.  Beyond a   doubt he would notify every Northern garrison he could reach of  Jackson's  coming. 
  Suddenly the band of South Carolinians, who were still left in the   Invincibles, struck up a song: 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Ho, woodsmen of the mountain-side! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, dwellers in the vales! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ho, ye who by the chafing tide <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have roughened in the gales! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave barn and byre, leave kin and cot, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay by the bloodless spade: <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let desk and case and counter rot, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn your books of trade!&#8221; 
  All the Invincibles caught the swing and rush of the verses, and   regiments before them and behind them caught the time, too, if not the   words.  The chant rolled in a great thundering chorus through the  wintry  forest.  It was solemn and majestic, and it quickened the blood  of these  youths who believed in the cause for which they fought, just  as those on  the other side believed in theirs. 
  &#8220;It was written by one of our own South Carolinians,&#8221; said St.  Clair,  with pride.  &#8220;Now here goes the second verse!  Lead off, there,  Langdon!  They'll all catch it!&#8221; 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The despot roves your fairest lands; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And till he flies or fears, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fields must grow but armed bands <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sheaves be sheaves of spears: <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give up to mildew and to rust <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The useless tools of gain <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feed your country's sacred dust <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With floods of crimson rain!&#8221; 
  Louder and louder swelled the chorus of ten thousand marching men.   It was not possible for the officers to have stopped them had they  wished  to do so, and they did not wish it.  Stonewall Jackson, who had  read and  studied much, knew that the power of simple songs was  scarcely less than  that of rifle and bayonet, and he willingly let  them sing on.  Now and  then, a gleam came from the blue eyes in his  tanned, bearded face. 
  Harry, sensitive and prone to enthusiasm, was flushed in every vein  by  the marching song.  He seemed to himself to be endowed with a new  life of  vigor and energy.  The invader trod the Southern land and they  must rush  upon him at once.  He was eager for a sight of the blue  masses which they  would certainly overcome. 
  He returned to his place near the head of the column with the staff  of  the commander.  Night was now close at hand, but Bath was still  many  miles away.  It was colder than ever, but the wagons had not yet  come up  and there were no rations and tents.  Only a few scraps of  food were left  in the knapsacks. 
  &#8220;Ride to Captain Sherburne,&#8221; said General Jackson to Harry, &#8220;and  tell him  to go forward with his men and reconnoiter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;May I go with him, sir?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, and then report to me what he and his men find.&#8221; 
  Harry galloped gladly to the vanguard, where the gallant young  captain  and his troop were leading.  These Virginians preserved their  fine  appearance.  If they were weary they did not show it.  They sat  erect in  their saddles and the last button on their uniforms was in  place.  Their polished spurs gleamed in the wintry sun. 
  They set off at a gallop, Harry riding by the side of Captain  Sherburne.  Blood again mounted high with the rapid motion and the  sense of action.  Soon they left the army behind, and, as the road was  narrow and shrouded  in forest, they could see nothing of it.  Its  disappearance was as  complete as if it had been swallowed up in a  wilderness. 
  They rode straight toward Bath, but after two or three miles they   slackened speed.  Harry had told Sherburne of the presence of Shepard  the  night before, and the captain knew that they must be cautious. 
  Another mile, and at a signal from the captain the whole troop  stopped.  They heard hoofbeats on the road ahead of them, and the sound  was coming  in their direction. 
  &#8220;A strong force,&#8221; said Captain Sherburne. 
  &#8220;Probably larger than ours, if the hoofbeats mean anything,&#8221; said  Harry. 
  &#8220;And Yankees, of course.  Here they are!&#8221; 
  A strong detachment of cavalry suddenly rounded a curve in the road  and  swept into full view.  Then the horsemen stopped in astonishment  at the  sight of the Confederate troop. 
  There was no possibility of either command mistaking the other for  a  friend, but Sherburne, despite his youth, had in him the instinct  for  quick perception and action which distinguished the great cavalry  leaders  of the South like Jeb Stuart, Turner Ashby and others.  He  drew his men  back instantly somewhat in the shelter of the trees and  received the  Union fire first. 
  As Sherburne had expected, few of the Northern bullets struck home.   Some knocked bark from the trees, others kicked up dirt from the  frozen  road, but most of them sang vainly through the empty air and  passed far  beyond.  Now the Southerners sent their fire full into the  Union ranks,  and, at Sherburne's shouted command, charged, with their  leader at their  head swinging his sword in glittering circles like  some knight of old. 
  The Southern volley had brought down many horses and men, but the   Northern force was double in numbers and many of the men carried new   breech-loading rifles of the best make.  While unused to horses and   largely ignorant of the country, they had good officers and they stood   firm.  The Southern charge, meeting a second volley from the breech-   loading rifles, broke upon their front. 
  Harry, almost by the side of Sherburne, felt the shock as they  galloped  into the battle smoke, and then he felt the Virginians reel.   He heard  around him the rapid crackle of rifles and pistols, sabers  clashing  together, the shouts of men, the terrible neighing of wounded  horses,  and then the two forces drew apart, leaving a sprinkling of  dead and  wounded between. 
  It was a half retreat by either, the two drawing back sixty or  seventy  yards apiece and then beginning a scattered and irregular fire  from the  rifles.  But Sherburne, alert always, soon drew his men into  the shelter  of the woods, and attempted an attack on his enemy's  flank. 
  Some destruction was created in the Union ranks by the fire from  the  cover of the forest, but the officers of the opposing force showed  skill,  too.  Harry had no doubt from the way the Northern troops were  handled  that at least two or three West Pointers were there.  They  quickly fell  back into the forest on the other side of the road, and  sent return  volleys. 
  Harry heard the whistle and whizz of bullets all about them.  Bark  was  clipped from trees and dry twigs fell.  Yet little damage was done  by  either.  The forest, although leafless, was dense, and trunks and  low  boughs afforded much shelter.  Both ceased fire presently, seeming  to  realize at the same moment that nothing was being done, and hovered  among  the trees, each watching for what the other would try next. 
  Harry kept close to Captain Sherburne, whose face plainly showed  signs of  deep disgust.  His heart was full of battle and he wished to  get at the  enemy.  But prudence forbade another charge upon a force  double his  numbers and now sheltered by a wood.  At this moment it was  the boy  beside him who was cooler than he. 
  &#8220;Captain Sherburne,&#8221; he suggested mildly, &#8220;didn't General Jackson  merely  want to find out what was ahead of him?  When the army comes up  it will  sweep this force out of its way.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; agreed Sherburne reluctantly, &#8220;but if we retire  they'll  claim a victory, and our men will be depressed by the  suspicion of  defeat.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But the Yankees are retiring already.  Look, you can see them   withdrawing!  They were on the same business that we were, and it's  far  more important for them to be sure that Jackson is advancing than  it is  for us to know that an enemy's in front.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're right.  We knew already that he was there, and we were  watching  to get him.  It's foolish for us to stay here, squabbling  with a lot of  obstinate Yankees.  We'll go back to Jackson as fast as  we can.  You're a  bright boy, Harry.&#8221; 
  He dropped a hand affectionately on Harry's shoulder, then gave the  order  to the men and they turned their horses' heads toward the army.   At the  same time they saw with their own eyes the complete withdrawal  of the  Union troops, and the proud Virginians were satisfied.  It was  no defeat.  It was merely a parting by mutual consent, each moving at  the same  instant, that is, if the Yankees didn't go first. 
  They galloped back over the frozen road, and Captain Sherburne  admitted  once more to himself the truth of Harry's suggestion.   Already the  twilight was coming, and again it was heavy with clouds.   In the east all  the peaks and ridges were wrapped about with them,  and the captain knew  that they meant more snow.  Heavy snow was the  worst of all things for  the advance of Jackson. 
  Captain Sherburne gave another signal to his men and they galloped   faster.  The hoofbeats of nearly two hundred horses rang hard on the   frozen road, but with increased speed pulses throbbed faster and  spirits  rose.  The average age of the troops was not over twenty, and  youth  thought much of action, little of consequences. 
  They saw in a half hour the heads of columns toiling up the slopes,   and then Jackson riding on Little Sorrel, his shoulders bent forward   slightly, the grave eyes showing that the great mind behind them was   still at work, planning, planning, always planning.  Their expression  did  not change when Sherburne, halting his horse before him, saluted   respectfully. 
  &#8220;What did you find, Captain Sherburne?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;The enemy, sir.  We ran into a force of cavalry about four hundred   strong.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And then?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We had a smart little skirmish with them, sir, and then both sides   withdrew.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Undoubtedly they went to report to their people, as you have come  to  report to yours.  It looks as if our attempt to surprise Bath might  fail,  but we'll try to reach it to-night.  Lieutenant Kenton, ride  back and  give the brigade commanders orders to hasten their march.&#8221; 
  He detached several others of his staff for the same duty, and in  most  cases wrote brief notes for them.  Harry noticed how he took it  for  granted that one was always willing to do work, and yet more work.   He himself had just ridden back from battle, and yet he was sent   immediately on another errand.  He noticed, too, how it set a new   standard for everybody.  This way Jackson had of expecting much was   rapidly causing his men to offer much as a matter of course. 
  While Jackson was writing the notes to the brigadiers he looked up  once  or twice at the darkening skies.  The great mass of clouds,  charged with  snow that had been hovering in the east, was now directly  overhead.  When he had finished the last note it was too dark for him  to write any  more without help of torch.  As he handed the note to the  aide who was to  take it, a great flake of snow fell upon his hand. 
  Harry found that the brigades could move no faster.  They were  already  toiling hard.  The twilight had turned to night, and the  clouds covered  the whole circle of the heavens.  The snow, slow at  first, was soon  falling fast.  The soldiers brushed it off for a  while, and then, feeling  that it was no use, let it stay.  Ten  thousand men, white as if wrapped  in winding sheets, marched through  the mountains.  Now and then, a thin  trickle of red from a foot,  encased in a shoe worn through, stained the  snow. 
  The wind was not blowing, and the night, reinforced by the clouds,   became very dark, save the gleam from the white covering of snow upon  the  earth.  Torches began to flare along the line, and still Jackson  marched.  Harry knew what was in his mind.  He wished to reach Bath  that night and  fall upon the enemy when he was not expected, even  though that enemy had  been told that Jackson was coming.  The  commander in front, whoever he  might be, certainly would expect no  attack in the middle of the night and  in a driving snowstorm. 
  But the fierce spirit of Jackson was forced to yield at last.  His  men,  already the best marchers on the American continent, could go no  farther.  The order was given to camp.  Harry more than guessed how  bitter was the  disappointment of his commander, and he shared it. 
  The men, half starved and often stiff with cold, sank down by the   roadside.  They no longer asked for the wagons containing their food  and  heavy clothing, because they no longer expected them.  They passed  from  high spirits to a heavy apathy, and now they did not seem to care  what  happened.  But the officers roused them up as much as possible,  made them  build fires with every piece of wood they could find, and  then let them  wrap themselves in their blankets and go to sleep&#8212;save  for the sentinels. 
  All night long the snow beat on Jackson's army lying there among  the  mountains, and save for a few Union officers not far away, both  North and  South wondered what had become of it. 
  It was known at Washington and Richmond that Jackson had left  Winchester,  and then he had dropped into the dark.  The eyes of the  leaders at both  capitals were fixed upon the greater armies of  McClellan and Johnston,  and Stonewall Jackson was not yet fully  understood by either.  Nevertheless, the gaunt and haggard President of  the North began to feel  anxiety about this Confederate leader who had  disappeared with his army  in the mountains of Northern Virginia. 
  The telegraph wires were not numerous then, but they were kept busy   answering the question about Jackson.  Banks and the other Union  leaders  in the valley sent reassuring replies.  Jackson would not dare  to attack  them.  They had nearly three times as many men as he, and it  did not  matter what had become of him.  If he chose to come, the  sooner he came,  the sooner he would be annihilated.  McClellan himself  laughed at the  fears about Jackson.  He was preparing his own great  army for a march on  Richmond, one that would settle everything. 
  But the army of Jackson, nevertheless, rose from the snow the next   morning, and marched straight on the Union garrison.  The rising was  made  near Bath, and the army literally brushed the snow from itself  before  eating the half of a breakfast, and taking to the road again,  Jackson,  on Little Sorrel, leading them.  Harry, as usual, rode near  him. 
  Harry, despite exertions and hardships which would have overpowered  him  six months before, did not feel particularly hungry or weary that   morning.  No one in the army had caught more quickly than he the  spirit  of Stonewall Jackson.  He could endure anything, and in another  hour or  two they would pass out of this wilderness of forest and snow,  and attack  the enemy.  Bath was just ahead. 
  A thrill passed through the whole army.  Everybody knew that  Jackson was  about to attack.  While the first and reluctant sun of  dawn was trying to  pierce the heavy clouds, the regiments, spreading  out to right and left  to enclose Bath, began to march.  Then the sun  gave up its feeble  attempts, the clouds closed in entirely, the wind  began to blow hard,  and with it came a blinding snow, and then a  bitter hail. 
  Harry had been sent by Jackson to the right flank with orders and  he was  to remain there, unless it became necessary to inform the  commander that  some regiment was not doing its duty.  But he found  them all marching  forward, and, falling in with the Invincibles, he  marched with them.  Yet it was impossible for the lines to retain  cohesion or regularity,  so fierce was the beat of the storm. 
  It was an alternation of blinding snow and of hail that fairly  stung.  Often the officers could not see the men thirty yards distant,  and there  was no way of knowing whether the army was marching forward  in the  complete half circle as planned.  Regiments might draw apart,  leaving  wide gaps between, and no one would know it in all that  hurricane. 
  Harry rode by the side of Colonel Leonidas Talbot and  Lieutenant-Colonel  Hector St. Hilaire, who were leading the  Invincibles in person.  Both had  gray military cloaks drawn around  them, but Harry saw that they were  shivering with cold as they sat on  their horses, with the snow  accumulating on their shoulders and on the  saddles around them.  In truth,  the foot cavalry had rather the better  of it, as the hard marching kept  up the circulation. 
  &#8220;Not much like the roses of Charleston,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot,  faintly  smiling. 
  &#8220;But I'm glad to be here,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;although I will admit, sir,   that I did not expect a campaign to the North Pole.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Neither did I, but I'm prepared for anything now, under the  commander  that we have.  Bear in mind, my young friend, that this is  for your  private ear only.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course, sir!  What was that?  Wasn't it a rifle shot?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The report is faint, but it was certainly made by a rifle.  And  hark,  there are others!  We've evidently come upon their outposts!   Confound  this storm!  It keeps us from seeing more than twenty yards  in front of  us!&#8221; 
  The scattered rifle fire continued, and the weary soldiers raised  their  heads which they had bent to shelter their eyes from the driving  snow and  hail.  Pulses leaped up again, and blood sparkled.  The whole  army rushed  forward.  The roofs of houses came into view, and there  was Bath. 
  But the firing had been merely that of a small rear guard,  skirmishers  who surrendered promptly.  The garrison, warned doubtless  by Shepard,  and then the scouting troop, had escaped across the river,  but Jackson's  wintry march was not wholly in vain.  The fleeing Union  troops had no  time either to carry away or destroy the great stores of  supplies,  accumulated there for the winter, and the starving and  freezing  Southerners plunged at once into the midst of plenty, ample  compensation  to the young privates. 
  The population, ardently Southern, as everywhere in these Virginia  towns,  welcomed the army with wild enthusiasm.  Officers and soldiers  were taken  into the houses, as many as Bath could hold, and enormous  fires were  built in the open spaces for the others.  They also showed  the way at  once to the magazines, where the Union supplies were heaped  up. 
  Harry, at the direction of his general, went with one of the  detachments  to seize these.  Their first prize was an old but large  storehouse,  crammed full of the things they needed most.  The tall  mountain youth,  Seth Moore, was one of his men, and he proved to be a  prince of looters. 
  &#8220;Blankets! blankets!&#8221; cried Moore.  &#8220;Here they are, hundreds of  'em!  An' look at these barrels!  Bacon!  Beef!  Crackers!  An' look at  the  piles of cheese!  Oh, Lieutenant Kenton, how my mouth waters!   Can't I  bite into one o' them cheeses?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Harry, whose own mouth was watering, too, &#8220;but you  can,  Seth, within ten minutes at the farthest.  The whole army must  bite at  once.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's fa'r an' squar', but ain't this richness!  Cove oysters,  cans an'  cans of 'em, an' how I love 'em!  An' sardines, too, lots of  'em!  Why, I could bite right through the tin boxes to get at 'em.  An'  rice,  an' hominy, an' bags o' flour.  Why, the North has been sendin'  whole  train loads of things down here for us to eat!&#8221; 
  &#8220;And she has been sending more than that,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;Here are  five or  six hundred fine breech-loading rifles, and hundreds of  thousands of  cartridges.  She's been sending us arms and ammunition  with which to  fight her!&#8221; 
  His boyish spirit burst forth.  Even though an officer, he could  not  control them, and he was radiant as the looting Seth Moore  himself.  He went out to report the find and to take measures  concerning it.  On his way he met hundreds of the Southern youths who  had already put on  heavy blue overcoats found in the captured stores.   The great revulsion  had come.  They were laughing and cheering and  shaking the hands of one  another.  It was a huge picnic, all the more  glorious because they had  burst suddenly out of the storm and the icy  wilderness. 
  But order was soon restored, and wrapped in warm clothing they  feasted  like civilized men, the great fires lighting up the whole town  with a  cheerful glow.  Harry was summoned to new duties.  He was also  a new man.  Warmth and food had doubled his vitality, and he was ready  for any errand  on which Jackson might send him. 
  While it was yet snowing, he rode with a half dozen troopers toward  the  Potomac.  On the other side was a small town which also held a  Union  garrison.  Scouting warily along the shores, Harry discovered  that the  garrison was still there.  Evidently the enemy believed in  the protection  of the river, or many of their leaders could not yet  wholly believe that  Jackson and his army, making a forced march in the  dead of winter,  were at hand. 
  But he had no doubt that his general would attend to these  obstinate men,  and he rode back to Bath with the news.  Jackson gave  his worn troops a  little more rest.  They were permitted to spend all  that day and night at  Bath, luxuriating and renewing their strength  and spirits. 
  Harry slept, for the first time in many nights, in a house, and he  made  the most of it, because he doubted whether he would have another  such  chance soon.  Dawn found the army up and ready to march away from  this  place of delight. 
  They went up and down the Potomac three or four days, scattering or   capturing small garrisons, taking fresh supplies and spreading   consternation among the Union forces in Northern Virginia and  Maryland.  It was all done in the most bitter winter weather and amid  storms of snow  and hail.  The roads were slippery with sleet, and  often the cavalry were  compelled to dismount and lead their horses  long distances.  There was  little fighting because the Northern enemy  was always in numbers too  small to resist, but there was a great deal  of hard riding and many  captures. 
  News of Jackson's swoop began to filter through to both Richmond  and  Washington.  In Richmond they wondered and rejoiced.  In  Washington they  wondered, but did not rejoice.  They had not expected  there any blow to  be struck in the dead of winter, and Lincoln  demanded of his generals why  they could not do as well.  Distance and  the vagueness of the news  magnified Jackson's exploits and doubled his  numbers.  Eyes were turned  with intense anxiety toward that desolate  white expanse of snow and ice,  in the midst of which he was operating. 
  Jackson finally turned his steps toward Romney, which had been the  Union  headquarters, and his men, exhausted and half starved, once more  dragged  themselves over the sleety roads.  Winter offered a fresh  obstacle at  every turn.  Even the spirits of Harry, who had borrowed  so much from the  courage of Jackson, sank somewhat.  As they pulled  themselves through the  hills on their last stage toward Romney, he was  walking.  His horse had  fallen three times that day on the ice, and  was now too timid to carry  his owner. 
  So Harry led him.  The boy's face and hands were so much chapped  and  cracked with the cold that they bled at times.  But he wasted no  sympathy  on himself.  It was the common fate of the army.  Jackson and  his  generals, themselves, suffered in the same way.  Jackson was  walking, too,  for a while, leading his own horse. 
  Harry was sent back to bring up the Invincibles, as Romney was now  close  at hand, and there might be a fight.  He found his old colonel  and  lieutenant-colonel walking over the ice.  Both were thin, and were  black  under the eyes with privation and anxiety.  These were not in  appearance  the men whom he had known in gay and sunny Charleston,  though in spirit  the same.  They gave Harry a welcome and hoped that  the enemy would wait  for them in Romney. 
  &#8220;I don't think so,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but I've orders for you from  General  Jackson to bring up the Invincibles as fast as possible.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Tell General Jackson that we'll do our best,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot,   as he looked back at his withered column. 
  They seemed to Harry to be withered indeed, they were so gaunt with   hardship and drawn up so much with cold.  Many wore the blue Northern   overcoats that they had captured at Bath, and more had tied up their   throats and ears in the red woolen comforters of the day, procured at  the  towns through which they passed.  They, too, were gaunt of cheek  and  black under the eye like their officers. 
  The Invincibles under urging increased their speed, but not much.   Little reserve strength was left in them.  Langdon and St. Clair, who  had  been sent along the line, returned to Colonel Talbot where Harry  was  still waiting. 
  &#8220;They're not going as fast as a railroad train,&#8221; said Langdon in an  aside  to Harry, &#8220;but they're doing their best.  You can't put in a  well more  than you can take out of it, and they're marching now not on  their  strength, but their courage.  Still, it might be worse.  We  might all be  dead.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But we're not dead, by a big margin, and I think we'll make  another haul  at Romney.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But Old Jack won't let us stay and enjoy it.  I never saw a man so  much  in love with marching.  The steeper the hills and mountains, the  colder  the day, the fiercer the sleet and snow, the better he likes  it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The fellow who said General Jackson didn't care anything about our  feet  told the truth,&#8221; said St. Clair, thoughtfully.  &#8220;The general is  not a  cruel man, but he thinks more of Virginia and the South, and our  cause,  than he does of us.  If it were necessary to do so to win he'd  sacrifice  us to the last man and himself with us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And never think twice before doing it.  You've sized him up,&#8221; said   Harry.  The army poured into Romney and found no enemy.  Again a  garrison  had escaped through the mountain snows when the news reached  it that  Jackson was at hand.  But they found supplies of food, filled  their empty  stomachs, and as Langdon had foretold, quickly started  anew in search of  another enemy elsewhere. 
  But the men finally broke down under the driving of the merciless   Jackson.  Many of them began to murmur.  They had left the bleeding  trail  of their feet over many an icy road, and some said they were  ready to lie  down in the snow and die before they would march another  mile.  A great  depression, which was physical rather than mental, a  depression born of  exhaustion and intense bodily suffering, seized the  army. 
  Jackson, although with a will of steel, was compelled to yield.   Slowly  and with reluctance, he led his army back toward Winchester,  leaving a  large garrison in Romney.  But Harry knew what he had done,  although  nothing more than skirmishes had been fought.  He had cleared  a wide  region of the enemy.  He had inspired enthusiasm in the South,  and he had  filled the North with alarm.  The great movement of  McClellan on Richmond  must beware of its right flank.  A dangerous foe  was there who might  sting terribly, and men had learned already that  none knew when or whence  Jackson might come. 
  A little more than three weeks after their departure Harry and his   friends and the army, except the portion left in garrison at Romney,   returned to Winchester, the picturesque and neat little Virginia city  so  loyal to the South.  It looked very good indeed to Harry as he drew  near.  He liked the country, rolling here and there, the hills crested  with  splendid groves of great trees.  The Little North Mountain a  looming blue  shadow to the west, and the high Massanutton peaks to the  south seemed to  guard it round.  And the valley itself was rich and  warm with the fine  farms spread out for many miles.  Despite the  engrossing pursuit of the  enemy and of victory and glory, Harry's  heart thrilled at the sight of  the red brick houses of Winchester. 
  Here came a period of peace so far as war was concerned, but of  great  anxiety to Harry and the whole army.  The government at Richmond  began to  interfere with Jackson.  It thought him too bold, even rash,  and it  wanted him to withdraw the garrison at Romney, which was  apparently  exposed to an attack by the enemy in great force.  It was  said that  McClellan had more than two hundred thousand men before  Washington,  and an overwhelming division from it might fall at any  time upon the  Southern force at Romney. 
  Harry, being a member of Jackson's staff, and having become a  favorite  with him, knew well his reasons for standing firm.  January,  which had  furnished so fierce a month of winter, was going.  The icy  country was  breaking up under swift thaws, and fields and destroyed  roads were a vast  sea of mud in which the feet of infantry, the hoofs  of horses and the  wheels of cannon would sink deep. 
  Jackson did not believe that McClellan had enough enterprise to  order a  march across such an obstacle, but recognizing the right of  his  government to expect obedience, he sent his resignation to  Richmond.  Harry knew of it, his friends knew of it, and their hearts  sank like  plummets in a pool. 
  Another portion of the Invincibles had been drawn off to reinforce   Johnston's army before Richmond, as they began to hear rumors now that   McClellan would come by sea instead of land, and their places were  filled  with more recruits from the valley of Virginia.  Scarcely a  hundred of  the South Carolinians were left, but the name, &#8220;The  Invincibles&#8221; and the  chief officers, stayed behind.  Jackson had been  unwilling to part with  Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St.  Hilaire, experienced and able  West Pointers.  Langdon and St. Clair  also stayed. 
  Harry talked over the resignation with these friends of his, and  they  showed an anxiety not less than his own.  It had become evident  to the  two veteran West Pointers that Jackson was the man.  Close  contact with  him had enabled them to read his character and immense  determination. 
  &#8220;I hope that our government at Richmond will decline this  resignation and  give him a free hand,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot to Harry.   &#8220;It would be a  terrible loss if he were permitted to drop out of the  army.  I tell you  for your own private ear that I have taken it upon  me to Write a letter  of protest to President Davis himself.  I felt  that I could do so,  because Mr. Davis and myself were associated  closely in the Mexican War.&#8221; 
  The answer came in time from Richmond.  Stonewall Jackson was  retained  and a freer hand was given to him.  Harry and all his  comrades felt an  immense relief, but he did not know until long  afterward how near the  Confederacy had come to losing the great  Jackson. 
  Benjamin, the Secretary of War, and President Davis both were  disposed to  let him go, but the powerful intervention of Governor  Letcher of Virginia  induced them to change their minds.  Moreover,  hundreds of letters from  leading Virginians who knew Jackson well  poured in upon him, asking him  to withdraw the resignation.  So it was  arranged and Jackson remained,  biding his time for the while at  Winchester, until he could launch the  thunderbolt. 
  A pleasant month for Harry, and all the young staff officers passed  at  Winchester.  The winter of intense cold had now become one of  tremendous  rain.  It poured and it poured, and it never ceased to  pour.  Between  Winchester and Washington and McClellan's great army  was one vast flooded  area, save where the hills and mountains stood. 
  But in Winchester the Southern troops were warm and comfortable.   It was  a snug town within its half circle of mountains.  Its brick  and wooden  houses were solid and good.  The young officers when they  went on errands  trod on pavements of red brick, and oaks and elms and  maples shaded them  nearly all the way. 
  When Harry, who went oftenest on such missions, returned to his  general  with the answers, he walked up a narrow street, where the  silver maples,  which would soon begin to bud under the continuous  rain, grew thickest,  and came to a small building in which other  officers like himself wrote  at little tables or waited in full uniform  to be sent upon like errands.  If it were yet early he would find  Jackson there, but if it were late he  would cross a little stretch of  grass to the parsonage, the large and  solid house, where the  Presbyterian minister, Dr. Graham, lived, and  where Jackson, with his  family, who had joined him, now made his home in  this month of  waiting. 
  It was here that Harry came one evening late in February.  It had  been  raining as usual, and he wore one of the long Union overcoats  captured at  Bath, blue then but a faded grayish brown now.  However,  the gray  Confederate uniform beneath it was neat and looked fresh.   Harry was  always careful about his clothing, and the example of St.  Clair inspired  him to greater efforts.  Besides, there was a society  in Winchester,  including many handsome young women of the old Virginia  families, and  even a budding youth who was yet too young for serious  sentimentalism,  could not ignore its existence. 
  It was twilight and the cold rain was still coming down steadily,  as  Harry walked across the grass, and looked out of the wet dusk at  the  manse.  Lights were shining from every window, and there was  warmth  around his heart.  The closer association of many weeks with  Jackson had  not only increased his admiration, but also had given the  general a great  place in the affection that a youth often feels for an  older man whom he  deems a genius or a hero. 
  Harry walked upon a little portico, and taking off the overcoat  shook out  the rain drops.  Then he hung it on a hook against the wall  of the house.  The door was open six inches or so, and a ribbon of  brilliant light from  within fell across the floor of the portico. 
  Harry looked at the light and smiled.  He was young and he loved  gayety.  He smiled again when he heard within the sound of laughter.   Then he  pushed the door farther open and entered.  Now the laughter  rose to a  shout, and it was accompanied by the sound of footsteps.  A  man, thick of  hair and beard, was running down a stairway.  Perched  high upon his  shoulders was a child of three or four years, with both  hands planted  firmly in the thick hair.  The small feet crossed over  the man's neck  kicked upon his chest, but he seemed to enjoy the sport  as much as the  child did. 
  Harry paused and stood at attention until the man saw him.  Then he   saluted respectfully and said to General Jackson: 
  &#8220;I wish to report to you, sir, that I delivered the order to  General  Garnett, as you directed, and here, sir, is his reply.&#8221; 
  He handed a note to the general, who read it, thrust it into his  pocket,  and said: 
  &#8220;That ends your labors for the day, Lieutenant Kenton.  Come in now  and  join us.&#8221; 
  He picked up the child again, and carrying it in his arms, led the  way  into an inner room, where he gave it to a nurse.  Then they passed  into  the library, where Dr. Graham, several generals and two or three  of  Winchester's citizens were gathered. 
  All gave Harry a welcome.  He knew them well, and he looked around  with  satisfaction at the large room, with its rows and rows of books,  bound  mostly in dark leather, volumes of theology, history, essays,  poetry,  and of the works of Walter Scott and Jane Austen.  Jackson  himself was a  rigid Presbyterian, and he and Dr. Graham had many a  long talk in this  room on religion and other topics almost equally  serious. 
  But to-night they were in a bright mood.  A mountaineer had come in  with  four huge wild turkeys, which he insisted upon giving to General  Jackson  himself, and guests had been asked in to help eat them. 
  Nearly twenty people sat around the minister's long table.  The  turkeys,  at least enough for present needs, were cooked beautifully,  and all the  succulent dishes which the great Virginia valleys produce  so fruitfully  were present.  General Jackson himself, at the request  of the minister,  said grace, and he said it so devoutly and so  sincerely that it always  impressed the hearers with a sense of its  reality. 
  It was full dusk and the rain was beating on the windows, when the  black  attendants began to serve the guests at the great board.   Several ladies,  including the general's wife, were present.  The room  was lighted  brilliantly, and a big fire burned in the wide fireplace  at the end.  To Harry, three seats away from General Jackson, there was  a startling  contrast between the present moment and that swift  campaign of theirs  through the wintry mountains where the feet of the  soldiers left bloody  trails on the ice and snow. 
  It was a curious fact that for a few instants the mountain and the  great  cold were real and this was but fancy.  He looked more than once  at the  cheerful faces and the rosy glow of the fire, before he could  convince  himself that he was in truth here in Winchester, with all  this comfort,  even luxury, around him. 
  Sitting next to him was a lady of middle age, Mrs. Howard, of  prominence  in the town and a great friend of the Grahams.  Harry  realized suddenly  that while the others were talking he had said  nothing, and he felt  guilty of discourtesy.  He began an apology, but  Mrs. Howard, who had  known him very well since he had been in  Winchester, learning to call him  by his first name, merely smiled and  the smile was at once maternal and  somewhat sad. 
  &#8220;No apologies are needed, Harry,&#8221; she said in a low tone that the  others  might not hear.  &#8220;I read your thoughts.  They were away in the  mountains  with a marching army.  All this around us speaks of home and  peace,  but it cannot last.  All of you will be going soon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's true, Mrs. Howard, I was thinking of march and battle, and  I  believe you're right in saying that we'll all go soon.  That is what   we're for.&#8221; 
  She smiled again a little sadly. 
  &#8220;You're a good boy, Harry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I hope that you and all  your  comrades will come back in safety to Winchester.  But that is  enough  croaking from an old woman and I'm ashamed of myself.  Did you  ever see a  happier crowd than the one gathered here?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not since I was in my father's house when the relatives would come  to  help us celebrate Christmas.&#8221; 
  &#8220;When did you hear from your father?&#8221; asked Mrs. Howard, whose warm   sympathies had caused Harry to tell her of his life and of his people   whom he had left behind in Kentucky. 
  &#8220;Just after the terrible disaster at Donelson.  He was in the fort,   but he escaped with Forrest's cavalry, and he went into Mississippi to   join the army under Albert Sidney Johnston.  He sent a letter for me  to  my home, Pendleton, under cover to my old teacher, Dr. Russell, who   forwarded it to me.  It came only this morning.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How does he talk?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Hopefully, though he made no direct statement.  I suppose he was  afraid  to do so lest the letter fall into the hands of the Yankees,  but I  imagine that General Johnston's army is going to attack General  Grant's.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If General Johnston can win a victory it will help us  tremendously,  but I fear that man, Grant.  They say that he had no  more men at Donelson  than we, but he took the fort and its garrison.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's true.  Our affairs have not been going well in the West.&#8221; 
  Harry was downcast for a few moments.  Much of their Western news  had  come through the filter of Richmond, but despite the brighter  color that  the Government tried to put on it, it remained black.   Forts and armies  had been taken.  Nothing had been able to stop  Grant.  But youth again  came to Harry.  He could not resist the bright  light and the happy talk  about him.  Bitter thoughts fled. 
  General Jackson was in fine humor.  He and Dr. Graham had started  to  discuss a problem in Presbyterian theology in which both were  deeply  interested, but they quickly changed it in deference to the  younger and  lighter spirits about them.  Harry had never before seen  his general in  so mellow a vein.  Perhaps it was the last blaze of the  home-loving  spirit, before entering into that storm of battle which  henceforth was to  be his without a break. 
  The general, under urging, told of his life as an orphan boy in his   uncle's rough home in the Virginia wilderness, how he had been seized   once by the wanderlust, then so strong in nearly all Americans, and  how  he and his brother had gone all the way down the Ohio to the  Mississippi,  where they had camped on a little swampy island, earning  their living by  cutting wood for the steamers on the two rivers. 
  &#8220;How old were you two then, General?&#8221; asked Dr. Graham. 
  &#8220;The older of us was only twelve.  But in those rough days boys  matured  fast and became self-reliant at a very early age.  We did not  run away.  There wasn't much opposition to our going.  Our uncle was  sure that we'd  come back alive, and though we arrived again in  Virginia, five or six  hundred miles from our island in the river, all  rags and filled with  fever, we were not regarded as prodigal sons.  It  was what hundreds, yes,  thousands of other boys did.  In our pleasant  uplands we soon got rid of  both rags and fever.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And you did not wish to return to the wilderness?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The temptation was strong at times, but it was defeated by other   ambitions.  There was school and I liked sports.  These soon filled up  my  life.&#8221; 
  Harry knew much more about the life of Jackson, which the modesty  of his  hero kept him from telling.  Looking at the strong, active  figure of the  man so near him he knew that he had once been delicate,  doomed in  childhood, as many thought, to consumption, inherited from  his mother.  But a vigorous life in the open air had killed all such  germs.  He was a  leader in athletic sports.  He was a great horseman,  and often rode as a  jockey for his uncle in the horse races which the  open-air Virginians  loved so well, and in which they indulged so much.   He could cut down a  tree or run a saw-mill, or drive four horses to a  wagon, or seek deer  through the mountains with the sturdiest hunter of  them all.  And upon  top of this vigorous boyhood had come the long and  severe training at  West Point, the most thorough and effective  military school the world has  ever known. 
  Harry did not wonder, as he looked at his general, that he could  dare and  do so much.  He might be awkward in appearance, he might wear  his clothes  badly, but the boy at ten years had been a man, doing a  man's work and  with a man's soul.  He had come into the field, no  parade soldier,  but with a body and mind as tough and enduring as  steel, the whole  surcharged and heated with a spirit of fire. 
  Both Harry and Mrs. Howard had become silent and were watching the   general.  For some reason Jackson was more moved than usual.  His  manner  did not depart from its habitual gravity.  He made no gestures,  but the  blue eyes under the heavy brows were irradiated by a peculiar  flashing  light. 
  The long dinner went on.  It was more of a festival than a banquet,   and Harry at last gave himself up entirely to its luxurious warmth.   The foreboding that their mellow days in the pleasant little city were   over, was gone, but it was destined to come again.  Now, after the  dinner  was finished, and the great table was cleared away, they sat  and talked,  some in the dining room and some in the library. 
  It was still raining, that cold rain which at times turns for a  moment or  two to snow, and it dashed in gusts against the window  panes.  Harry was  with some of the younger people in the library,  where they were playing  at games.  The sport lagged presently and he  went to a window, where he  stood between the curtain and the glass. 
  He saw the outside dimly, the drenched lawn, and the trees beyond,   under which two or three sentinels, wrapped closely in heavy coats,   walked to and fro.  He gazed at them idly, and then a shadow passed   between him and them.  He thought at first that it was a blurring of  the  glass by some stronger gust of rain, but the next moment his  experience  told him that it could not be so.  He had seen a shadow,  and the shadow  was that of a man, sliding along against the wall of  the house, in order  that he might not be seen by a sentinel. 
  Harry's suspicions were up and alive in an instant.  In this border   country spies were numerous.  It was easy to be a spy where people  looked  alike and spoke the same language with the same accent.  His  suspicions,  too, centered at once upon Shepard, whom he knew to be so  daring and  skillful. 
  The lad was prompt to act.  He slipped unnoticed into the hall, put  on  his greatcoat, felt of the pistol in his belt, opened the front  door and  stepped out into the dark and the rain.
