  For many minutes Philip did not move, or look from the bit of damp   fabric which be held between his fingers. His heart was chilled.  He  felt sick. Each moment added to the emotion which was growing  in him,  an emotion which was a composite of disgust and of  anguish.  Jeanne&#8212;Thorpe! An eternity of difference seemed to lie  between those  two&#8212;Jeanne, with her tender beauty, her sweet life,  her idyllic  dreams, and Thorpe, the gang-driver! In his own soul  he had made a  shrine for Jeanne, and from his knees he had looked  up at her, filled  with the knowledge of his own unworthiness. He  had worshiped her, as  Dante might have worshiped Beatrice. To him  she was the culmination of  all that was sweet and lovable in  woman, transcendently above him. And  from this love, this worship  of his, she had gone that very night to  Thorpe, the gang-man. He  shivered. Going to the stove he thrust in a  handful of paper,  dropped the handkerchief in with it, and set the  whole on fire. 
  A few moments later the door opened and MacDougall came in. He was   followed by the two swarthy-faced St. Pierres, the camp huntsmen.   Philip shook hands with them, and they passed after the engineer   through a narrow door leading into a room which was known as the  camp  office, Cassidy, Henshaw, and the others followed within the  next ten  minutes. There was not a man among them whose eyes  faltered when  Philip put up his proposition to them. As briefly as  possible he told  them a part of what he had previously revealed to  MacDougall, and  frankly conceded that the preservation of property  and life in the  camp depended almost entirely upon them. 
  &quot;You're not the sort of men to demand pay in a pinch like this,&quot;   he finished, &quot;and that's just the reason I've confidence enough in   you to ask for your support. There are fifty men in camp whom we   could hire to fight, but I don't want hired fighters. I don't want   men who will run at the crack of a few rifles, but men who are   willing to die with their boots on. I won't offer you money for  this,  because I know you too well. But from this hour on you're  going to be  a part of the Great Northern Fish and Development  Company, and as soon  as the certificates can be signed I'm going  to turn over a hundred  shares of stock to each of you. Remember  that this isn't pay. It's  simply a selfish scheme of mine to make  you a part of the company.  There are eight of us. Give us each an  automatic and I'll wager that  there isn't a combination in this  neck of the woods strong enough to  do us up.&quot; 
  In the pale light of the two oil-lamps the men's faces glowed with   enthusiasm. Cassidy was the first to grip Philip's hand in a  pledge  of fealty. 
  &quot;When hell freezes over, we're licked,&quot; he said. &quot;Where's me   automatic?&quot; 
  MacDougall brought in the guns and ammunition. 
  &quot;In the morning we will begin the erection of a new building close   to this one,&quot; said Philip. &quot;There is no reason for the building,  but  that will give me an excuse for keeping you men together on  one job,  within fifty feet of your guns, which we can keep in this  room. Only  four men need work at a shift, and I'll put Cassidy in  charge of the  operations, if that is satisfactory to the others.  We'll have a couple  of new bunks put in here so that four men can  stay with MacDougall and  me every night. The other four, who are  not on the working shift, can  hunt not far from the camp, and keep  their eyes peeled. Does that look  good?&quot; 
  &quot;Can't be beat,&quot; said Henshaw, throwing open the breech of his   gun. &quot;Shall we load?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  The room became ominous with the metallic click of loaded   cartridge clips and the hard snap of released chambers. 
  Five minutes later Philip stood alone with MacDougall. The loaded   rifles, each with a filled cartridge belt hanging over the muzzle,   were arranged in a row along one of the walls. 
  &quot;I'll stake everything I've got on those men,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Mac,   did it ever strike you that when you want REAL men you ought to  come  north for them? Every one of those fellows is a northerner,  except  Cassidy, and he's a fighter by birth. They'll die before  they go back  on their word.&quot; 
  MacDougall rubbed his hands and laughed softly. 
  &quot;What next, Phil?&quot; 
  &quot;We must send the swiftest man you've got in camp after Billinger,   and get word to the other parties you sent out as quickly as we  can.  They'll probably get in too late. Billinger may arrive in  time.&quot; 
  &quot;He's been gone a week. It's doubtful if we can get him back   within three,&quot; said MacDougall. &quot;I'll send St. Pierre's cousin,  that  young Crow Feather, after him as soon as he can get a pack  ready.  You'd better go to bed, Phil. You look like a dead man.&quot; 
  Philip was not sure that he could sleep, notwithstanding the   physical strain he had been under during the past twenty-four  hours.  He was filled with a nervous desire for continued action.  Only action  kept him from thinking of Jeanne and Thorpe. After  MacDougall had gone  to stir up young Crow Feather he undressed and  stretched out in his  bunk, hoping that the Scotchman would soon  return. Not until he closed  his eyes did he realize how tired he  was. MacDougall came in an hour  later, and Philip was asleep. It  was nine o'clock when he awoke. He  went to the cook's shanty, ate  a hot breakfast of griddle-cakes and  bacon, drank a pint of strong  coffee, and hunted up MacDougall. Sandy  was just coming from  Thorpe's house. 
  &quot;He's a queer guinea, that Thorpe,&quot; said the engineer, after their   first greeting. &quot;He doesn't pretend to do a pound's work. Notice  his  hands when you see him again, Phil. They look as though he had  been  drumming a piano all his life. But love o' mighty, how he  does make  the OTHERS work. You want to go over and see his gang  throw dirt.&quot; 
  &quot;That's where I'm going,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Is Thorpe at home?&quot; 
  &quot;Just leaving. There he is now!&quot; 
  At MacDougall's whistle Thorpe turned and waited for Philip. 
  &quot;Goin' over?&quot; he asked, pleasantly, when Philip came up. 
  &quot;Yes. I want to see how your men work without a leader,&quot; replied   Philip. He paused for a moment to light his pipe, and pointed to a   group of men down on the lake shore. &quot;See that gang?&quot; he asked.   &quot;They're building a scow. Take away their foreman and they  wouldn't  be worth their grub. They're men we brought up from  Winnipeg.&quot; 
  Thorpe was rolling a cigarette. Under his arm he held a pair of   light gloves. 
  &quot;Mine are different,&quot; he laughed, quietly. 
  &quot;I know that,&quot; rejoined Philip, watching the skill of his long   white fingers. &quot;That's why I want to see them in action, when  you're  away.&quot; 
  &quot;My policy is to know to a cubic foot what a certain number of men   are capable of doing in a certain time,&quot; explained Thorpe, as they   walked toward the plain. &quot;My next move is to secure the men who  will  achieve the result, whether I am present or not. That done,  my work is  done. Simple, isn't it?&quot; 
  There was something likable about Thorpe. Even in his present mood   Philip could not but concede that. He was surprised in Thorpe, in   more ways than one. His voice was low, and filled with a certain   companionable quality that gave one confidence in him immediately.  He  was apparently a man of education and of some little culture,  in spite  of his vocation, which usually possesses a vocabulary of  its own as  hard as rock. But Philip's greatest surprise came when  he regarded  Thorpe's personal appearance. He judged that he was  past forty,  perhaps forty-five, and the thought made him shudder  inwardly. He was  twice&#8212;almost three times&#8212;as old as Jeanne. And  yet there was about  him something irresistibly attractive, a  fascination which had its  influence upon Philip himself. His nails  dug into tie flesh of his  hands when he thought of this man&#8212;and  Jeanne. 
  Thorpe's gang was hard at work when they came to the end of the   rock-bed. Scarcely a man seemed to take notice when he appeared.   There was one exception, a wiry, red-faced little man who raised a   hand to his cap when he saw the foreman. 
  &quot;That's the sub-foreman,&quot; explained Thorpe. &quot;He answers to me.&quot;   The little man had given a signal, and Thorpe added, &quot;Excuse me  for a  moment. He's got something on his mind.&quot; 
  He drew a few steps aside, and Philip walked along the line of   laboring-men. He grinned and nodded to them, one after another.   MacDougall was right. They were the toughest lot of men he had  ever  seen in one gang. 
  Loud voices turned him about, and he saw that Thorpe and the sub-   foreman had approached a huge, heavy-shouldered man, with whom  they  seemed to be in serious altercation. Two or three of the  workmen had  drawn near, and Thorpe's voice rang out clear and  vibrant. 
  &quot;You'll do that, Blake, or you'll shoulder your kit back home. And   what goes with you goes with your clique. I know your kind, and  you  can't worry me. Take that pick and dig&#8212;or hike. There's no  two ways  about it.&quot; 
  Philip could not hear what the big man said, but suddenly Thorpe's   fist shot out and struck him fairly on the jaw. In another instant   Thorpe had jumped back, and was facing half a dozen angry,   threatening men. He had drawn a revolver, and his white teeth  gleamed  in a cool and menacing smile. 
  &quot;Think it over, boys,&quot; he said, quietly. &quot;And if you're not   satisfied come in and draw your pay this noon. We'll furnish you  with  outfits and plenty of grub if you don't like the work up  here. I don't  care to hold men like you to your contracts.&quot; 
  He came to meet Philip, as though nothing unusual had happened. 
  &quot;That will delay the completion of our work for a week at least,&quot;   he said, as he thrust his revolver into a holster hidden under his   coat. &quot;I've been expecting trouble with Blake and four or five of  his  pals for some time. I'm glad it's over. Blake threatens a  strike  unless I give him a sub-foremanship and increase the men's  wages from  six to ten dollars a day. Think of it. A strike&#8212;up  here! It would be  the beginning of history, wouldn't it?&quot; 
  He laughed softly, and Philip laughed from sheer admiration of the   man's courage. 
  &quot;You think they'll go?&quot; he asked, anxiously. 
  &quot;I'm sure of it,&quot; replied Thorpe. &quot;It's the best thing that can   happen.&quot; 
  An hour later Philip was back in camp. He did not see Thorpe again   until after dinner, and then the gang-foreman hunted him up. His  face  wore a worried look. 
  &quot;It's a little worse than I expected,&quot; he said. &quot;Blake and eight   others came in for their pay and outfits this noon. I didn't think   that more than three or four would have the nerve to quit.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll furnish you with men to take their places,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;There's the hitch,&quot; replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. &quot;I want   my men to work by themselves. Put half a dozen of your amateur   road-men among them and it will mean twenty per cent. less work  done,  and perhaps trouble. They're a tough lot. I concede that.  I've thought  of a way to offset the loss of Blake and the others.  We can set a gang  of your men at work over at Gray Beaver Lake,  and they can build up to  meet us.&quot; 
  Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe. The   engineer did not disguise his pleasure at the turn which affairs  had  taken. 
  &quot;I'm glad they're going,&quot; he declared. &quot;If there's to be trouble   I'll feel easier with that bunch out of camp. I'd give my next   month's salary if Thorpe would take his whole outfit back where  they  came from. They're doing business with the road-bed all  right, but I  don't like the idea of having 'em around when there  are throats to be  cut, one side or t'other.&quot; 
  Philip did not see Thorpe again that day. He selected his men for   the Gray Beaver work, and in the afternoon despatched a messenger   over the Fort Churchill route to meet Brokaw. He was confident  that  Brokaw and his daughter would show up during the next few  days, but at  the same time he instructed the messenger to go to  Churchill if he  should not meet them on the way. Other men he sent  to recall the  prospecting parties outfitted by MacDougall. Early  in the evening the  St. Pierres, Lecault, and Henshaw joined him  for a few minutes in the  office. During the day the four had done  scout work five miles on all  sides of the camp. Lecault had shot a  moose three miles to the south,  and had hung up the meat. One of  the St. Pierres saw Blake and his  gang on the way to the  Churchill. Beyond these two incidents they  brought in no news. A  little later MacDougall brought in two other men  whom he could  trust, and armed them with muzzle-loaders. They were the  two last  guns in the camp. 
  With ten men constantly prepared for attack, Philip began to feel   that he had the situation well in hand. It would be practically   impossible for his enemies to surprise the camp, and after their   first day's scout duty the men on the trail would always be within   sound of rifle-shots, even if they did not discover the advance of  an  attacking force in time to beat them to camp. In the event of  one  making such a discovery he was to signal the others by a  series of  shots, such as one might fire at a running moose. 
  Philip found it almost impossible to fight back his thoughts of   Jeanne. During the two or three days that followed the departure  of  Blake he did not allow himself an hour's rest from early dawn  until  late at night. Each night he went to bed exhausted, with the  hope that  sleep would bury his grief. The struggle wore upon him,  and the  faithful MacDougall began to note the change in his  comrade's face.  The fourth day Thorpe disappeared and did not show  up again until the  following morning. Every hour of his absence  was like the stab of a  knife in Philip's heart, for he knew that  the gang-foreman had gone to  see Jeanne. Three days later the  visit was repeated, and that night  MacDougall found Philip in a  fever. 
  &quot;You're overdoing,&quot; he told him. &quot;You're not in bed five hours out   of the twenty-four. Cut it out, or you'll be in the hospital  instead  of in the fighting line when the big show comes to town.&quot; 
  Days of mental agony and of physical pain followed. Neither Philip   nor MacDougall could understand the mysterious lack of  developments.  They had expected attack before this, and yet  ceaseless scout work  brought in no evidence of an approaching  crisis. Neither could they  understand the growing disaffection  among Thorpe's men. The numerical  strength of the gang dwindled  from nineteen down to fifteen, from  fifteen to twelve. At last  Thorpe voluntarily asked Philip to cut his  salary in two, because  he could not hold his men. On that same day the  little sub-foreman  and two others left him, leaving only nine men at  work. The delay  in Brokaw's arrival was another puzzle to Philip. Two  weeks  passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times. On the   fifteenth day the Fort Churchill messenger returned. He was  astounded  when he found that Brokaw was not in camp, and brought  amazing news.  Brokaw and his daughter had departed from Fort  Churchill two days  after Pierre had followed Jeanne and Philip.  They had gone in two  canoes, up the Churchill. He had seen no  signs of them anywhere along  the route. 
  No sooner had he received the news than Philip sent the messenger   after MacDougall. The Scotchman's red face stared at him blankly  when  he told him what had happened. 
  &quot;That's their first move in the real fight,&quot; said Philip, with a   hard ring in his voice. &quot;They've got Brokaw. Keep your men close  from  this hour on, Sandy. Hereafter let five of them sleep in our  bunks  during the day, and keep them awake during the night.&quot; 
  Five days passed without a sign of an enemy. 
  About eight o'clock on the night of the sixth MacDougall came into   the office, where Philip was alone. The young Scotchman's usually   florid face was white. He dropped a curse as he grasped the back  of a  chair with both hands. It was the third or fourth time that  Philip had  heard MacDougall swear. 
  &quot;Damn that Thorpe!&quot; he cried, in a low voice. 
  &quot;What's up?&quot; asked Philip, his muscles tightening. 
  MacDougall viciously beat the ash from the bowl of his pipe. 
  &quot;I didn't want to worry you about Thorpe, so I've kept quiet about   some things,&quot; he growled. &quot;Thorpe brought up a load of whisky with   him. I knew it was against the law you've set down for this camp,  but  I figured you were having trouble enough without getting you  into a  mix-up with him, so I didn't say anything. But this other&#8212;  is  damnable! Twice he's had a woman sneak in to visit him. She's  there  again to-night!&quot; 
  A choking, gripping sensation rose in Philip's throat. MacDougall   was not looking, and did not see the convulsive twitching of the   other's face, or the terrible light that shot for an instant into  his  eyes. 
  &quot;A woman&#8212;Mac&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;A YOUNG woman,&quot; said MacDougall, with emphasis. &quot;I don't know who   she is, but I do know that she hasn't a right there or she  wouldn't  sneak in like a thief. I'm going to be blunt&#8212;damned  blunt. I think  she's one of the other men's wives. There are half  a dozen in camp.&quot; 
  &quot;Haven't you ever looked&#8212;to see if you could recognize her?&quot; 
  &quot;Haven't had the chance,&quot; said MacDougall. &quot;She's been wrapped up   both times, and as it was none of my business I didn't lay in  wait.  But now&#8212;it's up to you!&quot; 
  Philip rose slowly. He felt cold. He put on his coat and cap, and   buckled on his revolver. His face was deadly white when he turned  to  MacDougall. 
  &quot;She is over there to-night?&quot; 
  &quot;Sneaked in not half an hour ago, I saw her come out of the edge   of the spruce.&quot; 
  &quot;From the trail that leads out over the plain?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  Philip walked to the door. 
  &quot;I'm going over to call on Thorpe,&quot; he said, quietly. &quot;I may not   be back for some time, Sandy.&quot; 
  In the deep shadows outside he stood gazing at the light in   Thorpe's cabin. Then he walked slowly toward the spruce. He did  not  go to the door, but leaned with his back against the building,  near  one of the windows. The first shuddering sickness had gone  from him.  His temples throbbed. At the sound of a voice inside  which was  Thorpe's the chill in his blood turned to fire. The  terrible fear that  had fallen upon him at MacDougall's words held  him motionless, and his  brain worked upon but one idea&#8212;one  determination. If it was Jeanne  who came in this way, he would  kill Thorpe. If it was another woman,  he would give Thorpe that  night to get out of the country. He waited.  He heard the gang-  man's voice frequently, once in a loud,  half-mocking laugh. Twice  he heard a lower voice&#8212;a woman's. For an  hour he watched. He  walked back and forth in the gloom of the spruce,  and waited  another hour. Then the light went out, and he slipped back  to the  corner of the cabin. 
  After a moment the door opened, and a hooded figure came out, and   walked rapidly toward the trail that buried itself amid the  spruce.  Philip ran around the cabin and followed. There was a  little open  beyond the first fringe of spruce, and in this he ran  up silently from  behind and overtook the one he was pursuing. As  his hand fell upon her  arm the woman turned upon him with a  frightened cry. Philip's hand  dropped. He took a step back. 
  &quot;My God! Jeanne&#8212;it is you!&quot; 
  His voice was husky, like a choking man's. For an instant Jeanne's   white, terrified face met his own. And then, without a word to  him,  she fled swiftly down the trail. 
  Philip made no effort to follow. For two or three minutes he stood   like a man turned suddenly into hewn rock, staring with unseeing  eyes  into the gloom where Jeanne had disappeared. Then he walked  back to  the edge of the spruce. There he drew his revolver, and  cocked it. The  starlight revealed a madness in his face as he  approached Thorpe's  cabin. He was smiling, but it was such a smile  as presages death; a  smile as implacable as fate itself.
