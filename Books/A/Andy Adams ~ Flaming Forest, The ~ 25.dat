  Carrigan turned slowly and looked about his room. There was no   other door except one opening into a closet, and but two windows.   Curtains were drawn at these windows, and he raised them. A grim   smile came to his lips when he saw the white bars of tough birch   nailed across each of them, outside the glass. He could see the  birch  had been freshly stripped of bark and had probably been  nailed there  that day. Carmin Fanchet and Black Roger had welcomed  him to Chateau  Boulain, but they were evidently taking no chances  with their  prisoner. And where was Marie-Anne? 
  The question was insistent, and with it remained that cold grip of   something in his heart that had come with the sight of Carmin  Fanchet  below. Was it possible that Carmin's hatred still lived,  deadlier than  ever, and that with Black Roger she had plotted to  bring him here so  that her vengeance might be more complete&#8212;and a  greater torture to  him? Were they smiling and offering him their  hands, even as they knew  he was about to die? And if that was  conceivable, what had they done  with Marie-Anne? 
  He looked about the room. It was singularly bare, in an unusual   sort of way, he thought. There were rich rugs on the floor&#8212;three   magnificent black bearskins, and two wolf. The heads of two bucks  and  a splendid caribou hung against the walls. He could see, from  marks on  the floor, where a bed had stood, but this bed was now  replaced by a  couch made up comfortably for one inclined to sleep.  The significance  of the thing was clear&#8212;nowhere in the room could  he lay his hand upon  an object that might be used as a weapon! 
  His eyes again sought the white-birch bars of his prison, and he   raised the two windows so that the cool, sweet breath of the  forests  reached in to him. It was then that he noticed the  mosquito-proof  screening nailed outside the bars. It was rather  odd, this thinking of  his comfort even as they planned to kill  him! 
  If there was truth to this new suspicion that Black Roger and his   mistress were plotting both vengeance and murder, their plans must   also involve Marie-Anne. Suddenly his mind shot back to the raft.  Had  Black Roger turned a clever coup by leaving his wife there,  while he  came on ahead of the bateau with Carmin Fanchet? It would  be several  weeks before the raft reached the Yellowknife, and in  that time many  things might happen. The thought worried him. He  was not afraid for  himself. Danger, the combating of physical  forces, was his business.  His fear was for Marie-Anne. He had seen  enough to know that Black  Roger was hopelessly infatuated with  Carmin Fanchet. And several  things might happen aboard the raft,  planned by agents as black-souled  as himself. If they killed  Marie-Anne&#8212; 
  His hand gripped the knob of the door, and for a moment he was   filled with the impulse to shout for Black Roger and face him with   what was in his mind. And as he stood there, every muscle in his  body  ready to fight, there came to him faintly the sound of music.  He heard  the piano first, and then a woman's voice singing. Soon a  man's voice  joined the woman's, and he knew it was Black Roger,  singing with  Carmin Fanchet. 
  Suddenly the mad impulse in his heart went out, and he leaned his   head nearer to the crack of the door, and strained his ears to  hear.  He could make out no word of the song, yet the singing came  to him  with a thrill that set his lips apart and brought a staring  wonder  into his eyes. In the room below him, fifteen hundred miles  from  civilization, Black Roger and Carmin Fanchet were singing  &quot;Home, Sweet  Home!&quot; 
  An hour later David looked through one of the barred windows upon   a world lighted by a splendid moon. He could see the dark edge of  the  distant forest that rimmed in the chateau, and about him  seemed to be  a level meadow, with here and there the shadow of a  building in which  the lights were out. Stars were thick in the  sky, and a strange  quietness hovered over the world he looked  upon. From below him  floated up now and then a perfume of tobacco  smoke. The guard under  his window was awake, but he made no sound. 
  A little later he undressed, put out the two lights in his room,   and stretched himself between the cool, white sheets on the couch.   After a time he slept, but it was a restless slumber filled with   troubled dreams. Twice he was half awake, and the second time it   seemed to him his nostrils sensed a sharper tang of smoke than  that  of burning tobacco, yet he did not fully rouse himself, and  the hours  passed, and new sounds and smells that rose in the night  impinged  themselves upon him only as a part of the troublous  fabric of his  dreams. But at last there came a shock, something  which beat over  these things which chained him, and seized upon  his consciousness,  demanding that he rouse himself, open his eyes,  and get up. 
  He obeyed the command, and before he was fully awake, found   himself on his feet. It was still dark, but he heard voices,  voices  no longer subdued, but filled with a wild note of  excitement and  command. And what he smelled was not the smell of  tobacco smoke! It  was heavy in his room. It filled his lungs. His  eyes were smarting  with the sting of it. 
  Then came vision, and with a startled cry he leaped to a window.   To the north and east he looked out upon a flaming world! 
  With his fist he rubbed his smarting eyes. The moon was gone. The   gray he saw outside must be the coming of dawn, ghostly with that   mist of smoke that had come into his room. He could see shadowy   figures of men running swiftly in and out and disappearing, and he   could hear the voices of women and children, and from beyond the  edge  of the forest to the west came the howling of many dogs. One  voice  rose above the others. It was Black Roger's, and at its  commands  little groups of figures shot out into the gray smoke-  gloom and did  not appear again. 
  North and east the sky was flaming sullen red, and a breath of air   blowing gently in David's face told him the direction of the wind.   The chateau lay almost in the center of the growing line of   conflagration. 
  He dressed himself and went again to the window. Quite distinctly   now, he could make out Joe Clamart under his window, running  toward  the edge of the forest at the head of half a dozen men and  boys who  carried axes and cross-cut saws over their shoulders. It  was the last  of Black Roger's people that he saw for some time in  the open meadow,  but from the front of the chateau he could hear  many voices, chiefly  of women and children, and guessed it was  from there that the final  operations against the fire were being  directed. The wind was blowing  stronger in his face. With it came  a sharper tang of smoke, and the  widening light of day was  fighting to hold its own against the  deepening pall of flame-lit  gloom advancing with the wind. 
  There seemed to come a low and distant sound with that wind, so   indistinct that to David's ears it was like a murmur a thousand  miles  away. He strained his ears to hear, and as he listened,  there came  another sound&#8212;a moaning, sobbing voice below his  window! It was grief  he heard now, something that went to his  heart and held him cold and  still. The voice was sobbing like that  of a child, yet he knew it was  not a child's. Nor was it a  woman's. A figure came out slowly in his  view, humped over,  twisted in its shape, and he recognized Andre, the  Broken Man.  David could see that he was crying like a child, and he  was facing  the flaming forests, with his arms reaching out to them in  his  moaning. Then, of a sudden, he gave a strange cry, as if defiance   had taken the place of grief, and he hurried across the meadow and   disappeared into the timber where a great lightning-riven spruce   gleamed dully white through the settling veil of smoke-mist. 
  For a space David looked after him, a strange beating in his   heart. It was as if he had seen a little child going into the face  of  a deadly peril, and at last he shouted out for some one to  bring back  the Broken Man. But there was no answer from under his  window. The  guard was gone. Nothing lay between him and escape&#8212;if  he could force  the white birch bars from the window. 
  He thrust himself against them, using his shoulder as a battering-   ram. Not the thousandth part of an inch could he feel them give,  yet  he worked until his shoulder was sore. Then he paused and  studied the  bars more carefully. Only one thing would avail him,  and that was some  object which he might use as a lever. 
  He looked about him, and not a thing was there in the room to   answer the purpose. Then his eyes fell on the splendid horns of  the  caribou head. Black Roger's discretion had failed him there,  and  eagerly David pulled the head down from the wall. He knew the   woodsman's trick of breaking off a horn from the skull, yet in  this  room, without log or root to help him, the task was  difficult, and it  was a quarter of an hour after he had last seen  the Broken Man before  he stood again at the window with the  caribou horn in his hands. He no  longer had to hold his breath to  hear the low moaning in the wind, and  where there had been smoke-  gloom before there were now black clouds  rolling and twisting up  over the tops of the north and eastern  forests, as if mighty  breaths were playing with them from behind. 
  David thrust the big end of the caribou horn between two of the   white-birch bars, but before he had put his weight to the lever he   heard a great voice coming round the end of the chateau, and it  was  calling for Andre, the Broken Man. In a moment it was followed  by  Black Roger Audemard, who ran under the window and faced the   lightning-struck spruce as he shouted Andre's name again. 
  Suddenly David called down to him, and Black Roger turned and   looked up through the smoke-gloom, his head bare, his arms naked,  and  his eyes gleaming wildly as he listened. 
  &quot;He went that way twenty minutes ago,&quot; David shouted. &quot;He   disappeared into the forest where you see the dead spruce yonder.  And  he was crying, Black Roger&#8212;he was crying like a child.&quot; 
  If there had been other words to finish, Black Roger would not   have heard them. He was running toward the old spruce, and David  saw  him disappear where the Broken Man had gone. Then he put his  weight on  the horn, and one of the tough birch bars gave way  slowly, and after  that a second was wrenched loose, and a third,  until the lower half of  the window was free of them entirely. He  thrust out his head and found  no one within the range of his  vision. Then he worked his way through  the window, feet first, and  hanging the length of arms and body from  the lower sill, dropped  to the ground. 
  Instantly he faced the direction taken by Roger Audemard, it was   HIS turn now, and he felt a savage thrill in his blood. For an   instant he hesitated, held by the impulse to rush to Carmin  Fanchet  and with his fingers at her throat, demand what she and  her paramour  had done with Marie-Anne. But the mighty  determination to settle it  all with Black Roger himself  overwhelmed that impulse like an  inundation. Black Roger had gone  into the forest. He was separated  from his people, and the  opportunity was at hand. 
  Positive that Marie-Anne had been left with the raft, the thought   that the Chateau Boulain might be devoured by the onrushing   conflagration did not appal David. The chateau held little  interest  for him now. It was Black Roger he wanted. As he ran  toward the old  spruce, he picked up a club that lay in the path. 
  This path was a faintly-worn trail where it entered the forest   beyond the spruce, very narrow, and with brush hanging close to  the  sides of it, so that David knew it was not in general use and  that but  few feet had ever used it. He followed swiftly, and in  five minutes  came suddenly out into a great open thick with smoke,  and here he saw  why Chateau Boulain would not burn. The break in  the forest was a  clearing a rifle-shot in width, free of brush and  grass, and partly  tilled; and it ran in a semi-circle as far as he  could see through the  smoke in both directions. Thus had Black  Roger safeguarded his  wilderness castle, while providing tillable  fields for his people; and  as David followed the faintly beaten  path, he saw green stuffs growing  on both sides of him, and  through the center of the clearing a long  strip of wheat, green  and very thick. Up and down through the fog of  smoke he could hear  voices, and he knew it was this great, circular  fire-clearing the  people of Chateau Boulain were watching and  guarding. 
  But he saw no one as he trailed across the open. In soft patches   of the earth he found footprints deeply made and wide apart, the   footprints of hurrying men, telling him Black Roger and the Broken   Man were both ahead of him, and that Black Roger was running when  he  crossed the clearing. 
  The footprints led him to a still more indistinct trail in the   farther forest, a trail which went straight into the face of the  fire  ahead. He followed it. The distant murmur had grown into a  low moaning  over the tree-tops, and with it the wind was coming  stronger, and the  smoke thicker. For a mile he continued along the  path, and then he  stopped, knowing he had come to the dead-line.  Over him was a swirling  chaos. The fire-wind had grown into a roar  before which the tree-tops  bent as if struck by a gale, and in the  air he breathed he could feel  a swiftly growing heat. For a space  he stood there, breathing quickly  in the face of a mighty peril.  Where had Black Roger and the Broken  Man gone? What mad impulse  could it be that dragged them still farther  into the path of  death? Or had they struck aside from the trail? Was  he alone in  danger? 
  As if in answer to the questions there came from far ahead of him   a loud cry. It was Black Roger's voice, and as he listened, it  called  over and over again the Broken Man's name, 
  &quot;Andre&#8212;Andre&#8212;Andre&#8212;&quot; 
  Something in the cry held Carrigan. There was a note of terror in   it, a wild entreaty that was almost drowned in the trembling wind  and  the moaning that was in the air. David was ready to turn back.  He had  already approached too near to the red line of death, yet  that cry of  Black Roger urged him on like the lash of a whip. He  plunged ahead  into the chaos of smoke, no longer able to  distinguish a trail under  his feet. Twice again in as many minutes  he heard Black Roger's voice,  and ran straight toward it. The  blood of the hunter rushed over all  other things in his veins. The  man he wanted was ahead of him and the  moment had passed when  danger or fear of death could drive him back.  Where Black Roger  lived, he could live, and he gripped his club and  ran through the  low brush that whipped in stinging lashes against his  face and  hands. 
  He came to the foot of a ridge, and from the top of this he knew   Black Roger had called. It was a huge hog's-back, rising a hundred   feet up out of the forest, and when he reached the top of it, he  was  panting for breath. It was as if he had come suddenly within  the blast  of a hot furnace. North and east the forest lay under  him, and only  the smoke obstructed his vision. But through this  smoke he could make  out a thing that made him rub his eyes in a  fierce desire to see more  clearly. A mile away, perhaps two, the  conflagration seemed to be  splitting itself against the tip of a  mighty wedge. He could hear the  roar of it to the right of him and  to the left, but dead ahead there  was only a moaning whirlpool of  fire-heated wind and smoke. And out of  this, as he looked, came  again the cry, 
  &quot;Andre&#8212;Andre&#8212;Andre!&quot; 
  Again he stared north and south through the smoke-gloom. Mountains   of resinous clouds, black as ink, were swirling skyward along the  two  sides of the giant wedge. Under that death-pall the flames  were  sweeping through the spruce and cedar tops like race-horses,  hidden  from his eyes. If they closed in there could be no escape;  in fifteen  minutes they would inundate him, and it would take him  half an hour to  reach the safety of the clearing. 
  His heart thumped against his ribs as he hurried down the ridge in   the direction of Black Roger's voice. The giant wedge of the  forest  was not burning&#8212;yet, and Audemard was hurrying like mad  toward the  tip of that wedge, crying out now and then the name of  the Broken Man.  And always he kept ahead, until at last&#8212;a mile  from the ridge&#8212;David  came to the edge of a wide stream and saw  what it was that made the  wedge of forest. For under his eyes the  stream split, and two arms of  it widened out, and along each shore  of the two streams was a wide  fire-clearing made by the axes of  Black Roger's people, who had  foreseen this day when fire might  sweep their world. 
  Carrigan dashed water into his eyes, and it was warm. Then he   looked across. The fire had passed, the pall of smoke was clearing   away, and what he saw was the black corpse of a world that had  been  green. It was smoldering; the deep mold was afire. Little  tongues of  flame still licked at ten thousand stubs charred by the   fire-death&#8212;and there was no wind here, and only the whisper of a   distant moaning sweeping farther and farther away. 
  And then, out of that waste across the river, David heard a   terrible cry. It was Black Roger, still calling&#8212;even in that  place  of hopeless death&#8212;for Andre, the Broken Man!
