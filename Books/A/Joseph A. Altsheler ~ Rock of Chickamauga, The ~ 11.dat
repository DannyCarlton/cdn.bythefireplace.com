  Dick was a fine swimmer, he had a good stout plank, and the waters  of the river were warm. He felt that the chief dangers were passed, and  that the muddy Mississippi would now bear him safely to the blockading  fleet below. He gave the plank another shove, sending it farther out  into the stream, and then raised himself up until his elbows rested  upon it. He could thus float gently with a little propulsion from his  legs to the place where he wanted to go.
  He saw lights along the bluff and the bar below, and then, with a  sudden shoot of alarm he noticed a dim shadow move slowly from the  shore. It was a long boat, holding a dozen rowers, and several men  armed with rifles, and it was coming toward him. He did not know  whether it was merely an ordinary patrol, or whether they had seen the  darker blot on the stream that he and the plank made, but in any event  the result would be the same.
  He slipped his arm off the plank and sank in the stream to the chin.  Then, propelling it gently and without any splashing of the water, he  continued to move down the stream. He was hopeful that the riflemen  would mistake him and his plank for one of those stumps or logs which  the Mississippi carries so often on its bosom.
  The head of the boat turned from him a little, and he felt sure now  that he would drift away unnoticed, but one of the soldiers suddenly  raised his rifle and fired. Dick heard the bullet clip the water close  beside him, and he swam as hard as he could for a few moments. Then he  settled again into quiet, as he saw the boat was not coming toward him.  Doubtless the man had merely fired the shot to satisfy himself that it  was really a log, and if Dick allowed it to float naturally he would be  convinced.
  It was a tremendous trial of nerves to run the gantlet in this way,  but as it was that or nothing he exerted all his will upon his body,  and let himself float slowly, sunk again to the mouth and with his head  thrown back, so it would present only a few inches above the surface.
  The boat turned, and seemed once upon the point of coming toward  him. He could hear the creaking of the oars and the men talking, but  they turned again suddenly and rowed up the stream. Again, his fate had  hung on a chance impulse. He drifted slowly on until the town and the  bluffs sank in the darkness. Then he drew himself upon his plank and  swam, doubling his speed. He knew that some of the Union gunboats lay  not far below, and, when he rounded a curve, he saw a light in the  stream, but near the shore.
  He approached cautiously, knowing that the men on the vessel would  be on guard against secret attack, and presently he discerned the  outlines of a sidewheel steamer, converted into a warship and bearing  guns. He dropped down by the side of his plank until he was quite  close, and then, raising himself upon it again, he shouted with all his  voice: &#8220;Ship ahoy!&#8221;
  He did not know whether that was the customary method of hailing on  the Mississippi, but it was a memory from his nautical reading, and so  he shouted a second and yet a third time at the top of his voice: &#8220;Ship  ahoy!&#8221; Figures bearing rifles appeared at the side, and a rough voice  demanded in language highly unparliamentary who was there and what he,  she or it wanted.
  Dick was in a genial mood. He had escaped with an ease that  surprised him, and the warmth of the water in which he was immersed had  saved him from cramp or chill. The spirit of recklessness seized him  again. He threw himself astride his plank, and called out:
  &#8220;A detachment of the army of the United States escaped from  captivity in Vicksburg, and wishing to rejoin it. It's infantry, not  marines, and it needs land.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then advance infantry and give the countersign.&#8221;
  &#8220;Grant and Victory,&#8221; replied Dick in a loud, clear voice.
  A laugh came from the steamer, and the rough voice said again:
  &#8220;Let the detachment advance again, and holding up its hands, show  itself.&#8221;
  Dick paddled closer and, steadying himself as well as he could,  threw up his hands. The light of a ship's lantern was thrown directly  on his face, and the same voice ordered men to take a small boat and  get him.
  When Dick stepped upon the deck of the steamer, water streaming from  his clothes, several men looked at him curiously. One in a dingy blue  uniform he believed to be the owner of the rough voice. But his face  was not rough.
  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the man.
  &#8220;Lieutenant Richard Mason of Colonel Winchester's regiment in the  army of General Grant, sent several days ago with a message to the  fleet, but driven by Confederate scouts and skirmishers into Vicksburg,  where he lay hidden, seeking a chance of escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he found it to-night, coming down the river like a big  catfish.&#8221;
  &#8220;He did, sir. He could find no other way, and he arrived on the  useful board which is now floating away on the current.&#8221;
  &#8220;What proof have you that you are what you say.&#8221;
  &#8220;That I saw you before you saw me and hailed you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's not enough.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then here is the message that I was to have delivered to the  commander of the fleet. It's pretty wet, but I think you can make it  out.&#8221;
  He drew the dispatch from the inside pocket of his waistcoat. It was  soaked through, but when they turned the ship's lantern upon it the  captain could make out its tenor and the names. Doubt could exist no  longer and he clapped his hands heartily upon the lad's shoulder.
  &#8220;Come into the cabin and have something to eat and dry clothes,&#8221; he  said. &#8220;This is the converted steamer Union, and I'm its commander,  Captain William Hays. I judge that you've had an extraordinary time.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have, captain, and the hardest of it all was when I saw our army  repulsed to-day.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was bad and the wounded are still lying on the field, but it  doesn't mean that Vicksburg will have a single moment of rest. Listen  to that, will you, lieutenant?&#8221;
  The far boom of a cannon came, and Dick knew that its shell would  break over the unhappy town. But he had grown so used to the cannonade  that it made little impression upon him, and, shrugging his shoulders,  he descended the gangway with the captain.
  Clothing that would fit him well enough was found, and once more he  was dry and warm. Hot coffee and good food were brought him, and while  he ate and drank Captain Hays asked him many questions. What was the  rebel strength in Vicksburg? Were they exultant over their victory of  the day? Did they think they could hold out? What food supply did they  have?
  Dick answered all the questions openly and frankly as far as he  could. He really knew little or nothing about those of importance, and,  as for himself, he merely said that he had hid in a cave, many of which  had been dug in Vicksburg. He did not mention Colonel Woodville or his  daughter.
  &#8220;Now,&#8221; said Captain Hays, when he finished his supper, &#8220;you can have  a bunk. Yes, lieutenant, you must take it. I could put you ashore  to-night, but it's not worth while. Get a good night's sleep, and we'll  see to-morrow.&#8221;
  Dick knew that he was right, and, quelling his impatience, he lay  down in one of the bunks and slept until morning.
  Then, after a solid breakfast, he went ashore with the good wishes  of Captain Hays, and, a few hours later, he was with the Union army and  his own regiment. Again he was welcomed as one dead and his own heart  was full of rejoicing because all of his friends were alive. Warner  alone had been wounded, a bullet cutting into his shoulder, but not  hurting him much. He wore a bandage, his face had a becoming pallor,  and Pennington charged that he was making the most of it.
  &#8220;But it was an awful day,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;and there's a lot of gloom  in the camp. Still, we're not moving away and the reinforcements are  coming.&#8221;
  Dick explained to Colonel Winchester why he had failed in his  mission, and the colonel promised to report in turn to the commander  that the hand of God had intervened. Dick's conscience was now at rest,  and he resumed at once his duties with the regiment.
  Many days passed. While Grant did not make any other attack upon  Vicksburg his circle of steel grew tighter, and the rain of shells and  bombs upon the devoted town never ceased. Reinforcements poured  forward. His army rose to nearly eighty thousand men, and Johnston,  hovering near, gathering together what men he could, did not dare to  strike. Dick was reminded more than once of Caesar's famous siege of  Alesia, about which he had read not so long ago in Dr. Russell's  academy at Pendleton.
  There were long, long days of intrenching, skirmishing and idleness.  May turned into June, and still the steel coil enclosed Vicksburg. Here  the Union men were hopeful, but the news from the East was bad. Not  much filtered through, and none of it struck a happy note. Lee, with  his invincible legions, was still sweeping northward. Doubtless the  Confederate hosts now trod the soil of a free State, and Dick and his  comrades feared in their very souls that Lee was marching to another  great victory.
  &#8220;I wish I could hear from Harry Kenton,&#8221; said Dick to Warner. &#8220;I'd  like to know whether he passed through Chancellorsville safely.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you worry about him,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;That rebel cousin of  yours has luck. He also has skill. Let x equal luck and y skill. Now x  plus y equals the combination of luck and skill, which is safety. That  proves to me mathematically that he is unharmed and that he is riding  northward&#8212; to defeat, I hope.&#8221;
  &#8220;We've got to win here,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;If we don't, I'm thinking the  cause of the Union will be more than doubtful. We don't seem to have  the generals in the East that we have in the West. Our leaders hang on  here and they don't overestimate the enemy.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;Now, I wonder what 'Pap' Thomas is  doing.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's somewhere in Tennessee, I suppose, watching Bragg,&#8221; said Dick.  &#8220;That's a man I like, and, I think, after this affair here is over, we  may go back to his command. If we do succeed in taking Vicksburg, it  seems likely to me that the heavy fighting will be up there in  Tennessee, where Bragg's army is.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you know if your uncle, Colonel Kenton, is in Vicksburg?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think so. In fact, I'm sure he isn't. His regiment is with  Bragg. Well, George, what does your algebra tell us?&#8221;
  Warner had taken out his little volume again and was studying it  intently. But he raised his head long enough to reply.
  &#8220;I have just achieved the solution of a very important mathematical  problem,&#8221; he answered in precise tones. &#8220;An army of about thirty-five  thousand men occupies a town located on a river. It is besieged by  another army of about seventy-five thousand men flushed with victory.  The besiegers occupy the river with a strong fleet. They are also led  by a general who has shown skill and extraordinary tenacity, while the  commander of the besieged has not shown much of either quality and must  feel great discouragement.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you're only stating the side of the besieged.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't interrupt. It's impolite. I mean to be thoroughly fair. Now  come the factors favoring the besieged. The assailing army, despite its  superior numbers, is far in the enemy's country. It may be attacked at  any time by another army outside, small, but led by a very able  general. Now, you have both sides presented to you, but I have already  arrived at the determining factor. What would you say it is, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221;
  &#8220;You haven't used your reasoning powers. Remember that the man who  not merely thinks, but who thinks hard and continuously always wins.  It's very simple. The answer is in four letters, f-o-o-d, food. As we  know positively, Pemberton was able to provision Vicksburg for five or  six weeks. We can't break in and he can't break out. When his food is  exhausted, as it soon will be, he'll have to give up. The siege of  Vicksburg is over. I know everything, except the exact date.&#8221;
  Dick was inclined to believe that Warner was right, but he forgot  about his prediction, because a mail came down the river that  afternoon, and he received a letter from his mother, his beautiful  young mother, who often seemed just like an elder sister.
  She was in Pendleton, she wrote, staying comfortably in their home.  The town was occupied by three companies of veteran Union troops who  behaved well. They were always glad to have a garrison of good soldiers  whether Federal or Confederate&#8212;sometimes it was one and sometimes the  other. But she thought the present Union force would remain quite a  while, as she did not look for the reappearance of the Southern army in  Kentucky. But if the town were left without troops she would go back to  her relatives in the Bluegrass, as Bill Skelly's band to the eastward  in the mountains was raiding and plundering and had become a great  menace. Guerillas were increasing in numbers in those doubtful regions.
  &#8220;The regular troops will have to deal with those fellows later on,&#8221;  said Dick.
  &#8220;Dr. Russell has had a letter from Harry Kenton,&#8221; continued Mrs.  Mason. &#8220;It was written from some point near the Pennsylvania line, and,  while Harry did not say so in his letter, I know that General Lee is  expecting a great victory in the North. Harry was not hurt at  Chancellorsville, but he says he does not see how he escaped, the fire  of the cannon and rifles being more awful than any that he had ever  seen before. He was present when General Jackson was mortally wounded,  and he seems to have been deeply affected by it. He writes that the  Confederacy could better have lost a hundred thousand men.&#8221;
  There was more in the letter, but it was strictly personal to Dick,  and it closed with her heartfelt prayer that God, who had led him  safely so far, would lead him safely through all.
  After reading it several times he put it in a hidden pocket.  Soldiers did not receive many letters and they always treasured them.  Ah, his dear, beautiful young mother! How could anyone ever harm her!  Yet the thought of Skelly and his outlaws made him uneasy. He hoped  that the Union garrison would remain in Pendleton permanently.
  His mind was soon compelled to turn back to the siege. They were  digging trenches and creeping closer and closer. Warner had made no  mistake in his mathematics. The army and the people in Vicksburg had  begun to suffer from a lack of food. They were down to half rations.  They had neither tea nor coffee, and medicines were exhausted. Many and  many a time they looked forth from their hills and prayed for Johnston,  but he could not come. Always the Union flag floated before them, and  the ring of steel so strong and broad was contracting inch by inch.
  The Northern engineers ran mines under the Confederate works. They  used every device of ingenious minds to push the siege. Spies brought  word that all food would soon be gone in Vicksburg, and Grant, grim of  purpose, took another hitch in the steel belt about the hopeless town.  The hostile earthworks and trenches were now so near that the men could  hear one another talking. Sometimes in a lull of the firing they would  come out and exchange tobacco or news. It was impossible for the  officers to prevent it, and they really did not seek to do so, as the  men fought just as well when they returned to their works.
  June now drew to a close and the great heats of July were at hand.  Dick was convinced that the defense of Vicksburg was drawing to a like  close. They had proof that some of the irregulars in Vicksburg had  escaped through the lines and he was convinced that Slade would be  among them. They were the rats and Vicksburg was the sinking ship.
  They heard that Johnston had gathered together twenty-five thousand  men and was at last marching to the relief of the town. Dick believed  that Grant must have laughed one of his grimmest laughs. They knew that  Johnston's men were worn and half-starved, and had been harassed by  other Union troops. Johnston was skillful, but he would only be a lean  and hungry wolf attacking a grizzly bear. He was sure that all danger  from him had passed.
  Now, as they closed in the Northern guns increased their fire. It  seemed to Dick that they could have blown away the whole plateau of  Vicksburg by this time. The storm of shells raked the town, and he was  glad that the people had been able to dig caves for refuge. Colonel  Woodville must be doing some of his greatest swearing now. Dick thought  of him with sympathy and friendliness.
  &#8220;I don't think it can last much longer, Mr. Mason,&#8221; said Sergeant  Daniel Whitley on the morning of the second of July. &#8220;Their guns don't  answer ours often and it means that they're out of ammunition, or  almost. Besides, you can stand shells and bullets easier than lack of  food. 'Pears to me I can nearly feel 'em crumpling up before us.&#8221;
  Trumpets blew the next morning. All the firing ceased suddenly and  the three lads saw a Southern general with several officers of lower  rank, riding forward under a white flag. It was Bowen, who came out to  meet Grant.
  Dick drew a deep, long breath. He knew that this was the end. So did  his comrades. A cheer started and swept part of the way along the  lines, but the officers quickly stopped it.
  &#8220;Vicksburg is ours,&#8221; said Dick.
  &#8220;Looks like it,&#8221; said Warner.
  But Grant told Bowen that he would treat only with Pemberton, and  after delays General Pemberton came out. General Grant went forward to  meet him. The two stood alone under a tree within seventy yards of the  Confederate lines and talked.
  Chance or fortune presented a startling coincidence. Almost at the  very moment that Grant and Pemberton met under the tree Pickett's men  were rising to their feet and preparing for the immortal but fatal  charge at Gettysburg. While the cannon had ceased suddenly at Vicksburg  they were thundering from many score mouths at Gettysburg. Fortune was  launching two thunderbolts upon the Confederacy at the same moment.  They were to strike upon fields a thousand miles apart, and the double  blow was to be mortal.
  But Dick knew nothing of Gettysburg then, nor was he to know  anything until days afterward. He certainly had no thought of the East  while he watched the two generals under the tree. Dick's comrades were  with him, but so intense was their curiosity that none of them spoke.  Thousands of men were gazing with the same eagerness, and the Southern  earthworks were covered with the defenders.
  It was one of the most dramatic scenes in Dick's life, the two men  under the tree, and the tens of thousands who watched. Nobody moved. It  seemed that they scarcely breathed. After the continuous roar of firing  the sudden silence was oppressive, and Dick felt the blood pounding in  his ears.
  The heat was close and heavy. Black clouds were floating up in the  west, and lightning glimmered now and then on the horizon. Although the  storm threatened no one noticed. All eyes were still for Grant and  Pemberton. After a while each returned to his own command, and there  was an armistice until the next day, when the full surrender was made,  and Grant and his officers rode into Vicksburg. At the same time Lee  was gathering his men for the retreat into the South from the stricken  field of Gettysburg. It was the Fourth of July, the eighty-seventh  anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and no one could have  possibly conceived a more striking celebration.
  As soon as Dick was free for a little space he hurried to the  ravine, and, as before, found there the open door. He passed in without  hesitation.
  The light as of old filtered into the room, and Colonel Woodville  lay just as before in bed with his great bald head upon the pillow.  Miss Woodville sat beside the bed, reading aloud from Addison. Dick's  step was light, but the colonel heard him and held up a finger. The lad  paused until Miss Woodville, finishing a long sentence, closed the  book. Then the colonel, raising a little the great white thatch of his  eyebrows, said:
  &#8220;Young sir, you have returned again, and, personally, you are  welcome, but I do not conceive how you can stand the company you keep.  My daughter informs me that the Yankees are in Vicksburg, and I have no  reason to doubt the statement.&#8221;
  He paused, and Dick said:
  &#8220;Yes, Colonel, it's true.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose we must endure it. I should have gone myself and have  offered my sword to General Grant, but this confounded leg of mine is  still weak.&#8221;
  &#8220;At least, sir, we come with something besides arms. May I bring you  rations?&#8221;
  &#8220;You are generous, young man, and my daughter and I appreciate the  obvious nature of your errand here. Speaking for both of us, a little  food will not be unwelcome.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tell me first, what has become of your nephew. Has he escaped from  the city?&#8221;
  &#8220;He slipped out nearly a week ago, and will join his father's  regiment in Bragg's command. That scoundrel, Slade, is gone too. Since  the city had to be surrendered I would gladly have made you a present  of Slade, but it's out of my power now.&#8221;
  Dick soon returned with ample food for them and helped them later,  when they moved to quarters outside in the shell-torn city. Dick saw  that they were comfortable, and then his mind turned toward Tennessee.  Detachments from Grant's army were to be sent to that of Rosecrans, who  was now heavily threatened by Bragg, and the Winchester regiment, which  really belonged with him, was sure to go.
  The order to march soon came, and it was welcome. The regiment, or  rather what was left of it, promptly embarked upon one of the river  steamers and started northward.
  As they stood on the deck and looked down at the yellow waters in  which Dick had swum on his trusty plank Warner said:
  &#8220;I've news of importance. It arrived in a telegram to General Grant,  and I heard it just as we were coming on board.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dick.
  &#8220;General Lee was defeated in a great battle at a little place called  Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, and has retreated into Virginia.&#8221;
  &#8220;Gettysburg and Vicksburg!&#8221; exclaimed Dick. &#8220;The wheel has turned  nearly 'round. The Confederacy is doomed now.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; said Warner.
