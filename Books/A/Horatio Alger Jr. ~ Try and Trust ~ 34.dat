  Herbert left Mr. Godfrey's counting-room very much depressed in  spirits.  But an hour before he had rejoiced in his excellent  prospects, and,  depending on the favor of his employer and his own  fidelity, had looked  forward to a bright future. Now all was changed.  He was dismissed from  his situation in disgrace, suspected of a mean  theft. He had, to be  sure, the consciousness of innocence, and that  was a great deal. He was  not weighed down by the feeling of guilt, at  least. Still his prospects  were dark. Suppose the matter should not be  cleared up, and he should  still remain under suspicion? How could he  hope to obtain another place  without a recommendation from his late  employer? No; he must resign all  hope of a position and adopt some  street occupation, such as selling  papers or vending small articles in  a basket, as he had seen boys of his  own age doing. He did not doubt  but that in some way he could get a  living, but still he would be  under suspicion, and that was hard to  bear. 
  While these things were passing through his mind he walked down   Broadway, with his eyes fixed upon the sidewalk. All at once he  started  to hear his name called, and, looking up, to his unbounded  astonishment  he saw before him Ralph the Ranger, whom he had supposed  a thousand  miles away in his cabin in the Ohio woods. 
  The sight of a friendly face was most welcome to him at such a  time, and  Ralph's face was friendly. 
  &quot;Ralph!&quot; he exclaimed, seizing the Ranger's hand. &quot;How did you come   here? When did you arrive? You are the last person I expected to see.&quot; 
  &quot;And you are the one I most wanted to see,&quot; said Ralph, his tone   unconsciously softened by his friendly interest in the boy before him. 
  &quot;I can say the same, Ralph,&quot; said Herbert, soberly, &quot;for I am in   trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;In trouble, boy? I am sorry for that. Is it money? I can get you  out of  that trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;It is not that exactly, Ralph. If you will come into the City Hall  Park  and sit down on a bench with me I will tell you all about it.&quot; 
  &quot;Instead of that, let us go into the Astor House,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;It  is  where I am stopping.&quot; 
  &quot;You are stopping at the Astor House?&quot; said Herbert, in momentary   surprise. &quot;Perhaps you do not know that there are cheaper hotels.  Shall  I direct you to one?&quot; 
  &quot;No, Herbert, I am not poor, as you perhaps think. I suppose I  should be  called rich; but that I can explain afterwards. For the  present your  affairs require attention. Come in.&quot; 
  They went up the steps of the Astor House, and Ralph led the way to  his  room, an apartment of good size and handsomely furnished. 
  &quot;Now, Herbert, take a chair and tell me all,&quot; he said. 
  To repeat Herbert's story here is unnecessary. Ralph listened with   attention, and when it was concluded he said: &quot;The main thing is to   account for the money in your possession. Do you think you should   remember the policeman who aided you in recovering your money?&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure I should.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he know how much money you recovered?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, for he saw me count the bills.&quot; 
  &quot;Then we must seek him out and induce him to go with us to Mr.  Godfrey's  counting-room and give his testimony.&quot; 
  &quot;I never thought of that,&quot; said Herbert, his face brightening.  &quot;When  shall we go?&quot; 
  &quot;Now. I have nothing else to occupy me, and the sooner you are  righted  the better.&quot; 
  They went out together, and made their way at once to the spot  where  Herbert had encountered Greenleaf. They had to wait but a brief  time  when the policeman came up. 
  &quot;Do you remember me?&quot; asked Herbert, going up to him. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied; &quot;you are the boy that overhauled a thief the  other  day, and got back his money.&quot; 
  &quot;You see, he remembers,&quot; said Herbert, with satisfaction. 
  &quot;My friend,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;when will you be off duty?&quot; 
  &quot;In half an hour,&quot; said the policeman, in surprise. 
  &quot;In half an hour, then, I want you to go with me to this boys  employer  and repeat your story. The possession of the money has caused  him to be  suspected, and your evidence, confirming his own, will clear  him of  having obtained it improperly.&quot; 
  &quot;I will go,&quot; said the officer, &quot;and shall be glad to get him out of  a  scrape. It was all fair and above-board, and I'll say so  cheerfully.&quot; 
  At the end of the half hour the three made their way to Mr.  Godfrey's  place of business and entered together. 
  Mr. Godfrey marked their entrance with surprise, and looked  inquiringly  at Herbert. 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey,&quot; said Herbert, respectfully, &quot;I have come to prove to  you  that the money I have in my pocketbook is my own.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be very glad if you can do so,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey; and it  was  evident from his manner that he spoke sincerely. 
  &quot;This officer knows all the circumstances, and will tell you what  he  knows.&quot; 
  The policeman made his statement, partly in answer to questions  from Mr.  Godfrey. 
  &quot;The explanation is satisfactory,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, &quot;and convinces  me.  It does not, however, absolutely clear you, since between the time  of  the money being lost and your being searched you went out to the  post  office, and you might have disposed of the pocketbook and its  contents  on the way.&quot; 
  Herbert's countenance fell, but Mr. Godfrey hastened to add.  &quot;Although  your vindication is not complete, I will say that I believe  you fully,  and will receive you back into my employ.&quot; 
  &quot;You have forgotten one thing, sir,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;Thomas declares  that  he saw me pick up the wallet and put it in my pocket.&quot; 
  &quot;So I did,&quot; said Tom, boldly. 
  Mr. Godfrey looked perplexed, and was hesitating what to say when  Mr.  Walton, the owner of the lost pocketbook, hurriedly entered. 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey,&quot; he said, &quot;I have to beg your pardon, and, most of  all,  the pardon of this boy,&quot; indicating Herbert. &quot;I have found my   pocketbook. I didn't lose it here, but my pocket was picked in the   street. The pickpocket was arrested, and the wallet has been returned  to  me. This boy is innocent.&quot; 
  &quot;I am very glad to hear it,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, with emphasis.  &quot;Herbert,  I will try to make amends to you for my transient suspicions  of your  honesty. As for you,&quot; he continued, turning to Thomas and  speaking  sternly, &quot;I despise you for your mean attempt to injure your  fellow-  clerk. You must leave my employment to-day. I shall write to  your father  the reasons for dismissing you.&quot; 
  &quot;I can get along without your paltry four dollars a week,&quot; said  Tom,  with bravado. &quot;I am not a beggar.&quot; 
  &quot;You may be something worse, if you do not amend, &quot;said Mr.  Godfrey.&quot;  Mr. Pratt, you may pay him for the entire week, and he can  go at once.&quot; 
  Although Tom professed so much disdain for the four dollars a week,  he  did not decline the week's pay directed to be paid to him, but  placed  the money in his vest pocket and went out with assumed  nonchalance,  though, in reality, deeply mortified at the unexpected  discovery of his  meanness. 
  &quot;As for you, Herbert,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, &quot;you can come back at  once, and  I will raise your pay to eight dollars a week. I owe you  some reparation  for the injury you came so near suffering. I will  never again doubt your  integrity.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;I shall be glad to come back.&quot; 
  &quot;Before this matter is decided,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;I have a proposition  to  make to Herbert. I am rich, and have no one to share or inherit my   wealth. I propose to adopt him&#8212;to give him an opportunity to complete   his education in Europe, whither I propose going, and if some years   hence you shall be willing to receive him, he can then enter your   counting-room to learn business. The amount of compensation will be   unimportant, as I shall provide for him amply.&quot; 
  Herbert stared at Ralph in amazement. He could hardly realize that  the  offer was indeed a genuine one. 
  &quot;Do you mean that I am to go to Europe with you, Ralph?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Yes, if you like.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall like it VERY MUCH,&quot; said Herbert, enthusiastically. &quot;How  can I  thank you for so much generous kindness!&quot; 
  &quot;Your companionship will cheer me, and give me something to live  for,  Herbert,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;Through you I hope some day to enjoy life  again.&quot; 
  Herbert's clasped the Ranger's hand in impulsive gratitude, while  his  face beamed with pleasure. 
  &quot;I congratulate you, Herbert,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, kindly, &quot;though I  am  sorry to lose you. Whenever your guardian is ready to have you  enter on  a business career, a place in my counting-room shall be open  to you.&quot; 
  &quot;Ralph,&quot; said Herbert, seriously, as they went from the  counting-room in  company, &quot;all that has happened seems so wonderful  that I am a little  afraid I shall wake up to find it all a dream.&quot; 
  &quot;It is a change to me also,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;to have a new interest in   life. The past is a sealed book. Let us look forward to a bright and   pleasant future. Whatever pleasures and advantages money can obtain  for  you shall be yours.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Herbert, gratefully.
