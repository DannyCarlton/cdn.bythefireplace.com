Betty reached her part of the Adirondacks late at night. There were  two miles between the station and the house, and Jack Emory and Sally  Carter came to meet her. They told her the recent news of the family  as the horses toiled up the steep road cut through the dark and  fragrant forest.    
"Aunt is unusually well and seems to enjoy interminable talks with  Major Carter," said Emory. "Harriet is very much improved; she holds  herself regally and sometimes has a colour. She studied until the last  minute, and even here is always at her books. I don't say she hasn't  intervals of laziness," he added with a laugh, "but she always pulls  up; and it is very creditable of her, for she is full of Southern  indolence. She would like to lie in the sun all day and sleep, I am  sure; although she won't admit it."    
"Does she seem any happier? She had suffered too much privation to  have become really happy before I left."    
"I am sure she is--" Jack began, but Sally interrupted him.    
"I think she is one of those people who hardly know whether they are  happy or not. She seems to me to be in a sort of transition state. One  moment she will be gay with the natural gayety of a girl, and the next  she will look puzzled, and occasionally tragic. I think there must be  a big love affair somewhere in her past."    
"I am sure there is nothing of the sort. Have the Norths come?"    
"Mrs. North is here, and the Senator brought her, but he had to go  back; for that disgraceful Tariff bill still hangs on. I believe we  are to pay for the very air we breathe: a Trust company has bought it  up. Oh, by the way, you have a new housekeeper;" and both she and  Emory laughed. "Do you mean that old Mrs. Sawyer has left? She was  invaluable."    
"Her son wanted her to keep house for him, and she secured the  services of a female from a neighboring village. Miss Trumbull is  forty-odd and unmarried. She has a large bony face, the nondescript  colouring of the average American, and a colossal vanity. We amuse  ourselves watching her smirk as she passes a looking-glass. But she is  an excellent housekeeper, and her vanity would be of no consequence if  she would keep her place. The day we arrived she hinted broadly that  she wanted to sit at table with us, and one night when John was ill  and she had to help wait, she joined in the conversation. She's a  good-natured fool, but an objectionable specimen of that 'I'm-as-good-  as-you-are' American. I've been waiting for you to come and extinguish  her."    
"I certainly shall extinguish her."    
"She victimizes poor Harriet, whom she seems to think more on her  level," said Miss Carter, not without unction.    
Betty could feel her face flush. "The sooner she puts that idea out of  her head the better," she said coldly. "I am surprised that Harriet  permits a liberty of that sort."    
"Harriet lacks pride, my dear, in spite of her ambition and what  Nature has done for her outside. She is curiously contradictory. But  that lack is one which persons of Miss Trumbull's sort are quick to  detect and turn to their own account. Your housekeeper's variety of  pride is common and blatant, and demands to be fed, one way or  another."    
Mrs. Madison had not retired and was awaiting her daughter in the  living-room. Betty found the household an apparently happy one. The  Major was a courtly gentleman who told stories of the war. Harriet in  her soft black mull with a deep colour in her cheeks looked superb,  and Betty kissed and congratulated her warmly; as Senator North had  predicted, the physical repulsion had worn away long since. The big  room with its matting and cane divans and chairs, heaped with bright  cushions, and the pungent fire in the deep chimney--for the evenings  were still cold--looked cosey and inviting; no wonder everybody was  content. Even Jack looked less careworn than usual; doubtless the  pines, as ever, had routed his malaria. Only Sally's gayety seemed a  little forced, and there was an occasional snap in her eye and  dilation of her nostril.    
When Betty had put her mother to bed and talked her to sleep, she went  to her own room and opened the window. She could hear the lake  murmuring at the foot of the terrace, the everlasting sighing of the  pines; but it was very dark: she could hardly see the grim mountains  across the water. Just below them was a triple row of lights. He  should have been behind those lights and he was not. For the moment  she hated politics.    
She closed the window and wrote the following letter:--    
DEAR MR. NORTH,--I am home, you see. Don't reply and tell me that the  Tariff Bill surrounds you like a fortress wall. I am going for a walk  at five o'clock on Saturday morning, and I expect to meet you  somewhere in the forest above the north end of the lake. You can reach  it by the path on your side. I shall row there. Do not labour over an  excuse, my friend. I know how you hate to write letters, and you know  that I am a tyrant whose orders are always obeyed.    <p align="right">    BETTY MADISON.    
"That should not worry him," she thought, "and it should bring him."
