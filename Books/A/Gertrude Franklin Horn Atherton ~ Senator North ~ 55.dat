For a few days Betty was almost happy again. She had come so close to  the nucleus of love that it had warmed her veins and intoxicated her  brain. Imagination for a brief moment had given place to reality, and  if she felt wiser and older still than after her five months of  meditation on the events of the summer, she felt less sober. One great  desire of the past year had been fulfilled, and its memory sparkled in  her brain, and her heart was lighter. It had been hours before she had  ceased to feel the pressure of his arms.    
She wondered how she could have been so weak as to think of marrying  Burleigh in self-defence, and she punished him by an indifference of  manner which approached frigidity; until one of the evening journals  copied a bitter attack upon him from the leading newspaper of his  State, when she relented and permitted him to console himself in her  presence. And although, as the weeks passed and she saw Senator North  from the gallery of the Senate only, or for a few impersonal moments  in the crowd, and the elixir in her veins lost its strength, still she  felt that life was sufferable once more. She had endeavoured to put  Mrs. North from her mind, but more than once she caught herself  wishing that some one would mention her name. Nobody did in those  excited days, and Betty had no means of learning whether her sudden  good health had been final or temporary. Sally Carter did not allude  to her again. When she and Betty met, it was to wrangle on the Cuban  question, for Miss Carter was all for war.    
And then one day the newsboys shrieked in the streets that the  <i>Maine</i> had been blown up in Havana Harbor.    
For a few days Congress held its peace, and the country showed a  praiseworthy attempt to believe in the theory of accident or to wait  for full proof of Spanish treachery. The <i>Maine</i> was blown up on  Tuesday, and on Thursday night at the Madisons' the subject almost was  avoided; it was the most peaceful <i>salon</i> Betty had held.    
But it was merely the calm before the storm. The fever was still in  the country's blood, which began to flow freely to the brain again as  soon as the shock was over. The press could not let pass the most  glorious opportunity in its history for head-lines; there were more  mass meetings than even the press could grapple with, and all the  latent oratorical ability in the country burst into flower. It seemed  to Betty when she rose in the night and leaned out of her window that  she could hear the roar of the great national storm.    
And it rose and swelled and left the old landmarks behind it. The  memory of the gales of the past year, with the intervals of doubt and  rest, was insignificant beside this volume of fury pouring out of  every State, to concentrate at last, fierce, unreasoning, and  irresistible, about the White House and Capitol Hill. It was not long  before the great quiet village on the Potomac seemed to epitomize the  terrible mood of the country it represented, and the country had  made up its mind long before the report of the Maine Court of Inquiry  came in. The cry no longer was for the suffering Cuban, but for  revenge. The Senate held down its "kickers" with an iron hand, but one  or two of the inferior men managed to shout across the Chamber to  their constituents. Senator North scarcely left his seat. Burleigh  told Betty that he should not allude to the subject in the Senate  until after the Court of Inquiry's report, but then, whatever the  result, he should speak and ask for war. Betty argued with him by the  hour, and although he discussed the matter from every side, it was  evident that he did it merely for the pleasure of talking to her and  that she could not shake his resolution for a moment. It was time for  the United States to put an end to the barbarous state of affairs a  few miles from her shores, and that was the end of it. He admitted the  patriotism of Senator North's attitude, but contended that the  United States would be more dishonoured if she disregarded this  terrible appeal to her humanity. When Betty accused him of short-  sightedness, he replied that a foretold result required a straight  line of succession, and that when great events thickened the line of  succession was anything but straight; therefore ultimates could not be  foretold. He admitted that Senator North had proved himself possessed  of the faculty of what Herbert Spencer calls representativeness more  than once, but men as wise and calm in their judgment had been  mistaken before. But he and others of his standing were preserving the  dignity of the Senate, and that was something.
