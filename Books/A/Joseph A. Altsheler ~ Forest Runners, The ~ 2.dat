Paul, while not the equal of Henry in the woods, was a strong and enduring  youth. His muscles were like wire, and there were few better runners west  of the mountains. Although the weight of the second rifle might tell after  a while, he did not yet feel it, and with springy step he sped after  Henry, leaving the choice of course and all that pertained to it to his  comrade. After a while they heard a second cry--a wailing note--and Henry  raised his head a little.    
"They've come to the two who fell," he said.    
But after the single lament, the warriors were silent, and Paul heard  nothing more in the woods but their own light footsteps and his own long  breathing. Little birds flitted through the boughs of the trees, and now  and then a hare hopped up and ran from their path. The silence became  terrible, full of omens and presages, like the stillness before coming  thunder.    
"It means something," said Henry; "I think we've stumbled into a regular  nest of those Shawnees, and they're likely to be all about us."    
As if confirming his words, the far, faint note came from their right, and  then, in reply, from their left. Henry stopped so quickly that Paul almost  ran into him.    
"I was afraid it would be that way," he said. "They're certainly all  around us except in front, and maybe there, too."    
Visions of the torture rose before Paul again.    
"What are we to do?" he said.    
"We must hide."    
"Hide I Why, they could find us in the forest, as I would find a man in an  open field."    
"I don't mean hide here," said Henry; "the river is just ahead, and I  think that if we reach it in time we can find a place. Come, Paul, we must  run as we never ran before."    
The two boys sped with long, swift bounds through the forest as only those  who run for their lives can run. Now the voices of the pursuit became  frequent, and began to multiply. Henry, with his instinctive skill in the  forest, read their meaning. The pursuers were sure of triumph. But Henry  shut his lips tightly, and resolved that he and Paul should yet elude  them.    
"The river is not more than a half mile ahead," he said. "Come, Paul,  faster! A little faster, if you can!"    
Paul obeyed, and the two, bending their heads lower, sped on with  astonishing speed. Trees and bushes slid behind them. Before them appeared  a blue streak, that broadened swiftly and became a river.    
"We must not let them see us," said Henry. "Bend as low as you can, and be  as quiet as you can!"    
Paul obeyed, and in a few more minutes they were at the river's edge.    
"Fasten your bullets and powder around your neck," said Henry, "and keep  the rifle on your shoulder."    
Paul did so, following Henry's quick example, and the two stepped into the  water, which soon reached to their waists. Henry had been along this river  before, and at this crisis in the lives of his comrade and himself he  remembered. Dense woods lined both banks of the stream, which was narrow  here for miles, and a year or two before a hurricane had cut down the  trees as a reaper mows the wheat. The surface of the water was covered  with fallen trunks and boughs, and for a half mile at least they had  become matted together like a great raft, out of which grass and weeds  already were growing. But Paul did not know it, and suddenly he stopped.    
"Why, what has become of the river?" he exclaimed, pointing ahead.    
The stream seemed to stop against a bank of logs and foliage.    
Henry laughed softly.    
"It is the great natural raft," he said. "There is where we are to hide."    
He hastened his steps, wading as rapidly as he could, and Paul kept by his  side. He comprehended Henry's plan, their last and desperate chance. In a  few moments more they were at the great raft, and in the bank, amid a  dense, almost impenetrable mass of foliage, they hid their rifles and  ammunition. Henry uttered a deep sigh as he did it.    
"I hate like everything to leave them," he said, "but if we come to close  quarters with any of those fellows, we must trust to our knives and  hatchets."    
Then he turned reluctantly away. It was not a deep river, nowhere above  their necks, and he pushed a way amid the trees and foliage that were  packed upon the surface, Paul, as usual, following closely. Now and then  he dived under a big log, and came up on the other side, his head well  hidden among upthrust boughs and among the weeds and grass that had grown  in the soil formed by the silt of the river. And Paul always carefully  imitated him.    
When they were about thirty yards into the mass Paul felt Henry's hand on  his shoulder. "Look back, Paul," was whispered in his ear, "but be sure  not to move a single bough." Paul slowly and cautiously turned his head,  and saw a sight that made him quiver.    
Running swiftly, savage warriors were coming into view on either bank of  the river--tall men, dark with paint, and, as he well knew, hot with the  desire to take life.    
"I thank God that this place is here!" breathed Paul.    
"Yes, it was just made for us," said Henry, and he laughed ever so little.  "Come, Paul, we must get farther into it. But be sure you don't shake any  boughs."    
They waded on, only their heads above the current, and these always hidden  by the interlacing trunks and branches. A great shout, fierce with  triumph, rose behind them.    
"They've found where our trail entered the water, and they think they've  got us," whispered Henry. "Now, be still, Paul; we'll hide here."    
They pushed themselves into a mass of debris, where logs and boughs, swept  by the current, formed a little arch over the stream. There they stood up  to their chins in water, with their heads covered by the arch. Through  the slits between the trunks and boughs they could see their pursuers.    
It was a numerous band--thirty or forty men--and they divided now into  several parties. Some ran along the banks of the stream and others sprang  from log to log over the raft, searching everywhere, with keen, black eyes  trained to note every movement of the wilderness.    
Paul felt Henry's hand again on his shoulder, but neither boy spoke. Both  felt as if they were in a little cage, with the fiercest of all wild  animals around it and reaching long paws through the bars at them. Each  sank a little deeper into the water, barely leaving room to breathe, and  watched their enemies still searching, searching everywhere. They heard  the patter of moccasins on the logs, and now and then they saw brown,  muscular legs passing by. Two warriors stopped within ten feet of them and  exchanged comment. Henry, who understood their language, knew that they  were puzzled and angry. But Paul, without knowing a word that they said,  understood, too. His imagination supplied the place of knowledge. They  were full of wrath because they had lost the trail of the two whom they  had regarded as certainly theirs, and to seek them in the vast maze of  logs and brush was like looking for one dead leaf among the millions.    
The two warriors stood still for a full minute, and then moved on out of  sight. Paul drew a deep breath of relief, like a sigh, and Henry's hand  was pressed once more upon his shoulder.    
"Not a sound yet, not a sound, Paul!" he whispered ever so softly. "They  will hunt here a long time."    
More warriors, treading on the logs, showed that his caution was not  misplaced. They poked now and then in the water, amid the great mass of  debris, and one stood on a log so near to the two lads that they could  have reached out and touched his moccasined feet. But their covert was too  close to be suspected, and soon the man passed on.    
Presently all of them were out of sight; but Henry, a true son of caution  and the wilderness, would not yet let Paul stir.    
"They will come back this way," he said. "We risk nothing by waiting, and  we may save much."    
Paul made no protest, but he was growing cold. The chill from the water of  the river was creeping into his veins, and he longed for the dry land and  a chance to stir about. Yet he clenched his teeth and resolved to endure.  He would not move until Henry gave the word.    
He saw what a wise precaution it was, when, a half hour later, seven or  eight warriors came walking back on the logs, and thrust with sticks into  the little patches of open water between them. Henry and Paul crouched  closer in their covert, and the warriors stalked back and forth, still  searching.    
Henry knew that the Shawnees, failing to find a place beyond the debris  where the fugitives had emerged upon the bank, would believe that they  might be hidden under the logs, and would not give up the hunt there. If  they should happen to find the rifles and ammunition, they would certainly  be confirmed in the conclusion, but so far they had not found them. Henry,  looking between the logs, saw them pass near the place of concealment, but  they did not stop, and were soon near the other bank. It would have  bitterly hurt his pride if they had found the rifles, even had he and Paul  escaped.    
An hour more they waited, and then the last warrior was out of sight, gone  up the river.    
"I think we may crawl out now," whispered Henry; "but we've still got to  be mighty careful about it."    
Pad took a step and fell over in the water. His legs were stiff with the  wet and cold; but Henry dragged him up, and before trying it again he  stretched first one leg and then the other, many times.    
"We must make our way back through the logs and brush to the rifles,"  whispered Henry, "and then take to the woods once more."    
"I think I've lived in a river long enough to last me the rest of my  life," Paul said.    
Henry laughed. He, too, was stiff and cold; but, a born woodsman, he now  dismissed their long hiding in the water as only an incident. The two  reached the precious rifles and ammunition, drew them forth from  concealment, and stepped upon the bank, rivulets pouring from their  clothing, and even their hair.    
"I think we'd better go back on our own trail now," said Henry. "The war  party has passed on, and is still looking for us far ahead."    
"We've got to dry ourselves, and somehow or other get that powder to  Marlowe," said Paul.    
"That's so," said Henry. "We came to do it, and we will do it."    
He spoke with quiet emphasis, but Paul knew that he meant to perform what  he had set out to do, come what might, and Paul was willing to go with him  through anything. Neither would abandon the great task of helping to save  Kentucky. But they were still in a most serious position. They had been  many hours in water which was not now warmed by summer heat, and they were  bound to feel the effect of it soon in every bone. Henry glanced up at  the heavens. It was far past noon, and the golden sun was gliding down the  western arch.    
"I think," said Henry, "that it would be best for us to walk, as fast as  we can on the back track, and then try to dry out our clothing a little."    
He started at once, and Paul walked swiftly by his side. The rivulets that  ran from their clothing decreased to tiny streams, and then only drops  fell. The sinking sun shot sheaves of brilliant beams upon them, and soon  Paul felt a grateful warmth, driving for the time the chill from his  bones. He swung his arms as he walked, as much as the rifles would allow,  and nearly every muscle in his frame felt the touch of vigorous exercise.  His clothing dried rapidly.    
Two hours and three hours passed, and they heard no more the cries of the  warriors calling to each other. Silence again hung over the wilderness.  Rabbits sprang up from the thickets. A deer, frightened by the sound of  the boys' footsteps, held up his head, listened a moment, and then fled  away among the trees. Henry took his presence as a sign that no other  human being had passed that way in the last hour.    
The sun sank, the twilight came and died, and darkness clothed the  wilderness. Then Henry stopped.    
"Paul," he said, "I've got some venison in my knapsack, but you and I  ought to have a fire. While our clothes are drying outside they are still  wet inside and we can't afford to have a chill, or be so stiff that we  can't run. You know we may have another run or two yet."    
"But do we dare make a fire?" asked Paul.    
"I think so. I can hide the blaze, and the night is so dark that the smoke  won't show."    
He plunged deeper into the thickets, and came to a rocky place, full of  gullies and cavelike hollows. It was so dark that Paul could see only his  dim form ahead. Presently their course led downward, and Henry stopped in  one of the sheltered depressions.    
"Now we'll make our fire," he said.    
It was pitchy black where they stood. The walls of the hollow rose far  above their heads, and its crest was lined on every side with giant trees  and dense undergrowth.    
The two boys dragged up dead leaves and brushwood, and Henry patiently  ignited the heap with his flint and steel. A tiny blaze arose, but he did  not permit it to grow into a flame. Heavier logs were placed upon the top,  and the fire only burned beneath, amid the small boughs. Smoke arose, but  it was lost in the black heavens. The fire, thus confined, burned  fiercely and rapidly within its narrow limits, and a fine bed of coals  soon formed. It was time! The night had come on cold, and the chill  returned to Paul's veins. Before the fire was lighted he had begun to  shiver, but when the deep bed of coals was formed, he sat before it and  basked in the grateful and glowing heat.    
"I think we'd better take off our clothing and dry it," said Henry, and  both promptly did so. They hung part of their garments before the fire, on  a stick thrust in the ground, until they were dry, and then, putting them  on again, replaced them with the remainder, to dry in their turn.  Meanwhile they ate of the venison that Henry carried in his knapsack, and  felt very happy. It was a wonderful experience for Paul. This was comfort  and safety. They were only a pin point in the wilderness, but for the  present the stony hollow fenced them about, and the hidden fire gave forth  warmth and pleasure.    
"Do you think you could sleep, Paul?" asked Henry, when they had put on  again the last of the dried clothing.    
Paul laughed.    
"Could I sleep?" he said. "Would a hungry wolf eat? Will water run down  hill? I don't think I could do anything else just now."    
"Then try it," said Henry. "After a while I'll wake you up for your  watch, and take a turn at it myself."    
Paul said not another word, but sank back on the grass and leaves, with  his feet to the great bed of coals. He saw their glow for a moment or two,  then his eyelids shut down, and he was wafted away on a magic carpet to a  dreamless region of happy peace. Henry's eyes, grown used to the dark,  looked at him for a moment or two, and then the larger boy smiled. Paul,  his faithful comrade, filled a great place in his heart--they liked each  other all the better because they were so unlike--and he was silently, but  none the less devoutly thankful that he had come.    
Henry was warm and dry, and as he tested his muscles he found them supple  and strong. Now he took precautions, thinking he had let the fire burn as  long as was safe. He scattered the coals with a stick, and then softly  crushed out each under the stout heel of his moccasin. With the minute  patience that he had learned from his forest life, he persisted in his  task until not a single spark was left anywhere. Then he sat down in  Turkish fashion, with his rifle lying across his lap and the other rifles  near, listening, always listening, with the wonderful ear that noted every  sound of the forest, and piercing the thickets with eyes whose keenness  those of no savage could surpass. He knew that they were in the danger  zone, that the Shawnees were on a great man-hunt, and regarded the two  boys as stilt within their net, although they could not yet put their  hands upon them. That was why he listened and watched so closely, and that  was why he would break his word to Paul and not waken him, keeping the  nightlong vigil himself.    
The night advanced, the darkness shredded away a little before a half  moon, and Henry was very glad that he had put out the last remnant of the  fire. Yet the trees still enclosed the hollow like a black wall, and he  did not think a foe had one chance in a thousand of finding them there  while the night lasted. But he never ceased to watch--a silent, powerful  figure, with the rifle lying across his lap, ready to be used at a  moment's notice. His stillness was something marvelous. Even had it been  light, an ordinary observer would not have seen him move a hair's breadth.  He was a part of the silent wilderness.    
Midnight, and then the long hours. Faint noises arose in the thickets, bet  the ear of the gray statue was alive, and he knew. The rabbits were  hopping about, at play, perhaps, in the moonlight; a deer was passing;  perhaps a panther stirred somewhere; but these were things that neither he  nor Paul feared; it was only man that they dreaded. After a while a  faint, clear note rose, far to the east, and to it came three replies like  it, and also far away. Henry laughed low. They were the familiar signals,  but he and Paul were well hidden, and they would escape through the lines  before morning. They might easily go back to Wareville, too, but he was  resolved not to abandon either the horses or the powder. The powder was  needed at Marlowe, and it would be a bitter humiliation not to take it  there.    
Two hours more passed, and then Henry heard the signals again, but now  closer. By chance, perhaps, the Shawnees had formed their ring about the  right place, and it was time to act. Paul had slept well and was rested,  so Henry leaned over and shook him. Paul opened his eyes, and any question  that he might have wished to ask was cut short at his lips by Henry's low,  but commanding,    
"Caution! Caution!"    
"It is far after midnight, and we must move, Paul," said Henry. "They may  have blundered on our trail before it was dark, and they are still looking  for us. I think they are coming this way."    
Paul understood in a moment, but he asked no question; if Henry said so,  it was true, it did not matter how he knew. He rose, imitating Henry,  taking his two rifles, and they stole silently away from the little cove  that had been so full of comfort for both.    
"We'll go toward the south now," said Henry, "and on your life, Paul,  don't stumble!"    
Paul knew the worth of this advice, and he was woodsman enough to avoid  tripping on the vines and bushes, despite the darkness. One mile dropped  behind them, then two, then three, and Henry suddenly put his hand upon  the shoulder of Paul, who, understanding the signal, sank down at once  beside his comrade.    
The bushes were thick there, but Paul soon saw the danger, of which  Henry's ear had already warned him. A dozen warriors marched in a silent  file through the undergrowth. Well for the two that they were some  distance away, and that the bushes grew thick and long! And well for them,  too, that it was night! The warriors looked keenly on every side as they  passed, apparently seeking out the last little leaf and twig; but, acute  as were their eyes, they did not see the boys in the bushes. And perhaps  it was well for some of them that they did not find what they sought, as  the wilderness furnished no more formidable antagonist than Henry Ware,  and Paul Cotter, too, was both brave and skillful.    
But the warriors passed, and the black wilderness hid them. Henry watched  a little bush that one had brushed against, swinging in the moonlight  with short jerks that became shorter until it grew quite still again. But  he did not yet go. He and Paul knew that they must not move for many  minutes. A warrior might turn on his track, see their risen forms, and  with his cry bring the whole band back again. They yet lay motionless and  still, while the moonlight filtered through the leaves and the silence of  the forest endured. Henry rose at last, and led the way again.    
"They are certainly beating up the woods for us," said he, "and I think  that party will stumble right upon the little hollow where we rested. It  was well we moved."    
They increased their southward pace, and when it was scarcely two hours to  the dawn Henry said:    
"I know of a good place in which to rest, and a still better place in  which to fight if they should find us."    
"Where?"    
"Holt's lone cabin. It's less than half a mile from here. I've had it in  mind."    
Paul did not know what he meant by Holt's lone cabin, but he was always  willing to trust Henry without questions. His imagination, flowering at  once into splendor, depicted it as some kind of an impregnable fortress.    
"Come, we mustn't lose time!" said Henry, and he suddenly increased his  speed, running so fast that Paul had much to do to keep pace with him.  Paul looked up, and he saw why Henry hastened. The black curtain was  rolled back a little in the east, and a splendid bar of gray appeared just  at the horizon's edge. As Paul looked, it broadened and turned to silver,  and then gold. Paul thought it a very phantasy of fate that the coming of  day, which is like life, should bring such terrors.    
They reached a clearing--a high, stony piece of ground--and in its center  Paul saw a little old log cabin, with a heavy open door that sagged on  rude wooden hinges.    
"Come," said Henry, and they crossed the clearing to the cabin, pushing  open the door. Paul looked around at the narrow place, and the protecting  walls gave him much comfort. Evidently it had been abandoned in great  haste. In one corner lay a tiny moccasin that had been a baby's shoe, and  no one had disturbed it. On a hook on the wall hung a woman's apron, and  two or three rude domestic utensils lay on the floor. The sight had Its  pathos for Paul, but he was glad that the Holts had gone in time. He was  glad, too, that they had left their house behind that he and Henry might  use it when they needed it most, because he began to be conscious now of  a great weakness, both of body and spirit.    
Hooks and a stout wooden bar still remained, and as Henry closed the door  and dropped the bar into place, he exclaimed exultantly:    
"They may get us, Paul, but they'll pay a full price before they do it."    
"I'd rather they wouldn't get us at all," said Paul.    
Nevertheless his imagination, leaping back to the other extreme, made the  lone cabin the great fortress that he wished. And a fortress it was in  more senses than one. Built of heavy logs, securely chinked, the single  window and the single door closed with heavy oaken shutters, no bullet  could reach them there. Paul sat down on a puncheon bench, and breathed  laboriously, but joyously. Then he looked with inquiry at Henry.    
"It was built by a man named Holt," said Henry. "He was either a great  fool or a very brave man to come out here and settle alone. But a month  ago, after the Indian wars began, he either became wiser or less brave,  and he went into Marlowe with his family, leaving the place just as it  is."    
"He left in time," said Paul.
