But a few nights later there was a subscription ball in the commissary  storehouse, and Hamilton danced with Miss Schuyler no less than ten  times, to the merciless amusement of the family. The ball, the first of  any size since the war began, was a fine affair, and had been organized  by Tilghman, Meade, and several of the Frenchmen; they were determined  upon one gay season, at least. The walls were covered with flags and  holly; the women wore their most gorgeous brocades; feathers and jewels  were on becoming white wigs or on the towers of powdered hair. All the  foreigners were in full regimentals, Steuben, in particular, being half  covered with gold lace and orders; the music and supper were admirable.  Even Washington looked less careworn than usual, and as he stood apart  with Lord Sterling, General Knox, and General Greene, he shed no  perceptible chill. Miss Schuyler wore white, with a twist of black  velvet in her powdered hair and another about her throat, and would have  been the belle of the party had Hamilton permitted other attentions. But  she gave him all the dances he demanded, and although her bright manner  did not lapse toward sentiment for a moment, he went home so elated that  he sat scribbling poetry until Laurens pelted him with pillows and  extinguished the candle.    
The next day there was a sleighing party to Lord Sterling's, and he  drove Miss Schuyler, her aunt, and the wife of General Knox through the  white and crystal and blue of a magnificent winter day. Mrs. Cochraine  made no secret of her pride in her niece's capture of Washington's  celebrated favourite, and assured him of a hearty welcome at her house  if he felt disposed to call. He promptly established the habit of  calling every evening.    
But although he was seriously and passionately in love, and quite sure  that Miss Schuyler loved him in return, he hesitated for the first time  in his life before precipitating a desired consummation. That he had no  money did not worry him in the least, for he knew himself capable of  earning any amount, and that the Republic, when free, would bristle with  opportunities for young men of parts. But he was in honour bound to tell  her of the irregularity of his birth. And in what manner would she  regard a possible husband with whose children she never could discuss  their father's parents? She was twenty-two, a small woman-of-the-world,  not a romantic young miss incapable of reason. And the Schuylers? The  proudest family in America! Would they take him on what he had made of  himself, on the promise of his future, or would their family pride prove  stronger than their common sense? He had moments of frantic doubt and  depression, but fortunately there was no time for protracted periods of  lover's misery. Washington demanded him constantly for consultation upon  the best possible method of putting animation into the Congress and  extracting money for the wretched troops. He frequently accompanied the  General, as at Valley Forge, in his visits to the encampment on the  mountain, where the emaciated tattered wretches were hutting with all  possible speed against the severity of another winter. The snow was  already on the ground, and every prospect of a repetition of the horrors  of Valley Forge. The mere sight of Washington put heart into them, and  Hamilton's lively sallies rarely failed to elicit a smile in return.    
It so happened that for a fortnight the correspondence with Congress,  the States, the Generals, and the British, in regard to the exchange of  prisoners, was so heavy, the consultations with Washington so frequent,  that Hamilton saw nothing of Miss Schuyler, and had little time for the  indulgence of pangs. When he emerged, however, his mind was the freer to  seek a solution of the problem which had tormented him, and he quickly  found it. He determined to write the truth to Miss Schuyler, and so save  the embarrassment he had dreaded for both. To think was to act. He  related the facts of his birth and of his ancestry in the briefest  possible manner, adding a description of his mother which would leave no  question of the place she held in his esteem. He then stated, with the  emphasis of which he was master, that he distractedly awaited his  dismissal, or Miss Schuyler's permission to declare what he had so  awkwardly concealed.    
He sent the letter by an orderly, and attacked his correspondence with a  desire to put gunpowder on his quill. But Miss Schuyler was a  tender-hearted creature and had no intention that he should suffer. She  scrawled him a hasty summons to come to her at once, and bade the  orderly ride as for his life. Hamilton, hearing a horse coming up the  turnpike at runaway pace, glanced out of the window to see what neck was  in danger, then flung his quill to the floor and bolted. He was out of  the house before the orderly had dismounted, and secured possession of  the note. When he had returned to his office, which was in a log  extension at the back of the building, he locked the door and read what  he could of Miss Schuyler's illegible chirography. That it was a command  to wait upon her at once he managed to decipher, but no more at the  moment; and feeling as if the heavens had opened, he despatched a hasty  note, telling her that he could not leave his work before night, when he  would hasten with the pent-up assurances of a love which had been his  torment and delight for many weeks. And then he answered a summons to  Washington's office, and discussed a letter to the Congress as if there  were no such person in the world as Elizabeth Schuyler, as indeed for  the hour there was not, nor for the rest of the afternoon.    
But at eight o'clock he presented himself at the Cochraine quarters, and  Miss Schuyler was alone in the drawing-room. It was some time before  they arrived at the question which had weighed so heavily on Hamilton's  mind. When, however, they came down to conversation, Miss Schuyler  remarked:--    
"I am sure that it will make no difference with my dear father, who is  the most just and sensible of men. I had never thought of your parentage  at all. I should have said you had leapt down from the abode of the  gods, for you are much too remarkable to have been merely born. But if  he should object--why, we'll run away."    
Her eyes danced at the prospect, and Hamilton, who had vowed that  nothing should induce him to enter a family where he was not welcome,  was by now so hopelessly in love that he was ready to order the chaise  and four at once. He remained until Mrs. Cochraine sent him home, then  walked up the hill toward Headquarters, keeping to the road by instinct,  for he was deep in a reverie on the happiness of the past hours. His  dreams were cruelly shattered by the pressure of a bayonet against his  breast.    
"What?" he demanded. "Oh, the countersign." He racked his memory. It had  fled, terrified, from his brain under the rush of that evening's  emotions.    
"I can't remember it," he said haughtily; "but you know who I am. Let me  pass." The sentry stood like a fate.    
"This is ridiculous!" cried Hamilton, angrily, then the absurdity of the  situation overcame him, and he laughed. Once more he searched his brain  for the countersign, which he remembered having given to little Ford  just after dinner. Mrs. Ford and her son retained two rooms in the  house, and Hamilton frequently gave the youngster the word, that he  might play in the village after dark. Suddenly he saw him approaching.  He darted down the road, secured the password, and returned in triumph  to the sentry.    
"Sir," exclaimed the soldier, in dismay, "is this quite regular? Will  you give me your word, sir, that it is all right?"    
"I vow that no harm shall come to you," said Hamilton. "Shoulder your  musket." And there the incident ended, so far as the soldier was  concerned, but young Ford carried the story to Headquarters, and it was  long before Hamilton heard the last of it.    
There was no sleep in him that night. He went to his office and laboured  for hours over a verse which should adequately express the love  consuming him, and then he awoke Laurens and talked into that  sympathetic ear until it was time to break the ice and freshen himself  for work.    
His work that day was of a vastly different character from the  impassioned trifle of the night before. He obtained exemption from other  duty, and ordered luncheon and dinner brought to his office. One of the  most remarkable examples of Hamilton's mature genius at this age of  twenty-three is his long and elaborate letter to Robert Morris on the  financial condition of the country, written during the earliest period  of his love for Elizabeth Schuyler. As passionate and impatient as he  was tender, alive in every part of his nature to the joy of a real  affection and to the prospect of a lasting happiness, he yet was able  for twelve hours at a time to shut his impending bride in the remotest  cupboard of his mind, nor heed her sighs. But there was an older love  than Elizabeth Schuyler: a ragged poverty-stricken creature by this,  cowering before dangers within and without, raving mad at times,  imbecile at others, filling her shattered body with patent nostrums, yet  throughout her long course of futilities and absurdities making a  desperate attempt to shade the battered lamp of liberty from the fatal  draught. Her name was the United States of America, and never was there  a more satiric misnomer. If the States chose to obey the requisitions of  the Congress, they obeyed them; but as a rule they did not. There was no  power in the land to enforce obedience; and they hated each other. As  the Congress had demonstrated its inefficiency to the most inactive in  public affairs, the contempt of the States is hardly to be wondered at.  It is not too much to say that troops were recruited by Washington's  influence alone, and kept from mutiny by his immortal magnetism. The  finances of the Revolution were in such a desperate condition that Sir  Henry Clinton built his hopes of success--now he had discovered that no  victory gave him a permanent advantage--upon the dissolution of the  American army, possibly an internal war. With depreciated bills in  circulation amounting to one hundred and sixty millions of dollars, a  public debt of nearly forty millions in foreign and domestic loans, the  Congress had, in March, ordered a new emission of bills; the result had  been a season of crazy speculation and the expiring gasp of public  credit. In addition to an unpaid army, assurances had been given to the  French minister that not less than twenty-five thousand men should be  ready for the next campaign; and how to force the States to recruit  them, and how to pay them when in the field, was the present question  between Headquarters and Congress.    
From the time that Hamilton's mind had turned to finance, in his  nineteenth year, he had devoted the greater part of his leisure to the  study and thought of it. Books on the subject were few in those days;  the science of political economy was unborn, so far as Hamilton was  concerned, for Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations," published in 1776, had  not made its way to America. He assimilated all the data there was to be  found, then poured it into the crucible of his creative faculty, and  gradually evolved the great scheme of finance which is the locomotive of  the United States to-day. During many long winter evenings he had talked  his ideas over with Washington, and it was with the Chief's full  approval that he finally went to work on the letter embodying his scheme  for the immediate relief of the country. It was addressed to Robert  Morris, the Financier of the Revolution.    
The first part of the letter was an essay on inflated and depreciated  currency, applied personally, the argument based on the three following  points: There having been no money in the country, Congress had been  unable to avoid the issuance of paper money. The only way to obtain and  retire this immense amount of depreciated paper money was to obtain real  money. Real money could be obtained in one way only,--by a foreign loan.  He then elaborately disposed of the proposed insane methods of applying  this projected loan which were agitating the Congress. But he was an  architect and builder as well as an iconoclast, and having shown the  futility of every financial idea ever conceived by Congress, he  proceeded to the remedy. His scheme, then as ever, was a National Bank,  to be called The Bank of the United States; the capital to be a foreign  loan of two millions sterling.    
This letter, even in its details, in the knowledge of human nature it  betrays, and in its scheme to combine public and private capital that  the wealthy men of the country should, in their own interests, be  compelled to support the government, reads like an easy example in  arithmetic to-day; but a hundred and twenty years ago it was so bold and  advanced that Morris dared to adopt several of its suggestions in part  only, and founded the bank of Pennsylvania on the greater plan, by way  of experiment. No one but Hamilton could carry out his own theories.    
Hamilton, who often had odd little attacks of modesty, signed the  letter, James Montague; address, Morristown. He read it to Washington  before posting.    
The Chief, whose men were aching, sighed heavily.    
"They will pick a few crumbs out of it," he said. "But they will not  make a law of it in toto; the millennium is not yet come. But if it  gives them one idea we should be thankful, it being a long and weary  time since they have experienced that phenomenon. If it does not, I  doubt if these men fight another battle. I wonder if posterity will ever  realize the indifference of their three million ancestors to the war  which gave them their independence--if we accomplish that end. I ask for  soldiers and am treated much as if I had asked for my neighbour's wife.  I ask for money to keep them from starving and freezing and am made to  feel like an importunate beggar."    
"I had a letter from Hugh Knox not so long since," said Hamilton, in his  lightest tone; for Washington was on the verge of one of his attacks of  infuriated depression, which were picturesque but wearing. "He  undertakes to play the prophet, and he is an uncommon clever man, sir:  he says that you were created for the express purpose of delivering  America, to do it single-handed, if necessary, and that my proud destiny  is to be your biographer. The first I indorse, so does every thinking  man in the country. But for the second--alas! I am not equal to a post  of such exalted honour."    
Washington smiled. "No one knows better than your old Chief that your  destiny is no such ha'penny affair as that. But at least you wouldn't  make an ass of me. God knows what is in store for me at the hands of  scribblers."    
"You lend yourself fatally well to marble and stone, sir," said  Hamilton, mischievously. "I fear your biographers will conceive  themselves writing at the feet of a New World Sphinx, and that its  frozen granite loneliness will petrify their image of you."    
"I like the prospect! I am unhappily conscious of my power to chill an  assemblage, but the cold formality of my manner is a safeguard, as you  know. My nature is one of extremes; if I did not encase myself, I should  be ramming every man's absurd opinions down his throat, and letting my  cursed temper fly at each of the provocations which constantly beset me.  I have not the happy gift of compromise; but I am not unhuman, and I  like not the prospect of going down to posterity a wooden figurehead  upon some emblematic battle-ship. Perhaps, my boy, you, who best know  me, will be moved by charity to be my biographer, after all."    
"I'll make it the business of my old age, sir; I pledge you my word, and  no one loves you better nor can do you such justice as I. When my work  in the National Family is done, then shall I retire with my literary  love, an old and pleasant love; and what higher subject for my pen?"    
He spoke in a tone of badinage, for he was bent on screwing up  Washington's spirits, but he made his promise in good faith,  nevertheless, and Washington looked at him with deep affection.    
"My mind is certainly easier," he said, in a tone that was almost light.  "Go now and post your letter, and give your evening to Miss Schuyler.  Present my compliments to her."    
"I became engaged to her last night, sir."    
"Ah! had you forgotten to tell me?"    
"No, sir; I have but just remembered it."    
Washington laughed heartily. "Mind you never tell her that," he said.  "Women love the lie that saves their pride, but never an unflattering  truth. You have learned your lesson young,--to put a tempting face aside  when duty demands every faculty; it is a lesson which takes most men  longest to learn. I could tell you some amusing stories of rough and  tumbles in my mind between the divine image of the hour and some affair  of highest moment. But to a brain like yours all things are possible."    
He rose, and took Hamilton's hand and shook it warmly.    
"God bless you," he said. "Your future unrolls to my vision, brilliant  and happy. I deeply wish that it may be so."
