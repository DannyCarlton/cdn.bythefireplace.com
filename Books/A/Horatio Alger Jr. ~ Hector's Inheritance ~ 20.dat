    There were two persons on whom Ben Platt's declaration made a   profound impression. These were Jim Smith and his uncle, the learned   Socrates. The latter was surprised, for he was fully persuaded that   the charge he had made was a true one, and Hector was a thief. As  for  Jim, his surprise was of a very disagreeable nature. Knowing as  he did  that, he himself had taken the money, he was alarmed lest his  offense  was to be made known, and that the pit which he had digged  for another  should prove to be provided for himself. 
  Socrates was the first to speak after taking time to recover  himself  from his surprise. 
  &quot;This is a very extraordinary statement, Platt,&quot; he said. &quot;You say   you can prove Roscoe's innocence?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Platt, firmly. 
  &quot;I wish no trifling here, sir,&quot; said the principal, sharply. &quot;I   myself found the wallet in Roscoe's pocket.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Ben Platt, &quot;I know it was there.&quot; 
  &quot;You knew it was there!&quot; repeated Socrates. &quot;How did you know it  was  there?&quot; 
  &quot;Because I saw it put in.&quot; 
  Here Jim Smith's face turned from red to pale, and he moved about   uneasily in his seat. &quot;Could Ben Platt have been hidden somewhere in   the room?&quot; he asked himself, &quot;If so, what was he to do?&quot; There was   but one answer to this question. He must brazen it out, and boldly   contradict the witness. But he would bide his time. He would wait to   hear what Ben had to say. 
  &quot;Did you put it in yourself?&quot; asked Socrates, savagely. 
  &quot;No, Mr. Smith, I didn't put it in,&quot; answered Ben, indignantly. 
  &quot;None of your impudence, sir!&quot; said the schoolmaster, irritated. 
  &quot;I merely answered your question and defended myself,&quot; answered  Ben. 
  There was a little murmur among the pupils, showing that their   sympathy was with the boy who had been so causelessly accused by the   principal. 
  &quot;Silence!&quot; exclaimed Socrates, annoyed. &quot;Now,&quot; he continued,  turning  to Ben, &quot;since you know who put the wallet into Roscoe's  pocket&#8212;a  very remarkable statement, by the way&#8212;will you deign to  inform me  who did it?&quot; 
  &quot;James Smith did it!&quot; said Ben, looking over to the principal's   nephew, who was half expecting such an attack. 
  &quot;It's a base lie!&quot; cried Jim, but his face was blanched, his manner   was nervous and confused, and he looked guilty, if he were not so. 
  &quot;My nephew?&quot; asked Socrates, flurried. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't so, Uncle Socrates,&quot; said Jim, excited. &quot;I'll lick you,   Ben Platt, when we get out of school.&quot; 
  &quot;You forget yourself, James,&quot; said Socrates, with a mildness he   would not have employed with any other pupil. 
  &quot;I beg your pardon, Uncle Socrates,&quot; said Jim, with contrition,  &quot;but  I can't be silent when I am accused of things I don't do.&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure, you have some excuse, but you should remember the   respect you owe to me. Then you did not do it?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly not, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;So it appears, Platt, that you have brought a false charge against   your fellow-pupil,&quot; said Mr. Smith, severely. &quot;I can conceive of   nothing meaner.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Smith,&quot; said Hector, &quot;what right have you to say that the   charge is false? Is it the denial of your nephew? If he took the   wallet he would, of course, deny it.&quot; 
  &quot;So would you!&quot; retorted Socrates. 
  &quot;No one saw me conceal it,&quot; said Hector, significantly. 
  Then Wilkins rose. 
  &quot;Mr. Smith,&quot; he said, &quot;I have some evidence to offer.&quot; 
  &quot;Out with it, sir,&quot; said the principal, angrily, for he was  fighting  against an iaward conviction that his nephew was really the  guilty  party. 
  &quot;I was walking along the corridor about the time Platt speaks of   Smith's visit to Roscoe's room, and I met your nephew walking in the   opposite direction. When I entered the room, Platt told me that,   half-concealed by the closet door, he had seen Jim Smith enter and   thrust the wallet into Roscoe's pocket. Soon after, you and Mrs.   Smith came into the room, guided by your nephew, who let you know   just where the wallet was hidden. He had very good reasons for   knowing,&quot; added Wilkins. 
  If a look would have annihilated Wilkins, the look directed towards   him by Jim Smith would have had that effect. 
  &quot;It's a conspiracy against me, Uncle Socrates,&quot; said Jim, intent   upon brazening it out. &quot;They're all in league together.&quot; 
  &quot;The testimony of Wilkins doesn't amount to much!&quot; said Mr. Smith.   &quot;He may have seen James in the corridor, but that is by no means a   part of his complicity in this affair.&quot; 
  &quot;Just so!&quot; said Jim, eagerly. 
  &quot;Ben Platt's evidence ought to count for something,&quot; said Hector.   &quot;He saw your nephew putting the wallet into the pocket of my pants.&quot; 
  Socrates was clearly perplexed. In spite of his partiality for his   nephew, the case against him certainly looked very strong. 
  Hector, however, determined to make his defense even stronger. 
  &quot;I would like to ask Platt,&quot; he said, &quot;at what time this took   place?&quot; 
  &quot;At three o'clock.&quot; 
  &quot;How do you know it was three?&quot; asked the principal, sharply. 
  &quot;Because I heard the clock on the village church strike three.&quot; 
  &quot;I would like to ask another boy&#8212;Frank Lewis&#8212;if he heard the  clock  strike three?&quot; 
  Lewis answered in the affirmative. 
  &quot;Where were you at the time?&quot; 
  &quot;In the playground.&quot; 
  &quot;What were you doing?&quot; 
  &quot;Playing ball.&quot; 
  &quot;Was I in the game?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;How long had the game been going on?&quot; 
  &quot;Half an hour.&quot; 
  &quot;How long had the game been going on, do you know?&quot; 
  &quot;From half to three-quarters of an hour.&quot; 
  &quot;Can you remember whether I was with you all the time?&quot; 
  &quot;You were.&quot; 
  &quot;Now, Platt, will you tell me how long after the wallet was put  into  my pocket before Mr. Smith appeared in search of it?&quot; 
  &quot;Not over half an hour.&quot; 
  &quot;I submit, then,&quot; said Hector, in a matter-of-fact manner, &quot;that I   was absent in the playground during the entire time when it was  found  in my room. I believe this is what lawyers call an alibi that  I have,  fortunately, been able to prove.&quot; 
  &quot;You are a very smart lawyer!&quot; sneered the principal. 
  The boys were by this time so incensed at Mr. Smith's evident  effort  to clear his nephew at the expense of Roscoe, that there was a  very  audible hiss, in which at least half a dozen joined. 
  &quot;Is this rebellion?&quot; asked Socrates, furiously. 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; said Ben Platt, firmly. &quot;We want justice done; that is   all.&quot; 
  &quot;You shall have justice&#8212;all of you!&quot; exclaimed Socrates, carried   beyond the limits of prudence. 
  &quot;I am glad to hear that, sir,&quot; said Hector. &quot;If you do not at once   exonerate me from this charge, which you know to be false, and write   to my guardian retracting it, I will bring the matter before the   nearest magistrate.&quot; 
  This was more than Socrates had bargained for. He saw that he had   gone too far, and was likely to wreck his prospects and those of the   school. 
  &quot;I will look into the matter,&quot; he said, hurriedly, &quot;and report to   the school hereafter. You may now apply yourselves to your studies.&quot;
