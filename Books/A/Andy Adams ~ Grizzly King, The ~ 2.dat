  With the silence and immobility of a great reddish-tinted, rock,  Thor stood for many minutes looking out over his domain. He could not  see far, for, like all grizzlies, his eyes were small and far apart,  and his vision was bad. At a distance of a third or a half a mile he  could make out a goat or a mountain sheep, but beyond that his world  was a vast sun-filled or night-darkened mystery through which he ranged  mostly by the guidance of sound and smell.
  It was the sense of smell that held him still and motionless now. Up  out of the valley a scent had come to his nostrils that he had never  smelled before. It was something that did not belong there, and it  stirred him strangely. Vainly his slow-working brute mind struggled to  comprehend it. It was not caribou, for he had killed many caribou; it  was not goat; it was not sheep; and it was not the smell of the fat and  lazy whistlers sunning themselves on the rocks, for he had eaten  hundreds of whistlers. It was a scent that did not enrage him, and  neither did it frighten him. He was curious, and yet he did not go down  to seek it out. Caution held him back.
  If Thor could have seen distinctly for a mile, or two miles, his  eyes would have discovered even less than the wind brought to him from  down the valley. He stood at the edge of a little plain, with the  valley an eighth of a mile below him, and the break over which he had  come that afternoon an eighth of a mile above him. The plain was very  much like a cup, perhaps an acre in extent, in the green slope of the  mountain. It was covered with rich, soft grass and June flowers,  mountain violets and patches of forget-me-nots, and wild asters and  hyacinths, and in the centre of it was a fifty-foot spatter of soft mud  which Thor visited frequently when his feet became rock-sore.
  To the east and the west and the north of him spread out the  wonderful panorama of the Canadian Rockies, softened in the golden  sunshine of a June afternoon.
  From up and down the valley, from the breaks between the peaks, and  from the little gullies cleft in shale and rock that crept up to the  snow-lines came a soft and droning murmur. It was the music of running  water. That music was always in the air, for the rivers, the creeks,  and the tiny streams gushing down from the snow that lay eternally up  near the clouds were never still.
  There were sweet perfumes as well as music in the air. June and  July&#8212;the last of spring and the first of summer in the northern  mountains&#8212;were commingling. The earth was bursting with green; the  early flowers were turning the sunny slopes into coloured splashes of  red and white and purple, and everything that had life was singing&#8212;the  fat whistlers on their rocks, the pompous little gophers on their  mounds, the big bumblebees that buzzed from flower to flower, the hawks  in the valley, and the eagles over the peaks. Even Thor was singing in  his way, for as he had paddled through the soft mud a few minutes  before he had rumbled curiously deep down in his great chest. It was  not a growl or a roar or a snarl; it was the noise he made when he was  contented. It was his song.
  And now, for some mysterious reason, there had suddenly come a  change in this wonderful day for him. Motionless he still sniffed the  wind. It puzzled him. It disquieted him without alarming him. To the  new and strange smell that was in the air he was as keenly sensitive as  a child's tongue to the first sharp touch of a drop of brandy. And  then, at last, a low and sullen growl came like a distant roll of  thunder from out of his chest. He was overlord of these domains, and  slowly his brain told him that there should be no smell which he could  not comprehend, and of which he was not the master.
  Thor reared up slowly, until the whole nine feet of him rested on  his haunches, and he sat like a trained dog, with his great forefeet,  heavy with mud, drooping in front of his chest. For ten years he had  lived in these mountains and never had he smelled that smell. He defied  it. He waited for it, while it came stronger and nearer. He did not  hide himself. Clean-cut and unafraid, he stood up.
  He was a monster in size, and his new June coat shone a golden brown  in the sun. His forearms were almost as large as a man's body; the  three largest of his five knifelike claws were five and a half inches  long; in the mud his feet had left tracks that were fifteen inches from  tip to tip. He was fat, and sleek, and powerful. His eyes, no larger  than hickory nuts, were eight inches apart. His two upper fangs, sharp  as stiletto points, were as long as a man's thumb, and between his  great jaws he could crush the neck of a caribou.
  Thor's life had been free of the presence of man, and he was not  ugly. Like most grizzlies, he did not kill for the pleasure of killing.  Out of a herd he would take one caribou, and he would eat that caribou  to the marrow in the last bone. He was a peaceful king. He had one law:  &#8220;Let me alone!&#8221; he said, and the voice of that law was in his attitude  as he sat on his haunches sniffing the strange smell.
  In his massive strength, in his aloneness and his supremacy, the  great bear was like the mountains, unrivalled in the valleys as they  were in the skies. With the mountains, he had come down out of the  ages. He was part of them. The history of his race had begun and was  dying among them, and they were alike in many ways. Until this day he  could not remember when anything had come to question his might and his  right&#8212;except those of his own kind. With such rivals he had fought  fairly and more than once to the death. He was ready to fight again, if  it came to a question of sovereignty over the ranges which he claimed  as his own. Until he was beaten he was dominator, arbiter, and despot,  if he chose to be. He was dynast of the rich valleys and the green  slopes, and liege lord of all living things about him. He had won and  kept these things openly, without strategy or treachery. He was hated  and he was feared, but he was without hatred or fear of his own&#8212;and he  was honest. Therefore he waited openly for the strange thing that was  coming to him from down the valley.
  As he sat on his haunches, questioning the air with his keen brown  nose, something within him was reaching back into dim and bygone  generations. Never before had he caught the taint that was in his  nostrils, yet now that it came to him it did not seem altogether new.  He could not place it. He could not picture it. Yet he knew that it was  a menace and a threat.
  For ten minutes he sat like a carven thing on his haunches. Then the  wind shifted, and the scent grew less and less, until it was gone  altogether.
  Thor's flat ears lifted a little. He turned his huge head slowly so  that his eyes took in the green slope and the tiny plain. He easily  forgot the smell now that the air was clear and sweet again. He dropped  on his four feet, and resumed his gopher-hunting.
  There was something of humour in his hunt. Thor weighed a thousand  pounds; a mountain gopher is six inches long and weighs six ounces. Yet  Thor would dig energetically for an hour, and rejoice at the end by  swallowing the fat little gopher like a pill; it was his<I> bonne  bouche</I>, the luscious tidbit in the quest of which he spent a third  of his spring and summer digging.
  He found a hole located to his satisfaction and began throwing out  the earth like a huge dog after a rat. He was on the crest of the  slope. Once or twice during the next half-hour he lifted his head, but  he was no longer disturbed by the strange smell that had come to him  with the wind.
