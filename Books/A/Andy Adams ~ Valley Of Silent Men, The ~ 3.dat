  Again the world came back to Kent, the world that lay just beyond   his open window. But scarcely had O'Connor gone when it began to   change, and in spite of his determination to keep hold of his  nerve  Kent felt creeping up with that change a thing that was  oppressive and  smothering. Swiftly the distant billowings of the  forests were  changing their tones and colors under the darkening  approach of storm.  The laughter of the hills and ridges went out.  The shimmer of spruce  and cedar and balsam turned to a somber  black. The flashing gold and  silver of birch and poplar dissolved  into a ghostly and unanimated  gray that was almost invisible. A  deepening and somber gloom spread  itself like a veil over the  river that only a short time before had  reflected the glory of the  sun in the faces of dark-visaged men of the  Company brigade. And  with the gloom came steadily nearer a low  rumbling of thunder. 
  For the first time since the mental excitement of his confession   Kent felt upon him an appalling loneliness. He still was not  afraid  of death, but a part of his philosophy was gone. It was,  after all, a  difficult thing to die alone. He felt that the  pressure in his chest  was perceptible greater than it had been an  hour or two before, and  the thought grew upon him that it would be  a terrible thing for the  &quot;explosion&quot; to come when the sun was not  shining. He wanted O'Connor  back again. He had the desire to call  out for Cardigan. He would have  welcomed Father Layonne with a  glad cry. Yet more than all else would  he have had at his side in  these moments of distress a woman. For the  storm, as it massed  heavier and nearer, filling the earth with its  desolation, bridged  vast spaces for him, and he found himself suddenly  face to face  with the might-have-beens of yesterday. 
  He saw, as he had never guessed before, the immeasurable gulf   between helplessness and the wild, brute freedom of man, and his  soul  cried out&#8212;not for adventure, not for the savage strength of  life&#8212;but  for the presence of a creature frailer than himself, yet  in the gentle  touch of whose hand lay the might of all humanity. 
  He struggled with himself. He remembered that Dr. Cardigan had   told him there would be moments of deep depression, and he tried  to  fight himself out of the grip of this that was on him. There  was a  bell at hand, but he refused to use it, for he sensed his  own  cowardice. His cigar had gone out, and he relighted it. He  made an  effort to bring his mind back to O'Connor, and the mystery  girl, and  Kedsty. He tried to visualize McTrigger, the man he had  saved from the  hangman, waiting for Kedsty in the office at  barracks. He pictured the  girl, as O'Connor had described her,  with her black hair and blue  eyes&#8212;and then the storm broke. 
  The rain came down in a deluge, and scarcely had it struck when   the door opened and Cardigan hurried in to close the window. He   remained for half an hour, and after that young Mercer, one of his   two assistants, came in at intervals. Late in the afternoon it  began  to clear up, and Father Layonne returned with papers  properly made out  for Kent's signature. He was with Kent until  sundown, when Mercer came  in with supper. 
  Between that hour and ten o'clock Kent observed a vigilance on the   part of Dr. Cardigan which struck him as being unusual. Four times  he  listened with the stethoscope at his chest, but when Kent asked  the  question which was in his mind, Cardigan shook his head. 
  &quot;It's no worse, Kent. I don't think it will happen tonight.&quot; 
  In spite of this assurance Kent was positive there was in   Cardigan's manner an anxiety of a different quality than he had   perceived earlier in the day. The thought was a definite and   convincing one. He believed that Cardigan was smoothing the way  with  a professional lie. 
  He had no desire to sleep. His light was turned low, and his   window was open again, for the night had cleared. Never had air   tasted sweeter to him than that which came in through his window.  The  little bell in his watch tinkled the hour of eleven, when he  heard  Cardigan's door close for a last time across the hall. After  that  everything was quiet. He drew himself nearer to the window,  so that by  leaning forward he could rest himself partly on the  sill. He loved the  night. The mystery and lure of those still  hours of darkness when the  world slept had never ceased to hold  their fascination for him. Night  and he were friends. He had  discovered many of its secrets. A thousand  times he had walked  hand in hand with the spirit of it, approaching  each time a little  nearer to the heart of it, mastering its life, its  sound, the  whispering languages of that &quot;other side of life&quot; which  rises  quietly and as if in fear to live and breathe long after the sun   has gone out. To him it was more wonderful than day. 
  And this night that lay outside his window now was magnificent.   Storm had washed the atmosphere between earth and sky, and it  seemed  as though the stars had descended nearer to his forests,  shining in  golden constellations. The moon was coming up late, and  he watched the  ruddy glow of it as it rode up over the wilderness,  a splendid queen  entering upon a stage already prepared by the  lesser satellites for  her coming. No longer was Kent oppressed or  afraid. In still deeper  inhalations he drank the night air into  his lungs, and in him there  seemed to grow slowly a new strength.  His eyes and ears were wide open  and attentive. The town was  asleep, but a few lights burned dimly here  and there along the  river's edge, and occasionally a lazy sound came  up to him&#8212;the  clink of a scow chain, the bark of a dog, the rooster  crowing. In  spite of himself he smiled at that. Old Duperow's rooster  was a  foolish bird and always crowed himself hoarse when the moon was   bright. And in front of him, not far away, were two white,   lightning-shriven spruce stubs standing like ghosts in the night.  In  one of these a pair of owls had nested, and Kent listened to  the  queer, chuckling notes of their honeymooning and the flutter  of their  wings as they darted out now and then in play close to  his window. And  then suddenly he heard the sharp snap of their  beaks. An enemy was  prowling near, and the owls were giving  warning. He thought he heard a  step. In another moment or two the  step was unmistakable. Some one was  approaching his window from  the end of the building. He leaned over  the sill and found himself  staring into O'Connor's face. 
  &quot;These confounded feet of mine!&quot; grunted the staff-sergeant. &quot;Were   you asleep, Kent?&quot; 
  &quot;Wide-awake as those owls,&quot; assured Kent. 
  O'Connor drew up to the window. &quot;I saw your light and thought you   were awake,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to make sure Cardigan wasn't with   you. I don't want him to know I am here. And&#8212;if you don't mind&#8212;   will you turn off the light? Kedsty is awake, too&#8212;as wide-awake  as  the owls.&quot; 
  Kent reached out a hand, and his room was in darkness except for   the glow of moon and stars. O'Connor's bulk at the window shut out  a  part of this. His face was half in gloom. 
  &quot;It's a crime to come to you like this, Kent,&quot; he said, keeping   his big voice down to a whisper. &quot;But I had to. It's my last  chance.  And I know there's something wrong. Kedsty is getting me  out of the  way&#8212;because I was with him when he met the girl over  in the poplar  bush. I'm detailed on special duty up at Fort  Simpson, two thousand  miles by water if it's a foot! It means six  months or a year. We leave  in the motor boat at dawn to overtake  Rossand and his outfit, so I had  to take this chance of seeing  you. I hesitated until I knew that some  one was awake in your  room.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm glad you came,&quot; said Kent warmly. &quot;And&#8212;good God, how I would   like to go with you, Bucky! If it wasn't for this thing in my  chest,  ballooning up for an explosion&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I wouldn't be going,&quot; interrupted O'Connor in a low voice. &quot;If   you were on your feet, Kent, there are a number of things that   wouldn't be happening. Something mighty queer has come over Kedsty   since this morning. He isn't the Kedsty you knew yesterday or for  the  last ten years. He's nervous, and I miss my guess if he isn't   constantly on the watch for some one. And he's afraid of me. I  know  it. He's afraid of me because I saw him go to pieces when he  met that  girl. Fort Simpson is simply a frame-up to get me away  for a time. He  tried to smooth the edge off the thing by promising  me an  inspectorship within the year. That was this afternoon, just  before  the storm. Since then&#8212;&quot; 
  O'Connor turned and faced the moonlight for a moment. 
  &quot;Since then I've been on a still-hunt for the girl and Sandy   McTrigger,&quot; he added. &quot;And they've disappeared, Kent. I guess   McTrigger just melted away into the woods. But it's the girl that   puzzles me. I've questioned every scow cheman at the Landing. I've   investigated every place where she might have got food or lodging,   and I bribed Mooie, the old trailer, to search the near-by timber.   The unbelievable part of it isn't her disappearance. It's the fact   that not a soul in Athabasca Landing has seen her! Sounds  incredible,  doesn't it? And then, Kent, the big hunch came to me.  Remember how  we've always played up to the big hunch? And this one  struck me  strong. I think I know where the girl is.&quot; 
  Kent, forgetful of his own impending doom, was deeply interested   in the thrill of O'Connor's mystery. He had begun to visualize the   situation. More than once they had worked out enigmas of this kind   together, and the staff-sergeant saw the old, eager glow in his  eyes.  And Kent chuckled joyously in that thrill of the game of  man-hunting,  and said: 
  &quot;Kedsty is a bachelor and doesn't even so much as look at a woman.   But he likes home life&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And has built himself a log bungalow somewhat removed from the   town,&quot; added O'Connor. 
  &quot;And his Chinaman cook and housekeeper is away.&quot; 
  &quot;And the bungalow is closed, or supposed to be.&quot; 
  &quot;Except at night, when Kedsty goes there to sleep.&quot; 
  O'Connor's hand gripped Kent's. &quot;Jimmy, there never was a team in   N Division that could beat us, The girl is hiding at Kedsty's  place!&quot; 
  &quot;But why HIDING?&quot; insisted Kent. &quot;She hasn't committed a crime.&quot; 
  O'Connor sat silent for a moment. Kent could hear him stuffing the   bowl of his pipe. 
  &quot;It's simply the big hunch,&quot; he grunted. &quot;It's got hold of me,   Kent, and I can't throw it off. Why, man&#8212;&quot; 
  He lighted a match in the cup of his hands, and Kent saw his face.   There was more than uncertainty in the hard, set lines of it. 
  &quot;You see, I went back to the poplars again after I left you   today,&quot; O'Connor went on. &quot;I found her footprints. She had turned  off  the trail, and in places they were very clear. 
  &quot;She had on high-heeled shoes, Kent&#8212;those Frenchy things&#8212;and I   swear her feet can't be much bigger than a baby's! I found where   Kedsty caught up with her, and the moss was pretty well beaten  down.  He returned through the poplars, but the girl went on and  into the  edge of the spruce. I lost her trail there. By traveling  in that  timber it was possible for her to reach Kedsty's bungalow  without  being seen. It must have been difficult going, with shoes  half as big  as my hand and heels two inches high! And I've been  wondering, why  didn't she wear bush-country shoes or moccasins?&quot; 
  &quot;Because she came from the South and not the North,&quot; suggested   Kent. &quot;Probably up from Edmonton.&quot; 
  &quot;Exactly. And Kedsty wasn't expecting her, was he? If he had been,   that first sight of her wouldn't have shattered every nerve in his   body. That's why the big hunch won't let loose of me, Kent. From  the  moment he saw her, he was a different man. His attitude toward  you  changed instantly. If he could save you now by raising his  little  finger, he wouldn't do it, simply because it's absolutely  necessary  for him to have an excuse for freeing McTrigger. Your  confession came  at just the psychological moment. The girl's  unspoken demand there in  the poplars was that he free McTrigger,  and it was backed up by a  threat which Kedsty understood and which  terrified him to his marrow.  McTrigger must have seen him  afterward, for he waited at the office  until Kedsty came. I don't  know what passed between them. Constable  Doyle says they were  together for half an hour. Then McTrigger walked  out of barracks,  and no one has seen him since. It's mighty queer. The  whole thing  is queer. And the queerest part of the whole business is  this  sudden commission of mine at Fort Simpson.&quot; 
  Kent leaned back against his pillows. His breath came in a series   of short, hacking coughs. In the star glow O'Connor saw his face  grow  suddenly haggard and tired-looking, and he leaned far in so  that in  both his own hands he held one of Kent's. 
  &quot;I'm tiring you, Jimmy,&quot; he said huskily. &quot;Good-by, old pal!  I&#8212;I&#8212;&quot;  He hesitated and then lied steadily. &quot;I'm going up to take a   look around Kedsty's place. I won't be gone more than half an hour   and will stop on my way back. If you're asleep&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I won't be asleep,&quot; said Kent. 
  O'Connor's hands gripped closer. &quot;Good-by, Jimmy.&quot; 
  &quot;Good-by.&quot; And then, as O'Connor stepped back into the night,   Kent's voice called after him softly: &quot;I'll be with you on the  long  trip, Bucky. Take care of yourself&#8212;always.&quot; 
  O'Connor's answer was a sob, a sob that rose in his throat like a   great fist, and choked him, and filled his eyes with scalding  tears  that shut out the glow of moon and stars. And he did not go  toward  Kedsty's, but trudged heavily in the direction of the  river, for he  knew that Kent had called his lie, and that they had  said their last  farewell.
