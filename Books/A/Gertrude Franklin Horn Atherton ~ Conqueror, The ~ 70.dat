Congress adjourned while the excitement was at its height. Washington  went to Mount Vernon, the Cabinet scattered, and there was an interval  of peace. Philadelphia in summer was always unhealthy, and liable to an  outbreak of fever at any moment. Hamilton sent his family to the  Schuyler estate at Saratoga. Mrs. Croix had gone as early as May to the  New England coast; for even her magnificent constitution had felt the  strain of that exciting session, and Philadelphia was not too  invigorating in winter. Hamilton remained alone in his home, glad of the  abundant leisure which the empty city afforded to catch up with the  arrears of his work, to design methods for financial relief against the  time to apply them, and to prepare his Report on Manufactures, a paper  destined to become as celebrated and almost as widespread in its  influence as the great Report on Public Credit. It required days and  nights of thinking, research, correspondence, comparison, and writing;  and how in the midst of all this mass of business, this keen anxiety  regarding the whirlwind of speculation--which was involving some of the  leading men in the country, and threatening the young Government with a  new disaster; how, while sitting up half the night with his finger on  the public pulse, waiting for the right moment to apply his remedies, he  managed to entangle himself in a personal difficulty, would be an  inscrutable mystery, were any man but Alexander Hamilton in question.    
I shall not enter into the details of the Reynolds affair. No intrigue  was ever less interesting. Nor should I make even a passing allusion to  it, were it not for its political ultimates. A couple of blackmailers  laid a trap for the Secretary of the Treasury, and he walked into it, as  the wisest of men have done before and since, when the woman has been  sufficiently attractive at the right moment. This woman was common and  sordid, but she was young and handsome, and her affectation of violent  attachment, if ungrammatical, was plausible enough to convince any man  accustomed to easy conquest; and the most astute of men, provided his  passions be strong enough, can be fooled by any woman at once designing  and seductive. Ardent susceptibility was in the very essence of  Hamilton, with Scotland and France in his blood, the West Indies the  mould of his youthful being, and the stormy inheritance of his parents.    
But although Hamilton might succumb to a woman of Mrs. Reynold's type,  she could not hold him. After liberally relieving the alleged pecuniary  distress of this charmer, and weary of her society, he did his best to  get rid of her. She protested. So did he. It was then that he was made  aware of the plot The woman's husband appeared, and announced that only  a thousand dollars would heal his wounded honour, and that if it were  not immediately forthcoming, he would write to Mrs. Hamilton.    
Hamilton was furious. His first impulse was to tell the man to do his  worst, for anything in the nature of coercion stripped him for the fray  at once. But an hour of reflection cooled his blood. No one was to blame  but himself. If he had permitted himself to be made a fool of, it was  but just that he should take the consequences, and not cruelly wound the  woman he loved the better for his vagaries. Moreover, such a scandal  would seriously affect the high office he filled, might indeed force him  to resignation; not only thwarting his great ambitions, but depriving  the country of services which no other man had the ability or the will  to render. And a few moments forecast of the triumph of his enemies, not  only over himself but possibly over his party, in case of his downfall,  was sufficient in itself to force him to terms. Few are the momentous  occasions in which men are governed by a single motive. Hamilton's  ambitions were welded into the future happiness and glory of the country  he had so ardently adopted. And if love of power was his ruling passion,  it certainly was directed to the loftiest of ends. To desire to create a  nation out of the resources of a vast understanding, controlled by  wisdom and honour, is an ambition which should be dignified with a  higher name. Small and purely personal ambitions were unknown to  Hamilton, his gifts were given him for the elevation of the human race;  but he would rather have reigned in hell than have sunk to  insignificance on earth. As he remarked once to Kitty Livingston, the  complexity of man so far exceeds that of the average woman, complexity  being purely a matter of brain and having no roots whatever in sex, that  it were a waste of valuable time to analyze its ramifications, and the  crossings and entanglements of its threads. Hamilton paid the money,  yielded further to the extent of several hundred dollars, then the  people disappeared, and he hoped that he had heard the last of them.  Fortunately his habits were methodical, the result of his mercantile  training on St. Croix, and he preserved the correspondence.
