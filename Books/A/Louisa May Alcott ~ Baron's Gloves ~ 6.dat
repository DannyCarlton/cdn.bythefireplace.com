Helen looked serious and Amy indignant when their uncle joined them,  ready to set out by the afternoon train, all having dined and rested  after the morning's excursion.    
"Well, little girls, what's the matter now?" he asked, paternally, for  the excellent man adored his nieces.    
"Helen says it's not best to go on with the Pole, and is perfectly  nonsensical, uncle," began Amy, petulantly, and not very coherently.    
"Better be silly now than sorry by and by. I only suggested that,  being interesting, and Amy romantic, she might find this young man too  charming, if we see too much of him," said Helen.    
"Bless my soul, what an idea!" cried the major. "Why, Nell, he's an  invalid, a Catholic, and a foreigner, any one of which objections are  enough to settle that matter. Little Amy isn't so foolish as to be in  danger of losing her heart to a person so entirely out of the question  as this poor lad, is she?"    
"Of course not. <i>You</i> do me justice, uncle. Nell thinks she may pity  and pet any one she likes because she is five years older than I,  and entirely forgets that she is a great deal more attractive than a  feeble thing like me. I should as soon think of losing my heart to  Hoffman as to the Pole, even if he wasn't what he is. One may surely  be kind to a dying man, without being accused of coquetry;" and Amy  sobbed in the most heart-rending manner.    
Helen comforted her by withdrawing all objections, and promising  to leave the matter in the major's hands. But she shook her head  privately when she saw the ill-disguised eagerness with which her  cousin glanced up and down the platform after they were in the train,  and she whispered to her uncle, unobserved,--    
"Leave future meetings to chance, and don't ask the Pole in, if you  can help it."    
"Nonsense, my dear. You are as particular as your aunt. The lad amuses  me, and you can't deny you like to nurse sick heroes," was all the  answer she got, as the major, with true masculine perversity, put his  head out of the window and hailed Casimer as he was passing with a  bow.    
"Here, Teblinski, my good fellow, don't desert us. We've always a  spare seat for you, if you haven't pleasanter quarters."    
With a flush of pleasure the young man came up, but hesitated to  accept the invitation till Helen seconded it with a smile of welcome.    
Amy was in an injured mood, and, shrouded in a great blue veil,  pensively reclined in her corner as if indifferent to everything about  her. But soon the cloud passed, and she emerged in a radiant state of  good humor, which lasted unbroken until the journey ended.    
For two days they went on together, a very happy party, for the major  called in Hoffman to see his friend and describe the places through  which they passed. An arrangement very agreeable to all, as Karl was a  favorite, and every one missed him when away.    
At Lausanne they waited while he crossed the lake to secure rooms at  Vevay. On his return he reported that all the hotels and <i>pensions</i>  were full, but that at La Tour he had secured rooms for a few weeks in  a quaint old chateau on the banks of the lake.    
"Count Severin is absent in Egypt, and the housekeeper has permission  to let the apartments to transient visitors. The suite of rooms I  speak of were engaged to a party who are detained by sickness--they  are cheap, pleasant, and comfortable. A <i>salon</i> and four bed-rooms. I  engaged them all, thinking that Teblinski might like a room there till  he finds lodgings at Montreaux. We can enter at once, and I am sure  the ladies will approve of the picturesque place."    
"Well done, Hoffman; off we go without delay, for I really long to  rest my old bones in something like a home, after this long trip,"  said the major, who always kept his little troop in light marching  order.    
The sail across that loveliest of lakes prepared the new-comers to be  charmed with all they saw; and when, entering by the old stone gate,  they were led into a large saloon, quaintly furnished and opening into  a terrace-garden overhanging the water, with Chillon and the Alps in  sight, Amy declared nothing could be more perfect, and Helen's face  proved her satisfaction.    
An English widow and two quiet old German professors on a vacation  were the only inmates besides themselves and the buxom Swiss  housekeeper and her maids.    
It was late when our party arrived, and there was only time for a  hasty survey of their rooms and a stroll in the garden before dinner.    
The great chamber, with its shadowy bed, dark mirrors, ghostly  wainscot-doors and narrow windows, had not been brightened for a long  time by such a charming little apparition as Amy when she shook out  her airy muslins, smoothed her curls, and assumed all manner of  distracting devices for the captivation of mankind. Even Helen, though  not much given to personal vanity, found herself putting flowers in  her hair, and studying the effect of bracelets on her handsome arms,  as if there was some especial need of looking her best on this  occasion.    
Both were certainly great ornaments to the drawing-room that evening,  as the old professors agreed while they sat blinking at them, like a  pair of benign owls. Casimer surprised them by his skill in music,  for, though forbidden to sing on account of his weak lungs, he  played as if inspired. Amy hovered about him like a moth; the major  cultivated the acquaintance of the plump widow; and Helen stood at the  window, enjoying the lovely night and music, till something happened  which destroyed her pleasure in both.    
The window was open, and, leaning from it, she was watching the lake,  when the sound of a heavy sigh caught her ear. There was no moon, but  through the starlight she saw a man's figure among the shrubs below,  sitting with bent head and hidden face in the forlorn attitude of one  shut out from the music, light, and gayety that reigned within.    
"It is Karl," she thought, and was about to speak, when, as if  startled by some sound she did not hear, he rose and vanished in the  gloom of the garden.    
"Poor man! he thought of his wife and child, perhaps, sitting here  alone while all the rest make merry, with no care for him. Uncle must  see to this;" and Helen fell into a reverie till Amy came to propose  retiring.    
"I meant to have seen where all these doors led, but was so busy  dressing I had no time, so must leave it for my amusement to-morrow.  Uncle says it's a very Radcliffian place. How like an angel that man  did play!" chattered Amy, and lulled herself to sleep by humming the  last air Casimer had given them.    
Helen could not sleep, for the lonely figure in the garden haunted  her, and she wearied herself with conjectures about Hoffman and his  mystery. Hour after hour rung from the cuckoo-clock in the hall, but  still she lay awake, watching the curious shadows in the room, and  exciting herself with recalling the tales of German goblins with which  the courier had amused them the day before.    
"It is close and musty here, with all this old tapestry and stuff  about; I'll open the other window," she thought; and, noiselessly  slipping from Amy's side, she threw on wrapper and slippers, lighted  her candle and tried to unbolt the tall, diamond-paned lattice. It was  rusty and would not yield, and, giving it up, she glanced about to see  whence air could be admitted. There were four doors in the room, all  low and arched, with clumsy locks and heavy handles. One opened into  a closet, one into the passage; the third was locked, but the fourth  opened easily, and, lifting her light, she peeped into a small octagon  room, full of all manner of curiosities. What they were she had no  time to see, for her startled eyes were riveted on an object that  turned her faint and cold with terror.    
A heavy table stood in the middle of the room, and seated at it,  with some kind of weapon before him, was a man who looked over his  shoulder, with a ghastly face half hidden by hair and beard, and  fierce black eyes as full of malignant menace as was the clinched hand  holding the pistol. One instant Helen looked, the next flung to the  door, bolted it and dropped into a chair, trembling in every limb. The  noise did not wake Amy, and a moment's thought showed Helen the wisdom  of keeping her in ignorance of this affair. She knew the major was  close by, and possessing much courage, she resolved to wait a little  before rousing the house.    
Hardly had she collected herself, when steps were heard moving softly  in the octagon room. Her light had gone out as she closed the door,  and sitting close by in the dark, she heard the sound of some one  breathing as he listened at the key-hole. Then a careful hand tried  the door, so noiselessly that no sleeper would have been awakened; and  as if to guard against a second surprise, the unknown person drew two  bolts across the door and stole away.    
"Safe for a time; but I'll not pass another night under this roof,  unless this is satisfactorily cleared up," thought Helen, now feeling  more angry than frightened.    
The last hour that struck was three, and soon the summer dawn reddened  the sky. Dressing herself, Helen sat by Amy, a sleepless guard, till  she woke, smiling and rosy as a child. Saying nothing of her last  night's alarm, Helen went down to breakfast a little paler than usual,  but otherwise unchanged. The major never liked to be disturbed till  he had broken his fast, and the moment they rose from the table he  exclaimed,--    
"Now, girls, come and see the mysteries of Udolpho."    
"I'll say nothing, yet," thought Helen, feeling braver by daylight,  yet troubled by her secret, for Hoffman might be a traitor, and this  charming chateau a den of thieves. Such things had been, and she was  in a mood to believe anything.    
The upper story was a perfect museum of antique relics, very  entertaining to examine. Having finished these, Hoffman, who acted as  guide, led them into a little gloomy room containing a straw pallet,  a stone table with a loaf and pitcher on it, and, kneeling before a  crucifix, where the light from a single slit in the wall fell on him,  was the figure of a monk. The waxen mask was life-like, the attitude  effective, and the cell excellently arranged. Amy cried out when she  first saw it, but a second glance reassured her, and she patted the  bald head approvingly, as Karl explained.--    
"Count Severin is an antiquarian, and amuses himself with things of  this sort. In old times there really was a hermit here, and this is  his effigy. Come down these narrow stairs, if you please, and see the  rest of the mummery."    
Down they went, and the instant Helen looked about her, she burst into  a hysterical laugh, for there sat her ruffian, exactly as she saw him,  glaring over his shoulder with threatening eyes, and one hand on the  pistol. They all looked at her, for she was pale, and her merriment  unnatural; so, feeling she had excited curiosity, she gratified it by  narrating her night's adventure. Hoffman looked much concerned.    
"Pardon, mademoiselle, the door should have been bolted on this  side. It usually is, but that room being unused, it was forgotten. I  remembered it, and having risen early, crept up to make sure that you  did not come upon this ugly thing unexpectedly. But I was too late, it  seems; you have suffered, to my sorrow."    
"Dear Nell, and that was why I found you so pale and cold and quiet,  sitting by me when I woke, guarding me faithfully as you promised you  would. How brave and kind you were!"    
"Villain! I should much like to fire your own pistols at you for this  prank of yours."    
And Casimer laughingly filliped the image on its absurdly aquiline  nose.    
"What in the name of common sense is this goblin here for?" demanded  the major, testily.    
"There is a legend that once the owner of the chateau amused himself  by decoying travellers here, putting them to sleep in that room, and  by various devices alluring them thither. Here, one step beyond the  threshold of the door, was a trap, down which the unfortunates were  precipitated to the dungeon at the bottom of the tower, there to die  and be cast into the lake through a water-gate, still to be seen.  Severin keeps this flattering likeness of the rascal, as he does  the monk above, to amuse visitors by daylight, not at night,  mademoiselle."    
And Hoffman looked wrathfully at the image, as if he would much enjoy  sending it down the trap.    
"How ridiculous! I shall not go about this place alone, for fear of  lighting upon some horror of this sort. I've had enough; come away  into the garden; it's full of roses, and we may have as many as we  like."    
As she spoke Amy involuntarily put out her hand for Casimer to lead  her down the steep stone steps, and he pressed the little hand with a  tender look which caused it to be hastily withdrawn.    
"Here are your roses. Pretty flower; I know its meaning in English,  for it is the same with us. To give a bud to a lady is to confess  the beginning of love, a half open one tells of its growth, and a  full-blown one is to declare one's passion. Do you have that custom in  your land, mademoiselle?"    
He had gathered the three as he spoke, and held the bud separately  while looking at his companion wistfully.    
"No, we are not poetical, like your people, but it is a pretty fancy,"  and Amy settled her bouquet with an absorbed expression, though  inwardly wondering what he would do with his flowers.    
He stood silent a moment, with a sudden flush sweeping across his  face, then flung all three into the lake with a gesture that made the  girl start, and muttered between his teeth:    
"No, no; for me it is too late."    
She affected not to hear, but making up a second bouquet, she gave  it to him, with no touch of coquetry in compassionate eyes or gentle  voice.    
"Make your room bright with these. When one is ill nothing is so  cheering as the sight of flowers."    
Meantime the others had descended and gone their separate ways.    
As Karl crossed the courtyard a little child ran to meet him with  outstretched arms and a shout of satisfaction. He caught it up and  carried it away on his shoulder, like one used to caress and be  caressed by children.    
Helen, waiting at the door of the tower while the major dusted his  coat, saw this, and said, suddenly, directing his attention to man and  child,--    
"He seems fond of little people. I wonder if he has any of his own."    
"Hoffman? No, my dear; he's not married; I asked him that when I  engaged him."    
"And he said he was not?"    
"Yes; he's not more than five or six-and-twenty, and fond of a  wandering life, so what should he want of a wife and a flock of  bantlings?"    
"He seems sad and sober sometimes, and I fancied he might have some  domestic trouble to harass him. Don't you think there is something  peculiar about him?" asked Helen, remembering Hoffman's hint that her  uncle knew his wish to travel incognito, and wondering if he would  throw any light upon the matter. But the major's face was impenetrable  and his answer unsatisfactory.    
"Well, I don't know. Every one has some worry or other, and as for  being peculiar, all foreigners seem more or less so to us, they are so  unreserved and demonstrative. I like Hoffman more and more every day,  and shall be sorry when I part with him."    
"Ludmilla is his sister, then, or he didn't tell uncle the truth. It  is no concern of mine; but I wish I knew," thought Helen anxiously,  and then wondered why she should care.    
A feeling of distrust had taken possession of her and she determined  to be on the watch, for the unsuspicious major would be easily duped,  and Helen trusted more to her own quick and keen eye than to his  experience. She tried to show nothing of the change in her manner: but  Hoffman perceived it, and bore it with a proud patience which often  touched her heart, but never altered her purpose.
