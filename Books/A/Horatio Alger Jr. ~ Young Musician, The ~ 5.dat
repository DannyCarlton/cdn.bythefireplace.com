    Squire Pope was not a bad man, nor was he by nature a tyrant, but  he  was so fully convinced of his own superior judgment that he was in   all things obstinately bent on having his own way. He had persuaded   himself that our young hero, Philip, would be better off in the   poorhouse than in a place where he could earn his own living, and no   one could convince him to the contrary. 
  As to the boy's feelings on the subject, he considered those of no   importance. He had good reason to know that Philip would object to   being an inmate of the almshouse, but he was determined that he   should go there. 
  In like manner, before the auction was over, he saw clearly that it   would realize a sum more than sufficient to pay the funeral expenses   of the late Mr. Gray and the few small bills outstanding against his   estate, and that there was no necessity that Philip's violin should   be sold, but none the less he resolved that it should be sold. 
  &quot;Shall I allow a young lad to dictate to me?&quot; Squire Pope asked   himself, in irritation. &quot;Certainly not! I know better what is right   than he. It is ridiculous that a town pauper should own a violin.   Why, the next thing, we shall have to buy pianos for our almshouses,   for the use of the gentlemen and ladies who occupy them. A violin,   indeed!&quot; 
  This Squire Pope regarded as irresistible logic and withering   sarcasm combined. 
  He saw Philip go out of the cottage, but, as the sale was not over,   he was unable to follow him. 
  &quot;Never mind, I'll fix him as soon as I have time,&quot; he said to   himself. 
  &quot;Back so soon? Is the auction over!&quot; asked his friend, Frank  Dunbar,  who was engaged in splitting wood in the rear of the house. 
  &quot;No, Frank, not quite; but it's almost over..Who do you think bid  on  father's gold watch?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know.&quot; 
  &quot;Nick Holden.&quot; 
  &quot;He didn't get it, did he?&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad to say not. Your father bought it.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he! Why, he's got one watch already.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad he's got it. I couldn't bear to think of Nick Holden   carrying my father's watch. He was disappointed about one thing   besides.&quot; 
  &quot;What was that?&quot; 
  &quot;The violin. He went to Squire Pope, and complained that it was not   in the sale.&quot; 
  &quot;That's just like his impudence. What did the squire say?&quot; 
  &quot;He came to me and ordered me to get it, so that it might be sold.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall I get it for you, then?&quot; 
  &quot;Not much!&quot; answered Philip emphatically. &quot;It is mine, as I have   already told you. If the auction doesn't bring in enough to settle  up  everything, I may agree to sell it for a fair price; but I am  sure,  from the prices, that it won't be necessary.&quot; 
  &quot;Squire Pope's a dreadful obstinate man,&quot; said Frank doubtfully.  &quot;He  may insist upon your selling the violin.&quot; 
  &quot;Let him do it!&quot; said Philip contemptuously. &quot;I should like to see   him get it. Where have you put it, Frank?&quot; 
  &quot;Where Squire Pope won't be apt to find it&#8212;in an old chest up in   the garret. It's full of old clothes, belonging to my grandfather,   and hasn't been looked into by any one except me for years. I put it   away under all the clothes at the bottom. No one knows where it is   except you and me, not even mother.&quot; 
  &quot;That's good. I guess we can defy the squire, then.&quot; 
  Half an hour later, Mr. Dunbar came home from the auction. 
  Philip went to meet him. 
  &quot;Thank you for buying father's watch,&quot; he said. &quot;But for you, Nick   Holden would have had it, and I should have been sorry for it.&quot; 
  &quot;He was badly disappointed,&quot; said Mr. Dunbar smiling. &quot;But I didn't   buy the watch for myself, Philip.&quot; 
  &quot;For whom, then?&quot; asked Philip, in some surprise. 
  &quot;For the one that has the best right to it&#8212;for you,&quot; and the  farmer  took the watch from his pocket, and handed it to Philip. 
  &quot;But I haven't the money to pay for it, Mr. Dunbar,&quot; said our hero. 
  &quot;Then I give it to you as a present,&quot; said Mr. Dunbar. 
  &quot;I am very grateful,&quot; said Philip; &quot;but I ought not to accept it.   You are too kind to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Let me be the judge of that.&quot; 
  &quot;Besides, it wouldn't be safe for me to take it. Squire Pope will   try to get my violin away from me in order to sell it, and he would   be sure to try to do the same by the watch if he found that I had   it.&quot; 
  &quot;But, Philip, I don't need the watch myself.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, Mr. Dunbar, will you be kind enough to keep it for me, and   when I can afford to pay for it, and there is no danger of its being   taken from me, I will ask you for it. I shall be very glad, indeed,   when I am older, to carry my father's watch, for I have seen it in   his hands so often that it will constantly remind me of him.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps that will be the best arrangement,&quot; said Mr. Dunbar. &quot;You   might have it stolen from you, if you carried it yourself just at   present. As you request, I will keep it, subject to your order; but  I  would rather let it be a gift from me, and not require you to pay  for  it.&quot; 
  &quot;We won't talk about that now,&quot; said Philip, smiling. &quot;At any rate,   you must let me thank you for your great kindness to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't speak of that, Phil,&quot; said the farmer kindly. &quot;I had a great   respect and liking for your father, and I verily believe my Frank   loves you as well as if you were his own brother. So, come what may,   you have a friend in our family.&quot; 
  &quot;I indorse all that father says,&quot; Frank said. 
  And he extended his hand to Philip, who grasped it heartily. 
  It warmed his heart to think that he had such good friends, though   he was an orphan and alone in the world. 
  After supper, Mr. Dunbar went to the village store, while Frank and   Philip remained at home. 
  Suddenly Frank said: 
  &quot;Philip, you are going to have a visitor, I guess.&quot; 
  &quot;A visitor!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I saw Squire Pope stumping along the road, nourishing his   gold-headed cane. He is headed this way, and it's likely he is going   to honor you with a call. He's got somebody with him, too. Who is   it!&quot; 
  Philip shaded his eyes with his hand, for the Sun was near its   setting, and shining with dazzling brightness from the quarter  toward  which he was looking. 
  &quot;It's Nick Holden!&quot; he said. 
  &quot;So it is! What can he want?&quot; 
  &quot;I understand very well. He wants my violin. He couldn't get it at   the sale, so he has come here to see if he can't make me give it to   him.&quot; 
  &quot;And will you?&quot; 
  &quot;You ought to know me better than to ask, Frank,&quot; said Philip   firmly. &quot;Nick might as well have stayed away, for he won't  accomplish  anything.&quot; 
  Nick, however, held a different opinion. After Philip left the   cottage, he had gone to Squire Pope, and cunningly asked: 
  &quot;Are you going to let Philip keep his fiddle in spite of you,   squire?&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean, Nicholas?&quot; demanded the squire, in a stately  way. 
  &quot;Why, seems to me he's kinder settin' up his will agin yours. You   say the fiddle shall be sold, and he says it shan't. He told me he   didn't care what you said, he should keep it.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he say that, Nicholas?&quot; asked the squire, who felt that his   dignity was outraged by such insolence. 
  &quot;I'm sartain he did. He's pretty big feelin', Phil is. He always   wants to have his own way.&quot; 
  &quot;He will find that he can't defy me with impunity,&quot; said the squire   stiffly. 
  &quot;Just so. Then you'll sell me the fiddle?&quot; 
  &quot;I will!&quot; said the squire emphatically. 
  &quot;You won't ask too much, will you?&quot; asked Nick anxiously. 
  Now Squire Pope, who knew nothing of the price of violins, and had  a  very inadequate idea of their value, after some haggling on the part   of Nick, agreed to sell him the instrument for two dollars and a   half, and to see that it was delivered that evening. 
  &quot;Do you know where it is, Nicholas?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Why, Phil is staying over at Frank Dunbar's, and I guess he's got   it there somewhere. I guess we'd better go over there and get it.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well, Nicholas. After supper, if you will come to my house, I   will go over there, and see that you have the instrument.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, squire!&quot; said Nick gleefully, &quot;Phil will find that he   can't have his own way this time.&quot; 
  &quot;I apprehend he will,&quot; said the squire complacently. 
  Now the reader understands how it happened that Squire Pope and  Nick  Holden made a call on Philip. As to what passed at the interview,  we  must refer him to the next chapter.
