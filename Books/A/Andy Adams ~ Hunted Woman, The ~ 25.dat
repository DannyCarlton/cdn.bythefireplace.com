  Donald MacDonald's startling assertion that Mortimer FitzHugh had  been in the camp, and that Joanne's dream was not a dream, but reality,  brought a gasp of astonishment and disbelief from Aldous. Before he had  recovered sufficiently from his amazement to speak, MacDonald was  answering the question in his mind.
  &#8220;I woke quicker'n you, Johnny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She was just coming out of  the tepee, an' I heard something running off through the brush. I  thought mebby it was a wolverine, or a bear, an' I didn't move until  she cried out your name an' you jumped up. If she had seen a bear in  the fire-glow she wouldn't have thought it was Mortimer FitzHugh, would  she? It's possible, but it ain't likely, though I do say it's mighty  queer why he should be in this camp alone. It's up to us to watch  pretty close until daylight.&#8221;
  &#8220;He wouldn't be here alone,&#8221; asserted Aldous. &#8220;Let's get out of the  light, Mac. If you're right, the whole gang isn't far away!&#8221;
  &#8220;They ain't in rifle-shot,&#8221; said MacDonald. &#8220;I heard him running a  hundred yards out there. That's the queer thing about it! Why didn't  they jump on us when they had the chance?&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll hope that it was a dream,&#8221; replied Aldous. &#8220;If Joanne was  dreaming of FitzHugh, and while still half asleep saw something in  camp, she might easily imagine the rest. But we'll keep watch. Shall I  move out there?&#8221;
  MacDonald nodded, and the two men separated. For two hours they  patrolled the darkness, waiting and listening. With dawn Aldous  returned to camp to arouse Joanne and begin breakfast. He was anxious  to see what effect the incident of the night had on her. Her appearance  reassured him. When he referred to the dream, and the manner in which  she had come out into the night, a lovely confusion sent the blushes  into her face. He kissed her until they grew deeper, and she hid her  face on his neck.
  And then she whispered something, with her face still against his  shoulder, that drove the hot blood into his own cheeks.
  &#8220;You are my husband, John, and I don't suppose I should be ashamed  to let you see me in my bare feet. But, John&#8212;you have made me feel  that way, and I am&#8212;your wife!&#8221;
  He held her head close against him so that she could not see his  face.
  &#8220;I wanted to show you&#8212;that I loved you&#8212;'that much,&#8221; he said,  scarcely knowing what words he was speaking. &#8220;Joanne, my darling&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  A soft hand closed his lips.
  &#8220;I know, John,&#8221; she interrupted him softly. &#8220;And I love you so for  it, and I'm so proud of you&#8212;oh, so proud, John!&#8221;
  He was glad that MacDonald came crashing through the bush then.  Joanne slipped from his arms and ran into the tepee.
  In MacDonald's face was a grim and sullen look.
  &#8220;You missed your chance, all right, Johnny,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;I found  where a horse was tied out there. The tracks lead to a big slide of  rock that opens a break in the west range. Whoever it was has beat it  back into the other valley. I can't understand, s'elp me God, I can't,  Johnny! Why should FitzHugh come over into this valley alone? And he<I>  rode</I> over! I'd say the devil couldn't do that!&#8221;
  He said nothing more, but went out to lead in the hobbled horses,  leaving Aldous in half-stunned wonderment to finish the preparation of  breakfast. Joanne reappeared a little later, and helped him. It was six  o'clock before breakfast was over and they were ready to begin their  day's journey. As they were throwing the hitch over the last pack,  MacDonald said in a low voice to Aldous:
  &#8220;Everything may happen to-day, Johnny. I figger we'll reach the end  by sundown. An' what don't happen there may happen along the trail.  Keep a rifle-shot behind with Joanne. If there's unexpected shooting,  we want what you might call a reserve force in the rear. I figger I can  see danger, if there is any, an' I can do it best alone.&#8221;
  Aldous knew that in these last hours Donald MacDonald's judgment  must be final, and he made no objection to an arrangement which seemed  to place the old hunter under a more hazardous risk than his own. And  he realized fully that these were the last hours. For the first time he  had seen MacDonald fill his pockets with the finger-long cartridges for  his rifle, and he had noted how carefully he had looked at the breech  of that rifle. Without questioning, he had followed the mountaineer's  example. There were fifty spare cartridges in his own pockets. His .303  was freshly cleaned and oiled. He had tested the mechanism of his  automatic. MacDonald had watched him, and both understood what such  preparations meant as they set out on this last day's journey into the  North. They had not kept from Joanne the fact that they would reach the  end before night, and as they rode the prescribed distance behind the  old hunter Aldous wondered how much she guessed, and what she knew.  They had given her to understand that they were beating out the rival  party, but he believed that in spite of all their efforts there was in  Joanne's mind a comprehension which she did not reveal in voice or  look. To-day she was no different than yesterday, or the day before,  except that her cheeks were not so deeply flushed, and there was an  uneasy questing in her eyes. He believed that she sensed the nearness  of tragedy, that she was conscious of what they were now trying to hide  from her, and that she did not speak because she knew that he and  MacDonald did not want her to know. His heart throbbed with pride. Her  courage inspired him. And he noticed that she rode closer to  him&#8212;always at his side through that day.
  Early in the afternoon MacDonald stopped on the crest of a swell in  the valley and waited for them. When they came up he was facing the  north. He did not look at them. For a few moments he did not speak. His  hat was pulled low, and his beard was twitching.
  They looked ahead. At their feet the valley broadened until it was a  mile in width. Half a mile away a band of caribou were running for the  cover of a parklike clump of timber. MacDonald did not seem to notice  them. He was still looking steadily, and he was gazing at a mountain.  It was a tremendous mountain, a terrible-looking, ugly mountain,  perhaps three miles away. Aldous had never seen another like it. Its  two huge shoulders were of almost ebon blackness, and glistened in the  sunlight as if smeared with oil. Between those two shoulders rose a  cathedral-like spire of rock and snow that seemed to tip the white  fleece of the clouds.
  MacDonald did not turn when he spoke. His voice was deep and vibrant  with an intense emotion. Yet he was not excited.
  &#8220;I've been hunting for that mount'in for forty years, Johnny!&#8221;
  &#8220;Mac!&#8221;
  Aldous leaned over and laid a hand on the old mountaineer's  shoulder. Still MacDonald did not look at him.
  &#8220;Forty years,&#8221; he repeated, as if speaking to himself. &#8220;I see how I  missed it now, just as DeBar said. I hunted from the west, an' on that  side the mount'in ain't black. We must have crossed this valley an'  come in from the east forty years ago, Johnny&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He turned now, and what Joanne and Aldous saw in his face was not  grief; it was not the sorrow of one drawing near to his beloved dead,  but a joy that had transfigured him. The fire and strength of the youth  in which he had first looked upon this valley with Jane at his side  burned again in the sunken eyes of Donald MacDonald. After forty years  he had come into his own. Somewhere very near was the cavern with the  soft white floor of sand, and for a moment Aldous fancied that he could  hear the beating of MacDonald's heart, while from Joanne's tender bosom  there rose a deep, sobbing breath of understanding.
  And MacDonald, facing the mountain again, pointed with a long, gaunt  arm, and said:
  &#8220;We're almost there, Johnny. God ha' mercy on them if they've beat  us out!&#8221;
