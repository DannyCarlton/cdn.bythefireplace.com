  After his collision with the traveler, Herbert hurried on to the  mill,  intent upon making up for lost time. He was satisfied with  having  successfully maintained his rights; and, as he had no reason to  suppose  he should ever again see his unreasonable opponent, dismissed  him from  his thoughts. 
  On reaching the mill, he found he should have to remain an hour or  two  before he could have his grain ground. He was not sorry for this,  as it  would give him an opportunity to walk around the village. 
  &quot;I wish,&quot; he thought, &quot;I could get a place in one of the stores  here.  There's more going on than there is in Waverley, and I could go  over  Sundays to see Dr. Kent's family.&quot; 
  On the spur of the moment, he resolved to inquire if some of the   storekeepers did not require help. There was a large dry-goods store&#8212;   the largest in the village&#8212;kept by Beckford Keyes. He entered and   inquired for the senior partner. 
  &quot;Mr. Beckford is not in,&quot; said the clerk. &quot;Mr. Keyes is standing at  that  desk.&quot; 
  Herbert went up to the desk, and said inquiringly, &quot;Mr. Keyes?&quot; 
  &quot;That is my name,&quot; said that gentleman, pleasantly. &quot;Is there  anything I  can do for you?&quot; 
  &quot;I am in search of a place,&quot; said our hero, &quot;and I thought you  might  have a vacancy here.&quot; 
  &quot;We have none just at present,&quot; said Mr. Keyes, who was favorably   impressed by Herbert's appearance; &quot;but it is possible we may have in  a  few weeks. Where do you live? Not in the village, I suppose?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; said Herbert, and a shadow passed over his face, &quot;My  mother  died three weeks since, and I am now stopping at the house of  Dr. Kent.&quot; 
  &quot;Dr. Kent&#8212;ah, yes, I know the doctor. He is an excellent man.&quot; 
  &quot;He is,&quot; said Herbert, warmly. &quot;He has been very kind to me.&quot; 
  &quot;What is your name?&quot; 
  &quot;Herbert Mason.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, Herbert, I will promise to bear you in mind. I will note  down  your name and address, and as soon as we have a vacancy I will  write to  you. Come into the store whenever you come this way.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Herbert. 
  He left the store feeling quite encouraged. Even if the chance  never  amounted to anything, the kind words and manner of the  storekeeper gave  him courage to hope that he would meet with equal  kindness from others.  Kind words cost nothing, but they have a  marvelous power in lightening  the burdens of the sorrowful and  cheering the desponding. 
  Herbert left the store, feeling that he should consider himself  truly  fortunate if he could obtain a place in such an establishment.  But there  was a rough experience before him, of which at present he  guessed  nothing. 
  After sauntering about the village a little longer, and buying a  stick  of candy for little Mary Kent, the doctor's only daughter, who  was quite  attached to Herbert, our hero got back to the mill in time  to receive  his bags of meal, with which he was soon on his way  homeward. 
  About the place where he met Mr. Holden he was hailed by a man at  work  in the field&#8212;the same who had taken back that gentleman's horse  to the  stable. 
  &quot;Well, boy, you had a kind of scrimmage, didn't you, coming over?&quot; 
  &quot;Did you see it?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the other, grinning. &quot;I seed the other feller in the  mud  puddle. He was considerably riled about it.&quot; 
  &quot;It was his own fault. I gave him half the road.&quot; 
  &quot;I know it; but there's some folks that want more than their  share.&quot; 
  &quot;Was his buggy broken? I don't know but I ought to have stopped to  help  him, but he had been so unreasonable that I didn't feel much like  it.&quot; 
  &quot;His wheel got broken. I drawed the buggy into the bushes. There  'tis  now. It'll cost him a matter of ten dollars to fix it.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm sorry for that,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;but I can't see that I was to  blame  in the matter. If I had turned out as he wanted me to, I should  have  tipped over, and, as the wagon didn't belong to me, I didn't  think it  right to risk it.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course not. You wasn't called on to give in to such   unreasonableness.&quot; 
  &quot;Where did the man go?&quot; 
  &quot;He concluded to walk on to Waverley, and hired me to take the  horse  back to the stable. He wanted to know who you were.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he?&quot; 
  &quot;Maybe he's goin' to sue you for damages.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe he'll get much if he does,&quot; laughed our hero. &quot;My   property is where he can't get hold of it.&quot; 
  &quot;Ho! ho!&quot; laughed the other, understanding the joke. 
  After this conversation Herbert continued on his way, and, after   delivering the grain, took his way across the fields to his temporary   home. He entered by the back yard. Little Mary came running out to  meet  him. 
  &quot;Have oo come back, Herbert?&quot; she said. &quot;Where have oo been?&quot; 
  &quot;Been to buy Mary some candy,&quot; he said, lifting her up and kissing  her. 
  &quot;Whose horse is that at the gate?&quot; asked Herbert, as the doctor's  wife  entered the room. 
  &quot;It belongs to Captain Ross,&quot; she said. &quot;He has come on business   connected with you.&quot; 
  &quot;Connected with me!&quot; repeated Herbert, in surprise. 
  &quot;Yes, my dear boy, I am afraid we must make up our minds to lose  you.&quot; 
  &quot;Has he found a place for me?&quot; asked Herbert, in a tone of   disappointment. 
  &quot;Yes, I believe he has bound you out to a man in Cranston.&quot; 
  &quot;I am sorry,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;I shall be sorry to have you go, Herbert, but I thought you wanted  to  go.&quot; 
  &quot;So I do; but by waiting a few weeks I could probably get a place  in  Beckford Keyes' store, at the mill village.&quot; 
  &quot;What makes you think so?&quot; 
  Herbert detailed his interview of the morning with the junior  partner.  Just at this moment the doctor entered the kitchen. 
  &quot;Have you told him?&quot; he inquired, looking at his wife. 
  &quot;Yes, and he says that but for this he might probably have got a  chance  to go into Beckford's store at the mill village.&quot; 
  &quot;I am sorry for this. They are good men, and he would have been  near us,  while Cranston is forty miles away.&quot; 
  &quot;Who is the man that wants me?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  &quot;A Mr. Holden. He is in the other room with Captain Ross. It was  all  arranged before they came. He wants you to go with him to-morrow   morning.&quot; 
  &quot;So soon?&quot; said Herbert, in dismay. 
  &quot;Yes. At first he wished you to set off with him this afternoon;  but I  told him decidedly you could not be ready.&quot; 
  &quot;Quite impossible,&quot; said Mrs. Kent. &quot;Some of Herbert's clothes are  in  the wash, and I can't have them ready till evening.&quot; 
  &quot;You had better come into the other room, Herbert,&quot; said the  doctor. &quot;I  will introduce you to your new employer.&quot; 
  Herbert followed the doctor into the sitting-room. His first glance   rested on Captain Ross, whom he knew. He went up and shook hands with   him. Next he turned to Mr. Holden, and to his inexpressible   astonishment, recognized his opponent of the morning. 
  &quot;Mr. Holden, Herbert,&quot; introduced the doctor. &quot;Mr. Holden, this is  the  boy we have been speaking of.&quot; 
  &quot;I have seen Mr. Holden before,&quot; said Herbert, coldly. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Holden, writhing his disagreeable features into an   unpleasant smile. &quot;We have met before.&quot; 
  Dr. Kent looked from one to the other in surprise, as if seeking an   explanation. 
  &quot;Our acquaintance doesn't date very far back,&quot; said Mr. Holden. &quot;We  met  this morning between here and the mill village.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed,&quot; said the doctor; &quot;you passed each other, I suppose.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, no; I can't say we did exactly,&quot; said Mr. Holden, with the  same  unpleasant smile, &quot;We tried to, but the road being narrow, there  was a  collision, and I came off second-best.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope there was no accident.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, nothing to speak of. I got tipped out, and my clothes, as you  may  observe, suffered some. As for my young friend here, he rode on   uninjured.&quot; 
  &quot;You must excuse my not stopping to inquire if I could help you,&quot;  said  Herbert; &quot;but my horse was frightened by the collision, and I  could not  easily stop him.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, it's of no consequence,&quot; said Mr. Holden, in an off-hand  manner. He  was determined not to show himself out in his true colors  until he had  got Herbert absolutely under his control. 
  &quot;But where is your horse, Mr. Holden?&quot; asked Captain Ross. &quot;I think  you  were walking when you came to my house.&quot; 
  &quot;I sent it back to the village by a man I met on the road, my buggy   being disabled.&quot; 
  &quot;Your carriage wasn't much injured, I hope.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, no, not much.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see exactly how it could happen,&quot; said Captain Ross. &quot;I  thought  the road from here to the mill village was broad enough at any  point for  carriages to pass each other.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't dream,&quot; said Mr. Holden, not noticing this remark, &quot;that  the  young man I had engaged was my young acquaintance of the morning.&quot; 
  Herbert looked at him, puzzled by his entire change of manner&#8212;a  change  so sudden that he suspected its genuineness. 
  The more he thought of it, the more unwilling he felt to live with  Mr.  Holden. But could it be avoided? He resolved to try. He  accordingly told  the doctor and Captain Ross of the promise that Mr.  Keyes had made him. 
  &quot;It would be a good place,&quot; said the captain; &quot;but it ain't  certain.  Now, here's Mr. Holden, ready to take you at once.&quot; 
  &quot;If I was in the mill village I could come over and see my friends  here  now and then. Besides, I think I should like being in a store.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, I've got a store, too,&quot; said Mr. Holden, &quot;and I should expect  you  to tend there part of the time. I don't think I can let you off,  my  young friend,&quot; he added, with a disagreeable smile. &quot;I think we  shall  get along very well together.&quot; 
  Herbert did not feel at all sure of this, but he saw that it would  do no  good to remonstrate farther, and kept silence. Soon after, Mr.  Holden  and Captain Ross rose to go. 
  &quot;I'll call round for my young friend about nine to-morrow morning,&quot;  said  Abner Holden, with an ingratiating smile. 
  &quot;We will endeavor to have him ready,&quot; said the doctor. 
  After they went away Herbert wandered about in not the best of  spirits.  He was convinced that he should not be happy with Mr. Holden,  against  whom he had conceived an aversion, founded partly upon the  occurrences  of the morning, and partly on the disagreeable impression  made upon him  by Abner Holden's personal appearance.
