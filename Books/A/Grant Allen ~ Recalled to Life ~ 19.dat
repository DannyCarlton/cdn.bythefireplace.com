For some seconds I sat there, leaning back in my chair and gazing  close at that incredible, that accusing document. I knew it couldn't  lie: I knew it must be the very handiwork of unerring Nature. Then  slowly a recollection began to grow up in my mind. I knew of my own  memory it was really true. I remembered it so, now, as in a glass,  darkly. I remembered having stood, with the pistol in my hand,  pointing it straight at the breast of the man with the long white  beard whom they called my father. A new mental picture rose up  before me like a vision. I remembered it all as something that once  really occurred to me.    
Yet I remembered it, as I had long remembered the next scene in the  series, merely as so much isolated and unrelated fact, without  connection of any sort to link it to the events that preceded or  followed it. It was <i>I</i> who shot my father! I realised that now with  a horrid gulp. But what on earth did I ever shoot him for?    
And I had hunted down Jack for the crime I had committed myself! I  had threatened to give him up for my own dreadful parricide!    
After a minute, I rose, and staggered feebly to the door. I saw the  path of duty clear as daylight before me.    
"Where are you going?" Jack faltered out, watching me close with  anxious eyes, lest I should stumble or faint.    
And I answered aloud, in a hollow voice:    
"To the police-station, of course,--to give myself into custody for  the murder of my father."    
When I thought it was Jack, though I loved him better than I loved  my own life, I would have given him up to justice as a sacred duty.  Now I knew it was myself, how could I possibly do otherwise? How  could I love my own life better than I loved dear Jack's, who had  given up everything to save me and protect me?    
With a wild bound of horror, Jack sprang upon me at once. He seized  me bodily in his arms. He carried me back into the room with  irresistible strength. I fought against him in vain. He laid me on  the sofa. He bent over me like a whirlwind and smothered me with hot  kisses.    
"My darling," he cried, "my darling, then this shock hasn't killed  you! It hasn't stunned you like the last! You're still your own dear  self! You've still strength to think and plan exactly what one would  expect from you. Oh! Una, my Una, you must wait and hear all. When  you've learned <i>how</i> it happened, you won't wish to act so rashly."    
I struggled to free myself, though his arms were hard and close like  a strong man's around me.    
"Let me go, Jack!" I cried feebly, trying to tear myself from his  grasp. "I love you better than I love my own life. If I would have  given <i>you</i> up, how much more must I give up myself, now I know it was  I who really did it!"    
He held me down by main force. He pinned me to the sofa. I suppose  it's because I'm a woman, and weak, and all that--but I liked even  then to feel how strong and how big he was, and how feeble I was  myself, like a child in his arms. And I resisted on purpose, just to  feel him hold me. Somehow, I couldn't realize, after all, that I was  indeed a murderess. It didn't seem possible. I couldn't believe it  was in me.    
"Jack," I said slowly, giving way at last, and letting him hold me  down with his small strong hands and slender iron wrist, "tell me,  if you will, how I came to do it. I'll sit here quite still, if only  you'll tell me. Am I really a murderess?"    
Jack recoiled like one shot.    
"<i>You</i> a murderess, my spotless Una!" he exclaimed, all aghast. "If  anyone else on earth but you had just asked such a thing in my  presence, I'd have leapt at the fellow's throat, and held him down  till I choked him!"    
"But I did it!" I cried wildly. "I remember now, I did it. It all  comes back to me at last. I fired at him, just so. I aimed the  loaded pistol point-blank at his heart, I can hear the din in my  ears. I can see the flash at the muzzle. And then I flung down the  pistol--like this--at my feet: and darkness came on; and I forgot  everything. Why, Dr. Marten knew that much! I remember now, he told  me he'd formed a very strong impression, from the nature of the  wound and the position of the various objects on the floor of the  room, who it was that did it! He must have seen it was <i>I</i> who flung  down the pistol."    
Jack gazed at me in suspense.    
"He's a very good friend of yours, then," he murmured, "that Dr.  Marten. For he never said a word of all that at the inquest."    
"But I must give myself up!" I cried, in a fever of penitence for  what that other woman who once was <i>me</i> had done. "Oh, Jack, do let  me! It's hateful to know I'm a murderess and to go unpunished. It's  hateful to draw back from the fate I'd have imposed on another. I'd  like to be hanged for it. I want to be hanged. It's the only  possible way to appease one's conscience."    
And yet, though I said it, I felt all the time it wasn't really I,  but that other strange girl who once lived at The Grange and looked  exactly like me. I remember it, to be sure; but it was in my Other  State: and, so far as my moral responsibility was concerned, my  Other State and I were two different people.    
For I knew in my heart I couldn't commit a murder.    
Jack rose without a word, and fetched me in some brandy.    
"Drink this," he said calmly, in his authoritative medical tone;  "drink this before you say another sentence."    
And, obedient to his order, I took it up and drank it.    
Then he sat down beside me, and took my hand in his, and with very  gentle words began to reason and argue with me.    
He was glad I'd struggled, he said, because that broke the first  force of the terrible shock for me. Action was always good for one  in any great crisis. It gave an outlet for the pent-up emotions, too  suddenly let loose with explosive force, and kept them from turning  inward and doing serious harm, as mine had done on that horrible  night of the accident. He called it always the accident, I noticed,  and never the murder. That gave me fresh hope. Could I really after  all have fired unintentionally? But no; when I came to look  inward,--to look backward on my past state,--I was conscious all the  time of some strong and fierce resentment smouldering deep in my  heart at the exact moment of firing. However it might have happened,  I was angry with the man with the long white beard: I fired at him  hastily, it is true, but with malice prepense and deliberate intent  to wound and hurt him.    
Jack went on, however, undeterred, in a low and quiet voice,  soothing my hand with his as he spoke, and very kind and gentle. My  spirit rebelled at the thought that I could ever for one moment have  imagined him a murderer. I said so in one wild burst. Jack held my  hand, and still reasoned with me. I like a man's reasoning; it's so  calm and impartial. It seems to overcome one by its mere display of  strength. If I'd changed my mind once, Jack said, I might change it  again, when further evidence on the point was again forthcoming. I  mustn't give myself up to the police till I understood much more. If  I did, I would commit a very grave mistake. There were reasons that  had led to the firing of the shot. Very grave reasons too. Couldn't  I restore and reconstruct them, now I knew the last stage of the  terrible history? If possible, he'd rather I should arrive at them  by myself than that he should tell me.    
I cast my mind back all in vain.    
"No, Jack," I said trustfully. "I can't remember anything one bit  like that. I can remember forward, sometimes, but never backwards. I  can remember now how I flung down the pistol, and how the servants  burst in. But not a word, not an item, of what went before. That's  all a pure blank to me."    
And then I went on to tell him in very brief outline how the first  thing I could recollect in all my life was the Australian scene with  the big blue-gum-trees; and how that had been recalled to me by the  picture at Jane's; and how one scene in that way had gradually  suggested another; and how I could often think ahead from a given  fact but never go back behind it and discover what led up to it.    
Jack drew his hand over his chin and reflected silently.    
"That's odd," he said, after a pause. "Yet very comprehensible. I  might almost have thought of that before: might have arrived at it  on general principles. Psychologically and physiologically it's  exactly what one would have expected from the nature of memory. And  yet it never occurred to me. Set up the train of thought in the  order in which it originally presented itself, and the links may  readily restore themselves in successive series. Try to trace it  backward in the inverse order, and the process is very much more  difficult and involved.--Well, we'll try things just so with you,  Una. We'll begin by reconstructing your first life as far as we can  from the very outset, with the aid of these stray hints of yours;  and then we'll see whether we can get you to remember all your past  up to the day of the accident more easily."    
I gazed up at him with gratitude.    
"Oh, Jack," I said, trembling, "in spite of this shock, I believe I  can do it now. I believe I can remember. The scales are falling from  my eyes. I'm becoming myself again. What you've said and what you've  shown me seems to have broken down a veil. I feel as if I could  reconstruct all now, when once the key's suggested to me."    
He smiled at me encouragingly. Oh, how could I ever have doubted  him?    
"That's right, darling," he answered. "I should have expected as  much, indeed. For now for the very first time since the accident  you've got really at the other side of the great blank in your  memory."    
I felt so happy, though I knew I was a murderess. I didn't mind now  whether I was hanged or not. To love Jack and be loved by him was  quite enough for me. When he called me "darling," I was in the  seventh heavens. It sounded so familiar. I knew he must have called  me so, often and often before, in the dim dead past that was just  beginning to recur to me.
