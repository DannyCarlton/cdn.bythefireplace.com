  Not long after his election as a member of the Clionian Society, the  summer term of the Prescott Academy closed. The examination took place  about the tenth of June, and a vacation followed, lasting till the  first day of September. Of course, the Clionian Society, which was  composed of Academy students, suspended its meetings for the same  length of time. Indeed, the last meeting for the season took place  during the first week in June, as the evenings were too short and too  warm, and the weather was not favorable to oratory. At the last  meeting, an election was held of officers to serve for the following  term. The same President and Vice-President were chosen; but as the  Secretary declined to serve another term, Harry Walton, considerably to  his surprise, found himself elected in his place.
  Fitzgerald Fletcher did not vote for him. Indeed, he expressed it as  his opinion that it was a shame to elect a &#8220;printer's devil&#8221; Secretary  of the Society.
  &#8220;Why is it?&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;Printing is a department of literature,  and the Clionian is a literary society, isn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course it is a literary society, but a printer's devil is not  literary.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's as literary as a tin-pedler,&#8221; said Tom Carver, maliciously.
  Fletcher turned red, but managed to say, &#8220;And what does that prove?&#8221;
  &#8220;We don't object to you because you are connected with the tin  business.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean to insult me?&#8221; demanded Fletcher, angrily. &#8220;What have I  to do with the tin business?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, I beg pardon, it's your cousin that's in it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I deny the relationship,&#8221; said Fletcher, &#8220;and I will thank you not  to refer again to that vulgar pedler.&#8221;
  &#8220;Really, Fitz, you speak rather roughly, considering he's your  cousin. But as to Harry Walton, he's a fine fellow, and he has an  excellent handwriting, and I was very glad to vote for him.&#8221;
  Fitzgerald walked away, not a little disgusted, as well at the  allusion to the tin-pedler, as at the success of Harry Walton in  obtaining an office to which he had himself secretly aspired. He had  fancied that it would sound well to put &#8220;Secretary of the Clionian  Society&#8221; after his name, and would give him increased consequence at  home. As to the tin-pedler, it would have relieved his mind to hear  that Mr. Bickford had been carried off suddenly by an apoplectic fit,  and notwithstanding the tie of kindred, he would not have taken the  trouble to put on mourning in his honor.
  Harry Walton sat in Oscar Vincent's room, on the last evening of the  term. He had just finished reciting the last French lesson in which he  would have Oscar's assistance for some time to come.
  &#8220;You have made excellent progress,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;It is only two  months since you began French, and now you take a long lesson in  translation.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is because I have so good a teacher. But do you think I can  get along without help during the summer?&#8221;
  &#8220;No doubt of it. You may find some difficulties, but those you can  mark, and I will explain when I come back. Or I'll tell you what is  still better. Write to me, and I'll answer. Shall I write in French?&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you would, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will. I'm rather lazy with the pen, but I can find time for  you. Besides, it will be a good way for me to keep up my French.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shall you be in Boston all summer, Oscar?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; our family has a summer residence at Nahant, a sea-shore place  twelve miles from Boston. Then I hope father will let me travel about a  little on my own account. I want to go to Saratoga and Lake George.&#8221;
  &#8220;That would be splendid.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you could go with me, Harry.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar, but perhaps you can secure Fletcher's company.  That will be much better than that of a 'printer's devil' like myself.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may show bad taste, but I should prefer your company,  notwithstanding your low employment.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar. I am much obliged.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fitz has been hinting to me how nice it would be for us to go off  somewhere together, but I don't see it in that light. I asked him why  he didn't secure board with his cousin, the tin-pedler, but that made  him angry, and he walked away in disgust. But I can't help pitying you  a little, Harry.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why? On account of my occupation?&#8221;
  &#8220;Partly. All these warm summer days, you have got to be working at  the case, while I can lounge in the shade, or travel for pleasure.  Sha'n't you have a vacation?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't expect any. I don't think I could well be spared. However,  I don't mind it. I hope to do good deal of studying while you are  gone.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I sha'n't do any.&#8221;
  &#8220;Neither would I, perhaps, in your position. But there's a good deal  of difference between us. You are a Latin and Greek scholar, and can  talk French, while I am at the bottom of the ladder. I have no time to  lose.&#8221;
  &#8220;You have begun to mount the ladder, Harry. Don't be discouraged.  You can climb up.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I must work for it. I haven't got high enough up to stop and  rest. But there is one question I want to ask you, before you go.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;What French book would you recommend after I have finished this  Reader? I am nearly through now.&#8221;
  &#8220;Telemaque will be a good book to take next. It is easy and  interesting. Have you got a French dictionary?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; but I can buy one.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can use mine while I am gone. You may as well have it as not. I  have no copy of Telemaque, but I will send you one from Boston.&#8221;
  &#8220;Agreed, provided you will let me pay you for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I would, if I had to buy one. But I have got an old copy, not  very ornamental, but complete. I will send it through the mail.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar. How kind you are!&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't flatter me, Harry. The favors you refer to are but trifles. I  will ask a favor of you in return.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you would.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then help me pack my trunk. There's nothing I detest so much.  Generally I tumble things in helter-skelter, and get a good scolding  from mother for doing it, when she inspects my trunk.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll save you the trouble, then. Bring what you want to carry home,  and pile it on the floor, and I'll do the packing.&#8221;
  &#8220;A thousand thanks, as the French say. It takes a load off my mind.  By the way, here's a lot of my photographs. Would you like one to  remember your professor by?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very much, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then take your choice. They don't do justice to my beauty, which is  of a stunning description, as you are aware, nor do they convey an idea  of the lofty intellect which sits enthroned behind my classic brow; but  such as they are, you are welcome to one.&#8221;
  &#8220;Any one would think, to hear you, that you had no end of  self-conceit, Oscar,&#8221; said Harry, laughing.
  &#8220;How do you know that I haven't? Most people think they are  beautiful. A photographer told my sister that he was once visited by a  frightfully homely man from the the country, who wanted his 'picter  took.' When the result was placed before him, he seemed dissatisfied.  'Don't you think it like?' said the artist.&#8212;'Well, ye-es,' he answered  slowly, 'but it hasn't got my sweet expression about the mouth!'&#8220;
  &#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Harry, laughing; &#8220;that's what's the matter with  your picture.&#8221;
  &#8220;Precisely. I am glad your artistic eye detects what is wanting.  But, hold! there's a knock. It's Fitz, I'll bet a hat.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come in!&#8221; he cried, and Fletcher walked in.
  &#8220;Good-evening, Fletcher,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;You see I'm packing, or  rather Walton is packing. He's a capital packer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Indeed!&#8221; sneered Fletcher. &#8220;I was not aware that Mr. Walton was in  that line of business. What are his terms?&#8221;
  &#8220;I refer you to him.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you charge for packing trunks, Mr. Walton?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think fifty cents would be about right,&#8221; answered Harry, with  perfect gravity. &#8220;Can you give me a job, Mr. Fletcher?&#8221;
  &#8220;I might, if I had known it in time, though I am particular who  handles my things.&#8221;
  &#8220;Walton is careful, and I can vouch for his honesty,&#8221; said Oscar,  carrying out the joke. &#8220;His wages in the printing office are not large,  and he would be glad to make a little extra money.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must be very inconvenient to be poor,&#8221; said Fletcher, with a  supercilious glance at our hero, who was kneeling before Oscar's trunk.
  &#8220;It is,&#8221; answered Harry, quietly, &#8220;but as long as work is to be had  I shall not complain.&#8221;
  &#8220;To be sure!&#8221; said Fletcher. &#8220;My father is wealthy, and I shall not  have to work.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose he should fail?&#8221; suggested Oscar.
  &#8220;That is a very improbable supposition,&#8221; said Fletcher, loftily.
  &#8220;But not impossible?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing is impossible.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course. I say, Fitz, if such a thing should happen, you've got  something to fall back upon.&#8221;
  &#8220;To what do you refer?&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Bickford could give you an interest in the tin business.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good-evening!&#8221; said Fletcher, not relishing the allusion.
  &#8220;Good-evening! Of course I shall see you in the city.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose I ought not to tease Fitz,&#8221; said Oscar, after his visitor  had departed, &#8220;but I enjoy seeing how disgusted he looks.&#8221;
  In due time the trunk was packed, and Harry, not without regret,  took leave of his friend for the summer.
