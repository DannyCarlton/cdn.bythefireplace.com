  In that big, deep chair which must have been St. Pierre's own,   Marie-Anne sat facing Carrigan. Between its great arms her slim   little figure seemed diminutive and out of place. Her brown eyes  were  level and clear, waiting. They were not warm or nervous, but  so coolly  and calmly beautiful that they disturbed Carrigan. She  raised her  hands, her slim fingers crumpling for a moment in the  soft, thick  coils of her hair. That little movement, the  unconscious feminism of  it, the way she folded her hands in her  lap afterward, disturbed  Carrigan even more. What a glory on earth  it must be to possess a  woman like that! The thought made him  uneasy. And she sat waiting, a  vivid, softly-breathing question-  mark against the warm coloring of  the upholstered chair. 
  &quot;When you shot me,&quot; he began, &quot;I saw you, first, standing over me.   I thought you had come to finish me. It was then that I saw  something  in your face&#8212;horror, amazement, as though you had done  something you  did not know you were doing. You see, I want to be  charitable. I want  to understand. I want to excuse you if I can.  Won't you tell me why  you shot me, and why that change came over  you when you saw me lying  there?&quot; 
  &quot;No, M'sieu David, I shall not tell.&quot; She was not antagonistic or   defiant. Her voice was not raised, nor did it betray an unusual   emotion. It was simply decisive, and the unflinching steadiness of   her eyes and the way in which she sat with her hands folded gave  to  it an unqualified definiteness. 
  &quot;You mean that I must make my own guess?&quot; 
  She nodded. 
  &quot;Or get it out of St. Pierre?&quot; 
  &quot;If St. Pierre wishes to tell you, yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Well&#8212;&quot; He leaned a little toward her. &quot;After that you dragged me   up into the shade, dressed my wound and made me comfortable. In a   hazy sort of way I knew what was going on. And a curious thing   happened. At times&#8212;&quot; he leaned still a little nearer to her&#8212;&quot;at   times&#8212;there seemed to be two of you!&quot; 
  He was not looking at her hands, or he would have seen her fingers   slowly tighten in her lap. 
  &quot;You were badly hurt,&quot; she said. &quot;It is not strange that you   should have imagined things, M'sieu David.&quot; 
  &quot;And I seemed to hear two voices,&quot; he went on. 
  She made no answer, but continued to look at him steadily. 
  &quot;And the other had hair that was like copper and gold fire in the   sun. I would see your face and then hers, again and again&#8212;and&#8212;   since then&#8212;I have thought I was a heavy load for your hands to  drag  up through that sand to the shade alone.&quot; 
  She held up her two hands, looking at them. &quot;They are strong,&quot; she   said. 
  &quot;They are small,&quot; he insisted, &quot;and I doubt if they could drag me   across this floor.&quot; 
  For the first time the quiet of her eyes gave way to a warm fire.   &quot;It was hard work,&quot; she said, and the note in her voice gave him   warning that he was approaching the dead-line again. &quot;Bateese says  I  was a fool for doing it. And if you saw two of me, or three or  four,  it doesn't matter. Are you through questioning me, M'sieu  David? If  so, I have a number of things to do.&quot; 
  He made a gesture of despair. &quot;No, I am not through. But why ask   you questions if you won't answer them?&quot; 
  &quot;I simply can not. You must wait.&quot; 
  &quot;For your husband?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, for St. Pierre.&quot; 
  He was silent for a moment, then said, &quot;I raved about a number of   things when I was sick, didn't I?&quot; 
  &quot;You did, and especially about what you thought happened in the   sand. You called this&#8212;this other person&#8212;the Fire Goddess. You  were  so near dying that of course it wasn't amusing. Otherwise it  would  have been. You see MY hair is black, almost!&quot; Again, in a  quick  movement, her fingers were crumpling the lustrous coils on  the crown  of her head. 
  &quot;Why do you say 'almost'?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Because St. Pierre has often told me that when I am in the sun   there are red fires in it. And the sun was very bright that  afternoon  in the sand, M'sieu David.&quot; 
  &quot;I think I understand,&quot; he nodded. &quot;And I'm rather glad, too. I   like to know that it was you who dragged me up into the shade  after  trying to kill me. It proves you aren't quite so savage as&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Carmin Fanchet,&quot; she interrupted him softly. &quot;You talked about   her in your sickness, M'sieu David. It made me terribly afraid of   you&#8212;so much so that at times I almost wondered if Bateese wasn't   right. It made me understand what would happen to me if I should  let  you go. What terrible thing did she do to you? What could she  have  done more terrible than I have done?&quot; 
  &quot;Is that why you have given your men orders to kill me if I try to   escape?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because I talked about this woman, Carmin   Fanchet?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it is because of Carmin Fanchet that I am keeping you for   St. Pierre,&quot; she acknowledged. &quot;If you had no mercy for her, you   could have none for me. What terrible thing did she do to you,   M'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;Nothing&#8212;to me,&quot; he said, feeling that she was putting him where   the earth was unsteady under his feet again. &quot;But her brother was  a  criminal of the worst sort. And I was convinced then, and am  convinced  now, that his sister was a partner in his crimes. She  was very  beautiful. And that, I think, was what saved her.&quot; 
  He was fingering his unlighted cigar as he spoke. When he looked   up, he was surprised at the swift change that had come into the  face  of St. Pierre's wife. Her cheeks were flaming, and there were  burning  fires screened behind the long lashes of her eyes. But her  voice was  unchanged. It was without a quiver that betrayed the  emotion which had  sent the hot flush into her face. 
  &quot;Then&#8212;you judged her without absolute knowledge of fact? You   judged her&#8212;as you hinted in your fever&#8212;because she fought so   desperately to save a brother who had gone wrong?&quot; 
  &quot;I believe she was bad.&quot; 
  The long lashes fell lower, like fringes of velvet closing over   the fires in her eyes. &quot;But you didn't know!&quot; 
  &quot;Not absolutely,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But investigations&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Might have shown her to be one of the most wonderful women that   ever lived, M'sieu David. It is not hard to fight for a good   brother&#8212;but if he is bad, it may take an angel to do it!&quot; 
  He stared, thoughts tangling themselves in his head. A slow shame   crept over him. She had cornered him. She had convicted him of   unfairness to the one creature on earth his strength and his  manhood  were bound to protect&#8212;a woman. She had convicted him of  judging  without fact. And in his head a voice seemed to cry out to  him, &quot;What  did Carmin Fanchet ever do to you?&quot; 
  He rose suddenly to his feet and stood at the back of his chair,   his hands gripping the top of it. &quot;Maybe you are right,&quot; he said.   &quot;Maybe I was wrong. I remember now that when I got Fanchet I  manacled  him, and she sat beside him all through that first night.  I didn't  intend to sleep, but I was tired&#8212;and did. I must have  slept for an  hour, and SHE roused me&#8212;trying to get the key to the  handcuffs. She  had the opportunity then&#8212;to kill me.&quot; 
  Triumph swept over the face that was looking up at him. &quot;Yes, she   could have killed you&#8212;while you slept. But she didn't. WHY?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know. Perhaps she had the idea of getting the key and   letting her brother do the job. Two or three days later I am   convinced she would not have hesitated. I caught her twice trying  to  steal my gun. And a third time, late at night, when we were  within a  day or two of Athabasca Landing, she almost got me with a  club. So I  concede that she never did anything very terrible to  me. But I am sure  that she tried, especially toward the last.&quot; 
  &quot;And because she failed, she hated you; and because she hated you,   something was warped inside you, and you made up your mind she  should  be punished along with her brother. You didn't look at it  from a  woman's viewpoint. A woman will fight, and kill, to save  one she  loves. She tried, perhaps, and failed. The result was that  her brother  was killed by the Law. Was not that enough? Was it  fair or honest to  destroy her simply because you thought she might  be a partner in her  brother's crimes?&quot; 
  &quot;It is rather strange,&quot; he replied, a moment of indecision in his   voice. &quot;McVane, the superintendent, asked me that same question. I   thought he was touched by her beauty. And I'm sorry&#8212;very sorry&#8212;   that I talked about her when I was sick. I don't want you to think  I  am a bad sort&#8212;that way. I'm going to think about it. I'm going  over  the whole thing again, from the time I manacled Fanchet, and  if I find  that I was wrong&#8212;and I ever meet Carmin Fanchet again&#8212;  I shall not  be ashamed to get down on my knees and ask her pardon,  Marie-Anne!&quot; 
  For the first time he spoke the name which she had given him   permission to use. And she noticed it. He could not help seeing   that&#8212;a flashing instant in which the indefinable confession of it   was in her face, as though his use of it had surprised her, or   pleased her, or both. Then it was gone. 
  She did not answer, but rose from the big chair, and went to the   window, and stood with her back toward him, looking out over the   river. And then, suddenly, they heard a voice. It was the voice he   had heard twice in his sickness, the voice that had roused him  from  his sleep last night, crying out in his room for Black Roger  Audemard.  It came to him distinctly through the open door in a low  and moaning  monotone. He had not taken his eyes from the slim  figure of St.  Pierre's wife, and he saw a little tremor pass  through her now. 
  &quot;I heard that voice&#8212;again&#8212;last night,&quot; said David. &quot;It was in   this cabin, asking for Black Roger Audemard.&quot; 
  She did not seem to hear him, and he also turned so that he was   looking at the open door of the cabin. 
  The sun, pouring through in a golden flood, was all at once   darkened, and in the doorway&#8212;framed vividly against the day&#8212;was  the  figure of a man. A tense breath came to Carrigan's lips. At  first he  felt a shock, then an overwhelming sense of curiosity and  of pity. The  man was terribly deformed. His back and massive  shoulders were so  twisted and bent that he stood no higher than a  twelve-year-old boy;  yet standing straight, he would have been six  feet tall if an inch,  and splendidly proportioned. And in that  same breath with which shock  and pity came to him, David knew that  it was accident and not birth  that had malformed the great body  that stood like a crouching animal  in the open door. At first he  saw only the grotesqueness of it&#8212;the  long arms that almost  touched the floor, the broken back, the twisted  shoulders&#8212;and  then, with a deeper thrill, he saw nothing of these  things but  only the face and the head of the man. There was something  god-  like about them, fastened there between the crippled shoulders.  It  was not beauty, but strength&#8212;the strength of rock, of carven   granite, as if each feature had been chiseled out of something   imperishable and everlasting, yet lacking strangely and  mysteriously  the warm illumination that comes from a living soul.  The man was not  old, nor was he young. And he did not seem to see  Carrigan, who stood  nearest to him. He was looking at St. Pierre's  wife. 
  The look which David saw in her face was infinitely tender. She   was smiling at the misshapen hulk in the door as she might have   smiled at a little child. And David, looking back at the wide,   deep-set eyes of the man, saw the slumbering fire of a dog-like   worship in them. They shifted slowly, taking in the cabin,  questing,  seeking, searching for something which they could not  find. The lips  moved, and again he heard that weird and mysterious  monotone, as if  the plaintive voice of a child were coming out of  the huge frame of  the man, crying out as it had cried last night,   &quot;HAS-ANY-ONE-SEEN-BLACK-ROGER-AUDEMARD?&quot; 
  In another moment St. Pierre's wife was at the deformed giant's   side. She seemed tall beside him. She put her hands to his head  and  brushed back the grizzled black hair, laughing softly into his   upturned face, her eyes shining and a strange glow in her cheeks.   Carrigan, looking at them, felt his heart stand still. WAS THIS  MAN  ST. PIERRE? The thought came like a lightning flash&#8212;and went  as  quickly; it was impossible and inconceivable. And yet there was   something more than pity in the voice of the woman who was  speaking  now. 
  &quot;No, no, we have not seen him, Andre&#8212;we have not seen Black Roger   Audemard. If he comes, I will call you. I promise, Michiwan. I  will  call you!&quot; 
  She was stroking his bearded cheek, and then she put an arm about   his twisted shoulders, and slowly she turned so that in a moment  or  two they were facing the sun&#8212;and it seemed to Carrigan that  she was  talking and sobbing and laughing in the same breath, as  that great,  broken hulk of a man moved out slowly from under the  caress of her arm  and went on his way. For a space she looked  after him. Then in a swift  movement she closed the door and faced  Carrigan. She did not speak,  but waited. Her head was high. She  was breathing quickly. The  tenderness that a moment before had  filled her face was gone, and in  her eyes was the blaze of  fighting fires as she waited for him to  speak&#8212;to give voice to  what she knew was passing in his mind.
