  What a terrible and inexcusable madness had possessed him, Kent   realized the instant he rose from Mercer's prostrate body. Never  had  his brain flamed to that madness before. He believed at first  that he  had killed Mercer. It was neither pity nor regret that  brought him to  his senses. Mercer, a coward and a traitor, a sneak  of the lowest  type, had no excuse for living. It was the thought  that he had lost  his chance to reach the river that cleared his  head as he swayed over  Mercer. 
  He heard running feet. He saw figures approaching swiftly through   the starlight. And he was too weak to fight or run. The little   strength he had saved up, and which he had planned to use so   carefully in his flight, was gone. His wound, weeks in bed,  muscles  unaccustomed to the terrific exertion he had made in these  moments of  his vengeance, left him now panting and swaying as the  running  footsteps came nearer. 
  His head swam. For a space he was sickeningly dizzy, and in the   first moment of that dizziness, when every drop of blood in his  body  seemed rushing to his brain, his vision was twisted and his  sense of  direction gone. In his rage he had overexerted himself.  He knew that  something had gone wrong inside him and that he was  helpless. Even  then his impulse was to stagger toward the  inanimate Mercer and kick  him, but hands caught him and held him.  He heard an amazed voice, then  another&#8212;and something hard and  cold shut round his wrists like a pair  of toothless jaws. 
  It was Constable Carter, Inspector Kedsty's right-hand man about   barracks, that he saw first; then old Sands, the caretaker at   Cardigan's place. Swiftly as he had turned sick, his brain grew   clear, and his blood distributed itself evenly again through his   body. He held up his hands. Carter had slipped a pair of irons on   him, and the starlight glinted on the shining steel. Sands was   bending over Mercer, and Carter was saying in a low voice: 
  &quot;It's too bad, Kent. But I've got to do it. I saw you from the   window just as Mercer screamed. Why did you stop for him?&quot; 
  Mercer was getting up with the assistance of Sands. He turned a   bloated and unseeing face toward Kent and Carter. He was  blubbering  and moaning, as though entreating for mercy in the fear  that Kent had  not finished with him. Carter pulled Kent away. 
  &quot;There's only one thing for me to do now,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn't   pleasant. But the law says I must take you to barracks.&quot; 
  In the sky Kent saw the stars clearly again, and his lungs were   drinking in the cool air as in the wonderful moments before his   encounter with Mercer. 
  He had lost. And it was Mercer who had made him lose. Carter felt   the sudden tightening of his muscles as he walked with a hand on  his  arm. And Kent shut his teeth close and made no answer to what  Carter  had said, except that Carter heard something which he  thought was a  sob choked to death in the other's throat. 
  Carter, too, was a man bred of the red blood of the North, and he   knew what was in Kent's heart. For only by the breadth of a hair  had  Kent failed in his flight. 
  Pelly was on duty at barracks, and it was Pelly who locked him in   one of the three cells behind the detachment office. When he was   gone, Kent sat down on the edge of his prison cot and for the  first  time let the agony of his despair escape in a gasping breath  from  between his lips. Half an hour ago the world had reached out  its arms  to him, and he had gone forth to its welcome, only to  have the  grimmest tragedy of all his life descend upon him like  the sword of  Damocles. For this was real tragedy. Here there was  no hope. The  tentacles of the law had him in their grip, and he  could no longer  dream of escape. 
  Ghastly was the thought that it was he, James Kent, who had   supervised the building of these cells! Acquainted with every  trick  and stratagem of the prisoner plotting for his freedom, he  had left no  weak point in their structure. Again he clenched his  hands, and in his  soul he cursed Mercer as he went to the little  barred window that  overlooked the river from his cell. The river  was near now. He could  hear the murmur of it. He could see its  movement, and that movement,  played upon by the stars, seemed now  a writhing sort of almost  noiseless laughter taunting him in his  folly. 
  He went back to his cot, and in his despair buried his face in his   hands. In the half-hour after that he did not raise his head. For  the  first time in his life he knew that he was beaten, so utterly  beaten  that he no more had the desire to fight, and his soul was  dark with  the chaos of the things he had lost. 
  At last he opened his eyes to the blackness of his prison room,   and he beheld a marvelous thing. Across the gloom of the cell lay  a  shaft of golden fire. It was the light of the rising moon coming   through his little, steel-barred window. To Kent it had crept into   his cell like a living thing. He watched it, fascinated. His eyes   followed it to the foot-square aperture, and there, red and  glorious  as it rose over the forests, the moon itself filled the  world. For a  space he saw nothing but that moon crowding the frame  of his window.  And as he rose to his feet and stood where his face  was flooded in the  light of it, he felt stirring within him the  ghosts of his old hopes.  One by one they rose up and came to life.  He held out his hands, as if  to fill them with the liquid glow;  his heart beat faster in that glory  of the moonrise. The taunting  murmur of the river changed once more  into hopeful song, his  fingers closed tightly around the bars, and the  fighting spirit  rose in him again. As that spirit surged stronger,  beating down  his despair, driving the chaos out of his brain, he  watched the  moon as it climbed higher, changing from the red of the  lower  atmosphere to the yellow gold of the greater heights, marveling  at  the miracle of light and color that had never failed to stir him. 
  And then he laughed. If Pelly or Carter had heard him, they would   have wondered if he was mad. It was madness of a sort&#8212;the madness  of  restored confidence, of an unlimited faith, of an optimism that  was  bound to make dreams come true. Again he looked beyond the  bars of his  cell. The world was still there; the river was there;  all the things  that were worth fighting for were there. And he  would fight. Just how,  he did not try to tell himself now. And  then he laughed again, softly,  a bit grimly, for he saw the  melancholy humour of the fact that he had  built his own prison. 
  He sat down again on the edge of his cot, and the whimsical   thought struck him that all those he had brought to this same  cell,  and who had paid the first of their penance here, must be  laughing at  him now in the spirit way. In his mental fancy a  little army of faces  trooped before him, faces dark and white,  faces filled with hatred and  despair, faces brave with the cheer  of hope and faces pallid with the  dread of death. And of these  ghosts of his man-hunting prowess it was  Anton Fournet's face that  came out of the crowd and remained with him.  For he had brought  Anton to this same cell&#8212;Anton, the big Frenchman,  with his black  hair, his black beard, and his great, rolling laugh  that even in  the days when he was waiting for death had rattled the  paper-  weights on Kedsty's desk. 
  Anton rose up like a god before Kent now. He had killed a man, and   like a brave man he had not denied it. With a heart in his great  body  as gentle as a girl's, Anton had taken pride in the killing.  In his  prison days he sang songs to glorify it. He had killed the  white man  from Chippewyan who had stolen his neighbor's wife! Not  HIS wife, but  his neighbor's! For Anton's creed was, &quot;Do unto  others as you would  have others do unto you,&quot; and he had loved his  neighbor with the great  forest love of man for man. His neighbor  was weak, and Anton was  strong with the strength of a bull, so  that when the hour came, it was  Anton who had measured out  vengeance. When Kent brought Anton in, the  giant had laughed first  at the littleness of his cell, then at the  unsuspected strength of  it, and after that he had laughed and sung  great, roaring songs  every day of the brief tenure of life that was  given him. When he  died, it was with the smiling glory in his face of  one who had  cheaply righted a great wrong. 
  Kent would never forget Anton Fournet. He had never ceased to   grieve that it had been his misfortune to bring Anton in, and  always,  in close moments, the thought of Anton, the stout-hearted,  rallied him  back to courage. Never would he be the man that Anton  Fournet had  been, he told himself many times. Never would his  heart be as great or  as big, though the Law had hanged Anton by  the neck until the soul was  choked out of his splendid body, for  it was history that Anton Fournet  had never harmed man, woman, or  child until he set out to kill a human  snake and the Law placed  its heel upon him and crushed him. 
  And tonight Anton Fournet came into the cell again and sat with   Kent on the cot where he had slept many nights, and the ghosts of  his  laughter and his song filled Kent's ears, and his great  courage poured  itself out in the moonlit prison room so that at  last, when Kent  stretched himself on the cot to sleep, it was with  the knowledge that  the soul of the splendid dead had given him a  strength which it was  impossible to have gained from the living.  For Anton Fournet had died  smiling, laughing, singing&#8212;and it was  of Anton Fournet that he  dreamed when he fell asleep. And in that  dream came also the vision of  a man called Dirty Fingers&#8212;and with  it inspiration.
