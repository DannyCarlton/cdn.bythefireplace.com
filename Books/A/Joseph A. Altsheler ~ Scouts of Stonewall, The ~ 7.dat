  As they rode in the shadow of the Massanuttons Harry continued to  wonder.  The whole campaign in the valley had become to him an  interminable maze.  Stonewall Jackson might know what he intended to  do, but he was not  telling.  Meanwhile they marched back and forth.   There was incessant  skirmishing between cavalry and pickets, but it  did not seem to signify  anything.  Banks, sure of his overwhelming  numbers, pressed forward,  but always cautiously and slowly.  He did  not march into any trap.  And Harry surmised that Jackson, much too  weak to attack, was playing for  time. 
  Sherburne and his troop paused at the very base of the Massanuttons  and  Harry, who happened to be with them, looked up again at the lofty  summits  standing out so boldly and majestically in the middle of the  valley.  The oaks and maples along their slopes were now blossoming  into a green  that matched the tint of the pines, but far up on the  crests there was  still a line of snow, and white mists beyond. 
  &#8220;Why not climb the highest summit?&#8221; he said to Sherburne.  &#8220;You  have  powerful glasses and we could get a good view of what is going on  up the  valley.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Most of those slopes are not slopes at all.  They're perpendicular  like  the side of a house.  The horses could never get up.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But they can certainly go part of the way, and some of us can  climb the  rest on foot.&#8221; 
  Sherburne's eyes sparkled.  The spirit of adventure was strong  within  him.  Moreover the task, if done, was worth while. 
  &#8220;Good for you, Harry,&#8221; he exclaimed.  &#8220;We'll try it!  What do you  say,  St. Clair, you and Langdon?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I follow where you lead, and I hope that you lead to the top of  the  mountain,&#8221; replied St. Clair. 
  &#8220;Likely it's cold up there,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;but there are higher  and  colder mountains and I choose this one.&#8221; 
  They had learned promptness and decision from Stonewall Jackson,  and  Sherburne at once gave the order to ascend.  Several men in his  troop  were natives of that part of the valley, and they knew the  Massanuttons  well.  They led and the whole troop composed of youths  followed eagerly.  Bye and bye they dismounted and led their horses  over the trails which  grew slippery with wet and snow as they rose  higher. 
  When they paused at times to rest they would all look northward  over the  great valley, where a magnificent panorama had gradually  risen into view.  They saw a vast stretch of fields turning green, neat  villages, dark  belts of forest, the gleam of brooks and creeks, and  now and then,  the glitter from a Northern bayonet. 
  At length the chief guide, a youth named Wallace, announced that  the  horses could go no farther.  Even in summer when the snow was all  gone  and the earth was dry they could not find a footing.  Now it was  certain  death for them to try the icy steeps. 
  Sherburne ordered the main body of the troop to halt in a forested  and  sheltered glen in the side of the mountain, and, choosing Harry,   St. Clair, Langdon, the guide Wallace, and six others, he advanced  with  them on foot.  It was difficult climbing, and more than once they  were  bruised by falls, but they learned to regard such accidents as  trifles,  and ardent of spirit they pressed forward. 
  &#8220;I think we'll get a good view,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;See how  brilliantly  the sun is shining in the valley.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, and the mists on the crests are clearing away,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;Then with the aid of the glasses we can get a sweep up the valley  for  many miles.  Now boys, here we go! up! up!&#8221; 
  If it had not been for the bushes they could never have made the  ascent,  as they were now in the region of snow and ice and the slopes  were like  glass.  Often they were compelled to crawl, and it was  necessary, too,  to exercise a good deal of care in crawling. 
  St. Clair groaned as he rose after climbing a rock, and brushed the  knees  of his fine gray trousers. 
  &#8220;Cheer up, Arthur,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;it could have been worse.  The  sharp  stones there might have cut holes through them.&#8221; 
  But in spite of every difficulty and danger they went steadily  toward the  summit, and streamers of mist yet floating about the  mountain often  enclosed them in a damp shroud.  Obviously, however,  the clouds and  vapors were thinning, and soon the last shred would  float away. 
  &#8220;It ain't more'n a hundred feet more to the top,&#8221; said Wallace,  &#8220;an' it's  shore that the sun will be shinin' there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Shining for us, of course,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;It's a good omen.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish I could always look for the best as you do, Tom,&#8221; said St.  Clair. 
  &#8220;I'm glad I can.  Gay hearts are better than riches.  As sure as I  climb,  Arthur, I see the top.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, there it is, the nice snowy bump above us.&#8221; 
  They dragged themselves upon the loftiest crest, and, panting,  stood  there for a few minutes in several inches of snow.  Then the  wind caught  up the last shreds and tatters of mist, and whipped them  away southward.  Every one of them drew a deep, sharp breath, as the  great panorama of the  valley to the northward and far below was  unrolled before them. 
  The brilliant sunshine of early spring played over everything, but  far  down in the valley they seemed to see by contrast the true summer  of the  sunny south, which is often far from sunny.  But seen from the  top of the  mountain the valley was full of golden rays.  Now the roofs  of the  villages showed plainly and they saw with distinctness the long  silver  lines that marked the flowing of the rivers and creeks.  To the  east and  to the west further than the eye could reach rose the long  line of dim  blue mountains that enclosed the valley. 
  But it was the glitter of the bayonets in the valley that caused  the  hearts of the Virginians to beat most fiercely.  Banners and  guidons,  clusters of white tents, and dark swarms of men marked where  the foot of  the invading stranger trod their soil.  The Virginians  loved the great  valley.  Enclosed between the blue mountains it was  the richest and most  beautiful part of all their state.  It hurt them  terribly to see the  overwhelming forces of the North occupying its  towns and villages and  encamped in its fields. 
  Harry, not a Virginian himself, but a brother by association,  understood  and shared their feeling.  He saw Sherburne's lips moving  and he knew  that he was saying hard words between his teeth.  But  Sherburne's eyes  were at the glasses, and he looked a long time,  moving them slowly from  side to side.  After a while he handed them to  Harry. 
  The boy raised the glasses and the great panorama of the valley  sprang up  to his eyes.  It seemed to him that he could almost count  the soldiers in  the camps.  There was a troop of cavalry riding to the  southward, and  further to the left was another.  Directly to the north  was their  battlefield of Kernstown, and not far beyond it lay  Winchester.  He saw  such masses of the enemy's troops and so many  signs of activity among  them that he felt some movement must be  impending. 
  &#8220;What do you think of it, Harry?&#8221; said Sherburne. 
  &#8220;Banks must be getting ready to move forward.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think so, too.  I wish we had his numbers.&#8221; 
  &#8220;More men are coming for us.  We'll have Ewell's corps soon, and  General  Jackson himself is worth ten thousand men.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so, Harry, but ten thousand men are far too few.   McDowell's  whole corps is available, and with it the Yankees can now  turn more than  seventy thousand men into the valley.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And they can fight, too, as we saw at Kernstown,&#8221; said St. Clair. 
  &#8220;That's so, and I'm thinking they'll get their stomachs full of it  pretty  soon,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;Yesterday about dusk I went out in some  bushes  after firewood, and I saw a man kneeling.  It struck me as  curious,  and I went up closer.  What do you think?  It was Old Jack  praying.  Not any mock prayer, but praying to his Lord with all his  heart and soul.  I'm not much on praying myself, but I felt pretty  solemn then, and I slid  away from there as quick and quiet as you  please.  And I tell you,  fellows, that when Stonewall Jackson prays  it's time for the Yankees to  weep.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're probably right, Langdon,&#8221; said Captain Sherburne, &#8220;but it's  time  for us to be going back, and we'll tell what we've seen to  General  Jackson.&#8221; 
  As they turned away a crunching in the snow on the other slope  caused  them to stop.  The faces of men and then their figures appeared  through  the bushes.  They were eight or ten in number and all wore  blue uniforms.  Harry saw the leader, and instantly he recognized  Shepard.  It came to  him, too, in a flash of prescience, that Shepard  was just the man whom he  would meet there. 
  Sherburne, who had seen the blue uniforms, raised a pistol and  fired.  Two shots were fired by the Union men at the same instant, and  then both  parties dropped back from the crest, each on its own side. 
  Sherburne's men were untouched and Harry was confident that  Shepard's had  been equally lucky&#8212;the shots had been too hasty&#8212;but it  was nervous and  uncomfortable work, lying there in the snow, and  waiting for the head of  an enemy to appear over the crest. 
  Harry was near Captain Sherburne, and he whispered to him: 
  &#8220;I know the man whose face appeared first through the bushes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Who is he?&#8221; 
  &#8220;His name is Shepard.  He's a spy and scout for the North, and he  is  brave and dangerous.  He was in Montgomery when President Davis was   inaugurated.  I saw him in Washington when I was there as a spy  myself.  I saw him again in Winchester just before the battle of  Kernstown,  and now here he is once more.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Must be a Wandering Jew sort of a fellow.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He wanders with purpose.  He has certainly come up here to spy us  out.&#8221; 
  &#8220;In which he is no more guilty than we are.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's true, but what are we going to do about it, captain?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Blessed if I know.  Wait till I take a look.&#8221; 
  Captain Sherburne raised himself a little, in order to peep over  the  crest of the ridge.  A rifle cracked on the other side, a bullet  clipped  the top of his cap, and he dropped back in the snow, unhurt  but startled. 
  &#8220;This man, Shepard, is fully as dangerous as you claim him to be,&#8221;   he said to Harry. 
  &#8220;Can you see anything of them?&#8221; asked St. Clair. 
  &#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;If we show they shoot, and if they show we shoot,&#8221; said Langdon.   &#8220;Seems to me it's about the most beautiful case of checkmate that I've   known.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Perhaps we can stalk them,&#8221; said St. Clair. 
  &#8220;And perhaps they can stalk us,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;But I think both  sides  are afraid to try it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're right, Langdon,&#8221; said Captain Sherburne, &#8220;It's a case of   checkmate.  I confess that I don't know what to do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We could wait here while they waited too, and if we waited long  enough  it would get so dark we couldn't see each other.  But captain,  you are a  kind-hearted and sympathetic man, do you see any fun in  sitting in the  snow on top of a mountain, waiting to kill men whom you  don't want to  kill or to be killed by men who don't want to kill you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, Tom, I don't,&#8221; replied Captain Sherburne with a laugh, &#8220;and  you're  talking mighty sound sense.  This is not like a regular battle.   We've  nothing to gain by shooting those men, and they've nothing to  gain by  shooting us.  The Massanuttons extend a long distance and  there's nothing  to keep scouts and spies from climbing them at other  places.  We'll go  away from here.&#8221; 
  He gave the order.  They rose and crept as softly as they could  through  the snow and bushes down the side of the mountain.  Harry  looked back  occasionally, but he saw no faces appear on the crest.   Soon he heard  Langdon who was beside him laughing softly to himself. 
  &#8220;What's the matter, Tom?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;Harry, if I could take my pistol and shoot straight through this   mountain the bullet when it came out on the other side would hit a   soldier in blue clothes, going at the same rate of speed down the   mountain.&#8221; 
  &#8220;More than likely you're right, Tom, if they're sensible, and that  man  Shepard certainly is.&#8221; 
  Further down they met some of their own men climbing up.  The troop  had  heard the shots and was on the way to rescue, if rescue were  needed.  Captain Sherburne explained briefly and they continued the  descent,  leading their horses all the way, and breathing deep relief,  when they  stood at last in the plain. 
  &#8220;I'll remember that climb,&#8221; said Langdon to Harry as he sprang into  the  saddle, &#8220;and I won't do it again when there's snow up there,  unless  General Jackson himself forces me up with the point of a  bayonet.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The view was fine.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So it was, but the shooting was bad.  Not a Yank, not a Reb fell,   and I'm not unhappy over it.  A curious thing has happened to me,  Harry.  While I'm ready to fight the Yankee at the drop of the hat I  don't seem  to hate 'em as much as I did when the war began.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Same here.  The war ought not to have happened, but we're in it,  and to  my way of thinking we're going to be in it mighty deep and  long.&#8221; 
  Langdon was silent for a little while, but nothing could depress  him  long.  He was soon chattering away as merrily as ever while the  troop  rode back to General Jackson.  Harry regarded him with some  envy.  A temperament that could rejoice under any circumstances was  truly worth  having. 
  Sherburne reported to Ashby who in return sent him to the  commander,  Harry going with him to resume his place on the staff.   Jackson heard the  report without comment and his face expressed  nothing.  Harry could not  see that he had changed much since he had  come to join him.  A little  thinner, a little more worn, perhaps, but  he was the same quiet,  self-contained man, whose blue eyes often  looked over and beyond the one  to whom he was talking, as if he were  maturing plans far ahead. 
  Harry occupied a tent for the time with two or three other young  officers,  and being permitted a few hours off duty he visited his  friends of the  Invincibles, Colonel Leonidas Talbot and  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector  St. Hilaire.  The two old comrades already  had heard the results of the  scout from St. Clair and Langdon, but  they gave Harry a welcome because  they liked him.  They also gave him  a camp stool, no small luxury in an  army that marches and fights hard,  using more gunpowder than anything  else. 
  Harry put the stool against a tree, sat on it and leaned back  against the  trunk, feeling a great sense of luxury.  The two men  regarded him with a  benevolent eye.  They, too, were enjoying  luxuries, cigars which a  cavalry detail had captured from the enemy.   It struck Harry at the  moment that although one was of British  descent and the other of French  they were very much alike.  South  Carolina had bred them and then West  Point had cast them in her  unbreakable mold.  Neat, precise, they sat  rigidly erect, and smoked  their cigars. 
  &#8220;Do you like it on the staff of General Jackson, Harry,&#8221; asked  Colonel  Talbot. 
  &#8220;I felt regrets at leaving the Invincibles,&#8221; replied Harry  truthfully,  &#8220;but I like it.  I think it a privilege to be so near to  General Jackson.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A leader who has fought only one battle in independent command and  who  lost that,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire,  thoughtfully&#8212;he  knew that Harry would repeat nothing, &#8220;and who  nevertheless has the  utmost confidence of his men.  He does not joke  with them as the young  Napoleon did with his soldiers.  He has none of  the quality that we call  magnetic charm, and yet his troops are eager  to follow him anywhere.  He has won no victories, but his men believe  him capable of many.  He takes none of his officers into his  confidence, but all have it.  Incredible, but true.  Why is it?&#8221; 
  He put his cigar back in his mouth and puffed meditatively.   Colonel  Leonidas Talbot, who also had been puffing meditatively while  Lieutenant-  Colonel Hector St. Hilaire was speaking, now took his  cigar from his  mouth, blew away the delicate rings of smoke, and said  in an equally  thoughtful tone: 
  &#8220;It occurs to me, Hector, that it is the power of intellect.   Stonewall  Jackson has impressed the whole army down to the last and  least little  drummer with a sense of his mental force.  I tell you,  sir, that he is a  thinker, and thinkers are rare, much more rare than  people generally  believe.  There is only one man out of ten thousand  who does not act  wholly according to precedent and experience.  Habit  is so powerful that  when we think we are thinking we are not thinking  at all, we are merely  recalling the experiences of ourselves or  somebody else.  And of the rare  individuals who leave the well-trod  paths of thought to think new  thoughts, only a minutely small  percentage think right.  This minutely  small fraction represents  genius, the one man in a million or rather ten  million, or, to be more  accurate, the one man in a hundred million.&#8221; 
  Colonel Leonidas Talbot put the cigar back in his mouth and puffed  with  regularity and smoothness.  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire,  in his turn, took his cigar from his mouth once more, blew  away the fine  white rings of smoke and said: 
  &#8220;Leonidas, it appears to me that you have hit upon the truth, or as  our  legal friends would say, the truth, the whole truth and nothing  but the  truth.  I am in the middle of life and I realize suddenly that  in all the  years I have lived I have met but few thinkers, certainly  not more than  half a dozen, perhaps not more than three or four.&#8221; 
  He put his cigar back in his mouth and the two puffed  simultaneously and  with precision, blowing out the fine, delicate  rings of smoke at exactly  the same time.  Gentlemen of the old school  they were, even then, but  Harry recognized, too, that Colonel Leonidas  Talbot had spoken the  weighty truth.  Stonewall Jackson was a thinker,  and thinkers are never  numerous in the world.  He resolved to think  more for himself if he could,  and he sat there trying to think, while  he absently regarded the two  colonels. 
  Colonel Leonidas Talbot, after two minutes perhaps, took the cigar  from  his mouth once more and said to Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire: 
  &#8220;Fine cigars the Yankees make, Hector.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Quite true, Leonidas.  One of the best I have ever smoked.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not more than a dozen left.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then we must get more.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But how?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Stonewall Jackson will think of a way.&#8221; 
  Harry, despite his respect for them, was compelled to laugh.  But  the two  colonels laughed with him. 
  &#8220;The words of my friend Leonidas have been proved true within a few   minutes,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire.  &#8220;In doubt we   turned at once and with involuntary impulse to Stonewall Jackson to  think  of a way.  He has impressed us, as he has impressed the  privates, with  his intellectual power.&#8221; 
  Harry sat with them nearly an hour.  He had not only respect but   affection also for them.  Old-fashioned they might be in some ways,   but they were able military men, thoroughly alert, and he knew that he   could learn much from them.  When he left them he returned to General   Jackson and a few more days of waiting followed. 
  Winter was now wholly gone and spring, treacherous at first, was  becoming  real and reliable.  Reports heavy and ominous were coming  from McClellan.  He would disembark and march up the peninsula on  Richmond with a vast and  irresistible force.  Jackson might be drawn  off from the valley to help  Johnston in the defense of the capital.   But Banks with his great army  would then march down it as if on  parade. 
  Harry heard one morning that a new man was put in command of the  Southern  forces in Northern Virginia.  Robert Edward Lee was his name,  and it was  a good name, too.  He was the son of that famous Light  Horse Harry Lee  who was a favorite of Washington in the Revolution.   Already an elderly  man, he was sober and quiet, but the old West  Pointers passed the word  through Jackson's army that he was full of  courage and daring. 
  Harry felt the stimulus almost at once.  A fresh wind seemed to be   blowing down the Valley of Virginia.  Lee had sent word to Jackson  that  he might do what he could, and that he might draw to his help  also a  large division under Ewell.  The news spread through the army  and there  was a great buzzing.  Young Virginia was eager to march  against any odds,  and Harry was with them, heart and soul. 
  Nor were they kept waiting now.  The news had scarcely spread  through the  army when they heard the crack of carbines in their front.   The cavalry  of Ashby, increased by many recruits, was already  skirmishing with the  vanguard of Banks.  It was the last day of April  and Harry, sent to the  front, saw Ashby drive in all the Northern  cavalry.  When he returned  with the news Jackson instantly lifted up  his whole division and marched  by the flank through the hills, leaving  Ewell with his men to occupy  Banks in front.  The mind of the  &#8220;thinker&#8221; was working, and Harry knew it  as he rode behind him.  He  did not know what this movement meant, but he  had full confidence in  the man who led them. 
  Yet the marching, like all the other marching they had done, was of  the  hardest.  The ground, torn by hoofs, cannon wheels and the feet of   marching men, was a continuous quagmire.  Ponds made newly by the  rains  stood everywhere.  Often it required many horses and men to drag  a cannon  out of the mud.  The junior officers, and finally those of  the highest  rank, leaped from their horses and gave aid.  Jackson  himself carried  boughs and stones to help make a road. 
  Despite the utmost possible exertions the army could make only five  miles  in a single day and at the approach of night it flung itself  upon the  ground exhausted. 
  &#8220;I call this the Great Muddy Army,&#8221; said St. Clair, ruefully to  Harry,  as he surveyed his fine uniform, now smeared over with brown  liquid paste. 
  &#8220;It might have been worse,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;Suppose we had fallen  in a  quicksand and had been swallowed up utterly.  'Tis better to live  muddy  than not to live at all.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It would be better to call it the Great Tired Army just now,&#8221; said   Harry.  &#8220;To keep on pulling your feet all day long out of mud half a  yard  deep is the most exhausting thing I know or ever heard of.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; asked St. Clair. 
  &#8220;Blessed if I know,&#8221; replied Harry, &#8220;nor does anybody else save  one.  It's all hid under General Jackson's hat.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I guess it's Staunton,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;That's a fine town, as  good as  Winchester.  I've got kinsfolk there.  I came up once from  South Carolina  and made them a visit.&#8221; 
  But it was not Staunton, although Staunton, hearing of the march,  had  been joyfully expecting Jackson's men.  The fine morning came,  warm and  brilliant with sunshine, raising the spirits of the troops.   The roads  began to dry out fast and marching would be much easier.   But Jackson,  leading somberly on Little Sorrel, turned his back on  Staunton. 
  The Virginians stared in amazement when the heads of columns turned  away  from that trim and hospitable little city, which they knew was so   fervently attached to their cause.  Before them rose the long line of  the  Blue Ridge and they were marching straight toward it. 
  They marched a while in silence, and then a groan ran through the  ranks.  It was such a compound of dismay and grief that it made Harry  shiver.  The Virginians were leaving their beloved and beautiful  valley, leaving  it all to the invader, leaving the pretty little  places, Winchester and  Staunton and Harrisonburg and Strasburg and  Front Royal, and all the  towns and villages in which their families  and relatives lived.  Every  one of the Virginians had blood kin  everywhere through the valley. 
  The men began to whisper to one another, but the order of silence  was  passed sternly along the line.  They marched on, sullen and  gloomy,  but after a while their natural courage and their confidence  in their  commander returned.  Their spirits did not desert them, even  when they  left the valley behind them and began to climb the Blue  Ridge. 
  Up, up, they went through dense forests.  Harry remembered their  ascent  of the Massanuttons, but the snows were gone now.  They pressed  on until  they reached the crest of the ridges and there the whole army  paused,  high up in the air, while they looked with eager interest at  the rolling  Virginia country stretching toward the east until it sank  under the  horizon. 
  Harry saw smoke that marked the passing of trains, and he believed  that  they were now on their way to Richmond to help defend the capital  against  McClellan.  He glanced at Jackson, but the commander was as  tight-lipped  as ever.  Whatever was under that hat remained the secret  of its owner. 
  They descended the mountains and came to a railway station, where  many  cars were waiting.  Troops were hurried aboard expecting to start  for  Richmond, and then a sudden roar burst from them.  The trains did  not  move toward Richmond, but back, through defiles that would lead  them  again into their beloved valley.  Cheers one after another rolled  through  the trains, and Harry, who was in a forward car with the  Invincibles,  joined in as joyfully as the best Virginian of them all. 
  The boy was so much exhausted that he fell into a doze on a seat.   But afterward he dimly remembered that he heard the two colonels  talking.  They were trying to probe into the depths of Jackson's mind.   They  surmised that this march over the mountains had been made partly  to  delude Banks.  They were right, at least as far as the delusion of  Banks  went.  He had been telegraphing that the army of Jackson was  gone,  on its way to Richmond, and that there was nothing in front of  him save a  few skirmishers. 
  The Virginians left their trains in the valley again, waited for  their  wagons and artillery, and then marched on to Staunton, that neat  little  city that was so dear to so many of them.  But the mystery of  what was  under Jackson's hat remained a mystery.  They passed through  Staunton,  amid the cheering people, women and children waving hats,  scarfs and  handkerchiefs to their champions.  But the terrible  Stonewall gave them  no chance to dally in that pleasant place.   Staunton was left far behind  and they never stopped until they went  into camp on the side of another  range of mountains. 
  Here in a great forest they built a few fires, more not being  allowed,  and after a hasty supper most of the men lay down in their  blankets to  rest.  But the young officers did not sleep.  A small tent  for Jackson  had been raised by the side of the Invincibles, and Harry,  sitting on a  log, talked in low tones with Langdon and St. Clair.  The  three were of  the opinion that some blow was about to be struck, but  what it was they  did not know. 
  &#8220;The Yankees must have lost us entirely,&#8221; said Langdon.  &#8220;To tell  you the  truth, boys, I've lost myself.  I've been marching about so  much that I  don't know east from west and north from south.  I'm sure  that this is  the Southern army about us, but whether we're still in  Virginia or not is  beyond me.  What do you say, Arthur?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's Virginia still, Tom, but we've undoubtedly done a lot of  marching.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A lot of it!  'Lot' is a feeble word!  We've marched a million  miles in  the last few days.  I've checked 'em off by the bunions on  the soles of  my feet.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Look out, boys,&#8221; said St. Clair.  &#8220;Here comes the general!&#8221; 
  General Jackson was walking toward them.  His face had the usual  intense,  preoccupied look, but he smiled slightly when he saw the  three lads. 
  &#8220;Come, young gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we're going to take a look at  the  enemy.&#8221; 
  A group of older officers joined him, and the three lads followed   modestly.  They reached a towering crag and from it Harry saw a deep   valley fringed with woods, a river rushing down its center and further  on  a village.  Both banks of the river were thick with troops, men in  blue.  Over and beyond the valley was a great mass of mountains, ridge  on ridge  and peak on peak, covered with black forest, and cut by  defiles and  ravines so narrow that it was always dark within them. 
  Harry felt a strange, indescribable thrill.  The presence of the  enemy  and the wild setting of the mountains filled him with a kind of  awe. 
  &#8220;It's a Northern army under Milroy,&#8221; whispered St. Clair, who now  heard  Jackson talking to the older officers. 
  &#8220;Then there's going to be a battle,&#8221; said Harry.
