The next six months were the happiest time of her life, for  Herminia. All day long she worked hard with her classes; and often  in the evenings Alan Merrick dropped in for sweet converse and  companionship. Too free from any taint of sin or shame herself  ever to suspect that others could misinterpret her actions,  Herminia was hardly aware how the gossip of Bower Lane made free in  time with the name of the young lady who had taken a cottage in the  row, and whose relations with the tall gentleman that called so  much in the evenings were beginning to attract the attention of the  neighborhood. The poor slaves of washer-women and working men's  wives all around, with whom contented slavery to a drunken, husband  was the only "respectable" condition,--couldn't understand for the  life of them how the pretty young lady could make her name so  cheap; "and her that pretends to be so charitable and that, and  goes about in the parish like a district visitor!" Though to be  sure it had already struck the minds of Bower Lane that Herminia  never went "to church nor chapel;" and when people cut themselves  adrift from church and chapel, why, what sort of morality can you  reasonably expect of them? Nevertheless, Herminia's manners were  so sweet and engaging, to rich and poor alike, that Bower Lane  seriously regretted what it took to be her lapse from grace. Poor  purblind Bower Lane! A life-time would have failed it to discern  for itself how infinitely higher than its slavish "respectability"  was Herminia's freedom. In which respect, indeed, Bower Lane was  no doubt on a dead level with Belgravia, or, for the matter of  that, with Lambeth Palace.    
But Herminia, for her part, never discovered she was talked about.  To the pure all things are pure; and Herminia was dowered with that  perfect purity. And though Bower Lane lay but some few hundred  yards off from the Carlyle Place Girl's School, the social gulf  between them yet yawned so wide that good old Miss Smith-Waters  from Cambridge, the head-mistress of the school, never caught a  single echo of the washerwomen's gossip. Herminia's life through  those six months was one unclouded honeymoon. On Sundays, she and  Alan would go out of town together, and stroll across the breezy  summit of Leith Hill, or among the brown heather and garrulous  pine-woods that perfume the radiating spurs of Hind Head with their  aromatic resins. Her love for Alan was profound and absorbing;  while as for Alan, the more he gazed into the calm depths of that  crystal soul, the more deeply did he admire it. Gradually she was  raising him to her own level. It is impossible to mix with a lofty  nature and not acquire in time some tincture of its nobler and more  generous sentiments. Herminia was weaning Alan by degrees from the  world; she was teaching him to see that moral purity and moral  earnestness are worth more, after all, than to dwell with purple  hangings in all the tents of iniquity. She was making him  understand and sympathize with the motives which led her stoutly on  to her final martyrdom, which made her submit without a murmur of  discontent to her great renunciation.    
As yet, however, there was no hint or forecast of actual martyrdom.  On the contrary, her life flowed in all the halo of a honeymoon. It  was a honeymoon, too, undisturbed by the petty jars and discomforts  of domestic life; she saw Alan too seldom for either ever to lose  the keen sense of fresh delight in the other's presence. When she  met him, she thrilled to the delicate fingertips. Herminia had  planned it so of set purpose. In her reasoned philosophy of life,  she had early decided that 'tis the wear and tear of too close daily  intercourse which turns unawares the lover into the husband; and she  had determined that in her own converse with the man she loved that  cause of disillusion should never intrude itself. They conserved  their romance through all their plighted and united life. Herminia  had afterwards no recollections of Alan to look back upon save  ideally happy ones.    
So six months wore away. On the memory of those six months Herminia  was to subsist for half a lifetime. At the end of that time, Alan  began to fear that if she did not soon withdraw from the Carlyle  Place School, Miss Smith-Waters might begin to ask inconvenient  questions. Herminia, ever true to her principles, was for stopping  on till the bitter end, and compelling Miss Smith-Waters to dismiss  her from her situation. But Alan, more worldly wise, foresaw that  such a course must inevitably result in needless annoyance and  humiliation for Herminia; and Herminia was now beginning to be so  far influenced by Alan's personality that she yielded the point with  reluctance to his masculine judgment. It must be always so. The man  must needs retain for many years to come the personal hegemony he  has usurped over the woman; and the woman who once accepts him as  lover or as husband must give way in the end, even in matters of  principle, to his virile self-assertion. She would be less a woman,  and he less a man, were any other result possible. Deep down in the  very roots of the idea of sex we come on that prime antithesis,--the  male, active and aggressive; the female, sedentary, passive, and  receptive.    
And even on the broader question, experience shows one it is always  so in the world we live in. No man or woman can go through life in  consistent obedience to any high principle,--not even the willing  and deliberate martyrs. We must bow to circumstances. Herminia  had made up her mind beforehand for the crown of martyrdom, the one  possible guerdon this planet can bestow upon really noble and  disinterested action. And she never shrank from any necessary  pang, incidental to the prophet's and martyr's existence. Yet even  so, in a society almost wholly composed of mean and petty souls,  incapable of comprehending or appreciating any exalted moral  standpoint, it is practically impossible to live from day to day in  accordance with a higher or purer standard. The martyr who should  try so to walk without deviation of any sort, turning neither to  the right nor to the left in the smallest particular, must  accomplish his martyrdom prematurely on the pettiest side-issues,  and would never live at all to assert at the stake the great truth  which is the lodestar and goal of his existence.    
So Herminia gave way. Sadly against her will she gave way. One  morning in early March, she absented herself from her place in the  class-room without even taking leave of her beloved schoolgirls,  whom she had tried so hard unobtrusively to train up towards a  rational understanding of the universe around them, and sat down to  write a final letter of farewell to poor straight-laced kind-hearted  Miss Smith-Waters. She sat down to it with a sigh; for Miss  Smith-Waters, though her outlook upon the cosmos was through one  narrow chink, was a good soul up to her lights, and had been really  fond and proud of Herminia. She had rather shown her off, indeed, as  a social trump card to the hesitating parent,--"This is our second  mistress, Miss Barton; you know her father, perhaps; such an  excellent man, the Dean of Dunwich." And now, Herminia sat down with  a heavy heart, thinking to herself what a stab of pain the avowal  she had to make would send throbbing through that gentle old breast,  and how absolutely incapable dear Miss Smith-Waters could be of ever  appreciating the conscientious reasons which had led her,  Iphigenia-like, to her self-imposed sacrifice.    
But, for all that, she wrote her letter through, delicately,  sweetly, with feminine tact and feminine reticence. She told Miss  Smith-Waters frankly enough all it was necessary Miss Smith-Waters  should know; but she said it with such daintiness that even that  conventionalized and hide-bound old maid couldn't help feeling and  recognizing the purity and nobility of her misguided action. Poor  child, Miss Smith-Waters thought; she was mistaken, of course, sadly  and grievously mistaken; but, then, 'twas her heart that misled her,  no doubt; and Miss Smith-Waters, having dim recollections of a  far-away time when she herself too possessed some rudimentary  fragment of such a central vascular organ, fairly cried over the  poor girl's letter with sympathetic shame, and remorse, and  vexation. Miss Smith-Waters could hardly be expected to understand  that if Herminia had thought her conduct in the faintest degree  wrong, or indeed anything but the highest and best for humanity, she  could never conceivably have allowed even that loving heart of hers  to hurry her into it. For Herminia's devotion to principle was not  less but far greater than Miss Smith-Waters's own; only, as it  happened, the principles themselves were diametrically opposite.    
Herminia wrote her note with not a few tears for poor Miss  Smith-Waters's disappointment. That is the worst of living a life  morally ahead of your contemporaries; what you do with profoundest  conviction of its eternal rightness cannot fail to arouse hostile  and painful feelings even in the souls of the most right-minded of  your friends who still live in bondage to the conventional lies and  the conventional injustices. It is the good, indeed, who are most  against you. Still, Herminia steeled her heart to tell the simple  truth,--how, for the right's sake and humanity's she had made up her  mind to eschew the accursed thing, and to strike one bold blow for  the freedom and unfettered individuality of women. She knew in what  obloquy her action would involve her, she said; but she knew too,  that to do right for right's sake was a duty imposed by nature upon  every one of us; and that the clearer we could see ahead, and the  farther in front we could look, the more profoundly did that duty  shine forth for us. For her own part, she had never shrunk from  doing what she knew to be right for mankind in the end, though she  felt sure it must lead her to personal misery. Yet unless one woman  were prepared to lead the way, no freedom was possible. She had  found a man with whom she could spend her life in sympathy and  united usefulness; and with him she had elected to spend it in the  way pointed out to us by nature. Acting on his advice, though  somewhat against her own judgment, she meant to leave England for  the present, only returning again when she could return with the  dear life they had both been instrumental in bringing into the  world, and to which henceforth her main attention must be directed.  She signed it, "Your ever-grateful and devoted <i>Herminia</i>."    
Poor Miss Smith-Waters laid down that astonishing, that incredible  letter in a perfect whirl of amazement and stupefaction. She didn't  know what to make of it. It seemed to run counter to all her  preconceived ideas of moral action. That a young girl should venture  to think for herself at all about right and wrong was passing  strange; that she should arrive at original notions upon those  abstruse subjects, which were not the notions of constituted  authority and of the universal slave-drivers and obscurantists  generally,--notions full of luminousness upon the real relations and  duties of our race,--was to poor, cramped Miss Smith-Waters  well-nigh inconceivable. That a young girl should prefer freedom to  slavery; should deem it more moral to retain her divinely-conferred  individuality in spite of the world than to yield it up to a man for  life in return for the price of her board and lodging; should refuse  to sell her own body for a comfortable home and the shelter of a  name,--these things seemed to Miss Smith-Waters, with her  smaller-catechism standards of right and wrong, scarcely short of  sheer madness. Yet Herminia had so endeared herself to the old  lady's soul that on receipt of her letter Miss Smith-Waters went  upstairs to her own room with a neuralgic headache, and never again  in her life referred to her late second mistress in any other terms  than as "my poor dear sweet misguided Herminia."    
But when it became known next morning in Bower Lane that the  queenly-looking school-mistress who used to go round among "our  girls" with tickets for concerts and lectures and that, had  disappeared suddenly with the nice-looking young man who used to  come a-courting her on Sundays and evenings, the amazement and  surprise of respectable Bower Lane was simply unbounded. "Who  would have thought," the red-faced matrons of the cottages  remarked, over their quart of bitter, "the pore thing had it in  her! But there, it's these demure ones as is always the slyest!"  For Bower Lane could only judge that austere soul by its own vulgar  standard (as did also Belgravia). Most low minds, indeed, imagine  absolute hypocrisy must be involved in any striving after goodness  and abstract right-doing on the part of any who happen to  disbelieve in their own blood-thirsty deities, or their own vile  woman-degrading and prostituting morality. In the topsy-turvy  philosophy of Bower Lane and of Belgravia, what is usual is right;  while any conscious striving to be better and nobler than the mass  around one is regarded at once as either insane or criminal.
