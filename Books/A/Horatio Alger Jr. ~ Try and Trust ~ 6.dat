  Herbert woke up early the next morning, and a feeling of sadness  came  over him as he reflected that it was his last morning in  Waverley. He  was going out into the world, and, as he could not help  thinking, under  very unfavorable auspices. New scenes and new  experiences usually have a  charm for a boy, but Mr. Holden's  disagreeable face and unpleasant smile  rose before him, and the  prospect seemed far from tempting. 
  When he came downstairs, he found Mrs. Kent in the kitchen. 
  &quot;You are up early, Mrs. Kent,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Yes, Herbert; I want you to have a good breakfast before you go.&quot; 
  It certainly was a nice breakfast. Tender beefsteak, warm biscuit,   golden butter, potatoes fried crisp and brown, and excellent coffee,   might have tempted any appetite. Herbert, in spite of his sadness, did   full justice to the bountiful meal. 
  The family had hardly risen from breakfast when the sound of wheels  was  heard outside, and directly there was a knock at the door. 
  &quot;It's Mr. Holden,&quot; said the doctor, looking from the front window. 
  &quot;Must we part from you so soon, Herbert?&quot; said Mrs. Kent,   affectionately. 
  &quot;Where oo goin', Herbert?&quot; asked little Mary, clinging to his knee, 
  &quot;Herbert's going away, Mary,&quot; said he, stooping and kissing his  little  friend. 
  &quot;Herbert mustn't go 'way,&quot; said the little girl, in discontent. 
  &quot;Herbert come back soon, and bring candy for Mary,&quot; he said,  wishing  that his words might come true. 
  By that time Mr. Holden had entered, and was surveying the scene  with  his disagreeable smile. 
  &quot;Little Mary is quite attached to Herbert,&quot; said the doctor. 
  &quot;I am sorry,&quot; said Mr. Holden, &quot;that I have no little girls, as  Herbert  seems fond of them.&quot; 
  Herbert doubted if he could become attached to anyone related to  Mr.  Holden. 
  &quot;I'm a bachelor,&quot; said Mr. Holden, &quot;though perhaps I ought to be  ashamed  to say so. If I had had the good fortune early in life to  encounter a  lady like your good wife here, it might have been  different.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't too late yet, Mr. Holden,&quot; said the doctor. 
  &quot;Well, perhaps not. If Mrs. Kent is ever a widow, I may try my  luck.&quot; 
  &quot;What a disagreeable man,&quot; thought the doctor's wife, not  propitiated by  the compliment. &quot;Herbert,&quot; she said, &quot;here are a couple  of handkerchiefs  I bought in the village yesterday. I hope you will  find them useful.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; no doubt he will,&quot; said Mr. Holden, laughing. &quot;He will think  of  you whenever he has a bad cold.&quot; 
  Nobody even smiled at this witty sally, and, Mr. Holden, a little   disappointed, remarked: &quot;Well, time's getting on. I guess we must be   going, as we have a long journey before us.&quot; 
  The whole family accompanied Herbert to the road. After kissing  Mary and  Mrs. Kent, and shaking the doctor cordially by the hand,  Herbert jumped  into the wagon. Just before the horse started the  doctor handed our hero  a sealed envelope, saying, &quot;You can open it  after a while.&quot; 
  Though, like most boys of his age, Herbert had a great horror of  making  a baby of himself, he could hardly help crying as he rode up  the street,  and felt that he had parted from his best friends. His  eyes filled with  tears, which he quietly wiped away with the corner of  his handkerchief. 
  &quot;Come, come, don't blubber, boy,&quot; said Mr. Holden, coarsely. 
  Herbert was not weak enough to melt into tears at an unkind word.  It  roused his indignation, and he answered, shortly, &quot;When you see me   blubbering, it'll be time enough to speak, Mr. Holden.&quot; 
  &quot;It looked a good deal like it, at any rate,&quot; said Abner. &quot;However,  I'm  glad if I'm mistaken. There's nothing to cry about that I can  see.&quot; 
  &quot;No, perhaps not,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;but there's something to be sorry   for.&quot; 
  &quot;Something to be sorry for, is there?&quot; said Abner Holden. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, what is it?&quot; 
  &quot;I've left my best friends, and I don't know when I shall see them   again.&quot; 
  &quot;Nor I,&quot; said Mr. Holden. &quot;But I think it's high time you left  them.&quot; 
  &quot;Why?&quot; asked Herbert, indignantly. 
  &quot;Because they were petting you and making too much of you. You  won't get  such treatment as that from me.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't expect it,&quot; said our hero. 
  &quot;That's lucky,&quot; said Abner Holden, dryly. &quot;It's well that people   shouldn't expect what they are not likely to get.&quot; 
  Here a sense of the ludicrous came over Herbert as he thought of  being  Mr. Holden's pet, and he laughed heartily. Not understanding the  reason  of his sudden mirth, that gentleman demanded, in a tone of  irritation,  &quot;What are you making a fool of yourself about?&quot; 
  &quot;What am I laughing at?&quot; said Herbert, not liking the form of the   question. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; snarled Abner. 
  &quot;The idea of being your pet,&quot; explained Herbert, frankly. 
  Mr. Holden did not appreciate the joke, and said roughly, &quot;You  better  shut up, if you know what's best for yourself.&quot; 
  They rode along in silence for a few minutes. Then Abner Holden,   thinking suddenly of the envelope which Dr. Kent had placed in  Herbert's  hand at parting, and feeling curious as to its contents,  asked: 
  &quot;What did the doctor give you just as you were starting?&quot; 
  &quot;It was an envelope.&quot; 
  &quot;I know that; but what was there in it?&quot; 
  &quot;I haven't looked,&quot; said our hero. 
  He felt a little satisfaction in snubbing Mr. Holden, whom he saw  he  would never like. 
  &quot;Why don't you open it?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't think of it before.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose there is some present inside.&quot; 
  Herbert decided to open the envelope, out of respect for Dr. Kent.  On  opening it, he drew out a five-dollar bill, and a few penciled  words,  which were as follows: 
  &quot;DEAR HERBERT: I would gladly give you more if I had the means. I  hope  you will use the inclosed money in any way that may be most  serviceable  to you. You must write to me often. Be a good boy, as you  always have  been; let your aims be noble; try to do right at all  hazards, and may  God bless your efforts, and make you a good and true  man. Such is the  prayer of your affectionate friend, GEORGE KENT.&quot; 
  Herbert read these lines with emotion, and inwardly resolved that  he  would try to carry out the recommendations laid down. His thoughts  were  broken in upon by Mr. Holden, whose sharp eyes detected the  bank-note. 
  &quot;There's money in the letter, isn't there?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;How much?&quot; 
  &quot;Five dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;Five dollars, hey?&quot; he said. &quot;You'd better give it to me to keep  for  you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Holden; I can take care of it, myself.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't a good plan for boys to have so large a sum of money in  their  possession,&quot; said Abner Holden, who was anxious to secure it  himself. 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  &quot;Because they are likely to spend it improperly.&quot; 
  &quot;Dr. Kent didn't seem to think I was likely to do that.&quot; 
  &quot;No; he trusted you too much.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope it won't prove so.&quot; 
  &quot;You'd better keep out of the way of temptation. You might lose it,   besides.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't often lose things.&quot; 
  &quot;Come, boy,&quot; said Mr. Holden, getting impatient; &quot;Dr. Kent, no  doubt,  intended that I should take care of the money for you. You'd  better give  it up without further trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;Why didn't he give it to you, then?&quot; demanded Herbert. 
  &quot;He supposed you would give it to me.&quot; 
  Mr. Holden's motive for getting the money into his own hands was   twofold. First, he knew that without money Herbert would be more   helpless and more in his power. Secondly, as he had agreed to supply   Herbert with clothing, he thought he might appropriate the money  towards  this purpose, and it would be so much of a saving to his own  pocket.  Perhaps Herbert suspected some such design. At any rate, he  had no  intention of gratifying Mr. Holden by giving up the money. 
  &quot;Well, are you going to give me the money?&quot; blustered Abner Holden,   taking out his pocketbook, ready to receive it. 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;You'll repent this conduct, young man,&quot; said Holden, scowling. 
  &quot;I don't think I shall,&quot; said our hero. &quot;I don't understand why you  are  so anxious to get hold of the money.&quot; 
  &quot;It is for your good,&quot; said Abner. 
  &quot;I'd rather keep it,&quot; said Herbert. 
  Abner Holden hardly knew what to do. The money was by this time  safely  stowed away in Herbert's pocket, where he could not very well  get at it.  However, he had a plan for getting it which he resolved to  put into  practice when they stopped for dinner.
