  It was the candle-light that dragged Howland quickly back into  consciousness and pain. He knew that he was no longer in the snow. His  fingers dug into damp earth as he made an effort to raise himself, and  with that effort it seemed as though a red-hot knife had cleft him from  the top of his skull to his chest. The agony of that instant's pain  drew a sharp cry from him and he clutched both hands to his head,  waiting and fearing. It did not come again and he sat up. A hundred  candles danced and blinked before him like so many taunting eyes and  turned him dizzy with a sickening nausea. One by one the lights faded  away after that until there was left only the steady glow of the real  candle.
  The fingers of Howland's right hand were sticky when he drew them  away from his head, and he shivered. The tongue of flame leaping out of  the night, the thunderous report, the deluge of fire that had filled  his brain, all bore their meaning for him now. It had been a close  call, so close that shivering chills ran up and down his spine as he  struggled little by little to lift himself to his knees. His enemy's  shot had grazed his head. A quarter of an inch more, an eighth of an  inch even, and there would have been no awakening. He closed his eyes  for a few moments, and when he opened them his vision had gained  distance. About him he made out indistinctly the black encompassing  walls of his prison.
  It seemed an interminable time before he could rise and stand on his  feet and reach the candle. Slowly he felt his way along the wall until  he came to a low, heavy door, barred from the outside, and just beyond  this door he found a narrow aperture cut through the decaying logs. It  was a yard in length and barely wide enough for him to thrust through  an arm. Three more of these narrow slits in his prison walls he found  before he came back again to the door. They reminded him of the hole  through which he had looked out on the plague-stricken cabin at the<I>  Maison de Mort Rouge</I>, and he guessed that through them came what  little fresh air found its way into the dungeon.
  Near the table on which he replaced the candle was a stool, and he  sat down. Carefully he went through his pockets. His belt and revolver  were gone. He had been stripped of letters and papers. Not so much as a  match had been left him by his captors.
  He stopped in his search and listened. Faintly there came to him the  ticking of his watch. He felt in his watch pocket. It was empty. Again  he listened. This time he was sure that the sound came from his feet  and he lowered the candle until the light of it glistened on something  yellow an arm's distance away. It was his watch, and close beside it  lay his leather wallet. What money he had carried in the pocketbook was  untouched, but his personal cards and half a dozen papers that it had  contained were gone.
  He looked at the time. The hour hand pointed to four. Was it  possible that he had been unconscious for more than six hours? He had  left Jean on the mountain top soon after nightfall&#8212;it was not later  than nine o'clock when he had seen Meleese. Seven hours! Again he  lifted his hands to his head. His hair was stiff and matted with blood.  It had congealed thickly on his cheek and neck and had soaked the top  of his coat. He had bled a great deal, so much that he wondered he was  alive, and yet during those hours his captors had given him no  assistance, had not even bound a cloth about his head.
  Did they believe that the shot had killed him, that he was already  dead when they flung him into the dungeon? Or was this only one other  instance of the barbaric brutishness of those who so insistently sought  his life? The fighting blood rose in him with returning strength. If  they had left him a weapon, even the small knife they had taken from  his pocket, he would still make an effort to settle a last score or  two. But now he was helpless.
  There was, however, a ray of hope in the possibility that they  believed him dead. If they who had flung him into the dungeon believed  this, then he was safe for several hours. No one would come for his  body until broad day, and possibly not until the following night, when  a grave could be dug and he could be carried out with some secrecy. In  that time, if he could escape from his prison, he would be well on his  way to the Wekusko. He had no doubt that Jean was still a prisoner on  the mountain top. The dogs and sledge were there and both rifles were  where he had concealed them. It would be a hard race&#8212;a running fight  perhaps&#8212;but he would win, and after a time Meleese would come to him,  away down at the little hotel on the Saskatchewan.
  He rose to his feet, his blood growing warm, his eyes shining in the  candle-light. The thought of the girl as she had come to him out in the  night put back into him all of his old fighting strength, all of his  unconquerable hope and confidence. She had followed him when the dog  yelped at his heels, as the first shots had been fired; she had knelt  beside him in the snow as he lay bleeding at the feet of his enemies.  He had heard her voice calling to him, had felt the thrilling touch of  her arms, the terror and love of her lips as she thought him dying. She  had given herself to him; and she would come to him&#8212;his lady of the  snows&#8212;if he could escape.
  He went to the door and shoved against it with his shoulder. It was  immovable. Again he thrust his hand and arm through the first of the  narrow ventilating apertures. The wood with which his fingers came in  contact was rotting from moisture and age and he found that he could  tear out handfuls of it. He fell to work, digging with the fierce  eagerness of an animal. At the rate the soft pulpy wood gave way he  could win his freedom long before the earliest risers at the post were  awake.
  A sound stopped him, a hollow cough from out of the blackness beyond  the dungeon wall. It was followed an instant later by a gleam of light  and Howland darted quickly back to the table. He heard the slipping of  a bolt outside the door and it flashed on him then that he should have  thrown himself back into his old position on the floor. It was too late  for this action now. The door swung open and a shaft of light shot into  the chamber. For a space Howland was blinded by it and it was not until  the bearer of the lamp had advanced half-way to the table that he  recognized his visitor as Jean Croisset. The Frenchman's face was wild  and haggard. His eyes gleamed red and bloodshot as he stared at the  engineer.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, I had hoped to find you dead,&#8221; he whispered  huskily.
  He reached up to hang the big oil lamp he carried to a hook in the  log ceiling, and Howland sat amazed at the expression on his face.  Jean's great eyes gleamed like living coals from out of a death-mask.  Either fear or pain had wrought deep lines in his face. His hands  trembled as he steadied the lamp. The few hours that had passed since  Howland had left him a prisoner on the mountain top had transformed him  into an old man. Even his shoulders were hunched forward with an air of  weakness and despair as he turned from the lamp to the engineer.
  &#8220;I had hoped to find you dead, M'seur,&#8221; he repeated in a voice so  low it could not have been heard beyond the door. &#8220;That is why I did  not bind your wound and give you water when they turned you over to my  care. I wanted you to bleed to death. It would have been easier&#8212;for  both of us.&#8221;
  From under the table he drew forth a second stool and sat down  opposite Howland. The two men stared at each other over the sputtering  remnant of the candle. Before the engineer had recovered from his  astonishment at the sudden appearance of the man whom he believed to be  safely imprisoned in the old cabin, Croisset's shifting eyes fell on  the mass of torn wood under the aperture.
  &#8220;Too late, M'seur,&#8221; he said meaningly. &#8220;They are waiting up there  now. It is impossible for you to escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is what I thought about you,&#8221; replied Howland, forcing himself  to speak coolly. &#8220;How did you manage it?&#8221;
  &#8220;They came up to free me soon after they got you, M'seur. I am  grateful to you for thinking of me, for if you had not told them I  might have stayed there and starved like a beast in a trap.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was Meleese,&#8221; said Howland. &#8220;I told her.&#8221;
  Jean dropped his head in his hands.
  &#8220;I have just come from Meleese,&#8221; he whispered softly. &#8220;She sends you  her love, M'seur, and tells you not to give up hope. The great God, if  she only knew&#8212;if she only knew what is about to happen! No one has  told her. She is a prisoner in her room, and after that&#8212;after that out  on the plain&#8212;when she came to you and fought like one gone mad to save  you&#8212;they will not give her freedom until all is over. What time is it,  M'seur?&#8221;
  A clammy chill passed over Howland as he read the time.
  &#8220;Half-past four.&#8221;
  The Frenchman shivered; his fingers clasped and unclasped nervously  as he leaned nearer his companion.
  &#8220;The Virgin bear me witness that I wish I might strike ten years off  my life and give you freedom,&#8221; he breathed quickly. &#8220;I would do it this  instant, M'seur. I would help you to escape if it were in any way  possible. But they are in the room at the head of the stair&#8212;waiting.  At six&#8212;&#8221;
  Something seemed to choke him and he stopped.
  &#8220;At six&#8212;what then?&#8221; urged Howland. &#8220;My God, man, what makes you  look so? What is to happen at six?&#8221;
  Jean stiffened. A flash of the old fire gleamed in his eyes, and his  voice was steady and clear when he spoke again.
  &#8220;I have no time to lose in further talk like this, M'seur,&#8221; he said  almost harshly. &#8220;They know now that it was I who fought for you and for  Meleese on the Great North Trail. They know that it is I who saved you  at Wekusko. Meleese can no more save me than she can save you, and to  make my task a little harder they have made me their messenger, and&#8212;&#8221;
  Again he stopped, choking for words.
  &#8220;What?&#8221; insisted Howland, leaning toward him, his face as white as  the tallow in the little dish on the table.
  &#8220;Their executioner, M'seur.&#8221;
  With his hands gripped tightly on the table in front of him Jack  Howland sat as rigid as though an electric shock had passed through  him.
  &#8220;Great God!&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;First I am to tell you a story, M'seur,&#8221; continued Croisset,  leveling his reddened eyes to the engineer's. &#8220;It will not be long, and  I pray the Virgin to make you understand it as we people of the North  understand it. It begins sixteen years ago.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall understand, Jean,&#8221; whispered Howland. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was at one of the company's posts that it happened,&#8221; Jean began,  &#8220;and the story has to do with Le M'seur, the Factor, and his wife,<I>  L'Ange Blanc</I>&#8212;that is what she was called, M'seur&#8212;the White Angel.<I>  Mon Dieu</I>, how we loved her! Not with a wicked love, M'seur, but  with something very near to that which we give our Blessed Virgin. And  our love was but a pitiful thing when compared with the love of these  two, each for the other. She was beautiful, gloriously beautiful as we  know women up in the big snows; like Meleese, who was the youngest of  their children.
  &#8220;Ours was the happiest post in all this great northland, M'seur,&#8221;  continued Croisset after a moment's pause; &#8220;and it was all because of  this woman and the man, but mostly because of the woman. And when the  little Meleese came&#8212;she was the first white girl baby that any of us  had ever seen&#8212;our love for these two became something that I fear was  almost a sacrilege to our dear Lady of God. Perhaps you can not  understand such a love, M'seur; I know that it can not be understood  down in that world which you call civilization, for I have been there  and have seen. We would have died for the little Meleese, and the other  Meleese, her mother. And also, M'seur, we would have killed our own  brothers had they as much as spoken a word against them or cast at the  mother even as much as a look which was not the purest. That is how we  loved her sixteen years ago this winter, M'seur, and that is how we  love her memory still.&#8221;
  &#8220;She is dead,&#8221; uttered Howland, forgetting in these tense moments  the significance Jean's story might hold for him.
  &#8220;Yes; she is dead. M'seur, shall I tell you how she died?&#8221;
  Croisset sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing, his lithe body  twitching like a wolf's as he stood for an instant half leaning over  the engineer.
  &#8220;Shall I tell you how she died, M'seur?&#8221; he repeated, falling back  on his stool, his long arms stretched over the table. &#8220;It happened like  this, sixteen years ago, when the little Meleese was four years old and  the oldest of the three sons was fourteen. That winter a man and his  boy came up from Churchill. He had letters from the Factor at the Bay,  and our Factor and his wife opened their doors to him and to his son,  and gave them all that it was in their power to give.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, this man was from that glorious civilization of  yours, M'seur&#8212;from that land to the south where they say that Christ's  temples stand on every four corners, but he could not understand the  strange God and the strange laws of our people! For months he had been  away from the companionship of women, and in this great wilderness the  Factor's wife came into his life as the flower blossoms in the desert.  Ah, M'seur, I can see now how his wicked heart strove to accomplish the  things, and how he failed because the glory of our womanhood up here  has come straight down from Heaven. And in failing he went mad&#8212;mad  with that passion of the race I have seen in Montreal, and then&#8212;ah,  the Great God, M'seur, do you not understand what happened next?&#8221;
  Croisset lifted his head, his face twisted in a torture that was  half grief, half madness, and stared at Howland, with quivering  nostrils and heaving chest. In his companion's face he saw only a dead  white pallor of waiting, of half comprehension. He leaned over the  table again, controlling himself by a mighty effort.
  &#8220;It was at that time when most of us were out among the trappers,  just before our big spring caribou roast, when the forest people came  in with their furs, M'seur. The post was almost deserted. Do you  understand? The woman was alone in her cabin with the little  Meleese&#8212;and when we came back at night she was dead. Yes, M'seur, she  killed herself, leaving a few written words to the Factor telling him  what had happened.
  &#8220;The man and the boy escaped on a sledge after the crime.<I> Mon  Dieu</I>, how the forest people leaped in pursuit! Runners carried the  word over the mountains and through the swamps, and a hundred sledge  parties searched the forest trails for the man-fiend and his son. It  was the Factor himself and his youngest boy who found them, far out on  the Churchill trail. And what happened then, M'seur? Just this: While  the man-fiend urged on his dogs the son fired back with a rifle, and  one of his bullets went straight through the heart of the pursuing  Factor, so that in the space of one day and one night the little  Meleese was made both motherless and fatherless by these two whom the  devil had sent to destroy the most beautiful thing we have ever known  in this North. Ah, M'seur, you turn white! Does it bring a vision to  you now? Do you hear the crack of that rifle? Can you see&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;My God!&#8221; gasped Howland. Even now he understood nothing of what  this tragedy might mean to him&#8212;forgot everything but that he was  listening to the terrible tragedy that had come to the woman who was  the mother of the girl he loved. He half rose from his seat as Croisset  paused; his eyes glittered, his death-white face was set in tense  fierce lines, his finger-nails dug into the board table, as he  demanded, &#8220;What happened then, Croisset?&#8221;
  Jean was eying him like an animal. His voice was low.
  &#8220;They escaped, M'seur.&#8221;
  With a deep breath Howland sank back. In a moment he leaned again  toward Jean as he saw come into the Frenchman's eyes a slumbering fire  that a few seconds later blazed into vengeful malignity when he drew  slowly from an inside pocket of his coat a small parcel wrapped and  tied in soft buckskin.
  &#8220;They have sent you this, M'seur,&#8221; he said. &#8220;'At the very last,'  they told me, 'let him read this.'&#8220;
  With his eyes on the parcel, scarcely breathing, Howland waited  while with exasperating slowness Croisset's brown fingers untied the  cord that secured it.
  &#8220;First you must understand what this meant to us in the North,  M'seur,&#8221; said Jean, his hands covering the parcel after he had finished  with the cord. &#8220;We are different who live up here&#8212;different from those  who live in Montreal, and beyond. With us a lifetime is not too long to  spend in avenging a cruel wrong. It is our honor of the North. I was  fifteen then, and had been fostered by the Factor and his wife since  the day my mother died of the smallpox and I dragged myself into the  post, almost dead of starvation. So it happened that I was like a  brother to Meleese and the other three. The years passed, and the  desire for vengeance grew in us as we became older, until it was the  one thing that we most desired in life, even filling the gentle heart  of Meleese, whom we sent to school in Montreal when she was eleven,  M'seur. It was three years later&#8212;while she was still in Montreal&#8212;that  I went on one of my wandering searches to a post at the head of the  Great Slave, and there, M'seur&#8212;there&#8212;&#8221;
  Croisset had risen. His long arms were stretched high, his head  thrown back, his upturned face aflame with a passion that was almost  that of prayer.
  &#8220;M'seur, I thank the great God in Heaven that it was given to Jean  Croisset to meet one of those whom we had pledged our lives to  find&#8212;and I slew him!&#8221;
  He stood silent, eyes partly closed, still as if in prayer. When he  sank into his chair again the look of hatred had gone from his face.
  &#8220;It was the father, and I killed him, M'seur&#8212;killed him slowly,  telling him of what he had done as I choked the life from him; and  then, a little at a time, I let the life back into him, forcing him to  tell me where I would find his son, the slayer of Meleese's father. And  after that I closed on his throat until he was dead, and my dogs  dragged his body through three hundred miles of snow that the others  might look on him and know that he was dead. That was six years ago,  M'seur.&#8221;
  Howland was scarcely breathing.
  &#8220;And the other&#8212;the son&#8212;&#8221; he whispered densely. &#8220;You found him,  Croisset? You killed him?&#8221;
  &#8220;What would you have done, M'seur?&#8221;
  Howland's hands gripped those that guarded the little parcel.
  &#8220;I would have killed him, Jean.&#8221;
  He spoke slowly, deliberately.
  &#8220;I would have killed him,&#8221; he repeated.
  &#8220;I am glad of that, M'seur.&#8221;
  Jean was unwrapping the buckskin, fold after fold of it, until at  last there was revealed a roll of paper, soiled and yellow along the  edges.
  &#8220;These pages are taken from the day-book at the post where the woman  lived,&#8221; he explained softly, smoothing them under his hands. &#8220;Each day  the Factor of a post keeps a reckoning of incidents as they pass, as I  have heard that sea captains do on shipboard. It has been a company law  for hundreds of years. We have kept these pages to ourselves, M'seur.  They tell of what happened at our post sixteen years ago this winter.&#8221;
  As he spoke the half-breed came to Howland's side, smoothing the  first page on the table in front of him, his slim forefinger pointing  to the first few lines.
  &#8220;They came on this day,&#8221; he said, his breath close to the engineer's  ear. &#8220;These are their names, M'seur&#8212;the names of the two who destroyed  the paradise that our Blessed Lady gave to us many years ago.&#8221;
  In an instant Howland had read the lines. His blood seemed to dry in  his veins and his heart to stand still. For these were the words he  read: &#8220;On this day there came to our post, from the Churchill way, John  Howland and his son.&#8221;
  With a sharp cry he sprang to his feet, overturning the stool,  facing Croisset, his hands clenched, his body bent as if about to  spring. Jean stood calmly, his white teeth agleam. Then, slowly, he  stretched out a hand.
  &#8220;M'seur John Howland, will you read what happened to the father and  mother of the little Meleese sixteen years ago? Will you read, and  understand why your life was sought on the Great North Trail, why you  were placed on a case of dynamite in the Wekusko coyote, and why, with  the coming of this morning's dawn&#8212;at six&#8212;&#8221;
  He paused, shivering. Howland seemed not to notice the tremendous  effort Croisset was making to control himself. With the dazed  speechlessness of one recovering from a sudden blow he turned to the  table and bent over the papers that the Frenchman had laid out before  him. Five minutes later he raised his head. His face was as white as  chalk. Deep lines had settled about his mouth. As a sick man might, he  lifted his hand and passed it over his face and through his hair. But  his eyes were afire. Involuntarily Jean's body gathered itself as if to  meet attack.
  &#8220;I have read it,&#8221; he said huskily, as though the speaking of the  words caused him a great effort. &#8220;I understand now. My name is John  Howland. And my father's name was John Howland. I understand.&#8221;
  There was silence, in which the eyes of the two men met.
  &#8220;I understand,&#8221; repeated the engineer, advancing a step. &#8220;And you,  Jean Croisset&#8212;do you believe that I am<I> that</I> John Howland&#8212;the  John Howland&#8212;the son who&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped, waiting for Jean to comprehend, to speak.
  &#8220;M'seur, it makes no difference what I believe now. I have but one  other thing to tell you here&#8212;and one thing to give to you,&#8221; replied  Jean. &#8220;Those who have tried to kill you are the three brothers. Meleese  is their sister. Ours is a strange country, M'seur, governed since the  beginning of our time by laws which we have made ourselves. To those  who are waiting above no torture is too great for you. They have  condemned you to death. This morning, exactly as the minute hand of  your watch counts off the hour of six, you will be shot to death  through one of these holes in the dungeon walls. And this&#8212;this note  from Meleese&#8212;is the last thing I have to give you.&#8221;
  He dropped a folded bit of paper on the table. Mechanically Howland  reached for it. Stunned and speechless, cold with the horror of his  death sentence, he smoothed out the note. There were only a few words,  apparently written in great haste.
  &#8220;I have been praying for you all night. If God fails to answer my  prayers I will still do as I have promised&#8212;and follow you.&#8221; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Meleese.&#8221;
  He heard a movement and lifted his eyes. Jean was gone. The door was  swinging slowly inward. He heard the wooden bolt slip into place, and  after that there was not even the sound of a moccasined foot stealing  through the outer darkness.
