    &quot;Hector,&quot; said Mr. Crabb, nervously, &quot;I am going to leave the   institute at the end of the week.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you secured another situation, Mr. Crabb?&quot; asked Hector,   hopefully. 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered the usher, shaking his head. &quot;I have been   discharged.&quot; 
  &quot;For what reason?&quot; 
  &quot;For interfering with Mr. Smith's nephew when he was brutally   abusing Wilkins.&quot; 
  &quot;Did Mr. Smith fully understand the circumstances?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; but he stands by his nephew right or wrong. He blamed me for   checking his nephew's brutality.&quot; 
  &quot;This is shameful!&quot; said Hector, warmly. &quot;May I ask, Mr. Crabb, if   you have formed any plans?&quot; 
  &quot;No, except to seek a new position!&quot; answered Crabb. &quot;I fear,&quot; he   added, despondently, &quot;that it may be some time before I am so   fortunate. Roscoe, I don't know what to do when I leave the school.  I  shall barely have five dollars, and you know I have not only  myself,  but another to support.&quot; 
  &quot;Keep up your courage, Mr. Crabb! It is nearly time for me to hear   from the friend in New York to whom I wrote is your behalf. If you   can secure the position of his private tutor&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;If I can, I will hail it as providential. It will relieve me at   once from all anxiety.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I shall long remain here myself, Mr. Crabb,&quot; said   Hector. &quot;I came here with the full intention of making the most of   the facilities the institute affords for education, but I find the   principal incompetent, and disposed to connive at injustice and   brutality. The only good I have got here has been derived from your   instructions.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Roscoe. Such a tribute is, indeed, welcome,&quot; said the   usher, warmly. 
  &quot;It is quite sincere, Mr. Crabb, and I hope my good wishes may  bring  you the advantage which I have in view.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Roscoe. I don't blame you for being disgusted with the   management of the school. You have yourself suffered injustice.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; in writing home, and charging me with theft, before he had   investigated the circumstances, Mr. Smith did me a great injustice.  I  doubt whether he has since written to correct the false charge, as  I  required him to do. If not, I shall owe it to myself to leave the   school.&quot; 
  &quot;You will be justified in doing so.&quot; The next day brought Hector  two  letters. One was from Allan Roscoe, and read as follows: 
  &quot;HECTOR: I have received from your worthy teacher a letter which  has  filled me with grief and displeasure. I knew you had great faults,   but I did not dream that you would stoop so low as to purloin money,   as it seems you have done. Mr. Smith writes me that there is no room   to doubt your guilt. He himself discovered in the pocket of your   pantaloons a wallet containing a large sum of money, which he had   missed only a short time before. He learned that you had entered his   chamber, and taken the money, being tempted by your own dishonest  and  depraved heart. 
  &quot;I cannot express the shame I feel at this revelation of baseness.  I  am truly glad that you are not connected with me by blood. Yet I   cannot forget that my poor brother treated you as a son; and took   pains to train you up in right ideas. It would give him deep pain   could he know how the boy whom he so heaped with benefits has turned   out! I may say that Guy is as much shocked as I am, but he, it  seems,  had a better knowledge of you than I; for he tells me he is  not  surprised to hear it. I confess I am, for I thought better of  you. 
  &quot;Under the circumstances I shall not feel justified in doing for  you  as much as I intended. I proposed to keep you at school for two   years more, but I have now to announce that this is your last term,   and I advise you to make the most of it. I will try, when the term   closes, to find some situation for you, where your employer's money   will not pass through your hands. ALLAN ROSCOE.&quot; 
  Hector read the letter with conflicting feelings, the most  prominent  being indignation and contempt for the man who so easily  allowed  himself to think evil of him. 
  The other letter he found more satisfactory. 
  It was from his young friend in New York, Walter Boss. As it is   short, I subjoin it: 
  &quot;DEAR HECTOR: I am ever so glad to hear from you, but I should like   much better to see you. I read to papa what you said of Mr. Crabb,   and he says it is very apropos, as he had made up his mind to get me   a tutor. I am rather backward, you see, not having your taste for   study, and papa thinks I need special attention. He says that your   recommendation is sufficient, and he will engage Mr. Crabb without   any further inquiry; and he says he can come at once. He will give   him sixty dollars a month and board, and he will have considerable   time for himself, if he wants to study law or any other profession.  I  don't know but a cousin may join me in my studies, in which case  he  will pay a hundred dollars per month, if that will be  sastisfactory. 
  &quot;Why can't you come and make me a visit? We'll have jolly fun. Come   and stay a month, old chap. There is no one I should like  better.  Your friend, WALTER Boss.&quot; 
  Hector read this letter with genuine delight. It offered a way of   escape, both for the unfortunate usher aad himself. Nothing could be   more &quot;apropos&quot; to quote Walter's expression. 
  Our hero lost no time in seeking out Mr. Crabb. 
  &quot;You seem in good spirits, Roscoe,&quot; said the usher, his careworn   face contrasting with the beaming countenance of his pupil. 
  &quot;Yes, Mr. Crabb, I have reason to be, and so have you.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you heard from your friend?&quot; asked the usher, hopefully. 
  &quot;Yes, and it's all right.&quot; 
  Mr. Crabb looked ten years younger. 
  &quot;Is it really true?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;It is true that you are engaged as private tutor to my friend,   Walter. You'll find him a splendid fellow, but I don't know if the   pay is sufficient,&quot; continued Hector, gravely. 
  &quot;I am willing to take less pay than I get here,&quot; said the usher,   &quot;for the sake of getting away.&quot; 
  &quot;How much do you receive here?&quot; 
  &quot;Twenty dollar a month and board. I might, perhaps, get along on a   little less,&quot; he added doubtfully. 
  &quot;You won't have to, Mr. Crabb. You are offered sixty dollars a  month  and a home.&quot; 
  &quot;You are not in earnest, Roscoe?&quot; asked the usher, who could not   believe in his good fortune. 
  &quot;I will read you the letter, Mr. Crabb.&quot; 
  When it was read the usher looked radiant. &quot;Roscoe,&quot; he said, &quot;you   come to me like an angel from heaven. Just now I was sad and   depressed; now it seems to me that the whole future is radiant.  Sixty  dollars a month! Why, it will make me a rich man.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Crabb,&quot; said Hector, with a lurking spirit of fun, &quot;can you   really make up your mind to leave Smith Institute, and its kind and   benevolent principal?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think any prisoner ever welcomed his release with deeper   thankfulness,&quot; said the usher. &quot;To be in the employ of a man whom  you  despise, yet to feel yourself a helpless and hopeless dependent  on him  is, I assure you, Roscoe, a position by no means to be  envied. For two  years that has been my lot.&quot; 
  &quot;But it will soon be over.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, thanks to you. Why can't you accompany me, Hector? I ought   not, perhaps, to draw you away, but&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;But listen to the letter I have received from my kind and   considerate guardian, as he styles himself,&quot; said Hector. 
  He read Allan Roscoe's letter to the usher. 
  &quot;He seems in a great hurry to condemn you,&quot; said Mr. Crabb. 
  &quot;Yes, and to get me off his hands,&quot; said Hector, proudly. &quot;Well, he   shall be gratified in the last. I shall accept Walter's invitation,   and we will go up to New York together.&quot; 
  &quot;That will, indeed, please me. Of course, you will undeceive your   guardian.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. I will get Wilkins and Platt to prepare a statement of the   facts in the case, and accompany it by a note releasing Mr. Roscoe   from any further care or expense for me.&quot; 
  &quot;But, Hector, can you afford to do this?&quot; 
  &quot;I cannot afford to do otherwise, Mr. Crabb. I shall find friends,   and I am willing to work for my living, if need be,&quot; 
  At this point one of the boys came to Mr. Crabb with a message from   Socrates, desiring the usher to wait upon him at once.
