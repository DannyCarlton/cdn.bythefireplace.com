    On his way to the farmhouse, Philip ascertained that his  companion's  name was Abner Webb, and that he and his brother Jonas  carried on a  farm of about a hundred acres. Abner appeared to be about   twenty-five years old. 
  &quot;You seem pretty young to be a fiddler,&quot; said the young man,   surveying Philip with a glance of curiosity. 
  &quot;I am almost sixteen.&quot; 
  &quot;I am twenty-five, and I can't play at all.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't all in the age,&quot; returned our hero. &quot;Did you ever try to   learn?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I took one or two lessons, but I had to give it up for a bad   job. I couldn't get into it somehow.&quot; 
  &quot;You didn't try very long,&quot; said Philip, smiling. 
  &quot;I reckon I'd never do much at it. How long have you been a   fiddler?&quot; 
  &quot;I've been playing three or four years.&quot; 
  &quot;Sho! You don't say so! Do you like it?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; very much.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I'm glad you happened along. It would have been a pity to   have our dance spoiled.&quot; 
  By this time they had reached the farmhouse, and Abner went in,   followed by our hero. 
  A young woman, his brother's wife, looked at Philip in some   surprise. 
  &quot;You see, I've got a fiddler, after all,&quot; said Abner gleefully. &quot;We   won't have to put off the dance.&quot; 
  As he spoke, his brother Jonas came into the room, and the   explanation was repeated. 
  &quot;That's good,&quot; said Jonas heartily. &quot;You'd better go down to the   store after supper, Abner, and tell the boys, for they've just heard   that Paul Beck can't come.&quot; 
  &quot;You just save me some supper, and I'll go now. The boy'll stay  with  us to-night. That's the bargain I made with him.&quot; 
  &quot;He's heartily welcome,&quot; said Jonas Webb, a pleasant-faced man,  with  sandy complexion, who was probably from two to three years older   than his brother. &quot;You've happened along just at the right time.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad of it,&quot; said Philip; and there is no doubt he was   sincere, for we know how much he stood in need of employment, though   he naturally did not care to let his new friends know of his   destitution. 
  &quot;My brother didn't tell me your name,&quot; said Jonas. 
  &quot;My name is Philip Gray,&quot; answered our hero. 
  &quot;Do you go round playing for dances?&quot; inquired Jonas. 
  &quot;I have only just begun.&quot; 
  Philip didn't think it necessary to say that the idea of making   money in this way had never occurred to him till this very day. 
  &quot;Sit right up to supper, Jonas, and you, too, Mr. Gray,&quot; said Mrs.   Webb. 
  Philip was by no means loath, for the dishes which he saw on the   table had had the effect of stimulating his appetite, already   sharpened by his long walk and long fast. 
  Philip, as the guest, was first helped to a bountiful supply of  cold  meat, a hot biscuit, and some golden butter, not to mention two   kinds of preserves, for the Webbs always lived well. He was not slow   in doing justice to the good supper spread before him. He was almost   afraid to eat as much as he wanted, lest his appetite should attract   attention, and, therefore, was pleased to see that Jonas quite kept   pace with him. 
  Indeed, when he had already eaten as much as he dared, Mrs. Webb   said, hospitably: 
  &quot;I am afraid, Mr. Gray, you won't make out a supper.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think there is any danger of that,&quot; said Philip, smiling.   &quot;I have enjoyed my supper very much.&quot; 
  The young woman looked gratified by this tribute to her cooking,  and  just then Abner came in. 
  &quot;Did you see the boys, Abner?&quot; asked Jonas. 
  &quot;Yes, I saw them all. They were awfully glad we could have the   dance, after all. You see, we've been lookin' forward to it, and   didn't like to be disappointed. And now I must hurry down my supper,   for I've got to slick up and go for Mary Ann Temple. Are you goin',   Lucy?&quot; 
  &quot;Of course she is,&quot; answered Jonas. &quot;I don't have so far to go for   my girl as you do,&quot; he added slyly. 
  &quot;You used to go farther once, Jonas&#8212;six miles, where I have only  to  go two.&quot; 
  When supper was over, Philip inquired: 
  &quot;How early will the dance commence?&quot; 
  &quot;About eight. We keep early hours in the country, and we like to  get  our money's worth.&quot; 
  &quot;If you have no objection, I will go out to the barn and try my   violin a little to see if it is in good tune.&quot; 
  &quot;Try it in the next room,&quot; said the farmer's wife. 
  &quot;Yes, do!&quot; said her husband. &quot;We'd like to hear you.&quot; 
  He was a little afraid, judging from Philip's youth, that he could   not play very well, and this would give him an opportunity of   deciding how competent the boy was to take the place of Paul Beck,  of  Pomfret, who had quite a reputation in the towns around. 
  Philip went into the next room and began to prepare himself for his   evening's task. Though lus training had by no means been confined to   dancing-tunes, he was quite proficient in that department, having   more than once been called upon in Norton to officiate in a similar   capacity. 
  When Jonas had listened for five minutes to Philip, he turned to   Abner with a satisfied look. 
  &quot;He understands his business,&quot; he said, nodding with emphasis. &quot;He   ain't no new beginner.&quot; 
  &quot;I think he beats Paul Beck,&quot; said Abner, delighted to find his   choice approved. 
  &quot;I don't know but he does. I feel as if I wanted to start off now.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see how he does it,&quot; said Abner, with a puzzled look. &quot;I   never could do anything at it, though I'm almost twice as old.&quot; 
  He passed into the room where Philip was practising. 
  &quot;You're a tip-top player,&quot; said he, to Philip admiringly. &quot;Why, you   beat Paul Beck.&quot; 
  &quot;Is he the one you expected to have?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. Paul's got a big name for fiddlin'.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you like my playing,&quot; said Philip, who was naturally   pleased to find that he was likely to give satisfaction in his new   business. 
  &quot;The boys will be pleased, I can tell you.&quot; 
  &quot;I will do all I can to give them satisfaction,&quot; said Philip   modestly. 
  &quot;Oh, you will! there's no doubt about that. How much did you pay  for  your fiddle?&quot; 
  &quot;I believe it cost twenty-five dollars. My father gave it to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Sho! I didn't think fiddles cost so much.&quot; 
  &quot;Some cost a great deal more.&quot; 
  &quot;Seems a good deal to lay out, but you'll get your money back, if   you can get enough to do.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope so.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, you must excuse me now. I've got to slick up, and go after   Mary Ann Temple. She'd have been awfully disappointed if we'd had to   give it up.&quot; 
  &quot;Is she fond of dancing?&quot; 
  &quot;You'd better believe she is. Why, that girl could dance for four   hours stiddy&#8212;without wiltin'!&quot; 
  &quot;How late do you keep it up?&quot; 
  &quot;Till eleven or twelve. You won't be sleepy, will you?&quot; 
  &quot;If I am, I will get up later to-morrow morning.&quot; 
  &quot;That's all right. You can get up jest as late as you like. Lucy   will save you some breakfast. We don't allow no one to go hungry   here. But I must be off. You will go to the hall along with Jonas  and  Lucy. They'll introduce you round and see that you are taken  care of.&quot;  Philip congratulated himself on being so well provided  for, at least  for one night. The future was uncertain, but with the  money which he  was to receive for his services, he would be able to  get along for two  or three days, and he might, perhaps, if  successful, obtain another  similar engagement. 
  He had a new reason for being thankful that Squire Pope had not   succeeded in depriving him of his violin, for this was likely to   prove a breadwinner. 
  He continued to practice till it was time to go over to the hall.
