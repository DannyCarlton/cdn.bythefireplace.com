  The next number of the Centreville &#8220;Gazette&#8221; contained the following  notice from the pen of Mr. Anderson:&#8212;
  &#8220;For the first time since our connection with the 'Gazette,' we  purpose taking a brief respite from our duties. The state of our health  renders a vacation desirable, and an opportune invitation from a  brother at the West has been accepted. Our absence may extend to two or  three months. In the interim we have committed the editorial management  to Mr. Harry Walton, who has been connected with the paper, in a  different capacity, for nearly three years. Though Mr. Walton is a very  young man, he has already acquired a reputation, as contributor to  papers of high standing in Boston, and we feel assured that our  subscribers will have no reason to complain of the temporary change in  the editorship.&#8221;
  &#8220;The old man has given you quite a handsome notice, Harry,&#8221; said  Ferguson.
  &#8220;I hope I shall deserve it,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;but I begin now to realize  that I am young to assume such responsible duties. It would have seemed  more appropriate for you to undertake them.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't write well enough, Harry. I like to read, but I can't  produce. In regard to the business management I feel competent to  advise.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall certainly be guided by your advice, Ferguson.&#8221;
  As it may interest the reader, we will raise the curtain and show  our young hero in the capacity of editor. The time is ten days after  Mr. Anderson's absence. Harry was accustomed to do his work as  compositor in the forenoon and the early part of the afternoon. From  three to five he occupied the editorial chair, read letters, wrote  paragraphs, and saw visitors. He had just seated himself, when a man  entered the office and looked about him inquisitively.
  &#8220;I would like to see the editor,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I am the editor,&#8221; said Harry, with dignity.
  The visitor looked surprised.
  &#8220;You are the youngest-looking editor I have met,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have you  filled the office long?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not long,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir, you can. First let me introduce myself. I am Dr.  Theophilus Peabody.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you be seated, Dr. Peabody?&#8221;
  &#8220;You have probably heard of me before,&#8221; said the visitor.
  &#8220;I can't say that I have.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am surprised at that,&#8221; said the doctor, rather disgusted to find  himself unknown. &#8220;You must have heard of Peabody's Unfailing Panacea.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid I have not.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are young,&#8221; said Dr. Peabody, compassionately; &#8220;that accounts  for it. Peabody's Panacea, let me tell you, sir, is the great remedy of  the age. It has effected more cures, relieved more pain, soothed more  aching bosoms, and done more good, than any other medicine in  existence.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must be a satisfaction to you to have conferred such a blessing  on mankind,&#8221; said Harry, inclined to laugh at the doctor's magniloquent  style.
  &#8220;It is. I consider myself one of the benefactors of mankind; but,  sir, the medicine has not yet been fully introduced. There are  thousands, who groan on beds of pain, who are ignorant that for the  small sum of fifty cents they could be restored to health and  activity.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a pity.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a pity, Mr. &#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Walton.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Walton,&#8212;I have called, sir, to ask you to co-operate with me  in making it known to the world, so far as your influence extends.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is your medicine a liquid?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir; it is in the form of pills, twenty-four in a box. Let me  show you.&#8221;
  The doctor opened a wooden box, and displayed a collection of very  unwholesome-looking brown pills.
  &#8220;Try one, sir; it won't do you any harm.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you; I would rather not. I don't like pills. What will they  cure?&#8221;
  &#8220;What won't they cure? I've got a list of fifty-nine diseases in my  circular, all of which are relieved by Peabody's Panacea. They may cure  more; in fact, I've been told of a consumptive patient who was  considerably relieved by a single box. You won't try one?&#8221;
  &#8220;I would rather not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, here is my circular, containing accounts of remarkable cures  performed. Permit me to present you a box.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Harry, dubiously.
  &#8220;You'll probably be sick before long,&#8221; said the doctor, cheerfully,  &#8220;and then the pills will come handy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Doctor,&#8221; said Ferguson, gravely, &#8220;I find my hair getting thin on  top of the head. Do you think the panacea would restore it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor, unexpectedly. &#8220;I had a case, in Portsmouth,  of a gentleman whose head was as smooth as a billiard-ball. He took the  pills for another complaint, and was surprised, in the course of three  weeks, to find young hair sprouting all over the bald spot. Can't I  sell you half-a-dozen boxes? You may have half a dozen for two dollars  and a half.&#8221;
  Ferguson, who of course had been in jest, found it hard to forbear  laughing, especially when Harry joined the doctor in urging him to  purchase.
  &#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I can try Mr. Walton's box, and if it  helps me I can order some more.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may not be able to get it, then,&#8221; said the doctor,  persuasively. &#8220;I may not be in Centreville.&#8221;
  &#8220;If the panacea is well known, I can surely get it without  difficulty.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not so cheap as I will sell it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I won't take any to-day,&#8221; said Ferguson, decisively.
  &#8220;You haven't told me what I can do for you,&#8221; said Harry, who found  the doctor's call rather long.
  &#8220;I would like you to insert my circular to your paper. It won't take  more than two columns.&#8221;
  &#8220;We shall be happy to insert it at regular advertising rates.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Dr. Peabody, disappointed, &#8220;that you might do it  gratuitously, as I had given you a box.&#8221;
  &#8220;We don't do business on such terms,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I think I had  better return the box.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, keep it,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;You will be willing to notice it,  doubtless.&#8221;
  Harry rapidly penned this paragraph, and read it aloud:&#8212;
  &#8220;Dr. Theophilus Peabody has left with us a box of his Unfailing  Panacea, which he claims will cure a large variety of diseases.&#8221;
  &#8220;Couldn't you give a list of the diseases?&#8221; insinuated the doctor.
  &#8220;There are fifty-nine, you said?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I am afraid we must decline.&#8221;
  Harry resumed his writing, and the doctor took his leave, looking  far from satisfied.
  &#8220;Here, Ferguson,&#8221; said Harry, after the visitor had retired, &#8220;take  the pills, and much good may they do you. Better take one now for the  growth of your hair.&#8221;
  It was fortunate that Dr. Peabody did not hear the merriment that  followed, or he would have given up the editorial staff of the  Centreville &#8220;Gazette&#8221; as maliciously disposed to underrate his favorite  medicine.
  &#8220;Who wouldn't be an editor?&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I notice,&#8221; said Ferguson, &#8220;that pill-tenders and blacking  manufacturers are most liberal to the editorial profession. I only wish  jewellers and piano manufacturers were as free with their manufactures.  I would like a good gold watch, and I shall soon want a piano for my  daughter.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may depend upon it, Ferguson, when such gifts come in, that I  shall claim them as editorial perquisites.&#8221;
  &#8220;We won't quarrel about them till they come, Harry.&#8221;
  Our hero here opened a bulky communication.
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Ferguson.
  &#8220;An essay on 'The Immortality of the Soul,'&#8212;covers fifteen pages  foolscap. What shall I do with it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Publish it in a supplement with Dr. Peabody's circular.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not sure but the circular would be more interesting reading.&#8221;
  &#8220;From whom does the essay come?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is signed 'L. S.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Then it is by Lemuel Snodgrass, a retired schoolteacher, who  fancies himself a great writer.&#8221;
  &#8220;He'll be offended if I don't print it, won't he?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell you how to get over that. Say, in an editorial paragraph,  'We have received a thoughtful essay from 'L. S.', on 'The Immortality  of the Soul.' We regret that its length precludes our publishing it in  the 'Gazette.' We would suggest to the author to print it in a  pamphlet.' That suggestion will be regarded as complimentary, and we  may get the job of printing it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see you are shrewd, Ferguson. I will follow your advice.&#8221;
