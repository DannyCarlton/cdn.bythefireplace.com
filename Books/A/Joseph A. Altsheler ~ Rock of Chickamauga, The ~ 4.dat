  The night came down warm and heavy. Spring was far advanced in that  Southern region, and foliage and grass were already rich and heavy.  Dick, from his dozing position beside a camp fire, saw a great mass of  tall grass and green bushes beyond which lay the deep waters of a still  creek or bayou. The air, although thick and close, conduced to rest and  the peace that reigned after the battle was soothing to his soul.
  His friends, the two lads, who were knitted to him by so many  hardships and dangers shared, were sound asleep, and he could see their  tanned faces when the light of the flickering fires fell upon them.  Good old Warner! Good old Pennington! The comradeship of war knitted  youth together with ties that never could be broken.
  He moved into an easier position. He lay upon the soft turf and he  had doubled his blanket under his head as a pillow. At first the  droning noises of camp or preparation had come from afar, but soon they  ceased and now the frogs down by the sluggish waters began to croak.
  It was a musical sound, one that he had heard often in his native  state, and, singularly enough, the lad drew encouragement from it. &#8220;Be  of good cheer! Be of good cheer! Trust in the future! Trust in the  future!&#8221; said all those voices down among the swamps and reeds. And  then Dick said to himself: &#8220;I will trust and I will have hope!&#8221; He  remembered his last glimpse of Grant's short, strong figure and the  confidence that this man inspired in him. He, with tens of thousands of  others, Abraham Lincoln at their head, had been looking for a man, they  had looked long and in vain for such a man, but Dick was beginning to  believe that they had found him at last.
  It would take much of a man to stand before the genius of Lee, but  it might be Grant. Dick's faith in the star of his country, shattered  so often for the moment, began to rise that night and never sank again.
  He fell asleep to the homely music of the frogs among the reeds, and  slept without stir until nearly dawn.
  Just as the first strip of gray showed in the east Colonel  Winchester walked toward the spot where Dick and his comrades lay. The  colonel had not slept that night. His fine face was worn and thin, but  the blue eyes were alight with strength and energy. He had just left a  conference of high officers, and he came upon a mission. He reached the  three lads, and looked down at them with a sort of pity. He knew that  it was his duty to awake them at once and send them upon a perilous  errand, but they were so young, and they had already been through so  much that he hesitated.
  He put his hand upon Dick's shoulder and shook him. But it took more  than one shake to awaken the lad, and it was fully a minute before he  opened his eyes and sat up. Dick conscious but partly and rubbing his  sleepy eyes, asked:
  &#8220;What is it? Are we to go into battle again? Yes, sir! Yes, sir! I'm  ready!&#8221;
  &#8220;Not that, Dick, but I've orders for you.&#8221;
  Dick now awoke completely and saw that it was Colonel Winchester. He  sprang to his feet and saluted.
  &#8220;We'll wake up Warner and Pennington next,&#8221; said the colonel,  &#8220;because they go also on the kind of duty to which you're assigned.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad of that,&#8221; said Dick warmly.
  Warner and Pennington were aroused with difficulty, but, as soon as  they realized that Colonel Winchester was before them and that they  were selected for a grave duty, they became at once keen and alert.
  &#8220;Lads,&#8221; said the colonel briefly, &#8220;you've all felt that we're now  led by a great commander. But energy and daring on the part of a leader  demand energy and daring on the part of his men. General Grant is about  to undertake a great enterprise, one that demands the concentration of  his troops. I want you, Warner, to go to General Sherman with this  dispatch, and here is one for you, Pennington, to take to General  Banks.&#8221;
  He paused a moment and Dick asked:
  &#8220;Am I to be left out?&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester smiled.
  He liked this eagerness on the part of his boys, and yet there was  sadness in his smile, too. Young lieutenants who rode forth on errands  often failed to come back.
  &#8220;You're included, Dick,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I think that yours is the  most perilous mission of them all. Pennington, you and Warner can be  making ready and I'll tell Dick what he's to do.&#8221;
  The Vermonter and the Nebraskan hurried away and Colonel Winchester,  taking Dick by the arm, walked with him beyond the circle of firelight.
  &#8220;Dick,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;they asked me to choose the one in my  command whom I thought most fit for this duty to be done, and I've  selected you, although I'm sending you into a great peril.&#8221;
  Dick flushed with pride at the trust. Youth blinded him at present  to its perils.
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he said simply.
  &#8220;You will recall Major Hertford, who was with us in Kentucky before  the Shiloh days?&#8221;
  &#8220;I could not forget him, sir. One of our most gallant officers.&#8221;
  &#8220;You speak truly. He is one of our bravest, and also one of our  ablest. I speak of him as Major Hertford, but he has lately been  promoted to the rank of colonel, and he is operating toward the East  with a large body of cavalry, partly in conjunction with Grierson, who  saved us at the ford.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you want me to reach him, sir!&#8221;
  &#8220;You've divined it. He is near Jackson, the capital of this state,  and, incidentally, you're to discover as much as you can about Jackson  and the Confederate dispositions in that direction. We wish Hertford to  join General Grant's advance, which will presently move toward Jackson,  and we rely upon you to find him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll do it, if he's to be found at all,&#8221; said Dick fervently.
  &#8220;I knew it, but, Dick, you're to go in your uniform. I'll not have  you executed as a spy in case you're taken. Nor are you to carry any  written message to Colonel Hertford. He knows you well, and he'll  accept your word at once as truth. Now, this is a ride that will call  for woodcraft as well as soldiership.&#8221;
  &#8220;I start at once, do I not, sir?&#8221;
  &#8220;You do. Warner and Pennington are ready now, and your own horse is  waiting for you. Here is a small map which I have reason to believe is  accurate, at least fairly so, although few of our men know much of this  country. But use it, lad, as best you can.&#8221;
  It was a sheet of thick fibrous paper about six inches square and,  after a hasty glance at it, Dick folded it up carefully and put it in  his pocket. Warner and Pennington appeared then, mounted and armed and  ready to tell him good-bye. He and Colonel Winchester watched them a  moment or two as they rode away, and then an orderly appeared with  Dick's own horse, a fine bay, saddled, bridled, saddlebags filled with  food, pistols in holsters, and a breech-loading rifle strapped to the  saddle.
  &#8220;I've made your equipment the best I could,&#8221; said Colonel  Winchester, &#8220;and after you start, lad, you must use your own judgment.&#8221;
  He wrung the hand of the boy, for whom his affection was genuine and  deep, and Dick sprang into the saddle.
  &#8220;Good-bye, colonel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I thank you for this trust, and I  won't fail.&#8221;
  It was not a boast. It was courage speaking from the heart of youth  and, as Dick rode out of the camp on his good horse, he considered  himself equal to any task. He felt an enormous pride because he was  chosen for such an important and perilous mission, and he summoned  every faculty to meet its hardships and dangers.
  He had the password, and the sentinels wished him good luck. So did  the men who were gathering firewood. One, a small, weazened fellow,  gave him an envious look.
  &#8220;Wish I was going riding with you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's fine in the woods  now.&#8221;
  Dick laughed through sheer exuberance of spirits.
  &#8220;Maybe it is and maybe it isn't,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps the forest is  filled with rebel sharpshooters.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you ride toward Jackson you're likely to strike Confederate  bands.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't say where I'm going, but you may be certain I'll keep a  watch for those bands wherever I may be.&#8221;
  The little man was uncommonly strong nevertheless, as he carried on  his shoulder a heavy log which he threw down by one of the fires, but  Dick, absorbed in his journey, forgot the desire of the soldier to be  riding through the forest too.
  He soon left the camp behind. He looked back at it only once, and  beheld the luminous glow of the campfires. Then the forest shut it out  and he rode on through a region almost abandoned by its people owing to  the converging armies. He did not yet look at his map, because he knew  that he would soon come into the main road to Jackson. It would be  sufficient to determine his course then.
  Dick was not familiar with the farther South, which was a very  different region from his own Kentucky. His home was a region of firm  land, hills and clear streams, but here the ground lay low, the soil  was soft and the waters dark and sluggish. But his instincts as a  woodsman were fortified by much youthful training, and he felt that he  could find the way.
  It gave him now great joy to leave the army and ride away through  the deep woods. He was tired of battle and the sight of wounds and  death. The noises of the camp were painful to his ear, and in the  forest he found peace.
  He was absolutely alone in his world, and glad of it. The woods were  in all the depth and richness of a Southern spring. Vast masses of  green foliage billowed away to right and left. Great festoons of moss  hung from the oaks, and trailing vines wrapped many of the trees almost  to their tops. Wild flowers, pink, yellow and blue, unknown by name to  Dick, bloomed in the open spaces.
  The air of early morning was crisp with the breath of life. He had  come upon a low ridge of hard ground, away from the vast current and  low, sodden shores of the Mississippi. Here was a clean atmosphere, and  the forest, the forest everywhere. A mockingbird, perched on a bough  almost over his head, began to pour forth his liquid song, and from  another far away came the same song like an echo. Dick looked up but he  could not see the bird among the branches. Nevertheless he waved his  hand toward the place from which the melody came and gave a little  trill in reply. Then he said aloud:
  &#8220;It's a happy omen that you give me. I march away to the sound of  innocent music.&#8221;
  Then he increased his speed a little and rode without stopping until  he came to the main road to Jackson. There he examined his map upon  which were marked many rivers, creeks, lagoons and bayous, with  extensive shaded areas meaning forests. In the southeastern corner of  the map was Jackson, close to which he meant to go.
  He rode on at a fair pace, keeping an extremely careful watch ahead  and on either side of the road. He meant to turn aside soon into the  woods, but for the present he thought himself safe in the road&#8212;it was  not likely that Southern raiders would come so near to the Union camp.
  His feeling of peace deepened. He was so far away now that no  warlike sound could reach him. Instead the song of the mockingbird  pursued him. Dick, full of youth and life, began to whistle the tune  with the songster, and his horse perhaps soothed too by the rhythm  broke into the gentle pace which is so easy for the rider.
  It was early dawn, and the west was not yet wholly light. The east  was full of gold, but the silver lingered on the opposite horizon, and  the hot sun of Mississippi did not yet shed its rays over the earth.  Instead, a cool breeze blew on Dick's face, and the quick blood was  still leaping in his veins. The road dipped down and he came to a  brook, which was clear despite its proximity to the mighty yellow  trench of the Mississippi.
  He let his horse drink freely, and, while he drank, he surveyed the  country as well as he could. On his left he saw through a fringe of  woods a field of young corn and showing dimly beyond it a small house.  Unbroken forest stretched away on his right, but in field as well as  forest there was no sign of a human being.
  He studied his map again, noting the great number of water courses,  which in the spring season were likely to be at the flood, and, for the  first time, he realized the extreme difficulty of his mission.  Mississippi was in the very heart of the Confederacy. He could not  expect any sympathetic farmers to help him or show him the way. More  likely as he advanced toward Jackson he would find the country swarming  with the friends of the Confederacy, and to pass through them would  demand the last resource of skill and courage. Perhaps it would have  been wiser had he put on citizens clothes and taken his chances as a  spy! He did not know that Colonel Winchester would have ordered the  disguise had the one who rode on this most perilous mission been any  other than he.
  The realization brought with it extreme caution. Growing up in a  country which was still mainly in forest, not differing much from its  primitive condition, save for the absence of Indians and big game, he  had learned to be at home in the woods, and now he turned from the  path, riding among the trees.
  He kept a course some distance from the road, where he was sheltered  by the deep foliage and could yet see what was passing along the main  artery of travel. The ground at times was spongy, making traveling  hard, and twice his horse swam deep creeks. He would have turned into  the road at these points but the bridges were broken down and he had no  other choice.
  The morning waned, and the coolness departed. The sun hung overhead,  blazing hot, and the air in the forest grew dense and heavy. He would  have been glad to turn back into the road, in the hope of finding a  breeze in the open space, but caution still kept him in the forest. He  soon saw two men in brown jeans riding mules, farmers perhaps, but  carrying rifles on their shoulders, and, drawing his horse behind a big  tree, he waited until they passed.
  They rode on unseeing and he resumed his journey, to stop an hour  later and eat cold food, while he permitted his horse to graze in an  opening. He had seen only three houses, one a large colonial mansion,  with the smoke rising from several chimneys, and the others small log  structures inhabited by poor farmers, but nobody was at work in the  fields.
  When he resumed the journey he was thankful that he had kept to the  woods as a body of Confederate cavalry, coming out of a path from the  north, turned into the main road and advanced at a good pace toward  Jackson. They seemed to be in good spirits, as he could hear them  talking and laughing, but he was glad when they were out of sight as  these Southerners had keen eyes and a pair of them might have discerned  him in the brush.
  He went deeper into the woods and made another long study of his  map. It seemed to him now that he knew every hill and lagoon and road  and path, and he resolved to ride a straight course through the forest.  There was a point, distinctly marked north of Jackson, where he was to  find Hertford if he arrived in time, or to wait for him if he got there  ahead of time, and he believed that with the aid of the map he could  reach it through the woods.
  He rode now by the sun and he saw neither path nor fields. He was in  the deep wilderness once more. The mockingbirds sang around him again  and through the rifts in the leaves he saw the sailing hawks seeking  their prey. Three huge owls sitting in a row on a bough slept  undisturbed while he passed. He took it as an omen that the wilderness  was deserted, and his confidence was strong.
  But the firm ground ceased and he rode through a region of swamps.  The hoofs of his horse splashed through mud and water. Now and then a  snake drew away its slimy length and Dick shuddered. He could not help  it. Snakes, even the harmless, always gave him shivers.
  The wilderness now had an evil beauty. The vegetation was almost  tropical in its luxuriance, but Dick liked better the tender green of  his more northern state. Great beds of sunflowers nodded in the light  breeze. Vast masses of vines and creepers pulled down the trees, and on  many of the vines deep red roses were blooming. Then came areas of  solemn live oaks and gloomy cypresses, where no mockingbirds were  singing.
  He rode for half a mile along a deep lagoon or bayou, he did not  know which, and saw hawks swoop down and draw fish from its dark  surface. The whole scene was ugly and cruel, and he was glad when he  left it and entered the woods again. Once he thought he heard the  mellow voice of a negro singing, but that was the only sound, save the  flitting of small wild animals through the undergrowth.
  He came, mid-afternoon, to a river, which he made his horse swim  boldly and then entered forest that seemed more dense than ever. But  the ground here was firmer and he was glad of a chance to rest both  himself and his mount. He dismounted, tethered the horse and stretched  his own limbs, weary from riding.
  It was a pretty little glade, surrounded by high forest, fitted for  rest and peace, but his horse reared suddenly and tried to break loose.  There was a heavy crashing in the undergrowth and a deer, wild with  alarm, darting within a dozen feet of Dick, disappeared in the forest,  running madly.
  He knew there were many deer in the Mississippi woods, but he was  observant and the flight aroused his attention. His first thought that  he and his horse had scared the deer could not be true, because it had  come from a point directly behind and had rushed past them. Then its  alarm must have been caused by some other human being near by in the  forest or by a panther. His theory inclined to the human being.
  Dick was troubled. The more he thought of the incident the less he  liked it. He made no effort to hide from himself the dangers that  surrounded him in the land of the enemy, and remounting he rode briskly  forward. As the ground was firm and the forest was free enough from  undergrowth to permit of speed he finally broke into a gallop which he  maintained for a half-hour.
  He struck marsh again and was a long time in passing through it. But  when he was a half-mile on the other side he drew into a dense cluster  of bushes and waited. He could not get the flight of the deer out of  his mind, and knowing that it was well in the wilderness to obey  premonitions he watched more closely.
  Dick sat on his horse behind the bush a full five minutes, and  presently he became conscious that his heart was pounding heavily. He  exerted his will and called himself foolish, but in vain. The flight of  the deer persisted in his mind. It was a warning that somebody else was  in the woods not far behind him, and, while he waited, he saw a shadow  among the trees.
  It was only a shadow, but it was like the figure of a man. A single  glimpse and he was gone. The stranger, whoever he was, had darted back  in the undergrowth. Dick waited another five minutes, but the shadow  did not reappear. He felt a measure of relief because all doubts were  gone now. He was sure that he was followed, but by whom?
  He knew that his danger had increased manifold. Some Southern scout  or skirmisher had discovered his presence and, in such a quest, the  trailer had the advantage of the trailed. Yet he did not hesitate. He  knew his general direction and, shifting the pistols from the  saddle-holsters to his belt he again urged his horse forward.
  When they came to good ground he walked, leading his mount, as the  animal was much exhausted by the effort the marshes needed. But  whenever the undergrowth grew dense he stopped to look and listen. He  did not see the shadow and he heard nothing save the ordinary sounds of  the woods, but either instinct or imagination told him that the  stranger still followed.
  The sun was far down the westward slope, but it was still very hot  in the woods. There was no breeze. Not a leaf, nor a blade of grass  stirred. Dick heard his heart still pounding. The unseen pursuit&#8212;he  had no doubt it was there&#8212;was becoming a terrible strain upon his  nerves. The perspiration ran down his face, and he sought with angry  eyes for a sight of the fellow who presumed to hang upon his tracks.
  He began to wonder what he would do when the night came. There would  be no rest, no sleep for him, even in the darkness. Twice he curved  from his course and hid in the undergrowth to see his pursuer come up,  but there was nothing. Then he reasoned with himself. He had not really  seen the flitting figure of a man. It was merely the effect of an  alarmed imagination, and he told himself to ride straight on, looking  ahead, not back. But reason again yielded to instinct and he curved  once more into the deep forest, where the tangle of vines and  undergrowth also was so thick that it would take a keen eye to find  him.
  Dick looked back along the path which he had come and he was  confident that he saw some of the tall bushes shake a little. It could  not be wind, because the air was absolutely still, and soon he was  convinced that his instinct had been right all the time. Fancy had  played him no trick and the shadow that he had seen was a human figure.
  He felt with all the force of conviction that he was in great  danger, but he did not know what to do. So he did nothing, but sat  quietly on his horse among the bushes. The heat was intense there and  innumerable flies, gnats, and mosquitoes assailed him. The mosquitoes  were so fierce that they drew blood from his face a half-dozen times.
  Alone in the heat of the deep marshy wilderness he felt fear more  than in battle. Danger threatened here in a mysterious, invisible  fashion and he could only wait.
  He saw a bush move again, but much nearer, and then came the crack  of a rifle. If his horse, alarmed perhaps, had not thrown up his head  suddenly, and received the bullet himself the lad's career would have  ended there.
  The horse made a convulsive leap, then staggered for a few seconds,  giving his rider time to spring clear, and fell among the bushes. Dick  dropped down behind him and quickly unstrapped the rifle from the  saddle, meaning to use the animal's body as a breastwork against  renewed attack.
  His fear, the kind of fear that the bravest feel, had been driven  away by rage. The killing of his innocent horse, although the bullet  was intended for him, angered him as much as if he had received a wound  himself. The spirit of his ancestor, the shrewd and wary Indian  fighter, descended upon him again, and, lying upon his stomach behind  the horse, with the rifle ready he was anxious for the attack to come.
  Dick was firmly convinced that he had but a single enemy. Otherwise  he would have been attacked in force earlier, and more than one shot  would have been fired. But the report of the rifle was succeeded by  deep silence. The forest was absolutely still, not a breath of wind  stirring. His enemy remained invisible, but the besieged youth was  confident that he was lying quiet, awaiting another chance. Dick, still  hot with anger, would wait too.
  But other enemies were far more reckless than the hidden marksman.  The swarm of gnats, flies, and mosquitoes assailed him again and he  could have cried out in pain. His only consolation lay in the fact that  the other man might be suffering just as much.
  He was aware that his enemy might try a circling movement in order  to reach him on the flank or from behind, but he believed that his ear  would be keen enough to detect him if he came near. Moreover he lay in  a slight dip with the body of the horse in front of him, and it would  require an uncommon sharpshooter to reach him with a bullet. If he  could only stand those terrible mosquitoes an hour he felt that he  might get away, because then the night would be at hand.
  He saw with immense relief that the sun was already very low. The  heat, gathered in the woods, was at its worst, and over his head the  mosquitoes buzzed and buzzed incessantly. It seemed to him a horrible  sort of irony that he might presently be forced from his shelter by  mosquitoes and be killed in flight to another refuge.
  But he was endowed with great patience and tenacity and he clung to  his shelter, relying rather upon ear than eye to note the approach of  an enemy. Meanwhile the sun sank down to the rim of the wood, and the  twilight thickened rapidly in the east. Then a shot was fired from the  point from which the first had come. Dick heard the bullet singing over  his head, but it gave him satisfaction because he was able to locate  his enemy.
  He sought no return fire, but lay in the dip, wary and patient. The  sun sank beyond the rim, the western sky flamed blood red for a few  moments, and then the Southern night swept down so suddenly that it  seemed to come with violence. Dick believed that his escape was now at  hand, but he still showed an infinite patience.
  He did not stir from his place until the night was almost black, and  then, carrying his weapons and the saddlebag of provisions, he crept  among the thickets.
  When he stood up he found himself stiff from lying long in a cramped  position. His face burned from the bites of the mosquitoes, which still  hung in swarms about him, and he felt dizzy.
  But Dick remembered his mission, and his resolve to perform it was  not shaken a particle. He had lost his horse, but he could walk.  Perhaps his chance of success would be greater on foot in such a  dangerous country.
  He advanced now with extreme caution, feeling the way carefully and  testing the ground before he put his foot down solidly. Still trusting  to his ears he stopped now and then, and listened for some sound from  his enemy in pursuit. But nothing came, and soon he became quite sure  that he had shaken him off. He was merely a dot in the wilderness in  the dark, and, feeling secure now, he pressed forward with more speed.
  He was hoping to get to a piece of firm, high ground, where he might  secure a measure of protection from those terrible mosquitoes which  still buzzed angrily about his head. In an hour chance favored him, as  he reached a low ridge much rockier than usual in that region. He would  have built a little smudge fire to protect himself from the mosquitoes,  but it would be sure to draw the lurking sharpshooter, and instead he  found a nook in the ridge, under the low boughs of a great oak. Then he  took a light blanket which he carried tied to his saddlebags, and  wrapped it around his neck and face, covering everything but his mouth  and eyes.
  He sank into the nook with his back against the turf, and the  reclining position was wonderfully easy. The mosquitoes, apparently  finding the points of exposure too small, left him alone and went away.  His face still burned from numerous stings, but he forgot it in present  comfort. There was food in the saddlebags, and he ate enough for his  needs. Then he laid the saddlebags beside him and the rifle across his  knees and stared out into the darkness.
  He felt a great relief after his extreme danger and long exertions.  It was both physical and mental, and sitting there alone in a sunken  wilderness he was nevertheless happy. Believing that the mosquitoes  would not come back, he wrapped the blanket about his whole body by and  by, and pulled his cap down over his eyes.
  Dick had no plans for the night. He did not know whether he intended  to remain there long or not, but nature settled doubts for him. His  head drooped, and soon he slept as easily and peacefully as if he had  been at home at Pendleton in his own bed.
  Then the wilderness blotted him out for the time. The little wild  animals scurried through the grass or ran up trees. In the far distance  an owl hooted solemnly at nothing, and he slept the mighty sleep of  exhaustion.
