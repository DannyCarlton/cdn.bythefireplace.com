  In the new excitement that pulsated with every fiber of his being,  Howland forgot his own danger, forgot his old caution and the fears  that gave birth to it, forgot everything in these moments but Meleese  and his own great happiness. For he was happy, happier than he had ever  been in his life, happier than he had ever expected to be. He was  conscious of no madness in this strange, new joy that swept through his  being like a fire; he did not stop to weigh with himself the  unreasoning impulses that filled him. He had held Meleese in his arms,  he had told her of his love, and though she had accepted it with gentle  unresponsiveness he was thrilled by the memory of that last look in her  eyes, which had spoken faith, confidence, and perhaps even more. And  his faith in her had become as limitless as the blue space above him.  He had known her for but a few hours and yet in that time it seemed to  him that he had lived longer than in all of the years that had gone  before. She had lied to him, had divulged only a part of her  identity&#8212;and yet he knew that there were reasons for these things.
  To-morrow night he would see her again, and then&#8212;
  What would she tell him? Whatever it was, it was to be a reward for  his own love. He knew that, by the half-fearing tremble of her voice,  the sobbing catch of her breath, the soft glow in her eyes. Impelled by  that love, would she confide in him? And then&#8212;would he go back into  the South?
  He laughed, softly, joyfully.
  Yes, he would go back into the South&#8212;he would go to the other end  of the earth, if she would go with him. What was the building of this  railroad now to that other great thing that had come into his life? For  the first time he saw duty in another light. There were others who  could build the road; success, fortune, ambition&#8212;in the old way he had  seen them&#8212;were overshadowed now by this love of a girl.
  He stopped and lighted his pipe. The fragrant odor of the tobacco,  the flavor of the warm smoke in his mouth, helped to readjust him, to  cool his heated brain. The old fighting instincts leaped into life  again. Go into the South? He asked himself the question once more, and  in the gloomy silence of the forest his low laugh fell again as he  clenched his hands in anticipation of what was ahead of him. No&#8212;he  would build the road! And in building it he would win this girl, if it  was given for him to possess her.
  His saner thoughts brought back his caution. He went more slowly  toward the cabin, keeping in the deep shadows and stopping now and then  to listen. At the edge of the clearing he paused for a long time. There  was no sign of life about the cabin abandoned by Gregson and Thorne. It  was probable that the two men who had passed along the path had  returned to the camp by another trail, and still keeping as much within  the shadows as possible he went to the door and entered.
  With his feet propped in front of the big box stove sat Jackpine.  The Indian rose as Howland entered, and something in the sullen gloom  of his face caused the young engineer to eye him questioningly.
  &#8220;Any one been here, Jackpine?&#8221;
  The old sledge-driver gave his head a negative shake and hunched his  shoulders, pointing at the same time to the table, on which lay a  carefully folded piece of paper.
  &#8220;Thorne,&#8221; he grunted.
  Howland spread out the paper in the light of the lamp, and read:
  &#8220;MY DEAR HOWLAND:
  &#8220;I forgot to tell you that our mail sledge starts for Le Pas  to-morrow at noon, and as I'm planning on going down with it I want you  to get over as early as you can in the morning. Can put you on to  everything in the camp between eight and twelve. THORNE.&#8221;
  A whistle of astonishment escaped Howland's lips.
  &#8220;Where do you sleep, Jackpine?&#8221; he asked suddenly.
  &#8220;Cabin in edge of woods,&#8221; replied the Indian.
  &#8220;How about breakfast? Thorne hasn't put me on to the grub line yet.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thorne say you eat with heem in mornin'. I come early&#8212;wake you.  After heem go&#8212;to-morrow&#8212;eat here.&#8221;
  &#8220;You needn't wake me,&#8221; said Howland, throwing off his coat. &#8220;I'll  find Thorne&#8212;probably before he's up. Good night.&#8221;
  Jackpine had half opened the door, and for a moment the engineer  caught a glimpse of his dark, grinning face looking back over his  shoulder. He hesitated, as if about to speak, and then with a mouthful  of his inimitable chuckles, he went out.
  After bolting the door Howland lighted a small table lamp, entered  the sleeping room and prepared for bed.
  &#8220;Got to have a little sleep no matter if things are going off like a  Fourth of July celebration,&#8221; he grumbled, and rolled between the  sheets.
  In spite of his old habit of rising with the breaking of dawn it was  Jackpine who awakened him a few hours later. The camp was hardly astir  when he followed the Indian down among the log cabins to Thorne's  quarters. The senior engineer was already dressed.
  &#8220;Sorry to hustle you so, Howland,&#8221; he greeted, &#8220;but I've got to go  down with the mail. Just between you and me I don't believe the camp  doctor is much on his job. I've got a deuced bad shoulder and a worse  arm, and I'm going down to a good surgeon as fast as I can.&#8221;
  &#8220;Didn't they send Weston up with you?&#8221; asked Howland. He knew that  Weston was the best &#8220;accident man&#8221; in the company's employ.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;Weston,&#8221; replied the senior, eying him sharply. &#8220;I don't mean  to say he's not a good man, Howland,&#8221; he amended quickly. &#8220;But he  doesn't quite seem to take hold of this hurt of mine. By the way, I  looked over our pay-roll and there is no Croisset on it.&#8221;
  For an hour after breakfast the two men were busy with papers, maps  and drawings relative to the camp work. Howland had kept in close touch  with operations from Chicago and by the time they were ready to leave  for outside inspection he was confident that he could take hold without  the personal assistance of either Gregson or Thorne. Before that hour  had passed he was certain of at least one other thing&#8212;that it was not  incompetency that was taking the two senior engineers back to the home  office. He had half expected to find the working-end in the same  disorganized condition as its chiefs. But if Gregson and Thorne had  been laboring under a tremendous strain of some kind it was not  reflected in the company's work, as shown in the office records which  the latter had spread out before him.
  &#8220;That's a big six months' work,&#8221; said Thorne when they had finished.  &#8220;Good Lord, man, when we first came up here a jack-rabbit couldn't hop  through this place where you're sitting, and now see what we've got!  Fifty cabins, four mess-halls, two of the biggest warehouses north of  Winnipeg, a post-office, a hospital, three blacksmith shops and&#8212;a  ship-yard!&#8221;
  &#8220;A ship-yard!&#8221; exclaimed Howland in genuine surprise.
  &#8220;Sure, with a fifty-ton ship half built and frozen stiff in the ice.  You can finish her in the spring and you'll find her mighty useful for  bringing supplies from the head of the Wekusko. We're using horses on  the ice now. Had a deuced hard time in getting fifty of 'em up from Le  Pas. And besides all this, we've got six miles of road-bed built to the  south and three to the north. We've got a sub-camp at each working-end,  but most of the men still prefer to come in at night.&#8221; He dragged  himself slowly and painfully to his feet as a knock sounded at the  door. &#8220;That's MacDonald, our camp superintendent,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Told  him to be here at eight. He's a corker for taking hold of things.&#8221;
  A little, wiry, red-headed man hopped in as Thorne threw open the  door. The moment his eyes fell on Howland he sprang forward with  outstretched hand, smiling and bobbing his head.
  &#8220;Howland, of course!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Glad to see you! Five minutes  late&#8212;awful sorry&#8212;but they're having the devil's own time over at a  coyote we're going to blow this morning, and that's what kept me.&#8221;
  From Howland he whirled on the senior with the sudden movement of a  cricket.
  &#8220;How's the arm, Thorne? And if there's any mercy in your corpus tell  me if Jackpine brought me the cigarettes from Le Pas. If he forgot  them, as the mail did, I'll have his life as sure&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;He brought them,&#8221; said Thorne. &#8220;But how about this coyote, Mac? I  thought it was ready to fire.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it is&#8212;now. The south ridge is scheduled to go up at ten  o'clock. We'll blow up the big north mountains sometime to-night. It'll  make a glorious fireworks&#8212;one hundred and twenty-five barrels of  powder and four fifty-pound cases of dynamite&#8212;and if you can't walk  that far, Thorne, we'll take you up on a sledge. Mustn't allow you to  miss it!&#8221;
  &#8220;Sorry, but I'll have to, Mac. I'm going south with the mail. That's  why I want you with Howland and me this morning. It will be up to you  to get him acquainted with every detail in camp.&#8221;
  &#8220;Bully!&#8221; exclaimed the little superintendent, rubbing his hands with  brisk enthusiasm. &#8220;Greggy and Thorne have done some remarkable things,  Mr. Howland. You'll open your eyes when you see 'em! Talk about  building railroads! We've got 'em all beat a thousand ways&#8212;tearing  through forests, swamps and those blooming ridge-mountains&#8212;and here we  are pretty near up at the end of the earth. The new Trans-continental  isn't in it with us! The&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Ring off, Mac!&#8221; exclaimed Thorne; and Howland found himself  laughing down into the red, freckled face of the superintendent. He  liked this man immensely from the first.
  &#8220;He's a bunch of live wires, double-charged all the time,&#8221; said  Thorne in a low voice as MacDonald went out ahead of them. &#8220;Always like  that&#8212;happy as a boy most of the time, loved by the men, but the very  devil himself when he's riled. Don't know what this camp would do  without him.&#8221;
  This same thought occurred to Howland a dozen times during the next  two hours. MacDonald seemed to be the life and law of the camp, and he  wondered more and more at Thorne's demeanor. The camp chiefs and gang  foremen whom they met seemed to stand in a certain awe of the senior  engineer, but it was at the little red-headed Scotchman's cheery words  that their eyes lighted with enthusiasm. This was not like the old  Thorne, who had been the eye, the ear and the tongue of the company's  greatest engineering works for a decade past, and whose boundless  enthusiasm and love of work had been the largest factors in the winning  of fame that was more than national. He began to note that there was a  strange nervousness about Thorne when they were among the men, an  uneasy alertness in his eyes, as though he were looking for some  particular face among those they encountered. MacDonald's shrewd eyes  observed his perplexity, and once he took an opportunity to whisper:
  &#8220;I guess it's about time for Thorne to get back into civilization.  There's something bad in his system. Weston told me yesterday that his  injuries are coming along finely. I don't understand it.&#8221;
  A little later they returned with Thorne to his room.
  &#8220;I want Howland to see this south coyote go up,&#8221; said MacDonald.  &#8220;Can you spare him? We'll be back before noon.&#8221;
  &#8220;Certainly. Come and take dinner with me at twelve. That will give  me time to make memoranda of things I may have forgotten.&#8221;
  Howland fancied that there was a certain tone of relief in the  senior's voice, but he made no mention of it to the superintendent as  they walked swiftly to the scene of the &#8220;blow-out.&#8221; The coyote was  ready for firing when they arrived. The coyote itself&#8212;a tunnel of  fifty feet dug into the solid rock of the mountain and terminating in a  chamber packed with explosives&#8212;was closed by masses of broken rock,  rammed tight, and MacDonald showed his companion where the electric  wire passed to the fuse within.
  &#8220;It's a confounded mystery to me why Thorne doesn't care to see this  ridge blown up!&#8221; he exclaimed after they had finished the inspection.  &#8220;We've been at work for three months drilling this coyote, and the  bigger one to the north. There are four thousand square yards of rock  to come out of there, and six thousand out of the other. You don't see  shots like those three times in a lifetime, and there'll not be another  for us between here and the bay. What's the matter with Thorne?&#8221;
  Without waiting for a reply MacDonald walked swiftly in the  direction of a ridge to the right. Already guards had been thrown out  on all sides of the mountain and their thrilling warnings of  &#8220;Fire&#8212;Fire&#8212;Fire,&#8221; shouted through megaphones of birch-bark, echoed  with ominous meaning through the still wilderness, where for the time  all work had ceased. On the top of the ridge half a hundred of the  workmen had already assembled, and as Howland and the superintendent  came among them they fell back from around a big, flat boulder on which  was stationed the electric battery. MacDonald's face was flushed and  his eyes snapped like dragonflies as he pointed to a tiny button.
  &#8220;God, but I can't understand why Thorne doesn't care to see this,&#8221;  he said again. &#8220;Think of it, man&#8212;seven thousand five hundred pounds of  powder and two hundred of dynamite! A touch of this button, a flash  along the wire, and the fuse is struck. Then, four or five minutes, and  up goes a mountain that has stood here since the world began. Isn't it  glorious?&#8221; He straightened himself and took off his hat. &#8220;Mr. Howland,  will you press the button?&#8221;
  With a strange thrill Howland bent over the battery, his eyes turned  to the mass of rock looming sullen and black half a mile away, as if  bidding defiance in the face of impending fate. Tremblingly his finger  pressed on the little white knob, and a silence like that of death fell  on those who watched. One minute&#8212;two&#8212;three&#8212;five passed, while in the  bowels of the mountain the fuse was sizzling to its end. Then there  came a puff, something like a cloud of dust rising skyward, but without  sound; and before its upward belching had ceased a tongue of flame  spurted out of its crest&#8212;and after that, perhaps two seconds later,  came the explosion. There was a rumbling and a jarring, as if the earth  were convulsed under foot; volumes of dense black smoke shot upward,  shutting the mountain in an impenetrable pall of gloom; and in an  instant these rolling, twisting volumes of black became lurid, and an  explosion like that of a thousand great guns rent the air. As fast as  the eye could follow, sheets of flame shot out of the sea of smoke,  climbing higher and higher, in lightning flashes, until the lurid  tongues licked the air a quarter of a mile above the startled  wilderness. Explosion followed explosion, some of them coming in  hollow, reverberating booms, others sounding as if in mid-air. The  heavens were filled with hurtling rocks; solid masses of granite ten  feet square were thrown a hundred feet away; rocks weighing a ton were  hurled still farther, as if they were no more than stones flung by the  hand of a giant; chunks that would have crashed from the roof to the  basement of a sky-scraper dropped a third and nearly a half a mile  away. For three minutes the frightful convulsions continued. Then the  lurid lights died out of the pall of smoke, and the pall itself began  to settle. Howland felt a grip on his arm. Dumbly he turned and looked  into the white, staring face of the superintendent. His ears tingled,  every fiber in him seemed unstrung. MacDonald's voice came to him  strange and weird.
  &#8220;What do you think of that, Howland?&#8221; The two men gripped hands, and  when they looked again they saw dimly through dust and smoke only torn  and shattered masses of rock where had been the giant ridge that barred  the path of the new road to the bay.
  Howland talked but little on their way back to camp. The scene that  he had just witnessed affected him strangely; it stirred once more  within him all of his old ambition, all of his old enthusiasm, and yet  neither found voice in words. He was glad when the dinner was over at  Thorne's, and with the going of the mail sledge and the senior engineer  there came over him a still deeper sense of joy. Now<I> he</I> was in  charge, it was<I> his</I> road from that hour on. He crushed  MacDonald's hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted.  In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and  tried to realize just what this all meant for him. He was in charge&#8212;in  charge of the greatest railroad building job on earth&#8212;<I>he</I>, Jack  Howland, who less than twenty years ago was a barefooted, half-starved  urchin peddling papers in the streets where he was now famous! And now  what was this black thing that had come up to threaten his chances just  as he had about won his great fight? He clenched his hands as he  thought again of what had already happened&#8212;the cowardly attempt on his  life, the warnings, and his blood boiled to fever heat. That  night&#8212;after he had seen Meleese&#8212;he would know what to do. But he  would not be driven away, as Gregson and Thorne had been driven. He was  determined on that.
  The gloom of night falls early in the great northern mid-winter, and  it was already growing dusk when there came the sound of a voice  outside, followed a moment later by a loud knock at the door. At  Howland's invitation the door opened and the head and shoulders of a  man appeared.
  &#8220;Something has gone wrong out at the north coyote, sir, and Mr.  MacDonald wants you just as fast as you can get out there,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;He sent me down for you with a sledge.&#8221;
  &#8220;MacDonald told me the thing was ready for firing,&#8221; said Howland,  putting on his hat and coat. &#8220;What's the matter?&#8221;
  &#8220;Bad packing, I guess. Heard him swearing about it. He's in a  terrible sweat to see you.&#8221;
  Half an hour later the sledge drew up close to the place where  Howland had seen a score of men packing bags of powder and dynamite  earlier in the day. Half a dozen lanterns were burning among the rocks,  but there was no sign of movement or life. The engineer's companion  gave a sudden sharp crack of his long whip and in response to it there  came a muffled halloo from out of the gloom.
  &#8220;That's MacDonald, sir. You'll find him right up there near that  second light, where the coyote opens up. He's grilling the life out of  half a dozen men in the chamber, where he found the dynamite on top of  the powder instead of under it.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right!&#8221; called back Howland, starting up among the rocks.  Hardly had he taken a dozen steps when a dark object shot out behind  him and, fell with crushing force on his head. With, a groaning cry he  fell forward on his face. For a few moments he was conscious of voices  about him; he knew that he was being lifted in the arms of men, and  that after a time they were carrying him so that his feet dragged on  the ground. After that he seemed to be sinking down&#8212;down&#8212;down&#8212;until  he lost all sense of existence in a chaos of inky blackness.
