When John Scott returned to the stables his pulses were still throbbing  with joy and he trod the grass of the Elysian Fields. Young love is pure  and noble, a spontaneous emotion that has nothing in it of calculation,  and the wild and strange setting of his romance merely served to deepen  his feelings.    
He was the young crusader again, a knight coming to rescue his lady from  the hands of the infidels. He had made the impossible possible. He had  seen her and spoken with her, and despite his peasant clothes and his  position of a menial that he had willingly taken, she had known him at  once. He had seen the deep color flushing into her face and the light  like the first arrow of dawn spring into her eyes, and he knew that he  had not come in vain.    
He put so much vigor into his work, and he whistled and sang, low but so  joyously that the stolid Walther took notice.    
"Why are you so happy, you Castel?" he asked.    
"I've seen the sun, Herr Walther."    
"There is nothing uncommon about that. The sun has risen every morning  for a million years and more."    
"But not this sun, Herr Walther. It never rose before and it's the  brightest and most glorious of them all."    
Walther looked up at the sun. It was in truth bright, casting a golden  glow over all the mountains, but he saw nothing new about it.    
"It's a fine sun, as you say," he said, "but it's the same as ever. Ah,  you're French after all--in blood, I mean, I don't question your  loyalty--and you see things that are not. Too much imagination, Castel.  Quit it. It's not wholesome."    
"But I'm enjoying it, Herr Walther. Imagination is a glorious thing. You  see the same sun that I do in so far as our eyes are able to look upon  it, but you do not see it in the same way. It appears far more splendid  and glorious to me than it does to you. Our eyes are mirrors and mine  reflect today with much more power and much more depth of color than  yours do."    
Walther stared at him, comprehending but little of what he had said, and  shook his head slowly.    
"Your French blood is surely on top now, Castel," he said. "I should  call you a little mad if you didn't work so hard and with such a good  heart."    
"Ah, well, if we enjoy our madness, pray let us remain so."    
Walther shook his head again, and walked away some distance where he  stopped, and looked long at his new helper who toiled with uncommon  diligence but who whistled and sang in a low but happy manner as he  toiled. A new thought was slowly making its way into his stolid brain.  A man might have a madness, and be none the worse for it. Well, every  one to his own madness.    
John had heard from Ilse that Julie walked on the terrace twice every  day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, and he strove so to  arrange his work that he might see her again that afternoon. Knowing  that he was already a favorite with Walther he made many suggestions.  This horse or that needed exercise, and one that had been a favorite  with the prince before he had taken to the automobile, and that even now  was often ridden by him, would be all the better for sun and air.  Walther agreed with him and John deftly postponed the time until about  four o'clock, the warmest and brightest part of the afternoon, when he  thought it most likely that Julie would come again.    
He led the horse back and forth along a road that led from the stables  to a forest hanging on the slope, being in sight of the terrace about  half the way. But the terrace was bare and it was not until he had made  three or four turns that Julie with her following shadow, Suzanne,  appeared. Again John's heart beat heavily, and the hand that held the  bridle trembled. He could not help it. His mind, highly sensitive and  imaginative, was nevertheless powerful and tenacious to the last degree.  And he was there in the heart of old romance. The vast castle, gray and  sinister, loomed above him, but beyond was the golden light on the  mountains.    
He did not try to attract her attention, but, walking calmly on with  the horse, poured all his soul into the wish that she would look his  way. He had not the remotest belief in the supernatural as he told  himself again, but he continued to wish it with all his power and  strength, and presently her gaze turned toward the young peasant and the  horse who were walking slowly up and down the road. He was too far away  to read her face, but his fond fancy told him that she rejoiced again to  see him there.    
She looked at him a little while, but she made no sign or signal. He  expected none. She would know too well that it might create suspicion  and from some one of the many windows of the castle jealous eyes might  be watching.    
She advanced to the edge of the terrace with her faithful shadow still  close behind her, and then the prince came. He was in a white and silver  uniform of Austria, a magnificent figure of a man, despite his middle  years, and his great brown beard gave him a majestic aspect. But John  knew that his eyes were set close together and that the soul behind them  was unscrupulous and cruel.    
He saw Auersperg take off his gorgeous hat and bow low before the young  Julie. Then they walked together on the terrace, the dark shadow of  Suzanne following, but further behind now.    
John's heart was filled with a fierce and consuming rage. The presence  of Auersperg, magnificent, triumphant, powerful, a medieval baron here  in the most medieval of all settings, a very monarch indeed, brought him  back to earth. What could he do alone in the face of so much might?  What could Julie herself do, helpless, before so much pressure? And,  after all, from his point of view and from the point of view from his  class, Auersperg was making her a great offer, one that nobles in the  two empires would hold to be most honorable. For the first time he felt  a tremor of doubt, and then he stilled it as base and unworthy. The very  word "morganatic" was repulsive to him. It implied that the man stooped,  and that the woman surrendered something no real wife could yield.  Julie, whose blood was the blood of the great republican marshal, would  never submit to such a wrong.    
John presently saw someone standing on the steps of the terrace, and as  he turned with the horse, he beheld a wild and jealous face. It was  young Kratzek, and he was watching Auersperg and Julie. He was only a  lad, this Austrian noble, but John's heart felt a touch of sympathy. A  common love made them akin and he knew that Kratzek's love like his own  was the love of youth, high and pure. He felt neither hate nor jealousy  of the Austrian.    
His eyes went back to Julie and Auersperg. Their faces were turned  toward him now and he could see that it was the prince who talked and  that Julie listened, saying but little. The thud of hoofs on the road  into the valley came to him and Pappenheim, on his great black horse,  galloped into view. But he pulled to a walk when he saw the two on the  terrace, and John smiled to himself in grim irony. Pappenheim also loved  the ground upon which the young Julie walked. Von Arnheim and von  Boehlen should be there, too, and then the jealous circle would be  complete.    
Kratzek presently walked away, and Pappenheim rode slowly past the  castle and out of sight. Julie turned from the prince and looked fixedly  for a little while in John's direction. He felt that she meant it as a  sign, and he was eager to reply in some way, but prudence held him. Then  she went into the castle and Auersperg was left alone on the terrace.    
John saw that Prince Karl of Auersperg was very thoughtful. He walked  slowly back and forth, his figure magnified in the sun's glow, and now  and then he thoughtfully stroked his great brown beard. He seemed to  John more than ever out of place. His time was centuries ago among the  robber barons. In such a group he would not have been the worst, but in  his soul John wished that the hour for all such as he had come. If the  great war struck that dead trunk from the living body of the human race  it would not be fought wholly in vain.    
He went into the castle after a while, his walk slow and thoughtful, and  John returned with the horse to the stables. All the rest of the day, he  worked with such diligence and effect that Walther bade him rest.    
"You may go about the castle as much as you please," he said, "and you  may enter the part set aside for the servants, but you must stop there.  Nor can you go beyond the immediate castle grounds. If you try it you  risk a shot from the sentries."    
"I've no wish to be shot and so I'll not risk it," said John, with the  utmost sincerity, and after bathing his face and hands, he strolled  through the grounds of Zillenstein, his course soon and inevitably  leading him toward the addition to the right wing from the windows of  which lights were shining. Yet the grounds outside were heavy with  shrubbery, and, keeping hidden in it, he advanced farther and farther,  eager to see.    
He was not yet twenty yards from the walls and he saw human figures  passing before the windows. Then a dark form presently slipped from a  small door and stood a moment or two on the graveled walk, as if  undecided. John felt the pulses beating hard in his temples. He knew  that stalwart figure. It was none other than the grim and faithful  Suzanne and, daring all, he went to the very edge of the shrubbery,  calling in a loud whisper:    
"Suzanne! Suzanne!"    
She stood attentive, glanced about, and, seeing that no one observed  her, came to the edge of the deep shadow.    
"Suzanne! Suzanne!" called John again. "It is I, John Scott! Have you  any message for me from Mademoiselle Julie?"    
She looked again to see that none was near, and then stepped boldly into  the shrubbery, where John seized her arm half in entreaty and half to  hurry her.    
"O, Suzanne! Suzanne!" he repeated, with fierce insistence. "Have you  any word for me?"    
They were completely in the heavy shadow now, between the short clipped  pines, where no one, even but a few feet away, could see, and before  replying she looked at him, her grim face relaxing into a smile. She had  always watched him before with a sort of angry jealousy, but John  believed that he now read welcome and gladness in her eyes.    
"Suzanne! Suzanne!" he repeated, his insistence ever growing stronger.  "Is there no word for me?"    
"Aye," she said, "my mistress bids me tell you that she is grateful,  that she understands all you have risked for her sake, that she can  never repay you sufficiently for your great service, and that she feels  safer because you are near."    
"Ah," breathed John, "it is worth every risk to hear that."    
"But she fears for you. She knows that you are in great danger here. If  they discover who you are, you perish at once as a spy. So she bids me  tell you to go away. It is easy to escape from here to the Italian  frontier. She would not have you lose your life for her."    
"Is it because my life is of more value to her than that of any other  man? Oh, tell me, I pray you?"    
Another of her rare smiles passed over the grim face of the woman.    
"It is a question that Mademoiselle Julie alone can answer," she said.  "But when she went to her room she wept a little and her tears were not  those of sorrow."    
"Oh, then, Suzanne, she is indeed glad that I am here. Tell her that I  came for her, and that I will not go away until she goes too."    
"She is in no great danger here; she is a prisoner, but they treat her  as a guest, one of high degree."    
"Auersperg would force her to marry him."    
Suzanne smiled once more, but gravely.    
"The prince would marry her," she said, "and he is not the only one who  wishes to do so. But fear not. Auersperg cannot force her to marry him.  She is of the same tempered steel as her brother, the great Monsieur  Philip. Were she a man as he is, she would dare as much as he does, and  being a woman she will dare in a woman's way none the less."    
"And the others, Kratzek and Pappenheim, and von Arnheim if he should  come, they are young and brave and true! Might she not, as the only way  of escape from the high-handed baron, marry one of them?"    
For the fourth time Suzanne smiled. Never before had she permitted  herself that luxury so many times in a month, but there was an odd glint  in this latest smile of hers, which gave to her face a rare look of  softness.    
"Nor will she marry any of them," she said, "although they are brave and  honest and true and love her. Mademoiselle Julie has her own reasons  which she does not tell to me, but I know. She will not marry Prince  Karl of Auersperg. She will not marry Prince Wilhelm von Arnheim, she  will not marry Count Leopold Kratzek, she will not marry Count  Maximilien Pappenheim. Do I not know her well, I who have been with her  all her life?"    
And once more that smile with the odd glint in it passed over her stern  face. But John in the thickening dusk could not see it, although her low  earnest voice carried conviction.    
"Tell her for me, will you, Suzanne," he said, "that I think I can take  her from the castle of Zillenstein. Tell her, too, that I am in little  danger in my peasant's clothes. I have been face to face with the prince  himself and he has shown no sign of recognition, nor has Count Kratzek  who was my prisoner once. Tell her that I will not go. Tell her that my  heart is light because she fears for my safety and, O Suzanne, tell her  that I will watch over her the best I can, until all of us escape from  this hateful castle."    
"It is much to tell. How can I remember it alt?"    
"Then tell her all you remember."    
"That I promise. And now it's time for me to go back. We cannot risk too  much."    
She turned away, but John had another question to ask her. His heart  smote him that he had not thought of Picard.    
"Your father, Suzanne?" he said. "I have not heard of him. Is he here?"    
"They left him a prisoner at Munich. Doubtless he will escape and he,  too, will reach Zillenstein."    
"Tell Mademoiselle Julie that her brother did not come to the appointed  meeting at Chastel, because he was wounded. Not badly. Don't be alarmed,  Suzanne. He'll be as well as ever soon."    
"Then he, too, will come to Zillenstein. You are not the only one who  seeks, Monsieur Scott."    
"But I am the first to arrive. Nothing can take that from me."    
"It is true. Now I must hasten back to the castle. If I stay longer they  will suspect me."    
She slipped from the shrubbery and was gone, and, John, afire with new  emotions, strolled in a wide circuit back to the stables.    
A week went by. Twice every day he saw Julie on the terrace, but no word  passed between them, the chance never came. But the hosts of the air  were at work. The invisible currents were passing between the girl on  the terrace who was treated like a princess and the young peasant who  walked the horses in the road.    
"Be not afraid. I have a strength more than my own to save you," came on  a wave of air.    
"I fear not for myself, only for you lest they discover you," came the  answering wave.    
"I love you. You are the most beautiful woman in the world and the  bravest. It's cause for pride to risk death for you."    
"I know that you are here for me. I knew that you would come, when I saw  you in Metz. I know that under your peasant's garb you are a prince,  more of a real prince than any Auersperg that ever lived."    
John was outside of himself. He felt sometimes as if he had left his  body behind. The spirit of the crusader was still upon him, and in sight  of his beloved, the prize that he had reached but not yet won, he cast  aside all thought of danger or failure and awaited the event, whatever  it might be, with the supreme confidence of youth. It is but truth to  say that he was happy in those days, filled with a stolen delight, all  the sweeter because it was stolen under the very eyes of the medieval  baron, lord almost of life and death, who was master there.    
He steadily advanced in the good graces of Walther. No other such  industrious and skillful groom had appeared at Zillenstein in many a  day, and he rapidly acquired dexterity also with the automobiles. None  could send them spinning with more certainty along the curving mountain  roads. He practiced with diligence because he had a vague premonition  that all this knowledge would be of use to him some day.    
Pappenheim went away, but returned after four days. John fancied that he  had been in Vienna, but he knew the magnet that had brought him back. He  saw the young Austrian's eyes flame more than once when Julie appeared  in her favorite place on the terrace. And yet John neither hated nor  feared him.    
Kratzek was well enough to go back to the battle front, but he lingered.  John did not know what excuses he gave, but he was there, and his eyes,  too, burned when Julie passed.    
Often in the evening he watched for the grim Suzanne and the word that  she would bring, but she did not come. Day by day he saw her, the long  black shadow behind her mistress, but she never looked toward him,  however intensely he wished it.    
The prince went forth occasionally, but he always used an automobile and  he was never gone longer than a day. John wondered why he remained so  long at Zillenstein, knowing that he was a general in the German army  and a man of weight at the battle front. He concluded at last that he  must be waiting there for a conference of some kind between important  men of Germany and Austria. He had heard through the gossip in the  castle that Italy was threatening war on Austria, and the Teutonic  powers must now face also toward the southwest. Much might be decided at  Zillenstein.    
Ilse and Olga were still his best sources of information. Very little  that passed in the castle missed their shrewd inquiring minds, and they  had found in the handsome young peasant from Lorraine one with whom they  liked to talk. He jested and laughed with them but there was a certain  reserve on his part that they could not break down but which drew them  on. He would not flirt with them. None was readier than he for light  words and airy compliments, but nothing that he said permitted either of  the trim young Austrian girls to think that he might become a lover.    
"I think, Herr Johann," said Ilse, "that you have left behind in  Lorraine a maid whom you love."    
"It may be so," said John vaguely. "I saw one in Metz whom anybody could  love."    
"What was she like?" asked Ilse, eagerly.    
"A skin the tint of the young rose, eyes like the dawn on a summer  morning, hair a shower of the finest spun silk, and a walk like that of  a young goddess."    
"It's beautiful, but it doesn't describe; what was the color of her hair  and eyes?"    
"I don't know. They dazzled me so much that I merely remember their  loveliness and glory."    
"It can't be!" exclaimed Ilse, who did not walk in Elysian paths. "You  jest with us. You recall her hair and eyes."    
John shook his head impressively.    
"The French prisoner, the one they call a spy, Mademoiselle Lannes, is  the most beautiful woman I've ever seen," said blond Olga, "but no one  could look at her without remembering the color of her hair and eyes,  such a marvelous gold and such a deep, dark blue."    
"His Highness, Prince Karl, remembers them well," said Ilse.    
"But not better than the young Count Kratzek," said Olga.    
"Nor better than Count Pappenheim."    
"And yet they're going to send her away."    
"It's because the generals and princes are coming for the great council  and they wouldn't have more to fall in love with her."    
"And it might give even Prince Karl trouble to answer questions why she  is here."    
John's pulses began to beat heavily despite all his efforts at calmness  and he turned his face away that they might not see the eager light in  his eyes. When he had mastered himself sufficiently to use a quiet voice  he asked:    
"When is this great council of which you speak?"    
"In three or four days," replied Ilse. "We hear that many Serene  Highnesses are coming from both Berlin and Vienna."    
"And the French girl is to be carried away before they come?"    
"She goes the day after tomorrow with the dark woman, Suzanne, to the  hunting lodge of His Highness, higher in the mountains."    
Then with a frightened gesture she clapped her hand upon her mouth.    
"You will say nothing of it, Herr Johann?" she pleaded. "It is a secret  from all but a few, and His Highness doubtless would punish us terribly  if he knew that we told."    
"You can trust me, Ilse," said John earnestly. "I would not bring  trouble upon you or Olga. Besides, what is it to me?"    
He sought by indirect questions to learn more from them, but they would  not continue, seeming to be afraid that they had already said too much.  Then he turned casually from the subject, lest he rouse suspicion, and  spoke of his horses. But all the while he was searching his mind, as one  looks for a treasure, to discover how he could follow Julie and Suzanne  to their new abode.    
He gathered from Walther that the hunting lodge was higher in the  mountains in the depths of a great forest, about six leagues from  Zillenstein where there was much big game. In times of peace the prince  frequently went there, and a good automobile road led to the lodge,  although in winter the snow was often so deep that the place was  inaccessible.    
Late that afternoon the hoofs of horses beat steadily on the road  leading from the valley up to Zillenstein. John from a coign of vantage  saw approaching a young man in a gray German uniform, followed by four  hussars, also in German gray. Anyone who came to Zillenstein was of  interest, and as John looked the leading figure became familiar. Doubt  soon changed to certainty. He knew the swing of the broad shoulders and  the high pose of the head. It was the young prince, von Arnheim.    
"And so they all gather," said John to himself.    
He was swept by the little shiver that one often feels when influenced  suddenly by a powerful emotion. Fate or chance had a wonderful way of  bringing about strange things. He had seen it too often not to know. He  was sure in his heart now that von Boehlen too would come some time and  somehow.    
He looked at the terrace. Julie and Suzanne had appeared there in the  last few minutes, and they were gazing at the gallant figure of young  von Arnheim who was now so near. The prince himself, when he saw Julie,  sprang from his horse, ran lightly up the steps, and bending low over  her hand, kissed it. Nor did John feel jealousy or hate of him.    
He was glad that von Arnheim had come. He was sure that Julie did not  love him and never would, but he was a brave and honest man who would do  no wrong. Julie was safer from insult with him near. To the rank of  Prince Karl of Auersperg he could oppose a rank the equal of his own.    
He was too far away to hear their words or even to note their faces, but  he saw the young prince talk with her for a little space and then go  into the castle, doubtless to notify Auersperg of his arrival. Julie as  her eyes roved about the great panorama of mountain and valley saw John,  and the wireless messages of their eyes passed and repassed again.    
"I know that you are watching and risking your life for me," hers said.    
"Gladly," his replied.    
"I like Prince Wilhelm von Arnheim, but it's liking, not love."    
"I wish to believe it and do."    
Then the little waves of air were stilled, as she went back into the  castle, doubtless because she feared to arouse suspicion, and John  returned to his work with Walther, convinced that he must form some plan  now. Von Arnheim must merely be the vanguard of the council, and Julie  might be sent away earlier than Ilse had announced. He must contrive a  way to follow.    
That night he lurked once more in the shrubbery. He had been there  nearly every night, hopeful that Suzanne would pass again, but not until  tonight did she come. The tall figure, swathed almost to the eyes in a  heavy cloak, came down the terrace to the walk, and John whistled low a  note of a French folksong. He had merely hoped that she would stop a  moment or two to listen, and the little device succeeded. She paused and  looked at the black mass of the shrubbery.    
"Suzanne! Suzanne!" called John, his voice showing all the intenseness  of his anxiety.    
"Monsieur Scott," she said in a loud whisper.    
"Yes, Suzanne, here behind the bushes! I must have word with you!"    
Silently she stepped into the impenetrable shadows and John eagerly  seized her hand.    
"Your mistress, Mademoiselle Julie," he whispered eagerly, "she does not  break down with the suspense and anxiety? She still hopes?"    
"You need not fear for her courage, Monsieur Scott. Did I not tell you  that she had a heart of steel, even the same as that of her great  brother. I should not tell it to you, but she has never despaired since  you came."    
John's fingers closed convulsively upon the large muscular hand of  Suzanne and in the darkness the woman's grim face relaxed into a smile.    
"You are holding my hand not that of Mademoiselle Julie," she said.    
"Your words bring me such joy, Suzanne, that I forgot, but I must speak  to your mistress."    
"You cannot. It is impossible. She is watched more closely than ever."    
"But there is news that she must know! Then you must tell it to her!"    
"What news? You surely don't mean that they will try her on this  ridiculous charge of being a spy!"    
"No, not that, Suzanne, but they're preparing to send her and you away."    
"And glad we both will be to leave this hateful castle of Zillenstein."    
"But it's not that you will fare better. There will be no chance of  freedom now. You are to be sent into the higher mountains in the  wilderness to a hunting lodge belonging to Auersperg. You will be hidden  from all but a few of his most trusted followers."    
"Then we're not afraid. We shall even be glad to go there, anywhere from  this terrible place. We do not fear the woods, my mistress and I. I can  think they're more friendly than those old stone walls above us."    
"But tell her this, Suzanne, I pray you, that I shall follow her there."    
"How?"    
"I don't yet know, but I shall find a way. Tell her, Suzanne, that I'll  never leave her so long as I'm alive."    
The eyes of the grim woman softened singularly, as she gazed in the dusk  at the young man. A devotion such as his, a devotion so evident, would  have moved a heart of stone. Her young mistress was dearer than anyone  else in the world to her, dearer than her own father, and her stern  spirit relaxed when she saw that another could love her in a different  way, but as well.    
"I'll tell her," she said, "but I tell you that 'tis needless. She knows  already that wherever she goes you will follow. Does that bring any  comfort to your soul, Mr. Scott?"    
"Aye, Suzanne, it fills it with thankfulness. Don't forget to tell her  that she will go soon. Von Arnheim, Pappenheim and Kratzek are her  friends, but they can't prevent it if they would. It may be too that  they will not know when or where she goes."    
"She shall hear everything you say and, remember, that she has a brave  heart. She has less fear for herself than for you."    
She slipped away in the darkness and John went back to his own little  place over the stables where he passed a night that was all but  sleepless thinking over his problem and finding no good solution. He  meant to follow Julie and Suzanne in any event to the hunting lodge, but  it was not sufficient merely to follow. He must appear in some capacity  that would permit him to be of service. And yet Providence was working  for him at that moment.    
Prince Karl of Auersperg in his magnificent modernized apartments in the  huge castle was also troubled by an inability to sleep. Hitherto in his  fifty or more years of life he had always got what he wanted. His blood  was more ancient than that of either Hohenzollern or Hapsburg. The  Auerspergs had been princes of the Holy Roman Empire for a thousand  years and now he was a prince of both Teutonic empires and a general of  the first rank in the army of Germany. His wealth was so vast that he  scarcely knew the extent of his own lands and here in Zillenstein he  could maintain the power and state that appertained to a baron of the  Middle Ages.    
A mind that has only to wish for a thing to get it becomes closed in  fifty years. It mistakes desire for right. It regards opposition as  sacrilege. Other minds that differ from it are wicked because they  differ. The thick armor of Prince Karl's self-complacency had been  pierced as it were by a tiny needle that stung, however tiny, as if its  point were laden with poison.    
He, the omniscient and omnipotent, had been defied and by whom? A mere  slip of a girl! A child! She was not even of his own race! But perhaps  it was this very defiance that made him wish for her all the more. He  loved her as he had never loved that long-dead wife, a plain princess  who always thought what she was told to think.    
But he would take Julie in all honor as his wife. He could not make her  a princess but he could make her a countess, and he would clothe her in  a golden shower. There had been hundreds of morganatic marriages. They  implied no disgrace. Noblewomen themselves had been glad to make them.  And yet she had refused. Nothing could move her. She had not even  flinched a particle when he had threatened her otherwise with death as a  spy, although the threat was merely words on his lips and had no abiding  place in his heart. She was most beautiful then, when the defiant fire  flashed in her dark blue eyes and the sunshine coming through a tall  stained glass window made deep red tints in her wonderful golden hair.  It was maddening to think of her, just a child turning into a woman, and  wholly in his power defying him as if he were some humble lieutenant and  not the mighty Prince Karl of Auersperg.    
He rose and walked angrily back and forth. Now and then he went to a  window and looked out at the dusky panorama of valley, mountain and  shaggy forest. As far as he could see and farther it was all his and  yet he was powerless in the matter that now concerned him more than all  others. She was his prisoner, and yet she was as free as air. Her soul  and her heart were her own, and he could not reach either. He knew it.  That knowledge like the little poisoned needle had punctured the  triple-plate of his complacency and pride and left him no relief from  pain, a pain that would have become intolerable had he known that of all  the bars that stood between her and him the one that nothing could move  was a young peasant in his employ, who watered and fed horses, and who  often led them up and down the road within his plain view.    
And yet knowing what he did, knowing that she would not marry him, he  had no thought to give her up. Hope will often spring anew in the face  of absolute knowledge itself, and deep in his heart a belief would  appear now and then that he might yet break her to his wish. He knew  that von Arnheim, Pappenheim and Kratzek knelt at the same shrine and he  laughed harshly to himself because he was sure that they knelt in vain.  They were young, handsome, attractive, men of the world, men whom any  girl might love but she did not love any of them. He knew the signals,  and Julie certainly hung out none for von Arnheim, nor for Kratzek nor  for Pappenheim.    
He ran his fingers through his great brown forked beard, just such a  beard as many a robber baron might have worn, and thought deeply of what  he should do with her, before the great council of princes and generals  assembled in his castle. She must not be there then. Awkward questions  might be asked, but if she were well hidden no trouble could befall. Von  Arnheim or Kratzek or Pappenheim might speak, but any words of his would  outweigh all of theirs and that term of a spy was wonderfully  convenient.    
But he wished only himself to know where Julie had gone. He wanted no  tattle and gossip about the castle and where there were so many servants  and followers it could not be prevented unless they were kept in  ignorance. It would be best to use a stranger, one who was known but  little at Zillenstein, and he recalled such a man. Second thought  confirmed first thought and his decision was made.
