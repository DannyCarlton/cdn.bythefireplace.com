  &quot;I owe the safety of my money to you, my brave boy,&quot; said Mr.  Carroll,  the next morning, as, after rising, he replaced the package  of bank  notes in his carpet-bag. 
  &quot;I only did my duty,&quot; said Herbert, but his face flushed with  pleasure  at the commendations bestowed upon him. 
  &quot;But in doing your duty, you displayed a courage and fidelity rare  in  one of your age.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you approve of my conduct,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;If you continue to deserve as well of those who employ you, I am  sure  you will achieve success.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope so, sir,&quot; said our hero. &quot;I shall try to do my duty in  whatever  situation in life I may be placed.&quot; 
  &quot;What are your plans when you reach New York?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall try to find a place in a store, or counting-room.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you friends in the city on whose influence you can rely to  help  you to such a situation as you desire?&quot; &quot;No, sir; I have only  myself to  look to.&quot; 
  &quot;Only yourself! It is a bold undertaking.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't you think I shall succeed?&quot; asked Herbert, a little  anxiously. 
  &quot;I do not doubt that you will succeed, after finding a place, but  that  is the difficulty.&quot; 
  &quot;I supposed there must be plenty to do in a great city like New  York.&quot; 
  &quot;There is truth in what you say, but, nevertheless, many are led  astray  by it. There is, indeed, a great deal to do, but there are a  great many  ready to do it, and generally&#8212;I may say, always&#8212;the  laborers exceed  the work to be done.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;many fail to get work, because they are   particular what they do. If I can find nothing better to do, I will   black boots.&quot; 
  &quot;With such a spirit, I think you will succeed. But, perhaps, I can   smooth away some of the difficulties in your path. I know a firm in  New  York&#8212;connections of our family&#8212;to whom I will give you a letter  of  introduction. If they have no room for you in their house, they may   influence someone else to take you.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall feel very much obliged to you for such a letter. It will  do me  a great deal of good,&quot; said Herbert, gratefully. 
  &quot;I will gladly write it, but now let us go down to breakfast.&quot; 
  After breakfast was over, they looked in upon the wounded man. 
  &quot;How do you feel this morning?&quot; asked Herbert, going up to the  bedside. 
  &quot;Rather stiff, but I am not in such pain as I was.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad to hear it.&quot; 
  &quot;That is the gentleman I was going to rob?&quot; said the burglar,  looking in  the direction of Mr. Carroll. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Is he&#8212;did you say anything to him about not prosecuting me?&quot; he  asked,  nervously. 
  &quot;Be under no apprehension,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, mildly. &quot;I do not  care to  punish you more than you have already been punished. I prefer  that you  should lead a better life.&quot; 
  &quot;I will try to do so. sir; but I was poor, and that made the  temptation  stronger.&quot; 
  &quot;I can easily believe it. Are you wholly without means?&quot; 
  &quot;Nearly so.&quot; 
  &quot;Here, then, is a purse containing a hundred dollars. It will  probably  pay your expenses during your illness.&quot; 
  The wounded man looked up in surprise. 
  &quot;There ain't many that would pay a man for trying to rob them,&quot; he  said. 
  &quot;I do not pay you for that,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, &quot;but because I do  not  wish you to be subjected to a similar temptation again.&quot; 
  The wounded man, who, under different treatment would have been  defiant  and profane, seemed quite subdued by such unexpected kindness. 
  &quot;Well, sir,&quot; he said. &quot;all I can say is, that I am very much  obliged to  you, and I hope you will be rewarded for your kindness.&quot; 
  &quot;It is easier to lead men than to drive them,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, as  they  left the chamber. &quot;This man is rough, and not troubled much with  a  conscience, but harshness would make him still worse.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Herbert; &quot;I think you are right.&quot; 
  After breakfast they resumed their journey. In due time they  reached  Baltimore, and remained over night at a hotel. In the course  of the  succeeding day they arrived at Philadelphia, which was the  termination  of Mr. Carroll's journey. As the country through which  they passed was  unknown to Herbert, the journey was full of interest,  but there was no  adventure worth recording. 
  The time came when the two travelers were compelled to part. 
  &quot;If I were going to a hotel, Herbert,&quot; said Mr. Carroll, &quot;I would  invite  you to remain with me a day or two; but I shall proceed at once  to the  house of a friend, and I shall not feel at liberty to invite  you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I think it will be best for me to  go on  to New York at once. I have got my living to make, and I am  anxious to  get to work as soon as possible.&quot; 
  &quot;It is a praiseworthy feeling,&quot; said the old gentleman. &quot;Life lies   before you. I have left nearly the whole of it behind me. I am drawing   near the end of my journey. You are just at the beginning. I shall  hope  to meet you again, but, if not, be assured that I shall always  remember,  with pleasure, my young traveling companion.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;I shall not soon forget the essential service which you have  rendered  me,&quot; continued the old gentleman. 
  &quot;Don't think of it, sir,&quot; said Herbert, modestly, &quot;Anyone would  have  done the same thing in my place.&quot; 
  &quot;I am by no means sure of that. At any rate, the obligation  remains. You  must allow me to acknowledge it in some measure.&quot; 
  Mr. Carroll drew out his pocketbook and handed it to Herbert. 
  &quot;Will you oblige me,&quot; he said, &quot;by counting the bills in this   pocketbook?&quot; 
  Herbert did so. 
  &quot;There are sixty-five dollars,&quot; he said, passing it back. 
  &quot;Will you take out fifty dollars?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir&#8212;I have done it.&quot; 
  &quot;That's the sum you will oblige me by keeping,&quot; said Mr. Carroll.  &quot;I  hope it may be of service to you.&quot; 
  &quot;You give me so much money?&quot; said Herbert, in surprise. 
  &quot;It is but a very small sum, compared with that which you have  saved  me.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I ought to take so much,&quot; said Herbert, hesitating. 
  &quot;You need not hesitate, my young friend. I am blessed with abundant   means, and very well able to part with it. Besides, it is only one per   cent. of the money which you have been instrumental in saving me, and   you are certainly entitled to as much as that.&quot; 
  &quot;I thank you very much for the gift, Mr. Carroll,&quot; said our hero,  &quot;and  still more for the kind manner in which you give it to me.&quot; 
  &quot;You accept it, then? That is well,&quot; said the old gentleman, with   satisfaction. &quot;There is one thing more. You remember that I spoke to  you  of a business firm in Pearl Street, New York, with the members of  which  I am acquainted. Last evening I prepared a letter of  introduction to  them for you. Here it is.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I was very fortunate in meeting  with  one so able and willing to assist me.&quot; 
  &quot;You are very welcome to all the help I am able to give you. I  shall be  very glad if your life shall be as prosperous as mine has  been. I must  trouble you to do me one more service. If you will find  me a cab, I will  go at once to my friend's house.&quot; 
  No difficulty was experienced in obtaining a carriage. There was a   cordial leave-taking, and Herbert once more found himself alone. But   with rather more than sixty dollars in his pocket, he felt rich, and   looked forward eagerly to his arrival in the great city, where he  hoped  to deserve and win success.
