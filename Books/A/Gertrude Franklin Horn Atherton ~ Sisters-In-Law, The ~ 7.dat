Gora Dwight with a quick turn of a strong and supple wrist flung a folding  chair up through the trap door of the roof. She followed with a pitcher of  water, opened the chair, and sat down.    
It was the second day of the fire, which was now raging in the valleys  north of Market Street and up the hills. It was still some distance from  all but the lower end of Van Ness Avenue, the wide street that divides the  eastern and western sections of the city, as Market Street divides the  northern and southern, and her own home on Geary Street was beyond Franklin  and safe for the present. It was expected that the fire would be halted  by dynamiting the blocks east of the avenue, but as it had already leapt  across not far from Market Street and was running out toward the Mission,  Gora pinned her faith in nothing less than a change of wind.    
Life has many disparate schools. The one attended by Miss Gora Dwight had  taught her to hope for the best, prepare for the worst, and be thankful  if she escaped (to use the homely phrase; one rarely found leisure for  originality in this particular school) by the skin of her teeth.    
Gora fully expected to lose the house she sat on, and had packed what few  valuables she possessed in two large bags: the fine underclothes she had  made at odd moments, and a handsome set of toilet articles her brother had  given her on the Christmas before last. He had had a raise of salary and  her experiment with lodgers had proved even more successful than she had  dared to hope. On the following Christmas he had given her a large book  with a fancy binding (which she had exchanged for something she could  read). After satisfying the requirements of a wardrobe suitable for the  world of fashion, supplemented by the usual toll of flowers and bon-bons,  he had little surplus for domestic presents.    
Gora's craving for drama was far deeper and more significant than young  Alexina Groome's, and she determined to watch until the last moment the  terrific spectacle of the burning city. The wind had carried the smoke  upward for a mile or more and pillars of fire supported it at such  irregular intervals that it looked like a vast infernal temple in which  demons were waging war, and undermining the roof in their senseless fury.    
In some places whole blocks of houses were blazing; here and there high  buildings burned in solitary grandeur, the flames leaping from every window  or boiling from the roof. Sometimes one of these buildings would disappear  in a shower of sparks and an awful roar, or a row of humbler houses was  lifted bodily from the ground to burst into a thousand particles of flying  wood, and disappear.    
The heat was overpowering (she bathed her face constantly from the pitcher)  and the roar of the flames, the constant explosions of dynamite, the loud  vicious crackling of wood, the rending and splitting of masonry, the hoarse  impact of walls as they met the earth, was the scene's wild orchestral  accompaniment and, despite underlying apprehension and horror, gave Gora  one of the few pleasurable sensations of her life.    
But she moved her chair after a moment and fixed her gaze, no longer rapt  but ironic, on the flaming hillcrests, the long line of California Street,  nucleus of the wealth and fashion of San Francisco. The Western Addition  was fashionable and growing more so, but it had been too far away for the  pioneers of the fifties and sixties, the bonanza kings of the seventies,  the railroad magnates of the eighties, and they had built their huge and  hideous mansions upon the hill that rose almost perpendicularly above the  section where they made and lost their millions. Some wag or toady had  named it Nob Hill and the inhabitants had complacently accepted the title,  although they refrained from putting it on their cards. And now it was in  flames.    
<b>II</b>    
Gora recalled the day when she had walked slowly past those mansions,  staring at each in turn as she assimilated the disheartening and  infuriating fact that she and the children that inhabited them belonged to  different worlds.    
Her family at that time lived in a cottage at the wrong end of Taylor  Street Hill, and, Mrs. Dwight having received a small legacy from a sister  recently deceased which had convinced her, if not her less mercurial  husband, that their luck had finally turned, had sent Gora, then a rangy  girl of thirteen, fond of books and study, to a large private school in the  fashionable district.    
Gora, after all these years, ground her teeth as she had a sudden blighting  vision of the day a week later, when, puzzled and resentful, she had walked  up the steep hill with several of the girls whose homes were on California  and Taylor Streets, and two of whom, like herself, were munching an apple.    
They had hardly noticed her sufficiently to ignore her, either then or  during the previous week, so absorbed were they in their own close common  interests. She listened to allusions which she barely could comprehend, but  it was evident that one was to give a party on Friday night and the others  were expected as a matter of course. Gora assumed that Jim and Sam and Rex  and Bob were brothers or beaux. Last names appeared to be no more necessary  than labels to inform the outsider of the social status of these favored  maidens, too happy and contented to be snobs but quite callous to the  feelings of strange little girls.    
They drifted one by one into their opulent homes, bidding one another a  careless or a sentimental good-by, and Gora, throwing her head as far back  on her shoulders as it would go without dislocation, stalked down to the  unfashionable end of Taylor Street and up to the solitude of her bedroom  under the eaves of the cottage.    
On the following day she had lingered in the school yard until the other  girls were out of sight, then climbing the almost perpendicular hill so  rapidly that she arrived on the crest with little breath and a pain in her  side, she had sauntered deliberately up and down before the imposing homes  of her schoolmates, staring at them with angry and puzzled eyes, her young  soul in tumult. It was the old inarticulate cry of class, of the unchosen  who seeks the reason and can find none.    
<b>III</b>    
As she had a tendency not only to brood but to work out her own problems it  was several days before she demanded an explanation of her mother.    
Mrs. Dwight, a prematurely gray and wrinkled woman, who had once  been handsome with good features and bright coloring, and who wore a  deliberately cheerful expression that Gora often wanted to wipe off, was  sitting in the dining-room making a skirt for her daughter; which, Gora  reflected bitterly, was sure to be too long on one side if not in front.    
Mrs. Dwight's smile faded as she looked at the somber face and huddled  figure in the worn leather arm-chair in which Mr. Dwight spent his silent  evenings.    
"Why, my dear, you surely knew long before this that some people are rich  and others poor--to say nothing of the betwixts and betweens." She was an  exact woman in small matters. "That's all there is to it. I thought it a  good idea to send you to a private school where you might make friends  among girls of your own class."    
"Own class? They treat me like dirt. How am I of their class when they live  in palaces and I in a hovel?"    
"I have reproved you many times for exaggerated speech. What I meant was  that you are as well-born as any of them (better than many) only we have  been unfortunate. Your father tried hard enough, but he just doesn't seem  to have the money-making faculty like so many men. Now, we've had a little  luck I'm really hopeful. I've just had a nice letter from your Aunt Eliza  Goring--I named you for her, but I couldn't inflict you with Eliza. You  know she is many years older than I am and has no children. She was out  here once just before you were born. We--we were very hard up indeed. It  was she who furnished this cottage for us and paid a year's rent. Soon  after, your father got his present position and we have managed to  get along. She always sends me a little cheque at Christmas and I am  sure--well, there are some things we don't say....But this legacy from your  Aunt Jane is the only real stroke of luck we ever had, and I can't help  feeling hopeful. I do believe better times are coming....It used to seem  terribly hard and unjust that so many people all about us had so much and  we nothing, and that in this comparatively small city we knew practically  no one. But I have got over being bitter and envious. You do when you are  busy every minute. And then we have the blessing of health, and Mortimer is  the best boy in the world, and you are a very good child when you are not  in a bad temper. I think you will be handsome, too, although you are pretty  hopeless at present; but of course you will never have anything like  Mortimer's looks. He is the living image of the painting of your  Great-great-great-grandfather Dwight that used to hang in the dining-room  in Utica, and who was in the first Congress. Now, do try and make friends  with the nicer of the children."    
But Gora's was not a conciliating nor a compromising nature. Her idea  of "squaring things" was to become the best scholar in her classes and  humiliate several young ladies of her own age who had held the first  position with an ease that had bred laxity. Greatly to the satisfaction  of the teachers an angry emulation ensued with the gratifying result that  although the girls could not pass Gora, their weekly marks were higher, and  for the rest of the term they did less giggling even after school hours,  and more studying.    
But Gora would not return for a second term. She had made no friends among  the girls, although, no doubt, having won their respect, they would, with  the democracy of childhood, have admitted her to intimacy by degrees,  particularly if she had proved to be socially malleable.    
But for some obscure reason it made Gora happier to hate them all, and when  she had passed her examinations victoriously, and taken every prize, except  for tidiness and deportment, she said good-by with some regret to the  teachers, who had admired and encouraged her but did not pretend to love  her, and announced as soon as she arrived at home that she should enter the  High School at the beginning of the following term.    
<b>IV</b>    
Her parents were secretly relieved. Even Mrs. Dwight's vision of future  prosperity had faded. She had been justified in believing that her sister  Eliza would make a will in favor of her family, but unfortunately Mrs.  Goring had amused herself with speculation in her old age, and had left  barely enough to pay her funeral expenses.    
Mrs. Dwight broached the subject of their immediate future to her husband  that evening. She had some time since made up her mind, in case the school  experiment was not a success, to furnish a larger house with what remained  of the legacy, and take boarders.    
"I wouldn't do it if Gora had made the friends I hoped for her," she said,  turning the heel of the first of her son's winter socks, "and there's no  such thing as a social come-down for us; for that matter, there is more  than one lady, once wealthy, who is keeping a boarding-house in this town.  Gora will have to work anyhow, and as for Mortimer--" she glanced fondly at  her manly young son, who was amiably playing checkers in the parlor with  his sister, "he is sure to make his fortune."    
"I don't know," said Mr. Dwight heavily. "I don't know."    
"Why, what do you mean?" asked his wife sharply.    
Mrs. Dwight belonged to that type of American women whose passions in youth  are weak and anaemic, not to say exceedingly shame-faced, but which in  mature years become strong and selfish and jealous, either for a lover or a  son. Mrs. Dwight, being a perfectly respectable woman, had centered all the  accumulated forces of her being on the son whom she idealized after the  fashion of her type; and as she had corrected his obvious faults when he  was a boy, it was quite true that he was kind, amiable, honest, honorable,  patriotic, industrious, clean, polite, and moral; if hardly as handsome as  Apollo or as brilliant and gifted as she permitted herself to believe.    
"What do you mean?" she repeated, although she lowered her voice. It was  rarely that it assumed an edge when addressing her husband. She had never  reproached him for being a failure, for she had recognized his limitations  early and accepted her lot. But something in his tone shook her maternal  complacence and roused her to instant defense.    
Mr. Dwight took his pipe from his mouth and also cast a glance toward the  parlor, but the absorbed players were beyond the range of his rather weak  voice.    
"I mean this," he said with nothing of his usual vague hesitancy of speech.  "I'm not so sure that Morty is beyond clerk size."    
"You--you--John Dwight--your son--" The thin layer of pale flesh on  Mrs. Dwight's face seemed to collapse upon its harsh framework with the  terrified wrath that shook her. Her mouth fell apart, and hot smarting  tears welled slowly to her eyes, faded with long years of stitching; not  only for her own family but for many others when money had been more than  commonly scarce. "Mortimer can do anything. Anything."    
"Can he?" Why doesn't he show it then? He went to work at sixteen and is  now twenty-two. He is drawing just fifty dollars a month. He's well liked  in the firm, too."    
"Why don't they raise his salary?"    
"Because that's all he's worth to them. He's a good steady honest clerk,  nothing more."    
"He's very young--"    
"If a man has initiative, ability, any sort of constructive power in his  brain he shows it by the time he is twenty-two--if he has been in that  forcing house for four or five years. That is the whole history of this  country. And employers are always on the look-out for those qualities  and only too anxious to find them and push a young man on and up. Many  a president of a great business started life as a clerk, or even office  boy--"    
"That is what I have always known would happen to Morty. I am sure, sure,  that you are doing him a cruel injustice."    
"I hope I am. But I am a failure myself and I know what a man needs in the  way of natural equipment to make a success of his life."    
"But he is so energetic and industrious and honorable and likable and--"    
"I was all that."    
"Then--" Mrs. Dwight's voice trailed off; it sounded flat and old. "What do  you both lack?"    
"Brains."    
<b>V</b>    
Mrs. Dwight had repeated this conversation to Gora shortly before her  death, and the girl in her reminiscent mood recalled it as she stared with  somber eyes and ironic lips at the havoc the fire was playing with those  lofty mansions which had stood to her all these intervening years as  symbols of the unpardonable injustice of class.    
She recalled another of the few occasions when Mrs. Dwight, who believed  in acceptance and contentment, had been persuaded to discuss the  idiosyncrasies of her adopted city.    
"It isn't that money is the standard here as it is in New York. Of course  there is a very wealthy set these late years and they set a pace that makes  it difficult for the older families, like the Groomes for instance--I met  Mrs. Groome once at a summer resort where I was housekeeper that year, and  I thought her very typical and interesting. She was so kind to me without  seeing me at all....But those fine old families, who are all of good old  Eastern or Southern stock--if they manage to keep in society are still the  most influential element in it....Family....Having lived in California long  enough to be one of that old set....To be, without question, one of them.  That is all that matters. I've come in contact with a good many of them  first and last in my poor efforts to help your father, and I believe the  San Franciscans to be the most loyal and disinterested people in the  world-to one another.    
"But if you come in from the outside you must bring money, or tremendous  family prestige, or the right kind of social personality with the best  kind of letters. We just crept in and were glad to be permitted to make a  living. Why should they have taken any notice of us? They don't go hunting  about for obscure people of possibly gentle blood. That doesn't happen  anywhere in the world. You must be reasonable, my dear child. That is life,  'The World.'"    
But Gora was not gifted with that form of reasonableness. She had wished in  her darker moments that she had been born outright in the working-class;  then, no doubt, she would have trudged contentedly every morning (except  when on strike) to the factory or shop, or been some one's cook. She was an  excellent cook. What galled her was the fact of virtually belonging to the  same class as these people who were still unaware of the existence of her  family, although it had lived for over thirty years in a city numbering  to-day only half a million inhabitants.    
She was almost fanatically democratic and could see no reason for  differences of degree in the aspiring classes. To her mind the only line of  cleavage between the classes was that which divided people of education,  refinement of mind manners and habits, certain inherited traditions, and  the mental effort no matter how small to win a place in this difficult  world, from commonness, ignorance, indifference to dirt, coarse pleasures.  and habits, and manual labor. She respected Labor as the solid foundation  stones upon which civilization upheld itself, and believed it to have been  biologically chosen; if she had been born in its class she would have had  the ambition to work her way out of it, but without resentment.    
There her recognition of class stopped. That wealth or family prominence  even in a great city or an old community should create an exclusive and  favored society seemed to her illogical and outrageous. A woman was a lady  or she wasn't. A man was a gentleman or he wasn't. That should be the  beginning and the end of the social code....When she had been younger  she had lamented her mean position because it excluded her from the  light-hearted and brilliant pleasures of youth; but as she grew older  this natural craving had given place to a far deeper and more corrosive  resentment.    
She had no patience with her brother's ingenuous snobbery. A good-natured  friend had introduced him to one or two houses where there were young  people and much dancing and he had been "taken up." Nothing would have  filled Gora with such murderous rage as to be taken up. She wanted her  position conceded as a natural right.    
Had it been in her power she would have forced her conception of democracy  upon the entire United States. But as this was quite impossible she longed  passionately for some power, personal and irresistible, that would compel  the attention of the elect in the city of her birth and ultimately bring  them to her feet. And here she had a ray of hope.    
<b>VI</b>    
Meanwhile it was some satisfaction to watch them being burned out of house  and home.    
Then she gave a short impatient sigh that was almost a groan, as she  wondered if her own home would go. The family had moved into it eight years  ago; and after Mr. Dwight's death his widow had barely made a living for  herself and her daughter out of the uncertain boarders. Mortimer had paid  his share, but she had encouraged him to dress well and no one knew the  value of "front" better than he. After her death, three years ago, Gora had  turned out the boarders and the last slatternly wasteful cook and let her  rooms to business women who made their morning coffee over the gas jet.  The new arrangement paid very well and left her time for lectures at the  University of California, and for other studies. A Jap came in daily to put  the rooms in order and she cooked for herself and her brother. So unknown  was she that even Aileen Lawton was unaware that the "boarding-house down  on Geary Street" was a lodging house kept by Mortimer Dwight's sister.  Fortunately Gora was spared one more quivering arrow in her pride.
