  One afternoon, in the beginning of the mush-snow, a long team of   rakish Malemutes, driven by an Athabasca French-Canadian, raced wildly   into the clearing about the post. A series of yells, and the wild   cracking of a thirty-foot caribou-gut whip, announced that the big   change was at hand&#8212;that the wilderness was awakening, and life was   drawing near. 
  The entire post rushed out to meet the new-comer&#8212;men and dogs, the   little black-and-tan children, and even Williams' fat and lethargic   wife. For a few moments there was a scene of wild disorder, of   fighting Malemutes buried under a rush of angry huskies, while men   shouted, and the yelling Frenchman leaped about and cut his caribou-   gut in vicious slashes over the wolfish horde around his heavily laden   sledge. 
  Partial order being restored, Mukee and Per-ee took charge of the   snarling Malemutes, and, surrounded by Williams' men, the trapper   stalked to the company's office. He was Jean de Gravois, the most   important man in the Fond du Lac country, for whose good-will the   company paid a small bonus. That he had made a record catch even the   children knew by the size of the packs on his sledge and by the   swagger in his walk. 
  Gravois was usually one of the last to appear at the annual  gathering  of the wilderness fur-gatherers. He was a big man in  reputation, as he  was small in stature. He was known as far west as  the Peace River, and  eastward to Fort Churchill. He loved to make his  appearance at the  post in a wild and picturesque rush when the rest of  the forest rovers  were there to look on, and to envy or admire. He was  one of the few of  his kind who had developed personal vanity along  with unerring cunning  in the ways of the wild. Everybody liked  Gravois, for he had a big  soul in him and was as fearless as a lynx;  and he liked everybody,  including himself. 
  He explained his early arrival by announcing in a nonchalant manner   that after he had given his Malemutes a day's rest he was going on to   Fort Churchill, to bring back a wife. He hinted, with a punctuating   crack of his whip, that he would make a second visit, and a more   interesting one, at just about the time when the trappers were there   in force. 
  Jan Thoreau listened to him, hunching his shoulders a little at the   other's manifest air of importance. In turn, the French-Canadian   scrutinized Jan good-naturedly. Neither of them knew the part which   Jean de Gravois was to play in Jan's life. 
  Every hour after the half-breed's arrival quickened the pulse of   expectancy at the post. For six months it had been a small and   solitary unit of life in the heart of a big desolation. The first snow   had smothered it in a loneliness that was almost the loneliness of   desertion. With that first snow began the harvest days of the people   of the wilderness. Far and wide they were busy along their trap-lines,   their lonely shacks hidden in the shelter of thick swamps, in deep   chasms and dense forests. For six months the short days and the long   nights had been days and nights of fur-gathering. 
  During those months the post was silent. It lived and breathed, but   that was all. Its life, for Williams and the few people whom the   company kept with him, was a life of waiting. Now the change was at   hand. It was like the breath of spring to the awakening wilderness.   The forest people were moving. Trap-lines were being broken, shacks   abandoned, sledge-dogs put to harness. On the day that Jean de Gravois   left for Hudson's Bay, the company's supplies came in from Fort   Churchill&#8212;seven toboggans drawn by Eskimo dogs, laden with flour and   cloth; fifty pounds of beads, ammunition, and a hundred other things   to be exchanged for the furs that would soon be in London and Paris. 
  Fearfully Jan Thoreau ran out to meet the sledges. There were seven   Indians and one white man. Jan thrust himself close to look at the   white man. He wore two revolver-holsters and carried an automatic.   Unquestionably he was not a missionary, but an agent of the company   well prepared to care for the company's treasure. 
  Jan hurried back to the cabin, his heart bubbling with a strange  joy. 
  &quot;There ees no missioner, M&eacute;lisse!&quot; he cried triumphantly, dropping   beside her, his face glowing with the gladness of his tidings. &quot;You   shall be good and beautiful, lak HER, but you shall not be baptize by   missioner! He has not come!&quot; 
  A few minutes later Cummins came in. One of his hands was torn and   bleeding. 
  &quot;Those Eskimo dogs are demons!&quot; he growled. &quot;If they knew how to  stand  on their legs, they'd eat our huskies alive! Will you help me  with  this?&quot; 
  Jan was at work in an instant, bandaging the wounded hand. 
  &quot;It ees not deep,&quot; he said; and then, without looking up, he added:   &quot;The missioner did not come.&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Cummins shortly. &quot;Neither has the mail. He is with  that.&quot; 
  He did not notice the sudden tremble of Jan's fingers, nor did he  see  the startled look that shot into the boy's down-turned eyes. Jan   finished his bandaging without betraying his emotion, and went back   with Cummins to the company's store. 
  The next morning, two Chippewayans trailed in with a team of  mongrel  curs from the south. Thereafter Cummins found but little time  to  devote to M&eacute;lisse. The snow was softening rapidly, and the daily   increasing warmth of the sun hastened the movement of the trappers.   Mukee's people from the western Barren Lands arrived first, bringing   with them great loads of musk-ox and caribou skins, and an army of   big-footed, long-legged Mackenzie hounds that pulled like horses and   wailed like whipped puppies when the huskies and Eskimo dogs set upon   them. 
  From east and west and south all trails now led to the post. By the   end of the third day after the arrival of the company's supplies, a   babel of fighting, yelling, ceaselessly moving discord had driven   forth the peace and quiet in which Cummins' wife had died. The   fighting and discord were among the dogs, and the yelling was a   necessary human accompaniment. Half a hundred packs, almost as wild   and as savage as the wolves from whom half of them possessed a strong   inheritance of blood, were thrown suddenly into warring confusion. 
  All the dogs were fighters except the big, soft-throated Mackenzie   hounds, with the slow strength of oxen in their movements, and the   quarter-strained and half-strained mongrels from the south; and upon   these unfortunates the others preyed. Packs of fierce Labrador dogs,   never vanquished except by death, came from close to Hudson's Bay.   Team after team of the little yellow and gray Eskimo dogs, as quick   with their fangs as were their black and swift-running masters with   their hands and feet, met the much larger and darker-colored Malemutes   from the Athabasca. Enemies of all these, fighting, snapping, and   snarling, with the lust of killing deep born in them from their wolf   progenitors, packs of fierce huskies trailed in from all sides. 
  There was no cessation in the battle of the fangs. It began with  the  first brute arrivals. It continued from dawn through the day, and   around the campfires at night. There was never an end to the strife   between the dogs, and between the men and the dogs. The snow was   stained and trailed with blood, and the scent of it added greater   fierceness to the wolf-breeds. Half a dozen battles were fought to the   death each day and night. Those that died were chiefly the south-bred   curs&#8212;mixtures of mastiff, Great Dane, and sheep-dogs&#8212;and the fatally   slow Mackenzie hounds. 
  From its towering height the sentinel spruce frowned down upon the   savage life that had come to outrage the grave it guarded. Yet beyond   all this discord and bloody strife there was a great, throbbing human   happiness&#8212;a beating of honest hearts filled to overflowing with the   joys of the moment, a welding of new friendships, a renewal of old   ones, a closer union of the brotherhood that holds together all things   under the cold gray of the northern skies. 
  There were no bickerings among the hunters, no anger of man against   man in the fierce voices that emphasized the slashing cuts of the   caribou-whips. If the fangs of a Hudson's Bay husky let out the life-   blood from the soft throat of a Mackenzie hound, it was a matter of   the dogs, and not of their owners. They did not quarrel. 
  One day a fierce Eskimo pack cornered a giant husky under the big   spruce, and slew him. When Cummins came from the company's store in   the afternoon, he saw a number of men, with bared heads, working about   the grave. He drew near enough to see that they were building around   it a barricade of saplings; and his breath choked him as he turned to   the cabin and M&eacute;lisse. He noticed, too, that no fires were built near   the spot consecrated to the memory of the dead woman; and to his cabin   the paths in the snow became deeper and wider where trod the wild   forest men who came to look upon the little M&eacute;lisse. 
  These were days of unprecedented prosperity and triumph for the  baby,  as they were for the company. The cabin was half filled with  strange  things, for all who came gave something to M&eacute;lisse. There were  polar  bears' teeth, brought down by the little black men who in turn  had got  them from the coast people; strange gods carved from wood;  bits of  fur, bushy fox tails, lynx paws, dried fruits, candy bought at   fabulous prices in the store, and musk&#8212;always and incessantly musk&#8212;   from Mukee's people of the west barrens. 
  To Jan this homage to M&eacute;lisse was more than gratifying. It formed a   bond between him and Cummins' people. His heart went out to them, and   he went more freely among them, and made friends.
