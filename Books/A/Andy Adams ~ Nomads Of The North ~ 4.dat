  That night came a cold and drizzling rain from out of the north   and the east. In the wet dawn Challoner came out to start a fire,  and  in a hollow under a spruce root he found Miki and Neewa  cuddled  together, sound asleep. 
  It was the cub who first saw the man-beast, and for a brief space   before the pup roused himself Neewa's shining eyes were fixed on  the  strange enemy who had so utterly changed his world for him.  Exhaustion  had made him sleep through the long hours of that first  night of  captivity, and in sleep he had forgotten many things. But  now it all  came back to him as he cringed deeper into his shelter  under the root,  and so softly that only Miki heard him he  whimpered for his mother. 
  It was the whimper that roused Miki. Slowly he untangled himself   from the ball into which he had rolled, stretched his long and   overgrown legs, and yawned so loudly that the sound reached   Challoner's ears. The man turned and saw two pairs of eyes fixed  upon  him from the sheltered hollow under the root. The pup's one  good ear  and the other that was half gone stood up alertly, as he  greeted his  master with the boundless good cheer of an  irrepressible comradeship.  Challoner's face, wet with the drizzle  of the gray skies and bronzed  by the wind and storm of fourteen  months in the northland, lighted up  with a responsive grin, and  Miki wriggled forth weaving and twisting  himself into grotesque  contortions expressive of happiness at being  thus directly smiled  at by his master. 
  With all the room under the root left to him Neewa pulled himself   back until only his round head was showing, and from this fortress  of  temporary safety his bright little eyes glared forth at his  mother's  murderer. 
  Vividly the tragedy of yesterday was before him again&#8212;the warm,   sun-filled creek bottom in which he and Noozak, his mother, were   hunting a breakfast of crawfish when the man-beast came; the crash  of  strange thunder, their flight into the timber, and the end of  it all  when his mother turned to confront their enemy. And yet it  was not the  death of his mother that remained with him most  poignantly this  morning. It was the memory of his own terrific  fight with the white  man, and his struggle afterward in the black  and suffocating depths of  the bag in which Challoner had brought  him to his camp. Even now  Challoner was looking at the scratches  on his hands. He advanced a few  steps, and grinned down at Neewa,  just as he had grinned  good-humouredly at Miki, the angular pup. 
  Neewa's little eyes blazed. 
  &quot;I told you last night that I was sorry,&quot; said Challoner, speaking   as if to one of his own kind. 
  In several ways Challoner was unusual, an out-of-the-ordinary type   in the northland. He believed, for instance, in a certain specific   psychology of the animal mind, and had proven to his own  satisfaction  that animals treated and conversed with in a matter-  of-fact human way  frequently developed an understanding which he,  in his unscientific  way, called reason. 
  &quot;I told you I was sorry,&quot; he repeated, squatting on his heels   within a yard of the root from under which Neewa's eyes were  glaring  at him, &quot;and I am. I'm sorry I killed your mother. But we  had to have  meat and fat. Besides, Miki and I are going to make it  up to you.  We're going to take you along with us down to the Girl,  and if you  don't learn to love her you're the meanest, lowest-down  little cuss in  all creation and don't deserve a mother. You and  Miki are going to be  brothers. His mother is dead, too&#8212;plum  starved to death, which is  worse than dying with a bullet in your  lung. And I found Miki just as  I found you, hugging up close to  her an' crying as if there wasn't any  world left for him. So cheer  up, and give us your paw. Let's shake!&quot; 
  Challoner held out his hand. Neewa was as motionless as a stone. A   few moments before he would have snarled and bared his teeth. But  now  he was dead still. This was by all odds the strangest beast he  had  ever seen. Yesterday it had not harmed him, except to put him  into the  bag. And now it did not offer to harm him. More than  that, the talk it  made was not unpleasant, or threatening. His  eyes took in Miki. The  pup had squeezed himself squarely between  Challoner's knees and was  looking at him in a puzzled, questioning  sort of way, as if to ask:  &quot;Why don't you come out from under that  root and help get breakfast?&quot; 
  Challoner's hand came nearer, and Neewa crowded himself back until   there was not another inch of room for him to fill. Then the  miracle  happened. The man-beast's paw touched his head. It sent a  strange and  terrible thrill through him. Yet it did not hurt. If  he had not wedged  himself in so tightly he would have scratched  and bitten. But he could  do neither. 
  Slowly Challoner worked his fingers to the loose hide at the back   of Neewa's neck. Miki, surmising that something momentous was  about  to happen, watched the proceedings with popping eyes. Then  Challoner's  fingers closed and the next instant he dragged Neewa  forth and held  him at arm's length, kicking and squirming, and  setting up such a  bawling that in sheer sympathy Miki raised his  voice and joined in the  agonized orgy of sound. Half a minute  later Challoner had Neewa once  more in the prison-sack, but this  time he left the cub's head  protruding, and drew in the mouth of  the sack closely about his neck,  fastening it securely with a  piece of babiche string. Thus three  quarters of Neewa was  imprisoned in the sack, with only his head  sticking out. He was a  cub in a poke. 
  Leaving the cub to roll and squirm in protest Challoner went about   the business of getting breakfast. For once Miki found a  proceeding  more interesting than that operation, and he hovered  about Neewa as he  struggled and bawled, trying vainly to offer him  some assistance in  the matter of sympathy. Finally Neewa lay  still, and Miki sat down  close beside him and eyed his master with  serious questioning if not  actual disapprobation. 
  The gray sky was breaking with the promise of the sun when   Challoner was ready to renew his long journey into the southland.  He  packed his canoe, leaving Neewa and Miki until the last. In the  bow of  the canoe he made a soft nest of the skin taken from the  cub's mother.  Then he called Miki and tied the end of a worn rope  around his neck,  after which he fastened the other end of this  rope around the neck of  Neewa. Thus he had the cub and the pup on  the same yard-long halter.  Taking each of the twain by the scruff  of the neck he carried them to  the canoe and placed them in the  nest he had made of Noozak's hide. 
  &quot;Now you youngsters be good,&quot; he warned. &quot;We're going to aim at   forty miles to-day to make up for the time we lost yesterday.&quot; 
  As the canoe shot out a shaft of sunlight broke through the sky   low in the east.
