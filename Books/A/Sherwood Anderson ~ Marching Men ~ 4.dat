In a cellar-like house driven like a stake into the hillside above  Coal Creek lived Kate Hartnet with her son Mike. Her man had died with  the others during the fire in the mine. Her son like Beaut McGregor  did not work in the mine. He hurried through Main Street or went half  running among the trees on the hills. Miners seeing him hurrying along  with white intense face shook their heads. "He's cracked," they said.  "He'll hurt some one yet."    
Beaut saw Mike hurrying about the streets. Once encountering him in  the pine woods above the town he walked with him and tried to get him  to talk. In his pockets Mike carried books and pamphlets. He set traps  in the woods and brought home rabbits and squirrels. He got together  collections of birds' eggs which he sold to women in the trains that  stopped at Coal Creek and when he caught birds he stuffed them, put  beads in their eyesockets and sold them also. He proclaimed himself an  anarchist and like Cracked McGregor muttered to himself as he hurried  along.    
One day Beaut came upon Mike Hartnet reading a book as he sat on a log  overlooking the town. A shock ran through McGregor when he looked over  the shoulder of the man and saw what book he read. "It is strange," he  thought, "that this fellow should stick to the same book that fat old  Weeks makes his living by."    
Beaut sat on the log beside Hartnet and watched him. The reading man  looked up and nodded nervously then slid along the log to the farther  end. Beaut laughed. He looked down at the town and then at the  frightened nervous book-reading man on the log. An inspiration came to  him.    
"If you had the power, Mike, what would you do to Coal Creek?" he  asked.    
The nervous man jumped and tears came into his eyes. He stood before  the log and spread out his hands. "I would go among men like Christ,"  he cried, pitching his voice forward like one addressing an audience.  "Poor and humble, I would go teaching them of love." Spreading out his  hands like one pronouncing a benediction he shouted, "Oh men of Coal  Creek, I would teach you love and the destruction of evil."    
Beaut jumped up from the log and strode before the trembling figure.  He was strangely moved. Grasping the man he thrust him back upon the  log. His own voice rolled down the hillside in a great roaring laugh.  "Men of Coal Creek," he shouted, mimicking the earnestness of Hartnet,  "listen to the voice of McGregor. I hate you. I hate you because you  jeered at my father and at me and because you cheated my mother, Nance  McGregor. I hate you because you are weak and disorganised like  cattle. I would like to come among you teaching the power of force. I  would like to slay you one by one, not with weapons but with my naked  fists. If they have made you work like rats buried in a hole they are  right. It is man's right to do what he can. Get up and fight. Fight  and I'll get on the other side and you can fight me. I'll help drive  you back into your holes."    
Beaut ceased speaking and jumping over the logs ran down the road.  Among the first of the miner's houses he stopped and laughed  awkwardly. "I am cracked also," he thought, "shouting at emptiness on  a hillside." He went on in a reflective mood, wondering what power had  taken hold of him. "I would like a fight--a fight against odds," he  thought. "I will stir things up when I am a lawyer in the city."    
Mike Hartnet came running down the road at the heels of McGregor.  "Don't tell," he plead trembling. "Don't tell about me in the town.  They will laugh and call names after me. I want to be let alone."    
Beaut shook himself loose from the detaining hand and went on down the  hill. When he had passed out of sight of Hartnet he sat down on the  ground. For an hour he looked at the town in the valley and thought of  himself. He was half proud, half ashamed of the thing that had  happened.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
In the blue eyes of McGregor anger flashed quick and sudden. Upon the  streets of Coal Creek he walked, swinging along, his great body  inspiring fear. His mother grown grave and silent worked in the  offices of the mines. Again she had a habit of silence in her own home  and looked at her son, half fearing him. All day she worked in the  mine offices and in the evening sat silently in a chair on the porch  before her house and looked down into Main Street.    
Beaut McGregor did nothing. He sat in the dingy little pool room and  talked with the black-haired boy or walked over the hills swinging a  stick in his hand and thinking of the city to which he would presently  go to start his career. As he walked in the streets women stopped to  look at him, thinking of the beauty and strength of his maturing body.  The miners passed him in silence hating him and dreading his wrath.  Walking among the hills he thought much of himself. "I am capable of  anything," he thought, lifting his head and looking at the towering  hills, "I wonder why I stay on here."    
When he was eighteen Beaut's mother fell ill. All day she lay on her  back in bed in the room above the empty bakery. Beaut shook himself  out of his waking stupor and went about seeking work. He had not felt  that he was indolent. He had been waiting. Now he bestirred himself.  "I'll not go into the mines," he said, "nothing shall get me down  there."    
He got work in a livery stable cleaning and feeding the horses. His  mother got out of bed and began going again to the mine offices.  Having started to work Beaut stayed on, thinking it but a way station  to the position he would one day achieve in the city.    
In the stable worked two young boys, sons of coal miners. They drove  travelling men from the trains to farming towns in valleys back among  the hills and in the evening with Beaut McGregor they sat on a bench  before the barn and shouted at people going past the stable up the  hill.    
The livery stable in Coal Creek was owned by a hunchback named Weller  who lived in the city and went home at night. During the day he sat  about the stable talking to red-haired McGregor. "You're a big beast,"  he said laughing. "You talk about going away to the city and making  something of yourself and still you stay on here doing nothing. You  want to quit this talking about being a lawyer and become a prize  fighter. Law is a place for brains not muscles." He walked through the  stables leaning his head to one side and looking up at the big fellow  who brushed the horses. McGregor watched him and grinned. "I'll show  you," he said.    
The hunchback was pleased when he strutted before McGregor. He had  heard men talk of the strength and the evil temper of his stableman  and it pleased him to have so fierce a fellow cleaning the horses. At  night in the city he sat under the lamp with his wife and boasted. "I  make him step about," he said.    
In the stable the hunchback kept at the heels of McGregor. "And  there's something else," he said, putting his hand in his pockets and  raising himself on his toes. "You look out for that undertaker's  daughter. She wants you. If she gets you there will be no law study  but a place in the mines for you. You let her alone and begin taking  care of your mother."    
Beaut went on cleaning the horses and thinking of what the hunchback  had said. He thought there was sense to it. He also was afraid of the  tall pale girl. Sometimes when he looked at her a pain shot through  him and a combination of fear and desire gripped him. He walked away  from it and went free as he went free from the life in the darkness  down in the mine. "He has a kind of genius for keeping away from the  things he don't like," said the liveryman, talking to Uncle Charlie  Wheeler in the sun before the door of the post office.    
One afternoon the two boys who worked in the livery stable with  McGregor got him drunk. The affair was a rude joke, elaborately  planned. The hunchback had stayed in the city for the day and no  travelling men got off the trains to be driven over the hills. In the  afternoon hay brought over the hill from the fruitful valley was being  put into the loft of the barn and between loads McGregor and the two  boys sat on the bench by the stable door. The two boys went to the  saloon and brought back beer, paying for it from a fund kept for that  purpose. The fund was the result of a system worked out by the two  drivers. When a passenger gave one of them a coin at the end of a day  of driving he put it into the common fund. When the fund had grown to  some size the two went to the saloon and stood before the bar drinking  until it was spent and then came back to sleep off their stupor on the  hay in the barn. After a prosperous week the hunchback occasionally  gave them a dollar for the fund.    
Of the beer McGregor drank but one foaming glass. For all his idling  about Coal Creek he had never before tasted beer and it was strong and  bitter in his mouth. He threw up his head and gulped it then turned  and walked toward the rear of the stable to conceal the tears that the  taste of the stuff had forced into his eyes.    
The two drivers sat on the bench and laughed. The drink they had given  Beaut was a horrible mess concocted by the laughing bartender at their  suggestion. "We will get the big fellow drunk and hear him roar," the  bartender had said.    
As he walked toward the back of the stable a convulsive nausea seized  Beaut. He stumbled and pitched forward, cutting his face on the floor.  Then he rolled over on his back and groaned and a little stream of  blood ran down his cheek.    
The two boys jumped up from the bench and ran toward him. They stood  looking at his pale lips. Fear seized them. They tried to lift him but  he fell from their arms and lay again on the stable floor, white and  motionless. Filled with fright they ran from the stable and through  Main Street. "We must get a doctor," they said as they hurried along,  "He is mighty sick--that fellow."    
In the doorway leading to the rooms over the undertaker's shop stood  the tall pale girl. One of the running boys stopped and addressed her,  "Your red-head," he shouted, "is blind drunk lying on the stable  floor. He has cut his head and is bleeding."    
The tall girl ran down the street to the offices of the mine. With  Nance McGregor she hurried to the stable. The store keepers along Main  Street looked out of their doors and saw the two women pale and with  set faces half-carrying the huge form of Beaut McGregor along the  street and in at the door of the bakery.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
At eight o'clock that evening Beaut McGregor, his legs still unsteady,  his face white, climbed aboard a passenger train and passed out of the  life of Coal Creek. On the seat beside him a bag contained all his  clothes. In his pocket lay a ticket to Chicago and eighty-five  dollars, the last of Cracked McGregor's savings. He looked out of the  car window at the little woman thin and worn standing alone on the  station platform and a great wave of anger passed through him. "I'll  show them," he muttered. The woman looked at him and forced a smile to  her lips. The train began to move into the west. Beaut looked at his  mother and at the deserted streets of Coal Creek and put his head down  upon his hands and in the crowded car before the gaping people wept  with joy that he had seen the last of youth. He looked back at Coal  Creek, full of hate. Like Nero he might have wished that all of the  people of the town had but one head so that he might have cut it off  with a sweep of a sword or knocked it into the gutter with one  swinging blow.
