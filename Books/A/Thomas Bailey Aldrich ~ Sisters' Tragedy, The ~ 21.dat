Take these rhymes into thy grace,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since they are of thy begetting,<br> Lady, that dost make each place<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where thou art a jewel's setting. 
Some such glamour lend this Book:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let it be thy poet's wages<br> That henceforth thy gracious look<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lies reflected on its pages.
