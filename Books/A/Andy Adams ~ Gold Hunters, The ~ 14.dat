  Slowly out of that mysterious gloom there grew a shape before Rod's  eyes. At first it was only a shadow, then it might have been a rock,  and then the gulp in his throat leaped out in a shout when he saw that  Wabigoon's sharp eyes had in truth discovered the old cabin of the map.  For what else could it be? What else but the wilderness home of the  adventurers whose skeletons they had found, Peter Plante and Henri  Langlois, and John Ball, the man whom these two had murdered?
  Rod's joyous voice was like the touch of fire to Wabi's enthusiasm  and in a moment the oppressive silence of their journey down the chasm  was broken by the wild cheers which the young gold seekers sent echoing  between the mountains. Grimacing and chuckling in his own curious way,  Mukoki was already slipping along the edge of the rock, seeking some  break by which he might reach the lower chasm. They were on the point  of turning to the ascent of the mountain, along which they would have  to go until they found such a break, when the old pathfinder directed  the attention of his companions to the white top of a dead cedar stub  projecting over the edge of the precipice.
  &#8220;Go down that, mebby,&#8221; he suggested, shrugging his shoulders to  suggest that the experiment might be a dangerous one.
  Rod looked over. The top of the stub was within easy reach, and the  whole tree was entirely free of bark or limbs, a fact which in his  present excitement did not strike him as especially unusual. Swinging  his rifle strap over his shoulders he reached out, caught the slender  apex of the stub, and before the others could offer a word of  encouragement or warning was sliding down the wall of the rock into the  chasm. Wabi was close behind him, and not waiting for Mukoki's descent  the two boys hurried toward the cabin. Half-way to it Wabi stopped.
  &#8220;This isn't fair. We've got to wait for Muky.&#8221;
  They looked back. Mukoki was not following. The old warrior was upon  his knees at the base of the dead tree, as though he was searching for  something among the rocks at its foot. Then he rose slowly, and rubbed  his hands along the stub as high as he could reach. When he saw that  Rod and Wabi were observing him he quickly came toward them, and  Wabigoon, who was quick to notice any change in him, was confident that  he had made a discovery of some kind.
  &#8220;What have you found, Muky?&#8221;
  &#8220;No so ver' much. Funny tree,&#8221; grunted the Indian.
  &#8220;Smooth as a fireman's brass pole,&#8221; added Rod, seeing no  significance in Mukoki's words. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;
  He stopped so suddenly that Wabigoon bumped into him from behind.
  &#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  For a few moments the three huddled close together in watchful  silence. Mukoki was behind the boys or they would have seen that his  rifle was ready to spring to his shoulder and that his black eyes were  snapping with something not aroused by curiosity alone. The cabin was  not more than twenty paces away. It was old, so old that Rod wondered  how it had withstood the heavy storms of the last winter. A growth of  saplings had found root in its rotting roof and the logs of which it  was built were in the last stage of decay. There was no window, and  where the door had once been there had grown a tree a foot in diameter,  almost closing the narrow aperture through which the mysterious  inhabitants had passed years before. A dozen paces, five paces from  this door, and Mukoki's hand reached out and laid itself gently upon  Wabi's shoulder. Rod saw the movement and stopped. A strange look had  come into the old Indian's face, an expression in which there was  incredulity and astonishment, as if he believed and yet doubted what  his eyes beheld. Mutely he pointed to the tree growing before the door,  and to the reddish, crumbling rot into which the logs had been turned  by the passing of generations.
  &#8220;Red pine,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;That cabin more'n' twent' t'ous'nd  year old!&#8221;
  There was an awesome ring in his voice. Rod understood, and clutched  Wabi's arm. In an instant he thought of the other old cabin, in which  they had found the skeletons. They had repaired that cabin and had  passed the winter in it, and they knew that it had been built half a  century or more before. But this cabin was beyond repair. To Rod it  seemed as though centuries of time instead of decades had been at work  on its timbers. Following close after Wabi he thrust his head through  the door. Deep gloom shut out their vision. But as they looked,  steadily inuring their eyes to the darkness within, the walls of the  old cabin took form, and they saw that everywhere was vacancy. There  was no ancient table, as in the other cabin they had discovered at the  head of the first chasm, there were no signs of the life that had once  existed, not even the remnants of a chair or a stool. The cabin was  bare.
  Foot by foot the two boys went around its walls. Mukoki took but a  single glance inside and disappeared. Once alone he snapped down the  safety of his rifle. Quickly, as if he feared interruption, he hurried  around the old cabin, his eyes close to the earth. When Rod and Wabi  returned to the door he was at the edge of the fall, crouching low  among the rocks like an animal seeking a trail. Wabi pulled his  companion back.
  &#8220;Look!&#8221;
  The old warrior rose, suddenly erect, and turned toward them, but  the boys were hidden in the gloom. Then he hurried to the dead stub  beside the chasm wall. Again he reached far up, rubbing his hand along  its surface.
  &#8220;I'm going to have a look at that tree!&#8221; whispered Wabi. &#8220;Something  is puzzling Are you coming?&#8221;
  He hurried across the rock-strewn opening, but Rod hung back. He  could not understand his companions. For weeks and months they had  planned to find this third waterfall. Visions of a great treasure had  been constantly before their eyes, and now that they were here, with  the gold perhaps under their very feet, both Mukoki and Wabigoon were  more interested in a dead stub than in their search for it! His own  heart was almost bursting with excitement. The very air which he  breathed in the old cabin set his blood leaping with anticipation. Here  those earlier adventurers had lived half a century or more ago. In it  the life-blood of the murdered John Ball might have ebbed away. In this  cabin the men whose skeletons he had found had slept, and planned, and  measured their gold. And the gold! It was that and not the stub that  interested Roderick Drew! Where was the lost treasure? Surely the old  cabin must hold some clue for them, it would at least tell them more  than the limbless white corpse of a tree!
  From the door he looked back into the dank gloom, straining his eyes  to see, and then glanced across the opening. Wabi had reached the stub,  and both he and Mukoki were on their knees beside it. Probably they  have found the marks of a lynx or a bear, thought Rod. A dozen paces  away something else caught his eyes, a fallen red pine, dry and heavy  with pitch, and in less than a minute he had gone to it and was back  with a torch. Breathlessly he touched the tiny flame of a match to the  stick. For a moment the pitch sputtered and hissed, then flared into  light, and Rod held the burning wood above his head.
  The young gold seeker's first look about him was disappointing.  Nothing but the bare walls met his eyes. Then, in the farthest corner,  he observed something that in the dancing torch-light was darker than  the logs themselves, and he moved toward it. It was a tiny shelf, not  more than a foot long, and upon it was a small tin box, black and  rust-eaten by the passing of ages. With trembling fingers Rod took it  in his hand. It was very light, probably empty. In it he might find the  dust of John Ball's last tobacco. Then, suddenly, as he thought of  this, he stopped in his search and a muffled exclamation of surprise  fell from him. In the glow of the torch he looked at the tin box. It  was crumbling with age and he might easily have crushed it in his  hand&#8212;and yet it was still a tin box! If this box had remained why had  not other things? Where were the pans and kettles, the pail and  frying-pan, knives, cups and other articles which John Ball and the two  Frenchmen must at one time have possessed in this cabin?
  He returned to the door. Mukoki and Wabigoon were still at the dead  stub. Even the flare of light in the old cabin had not attracted them.  Tossing his torch away Rod tore off the top of the tin box. Something  fell at his feet, and as he reached for it he saw that it was a little  roll of paper, almost as discolored as the rust-eaten box itself. As  gently as Mukoki had unrolled the precious birchbark map a few months  before he smoothed out the paper. The edges of it broke and crumbled  under his fingers, but the inner side of the roll was still quite  white. Mukoki and Wabigoon, looking back, saw him suddenly turn toward  them with a shrill cry on his lips, and the next instant he was racing  in their direction, shouting wildly at every step.
  &#8220;The gold!&#8221; he shrieked. &#8220;The gold! Hurrah!&#8221;
  He was almost sobbing in his excitement when he stopped between  them, holding out the bit of paper.
  &#8220;I found it in the cabin&#8212;in a tin box! See, it's John Ball's  writing&#8212;the writing that was on the old map! I found it&#8212;in a tin  box&#8212;&#8221;
  Wabi seized the paper. His own breath came more quickly when he saw  what was upon it. There were a few lines of writing, dim but still  legible, and a number of figures. Across the top of the paper was  written,
  &#8220;Account of John Ball, Henri Langlois, and Peter Plante for month  ending June thirtieth, 1859.&#8221;
  Below these lines was the following:
  &#8220;Plante's work: nuggets, 7 pounds, nine ounces; dust, 1 pound, 3  ounces. Langlois' work: nuggets, 9 pounds, 13 ounces; dust, none.  Ball's work: nuggets, 6 pounds, 4 ounces; dust, 2 pounds, 3 ounces.  Total, 27 pounds. Plante's share, 6 pounds, 12 ounces. Langlois' share,  6 pounds, 12 ounces. Ball's share, 13 pounds, 8 ounces. Division made.&#8221;
  Softly Wabigoon read the words aloud. When he finished his eyes met  Rod's, Mukoki was still crouching at the foot of the stub, staring at  the two boys in silence, as if stupefied by what he had just heard.
  &#8220;This doesn't leave a doubt,&#8221; said Wabi at last. &#8220;We've struck the  right place!&#8221;
  &#8220;The gold is somewhere&#8212;very near&#8212;&#8221;
  Rod could not master the tremble in his voice. As though hoping to  see the yellow treasure heaped in a pile before his eyes he turned to  the waterfall, to the gloomy walls of the chasm, and finally extended  an arm to where the spring torrent, leaping over the edge of the chasm  above, beat itself into frothing rage among the rocks between the two  mountains.
  &#8220;It's there!&#8221;
  &#8220;In the stream?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. Where else near this cabin would they have found pure nuggets  of gold? Surely not in rock! And gold-dust is always in the sands of  streams. It's there&#8212;without a doubt!&#8221;
  Both Indians went with him to the edge of the water.
  &#8220;The creek widens here until it is very shallow,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;I  don't believe that it is more than four feet deep out there in the  middle. What do you say&#8212;&#8221; He paused as he saw Mukoki slip back to the  dead stub again, then went on, &#8220;What do you say to making a trip to the  canoe after grub for our dinner, and the pans?&#8221;
  The first flash of enthusiasm that had filled Wabigoon on reading  the paper discovered by Rod was quickly passing away, and the white  youth could not but notice the change which came over both Mukoki and  his young friend when they stood once more beside the smooth white stub  that reached up to the floor of the chasm above. He controlled his own  enthusiasm enough to inspect more closely the dead tree which had  affected them so strangely. The discovery he made fairly startled him.  The surface of the stub was not only smooth and free of limbs, but was  polished until it shone with the reflecting luster of a waxed pillar!  For a moment he forgot the paper which he held in his hand, forgot the  old cabin, and the nearness of gold. In blank wonder he stared at  Mukoki, and the old Indian shrugged his shoulders.
  &#8220;Ver' nice an' smooth!&#8221;
  &#8220;Ver' dam' smooth!&#8221; emphasized Wabi, without a suggestion of humor  in his voice.
  &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; asked Rod.
  &#8220;It means,&#8221; continued Wabigoon, &#8220;that this old stub has for a good  many years been used! by something as a sort of stairway in and out of  this chasm! Now if it were a bear, there would be claw marks. If it  were a lynx, the surface of the stub would be cut into shreds. Any kind  of animal would have left his mark behind, and no animal would have put  this polish on it!&#8221;
  &#8220;Then what in the world&#8212;&#8221;
  Rod did not finish. Mukoki lifted his shoulders to a level with his  chin, and Wabi whistled as he looked straight at him.
  &#8220;Not a hard guess, eh?&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;That it's a man! Only the arms and legs of a man going up and down  that stub hundreds and thousands of times could have worn it so smooth!  Now, can you guess who that man is?&#8221;
  In a flash the answer shot into Rod's brain. He understood now why  this old stub had drawn his companions away from their search for gold,  and he felt the flush of excitement go out of his own cheeks, and an  involuntary thrill pass up his back.
  &#8220;The mad hunter!&#8221;
  Wabi nodded. Mukoki grunted and rubbed his hands.
  &#8220;Gold in bullet come from here!&#8221; said the old pathfinder. &#8220;Bad dog  man ver' swift on trail. We hurry get canoe&#8212;cut down tree!&#8221;
  &#8220;That's more than you've said in the last half-hour, and it's a good  idea!&#8221; exclaimed Wabi. &#8220;Let's get our stuff down here and chop this  stub into firewood! When he comes back and finds his ladder gone he'll  give a screech or two, I'll wager, and then it will be our chance to do  something with him. Here goes!&#8221;
  He started to climb the stub, and a minute or two later stood safely  on the rock above.
  &#8220;Slippery as a greased pole!&#8221; he called down. &#8220;Bet you can't make  it, Rod!&#8221;
  But Rod did, after a tremendous effort that left him breathless and  gasping by the time Wabi stretched out a helping hand to him. Mukoki  came up more easily. Taking only their revolvers with them the three  hurried to the birch bark, and in a single load brought their  possessions to the rock. By means of ropes the packs and other contents  of the canoe, and finally the canoe itself, were lowered into the  chasm, and while the others looked on Mukoki seized the ax and chopped  down the stub.
  &#8220;There!&#8221; he grunted, as a last blow sent the tree crashing among the  rocks. &#8220;Too high for heem jump!&#8221;
  &#8220;But a mighty good place for him to shoot from,&#8221; said Wabi, looking  up. &#8220;We'd better camp out of range.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not until we know what we've struck,&#8221; cried Rod, unstrapping a pan  from one of the packs. &#8220;Boys, the first thing to do is to wash out a  little of that river-bed!&#8221;
  He started for the creek, with Wabi close behind him bearing a  second pan. Mukoki looked after them and chuckled softly to himself as  he began making preparations for dinner. Choosing a point where the  current had swept up a small bar of pebbles and sand Wabi and Rod both  set to work. The white youth had never before panned gold, but he had  been told how it was done, and there now shot through him that strange,  thrilling excitement which enthralls the treasure hunter when he  believes that at last he has struck pay dirt. Scooping up a quantity of  the gravel and sand he filled his pan with water, then moved it,  quickly back and forth, every few moments splashing some of the &#8220;wash&quot;  or muddy water, over the side. Thus, filling and refilling his pan with  fresh water, he excitedly went through the process of &#8220;washing&quot;  everything but solid substance out of it.
  With each fresh dip into the stream the water in the pan became  clearer, and within fifteen minutes the three or four double handfuls  of sand and gravel with which he began work dwindled down to one.  Scarcely breathing in his eagerness he watched for the yellow gleam of  gold. Once a glitter among the pebbles drew a low cry from him, but  when with the point of his knife he found it to be only mica he was  glad that Wabi had not heard him. The young Indian was squatting upon  the sand, with his pan turned toward a gleam of the sun that shot  faintly down into the chasm. Without raising his head he called to Rod.
  &#8220;Found anything?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. Have you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No&#8212;yes&#8212;but I don't think it's gold&#8221;
  &#8220;What does it look like?&#8221;
  &#8220;It gleams yellow but is as hard as steel.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mica!&#8221; said Rod.
  Neither of the boys looked up during the conversation. With the  point of his hunting-knife Rod still searched in the bottom of his pan,  turning over the pebbles and raking the gravelly sand with a  painstaking care that would have made a veteran gold seeker laugh. Some  minutes had passed when Wabi spoke again.
  &#8220;I say, Rod, that's a funny-looking thing I found! If it wasn't so  hard I'd swear it was gold? Want to see it?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's mica,&#8221; repeated Rod, as another gleam, of &#8220;fool's gold&#8221; in his  own pan caught his eyes. &#8220;The stream is full of it!&#8221;
  &#8220;Never saw mica in chunks before,&#8221; mumbled Wabi, bending low over  his pan.
  &#8220;Chunks!&#8221; cried Rod, straightening as if some one had run a pin into  his back. &#8220;How big is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Big as a pea&#8212;a big pea!&#8221;
  The words were no sooner out of the young Indian's mouth than  Roderick was upon his feet and running to his companion.
  &#8220;Mica doesn't come in chunks! Where&#8212;&#8221;
  He bent over Wabi's pan. In the very middle of it lay a suspiciously  yellow pebble, worn round and smooth by the water, and when Rod took it  in his fingers he gave a low whistle of mock astonishment as he gazed  down into Wabigoon's face.
  &#8220;Wabi, I'm ashamed of you!&#8221; he said, trying hard to choke back the  quiver in his voice. &#8220;Mica doesn't come in round chunks like this. Mica  isn't heavy. And this is<I> both</I>!&#8221;
  From the cedars beyond the old cabin came Mukoki's whooping signal  that dinner was ready.
