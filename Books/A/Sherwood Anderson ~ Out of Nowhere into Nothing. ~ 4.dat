Rosalind at work in Walter Sayers' office was from the beginning  something different, apart from the young woman from Iowa who had been  drifting from office to office, moving from rooming house to rooming  house on Chicago's North Side, striving feebly to find out something  about life by reading books, going to the theatre and walking alone in  the streets. In the new place her life at once began to have point and  purpose, but at the same time the perplexity that was later to send her  running to Willow Springs and to the presence of her mother began to  grow in her.    
Walter Sayers' office was a rather large room on the third floor of the  factory whose walls went straight up from the river's edge. In the  morning Rosalind arrived at eight and went into the office and closed  the door. In a large room across a narrow hallway and shut off from her  retreat by two thick, clouded-glass partitions was the company's  general office. It contained the desks of salesmen, several clerks, a  bookkeeper and two stenographers. Rosalind avoided becoming acquainted  with these people. She was in a mood to be alone, to spend as many  hours as possible alone with her own thoughts.    
She got to the office at eight and her employer did not arrive until  nine-thirty or ten. For an hour or two in the morning and in the late  afternoon she had the place to herself. Immediately she shut the door  into the hallway and was alone she felt at home. Even in her father's  house it had never been so. She took off her wraps and walked about the  room touching things, putting things to rights. During the night a  negro woman had scrubbed the floor and wiped the dust off her  employer's desk but she got a cloth and wiped the desk again. Then she  opened the letters that had come in and after reading arranged them in  little piles. She wanted to spend a part of her wages for flowers and  imagined clusters of flowers arranged in small hanging baskets along  the grey walls. "I'll do that later, perhaps," she thought.    
The walls of the room enclosed her. "What makes me so happy here?" she  asked herself. As for her employer--she felt she scarcely knew him. He  was a shy man, rather small--    
She went to a window and stood looking out. Near the factory a bridge  crossed the river and over it went a stream of heavily loaded wagons  and motor trucks. The sky was grey with smoke. In the afternoon, after  her employer had gone for the day, she would stand again by the window.  As she stood thus she faced westward and in the afternoon saw the sun  fall down the sky. It was glorious to be there alone during the late  hours of the afternoon. What a tremendous thing this city in which she  had come to live! For some reason after she went to work for Walter  Sayers the city seemed, like the room in which she worked, to have  accepted her, taken her into itself. In the late afternoon the rays of  the departing sun fell across great banks of clouds. The whole city  seemed to reach upwards. It left the ground and ascended into the air.  There was an illusion produced. Stark grim factory chimneys, that all  day were stiff cold formal things sticking up into the air and belching  forth black smoke, were now slender upreaching pencils of light and  wavering color. The tall chimneys detached themselves from the  buildings and sprang into the air. The factory in which Rosalind stood  had such a chimney. It also was leaping upward. She felt herself being  lifted, an odd floating sensation was achieved. With what a stately  tread the day went away, over the city! The city, like the factory  chimneys yearned after it, hungered for it.    
In the morning gulls came in from Lake Michigan to feed on the sewage  floating in the river below. The river was the color of chrysoprase.  The gulls floated above it as sometimes in the evening the whole city  seemed to float before her eyes. They were graceful, living, free  things. They were triumphant. The getting of food, even the eating of  sewage was done thus gracefully, beautifully. The gulls turned and  twisted in the air. They wheeled and floated and then fell downward to  the river in a long curve, just touching, caressing the surface of the  water and then rising again.    
Rosalind raised herself on her toes. At her back beyond the two glass  partitions were other men and women, but there, in that room, she was  alone. She belonged there. What an odd feeling she had. She also  belonged to her employer, Walter Sayers. She scarcely knew the man and  yet she belonged to him. She threw her arms above her head, trying  awkwardly to imitate some movement of the birds.    
Her awkwardness shamed her a little and she turned and walked about the  room. "I'm twenty-five years old and it's a little late to begin trying  to be a bird, to be graceful," she thought. She resented the slow  stupid heavy movements of her father and mother, the movements she had  imitated as a child. "Why was I not taught to be graceful and beautiful  in mind and body, why in the place I came from did no one think it  worth while to try to be graceful and beautiful?" she whispered to  herself.    
How conscious of her own body Rosalind was becoming! She walked across  the room, trying to go lightly and gracefully. In the office beyond the  glass partitions someone spoke suddenly and she was startled. She  laughed foolishly. For a long time after she went to work in the office  of Walter Sayers she thought the desire in herself to be physically  more graceful and beautiful and to rise also out of the mental  stupidity and sloth of her young womanhood was due to the fact that the  factory windows faced the river and the western sky, and that in the  morning she saw the gulls feeding and in the afternoon the sun going  down through the smoke clouds in a riot of colors.
