  &quot;Bring out the hoss thief! Lynch him! Lynch him!&quot; 
  &quot;What's up?&quot; asked the tramp drowsily, opening his eyes. 
  &quot;Bring out the hoss thief!&quot; cried a dozen rough voices, as the   battering at the door was repeated. 
  &quot;They want you, young feller!&quot; he continued, as he caught the  meaning  of the cry. 
  &quot;What shall we do?&quot; asked Walter helplessly. 
  &quot;They don't want me,&quot; returned the tramp complacently. &quot;It's you  they  want!&quot; 
  &quot;You will stand by me?&quot; implored Walter, eager for any help. 
  &quot;Won't do no good! There's a crowd of them. You're in a bad box,  young  feller!&quot; 
  &quot;Have you got a pistol?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  Then it flashed upon Walter that he still had the revolver which   belonged to Dick Ranney. 
  &quot;I will sell my life dearly!&quot; thought Walter, &quot;They shan't kill me   without some resistance.&quot; 
  &quot;Open the door, or it'll be wuss for ye!&quot; cried a rough voice. 
  The door was strong, but it did not long withstand the fierce  attacks  made upon it. Walter, by the light that came in through a  crevice, saw  it sway and gradually yield to the impetuous attacks of  the mob. 
  &quot;Here's the hoss thief!&quot; exclaimed the leader, throwing the light  into  the cell occupied by the inebriate. 
  The tramp was alarmed and completely sobered by the terrible   suggestion. 
  &quot;I ain't the man!&quot; he said. &quot;It's that young feller yonder.&quot; 
  The man with the lantern turned in the direction of the other cell. 
  &quot;He's only a kid!&quot; he said doubtfully. 
  &quot;All the same, he's the hoss thief!&quot; said the tramp earnestly. 
  &quot;Is he telling the truth?&quot; asked the leader, turning to the men who   were just behind him. 
  &quot;He looks most like the hoss thief!&quot; said Dan Muggins. &quot;The other's  a  milk-and-water chap, just out of boardin'-school.&quot; 
  &quot;You're right! Smash in the cage!&quot;
