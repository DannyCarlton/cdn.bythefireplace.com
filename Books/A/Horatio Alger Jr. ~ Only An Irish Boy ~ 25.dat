  &#8220;Look here, young chap,&#8221; said Andy, &#8220;what made you tell me that was  the Merchants' Bank?&#8221;
  &#8220;Isn't it?&#8221; asked the bootblack, with a grin.
  &#8220;It's the bank where you'll be wanted some time. Shouldn't wonder if  they'd make a mistake and lock you up instead of your money.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you got any money in the Merchants' Bank?&#8221; asked the other.
  &#8220;I'm goin' to see if they won't give me some. If you hadn't cheated  me, maybe I'd have invited you to dine with me at my hotel.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where are you stoppin'?&#8221; asked the street boy, not quite knowing  how much of Andy's story to believe.
  &#8220;At the most fashionable hotel.&#8221;
  &#8220;Parker's?&#8221;
  &#8220;You're good at guessin'. Perhaps you'd like to dine there?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know as they'd let me in,&#8221; said the boy, doubtfully; &#8220;but  I'll show you where there's a nice eatin' house, where they don't  charge half so much.&#8221;
  &#8220;'Twouldn't be fashionable enough for me. I shall have to dine  alone. See what comes of tryin' to fool your grandfather.&#8221;
  Andy went on, leaving the boy in doubt whether his jest had really  lost him a dinner.
  Andy didn't go to the Parker House, however. His expenses were to be  paid by the Misses Grant, and he felt that it wouldn't be right to be  extravagant at their expense.
  &#8220;I shall come across an eatin' house presently,&#8221; he said to himself.
  Not far off he found one with the bill of fare exposed outside, with  the prices. Andy examined it, and found that it was not an expensive  place. He really felt hungry after his morning's ride, and determined,  before he attended to his business, to get dinner. He accordingly  entered, and seated himself at one of the tables. A waiter came up and  awaited his commands.
  &#8220;What'll you have?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Bring me a plate of roast beef, and a cup of coffee,&#8221; said Andy,  &#8220;and be quick about it, for I haven't eaten anything for three weeks.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I don't think one plate will be enough for you,&#8221; said the  waiter, laughing.
  &#8220;It'll do to begin on,&#8221; said Andy.
  The order was quickly filled, and Andy set to work energetically.
  It is strange how we run across acquaintances when we least expect  it. Andy had no idea that he knew anybody in the eating house, and  therefore didn't look around, feeling no special interest in the  company. Yet there was one present who recognized him as soon as he  entered, and watched him with strong interest. The interest was not  friendly, however, as might be inferred from the scowl with which he  surveyed him. This will not be a matter of surprise to the reader when  I say that the observer was no other than Fairfax, whose attempt to rob  Colonel Preston had been defeated by Andy.
  He recognized the boy at once, both from his appearance and his  voice, and deep feelings of resentment ran in his breast. To be foiled  was disagreeable enough, but to be foiled by a boy was most  humiliating, and he had vowed revenge, if ever an opportunity occurred.  For this reason he felt exultant when he saw his enemy walking into the  eating house.
  &#8220;I'll follow him,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;and it'll go hard if I don't  get even with him for that trick he played on me.&#8221;
  But how did it happen that Andy did not recognize Fairfax?
  For two reasons: First, because the adventurer was sitting behind  him, and our hero faced the front of the room. Next, had he seen him,  it was doubtful if he would have recognized a man whom he was far from  expecting to see. For Fairfax was skilled in disguises, and no longer  was the black-whiskered individual that we formerly knew him. From  motives of prudence, he had shaved off his black hair and whiskers, and  now appeared in a red wig, and whiskers of the same hue. If any of my  readers would like to know how effectual this disguise is, let them try  it, and I will guarantee that they won't know themselves when they come  to look at their likeness in the mirror.
  After disposing of what he had ordered, Andy also ordered a plate of  apple dumpling, which he ate with great satisfaction.
  &#8220;I wouldn't mind eatin' here every day,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Maybe I'll be  in business here some day myself, and then I'll come here and dine.&#8221;
  Fairfax was through with his dinner, but waited till Andy arose. He  then arose and followed him to the desk, where both paid at the same  time. He was careless of recognition, for he felt confident in his  disguise.
  &#8220;Now,&#8221; thought Andy, &#8220;I must go to the bank.&#8221;
  But he didn't know where the bank was. So, when he got into the  street, he asked a gentleman whom he met: &#8220;Sir, can you direct me to  the Merchants' Bank?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is in State Street,&#8221; said the gentleman. &#8220;I am going past it, so  if you will come along with me, I will show you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said our hero, politely.
  &#8220;Merchants' Bank!&#8221; said Fairfax to himself, beginning to feel  interested. &#8220;I wonder what he's going there for? Perhaps I can raise a  little money, besides having my revenge.&#8221;
  He had an added inducement now in following our hero.
  When Andy went into the bank, Fairfax followed him. He was in the  room when Andy received the dividends, and, with sparkling eyes, he saw  that it was, a thick roll of bills, representing, no doubt, a  considerable sum of money.
  &#8220;That money must be mine,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It can't be the  boy's. He must have been sent by some other person. The loss will get  him into trouble. Very likely he will be considered a thief. That would  just suit me.&#8221;
  Andy was careful, however. He put the money into a pocketbook, or,  rather, wallet, with which he had been supplied by the Misses Grant,  put it in his inside pocket, and then buttoned his coat up tight. He  was determined not to lose anything by carelessness.
  But this was not his last business visit. There was another bank in  the same street where it was necessary for him to call and receive  dividends. Again Fairfax followed him, and again he saw Andy receive a  considerable sum of money.
  &#8220;There's fat pickings here,&#8221; thought Fairfax. &#8220;Now, I must manage,  in some way, to relieve him of that money. There's altogether too much  for a youngster like him. Shouldn't wonder if the money belonged to  that man I tried to rob. If so, all the better.&#8221;
  In this conjecture, as we know, Fairfax was mistaken. However, it  made comparatively little difference to him whose money it was, as long  as there was a chance of his getting it into his possession. The fact  was, that his finances were not in a very flourishing condition just at  present. He could have done better to follow some honest and  respectable business, and avoid all the dishonest shifts and  infractions of law to which he was compelled to resort, but he had  started wrong, and it was difficult to persuade him that even now it  would have been much better for him to amend his life and ways. In this  state of affairs he thought it a great piece of good luck that he  should have fallen in with a boy in charge of a large sum of money,  whom, from his youth and inexperience, he would have less trouble in  robbing than an older person.
  Andy had already decided how he would spend the afternoon. He had  heard a good deal about the Boston Museum, its large collection of  curiosities, and the plays that were performed there. One of the  pleasantest anticipations he had was of a visit to this place, the  paradise of country people. Now that his business was concluded, he  determined to go there at once. But first he must inquire the way.
  Turning around, he saw Fairfax without recognizing him.
  &#8220;Can you direct me to the Boston Museum?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Certainly, with pleasure,&#8221; said Fairfax, with alacrity. &#8220;In fact, I  am going there myself. I suppose you are going to the afternoon  performance?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you ever been there?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; but I have heard a good deal about it. I don't live in the  city.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; said Fairfax. &#8220;I am a merchant of Portland, Maine. I  have come to the city to buy my winter stock of goods. As I only come  twice a year, I generally try to enjoy myself a little while I am here.  Do you stay in the city overnight?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;So do I. Here is the Museum.&#8221;
  They had reached the Museum, which, as some of my readers are aware,  is situated in Tremont Street.
  &#8220;We go up these stairs,&#8221; said Fairfax. &#8220;If you don't object, we will  take seats together.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be glad to have company,&#8221; said Andy, politely.
  Reserved seats adjoining were furnished, and the adventurer and his  intended victim entered the Museum.
