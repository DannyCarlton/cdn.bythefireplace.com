  In the moment of stillness between them, when their hearts seemed to  have stopped beating that they might not lose the faintest whispering  of the twilight, a sound came to Alan, and he knew it was the toe of a  boot striking against stone. Not a foot in his tribe would have made  that sound; none but Stampede Smith's or his own.
  &#8220;Were they many?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;I could not see. The sun was darkening. But five or six were  running&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Behind us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;And they saw us?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think so. It was but a moment, and they were a part of the dusk.&#8221;
  He found her hand and held it closely. Her fingers clung to his, and  he could hear her quick breathing as he unbuttoned the flap of his  automatic holster.
  &#8220;You think<I> they have come</I>?&#8221; she whispered, and a cold dread  was in her voice.
  &#8220;Possibly. My people would not appear from that direction. You are  not afraid?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, no, I am not afraid.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yet you are trembling.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is this strange gloom, Alan.&#8221;
  Never had the arctic twilight gone more completely. Not half a dozen  times had he seen the phenomenon in all his years on the tundras, where  thunder-storm and the putting out of the summer sun until twilight  thickens into the gloom of near-night is an occurrence so rare that it  is more awesome than the weirdest play of the northern lights. It  seemed to him now that what was happening was a miracle, the play of a  mighty hand opening their way to salvation. An inky wall was shutting  out the world where the glow of the midnight sun should have been. It  was spreading quickly; shadows became part of the gloom, and this gloom  crept in, thickening, drawing nearer, until the tundra was a weird  chaos, neither night nor twilight, challenging vision until eyes  strained futilely to penetrate its mystery.
  And as it gathered about them, enveloping them in their own  narrowing circle of vision, Alan was thinking quickly. It had taken him  only a moment to accept the significance of the running figures his  companion had seen. Graham's men were near, had seen them, and were  getting between them and the range. Possibly it was a scouting party,  and if there were no more than five or six, the number which Mary had  counted, he was quite sure of the situation. But there might be a dozen  or fifty of them. It was possible Graham and Rossland were advancing  upon the range with their entire force. He had at no time tried to  analyze just what this force might be, except to assure himself that  with the overwhelming influence behind him, both political and  financial, and fired by a passion for Mary Standish that had revealed  itself as little short of madness, Graham would hesitate at no  convention of law or humanity to achieve his end. Probably he was  playing the game so that he would be shielded by the technicalities of  the law, if it came to a tragic end. His gunmen would undoubtedly be  impelled to a certain extent by an idea of authority. For Graham was an  injured husband &#8220;rescuing&#8221; his wife, while he&#8212;Alan Holt&#8212;was the  woman's abductor and paramour, and a fit subject to be shot upon sight!
  His free hand gripped the butt of his pistol as he led the way  straight ahead. The sudden gloom helped to hide in his face the horror  he felt of what that &#8220;rescue&#8221; would mean to Mary Standish; and then a  cold and deadly definiteness possessed him, and every nerve in his body  gathered itself in readiness for whatever might happen.
  If Graham's men had seen them, and were getting between them and  retreat, the neck of the trap lay ahead&#8212;and in this direction Alan  walked so swiftly that the girl was almost running at his side. He  could not hear her footsteps, so lightly they fell! her fingers were  twined about his own, and he could feel the silken caress of her loose  hair. For half a mile he kept on, watching for a moving shadow,  listening for a sound. Then he stopped. He drew Mary into his arms and  held her there, so that her head lay against his breast. She was  panting, and he could feel and hear her thumping heart. He found her  parted lips and kissed them.
  &#8220;You are not afraid?&#8221; he asked again.
  Her head made a fierce little negative movement against his breast.  &#8220;No!&#8221;
  He laughed softly at the beautiful courage with which she lied.  &#8220;Even if they saw us, and are Graham's men, we have given them the  slip,&#8221; he comforted her. &#8220;Now we will circle eastward back to the  range. I am sorry I hurried you so. We will go more slowly.&#8221;
  &#8220;We must travel faster,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;I want to run.&#8221;
  Her fingers sought his hand and clung to it again as they set out.  At intervals they stopped, staring about them into nothingness, and  listening. Twice Alan thought he heard sounds which did not belong to  the night. The second time the little fingers tightened about his own,  but his companion said no word, only her breath seemed to catch in her  throat for an instant.
  At the end of another half-hour it was growing lighter, yet the  breath of storm seemed nearer. The cool promise of it touched their  cheeks, and about them were gathering whispers and eddies of a thirsty  earth rousing to the sudden change. It was lighter because the wall of  cloud seemed to be distributing itself over the whole heaven, thinning  out where its solid opaqueness had lain against the sun. Alan could see  the girl's face and the cloud of her hair. Hollows and ridges of the  tundra were taking more distinct shape when they came into a dip, and  Alan recognized a thicket of willows behind which a pool was hidden.
  The thicket was only half a mile from home. A spring was near the  edge of the willows, and to this he led the girl, made her a place to  kneel, and showed her how to cup the cool water in the palms of her  hands. While she inclined her head to drink, he held back her hair and  rested with his lips pressed to it. He heard the trickle of water  running between her fingers, her little laugh of half-pleasure,  half-fear, which in another instant broke into a startled scream as he  half gained his feet to meet a crashing body that catapulted at him  from the concealment of the willows.
  A greater commotion in the thicket followed the attack; then another  voice, crying out sharply, a second cry from Mary Standish, and he  found himself on his knees, twisted backward and fighting desperately  to loosen a pair of gigantic hands at his throat. He could hear the  girl struggling, but she did not cry out again. In an instant, it  seemed, his brain was reeling. He was conscious of a futile effort to  reach his gun, and could see the face over him, grim and horrible in  the gloom, as the merciless hands choked the life from him. Then he  heard a shout, a loud shout, filled with triumph and exultation as he  was thrown back; his head seemed leaving his shoulders; his body  crumbled, and almost spasmodically his leg shot out with the last  strength that was in him. He was scarcely aware of the great gasp that  followed, but the fingers loosened at his throat, the face disappeared,  and the man who was killing him sank back. For a precious moment or two  Alan did not move as he drew great breaths of air into his lungs. Then  he felt for his pistol. The holster was empty.
  He could hear the panting of the girl, her sobbing breath very near  him, and life and strength leaped back into his body. The man who had  choked him was advancing again, on hands and knees. In a flash Alan was  up and on him like a lithe cat. His fist beat into a bearded face; he  called out to Mary as he struck, and through his blows saw her where  she had fallen to her knees, with a second hulk bending over her,  almost in the water of the little spring from which she had been  drinking. A mad curse leaped from his lips. He was ready to kill now;  he wanted to kill&#8212;to destroy what was already under his hands that he  might leap upon this other beast, who stood over Mary Standish, his  hands twisted in her long hair. Dazed by blows that fell with the force  of a club the bearded man's head sagged backward, and Alan's fingers  dug into his throat. It was a bull's neck. He tried to break it. Ten  seconds&#8212;twenty&#8212;half a minute at the most&#8212;and flesh and bone would  have given way&#8212;but before the bearded man's gasping cry was gone from  his lips the second figure leaped upon Alan.
  He had no time to defend himself from this new attack. His strength  was half gone, and a terrific blow sent him reeling. Blindly he reached  out and grappled. Not until his arms met those of his fresh assailant  did he realize how much of himself he had expended upon the other. A  sickening horror filled his soul as he felt his weakness, and an  involuntary moan broke from his lips. Even then he would have cut out  his tongue to have silenced that sound, to have kept it from the girl.  She was creeping on her hands and knees, but he could not see. Her long  hair trailed in the trampled earth, and in the muddied water of the  spring, and her hands were groping&#8212;groping&#8212;until they found what they  were seeking.
  Then she rose to her feet, carrying the rock on which one of her  hands had rested when she knelt to drink. The bearded man, bringing  himself to his knees, reached out drunkenly, but she avoided him and  poised herself over Alan and his assailant. The rock descended. Alan  saw her then; he heard the one swift, terrible blow, and his enemy  rolled away from him, limply and without sound. He staggered to his  feet and for a moment caught the swaying girl in his arms.
  The bearded man was rising. He was half on his feet when Alan was at  his throat again, and they went down together. The girl heard blows,  then a heavier one, and with an exclamation of triumph Alan stood up.  By chance his hand had come in contact with his fallen pistol. He  clicked the safety down; he was ready to shoot, ready to continue the  fight with a gun.
  &#8220;Come,&#8221; he said.
  His voice was gasping, strangely unreal and thick. She came to him  and put her hand in his again, and it was wet and sticky with tundra  mud from the spring. Then they climbed to the swell of the plain, away  from the pool and the willows.
  In the air about them, creeping up from the outer darkness of the  strange twilight, were clearer whispers now, and with these sounds of  storm, borne from the west, came a hallooing voice. It was answered  from straight ahead. Alan held the muddied little hand closer in his  own and set out for the range-houses, from which direction the last  voice had come. He knew what was happening. Graham's men were cleverer  than he had supposed; they had encircled the tundra side of the range,  and some of them were closing in on the willow pool, from which the  triumphant shout of the bearded man's companion had come. They were  wondering why the call was not repeated, and were hallooing.
  Every nerve in Alan's body was concentrated for swift and terrible  action, for the desperateness of their situation had surged upon him  like a breath of fire, unbelievable, and yet true. Back at the willows  they would have killed him. The hands at his throat had sought his  life. Wolves and not men were about them on the plain; wolves headed by  two monsters of the human pack, Graham and Rossland. Murder and lust  and mad passion were hidden in the darkness; law and order and  civilization were hundreds of miles away. If Graham won, only the  unmapped tundras would remember this night, as the deep, dark kloof  remembered in its gloom the other tragedy of more than half a century  ago. And the girl at his side, already disheveled and muddied by their  hands&#8212;
  His mind could go no farther, and angry protest broke in a low cry  from his lips. The girl thought it was because of the shadows that  loomed up suddenly in their path. There were two of them, and she, too,  cried out as voices commanded them to stop. Alan caught a swift  up-movement of an arm, but his own was quicker. Three spurts of flame  darted in lightning flashes from his pistol, and the man who had raised  his arm crumpled to the earth, while the other dissolved swiftly into  the storm-gloom. A moment later his wild shouts were assembling the  pack, while the detonations of Alan's pistol continued to roll over the  tundra.
  The unexpectedness of the shots, their tragic effect, the falling of  the stricken man and the flight of the other, brought no word from Mary  Standish. But her breath was sobbing, and in the lifting of the  purplish gloom she turned her face for an instant to Alan, tensely  white, with wide-open eyes. Her hair covered her like a shining veil,  and where it clustered in a disheveled mass upon her breast Alan saw  her hand thrusting itself forward from its clinging concealment, and in  it&#8212;to his amazement&#8212;was a pistol. He recognized the weapon&#8212;one of a  brace of light automatics which his friend, Carl Lomen, had presented  to him several Christmas seasons ago. Pride and a strange exultation  swept over him. Until now she had concealed the weapon, but all along  she had prepared to fight&#8212;to fight with<I> him</I> against their  enemies! He wanted to stop and take her in his arms, and with his  kisses tell her how splendid she was. But instead of this he sped more  swiftly ahead, and they came into the nigger-head bottom which lay in a  narrow barrier between them and the range.
  Through this ran a trail scarcely wider than a wagon-track, made  through the sea of hummocks and sedge-boles and mucky pitfalls by the  axes and shovels of his people; finding this, Alan stopped for a  moment, knowing that safety lay ahead of them. The girl leaned against  him, and then was almost a dead weight in his arms. The last two  hundred yards had taken the strength from her body. Her pale face  dropped back, and Alan brushed the soft hair away from it, and kissed  her lips and her eyes, while the pistol lay clenched against his  breast. Even then, too hard-run to speak, she smiled at him, and Alan  caught her up in his arms and darted into the narrow path which he knew  their pursuers would not immediately find if they could bet beyond  their vision. He was joyously amazed at her lightness. She was like a  child in his arms, a glorious little goddess hidden and smothered in  her long hair, and he held her closer as he hurried toward the cabins,  conscious of the soft tightening of her arms about his neck, feeling  the sweet caress of her panting breath, strengthened and made happy by  her helplessness.
  Thus they came out of the bottom as the first mist of slowly  approaching rain touched his face. He could see farther now&#8212;half-way  back over the narrow trail. He climbed a slope, and here Mary Standish  slipped from his arms and stood with new strength, looking into his  face. His breath was coming in little breaks, and he pointed. Faintly  they could make out the shadows of the corral buildings. Beyond them  were no lights penetrating the gloom from the windows of the range of  houses. The silence of the place was death-like.
  And then something grew out of the earth almost at their feet. A  hollow cry followed the movement, a cry that was ghostly and shivering,  and loud enough only for them to hear, and Sokwenna stood at their  side. He talked swiftly. Only Alan understood. There was something  unearthly and spectral in his appearance; his hair and beard were wet;  his eyes shot here and there in little points of fire; he was like a  gnome, weirdly uncanny as he gestured and talked in his monotone while  he watched the nigger-head bottom. When he had finished, he did not  wait for an answer, but turned and led the way swiftly toward the range  houses.
  &#8220;What did he say?&#8221; asked the girl.
  &#8220;That he is glad we are back. He heard the shots and came to meet  us.&#8221;
  &#8220;And what else?&#8221; she persisted.
  &#8220;Old Sokwenna is superstitious&#8212;and nervous. He said some things  that you wouldn't understand. You would probably think him mad if he  told you the spirits of his comrades slain in the kloof many years ago  were here with him tonight, warning him of things about to happen.  Anyway, he has been cautious. No sooner were we out of sight than he  hustled every woman and child in the village on their way to the  mountains. Keok and Nawadlook wouldn't go. I'm glad of that, for if  they were pursued and overtaken by men like Graham and Rossland&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Death would be better,&#8221; finished Mary Standish, and her hand clung  more tightly to his arm.
  &#8220;Yes, I think so. But that can not happen now. Out in the open they  had us at a disadvantage. But we can hold Sokwenna's place until  Stampede and the herdsmen come. With two good rifles inside, they won't  dare to assault the cabin with their naked hands. The advantage is all  ours now; we can shoot, but they won't risk the use of their rifles.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because you will be inside. Graham wants you alive, not dead. And  bullets&#8212;&#8221;
  They had reached Sokwenna's door, and in that moment they hesitated  and turned their faces back to the gloom out of which they had fled.  Voices came suddenly from beyond the corrals. There was no effort at  concealment. The buildings were discovered, and men called out loudly  and were answered from half a dozen points out on the tundra. They  could hear running feet and sharp commands; some were cursing where  they were entangled among the nigger-heads, and the sound of hurrying  foes came from the edge of the ravine. Alan's heart stood still. There  was something terribly swift and businesslike in this gathering of  their enemies. He could hear them at his cabin. Doors opened. A window  fell in with a crash. Lights flared up through the gray mist.
  It was then, from the barricaded attic window over their heads, that  Sokwenna's rifle answered. A single shot, a shriek, and then a pale  stream of flame leaped out from the window as the old warrior emptied  his gun. Before the last of the five swift shots were fired, Alan was  in the cabin, barring the door behind him. Shaded candles burned on the  floor, and beside them crouched Keok and Nawadlook. A glance told him  what Sokwenna had done. The room was an arsenal. Guns lay there, ready  to be used; heaps of cartridges were piled near them, and in the eyes  of Keok and Nawadlook blazed deep and steady fires as they held shining  cartridges between their fingers, ready to thrust them into the rifle  chambers as fast as the guns were emptied.
  In the center of the room stood Mary Standish. The candles, shaded  so they would not disclose the windows, faintly illumined her pale face  and unbound hair and revealed the horror in her eyes as she looked at  Alan.
  He was about to speak, to assure her there was no danger that  Graham's men would fire upon the cabin&#8212;when hell broke suddenly loose  out in the night. The savage roar of guns answered Sokwenna's  fusillade, and a hail of bullets crashed against the log walls. Two of  them found their way through the windows like hissing serpents, and  with a single movement Alan was at Mary's side and had crumpled her  down on the floor beside Keok and Nawadlook. His face was white, his  brain a furnace of sudden, consuming fire.
  &#8220;I thought they wouldn't shoot at women,&#8221; he said, and his voice was  terrifying in its strange hardness. &#8220;I was mistaken. And I am  sure&#8212;now&#8212;that I understand.&#8221;
  With his rifle he cautiously approached the window. He was no longer  guessing at an elusive truth. He knew what Graham was thinking, what he  was planning, what he intended to do, and the thing was appalling. Both  he and Rossland knew there would be some way of sheltering Mary  Standish in Sokwenna's cabin; they were accepting a desperate gamble,  believing that Alan Holt would find a safe place for her, while he  fought until he fell. It was the finesse of clever scheming, nothing  less than murder, and he, by this combination of circumstances and  plot, was the victim marked for death.
  The shooting had stopped, and the silence that followed it held a  significance for Alan. They were giving him an allotted time in which  to care for those under his protection. A trap-door was in the floor of  Sokwenna's cabin. It opened into a small storeroom and cellar, which in  turn possessed an air vent leading to the outside, overlooking the  ravine. In the candle-glow Alan saw the door of this trap propped open  with a stick. Sokwenna, too, was clever. Sokwenna had foreseen.
  Crouched under the window, he looked at the girls. Keok, with a  rifle in her hand, had crept to the foot of the ladder leading up to  the attic, and began to climb it. She was going to Sokwenna, to load  for him. Alan pointed to the open trap.
  &#8220;Quick, get into that!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;It is the only safe place. You  can load there and hand out the guns.&#8221;
  Mary Standish looked at him steadily, but did not move. She was  clutching a rifle in her hands. And Nawadlook did not move. But Keok  climbed steadily and disappeared in the darkness above.
  &#8220;Go into the cellar!&#8221; commanded Alan. &#8220;Good God, if you don't&#8212;&#8221;
  A smile lit up Mary's face. In that hour of deadly peril it was like  a ray of glorious light leading the way through blackness, a smile  sweet and gentle and unafraid; and slowly she crept toward Alan,  dragging the rifle in one hand and holding the little pistol in the  other, and from his feet she still smiled up at him through the  dishevelment of her shining hair, and in a quiet, little voice that  thrilled him, she said, &#8220;I am going to help you fight.&#8221;
  Nawadlook came creeping after her, dragging another rifle and  bearing an apron heavy with the weight of cartridges.
  And above, through the darkened loophole of the attic window,  Sokwenna's ferret eyes had caught the movement of a shadow in the gray  mist, and his rifle sent its death-challenge once more to John Graham  and his men. What followed struck a smile from Mary's lips, and a  moaning sob rose from her breast as she watched the man she loved rise  up before the open window to face the winged death that was again  beating a tattoo against the log walls of the cabin.
