  A frosty mist dulled the light of the stars, but this cleared away   as Jolly Roger and Peter crossed the plain between the creek and   Cragg's Ridge. 
  They did not hurry, for McKay had faith in Cassidy's word. He knew   the red-headed man-hunter would not break his promise&#8212;he would  wait  the full two hours in Indian Tom's cabin, and another five  minutes  after that. In Jolly Roger, as the minutes passed,  exultation at his  achievement died away, and there filled him  again the old  loneliness&#8212;the loneliness which called out against  the fate which had  made of Cassidy an enemy instead of a friend.  And yet&#8212;what an enemy! 
  He reached down, and touched Peter's bushy head with his hand. 
  &quot;Why didn't the Law give another man the assignment to run us   down,&quot; he protested. &quot;Someone we could have hated, and who would  have  hated us! Why did they send Cassidy&#8212;the fairest and squarest  man that  ever wore red? We can't do him a dirty turn&#8212;we can't  hurt him,  Pied-Bot, even at the worst. And if ever he takes us in  to  Headquarters, and looks at us through the bars, I feel it's  going to  be like a knife in his heart. But he'll do it, Peter, if  he can. It's  his job. And he's honest. We've got to say that of  Cassidy.&quot; 
  The Ridge loomed up at the edge of the level plain, and for a few   moments Jolly Roger paused, while he looked off through the  eastward  gloom. A mile in that direction, beyond the cleft that  ran like a  great furrow through the Ridge, was Jed Hawkins' cabin,  still and dark  under the faint glow of the stars. And in that  cabin was Nada. He felt  that she was sitting at her little window,  looking out into the night,  thinking of him&#8212;and a great desire  gripped at his heart, tugging him  in its direction. But he turned  toward the west. 
  &quot;We can't let her know what has happened, boy,&quot; he said, feeling   the urge of caution. &quot;For a little while we must let her think we   have left the country. If Cassidy sees her, and talks with her,   something in those blue-flower eyes of hers might give us away if  she  knew we were hiding up among the rocks of the Stew-Kettle. But  I'm  hopin' God A'mighty won't let her see Cassidy. And I'm  thinking He  won't, Pied-Bot, because I've a pretty good hunch He  wants us to  settle with Jed Hawkins before we go.&quot; 
  It was a habit of his years of aloneness, this talking to a   creature that could make no answer. But even in the darkness he   sensed the understanding of Peter. 
  Rocks grew thicker and heavier under their feet, and they went   more slowly, and occasionally stumbled in the gloom. But, after a   fashion, they knew their way even in darkness. More than once  Peter  had wondered why his master had so carefully explored this  useless  mass of upheaved rock at the end of Cragg's Ridge. They  had never seen  an animal or a blade of grass in all its gray, sun-  blasted sterility.  It was like a hostile thing, overhung with a  half-dead, slow-beating  something that was like the dying pulse of  an evil thing. And now  darkness added to its mystery and its  unfriendliness as Peter nosed  close at his master's heels. Up and  up they picked their way, over and  between ragged upheavals of  rock, twisting into this broken path and  that, feeling their way,  partly sensing it, and always ascending  toward the stars. Roger  McKay did not speak again to Peter. Each time  he came out where  the sky was clear he looked toward the solitary dark  pinnacle, far  up and ahead, strangely resembling a giant tombstone in  the star-  glow, that was their guide. And after many minutes of  strange  climbing, in which it seemed to Jolly Roger the nail-heads in  the  soles of his boots made weirdly loud noises on the rocks, they   came near to the top. 
  There they stopped, and in a deeply shadowed place where there was   a carpet of soft sand, with walls of rock close on either side,  Jolly  Roger spread out his blankets. Then he went out from the  black shadow,  so that a million stars seemed not far away over  their heads. Here he  sat down, and began to smoke, thinking of  what tomorrow would hold for  him, and of the many days destined to  follow that tomorrow. Nowhere in  the world was there to be&#8212;for  him&#8212;the peace of an absolute  certainty. Not until he felt the  cold steel of iron bars with his two  hands, and the fatal game had  been played to the end. 
  There was no corrosive bitterness of the vengeful in Jolly Roger's   heart. For that reason even his enemies, the Police, had fallen  into  the habit of using the nickname which the wilderness people  had given  him. He did not hate these police. Curiously, he loved  them. Their  type was to him the living flesh and blood of the  finest manhood since  the Crusaders. And he did not hate the law.  At times the Law, as  personified in all of its unswerving majesty,  amused him. It was so  terribly serious over such trivial things&#8212;  like himself, for  instance. It could not seem to sleep or rest  until a man was hanged,  or snugly put behind hard steel, no matter  how well that man loved his  human-kind&#8212;and the world. And Jolly  Roger loved both. In his heart he  believed he had not committed a  crime by achieving justice where  otherwise there would have been  no justice. Yet outwardly he cursed  himself for a lawbreaker. And  he loved life. He loved the stars  silently glowing down at him  tonight. He loved even the gray, lifeless  rock, which recalled to  his imaginative genius the terrific and  interesting life that had  once existed&#8212;he loved the ghostly majesty  of the grave-like  pinnacle that rose above him, and beyond that he  loved all the  world. 
  But most of all, more than his own life or all that a thousand   lives might hold for him, he loved the violet-eyed girl who had  come  into his life from the desolation and unhappiness of Jed  Hawkins'  cabin. 
  Forgetting the law, forgetting all but her, he went at last into   the dungeon-like gloom between the rocks, and after Peter had   wallowed himself a bed in the carpet of sand they fell asleep. 
  They awoke with the dawn. But for three days thereafter they went   forth only at night, and for three days did not show themselves  above  the barricade of rocks. The Stew-Kettle was what Jolly Roger  had  called it, and when the sun was straight above, or descending  with the  last half of the day, the name fitted. 
  It was a hot place, so hot that at a distance its piled-up masses   of white rock seemed to simmer and broil in the blazing heat of  the  July sun. Neither man nor beast would look into the heart of  it, Jolly  Roger had assured Peter, unless the one was half-witted  and the other  a fool. Looking at it from the meadowy green plain  that lay between  the Ridge and the forest their temporary retreat  was anything but a  temptation to the eye. Something had happened  there a few thousand  centuries before, and in a moment of evident  spleen and vexation the  earth had vomited up that pile of rock  debris, and Jolly Roger good  humoredly told himself and Peter that  it was an act of Providence  especially intended for them, though  planned and erupted some years  before they were born. 
  The third afternoon of their hiding, Jolly Roger decided upon   action. 
  This afternoon all of the caloric guns of an unclouded sun had   seemed to concentrate themselves on the gigantic rock-pile. Though  it  was now almost sunset, a swirling and dizzying incandescence  still  hovered about it. The huge masses of stone were like baked  things to  the touch of hand and foot, and one breathed a  smoldering air in  between their gray and white walls. 
  Thus forbidding looked the Stew-Kettle, when viewed from the   plain. But from the top-most crag of the mass, which rose a  hundred  feet high at the end of the Ridge, one might find his  reward for a  blistering climb. On all sides, a paradise of green  and yellow and  gold, stretched the vast wilderness, studded with  shimmering lakes  that gleamed here and there from out of their  rich dark frames of  spruce and cedar and balsam. And half way  between the edge of the  plain and this highest pinnacle of rock,  utterly hidden from the eyes  of both man and beast, nestled the  hiding place which Jolly Roger and  Peter had found. 
  It was a cool and cavernous spot, in spite of the Sahara-like heat   of the great pile. In the very heart of it two gigantic masses of   rock had put their shoulders together, like Gog and Magog, so that   under their ten thousand tons of weight was a crypt-like tunnel as   high as a man's head, into which the light and the glare of the  sun  never came. 
  Peter, now that he had grown accustomed to the deadness of it,   liked this change from Indian Tom's cabin. He liked his wallow of   soft sand during the day, and he liked still more the aloneness  and  the aloofness of their ramparted stronghold when the cool of  evening  came. He did not, of course, understand just what their  escape from  Cassidy had meant, but instinct was shrewdly at work  within him, and  no wolf could have guarded the place more  carefully than he. And he  had all creation in mind when he guarded  the rock-pile. 
  All but Nada. Many times he whimpered for her, just as the great   call for her was in Jolly Roger's own heart. And on this third   afternoon, as the hot July sun dipped half way to the western   forests, both Peter and his master were looking yearningly, and  with  the same thought, toward the east, where over the back-bone  of Cragg's  Ridge Jed Hawkins' cabin lay. 
  &quot;We'll let her know tonight,&quot; Roger McKay said at last, with   something very slow and deliberate in his voice. &quot;We'll take the   chance&#8212;and let her know.&quot; 
  Peter's bristling Airedale whiskers, standing out like a bunch of   broom splints about his face, quivered sympathetically, and he   thumped his tail in the sand. He was an artful hypocrite, was  Peter,  because he always looked as if he understood, whether he  did or not.  And Jolly Roger, staring at the gray rock-backs  outside their tunnel  door, went on. 
  &quot;We must play square with her, Pied-Bot, and it's a crime worse   than murder not to let her know the truth. If she wasn't a kid,   Peter! But she's that&#8212;just a kid&#8212;the sweetest, purest thing God   A'mighty ever made, and it isn't fair to live this lie any longer,  no  matter how we love her. And we do love her, Peter.&quot; 
  Peter lay very quiet, watching the strange gray look that had   settled in Jolly Roger's face. 
  &quot;I've got to tell her that I'm a damned highwayman,&quot; he added, in   a moment. &quot;And she won't understand, Peter. She can't. But I'm  going  to do it. I'm going to tell her&#8212;today. And then&#8212;I think  we'll be  hittin' north pretty soon, Pied-Bot. If it wasn't for Jed  Hawkins&#8212;&quot;  He rose up out of the sand, his hands clenched. 
  &quot;We ought to kill Jed Hawkins before we go. It would be safer for   her,&quot; he finished. 
  He went out, forgetting Peter, and climbed a rock-splintered path   until he stood on the knob of a mighty boulder, looking off into  the  northern wilderness. Off there, a hundred, five hundred, a  thousand  miles&#8212;was home. It was ALL his home, from Hudson's Bay  to the  Rockies, from the Height of Land to the Arctic plains, and  in it he  had lived the thrill of life according to his own  peculiar code. He  knew that he had loved life as few had ever  loved it. He had  worshipped the sun and the moon and the stars.  The world had been a  glorious place in which to live, in spite of  its ceaseless peril for  him. 
  But there was nothing of cheer left in his heart now as he stood   in the blaze of the setting sun. Paradise had come to him for a   little while, and because of it he had lived a lie. He had not  told  Jed Hawkins' foster-girl that he was an outlaw, and that he  had come  to the edge of civilization because he thought it was the  last place  the Royal Mounted would look for him. When he went to  her this evening  it would probably be for the last time. He would  tell her the truth.  He would tell her the police were after him  from one end of the  Canadian northland to the other. And that same  night, with Peter, he  would hit the trail for the Barren Lands, a  thousand miles away. He  was sure of himself now&#8212;sure&#8212;even as the  dark wall of the forest  across the plain faded out, and gave place  to a pale, girlish face  with eyes blue as flowers, and brown curls  filled with the lustre of  the sun&#8212;a face that had taken the place  of mother, sister and God  deep down in his soul. Yes, he was sure  of himself&#8212;even with that  face rising lo give battle to his last  great test of honor. He was an  outlaw, and the police wanted him,  but&#8212; 
  Peter was troubled by the grimness that settled in his master's   face. They waited for dusk, and when deep shadows had gathered in  the  valley McKay led the way out of the rock-pile. 
  An hour later they came cautiously through the darkness that lay   between the broken shoulders of Cragg's Ridge. There was a light  in  the cabin, but Nada's window was dark. Peter crouched down  under the  warning pressure of McKay's hand. 
  &quot;I'll go on alone,&quot; he said. &quot;You stay here.&quot; 
  It seemed a long time that he waited in the darkness. He could not   hear the low tap, tap, tap of his master's fingers against the  glass  of Nada's darkened window. And Jolly Roger, in response to  that  signal-tapping, heard nothing from within, except a monotone  of voice  that came from the outer room. For half an hour he  waited, repeating  the signals at intervals. At last a door opened,  and Nada stood  silhouetted against the light of the room beyond. 
  McKay tapped again, very lightly, and the door closed quickly   behind the girl. In a moment she was at the window, which was  raised  a little from the bottom. 
  &quot;Mister&#8212;Roger&#8212;&quot; she whispered. &quot;Is it&#8212;YOU?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, finding a little hand in the darkness. &quot;It's me.&quot; 
  The hand was cold, and its fingers clung tightly to his, as if the   girl was frightened. Peter, restless with waiting, had come up   quietly in the dark, and he heard the low, trembling whisper of   Nada's voice at the window. There was something in the note of it,   and in the caution of Jolly Roger's reply, that held him stiff and   attentive, his ears wide-open for approaching sound. For several   minutes he stood thus, and then the whispering voices at the  window  ceased and he heard his master retreating very quietly  through the  night. When Jolly Roger spoke to him, back under the  broken shoulder  of the ridge, he did not know that Peter had stood  near the window. 
  McKay stood looking back at the pale glow of light in the cabin. 
  &quot;Something happened there tonight&#8212;something she wouldn't tell me   about,&quot; he said, speaking half to Peter and half to himself. &quot;I  could  FEEL it. I wish I could have seen her face.&quot; 
  He set out over the plain; and then, as if remembering that he   must explain the matter to Peter, he said: 
  &quot;She can't get out tonight, Pied-Bot, but she'll come to us in the   jackpines tomorrow afternoon. We'll have to wait&quot; 
  He tried to say the thing cheerfully, but between this night and   tomorrow afternoon seemed an interminable time, now that he was   determined to make a clean breast of his affairs to Nada, and  leave  the country. Most of that night he walked in the coolness of  the  moonlit plain, and for a long time he sat amid the flower-  scented  shadows of the trysting-place in the heart of the jackpine  clump,  where Nada had a hidden place all her own. It was here that  Peter  discovered something which Jolly Roger could not see in the  deep  shadows, a bundle warm and soft and sweet with the presence  of Nada  herself. It was hidden under a clump of young banksians,  very  carefully hidden, and tucked about with grass and evergreen  boughs.  When McKay left the jackpines he wondered why it was that  Peter showed  no inclination to follow him until he was urged. 
  They did not return to the Stew-Kettle until dawn, and most of   that day Jolly Roger spent in sleep between the two big rocks. It  was  late afternoon when they made their last meal. In this  farewell hour  McKay climbed up close to the pinnacle, where he  smoked his pipe and  measured the shadows of the declining sun  until it was time to leave  for the jackpines. 
  Retracing his steps to the hiding place under Gog and Magog he   looked for Peter. But Peter's sand-wallow was empty, and Peter was   gone.
