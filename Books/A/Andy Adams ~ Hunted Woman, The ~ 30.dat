  In that chaotic night in which he was drifting, light as a feather  floating on the wind, John Aldous experienced neither pain nor very  much of the sense of life. And yet, without seeing or feeling, he  seemed to be living, All was dead in him but that last consciousness,  which is almost the spirit; he might have been dreaming, and minutes,  hours, or even years might have passed in that dream. For a long time  he seemed to be sinking through the blackness; and then something  stopped him, without jar or shock, and he was rising. He could hear  nothing. There was a vast silence about him, a silence as deep and as  unbroken as the abysmal pit in which he seemed to be softly floating.
  After a time Aldous felt himself swaying and rocking, as though  tossed gently on the billows of a sea. This was the first thought that  took shape in his struggling brain&#8212;he was at sea; he was on a ship in  the heart of a black night, and he was alone. He tried to call out, but  his tongue seemed gone. It seemed a very long time before day broke,  and then it was a strange day. Little needles of light pricked his  eyes; silver strings shot like flashes of weblike lightning through the  darkness, and after that he saw for an instant a strange glare. It was  gone in one big, powderlike flash, and he was in night again. These  days and nights seemed to follow one another swiftly now, and the  nights grew less dark, and the days brighter. He was conscious of  sounds and buffetings, and it was very hot.
  Out of this heat there came a cool, soft breeze that was continually  caressing his face, and eyes, and head. It was like the touch of a  spirit hand. It became more and more real to him. It caressed him into  a dark and comfortable oblivion. Out of this oblivion a still brighter  day roused him. His brain seemed clear. He opened his eyes. A white  cloud was hovering over them; it fell softly; it was cool and gentle.  Then it rose again, and it was not a cloud, but a hand! The hand moved  away, and he was looking into a pair of wide-open, staring, prayerful  eyes, and a little cry came to him, and a voice.
  &#8220;John&#8212;John&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He was drifting again, but now he knew that he was alive. He heard  movement. He heard voices. They were growing nearer and more distinct.  He tried to cry out Joanne's name, and it came in a whispering breath  between his lips. But Joanne heard; and he heard her calling to him; he  felt her hands; she was imploring him to open his eyes, to speak to  her. It seemed many minutes before he could do this, but at last he  succeeded. And this time his vision was not so blurred. He could see  plainly. Joanne was there, hovering over him, and just beyond her was  the great bearded face of Donald MacDonald. And then, before words had  formed on his lips, he did a wonderful thing. He smiled.
  &#8220;O my God, I thank Thee!&#8221; he heard Joanne cry out, and then she was  on her knees, and her face was against his, and she was sobbing.
  He knew that it was MacDonald who drew her away.
  The great head bent over him.
  &#8220;Take this, will 'ee, Johnny boy?&#8221;
  Aldous stared.
  &#8220;Mac, you're&#8212;alive,&#8221; he breathed.
  &#8220;Alive as ever was, Johnny. Take this.&#8221;
  He swallowed. And then Joanne hovered over him again, and he put up  his hands to her face, and her glorious eyes were swimming seas as she  kissed him and choked back the sobs in her throat. He buried his  fingers in her hair. He held her head close to him, and for many  minutes no one spoke, while MacDonald stood and looked down on them. In  those minutes everything returned to him. The fight was over. MacDonald  had come in time to save him from Quade. But&#8212;and now his eyes stared  upward through the sheen of Joanne's hair&#8212;he was in a cabin! He  recognized it. It was Donald MacDonald's old home. When Joanne raised  her head he looked about him without speaking. He was in the wide bunk  built against the wall. Sunlight was filtering through a white curtain  at the window, and in the open door he saw the anxious face of Marie.
  He tried to lift himself, and was amazed to find that he could not.  Very gently Joanne urged him back on his pillow. Her face was a glory  of life and of joy. He obeyed her as he would have obeyed the hand of  the Madonna. She saw all his questioning.
  &#8220;You must be quiet, John,&#8221; she said, and never had he heard in her  voice the sweetness of love that was in it now. &#8220;We will tell you  everything&#8212;Donald and I. But you must be quiet. You were terribly  beaten among the rocks. We brought you here at noon, and the sun is  setting&#8212;and until now you have not opened your eyes. Everything is  well. But you must be quiet. You were terribly bruised by the rocks,  dear.&#8221;
  It was sweet to lie under the caresses of her hand. He drew her face  down to him.
  &#8220;Joanne, my darling, you understand now&#8212;why I wanted to come alone  into the North?&#8221;
  Her lips pressed warm and soft against his.
  &#8220;I know,&#8221; she whispered, and he could feel her arras trembling, and  her breath coming quickly. Gently she drew away from him. &#8220;I am going  to make you some broth,&#8221; she said then.
  He watched her as she went out of the cabin, one white hand lifted  to her throat.
  Old Donald MacDonald seated himself on the edge of the bunk. He  looked down at Aldous, chuckling in his beard; and Aldous, with his  bruised and swollen face and half-open eyes, grinned like a happy  fiend.
  &#8220;It was a wunerful, wunerful fight, Johnny!&#8221; said old Donald.
  &#8220;It was, Mac. And you came in fine on the home stretch!&#8221;
  &#8220;What d'ye mean&#8212;home stretch?&#8221; queried Donald leaning over.
  &#8220;You saved me from Quade.&#8221;
  Donald fairly groaned.
  &#8220;I didn't, Johnny&#8212;I didn't! DeBar killed 'im. It was all over when  I come. On'y&#8212;Johnny&#8212;I had a most cur'ous word with Culver Rann afore  he died!&#8221;
  In his eagerness Aldous was again trying to sit up when Joanne  appeared in the doorway. With a little cry she darted to him, forced  him gently back, and brushed old Donald off the edge of the bunk.
  &#8220;Go out and watch the broth, Donald,&#8221; she commanded firmly. Then she  said to Aldous, stroking back his hair, &#8220;I forbade you to talk. John,  dear, aren't you going to mind me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Did Quade get me with the knife?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;No, no.&#8221;
  &#8220;Am I shot?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, dear.&#8221;
  &#8220;Any bones broken?&#8221;
  &#8220;Donald says not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then please give me my pipe, Joanne&#8212;and let me get up. Why do you  want me to lie here when I'm strong like an ox, as Donald says?&#8221;
  Joanne laughed happily.
  &#8220;You<I> are</I> getting better every minute,&#8221; she cried joyously.  &#8220;But you were terribly beaten by the rocks, John. If you will wait  until you have the broth I will let you sit up.&#8221;
  A few minutes later, when he had swallowed his broth, Joanne kept  her promise. Only then did he realize that there was not a bone or a  muscle in his body that did not have its own particular ache. He  grimaced when Joanne and Donald bolstered him up with blankets at his  back. But he was happy. Twilight was coming swiftly, and as Joanne gave  the final pats and turns to the blankets and pillows, MacDonald was  lighting half a dozen candles placed around the room.
  &#8220;Any watch to-night, Donald?&#8221; asked Aldous.
  &#8220;No, Johnny, there ain't no watch to-night,&#8221; replied the old  mountaineer.
  He came and seated himself on a bench with Joanne. For half an hour  after that Aldous listened to a recital of the strange things that had  happened&#8212;how poor marksmanship had saved MacDonald on the  mountain-side, and how at last the duel had ended with the old hunter  killing those who had come to slay him. When they came to speak of  DeBar, Joanne leaned nearer to Aldous.
  &#8220;It is wonderful what love will sometimes do,&#8221; she spoke softly. &#8220;In  the last few hours Marie has bared her soul to me, John. What she has  been she has not tried to hide from me, nor even from the man she  loves. She was one of Mortimer FitzHugh's tools. DeBar saw her and  loved her, and she sold herself to him in exchange for the secret of  the gold. When they came into the North the wonderful thing happened.  She loved DeBar&#8212;not in the way of her kind, but as a woman in whom had  been born a new heart and a new soul and a new joy. She defied  FitzHugh; she told DeBar how she had tricked him.
  &#8220;This morning FitzHugh attempted his old familiarity with her, and  DeBar struck him down. The act gave them excuse for what they had  planned to do. Before her eyes Marie thought they had killed the man  she loved. She flung herself on his breast, and she said she could not  feel his heart beat, and his blood flowed warm against her hands and  face. Both she and DeBar had determined to warn us if they could. Only  a few minutes before DeBar was stabbed he had let off his rifle&#8212;an  accident, he said. But it was not an accident. It was the shot Donald  heard in the cavern. It saved us, John! And Marie, waiting her  opportunity, fled to us in the plain. DeBar was not killed. He says my  screams brought him back to life. He came out&#8212;and killed Quade with a  knife. Then he fell at our feet. A few minutes later Donald came. DeBar  is in another cabin. He is not fatally hurt, and Marie is happy.&#8221;
  She was stroking his hand when she finished. The curious rumbling  came softly in MacDonald's beard and his eyes were bright with a  whimsical humour.
  &#8220;I pretty near bored a hole through poor Joe when I come up,&#8221; he  chuckled. &#8220;But you bet I hugged him when I found what he'd done,  Johnny! Joe says their camp was just over the range from us that night  FitzHugh looked us up, an' Joanne thought she'd been dreamin'. He  didn't have any help, but his intention was to finish us alone&#8212;murder  us asleep&#8212;when Joanne cried out. Joe says it was just a devil's freak  that took 'im to the top of the mountain alone that night. He saw our  fire an' came down to investigate.&#8221;
  A low voice was calling outside the door. It was Marie. As Joanne  went to her a quick gleam came into old Donald's eyes. He looked behind  him cautiously to see that she had disappeared, then he bent over  Aldous, and whispered hoarsely:
  &#8220;Johnny, I had a most cur'ous word with Rann&#8212;or FitzHugh&#8212;afore he  died! He wasn't dead when I went to him. But he knew he was dyin'; an'  Johnny, he was smilin' an' cool to the end. I wanted to ask 'im a  question, Johnny. I was dead cur'ous to know<I> why the grave were  empty!</I> But he asked for Joanne, an' I couldn't break in on his last  breath. I brought her. The first thing he asked her was how people had  took it when they found out he'd poisoned his father! When Joanne told  him no one had ever thought he'd killed his father, FitzHugh sat  leanin' against the saddles for a minit so white an' still I thought he  'ad died with his eyes open. Then it came out, Johnny. He was smilin'  as he told it. He killed his father with poison to get his money. Later  he came to America. He didn't have time to tell us how he come to think  they'd discovered his crime. He was dyin' as he talked. It came out  sort o' slobberingly, Johnny. He thought they'd found 'im out. He  changed his name, an' sent out the report that Mortimer FitzHugh had  died in the mount'ins. But Johnny, he died afore I could ask him about  the grave!&#8221;
  There was a final note of disappointment in old Donald's voice that  was almost pathetic.
  &#8220;It was such a cur'ous grave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;An' the clothes were laid  out so prim an' nice.&#8221;
  Aldous laid his hand on MacDonald's.
  &#8220;It's easy, Mac,&#8221; he said, and he wanted to laugh at the  disappointment that was still in the other's face. &#8220;Don't you see? He  never expected any one to dig<I> into</I> the grave. And he put the  clothes and the watch and the ring in there to get rid of them. They  might have revealed his identity. Why, Donald&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  Joanne was coming to them again. She laid a cool hand on his  forehead and held up a warning finger to MacDonald.
  &#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said gently, &#8220;Your head is very hot, dear, and there  must be no more talking. You must lie down and sleep. Tell John  good-night, Donald!&#8221;
  Like a boy MacDonald did as she told him, and disappeared through  the cabin door. Joanne levelled the pillows and lowered John's head.
  &#8220;I can't sleep, Joanne,&#8221; he protested.
  &#8220;I will sit here close at your side and stroke your face and hair,&#8221;  she said gently.
  &#8220;And you will talk to me?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I must not talk. But, John&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you will promise to be very, very quiet, and let me be very  quiet&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will make you a pillow of my hair.&#8221;
  &#8220;I&#8212;will be quiet,&#8221; he whispered.
  She unbound her hair, and leaned over so that it fell in a flood on  his pillow. With a sigh of contentment he buried his face in the rich,  sweet masses of it. Gently, like the cooling breeze that had come to  him in his hours of darkness, her hand caressed him. He closed his  eyes; he drank in the intoxicating perfume of her tresses; and after a  little he slept.
  For many hours Joanne sat at his bedside, sleepless, and rejoicing.
  When Aldous awoke it was dawn in the cabin. Joanne was gone. For a  few minutes he continued to lie with his face toward the window. He  knew that he had slept a long time, and that the day was breaking.  Slowly he raised himself. The terrible ache in his body was gone; he  was still lame, but no longer helpless. He drew himself cautiously to  the edge of the bunk and sat there for a time, testing himself before  he got up. He was delighted at the result of the experiments. He rose  to his feet. His clothes were hanging against the wall, and he dressed  himself. Then he opened the door and walked out into the morning,  limping a little as he went. MacDonald was up. Joanne's tepee was close  to the cabin. The two men greeted each other quietly, and they talked  in low voices, but Joanne heard them, and a few moments later she ran  out with her hair streaming about her and went straight into the arms  of John Aldous.
  This was the beginning of the three wonderful days that yet remained  for Joanne and John Aldous in Donald MacDonald's little valley of gold  and sunshine and blue skies. They were strange and beautiful days,  filled with a great peace and a great happiness, and in them wonderful  changes were at work. On the second day Joanne and Marie rode alone to  the cavern where Jane lay, and when they returned in the golden sun of  the afternoon they were leading their horses, and walking hand in hand.  And when they came down to where DeBar and Aldous and Donald MacDonald  were testing the richness of the black sand along the stream there was  a light in Marie's eyes and a radiance in Joanne's face which told  again that world-old story of a Mary Magdalene and the dawn of another  Day. And now, Aldous thought, Marie had become beautiful; and Joanne  laughed softly and happily that night, and confided many things into  the ears of Aldous, while Marie and DeBar talked for a long time alone  out under the stars, and came back at last hand in hand, like two  children. Before they went to bed Marie whispered something to Joanne,  and a little later Joanne whispered it to Aldous.
  &#8220;They want to know if they can be married with us, John,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;That is, if you haven't grown tired of trying to marry me, dear,&#8221; she  added with a happy laugh. &#8220;Have you?&#8221;
  His answer satisfied her. And when she told a small part of it to  Marie, the other woman's dark eyes grew as soft as the night, and she  whispered the words to Joe.
  The third and last day was the most beautiful of all. Joe's knife  wound was not bad. He had suffered most from a blow on the head. Both  he and Aldous were in condition to travel, and plans were made to begin  the homeward journey on the fourth morning. MacDonald had unearthed  another dozen sacks of the hidden gold, and he explained to Aldous what  must be done to secure legal possession of the little valley. His  manner of doing this was unnatural and strained. His words came  haltingly. There was unhappiness in his eyes. It was in his voice. It  was in the odd droop of his shoulders. And finally, when they were  alone, he said to Aldous, with almost a sob in his voice:
  &#8220;Johnny&#8212;Johnny, if on'y the gold were not here!&#8221;
  He turned his eyes to the mountain, and Aldous took one of his big  gnarled hands in both his own.
  &#8220;Say it, Mac,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;I guess I know what it is.&#8221;
  &#8220;It ain't fair to you, Johnny,&#8221; said old Donald, still with his eyes  on the mountains. &#8220;It ain't fair to you. But when you take out the  claims down there it'll start a rush. You know what it means, Johnny.  There'll be a thousand men up here; an' mebby you can't understand&#8212;but  there's the cavern an' Jane an' the little cabin here; an' it seems  like desecratin'<I> her</I>.&#8221;
  His voice choked, and as Aldous gripped the big hand harder in his  own he laughed.
  &#8220;It would, Mac,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've been watching you while we made the  plans. These cabins and the gold have been here for more than forty  years without discovery, Donald&#8212;and they won't be discovered again so  long as Joe DeBar and John Aldous and Donald MacDonald have a word to  say about it. We'll take out no claims, Mac. The valley isn't ours.  It's Jane's valley and yours!&#8221;
  Joanne, coming up just then, wondered what the two men had been  saying that they stood as they did, with hands clasped. Aldous told  her. And then old Donald confessed to them what was in his mind, and  what he had kept from them. At last he had found his home, and he was  not going to leave it again. He was going to stay with Jane. He was  going to bring her from the cavern and bury her near the cabin, and he  pointed out the spot, covered with wild hyacinths and asters, where she  used to sit on the edge of the stream and watch him while he worked for  gold. And they could return each year and dig for gold, and he would  dig for gold while they were away, and they could have it all. All that  he wanted was enough to eat, and Jane, and the little valley. And  Joanne turned from him as he talked, her face streaming with tears, and  in John's throat was a great lump, and he looked away from MacDonald to  the mountains.
  So it came to pass that on the fourth morning, when they went into  the south, they stopped on the last knoll that shut out the little  valley from the larger valley, and looked back. And Donald MacDonald  stood alone in front of the cabin waving them good-bye.
  THE END
