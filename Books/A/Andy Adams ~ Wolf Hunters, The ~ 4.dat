  By this time it was bitter cold. The lakes and rivers were frozen  deep and a light snow covered the ground. Already two weeks behind  their plans, the young wolf hunters and the old Indian made forced  marches around the northern extremity of Lake Nipigon and on the sixth  day found themselves on the Ombabika River, where they were compelled  to stop on account of a dense snow-storm. A temporary camp was made,  and it was while constructing this camp that Mukoki discovered signs of  wolves. It was therefore decided to remain for a day or two and  investigate the hunting-grounds. On the morning of the second day Wabi  shot at and wounded the old bull moose which met such a tragic end a  few hours later, and that same morning the two boys made a long tour to  the north in the hope of finding that they were in a good game country,  which would mean also that there were plenty of wolves.
  This left Mukoki alone in camp. Thus far, in their desire to cover  as much ground as possible before the heavy snows came, Wabi and his  companions had not stopped to hunt for game and for six days their only  meat had been bacon and jerked venison. Mukoki, whose prodigious  appetite was second only to the shrewdness with which he stalked game  to satisfy it, determined to add to their larder if possible during the  others' absence, and with this object in view he left camp late in the  afternoon to be gone, as he anticipated, not longer than an hour or so.
  With him he carried two powerful wolf-traps slung over his  shoulders. Stealing cautiously along the edge of the river, his eyes  and ears alert for game, Mukoki suddenly came upon the frozen and  half-eaten carcass of a red deer. It was evident that the animal had  been killed by wolves either the day or night before, and from the  tracks in the snow the Indian concluded that not more than four wolves  had participated in the slaughter and feast. That these wolves would  return to continue their banquet, probably that night, Mukoki's many  experiences as a wolf hunter assured him; and he paused long enough to  set his traps, afterward covering them over with three or four inches  of snow.
  Continuing his hunt, the old Indian soon struck the fresh spoor of a  deer. Believing that the animal would not travel for any great distance  in the deep snow, he swiftly took up the trail. Half a mile farther on  he stopped abruptly with a grunt of unbounded surprise. Another hunter  had taken up the trail!
  With increased caution Mukoki now advanced. Two hundred feet more  and a second pair of moccasined feet joined in the pursuit, and a  little later still a third!
  Led on by curiosity more than by the hope of securing a partnership  share in the quarry, the Indian slipped silently and swiftly through  the forest. As he emerged from a dense growth of spruce through which  the tracks led him Mukoki was treated to another surprise by almost  stumbling over the carcass of the deer he had been following. A brief  examination satisfied him that the doe had been shot at least two hours  before. The three hunters had cut out her heart, liver and tongue and  had also taken the hind quarters, leaving the remainder of the carcass  and the skin! Why had they neglected this most valuable part of their  spoils? With a new gleam of interest in his eyes Mukoki carefully  scrutinized the moccasin trails. He soon discovered that the Indians  ahead of him were in great haste, and that after cutting the choicest  meat from the doe they had started off to make up for lost time by  running!
  With another grunt of astonishment the old Indian returned to the  carcass, quickly stripped off the skin, wrapped in it the fore quarters  and ribs of the doe, and thus loaded, took up the home trail. It was  dark when he reached camp. Wabi and Rod had not yet returned. Building  a huge fire and hanging the ribs of the doe on a spit before it, he  anxiously awaited their appearance.
  Half an hour later he heard the shout which brought him quickly to  where Wabi was holding the partly unconscious form of Rod in his arms.
  It took but a few moments to carry the injured youth to camp, and  not until Rod was resting upon a pile of blankets in their shack, with  the warmth of the fire reviving him, did Wabi vouchsafe an explanation  to the old Indian.
  &#8220;I guess he's got a broken arm, Muky,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have you any hot  water?&#8221;
  &#8220;Shot?&#8221; asked the old hunter, paying no attention to the question.  He dropped upon his knees beside Rod, his long brown fingers reaching  out anxiously. &#8220;Shot?&#8221;
  &#8220;No&#8212;hit with a club. We met three Indian hunters who were in camp  and who invited us to eat with them. While we were eating they jumped  upon our backs. Rod got that&#8212;and lost his rifle!&#8221;
  Mukoki quickly stripped the wounded boy of his garments, baring his  left arm and side. The arm was swollen and almost black and there was a  great bruise on Rod's body a little above the waist. Mukoki was a  surgeon by necessity, a physician such as one finds only in the vast  unblazed wildernesses, where Nature is the teacher. Crudely he made his  examination, pinching and twisting the flesh and bones until Rod cried  out in pain, but in the end there was a glad triumph in his voice as he  said:
  &#8220;No bone broke&#8212;hurt most here!&#8221; and he touched the bruise. &#8220;Near  broke rib&#8212;not quite. Took wind out and made great deal sick. Want good  supper, hot coffee&#8212;rub in bear's grease, then be better!&#8221;
  Rod, who had opened his eyes, smiled faintly and Wabi gave a  half-shout of delight.
  &#8220;Not so bad as we thought, eh, Rod?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You can't fool Muky!  If he says your arm isn't broken&#8212;why, it<I> isn't</I>, and that's all  there is to it. Let me bolster you up in these blankets and we'll soon  have a supper that will sizzle the aches out of you. I smell  meat&#8212;fresh meat!&#8221;
  With a chuckle of pleasure Mukoki jumped to his feet and ran out to  where the ribs of the doe were slowly broiling over the fire. They were  already done to a rich brown and their dripping juice filled the  nostrils with an appetizing odor. By the time Wabi had applied Mukoki's  prescription to his comrade's wounds, and had done them up in bandages,  the tempting feast was spread before them.
  As a liberal section of the ribs was placed before him, together  with corn-meal cakes and a cup of steaming coffee, Rod could not  suppress a happy though somewhat embarrassed laugh.
  &#8220;I'm ashamed of myself, Wabi,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Here I've been causing so  much bother, like some helpless kid; and now I find I haven't even the  excuse of a broken arm, and that I'm as hungry as a bear! Looks pretty  yellow, doesn't it? Just as though I was scared to death! So help me, I  almost wish my arm<I> was</I> broken!&#8221;
  Mukoki had buried his teeth in a huge chunk of fat rib, but he  lowered it with a great chuckling grunt, half of his face smeared with  the first results of his feast.
  &#8220;Whole lot sick,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Be sick some more&#8212;mighty sick!  Maybe vomit lots!&#8221;
  &#8220;Waugh!&#8221; shrieked Wabi. &#8220;How is that for cheerful news, Rod?&#8221; His  merriment echoed far out into the night. Suddenly he caught himself and  peered suspiciously into the gloom beyond the circle of firelight.
  &#8220;Do you suppose they would follow?&#8221; he asked.
  A more cautious silence followed, and the Indian youth quickly  related the adventures of the day to Mukoki&#8212;how, in the heart of the  forest several miles beyond the lake, they had come upon the Indian  hunters, had accepted of their seemingly honest hospitality, and in the  midst of their meal had suffered an attack from them. So sudden and  unexpected had been the assault that one of the Indians got away with  Rod's rifle, ammunition belt and revolver before any effort could be  made to stop him. Wabi was under the other two Indians when Rod came to  his assistance, with the result that the latter was struck two heavy  blows, either with a club or a gun-stock. So tenaciously had the Indian  boy clung to his own weapon that his assailants, after a brief  struggle, darted into the dense underbrush, evidently satisfied with  the white boy's equipment.
  &#8220;They were of Woonga's people, without a doubt,&#8221; finished Wabi. &#8220;It  puzzles me why they didn't kill us. They had half a dozen chances to  shoot us, but didn't seem to want to do us any great injury. Either the  measures taken at the Post are making them reform, or&#8212;&#8221;
  He paused, a troubled look in his eyes. Immediately Mukoki told of  his own experience and of the mysterious haste of the three Indians who  had slain the doe.
  &#8220;It is certainly curious,&#8221; rejoined the young Indian. &#8220;They couldn't  have been the ones we met, but I'll wager they belong to the same gang.  I wouldn't be surprised if we had hit upon one of Woonga's retreats.  We've always thought he was in the Thunder Bay regions to the west, and  that is where father is watching for him now. We've hit the hornets'  nest, Muky, and the only thing for us to do is to get out of this  country as fast as we can!&#8221;
  &#8220;We'd make a nice pot-shot just at this moment,&#8221; volunteered Rod,  looking across to the dense blackness on the opposite side of the  river, where the moonlight seemed to make even more impenetrable the  wall of gloom.
  As he spoke there came a slight sound from behind him, the commotion  of a body moving softly beyond the wall of spruce boughs, then a  curious, suspicious sniffing, and after that a low whine.
  &#8220;Listen!&#8221;
  Wabi's command came in a tense whisper. He leaned close against the  boughs, stealthily parted them, and slowly thrust his head through the  aperture.
  &#8220;Hello, Wolf!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;What's up?&#8221;
  An arm's length away, tied before a smaller shelter of spruce, a  gaunt, dog-like animal stood in a rigid listening attitude. An  instant's glance, however, would have assured one that it was not a  dog, but a full-grown wolf. From the days of its puppyhood Wabi had  taught it in the ways of dogdom, yet had the animal perversely clung to  its wild instincts. A weakness in that thong, a slip of the collar, and  Wolf would have bounded joyously into the forests to seek for ever the  packs of his fathers. Now the babeesh rope was taut, Wolf's muzzle was  turned half to the sky, his ears were alert, half-sounding notes  rattled in his throat.
  &#8220;There is something near our camp!&#8221; announced the Indian boy,  drawing himself back quickly. &#8220;Muky&#8212;&#8221;
  He was interrupted by a long mournful howl from the captive wolf.
  Mukoki had jumped to his feet with the alertness of a cat, and now  with his gun in his hand slunk around the edge of the shelter and  buried himself in the gloom. Roderick lay quiet while Wabi, seizing the  remaining rifle, followed him.
  &#8220;Lie over there in the dark, Rod, where the firelight doesn't show  you up,&#8221; he cautioned in a low voice. &#8220;Probably it is only some animal  that has stumbled on to our camp, but we want to make sure.&#8221;
  Ten minutes later the young hunter returned alone.
  &#8220;False alarm!&#8221; he laughed cheerfully. &#8220;There's a part of a carcass  of a red deer up the creek a bit. It has been killed by wolves, and  Wolf smells some of his own blood coming in to the feast. Muky has set  traps there and we may have our first scalp in the morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where is Mukoki?&#8221;
  &#8220;On watch. He is going to keep guard until a little after midnight,  and then I'll turn out. We can't be too careful, with the Woongas in  the neighborhood.&#8221;
  Rod shifted himself uneasily.
  &#8220;What shall we do&#8212;to-morrow?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Get out!&#8221; replied Wabi with emphasis. &#8220;That is, if you are able to  travel. From what Mukoki tells me, and from what you and I already  know, Woonga's people must be in the forests beyond the lake. We'll cut  a trail up the Ombabika for two or three days before we strike camp.  You and Muky can start out as soon as it is light enough.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you&#8212;&#8221; began Rod.
  &#8220;Oh, I'm going to take a run back over our old wolf-trail and  collect the scalps we shot to-day. There's a month's salary back there  for you, Rod! Now, let's turn in. Good night&#8212;sleep tight&#8212;and be sure  to wake up early in the morning.&#8221;
  The boys, exhausted by the adventures of the day, were soon in  profound slumber. And though midnight came, and hour after hour passed  between then and dawn, the faithful Mukoki did not awaken them. Never  for a moment neglecting his caution the old Indian watched tirelessly  over the camp. With the first appearance of day he urged the fire into  a roaring blaze, raked out a great mass of glowing coals, and proceeded  to get breakfast. Wabi discovered him at this task when he awoke from  his slumber.
  &#8220;I didn't think you would play this trick on me, Muky,&#8221; he said, a  flush of embarrassment gathering in his brown face. &#8220;It's awfully good  of you, and all that, but I wish you wouldn't treat me as if I were a  child any longer, old friend!&#8221;
  He placed his hand affectionately upon the kneeling Mukoki's  shoulder, and the old hunter looked up at him with a happy, satisfied  grin on his weather-beaten visage, wrinkled and of the texture of  leather by nearly fifty years of life in the wilderness. It was Mukoki  who had first carried the baby Wabi about the woods upon his shoulders;  it was he who had played with him, cared for him, and taught him in the  ways of the wild in early childhood, and it was he who had missed him  most, with little Minnetaki, when he went away to school. All the love  in the grim old redskin's heart was for the Indian youth and his  sister, and to them Mukoki was a second father, a silent, watchful  guardian and comrade. This one loving touch of Wabi's hand was ample  reward for the long night's duty, and his pleasure expressed itself in  two or three low chuckling grunts.
  &#8220;Had heap bad day,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Very much tired. Me feel  good&#8212;better than sleep!&#8221; He rose to his feet and handed Wabi the long  fork with which he manipulated the meat on the spits. &#8220;You can tend to  that,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I go see traps.&#8221;
  Rod, who had awakened and overheard these last remarks, called out  from the shack:
  &#8220;Wait a minute, Mukoki. I'm going with you. If you've got a wolf, I  want to see him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Got one sure 'nuff,&#8221; grinned the old Indian.
  In a few minutes Rod came out, fully dressed and with a much  healthier color in his face than when he went to bed the preceding  night. He stood before the fire, stretched one arm then the other, gave  a slight grimace of pain, and informed his anxious comrades that he  seemed to be as well as ever, except that his arm and side were very  sore.
  Walking slowly, that Rod might &#8220;find himself,&#8221; as Wabi expressed it,  the two went up the river. It was a dull gray morning and occasionally  large flakes of snow fell, giving evidence that before the day was far  advanced another storm would set in. Mukoki's traps were not more than  an eighth of a mile from camp, and as the two rounded a certain bend in  the river the old hunter suddenly stopped with a huge grant of  satisfaction. Following the direction in which he pointed Rod saw a  dark object lying in the snow a short distance away.
  &#8220;That's heem!&#8221; exclaimed the Indian.
  As they approached, the object became animate, pulling and tearing  in the snow as though in the agonies of death. A few moments more and  they were close up to the captive.
  &#8220;She wolf!&#8221; explained Mukoki.
  He gripped the ax he had brought with him and approached within a  few feet of the crouching animal. Rod could see that one of the big  steel traps had caught the wolf on the forward leg and that the other  had buried its teeth in one of the hind legs. Thus held the doomed  animal could make little effort to protect itself and crouched in  sullen quiet, its white fangs gleaming in a noiseless, defiant snarl,  its eyes shining with pain and anger, and with only its thin starved  body, which jerked and trembled as the Indian came nearer, betraying  signs of fear. To Rod it might have been a pitiful sight had not there  come to him a thought of the preceding night and of his own and Wabi's  narrow escape from the pack.
  Two or three quick blows of the ax and the wolf was dead. With a  skill which can only be found among those of his own race, Mukoki drew  his knife, cut deftly around the wolf's head just below the ears, and  with one downward, one upward, and two sidewise jerks tore off the  scalp.
  Suddenly, without giving a thought to his speech, there shot from  Rod,
  &#8220;Is that the way you scalp people?&#8221;
  Mukoki looked up, his jaw fell&#8212;and then he gave the nearest thing  to a real laugh that Rod ever heard come from between his lips. When  Mukoki laughed it was usually in a half-chuckle, a  half-gurgle&#8212;something that neither Rod nor Wabi could have imitated if  they had tried steadily for a month.
  &#8220;Never scalped white people,&#8221; the old Indian shot back. &#8220;Father did  when&#8212;young man. Did great scalp business!&#8221;
  Mukoki had not done chuckling to himself even when they reached  camp.
  Scarcely ten minutes were taken in eating breakfast. Snow was  already beginning to fall, and if the hunters took up their trail at  once their tracks would undoubtedly be entirely obliterated by midday,  which was the best possible thing that could happen for them in the  Woonga country. On the other hand, Wabi was anxious to follow back over  the wolf-trail before the snow shut it in. There was no danger of their  becoming separated and lost, for it was agreed that Rod and Mukoki  should travel straight up the frozen river. Wabi would overtake them  before nightfall.
  Arming himself with his rifle, revolver, knife, and a keen-edged  belt-ax, the Indian boy lost no time in leaving camp. A quarter of an  hour later Wabi came out cautiously on the end of the lake where had  occurred the unequal duel between the old bull moose and the wolves. A  single glance told him what the outcome of that duel had been. Twenty  rods out upon the snow he saw parts of a great skeleton, and a huge  pair of antlers.
  As he stood on the arena of the mighty battle, Wabi would have given  a great deal if Rod could have been with him. There lay the heroic old  moose, now nothing more than a skeleton. But the magnificent head and  horns still remained&#8212;the largest head that the Indian youth, in all  his wilderness life, had ever seen&#8212;and it occurred to him that if this  head could be preserved and taken back to civilization it would be  worth a hundred dollars or more. That the old bull had put up a  magnificent fight was easily discernible. Fifty feet away were the  bones of a wolf, and almost under the skeleton of the moose were those  of another. The heads of both still remained, and Wabi, after taking  their scalps, hurried on over the trail.
  Half-way across the lake, where he had taken his last two shots,  were the skeletons of two more wolves, and in the edge of the spruce  forest he found another. This animal had evidently been wounded farther  back and had later been set upon by some of the pack and killed. Half a  mile deeper in the forest he came upon a spot where he had emptied five  shells into the pack and here he found the bones of two more wolves. He  had seven scalps in his possession when he turned back over the home  trail.
  Beside the remains of the old bull Wabi paused again. He knew that  the Indians frequently preserved moose and caribou heads through the  winter by keeping them frozen, and the head at his feet was a prize  worth some thought. But how could he keep it preserved until their  return, months later? He could not suspend it from the limb of a tree,  as was the custom when in camp, for it would either be stolen by some  passing hunter or spoiled by the first warm days of spring. Suddenly an  idea came to him. Why could it not be preserved in what white hunters  called an &#8220;Indian ice-box&#8221;? In an instant he was acting upon this  inspiration. It was not a small task to drag the huge head to the  shelter of the tamaracks, where, safely hidden from view, he made a  closer examination. The head was gnawed considerably by the wolves, but  Wabi had seen worse ones skillfully repaired by the Indians at the  Post.
  Under a dense growth of spruce, where the rays of the sun seldom  penetrated, the Indian boy set to work with his belt-ax. For an hour  and a half he worked steadily, and at the end of that time had dug a  hole in the frozen earth three feet deep and four feet square. This  hole he now lined with about two inches of snow, packed as tight as he  could jam it with the butt of his gun. Then placing in the head he  packed snow closely about it and afterward filled in the earth,  stamping upon the hard chunks with his feet. When all was done he  concealed the signs of his work under a covering of snow, blazed two  trees with his ax, and resumed his journey.
  &#8220;There is thirty dollars for each of us if there's a cent,&#8221; he mused  softly, as he hurried toward the Ombabika. &#8220;That ground won't thaw out  until June. A moose-head and eight scalps at fifteen dollars each isn't  bad for one day's work, Rod, old boy!&#8221;
  He had been absent for three hours. It had been snowing steadily and  by the time he reached their old camp the trail left by Rod and Mukoki  was already partly obliterated, showing that they had secured an early  start up the river.
  Bowing his head in the white clouds falling silently about him, Wabi  started in swift pursuit. He could not see ten rods ahead of him, so  dense was the storm, and at times one side or the other of the river  was lost to view. Conditions could not have been better for their  flight out of the Woonga country, thought the young hunter. By  nightfall they would be many miles up the river, and no sign would be  left behind to reveal their former presence or to show in which  direction they had gone. For two hours he followed tirelessly over the  trail, which became more and more distinct as he proceeded, showing  that he was rapidly gaining on his comrades. But even now, though the  trail was fresher and deeper, so disguised had it become by falling  snow that a passing hunter might have thought a moose or caribou had  passed that way.
  At the end of the third hour, by which time he figured that he had  made at least ten miles, Wabi sat down to rest, and to refresh himself  with the lunch which he had taken from the camp that morning. He was  surprised at Rod's endurance. That Mukoki and the white boy were still  three or four miles ahead of him he did not doubt, unless they, too,  had stopped for dinner. This, on further thought, he believed was  highly probable.
  The wilderness about him was intensely still. Not even the twitter  of a snow-bird marred its silence. For a long time Wabi sat as  immovable as the log upon which he had seated himself, resting and  listening. Such a day as this held a peculiar and unusual fascination  for him. It was as if the whole world was shut out, and that even the  wild things of the forest dared not go abroad in this supreme moment of  Nature's handiwork, when with lavish hand she spread the white mantle  that was to stretch from the border to Hudson Bay.
  As he listened there came to him suddenly a sound that forced from  between his lips a half-articulate cry. It was the clear, ringing  report of a rifle! And following it there came another, and another,  until in quick succession he had counted five!
  What did it mean? He sprang to his feet, his heart thumping, every  nerve in him prepared for action. He would have sworn it was Mukoki's  rifle&#8212;yet Mukoki would not have fired at game! They had agreed upon  that.
  Had Rod and the old Indian been attacked? In another instant Wabi  was bounding over the trail with the speed of a deer.
