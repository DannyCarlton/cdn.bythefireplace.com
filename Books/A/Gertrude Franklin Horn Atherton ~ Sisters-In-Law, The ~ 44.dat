Gora's novel was published in February. Aileen Lawton, Sibyl Bascom, Alice  Thorndyke, Polly Roberts, and Janet Maynard organized a campaign to make it  the fashion. They went about with copies under their arms, on the street,  in the shops, at luncheons, even at the matinee, and "could talk of nothing  else." Sibyl and Janet bought a dozen copies each and sent them to friends  and acquaintances with the advice to read it at once unless they wished to  be hopelessly out of date: it was "all the rage in New York."    
As a matter of fact, with the exception of Aileen and possibly Janet, the  book almost terrified them with its pounding vigor and grim relentless  logic, even its romantic realism, which made its tragedy more poignant and  sinister by contrast; and, again with the exception of Aileen, they were  little interested in Gora. But they were loyally devoted to Alexina and  obeyed, as a matter of course, her request to help her make the book a  success. They worked with the sterner determination as Alexina in her own  efforts was obliged to be extremely subtle.    
Besides, it, was rather thrilling not only to know a real, author but  almost to have her in the family as it were. Their industrious sowing bore  an abundant harvest and Gora's novel became the fashion. Whether people  hated it or not, and most of them did, they discussed it continually, and  when a book meets with that happy fate personal opinions matter little.

Maria thought the book was "awful" and forbade Joan to read it. Joan  thought (to Alexina) that it was simply the most terribly fascinating book  she had ever read and made her despise society more than ever and more  determined to light out and see life for herself first chance she got. Tom  Abbott thought it a remarkable book for a woman to have written; a man  might have written it. Judge Lawton read it twice. Mortimer declined to  read it. He had not forgiven Gora; moreover, although his social position  was now planetary, it annoyed him excessively to hear his sister alluded to  continually as an author. Even the men at the club were reading the damned  book.

Bohemia stood off for some time. It was only recently they had learned that  Gora Dwight was a Californian. They had read her stories, but as she had  been the subject of no publicity whatever they had inferred that, like many  another, she had dwelt in their midst only long enough to acquire material.  When they learned the truth, and particularly after her inescapable  novel appeared, they were indignant that she had not sought her muse at  Carmel-by-the-Sea, or some other center of mutual admiration; affiliated  herself; announced herself, at the very least. There was a very sincere  feeling among them that any attempt on the part of a rank outsider to  achieve literary distinction was impertinent as well as unjustifiable....It  was impossible that he or she could be the real thing.    
When they discovered that she was affiliated more or less with fashionable  society, nurse though she might be, and that those frivolous and negligible  beings were not only buying her book by the ton but giving her luncheons  and dinners and teas, their disgust knew no bounds and they tacitly agreed  that she should be tabu in the only circles where recognition counted.    
<b>IV</b>    
But Gora, who barely knew of their existence, little recked that she had  been weighed, judged, and condemned. Her old dream had come true. Society,  the society which should have been her birthright and was not, had thrown  open its doors to her at last and everybody was outdoing everybody else in  flattering and entertaining her.    
Not that she was deceived for a moment as to the nature of her success with  the majority of the people whose names twinkled so brightly in the social  heavens. She more than suspected the "plot" but cared little for the  original impulse of the book's phenomenal success in San Francisco and  its distinguished faubourgs. She was square with her pride, her youthful  bitterness had its tardy solace, her family name was rescued from  obscurity. She knew that this belated triumph rang hollow, and that she  really cared very little about it; but the strength and tenacity of her  nature alone would have forced her to quaff every drop of the cup so long  withheld. Even if she had been desperately bored she would have accepted  these invitations to houses so long indifferent to her existence, and as a  matter of fact she welcomed the sudden lapse into frivolity after her years  of hard and almost unremitting work. She had played little in her life; and  a year later when she was working eighteen hours a day without rest, in  conditions that seemed to have leapt into life from the blackest pages of  history, she looked back upon her one brief interval of irresponsibility,  gratified vanity, and bodily indolence, as at a bright star low on the  horizon of a dark and terrible night.    
<b>V</b>    
There was one small group of women, Gora soon discovered, that stood for  something besides amusement, sharply as some of them were identified with  all that was brilliant in the social life of the city. They read all that  was best in serious literature and fiction as soon after it came out as  their treadmill would permit, and they gave somewhat more time to it than  to poker. It was this small group, led by Mrs. Hunter, that in common with  several wealthy and clever Jewish women, with intellectual members of old  families that had long since dropped out of a society that gave them too  little to be worth the drain on their limited means, and with one or two  presidents of women's clubs, made up the small attendance at the lectures  on literary and political subjects, delivered either by some local light,  or European specialist in the art of charming the higher intelligence of  American women without subjecting it to undue fatigue.    
This small but distinguished band discussed Gora separately and  collectively and placed the seal of approval upon her. With them her  arrival was genuine and permanent.    
It was hardly a step from their favor to the many women's clubs of the  city, and she was invited to be the luncheon or afternoon guest at one  after another until all had entertained the rising star and she had learned  to make the little speeches expected of her without turning to ice.

The local intelligenzia, those that assured one another how great were each  and all, and whose poems or stories found an occasional hospitality in the  eastern magazines, who toiled over "precious" paragraphs of criticism or  whose single achievement had been a play for the mid-summer jinks of the  Bohemian Club; these and their associates, the artists and sculptors, still  held aloof, more and more annoyed that Gora Dwight should have had the bad  taste to be discovered by the Philistines, and should be flying across the  high heavens in spite of their tabu.    
Gora had gradually become aware of their existence, and their attitude,  which both amused and piqued her. She knew now that if she had been one of  them they would have beaten the big drum and proclaimed to the world (of  California) that she was "great," "a genius," the legitimate successor of  Ambrose Bierce, whom she remotely resembled, and Bret Harte, whom she  did not resemble at all. This they would have done if only to prove that  California no longer "knocked" as in the mordant nineties, nor waited for  the anile East to set the seal of its dry approval before discovering that  a new volcano was sending forth its fiery swords in their midst.    
But it was extremely doubtful if society and upper club circles would have  taken any notice of her. Both had acquired the habit, however unjustly, of  regarding their local intelligenzia (with the exception of the few who kept  themselves wholly apart from all groups) as worshipers of small gods,  and preferred to take their cues from London or New York. They plumed  themselves upon having discovered Gora Dwight and sometimes wondered how it  had happened.    
But Bohemia is hardly a trades union; it is indeed anarchistic and knows  no boss. Gora might not be invited to Carmel this many a day, nor yet to  Berkeley, nor to sundry other parnassi, but there was one club in San  Francisco whose curiosity got the better of it, and she was invited to  be the guest of the evening at the home of the Seven Arts Club on the  twentieth of April in the fateful year of nineteen-fourteen.    
<b>VII</b>    
The Seven Arts Club had been organized by a group of painters, architects,  authors, sculptors, musicians, actors and poets, most of whom had long  since found various degrees of fame and moved to New York, Europe, or the  romantic wilderness.    
It still had seventy times seven votaries of the seven arts on its list and  few had found fame as yet outside their hospitable state--where log-rolling  is as amiable as the climate--but all save the elders were expecting it and  many made a fair living. They met once a week, and a part of the evening  pleasure of the literary wing was to "place" authors. They were willing to  swallow the British authors whole (they did in fact "discover" one or  two of them, as the musical critics had discovered such a rara avis as  Tetrazzini, or the dramatic critics many a now famous player); but they  were excessively critical of all who owed their origin to the United States  of America, and particularly of those who had loved and lost the sovereign  state of California.    
Naturally all were more or less radical (except the cynical and now  somewhat anaemic elders who gave up hope for a world that had ceased to  hold out hope to them). The artists were disturbed by futurism and cubism,  although as neither paid they were forced to devote the greater part of  their inspiration to the marketable California scenery.    
But the writers: potential or locally arrived novelists, playwrights,  poets, essayists, were the real intelligenzia! They went about with the  radical weeklies of the East (or Berkeley) under their arms and discoursed  under their breath (when foregathered in small and ardent groups) upon The  Revolution, the day of Judgment for all but honest Labor, and hissed  their hatred of Capital. And if they had much in common with those  "intellectuals" to be found in every land who caress the chin of radicalism  with one hand and plunge the other into the pocket of capital as far as  permitted, who shall blame them? One must live and one must have something  to excite one's intellect when sex, the stand-by, takes its well-earned  rest.    
Several of these ardent ladies and gentlemen, with the sanction of the  Club's President, a business man whose contributions were the financial  mainstay of the Seven Arts, and who sincerely envied the gifted members,  denying them nothing, invited James Kirkpatrick to be the guest of an  evening and deliver an address on Socialism and the Proletariat. He replied  that he would come and spit on them if they liked but that he had as much  use for parlor socialists as he had for damned fools and posers of any  sort. Life was too short. As for Labor it knew how to take care of itself  and had about as crying a need of their "support" as a healthy human body  had of lice and other parasites.    
They were not discouraged however, merely pronouncing him a "creature,"  and were not at all flattered or surprised when Gora Dwight accepted their  invitation and asked permission to bring her friends, Mrs. Mortimer Dwight  and Miss Aileen Lawton.
