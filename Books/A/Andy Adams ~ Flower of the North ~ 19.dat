  To be alone, even after the painful parting with Pierre, was in   one way a relief to Philip, for with the disappearance of the  lonely  half-breed over the mountain there had gone from him the  last physical  association that bound him to Jeanne and her people.  With Pierre at  his side, Jeanne was still with him; but now that  Pierre was gone  there came a change in him&#8212;one of those  unaccountable transmutations  of the mind which make the passing of  yesterdays more like a short  dream than a long and full reality.  He walked slowly over the plain,  and, when he came to the trail  beaten by the hoofs of his own teams he  followed it mechanically.  In his measurement of things now, it seemed  only a few hours since  he had traveled over this trail on his way to  Fort Churchill; it  might, have been that morning, or the morning  before. The weeks of  his absence had passed with marvelous swiftness,  now that he  looked back upon them. They seemed short and trivial. And  yet he  knew that in those weeks he had lived more of his life than he  had  ever lived before, or would ever live again. For a brief spell   life had been, filled with joy and hope&#8212;a promise of happiness  which  a single moment in the shadow of the Sun Rock had destroyed  forever.  He had seen Jeanne in another man's arms; he had read the  confirmation  of his fears in Pierre's grief-distorted face, in the  strange tremble  of his voice, in the words that he had spoken. He  was sorry for  Pierre. He would have been glad if that other man  had been the lovable  half-breed; if Jeanne, in the poetry of life  and love, had given  herself to the one who had saved the spark of  life in her chilled  little body years and years ago. And yet in  his own grief he  unconsciously rejoiced that it was a man like  Pierre who suffered with  him. 
  This thought of Pierre strengthened him, and he walked faster, and   breathed more deeply of the clear night air. He had lost in the  fight  for Jeanne as he had lost in many other fights; but, after  all, there  was another and bigger fight ahead of him, which he  would begin  to-morrow. Thoughts of his men, of his camps, and of  this struggle  through which he must pass to achieve success raised  him above his  depression, and stirred his blood with a growing  exhilaration. And  Jeanne&#8212;was she hopelessly lost to him? He dared  to ask himself the  question half an hour after he had separated  from Pierre, and his mind  flew back to the portrait-room where he  had told Jeanne of his love,  and where for a moment he had seen in  her eyes and face the sweet  surrender that had given him a glimpse  of his paradise. But what did  the sudden change mean? And after  that&#8212;the scene in the starlight? 
  A quickening of his pulse was the answer to these questions.   Jeanne had told him there were only two men at Fort o' God, Pierre   and her father. Then who could be this third? A lover, whom she  met  clandestinely? He shivered, and began loading his pipe as he  walked.  He was certain that the master of Fort o' God did not know  of the  tryst beyond the rock, and he was equally certain that the  girl was  unaware of Pierre's knowledge of the meeting. Pierre had  remained  hidden, like himself, and he had given Philip to  understand that it  was not the first time he had looked upon the  meetings of Jeanne and  the man they had seen from the shadow of  the rock. And yet, in spite  of all evidence, he could not lose  faith in Jeanne. 
  Suddenly he saw something ahead of him which changed for a moment   the uncomfortable trend of his thoughts. It was a pale streak,  rising  above the level of the trail, and stretching diagonally  across the  plain to the east. With an exclamation of surprise  Philip hastened his  steps, and a moment later stood among the  fresh workings of his men.  When he had left for Churchill this  streak, which was the last stretch  of road-bed between them and  the surveyed line of the Hudson's Bay  Railway, had ended two miles  to the south and west. In a little over a  month MacDougall had  pushed it on the trail, and well across it in the  direction of  Gray Beaver Lake. In that time he had accomplished a work  which  Philip had not thought possible to achieve that autumn. He had   figured that the heavy snows of winter would cut them off at the   trail. And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to   spare! 
  Something rose up in his blood, warming him with an elation which   sent him walking swiftly toward the end of the road-bed. A quarter  of  a mile out on the plain he came to the working end. About him  were  scattered half a dozen big scoop shovels and piles of working  tools.  The embers of a huge log fire still glowed where dinner had  been  cooked for the men. Philip stood for a few moments, looking  off into  the distance. Another mile and a half out there was the  Gray Beaver,  and from the Gray Beaver there lay the unbroken  waterway to the point  of their conjunction with the railway coming  up from the south. A  sudden idea occurred to Philip. If MacDougall  had built two and a  quarter miles of road-bed in five weeks they  could surely complete  this other mile and a half before winter  stopped them. In that event,  they would have fifteen miles of  road, linking seven lakes, which  would give them a splendid winter  trail for men, teams, and dogs to  the Gray Beaver. And from the  Gray Beaver they would have smooth ice  for twenty miles, to the  new road. He had not planned to begin fishing  operations until  spring, but he could see no reason now why they  should not  commence that winter, setting their nets through the ice.  At  Lobstick Creek, where the new road would reach them sometime in   April or May, they could freeze their fish and keep them in  storage.  Five hundred tons in stock, and perhaps a thousand, would  not be a bad  beginning. It would mean from forty to eighty  thousand dollars, a half  of which could be paid out in dividends. 
  He turned back, whistling softly. There was new life in him,   burning for action. He was eager to see MacDougall, and he hoped  that  Brokaw would not be long in reaching Blind Indian Lake.  Before he  reached the trail he was planning the accommodation  stations, where  men and animals could find shelter. There would be  one on the shore of  the Gray Beaver, and from there he would build  them at regular  intervals of five miles on the ice. 
  He had come to the trail, and was about to turn in the direction   of the camp, when he saw a shadowy figure making its way slowly   across the plain which he had traversed half an hour before. The   manner in which this person was following in his footsteps,   apparently with extreme caution, caused Philip to move quickly  behind  the embankment of the road-bed. Two or three minutes later  a man  crossed into view. Philip could not see his face distinctly,  but by  the tired droop of the stranger's shoulders and his  shuffling walk he  guessed that what he had first taken for caution  was in reality the  tedious progress of a man nearing exhaustion.  He wondered how he had  missed him in his own journey over the  trail from the ridge mountains,  for he had made twice the progress  of the stranger, and must surely  have passed him somewhere within  the last mile or so. The fact that  the man had come from the  direction of Fort o' God, that he was  exhausted, and that he had  evidently concealed himself a little way  back to avoid discovery,  led Philip to cut out diagonally across the  plain so that he could  follow him and keep him in sight without being  observed. Twice in  the next mile the nocturnal traveler stopped to  rest, but no  sooner had he reached the first scattered shacks of the  camp than  he quickened his steps, darting quickly among the shadows,  and  then stopped at last before the door of a small log cabin within a   pistol-shot of Philip's own headquarters. The cabin was newly  built,  and Philip gave a low whistle of surprise as he noted its  location. He  had, to a certain degree, isolated his own camp home,  building it a  couple of hundred yards back from the shore of the  lake, where most of  the other cabins were erected. This new cabin  was still a hundred  yards farther back, half hidden in a growth of  spruce. He heard the  click of a key in a lock and the opening and  closing of a door. A  moment later a light flared dimly against a  curtained window. 
  Philip hurried across the open to the cabin occupied by himself   and MacDougall, the engineer. He tried the door, but it was  barred.  Then he knocked loudly, and continued knocking until a  light appeared  within. He heard the Scotchman's voice, close to  the door. 
  &quot;Who's there?&quot; it demanded. 
  &quot;None of your business!&quot; retorted Philip, falling into the error   of a joke at the welcome sound of MacDougall's voice. &quot;Open up!&quot; 
  A bar slipped within. The door opened slowly. Philip thrust   himself against it and entered. In the pale light of the lamp he  was  confronted by the red face of MacDougall, and a pair of little  eyes  that gleamed menacingly. And on a line with MacDougall's face  was an  ugly-looking revolver. 
  Philip stopped with a sudden uncomfortable thrill. MacDougall   lowered his gun. 
  &quot;Lord preserve us, but that's the time you almost drew a   perforation!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It isn't safe to cut-up in these   diggings any more&#8212;not with Sandy MacDougall!&quot; 
  He held out a hand with a relieved laugh, and the two men shook in   a grip that made their fingers ache. 
  &quot;Is this the way you welcome all of your friends, Mac?&quot; 
  MacDougall shrugged his shoulders and laid his gun on a table in   the center of the room. 
  &quot;Can't say that I've got a friend left in camp,&quot; he said, with a   curious grimace. &quot;What in thunder do you mean, Phil? I've tried to   reason something out of it, but I can't!&quot; 
  Philip was hanging up his cap and coat on one of a number of   wooden pegs driven into the long wall. He turned quickly. 
  &quot;Reason something out of what?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Your instructions from Churchill,&quot; replied MacDougall, picking up   a big, black-bowled pipe from the table. 
  Philip sat down with a restful sigh, crossed his legs, loaded his   pipe, and lighted it. 
  &quot;Thought I made myself lucid enough, even for a Scotchman, Sandy,&quot;   he said. &quot;I learned at Churchill that the big fight is going to be   pulled off mighty soon. It's about time for the fireworks. So I  told  you to put the sub-camps in fighting shape, and arm every  responsible  man in this camp. There's going to be a whole lot of  gun-work before  you're many days older. Great Scott, man, don't  you understand NOW?  What's the matter?&quot; 
  MacDougall was staring at him as if struck dumb. 
  &quot;You told me&#8212;to arm&#8212;the camps?&quot; he gasped. 
  &quot;Yes, I sent you full instructions two weeks ago.&quot; 
  &quot;MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby   forefinger. 
  &quot;You're mad&#8212;or trying to pull off a poor brand of joke!&quot; he   exclaimed. &quot;If you're dreaming, come out of it. Look here, Phil,&quot;  he  cried, a little heatedly, &quot;I've been having a hell of a time  since you  left the camp, and I want to talk seriously.&quot; 
  It was Philip who stared now. He fairly thrust himself upon the   engineer. 
  &quot;Do you mean to say you didn't get my letter telling you to put   the camps in fighting shape?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I didn't get it,&quot; said MacDougall. &quot;But I got the other.&quot; 
  &quot;There was no other!&quot; 
  MacDougall jumped to his feet, darted to his bunk, and came back a   moment later with a letter. He thrust it almost fiercely into   Philip's hands. A sweat broke out upon his face as he saw its  effect  upon his companion. Philip's face was deadly pale when he  looked up  from the letter. 
  &quot;My God! you haven't done this?&quot; he gasped. 
  &quot;What else could I do?&quot; demanded MacDougall. &quot;It's down there in   black and white, isn't it? It charges me to outfit six prospecting   parties of ten men each, arm every man with a rifle and revolver,   victual them for two months, and send them to the points named  there.  That letter came ten days ago, and the last party, under  Tom  Billinger, has been gone a week. You told me to send your very  best  men, and I have. It has fairly stripped the camp of the men  we  depended upon, and there are hardly enough guns left to kill  meat  with.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't write this letter,&quot; said Philip, looking hard at   MacDougall. &quot;The signature is a fraud. The letter which I sent to   you, revealing my discoveries at Churchill, has been intercepted  and  replaced by this. Do you know what it means?&quot; 
  MacDougall was speechless. His square jaw was set like an iron   clamp, his heavy hands doubled into knots on his knees. 
  &quot;It means&#8212;fight,&quot; continued Philip. &quot;To-night&#8212;to-morrow&#8212;at any   moment now. I can't guess why the blow hasn't fallen before this.&quot; 
  He quickly related to MacDougall the chief facts he had gathered   at Fort Churchill. When he had finished, the young Scotchman  reached  over to the table, seized his revolver, and held the butt  end of it  out to Philip. 
  &quot;Pump me full of lead&#8212;for God's sake, do, Phil,&quot; he pleaded. 
  Philip laughed, and gripped his hand. 
  &quot;Not while I need a few fighters like yourself, Sandy,&quot; he   objected. &quot;We're on to the game in time. By to-morrow morning  we'll  be prepared for the war. We haven't an hour&#8212;perhaps not a  minute&#8212;to  lose. How many men can you get hold of to-night whom we  can depend  upon to fight?&quot; 
  &quot;Ten or a dozen, no more. The road gang that we were expecting up   from the Grand Trunk Pacific came three days after you started for   Churchill&#8212;twenty-eight of 'em. They're a tough-looking outfit,  but  devilish good workers. I believe you could HIRE that gang to  do  anything. They won't take a word from me. It's all up to  Thorpe, the  foreman who brought 'em up, and they won't obey an  order unless it  comes through him. Thorpe could get them to fight,  but they haven't  anything to fight with, except a few knives. I've  got eight guns left,  and I can scrape up eight men who'll handle  them for the glory of it.  Thorpe's gang would be mighty handy in  close quarters, if it came to  that.&quot; 
  MacDougall moved restlessly, and ran a hand through his tawny   hair. 
  &quot;I almost wish we hadn't invited that bunch up here,&quot; he added.   &quot;They look to me like a lot of dollar thugs, but they work like   horses. Never saw such men with the shovel and pick. And fight?   They've cleaned up on a half of the men in camp. If we can get   Thorpe&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;We'll see him to-night,&quot; interrupted Philip. &quot;Or to be correct,   this morning. It's one o'clock. How long will it take to round up  our  best men?&quot; 
  &quot;Half an hour,&quot; said MacDougall, promptly, jumping to his feet.   &quot;There are Roberts, Henshaw, Tom Cassidy, Lecault, the Frenchman,  and  the two St. Pierre brothers. They're all crack gun-men. Give  'em each  an automatic and they're worth twenty ordinary men.&quot; 
  A few moments later MacDougall extinguished the light, and the two   men left the cabin. Philip drew his companion's attention to the   dimly lighted window of the cabin to which he had followed the   stranger a short time before, 
  &quot;That's Thorpe's,&quot; said the young engineer. &quot;I haven't seen him   since morning. Guess he must be up.&quot; 
  &quot;We'll sound him first,&quot; said Philip, starting off. 
  At MacDougall's knock there was a moment's silence inside, then   heavy footsteps, and the door was flung open. Sandy entered,  followed  by Philip. Thorpe stepped back. He was of medium height,  yet so  athletically built that he gave the impression of being two  inches  taller than he actually was. He was smooth-shaven, and his  hair and  eyes were black. His whole appearance was that of a  person infinitely  superior to what Philip had expected to find in  the gang-foreman. His  first words, and the manner in which they  were spoken, added to this  impression. 
  &quot;Good evening, gentlemen.&quot; 
  &quot;Good morning,&quot; replied MacDougall, nodding toward Philip. &quot;This   is Mr. Whittemore, Thorpe. We saw your light, and thought you   wouldn't mind a call.&quot; 
  Philip and Thorpe shook hands. 
  &quot;Just in time to have a cup of coffee,&quot; invited Thorpe,   pleasantly, motioning toward a steaming pot on the stove. &quot;I just  got  in from a long hike out over the new road-bed. Been looking  the ground  over along the north shore of the Gray Beaver, and was  so interested  that I didn't start for home until dark. Won't you  draw up, gentlemen?  There are mighty few who can beat me at making  coffee.&quot; 
  MacDougall had noted a sudden change in Philip's face, and as   Thorpe hastened to lift the over-boiling pot from the stove he saw   his chief make a quick movement toward a small table, and pick up  an  object which looked like a bit of cloth. In an instant Philip  had  hidden it in the palm of his hand. A flush leaped into his  cheeks. A  strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned. 
  &quot;I'm afraid we can't accept your hospitality,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm   tired, and want to get to bed. In passing, however, I couldn't   refrain from dropping in to compliment you on the remarkable work   your men are doing out on the plain. It's splendid.&quot; 
  &quot;They're good men,&quot; said Thorpe, quietly. &quot;Pretty wild, but good   workers.&quot; 
  He followed them to the door. Outside, Philip's voice trembled   when he spoke to MacDougall. 
  &quot;You go for the others, and bring them to the office, Sandy,&quot; he   said. &quot;I said nothing to Thorpe because I have no confidence in   liars, and Thorpe is a liar. He was not out to the Gray Beaver to-   day; for I saw him when he came in&#8212;from the opposite direction.  He  is a liar, and he will bear watching. Mind that, Sandy. Keep  your eyes  on this man Thorpe. And keep your eyes on his gang.  Hustle the others  over to the office as soon as you can.&quot; 
  They separated, and Philip returned to the cabin which they had   left a few minutes before. He relighted the lamp, and with a sharp   gasp in his breath held out before his eyes the object which he  had  taken from Thorpe's table. He knew now why Thorpe had come  from over  the mountains that night, why he was exhausted, and why  he had lied.  He clasped his head between his hands, scarcely  believing the evidence  of his eyes. A deeper breath, almost a  moan, fell from his twisted  lips. For he had discovered that  Thorpe, the gang-foreman, was  Jeanne's lover. In his hand he held  the dainty handkerchief,  embroidered in blue, which he had seen in  Jeanne's possession earlier  that evening&#8212;crumpled and discolored,  still damp with her tears!
