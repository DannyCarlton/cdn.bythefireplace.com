  After that one calling of her name Alan's voice was dead, and he  made no movement. He could not disbelieve. It was not a mental illusion  or a temporary upsetting of his sanity. It was truth. The shock of it  was rending every nerve in his body, even as he stood as if carved out  of wood. And then a strange relaxation swept over him. Some force  seemed to pass out of his flesh, and his arms hung limp. She was there,<I>  alive!</I> He could see the whiteness leave her face and a flush of  color come into it, and he heard a little cry as she jumped down from  the log and came toward him. It had all happened in a few seconds, but  it seemed a long time to Alan.
  He saw nothing about her or beyond her. It was as if she were  floating up to him out of the cold mists of the sea. And she stopped  only a step away from him, when she saw more clearly what was in his  face. It must have been something that startled her. Vaguely he  realized this and made an effort to recover himself.
  &#8220;You almost frightened me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have been expecting you  and watching for you, and I was out there a few minutes ago looking  back over the tundra. The sun was in my eyes, and I didn't see you.&#8221;
  It seemed incredible that he should be hearing her voice, the same  voice, unexcited, sweet, and thrilling, speaking as if she had seen him  yesterday and with a certain reserved gladness was welcoming him again  today. It was impossible for him to realize in these moments the  immeasurable distance that lay between their viewpoints. He was simply  Alan Holt&#8212;she was the dead risen to life. Many times in his grief he  had visualized what he would do if some miracle could bring her back to  him like this; he had thought of taking her in his arms and never  letting her go. But now that the miracle had come to pass, and she was  within his reach, he stood without moving, trying only to speak.
  &#8220;You&#8212;Mary Standish!&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I thought&#8212;&#8221;
  He did not finish. It was not himself speaking. It was another  individual within him, a detached individual trying to explain his lack  of physical expression. He wanted to cry out his gladness, to shout  with joy, yet the directing soul of action in him was stricken. She  touched his arm hesitatingly.
  &#8220;I didn't think you would care,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I thought you wouldn't  mind&#8212;if I came up here.&#8221;
  Care! The word was like an explosion setting things loose in his  brain, and the touch of her hand sent a sweep of fire through him. He  heard himself cry out, a strange, unhuman sort of cry, as he swept her  to his breast. He held her close, crushing kisses upon her mouth, his  fingers buried in her hair, her slender body almost broken in his arms.  She was alive&#8212;she had come back to him&#8212;and he forgot everything in  these blind moments but that great truth which was sweeping over him in  a glorious inundation. Then, suddenly, he found that she was fighting  him, struggling to free herself and putting her hands against his face  in her efforts. She was so close that he seemed to see nothing but her  eyes, and in them he did not see what he had dreamed of finding&#8212;but  horror. It was a stab that went into his heart, and his arms relaxed.  She staggered back, trembling and swaying a little as she got her  breath, her face very white.
  He had hurt her. The hurt was in her eyes, in the way she looked at  him, as if he had become a menace from which she would run if he had  not taken the strength from her. As she stood there, her parted lips  showing the red of his kisses, her shining hair almost undone, he held  out his hands mutely.
  &#8220;You think&#8212;I came here for<I> that?</I>&#8221; she panted.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Forgive me. I am sorry.&#8221;
  It was not anger that he saw in her face. It was, instead, a  mingling of shock and physical hurt; a measurement of him now, as she  looked at him, which recalled her to him as she had stood that night  with her back against his cabin door. Yet he was not trying to piece  things together. Even subconsciously that was impossible, for all life  in him was centered in the one stupendous thought that she was not  dead, but living, and he did not wonder why. There was no question in  his mind as to the manner in which she had been saved from the sea. He  felt a weakness in his limbs; he wanted to laugh, to cry out, to give  himself up to strange inclinations for a moment or two, like a woman.  Such was the shock of his happiness. It crept in a living fluid through  his flesh. She saw it in the swift change of the rock-like color in his  face, and his quicker breathing, and was a little amazed, but Alan was  too completely possessed by the one great thing to discover the  astonishment growing in her eyes.
  &#8220;You are alive,&#8221; he said, giving voice again to the one thought  pounding in his brain. &#8220;<I>Alive!</I>&#8220;
  It seemed to him that word wanted to utter itself an impossible  number of times. Then the truth that was partly dawning came entirely  to the girl.
  &#8220;Mr. Holt, you did not receive my letter at Nome?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;Your letter? At Nome?&#8221; He repeated the words, shaking his head.  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;And all this time&#8212;you have been thinking&#8212;I was dead?&#8221;
  He nodded, because the thickness in his throat made it the easier  form of speech.
  &#8220;I wrote you there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wrote the letter before I jumped  into the sea. It went to Nome with Captain Rifle's ship.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't get it.&#8221;
  &#8220;You didn't get it?&#8221; There was wonderment in her voice, and then, if  he had observed it, understanding.
  &#8220;Then you didn't mean that just now? You didn't intend to do it? It  was because you had blamed yourself for my death, and it was a great  relief to find me alive. That was it, wasn't it?&#8221;
  Stupidly he nodded again. &#8220;Yes, it was a great relief.&#8221;
  &#8220;You see, I had faith in you even when you wouldn't help me,&#8221; she  went on. &#8220;So much faith that I trusted you with my secret in the letter  I wrote. To all the world but you I am dead&#8212;to Rossland, Captain  Rifle, everyone. In my letter I told you I had arranged with the young  Thlinkit Indian. He smuggled the canoe over the side just before I  leaped in, and picked me up. I am a good swimmer. Then he paddled me  ashore while the boats were making their search.&#8221;
  In a moment she had placed a gulf between them again, on the other  side of which she stood unattainable. It was inconceivable that only a  few moments ago he had crushed her in his arms. The knowledge that he  had done this thing, and that she was looking at him now as if it had  never happened, filled him with a smothering sense of humiliation. She  made it impossible for him to speak about it, even to apologize more  fully.
  &#8220;Now I am here,&#8221; she was saying in a quiet, possessive sort of way.  &#8220;I didn't think of coming when I jumped into the sea. I made up my mind  afterward. I think it was because I met a little man with red whiskers  whom you once pointed out to me in the smoking salon on the<I> Nome</I>. And so&#8212;I am your guest, Mr. Holt.&#8221;
  There was not the slightest suspicion of apology in her voice as she  smoothed back her hair where he had crumpled it. It was as if she  belonged here, and had always belonged here, and was giving him  permission to enter her domain. Shock was beginning to pass away from  him, and he could feel his feet upon the earth once more. His  spirit-visions of her as she had walked hand in hand with him during  the past weeks, her soft eyes filled with love, faded away before the  reality of Mary Standish in flesh and blood, her quiet mastery of  things, her almost omniscient unapproachableness. He reached out his  hands, but there was a different light in his eyes, and she placed her  own in them confidently.
  &#8220;It was like a bolt of lightning,&#8221; he said, his voice free at last  and trembling. &#8220;Day and night I have been thinking of you, dreaming of  you, and cursing myself because I believed I had killed you. And now I  find you alive. And<I> here!</I>&#8220;
  She was so near that the hands he clasped lay against his breast.  But reason had returned to him, and he saw the folly of dreams.
  &#8220;It is difficult to believe. Out there I thought I was sick. Perhaps  I am. But if I am not sick, and you are really you, I am glad. If I  wake up and find I have imagined it all, as I imagined so many of the  other things&#8212;&#8221;
  He laughed, freeing her hands and looking into eyes shining half out  of tears at him. But he did not finish. She drew away from him, with a  lingering of her finger-tips on his arm, and the little heart-beat in  her throat revealed itself clearly again as on that night in his cabin.
  &#8220;I have been thinking of you back there, every hour, every step,&#8221; he  said, making a gesture toward the tundras over which he had come. &#8220;Then  I heard the firecrackers and saw the flag. It is almost as if I had  created you!&#8221;
  A quick answer was on her lips, but she stopped it.
  &#8220;And when I found you here, and you didn't fade away like a ghost, I  thought something was wrong with my head. Something must have been  wrong, I guess, or I wouldn't have done<I> that</I>. You see, it  puzzled me that a ghost should be setting off firecrackers&#8212;and I  suppose that was the first impulse I had of making sure you were real.&#8221;
  A voice came from the edge of the cottonwoods beyond them. It was a  clear, wild voice with a sweet trill in it. &#8220;<I>Maa-rie!</I>&#8221; it  called. &#8220;<I>Maa-rie!</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;Supper,&#8221; nodded the girl. &#8220;You are just in time. And then we are  going home in the twilight.&#8221;
  It made his heart thump, that casual way in which she spoke of his  place as home. She went ahead of him, with the sun glinting in the soft  coils of her hair, and he picked up his rifle and followed, eyes and  soul filled only with the beauty of her slim figure&#8212;a glory of life  where for a long time he had fashioned a spirit of the dead. They came  into an open, soft with grass and strewn with flowers, and in this open  a man was kneeling beside a fire no larger than his two hands, and at  his side, watching him, stood a girl with two braids of black hair  rippling down her back. It was Nawadlook who turned first and saw who  it was with Mary Standish, and from his right came an odd little  screech that only one person in the world could make, and that was  Keok. She dropped the armful of sticks she had gathered for the fire  and made straight for him, while Nawadlook, taller and less like a wild  creature in the manner of her coming, was only a moment behind. And  then he was shaking hands with Stampede, and Keok had slipped down  among the flowers and was crying. That was like Keok. She always cried  when he went away, and cried when he returned; and then, in another  moment, it was Keok who was laughing first, and Alan noticed she no  longer wore her hair in braids, as the quieter Nawadlook persisted in  doing, but had it coiled about her head just as Mary Standish wore her  own.
  These details pressed themselves upon him in a vague and unreal sort  of way. No one, not even Mary Standish, could understand how his mind  and nerves were fighting to recover themselves. His senses were  swimming back one by one to a vital point from which they had been  swept by an unexpected sea, gripping rather incoherently at unimportant  realities as they assembled themselves. In the edge of the tundra  beyond the cottonwoods he noticed three saddle-deer grazing at the ends  of ropes which were fastened to cotton-tufted nigger-heads. He drew off  his pack as Mary Standish went to help Keok pick up the fallen sticks.  Nawadlook was pulling a coffee-pot from the tiny fire. Stampede began  to fill a pipe. He realized that because they had expected him, if not  today then tomorrow or the next day or a day soon after that, no one  had experienced shock but himself, and with a mighty effort he reached  back and dragged the old Alan Holt into existence again. It was like  bringing an intelligence out of darkness into light.
  It was difficult for him&#8212;afterward&#8212;to remember just what happened  during the next half-hour. The amazing thing was that Mary Standish sat  opposite him, with the cloth on which Nawadlook had spread the supper  things between them, and that she was the same clear-eyed, beautiful  Mary Standish who had sat across the table from him in the dining-salon  of the<I> Nome</I>.
  Not until later, when he stood alone with Stampede Smith in the edge  of the cottonwoods, and the three girls were riding deer back over the  tundra in the direction of the Range, did the sea of questions which  had been gathering begin to sweep upon him. It had been Keok's  suggestion that she and Mary and Nawadlook ride on ahead, and he had  noticed how quickly Mary Standish had caught at the idea. She had  smiled at him as she left, and a little farther out had waved her hand  at him, as Keok and Nawadlook both had done, but not another word had  passed between them alone. And as they rode off in the warm glow of  sunset Alan stood watching them, and would have stared without speech  until they were out of sight, if Stampede's fingers had not gripped his  arm.
  &#8220;Now, go to it, Alan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'm ready. Give me hell!&#8221;
