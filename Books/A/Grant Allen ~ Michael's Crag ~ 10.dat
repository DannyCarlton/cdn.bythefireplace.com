During the next ten or eleven months poor Mrs. Trevennack had but one  abiding terror--that a sudden access of irrepressible insanity might  attack her husband before Cleer and Eustace could manage to get  married. Trevennack, however, with unvarying tenderness, did his best  in every way to calm her fears. Though no word on the subject passed  between them directly, he let her feel with singular tact that he  meant to keep himself under proper control. Whenever a dangerous topic  cropped up in conversation, he would look across at her  affectionately, with a reassuring smile. "For Cleer's sake," he  murmured often, if she was close by his side; "for Cleer's sake,  dearest!" and his wife, mutely grateful, knew at once what he meant,  and smiled approval sadly.    
Her heart was very full; her part was a hard one to play with fitting  cheerfulness; but in his very madness itself she couldn't help loving,  admiring, and respecting that strong, grave husband who fought so hard  against his own profound convictions.    
Ten months passed away, however, and Eustace Le Neve didn't seem to  get much nearer any permanent appointment than ever. He began to tire  at last of applying unsuccessfully for every passing vacancy. Now and  then he got odd jobs, to be sure; but odd jobs won't do for a man to  marry upon; and serious work seemed always to elude him. Walter Tyrrel  did his best, no doubt, to hunt up all the directors of all the  companies he knew; but no posts fell vacant on any line they were  connected with. It grieved Walter to the heart, for he had always had  the sincerest friendship for Eustace Le Neve; and now that Eustace was  going to marry Cleer Trevennack, Walter felt himself doubly bound in  honor to assist him. It was <i>he</i> who had ruined the Trevennacks' hopes  in life by his unintentional injury to their only son; the least he  could do in return, he thought, and felt, was to make things as easy  as possible for their daughter and her intended husband.    
By July, however, things were looking so black for the engineer's  prospects that Tyrrel made up his mind to run up to town and talk  things over seriously with Eustace Le Neve himself in person. He hated  going up there, for he hardly knew how he could see much of Eustace  without running some risk of knocking up accidentally against Michael  Trevennack; and there was nothing on earth that sensitive young squire  dreaded so much as an unexpected meeting with the man he had so  deeply, though no doubt so unintentionally and unwittingly, injured.  But he went, all the same. He felt it was his duty. And duty to Walter  Tyrrel spoke in an imperative mood which he dared not disobey, however  much he might be minded to turn a deaf ear to it.    
Le Neve had little to suggest of any practical value. It wasn't his  fault, Tyrrel knew; engineering was slack, and many good men were  looking out for appointments. In these crowded days, it's a foolish  mistake to suppose that energy, industry, ability, and integrity are  necessarily successful. To insure success you must have influence,  opportunity, and good luck as well, to back them. Without these, not  even the invaluable quality of unscrupulousness itself is secure from  failure.    
If only Walter Tyrrel could have got his friend to accept such terms,  indeed, he would gladly, for Cleer's sake, have asked Le Neve to marry  on an allowance of half the Penmorgan rent-roll. But in this  commercial age, such quixotic arrangements are simply impossible. So  Tyrrel set to work with fiery zeal to find out what openings were just  then to be had; and first of all for that purpose he went to call on a  parliamentary friend of his, Sir Edward Jones, the fat and good-  natured chairman of the Great North Midland Railway. Tyrrel was a  shareholder whose vote was worth considering, and he supported the  Board with unwavering loyalty.    
Sir Edward was therefore all attention, and listened with sympathy to  Tyrrel's glowing account of his friend's engineering energy and  talent. When he'd finished his eulogy, however, the practical railway  magnate crossed his fat hands and put in, with very common-sense  dryness, "If he's so clever as all that, why doesn't he have a shot at  this Wharfedale Viaduct?"    
Walter Tyrrel drew back a little surprised. The Wharfedale Viaduct was  a question just then in everybody's mouth. But what a question! Why,  it was one of the great engineering works of the age; and it was  informally understood that the company were prepared to receive plans  and designs from any competent person. There came the rub, though.  Would Eustace have a chance in such a competition as that? Much as he  believed in his old school-fellow, Tyrrel hesitated and reflected. "My  friend's young, of course," he said, after a pause. "He's had very  little experience--comparatively, I mean--to the greatness of the  undertaking."    
Sir Edward pursed his fat lips. It's a trick with your railway kings.  "Well, young men are often more inventive than old ones," he answered,  slowly. "Youth has ideas; middle age has experience. In a matter like  this, my own belief is, the ideas count for most. Yes, if I were you,  Tyrrel, I'd ask your friend to consider it."    
"You would?" Walter cried, brightening up.    
"Aye, that I would," the great railway-man answered, still more  confidently than before, rubbing his fat hands reflectively. "It's a  capital opening. Erasmus Walker'll be in for it, of course; and  Erasmus Walker'll get it. But don't you tell your fellow that. It'll  only discourage him. You just send him down to Yorkshire to  reconnoiter the ground; and if he's good for anything, when he's seen  the spot he'll make a plan of his own, a great deal better than  Walker's. Not that that'll matter, don't you know, as far as this  viaduct goes. The company'll take Walker's, no matter how good any  other fellow's may be, and how bad Walker's--because Walker has a  great name, and because they think they can't go far wrong if they  follow Walker. But still, if your friend's design is a good one, it'll  attract attention--which is always something; and after they've  accepted Walker's, and flaws begin to be found in it--as experts can  always find flaws in anything, no matter how well planned--your friend  can come forward and make a fuss in the papers (or what's better  still, <i>you</i> can come forward and make it for him) to say these flaws  were strikingly absent from <i>his</i> very superior and scientific  conception. There'll be flaws in your friend's as well, of course, but  they won't be the same ones, and nobody'll have the same interest in  finding them out and exposing them. And that'll get your man talked  about in the papers and the profession. It's better, anyhow, than  wasting his time doing nothing in London here."    
"He shall do it!" Walter cried, all on fire. "I'll take care he shall  do it. And Sir Edward, I tell you, I'd give five thousand pounds down  if only he could get the job away from Walker."    
"Got a grudge against Walker, then?" Sir Edward cried quickly,  puckering up his small eyes.    
"Oh, no," Tyrrel answered, smiling; that was not much in his line.  "But I've got strong reasons of my own, on the other hand, for wishing  to do a good turn to Le Neve in this business."    
And he went home, reflecting in his own soul on the way that many  thousands would be as dross in the pan to him if only he could make  Cleer Trevennack happy.    
But that very same evening Trevennack came home from the Admiralty in  a most excited condition.    
"Lucy!" he cried to his wife, as soon as he was alone in the room with  her, "who do you think I saw to-day--there, alive in the flesh,  standing smiling on the steps of Sir Edward Jones' house?--that brute  Walter Tyrrel, who killed our poor boy for us!" "Hush! hush, Michael!"  his wife cried in answer. "It's so long ago now, and he was such a boy  at the time; and he repents it bitterly--I'm sure he repents it. You  promised you'd try to forgive him. For Cleer's sake, dear heart, you  must keep your promise."    
Trevennack knit his brows. "What does he mean, then, by dogging my  steps?" he cried. "What does he mean by coming after me up to London  like this? What does he mean by tempting me? I can't stand the sight  of him. I won't be challenged, Lucy; I don't know whether it's the  devil or not, but when I saw the fellow to-day I had hard work to keep  my hands off him. I wanted to spring at his throat. I would have liked  to throttle him!"    
The silver-haired lady drew still closer to the excited creature, and  held his hands with a gentle pressure. "Michael," she said, earnestly,  "this <i>is</i> the devil. This is the greatest temptation of all. This is  what I dread most for you. Remember, it's Satan himself that suggests  such thoughts to you. Fight the devil <i>within</i>, dearest. Fight him  within, like a man. That's the surest place, after all, to conquer  him."    
Trevennack drew himself up proudly, and held his peace for a time.  Then he went on in another tone: "I shall get leave," said he quietly,  becoming pure human once more. "I shall get leave of absence. I can't  stop in town while this creature's about. I'd <i>have</i> to spring at him if  I saw him again. I can't keep my hands off him. I'll fly from  temptation. I must go down into the country."    
"Not to Cornwall!" Mrs. Trevennack cried, in deep distress; for she  dreaded the effect of those harrowing associations for him.    
Trevennack shook his head gravely. "No, not to Cornwall," he answered.  "I've another plan this time. I want to go to Dartmoor. It's lonely  enough there. Not a soul to distract me. You know, Lucy, when one  means to fight the devil, there's nothing for it like the wilderness;  and Dartmoor's wilderness enough for me. I shall go to Ivybridge, for  the tors and the beacons."    
Mrs. Trevennack assented gladly. If he wanted to fight the devil, it  was best at any rate he should be out of reach of Walter Tyrrel while  he did it. And it was a good thing to get him away, too, from St.  Michael's Mount, and St. Michael's Crag, and St. Michael's Chair, and  all the other reminders of his archangelic dignity in the Penzance  neighborhood. Why, she remembered with a wan smile--the dead ghost of  a smile rather--he couldn't even pass the Angel Inn at Helston without  explaining to his companions that the parish church was dedicated to  St. Michael, and that the swinging sign of the old coaching house once  bore a picture of the winged saint himself in mortal conflict with his  Satanic enemy. It was something, at any rate, to get Trevennack away  from a district so replete with memories of his past greatness, to say  nothing of the spot where their poor boy had died. But Mrs. Trevennack  didn't know that one thing which led her husband to select Dartmoor  this time for his summer holiday was the existence, on the wild hills  a little behind Ivybridge, of a clatter-crowned peak, known to all the  country-side as St. Michael's Tor, and crowned in earlier days by a  medieval chapel. It was on this sacred site of his antique cult that  Trevennack wished to fight the internal devil. And he would fight it  with a will, on that he was resolved; fight and, as became his angelic  reputation, conquer.
