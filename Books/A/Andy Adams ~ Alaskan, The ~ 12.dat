  This first night and dawn in the heard of his wilderness, with the  new import of life gleaming down at him from the mighty peaks of the  Chugach and Kenai ranges, marked the beginning of that uplift which  drew Alan out of the pit into which he had fallen. He understood, now,  how it was that through many long years his father had worshiped the  memory of a woman who had died, it seemed to him, an infinity ago.  Unnumbered times he had seen the miracle of her presence in his  father's eyes, and once, when they had stood overlooking a sun-filled  valley back in the mountains, the elder Holt had said:
  &#8220;Twenty-seven years ago the twelfth day of last month, mother went  with me through this valley, Alan. Do you see the little bend in the  creek, with the great rock in the sun? We rested there&#8212;before you were  born!&#8221;
  He had spoken of that day as if it had been but yesterday. And Alan  recalled the strange happiness in his father's face as he had looked  down upon something in the valley which no other but himself could see.
  And it was happiness, the same strange, soul-aching happiness, that  began to build itself a house close up against the grief in Alan's  heart. It would never be a house quite empty. Never again would he be  alone. He knew at last it was an undying part of him, as it had been a  part of his father, clinging to him in sweet pain, encouraging him,  pressing gently upon him the beginning of a great faith that somewhere  beyond was a place to meet again. In the many days that followed, it  grew in him, but in a way no man or woman could see. It was a secret  about which he built a wall, setting it apart from that stoical  placidity of his nature which some people called indifference. Olaf  could see farther than others, because he had known Alan's father as a  brother. It had always been that way with the elder Holt&#8212;straight,  clean, deep-breathing, and with a smile on his lips in times of hurt.  Olaf had seen him face death like that. He had seen him rise up with  awesome courage from the beautiful form that had turned to clay under  his eyes, and fight forth again into a world burned to ashes. Something  of that look which he had seen in the eyes of the father he saw in  Alan's, in these days when they nosed their way up the Alaskan coast  together. Only to himself did Alan speak the name of Mary Standish,  just as his father had kept Elizabeth Holt's name sacred in his own  heart. Olaf, with mildly casual eyes and strong in the possession of  memories, observed how much alike they were, but discretion held his  tongue, and he said nothing to Alan of many things that ran in his  mind.
  He talked of Siberia&#8212;always of Siberia, and did not hurry on the  way to Seward. Alan himself felt no great urge to make haste. The days  were soft with the premature breath of summer. The nights were cold,  and filled with stars. Day after day mountains hung about them like  mighty castles whose battlements reached up into the cloud-draperies of  the sky. They kept close to the mainland and among the islands, camping  early each evening. Birds were coming northward by the thousand, and  each night Olaf's camp-fire sent up the delicious aroma of flesh-pots  and roasts. When at last they reached Seward, and the time came for  Olaf to turn back, there was an odd blinking in the old Swede's eyes,  and as a final comfort Alan told him again that the day would probably  come when he would go to Siberia with him. After that, he watched the<I>  Norden</I> until the little boat was lost in the distance of the sea.
  Alone, Alan felt once more a greater desire to reach his own  country. And he was fortunate. Two days after his arrival at Seward the  steamer which carried mail and the necessities of life to the string of  settlements reaching a thousand miles out into the Pacific left  Resurrection Bay, and he was given passage. Thereafter the countless  islands of the North Pacific drifted behind, while always northward  were the gray cliffs of the Alaskan Peninsula, with the ramparted  ranges beyond, glistening with glaciers, smoking with occasional  volcanoes, and at times so high their snowy peaks were lost in the  clouds. First touching the hatchery at Karluk and then the canneries at  Uyak and Chignik, the mail boat visited the settlements on the Island  of Unga, and thence covered swiftly the three hundred miles to Dutch  Harbor and Unalaska. Again he was fortunate. Within a week he was  berthed on a freighter, and on the twelfth day of June set foot in  Nome.
  His home-coming was unheralded, but the little, gray town, with its  peculiar, black shadowings, its sea of stove-pipes, and its two  solitary brick chimneys, brought a lump of joy into his throat as he  watched its growing outlines from the small boat that brought him  ashore. He could see one of the only two brick chimneys in northern  Alaska gleaming in the sun; beyond it, fifty miles away, were the  ragged peaks of the Saw-Tooth Range, looking as if one might walk to  them in half an hour, and over all the world between seemed to hover a  misty gloom. But it was where he had lived, where happiness and tragedy  and unforgetable memories had come to him, and the welcoming of its  frame buildings, its crooked streets, and what to others might have  been ugliness, was a warm and thrilling thing. For here were his<I>  people</I>. Here were the men and women who were guarding the northern  door of the world, an epic place, filled with strong hearts, courage,  and a love of country as inextinguishable as one's love of life. From  this drab little place, shut out from all the world for half the year,  young men and women went down to southern universities, to big cities,  to the glamor and lure of &#8220;outside.&#8221; But they always came back. Nome  called them. Its loneliness in winter. Its gray gloom in springtime.  Its glory in summer and autumn. It was the breeding-place of a new race  of men, and they loved it as Alan loved it. To him the black wireless  tower meant more than the Statue of Liberty, the three weather-beaten  church spires more than the architectural colossi of New York and  Washington. Beside one of the churches he had played as a boy. He had  seen the steeples painted. He had helped make the crooked streets. And  his mother had laughed and lived and died here, and his father's  footprints had been in the white sands of the beach when tents dotted  the shore like gulls.
  When he stepped ashore, people stared at him and then greeted him.  He was unexpected. And the surprise of his arrival added strength to  the grip which men's hands gave him. He had not heard voices like  theirs down in the States, with a gladness in them that was almost  excitement. Small boys ran up to his side, and with white men came the  Eskimo, grinning and shaking his hands. Word traveled swiftly that Alan  Holt had come back from the States. Before the day was over, it was on  its way to Shelton and Candle and Keewalik and Kotzebue Sound. Such was  the beginning of his home-coming. But ahead of the news of his arrival  Alan walked up Front Street, stopped at Bahlke's restaurant for a cup  of coffee, and then dropped casually into Lomen's offices in the Tin  Bank Building.
  For a week Alan remained in Nome. Carl Lomen had arrived a few days  before, and his brothers were &#8220;in&#8221; from the big ranges over on the  Choris Peninsula. It had been a good winter and promised to be a  tremendously successful summer. The Lomen herds would exceed forty  thousand head, when the final figures were in. A hundred other herds  were prospering, and the Eskimo and Lapps were full-cheeked and plump  with good feeding and prosperity. A third of a million reindeer were on  the hoof in Alaska, and the breeders were exultant. Pretty good, when  compared with the fact that in 1902 there were less than five thousand!  In another twenty years there would be ten million.
  But with this prosperity of the present and still greater promise  for the future Alan sensed the undercurrent of unrest and suspicion in  Nome. After waiting and hoping through another long winter, with their  best men fighting for Alaska's salvation at Washington, word was  traveling from mouth to mouth, from settlement to settlement, and from  range to range, that the Bureaucracy which misgoverned them from  thousands of miles away was not lifting a hand to relieve them. Federal  office-holders refused to surrender their deadly power, and their  strangling methods were to continue. Coal, which should cost ten  dollars a ton if dug from Alaskan mines, would continue to cost forty  dollars; cold storage from Nome would continue to be fifty-two dollars  a ton, when it should be twenty. Commercial brigandage was still given  letters of marque. Bureaus were fighting among themselves for greater  power, and in the turmoil Alaska was still chained like a starving man  just outside the reach of all the milk and honey in a wonderful land.  Pauperizing, degrading, actually killing, the political misrule that  had already driven 25 per cent of Alaska's population from their homes  was to continue indefinitely. A President of the United States had  promised to visit the mighty land of the north and see with his own  eyes. But would he come? There had been other promises, many of them,  and promises had always been futile. But it was a hope that crept  through Alaska, and upon this hope men whose courage never died began  to build. Freedom was on its way, even if slowly. Justice must triumph  ultimately, as it always triumphed. Rusty keys would at last be turned  in the locks which had kept from Alaskans all the riches and resources  of their country, and these men were determined to go on building  against odds that they might be better prepared for that freedom of  human endeavor when it came.
  In these days, when the fires of achievement needed to be  encouraged, and not smothered, neither Alan nor Carl Lomen emphasized  the menace of gigantic financial interests like that controlled by John  Graham&#8212;interests fighting to do away with the best friend Alaska ever  had, the Biological Survey, and backing with all their power the  ruinous legislation to put Alaska in the control of a group of five men  that an aggrandizement even more deadly than a suffocating policy of  conservation might be more easily accomplished. Instead, they spread  the optimism of men possessed of inextinguishable faith. The blackest  days were gone. Rifts were breaking in the clouds. Intelligence was  creeping through, like rays of sunshine. The end of Alaska's serfdom  was near at hand. So they preached, and knew they were preaching truth,  for what remained of Alaska's men after years of hopelessness and  distress were fighting men. And the women who had remained with them  were the mothers and wives of a new nation in the making.
  These mothers and wives Alan met during his week in Nome. He would  have given his life if a few million people in the States could have  known these women. Something would have happened then, and the  sisterhood of half a continent&#8212;possessing the power of the  ballot&#8212;would have opened their arms to them. Men like John Graham  would have gone out of existence; Alaska would have received her  birthright. For these women were of the kind who greeted the sun each  day, and the gloom of winter, with something greater than hope in their  hearts. They, too, were builders. Fear of God and love of land lay deep  in their souls, and side by side with their men-folk they went on in  this epic struggle for the building of a nation at the top of the  world.
  Many times during this week Alan felt it in his heart to speak of  Mary Standish. But in the end, not even to Carl Lomen did word of her  escape his lips. The passing of each day had made her more intimately a  part of him, and a secret part. He could not tell people about her. He  even made evasions when questioned about his business and experiences  at Cordova and up the coast. Curiously, she seemed nearer to him when  he was away from other men and women. He remembered it had been that  way with his father, who was always happiest when in the deep mountains  or the unending tundras. And so Alan thrilled with an inner gladness  when his business was finished and the day came for him to leave Nome.
  Carl Lomen went with him as far as the big herd on Choris Peninsula.  For one hundred miles, up to Shelton, they rode over a narrow-gauge,  four-foot railway on a hand-car drawn by dogs. And it seemed to Alan,  at times, as though Mary Standish were with him, riding in this strange  way through a great wilderness. He could<I> see</I> her. That was the  strange thing which began to possess him. There were moments when her  eyes were shining softly upon him, her lips smiling, her presence so  real he might have spoken to her if Lomen had not been at his side. He  did not fight against these visionings. It pleased him to think of her  going with him into the heart of Alaska, riding the picturesque  &#8220;pup-mobile,&#8221; losing herself in the mountains and in his tundras, with  all the wonder and glory of a new world breaking upon her a little at a  time, like the unfolding of a great mystery. For there was both wonder  and glory in these countless miles running ahead and drifting behind,  and the miracle of northward-sweeping life. The days were long. Night,  as Mary Standish had always known night, was gone. On the twentieth of  June there were twenty hours of day, with a dim and beautiful twilight  between the hours of eleven and one. Sleep was no longer a matter of  the rising and setting of the sun, but was regulated by the hands of  the watch. A world frozen to the core for seven months was bursting  open like a great flower.
  From Shelton, Alan and his companion visited the eighty or ninety  people at Candle, and thence continued down the Keewalik River to  Keewalik, on Kotzebue Sound. A Lomen power-boat, run by Lapps, carried  them to Choris Peninsula, where for a week Alan remained with Lomen and  his huge herd of fifteen thousand reindeer. He was eager to go on, but  tried to hide his impatience. Something was urging him, whipping him on  to greater haste. For the first time in months he heard the crackling  thunder of reindeer hoofs, and the music of it was like a wild call  from his own herds hurrying him home. He was glad when the week-end  came and his business was done. The power-boat took him to Kotzebue. It  was night, as his watch went, when Paul Davidovich started up the delta  of the Kobuk River with him in a lighterage company's boat. But there  was no darkness. In the afternoon of the fourth day they came to the  Redstone, two hundred miles above the mouth of the Kobuk as the river  winds. They had supper together on the shore. After that Paul  Davidovich turned back with the slow sweep of the current, waving his  hand until he was out of sight.
  Not until the sound of the Russian's motor-boat was lost in distance  did Alan sense fully the immensity of the freedom that swept upon him.  At last, after months that had seemed like so many years, he was<I>  alone</I>. North and eastward stretched the unmarked trail which he  knew so well, a hundred and fifty miles straight as a bird might fly,  almost unmapped, unpeopled, right up to the doors of his range in the  slopes of the Endicott Mountains. A little cry from his own lips gave  him a start. It was as if he had called out aloud to Tautuk and Amuk  Toolik, and to Keok and Nawadlook, telling them he was on his way home  and would soon be there. Never had this hidden land which he had found  for himself seemed so desirable as it did in this hour. There was  something about it that was all-mothering, all-good,  all-sweetly-comforting to that other thing which had become a part of  him now. It was holding out its arms to him, understanding, welcoming,  inspiring him to travel strongly and swiftly the space between. And he  was ready to answer its call.
  He looked at his watch. It was five o'clock in the afternoon. He had  spent a long day with the Russian, but he felt no desire for rest or  sleep. The musk-tang of the tundras, coming to him through the thin  timber of the river-courses, worked like an intoxicant in his blood. It  was the tundra he wanted, before he lay down upon his back with his  face to the stars. He was eager to get away from timber and to feel the  immeasurable space of the big country, the open country, about him.  What fool had given to it the name of<I> Barren Lands</I>? What idiots  people were to lie about it in that way on the maps! He strapped his  pack over his shoulders and seized his rifle. Barren Lands!
  He set out, walking like a man in a race. And long before the  twilight hours of sleep they were sweeping out ahead of him in all  their glory&#8212;the Barren Lands of the map-makers,<I> his</I> paradise.  On a knoll he stood in the golden sun and looked about him. He set his  pack down and stood with bared head, a whispering of cool wind in his  hair. If Mary Standish could have lived to see<I> this</I>! He  stretched out his arms, as if pointing for her eyes to follow, and her  name was in his heart and whispering on his silent lips. Immeasurable  the tundras reached ahead of him&#8212;rolling, sweeping, treeless, green  and golden and a glory of flowers, athrill with a life no forest land  had ever known. Under his feet was a crush of forget-me-nots and of  white and purple violets, their sweet perfume filling his lungs as he  breathed. Ahead of him lay a white sea of yellow-eyed daisies, with  purple iris high as his knees in between, and as far as he could see,  waving softly in the breeze, was the cotton-tufted sedge he loved. The  pods were green. In a few days they would be opening, and the tundras  would be white carpets.
  He listened to the call of life. It was about him everywhere, a  melody of bird-life subdued and sleepy even though the sun was still  warmly aglow in the sky. A hundred times he had watched this miracle of  bird instinct, the going-to-bed of feathered creatures in the weeks and  months when there was no real night. He picked up his pack and went on.  From a pool hidden in the lush grasses of a distant hollow came to him  the twilight honking of nesting geese and the quacking content of wild  ducks. He heard the reed-like, musical notes of a lone &#8220;organ-duck&#8221; and  the plaintive cries of plover, and farther out, where the shadows  seemed deepening against the rim of the horizon, rose the harsh,  rolling notes of cranes and the raucous cries of the loons. And then,  from a clump of willows near him, came the chirping twitter of a thrush  whose throat was tired for the day, and the sweet, sleepy evening song  of a robin.<I> Night!</I> Alan laughed softly, the pale flush of the  sun in his face.<I> Bedtime!</I> He looked at his watch.
  It was nine o'clock. Nine o'clock, and the flowers still answering  to the glow of the sun! And the people down there&#8212;in the  States&#8212;called it a frozen land, a hell of ice and snow at the end of  the earth, a place of the survival of the fittest! Well, to just such  extremes had stupidity and ignorance gone through all the years of  history, even though men called themselves super-creatures of  intelligence and knowledge. It was humorous. And it was tragic.
  At last he came to a shining pool between two tufted ridges, and in  this velvety hollow the twilight was gathering like a shadow in a cup.  A little creek ran out of the pool, and here Alan gathered soft grass  and spread out his blankets. A great stillness drew in about him,  broken only by the old squaws and the loons. At eleven o'clock he could  still see clearly the sleeping water-fowl on the surface of the pool.  But the stars were appearing. It grew duskier, and the rose-tint of the  sun faded into purple gloom as pale night drew near&#8212;four hours of rest  that was neither darkness nor day. With a pillow of sedge and grass  under his head he slept.
  The song and cry of bird-life wakened him, and at dawn he bathed in  the pool, with dozens of fluffy, new-born ducks dodging away from him  among the grasses and reeds. That day, and the next, and the day after  that he traveled steadily into the heart of the tundra country, swiftly  and almost without rest. It seemed to him, at last, that he must be in  that country where all the bird-life of the world was born, for  wherever there was water, in the pools and little streams and the  hollows between the ridges, the voice of it in the morning was a babel  of sound. Out of the sweet breast of the earth he could feel the  irresistible pulse of motherhood filling him with its strength and its  courage, and whispering to him its everlasting message that because of  the glory and need and faith of life had God created this land of  twenty-hour day and four-hour twilight. In it, in these days of summer,  was no abiding place for gloom; yet in his own heart, as he drew nearer  to his home, was a place of darkness which its light could not quite  enter.
  The tundras had made Mary Standish more real to him. In the treeless  spaces, in the vast reaches with only the sky shutting out his vision,  she seemed to be walking nearer to him, almost with her hand in his. At  times it was like a torture inflicted upon him for his folly, and when  he visioned what might have been, and recalled too vividly that it was  he who had stilled with death that living glory which dwelt with him in  spirit now, a crying sob of which he was not ashamed came from his  lips. For when he thought too deeply, he knew that Mary Standish would  have lived if he had said other things to her that night aboard the  ship. She had died, not for him, but<I> because</I> of him&#8212;because, in  his failure to live up to what she believed she had found in him, he  had broken down what must have been her last hope and her final faith.  If he had been less blind, and God had given him the inspiration of a  greater wisdom, she would have been walking with him now, laughing in  the rose-tinted dawn, growing tired amid the flowers, sleeping under  the clear stars&#8212;happy and unafraid, and looking to him for all things.  At least so he dreamed, in his immeasurable loneliness.
  He did not tolerate the thought that other forces might have called  her even had she lived, and that she might not have been his to hold  and to fight for. He did not question the possibility of shackles and  chains that might have bound her, or other inclinations that might have  led her. He claimed her, now that she was dead, and knew that living he  would have possessed her. Nothing could have kept him from that. But  she was gone. And for that he was accountable, and the fifth night he  lay sleepless under the stars, and like a boy he cried for her with his  face upon his arm, and when morning came, and he went on, never had the  world seemed so vast and empty.
  His face was gray and haggard, a face grown suddenly old, and he  traveled slowly, for the desire to reach his people was dying within  him. He could not laugh with Keok and Nawadlook, or give the old tundra  call to Amuk Toolik and his people, who would be riotous in their  happiness at his return. They loved him. He knew that. Their love had  been a part of his life, and the knowledge that his response to this  love would be at best a poor and broken thing filled him with dread. A  strange sickness crept through his blood; it grew in his head, so that  when noon came, he did not trouble himself to eat.
  It was late in the afternoon when he saw far ahead of him the clump  of cottonwoods near the warm springs, very near his home. Often he had  come to these old cottonwoods, an oasis of timber lost in the great  tundras, and he had built himself a little camp among them. He loved  the place. It had seemed to him that now and then he must visit the  forlorn trees to give them cheer and comradeship. His father's name was  carved in the bole of the greatest of them all, and under it the date  and day when the elder Holt had discovered them in a land where no man  had gone before. And under his father's name was his mother's, and  under that, his own. He had made of the place a sort of shrine, a green  and sweet-flowered tabernacle of memories, and its bird-song and peace  in summer and the weird aloneness of it in winter had played their  parts in the making of his soul. Through many months he had anticipated  this hour of his home-coming, when in the distance he would see the  beckoning welcome of the old cottonwoods, with the rolling foothills  and frosted peaks of the Endicott Mountains beyond. And now he was  looking at the trees and the mountains, and something was lacking in  the thrill of them. He came up from the west, between two willow ridges  through which ran the little creek from the warm springs, and he was  within a quarter of a mile of them when something stopped him in his  tracks.
  At first he thought the sound was the popping of guns, but in a  moment he knew it could not be so, and the truth flashed suddenly upon  him. This day was the Fourth of July, and someone in the cottonwoods  was shooting firecrackers!
  A smile softened his lips. He recalled Keok's mischievous habit of  lighting a whole bunch at one time, for which apparent wastefulness  Nawadlook never failed to scold her. They had prepared for his  home-coming with a celebration, and Tautuk and Amuk Toolik had probably  imported a supply of &#8220;bing-bangs&#8221; from Allakakat or Tanana. The  oppressive weight inside him lifted, and the smile remained on his  lips. And then as if commanded by a voice, his eyes turned to the dead  cottonwood stub which had sentineled the little oasis of trees for many  years. At the very crest of it, floating bravely in the breeze that  came with the evening sun, was an American flag!
  He laughed softly. These were the people who loved him, who thought  of him, who wanted him back. His heart beat faster, stirred by the old  happiness, and he drew himself quickly into a strip of willows that  grew almost up to the cottonwoods. He would surprise them! He would  walk suddenly in among them, unseen and unheard. That was the sort of  thing that would amaze and delight them.
  He came to the first of the trees and concealed himself carefully.  He heard the popping of individual firecrackers and the louder bang of  one of the &#8220;giants&#8221; that always made Nawadlook put her fingers in her  pretty ears. He crept stealthily over a knoll, down through a hollow,  and then up again to the opposite crest. It was as he had thought. He  could see Keok a hundred yards away, standing on the trunk of a fallen  tree, and as he looked, she tossed another bunch of sputtering crackers  away from her. The others were probably circled about her, out of his  sight, watching her performance. He continued cautiously, making his  way so that he could come up behind a thick growth of bush unseen,  within a dozen paces of them. At last he was as near as that to her,  and Keok was still standing on the log with her back toward him.
  It puzzled him that he could not see or hear the others. And  something about Keok puzzled him, too. And then his heart gave a sudden  throb and seemed to stop its beating. It was not Keok on the log. And  it was not Nawadlook! He stood up and stepped out from his  hiding-place. The slender figure of the girl on the log turned a  little, and he saw the glint of golden sunshine in her hair. He called  out.
  &#8220;Keok!&#8221;
  Was he mad? Had the sickness in his head turned his brain?
  And then:
  &#8220;Mary!&#8221; he called. &#8220;<I>Mary Standish</I>!&#8221;
  She turned. And in that moment Alan Holt's face was the color of  gray rock. It was the dead he had been thinking of, and it was the dead  that had risen before him now. For it was Mary Standish who stood there  on the old cottonwood log, shooting firecrackers in this evening of his  home-coming.
