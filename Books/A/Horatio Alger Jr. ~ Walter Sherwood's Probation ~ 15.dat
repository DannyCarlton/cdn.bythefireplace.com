  Walter was fortunate enough not to lose his head under any   circumstances. He noticed that his opponent held him by his right   hand, and it was his right arm which had been lamed. Naturally,   therefore, it had lost some of its strength. This was his opportunity.   With a sudden twist he wriggled out of the giant's grasp, and,   understanding that it was dangerous to be at too close quarters, he   threw open the outer door and dashed into the yard. 
  Whether this would, on the whole, have helped him, was uncertain,  as  the tramp could probably outrun him, but just in the nick of time a   team appeared, driven by a young man, perhaps twenty-five, of   remarkable size. Hiram Nutt was six feet six inches in height, the   tallest man in the county, and he was as athletic as he was tall. He   tipped the scales at two hundred and ten pounds, and was famous for   his feats of strength. He was a farmer's son and lived at Elm Bank. 
  When he saw Walter dash out of the house, pursued by an ill-looking   tramp, he thought it high time to interfere. 
  &quot;What's up?&quot; he demanded, still retaining his seat in the wagon. 
  &quot;None of your business!&quot; retorted the tramp, too angry to be  prudent,  &quot;The kid's been impudent, and I'm going to pound him to a  jelly.&quot; 
  Meanwhile, Walter was leading the tramp a chase round the wagon,   narrowly escaping seizure. 
  &quot;Help me!&quot; exclaimed Walter, panting. 
  &quot;If you do, I'll lay you out!&quot; exclaimed the pursuer, who had been  too  much occupied to notice the formidable size of the young man in  the  wagon. 
  Hiram Nutt smiled&#8212;a smile of conscious strength. 
  &quot;Jump in the wagon, boy!&quot; he said. &quot;I'll take care of you.&quot; 
  Walter obeyed directions, and the tramp tried to follow him. 
  But in an instant Hiram had risen to his full height and, leaping  to  the ground, hurried to the rear of the vehicle and caught hold of  the  tramp. The latter tried to resist, but he was like a child in the   grasp of a man. He looked up in amazement, for he was proud of his   strength. 
  &quot;What museum did you escape from, you&#8212;monster?&quot; he panted. 
  Hiram laughed. 
  &quot;Never mind,&quot; he said. &quot;It's well I'm here. Now, boy, who is this   man?&quot; 
  &quot;I found him in that house, ready to strike down the lady who lives   there because she would not give him what money she had.&quot; 
  Hiram Nutt's brows contracted. 
  &quot;Why, you thieving scoundrel!&quot; he cried, vigorously shaking his   captive, &quot;you dared to threaten Mrs. Gregory? Did he hurt the lady?&quot;   he added anxiously. 
  &quot;No; I heard her cry for help and rushed in. Then he turned upon  me.&quot; 
  &quot;He might have killed you!&quot; 
  &quot;I wish I had!&quot; ejaculated the tramp, with a scowl. 
  &quot;Where is Mrs. Gregory now?&quot; 
  &quot;I told her to go upstairs.&quot; 
  Just then the lady, who from an upper window had observed the   discomfiture and capture of her enemy, came out. 
  &quot;Oh, Mr. Nutt,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;I am so glad you came along! I was   afraid this brave boy would get hurt.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't he that will get hurt now,&quot; said Nutt, significantly.  &quot;How  came this fellow in your house?&quot; 
  &quot;He came in half an hour ago and asked for food.&quot; 
  &quot;And you gave it to him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I got ready a lunch for him and made him some tea, though he   wanted liquor.&quot; 
  &quot;And this was the way of repaying the favor?&quot; 
  &quot;He had heard in some way that my husband brought home some money  last  evening and he demanded it. I wish, Mr. Nutt, you would take  charge of  it till my husband comes home. I don't dare to have it in  the house.&quot; 
  &quot;It won't be necessary, for there comes your husband.&quot; 
  It was true. Ephraim Gregory turned the corner of the street, and   paused in surprise at the spectacle before him. 
  &quot;What's the matter, Lucy?&quot; he asked. 
  She briefly explained. 
  &quot;I am so glad you are at home,&quot; she sighed. &quot;But how do you happen  to  come so early?&quot; 
  &quot;I think it was a presentiment of evil. I thought of the money I  had  left with you, and it occurred to me that it might expose you to   danger. So I got leave of absence and took an early train for Elm   Bank.&quot; &quot;What shall I do with this fellow, Mr. Gregory?&quot; asked Hiram. 
  &quot;I'll go into the house and get a rope to tie him. Then we'll take  him  to the lock-up.&quot; 
  &quot;Let me go!&quot; said the tramp, uneasily. &quot;I was only joking.&quot; 
  &quot;You carried the joke too far, my friend,&quot; said Hiram,  significantly.  &quot;I'll take you round to the lock-up&#8212;by way of  joke&#8212;and Judge Jones  will sentence you to the penitentiary&#8212;just to  help the joke along.&quot; 
  &quot;Let me go!&quot; whined the tramp, now thoroughly subdued. &quot;I am a poor   man, and that's what led me to do wrong.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose you never indulged in such a little joke before?&quot; 
  &quot;No; this is the first time.&quot; 
  &quot;Probably you are a church member when you are at home,&quot; said  Hiram,  in a tone of sarcasm. &quot;You're a good man gone wrong, ain't  you?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the tramp. 
  &quot;You look like it. Such good men as you are better off in jail.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll leave town and never come back&#8212;I will, on my honor!&quot; pleaded   the tramp, earnestly. 
  &quot;I don't put any confidence in what you say. Ah, here's the rope.  Now,  hold still, if you know what's best for yourself.&quot; 
  The tramp attempted resistance, but a little vigorous shaking up by   his captor soon brought him to terms. In five minutes, with his hands   and feet firmly tied, he was on his way to the lock-up. Mr. Gregory   and Walter accompanied him in the wagon. 
  &quot;Now, Mr. Sherwood,&quot; said Gregory, when their errand was completed,  &quot;I  want to thank you for your brave defense of my wife.&quot; 
  &quot;I only did what any one would do under the same circumstances,&quot;  said  Walter, modestly. 
  &quot;Any one of the requisite courage. You put yourself in danger.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't think of that, Mr. Gregory.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I suppose not, but it is proper that I should think of it. You   have placed me under an obligation that I shall not soon forget. You   must do me the favor to come home to supper with me and pass the   night. Will it interfere seriously with your business?&quot; 
  &quot;I am a life-insurance agent,&quot; said Walter, &quot;or, at least, I am  trying  to be, but have not yet succeeded in writing a policy.&quot; 
  &quot;I have been thinking of insuring my life for a small sum. If you  come  home with me you may talk me into doing it.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I will certainly accept your invitation,&quot; said Walter,  smiling. 
  &quot;My wife made me promise to keep you. She wants to show her  gratitude.  Besides, you may be wanted to appear against the prisoner  to-morrow  morning.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be glad to help him to his deserts,&quot; said Walter. &quot;The  sooner  he is locked up the better it will be for the community.&quot; 
  Walter had no reason to regret his acceptance of the invitation.  Mrs.  Gregory exerted herself to the utmost in providing an appetizing   supper, far in advance of anything he would have had set before him at   his boarding-house, Mrs. Canfield being an indifferent cook. Generally   her butter was strong and her tea weak, while the contrary should have   been the case, and her biscuit heavy with saleratus. Walter thoroughly   enjoyed his supper, and was almost ashamed of his appetite. But it   gave his hostess great pleasure to see his appreciation of the meal,   and she took it as a compliment to herself as a cook. 
  After supper Walter and Mr. Gregory sat down to business. He  explained  the methods of the insurance company for which he was acting  as agent,  and found Mr. Gregory an interested and intelligent  listener. 
  &quot;You may write me a policy for a thousand dollars,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;You will need to pass a medical examination,&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;Certainly; will our village physician do?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then take your hat and walk over with me. It is only half-a-mile   distant.&quot; 
  The whole matter was adjusted that evening, and Walter was pleased  to  feel that he had made a successful start in his new business. 
  The next morning the tramp was brought before Justice Jones, who   arranged to hold court early to oblige Walter and Mr. Gregory, and the   prisoner received a sentence of a year's confinement. He gave the name   of Barney Fogg, and under that name received his sentence. He scowled   fiercely while Walter was giving his evidence, and as he was taken   from the court-room handcuffed, he turned toward our hero and said:   &quot;It's your turn now, young bantam, but I'll be even with you yet.&quot; 
  &quot;What a terrible man!&quot; said Mr. Gregory, shuddering. &quot;I hope I  shall  never see him again.&quot;
