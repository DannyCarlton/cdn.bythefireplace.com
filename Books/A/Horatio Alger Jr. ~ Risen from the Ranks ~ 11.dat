  Those of my readers who live in large cities are probably not  familiar with the travelling tin-pedler, who makes his appearance at  frequent intervals in the country towns and villages of New England.  His stock of tinware embraces a large variety of articles for culinary  purposes, ranging from milk-pans to nutmeg-graters. These are contained  in a wagon of large capacity, in shape like a box, on which he sits  enthroned a merchant prince. Unlike most traders, he receives little  money, most of his transactions being in the form of a barter, whereby  be exchanges his merchandise for rags, white and colored, which have  accumulated in the household, and are gladly traded off for bright  tinware. Behind the cart usually depend two immense bags, one for  white, the other for colored rags, which, in time, are sold to paper  manufacturers. It may be that the very paper on which this description  is printed, was manufactured from rags so collected.
  Abner Bickford was the proprietor of such an establishment as I have  described. No one, at first sight, would have hesitated to class him as  a Yankee. He was long in the limbs, and long in the face, with a shrewd  twinkle in the eye, a long nose, and the expression of a man who  respected himself and feared nobody. He was unpolished, in his manners,  and knew little of books, but he belonged to the same resolute and  hardy type of men who in years past sprang to arms, and fought bravely  for an idea. He was strong in his manhood, and would have stood  unabashed before a king. Such was the man who was to mortify the pride  of Fitzgerald Fletcher.
  Tom Carver watched for his arrival in Centreville, and walking up to  his cart, accosted him.
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Bickford.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good-mornin', young man. You've got the advantage of me. I never  saw you before as I know of.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am Tom Carver, at your service.&#8221;
  &#8220;Glad to know you. Where do you live? Maybe your wife would like  some tinware this mornin'?&#8221; said Abner, relaxing his gaunt features  into a smile.
  &#8220;She didn't say anything about it when I came out,&#8221; said Tom,  entering into the joke.
  &#8220;Maybe you'd like a tin-dipper for your youngest boy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe I would, if you've got any to give away.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see you've cut your eye-teeth. Is there anything else I can do  for you? I'm in for a trade.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know, unless I sell myself for rags.&#8221;
  &#8220;Anything for a trade. I'll give you two cents a pound.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's too cheap. I came to ask your help in a trick we boys want  to play on one of our number.&#8221;
  &#8220;Sho! you don't say so. That aint exactly in my line.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell you all about it. There's a chap at our school&#8212;the  Academy, you know&#8212;who's awfully stuck up. He's all the time bragging  about belonging to a first family in Boston, and turning up his nose at  poorer boys. We want to mortify him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so!&#8221; said Abner, nodding. &#8220;Drive ahead!&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, we thought if you'd call at the school and ask after him, and  pretend he was a cousin of yours, and all that, it would make him mad.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Abner, nodding, &#8220;he wouldn't like to own a  tin-pedler for his cousin.&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom; &#8220;he wants us to think all his relations are rich. I  wouldn't mind at all myself,&#8221; he added, it suddenly occurring to him  that Abner's feelings might be hurt.
  &#8220;Good!&#8221; said Abner, &#8220;I see you aint one of the stuck-up kind. I've  got some relations in Boston myself, that are rich and stuck up. I  never go near 'em. What's the name of this chap you're talkin' about?&#8221;
  &#8220;Fletcher&#8212;Fitzgerald Fletcher.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fletcher!&#8221; repeated Abner. &#8220;Whew! well, that's a joke!&#8221;
  &#8220;What's a joke?&#8221; asked Tom, rather surprised.
  &#8220;Why, he<I> is</I> my relation&#8212;a sort of second cousin. Why, my  mother and his father are own cousins. So, don't you see we're second  cousins?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's splendid!&#8221; exclaimed Tom. &#8220;I can hardly believe it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's so. My mother's name was Fletcher&#8212;Roxanna Fletcher&#8212;afore she  married. Jim Fletcher&#8212;this boy's father&#8212;used to work in my  grandfather's store, up to Hampton, but he got kinder discontented, and  went off to Boston, where he's been lucky, and they do say he's mighty  rich now. I never go nigh him, 'cause I know he looks down on his  country cousins, and I don't believe in pokin' my nose in where I aint  wanted.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you are really and truly Fitz's cousin?&#8221;
  &#8220;If that's the boy's name. Seems to me it's a kinder queer one. I  s'pose it's a fust-claas name. Sounds rather stuck up.&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't the boys roar when they hear about it! Are you willing to  enter into our plan?&#8221;
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Abner, &#8220;I'll do it. I can't abide folks that's stuck  up. I'd rather own a cousin like you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Bickford.&#8221;
  &#8220;When do you want me to come round?&#8221;
  &#8220;How long do you stay in town?&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, I expect to stop overnight at the tavern; I can't get through  in one day.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then come round to the Academy to-morrow morning, about half-past  eight. School don't begin till nine, but the boys will be playing ball  alongside. Then we'll give you an introduction to your cousin.&#8221;
  &#8220;That'll suit me well enough. I'll come.&#8221;
  Tom Carver returned in triumph, and communicated to the other boys  the arrangement be had made with Mr. Bickford, and his unexpected  discovery of the genuine relationship that existed between Fitz and the  tin-pedler. His communication was listened to with great delight, and  no little hilarity, and the boys discussed the probable effect of the  projected meeting.
  &#8220;Fitz will be perfectly raving,&#8221; said Henry Fairbanks. &#8220;There's  nothing that will take down his pride so much.&#8221;
  &#8220;He'll deny the relationship, probably,&#8221; said Oscar.
  &#8220;How can he?&#8221;
  &#8220;He'll do it. See if he don't. It would be death to all his  aristocratic claims to admit it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose it were yourself, Oscar?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd say, 'How are you, cousin? How's the the business?'&#8220; answered  Oscar, promptly.
  &#8220;I believe you would, Oscar. There's nothing of the snob about you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yet your family stands as high as Fletcher's.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a point I leave to others to discuss,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;My  father is universally respected, I am sure, but he rose from the ranks.  He was once a printer's devil, like my friend Harry Walton. Wouldn't it  be ridiculous in me to turn up my nose at Walton, just because be  stands now where my father did thirty years ago? It would be the same  thing as sneering at father.&#8221;
  &#8220;Give us your hand, Oscar,&#8221; said Henry Fairbanks. &#8220;You've got no  nonsense about you&#8212;I like you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not sure whether your compliment is deserved, Henry,&#8221; said  Oscar, &#8220;but if I have any nonsense it isn't of that kind.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you believe Fitz has any suspicion that he has a cousin in the  tin business?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I don't believe he has. He must know he has poor relations,  living in the country, but he probably thinks as little as possible  about them. As long as they don't intrude themselves upon his  greatness, I suppose he is satisfied.&#8221;
  &#8220;And as long as no one suspects that he has any connection with such  plebeians.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course.&#8221;
  &#8220;What sort of a man is this tin-pedler, Tom?&#8221; asked Oscar.
  &#8220;He's a pretty sharp fellow&#8212;not educated, or polished, you know,  but he seems to have some sensible ideas. He said he had never seen the  Fletchers; because he didn't want to poke his nose in where he wasn't  wanted. He showed his good sense also by saying that he had rather have  me for a cousin than Fitz.&#8221;
  &#8220;That isn't a very high compliment&#8212;I'd say the same myself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar. Your compliment exalts me. You won't mind my  strutting a little.&#8221;
  And Tom humorously threw back his head, and strutted about with mock  pride.
  &#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;you don't belong to one of the first  families of Boston, like our friend, Fitz.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I belong to one of the second families. You can't blame me, for  I can't help it.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I won't blame you, but of course I consider you low.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid, Tom, I haven't got any cousins in the tin trade, like  Fitz.&#8221;
  &#8220;Poor Fitz! he little dreams of his impending trial. If he did, I am  afraid he wouldn't sleep a wink to-night.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I thought as much of myself as Fitz does,&#8221; said Henry  Fairbanks. &#8220;You can see by his dignified pace, and the way he tosses  his head, how well satisfied he is with being Fitzgerald Fletcher,  Esq.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll bet five cents he won't strut round so much to-morrow  afternoon,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;after his interview with his new cousin. But  hush, boys! Not a word more of this. There's Fitz coming up the hill. I  wouldn't have him suspect what's going on, or he might defeat our plans  by staying away.&#8221;
