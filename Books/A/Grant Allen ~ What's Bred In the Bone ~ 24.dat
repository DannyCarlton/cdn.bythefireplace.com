On the very same day that Guy Waring visited Mambury, where his  mother was married, Montague Nevitt had hunted up the entry of  Colonel Kelmscott's wedding in the church register.    
Nevitt's behaviour, to say the truth, wasn't quite so black as Guy  Waring painted it. He had gone off with the extra three thousand  in his pocket, to be sure; but he didn't intend to appropriate it  outright to his own uses. He merely meant to give Guy a thoroughly  good fright, as it wasn't really necessary the call should be met  for another fortnight; and then, as soon as he'd found out the truth  about Colonel Kelmscott and his unacknowledged sons, he proposed  to use his knowledge of the forgery as a lever with Guy, so as to  force him to come to advantageous terms with his supposed father.  Nevitt's idea was that Guy and Cyril should drive a hard bargain  on their own account with the Colonel, and that he himself should  then receive a handsome commission on the transaction from both  the brothers, under penalty of disclosing the true facts about the  cheque by whose aid Guy had met their joint liability to the Rio  Negro Diamond Mines.    
It was with no small joy, therefore, that Nevitt saw at last  in the parish register of St. Mary's at Mambury, the interesting  announcement, "June 27th, Henry Lucius Kelmscott, of the parish  of Plymouth, bachelor, private in the Regiment of Scots Greys, to  Lucy Waring, spinster, of this parish."    
He saw at a glance, of course, why Kelmscott of Tilgate had chosen  to describe himself in this case as a private soldier. But he  also saw that the entry was an official document, and that here he  had one firm hold the more on Colonel Kelmscott, who must falsely  have sworn to that incorrect description. The great point of all,  however, was the signature to the book; and though nearly thirty  years had elapsed since those words were written, it was clear to  Nevitt, when he compared the autograph in the register with one of  Colonel Kelmscott's recent business letters, brought with him for  the purpose, that both had been penned by one and the same person.    
He chuckled to himself with delight to think how great a benefactor  he had proved himself unawares to Guy and Cyril. At that very  moment, no doubt, his misguided young friend whom he had compelled  to assist him with the sinews of war for this important campaign  was reviling and objurating him in revengeful terms as the blackest  and most infamous of double-dyed traitors. Ah, well! ah, well!  the good are inured to gross ingratitude. Guy little knew, as he,  Montague Nevitt, stood there triumphant in the vestry, blandly  rewarding the expectant clerk for his pains with a whole Bank of  England five-pound note--the largest sum that functionary had ever  in his life received all at once in a single payment--Guy little  knew that Nevitt was really the chief friend and founder of the  family fortunes, and was prepared to compel the "unknown benefactor"  (for a moderate commission) to recognise his unacknowledged firstborn  sons before all the world as the heirs to Tilgate. But yesterday,  they were nameless waifs and strays, of uncertain origin, ashamed of  their birth, and ignorant even whether they had been duly begotten  in lawful wedlock; to-day, they were the legal inheritors of an  honoured name and a great estate, the first and foremost among the  landed gentry of a wealthy and beautiful English county.    
He smiled to think what a good turn he had done unawares to those  ungrateful youths--and how little credit, as yet, they were prepared  to give him for it. In such a mood he returned to the inn to lunch.  His spirits were high. This was a good day's work, and he could  afford, indeed, to make merry with his host over it. He ordered  in a bottle of wine--such wine as the little country cellar could  produce, and invited that honest man, the landlord, to step in and  share it with him. He had tasted worse sherry on London dinner-tables,  and he told his host so. An affable man with inferiors, Mr. Montague  Nevitt! Then he strolled out by himself down the path by the brook.  It was a pleasant walk, with the water making music in little  trickles by its side, and Montague Nevitt, as a man of taste,  found it suited exactly with his temper for the moment. He noted  an undercurrent of rejoicing and triumphant cheeriness in the tone  of the stream as it plashed among the pebbles on its precipitous  bed that suggested to his mind some bars of a symphony which he  determined to compose as soon as he got home again to his beloved  fiddle.    
So he walked along by himself, elate, and with a springy step, on  thoughts of ambition intent, till he came at last to a cool and  shadowy place, where as yet the ferns were <i>not</i> broken down and  trampled underfoot, though Guy Waring found them so some twenty  minutes later.    
At that spot he looked up, and saw advancing along the path in the  opposite direction the burly figure of a man, in a light tourist  suit, whom he hadn't yet observed since he came to Mambury. The  very first point he noticed about the man, long before he recognised  him, was a pair of overgrown, obtrusive hands held somewhat awkwardly  in front of him--just like Gilbert Gildersleeve's. The likeness,  indeed, was so ridiculously close that Montague Nevitt smiled quietly  to himself to observe it. If he'd been in the Tilgate district now,  he'd have declared, without the slightest hesitation, that the man  on the path <i>was</i> Gilbert Gildersleeve.    
One second later, he pulled himself up with a jerk in alarmed  surprise. "Great heavens" he cried to himself, a weird sense of  awe creeping over him piece-meal, "either this is a dream or else  it <i>is</i>, it must be Gilbert Gildersleeve."    
And so, indeed, it was. Gilbert Gildersleeve himself, in his proper  person. But the eminent Q.C., better versed in the wiles of time  and place than Guy Waring in his innocence, had not come obtrusively  to Mambury village or asked point-blank at the Talbot Arms by his  own right name for the man he was in search of. Such simplicity of  procedure would never even have occurred to that practised hand at  the Old Bailey. Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve appeared on that woodland  path in the general guise of the common pedestrian tourist with  his head-quarters at Ivybridge, walking about on the congenial  outskirts of the Moor in search of the picturesque, and coming and  going by mere accident through Mambury. He had hovered around the  neighbourhood for two days, off and on, in search of his man; and  now, by careful watching, like an amateur detective, he had run  his prey to earth by a dexterous flank-movement and secured an  interview with him where he couldn't shirk or avoid it.    
To Montague Nevitt, however, the meeting seemed at first sight but  the purest accident. He had no reason to suppose, indeed, that  Gilbert Gildersleeve had any special interest in his visit to  Mambury, further than might be implied in its possible connection  with Granville Kelmscott's affairs; and he didn't believe Gwendoline,  in her fear of her father, that blustering man, would ever have  communicated to him the personal facts of their interview at Tilgate.  So he advanced to meet his old acquaintance, the barrister, with  frankly outstretched hand.    
"Mr. Gildersleeve!" he exclaimed in some surprise. "No, it can't  be you. Well, this <i>is</i> indeed an unexpected pleasure."    
Gilbert Gildersleeve gazed down upon him from the towering elevation  of his six feet four. Montague Nevitt was tall enough, as men  go in England, but with his slim, tailor-made form, and his waxed  moustaches, he looked by the side of that big-built giant, like  a: Bond Street exquisite before some prize-fighting Goliath. The  barrister didn't hold out his huge hand in return. On the contrary,  he concealed it, as far as was possible, behind his burly back,  and, looking down from the full height of his contempt upon the  sinister smirking creature who advanced to greet him with that  false smile on his face, he asked severely,    
"What are <i>you</i> doing here? That's what <i>I</i> have to ask. What foxy  ferreting have you come down to Mambury for?"    
"Foxy ferreting," Montague Nevitt repeated, drawing back as if  stung, and profoundly astonished. "Why, what do you mean by that,  Mr. Gildersleeve? I don't understand you." The home-thrust was too  true--after the great cross-examiner's well-known bullying manner  --not to pierce him to the quick. "Who dares to say I go anywhere  ferreting?"    
"<i>I</i> do," Gilbert Gildersleeve answered, with assured confidence.  "I say it, and I know it. You pitiful sneak, don't deny it to <i>me</i>.  You were in the vestry this morning looking up the registers. Even  <i>you</i>, with your false eyes, sir, daren't look me in the face and  tell me you weren't. I saw you there myself. And I know you found  in the books what you wanted; for you paid the clerk an extravagant  fee. ... What's that? you rat, don't try to interrupt me. Don't  try to bully me. It never succeeds. Montague Nevitt, I tell you,  I <i>won't</i> be bullied." And the great Q.C. put his foot down on the  path with an elephantine solidity that made the prospect of bullying  him seem tolerably unlikely. "I know the facts, and I'll stand no  prevarication. Now, tell me, what vile use did you mean to make of  your discovery this morning?"    
Montague Nevitt drew back, fairly nonplussed for the moment by such  a vigorous and unexpected attack on his flank. Resourceful as he  was, even his cunning mind came wholly unprepared to this sudden  cross-questioning. He felt his own physical inferiority to the big  Q.C. more keenly just then than he could ever have conceived it  possible for a man of his type to feel it. After all, mind doesn't  always triumph over matter. Montague Nevitt was aware that that  mountain of a man, with his six feet four of muscular humanity,  fairly cowed and overawed him at such very close quarters.    
"I don't see what business it is of yours, Mr. Gildersleeve," he  murmured, in a somewhat apologetic voice. "I may surely be allowed  to hunt up questions of pedigree, of service in the end to myself  and my friends, without <i>your</i> interference."    
Gilbert Gildersleeve glared at him, and flared up all at once with  righteous indignation.    
"Of service in the end to yourself and your friends!" he cried, with  unfeigned scorn, putting his own interpretation, as was natural,  on the words. "Why, you cur! you reptile! you unblushing sneak! Do  you mean to say openly you avow your intention of threatening and  blackmailing me? here--alone--to my face! You extortionate wretch!  I wouldn't have believed even <i>you</i> in your heart would descend to  such meanness."    
Montague Nevitt, flurried and taken aback as he was, yet reflected  vaguely with some wonder, as he listened and looked, what this  sudden passion of disinterested zeal could betoken. Why such  burning solicitude for Colonel Kelmscott's estate on the part of  a man who was his avowed enemy? Even if Gwendoline meant to marry  the young fellow Granville, with her father's consent, how could  Nevitt himself levy blackmail upon Gilbert Gildersleeve by his  knowledge of the two Warings' claim to the property? A complication  surely. Was there not some unexpected intricacy here which the  cunning schemer himself didn't yet understand, but which might  redound, if unravelled, to his greater advantage?    
"Blackmail <i>you</i>, Mr. Gildersleeve," he cried, with a righteously  indignant air. "That's an ugly word. I blackmail nobody; and least  of all the father of a lady whom I still regard, in spite of all she  can say or do to make my life a blank, with affection and respect  as profound as ever. How can my inquiries into the two Warings'  affairs--"    
Gilbert Gildersleeve crushed him with a sudden outburst of indignant  wrath.    
"You cad!" he cried, growing red in the face with horror and disgust.  "You dare to speak so to me, and to urge such motives! But you've  mistaken your man. I won't be bullied. If what you want is to use  this vile knowledge you've so vilely ferreted out, as a lever to  compel me to marry my daughter to you against her will--I can only  tell you, you sneak, you're on the wrong tack. I will never consent  to it. You may do your worst, but you will never bend me. I'm not  a man to be bent or bullied--I won't be put down. I'll withstand  you and defy you. You may ruin me, if you like, but you'll never  break me. I stand here firm. Expose me, and I'll fight you to the  bitter end: I'll fight you, and I'll conquer you."    
He spoke with a fiery earnestness that Nevitt was only just beginning to  understand. There was something in this. Here was a clue indeed to  follow up and investigate. Surely, a menace to Granville Kelmscott's  prospects could never have moved that heavy, phlegmatic, pachydermatous  man to such an outburst of anger and suppressed fear.    
"Expose <i>you</i>?" Nevitt repeated, in a dazed and startled voice. "Expose  <i>you</i>, my dear sir! I assure you, in truth, I don't understand you."    
The barrister gazed down upon him with immeasurable scorn. "You  liar!" he broke forth, almost choking at the words. "How dare you  so pretend and prevaricate to my face? I <i>know</i> it's not true. My own  daughter told me. She told me what you said to her--every word of  your vile threats. You had the incredible meanness to terrify a poor  helpless and innocent girl by threatening to expose her mother's  disgrace publicly. Only <i>you</i> could have done it; but you did it,  you abject thing, you did it. She told me with her own lips you  threatened to come down to Mambury, to hunt up the records. And  she told me the truth; for I've seen you doing it."    
A light broke slowly upon Montague Nevitt's mind. He drew a deep  breath. This was good luck incredible. What Gilbert Gildersleeve  meant he hadn't as yet, to be sure, the faintest conception. But  it was clear they two were at cross-questions with one another.  The secret Gilbert Gildersleeve thought he had come down to Mambury  to discover was not the secret he had actually found out in the  register that morning. It was nothing about the Kelmscotts or Guy  and Cyril Waring; it was something about the great Q..C. and his  wife themselves--presumably some unknown and disgraceful fact in  Mrs. Gilbert Gildersleeve's early history.    
And here was the cleverest lawyer at the English criminal bar just  giving himself away--giving himself away unawares and telling him  the secret, bit by bit, unconsciously.    
This chance was too valuable for Mr. Montague Nevitt to lose. At  all risks he must worm it out. He paused and temporized. His cue  was now not to let Gilbert Gildersleeve see he didn't know his  secret. He must draw on the Q.C. by obscure half hints till he was  inextricably entangled in a complete confession.    
"I had no intention of terrifying Miss Gildersleeve, I'm sure,"  he said, in his blandest voice, with his best company smile, now  recovering his equanimity exactly in proportion as the barrister  grew angrier. "I merely desired to satisfy myself as to the salient  facts, and to learn their true bearing upon the family history.  If I spoke to her at all as to any knowledge I might possess with  regard to any other lady's early antecedents--"    
Gilbert Gildersleeve's brow was black as night. His great hands  trembled and twitched convulsively. Was ever blackguard so cynically  candid in his avowal of the basest crimes as this fine-spoken  specimen of the culture of Pall Mall in his open confession of that  disgusting insult to a young girl's innocence? Gilbert Gildersleeve,  who was at heart an honest man, loathed and despised and scorned  and detested him.    
"Do you dare to hint to me, then," he cried, every muscle of his  body quivering with just horror, "that you told my own daughter you  thought you had reason to suspect her own mother's early antecedents?"    
Montague Nevitt looked up at him with a quietly sarcastic smile.  "All's fair in love and war, you know," he said, not caring to  commit himself.    
That smile sealed his fate. With an irrepressible impulse, Gilbert  Gildersleeve sprang upon him. He didn't mean to hurt the man: he  sprang upon him merely as the sole outlet for his own incensed and  outraged feelings. Those great hands seized him for a second by the  dainty white throat, and flung him back in anger. Montague Nevitt  fell heavily on a thick mass of bracken. There was a gurgle, a  gasp; then his head lolled senseless. He was very much hurt. That  at least was certain. The barrister stood over him for a minute,  still purple in the face. Montague Nevitt was white--very white and  death-like. All at once it occurred to the big strong man that  his hands--those great hands--were very fierce and powerful. He  had clutched Nevitt by the throat, half unconsciously, with all  his might, just to give him a purchase as he flung the man from  him. He looked at him again. Great heavens--what was this? It burst  over him at once. He awoke to it with a wild start. The fellow was  dead! And this was clearly manslaughter!    
Justifiable homicide, if the jury knew all. But no jury now could  ever know all. And he had killed him unawares! A great horror  came over him. The man was dead--the man was dead; and he, Gilbert  Gildersleeve, had unconsciously choked him.    
He had no time to think. He had no time to calculate. His wrath was  still hot, though rapidly cooling down before this awful discovery.  Hide it! Hide it! Hide it! That was all he could think. He lifted  the body in his arms, as easily as most men would lift a baby.  Then he laid it down among the brambles close beside the stream.  Something heavy fell out of the pocket as he carried it. The  barrister took no heed. Little matter for that. He laid it down  in fear and trembling. As soon as it was hidden, he fled for his  life. By trackless ways, he walked over the Moor, and returned to  Ivybridge unseen very late in the evening. Ten minutes after he  left the spot, Guy Waring passed by and picked up the pocket-book.
