Meanwhile, Dolores was growing up to woman's estate. And she was  growing into a tall, a graceful, an exquisitely beautiful woman.    
Yet in some ways Herminia had reason to be dissatisfied with her  daughter's development. Day by day she watched for signs of the  expected apostolate. Was Dolores pressing forward to the mark for  the prize of her high calling? Her mother half doubted it. Slowly  and regretfully, as the growing girl approached the years when she  might be expected to think for herself, Herminia began to perceive  that the child of so many hopes, of so many aspirations, the child  pre-destined to regenerate humanity, was thinking for herself--in a  retrograde direction. Incredible as it seemed to Herminia, in the  daughter of such a father and such a mother, Dolores' ideas--nay,  worse her ideals--were essentially commonplace. Not that she had  much opportunity of imbibing commonplace opinions from any outside  source; she redeveloped them from within by a pure effort of  atavism. She had reverted to lower types. She had thrown back to  the Philistine.    
Heredity of mental and moral qualities is a precarious matter.  These things lie, as it were, on the topmost plane of character;  they smack of the individual, and are therefore far less likely to  persist in offspring than the deeper-seated and better-established  peculiarities of the family, the clan, the race, or the species.  They are idiosyncratic. Indeed, when we remember how greatly the  mental and moral faculties differ from brother to brother, the  product of the same two parental factors, can we wonder that they  differ much more from father to son, the product of one like factor  alone, diluted by the addition of a relatively unknown quality, the  maternal influence? However this may be, at any rate, Dolores  early began to strike out for herself all the most ordinary and  stereotyped opinions of British respectability. It seemed as if  they sprang up in her by unmitigated reversion. She had never  heard in the society of her mother's lodgings any but the freest  and most rational ideas; yet she herself seemed to hark back, of  internal congruity, to the lower and vulgarer moral plane of her  remoter ancestry. She showed her individuality only by evolving  for herself all the threadbare platitudes of ordinary convention.    
Moreover, it is not parents who have most to do with moulding the  sentiments and opinions of their children. From the beginning,  Dolly thought better of the landlady's views and ideas than of her  mother's. When she went to school, she considered the moral  standpoint of the other girls a great deal more sensible than the  moral standpoint of Herminia's attic. She accepted the beliefs and  opinions of her schoolfellows because they were natural and  congenial to her character. In short, she had what the world calls  common-sense: she revolted from the unpractical Utopianism of her  mother.    
From a very early age, indeed, this false note in Dolly had begun  to make itself heard. While she was yet quite a child, Herminia  noticed with a certain tender but shrinking regret that Dolly  seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and  equipages of life,--to rank, wealth, title, servants, carriages,  jewelry. At first, to be sure, Herminia hoped this might prove but  the passing foolishness of childhood: as Dolly grew up, however, it  became clearer each day that the defect was in the grain--that  Dolly's whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or  snobbish. She had that mean admiration for birth, position,  adventitious advantages, which is the mark of the beast in the  essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature. She admired people  because they were rich, because they were high-placed, because they  were courted, because they were respected; not because they were  good, because they were wise, because they were noble-natured,  because they were respect-worthy.    
But even that was not all. In time, Herminia began to perceive  with still profounder sorrow that Dolly had no spontaneous care or  regard for righteousness. Right and wrong meant to her only what  was usual and the opposite. She seemed incapable of considering  the intrinsic nature of any act in itself apart from the praise or  blame meted out to it by society. In short, she was sunk in the  same ineffable slough of moral darkness as the ordinary inhabitant  of the morass of London.    
To Herminia this slow discovery, as it dawned bit by bit upon her,  put the final thorn in her crown of martyrdom. The child on whose  education she had spent so much pains, the child whose success in  the deep things of life was to atone for her own failure, the child  who was born to be the apostle of freedom to her sisters in  darkness, had turned out in the most earnest essentials of  character a complete disappointment, and had ruined the last hope  that bound her to existence.    
Bitterer trials remained. Herminia had acted through life to a  great extent with the idea ever consciously present to her mind  that she must answer to Dolly for every act and every feeling. She  had done all she did with a deep sense of responsibility. Now it  loomed by degrees upon her aching heart that Dolly's verdict would  in almost every case be a hostile one. The daughter was growing  old enough to question and criticise her mother's proceedings; she  was beginning to understand that some mysterious difference marked  off her own uncertain position in life from the solid position of  the children who surrounded her--the children born under those  special circumstances which alone the man-made law chooses to stamp  with the seal of its recognition. Dolly's curiosity was shyly  aroused as to her dead father's family. Herminia had done her best  to prepare betimes for this inevitable result by setting before her  child, as soon as she could understand it, the true moral doctrine  as to the duties of parenthood. But Dolly's own development  rendered all such steps futile. There is no more silly and  persistent error than the belief of parents that they can influence  to any appreciable extent the moral ideas and impulses of their  children. These things have their springs in the bases of  character: they are the flower of individuality; and they cannot be  altered or affected after birth by the foolishness of preaching.  Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, you  will find soon enough he will choose his own course for himself and  depart from it.    
Already when Dolly was a toddling little mite and met her mother's  father in the church in Marylebone, it had struck her as odd that  while they themselves were so poor and ill-clad, her grandpapa  should be such a grand old gentleman of such a dignified aspect.  As she grew older and older, and began to understand a little more  the world she lived in, she wondered yet more profoundly how it  could happen, if her grandpapa was indeed the Very Reverend, the  Dean of Dunwich, that her mamma should be an outcast from her  father's church, and scarcely well seen in the best carriage  company. She had learnt that deans are rather grand people--almost  as much so as admirals; that they wear shovel-hats to distinguish  them from the common ruck of rectors; that they lived in fine  houses in a cathedral close; and that they drive in a victoria with  a coachman in livery. So much essential knowledge of the church of  Christ she had gained for herself by personal observation; for  facts like these were what interested Dolly. She couldn't  understand, then, why she and her mother should live precariously  in a very small attic; should never be visited by her mother's  brothers, one of whom she knew to be a Prebendary of Old Sarum,  while the other she saw gazetted as a Colonel of Artillery; and  should be totally ignored by her mother's sister, Ermyntrude, who  lolled in a landau down the sunny side of Bond Street.    
At first, indeed, it only occurred to Dolly that her mother's  extreme and advanced opinions had induced a social breach between  herself and the orthodox members of her family. Even that Dolly  resented; why should mamma hold ideas of her own which shut her  daughter out from the worldly advantages enjoyed to the full by the  rest of her kindred? Dolly had no particular religious ideas; the  subject didn't interest her; and besides, she thought the New  Testament talked about rich and poor in much the same unpractical  nebulous way that mamma herself did--in fact, she regarded it with  some veiled contempt as a rather sentimental radical publication.  But, she considered, for all that, that it was probably true enough  as far as the facts and the theology went; and she couldn't  understand why a person like mamma should cut herself off  contumaciously from the rest of the world by presuming to  disbelieve a body of doctrine which so many rich and well-gaitered  bishops held worthy of credence. All stylish society accepted the  tenets of the Church of England. But in time it began to occur to  her that there might be some deeper and, as she herself would have  said, more disgraceful reason for her mother's alienation from so  respectable a family. For to Dolly, that was disgraceful which the  world held to be so. Things in themselves, apart from the world's  word, had for her no existence. Step by step, as she grew up to  blushing womanhood, it began to strike her with surprise that her  grandfather's name had been, like her own, Barton. "Did you marry  your cousin, mamma?" she asked Herminia one day quite suddenly.    
And Herminia, flushing scarlet at the unexpected question, the  first with which Dolly had yet ventured to approach that dangerous  quicksand, replied with a deadly thrill, "No, my darling. Why do  you ask me?"    
"Because," Dolly answered abashed, "I just wanted to know why your  name should be Barton, the same as poor grandpapa's."    
Herminia didn't dare to say too much just then. "Your dear  father," she answered low, "was not related to me in any way."    
Dolly accepted the tone as closing the discussion for the present;  but the episode only strengthened her underlying sense of a mystery  somewhere in the matter to unravel.    
In time, Herminia sent her child to a day-school. Though she had  always taught Dolly herself as well as she was able, she felt it a  matter of duty, as her daughter grew up, to give her something more  than the stray ends of time in a busy journalist's moments of  leisure. At the school, where Dolly was received without question,  on Miss Smith-Water's recommendation, she found herself thrown much  into the society of other girls, drawn for the most part from the  narrowly Mammon-worshipping ranks of London professional society.  Here, her native tendencies towards the real religion of England,  the united worship of Success and Respectability, were encouraged  to the utmost. But she noticed at times with a shy shrinking that  some few of the girls had heard vague rumors about her mother as a  most equivocal person, who didn't accept all the current  superstitions, and were curious to ask her questions as to her  family and antecedents. Crimson with shame, Dolly parried such  enquiries as best she could; but she longed all the more herself to  pierce this dim mystery. Was it a runaway match?--with the groom,  perhaps, or the footman? Only the natural shamefacedness of a  budding girl in prying into her mother's most domestic secrets  prevented Dolores from asking Herminia some day point-blank all  about it.    
But she was gradually becoming aware that some strange atmosphere  of doubt surrounded her birth and her mother's history. It filled  her with sensitive fears and self-conscious hesitations.    
And if the truth must be told, Dolly never really returned her  mother's profound affection. It is often so. The love which  parents lavish upon their children, the children repay, not to  parents themselves, but to the next generation. Only when we  become fathers or mothers in our turn do we learn what our fathers  and mothers have done for us. Thus it was with Dolly. When once  the first period of childish dependence was over, she regarded  Herminia with a smouldering distrust and a secret dislike that  concealed itself beneath a mask of unfelt caresses. In her heart  of hearts, she owed her mother a grudge for not having put her in a  position in life where she could drive in a carriage with a  snarling pug and a clipped French poodle, like Aunt Ermyntrude's  children. She grew up, smarting under a sullen sense of injustice,  all the deeper because she was compelled to stifle it in the  profoundest recesses of her own heart.
