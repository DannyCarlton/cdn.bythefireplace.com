"You needn't expect any trouble from the authorities," said de  Galisonniere, when they sat once more in the great room at the inn.  "Dueling is of course frowned upon theoretically, but it's a common  practice, and since no life has been lost, not even any wound inflicted,  you'll hear nothing of it from the government. And de Mezy, I imagine,  will say as little about it as possible. He rather fancies himself as a  swordsman, and he will not want everybody in Quebec to know that he was  defeated and disarmed by a boy. Still, it will spread."    
He and Glandelet took a courteous leave, and Robert thanked them for  their services. He liked them both, especially de Galisonniere, and he  was sorry that fate should put them on opposing sides in the war that  all of them felt was surely coming.    
"The French count gave you the hand of friendship, but not the spirit of  it," said Tayoga, who had not spoken at all while they were at the  dueling ground. "He was grateful to you for sparing his life, but his  gratitude will go like the wind, and then he will hate you. And he will  have the powerful friends, of whom the captain spoke, to plot against  you and us."    
"That's so, Tayoga," said the hunter, gravely, "I'm sorry the Governor  General wasn't here when we arrived. It was an unlucky chance, because  it would have been better for us to have given him our letters and have  departed at once."    
Robert, in his heart, knew that it was true, and that dangers would soon  cluster about them, but he was willing to linger. The spell of Quebec  had grown stronger, and he had made an entrance into its world in most  gallant fashion, sword in hand, like a young knight, and that would  appeal to the warlike French.    
They deemed it wise to stay in the inn for a while, but two or three  hours later Willet went out, returning soon, and showing some  excitement.    
"An old friend has come," he said.    
"A friend!" said Robert. "I know of no friend to expect."    
"I used the word 'friend' in exactly the opposite sense. It's an enemy.  I'm quite sure nobody in the world hates us more."    
"Tandakora!"    
"None other. It's the sanguinary Ojibway, his very self. I saw him  stalking along the streets of Quebec in the most hideous paint that man  ever mixed, a walking monument of savage pride, and I've no doubt in my  mind either why he came here."    
"To get some sort of revenge upon us."    
"That's it. He'll go before the Governor General, and charge that we  attacked him in the gorge and slew good, innocent men of his."    
"Tandakora is cunning," said Tayoga. "The Great Bear is right. He will  lie many times against us, and it is likely that the Frenchmen, de  Courcelles and Jumonville, will come also and tell that they met us in  the woods, although they said smooth words to us when we left them."    
"And we don't know what kind of a net they'll try to weave around us,"  said Willet. "I say again I wish we'd delivered our letters and were out  of Quebec."    
But Robert could not agree with the hunter and Tayoga. He was still glad  of the lucky chance that had taken away the Governor General. There was  also a certain keen delight in speculating what their enemies would do  next. Conscious of right and strength he believed they could foil all  attempts upon them, and while the question was still fresh in his mind  Father Philibert Drouillard came in. Wrapped closely in his black robe  he looked taller, leaner, and more ascetic than ever, and his gaze was  even stronger and more penetrating. Now it rested upon Robert.    
"I had a fair opinion of you," he said. "Coming with you in the  <i>Frontenac</i> down the river I judged you, despite your weapons and the  fact that you belong to another race than mine, a gentle youth and full  of the virtues. Now I find that you have been fighting and fighting with  intent to kill."    
"Hold hard, Father," said Willet in a good-humored tone. "Only half of  that is true. Your information is not full. He has been fighting, but  not with intent to kill. He held the life of Count Jean de Mezy on the  point of his sword, but gave it back to him, such as it was."    
The deep eyes of the priest smoldered. Perhaps there was a distant and  fiery youth of his own that the morning's deed recalled, but his  menacing gaze relaxed.    
"If you gave him back his life when you could have taken it, you have  done well," he said. "As the hunter intimates, it is a life of little  value, perhaps none at all, but you did not on that account have any  right to take it. And I say more, that if the misadventure had to happen  to any Frenchman here in Quebec I am glad it happened to one of the  wicked tribe of Bigot."    
"Your man Bigot, powerful though he may be, seems to have plenty of  enemies," said the hunter.    
"He has many, but not enough, I fear," said the priest gloomily. "He and  his horde are a terrible weight upon the shoulders of New France. But I  should not talk of these things to you who are our enemies, and who may  soon be fighting us."    
He quit the subject abruptly, and talked in a desultory manner on  irrelevant matters. But Robert saw that Quebec itself and the struggle  between the powerful Bigot ring and the <i>honnetes gens</i> was a much  greater weight on his mind than the approaching war with the English  colonies.    
After a stay of a half hour he departed, saying that he was going to  visit a parish farther down the river, and might not see them again, but  he wished them well. He also bade them once more to beware of Tandakora.    
"A good man and a strong one," said Willet, when, he left. "I seem to  feel a kindred spirit in him, but I don't think his prevision about not  seeing us again is right, though his advice to look out for Tandakora is  certainly worth following."    
They saw the Ojibway warrior twice that afternoon. Either he concealed  the effects of the wound in his shoulder or it had healed rapidly, since  he was apparently as vigorous as ever and gave them murderous glances.  Tayoga shrugged his shoulders.    
"Tandakora has followed us far," he said, "but this is not the ground  that suits him. The forest is better than a city for the laying of an  ambush."    
"Still, we'll watch him," said Willet.    
The evening witnessed the arrival at the Inn of the Eagle of two new  guests to whom Monsieur Berryer paid much deference, Colonel de  Courcelles and Captain de Jumonville, who had been on an expedition in  behalf of His Majesty, King Louis, into the forests of the south and  west, and who, to the great surprise of the innkeeper, seemed to be well  acquainted with the three.    
Robert, Tayoga and Willet were having their dinner, or supper as it  would have been called in the Province of New York, when the two  Frenchmen dressed in their neat, close-fitting uniforms and with all the  marks of travel removed, came into the large room. They rose at once and  exchanged greetings. Robert, although he did not trust them, felt that  they had no cause of quarrel with the two, and it was no part of his  character to be brusque or seek trouble.    
De Courcelles gave them a swift, comprehensive glance, and then said,  as if they were chance visitors to Quebec:    
"You've arrived ahead of us, I see, and as I learn, you find the Marquis  Duquesne away. Perhaps, if your letters are urgent, you would care to  present them to the Intendant, Monsieur Bigot, a man of great perception  and judgment."    
Robert turned his examining look with interest. Was he also one of  Bigot's men, or did he incline to the cause of the <i>honnetes gens?</i> Or,  even if he were not one of Bigot's followers, did he prefer that  Robert's mission should fail through a delivery of his letters to the  wrong man? Bigot certainly was not one with whom the English could deal  easily, since so far as Robert could learn he was wrapped in the folds  of a huge conceit.    
"We might do that," the youth replied, "but I don't think it's quite  proper. I make no secret of the fact that I bear letters for the  Governor General of Canada, and it would not be pleasing to the Governor  of the Province of New York for me to deliver them to someone else."    
"It was merely a suggestion. Let us dismiss it."    
He did not speak again of the immediate affairs that concerned them so  vitally, but talked of Paris, where he had spent a gay youth. He saw the  response in the glowing eyes of Robert, and exerted himself to please.  Moreover his heart was in his subject. Quebec was a brilliant city for  the New World, but Paris was the center of the whole world, the flower  of all the centuries, the city of light, of greatness and of genius.  The throne of the Bourbons was the most powerful in modern times, and  they were a consecrated family.    
Robert followed him eagerly. Both he and de Courcelles saw the Bourbons  as they appeared to be before the fall, and not as the world has seen  them since, in the light of revelation. The picture of Paris and its  splendors, painted by one who loved it, flung over him a powerful spell,  and only the warning words Willet had spoken recalled to him that the  Bourbon throne might not really be made for all time.    
De Courcelles and Jumonville, who had no permanent quarters in Quebec,  would remain two days at the inn, and, on the whole, Robert was glad. He  felt that the three could protect themselves from possible wiles and  stratagems of the two Frenchmen, and that they meant to attempt them he  believed he had proof later, as de Courcelles suggested they might call  in the course of the evening upon the Intendant, Bigot, who was then at  his palace. They need not say anything about their mission, but good  company could be found there, and they might be sure of a welcome from  the Intendant. Again Robert declined, and de Courcelles did not press  the matter. He and Jumonville withdrew presently, saying they had a  report to make to the commandant of the garrison, and the three went to  bed soon afterward.    
Tayoga, who slept lightly, awoke after midnight and went to a window.  The Onondaga, most of the three, distrusted Quebec. It was never Quebec  to him. It was Stadacona of the Ganeagaono, the great warrior nation of  the Hodenosaunee who stood beside the Onondagas, their lost Stadacona,  but their Stadacona still. In his heart too burned the story of  Frontenac and how he had ravaged the country of the Hodenosaunee with  fire and sword. He was here in the very shrine and fortress of the  ancient enemies of the great Iroquois. He had taken the education of the  white man, he had read in his books and he knew much of the story of the  human race, but nothing had ever disturbed his faith that a coming chief  of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the mighty League of  the Hodenosaunee was, by right, and in fact, a prince among men.    
But while Tayoga learned what civilization, as the European races called  it, had to offer, it did not make him value any the less the arts and  lore of his own forest. Rather, they increased in size and importance by  comparison. He had seen how the talk of de Courcelles had lighted a fire  in the soul of Lennox, he had seen how even Willett, the wary, had been  stirred, but he, Tayoga, had been left cold. He had read the purpose  behind it all, and never for an instant did he let himself put any faith  in de Courcelles or Jumonville.    
The air of the room was heavy and fetid to Tayoga. His free spirit  detected poison in the atmosphere of Quebec, and, for the moment, he  longed to be in the great, pure wilderness, pure at least to one of his  race. He opened the window more widely and inhaled the breeze which was  coming from the north, out of vast clean forests, that no white man  save the trapper had ever entered.    
He looked upward, at first toward the blue sky and its clustering stars,  and then, turning his eyes to the open space near the inn, caught sight  of two shadowy figures. The Onondaga was alert upon the instant, because  he knew those figures, thin though they seemed in the dusk. One was  Tandakora, the Ojibway, and the other was Auguste de Courcelles, Colonel  in the French army, a pair most unlike, yet talking together earnestly  now.    
Tayoga was not at all surprised. He had pierced the mind of de  Courcelles and he had expected him to seek Tandakora. He watched them a  full five minutes, until the Ojibway slipped away in the darkness, and  de Courcelles turned back toward the inn, walking slowly, and apparently  very thoughtful.    
Tayoga thought once of going outside to follow Tandakora, but he decided  that no good object would be served by it and remained at the window,  where the wind out of the cold north could continue to blow upon him. He  knew that the Indian and de Courcelles had entered into some conspiracy,  but he believed they could guard against it, and in good time it would  disclose itself.    
There might be many hidden trails in a city like Quebec, but he meant to  discover the one that Tandakora followed. He remained an hour at the  window, and then without awaking his comrades to tell what he had seen  went back to his bed. Nor did he say anything about it when they awoke  in the morning. He preferred to keep Tandakora as his especial charge.  A coming chief of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the  great League of the Hodenosaunee, would know how to deal with a savage  Ojibway out of the western forests.    
At breakfast, Robert wondered what they would do during the coming day,  as it was not advisable to go much about Quebec owing to the notoriety  the duel had brought to them. Monsieur Berryer, suave, deferential and  full of gossip, informed them that the fame of young Mr. Lennox as a  master of the sword had spread through the city in a few hours. Brave  and skillful young Frenchmen were anxious to meet him and prove that  where Count Jean de Mezy had failed they might succeed.    
"The young gentleman will not lack opportunities for honor and glory in  Quebec," said Monsieur Berryer, rubbing his fat, white hands.    
"In view of our errand here you must let all these opportunities go,  Robert," said Willet. "If we show ourselves too much some of these hot  young French knights will force a fight upon you, not because they hate  you, but from sporting motives. But it would be just as bad for you to  lose your life in a friendly duel as in one full of hate."    
Robert chafed, nevertheless. The Inn of the Eagle was a good inn, but he  did not wish to spend an entire day within its walls. Young Captain  Louis de Galisonniere solved the problem, arriving just after breakfast  with a note addressed to Mr. Robert Lennox, which proved to be an  invitation for all three of them from Monsieur Francois Bigot,  Intendant of Canada, to attend a dinner given by him that evening at his  palace. The letter was full of polite phrases. The Intendant had heard  of young Mr. Lennox's surpassing skill with the sword, and of his  success with Count Jean de Mezy, who wielded a good blade himself. But  neither the Intendant nor those associated with him bore any ill will.  It was well known that Mr. Lennox was accredited with letters to the  Marquis Duquesne, but in the absence of the Governor General it would be  the pleasure of the Intendant to show courtesy to the messenger of the  Governor of the Province of New York and his comrades.    
It was a full and abounding letter, swarming with polite phrases, and it  appealed to Robert. Bigot might be corrupt, but he belonged to the great  world, and Robert felt that since he had come to Quebec he ought to see  the Intendant, his palace and what was done within its walls. It was  true that they had evaded suggestions to meet him, but a formal  invitation was different. He passed the letter to Willet, who read it  and handed it to Tayoga.    
"We'll have to go, Robert," said the hunter. "It's evident that Bigot  wants us, and if we don't accept he may make trouble for us. Yes, it's  wiser to go."    
Robert's eyes shone and Willet noticed it.    
"You'd have been disappointed if I had counseled a negative," he said.    
"I would," said Robert frankly. "I'm looking forward to the dinner with  the Intendant. Will you be there, Captain de Galisonniere?"    
"Yes, and I'm glad you've accepted. Mr. Willet was right when he said  it was wisdom to go. The Intendant is the most powerful man in Canada.  'Tis said that the Governor General, the Marquis Duquesne, will return  to France before long, and hence he lets a part of his authority slip  into the hands of Monsieur Bigot. You understand the dual nature of our  government in Canada. The Governor General is the immediate personal  representative of the King, but the Intendant is supreme over the  courts, finance, commerce and all the civil affairs of the country. So a  mighty power is lodged in his hands and it's also true here, as well as  elsewhere, that he who holds the purse holds more than the sword."    
"Will Colonel de Courcelles and Captain de Jumonville be there?"  continued Robert.    
"Undoubtedly. They belong to the military arm, of course, but they are  both favorites of Bigot, and they neglect no opportunity to strengthen  their position with him. Be careful what you say before them."    
Robert thanked him for his caution, although it was not needed, as he  had already resolved to be very wary in the presence of de Courcelles  and Jumonville, and the Onondaga also made a mental note of it, knowing  that de Courcelles was willing to plot in the dusk with a savage  Ojibway.    
De Galisonniere did not stay long, and after his departure Robert and  his friends reconsidered their determination, deciding that it was best  to brave Quebec and whatever it should have to offer in the full light  of day. The hunter's apprehensions that a quarrel might be forced upon  them were not justified, as Canadian and French politeness held true,  and they were received only with curiosity and interest.    
They gazed again at the great stone buildings and also took a brief view  of the Intendant's palace, where they expected to dine in the evening.  It was a palace in extent, but not in beauty, a great rambling building  of both timber and masonry, with a green lawn and flower gardens near  by. It was said that Bigot and his predecessors had spent huge sums on  the interior decoration, but that Robert expected soon to see for  himself.    
Returning to the Inn of the Eagle late in the afternoon, they began to  array themselves for Bigot's dinner, not wishing the Bostonnais to  appear at a disadvantage before the <i>noblesse</i> of Quebec. Monsieur  Berryer sent them a barber, Gaston, who not only shaved the two white  faces, but who powdered and arranged their queues, and also manicured  their nails and gave their coats and waistcoats a rakish set, which he  assured them was quite the latest mode in Paris. Robert took all his  advice. He was very particular about his attire, knowing that however  much the jealous might criticize fine dress it always had its effect.    
The hunter watched Robert as he and Gaston arranged the new Paris styles  with a look that was almost paternal. The fine youth had exceeded  Willet's best hopes. Tall, straight, frank and open, he had the sound  mind in the sound body which is the sum of excellence, and the hunter  was glad to see him particular. It was a part of his heritage, and  became him.    
They were not to leave the Inn of the Eagle until after dusk, and Willet  suggested that they should not start until late, as they could walk to  the palace in a few minutes. But Robert said boldly that they would not  walk. It was fitting for the messengers of the Governor of New York to  ride and he would have Monsieur Berryer to call a caleche. Willet  assented with a laugh.    
"You're right, Robert," he said, "but I ride so little in carriages that  I didn't think of it."    
The night was rather dark, but when the three in the caleche approached  the palace they saw many men holding torches, and many people back of  them watching. The entertainments of Francois Bigot were famous in  Quebec for lavish splendor, and the uninvited usually came in numbers to  see the guests go in.    
"Be on your guard tonight, Robert," whispered Willet. "This is a society  to which you're not used, although I'll not deny that you could soon  learn it. But the French think we English, whether English English or  American English, are inferior in wit and quickness to themselves, and  there may be some attempts at baiting the bear before we leave."    
Robert felt his breath coming a little more quickly, and in the dusk,  Willet did not see the glow that appeared in his eyes. They might try to  "bait the bear" but he would be ready. The new powers that he had found  in himself not only accepted the challenge, but craved it. He was  conscious that he was not deficient in wit and quickness himself, and  if any follower of Francois Bigot, or if the great Bigot himself tried  to make sport of him he might find instead that the ruffler was  furnishing sport for the Bostonnais. So it was with a beating heart but  no apprehension that he alighted from the caleche with his friends, and  went into the palace to meet the Intendant.    
The interior of the great building was a singular mixture of barbaric  and civilized splendor, the American forests and the factories of France  alike being drawn upon for its furnishings. The finest of silken  tapestries and the rarest of furs often hung close together. Beyond the  anterooms was a large hall in which the chosen guests danced while the  people might look on from galleries that surrounded it. These people,  who were not so good as the guests, could dance as much as they pleased  in a second hall set aside exclusively for their use. In another and  more secluded but large room all kinds of games of chance to which Bigot  and his followers were devoted were in progress. In the huge dining-room  the table was set for forty persons, the usual number, until the war  came, when it was reduced to twenty, and Bigot gave a dinner there  nearly every evening, unless he was absent from Quebec.    
Robert felt as soon as he entered the palace that he had come into a  strange, new, exotic atmosphere, likely to prove intoxicating to the  young, and he remembered the hunter's words of warning. Yet his spirit  responded at once to the splendor and the call of a gayer and more  gorgeous society than any he had ever known. Wealth and great houses  existed even then in New York and upon occasion their owners made full  use of both, but there was a restraint about the Americans, the English  and the Dutch. Their display was often heavy and always decorous, and in  Quebec he felt for the first time the heedless gayety of the French,  when the Bourbon monarchy had passed its full bloom, and already was in  its brilliant decay. Truly, they could have carved over the doorway,  "Leave all fear and sorrow behind, ye who enter here."    
There were lights everywhere, flaming from tall silver candlesticks, and  uniforms, mostly in white and silver, or white with black or violet  facings, were thick in the rooms. Ladies, too, were present, in silk or  satin billowing in many a fold, their powdered hair rolled high in the  style made fashionable by Madame Jeanne Poisson de Pompadour. From an  inner room came the music of a band softly playing French songs or airs  from the Florentine opera. The air was charged with odors of perfume.    
It <i>was</i> intoxicating, and yet it was pleasant. No, "pleasant" was not  the word, it was alluring, it played upon the senses, it threw a glow  over the rooms and the people, and the youth saw everything through a  tawny mist that heightened and deepened the colors. He was glad that he  had come. Nor was "glad" the word either. Seeing what he now saw and  knowing what he now knew, he would have blamed himself bitterly had he  stayed away.    
"Welcome, Mr. Lennox, my brave and generous opponent of the morning,"  said a voice, and, looking through the tawny mist, he saw the man whom  he had fought and spared, Count Jean de Mezy, in a wonderful coat,  waistcoat and knee breeches of white satin, heavily embroidered, white  silk stockings, and low white shoes with great silver buckles, and a  small gold-hilted sword hanging at his thigh. The cheeks, a trifle too  fat, were mottled again, but his manner like his costume was silken. One  would have thought that he and not Robert was the victor in that trial  of skill by the St. Louis gate.    
"Welcome, Mr. Lennox," he said again in a tone that showed no malice.  "The Intendant's ball will be all the more brilliant for the presence of  yourself and your friends. What a splendid figure the young Onondaga  chief makes!"    
Tayoga bowed to the compliment, which was rather broad but true, and de  Mezy ran on:    
"We are accustomed here to the presence of Indian chiefs. We French have  known how to win the trust and friendship of the warriors and we ask  them to our parlors and our tables as you English do not do, although I  will confess that the Iroquois hitherto have come into Canada as enemies  and not as friends."    
"Quebec was once the Stadacona of the Ganeagaono, known to you as the  Mohawks," said Tayoga in his deep musical voice, "and there is no record  that they ever gave or sold it to Onontio."    
De Mezy was embarrassed for a moment, but he recovered himself quickly  and laughed.    
"You have us there!" he cried, "but it was long, long ago, when Cartier  came to Quebec. Times change and ownerships change with them. We can't  roll back the past."    
Tayoga said no more, content to remind the French at intervals that a  brother nation of the Hodenosaunee still asserted its title to Quebec.    
"You are not the only member of the great red race present," said de  Mezy to Tayoga. "We have a chief from the far west, a splendid type of  the forest man. What size! What strength! What a mien! By my faith, he  would make a stir in Paris!"    
"Tandakora, the Ojibway!" said Robert.    
"Yes, but how did you know?"    
"We have met him--more than once. We have had dealings with him, and we  may have more. He seems to be interested in what we're doing, and hence  we're never surprised when we see him."    
De Mezy looked puzzled, but at that moment de Courcelles and de  Jumonville, wearing uniforms of white and silver, came forward to add  their greeting to those of the count. They were all courtesy and the  words dropped from their lips like honey, but Robert felt that their  souls were not like the soul of de Galisonniere, and that they could not  be counted among the <i>honnetes gens</i>. But the three Frenchmen were ready  now to present the three travelers to Monsieur Francois Bigot, Intendant  of Canada, great and nearly all powerful, and Robert judged too that  they had made no complaint against his friends and himself.    
Bigot was standing near the entrance to the private dancing room, and  about him was a numerous company, including ladies, among them the wife  of Pean, to whom the gossip of the time gave great influence with him,  and a certain Madame Marin and her sister, Madame de Rigaud, and others.  As the three approached under the conduct of the three Frenchmen the  group opened out, and they were presented in order, Robert first.    
The youth was still under the influence of the lights, the gorgeous  rooms and the brilliant company, but he gazed with clear eyes and the  most eager interest at Bigot, whose reputation had spread far, even in  the British colonies. He saw a man of middle years, portly, his red face  sprinkled with many pimples, probably from high living, not handsome and  perhaps at first repellent, but with an expression of vigor and ease,  and an open, frank manner that, at length, attracted. His dress was much  like de Mezy's, but finer perhaps.    
Such was the singular man who had so much to do with the wrecking of New  France, a strange compound of energy and the love of luxury, lavish with  hospitality, an untiring worker, a gambler, a profligate, a thief of  public funds, he was also kindly, gracious and devoted to his friends. A  strange bundle of contradictions and disjointed morals, he represented  in the New World the glittering decadence that marked the French  monarchy at home. Now he was smiling as de Mezy introduced Robert with  smooth words.    
"Mr. Robert Lennox of Albany and New York," he said, "the brilliant  young swordsman of whom I spoke to you, the one who disarmed me this  morning, but who was too generous to take my life."    
Bigot's smiling gaze rested upon Robert, who was conscious, however,  that there was much penetration behind the smile. The Intendant would  seek to read his mind, and perhaps to learn the nature of the letters he  brought, before they were delivered to their rightful owner, the Marquis  Duquesne. Quebec was the home of intrigue, and the Intendant's palace  was the heart of it, but if Robert's pulse beat fast it was with  anticipation and not with fear.    
"It was fortune more than skill," he said. "The Count de Mezy credits me  with too much knowledge of the sword."    
"No," said Bigot, laughing, "Jean wouldn't do that. He'd credit you with  all you have, and no more. Jean, like the rest of us, doesn't relish a  defeat, do you, Jean?"    
De Mezy reddened, but he forced a laugh.    
"I suppose that nobody does!" he replied, "but when I suffer one I try  to make the best of it."    
"That's an honest confession, Jean," said Bigot, "and you'll feel better  for making it."    
He seemed now to Robert bluff, genial, all good nature, and the youth  stood on one side, while Willet and Tayoga were presented in their turn.  Bigot looked very keenly at the Onondaga, and the answering gaze was  fierce and challenging. Robert saw that Tayoga was not moved by the  splendor, the music and the perfumed air, and that he did not forget for  an instant that this gay Quebec of the French was the Stadacona of the  Mohawks, a great brother nation of the Hodenosaunee.    
Bigot's countenance fell a little as he met the intensely hostile gaze,  but in a moment he recovered himself and began to pay compliments to  Willet and the Iroquois. Robert felt the charm of his manner and saw why  he was so strong with a great body of the French in New France. Then his  eyes wandered to the others who stood near like courtiers around a king,  and he noticed that foremost among them was a man of mean appearance and  presuming manner, none other, he soon learned, than the notorious Joseph  Cadet, confederate of Bigot, in time to become Commissary General of New  France, the son of a Quebec butcher, who had begun life as a pilot boy,  and who was now one of the most powerful men in those regions of the New  World that paid allegiance to the House of Bourbon. Near him stood Pean,  the Town Mayor of Quebec, a soldier of energy, but deep in corrupt  bargains with Cadet, and just beyond Pean was his partner, Penisseault,  and near them were their wives, of whom scandal spoke many a true word,  and beyond them were the Commissary of Marine, Varin, a Frenchman, small  and insignificant of appearance, the Intendant's secretary, Deschenaux,  the son of a shoemaker at Quebec, Cadet's trusted clerk, Corpron and  Maurin, a humpback.    
A strange and varied company, one of the strangest ever gathered in any  outlying capital of a diseased and dying monarchy. Robert, although he  knew that it was corrupt and made a mockery of many things that he had  been taught to reverence, did not yet understand how deadly was the  poison that flowed in the veins of this society. At present, he saw only  the glow and the glitter. All these people were connected closely. The  Canadians intermarrying extensively were a great family, and the  Frenchmen were bound together by the powerful tie, a common interest.    
"Don't believe all you see, Robert," whispered Willet. "You're seeing  the surface, and it's hollow, hollow! I tell you!"    
"But we have nothing like it at home," said Robert. "We're lucky to  come."    
De Mezy had left them, but de Courcelles was near, and he saw that they  were not neglected. Robert was introduced to officers and powerful  civilians and the youngest and handsomest of the ladies, whose freedom  of language surprised him, but whose wit, which played about everything,  pleased a mind peculiarly sensitive to the charm of light and brilliant  talk.    
He had never before been in such an assembly, one that contained so much  of rank and experience in the great world. Surrounded by all that he  loved best, the people, the lights, the colors, and the anticipation of  what was to come, the Intendant shone. One forgot his pimply face and  portly figure in the geniality that was not assumed, and the ease of his  manners. He spoke to Robert more than once, asked him many questions  about Albany and New York, and referred incidentally, too, to the  Iroquois, but it was all light, as if he were asking them because of  interest in his guest, or merely to make conversation.    
The hues of everything gradually grew brighter and more brilliant to  Robert. The music from the next room steeped his senses, and he began to  feel the intoxication of which Willet had warned him. Many of the guests  were of the noblest families of France, young officers who had come to  Quebec, where it was reported promotion was rapid and sure, or where  younger sons, with the aid of such powerful men as Bigot and Cadet,  could make fortunes out of the customs or in the furnishing of supplies  to the government. Robert found himself talking much, his gift of speech  responding readily to the call. He answered their jests with a jest,  their quips with a quip, and when they were serious so was he. He felt  that while there may have been an undercurrent of hostility when he  entered the palace it had all disappeared now, and he was a favorite, or  at least they took a friendly interest in him, because he was a new type  and they did not think him brusque and rude, as the French believed all  Bostonnais to be.    
And through this picturesque throng stalked the two Indians, Tayoga and  Tandakora. The Ojibway wore a feather headdress, and a scarlet blanket  of richest texture was draped around his body, its hem meeting his  finely tanned deerskin leggings, while his feet were encased in beaded  moccasins. Nevertheless he looked, in those surroundings, which belonged  so thoroughly to an exotic civilization, more gigantic and savage than  ever. Robert was well aware that Bigot had brought him there for a  political purpose, to placate and win the western tribes, and to impress  him with the power and dignity of France. But whatever he may have  felt, the Ojibway, towering half a head above the tallest white man,  save Willet, was grim and lowering. His left arm lay in a fold of his  blanket, and, as he held it stiffly, Robert knew that his wound was yet  far from healed. He and Tayoga were careful to keep away from each  other, the Onondaga because he was a guest and was aware of the white  man's amenities, and the Ojibway because he knew it was not the time and  place for his purpose.    
They went in to dinner presently and the table of Francois Bigot was  splendid as became the powerful Intendant of New France, who had plenty  of money, who was lavish with it and who, when it was spent, knew where  to obtain more with ease and in abundance. Forty guests sat down, and  the linen, the silver and the china were worthy of the King's palace at  Versailles. A lady was on Robert's right and Colonel de Courcelles was  on his left. Willet and Tayoga were farther down on his own side of the  table, and he could not see them, unless he leaned forward, which he was  too well mannered to do. Bigot sat at the foot of the table and at its  head was Madame Pean, a native of Canada, born Mademoiselle Desmeloizes,  young, handsome and uncommonly vivacious, dressed gorgeously in the  latest Parisian style, and, as Robert put it to himself, coruscating  with talk and smiles.    
The dinner progressed amid a great loosening of tongues and much wit.  The perfume from the flowers on the table and the continuous playing of  the band made the air heavier and more intoxicating. It seemed to  Robert that if these people had any cares they had dismissed them all  for the time. Their capacity for pleasure, for snatching at the incense  of the fleeting moment, amazed him. War might be coming, but tonight  there was no thought of it.    
Bigot toasted the two Bostonnais and the young Iroquois chief who were  his guests in a flowery speech and Robert responded. When he rose to his  feet he felt a moment of dizziness, because he was so young, and because  he felt so many eyes upon him. But the gift of speech came to his  aid--he was not the golden-mouthed for nothing. The heavy sweet odor of  the roses was in his nostrils, inspiring him to liquid words, and  everything glittered before him.    
He had the most friendly feeling for all in the room except Tandakora,  and a new thought coming into his mind he spoke it aloud. He was,  perhaps, in advance of his time, but he told them that New France and  the British colonies could dwell in peace, side by side. Why should they  quarrel? America was vast. British and French were almost lost in its  forests. France and England together could be stowed away in the region  about the Great Lakes and the shades of the wilderness would encompass  them both. The French and British were great races, it was useless to  compare them and undertake to say which was the greater, because each  was great in its own way, and each excelled in its own particulars, but  the two combined were the sum of manly virtues and strength. What the  British lacked the French supplied, and what the French lacked the  British supplied. Together they could rule the world and spread  enlightenment.    
He sat down and the applause was great and hearty, because he had spoken  with fervor and well. His head was singing, and he was confused a  little, after an effort that had induced emotion. Moreover, the band had  begun to play again some swaying, lilting dance tune, and his pulses  beat to its measure. But he did lean forward, in spite of his manners,  and caught Willet's approving look, for which he was very glad. He  received the compliments of the lady on his right and of de Courcelles,  then the band ceased presently and he became conscious that Tayoga was  speaking. He had not heard Bigot call upon him, but that he had called  was evident.    
Tayoga stood up, tall, calm and dignified. He too had the oratorical  power which was afterward displayed so signally by the Seneca who was  first called by his own people Otetiani and was later known as  Sagoyewatha, but who was known to the white men as Red Jacket.    
"I speak to you not as a Frenchman nor as an Englishman," said Tayoga,  "but as a warrior of the clan of the Bear of the nation Onondaga, of the  great League of the Hodenosaunee. Most of this land belonged to our  fathers before ever Englishmen or Frenchmen crossed the great water and  put foot upon these shores. Where you sit now was Stadacona, the village  of our brother race, the Mohawks. Frenchmen or Englishmen may make war  upon one another, or they may make peace with one another, but the  Hodenosaunee cannot be forgotten. There are many beautiful rivers and  lakes and forests to the south and west, but they do not belong to  either Onontio or Corlear. The laws of the fifty sachems who sit in  council in the vale of Onondaga run there, and those who leave them out,  be they French or English, reckon ill. There was a time when Frontenac  came raiding their villages, burning and slaying, but we did not know  the use of firearms then. Now we do know their use and have them, and in  battle we can meet the white man on equal terms, be he English or  French. I have been to the white man's school and I have learned that  there are other great continents beyond the sea. I do not know what may  happen in them, nor does it matter, but in this vast continent which you  call America the wars and treaties of the English and the French are  alike unavailing, unless they consider the wishes of the Hodenosaunee."    
He spoke in a manner inexpressibly haughty, and when he had finished he  swept the table from end to end with his challenging glance, then he sat  down amid a deep silence. But they were French. They understood that he  had tossed a glove among them, their quick minds saw that the challenge  was intended not alone for them, but for the English as well, unless the  rights of the Hodenosaunee were respected, and such a speech at such a  time appealed to their gallant instincts. After a moment or two of  silence the applause burst forth in a storm.    
"'Twas a fair warning," said de Courcelles in Robert's ear, "and 'twas  meant for us both."    
It was on Robert's tongue to reply that the English were included for  the sake of courtesy, as they were the friends of the Hodenosaunee and  always kept faith with them, but second thought stopped the words on his  lips. Then the band began again, playing a warm song of the south from  the Florentine opera, and the talk increased. It seemed to Robert that  everybody spoke at once, and his senses were again steeped in the music  and the perfumed air, and the sound of so many voices. Presently he  realized that some one across the table was speaking to him.    
"The Onondaga said bold words in behalf of his league, but can he prove  them true?" the voice was saying.    
There was something provocative in his tone, and Robert looked closely  at the speaker. He saw a tall man of at least forty-five, thin but  obviously very powerful and agile. Robert noticed that his wrists were  thick like his own and that his fingers were long and flexible. His face  was freckled, his nose large and curved, giving to his face an  uncommonly fierce appearance, and his eyes were black and set close  together. It was a strong countenance and, when Robert looked at him,  the black brows were drawn together in a frown. His words undoubtedly  had a challenge in them, and the youth replied:    
"When Tayoga speaks he speaks from his head as well as his heart, and I  who am his sworn brother, although we are of different races, know that  he doesn't boast when he refers to the power of the Hodenosaunee."    
"And may it not be possible, sir, that you have been deceived by your  friendship?"    
Robert looked at him in surprise. The man's manner was pointed as if he  were making an issue, and so he did not answer just then, but de  Courcelles by his side leaned forward a little and said:    
"Perhaps, Mr. Lennox, you have not yet been introduced formally to the  chevalier, Chevalier Pierre Boucher, who has been only a year from  Paris, but who is already a comrade good and true."    
"No, I don't think I've been deceived," replied Robert, keeping his  temper, and bowing to the introduction. "The Hodenosaunee, better known  to you as the Iroquois, are a very powerful league, as many of the  villages of Canada can tell."    
The man's face darkened.    
"Is it wise," he asked, "to remind us of the ferocious deeds the  Iroquois have done upon us,"    
But de Courcelles intervened.    
"Peace! Peace, chevalier!" he said in a good-humored tone. "Mr. Lennox  meant no innuendo. He merely stated a fact to prove a contention."    
The chevalier subsided into silence, but Robert saw a significant look  pass between them, and instantly he became keen and watchful. What did  it mean? Willet's warning words came back to him. The more he studied  Boucher the less he liked him. With his thin face, and great hooked  nose, and long, bony fingers like talons, he reminded him of some great  bird of prey. He noticed also that while the others were drinking wine,  although he himself did not, the chevalier was the only one within his  view who also abstained.    
The dinner was long. One or two of the ladies sang to the music, another  danced, and then de Galisonniere, in a full, round tenor voice, sang  "The Bridge of Avignon."    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Hier sur le pont d'Avignon <br> J'ai oui chanter la belle <br>  Lon, la, <br> J'ai oui chanter la belle, <br> Elle chantait d'un ton si doux <br> Comme une demoiselle <br>  Lon, la, <br> Comme une demoiselle."</small></i></blockquote><br>
It was singularly appealing, and for a moment tears came to the eyes of  all those who were born in France. They saw open fields, stone fences,  and the heavy grapes hanging in the vineyards, instead of the huge  rivers, the vast lakes and the mighty wilderness that curved almost to  their feet. But it was only for a moment. This was Quebec, the seat of  the French power in America, and they were in the Intendant's palace,  the very core and heart of it. The laughter that had been hushed for a  thoughtful instant or two came back in full tide, and once more the  Chevalier Pierre Boucher spoke to Robert.    
"The songs of our France are beautiful," he said. "None other have in  them so much of poetry and haunting lament."    
The youth detected as before the challenging under note in a remark that  otherwise would have seemed irrelevant, and an angry contradiction  leaped swiftly to his lips, but with the recollection of Willet's  warning look he restrained himself again.    
"France has many beautiful things," he replied quietly.    
"Well spoken, Mr. Lennox! A compliment to us from one of another race is  worth having," said de Courcelles. But Robert thought he saw that  significant look pass for a second time between de Courcelles and  Boucher. The long dinner drew to its close and the invited guests passed  into the private ballroom, where the band began to play dance music. In  the other ballroom, the one intended for the general public, the people  were dancing already, and another band was playing.    
Now Bigot was in his element, swelling with importance and good humor,  easy, graceful, jesting with men and women, wishing the world well,  knowing that he could milk from the royal treasury the money he was  spending tonight, and troubled by no twinges of conscience. Cadet  hovered near his powerful partner and Pean, Maurin, Penisseault and  Corpron were not far away. Robert looked with interest at the ballroom  which was decorated gorgeously. The balcony was filled already with  spectators who would watch the lords and ladies dance. There was no  restraint. No Father Drouillard was present to give rebuke and all the  <i>honnetes gens</i> were absent, unless a few young officers like de  Galisonniere, who sympathized with them, be excepted.    
They began to dance to light, tripping music, and to Robert all the  women seemed beautiful and graceful now, and all the men gay and  gallant. He could dance the latest dances himself, and meant to do so  soon, but for the present he would wait, standing by the wall and  looking on. Willet came to him, and evidently intended to whisper  something, but de Courcelles, by the youth's side, intervened  laughingly.    
"No secrets, Mr. Willet," he said. "No grave and serious matters can be  discussed at the Intendant's ball. It is one of our rules that when we  work we work and when we play we play. It is a useful lesson which you  Bostonnais should learn."    
Then Jumonville came and began to talk to the hunter in such direct  fashion that he was compelled to respond, and presently he was drawn  away, leaving Robert with de Courcelles.    
"You at least dance, do you not?" asked de Courcelles.    
"Yes," replied Robert, "I learned it at Albany."    
"Shall I get you a partner?"    
"In a little while, if you will be so good, Colonel de Courcelles, but  just now I'd rather see the others dancing. A most brilliant assemblage.  I never beheld its like before."    
"Brilliant for Quebec," said a voice at his elbow, "but you should go to  Paris, the very heart and center of the world, to see great pleasure and  great splendor in the happiest combination."    
It was the grim and freckle-faced Boucher, and again Robert detected  that challenging under note in his voice. In spite of himself his blood  grew hot.    
"I don't know much about Paris," he said. "I've never been there,  although I hope to go some day, but Quebec affords both pleasure and  splendor in high degree tonight."    
"You don't mean to say that Quebec, much as we French have labored to  build it up here in the New World, can compare with Paris?"    
Robert stared at him in astonishment. Both manner and tone were now  certainly aggressive, and as far as he could see aggressive about  nothing. Why should anyone raise an issue between Quebec and Paris, and  above all at such a time, there at Bigot's ball? He refused to be drawn  into a controversy, and shrugging his shoulders a little, he turned away  without an answer. He heard Boucher's voice raised again, but de  Courcelles laughingly waved him down.    
"Come! come, my Pierre," he said. "You're too ready to suspect that  someone is casting aspersions upon that beloved Paris of ours. Perhaps  you and I shall have the pleasure of showing the great city to Mr.  Lennox some day."    
He hooked his hand in Robert's arm and drew him away.    
"Don't mind Boucher," he said. "He has a certain brusqueness of manner  at times, although he is a good soul. He can't bear for anyone to  suggest that another city, even one of our own, could possibly rival  Paris in any particular. It's his pet devotion, and we won't disturb him  in it. There's your friend, Tayoga, standing by the wall with his arms  folded across his chest. What a splendid savage!"    
"He's not a savage. Tayoga was educated in our schools and he has both  the white man's learning and the red man's. He has the virtues, too, of  both races, and few, very few of their vices."    
"You're an enthusiast about your friend."    
"And so would you be if you knew him as well as I do. That little speech  he made showed his courage and the greatness of his soul."    
"Spoken at such a time, its appeal was strong. I don't want to boast of  my race, Mr. Lennox, but the French always respond to a gallant act."    
"I know it, and I know, too, that if we English, and Americans or  Bostonnais, as you call us, do go to war with you we could not possibly  have a more enterprising or dangerous foe."    
Colonel de Courcelles bowed to the compliment, and then with a nod  indicated Tandakora, also standing against the wall, huge, sullen and  looking like a splash of red flame, wrapped in his long scarlet blanket.    
"He, at least, is a savage," he said.    
"That I readily admit," said Robert.    
"And as you know by the charges that he made against you to me, he  wishes you and your comrades no good."    
"I know by those charges and by events that have occurred since.  Tandakora is a savage through and through, and as such my comrades and I  must guard against him."    
"But the Ojibway is a devoted friend of ours," said a harsh voice over  his shoulders.    
He turned and saw the lowering face of Boucher, and once more he was  amazed. De Courcelles did not give the youth time to answer. Again he  laughingly waved Boucher away.    
"Pierre, my friend," he said, "you seem to be seeking points of issue  tonight. Now, I refuse to let you and Mr. Lennox quarrel over the  manners, habits and personal characteristics of Tandakora. Come, Mr.  Lennox, I'm about to present you to a lady with whom you are going to  dance."    
Robert went away with him and he saw that Boucher, who was left behind,  was frowning, but he danced with the lady and others, and as the  excitement of the moment mounted again to his head he forgot all about  Boucher. He saw too that de Galisonniere had abandoned his restraint,  and had plunged into the gayety with all the enthusiasm and delight of  one to whom pleasure was natural. After a while de Courcelles hooked his  arm again in Robert's and said: "Come, I'll show you something."    
He led the way down a narrow passage, and then into a large apartment,  well lighted, though not so brilliantly as the ballroom. A clicking  sound had preceded their entrance, and Robert was aware that he was in  the famous gambling room of Monsieur Bigot. Nearly twenty men, including  the Intendant himself, Cadet and Pean, were there, gambling eagerly with  cards or dice.    
And standing by one of the tables, a frown on his freckled face, Robert  also saw the man, Boucher.
