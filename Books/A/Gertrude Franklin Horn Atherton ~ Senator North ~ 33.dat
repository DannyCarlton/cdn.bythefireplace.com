He did not allude to the subject again by so much as a tender glance,  and Betty, who knew the power of man to exasperate, appreciated his  consideration. She wondered how deep his actual knowledge of women  went, how much of his success with them he owed to the strong manly  instincts springing from a subsoil of sound common-sense which had  carried him safely past so many of the pitfalls of life.    
Nor did his high spirits wane. He stayed out of doors, in the forest  or on the lake, until midnight, and was up again at five in the  morning. Betty was fond of fresh air and exercise, but she had so much  of both during the two days of his visit that she went to bed on the  night of his departure with a sense of being drugged with ozone and  battered with energy. The next day she did not rise until ten, and was  still enjoying the dim seclusion of her room when Sally tapped and  entered. Miss Carter looked nervous, and her usually sallow cheeks  were flushed.    
"I've come to say something I'm almost ashamed to say, but I can't  help it," she began abruptly. "I'm going away. I can't, I <i>can't </i>sit  down at the table any longer with <i>her,</i> and treat her as an equal. I  writhe every time she calls me 'Sally.' I know it's a silly senseless  prejudice--no, it isn't. Black blood is loathsome, horrible!--and the  less there is of it the worse it is. I don't mind the out-and-out  negroes. I love the dear old darkies in the country; and even the  prosperous coloured people are tolerable so long as they don't  presume; but there is something so hideously unnatural, so repulsive,  so accursed, in an apparently white person with that hidden evidence  in him of slavery and lechery. Paugh! it is sickening. They are  walking shameless proclamations of lust and crime. I'm sorry for them.  If by any surgical process the taint could be extracted, I'd turn  philanthropic and devote half my fortune to it; but it can't be, and  I'm either not strong-minded enough, or have inherited too many  generations of fastidiousness and refinement to bring myself to  receive these outcasts as equals. I feel particularly sorry for  Harriet. She shows her cursed inheritance in more ways than one, but  without it, think what she would be,--a high-bred, intellectual,  charming woman. She just escapes being that now, but she does escape  it. The taint is all through her. And she knows it. In spite of all  you've done for her, of all you've made possible for her, she'll be  unhappy as long as she lives." "She certainly will be if everybody  discovers her secret and is as unjust as you are." Betty, like the  rest of the world, had no toleration for the weaknesses herself had  conquered. "We cannot undo great wrongs, but it is our duty to make  life a little less tragic for the victims, if we can."    
"I can't. I've tried, I've struggled with myself as I've never  struggled before, ever since I learned the truth. It sickens me. It  makes me feel the weak, contemptible, common clay of which we all are  made, and our only chance of happiness is to forget that. But I've  said all I've got to say about myself. I'm going, and that is the end  of it. I'll wear a mask till the last minute, for I wouldn't hurt the  poor thing's feelings for the world. And I'd die sixteen deaths before  I'd betray her. But, Betty, get rid of her. She wants to go to  Europe. Let her go. Keep her there. For as sure as fate her secret  will leak out in time. She <i>breathes</i> it. If I felt it, others will,  and certainty soon follows suspicion. Jack would have felt it long  since if he were not blinded and intoxicated by her beauty; but you  can't count on men. He'll soon forget her if you send her away in  time, and for your own sake as well as his get rid of her. You don't  want people avoiding your house!"    
"She is going. She has no desire to stay, poor thing! Of course, I  know how you feel. I felt that way myself at first, but I conquered  it. Others won't, I suppose, and it is best that she should go where  such prejudices don't exist. I spoke to her again a day or two ago  about it--for your idea that Jack loves her has made me nervous,  although I can see no evidence of it--and I suggested that she should  go at once; but she seems to have made up her mind to September, and  I cannot insist without wounding her feelings. I wish Jack would go  away, but he always is so much better up here than anywhere else that  I can't suggest that, either."    
"Well, I'm going now to tell papa he must prepare his mind for Bar  Harbor. Say that you forgive me, Betty, for I love you."    
"Oh, yes, I forgive you," said Betty, with a half laugh, "for a wise  man I know once said that our strongest prejudice is a part of us."
