"But you hinted at some hope, some chance of escape," Felix cried at  last, looking up from the ground and mastering his emotion. "What now is  that hope? Conceal nothing from me."    
"Monsieur," the Frenchman answered, shrugging his shoulders with an  expression of utter impotence, "I have as good reasons for wishing to  find out all that as even you can have. <i>Your</i> secret is <i>my</i> secret;  but with all my pains and astuteness I have been unable to discover  it. The natives are reticent, very reticent indeed, about all these  matters. They fear taboo; and they fear Tu-Kila-Kila. The women, to  be sure, in a moment of expansion, might possibly tell one; but, then,  the women, unfortunately, are not admitted to the mysteries. They know  no more of all these things than we do. The most I have been able to  gather for certain is this--that on the discovery of the secret depend  Tu-Kila-Kila's life and power. Every Boupari man knows this Great Taboo;  it is communicated to him in the assembly of adults when he gets tattooed  and reaches manhood. But no Boupari man ever communicates it to  strangers; and for that reason, perhaps, as I believe, Tu-Kila-Kila often  chooses for Korong, as far as possible, those persons who are cast by  chance upon the island. It has always been the custom, so far as I can  make out, to treat castaways or prisoners taken in war as gods, and then  at the end of their term to kill them ruthlessly. This plan is popular  with the people at large, because it saves themselves from the dangerous  honors of deification; but it also serves Tu-Kila-Kila's purpose, because  it usually elevates to Heaven those innocent persons who are unacquainted  with that fatal secret which is, as the natives say, Tu-Kila-Kila's  death--his word of dismissal."    
"Then if only we could find out this secret--" Felix cried.    
His new friend interrupted him. "What hope is there of your finding  it out, monsieur," he exclaimed, "you, who have only a few months to  live--when I, who have spent nine long years of exile on the island, and  seen two Tu-Kila-Kilas rise and fall, have been unable, with my utmost  pains, to discover it? <i>Tenez</i>; you have no idea yet of the superstitions  of these people, or the difficulties that lie in the way of fathoming  them. Come this way to my aviary; I will show you something that will  help you to realize the complexities of the situation."    
He rose and led the way to another cleared space at the back of the hut,  where several birds of gaudy plumage were fastened to perches on sticks  by leathery lashes of dried shark's skin, tied just above their talons.  "I am the King of the Birds, monsieur, you must remember," the Frenchman  said, fondling one of his screaming <i>proteges</i>. "These are a few of my  subjects. But I do not keep them for mere curiosity. Each of them is the  Soul of the tribe to which it belongs. This, for example--my Cluseret--is  the Soul of all the gray parrots; that that you see yonder--Badinguet,  I call him--is the Soul of the hawks; this, my Mimi, is the Soul of the  little yellow-crested kingfisher. My task as King of the Birds is to keep  a representative of each of these always on hand; in which endeavor I  am faithfully aided by the whole population of the island, who bring me  eggs and nests and young birds in abundance. If the Soul of the little  yellow kingfisher now were to die, without a successor being found ready  at once to receive and embody it, then the whole race of little yellow  kingfishers would vanish altogether; and if I myself, the King of the  Birds, who am, as it were, the Soul and life of all of them, were to die  without a successor being at hand to receive my spirit, then all the race  of birds, with one accord, would become extinct forthwith and forever."    
He moved among his pets easily, like a king among his subjects. Most of  them seemed to know him and love his presence. Presently, he came to one  very old parrot, quite different from any Felix had ever seen on any  trees in the island; it was a parrot with a black crest and a red mark on  its throat, half blind with age, and tottering on its pedestal. This  solemn old bird sat apart from all the others, nodding its head  oracularly in the sunlight, and blinking now and again with its white  eyelids in a curious senile fashion.    
The Frenchman turned to Felix with an air of profound mystery. "This  bird," he said, solemnly stroking its head with his hand, while the  parrot turned round to him and bit at his finger with half-doddering  affection--"this bird is the oldest of all my birds---is it not so,  Methuselah?--and illustrates well in one of its aspects the superstition  of these people. Yes, my friend, you are the last of a kind now otherwise  extinct, are you not, <i>mon vieux?</i> No, no, there--gently! Once upon a  time, the natives tell me, dozens of these parrots existed in the island;  they flocked among the trees, and were held very sacred; but they were  hard to catch and difficult to keep, and the Kings of the Birds, my  predecessors, failed to secure an heir and coadjutor to this one. So as  the Soul of the species, which you see here before you, grew old and  feeble, the whole of the race to which it belonged grew old and feeble  with it. One by one they withered away and died, till at last this  solitary specimen alone remained to vouch for the former existence of the  race in the island. Now, the islanders say, nothing but the Soul itself  is left; and when the Soul dies, the red-throated parrots will be gone  forever. One of my predecessors paid with his life in awful tortures for  his remissness in not providing for the succession to the soulship. I  tell you these things in order that you may see whether they cast any  light for you upon your own position; and also because the oldest and  wisest natives say that this parrot alone, among beasts or birds or  uninitiated things, knows the secret on which depends the life of the  Tu-Kila-Kila for the time being."    
"Can the parrot speak?" Felix asked, with profound emotion.    
"Monsieur, he can speak, and he speaks frequently. But not one word of  all he says is comprehensible either to me or to any other living being.  His tongue is that of a forgotten nation. The islanders understand him no  more than I do. He has a very long sermon or poem, which he knows by  heart, in some unknown language, and he repeats it often at full length  from time to time, especially when he has eaten well and feels full and  happy. The oldest natives tell a romantic legend about this strange  recitation of the good Methuselah--I call him Methuselah because of his  great age--but I do not really know whether their tale is true or purely  fanciful. You never can trust these Polynesian traditions."    
"What is the legend?" Felix asked, with intense interest. "In an island  where we find ourselves so girt round by mystery within mystery, and  taboo within taboo, as this, every key is worth trying. It is well for us  at least to learn everything we can about the ideas of the natives. Who  knows what clue may supply us at last with the missing link, which will  enable us to break through this intolerable servitude?"    
"Well, the story they tell us is this," the Frenchman replied,  "though I have gathered it only a hint at a time, from very old men, who  declared at the same moment that some religious fear--of which they have  many--prevented them from telling me any further about it. It seems that  a long time ago--how many years ago nobody knows, only that it was in the  time of the thirty-ninth Tu-Kila-Kila, before the reign of Lavita, the  son of Sami--a strange Korong was cast up upon this island by the waves  of the sea, much as you and I have been in the present generation. By  accident, says the story, or else, as others aver, through the  indiscretion of a native woman who fell in love with him, and who worried  the taboo out of her husband, the stranger became acquainted with the  secret of Tu-Kila-Kila. As the natives themselves put it, he learned the  Death of the High God, and where in the world his Soul was hidden.  Thereupon, in some mysterious way or other, he became Tu-Kila-Kila  himself, and ruled as High God for ten years or more here on this island.  Now, up to that time, the legend goes on, none but the men of the island  knew the secret; they learned it as soon as they were initiated in the  great mysteries, which occur before a boy is given a spear and admitted  to the rank of complete manhood. But sometimes a woman was told the  secret wrongfully by her husband or her lover; and one such woman,  apparently, told the strange Korong, and so enabled him to become  Tu-Kila-Kila."    
"But where does the parrot come in?" Felix asked, with still profounder  excitement than ever. Something within him seemed to tell him  instinctively he was now within touch of the special key that must sooner  or later unlock the mystery.    
"Well," the Frenchman went on, still stroking the parrot affectionately  with his hand, and smoothing down the feathers on its ruffled back, "the  strange Tu-Kila-Kila, who thus ruled in the island, though he learned to  speak Polynesian well, had a language of his own, a language of the  birds, which no man on earth could ever talk with him. So, to beguile his  time and to have someone who could converse with him in his native  dialect, he taught this parrot to speak his own tongue, and spent most of  his days in talking with it and fondling it. At last, after he had  instructed it by slow degrees how to repeat this long sermon or  poem--which I have often heard it recite in a sing-song voice from  beginning to end--his time came, as they say, and he had to give way to  another Tu-Kila-Kila; for the Bouparese have a proverb like our own about  the king, 'The High God is dead; may the High God live forever!' But  before he gave up his Soul to his successor, and was eaten or buried,  whichever is the custom, he handed over his pet to the King of the Birds,  strictly charging all future bearers of that divine office to care for  the parrot as they would care for a son or a daughter. And so the natives  make much of the parrot to the present day, saying he is greater than  any, save a Korong or a god, for he is the Soul of a dead race, summing  it up in himself, and he knows the secret of the Death of Tu-Kila-Kila."    
"But you can't tell me what language he speaks?" Felix asked with a  despairing gesture. It was terrible to stand thus within measurable  distance of the secret which might, perhaps, save Muriel's life, and yet  be perpetually balked by wheel within wheel of more than Egyptian  mystery.    
"Who can say?" the Frenchman answered, shrugging his shoulders  helplessly. "It isn't Polynesian; that I know well, for I speak  Bouparese now like a native of Boupari; and it isn't the only other  language spoken at the present day in the South Seas--the Melanesian of  New Caledonia--for that I learned well from the Kanakas while I was  serving my time as a convict among them. All we can say for certain is  that it may, perhaps, be some very ancient tongue. For parrots, we know,  are immensely long-lived. Some of them, it is said, exceed their century.  Is it not so, eh, my friend Methuselah?"
