    Philip had lived so long in a country village that he had never   chanced to read any of those absorbing romances in which one boy, of   tender years, proves himself a match for a dozen Indians, more or   less, and, therefore, he was very much amazed at Henry Taylor's   avowal that he was going out West to kill Indians. 
  &quot;What do you want to kill Indians for?&quot; he asked, after an   astonished pause. 
  Now it was Henry's turn to be astonished. 
  &quot;Every boy wants to kill Indians,&quot; he answered, looking pityingly  at  our hero. 
  &quot;What for? What good will it do?&quot; asked Philip. 
  &quot;It shows he's brave,&quot; answered his new friend. &quot;Didn't you ever   read the story of 'Bully Bill'; or, The Hero of the Plains'?&quot; 
  &quot;I never heard of it,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;You must have lived in the woods, then,&quot; said Henry Taylor, rather   contemptuously. &quot;It's a tip-top story. Bully Bill was only fourteen,   and killed ever so many Indians&#8212;twenty or thirty, I guess&#8212;as well   as a lot of lions and bears. Oh, he must have had lots of fun!&quot; 
  &quot;Why didn't the Indians kill him?&quot; asked Philip, desirous of being   enlightened. &quot;They didn't stand still and let him kill them, did   they?&quot; 
  &quot;No; of course not. They fought awful hard.&quot; 
  &quot;How did one young boy manage to overcome so many Indians?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, you'll have to read the story to find out! Bully Bill was a   great hero, and everybody admired him.&quot; 
  &quot;So you wanted to imitate his example?&quot; asked Philip. 
  &quot;To be sure I did.&quot; 
  &quot;How did you happen to get out of money?&quot; 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said Henry, &quot;you see me and another boy got awful excited   after reading the story, and both concluded nothing could make us so   happy as to go out West together, and do as Bill did. Of course, it   was no use to ask the old man&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;The old man?&quot; queried Philip. 
  &quot;The gov'nor&#8212;father, of course! So we got hold of some money&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You got hold of some money?&quot; queried Philip. 
  &quot;That's what I said, didn't I?&quot; rejoined Henry irritably. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then what's the use of repeating it?&quot; 
  Philip intended to ask where or how Henry got hold of the money,  but  he saw pretty clearly that this would not be agreeable to his new   acquaintance. Though without much experience in the world, he   suspected that the money was not obtained honestly, and did not  press  the question. 
  &quot;Well, me and Tom started about a week ago. First of all, we bought   some revolvers, as, of course, we should need them to shoot Indians.   They cost more than we expected, and then we found it cost more to   travel than we thought.&quot; 
  &quot;How much money did you have?&quot; 
  &quot;After paying for our revolvers, Tom and me had about thirty   dollars,&quot; said Henry. 
  &quot;Only thirty dollars to go west with!&quot; exclaimed Philip, in  amazement. 
  &quot;Why, you see, the revolvers cost more than we expected. Then we   stopped at a hotel in Albany, where they charged us frightfully.  That  is where Tom left me.&quot; 
  &quot;Tom left you at Albany?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he got homesick!&quot; said Henry contemptuously. &quot;He thought we   hadn't money enough, and he said he didn't know as he cared so much   about killing Indians.&quot; 
  &quot;I agree with Tom,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I don't think I should care very   much about killing Indians myself, and I should decidedly object to   being killed by an Indian. I shouldn't like to be scalped. Would   you?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, I'd take care of that,&quot; said Henry. &quot;I wouldn't let them have   the chance.&quot; 
  &quot;It seems to me the best way would be to stay at home,&quot; said  Philip,  smiling. 
  &quot;If I stayed at home I'd have to go to school and study. I don't   care much about studying.&quot; 
  &quot;I like it,&quot; said Philip. &quot;So Tom left you, did he?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; but I wasn't going to give up so easy. He took half the money   that was left, though I thought he ought to have given it to me, as  I  needed it more. I wasn't going home just as I'd started.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you've spent all your money now?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Henry gloomily. &quot;Have you got much money?&quot; he  asked,  after a pause. 
  &quot;Yes, I have about a hundred dollars-say, ninety-five.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't mean it!&quot; ejaculated Henry, hie eyes sparkling. 
  &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; 
  &quot;How did you get it?&quot; 
  &quot;I earned most of it by playing on the violin.&quot; 
  &quot;I say,&quot; exclaimed Henry, in excitement, &quot;suppose you and me go  into  partnership together, and go out West&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;To kill Indians?&quot; asked Philip, smiling. 
  &quot;Yes! With all that money we'll get along. Besides, if we get  short,  you can earn some more.&quot; 
  &quot;But what advantage am I to get out of it? I am to furnish all the   capital and pay all expenses, as far as I can understand. Generally,   both partners put in something.&quot; 
  &quot;I put in my revolver,&quot; said Henry. 
  &quot;One revolver won't do for us both.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, well, you can buy one. Come, what do you say?&quot; asked Henry   eagerly. 
  &quot;Let me ask you a few questions first. Where does your father  live?&quot; 
  &quot;In New York.&quot; 
  &quot;What is his business?&quot; 
  &quot;He is a broker in Wall Street.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose he is rich?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, he's got plenty of money, I expect! We live in a nice house on   Madison Avenue. That's one of the best streets, I suppose you know!&quot; 
  &quot;I never was in New York. Is your mother living?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered Henry. &quot;She died three years ago.&quot; 
  If his mother had been living, probably the boy would never have   made such an escapade, but his father, being engrossed by business   cares, was able to give very little attention to his son, and this   accounts in part for the folly of which he had been guilty. 
  &quot;Have you got any brothers or sisters?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;I have one sister, about three years younger than I. Her name is   Jennie.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish I were as well off as you,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;How do you mean?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean I wish I had a father and sister.&quot; 
  &quot;Haven't you?&quot; 
  &quot;My father is dead,&quot; said Philip gravely, &quot;and I never had a   sister.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, well, I don't know as I'm so lucky,&quot; said Henry. &quot;Sisters are  a  bother. They want you to go round with them, and the old man is   always finding fault.&quot; 
  Philip's relations with his father had always been so affectionate   that he could not understand how Henry could talk in such a way of   his. 
  &quot;I don't know what makes you ask me such a lot of questions,&quot; said   Henry, showing impatience. &quot;Come, what do you say to my offer ?&quot; 
  &quot;About forming a partnership?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd rather not&#8212;in that way.&quot; 
  &quot;In what way?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean for the purpose of going out West to kill Indians.&quot; 
  &quot;You've no idea what fun it would be,&quot; said Henry, disappointed. 
  &quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; said Philip, smiling. 
  &quot;Then I suppose I shall have to give it up,&quot; said Henry. 
  &quot;Now I have a proposal to make to you,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;What is it?&quot; 
  &quot;If you agree to go home, I'll pay your expenses and go along with   you. I've never been to New York, and I'd like to have some one with   me that could show me round the city.&quot; 
  &quot;I can do that,&quot; said Henry. &quot;I know the way all about.&quot; 
  &quot;Then will you agree?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then come along, and we'll stop at the first convenient place and   get some supper.&quot;
