  It still lacked nearly an hour of the appointed time when Howland  came to the secluded spot in the trail where he was to meet Meleese.  Concealed in the deep shadows of the bushes he seated himself on the  end of a fallen spruce and loaded his pipe, taking care to light it  with the flare of the match hidden in the hollow of his hands. For the  first time since his terrible experience in the coyote he found himself  free to think, and more than ever he began to see the necessity of  coolness and of judgment in what he was about to do. Gradually, too, he  fought himself back into his old faith in Meleese. His blood was  tingling at fever heat in his desire for vengeance, for the punishment  of the human fiends who had attempted to blow him to atoms, and yet at  the same time there was no bitterness in him toward the girl. He was  sure that she was an unwilling factor in the plot, and that she was  doing all in her power to save him. At the same time he began to  realize that he should no longer be influenced by her pleading. He had  promised&#8212;in return for her confidence this night&#8212;to leave unpunished  those whom she wished to shield. He would take back that promise.  Before she revealed anything to him he would warn her that he was  determined to discover those who had twice sought to kill him.
  It was nearly midnight when he looked at his watch again. Was it  possible that Meleese would not come? He could not bring himself to  believe that she knew of his imprisonment in the coyote&#8212;of this second  attempt on his life. And yet&#8212;if she did&#8212;
  He rose from the log and began pacing quickly back and forth in the  gloom, his thoughts racing through his brain with increasing  apprehension. Those who had imprisoned him had learned of his escape an  hour ago. Many things might have happened in that time. Perhaps they  were fleeing from the camp. Frightened by their failure, and fearing  the punishment which would be theirs if discovered, it was not  improbable that even now they were many miles from the Wekusko,  hurrying deeper into the unknown wilderness to the north. And Meleese  would be with them!
  Suddenly he heard a step, a light, running step, and with a  recognizing cry he sprang out into the starlight to meet the slim,  panting, white-faced figure that ran to him from between the thick  walls of forest trees.
  &#8220;Meleese?&#8221; he exclaimed softly.
  He held out his arms and the girl ran straight into them, thrusting  her hands against his breast, throwing back her head so that she looked  up into his face with great, staring, horror-filled eyes.
  &#8220;Now&#8212;now&#8212;&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;<I>now</I> will you go?&#8221;
  Her hands left his breast and crept to his shoulders; slowly they  slipped over them, and as Howland pressed her closer, his lips silent,  she gave an agonized cry and dropped her head against his shoulder, her  whole body torn in a convulsion of grief and terror that startled him.
  &#8220;You will go?&#8221; she sobbed again and again. &#8220;You will go&#8212;you will  go&#8212;&#8221;
  He ran his fingers through her soft hair, crushing his face close to  hers.
  &#8220;No, I am not going, dear,&#8221; he replied in a low, firm voice. &#8220;Not  after what happened to-night.&#8221;
  She drew away from him as quickly as if he had struck her, freeing  herself even from the touch of his hands.
  &#8220;I heard&#8212;what happened&#8212;an hour ago,&#8221; she said, her voice choking  her. &#8220;I overheard&#8212;them&#8212;talking.&#8221; She struggled hard to control  herself. &#8220;You must leave the camp&#8212;to-night.&#8221;
  In the gloom she saw Howland's teeth gleaming. There was no fear in  his smile; he laughed gently down into her eyes as he took her face  between his hands again.
  &#8220;I want to take back the promise that I gave you last night,  Meleese. I want to give you a chance to warn any whom you may wish to  warn. I shall not return into the South. From this hour begins the hunt  for the cowardly devils who have tried to murder me. Before dawn every  man on the Wekusko will be in the search, and if we find them there  shall be no mercy. Will you help me, or&#8212;&#8221;
  She struck his hands from her face, springing back before he had  finished. He saw a sudden change of expression; her lips grew tense and  firm; from the death whiteness of her face there faded slowly away the  look of soft pleading, the quivering lines of fear. There was a  strangeness in her voice when she spoke&#8212;something of the hard  determination which Howland had put in his own, and yet the tone of it  lacked his gentleness and love.
  &#8220;Will you please tell me the time?&#8221; The question was almost  startling. Howland held the dial of his watch to the light of the  stars.
  &#8220;It is a quarter past midnight.&#8221;
  The faintest shadow of a smile passed over the girl's lips.
  &#8220;Are you certain that your watch is not fast?&#8221; she asked.
  In speechless bewilderment Howland stared at her.
  &#8220;Because it will mean a great deal to you and to me if it is not a  quarter past midnight,&#8221; continued Meleese, a growing glow in her eyes.  Suddenly she approached him and put both of her warm hands to his face,  holding down his arms with her own. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Is there  nothing&#8212;nothing that will make you change your purpose, that will take  you back into the South&#8212;to-night?&#8221;
  The nearness of the sweet face, the gentle touch of the girl's  hands, the soft breath of her lips, sent a maddening impulse through  Howland to surrender everything to her. For an instant he wavered.
  &#8220;There might be one&#8212;just<I> one</I> thing that would take me away  to-night,&#8221; he replied, his voice trembling with the great love that  thrilled him. &#8220;For you, Meleese, I would give up everything&#8212;ambition,  fortune, the building of this road. If I go to-night will you go with  me? Will you promise to be my wife when we reach Le Pas?&#8221;
  A look of ineffable tenderness came into the beautiful eyes so near  to his own.
  &#8220;That is impossible. You will not love me when you know what I  am&#8212;what I have done&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped her.
  &#8220;Have you done wrong&#8212;a great wrong?&#8221;
  For a moment her eyes faltered; then, hesitatingly, there fell from  her lips, &#8220;I&#8212;don't&#8212;know. I believe I have. But it's not that&#8212;it's  not<I> that!</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;Do you mean that&#8212;that I have no right to tell you I love you?&#8221; he  asked. &#8220;Do you mean that it is wrong for you to listen to me?  I&#8212;I&#8212;took it for granted that you were a&#8212;girl&#8212;that&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;No, no, it is not that,&#8221; she cried quickly, catching his meaning.  &#8220;It is not wrong for you to love me.&#8221; Suddenly she asked again, &#8220;Will  you please tell me what time it is&#8212;now?&#8221;
  He looked again.
  &#8220;Twenty-five minutes after midnight.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let us go farther up the trail,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I am afraid here.&#8221;
  She led the way, passing swiftly beyond the path that branched out  to his cabin. Two hundred yards beyond this a tree had fallen on the  edge of the trail, and seating herself on it Meleese motioned for him  to sit down beside her. Howland's back was to the thick bushes behind  them. He looked at the girl, but she had turned away her face. Suddenly  she sprang from the log and stood in front of him.
  &#8220;Now!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Now!&#8221; and at that signal Howland's arms were  seized from behind, and in another instant he was struggling feebly in  the grip of powerful arms which had fastened themselves about him like  wire cable, and the cry that rose to his lips was throttled by a hand  over his mouth. For an instant he caught a glimpse of the girl's white  face as she stood in the trail; then strong hands pulled him back,  while others bound his wrists and still others held his legs.  Everything had passed in a few seconds. Helplessly bound and gagged he  lay on his back in the snow, listening to the low voices that came  faintly to him from beyond the bushes. He could understand nothing that  they said&#8212;and yet he was sure that he recognized among them the voice  of Meleese.
  The voices became fainter; he heard retreating footsteps, and at  last they died away entirely. Through a rift in the trees straight  above him the white, cold stars of the night gleamed down on him, and  Howland stared up at them fixedly until they seemed to be hopping and  dancing about in the skies. He wanted to swear&#8212;yell&#8212;fight. In these  moments that he lay on his back in the freezing snow a million demons  were born in his blood. The girl had betrayed him again! This time he  could find no excuse&#8212;no pardon for her. She had accepted his love&#8212;had  allowed him to kiss her, to hold her in his arms&#8212;while beneath that  hypocrisy she had plotted his downfall a second time. Deliberately she  had given the signal for attack, and now&#8212;
  He heard again the quick, running step that he had recognized on the  trail. The bushes behind him parted, and in the white starlight Meleese  fell on her knees at his side, her glorious face bending over him in a  grief that he had never seen in it before, her eyes shining on him with  a great love. Without speaking she lifted his head in the hollow of her  arm and crushed her own down against it, kissing him, and softly  sobbing his name.
  &#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he heard her breathe. &#8220;Good-by&#8212;good-by&#8212;&#8221;
  He struggled to cry out as she lowered his head back on the snow, to  free his hands, to hold her with him&#8212;but he saw her face only once  more, bending over him; felt the warm pressure of her lips to his  forehead, and then again he could hear her footsteps hurrying away  through the forest.
