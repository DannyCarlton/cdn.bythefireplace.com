  The three walked toward the Battery, and, while Tayoga attracted  more attention in New York than in Quebec, it was not undue. The city  was used to Indians, especially the Iroquois, and although comments  were made upon Tayoga's height and noble appearance there was nothing  annoying.
  Meanwhile the two youths were using their excellent eyes to the  full. Although the vivid imagination of Robert had foreseen a great  future for New York he did not dream how vast it would be. Yet all  things are relative, and the city even then looked large to him and  full of life, both size and activity having increased visibly since his  last visit. Some of the streets were paved, or at least in part, and  the houses, usually of red brick, often several stories in height, were  comfortable and strong. Many of them had lawns and gardens as at  Albany, and the best were planted with rows of trees which would afford  a fine shade in warm weather. Above the mercantile houses and dwellings  rose the lofty spire of St. George's Chapel in Nassau Street, which had  been completed less than three years before, and which secured Robert's  admiration for its height and impressiveness.
  The aspect of the whole town was a mixture of English and Dutch, but  they saw many sailors who were of neither race. Some were brown men  with rings in their ears, and they spoke languages that Robert did not  understand. But he knew that they came from far southern seas and that  they sailed among the tropic isles, looming large then in the world's  fancy, bringing with them a whiff of romance and mystery.
  The sidewalks in many places were covered with boxes and bales  brought from all parts of the earth, and stalwart men were at work  among them. The pulsing life and the air of prosperity pleased Robert.  His nature responded to the town, as it had responded to the woods, and  his imagination, leaping ahead, saw a city many times greater than the  one before his eyes, though it still stopped far short of the gigantic  reality that was to come to pass.
  &#8220;It's not far now to Master Hardy's,&#8221; said Willet cheerfully. &#8220;It's  many a day since I've seen trusty old Ben, and right glad I'll be to  feel the clasp of his hand again.&#8221;
  On his way Willet bought from a small boy in the street a copy each  of the<I> Weekly Post-Boy</I> and of the<I> Weekly Gazette</I> and<I>  Mercury</I>, folding them carefully and putting them in an inside  pocket of his coat.
  &#8220;I am one to value the news sheets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don't tell  everything, but they tell something and 'tis better to know something  than nothing. Just a bit farther, my lads, and we'll be at the steps of  honest Master Hardy. There, you can see where fortunes are made and  lost, though we're a bit too late to see the dealers!&#8221;
  He pointed to the Royal Exchange, a building used by the merchants  at the foot of Broad Street, a structure very unique in its plan. It  consisted of an upper story resting upon arches, the lower part,  therefore, being entirely open. Beneath these arches the merchants met  and transacted business, and also in a room on the upper floor, where  there were, too, a coffee house and a great room used for banquets, and  the meetings of societies, the Royal Exchange being in truth the  beginning of many exchanges that now mark the financial center of the  New World.
  &#8220;Perhaps we'll see the merchants there tomorrow,&#8221; said Willet.  &#8220;You'll note the difference between New York and Quebec. The French  capital was all military. You saw soldiers everywhere, but this is a  town of merchants. Now which, think you, will prevail, the soldiers or  the merchants?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think that in the end the merchants will win,&#8221; replied Robert.
  &#8220;And so do I. Now we have come to the home of Master Hardy. See you  the big brick house with high stone steps? Well, that is his, and I  repeat that he is a good friend of mine, a good friend of old and of  today. I heard that in Albany, which tells me we will find him here in  his own place.&#8221;
  But the big brick house looked to Robert and Tayoga like a fortress,  with its massive door and iron-barred windows, although friendly smoke  rose from a high chimney and made a warm line against the frosty blue  air.
  Willet walked briskly up the high stone steps and thundered on the  door with a heavy brass knocker. The summons was quickly answered and  the door swung back, revealing a tall, thin, elderly man, neatly  dressed in the fashion of the time. He had the manner of one who  served, although he did not seem to be a servant. Robert judged at once  that he was an upper clerk who lived in the house, after the custom of  the day.
  &#8220;Is Master Benjamin within, Jonathan?&#8221; asked Willet.
  The tall man blinked and then stared at the hunter in astonishment.
  &#8220;Is it in very truth you, Master Willet?&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;None other. Come, Jonathan, you know my voice and my face and my  figure very well. You could not fail to recognize me anywhere. So cease  your doubting. My young friends here are Robert Lennox, of whom you  know, and Tayoga, a coming chief of the Clan of the Bear, of the nation  Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, known to you as the  Six Nations. He's impatient of disposition and unless you answer my  question speedily I'll have him tomahawk you. Come now, is Master  Benjamin within?&#8221;
  &#8220;He is, Mr. Willet. I had no intent to delay my answer, but you must  allow something to surprise.&#8221;
  &#8220;I grant you pardon,&#8221; said the hunter whimsically. &#8220;Robert and  Tayoga, this is Master Jonathan Pillsbury, chief clerk and man of  affairs for Master Benjamin Hardy. They are two old bachelors who live  in the same house, and who get along well together, because they're so  unlike. As for Master Jonathan, his heart is not as sour as his face,  and you could come to a worse place than the shop of Benjamin and  Jonathan. Master Jonathan, you will take particular notice of Mr.  Lennox. He is well grown and he appears intelligent, does he not?&#8221;
  The old clerk blinked again, and then his appraising eyes swept over  Robert.
  &#8220;'Twould be hard to find a nobler youth,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I thought you would say so, and now lead us, without further delay,  to Master Hardy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is it who demands to be led to me?&#8221; thundered a voice from the  rear of the house. &#8220;I seem to know that voice! Ah, it's Willet! Good  old Willet! Honest Dave, who wields the sharpest sword in North  America!&#8221;
  A tall, heavy man lunged forward. &#8220;Lunged&#8221; was the word that  described it to Robert, and his impetuous motion was due to the sight  of Willet, whom he grasped by both hands, shaking them with a vigor  that would have caused pain in one less powerful than the hunter, and  as he shook them he uttered exclamations, many of them bordering upon  oaths and all of them pertaining to the sea.
  Robert's eyes had grown used to the half light of the hall, and he  took particular notice of Master Benjamin Hardy who was destined to  become an important figure in his life, although he did not then dream  of it. He saw a tall man of middle age, built very powerfully, his face  burnt almost the color of an Indian's by the winds and suns of many  seas. But his hair was thick and long and the eyes shining in the face,  made dark by the weather, were an intensely bright blue. Robert, upon  whom impressions were so swift and vivid, reckoned that here was one  capable of great and fierce actions, and also with a heart that  contained a large measure of kindness and generosity.
  &#8220;Dave,&#8221; said the tall man, who carried with him the atmosphere of  the sea, &#8220;I feared that you might be dead in those forests you love so  well, killed and perhaps scalped by the Hurons or some other savage  tribe. You've abundant hair, Dave, and you'd furnish an uncommonly fine  scalp.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I feared, Benjamin, that you'd been caught in some smuggling  cruise near the Spanish Main, and had been put out of the way by the  Dons. You love gain too much, Ben, old friend, and you court risks too  great for its sake.&#8221;
  Master Benjamin Hardy threw back his head and laughed deeply and  heartily. The laugh seemed to Robert to roll up spontaneously from his  throat. He felt anew that here was a man whom he liked.
  &#8220;Perchance 'tis the danger that draws me on,&#8221; said Master Hardy.  &#8220;You and I are much alike, Dave. In the woods, if all that I hear be  true, you dwell continually in the very shadow of danger, while I incur  it only at times. Moreover, I am come to the age of fifty years, the  head is still on my shoulders, the breath is still in my body, and  Master Jonathan, to whom figures are Biblical, says the balance on my  books is excellent.&#8221;
  &#8220;You talk o'er much, Ben, old friend, but since it's the way of  seafaring men and 'tis cheerful it does not vex my ears. You behold  with me, Tayoga, a youth of the best blood of the Onondaga nation, one  to whom you will be polite if you wish to please me, Benjamin, and  Master Robert Lennox, grown perhaps beyond your expectations.&#8221;
  Master Benjamin turned to Robert, and, as Master Jonathan had done,  measured him from head to foot with those intensely bright blue eyes of  his that missed nothing.
  &#8220;Grown greatly and grown well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but not beyond my  expectations. In truth, one could predict a noble bough upon such a  stem. But you and I, Dave, having many years, grow garrulous and forget  the impatience of youth. Come, lads, we'll go into the drawing-room  and, as supper was to have been served in half an hour, I'll have the  portions doubled.&#8221;
  Robert smiled.
  &#8220;In Albany and New York alike,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they welcome us to the  table.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which is the utmost test of hospitality,&#8221; said Master Benjamin.
  They went into a great drawing-room, the barred windows of which  looked out upon a busy street, warehouses and counting houses and  passing sailors. Robert was conscious all the while that the brilliant  blue eyes were examining him minutely. His old wonder about his  parentage, lost for a while in the press of war and exciting events,  returned. He felt intuitively that Master Hardy, like Willet, knew who  and what he was, and he also felt with the same force that neither  would reply to any question of his on the subject. So he kept his peace  and by and by his curiosity, as it always did, disappeared before  immediate affairs.
  The drawing-room was a noble apartment, with dark oaken beams, a  polished oaken floor, upon which eastern rugs were spread, and heavy  tables of foreign woods. A small model of a sloop rested upon one table  and a model of a schooner on another. Here and there were great curving  shells with interiors of pink and white, and upon the walls were  curious long, crooked knives of the Malay Islands. Everything savored  of the sea. Again Robert's imagination leaped up. The blazing hues of  distant tropic lands were in his eyes, and the odors of strange fruits  and flowers were in his nostrils.
  &#8220;Sit down, Dave,&#8221; said Master Benjamin, &#8220;and you, too, Robert and  Tayoga. I suppose you did not come to New Amsterdam&#8212;how the name  clings!&#8212;merely to see me.&#8221;
  &#8220;That was one purpose, Benjamin,&#8221; replied Willet, &#8220;but we had others  in mind too.&#8221;
  &#8220;To join the war, I surmise, and to get yourselves killed?&#8221;
  &#8220;The first part of your reckoning is true, Benjamin, but not the  second. We would go to the war, in which we have had some part already,  but not in order that we may be killed.&#8221;
  &#8220;You suffer from the common weakness. One entering war always thinks  that it's the other man and not he who will be killed. You're too old  for that, David.&#8221;
  Willet laughed.
  &#8220;No, Benjamin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I'm not too old for it, and I never will  be. It's the belief that carries us all through danger.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which way did you think of going in these warlike operations?&#8221;
  &#8220;We shall join the force that comes out from England.&#8221;
  &#8220;The one that will march against Fort Duquesne?&#8221;
  &#8220;Undoubtedly.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hear that it's to be commanded by a general named Braddock,  Edward Braddock. What do you know of him?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you do know, David, that regular army officers fare ill in the  woods as a rule. You've told me often that the savages are a tricky  lot, and, fighting in the forest in their own way, are hard to beat.&#8221;
  &#8220;You speak truth, Benjamin, and I'll not deny it, but there are many  of our men in the woods who know the ways of the Indians and of the  French foresters. They should be the eyes and ears of General  Braddock's army.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, maybe! maybe! David, but enough of war for the present. One  cannot talk about it forever. There are other things under the sun. You  will let these lads see New Amsterdam, will you not? Even Tayoga can  find something worth his notice in the greatest port of the New World.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is any play being given here?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;Aye, we're having plays almost nightly,&#8221; replied Master Hardy, &#8220;and  they're being presented by some very good actors, too. Lewis Hallam,  who came several years ago from Goodman's Fields Theater in England,  and his wife, known on the stage as Mrs. Douglas, are offering the best  English plays in New York. Hallam is said to be extremely fine in  Richard III, in which tragedy he first appeared here, and he gives it  tomorrow night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we're going,&#8221; said Robert eagerly. &#8220;I would not miss it for  anything.&#8221;
  &#8220;I had some thought of going myself, and if Dave hasn't changed, he  has a fine taste for the stage. I'll send for seats and we'll go  together.&#8221;
  Willet's eyes sparkled.
  &#8220;In truth I'll go, too, and right gladly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You and I,  Benjamin, have seen the plays of Master Shakespeare together in London,  and 'twill please me mightily to see one of them again with you in New  York. Jonathan, here, will be of our company, too, will he not?&#8221;
  Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe.
  &#8220;'Tis a frivolous way of passing the time,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it would  be well for one of serious mind to be present in order that he might  impose a proper dignity upon those who lack it.&#8221;
  Benjamin Hardy burst into a roar of laughter. Robert had never known  any one else to laugh so deeply and with such obvious spontaneity and  enjoyment. His lips curled up at each end, his eyes rolled back and  then fairly danced with mirth, and his cheeks shook. It was contagious.  Not only did Master Benjamin laugh, but the others had to laugh, not  excluding Master Jonathan, who emitted a dry cackle as became one of  his habit and appearance.
  &#8220;Do you know, Dave, old friend,&#8221; said Hardy, &#8220;that our good Jonathan  is really the most wicked of us all? I go upon the sea on these  cruises, which you call smuggling, and what not, and of which he speaks  censoriously, but if they do not show a large enough profit on his  books he rates me most severely, and charges me with a lack of  enterprise. And now he would fain go to the play to see that we observe  the proper decorum there. My lads, you couldn't keep the sour-visaged  old hypocrite from it.&#8221;
  Master Jonathan permitted himself a vinegary smile, but made no  other reply, and, a Dutch serving girl announcing that supper was  ready, Master Hardy led them into the dining-room, where a generous  repast was spread. But the room itself continued and accentuated the  likeness of a ship. The windows were great portholes, and two large  swinging lamps furnished the light. Pictures of naval worthies and of  sea actions lined the walls. Two or three of the battle scenes were  quite spirited, and Robert regarded them with interest.
  &#8220;Have you fought in any of those encounters, Mr. Hardy?&#8221; he asked.
  Willet laid a reproving hand upon his shoulder.
  &#8220;'Twas a natural question of yours, Robert,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but 'tis the  fashion here and 'tis courtesy, too, never to ask Benjamin about his  past life. Then he has no embarrassing questions to answer.&#8221;
  Robert reddened and Hardy broke again into that deep, spontaneous  laughter which, in time, compelled all the others to laugh too and with  genuine enjoyment.
  &#8220;Don't believe all that David tells you, Robert, my brave macaroni,&#8221;  he said. &#8220;I may not answer your questions, but faith they'll never  prove embarrassing. Bear in mind, lad, that our trade being restricted  by the mother country and English subjects in this land not having the  same freedom as English subjects in England, we must resort to secrecy  and stratagem to obtain what our fellow subjects on the other side of  the ocean may obtain openly. And when you grow older, Master Robert,  you will find that it's ever so in the world. Those to whom force bars  the way will resort to wiles and stratagems to achieve their ends. The  fox has the cunning that the bear lacks, because he hasn't the bear's  strength. Lads, you two will sit together on this side of the table,  Jonathan, you take the side next to the portholes, and David, you and I  will preside at the ends. Benjamin, David and Jonathan, it has quite a  Biblical sound, and at least the friendship among the three of us,  despite the sourness of Master Pillsbury, with which I bear as best I  can, is equal to that of David and Jonathan. Now, lads, fall on and see  which of you can keep pace with me, for I am a mighty trencherman.&#8221;
  &#8220;Meanwhile tell us what is passing here,&#8221; said Willet.
  In the course of the supper Hardy talked freely of events in New  York, where a great division of councils still prevailed. Shirley, the  warlike and energetic governor of Massachusetts, had urged De Lancy,  the governor of New York, to join in an expedition against the French  in Canada, but there had been no agreement. Later, a number of the  royal governors expected to meet at Williamsburg in Virginia with  Dinwiddie, the governor of that province.
  &#8220;At present there are plans for four enterprises, every one of an  aspiring nature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One expedition is to reduce Nova Scotia  entirely, another, under Governor Shirley of Massachusetts, is to  attack the French at Fort Niagara, Sir William Johnson with militia and  Mohawks is to head a third against Crown Point. The fourth, which I  take to be the most important, is to be led by General Braddock against  Fort Duquesne, its object being the recovery of the Ohio country. I  cannot vouch for it, but such plans, I hear, will be presented at the  conference of the governors at Williamsburg.&#8221;
  &#8220;As we mean to go to Williamsburg ourselves,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;we'll  see what fortune General Braddock may have. But now, for the sake of  the good lads, we'll speak of lighter subjects. Where is the play of  Richard III to be given, Benjamin?&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Hallam has obtained a great room in a house that is the  property of Rip Van Dam in Nassau Street. He has fitted it up in the  fashion of a stage, and his plays are always attended by a great  concourse of ladies and gentlemen. Boston and Philadelphia say New York  is light and frivolous, but I suspect that something of jealousy lies  at the core of the charge. We of New Amsterdam&#8212;again the name leaps to  my lips&#8212;have a certain freedom in our outlook upon life, a freedom  which I think produces strength and not weakness. Manners are not  morals, but I grow heavy and it does not become a seafaring man to be  didactic. What is it, Piet?&#8221;
  The door of the dining-room opened, admitting a serving man who  produced a letter.
  &#8220;It comes by the Boston post,&#8221; he said, handing it to Master Hardy.
  &#8220;Then it must have an importance which will not admit delay in the  reading,&#8221; said Master Hardy. &#8220;Your pardon, friends, while I peruse it.&#8221;
  He read it carefully, read it again with the same care, and then his  resonant laughter boomed forth with such volume and in such continuity  that he was compelled to take a huge red handkerchief and wipe the  tears from his eyes.
  &#8220;What is it, Benjamin, that amuses you so vastly?&#8221; asked Willet.
  &#8220;A brave epistle from one of my captains, James Dunbar, a valiant  man and a great mariner. In command of the schooner,<I> Good Hope</I>,  he was sailing from the Barbados with a cargo of rum and sugar for  Boston, which furnishes a most excellent market for both, when he was  overhauled by the French privateer,<I> Rocroi</I>.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you find to laugh at in the loss of a good ship and a fine  cargo?&#8221;
  &#8220;Did I say they were lost? Nay, David, I said nothing of the kind.  You don't know Dunbar, and you don't know the<I> Good Hope</I>, which  carries a brass twelve-pounder and fifteen men as valiant as Dunbar  himself. He returned the attack of the<I> Rocroi</I> with such amazing  skill and fierceness that he was able to board her and take her, with  only three of his men wounded and they not badly. Moreover, they found  on board the privateer a large store of gold, which becomes our prize  of war. And Dunbar and his men shall have a fair share of it, too. How  surprised the Frenchies must have been when Dunbar and his sailors  swarmed aboard.&#8221;
  &#8220;'Tis almost our only victory,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;and I'm right glad,  Benjamin, it has fallen to the lot of one of your ships to win it.&#8221;
  The long supper which was in truth a dinner was finished at last.  Hardy made good his boast, proving that he was a mighty trencherman.  Pillsbury pressed him closest, and the others, although they did well,  lingered at some distance in the rear. Afterward they walked in the  town, observing its varied life, and at a late hour returned to Hardy's  house which he called a mansion.
  Robert and Tayoga were assigned to a room on the second floor, and  young Lennox again noted the numerous evidences of opulence. The  furniture was mostly of carved mahogany, and every room contained  articles of value from distant lands.
  &#8220;Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;what do you think of it all?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think that the man Hardy is shrewd, Dagaeoga, shrewd like one of  our sachems, and that he has an interest in you, greater than he would  let you see. Do you remember him, Lennox?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I can't recall him, Tayoga. I've heard Dave speak of him many  times, but whenever we were in New York before he was away, and we did  not even come to his house. But he and Dave are friends of many years.  I think that long ago they must have been much together.&#8221;
  &#8220;Truly there is some mystery here, but it can wait. In its proper  time the unknown becomes the known.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it does, Tayoga, and I shall not vex my mind about the matter.  Just now, what I wish most of all is sleep.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish it too, Lennox.&#8221;
  But Robert did not sleep well, his nerves being attuned more highly  than he had realized. Some of the talk that had passed between Willet  and Hardy related obviously to himself, and in the quiet of the room it  came back to him. He had not slept more than an hour when he awoke,  and, being unable to go to sleep again, sat up in bed. Tayoga was deep  in slumber, and Robert finally left the bed and went to the window, the  shutter of which was not closed. It was a curious, round window, like a  huge porthole, but the glass was clear and he had a good view of the  street. He saw one or two sailors swaying rather more than the  customary motion of a ship, pass by, and then a watchman carrying a  club in one hand and a lantern in the other, and blowing his frosty  breath upon his thick brown beard, indicating that the night although  bright was very cold.
  He looked through the glass at least a half hour, and then turned  back to the bed, but found himself less inclined than ever to sleep.  Throwing his coat over his shoulders, he opened the unlocked door and  went into the hall, intending to walk back and forth a little,  believing that the easy exercise would induce desire for sleep.
  He was surprised to find a thread of light in the dusk of the hall,  at a time when he was quite sure everybody in the house except himself  was buried in slumber, and when he traced it he found it came from  another room farther down. It was, upon the instant, his belief that  robbers had entered. In a port like New York, where all nations come,  there must be reckless and desperate men who would hesitate at no risk  or crime.
  He moved cautiously along the hall, until he reached the door from  which the light shone. It was open about six inches, not allowing a  look into the room except at the imminent risk of discovery, but by  placing his ear at the sill he would be able to hear the footsteps of  men if they were moving within. The sound of voices instead came to  him, and as he listened he was able to note that it was two men talking  in low tones. Undoubtedly they were robbers, who were common in all  great towns in those days, and this must be a chamber in which Master  Hardy kept many valuables. Doubtless they were assured that everybody  was deep in slumber, or they would be more cautious.
  Driven by an intense curiosity, Robert edged his head a little  farther forward, and was able to look into the room, where, to his  intense amazement, he saw no robbers at all, but Willet and Master  Hardy seated at a small table opposite each other, with a candle,  account books and papers between. Hardy had been reading a paper, and  stopping at intervals to talk about it with the hunter.
  &#8220;As you see, David,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the list of the ships is three larger  than it was five years ago. One was lost to the Barbary corsairs,  another was wrecked on the coast of the Brazils, but we have five new  ones.&#8221;
  &#8220;You have done well, Benjamin, but I knew you would,&#8221; said the  hunter.
  &#8220;With the help of Jonathan. Don't forget him, David. In name he is  my head clerk, and he pretends to serve me, but at times I think he is  my master. A shrewd Massachusetts man, David, uncommonly shrewd, and  loyal too.&#8221;
  &#8220;And the lands, Benjamin?&#8221;
  &#8220;They're in abeyance, and are likely to be for some years, their  title depending upon the course of events which are now in train.&#8221;
  &#8220;And they're uncertain, Benjamin, as uncertain as the winds. But  give me your honest opinion of the lad, Benjamin. Have I done well with  him?&#8221;
  &#8220;None could have done better. He's an eagle, David. I marked him  well. Spirit, imagination, force; youth and honesty looking out of his  eyes. But have you no fears, David, that you will get him killed in the  wars?&#8221;
  &#8220;I could not keep him from going to them if I would, Benjamin. There  my power stops. You old sailors have superstitions or beliefs, and I, a  landsman, have a conviction, too. The invisible prophets tell me that  he will not be killed.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't laugh at such things, David. The greatness and loneliness  of the sea does breed superstition in mariners. I know there is no such  thing as the supernatural, and yet I am swayed at times by the  unknown.&#8221;
  &#8220;At least I will watch over him as best I can, and he has uncommon  skill in taking care of himself.&#8221;
  Robert's will triumphed over a curiosity that was intense and  burning, and he turned away. He knew they were speaking of him, and he  seemed to be connected with great affairs. It was enough to stir the  most apathetic youth, and he was just the opposite. It required the  utmost exertion of a very strong mind to pull himself from the door and  then to drag his unwilling feet along the hall. Matter was in complete  rebellion and mind was compelled to win its triumph, unaided, but win  it did and kept the victory.
  He reached his own room and softly closed the door behind him.  Tayoga was still sleeping soundly. Robert went again to the window. His  eyes were turned toward the street, but he did not see anything there,  because he was looking inward. The talk of Willet and Hardy came back  to him. He could say it over, every word, and none could deny that it  was charged with significance. But he knew intuitively that neither of  them would answer a single one of his questions, and he must wait for  time and circumstance to disclose the truth. Nor could he bear to tell  them that he had been listening at the door, despite the fact that it  had been brought about by accident, and that he had come away, when he  might have heard more.
  Having resigned himself to necessity, he went back to bed and now,  youth triumphing over excitement, he soon slept. The next morning,  directly after breakfast, the three elders and the two lads went to the  Royal Exchange, where there was soon a great concourse of merchants,  clerks and seafaring men. Master Hardy was received with great respect,  and many congratulations were given to him, when he told the story of  the<I> Good Hope</I> and Captain Dunbar. In one of the rooms above the  pillars he met another captain of his who had arrived the day before at  New York itself.
  This captain, a New England man, Eliphalet Simmons, had brought his  schooner from the Mediterranean, and he told in a manner as brief and  dry as his own log how he had outsailed one Barbary corsair by day, and  by changing his course had tricked another in the night. But the voyage  had been most profitable, and Master Jonathan duly entered the amount  of gain in an account book, with a reward of ten pounds to Captain  Simmons, five pounds to the first mate, three pounds to the second  mate, and one pound to every member of the crew for their bravery and  seamanship.
  Captain Simmons' thanks were as brief and dry as his report, but  Robert saw his eyes glisten, and knew that he was not lacking in  gratitude. After the business was settled and the rewards adjusted they  adjourned to a coffee house near Hanover Square where very good Madeira  was brought and served to the men, Robert and Tayoga declining. Then  Benjamin, David and Jonathan drank to the health of Eliphalet, while  the two lads, the white and the red, devoted their attention to the  others in the coffee house, of whom there were at least a dozen.
  One who sat at a table very near was already examining Tayoga with  the greatest curiosity. He wore the uniform of an English second  lieutenant, very trim, and very red, he had an exceeding ruddiness of  countenance, he was tall and well built, and he was only a year or two  older than Robert. His curiosity obviously had been aroused by the  appearance of Tayoga in the full costume of an Iroquois. It was equally  evident to Robert that he was an Englishman, a member of the royal  forces then in New York. Americans still called themselves Englishmen  and Robert instantly had a feeling of kinship for the young officer who  had a frank and good face.
  The English youth's hat was lying upon the table beside him, and a  gust of wind blowing it upon the floor, rolled it toward Robert, who  picked it up and tendered it to its owner.
  &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;'Twas careless of me.&#8221;
  &#8220;By no means,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;The wind blows when it pleases, and you  were taken by surprise.&#8221;
  The Englishman smiled, showing very white and even teeth.
  &#8220;I haven't been very long in New York,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I find it a  polite and vastly interesting town. My name is Grosvenor, Alfred  Grosvenor, and I'm a second lieutenant in the regiment of Colonel  Brandon, that arrived but recently from England.&#8221;
  Master Hardy looked up and passed an investigating eye over the  young Englishman.
  &#8220;You're related to one of the ducal families of England,&#8221; he said,  &#8220;but your own immediate branch of it has no overplus of wealth. Still,  your blood is reckoned highly noble in England, and you have an  excellent standing in your regiment, both as an officer and a man.&#8221;
  Young Grosvenor's ruddy face became ruddier.
  &#8220;How do you happen to know so much about me?&#8221; he asked. But there  was no offense in his tone.
  Hardy smiled, and Pillsbury, pursing his thin lips, measured  Grosvenor with his eyes.
  &#8220;I make it my business,&#8221; replied Hardy, &#8220;to discover who the people  are who come to New York. I'm a seafaring man and a merchant and I find  profit in it. It's true, in especial, since the war has begun, and New  York begins to fill with the military. Many of these sprightly young  officers will be wishing to borrow money from me before long, and it  will be well for me to know their prospects of repayment.&#8221;
  The twinkle in his eye belied the irony of his words, and the  lieutenant laughed.
  &#8220;And since you're alone,&#8221; continued the merchant, &#8220;we ask you to  join us, and will be happy if you accept. This is Mr. Robert Lennox, of  very good blood too, and this is Tayoga, of the Clan of the Bear, of  the nation Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, who,  among his own people has a rank corresponding to a prince of the blood  among yours, and who, if you value such things, is entitled therefore  to precedence over all of us, including yourself. Mr. David Willet, Mr.  Jonathan Pillsbury and Mr. Benjamin Hardy, who is myself, complete the  catalogue.&#8221;
  He spoke in a tone half whimsical, half earnest, but the young  Englishman, who evidently had a friendly and inquiring mind, received  it in the best spirit and gladly joined them. He was soon deep in the  conversation, but his greatest interest was for Tayoga, from whom he  could seldom take his eyes. It was evident to Robert that he had  expected to find only a savage in an Indian, and the delicate manners  and perfect English of the Onondaga filled him with surprise.
  &#8220;I would fain confess,&#8221; he said at length, &#8220;that America is not what  I expected to find. I did not know that it contained princes who could  put some of our own to shame.&#8221;
  He bowed to Tayoga, who smiled and replied:
  &#8220;What small merit I may possess is due to the training of my  people.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you expect early service, Lieutenant Grosvenor?&#8221; Mr. Hardy  asked.
  &#8220;Not immediate&#8212;I think I may say so much,&#8221; replied the Englishman,  &#8220;but I understand that our regiment will be with the first force that  takes the field, that of General Braddock. 'Tis well known that we  intend to march against Fort Duquesne, an expedition that should be  easy. A powerful army like General Braddock's can brush aside any  number of forest rovers.&#8221;
  Robert and Willet exchanged glances, but the face of Tayoga remained  a mask.
  &#8220;It's not well to take the French and Indians too lightly,&#8221; said Mr.  Hardy with gravity.
  &#8220;But wandering bands can't face cannon and the bayonet.&#8221;
  &#8220;They don't have to face 'em. They lie hid on your flank and cut you  down, while your fire and steel waste themselves on the uncomplaining  forest.&#8221;
  They were words which were destined to come back to Robert some day  with extraordinary force, but for the present they were a mere  generalization that did not stay long in his mind.
  &#8220;Our leaders will take all the needful precautions,&#8221; said young  Grosvenor with confidence.
  Mr. Hardy did not insist, but spoke of the play they expected to  witness that evening, suggesting to Lieutenant Grosvenor if he had  leave, that he go with them, an invitation that was accepted promptly  and with warmth. The liking between him and Robert, while of sudden  birth, was destined to be strong and permanent. There was much  similarity of temperament. Grosvenor also was imaginative and curious.  His mind invariably projected itself into the future, and he was eager  to know. He had come to America, inquiring, without prejudices, wishing  to find the good rather than the bad, and he esteemed it a great stroke  of fortune that he should make so early the acquaintance of two such  remarkable youths as Robert and Tayoga. The three men with them were  scarcely less interesting, and he knew that in their company at the  play they would talk to him of strange new things. He would be  exploring a world hidden from him hitherto, and nothing could have  appealed to him more.
  &#8220;You landed a week ago,&#8221; said Hardy.
  &#8220;Truly, sir,&#8221; laughed Grosvenor, &#8220;you seem to know not only who I  am, but what I do.&#8221;
  &#8220;And then, as you've had a certain amount of military duty, although  'tis not excessive, you've had little chance to see this most important  town of ours. Can you not join this company of mine at my house for  supper, and then we'll all go together to the play? I'll obtain your  seat for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;With great pleasure, sir,&#8221; replied Grosvenor. &#8220;'Twill be easy for  me to secure the needed leave, and I'll be at your house with  promptness.&#8221;
  He departed presently for his quarters, and the three men also went  away together on an errand of business, leaving Robert and Tayoga to go  whithersoever they pleased and it pleased them to wander along the  shores of the port. Young Lennox was impressed more than ever by the  great quantity of shipping, and the extreme activity of the town. The  war with France, so far from interfering with this activity, had but  increased it.
  Privateering was a great pursuit of the day, all nations deeming it  legal and worthy in war, and bold and enterprising merchants like Mr.  Hardy never failed to take advantage of it. The weekly news sheets that  Willet had bought contained lists of vessels captured already, and  Robert's hasty glances showed him that at least sixty or seventy had  been taken by the privateers out of New York. Most of the prizes had  been in the West India trade, although some had been captured far away  near the coast of Africa, and nearly all had been loaded richly.
  They saw several of the privateers in port, armed powerfully, and as  they were usually built for speed, Robert admired their graceful lines.  He felt anew the difference between military Quebec and commercial New  York. Quebec was prepared to send forth forces for destruction, but,  here, life-giving commerce flowed in and flowed out again through  arteries continually increasing in number and power. Once again came to  him the thought that the merchant more than the soldier was the builder  of a great nation. The impression made upon him was all the more vivid  because New York, even in the middle of the eighteenth century, when it  was in its infancy, surprised even travelers from Europe with its  manifold activities and intense energy.
  After a day, long but of extraordinary interest, they returned to  the house of Mr. Hardy, where Grosvenor joined them in half an hour,  and then, after another abundant supper, they all went to the play.
