  Following this day Peter was observant of a strange excitement in   the cabin on the Burntwood. It was not so much a thing of physical   happening, but more the mysterious FEEL of something impending and   very near. The day following their arrival in the Pashkokogon  country  his master seemed to have forgotten him entirely. It was  Nada who  noticed him, but even she was different; and Father John  went about,  overseeing two Indians whom he kept very busy, his  pale, thin face  luminous with an anticipation which roused Peter's  curiosity, and kept  him watchful. He was puzzled, too, by the odd  actions of the humans  about him. The second morning Nada remained  in her room, and Jolly  Roger wandered off into the woods without  his breakfast, and Father  John ate alone, smiling gently as he  looked at the tightly closed door  of Nada's bedroom. Even  Oosimisk, the Leaf Bud, the sleek-haired  Indian woman who cared  for the house, was nervously expectant as she  watched for Nada,  and Mistoos, her husband, grunted and grimaced as he  carried in  from the edge of the forest many loads of soft evergreens  on his  shoulders. 
  Into the forest Jolly Roger went alone, puffing furiously at his   pipe. He was all a-tremble and his blood seemed to quiver and  dance  as it ran through his veins. Since the first rose-flush of  dawn he had  been awake, fighting against this upsetting of every  nerve that was in  him. 
  He felt pitiably weak and helpless. But it was the weakness and   helplessness of a happiness too vast for him to measure. It was  Nada  in her ragged shoes and dress, with the haunting torture of  Jed  Hawkins' brutality in her eyes and face, that he had expected  to find,  if he found her at all; someone to fight for, and kill  for if  necessary, someone his muscle and brawn would always  protect against  evil. He had not dreamed that in these many months  with Father John  she would change from &quot;a little kid goin' on  eighteen&quot; into&#8212;A WOMAN. 
  He tried to recall just what he had said to her last night&#8212;that   he was still an outlaw, and would always be, no matter how well he   lived from this day on; and that she, now that she had Father  John's  protection, was very foolish to care for him, or keep her  troth with  him, and would be happier if she could forget what had  happened at  Cragg's Ridge. 
  &quot;You're a WOMAN now,&quot; he said. &quot;A WOMAN&#8212;&quot; he had emphasized that   &#8212;&quot;and you don't need me any more.&quot; 
  And she had looked at him, without speaking, as if reading what   was inside him; and then, with a sudden little laugh, she swiftly   pulled her hair down about her shoulders, and repeated the very  words  she had said to him a long time ago&#8212;&quot;Without you&#8212;I'd want  to  die&#8212;Mister&#8212;Jolly Roger,&quot; and with that she turned and ran  into the  cabin, her hair flying riotously, and he had not seen her  again since  that moment. 
  Since then his heart had behaved like a thing with the fever, and   it was beating swiftly now as he looked at his watch and noted the   quick passing of time. 
  Back in the cabin Peter was sniffing at the crack under Nada's   door, and listening to her movement. For a long time he had heard   her, but not once had she opened the door. And he wondered, after   that, why Oosimisk and her husband and Father John piled  evergreens  all about, until the cabin looked like the little  jackpine  trysting-place down at Cragg's Ridge, even to the soft  carpet of grass  on the floor, and flowers scattered all about. 
  Hopeless of understanding what it meant, he went outside, and   waited in the warm May-day sun until his master came back through  the  clearing. What happened after that puzzled him greatly. When  he  followed Jolly Roger into the cabin Mistoos and the Leaf Bud  were  seated in chairs, their hands folded, and Father John stood  behind a  small table on which lay an open book, and he was looking  at his watch  when they came in. He nodded, and smiled, and very  clearly Peter saw  his master gulp, as if swallowing something that  was in his throat.  And the ruddiness had gone completely out of  his smooth-shaven cheeks.  It was the first time Peter had seen his  master so clearly afraid, and  from his burrow in the evergreens he  growled under his breath, eyeing  the open door with sudden thought  of an enemy. 
  And then Father John was tapping at Nada's door. 
  He went back to the table and waited, and as the knob of the door   turned very slowly Jolly Roger swallowed again, and took a step   toward it. It opened, and Nada stood there. And Jolly Roger gave a   little cry, so low that Peter could just hear it, as he held out  his  hands to her. 
  For Nada was no longer the Nada who had come to him in Father   John's clearing. She was the Nada of Cragg's Ridge, the Nada of  that  wild night of storm when he had fled into the north. Her hair  fell  about her, as in the old days when Peter and she had played  together  among the rocks and flowers, and her wedding dress was  faded and torn,  for it was the dress she had worn that night of  despair when she sent  her message to Peter's master, and on her  little feet were shoes  broken and disfigured by her flight in  those last hours of her mighty  effort to go with the man she  loved. In Father John's eyes, as she  stood there, was a great  astonishment; but in Jolly Roger's there came  such a joy that, in  answer to it, Nada went straight into his arms and  held up her  lips to be kissed. 
  Her cheeks were very pink when she stood beside McKay, with Father   John before them, the open book in his hands; and then, as her  long  lashes drooped over her eyes, and her breath came a little  more  quickly, she saw Peter staring at her questioningly, and made  a little  motion to him with her hand. He went to her, and her  fingers touched  his head as Father John began speaking. Peter  looked up, and listened,  and was very quiet in these moments.  Jolly Roger was staring straight  at the balsam-decked wall  opposite him, but there was something mighty  strong and proud in  the way he held his head, and the fear had gone  completely out of  his eyes. And Nada stood very close to him, so that  her brown head  lightly touched his shoulder and he could see the  silken shimmer  of loose tresses which with sweet intent she had let  fall over his  arm. And her little fingers clung tightly to his thumb,  as on that  blessed night when they had walked together across the  plain below  Cragg's Ridge, with the moon lighting their way. 
  Peter, in his dog way, fell a-wondering as he stood there, but   kept his manners and remained still. When it was all over he felt  a  desire to show his teeth and growl, for when Father John had  kissed  Nada, and was shaking Jolly Roger's hand, he saw his  mistress crying  in that strange, silent way he had so often seen  her crying in his  puppyhood days. Only now her blue eyes were wide  open as she looked at  Jolly Roger, and her cheeks were flushed to  the pink of wild rose  petals, and her lips were trembling a  little, and there was a tiny  something pulsing in her soft white  throat. And all at once there came  a smile with the tears, and  Jolly Roger&#8212;turning from Father John to  find her thus&#8212;gathered  her close in his arms, and Peter wagged his  tail and went out into  the sun-filled day, where he heard a red  squirrel challenging him  from a stub in the edge of the clearing. 
  A little later he saw Nada and his master come out of the cabin,   and walk hand in hand across the open into the sweet-smelling  timber  where Father John had been chopping with his axe. 
  On a fresh-cut log Nada sat down, and McKay sat beside her, still   holding her hand. Not once had he spoken in crossing the open, and  it  seemed as though little devils were holding his lips closed  now. 
  With her eyes looking down at the greening earth under their feet,   Nada said, very softly, 
  &quot;Mister&#8212;Jolly Roger&#8212;are you glad?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Glad that I am&#8212;your wife?&quot; 
  The word drew a great, sobbing breath from him, and looking up   suddenly she saw that he was staring over the balsam-tops into the   wonderful blue of the sky. 
  &quot;Your WIFE,&quot; she whispered, touching his shoulder gently with her   lips. 
  &quot;Yes, I'm glad,&quot; he said. &quot;So glad that I'm&#8212;afraid.&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;if you are glad&#8212;please kiss me again.&quot; 
  He stood up, and drew her to him, and held her face between his   hands as he kissed her red lips; and after that he kissed her  shining  hair again and again, and when he let her go her eyes were  a glory of  happiness. 
  &quot;And you will never run away from me again?&quot; she demanded, holding   him at arm's length. &quot;Never?&quot; 
  &quot;Never!&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;I want nothing more in this life,&quot; she said, nestling   against him again. &quot;Only you, for ever and ever.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger made no answer, but held her a long time in his arms,   with the soft beating of her heart against him, and listened to  the  twitter and song of nesting and mating things about them. In  this  silence she lay content, until Peter&#8212;growing restless&#8212;  started  quietly into the golden depths of the forest. 
  It was Pied-Bot's going, cautious and soft-footed, as if danger   and menace might lurk just ahead of him, that brought another look   into McKay's eyes as Nada's hand crept to his cheek, and rested   there. 
  &quot;You love me&#8212;very much?&quot; 
  &quot;More than life,&quot; he answered, and as he spoke he was watching   Peter, questing the soft wind that came whispering from the south. 
  Her finger touched his lips, gentle and sweet. 
  &quot;And wherever you go, I go&#8212;forever and always?&quot; she questioned. 
  &quot;Yes, forever and always&quot;&#8212;and his eyes were looking through miles   upon miles of deep forest, and at the end he saw the thin and   pitiless face of a man who was following his trail, Breault the   Ferret. 
  His arms closed more tightly about her, and he pressed her face   against him. 
  &quot;And I pray God you will never be sorry,&quot; he said, still looking   through the miles of forest. 
  &quot;No, no&#8212;sorry I shall never be,&quot; she cried softly. &quot;Not if we   fly, and go hungry, and fight&#8212;and die. Never shall I be sorry&#8212;  with  you,&quot; and he felt the tightening of her arms. 
  And then, as he remained silent, with his lips on the velvety   smoothness of her hair, she told him what Father John had already   told him&#8212;of her wild effort to overtake him in that night of  storm  when he had fled from the Missioner's cabin at Cragg's  Ridge; and in  turn he told her how Peter came to him in the break  of the morning  with the treasure which had saved him heart and  soul, and how he had  given that treasure into the keeping of  Yellow Bird, on the shores of  Wollaston. 
  And thereafter, for an hour, as they wandered through the May-time   sweetness of the forest, she would permit him to talk of only  Yellow  Bird and Sun Cloud; and, one thing leading to another, she  learned how  it was that Yellow Bird had been his fairy in  childhood days, and how  he came to be an outlaw for her in later  manhood. Her eyes were  shining when he had finished, and her red  lips were a-tremble with the  quickness of her breathing. 
  &quot;Some day&#8212;you'll take me there,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Oh, I'm so proud   of you, my Roger. And I love Yellow Bird. And Sun Cloud. Some day   &#8212;we'll go!&quot; 
  He nodded, happiness overshadowing the fear of Breault that had   grown in his heart. 
  &quot;Yes, we'll go. I've dreamed it, and the dream helped to keep me   alive&#8212;&quot; 
  And then he told her of Cassidy, and of the paradise he had found   with Giselle and her grandfather on the other side of Wollaston. 
  And so it happened the hours passed swiftly, and it was afternoon   when they returned to Father John's cabin, and Nada went into her   room. 
  In the early waning of the sun the feast which the Leaf Bud had   been preparing was ready, and not until then did Nada appear  again. 
  And once more the lump rose up in Roger's throat at the wonder of   her, for very completely she had transformed herself into a woman   again, from the softly shining coils of hair on the crown of her  head  to the coquettish little slippers that set off her dainty  feet. And he  saw the white gleam of soft shoulders and tender arms  where once had  been rags and bruises, and held there by the slim  beauty and exquisite  daintiness of her he stared like a fool,  until suddenly she laughed  joyously at his amaze, and ran to him  with wide-open arms, and kissed  him so soundly that Peter cocked  up his ears a bit startled. And then  she kissed Father John, and  after that was mistress at the table,  radiant in her triumph and  her eyes starry with happiness. 
  And she was no longer shy in speaking his name, but called him   Roger boldly and many times, and twice during that meal of  marvelous  forgetfulness&#8212;though long lashes covered her eyes when  she spoke  it&#8212;she called him 'my husband.' 
  In truth she was a woman and for the most part Roger McKay&#8212;   fighting man and very strong though he was&#8212;looked at her in dumb   worship, speaking little, his heart a-throb, and his brain reeling  in  the marvel of what at last had come into his possession. 
  And yet, even in this hour of supreme happiness that held him half   mute, there was always lurking in the back of his brain a thought  of  Breault, the Ferret.
