  That night, in Olaf's cabin, Alan put himself back on the old track  again. He made no effort to minimize the tragedy that had come into his  life, and he knew its effect upon him would never be wiped away, and  that Mary Standish would always live in his thoughts, no matter what  happened in the years to come. But he was not the sort to let any part  of himself wither up and die because of a blow that had darkened his  mental visions of things. His plans lay ahead of him, his old ambitions  and his dreams of achievement. They seemed pulseless and dead now, but  he knew it was because his own fire had temporarily burned out. And he  realized the vital necessity of building it up again. So he first wrote  a letter to Ellen McCormick, and in this placed a second  letter&#8212;carefully sealed&#8212;which was not to be opened unless they found  Mary Standish, and which contained something he had found impossible to  put into words in Sandy's cabin. It was trivial and embarrassing when  spoken to others, but it meant a great deal to him. Then he made the  final arrangements for Olaf to carry him to Seward in the<I> Norden</I>, for Captain Rifle's ship was well on her way to Unalaska. Thought of  Captain Rifle urged him to write another letter in which he told  briefly the disappointing details of his search.
  He was rather surprised the next morning to find he had entirely  forgotten Rossland. While he was attending to his affairs at the bank,  Olaf secured information that Rossland was resting comfortably in the  hospital and had not one chance in ten of dying. It was not Alan's  intention to see him. He wanted to hear nothing he might have to say  about Mary Standish. To associate them in any way, as he thought of her  now, was little short of sacrilege. He was conscious of the change in  himself, for it was rather an amazing upsetting of the original Alan  Holt. That person would have gone to Rossland with the deliberate and  businesslike intention of sifting the matter to the bottom that he  might disprove his own responsibility and set himself right in his own  eyes. In self-defense he would have given Rossland an opportunity to  break down with cold facts the disturbing something which his mind had  unconsciously built up. But the new Alan revolted. He wanted to carry  the thing away with him, he wanted it to live, and so it went with him,  uncontaminated by any truths or lies which Rossland might have told  him.
  They left Cordova early in the afternoon, and at sunset that evening  camped on the tip of a wooded island a mile or two from the mainland.  Olaf knew the island and had chosen it for reasons of his own. It was  primitive and alive with birds. Olaf loved the birds, and the cheer of  their vesper song and bedtime twitter comforted Alan. He seized an ax,  and for the first time in seven months his muscles responded to the  swing of it. And Ericksen, old as his years in the way of the north,  whistled loudly and rumbled a bit of crude song through his beard as he  lighted a fire, knowing the medicine of the big open was getting its  hold on Alan again. To Alan it was like coming to the edge of home once  more. It seemed an age, an infinity, since he had heard the sputtering  of bacon in an open skillet and the bubbling of coffee over a bed of  coals with the mysterious darkness of the timber gathering in about  him. He loaded his pipe after his chopping, and sat watching Olaf as he  mothered the half-baked bannock loaf. It made him think of his father.  A thousand times the two must have camped like this in the days when  Alaska was new and there were no maps to tell them what lay beyond the  next range.
  Olaf felt resting upon him something of the responsibility of a  doctor, and after supper he sat with his back to a tree and talked of  the old days as if they were yesterday and the day before, with  tomorrow always the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow which he had  pursued for thirty years. He was sixty just a week ago this evening, he  said, and he was beginning to doubt if he would remain on the beach at  Cordova much longer. Siberia was dragging him&#8212;that forbidden world of  adventure and mystery and monumental opportunity which lay only a few  miles across the strait from the Seward Peninsula. In his enthusiasm he  forgot Alan's tragedy. He cursed Cossack law and the prohibitory  measures to keep Americans out. More gold was over there than had ever  been dreamed of in Alaska; even the mountains and rivers were unnamed;  and he was going if he lived another year or two&#8212;going to find his  fortune or his end in the Stanovoi Mountains and among the Chukchi  tribes. Twice he had tried it since his old comrade had died, and twice  he had been driven out. The next time he would know how to go about it,  and he invited Alan to go with him.
  There was a thrill in this talk of a land so near, scarcely a night  ride across the neck of Bering Sea, and yet as proscribed as the sacred  plains of Tibet. It stirred old desires in Alan's blood, for he knew  that of all frontiers the Siberian would be the last and the greatest,  and that not only men, but nations, would play their part in the  breaking of it. He saw the red gleam of firelight in Olaf's eyes.
  &#8220;And if we don't go in first from<I> this side</I>, Alan, the yellow  fellows will come out some day from<I> that,&#8221;</I> rumbled the old  sour-dough, striking his pipe in the hollow of his hand. &#8220;And when they  do, they won't come over to us in ones an' twos an' threes, but in  millions. That's what the yellow fellows will do when they once get  started, an' it's up to a few Alaska Jacks an' Tough-Nut Bills to get  their feet planted first on the other side. Will you go?&#8221;
  Alan shook his head. &#8220;Some day&#8212;but not now.&#8221; The old flash was in  his eyes and he was seeing the fight ahead of him again&#8212;the fight to  do his bit in striking the shackles of misgovernment from Alaska and  rousing the world to an understanding of the menace which hung over her  like a smoldering cloud. &#8220;But you're right about the danger,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;It won't come from Japan to California. It will pour like a flood  through Siberia and jump to Alaska in a night. It isn't the danger of  the yellow man alone, Olaf. You've got to combine that with Bolshevism,  the menace of blackest Russia. A disease which, if it crosses the  little neck of water and gets hold of Alaska, will shake the American  continent to bed-rock. It may be a generation from now, maybe a  century, but it's coming sure as God makes light&#8212;if we let Alaska go  down and out. And my way of preventing it is different from yours.&#8221;
  He stared into the fire, watching the embers flare up and die. &#8220;I'm  not proud of the States,&#8221; he went on, as if speaking to something which  he saw in the flames. &#8220;I can't be, after the ruin their unintelligent  propaganda and legislation have brought upon Alaska. But they're our  salvation and conditions are improving. I concede we have factions in  Alaska and we are not at all unanimous in what we want. It's going to  be largely a matter of education. We can't take Alaska down to the  States&#8212;we've got to bring them up to us. We must make a large part of  a hundred and ten million Americans understand. We must bring a million  of them up here before that danger-flood we speak of comes beyond the  Gulf of Anadyr. It's God's own country we have north of Fifty-eight,  Olaf. And we have ten times the wealth of California. We can care for a  million people easily. But bad politics and bad judgment both here in  Alaska and at Washington won't let them come. With coal enough under  our feet to last a thousand years, we are buying fuel from the States.  We've got billions in copper and oil, but can't touch them. We should  have some of the world's greatest manufacturing plants, but we can not,  because everything up here is locked away from us. I repeat that isn't  conservation. If they had applied a little of it to the salmon  industry&#8212;but they didn't. And the salmon are going, like the buffalo  of the plains.
  &#8220;The destruction of the salmon shows what will happen to us if the  bars are let down all at once to the financial banditti. Understanding  and common sense must guard the gates. The fight we must win is to  bring about an honest and reasonable adjustment, Olaf. And that fight  will take place right here&#8212;in Alaska&#8212;and not in Siberia. And if we  don't win&#8212;&#8221;
  He raised his eyes from the fire and smiled grimly into Olaf's  bearded face.
  &#8220;Then we can count on that thing coming across the neck of sea from  the Gulf of Anadyr,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;And if it ever does come, the people  of the States will at last face the tragic realization of what Alaska  could have meant to the nation.&#8221;
  The force of the old spirit surged uppermost in Alan again, and  after that, for an hour or more, something lived for him in the glow of  the fire which Olaf kept burning. It was the memory of Mary Standish,  her quiet, beautiful eyes gazing at him, her pale face taking form in  the lacy wisps of birch-smoke. His mind pictured her in the flame-glow  as she had listened to him that day in Skagway, when he had told her of  this fight that was ahead. And it pleased him to think she would have  made this same fight for Alaska if she had lived. It was a thought  which brought a painful thickening in his breath, for always these  visions which Olaf could not see ended with Mary Standish as she had  faced him in his cabin, her back against the door, her lips trembling,  and her eyes softly radiant with tears in the broken pride of that last  moment of her plea for life.
  He could not have told how long he slept that night. Dreams came to  him in his restless slumber, and always they awakened him, so that he  was looking at the stars again and trying not to think. In spite of the  grief in his soul they were pleasant dreams, as though some gentle  force were at work in him subconsciously to wipe away the shadows of  tragedy. Mary Standish was with him again, between the mountains at  Skagway; she was at his side in the heart of the tundras, the sun in  her shining hair and eyes, and all about them the wonder of wild roses  and purple iris and white seas of sedge-cotton and yellow-eyed daisies,  and birds singing in the gladness of summer. He heard the birds. And he  heard the girl's voice, answering them in her happiness and turning  that happiness from the radiance of her eyes upon him. When he awoke,  it was with a little cry, as if someone had stabbed him; and Olaf was  building a fire, and dawn was breaking in rose-gleams over the  mountains.
