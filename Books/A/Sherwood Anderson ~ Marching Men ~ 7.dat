And then a new element asserted itself in the life of McGregor. One of  the hundreds of disintegrating forces that attack strong natures,  striving to scatter their force in the back currents of life, attacked  him. His big body began to feel with enervating persistency the call  of sex.    
In the house in Wycliff Place McGregor passed as a mystery. By keeping  silence he won a reputation for wisdom. The clerks in the hall  bedrooms thought him a scientist. The woman from Cairo thought him a  theological student. Down the hall a pretty girl with large black eyes  who worked in a department store down town dreamed of him at night.  When in the evening he banged the door to his room and strode down the  hallway going to the night school she sat in a chair by the open door  of her room. As he passed she raised her eyes and looked at him  boldly. When he returned she was again by the door and again she  looked boldly at him.    
In his room, after the meetings with the black-eyed girl McGregor  found difficulty in keeping his mind on the reading. He felt as he had  felt with the pale girl on the hillside beyond Coal Creek. With her as  with the pale girl he felt the need of defending himself. He began to  make it a practice to hurry along past her door.    
The girl in the hall bedroom thought constantly of McGregor. When he  had gone to night school another young man of the house who wore a  Panama hat came from the floor above and, putting his hands on the  door frames of her room, stood looking at her and talking. In his lips  he held a cigarette, which when he talked hung limply from the corner  of his mouth.    
This young man and the black-eyed girl kept up a continuous stream of  comments on the doings of red-haired McGregor. Begun by the young man,  who hated him because of his silence, the subject was kept alive by  the girl who wanted to talk of McGregor.    
On Saturday nights the young man and the girl sometimes went together  to the theatre. One night in the summer when they had returned to the  front of the house the girl stopped. "Let's see what the big red-head  is doing," she said.    
Going around the block they stole in the darkness down an alleyway and  stood in the little dirty court looking up at McGregor who, with his  feet in the window and a lamp burning at his shoulder, sat in his room  reading.    
When they returned to the front of the house the black-eyed girl  kissed the young man, closing her eyes and thinking of McGregor. In  her room later she lay abed dreaming. She imagined herself assaulted  by the young man who had crept into her room and that McGregor had  come roaring down the hall to snatch him away and fling him outside  the door.    
At the end of the hallway near the stairway leading to the street  lived a barber. He had deserted a wife and four children in a town in  Ohio and to prevent recognition had grown a black beard. Between this  man and McGregor a companionship had sprung up and they went together  on Sunday mornings to walk in the park. The black bearded man called  himself Frank Turner.    
Frank Turner had a passion. Through the evenings and on Sunday  afternoons he sat in his room making violins. He worked with a knife,  glue, pieces of glass and sand paper and spent his earnings for  ingredients for the making of varnishes. When he got hold of a piece  of wood that seemed an answer to his prayers he took it to McGregor's  room and holding it up to the light talked of what he would do with  it. Sometimes he brought a violin and sitting in the open window  tested the quality of its tone. One evening he took an hour of  McGregor's time to talk of the varnish of Cremona and to read to him  from a worn little book concerning the old Italian masters of violin  making.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
On a bench in the park sat Turner, the maker of violins, the man who  dreamed of the rediscovery of the varnish of Cremona, talking to  McGregor, son of the Pennsylvania miner.    
It was a Sunday afternoon and the park was vibrant with life. All day  the street cars had been unloading Chicagoans at the park entrance.  They came in pairs and in parties, young men with their sweethearts  and fathers with families at their heels. Now at the end of the day  they continued to come, a steady stream of humanity flowing along the  gravel walk past the bench where the two men sat in talk. Through the  stream and crossing it went another stream homeward bound. Babies  cried. Fathers called to the children at play on the grass. Cars  coming to the park filled went away filled.    
McGregor looked about him and thought of himself and of the restless  moving people. In him there was none of that vague fear of the  multitude common to many solitary souls. His contempt of men and of  the lives lived by men reinforced his native boldness. The odd little  rounding of the shoulders of even the athletic young men made him  straighten with pride his own shoulders and fat and lean, tall and  short, he thought of all men as counters in some vast games at which  he was presently to be a master player.    
The passion for form, that strange intuitive power that many men have  felt and none but the masters of human life have understood, had begun  to awaken in him. Already he had begun to sense out the fact that for  him law was but an incident in some vast design and he was altogether  untouched by the desire for getting on in the world, by the greedy  little snatching at trifles that was the whole purpose of the lives of  so many of the people about him. When somewhere in the park a band  began to play he nodded his head up and down and ran his hand  nervously up and down the legs of his trousers. Into his mind came the  desire to boast to the barber, telling of the things he meant to do in  the world, but he put the desire away. Instead he sat silently  blinking his eyes and wondering at the persistent air of  ineffectiveness in the people who passed. When a band went by playing  march music and followed by some fifty men wearing white plumes in  their hats and walking with self-conscious awkwardness, he was  startled. Among the people he thought there was a change. Something  like a running shadow passed over them. The babbling of voices ceased  and like himself the people began to nod their heads. A thought,  gigantic in its simplicity, began to come into his mind but was wiped  out immediately by his impatience with the marchers. A madness to  spring up and run among them knocking them about and making them march  with the power that comes of abandonment almost lifted him from the  bench. His mouth twitched and his fingers ached for action.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
In and out among the trees and on the green spaces moved the people.  Along the shores of a pond sat men and women eating the evening meal  from baskets or from white cloths spread on the grass. They laughed  and shouted at each other and at the children, calling them back from  the gravel driveways filled with moving carriages. Beaut saw a girl  throw an egg shell and hit a young fellow between the eyes, and then  run laughing away along the shore of the pond. Under a tree a woman  nursed a babe, covering her breasts with a shawl so that just the  black head of the babe showed. Its tiny hand clutched at the mouth of  the woman. In an open space in the shadow of a building young men  played baseball, the shouts of the spectators rising above the murmur  of the voices of people on the gravel walk.    
A thought came into McGregor's mind that he wanted to discuss with the  older man. He was moved by the sight of women about and shook himself  like one awakening from a dream. Then he began looking at the ground  and kicking up the gravel with his foot. "Look here," he said, turning  to the barber, "what is a man to do about women, about getting what he  wants from the women?"    
The barber seemed to understand. "It has come to that then?" he asked  and looked quickly up. He lighted a pipe and sat looking at the  people. It was then he told McGregor of the wife and four children in  the Ohio town, describing the little brick house and the garden and  the coop for chickens at the back like one who lingers over a place  dear to his fancy. Something old and weary was in his voice as he  finished.    
"It wasn't a matter for me to decide," he said. "I came away because I  couldn't do anything else. I'm not excusing myself, I'm just telling  you. There was something messy and disorderly about it all, about my  life with her and with them. I couldn't stand it. I felt myself being  submerged by something. I wanted to be orderly and to work, you see. I  couldn't let violin making alone. Lord, how I tried--tried bluffing  myself about it--calling it a fad."    
The barber looked nervously at McGregor to reassure himself of his  interest. "I owned a shop on the main street of our town. Back of it  was a blacksmith shop. During the day I stood by the chair in my shop  talking to men being shaved about the love of women and a man's duty  to his family. Summer afternoons I went and sat on a keg in the  blacksmith shop and talked of the same thing with the smith but all  that did me no good.    
"When I let myself go I dreamed not of my duty to my family but of  working undisturbed as I do now here in the city in my room in the  evenings and on Sundays."    
A sharpness came into the voice of the speaker. He turned to McGregor  and talked vigorously like one making a defence. "My woman was a good  enough sort," he said. "I suppose loving is an art like writing a book  or drawing pictures or making violins. People try to do it and don't  succeed. In the end we threw the job up and just lived together like  most people do. Our lives got mussy and meaningless. That's how it  was.    
"Before she married me my wife had been a stenographer in a factory  that made tin cans. She liked that work. She could make her fingers  dance along the keys. When she read a book at home she didn't think  the writer amounted to much if he made mistakes about punctuation. Her  boss was so proud of her that he would brag of her work to visitors  and sometimes would go off fishing leaving the running of the business  in her hands.    
"I don't know why she married me. She was happier there and she is  happier back there now. We got to walking together on Sunday evenings  and standing under the trees on side streets, kissing and looking at  each other. We talked about a lot of things. We seemed to need each  other. Then we got married and started living together.    
"It didn't work out. After we had been married a few years things  changed. I don't know why. I thought I was the same as I had been and  I think she was. We used to sit around quarrelling about it, each  blaming the other. Anyway we didn't get along.    
"We would sit on the little front porch of our house in the evening,  she bragging of the work she had done in the can factory and I  dreaming of quietude and a chance to work on the violins. I thought I  knew a way to increase the quality and beauty of tone and I had that  idea about varnish I have talked to you about. I even dreamed of doing  things those old fellows of Cremona didn't do.    
"When she had been talking of her work in the office for maybe a half  hour she would look up and find that I hadn't been listening. We would  quarrel. We even quarrelled before the children after they came. Once  she said that she didn't see how it would matter if no violins had  ever been made and that night I dreamed of choking her in bed. I woke  up and lay there beside her thinking of it with something like real  satisfaction in just the thought that one long hard grip of my fingers  would get her out of my way for good.    
"We didn't always feel that way. Every little while a change would  come over both of us and we would begin to take an interest in each  other. I would be proud of the work she had done in the factory and  would brag of it to men coming into the shop. In the evening she would  be sympathetic about the violins and put the baby to bed to let me  alone at my work in the kitchen.    
"Then we would begin to sit in the darkness in the house and hold each  other's hands. We would forgive things that had been said and play a  sort of game, chasing each other about the room in the darkness and  knocking against the chairs and laughing. Then we would begin to look  at each other and kiss. Presently there would be another baby."    
The barber threw up his hands with a gesture of impatience. His voice  lost its softer, reminiscent quality. "Such times didn't last," he  said. "On the whole it was no life to live. I came away. The children  are in a state institution and she has gone back to her work in the  office. The town hates me. They have made a heroine of her. I'm here  talking to you with these whiskers on my face so that people from my  town wouldn't know me if they came along. I'm a barber and I would  shave them off fast enough if it wasn't for that."    
A woman walking past looked back at McGregor. In her eyes lurked an  invitation. It reminded him of something in the eyes of the pale  daughter of the undertaker of Coal Creek. An uneasy tremor ran through  him. "What do you do about women now?" he asked.    
The voice of the smaller man arose harsh and excited in the evening  air. "I get the feeling taken out of me as a man would have a tooth  fixed," he said. "I pay money for the service and keep my mind on what  I want to do. There are plenty of women for that, women who are good  for that only. When I first came here I used to wander about at night,  wanting to go to my room and work but with my mind and my will  paralysed by that feeling. I don't do that now and I won't again. What  I do many men do--good men--men who do good work. What's the use  thinking about it when you only run against a stone wall and get  hurt?"    
The black bearded man arose, thrust his hands into his trousers  pockets and looked about him. Then he sat down again. He seemed to be  filled with suppressed excitement. "There is a big hidden something  going on in modern life," he said, talking rapidly and excitedly. "It  used to touch only the men higher up, now it reaches down to men like  me--barbers and workingmen. Men know about it but don't talk and don't  dare think. Their women have changed. Women used to be willing to do  anything for men, just be slaves to them. The best men don't ask that  now and don't want that."    
He jumped to his feet and stood over McGregor. "Men don't understand  what's going on and don't care," he said. "They are too busy getting  things done or going to ball games or quarrelling about politics.    
"And what do they know about it if they are fools enough to think?  They get thrown into false notions. They see about them a lot of fine  purposeful women maybe caring for their children and they blame  themselves for their vices and are ashamed. Then they turn to the  other women anyway, shutting their eyes and going ahead. They pay for  what they want as they would pay for a dinner, thinking no more of the  women who serve them than they do of the waitresses who serve them in  the restaurants. They refuse to think of the new kind of woman that is  growing up. They know that if they get sentimental about her they'll  get into trouble or get new tests put to them, be disturbed you see,  and spoil their work or their peace of mind. They don't want to get  into trouble or be disturbed. They want to get a better job or enjoy a  ball game or build a bridge or write a book. They think that a man who  gets sentimental about any woman is a fool and of course he is."    
"Do you mean that all of them do that?" asked McGregor. He wasn't  upset by what had been said. It struck him as being true. For himself  he was afraid of women. It seemed to him that a road was being built  by his companion along which he might travel with safety. He wanted  the man to go on talking. Into his brain flashed the thought that if  he had the thing to do over there would have been a different ending  to the afternoon spent with the pale girl on the hillside.    
The barber sat down upon the bench. The flush out of his cheeks. "Well  I have done pretty well myself," he said, "but then you know I make  violins and don't think of women. I've been in Chicago two years and  I've spent just eleven dollars. I would like to know what the average  man spends. I wish some fellow would get the facts and publish them.  It would make people sit up. There must be millions spent here every  year."    
"You see I'm not very strong and I stand all day on my feet in the  barber shop." He looked at McGregor and laughed. "The black-eyed girl  in the hall is after you," he said. "You'd better look out. You let  her alone. Stick to your law books. You are not like me. You are big  and red and strong. Eleven dollars won't pay your way here in Chicago  for no two years."    
McGregor looked again at the people moving toward the park entrance in  the gathering darkness. He thought it wonderful that a brain could  think a thing out so clearly and words express thoughts so lucidly.  His eagerness to follow the passing girls with his eyes was gone. He  was interested in the older man's viewpoint. "And what about  children?" he asked.    
The older man sat sideways on the bench. There was a troubled look in  his eyes and a suppressed eager quality in his voice. "I'm going to  tell you about that," he said. "I don't want to keep anything back.    
"Look here!" he demanded, sliding along the bench toward McGregor and  emphasising his points by slapping one hand down upon the other.  "Ain't all children my children?" He paused, trying to gather his  scattered thoughts into words. When McGregor started to speak he put  his hand up as though to ward off a new thought or another question.  "I'm not trying to dodge," he said. "I'm trying to get thoughts that  have been in my head day after day in shape to tell. I haven't tried  to express them before. I know men and women cling to their children.  It's the only thing they have left of the dream they had before they  married. I felt that way. It held me for a long time. It would be  holding me now only that the violins pulled so hard at me."    
He threw up his hand impatiently. "You see I had to find an answer. I  couldn't think of being a skunk--running away--and I couldn't stay. I  wasn't intended to stay. Some men are intended to work and take care  of children and serve women perhaps but others have to keep trying for  a vague something all their lives--like me trying for a tone on a  violin. If they don't get it it doesn't matter, they have to keep  trying.    
"My wife used to say I'd get tired of it. No woman ever really  understands a man caring for anything except herself. I knocked that  out of her."    
The little man looked up at McGregor. "Do you think I'm a skunk?" he  asked.    
McGregor looked at him gravely. "I don't know," he said. "Go on and  tell me about the children."    
"I said they were the last things to cling to. They are. We used to  have religion. But that's pretty well gone now--the old kind. Now men  think about children, I mean a certain kind of men--the ones that have  work they want to get on with. Children and work are the only things  that kind care about. If they have a sentiment about women it's only  about their own--the one they have in the house with them. They want  to keep that one finer than they are themselves. So they work the  other feeling out on the paid women.    
"Women fuss about men loving children. Much they care. It's only a  plan for demanding adulation for themselves that they don't earn.  Once, when I first came to the city, I took a place as servant in a  wealthy family. I wanted to stay under cover until my beard grew.  Women used to come there to receptions and to meetings in the  afternoon to talk about reforms they were interested in----Bah! They  work and scheme trying to get at men. They are at it all their lives,  flattering, diverting us, giving us false ideas, pretending to be weak  and uncertain when they are strong and determined. They have no mercy.  They wage war on us trying to make us slaves. They want to take us  captive home to their houses as Caesar took captives home to Rome.    
"You look here!" He jumped to his feet again and shook his fingers at  McGregor. "You just try something. You try being open and frank and  square with a woman--any woman--as you would with a man. Let her live  her own life and ask her to let you live yours. You try it. She won't.  She will die first."    
He sat down again upon the bench and shook his head back and forth.  "Lord how I wish I could talk!" he said. "I'm making a muddle of this  and I wanted to tell you. Oh, how I wanted to tell you! It's part of  my idea that a man should tell a boy all he knows. We've got to quit  lying to them."    
McGregor looked at the ground. He was profoundly and deeply moved and  interested as he had never before been moved by anything but hate.    
Two women coming along the gravel walk stopped under a tree and looked  back. The barber smiled and raised his hat. When they smiled back at  him he rose and started toward them. "Come on boy," he whispered  behind his hand to McGregor. "Let's get them."    
When McGregor looked up the scene before his eyes infuriated him. The  smiling barber with his hat in his hand, the two women waiting under  the tree, the look of half-guilty innocence on the faces of all of  them, stirred a blind fury in his brain. He sprang forward, clutching  the shoulder of Turner with his hand. Whirling him about he threw him  to his hands and knees. "Get out of here you females!" he roared at  the women who ran off in terror down the walk.    
The barber sat again upon the bench beside McGregor. He rubbed his  hands together to brush the bits of gravel out of the flesh. "What's  got wrong with you?" he asked.    
McGregor hesitated. He wondered how he should tell what was in his  mind. "Everything in its place," he said finally. "I wanted to go on  with our talk."    
Lights flashed out of the darkness of the park. The two men sat on the  bench thinking each his own thoughts.    
"I want to take some work out of the clamps to-night," the barber  said, looking at his watch. Together the two men walked along the  street. "Look here," said McGregor. "I didn't mean to hurt you. Those  two women that came up and interfered with what we were working out  made me furious."    
"Women always interfere," said the barber. "They raise hell with men."  His mind ran out and began to play with the world-old problem of the  sexes. "If a lot of women fall in the fight with us men and become our  slaves--serving us as the paid women do--need they fuss about it? Let  them be game and try to help work it out as men have been game and  have worked and thought through ages of perplexity and defeat."    
The barber stopped on the street corner to fill and light his pipe.  "Women can change everything when they want to," he said, looking at  McGregor and letting the match burn out in his fingers. "They can have  motherhood pensions and room to work out their own problem in the  world or anything else that they really want. They can stand up face  to face with men. They don't want to. They want to enslave us with  their faces and their bodies. They want to carry on the old, old weary  fight." He tapped McGregor on the arm. "If a few of us--wanting with  all our might to get something done--beat them at their own game,  don't we deserve the victory?" he asked.    
"But sometimes I think I would like a woman to live with, you know,  just to sit and talk with me," said McGregor.    
The barber laughed. Puffing at his pipe he walked down the street. "To  be sure! To be sure!" he said. "I would. Any man would. I like to sit  in the room for a spell in the evening talking to you but I would hate  to give up violin making and be bound all my life to serve you and  your purposes just the same."    
In the hallway of their own house the barber spoke to McGregor as he  looked down the hallway to where the door of the black eyed girl's  room had just crept open. "You let women alone," he said; "when you  feel you can't stay away from them any longer you come and talk it  over with me."    
McGregor nodded and went along the hallway to his own room. In the  darkness he stood by the window and looked down into the court. The  feeling of hidden power, the ability to rise above the mess into which  modern life had sunk that had come to him in the park, returned and he  walked nervously about. When finally he sat down upon a chair and  leaning forward put his head in his hands he felt like one who has  started on a long journey through a strange and dangerous country and  who has unexpectedly come upon a friend going the same way.
