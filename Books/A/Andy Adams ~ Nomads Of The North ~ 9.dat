  Had Makoki, the leather-faced old Cree runner between God's Lake   and Fort Churchill, known the history of Miki and Neewa up to the   point where they came to feast on the fat and partly devoured  carcass  of the young caribou bull, he would have said that Iskoo  Wapoo, the  Good Spirit of the beasts, was watching over them most  carefully. For  Makoki had great faith in the forest gods as well  as in those of his  own tepee. He would have given the story his  own picturesque version,  and would have told it to the little  children of his son's children;  and his son's children would have  kept it in their memory for their  own children later on. 
  It was not in the ordained nature of things that a black bear cub   and a Mackenzie hound pup with a dash of Airedale and Spitz in him   should &quot;chum up&quot; together as Neewa and Miki had done. Therefore,  he  would have said, the Beneficent Spirit who watched over the  affairs of  four-legged beasts must have had an eye on them from  the beginning. It  was she&#8212;Iskoo Wapoo was a goddess and not a god  &#8212;who had made  Challoner kill Neewa's mother, the big black bear;  and it was she who  had induced him to tie the pup and the cub  together on the same piece  of rope, so that when they fell out of  the white man's canoe into the  rapids they would not die, but  would be company and salvation for each  other. NESWA-PAWUK (&quot;two  little brothers&quot;) Makoki would have called  them; and had it come  to the test he would have cut off a finger  before harming either  of them. But Makoki knew nothing of their  adventures, and on this  morning when they came down to the feast he  was a hundred miles  away, haggling with a white man who wanted a  guide. He would never  know that Iskoo Wapoo was at his side that very  moment, planning  the thing that was to mean so much in the lives of  Neewa and Miki. 
  Meanwhile Neewa and Miki went at their breakfast as if starved.   They were immensely practical. They did not look back on what had   happened, but for the moment submerged themselves completely in  the  present. The few days of thrill and adventure through which  they had  gone seemed like a year. Neewa's yearning for his mother  had grown  less and less insistent, and Miki's lost master counted  for nothing  now, as things were going with him. Last night was the  big, vivid  thing in their memories&#8212;their fight for life with the  monster owls,  their flight, the killing of the young caribou bull  by the wolves, and  (with Miki) the short, bitter experience with  Maheegun, the renegade  she-wolf. His shoulder burned where she had  torn at him with her  teeth. But this did not lessen his appetite.  Growling as he ate, he  filled himself until he could hold no more. 
  Then he sat back on his haunches and looked in the direction   Maheegun had taken. 
  It was eastward, toward Hudson Bay, over a great plain that lay   between two ridges that were like forest walls, yellow and gold in   the morning sun. He had never seen the world as it looked to him  now.  The wolves had overtaken the caribou on a scarp on the high  ground  that thrust itself out like a short fat thumb from the  black and  owl-infested forest, and the carcass lay in a meadowy  dip that  overhung the plain. From the edge of this dip Miki could  look  down&#8212;and so far away that the wonder of what he saw  dissolved itself  at last into the shimmer of the sun and the blue  of the sky. Within  his vision lay a paradise of marvellous  promise; wide stretches of  soft, green meadow; clumps of timber,  park-like until they merged into  the deeper forest that began with  the farther ridge; great patches of  bush radiant with the  colouring of June; here and there the gleam of  water, and half a  mile away a lake that was like a giant mirror set in  a purplish-  green frame of balsam and spruce. 
  Into these things Maheegun, the she-wolf, had gone. He wondered   whether she would come back. He sniffed the air for her. But there   was no longer the mother-yearning in his heart. Something had  already  begun to tell him of the vast difference between the dog  and the wolf.  For a few moments, still hopeful that the world held  a mother for him,  he had mistaken her for the one he had lost. But  he understood now. A  little more and Maheegun's teeth would have  snapped his shoulder, or  slashed his throat to the jugular. TEBAH-  GONE-GAWIN (the One Great  Law) was impinging itself upon him, the  implacable law of the survival  of the fittest. To live was to  fight&#8212;to kill; to beat everything that  had feet or wings. The  earth and the air held menace for him. Nowhere,  since he had lost  Challoner, had he found friendship except in the  heart of Neewa,  the motherless cub. And he turned toward Neewa now,  growling at a  gay-plumaged moose-bird that was hovering about for a  morsel of  meat. 
  A few minutes before, Neewa had weighed a dozen pounds; now he   weighed fourteen or fifteen. His stomach was puffed out like the   sides of an overfilled bag, and he sat humped up in a pool of warm   sunshine licking his chops and vastly contented with himself and  the  world. Miki rubbed up to him, and Neewa gave a chummy grunt.  Then he  rolled over on his fat back and invited Miki to play. It  was the first  time; and with a joyous yelp Miki jumped into him.  Scratching and  biting and kicking, and interjecting their friendly  scrimmage with  ferocious growling on Miki's part and pig-like  grunts and squeals on  Neewa's, they rolled to the edge of the dip.  It was a good hundred  feet to the bottom&#8212;a steep, grassy slope  that ran to the plain&#8212;and  like two balls they catapulted the  length of it. For Neewa it was not  so bad. He was round and fat,  and went easily. 
  With Miki it was different. He was all legs and skin and angular   bone, and he went down twisting and somersaulting and tying  himself  into knots until by the time he struck the hard strip of  shale at the  edge of the plain he was drunk with dizziness and the  breath was out  of his body. He staggered to his feet with a gasp.  For a space the  world was whirling round and round in a sickening  circle. Then he  pulled himself together, and made out Neewa a  dozen feet away. 
  Neewa was just awakening to the truth of an exhilarating   discovery. Next to a boy on a sled, or a beaver on its tail, no  one  enjoys a &quot;slide&quot; more than a black bear cub, and as Miki  rearranged  his scattered wits Neewa climbed twenty or thirty feet  up the slope  and deliberately rolled down again! Miki's jaws fell  apart in  amazement. Again Neewa climbed up and rolled down&#8212;and  Miki ceased to  breathe altogether. Five times he watched Neewa go  that twenty or  thirty feet up the grassy slope and tumble down.  The fifth time he  waded into Neewa and gave him a rough-and-tumble  that almost ended in  a fight. 
  After that Miki began exploring along the foot of the slope, and   for a scant hundred yards Neewa humoured him by following, but  beyond  that point he flatly refused to go. In the fourth month of  his  exciting young life Neewa was satisfied that Nature had given  him  birth that he might have the endless pleasure of filling his  stomach.  For him, eating was the one and only excuse for existing.  In the next  few months he had a big job on his hands if he kept up  the record of  his family, and the fact that Miki was apparently  abandoning the fat  and juicy carcass of the young bull filled him  with alarm and  rebellion. Straightway he forgot all thought of  play and started back  up the slope on a mission that was 100 per  cent. business. 
  Observing this, Miki gave up his idea of exploration and joined   him. They reached the shelf of the dip twenty yards from the  carcass  of the bull, and from a clutter of big stones looked forth  upon their  meat. In that moment they stood dumb and paralyzed. Two  gigantic owls  were tearing at the carcass. To Miki and Neewa these  were the monsters  of the black forest out of which they had  escaped so narrowly with  their lives. But as a matter of fact they  were not of Oohoomisew's  breed of night-seeing pirates. They were  Snowy Owls, unlike all others  of their kind in that their vision  was as keen as a hawk's in the  light of broad day. Mispoon, the  big male, was immaculately white. His  mate, a size or two smaller,  was barred with brownish-slate  colour&#8212;and their heads were round  and terrible looking because they  had no ear-tufts. Mispoon, with  his splendid wings spread half over  the carcass of Ahtik, the dead  bull, was rending flesh so ravenously  with his powerful beak that  Neewa and Miki could hear the sound of it.  Newish, his mate, had  her head almost buried in Ahtik's bowels. The  sight of them and  the sound of their eating were enough to disturb the  nerves of an  older bear than Neewa, and he crouched behind a stone,  with just  his head sticking out. 
  In Miki's throat was a sullen growl. But he held it back, and   flattened himself on the ground. The blood of the giant hunter  that  was his father rose in him again like fire. The carcass was  his meat,  and he was ready to fight for it. Besides, had he not  whipped the big  owl in the forest? But here there were two. The  fact held him  flattened on his belly a moment or two longer, and  in that brief space  the unexpected happened. 
  Slinking up out of the low growth of bush at the far edge of the   dip lie saw Maheegun, the renegade she-wolf. Hollow-backed, red-   eyed, her bushy tail hanging with the sneaky droop of the  murderess,  she advanced over the bit of open, a gray and vengeful  shadow. Furtive  as she was, she at least acted with great  swiftness. Straight at  Mispoon she launched herself with a snarl  and snap of fangs that made  Miki hug the ground still closer. 
  Deep into Mispoon's four-inch armour of feathers Maheegun buried   her fangs. Taken at a disadvantage Mispoon's head would have been   torn from his body before he could have gathered himself for  battle  had it not been for Newish. Pulling her blood stained head  from  Ahtik's flesh and blood she drove at Maheegun with a throaty,  wheezing  scream&#8212;a cry that was like the cry of no other thing  that lived. Into  the she-wolf's back she sank her beak and talons  and Maheegun gave up  her grip on Mispoon and tore ferociously at  her new assailant. For a  space Mispoon was saved, but it was at a  terrible sacrifice to Newish.  With a single lucky slash of her  long-fanged jaws, Maheegun literally  tore one of Newish's great  wings from her body. The croak of agony  that came out of her may  have held the death-note for Mispoon, her  mate; for he rose on his  wings, poised himself for an instant, and  launched himself at the  she-wolf's back with a force that drove  Maheegun off her feet. 
  Deep into her loins the great owl sank his talons, gripping at the   renegade's vitals with an avenging and ferocious tenacity. In that   hold Maheegun felt the sting of death. She flung herself on her  back;  she rolled over and over, snarling and snapping and clawing  the air in  her efforts to free herself of the burning knives that  were sinking  still deeper into her bowels. Mispoon hung on,  rolling as she rolled,  beating with his giant wings, fastening his  talons in that clutch that  death could not shake loose. On the  ground his mate was dying. Her  life's blood was pouring out of the  hole in her side, but with the  dimming vision of death she made a  last effort to help Mispoon. And  Mispoon, a hero to the last, kept  his grip until he was dead. 
  Into the edge of the bush Maheegun dragged herself. There she   freed herself of the big owl. But the deep wounds were still in  her  sides. The blood dripped from her belly as she made her way  down into  the thicker cover, leaving a red trail behind her. A  quarter of a mile  away she lay down under a clump of dwarf spruce;  and there, a little  later, she died. 
  To Neewa and Miki&#8212;and especially to the son of Hela&#8212;the grim   combat had widened even more that subtle and growing comprehension  of  the world as it existed for them. It was the unforgettable  wisdom of  experience backed by an age-old instinct and the  heredity of breed.  They had killed small things&#8212;Neewa, his bugs  and his frogs and his  bumble-bees; Miki, his rabbit&#8212;they had  fought for their lives; they  had passed through experiences that,  from the beginning, had been a  gamble with death; but it had  needed the climax of a struggle such as  they had seen with their  own eyes to open up the doors that gave them  a new viewpoint of  life. 
  It was many minutes before Miki went forth and smelled of Newish,   the dead owl. He had no desire now to tear at her feathers in the   excitement of an infantile triumph and ferocity. Along with  greater  understanding a new craft and a new cunning were born in  him. The fate  of Mispoon and his mate had taught him the priceless  value of silence  and of caution, for he knew now that in the world  there were many  things that were not afraid of him, and many  things that would not run  away from him. He had lost his fearless  and blatant contempt for  winged creatures; he had learned that the  earth was not made for him  alone, and that to hold his small place  on it he must fight as  Maheegun and the owls had fought. This was  because in Miki's veins was  the red fighting blood of a long line  of ancestors that reached back  to the wolves. 
  In Neewa the process of deduction was vastly different. His breed   was not the fighting breed, except as it fought among its own  kind.  It did not make a habit of preying upon other beasts, and no  other  beast preyed upon it. This was purely an accident of birth&#8212;  the fact  that no other creature in all his wide domain was  powerful enough,  either alone or in groups, to defeat a grown  black bear in open  battle. Therefore Neewa learned nothing of  fighting in the tragedy of  Maheegun and the owls. His profit, if  any, was in a greater caution.  And his chief interest was in the  fact that Maheegun and the two owls  had not devoured the young  bull. His supper was still safe. 
  With his little round eyes on the alert for fresh trouble he kept   himself safely hidden while he watched Miki investigating the  scene  of battle. From the body of the owl Miki went to Ahtik, and  from Ahtik  he sniffed slowly over the trail which Maheegun had  taken into the  bush. In the edge of the cover he found Mispoon. He  did not go  farther, but returned to Neewa, who by this time had  made up his mind  that he could safely come out into the open. 
  Fifty times that day Miki rushed to the defense of their meat. The   big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying. Next to them  the  Canada jays were most persistent. Twice a little gray-coated  ermine,  with eyes as red as garnets, came in to get his fill of  blood. Miki  was at him so fiercely that he did not return a third  time. By noon  the crows had got scent or sight of the carcass and  were circling  overhead, waiting for Neewa and Miki to disappear.  Later, they set up  a raucous protest from the tops of the trees in  the edge of the  forest. 
  That night the wolves did not return to the dip. Meat was too   plentiful, and those that were over their gorge were off on a  fresh  kill far to the west. Once or twice Neewa and Miki heard  their distant  cry. 
  Again through a star-filled radiant night they watched and   listened, and slept at times. In the soft gray dawn they went  forth  once more to their feast. 
  And here is where Makoki, the old Cree runner, would have   emphasized the presence of the Beneficent Spirit. For day followed   day, and night followed night, and Ahtik's flesh and blood put  into  Neewa and Miki a strength and growth that developed  marvellously. By  the fourth day Neewa had become so fat and sleek  that he was half  again as big as on the day he fell out of the  canoe. Miki had begun to  fill out. His ribs could no longer be  counted from a distance. His  chest was broadening and his legs  were losing some of their angular  clumsiness. Practice on Ahtik's  bones had strengthened his jaws. With  his development he felt less  and less the old puppyish desire to  play&#8212;more and more the  restlessness of the hunter. The fourth night  he heard again the  wailing hunt-cry of the wolves, and it held a wild  and thrilling  note for him. 
  With Neewa, fat and good humour and contentment were all   synonymous. As long as the meat held out there was no very great   temptation for him beyond the dip and the slope. Two or three  times a  day he went down to the creek; and every morning and   afternoon&#8212;especially about sunset&#8212;he had his fun rolling  downhill.  In addition to this he began taking his afternoon naps  in the crotch  of a small sapling. As Miki could see neither sense  nor sport in  tobogganing, and as he could not climb a tree, he  began to spend more  and more time in venturing up and down the  foot of the ridge. He  wanted Neewa to go with him on these  expeditions. He never set out  until he had entreated Neewa to come  down out of his tree, or until he  had made an effort to coax him  away from the single trail he had made  to the creek and back.  Neewa's obstinacy would never have brought  about any real  unpleasantness between them. Miki thought too much of  him for  that; and if it had come to a final test, and Neewa had  thought  that Miki would not return, he would undoubtedly have followed   him. 
  It was another and a more potent thing than an ordinary quarrel   that placed the first great barrier between them. Now it happened   that Miki was of the breed which preferred its meat fresh, while   Neewa liked his &quot;well hung.&quot; And from the fourth day onward, what  was  left of Ahtik's carcass was ripening. On the fifth day Miki  found the  flesh difficult to eat; on the sixth, impossible. To  Neewa it became  increasingly delectable as the flavour grew and  the perfume thickened.  On the sixth day, in sheer delight, he  rolled in it. That night, for  the first time, Miki could not sleep  with him. 
  The seventh day brought the climax. Ahtik now fairly smelled to   heaven. The odour of him drifted up and away on the soft June wind   until all the crows in the country were gathering. It drove Miki,   slinking like a whipped cur, down into the creek bottom. When  Neewa  came down for a drink after his morning feast Miki sniffed  him over  for a moment and then slunk away from him again. As a  matter of fact,  there was small difference between Ahtik and Neewa  now, except that  one lay still and the other moved. Both smelled  dead; both were  decidedly &quot;well hung.&quot; Even the crows circled over  Neewa, wondering  why it was that he walked about like a living  thing. 
  That night Miki slept alone under a clump of bush in the creek   bottom. He was hungry and lonely, and for the first time in many  days  he felt the bigness and emptiness of the world. He wanted  Neewa. He  whined for him in the starry silence of the long hours  between sunset  and dawn. The sun was well up before Neewa came  down the hill. He had  finished his breakfast and his morning roll,  and he was worse than  ever. Again Miki tried to coax him away but  Neewa was disgustingly  fixed in his determination to remain in his  present glory. And this  morning he was more than usually anxious  to return to the dip. All of  yesterday he had found it necessary  to frighten the crows away from  his meat, and to-day they were  doubly persistent in their efforts to  rob him. With a grunt and a  squeal to Miki he hustled back up the hill  after he had taken his  drink. 
  His trail entered the dip through the pile of rocks from which   Miki and he had watched the battle between Maheegun and the two  owls,  and as a matter of caution he always paused for a few  moments among  these rocks to make sure that all was well in the  open. This morning  he received a decided shock. Ahtik's carcass  was literally black with  crows. Kakakew and his Ethiopic horde of  scavengers had descended in a  cloud, and they were tearing and  fighting and beating their wings  about Ahtik as if all of them had  gone mad. Another cloud was hovering  in air; every bush and near-  by sapling was bending under the weight  of them, and in the sun  their jet-black plumage glistened as if they  had just come out of  the bath of a tinker's pot. Neewa stood  astounded. He was not  frightened; he had driven the cowardly robbers  away many times.  But never had there been so many of them. He could  see no trace of  his meat. Even the ground about it was black. 
  He rushed out from the rocks with his lips drawn back, just as he   had rushed a dozen or more times before. There was a mighty roar  of  wings. The air was darkened by them, and the ravenish screaming  that  followed could have been heard a mile away. This time Kakakew  and his  mighty crew did not fly back to the forest. Their number  gave them  courage. The taste of Ahtik's flesh and the flavour of  it in their  nostrils intoxicated them, to the point of madness,  with desire. Neewa  was dazed. Over him, behind him, on all sides  of him they swept and  circled, croaking and screaming at him, the  boldest of them swooping  down to beat at him with their wings.  Thicker grew the menacing cloud,  and then suddenly it descended  like an avalanche. It covered Ahtik  again. In it Neewa was fairly  smothered. He felt himself buried under  a mass of wings and  bodies, and he began fighting, as he had fought  the owls. A score  of pincer-like black beaks fought to get at his hair  and hide;  others stabbed at his eyes; he felt his ears being pulled  from his  head, and the end of his nose was a bloody cushion within a  dozen  seconds. The breath was beaten out of him; he was blinded, and   dazed, and every square inch of him was aquiver with its own   excruciating pain. He forgot Ahtik. The one thing in the world he   wanted most was a large open space in which to run. 
  Putting all his strength into the effort he struggled to his feet   and charged through the mass of living things about him. At this  sign  of defeat many of the crows left him to join in the feast. By  the time  he was half way to the cover into which Maheegun had gone  all but one  had left him. That one may have been Kakakew himself.  He had fastened  himself like a rat-trap to Neewa's stubby tail,  and there he hung on  like grim death while Neewa ran. He kept his  hold until his victim was  well into the cover. Then he flopped  himself into the air and rejoined  his brethren at the putrified  carcass of the bull. 
  If ever Neewa had wanted Miki he wanted him now. Again his entire   viewpoint of the world was changed. He was stabbed in a hundred   places. He burned as if afire. Even the bottoms of his feet hurt  him  when he stepped on them, and for half an hour he hid himself  under a  bush, licking his wounds and sniffing the air for Miki. 
  Then he went down the slope into the creek bottom, and hurried to   the foot of the trail he had made to and from the dip. Vainly he   quested about him for his comrade. He grunted and squealed, and  tried  to catch the scent of him in the air. He ran up the creek a  distance,  and back again. Ahtik counted as nothing now. 
  Miki was gone.
