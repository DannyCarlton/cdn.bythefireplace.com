  The night was admirably suited to their purpose&#8212;otherwise they  would not have dared to leave Fort Refuge&#8212;and Willet, Tayoga and  Robert alone undertook the task. Wilton, Carson and others were anxious  to go, but, as an enterprise of such great danger required surpassing  skill, the three promptly ruled them out. The hunter and young Lennox  would have disguised themselves as Indians, but as they did not have  any paint in the fort they were compelled to go forth in their own  garb.
  The cold had softened greatly, and, as heavy clouds had come with  it, there was promise of snow, which in truth the three hoped would  fall, since it would be an admirable cloak for their purpose. But in  any event theirs was to be a perilous path, and Colden shook hands with  the three as they lowered themselves softly from the palisade.
  &#8220;Come back,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;If you find the task too dangerous let  it go and return at once. We need you here in the fort.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll come back as victors,&#8221; Robert replied with confidence. Then  he and his comrades crouched, close against the palisade and listened.  The Indian fires showed dimly in the heavy dusk, and they knew that  sentinels were on watch in the woods, but still keeping in the shadow  of the palisade they went to the far side, where the Indian line was  thinner. Then they dropped to hand and knee and crept toward the  forest.
  They stopped at intervals, lying flat upon the ground, looking with  all their eyes and listening with all their ears. They saw ahead but  one fire, apparently about four hundred yards away, and they heard only  a light damp wind rustling the dry boughs and bushes. But they knew  they could not afford to relax their caution by a hair, and they  continued a slow creeping progress until they reached the woods. Then  they rested on their elbows in a thicket, and took long breaths of  relief. They had been a quarter of an hour in crossing the open and it  was an immense relief to sit up again. They kept very close together,  while their muscles recovered elasticity, and still used their eyes and  ears to the utmost. It was impossible to say that a warrior was not  near crouching in the thicket as they were, and they did not intend to  run any useless risk. Moreover, if the alarm were raised now, they  would escape into the fort, and await another chance.
  But they neither heard nor saw a hostile presence. In truth, they  saw nothing that betokened a siege, save the dim light flickering  several hundred yards ahead of them, and they resumed their advance,  bent so low that they could drop flat at the first menace. Their eyes  looked continually for a sentinel, but they saw none.
  &#8220;Don't you think the wind is rising a bit, Tayoga?&#8221; whispered the  hunter.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the Onondaga.
  &#8220;And it feels damper to the face?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, Great Bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;And it doesn't mean rain, because the air's too cold, but it does  mean snow, for which the air is just right, and I think it's coming, as  the clouds grow thicker and thicker all the time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which proves that we are favored. Tododaho from his great and  shining star, that we cannot see tonight, looks down upon us and will  help us, since we have tried to do the things that are right. We wish  the snow to come, because we wish a veil about us, while we confound  our enemies, and Tododaho will send it.&#8221;
  He spoke devoutly and Robert admired and respected his faith, the  center of which was Manitou, and Manitou in the mind of the Christian  boy was the same as God. He also shared the faith of Tayoga that  Tododaho would wrap the snow like a white robe about them to hide them  from their enemies. Meanwhile the three crept slowly toward the fire,  and Robert felt something damp brush his face. It was the first flake  of snow, and Tododaho, on his shining star, was keeping his unspoken  promise.
  Tayoga looked up toward the point in the heavens where the great  chief's star shone on clear nights, and, even in the dark, Robert saw  the spiritual exaltation on his face. The Onondaga never doubted for an  instant. The mighty chief who had gone away four centuries ago had  answered the prayer made to him by one of his loyal children, and was  sending the snow that it might be a veil before them while they  destroyed the camp of their enemies. The soul of Tayoga leaped up. They  had received a sign. They were in the care of Tododaho and they could  not fail.
  Another flake fell on Robert's face and a third followed, and then  they came down in a white and gentle stream that soon covered him,  Willet and Tayoga and hung like a curtain before them. He looked back  toward the fort, but the veil there also hung between and he could not  see it. Then he looked again, and the dim fire had disappeared in the  white mist.
  &#8220;Will it keep their huts and lodges from burning?&#8221; he whispered to  the hunter.
  Willet shook his head.
  &#8220;If we get a fire started well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the snow will seem to  feed it rather than put it out. It's going to help us in more ways than  one, too. I'd expected that we'd have to use flint and steel to touch  off our blaze, but as they're likely to leave their own fire and seek  shelter, maybe we can get a torch there. Now, you two boys keep close  to me and we'll approach that fire, or the place where it was.&#8221;
  They continued a cautious advance, their moccasins making no sound  in the soft snow, all objects invisible at a distance of twelve or  fifteen feet. Yet they saw one Indian warrior on watch, although he did  not see or hear them. He was under the boughs of a small tree and was  crouched against the trunk, protecting himself as well as he could from  the tumbling flakes. He was a Huron, a capable warrior with his five  senses developed well, and in normal times he was ambitious and eager  for distinction in his wilderness world, but just now he did not dream  that any one from the fort could be near. So the three passed him,  unsuspected, and drew close to the fire, which now showed as a white  glow through the dusk, sufficient proof that it was still burning.  Further progress proved that the warriors had abandoned it for shelter,  and they left the next task to Tayoga.
  The Onondaga lay down in the snow and crept forward until he reached  the fire, where he paused and waited two or three minutes to see that  his presence was not detected. Then he took three burning sticks and  passed them back swiftly to his comrades. Willet had already discerned  the outline of a bark hut on his right and Robert had made out another  on his left. Just beyond were skin tepees. They must now act quickly,  and each went upon his chosen way.
  Robert approached the hut on the left from the rear, and applied the  torch to the wall which was made of dry and seasoned bark. Despite the  snow, it ignited at once and burned with extraordinary speed. The roar  of flames from the right showed that the hunter had done as well, and a  light flash among the skin tepees was proof that Tayoga was not behind  them.
  The besieging force was taken completely by surprise. The three had  imitated to perfection the classic example of Scipio's soldiers in the  Carthaginian camp. The confusion was terrible as French and Indians  rushed for their lives from the burning huts and lodges into the  blinding snow, where they saw little, and, for the present, understood  less. Tayoga who, in the white dusk readily passed for one of their  own, slipped here and there, continually setting new fires, traveling  in a circle about the fort, while Robert and Willet kept near him, but  on the inner side of the circle and well behind the veil of snow.
  The huts and lodges burned fiercely. Where they stood thickest each  became a lofty pyramid of fire and then blended into a mighty mass of  flames, forming an intense red core in the white cloud of falling snow.  French soldiers and Indian warriors ran about, seeking to save their  arms, ammunition and stores, but they were not always successful.  Several explosions showed that the flames had reached powder, and  Robert laughed to himself in pleasure. The destruction of their powder  was a better result than he had hoped or foreseen.
  The hunter uttered a low whistle and Tayoga throwing down his torch,  at once joined him and Robert who had already cast theirs far from  them.
  &#8220;Back to the fort!&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;We've already done 'em damage they  can't repair in a long time, and maybe we've broken up their camp for  the winter! What a godsend the snow was!&#8221;
  &#8220;It was Tododaho who sent it,&#8221; said Tayoga, reverently. &#8220;They almost  make a red ring around our fort. We have succeeded because the mighty  chief, the founder of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, who went  away to his star four centuries ago, willed for us to succeed. How  splendidly the fires burn! Not a hut, not a lodge will be left!&#8221;
  &#8220;And it's time for us to be going,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;Men like De  Courcelles, Jumonville and Tandakora will soon bring order out of all  that tumult, and they'll be looking for those who set the torch. The  snow is coming down heavier and heavier and it hides our flight,  although it is not able to put out the fires. You're right, Tayoga,  about Tododaho pouring his favor upon us.&#8221;
  It was easy for the three to regain the palisade, and they were not  afraid of mistaken bullets fired at them for enemies, since Colden and  Wilton had warned the soldiers that they might expect the return of the  three. Tododaho continued to watch over, them as they reached the  palisade, at the point where the young Philadelphia captain himself  stood upon the raised plank behind it.
  &#8220;Captain Colden! Captain Colden!&#8221; called Willet through the white  cloud.
  &#8220;Is it you, Mr. Willet?&#8221; exclaimed Colden. &#8220;Thank God you've come.  I've been in great fear for you! I knew that you had set the fires,  because my own eyes tell me so, but I didn't know what had become of  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm here, safe and well.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Mr. Lennox?&#8221;
  &#8220;Here, unhurt, too,&#8221; replied Robert.
  &#8220;And the Onondaga?&#8221;
  &#8220;All right and rejoicing that we have done even more than we hoped  to do,&#8221; said Tayoga, in his measured and scholastic English.
  The three, coated with snow until they looked like white bears,  quickly scaled the wall, and received the joyous welcome, given to  those who have done a great deed, and who return unhurt to their  comrades. Colden, Wilton and Carson shook their hands again and again  and Robert knew that it was due as much to pleasure at the return as at  the destruction of the besieging camp.
  The entire population of Fort Refuge was at the palisade, heedless  of the snow, watching the burning huts and lodges. There was no wind,  but cinders and ashes fell near them, to be covered quickly with white.  Fierce yells now came from the forest and arrows and bullets were fired  at the fort, but they were harmless and the defenders did not reply.
  The flames began to decline by and by, then they sank fast, and  after a while the snow which still came down as if it meant never to  stop covered everything. The circling white wall enveloped the  stronghold completely, and Robert knew that the disaster to the French  and Indians had been overwhelming. Probably all of them had saved their  lives, but they had lost ammunition&#8212;the explosions had told him  that&#8212;much of their stores, and doubtless all of their food. They would  have to withdraw, for the present at least.
  Robert felt immense exultation. They had struck a great blow, and it  was he who had suggested the plan. His pride increased, although he hid  it, when Willet put his large hand on his shoulder and said:
  &#8220;'Twas well done, Robert, my lad, and 'twould not have been done at  all had it not been for you. Your mind bred the idea, from which the  action flowed.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you think the French and Indians have gone away now?&#8221;
  &#8220;Surely, lad! Surely! Indians can stand a lot, and so can French,  but neither can stand still in the middle of a snow that bids fair to  be two feet deep and live. They may have to travel until they reach  some Indian village farther west and north.&#8221;
  &#8220;Such being the case, there can be no pressing need for me just at  present, and I think I shall sleep. I feel now as if I were bound to  relax.&#8221;
  &#8220;The best thing you could do, and I'll take a turn between the  blankets myself.&#8221;
  Robert had a great sleep. Some of the rooms in the blockhouse  offered a high degree of frontier comfort, and he lay down upon a soft  couch of skins. A fine fire blazing upon a stone hearth dried his  deerskin garments, and, when he awoke about noon, he was strong and  thoroughly refreshed. The snow was still falling heavily. The  wilderness in its white blanket was beautiful, but it did not look like  a possible home to Robert now. His vivid imagination leaped up at once  and pictured the difficulties of any one struggling for life, even in  that vast white silence.
  Willet and Tayoga were up before him, and they were talking of  another expedition to see how far the besieging force had gone, but  while they were discussing it a figure appeared at the edge of the  forest.
  &#8220;It's a white man,&#8221; exclaimed Wilton, &#8220;and so it must be one of the  Frenchmen. He's a bold fellow walking directly within our range. What  on earth can he want?&#8221;
  One of the guards on the palisade raised his rifle, but Willet  promptly pushed down the muzzle.
  &#8220;That's no Frenchman,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Then who is it?&#8221; asked Wilton.
  &#8220;He's clothed in white, as any one walking in this snow is bound to  be, but I could tell at the first glimpse that it was none other than  our friend, Black Rifle.&#8221;
  &#8220;Coming to us for refuge, and so our fort is well named.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not for refuge. Black Rifle has taken care of himself too long in  the wilderness to be at a loss at any time. I suspect that he has  something of importance to tell us or he would not come at all.&#8221;
  At the command of Colden the great gate was thrown open that the  strange rover might enter in all honor, and as he came in, apparently  oblivious of the storm, his eyes gleamed a little at the sight of  Willet, his friend.
  &#8220;You've come to tell us something,&#8221; said the hunter.
  &#8220;So I have,&#8221; said Black Rifle.
  &#8220;Brush off the snow, warm yourself by the fire, and then we'll  listen.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can tell it now. I don't mind the snow. I saw from a distance the  great fire last night, when the camp of the French and Indians burned.  It was clever to destroy their huts and lodges, and I knew at once who  did it. Such a thing as that could not have happened without you having  a hand in it, Dave Willet. I watched to see what the French and Indians  would do, and I followed them in their hurried retreat into the north.  I hid in the snowy bushes, and heard some of their talk, too. They will  not stop until they reach a village a full hundred miles from here. The  Frenchmen, De Courcelles and Jumonville are mad with anger and  disappointment, and so is the Indian chief Tandakora.&#8221;
  &#8220;And well they may be!&#8221; jubilantly exclaimed Captain Colden, off  whose mind a great weight seemed to have slid. &#8220;It was splendid tactics  to burn their home over their heads. I wouldn't have thought of it  myself, but since others have thought of it, and, it has succeeded so  admirably, we can now do the work we were sent here to do.&#8221;
  Tayoga and Willet made snow-shoes and went out on them a few days  later, confirming the report of Black Rifle. Then small parties were  sent forth to search the forest for settlers and their families. Robert  had a large share in this work, and sometimes he looked upon terrible  things. In more than one place, torch and tomahawk had already done  their dreadful work, but in others they found the people alive and  well, still clinging to their homes. It was often difficult, even in  the face of imminent danger, to persuade them to leave, and when they  finally went, under mild compulsion, it was with the resolve to return  to their log cabins in the spring.
  Fort Refuge now deserved its name. There were many axes, with plenty  of strong and skillful arms to wield them, and new buildings were  erected within the palisade, the smoke rising from a half dozen  chimneys. They were rude structures, but the people who occupied them,  used all their lives to hardships, did not ask much, and they seemed  snug and comfortable enough to them. Fires always blazed on the broad  stone hearths and the voices of children were heard within the log  walls. The hands of women furnished the rooms, and made new clothes of  deerskin.
  The note of life at Fort Refuge was comfort and good cheer. They  felt that they could hold the little fortress against any force that  might come. The hunters, Willet, Tayoga and Black Rifle at their head,  brought in an abundance of game. There was no ill health. The little  children grew mightily, and, thus thrown together in a group, they had  the happiest time they had ever known. Robert was their hero. No other  could tell such glorious tales. He had read fairy stories at Albany,  and he not only brought them all from the store of his memory but he  embroidered and enlarged them. He had a manner with him, too. His  musical, golden voice, his vivid eyes and his intense earnestness of  tone, the same that had impressed so greatly the fifty sachems in the  vale of Onondaga, carried conviction. If one telling a tale believed in  it so thoroughly himself then those who heard it must believe in it  too.
  Robert fulfilled a great mission. He was not the orator, the golden  mouthed, for nothing. If the winter came down a little too fiercely,  his vivid eyes and gay voice were sufficient to lift the depression.  Even the somber face of Black Rifle would light up when he came near.  Nor was the young Quaker, Wilton, far behind him. He was a  spontaneously happy youth, always bubbling with good nature, and he  formed an able second for Lennox.
  &#8220;Will,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;I believe it actually gives you joy to be here  in this log fortress in the snow and wilderness. You do not miss the  great capital, Philadelphia, to which you have been used all your  life.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I don't, Robert. I like Fort Refuge, because I'm free from  restraints. It's the first time my true nature has had a chance to come  out, and I'm making the most of the opportunity. Oh, I'm developing! In  the spring you'll see me the gayest and most reckless blade that ever  came into the forest.&#8221;
  The deep snow lasted a long time. More snowshoes were made, but only  six or eight of the soldiers learned to use them well. There were  sufficient, however, as Willet, Robert, Tayoga and Black Rifle were  already adepts, and they ranged the forest far in all directions. They  saw no further sign of French or Indians, but they steadily increased  their supply of game.
  Christmas came, January passed and then the big snow began to melt.  New stirrings entered Robert's mind. He felt that their work at Fort  Refuge was done. They had gathered into it all the outlying settlers  who could be reached, and Colden, Wilton and Carson were now entirely  competent to guard it and hold it. Robert felt that he and Willet  should return to Albany, and get into the main current of the great  war. Tayoga, of course, would go with them.
  He talked it over with Willet and Tayoga, and they agreed with him  at once. Black Rifle also decided to depart about the same time, and  Colden, although grieved to see them go, could say nothing against it.  When the four left they received an ovation that would have warmed the  heart of any man. As they stood at the edge of the forest with their  packs on their backs, Captain Colden gave a sharp command. Sixty rifles  turned their muzzles upward, and sixty fingers pulled sixty triggers.  Sixty weapons roared as one, and the four with dew in their eyes,  lifted their caps to the splendid salute. Then a long, shrill cheer  followed. Every child in the fort had been lifted above the palisade,  and they sent the best wishes of their hearts with those who were  going.
  &#8220;That cheer of the little ones was mostly for you, Robert,&#8221; said  Willet, when the forest hid them.
  &#8220;It was for all of us equally,&#8221; said Robert modestly.
  &#8220;No, I'm right and it must help us to have the good wishes of little  children go with us. If they and Tododaho watch over us we can't come  to much harm.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a good omen,&#8221; said Tayoga soberly. &#8220;When I lie down to sleep  tonight I shall hear their voices in my ear.&#8221;
  Black Rifle now left them, going on one of his solitary expeditions  into the wilderness and the others traveled diligently all the day, but  owing to the condition of the earth did not make their usual progress.  Most of the snow had melted and everything was dripping with water. It  fell from every bough and twig, and in every ravine and gully a rivulet  was running, while ponds stood in every depression. Many swollen brooks  and creeks had to be forded, and when night came they were wet and  soaked to the waist.
  But Tayoga then achieved a great triumph. In the face of  difficulties that seemed insuperable, he coaxed a fire in the lee of a  hill, and the three fed it, until it threw out a great circle of heat  in which they warmed and dried themselves. When they had eaten and  rested a long time they put out the fire, waited for the coals and  ashes to cool, and then spread over them their blankets, thus securing  a dry base upon which to sleep. They were so thoroughly exhausted, and  they were so sure that the forest contained no hostile presence that  all three went to sleep at the same time and remained buried in slumber  throughout the night.
  Tayoga was the first to awake, and he saw the dawn of a new winter  day, the earth reeking with cold damp and the thawing snow. He unrolled  himself from his blankets and arose a little stiffly, but with a few  movements of the limbs all his flexibility returned. The air was chill  and the scene in the black forest of winter was desolate, but Tayoga  was happy. Tododaho on his great shining star had watched over him and  showered him with favors, and he had no doubt that he would remain  under the protection of the mighty chief who had gone away so long ago.
  Tayoga looked down at his comrades, who still slept soundly, and  smiled. The three were bound together by powerful ties, and the events  of recent months had made them stronger than ever. In the school at  Albany he had absorbed much of the white man's education, and, while  his Indian nature remained unchanged, he understood also the white  point of view. He could meet both Robert and Willet on common ground,  and theirs was a friendship that could not be severed.
  Now he made a circle about their camp, and, being assured that no  enemy was near, came back to the point where Robert and Willet yet  slept. Then he took his flint and steel, and, withdrawing a little,  kindled a fire, doing so as quietly as he could, in order that the two  awaking might have a pleasant surprise. When the little flames were  licking the wood, and the sparks began to fly upwards, he shook Robert  by the shoulder.
  &#8220;Arise, sluggard,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Did not our teacher in Albany tell us  it was proof of a lazy nature to sleep while the sun was rising? The  fire even has grown impatient and has lighted itself while you abode  with Tarenyawagon (the sender of dreams). Get up and cook our  breakfast, Oh, Heavy Head!&#8221;
  Robert sat up and so did Willet. Then Robert drew his blankets about  his body and lay down again.
  &#8220;You've done so well with the fire, Tayoga, and you've shown such a  spirit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that it would be a pity to interfere with your  activity. Go ahead, and awake me again when breakfast is ready.&#8221;
  Tayoga made a rush, seized the edge of his blanket and unrolled it,  depositing Robert in the ashes. Then he darted away among the bushes,  avoiding the white youth's pursuit. Willet meanwhile warmed himself by  the fire and laughed.
  &#8220;Come back, you two,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You think you're little lads again  at your school in Albany, but you're not. You're here in the  wilderness, confronted by many difficulties, all of which you can  overcome, and subject to many perils, all of which you know how to  avoid.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll come,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;if you promise to protect me from this  fierce Onondaga chief who is trying to secure my scalp.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, return to the fire and cook these strips of venison. Here  is the sharp stick left from last night. Robert, take our canteens,  find a spring and fill them with fresh water. By right of seniority I'm  in command this morning, and I intend to subject my army to extremely  severe discipline, because it's good for it. Obey at once!&#8221;
  Tayoga obediently took the sharpened stick and began to fry strips  of venison. Robert, the canteens over his shoulder, found a spring near  by and refilled them. Like Tayoga, the raw chill of the morning and the  desolate forest of winter had no effect upon him. He too, was happy,  uplifted, and he sang to himself the song he had heard De Galissonniere  sing:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Hier sur le pont d'Avignon <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J'ai oui chanter la belle, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon, la, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;J'ai oui chanter la belle, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Elle chantait d'un ton si doux <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comme une demoiselle, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lon, la, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comme une demoiselle.&#8221;
  All that seemed far away now, yet the words of the song brought it  back, and his extraordinary imagination made the scenes at Bigot's ball  pass before his eyes again, almost as vivid as reality. Once more he  saw the Intendant, his portly figure swaying in the dance, his red face  beaming, and once more he beheld the fiery duel in the garden when the  hunter dealt with Boucher, the bully and bravo.
  Quebec was far away. He had been glad to go to it, and he had been  glad to come away, too. He would be glad to go to it again, and he felt  that he would do so some day, though the torrent of battle now rolled  between. He was still humming the air when he came back to the fire,  and saluting Willet politely, tendered a canteen each to him and  Tayoga.
  &#8220;Sir David Willet, baronet and general,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have the honor  to report to you that in accordance with your command I have found the  water, spring water, fine, fresh, pure, as good as any the northern  wilderness can furnish, and that is the best in the world. Shall I  tender it to you, sir, on my bended knee!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, Mr. Lennox, we can dispense with the bended knee, but I am  glad, young sir, to note in your voice the tone of deep respect for  your elders which sometimes and sadly is lacking.&#8221;
  &#8220;If Dagaeoga works well, and always does as he is bidden,&#8221; said  Tayoga, &#8220;perhaps I'll let him look on at the ceremonies when I take my  place as one of the fifteen sachems of the Onondaga nation.&#8221;
  While they ate their venison and some bread they had also brought  with them, they discussed the next stage of their journey, and Tayoga  made a suggestion. Traveling would remain difficult for several days,  and instead of going directly to Albany, their original purpose, they  might take a canoe, and visit Mount Johnson, the seat of Colonel  William Johnson, who was such a power with the Hodenosaunee, and who  was in his person a center of important affairs in North America. For a  while, Mount Johnson might, in truth, suit their purpose better than  Albany.
  The idea appealed at once to both Robert and Willet. Colonel  Johnson, more than any one else could tell them what to do, and owing  to his strong alliance, marital and otherwise, with the Mohawks, they  were likely to find chiefs of the Ganeagaono at his house or in the  neighborhood.
  &#8220;It is agreed,&#8221; said Willet, after a brief discussion. &#8220;If my  calculations be correct we can reach Mount Johnson in four days, and I  don't think we're likely to cross the trail of an enemy, unless St. Luc  is making some daring expedition.&#8221;
  &#8220;In any event, he's a nobler foe than De Courcelles or Jumonville,&#8221;  said Robert.
  &#8220;I grant you that, readily,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;Still, I don't think  we're likely to encounter him on our way to Mount Johnson.&#8221;
  But on the second day they did cross a trail which they attributed  to a hostile force. It contained, however, no white footsteps, and not  pausing to investigate, they continued their course toward their  destination. As all the snow was now gone, and the earth was drying  fast, they were able almost to double their speed and they pressed  forward, eager to see the celebrated Colonel William Johnson, who was  now filling and who was destined to fill for so long a time so large a  place in the affairs of North America.
