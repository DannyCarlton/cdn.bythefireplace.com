  He did not turn toward Marie-Anne when he had lighted the first of   the great brass lamps hanging at the side of the bateau. He went  to  the second, and struck another match, and flooded the cabin  with  light. 
  She still stood silhouetted against the darkness beyond the cabin   door when he faced her. She was watching him, her eyes intent, her   face a little pale, he thought. Then he smiled and nodded. He  could  not see a great change in her since this afternoon, except  that there  seemed to be a little more fire in the glow of her  eyes. They were  looking at him steadily as she smiled and nodded,  wide, beautiful eyes  in which there was surely no revelation of  shame or regret, and no  very clear evidence of unhappiness. David  stared, and his tongue clove  to the roof of his mouth. 
  &quot;Why is it that you sit in darkness?&quot; she asked, stepping within   and closing the door. &quot;Did you not expect me to return and  apologize  for leaving you so suddenly this afternoon? It was  impolite. Afterward  I was ashamed. But I was excited, M'sieu  David. I&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Of course,&quot; he hurried to interrupt her. &quot;I understand. St.   Pierre is a lucky man. I congratulate you&#8212;as well as him. He is   splendid, a man in whom you can place great faith and confidence.&quot; 
  &quot;He scolded me for running away from you as I did, M'sieu David.   He said I should have shown better courtesy than to leave like  that  one who was a guest in our&#8212;home. So I have returned, like a  good  child, to make amends.&quot; 
  &quot;It was not necessary.&quot; 
  &quot;But you were lonesome and in darkness!&quot; 
  He nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;And besides,&quot; she added, so quietly and calmly that he was   amazed, &quot;you know my sleeping apartment is also on the bateau. And   St. Pierre made me promise to say good night to you.&quot; 
  &quot;It is an imposition,&quot; cried David, the blood rushing to his face.   &quot;You have given up all this to me! Why not let me go into that  little  room forward, or sleep on the raft and you and St. Pierre&#8212;  &quot; 
  &quot;St. Pierre would not leave the raft,&quot; replied Marie-Anne, turning   from him toward the table on which were the books and magazines  and  her work-basket. &quot;And I like my little room forward.&quot; 
  &quot;St. Pierre&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped himself. He could see a sudden color deepening in the   cheek of St. Pierre's wife as she made pretense of looking for   something in her basket. He felt that if he went on he would  blunder,  if he had not already blundered. He was uncomfortable,  for he believed  he had guessed the truth. It was not quite  reasonable to expect that  Marie-Anne would come to him like this  on the first night of St.  Pierre's homecoming. Something had  happened over in the little cabin  on the raft, he told himself.  Perhaps there had been a quarrel&#8212;at  least ironical implications  on St. Pierre's part. And his sympathy was  with St. Pierre. 
  He caught suddenly a little tremble at the corner of Marie-Anne's   mouth as her face was turned partly from him, and he stepped to  the  opposite side of the table so he could look at her fairly. If  there  had been unpleasantness in the cabin on the raft, St.  Pierre's wife in  no way gave evidence of it. The color had  deepened to almost a blush  in her cheeks, but it was not on  account of embarrassment, for one who  is embarrassed is not  usually amused, and as she looked up at him her  eyes were filled  with the flash of laughter which he had caught her  lips struggling  to restrain. Then, finding a bit of lace work with the  needles  meshed in it, she seated herself, and again he was looking  down on  the droop of her long lashes and the seductive glow of her   lustrous hair. Yesterday, in a moment of irresistible impulse, he  had  told her how lovely it was as she had dressed it, a bewitching  crown  of interwoven coils, not drawn tightly, but crumpled and  soft, as if  the mass of tresses were openly rebelling at closer  confinement. She  had told him the effect was entirely accidental,  largely due to  carelessness and haste in dressing it. Accidental  or otherwise, it was  the same tonight, and in the heart of it were  the drooping red petals  of a flower she had gathered with him  early that afternoon. 
  &quot;St. Pierre brought me over,&quot; she said in a calmly matter-of-fact   voice, as though she had expected David to know that from the   beginning. &quot;He is ashore talking over important matters with  Bateese.  I am sure he will drop in and say good night before he  returns to the  raft. He asked me to wait for him&#8212;here.&quot; She  raised her eyes, so  clear and untroubled, so quietly unembarrassed  under his gaze, that he  would have staked his life she had no  suspicion of the confessions  which St. Pierre had revealed to him. 
  &quot;Do you care? Would you rather put out the lights and go to bed?&quot; 
  He shook his head. &quot;No. I am glad. I was beastly lonesome. I had   an idea&#8212;&quot; 
  He was on the point of blundering again when he caught himself.   The effect of her so near him was more than ever disturbing, in  spite  of St. Pierre. Her eyes, clear and steady, yet soft as  velvet when  they looked at him, made his tongue and his thoughts  dangerously  uncertain. 
  &quot;You had an idea, M'sieu David?&quot; 
  &quot;That you would have no desire to see me again after my talk with   St. Pierre,&quot; he said. &quot;Did he tell you about it?&quot; 
  &quot;He said you were very fine, M'sieu David&#8212;and that he liked you.&quot; 
  &quot;And he told you it is determined that I shall fight Bateese in   the morning?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  The one word was spoken with a quiet lack of excitement, even of   interest&#8212;it seemed to belie some of the things St. Pierre had  told  him, and he could scarcely believe, looking at her now, that  she had  entreated her husband to prevent the encounter, or that  she had  betrayed any unusual emotion in the matter at all. 
  &quot;I was afraid you would object,&quot; he could not keep from saying.   &quot;It does not seem nice to pull off such a thing as that, when  there  is a lady about&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Or LADIES.&quot; She caught him up quickly, and he saw a sudden little   tightening of her pretty mouth as she turned her eyes to the bit  of  lace work again. &quot;But I do not object, because what St. Pierre  says is  right&#8212;must be right.&quot; 
  And the softness, he thought, went altogether out of the curve of   her lips for an instant. In a flash their momentary betrayal of   vexation was gone, and St. Pierre's wife had replaced the work-   basket on the table and was on her feet, smiling at him. There was   something of wild daring in her eyes, something that made him  think  of the glory of adventure he had seen flaming in her face  the night  they had run the rapids of the Holy Ghost. 
  &quot;Tomorrow will be very unpleasant, M'sieu David,&quot; she cried   softly. &quot;Bateese will beat you&#8212;terribly. Tonight we must think of   things more agreeable.&quot; 
  He had never seen her more radiant than when she turned toward the   piano. What the deuce did it mean? Had St. Pierre been making a  fool  of him? She actually appeared unable to restrain her elation  at the  thought that Bateese would surely beat him up! He stood  without moving  and made no effort to answer her. Just before they  had started on that  thrilling adventure into the forest, which had  ended with his carrying  her in his arms, she had gone to the piano  and had played for him. Now  her fingers touched softly the same  notes. A little humming trill came  in her throat, and it seemed to  David that she was deliberately  recalling his thoughts to the  things that had happened before the  coming of St. Pierre. He had  not lighted the lamp over the piano, and  for a flash her dark eyes  smiled at him out of the half shadow. After  a moment she began to  sing. 
  Her voice was low and without effort, untrained, and subdued as if   conscious and afraid of its limitations, yet so exquisitely sweet   that to David it was a new and still more wonderful revelation of  St.  Pierre's wife. He drew nearer, until he stood close at her  side, the  dark luster of her hair almost touching his arm, her  partly upturned  face a bewitching profile in the shadows. 
  Her voice grew lower, almost a whisper in its melody, as if meant   for him alone. Many times he had heard the Canadian Boat Song, but   never as its words came now from the lips of Marie-Anne Boulain. 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Faintly as tolls the evening chime, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voices keep tune, and our oars keep time. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon as the woods on shore look dim, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll sing at St. Ann's our parting hymn; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapids are near, and the daylight's past.&quot; 
  She paused. And David, staring down at her shining head, did not   speak. Her fingers trembled over the keys, he could see dimly the   shadow of her long lashes, and the spirit-like scent of crushed   violets rose to him from the soft lace about her throat and her  hair. 
  &quot;It is your music,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I have never heard the Boat   Song like that!&quot; 
  He tried to drag his eyes from her face and hair, sensing that he   was a near-criminal, fighting a mighty impulse. The notes under  her  fingers changed, and again&#8212;by chance or design&#8212;she was  stabbing at  him; bringing him face to face with the weakness of  his flesh, the  iniquity of his desire to reach out his arms and  crumple her in them.  Yet she did not look up, she did not see him,  as she began to sing  &quot;Ave Maria.&quot; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ave, Maria, hear my cry! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, guide my path where no harm, no harm is nigh&#8212;&quot; 
  As she went on, he knew she had forgotten to think of him. With   the reverence of a prayer the holy words came from her lips,  slowly,  softly, trembling with a pathos and sweetness that told  David they  came not alone from the lips, but from the very soul of  St, Pierre's  wife. And then&#8212; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Mother, hear me where thou art, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guard and guide my aching heart, my aching heart!&quot; 
  The last words drifted away into a whisper, and David was glad   that he was not looking into the face of St. Pierre's wife, for  there  must have been something there now which it would have been  sacrilege  for him to stare at, as he was staring at her hair. 
  No sound of opening door had come from behind them. Yet St. Pierre   had opened it and stood there, watching them with a curious humor  in  eyes that seemed still to hold a glitter of the fire that had  leaped  from the half-breed's flaming birch logs. His voice was a  shock to  Carrigan. 
  &quot;PESTE, but you are a gloomy pair!&quot; he boomed. &quot;Why no light over   there in the corner, and why sing that death-song to chase away  the  devil when there is no devil near?&quot; 
  Guilt was in David's heart, but there was no sting of venom in St.   Pierre's words, and he was laughing at them now, as though what he   saw were a pretty joke and amused him. 
  &quot;Late hours and shady bowers! I say it should be a love song or   something livelier,&quot; he cried, closing the door behind him and  coming  toward them. &quot;Why not En Roulant ma Boule, my sweet Jeanne?  You know  that is my favorite.&quot; 
  He suddenly interrupted himself, and his voice rolled out in a   wild chant that rocked the cabin. 
  &nbsp;&quot;The wind is fresh, the wind is free, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;En roulant ma boule! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is fresh&#8212;my love waits me, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Rouli, roulant, ma boule roulant! <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Behind our house a spring you see, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;In it three ducks swim merrily, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;And hunting, the Prince's son went he, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;With a silver gun right fair to see&#8212;&quot; 
  David was conscious that St. Pierre's wife had risen to her feet,   and now she came out of shadow into light, and he was amazed to  see  that she was laughing back at St. Pierre, and that her two   fore-fingers were thrust in her ears to keep out the bellow of her   husband's voice. She was not at all discomfited by his unexpected   appearance, but rather seemed to join in the humor of the thing  with  St. Pierre, though he fancied he could see something in her  face that  was forced and uneasy. He believed that under the  surface of her  composure she was suffering a distress which she  did not reveal. 
  St. Pierre advanced and carelessly patted her shoulder with one of   his big hands, while he spoke to David. 
  &quot;Has she not the sweetest voice in the world, m'sieu? Did you ever   hear a sweeter or as sweet? I say it is enough to get down into  the  soul of a man, unless he is already half dead! That voice&#8212;&quot; 
  He caught Marie-Anne's eyes. Her cheeks were flaming. Her look,   for an instant, flashed lightning as she halted him. 
  &quot;Ma foi, I speak it from the heart,&quot; he persisted, with a shrug of   his shoulders. &quot;Am I not right, M'sieu Carrigan? Did you ever hear  a  sweeter voice?&quot; 
  &quot;It is wonderful,&quot; agreed David, wondering if he was hazarding too   much. 
  &quot;Good! It fills me with happiness to know I am right. And now,   cherie, good-night! I must return to the raft.&quot; 
  A shadow of vexation crossed Marie-Anne's face. &quot;You seem in great   haste.&quot; 
  &quot;Plagues and pests! You are right, Pretty Voice! I am most anxious   to get back to my troubles there, and you&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Will also bid M'sieu Carrigan good-night,&quot; she quickly   interrupted him. &quot;You will at least see me to my room, St. Pierre,   and safely put away for the night.&quot; 
  She held out her hand to David. There was not a tremor in it as it   lay for an instant soft and warm in his own. She made no effort to   withdraw it quickly, nor did her eyes hide their softness as they   looked into his own. 
  Mutely David stood as they went out. He heard St. Pierre's loud   voice rumbling about the darkness of the night. He heard them pass   along the side of the bateau forward, and half a minute later he  knew  that St. Pierre was getting into his canoe. The dip of a  paddle came  to him. 
  For a space there was silence, and then, from far out in the black   shadow of the river, rolled back the great voice of St. Pierre   Boulain singing the wild river chant, &quot;En Roulant ma Boule.&quot; 
  At the open window he listened. It seemed to him that from far   over the river, where the giant raft lay, there came a faint  answer  to the words of the song,
