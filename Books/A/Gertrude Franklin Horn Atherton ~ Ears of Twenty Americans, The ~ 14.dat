That was a gay Christmas at Monterey, despite the barricades in the  street. News had come of the defeat of Kearney at San Pasqual, and the  Monterenos, inflated with hope and pride, gave little thought to the  fact that his forces were now joined with Stockton's at San Diego.    
On Christmas eve light streamed from every window, bonfires flared on  the hills; the streets were illuminated, and every one was abroad. The  clear warm night was ablaze with fireworks; men and women were in their  gala gowns; rockets shot upward amidst shrieks of delight which mingled  oddly with the rolling of drums at muster; even the children caught the  enthusiasm, religious and patriotic.    
"I suppose you would be glad to see even your friends driven out," said  Brotherton to Dona Eustaquia, as they walked through the brilliant town  toward the church: bells called them to witness the dramatic play of  "The Shepherds."    
"I be glad to see the impertinent flag come down," said she, frankly;  "but you can make resignation from the army, and have a little store on  Alvarado Street. You can have beautiful silks and crepes from America. I  buy of you."    
"Thanks," he said grimly. "You would put a dunce cap on poor America,  and stand her in a corner. If I resign, Dona Eustaquia, it will be to  become a ranchero, not a shopkeeper. To tell the truth, I have little  desire to leave California again."    
"But you were make for the fight," she said, looking up with some pride  at the tall military figure, the erect head and strong features. "You  not were make to lie in the hammock and horseback all day."    
"But I should do a good deal else, senora. I should raise cattle with  some method; and I should have a library--and a wife."    
"Ah! you go to marry?"    
"Some day, I hope. It would be lonely to be a ranchero without a wife."    
"Truly."    
"What is the matter with those women?"    
A group of old women stood by the roadside. Their forms were bent, their  brown faces gnarled like apples. Some were a shapeless mass of fat,  others were parchment and bone; about the head and shoulders of each was  a thick black shawl. Near them stood a number of young girls clad in  muslin petticoats, flowered with purple and scarlet. Bright satin shoes  were on their feet, cotton rebosas covered their pretty, pert little  heads. All were looking in one direction, whispering and crossing  themselves.    
Dona Eustaquia glanced over her shoulder, then leaned heavily on  Brotherton's arm.    
"It is Benicia," she said. "It is because she was cursed and is with  child that they cross themselves."    
Brotherton held her arm closely and laid his hand on hers, but he spoke  sternly.    
"The curse is not likely to do her any harm. You prayed that she should  die when happiest, and you have done your best to make her wretched."    
She did not reply, and they walked slowly onward. Benicia followed,  leaning on the arm of an Indian servant. Her friends avoided her, for  they bitterly resented Altimira's death. But she gave them little  regret. Since her husband could not be with her on this Christmas eve,  she wished only for reconciliation with her mother. In spite of the  crowd she followed close behind Dona Eustaquia and Brotherton, holding  her head proudly, but ready to fall at the feet of the woman she  worshipped.    
"My friend," said Dona Eustaquia, after a moment, "perhaps it is best  that I do not forgive her. Were she happy, then might the curse come  true."    
"She has enough else to make her unhappy. Besides, who ever heard of  a curse coming true? It has worked its will already for the matter of  that. You kept your child from happiness with her husband during the  brief time she had him. The bitterness of death is a small matter beside  the bitterness of life. You should be satisfied."    
"You are hard, my friend."    
"I see your other faults only to respect and love them."    
"Does she look ill, Captain?"    
"She cannot be expected to look like the old Benicia. Of course she  looks ill, and needs care."    
"Look over the shoulder. Does she walk heavily?"    
"Very. But as haughtily as do you."    
"Talk of other things for a little while, my friend."    
"Truly there is much to claim the interest to-night. This may be an old  scene to you, but it is novel and fascinating to me. How lovely are  those stately girls, half hidden by their rebosas, telling their beads  as they hurry along. It is the very coquetry of religion. And those--But  here we are."    
The church was handsomer without than within, for the clever old  padres that built it had more taste than their successors. About the  whitewashed walls of the interior were poor copies of celebrated  paintings--the Passion of Christ, and an extraordinary group of nude  women and grinning men representing the temptation of St. Anthony. In a  glass case a beautiful figure of the Saviour reclined on a stiff couch  clumsily covered with costly stuffs. The Virgin was dressed much like  the aristocratic ladies of Monterey, and the altar was a rainbow of  tawdry colours.    
But the ceremonies were interesting, and Brotherton forgot Benicia for  the hour. After the mass the priest held out a small waxen image of the  infant Jesus, and all approached and kissed it. Then from without came  the sound of a guitar; the worshippers arose and ranged themselves  against the wall; six girls dressed as shepherdesses; a man representing  Lucifer; two others, a hermit and the lazy vagabond Bartola; a boy, the  archangel Gabriel, entered the church. They bore banners and marched  to the centre of the building, then acted their drama with religious  fervour.    
The play began with the announcement by Gabriel of the birth of the  Saviour, and exhortations to repair to the manger. On the road came  the temptation of Lucifer; the archangel appeared once more; a violent  altercation ensued in which all took part, and finally the prince of  darkness was routed. Songs and fanciful by-play, brief sermons, music,  gay and solemn, diversified the strange performance. When all was over,  the players were followed by an admiring crowd to the entertainment  awaiting them.    
"Is it not beautiful--our Los Pastores?" demanded Dona Eustaquia,  looking up at Brotherton, her fine face aglow with enthusiasm. "Do not  you feel the desire to be a Catholic, my friend?"    
"Rather would I see two good Catholics united, dear senora," and he  turned suddenly to Benicia, who also had remained in the church, almost  at her mother's side.    
"Mamacita!" cried Benicia.    
Dona Eustaquia opened her arms and caught the girl passionately to her  heart; and Brotherton left the church.
