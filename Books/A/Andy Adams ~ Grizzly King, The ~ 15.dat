  In his hiding-place Muskwa heard the last sounds of the battle on  the ledge. The crevice was a V-shaped crack in the rock, and he had  wedged himself as far back in this as he could. He saw Thor pass the  opening of his refuge after he had killed the fourth dog; he heard the  click, click, click of his claws as he retreated up the trail; and at  last he knew that the grizzly was gone, and that the enemy had followed  him.
  Still he was afraid to come out. These strange pursuers that had  come up out of the valley had filled him with a deadly terror.  Pipoonaskoos had not made him afraid. Even the big black bear that Thor  killed had not terrified him as these red-lipped, white-fanged  strangers had frightened him. So he remained in his crevice, crowded as  far back as he could get, like a wad shoved in a gun-barrel.
  He could still hear the tongueing of the dogs when other and nearer  sounds alarmed him. Langdon and Bruce came rushing around the bulge in  the mountain wall, and at sight of the dead dogs they stopped. Langdon  cried out in horror.
  He was not more than twenty feet from Muskwa. For the first time the  cub heard human voices; for the first time the sweaty odour of men  filled his nostrils, and he scarcely breathed in his new fear. Then one  of the hunters stood directly in front of the crack in which he was  hidden, and he saw his first man. A moment later the men, too, were  gone.
  Later Muskwa heard the shots. After that the barking of the dogs  grew more and more distant until finally he could not hear them at all.  It was about three o'clock&#8212;the siesta hour in the mountains, and it  was very quiet.
  For a long time Muskwa did not move. He listened. And he heard  nothing. Another fear was growing in him now&#8212;the fear of losing Thor.  With every breath he drew he was hoping that Thor would return. For an  hour he remained wedged in the rock. Then he heard a<I> cheep, cheep,  cheep</I>, and a tiny striped rock-rabbit came out on the ledge where  Muskwa could see him and began cautiously investigating one of the  slain Airedales. This gave Muskwa courage. He pricked up his ears a  bit. He whimpered softly, as if beseeching recognition and friendship  of the one tiny creature that was near him in this dreadful hour of  loneliness and fear.
  Inch by inch he crawled out of his hiding-place. At last his little  round, furry head was out, and he looked about him. The trail was  clear, and he advanced toward the rock-rabbit. With a shrill chatter  the striped mite darted for its own stronghold, and Muskwa was alone  again.
  For a few moments he stood undecided, sniffing the air that was  heavy with the scent of blood, of man, and of Thor; then he turned up  the mountain.
  He knew Thor had gone in that direction, and if little Muskwa  possessed a mind and a soul they were filled with but one desire  now&#8212;to overtake his big friend and protector. Even fear of dogs and  men, unknown quantities in his life until to-day, was now overshadowed  by the fear that he had lost Thor.
  He did not need eyes to follow the trail. It was warm under his  nose, and he started in the zigzag ascent of the mountain as fast as he  could go. There were places where progress was difficult for his short  legs, but he kept on valiantly and hopefully, encouraged by Thor's  fresh scent.
  It took him a good hour to reach the beginning of the naked shale  that reached up to the belt of snow and the sky-line, and it was four  o'clock when he started up those last three hundred yards between him  and the mountain-top. Up there he believed he would find Thor. But he  was afraid, and he continued to whimper softly to himself as he dug his  little claws bravely into the shale.
  Muskwa did not look up to the crest of the peak again after he had  started. To have done that it would have been necessary for him to stop  and turn sidewise, for the ascent was steep. And so, when Muskwa was  halfway to the top, it happened that he did not see Langdon and Bruce  as they came over the sky-line; and he could not smell them, for the  wind was blowing up instead of down. Oblivious of their presence he  came to the snow-belt. Joyously he smelled of Thor's huge footprints,  and followed them. And above him Bruce and Langdon waited, crouched  low, their guns on the ground, and each with his thick flannel shirt  stripped off and held ready in his hands. When Muskwa was less than  twenty yards from them they came tearing down upon him like an  avalanche.
  Not until Bruce was upon him did Muskwa recover himself sufficiently  to move. He saw and realized danger in the last fifth of a second, and  as Bruce flung himself forward, his shirt outspread like a net, Muskwa  darted to one side. Sprawling on his face, Bruce gathered up a shirtful  of snow and clutched it to his breast, believing for a moment that he  had the cub, and at this same instant Langdon made a drive that  entangled him with his friend's long legs and sent him turning  somersaults down the snow-slide.
  Muskwa bolted down the mountain as fast as his short legs could  carry him. In another second Bruce was after him, and Langdon joined in  ten feet behind.
  Suddenly Muskwa made a sharp turn, and the momentum with which Bruce  was coming carried him thirty or forty feet below him, where the lanky  mountaineer stopped himself only by doubling up like a jack-knife and  digging toes, hands, elbows, and even his shoulders in the soft shale.
  Langdon had switched, and was hot after Muskwa. He flung himself  face downward, shirt outspread, just as the cub made another turn, and  when he rose to his feet his face was scratched and he spat half a  handful of dirt and shale out of his mouth.
  Unfortunately for Muskwa his second turn brought him straight down  to Bruce, and before he could turn again he was enveloped in sudden  darkness and suffocation, and over him there rang out a fiendish and  triumphant yell.
  &#8220;I got 'im!&#8221; shouted Bruce.
  Inside the shirt Muskwa scratched and bit and snarled, and Bruce was  having his hands full when Langdon ran down with the second shirt. Very  shortly Muskwa was trussed up like a papoose. His legs and his body  were swathed so tightly that he could not move them. His head was not  covered. It was the only part of him that showed, and the only part of  him that he could move, and it looked so round and frightened and funny  that for a minute or two Langdon and Bruce forgot their disappointments  and losses of the day and laughed.
  Then Langdon sat down on one side of Muskwa, and Bruce on the other,  and they filled and lighted their pipes. Muskwa could not even kick an  objection.
  &#8220;A couple of husky hunters we are,&#8221; said Langdon then. &#8220;Come out for  a grizzly and end up with that!&#8221;
  He looked at the cub. Muskwa was eying him so earnestly that Langdon  sat in mute wonder for a moment, and then slowly took his pipe from his  mouth and stretched out a hand.
  &#8220;Cubby, cubby, nice cubby,&#8221; he cajoled softly.
  Muskwa's tiny ears were perked forward. His bright eyes were like  glass. Bruce, unobserved by Langdon, was grinning expectantly.
  &#8220;Cubby won't bite&#8212;no&#8212;no&#8212;nice little cubby&#8212;we won't hurt cubby&#8212;&#8221;
  The next instant a wild yell startled the mountain-tops as Muskwa's  needle-like teeth sank into one of Langdon's fingers. Bruce's howls of  joy would have frightened game a mile away.
  &#8220;You little devil!&#8221; gasped Langdon, and then, as he sucked his  wounded finger, he laughed with Bruce. &#8220;He's a sport&#8212;a dead game  sport,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We'll call him Spitfire, Bruce. By George, I've  wanted a cub like that ever since I first came into the mountains. I'm  going to take him home with me! Ain't he a funny looking little cuss?&#8221;
  Muskwa shifted his head, the only part of him that was not as  stiffly immovable as a mummy, and scrutinized Bruce. Langdon rose to  his feet and looked back to the sky-line. His face was set and hard.
  &#8220;Four dogs!&#8221; he said, as if speaking to himself. &#8220;Three down  below&#8212;and one up there!&#8221; He was silent for a moment, and then said: &#8220;I  can't understand it, Bruce. They've cornered fifty bears for us, and  until to-day we've never lost a dog.&#8221;
  Bruce was looping a buckskin thong about Muskwa's middle, making of  it a sort of handle by which he could carry the cub as he would have  conveyed a pail of water or a slab of bacon. He stood up, and Muskwa  dangled at the end of his string.
  &#8220;We've run up against a killer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;An' a meat-killin'  grizzly is the worst animal on the face of the earth when it comes to a  fight or a hunt. The dogs'll never hold 'im, Jimmy, an' if it don't get  dark pretty soon there won't none of the bunch come back. They'll quit  at dark&#8212;if there's any left. The old fellow's got our wind, an' you  can bet he knows what knocked him down up there on the snow. He's  hikin'&#8212;an' hikin' fast. When we see 'im ag'in it'll be twenty miles  from here.&#8221;
  Langdon went up for the guns. When he returned Bruce led the way  down the mountain, carrying Muskwa by the buckskin thong. For a few  moments they paused on the blood-stained ledge of rock where Thor had  wreaked his vengeance upon his tormentors. Langdon bent over the dog  the grizzly had decapitated.
  &#8220;This is Biscuits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we always thought she was the one  coward of the bunch. The other two are Jane and Tober; old Fritz is up  on the summit. Three of the best dogs we had, Bruce!&#8221;
  Bruce was looking over the ledge. He pointed downward.
  &#8220;There's another&#8212;pitched clean off the face o' the mount'in!&#8221; he  gasped. &#8220;Jimmy, that's five!&#8221;
  Langdon's fists were clenched tightly as he stared over the edge of  the precipice. A choking sound came from his throat. Bruce understood  its meaning. From where they stood they could see a black patch on the  upturned breast of the dog a hundred feet under them. Only one of the  pack was marked like that. It was Langdon's favourite. He had made her  a camp pet.
  &#8220;It's Dixie,&#8221; he said. For the first time he felt a surge of anger  sweep through him, and his face was white as he turned back to the  trail. &#8220;I've got more than one reason for getting that grizzly now,  Bruce,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Wild horses can't tear me away from these mountains  until I kill him. I'll stick until winter if I have to. I swear I'm  going to kill him&#8212;if he doesn't run away.&#8221;
  &#8220;He won't do that,&#8221; said Bruce tersely, as he once more swung down  the trail with Muskwa.
  Until now Muskwa had been stunned into submissiveness by what must  have appeared to him to be an utterly hopeless situation. He had  strained every muscle in his body to move a leg or a paw, but he was  swathed as tightly as Rameses had ever been. But now, however, it  slowly dawned upon him that as he dangled back and forth his face  frequently brushed his enemy's leg, and he still had the use of his  teeth. He watched his opportunity, and this came when Bruce took a long  step down from a rock, thus allowing Muskwa's body to rest for the  fraction of a second on the surface of the stone from which he was  descending.
  Quicker than a wink Muskwa took a bite. It was a good deep bite, and  if Langdon's howl had stirred the silences a mile away the yell which  now came from Bruce beat him by at least a half. It was the wildest,  most blood-curdling sound Muskwa had ever heard, even more terrible  than the barking of the dogs, and it frightened him so that he released  his hold at once.
  Then, again, he was amazed. These queer bipeds made no effort to  retaliate. The one he had bitten hopped up and down on one foot in a  most unaccountable manner for a minute or so, while the other sat down  on a boulder and rocked back and forth, with his hands on his stomach,  and made a queer, uproarious noise with his mouth wide open. Then the  other stopped his hopping and also made that queer noise.
  It was anything but laughter to Muskwa. But it impinged upon him the  truth of one of two things: either these grotesque looking monsters did  not dare to fight him, or they were very peaceful and had no intention  of harming him. But they were more cautious thereafter, and as soon as  they reached the valley they carried him between them, strung on a  rifle-barrel.
  It was almost dark when they approached a clump of balsams red with  the glow of a fire. It was Muskwa's first fire. Also he saw his first  horses, terrific looking monsters even larger than Thor.
  A third man&#8212;Metoosin, the Indian&#8212;came out to meet the hunters, and  into this creature's hands Muskwa found himself transferred. He was  laid on his side with the glare of the fire in his eyes, and while one  of his captors held him by both ears, and so tightly that it hurt,  another fastened a hobble-strap around his neck for a collar. A heavy  halter rope was then tied to the ring on this strap, and the end of the  rope was fastened to a tree.
  During these operations Muskwa snarled and snapped as much as he  could. In another half-minute he was free of the shirts, and as he  staggered on four wobbly legs, from which all power of flight had  temporarily gone, he bared his tiny fangs and snarled as fiercely as he  could.
  To his further amazement this had no effect upon his strange company  at all, except that the three of them&#8212;even the Indian&#8212;opened their  mouths and joined in that loud and incomprehensible din, to which one  of them had given voice when he sank his teeth into his captor's leg on  the mountainside. It was all tremendously puzzling to Muskwa.
