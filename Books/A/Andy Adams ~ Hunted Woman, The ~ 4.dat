  To John Aldous Joanne's appearance at this moment was like an  anti-climax. It plunged him headlong for a single moment into what he  believed to be the absurdity of a situation. He had a quick mental  picture of himself out on the dead spruce, performing a bit of  mock-heroism by dragging in a half-drowned colt by one ear. In another  instant this had passed, and he was wondering why Joanne Gray was not  on her way to Tete Jaune.
  &#8220;It was splendid!&#8221; she was saying again, her eyes glowing at him. &#8220;I  know men who would not have risked that for a human!&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps they would have been showing good judgment,&#8221; replied  Aldous.
  He noticed now that she was holding with one hand the end of a long  slender sapling which a week or two before he had cut and trimmed for a  fish-pole. He nodded toward it, a half-cynical smile on his lips.
  &#8220;Were you going to fish me out&#8212;or the colt?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;You,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I thought you were in danger.&#8221; And then she  added, &#8220;I suppose you are deeply grateful that fate did not compel you  to be saved by a woman.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not at all. If the spruce had snapped, I would have caught at the  end of your sapling like any drowning rat&#8212;or man. Allow me to thank  you.&#8221;
  She had stepped down to the level strip of sand on which the colt  was weakly struggling to rise to its feet. She was breathing quickly.  Her face was still pale. She was without a hat, and as she bent for a  moment over the colt Aldous felt his eyes drawn irresistibly to the  soft thick coils of her hair, a glory of colour that made him think of  the lustrous brown of a ripe wintelberry. She looked up suddenly and  caught his eyes upon her.
  &#8220;I came quite by accident,&#8221; she explained quickly. &#8220;I wanted to be  alone, and Mrs. Otto said this path would lead to the river. When I saw  you I was about to turn back. And then I saw the other&#8212;the horses  coming down the stream. It was terrible. Are they all drowned?&#8221;
  &#8220;All that you saw. It wasn't a pretty sight, was it?&#8221; There was a  suggestive inquiry in his voice as he added, &#8220;If you had gone to Tete  Jaune you would have missed the unpleasantness of the spectacle.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would have gone, but something happened. They say it was a  cave-in, a slide&#8212;something like that. The train cannot go on until  to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you are to stay with the Ottos?&#8221;
  She nodded.
  Quick as a flash she had seemed to read his thoughts.
  &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she added, before he could speak. &#8220;I can see that I  have annoyed you. I have literally projected myself into your work, and  I am afraid that I have caused you trouble. Mrs. Otto has told me of  this man they call Quade. She says he is dangerous. And I have made him  your enemy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am, not afraid of Quade. The incident was nothing more than an  agreeable interruption to what was becoming a rather monotonous  existence up here. I have always believed, you know, that a certain  amount of physical excitement is good oil for our mental machinery.  That, perhaps, was why you caught me hauling at His Coltship's ear.&#8221;
  He had spoken stiffly. There was a hard note in his voice, a  suggestion of something that was displeasing in his forced laugh. He  knew that in these moments he was fighting against his inner  self&#8212;against his desire to tell her how glad he was that something had  held back the Tete Jaune train, and how wonderful her hair looked in  the afternoon sun. He was struggling to keep himself behind the  barriers he had built up and so long maintained in his writings. And  yet, as he looked, he felt something crumbling into ruins. He knew that  he had hurt her. The hardness of his words, the coldness of his smile,  his apparently utter indifference to her had sent something that was  almost like a quick, physical pain into her eyes. He drew a step  nearer, so that he caught the soft contour of her cheek. Joanne Gray  heard him, and lowered her head slightly, so that he could not see. She  was a moment too late. On her cheek Aldous saw a single creeping  drop&#8212;a tear.
  In an instant he was at her side. With a quick movement she brushed  the tear away before she faced him.
  &#8220;I've hurt you,&#8221; he said, looking her straight in the eyes. &#8220;I've  hurt you, and God knows I'm a brute for doing it. I've treated you as  badly as Quade&#8212;only in a different way. I know how I've made you  feel&#8212;that you've been a nuisance, and have got me into trouble, and  that I don't want to have anything more to do with you. Have I made you  feel that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid&#8212;you have.&#8221;
  He reached out a hand, and almost involuntarily her own came to it.  She saw the change in his face, regret, pain, and then that  slow-coming, wonderful laughter in his eyes.
  &#8220;That's just how I set out to make you feel,&#8221; he confessed, the  warmth of her hand sending a thrill through him. &#8220;I might as well be  frank, don't you think? Until you came I had but one desire, and that  was to finish my book. I had planned great work for to-day. And you  spoiled it. I couldn't get you out of my mind. And it made me&#8212;ugly.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that was&#8212;all?&#8221; she whispered, a tense waiting in her eyes.  &#8220;You didn't think&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What Quade thought,&#8221; he bit in sharply. The grip of his fingers  hurt her hand. &#8220;No, not that. My God, I didn't make you think<I> that?</I> &#8220;
  &#8220;I'm a stranger&#8212;and they say women don't go to Tete Jaune alone,&#8221;  she answered doubtfully.
  &#8220;That's true, they don't&#8212;not as a general rule. Especially women  like you. You're alone, a stranger, and too beautiful. I don't say that  to flatter you. You are beautiful, and you undoubtedly know it. To let  you go on alone and unprotected among three or four thousand men like  most of those up there would be a crime. And the women, too&#8212;the Little  Sisters. They'd blast you. If you had a husband, a brother or a father  waiting for you it would be different. But you've told me you haven't.  You have made me change my mind about my book. You are of more interest  to me just now than that. Will you believe me? Will you let me be a  friend, if you need a friend?&#8221;
  To Aldous it seemed that she drew herself up a little proudly. For a  moment she seemed taller. A rose-flush of colour spread over her  cheeks. She drew her hand from him. And yet, as she looked at him, he  could see that she was glad.
  &#8220;Yes, I believe you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I must not accept your offer of  friendship. You have done more for me now than I can ever repay.  Friendship means service, and to serve me would spoil your plans, for  you are in great haste to complete your book.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you mean that you need my assistance, the book can wait.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shouldn't have said that,&#8221; she cut in quickly, her lips  tightening slightly. &#8220;It was utterly absurd of me to hint that I might  require assistance&#8212;that I cannot take care of myself. But I shall be  proud of the friendship of John Aldous.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, you can take care of yourself, Ladygray,&#8221; said Aldous softly,  looking into her eyes and yet speaking as if to himself. &#8220;That is why  you have broken so curiously into my life. It's<I> that</I>&#8212;and not  your beauty. I have known beautiful women before. But they were&#8212;just  women, frail things that might snap under stress. I have always thought  there is only one woman in ten thousand who would not do that&#8212;under  certain conditions. I believe you are that one in ten thousand. You can  go on to Tete Jaune alone. You can go anywhere alone&#8212;and care for  yourself.&#8221;
  He was looking at her so strangely that she held her breath, her  lips parted, the flush in her cheeks deepening.
  &#8220;And the strangest part of it all is that I have always known you  away back in my imagination,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;You have lived there, and  have troubled me. I could not construct you perfectly. It is almost  inconceivable that you should have borne the same name&#8212;Joanne. Joanne,  of 'Fair Play.'&#8220;
  She gave a little gasp.
  &#8220;Joanne was&#8212;terrible,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;She was bad&#8212;bad to the heart  and soul of her!&#8221;
  &#8220;She was splendid,&#8221; replied Aldous, without a change in his quiet  voice. &#8220;She was splendid&#8212;but bad. I racked myself to find a soul for  her, and I failed. And yet she was splendid. It was my crime&#8212;not  hers&#8212;that she lacked a soul. She would have been my ideal, but I  spoiled her. And by spoiling her I sold half a million copies of the  book. I did not do it purposely. I would have given her a soul if I  could have found one. She went her way.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you compare me to&#8212;<I>her?</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aldous deliberately. &#8220;You are that Joanne. But you  possess what I could not give to her. Joanne of 'Fair Play' was  splendid without a soul. You have what she lacked. You may not  understand, but you have come to perfect what I only partly created.&#8221;
  The colour had slowly ebbed from Joanne's face. There was a  mysterious darkness in her eyes.
  &#8220;If you were not John Aldous I would&#8212;strike you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As it  is&#8212;yes&#8212;I want you as a friend.&#8221;
  She held out her hand. For a moment he felt its warmth again in his  own. He bowed over it. Her eyes rested steadily on his blond head, and  again she noted the sprinkle of premature gray in his hair. For a  second time she felt almost overwhelmingly the mysterious strength of  this man. Perhaps each took three breaths before John Aldous raised his  head. In that time something wonderful and complete passed between  them. Neither could have told the other what it was. When their eyes  met again, it was in their faces.
  &#8220;I have planned to have supper in my cabin to-night,&#8221; said Aldous,  breaking the tension of that first moment. &#8220;Won't you be my guest,  Ladygray?&#8221;
  &#8220;Mrs. Otto&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; she began.
  &#8220;I will go to her at once and explain that you are going to eat  partridges with me,&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;Come&#8212;let me show you into my  workshop and home.&#8221;
  He led her to the cabin and into its one big room.
  &#8220;You will make yourself at home while I am gone, won't you?&#8221; he  invited. &#8220;If it will give you any pleasure you may peel a few potatoes.  I won't be gone ten minutes.&#8221;
  Not waiting for any protest she might have, Aldous slipped back  through the door and took the path up to the Ottos'.
