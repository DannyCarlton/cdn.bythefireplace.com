  After working two hours at the woodpile, Herbert was called in to  tea.  There was no great variety, Abner Holden not being a bountiful  provider.  But the bread was sweet and good, and the gingerbread fresh.  Herbert's  two hours of labor had given him a hearty appetite, and he  made a good  meal. Mrs. Bickford looked on approvingly. She was glad to  see that our  hero enjoyed his supper. 
  There was tea on the table, and, after pouring out a cup for Mr.  Holden,  the housekeeper was about to pour out one for Herbert. 
  &quot;He don't want any tea,&quot; said Abner, noticing the action. &quot;Keep the  cup  for yourself, Mrs. Bickford.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean, Mr. Holden?&quot; asked the housekeeper, in surprise. 
  &quot;Tea isn't good for a growing boy. A glass of cold water will be  best  for him.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't agree with you, Mr. Holden,&quot; said the housekeeper,  decidedly.  &quot;Herbert has been hard at work, and needs his tea as much  as you or I  do.&quot; 
  Therefore, without waiting for his permission, she handed the cup  to  Herbert, who proceeded to taste it. 
  Abner Holden frowned, but neither Herbert nor the housekeeper took  much  notice of it. The latter was somewhat surprised at this new freak  on the  part of Abner, as he had never tried to deprive any of  Herbert's  predecessors of tea or coffee. But the fact was, Mr. Holden  disliked  Herbert, and was disposed to act the petty tyrant over him.  He had  neither forgotten nor forgiven the boy's spirited defiance when  they  first met, nor his refusal to surrender into his hands the five  dollars  which the doctor had given him. 
  Feeling tired by eight o'clock, Herbert went up to his garret room  and  undressed himself. An instinct of caution led him to take out the  money  in his porte-monnaie, and put it in his trunk, which he then  locked, and  put the key under the sheet, so that no one could get hold  of it without  awakening him. This precaution proved to be well taken. 
  Herbert lay down upon the bed, but did not immediately go to sleep.  He  could not help thinking of his new home, and the new circumstances  in  which he was placed. He did not feel very well contented, and felt   convinced from what he had already seen of Mr. Holden, that he should   never like him. Then thoughts of his mother, and of her constant and   tender love, and the kind face he would never more see on earth, swept   over him, and almost unmanned him. To have had her still alive he  would  have been content to live on dry bread and water. 
  He thought, too, of the doctor's family and their kindness. How   different it would have been if he might have continued to find a home   with them! But when he was tempted to repine, the thought of his   mother's Christian instructions came to him, and he was comforted by  the  reflection, that whatever happened to him was with the knowledge  of his  Father in heaven, who would not try him above his strength. 
  Try and trust! That was almost the last advice his mother had given  him,  as the surest way of winning the best success. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he thought, &quot;I will try and trust, and leave the rest with  God.&quot; 
  Meanwhile Mr. Holden had not been able to keep out of his head the  five  dollars which he knew Herbert possessed. He was a mean man, and  wished  to appropriate it to his own use. Besides this, he was a  stubborn man,  and our hero's resistance only made him the more  determined to triumph  over his opposition by fair means or foul. It  struck him that it would  be a good idea to take advantage of our  hero's slumber, and take the  money quietly from his pocketbook while  he was unconscious. 
  Accordingly, about eleven o'clock, he went softly up the attic  stairs  with a candle in his hand, and, with noiseless steps,  approached the  bed. Herbert's regular breathing assured him that he  was asleep. Abner  Holden took up his pants and felt for his  pocketbook. He found it, and  drew it out with exultation. 
  &quot;Aha!&quot; he thought; &quot;I've got it.&quot; 
  But this brief exultation was succeeded by quick disappointment.  The  pocketbook proved to be quite empty. 
  &quot;Curse it!&quot; muttered Abner, &quot;what has the boy done with his money?&quot; 
  It was at this moment that Herbert, his eyes possibly affected by  the  light, awoke, and he discovered his employer examining his  pocketbook. 
  His first feeling was indignation, but the sight of Abner Holden's   disappointed face amused him, and he determined not to reveal his   wakefulness, but to watch, him quietly. 
  &quot;Perhaps he's got two pocketbooks,&quot; thought Abner. But in this he  was  mistaken. 
  Next he went to Herbert's trunk, and tried it, but found it locked. 
  &quot;I wonder where he keeps the key,&quot; was his next thought. 
  He searched Herbert's pockets, but the search was in vain. 
  &quot;Plague take the young rascal!&quot; he muttered, loud enough for  Herbert to  hear. 
  Herbert turned in bed, and Abner Holden, fearing that he might wake  up,  and being on the whole, rather ashamed of his errand, and  unwilling to  be caught in it, went downstairs. 
  &quot;Well, he didn't make much,&quot; thought our hero. &quot;It's lucky I  thought to  put the money in my trunk. If he only knew I had fifteen  dollars,  instead of five, he would be all the more anxious to get hold  of it.&quot; 
  &quot;How did you sleep last night, Herbert?&quot; inquired the housekeeper  at  breakfast. 
  &quot;Very well, thank you, Mrs. Bickford.&quot; 
  He was resolved not to drop a hint of what had happened, being  curious  to see if Mr. Holden would make any further attempts to obtain  his  money. As his employer might possibly find a key that would unlock  the  trunk, he thought it prudent, during the day, to carry the money  about  with him. 
  He hardly knew whether to expect a visit from Abner the next night,  but  formed a little plan for frightening him if such a visit should  take  place. 
  It so happened that he had in his trunk a fish horn which had been  given  him by someone in Waverley. This he took out of the trunk before   retiring and hid it under his pillow. It was about nine o'clock when  he  went to bed, but by considerable effort he succeeded in keeping  awake  for an hour or two. 
  About eleven o'clock, Abner Holden, before going to bed himself,  decided  to make one more attempt to obtain possession of Herbert's  money. He  reflected that possibly our hero had only put away his money  by chance  on the previous evening, and might have neglected to do so  on the  present occasion. He desired to get possession of it before any  part of  it was spent, as, judging from what he knew of boys, it would  not remain  long unexpended. 
  Once more, therefore, he took his candle, and removing his  thick-soled  shoes, which might betray him by their sound, crept softly  up the steep  and narrow staircase. 
  But Herbert heard him, and moreover was warned of his visit by the  light  of the candle which he carried. He closed his eyes, and awaited  his  coming in silent expectation. 
  Abner Holden looked towards the bed. Herbert's eyes were closed,  and his  breathing was deep and regular. 
  &quot;He's sound asleep,&quot; thought Abner, with satisfaction. 
  He set down the candle on a chair beside the bed, and began to  examine  our hero's pocketbook once more. But it proved to be empty as  before. In  the pocketbook, however, he found a key, the key, as he  supposed, to  Herbert's trunk. It was not, however, being only a key  which Herbert had  picked up one day in the street, and kept. He had  put it in his pocket  with a view to mislead his employer. 
  That gentleman uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction when his   fingers closed upon the key, never doubting for a moment that it would   open the trunk. 
  Leaving the candle in its place, he rose from his recumbent  position,  threw the pants on the bed, and went round on the other  side, to try the  key. 
  He got down on his knees before the trunk, and had inserted the key  in  the lock, or rather had made an ineffectual attempt to do so, when   suddenly the candle was extinguished, and a horrible blast on the fish   horn resounded through the garret. 
  Now, Abner Holden was not a very courageous man. In fact, he was   inclined to superstition. He knew that he was engaged in a  dishonorable  attempt to rob a boy who was placed in his charge, and  there is an old  proverb that says &quot;conscience makes cowards of us  all.&quot; It must be  admitted that it was rather calculated to affect the  nerves to find  one's self suddenly in the dark, and at the same time  to hear such a  fearful noise proceeding from an unknown quarter. 
  Abner Holden jumped to his feet in dire dismay, and, without  stopping to  reflect on the probable cause of this startling  interruption, &quot;struck a  bee line&quot; for the staircase, and descended  quicker, probably, than he  had ever done before, narrowly escaping  tumbling the entire distance, in  his headlong haste. 
  Herbert had to stuff the bedclothes into his mouth to keep from  bursting  into a shout of laughter, which would have revealed his  agency in  producing the mysterious noise. 
  &quot;I thought I heard a frightful noise last night soon after I went  to  bed,&quot; said Mrs. Bickford, at the breakfast table. &quot;Didn't you hear   anything, Mr. Holden?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Abner, &quot;I heard nothing. You were probably dreaming.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I was. Didn't you hear anything, Herbert?&quot; 
  &quot;I sleep pretty sound,&quot; said Herbert, quietly. 
  Abner Holden watched him as he said this, and was evidently more   perplexed than ever. But that was the last visit he paid to the garret   at night.
