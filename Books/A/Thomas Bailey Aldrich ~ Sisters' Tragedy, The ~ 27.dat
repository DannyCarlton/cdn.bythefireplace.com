SCENE: A roadside in Arcady 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
Good sir, have you seen pass this way<br> A mischief straight from market-day?<br> You'd know her at a glance, I think;<br> Her eyes are blue, her lips are pink;<br> She has a way of looking back<br> Over her shoulder, and, alack!<br> Who gets that look one time, good sir,<br> Has naught to do but follow her. 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
I have not seen this maid, methinks,<br> Though she that passed had lips like pinks. 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
Or like two strawberries made one<br> By some sly trick of dew and sun. 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
A poet! 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
Nay, a simple swain<br> That tends his flock on yonder plain,<br> Naught else, I swear by book and bell.<br> But she that passed--you marked her well.<br> Was she not smooth as any be<br> That dwell herein in Arcady? 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
Her skin was as the satin bark<br> Of birches. 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
Light or dark? 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
Quite dark. 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
Then 'twas not she. 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
The peach's side<br> That's next the sun is not so dyed<br> As was her cheek. Her hair hung down<br> Like summer twilight falling brown;<br> And when the breeze swept by, I wist<br> Her face was in a sombre mist. 
<b>SHEPHERD.</b> 
No, that is not the maid I seek.<br> HER hair lies gold against the cheek;<br> Her yellow tresses take the morn<br> Like silken tassels of the corn.<br> And yet--brown locks are far from bad. 
<b>PILGRIM.</b> 
Now I bethink me, this one had<br> A figure like the willow-tree<br> Which, slight and supple, wondrously<br> Inclines to droop with pensive grace,<br> And still retains its proper place;<br> A foot so arched and very small<br> The marvel was she walked at all;<br> Her hand--in sooth I lack for words--<br> Her hand, five slender snow-white birds.<br> Her voice--though she but said "God-speed"--<br> Was melody blown through a reed;<br> The girl Pan changed into a pipe<br> Had not a note so full and ripe.<br> And then her eye--my lad, her eye!<br> Discreet, inviting, candid, shy,<br> An outward ice, an inward fire,<br> And lashes to the heart's desire--<br> Soft fringes blacker than the sloe. 
<b>SHEPHERD, THOUGHTFULLY.</b> 
Good sir, which way did THIS one go?<br> . . . . . . . . 
<b>PILGRIM, SOLUS.</b> 
So, he is off! The silly youth<br> Knoweth not Love in sober sooth.<br> He loves--thus lads at first are blind--<br> No woman, only Womankind.<br> I needs must laugh, for, by the Mass,<br> No maid at all did this way pass!
