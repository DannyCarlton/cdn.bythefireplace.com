  Alan slept soundly for several hours, but the long strain of the  preceding day did not make him overreach the time he had set for  himself, and he was up at six o'clock. Wegaruk had not forgotten her  old habits, and a tub filled with cold water was waiting for him. He  bathed, shaved himself, put on fresh clothes, and promptly at seven was  at breakfast. The table at which he ordinarily sat alone was in a  little room with double windows, through which, as he enjoyed his  meals, he could see most of the habitations of the range. Unlike the  average Eskimo dwellings they were neatly built of small timber brought  down from the mountains, and were arranged in orderly fashion like the  cottages of a village, strung out prettily on a single street. A sea of  flowers lay in front of them, and at the end of the row, built on a  little knoll that looked down into one of the watered hollows of the  tundra, was Sokwenna's cabin. Because Sokwenna was the &#8220;old man&#8221; of the  community and therefore the wisest&#8212;and because with him lived his  foster-daughters, Keok and Nawadlook, the loveliest of Alan's tribal  colony&#8212;Sokwenna's cabin was next to Alan's in size. And Alan, looking  at it now and then as he ate his breakfast, saw a thin spiral of smoke  rising from the chimney, but no other sign of life.
  The sun was already up almost to its highest point, a little more  than half-way between the horizon and the zenith, performing the  apparent miracle of rising in the north and traveling east instead of  west. Alan knew the men-folk of the village had departed hours ago for  the distant herds. Always, when the reindeer drifted into the higher  and cooler feeding-grounds of the foothills, there was this apparent  abandonment, and after last night's celebration the women and children  were not yet awake to the activities of the long day, where the rising  and setting of the sun meant so little.
  As he rose from the table, he glanced again toward Sokwenna's cabin.  A solitary figure had climbed up out of the ravine and stood against  the sun on the clough-top. Even at that distance, with the sun in his  eyes, he knew it was Mary Standish.
  He turned his back stoically to the window and lighted his pipe. For  half an hour after that he sorted out his papers and range-books in  preparation for the coming of Tautuk and Amuk Toolik, and when they  arrived, the minute hand of his watch was at the hour of eight.
  That the months of his absence had been prosperous ones he perceived  by the smiling eagerness in the brown faces of his companions as they  spread out the papers on which they had, in their own crude fashion,  set down a record of the winter's happenings. Tautuk's voice, slow and  very deliberate in its unfailing effort to master English without a  slip, had in it a subdued note of satisfaction and triumph, while Amuk  Toolik, who was quick and staccato in his manner of speech, using  sentences seldom of greater length than three or four words, and who  picked up slang and swear-words like a parrot, swelled with pride as he  lighted his pipe, and then rubbed his hands with a rasping sound that  always sent a chill up Alan's back.
  &#8220;A ver' fine and prosper' year,&#8221; said Tautuk in response to Alan's  first question as to general conditions. &#8220;We bean ver' fortunate.&#8221;
  &#8220;One hell-good year,&#8221; backed up Amuk Toolik with the quickness of a  gun. &#8220;Plenty calf. Good hoof. Moss. Little wolf. Herds fat. This  year&#8212;she peach!&#8221;
  After this opening of the matter in hand Alan buried himself in the  affairs of the range, and the old thrill, the glow which comes through  achievement, and the pioneer's pride in marking a new frontier with the  creative forces of success rose uppermost in him, and he forgot the  passing of time. A hundred questions he had to ask, and the tongues of  Tautuk and Amuk Toolik were crowded with the things they desired to  tell him. Their voices filled the room with a paean of triumph. His  herds had increased by a thousand head during the fawning months of  April and May, and interbreeding of the Asiatic stock with wild,  woodland caribou had produced a hundred calves of the super-animal  whose flesh was bound to fill the markets of the States within a few  years. Never had the moss been thicker under the winter snow; there had  been no destructive fires; soft-hoof had escaped them; breeding records  had been beaten, and dairying in the edge of the Arctic was no longer  an experiment, but an established fact, for Tautuk now had seven deer  giving a pint and a half of milk each twice a day, nearly as rich as  the best of cream from cattle, and more than twenty that were  delivering from a cupful to a pint at a milking. And to this Amuk  Toolik added the amazing record of their running-deer, Kauk, the  three-year-old, had drawn a sledge five miles over unbeaten snow in  thirteen minutes and forty-seven seconds; Kauk and Olo, in team, had  drawn the same sledge ten miles in twenty-six minutes and forty  seconds, and one day he had driven the two ninety-eight miles in a  mighty endurance test; and with Eno and Sutka, the first of their  inter-breed with the wild woodland caribou, and heavier beasts, he had  drawn a load of eight hundred pounds for three consecutive days at the  rate of forty miles a day. From Fairbanks, Tanana, and the ranges of  the Seward Peninsula agents of the swiftly spreading industry had  offered as high as a hundred and ten dollars a head for breeding stock  with the blood of the woodland caribou, and of these native and larger  caribou of the tundras and forests seven young bulls and nine female  calves had been captured and added to their own propagative forces.
  For Alan this was triumph. He saw nothing of what it all meant in  the way of ultimate personal fortune. It was the earth under his feet,  the vast expanse of unpeopled waste traduced and scorned in the  blindness of a hundred million people, which he saw fighting itself on  the glory and reward of the conqueror through such achievement as this;  a land betrayed rising at last out of the slime of political greed and  ignorance; a giant irresistible in its awakening, that was destined in  his lifetime to rock the destiny of a continent. It was Alaska rising  up slowly but inexorably out of its eternity of sleep, mountain-sealed  forces of a great land that was once the cradle of the earth coming  into possession of life and power again; and his own feeble efforts in  that long and fighting process of planting the seeds which meant its  ultimate ascendancy possessed in themselves their own reward.
  Long after Tautuk and Amuk Toolik had gone, his heart was filled  with the song of success.
  He was surprised at the swiftness with which time had gone, when he  looked at his watch. It was almost dinner hour when he had finished  with his papers and books and went outside. He heard Wegaruk's voice  coming from the dark mouth of the underground icebox dug into the  frozen subsoil of the tundra, and pausing at the glimmer of his old  housekeeper's candle, he turned aside, descended the few steps, and  entered quietly into the big, square chamber eight feet under the  surface, where the earth had remained steadfastly frozen for some  hundreds of thousands of years. Wegaruk had a habit of talking when  alone, but Alan thought it odd that she should be explaining to herself  that the tundra-soil, in spite of its almost tropical summer richness  and luxuriance, never thawed deeper than three or four feet, below  which point remained the icy cold placed there so long ago that &#8220;even  the spirits did not know.&#8221; He smiled when he heard Wegaruk measuring  time and faith in terms of &#8220;spirits,&#8221; which she had never quite given  up for the missionaries, and was about to make his presence known when  a voice interrupted him, so close at his side that the speaker,  concealed in the shadow of the wall, could have reached out a hand and  touched him.
  &#8220;Good morning, Mr. Holt!&#8221;
  It was Mary Standish, and he stared rather foolishly to make her out  in the gloom.
  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I was on my way to your place when  Wegaruk's voice brought me here. You see, even this icebox seems like a  friend after my experience in the States. Are you after a steak,  Mammy?&#8221; he called.
  Wegaruk's strong, squat figure turned as she answered him, and the  light from her candle, glowing brightly in a split tomato can, fell  clearly upon Mary Standish as the old woman waddled toward them. It was  as if a spotlight had been thrown upon the girl suddenly out of a pit  of darkness, and something about her, which was not her prettiness or  the beauty that was in her eyes and hair, sent a sudden and  unaccountable thrill through Alan. It remained with him when they drew  back out of gloom and chill into sunshine and warmth, leaving Wegaruk  to snuff her tomato-can lantern and follow with the steak, and it did  not leave him when they walked over the tundra together toward  Sokwenna's cabin. It was a puzzling thrill, stirring an emotion which  it was impossible for him to subdue or explain; something which he knew  he should understand but could not. And it seemed to him that knowledge  of this mystery was in the girl's face, glowing in a gentle  embarrassment, as she told him she had been expecting him, and that  Keok and Nawadlook had given up the cabin to them, so that he might  question her uninterrupted. But with this soft flush of her uneasiness,  revealing itself in her eyes and cheeks, he saw neither fear nor  hesitation.
  In the &#8220;big room&#8221; of Sokwenna's cabin, which was patterned after his  own, he sat down amid the color and delicate fragrance of masses of  flowers, and the girl seated herself near him and waited for him to  speak.
  &#8220;You love flowers,&#8221; he said lamely. &#8220;I want to thank you for the  flowers you placed in my cabin. And the other things.&#8221;
  &#8220;Flowers are a habit with me,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;and I have never seen  such flowers as these. Flowers&#8212;and birds. I never dreamed that there  were so many up here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor the world,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It is ignorant of Alaska.&#8221;
  He was looking at her, trying to understand the inexplicable  something about her. She knew what was in his mind, because the  strangely thrilling emotion that possessed him could not keep its  betrayal from his eyes. The color was fading slowly out of her cheeks;  her lips grew a little tense, yet in her attitude of suspense and of  waiting there was no longer a suspicion of embarrassment, no trace of  fear, and no sign that a moment was at hand when her confidence was on  the ebb. In this moment Alan did not think of John Graham. It seemed to  him that she was like a child again, the child who had come to him in  his cabin, and who had stood with her back against his cabin door,  entreating him to achieve the impossible; an angel, almost, with her  smooth, shining hair, her clear, beautiful eyes, her white throat which  waited with its little heart-throb for him to beat down the fragile  defense which now lay in the greater power of his own hands. The  inequality of it, and the pitilessness of what had been in his mind to  say and do, together with an inundating sense of his own brute mastery,  swept over him, and in sudden desperation he reached out his hands  toward her and cried:
  &#8220;Mary Standish, in God's name tell me the truth. Tell me why you  have come up here!&#8221;
  &#8220;I have come,&#8221; she said, looking at him steadily, &#8220;because I know  that a man like you, when he loves a woman, will fight for her and  protect her even though he may not possess her.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you didn't know that&#8212;not until&#8212;the cottonwoods!&#8221; he  protested.
  &#8220;Yes, I did. I knew it in Ellen McCormick's cabin.&#8221;
  She rose slowly before him, and he, too, rose to his feet, staring  at her like a man who had been struck, while intelligence&#8212;a dawning  reason&#8212;an understanding of the strange mystery of her that morning,  sent the still greater thrill of its shock through him. He gave an  exclamation of amazement.
  &#8220;You were at Ellen McCormick's! She gave you&#8212;<I>that!</I>&#8220;
  She nodded. &#8220;Yes, the dress you brought from the ship. Please don't  scold me, Mr. Holt. Be a little kind with me when you have heard what I  am going to tell you. I was in the cabin that last day, when you  returned from searching for me in the sea. Mr. McCormick didn't know.  But<I> she</I> did. I lied a little, just a little, so that she, being  a woman, would promise not to tell you I was there. You see, I had lost  a great deal of my faith, and my courage was about gone, and I was  afraid of you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Afraid of me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, afraid of everybody. I was in the room behind Ellen McCormick  when she asked you&#8212;that question; and when you answered as you did, I  was like stone. I was amazed and didn't believe, for I was certain that  after what had happened on the ship you despised me, and only through a  peculiar sense of honor were making the search for me. Not until two  days later, when your letters came to Ellen McCormick, and we read  them&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You opened both?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course. One was to be read immediately, the other when I was  found&#8212;and I had found myself. Maybe it wasn't exactly fair, but you  couldn't expect two women to resist a temptation like that. And&#8212;<I>I  wanted to know</I>.&#8221;
  She did not lower her eyes or turn her head aside as she made the  confession. Her gaze met Alan's with beautiful steadiness.
  &#8220;And then I believed. I knew, because of what you said in that  letter, that you were the one man in all the world who would help me  and give me a fighting chance if I came to you. But it has taken all my  courage&#8212;and in the end you will drive me away&#8212;&#8221;
  Again he looked upon the miracle of tears in wide-open, unfaltering  eyes, tears which she did not brush away, but through which, in a  moment, she smiled at him as no woman had ever smiled at him before.  And with the tears there seemed to possess her a pride which lifted her  above all confusion, a living spirit of will and courage and womanhood  that broke away the dark clouds of suspicion and fear that had gathered  in his mind. He tried to speak, and his lips were thick.
  &#8220;You have come&#8212;because you know I love you, and you&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Because, from the beginning, it must have been a great faith in you  that inspired me, Alan Holt.&#8221;
  &#8220;There must have been more than that,&#8221; he persisted. &#8220;Some other  reason.&#8221;
  &#8220;Two,&#8221; she acknowledged, and now he noticed that with the  dissolution of tears a flush of color was returning into her cheeks.
  &#8220;And those&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;One it is impossible for you to know; the other, if I tell you,  will make you despise me. I am sure of that.&#8221;
  &#8220;It has to do with John Graham?&#8221;
  She bowed her head. &#8220;Yes, with John Graham.&#8221;
  For the first time long lashes hid her eyes from him, and for a  moment it seemed that her resolution was gone and she stood stricken by  the import of the thing that lay behind his question; yet her cheeks  flamed red instead of paling, and when she looked at him again, her  eyes burned with a lustrous fire.
  &#8220;John Graham,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;The man you hate and want to kill.&#8221;
  Slowly he turned toward the door. &#8220;I am leaving immediately after  dinner to inspect the herds up in the foothills,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And you&#8212;<I> are welcome here</I>.&#8221;
  He caught the swift intake of her breath as he paused for an instant  at the door, and saw the new light that leaped into her eyes.
  &#8220;Thank you, Alan Holt,&#8221; she cried softly, &#8220;<I>Oh, I thank you!</I>!&#8221;
  And then, suddenly, she stopped him with a little cry, as if at last  something had broken away from her control. He faced her, and for a  moment they stood in silence.
  &#8220;I'm sorry&#8212;sorry I said to you what I did that night on the<I> Nome</I>,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I accused you of brutality, of unfairness, of&#8212;of even  worse than that, and I want to take it all back. You are big and clean  and splendid, for you would go away now, knowing I am poisoned by an  association with the man who has injured you so terribly,<I> and you  say I am welcome!</I> And I don't want you to go. You have made me<I>  want</I> to tell you who I am, and why I have come to you, and I pray  God you will think as kindly of me as you can when you have heard.&#8221;
