A change came at last, when Dolly was ten years old. Among the men  of whom Herminia saw most in these later days, were the little  group of advanced London socialists who call themselves the  Fabians. And among her Fabian friends one of the most active, the  most eager, the most individual, was Harvey Kynaston.    
He was a younger man by many years than poor Alan had been; about  Herminia's own age; a brilliant economist with a future before him.  He aimed at the Cabinet. When first he met Herminia he was charmed  at one glance by her chastened beauty, her breadth and depth of  soul, her transparent sincerity of purpose and action. Those  wistful eyes captured him. Before many days passed he had fallen  in love with her. But he knew her history; and, taking it for  granted she must still be immersed in regret for Alan's loss, he  hardly even reckoned the chances of her caring for him.    
'Tis a common case. Have you ever noticed that if you meet a  woman, famous for her connection with some absorbing grief, some  historic tragedy, you are half appalled at first sight to find that  at times she can laugh, and make merry, and look gay with the rest  of us. Her callous glee shocks you. You mentally expect her to be  forever engaged in the tearful contemplation of her own tragic  fate; wrapt up in those she has lost, like the mourners in a Pieta.  Whenever you have thought of her, you have connected her in your  mind with that one fact in her history, which perhaps may have  happened a great many years ago. But to you, it is as yesterday.  You forget that since then many things have occurred to her. She  has lived her life; she has learned to smile; human nature itself  cannot feed for years on the continuous contemplation of its own  deepest sorrows. It even jars you to find that the widow of a  patriotic martyr, a murdered missionary, has her moments of  enjoyment, and must wither away without them.    
So, just at first, Harvey Kynaston was afraid to let Herminia see  how sincerely he admired her. He thought of her rather as one  whose life is spent, who can bring to the banquet but the cold dead  ashes of a past existence. Gradually, however, as he saw more and  more of her, it began to strike him that Herminia was still in all  essentials a woman. His own throbbing heart told him so as he sat  and talked with her. He thrilled at her approach. Bit by bit the  idea rose up in his mind that this lonely soul might still be won.  He set to work in earnest to woo and win her.    
As for Herminia, many men had paid her attentions already in her  unwedded widowhood. Some of them, after the fashion of men, having  heard garbled versions of her tragic story, and seeking to gain  some base advantage for themselves from their knowledge of her  past, strove to assail her crudely. Them, with unerring womanly  instinct, she early discerned, and with unerring feminine tact,  undeceived and humbled. Others, genuinely attracted by her beauty  and her patience, paid real court to her heart; but all these fell  far short of her ideal standard. With Harvey Kynaston it was  different. She admired him as a thinker; she liked him as a man;  and she felt from the first moment that no friend, since Alan died,  had stirred her pulse so deeply as he did.    
For some months they met often at the Fabian meetings and  elsewhere; till at last it became a habit with them to spend their  Sunday mornings on some breezy wold in the country together.  Herminia was still as free as ever from any shrinking terror as to  what "people might say;" as of old, she lived her life for herself  and her conscience, not for the opinion of a blind and superstitious  majority. On one such August morning, they had taken the train from  London to Haslemere, with Dolly of course by their side, and then  had strolled up Hind Head by the beautiful footpath which mounts at  first through a chestnut copse, and then between heather-clad hills  to the summit. At the loneliest turn of the track, where two purple  glens divide, Harvey Kynaston seated himself on the soft bed of  ling; Herminia sank by his side; and Dolly, after awhile, not  understanding their conversation, wandered off by herself a little  way afield in search of harebells and spotted orchises. Dolly found  her mother's friends were apt to bore her; she preferred the society  of the landlady's daughters.    
It was a delicious day. Hard by, a slow-worm sunned himself on the  basking sand. Blue dragon-flies flashed on gauze wings in the  hollows. Harvey Kynaston looked on Herminia's face and saw that  she was fair. With an effort he made up his mind to speak at last.  In plain and simple words he asked her reverently the same question  that Alan had asked her so long ago on the Holmwood.    
Herminia's throat flushed a rosy red, and an unwonted sense of  pleasure stole over that hard-worked frame as she listened to his  words; for indeed she was fond of him. But she answered him at  once without a moment's hesitation. "Harvey, I'm glad you ask me,  for I like and admire you. But I feel sure beforehand my answer  must be <i>no</i>. For I think what you mean is to ask, will I marry  you?"    
The man gazed at her hard. He spoke low and deferentially. "Yes,  Herminia," he replied. "I do mean, will you marry me? I know,  of course, how you feel about this matter; I know what you have  sacrificed, how deeply you have suffered, for the sake of your  principles. And that's just why I plead with you now to ignore  them. You have given proof long ago of your devotion to the right.  You may surely fall back this second time upon the easier way of  ordinary humanity. In theory, Herminia, I accept your point of  view; I approve the equal liberty of men and women, politically,  socially, personally, ethically. But in practice, I don't want to  bring unnecessary trouble on the head of a woman I love; and to  live together otherwise than as the law directs does bring  unnecessary trouble, as you know too profoundly. That is the only  reason why I ask you to marry me. And Herminia, Herminia," he  leant forward appealingly, "for the love's sake I bear you, I hope  you will consent to it."    
His voice was low and tender. Herminia, sick at heart with that  long fierce struggle against overwhelming odds, could almost have  said <i>yes</i> to him. Her own nature prompted her; she was very, very  fond of him. But she paused for a second. Then she answered him  gravely.    
"Harvey," she said, looking deep into his honest brown eyes, "as  we grow middle-aged, and find how impossible it must ever be to  achieve any good in a world like this, how sad a fate it is to be  born a civilized being in a barbaric community, I'm afraid moral  impulse half dies down within us. The passionate aim grows cold;  the ardent glow fades and flickers into apathy. I'm ashamed to  tell you the truth, it seems such weakness; yet as you ask me this,  I think I <i>will</i> tell you. Once upon a time, if you had made such a  proposal to me, if you had urged me to be false to my dearest  principles, to sin against the light, to deny the truth, I would  have flashed forth a <i>no</i> upon you without one moment's hesitation.  And now, in my disillusioned middle age what do I feel? Do you  know, I almost feel tempted to give way to this Martinmas summer of  love, to stultify my past by unsaying and undoing everything. For  I love you, Harvey. If I were to give way now, as George Eliot  gave way, as almost every woman who once tried to live a free life  for her sisters' sake, has given way in the end, I should  counteract any little good my example has ever done or may ever do  in the world; and Harvey, strange as it sounds, I feel more than  half inclined to do it. But I <i>will</i> not, I <i>will</i> not; and I'll tell  you why. It's not so much principle that prevents me now. I admit  that freely. The torpor of middle age is creeping over my  conscience. It's simple regard for personal consistency, and for  Dolly's position. How can I go back upon the faith for which I  have martyred myself? How can I say to Dolly, 'I wouldn't marry  your father in my youth, for honor's sake; but I have consented in  middle life to sell my sisters' cause for a man I love, and for the  consideration of society; to rehabilitate myself too late with a  world I despise by becoming one man's slave, as I swore I never  would be.' No, no, dear Harvey; I can't do that. Some sense of  personal continuity restrains me still. It is the Nemesis of our  youth; we can't go back in our later life on the holier and purer  ideals of our girlhood."    
"Then you say no definitely?" Harvey Kynaston asked.    
Herminia's voice quivered. "I say no definitely," she answered;  "unless you can consent to live with me on the terms on which I  lived with Dolly's father."    
The man hesitated a moment. Then he began to plead hard for  reconsideration. But Herminia's mind was made up. She couldn't  belie her past; she couldn't be false to the principles for whose  sake she had staked and lost everything. "No, no," she said  firmly, over and over again. "You must take me my own way, or you  must go without me."    
And Harvey Kynaston couldn't consent to take her her own way. His  faith was too weak, his ambitions were too earthly. "Herminia," he  said, before they parted that afternoon, "we may still be friends;  still dear friends as ever? This episode need make no difference  to a very close companionship?"    
"It need make no difference," Herminia answered, with a light touch  of her hand. "Harvey, I have far too few friends in the world  willingly to give up one of them. Come again and go down with  Dolly and me to Hind Head as usual next Sunday."    
"Thank you," the man answered. "Herminia, I wish it could have  been otherwise. But since I must never have you, I can promise you  one thing; I will never marry any other woman."    
Herminia started at the words. "Oh, no," she cried quickly. "How  can you speak like that? How can you say anything so wrong, so  untrue, so foolish? To be celibate is a very great misfortune even  for a woman; for a man it is impossible, it is cruel, it is wicked.  I endure it myself, for my child's sake, and because I find it hard  to discover the help meet for me; or because, when discovered, he  refuses to accept me in the only way in which I can bestow myself.  But for a man to pretend to live celibate is to cloak hateful wrong  under a guise of respectability. I should be unhappy if I thought  any man was doing such a vicious thing out of desire to please me.  Take some other woman on free terms if you can; but if you cannot,  it is better you should marry than be a party to still deeper and  more loathsome slavery."    
And from that day forth they were loyal friends, no more, one to  the other.
