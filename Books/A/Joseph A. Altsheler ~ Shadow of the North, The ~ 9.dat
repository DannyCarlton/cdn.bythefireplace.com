  It was with emotion that Robert came to Albany, an emotion that was  shared by his Onondaga comrade, Tayoga, who had spent a long time in a  white school there. The staid Dutch town was the great outpost of the  Province of New York in the wilderness, and although his temperament  was unlike that of the Dutch burghers he had innumerable pleasant  memories of it, and many friends there. It was, in his esteem, too, a  fine town, on its hills over-looking that noble river, the Hudson, and  as the little group rode on he noted that despite the war its  appearance was still peaceful and safe.
  Their way led along the main street which was broad and with grass  on either side. The solid Dutch houses, with their gable ends to the  street, stood every one on its own lawn, with a garden behind it. Every  house also had a portico in front of it, on which the people sat in  summer evenings, or where they visited with one another. Except that it  was hills where the old country was flat, it was much like Holland, and  the people, keen and thrifty, had preserved their national customs even  unto the third and fourth generations. Robert understood them as he  understood the Hodenosaunce, and, with his adaptable temperament, and  with his mind that could understand so readily the minds of others, he  was able to meet them on common ground. As they rode into the city he  looked questioningly at Willet, and the hunter, understanding the  voiceless query, smiled.
  &#8220;We couldn't think of going to any other place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we did  we could never secure his forgiveness.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be more than glad to see him. A right good friend of ours,  isn't he, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Though his tongue lashes us his heart is with us,&#8221; replied the  Onondaga. &#8220;He is a great white chief, three hundred pounds of  greatness.&#8221;
  They stopped before one of the largest of the brick houses, standing  on one of the widest and neatest of the lawns, and Robert and Tayoga,  entering the portico, knocked upon the door with a heavy brass knocker.  They heard presently the rattle of chains inside, and the rumble of a  deep, grumbling voice. Then the two lads looked at each other and  laughed, laughed in the careless, joyous way in which youth alone can  laugh.
  &#8220;It is he, Mynheer Jacobus himself, come to let us in,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;And he has not changed at all,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;We can tell that by  the character of his voice on the other side of the door.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I would not have him changed.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor would I.&#8221;
  The door was thrown open, but as all the windows were closed there  was yet gloom inside. Presently something large, red and shining  emerged from the dusk and two beams of light in the center of the  redness played upon them. Then the outlines of a gigantic human figure,  a man tall and immensely stout, were disclosed. He wore a black suit  with knee breeches, thick stockings and buckled shoes, and his powdered  hair was tied in a queue. His eyes, dazzled at first by the light from  without, began to twinkle as he looked. Then a great blaze of joy swept  over his face, and he held out two fat hands, one to the white youth  and one to the red.
  &#8220;Ah, it iss you, Robert, you scapegrace, and it iss you, Tayoga, you  wild Onondaga! It iss a glad day for me that you haf come, but I  thought you both dead, und well you might be, reckless, thoughtless  lads who haf not the thought uf the future in your minds.&#8221;
  Robert shook the fat hand in both of his and laughed.
  &#8220;You are the same as of old, Mynheer Jacobus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and before  Tayoga and I saw you, but while we heard you, we agreed that there had  been no change, and that we did not want any.&#8221;
  &#8220;And why should I change, you two young rascals? Am I not goot  enough as I am? Haf I not in the past given the punishment to both uf  you und am I not able to do it again, tall and strong as the two uf you  haf grown? Ah, such foolish lads! Perhaps you haf been spared because  pity wass taken on your foolishness. But iss it Mynheer Willet beyond  you? That iss a man of sense.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's none other than Dave, Mynheer Jacobus,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;Then why doesn't he come in?&#8221; exclaimed Mynheer Jacobus Huysman.  &#8220;He iss welcome here, doubly, triply welcome, und he knows it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dave! Dave! Hurry!&#8221; called Robert, &#8220;or Mynheer Jacobus will  chastise you. He's so anxious to fall on your neck and welcome you that  he can't wait!&#8221;
  Willet came swiftly up the brick walk, and the hands of the two big  men met in a warm clasp.
  &#8220;You see I've brought the boys back to you again, Jacob,&#8221; said the  hunter.
  &#8220;But what reckless lads they've become,&#8221; grumbled Mynheer Huysman.  &#8220;I can see the mischief in their eyes now. They wass bad enough when  they went to school here und lived with me, but since they've run wild  in the forests this house iss not able to hold them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you worry, Jacob, old friend. These arms and shoulders of  mine are still strong, and if they make you trouble I will deal with  them. But we just stopped a minute to inquire into the state of your  health. Can you tell us which is now the best inn in Albany?&#8221;
  The face of Mynheer Jacobus Huysman flamed, and his eyes blazed in  the center of it, two great red lights.
  &#8220;Inn! Inn!&#8221; he roared in his queer mixture of English, Dutch and  German accent &#8220;Iss it that your head hass been struck by lightning und  you haf gone crazy? If there wass a thousand inns at Albany you und  Robert und Tayoga could not stop at one uf them. Iss not the house uf  Jacobus Huysman good enough for you?&#8221;
  Robert, Tayoga and the hunter laughed aloud.
  &#8220;He did but make game of you, Mynheer Jacobus,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;We  will alter your statement and say if there were a thousand inns in  Albany you could not make us stay at any one of them. Despite your  commands we would come directly to your house.&#8221;
  Mynheer Jacobus Huysman permitted himself to smile. But his voice  renewed its grumbling tone.
  &#8220;Ever the same,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You must stay here, although only the  good Lord himself knows in what condition my house will be when you  leave. You are two wild lads. It iss not so strange uf you, Robert  Lennox, who are white, but I would expect better uf Tayoga, who is to  be a great Onondaga chief some day.&#8221;
  &#8220;You make a great mistake, Mynheer Jacobus,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Tayoga is  far worse than I am. All the mischief that I have ever done was due to  his example and persuasion. It is my misfortune that I have a weak  nature, and I am easily led into evil by my associates.&#8221;
  &#8220;It iss not so. You are equally bad. Bring in your baggage und I  will see if Caterina, der cook, cannot find enough for you three, who  always eat like raging lions.&#8221;
  The soldiers, who were to return immediately to Colonel William  Johnson, rode away with their horses, and Robert, Tayoga and Willet  took their packs into the house of Mynheer Huysman, who grumbled  incessantly while he and a manservant and a maidservant made them as  comfortable as possible.
  &#8220;Would you und Tayoga like to haf your old room on the second  floor?&#8221; he said to Robert.
  &#8220;Nothing would please us better,&#8221; replied the lad.
  &#8220;Then you shall haf it,&#8221; said Mynheer, as he led the way up the  stair and into the room. &#8220;Do you remember, Tayoga, how wild you wass  when you came here to learn the good ways und bad ways uf the white  people?&#8221;
  &#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Tayoga, &#8220;and the walls and the roof felt oppressive  to me, although we have stout log houses of our own in our villages.  But they were not our own walls and our own roof, and there was the  great young warrior, Lennox, whom we now call Dagaeoga, who was to stay  in the same room and even in the same bed with me. Do you wonder that I  felt like climbing out of a window at night, and escaping into the  woods?&#8221;
  &#8220;You were eleven then,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and I was just a shade  younger. You were as strange to me as I was to you, and I thought, in  truth, that you were going to run away into the wilderness. But you  didn't, and you began to learn from books faster than I thought was  possible for one whose mind before then had been turned in another  direction.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you helped me, Dagaeoga. After our first and only battle in the  garden, which I think was a draw, we became allies.&#8221;
  &#8220;Und you united against me,&#8221; said Mynheer Huysman.
  &#8220;And you helped me with the books,&#8221; continued Tayoga. &#8220;Ah, those  first months were hard, very hard!&#8221;
  &#8220;And you taught me the use of the bow and arrow,&#8221; continued Robert,  &#8220;and new skill in both fishing and hunting.&#8221;
  &#8220;Und the two uf you together learned new tricks und new ways uf  making my life miserable,&#8221; grumbled Mynheer Huysman.
  &#8220;But you must admit, Jacob,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;that they were not the  worst boys in the world.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, not the worst, perhaps, David, because I don't know all the  boys uf all the countries in the world, but when you put an Onondaga  lad und an American lad together in alliance it iss hard to find any  one who can excel them, because they haf the mischief uf two nations.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you are tremendously glad to see them again, Jacob. Don't deny  it. I read it over and over again in your eyes.&#8221;
  Willet's own eyes twinkled as he spoke, and he saw also that there  was a light in those of the big Dutchman. But Huysman would admit  nothing.
  &#8220;Here iss your room,&#8221; he said to Robert and Tayoga.
  Robert saw that it was not changed. All the old, familiar objects  were there, and they brought to him a rush of emotion, as inanimate  things often do. On a heavy mahogany dresser lay two worn volumes that  he touched affectionately. One was his Caesar and the other his  algebra. Once he had hated both, but now he thought of them tenderly as  links with, the peaceful boyhood that was slipping away. Hanging from a  hook on the wall was an unstrung bow, the first weapon of the kind with  which he had practiced under the teaching of Tayoga. He passed his hand  over it gently and felt a thrill at the touch of the wood.
  Tayoga, also was moving about the room. On a small shelf lay an  English dictionary and several readers. They too were worn. He had  spent many a grieving hour over them when he had come from the Iroquois  forests to learn the white man's lore. He recalled how he had hated  them for a time, and how he had looked out of his school windows at the  freedom for which he had longed. But he was made of wrought steel, both  mind and body, and always the white youth, Lennox, his comrade, was at  his elbow in those days of his scholastic infancy to help him. It had  been a great episode in the life of Tayoga, who had the intellect of a  mighty chief, the mind of Pontiac or Thayendanegea, or Tecumseh, or  Sequoia. He had forced himself to learn and in learning his books he  had learned also to like the people of another race around him who were  good to him and who helped him in the first hard days on the new road.  So the young Onondaga felt an emotion much like that of Robert as he  walked about the room and touched the old familiar things. Then he  turned to Huysman.
  &#8220;Mynheer Jacobus,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have a mighty body, and you have in  it a great heart. If all the men at Albany were like you there would  never be any trouble between them and the Hodenosaunee.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga,&#8221; said Huysman, &#8220;you haf borrowed Robert's tongue to cozen  und flatter. I haf not a great heart at all. I haf a very bad heart. I  could not get on in this world if I didn't.&#8221;
  Tayoga laughed musically, and Mynheer Jacobus gruffly bidding them  not to destroy anything, while he was gone, departed to see that  Caterina, the Dutch cook, fat like her master, should have ready a  dinner, drawing upon every resource of his ample larder. It is but  truth to say that the heart of Mynheer Jacobus was very full. A fat old  bachelor, with no near kin, his heart yearned over the two lads who had  spent so long a period in his home, and he knew them, too, for what  they were, each a fine flower of his own racial stock.
  They were to remain several days in Albany, and after dinner they  visited Alexander McLean, the crusty teacher who had given them such a  severe drilling in their books. Master McLean allowed himself a few  brief expressions of pleasure when they came into his house, and then  questioned them sharply:
  &#8220;Do you remember any of your ancient history, Tayoga?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Are the great deeds of the Greeks and Romans still in your mind?&#8221;
  &#8220;At times they are, sir,&#8221; replied the young Onondaga.
  &#8220;Um-m. Is that so? What was the date of the battle of Zama?&#8221;
  &#8220;It was fought 202 B.C., sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're correct, but it must have been only a lucky guess. I'll try  you again. What was the date of the battle of Hastings?&#8221;
  &#8220;It was fought 1066 A.D., sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very good. Since you have answered correctly twice it must be  knowledge and not mere surmise on your part. Robert, whom do you esteem  the greatest of the Greek dramatic poets?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sophocles, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because he combined the vigor and power of Aeschylus with the  polish and refinement of Euripides.&#8221;
  &#8220;Correct. I see that you remember what I told you, as you have  quoted almost my exact words. And now, lads, be seated, while I order  refreshments for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;We thank you, sir,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but 'tis less than an hour since  we almost ate ourselves to death at the house of Mynheer Jacobus  Huysman.&#8221;
  &#8220;A good man, Jacob, but too fat, and far too brusque in speech,  especially to the young. I'll warrant me he has been addressing  upbraiding words to you, finding fault, perhaps, with your manners and  your parts of speech.&#8221;
  The two youths hid their smiles.
  &#8220;Mynheer Jacobus was very good to us,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Just as you  are, Master McLean.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not good to you, if you mean by it weakness and softness of  heart. Never spoil the young. Speak sternly to them all the time. Use  the strap and the rod freely upon them and you may make men of them.&#8221;
  Again Robert and Tayoga hid their smiles, but each knew that he had  a soft place in the heart of the crusty teacher, and they spent a  pleasant hour with him. That night they slept in their old room at  Mynheer Huysman's and two days later they and Willet went on board a  sloop for New York, where they intended to see Governor de Lancey.  Before they left many more alarming reports about the French and  Indians had come to Albany. They had made new ravages in the north and  west, and their power was spreading continually. France was already  helping her colonists. When would England help hers?
  But Robert forgot all alarm in the pleasure of the voyage. It was a  good sloop, it had a stout Dutch captain, and with a favoring wind they  sped fast southward. Pride in the splendid river swelled in Robert's  soul and he and Tayoga, despite the cold, sat together on the deck,  watching the lofty shores and the distant mountains.
  But Willet, anxious of mind, paced back and forth. He had seen much  at Albany that did not please him. The Indian Commissioners were doing  little to cement the alliance with the Hodenosaunee. The Mohawks, alone  of the great League, were giving aid against the French. The others  remained in their villages, keeping a strict neutrality. That was well  as far as it went, but the hunter had hoped that all the members of the  Hodenosaunee would take the field for the English. He believed that  Father Drouillard would soon be back among the Onondagas, seeking to  sway his converts to France, and he dreaded, too, the activity and  persistency of St. Luc.
  But he kept his anxieties from Robert, knowing how eagerly the lad  anticipated his arrival in New York, and not blaming him at all for it,  since New York, although inferior in wealth, size and power to  Philadelphia, and in leadership to Boston, was already, in the eye of  the prophets, because of its situation, destined to become the first  city of America. And Willet felt his own pulses beat a little faster at  the thought of New York, a town that he knew well, and already a port  famous throughout the world.
  Tayoga, although he wore his Indian dress, attracted no particular  attention from Captain Van Zouten and his crew. Indians could be seen  daily at Albany, and along the river, and they had been for generations  a part of American life. Captain Van Zouten, in truth, noticed the  height and fine bearing of the Onondaga, but he was a close mouthed  Dutchman, and if he felt like asking questions he put due Dutch  restraint upon himself.
  The wind held good all day long, and the sloop flew southward,  leaving a long white trail in the blue water, but toward night it rose  to a gale, with heavy clouds that promised snow. Captain Hendrick Van  Zouten looked up with some anxiety at his sails, through which the wind  was now whistling, and, after a consultation with his mate, decided to  draw into a convenient cove and anchor for the night.
  &#8220;I'm sorry,&#8221; he said to Willet, &#8220;that our voyage to New York will be  delayed, but there'll be nasty weather on the river, and I don't like  to risk the sloop in it. But I didn't promise you that I'd get you to  the city at any particular time.&#8221;
  &#8220;We don't blame wind, weather and water upon you, Captain Van  Zouten,&#8221; laughed Willet, &#8220;and although I'm no seaman if you'd have  consulted me I too would have suggested shelter for the night.&#8221;
  Captain Van Zouten breathed his relief.
  &#8220;If my passengers are satisfied,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then so am I.&#8221;
  All the sails were furled, the sloop was anchored securely in a cove  where she could not injure herself, no matter how fiercely the wind  might beat, and Robert and Tayoga, wrapped in their fur cloaks, stood  on her deck, watching the advance of the fierce winter storm, and  remembering those other storms they had passed through on Lake  Champlain, although there was no danger of Indians here.
  It began to snow heavily, and a fierce wind whistled among the  mountains behind them, lashing the river also into high waves, but the  sloop was a tight, strong craft, and it rocked but little in its snug  cove. Despite snow, wind and darkness Robert, Tayoga and the hunter  remained a long, time on deck. The Onondaga's feather headdress had  been replaced by a fur cap, similar to those now worn by Robert and  Willet, and all three were wrapped in heavy cloaks of furs.
  Robert was still thinking of New York, a town that he knew to some  extent, and yet he was traveling toward it with a feeling akin to that  with which he had approached Quebec. It was in a way and for its time a  great port, in which many languages were spoken and to which many ships  came. Despite its inferiority in size it was already the chief window  through which the New World looked upon the Old. He expected to see  life in the seething little city at the mouth of the Hudson and he  expected also that a crisis in his fortunes would come there.
  &#8220;Dave,&#8221; he said to the hunter, &#8220;have you any plans for us in New  York?&#8221;
  &#8220;They've not taken very definite shape,&#8221; replied Willet, &#8220;but you  know you want to serve in the war, and so do I. A great expedition is  coming out from England, and in conjunction with a Colonial force it  will march against Fort Duquesne. The point to which that force  advances is bound to be the chief scene of action.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that, Dave, is where we want to go.&#8221;
  &#8220;With proper commissions in the army. We must maintain our dignity  and station, Robert.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course, Dave. And you, Tayoga, are you willing to go with us?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is far from the vale of Onondaga,&#8221; replied the young Indian,  &#8220;but I have already made the great journey to Quebec with my comrades,  Dagaeoga and the Great Bear. I am willing to see more of the world of  which I read in the books at Albany. If the fortunes of Dagaeoga take  him on another long circle I am ready to go with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Spoken like a warrior, Tayoga,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;I have some  influence, and if we join the army that is to march against Fort  Duquesne I'll see that you receive a place befitting your Onondaga rank  and your quality as a man.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so that is settled,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;We three stand together no  matter what may come.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stand together it is, no matter what may come,&#8221; said Willet.
  &#8220;We are, perhaps, as well in one place as in another,&#8221; said Tayoga  philosophically, &#8220;because wherever we may be Manitou holds us in the  hollow of his hand.&#8221;
  A great gust of wind came with a shriek down one of the gorges, and  the snow was whipped into their faces, blinding them for a moment.
  &#8220;It is good to be aboard a stout sloop in such a storm,&#8221; said  Robert, as he wiped his eyes clear. &#8220;It would be hard to live up there  on those cliffs in all this driving white winter.&#8221;
  A deep rumbling sound came back from the mountains, and he felt a  chill that was not of the cold creep into his bones.
  &#8220;It is the wind in the deep gorges,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;but the winds  themselves are spirits and the mountains too are spirits. On such a  wild night as this they play together and the rumbling you hear is  their voices joined in laughter.&#8221;
  Robert's vivid mind as usual responded at once to Tayoga's imagery,  and his fancy went as far as that of the Onondaga, and perhaps farther.  He filled the air with spirits. They lined the edge of the driving  white storm. They flitted through every cleft and gorge, and above  every ridge and peak. They were on the river, and they rode upon the  waves that were pursuing one another over its surface. Then he laughed  a little at himself.
  &#8220;My fancy is seeing innumerable figures for me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where my  eyes really see none. No human being is likely to be abroad on the  river on such a night as this.&#8221;
  &#8220;And yet my own eyes tell me that I do see a human being,&#8221; said  Tayoga, &#8220;one that is living and breathing, with warm blood running in  his veins.&#8221;
  &#8220;A living, breathing man! where, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Look at the sloping cliff above us, there where the trees grow  close together. Notice the one with the boughs hanging low, and by the  dark trunk you will see the figure. It is a tall man with his hat drawn  low over his eyes, and a heavy cloak wrapped closely around his body.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see him now, Tayoga! What could a man want at such a place on  such a night? It must be a farmer out late, or perhaps a wandering  hunter!&#8221;
  &#8220;Nay, Dagaeoga, it is not a farmer, nor yet a wandering hunter. The  shoulders are set too squarely. The figure is too upright. And even  without these differences we would be sure that it is not the farmer,  nor yet the wandering hunter, because it is some one else whom we  know.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Look! Look closely, Dagaeoga!&#8221;
  &#8220;Now the wind drives aside the white veil of snow and I see him  better. His figure is surely familiar!&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, Dagaeoga, it is! And do you not know him?&#8221;
  &#8220;St. Luc! As sure as we live, Tayoga, it's St. Luc.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the hunter, who had not spoken hitherto. &#8220;It's St. Luc,  and I could reach him from here with a rifle shot.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you must not! You must not fire upon him!&#8221; exclaimed Robert.
  Willet laughed.
  &#8220;I wasn't thinking of doing so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And now it's too late.  St. Luc has gone.&#8221;
  The dark figure vanished from beside the trunk, and Robert saw only  the lofty slope, and the whirling snow. He passed his hands before his  eyes.
  &#8220;Did we really see him?&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;We beheld him alive and in the flesh,&#8221; replied the hunter, &#8220;deep  down in His Britannic Majesty's province of New York.&#8221;
  &#8220;What could have brought him here at such a time?&#8221;
  &#8220;The cause of France, no doubt. He speaks English as well as you and  I, and he is probably in civilian clothing, seeking information for his  country. I know something of St. Luc. He has in him a spice of the  daring and romantic. Luck and adventure would appeal to him. He  probably knows already what forces we have at Albany and Kingston and  what is their state of preparation. Valuable knowledge for Quebec,  too.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think St. Luc will venture to New York?&#8221;
  &#8220;Scarce likely, lad. He can obtain about all he wishes to know  without going so far south.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad of that, Dave. I shouldn't want him to be captured and  hanged as a spy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor I, Robert. St. Luc is the kind of man who, if he falls at all  in this war, should fall sword in hand on the battle field. He must  know this region or he would not dare to come here, on such a terrible  night. He has probably gone now to shelter. And, since there is nothing  more to be seen we might do the same.&#8221;
  But Robert and Tayoga were not willing to withdraw yet. Well wrapped  and warm, they found a pleasure in the fierce storm that raged among  the mountains and over the river, and their own security on the deck of  the stout sloop, fastened so safely in the little cove. They listened  to the wind rumbling anew like thunder through the deep gorges and  clefts, and they saw the snow swept in vast curtains of white over the  wild river.
  &#8220;I wonder what we shall find in New York, Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;We shall find many people, of many kinds, Dagaeoga, but what will  happen to us there Manitou alone knows. But he has us in his keeping.  Look how he watched over us in Quebec, and look how the sword of the  Great Bear was stretched before you when your enemies planned to slay  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true, Tayoga. I don't look forward to New York with any  apprehension, but I do wonder what fate has prepared for us there.&#8221;
  &#8220;We must await it with calm,&#8221; said Tayoga philosophically.
  The Onondaga himself was not a stranger to New York. He had gone  there once with the chiefs of the Hodenosaunee for a grand council with  the British and provincial authorities, and he had gone twice with  Robert when they were schoolboys together in Albany. His enlightened  mind, without losing any of its dignity and calm, took a deep interest  in everything he saw at the port, through which the tide of nations  already flowed. He had much of the quality shown later by the fiery  Thayendanegea, who bore himself with the best in London and who was  their equal in manners, though the Onondaga, while as brave and daring  as the Mohawk, was gentler and more spiritual, being, in truth, what  his mind and circumstances had made him, a singular blend of red and  white culture.
  Willet, also wrapped in a long fur cloak, came from the cabin of the  sloop and looked at the two youths, each of whom had such a great place  in his heart. Both were white with snow as they stood on the deck, but  they did not seem to notice it.
  &#8220;Come now,&#8221; said the hunter with assumed brusqueness. &#8220;You needn't  stand here all night, looking at the river, the cliffs and the storm.  Off to your berths, both of you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good advice, or rather command, Dave,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and we'll obey  it.&#8221;
  Their quarters were narrow, because sloops plying on the river in  those days were not large, but the three who slept so often in the  forest were not seekers after luxury. Robert undressed, crept into his  bunk, which was not over two feet wide, and slept soundly until  morning. After midnight the violence of the storm abated. It was still  snowing, but Captain Van Zouten unfurled his sails, made for the middle  of the river, and, when the sun came up over the eastern hills, the  sloop was tearing along at a great rate for New York.
  So when Robert awoke and heard the groaning of timbers and the creak  of cordage he knew at once that they were under way and he was glad.  The events of the night before passed rapidly through his mind, but  they seemed vague and indistinct. At first he thought the vision of St.  Luc on the cliff in the storm was but a dream, and he had to make an  effort of the will to convince himself that it was reality. But  everything came back presently, as vivid as it had been when it  occurred, and rising he dressed and went on deck. Tayoga and Willet  were already there.
  &#8220;Sluggard,&#8221; said the Onondaga. &#8220;The French warships would capture  you while you are still in the land of dreams.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll find no French warships in the Hudson,&#8221; retorted Robert, &#8220;and  as for sluggards, how long have you been on deck yourself, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Two minutes, but much may happen in two minutes. Look, Dagaeoga, we  come now into a land of plenty. See, how many smokes rise on either  shore, and the smoke is not of camps, but of houses.&#8221;
  &#8220;It comes from strong Dutch farmhouses, and from English manor  houses, Tayoga. They nestle in the warm shelter of the hills or at the  mouths of the creeks. Surely, the world cannot furnish a nobler scene.&#8221;
  All the earth was pure white from the fallen snow, but the river  itself was a deep blue, reflected from the dazzling blue of the sky  overhead. The air, thin and cold, was exhilarating, and as the sloop  fled southward a panorama, increasing continually in magnificence,  unfolded before them. Other vessels appeared upon the river, and  Captain Van Zouten gave them friendly signals. Tiny villages showed and  the shores were an obvious manifestation of comfort and opulence.
  &#8220;I have heard that the French, if their success continues, mean to  attack Albany,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but we must stop them there, Dave. We can  never let them invade such a region as this.&#8221;
  &#8220;They'll invade it, nevertheless,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;unless stout  arms and brave hearts stop them. We can drive both French and Indians  back, if we ever unite. There lies the trouble. We must get some sort  of concentrated action.&#8221;
  &#8220;And New York is the best place to see whether it will be done or  not.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it is.&#8221;
  The wind remained favorable all that day, the next night there was a  calm, but the following day they drew near to New York, Captain Van  Zouten assuring them he would make a landing before sunset.
  He was well ahead of his promise, because the sun was high in the  heavens when the sloop began to pass the high, wooded hills that lie at  the upper end of Manhattan Island, and they drew in to their anchorage  near the Battery. They did not see the stone government buildings that  had marked Quebec, nor the numerous signs of a fortress city, but they  beheld more ships and more indications of a great industrial life.
  &#8220;Every time I come here,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;it seems to me that the  masts increase in number. Truly it is a good town, and an abundant life  flows through it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where shall we stop, Dave?&#8221; asked Robert. &#8220;Do you have a tavern in  mind?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a tavern,&#8221; replied the hunter. &#8220;My mind's on a private house,  belonging to a friend of mine. You have not met him because he is at  sea or in foreign parts most of the time. Yet we are assured of a  welcome.&#8221;
  An hour later they said farewell to Captain Van Zouten, carried  their own light baggage, and entered the streets of the port.
