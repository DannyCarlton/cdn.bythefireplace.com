  Joe and his friend Bickford arrived in San Francisco eight days  later without having met with any other misadventure or drawback. He  had been absent less than three months, yet he found changes. A  considerable number of buildings had gone up in different parts of the  town during his absence.
  &#8220;It is a wonderful place,&#8221; said Joe to his companion.
  &#8220;It is going to be a great city some day.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's ahead of Pumpkin Holler already,&#8221; said Mr. Bickford, &#8220;though  the Holler has been goin' for over a hundred years.&#8221;
  Joe smiled at the comparison. He thought he could foresee the rapid  progress of the new city, but he was far from comprehending the  magnificent future that lay before it. A short time since, the writer  of this story ascended to the roof of the Palace Hotel, and from this  lofty elevation, a hundred and forty feet above the sidewalk, scanned  with delighted eyes a handsome and substantial city, apparently the  growth of a century, and including within its broad limits a population  of three hundred thousand souls. It will not be many years before it  reaches half-a-million, and may fairly be ranked among the great cities  of the world.
  Of course Joe's first visit was to his old place of business. He  received a hearty greeting from Watson, his deputy.
  &#8220;I am glad to see you, Joe,&#8221; said he, grasping our hero's hand  cordially. &#8220;When did you arrive?&#8221;
  &#8220;Ten minutes ago. I have made you the first call.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you thought I might have 'vamosed the ranch,'&#8220; said Watson,  smiling, &#8220;and left you and the business in the lurch.&#8221;
  &#8220;I had no fears on that score,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Has business been good?&#8221;
  &#8220;Excellent. I have paid weekly your share of the profits to Mr.  Morgan.&#8221;
  &#8220;Am I a millionaire yet?&#8221; asked Joe.
  &#8220;Not quite. I have paid Mr. Morgan on your account&#8221;&#8212;here Watson  consulted a small account-book&#8212;&#8220;nine hundred and twenty-five dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; said Joe, gratified. &#8220;That is splendid.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you are satisfied?&#8221;
  &#8220;More than satisfied.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad of it. I have made the same for myself and so have nearly  half made up the sum which I so foolishly squandered at the  gaming-table.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad for you, Mr. Watson.&#8221;
  &#8220;How have you prospered at the mines?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have had excellent luck.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't believe you bring home as much money as I have made for you  here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't bet on that, Mr. Watson, for you would lose.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't mean to say that you have made a thousand dollars?&#8221;  exclaimed Watson, surprised.
  &#8220;I have made five thousand dollars within a hundred or two.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is it possible!&#8221; ejaculated Watson. &#8220;You beat everything for luck,  Joe.&#8221;
  &#8220;So he does,&#8221; said Bickford, who felt that it was time for him to  speak. &#8220;It's lucky for me that I fell in with him. It brought me luck,  too, for we went into partnership together.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you brought home five thousand dollars, too?&#8221; asked Watson.
  &#8220;I've got about the same as Joe, and now I'm going home to marry  Susan Smith if she'll have me.&#8221;
  &#8220;She'll marry a rich miner, Mr. Bickford. You needn't be concerned  about that.&#8221;
  &#8220;I feel pretty easy in mind,&#8221; said Joshua.
  &#8220;How soon do you sail?&#8221;
  &#8220;When does the next steamer go?&#8221;
  &#8220;In six days.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess it'll carry me.&#8221;
  Watson turned to Joe.
  &#8220;I suppose you will now take charge of your own business?&#8221; said lie.  &#8220;I am ready to hand over my trust at any minute.&#8221;
  &#8220;Would you object to retaining charge for&#8212;say for four months to  come?&#8221; asked Joe.
  &#8220;Object? I should be delighted to do it. I couldn't expect to make  as much money any other way.&#8221;
  &#8220;You see, Mr. Watson, I am thinking of going home myself on a visit.  I feel that I can afford it, and I should like to see my old friends  and acquaintances under my new and improved circumstances.&#8221;
  Watson was evidently elated at the prospect of continued employment  of so remunerative a character.
  &#8220;You may depend upon it that your interests are safe in my hands,&#8221;  said he. &#8220;I will carry on the business as if it were my own. Indeed, it  will be for my interest to do so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't doubt it, Mr. Watson. I have perfect confidence In your  management.&#8221;
  Joe's next call was on his friend Morgan, by whom also he was  cordially welcomed.
  &#8220;Have you called on Watson?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then he has probably given you an idea of how your business has  gone on during your absence. He is a thoroughly reliable man, in my  opinion. You were fortunate to secure his services.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I think.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you done well at the mines?&#8221; asked Mr. Morgan doubtfully.
  &#8220;You hope so, but you don't feel confident?&#8221; said Joe, smiling.
  &#8220;You can read my thoughts exactly. I don't consider mining as  reliable as a regular business.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor I, in general, but there is one thing you don't take into  account.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221;
  Mr. Bickford answered the question.
  &#8220;Joe's luck.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you have been lucky?&#8221;
  &#8220;How much do you think I have brought home?&#8221;
  &#8220;A thousand dollars?&#8221;
  &#8220;Five times that sum.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221; asked Mr. Morgan, incredulous.
  &#8220;Wholly so.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then let me congratulate you&#8212;on that and something else.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221;
  &#8220;The lots you purchased, including the one on which your restaurant  is situated, have more than doubled in value.&#8221;
  &#8220;Bully for you, Joe!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Bickford enthusiastically.
  &#8220;It never rains but it pours,&#8221; said Joe, quoting an old proverb. &#8220;I  begin to think I shall be rich some time, Mr. Morgan.&#8221;
  &#8220;It seems very much like it.&#8221;
  &#8220;What would you advise me to do, Mr. Morgan&#8212;sell out the lots at  the present advance?&#8221;
  &#8220;Hold on to them, Joe. Not only do that, but buy more. This is  destined some day to be a great city. It has a favorable location, is  the great mining center, and the State, I feel convinced, has an  immense territory fit for agricultural purposes. Lots here may  fluctuate, but they will go up a good deal higher than present  figures.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you think so, Mr. Morgan, I will leave in your hands three  thousand dollars for investment in other lots. This will leave me,  including my profits from the business during my absence, nearly three  thousand dollars more, which I shall take East and invest there.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will follow your instructions, Joe, and predict that your real  estate investments will make you rich sooner than you think.&#8221;
  &#8220;Joe,&#8221; said Bickford, &#8220;I've a great mind to leave half of my money  with Mr. Morgan to be invested in the same way.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do it, Mr. Bickford. That will leave you enough to use at home.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;I can buy a farm for two thousand dollars and stock it for  five hundred more. Besides, I needn't pay more than half down, if I  don't want to.&#8221;
  &#8220;A good plan,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;Mr. Morgan, will you take my money and invest it for me just like  Joe's? Of course I want you to take a commission for doing it.&#8221;
  &#8220;With pleasure, Mr. Bickford, more especially as I have decided to  open a real estate office in addition to my regular business. You and  Joe will be my first customers. I shouldn't wonder if the two or three  thousand dollars you leave with me should amount in ten years to ten  thousand.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ten thousand!&#8221; ejaculated Joshua, elated. &#8220;Won't I swell round  Pumpkin Holler when I'm worth ten thousand dollars!&#8221;
  Six days later, among the passengers by the steamer for Panama, were  Joseph Mason and Joshua Bickford.
