  Alan Holt was a man whom other men looked at twice. With women it  was different. He was, in no solitary sense of the word, a woman's man.  He admired them in an abstract way, and he was ready to fight for them,  or die for them, at any time such a course became necessary. But his  sentiment was entirely a matter of common sense. His chivalry was born  and bred of the mountains and the open and had nothing in common with  the insincere brand which develops in the softer and more luxurious  laps of civilization. Years of aloneness had put their mark upon him.  Men of the north, reading the lines, understood what they meant. But  only now and then could a woman possibly understand. Yet if in any  given moment a supreme physical crisis had come, women would have  turned instinctively in their helplessness to such a man as Alan Holt.
  He possessed a vein of humor which few had been privileged to  discover. The mountains had taught him to laugh in silence. With him a  chuckle meant as much as a riotous outburst of merriment from another,  and he could enjoy greatly without any noticeable muscular disturbance  of his face. And not always was his smile a reflection of humorous  thought. There were times when it betrayed another kind of thought more  forcefully than speech.
  Because he understood fairly well and knew what he was, the present  situation amused him. He could not but see what an error in judgment  Miss Standish had made in selecting him, when compared with the  intoxicating thrill she could easily have aroused by choosing one of  the young engineers as a companion in her evening adventure. He  chuckled. And Mary Standish, hearing the smothered note of amusement,  gave to her head that swift little birdlike tilt which he had observed  once before, in the presence of Captain Rifle. But she said nothing. As  if challenged, she calmly took possession of his arm.
  Halfway round the deck, Alan began to sense the fact that there was  a decidedly pleasant flavor to the whole thing. The girl's hand did not  merely touch his arm; it was snuggled there confidently, and she was  necessarily so close to him that when he looked down, the glossy coils  of her hair were within a few inches of his face. His nearness to her,  together with the soft pressure of her hand on his arm, was a jolt to  his stoicism.
  &#8220;It's not half bad,&#8221; he expressed himself frankly. &#8220;I really believe  I am going to enjoy answering your questions, Miss Standish.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh!&#8221; He felt the slim, little figure stiffen for an instant. &#8220;You  thought&#8212;possibly&#8212;I might be dangerous?&#8221;
  &#8220;A little. I don't understand women. Collectively I think they are  God's most wonderful handiwork. Individually I don't care much about  them. But you&#8212;&#8221;
  She nodded approvingly. &#8220;That is very nice of you. But you needn't  say I am different from the others. I am not. All women are alike.&#8221;
  &#8220;Possibly&#8212;except in the way they dress their hair.&#8221;
  &#8220;You like mine?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very much.&#8221;
  He was amazed at the admission, so much so that he puffed out a huge  cloud of smoke from his cigar in mental protest.
  They had come to the smoking-room again. This was an innovation  aboard the<I> Nome</I>. There was no other like it in the Alaskan  service, with its luxurious space, its comfortable hospitality, and the  observation parlor built at one end for those ladies who cared to sit  with their husbands while they smoked their after-dinner cigars.
  &#8220;If you want to hear about Alaska and see some of its human make-up,  let's go in,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;I know; of no better place. Are you afraid  of smoke?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. If I were a man, I would smoke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you do?&#8221;
  &#8220;I do not. When I begin that, if you please, I shall bob my hair.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which would be a crime,&#8221; he replied so earnestly that again he was  surprised at himself.
  Two or three ladies, with their escorts, were in the parlor when  they entered. The huge main room, covering a third of the aft deck, was  blue with smoke. A score of men were playing cards at round tables.  Twice as many were gathered in groups, talking, while others walked  aimlessly up and down the carpeted floor. Here and there were men who  sat alone. A few were asleep, which made Alan look at his watch. Then  he observed Mary Standish studying the innumerable bundles of neatly  rolled blankets that lay about. One of them was at her feet. She  touched it with her toe.
  &#8220;What do they mean?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;We are overloaded,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Alaskan steam-ships have no  steerage passengers as we generally know them. It isn't poverty that  rides steerage when you go north. You can always find a millionaire or  two on the lower deck. When they get sleepy, most of the men you see in  there will unroll blankets and sleep on the floor. Did you ever see an  earl?&#8221;
  He felt it his duty to make explanations now that he had brought her  in, and directed her attention to the third table on their left. Three  men were seated at this table.
  &#8220;The man facing us, the one with a flabby face and pale mustache, is  an earl&#8212;I forget his name,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He doesn't look it, but he is a  real sport. He is going up to shoot Kadiak bears, and sleeps on the  floor. The group beyond them, at the fifth table, are Treadwell mining  men, and that fellow you see slouched against the wall, half asleep,  with whiskers nearly to his waist, is Stampede Smith, an old-time  partner of George Carmack, who discovered gold on Bonanza Creek in  Ninety-six. The thud of Carmack's spade, as it hit first pay, was the  'sound heard round the world,' Miss Standish. And the gentleman with  crumpled whiskers was the second-best man at Bonanza, excepting Skookum  Jim and Taglish Charlie, two Siwah Indians who were with Carmack when  the strike was made. Also, if you care for the romantic, he was in love  with Belinda Mulrooney, the most courageous woman who ever came into  the north.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why was she courageous?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because she came alone into a man's land, without a soul to fight  for her, determined to make a fortune along with the others. And she  did. As long as there is a Dawson sour-dough alive, he will remember  Belinda Mulrooney.&#8221;
  &#8220;She proved what a woman could do, Mr. Holt.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and a little later she proved how foolish a woman can be, Miss  Standish. She became the richest woman in Dawson. Then came a man who  posed as a count, Belinda married him, and they went to Paris.<I> Finis</I>, I think. Now, if she had married Stampede Smith over there, with his  big whiskers&#8212;&#8221;
  He did not finish. Half a dozen paces from them a man had risen from  a table and was facing them. There was nothing unusual about him,  except his boldness as he looked at Mary Standish. It was as if he knew  her and was deliberately insulting her in a stare that was more than  impudent in its directness. Then a sudden twist came to his lips; he  shrugged his shoulders slightly and turned away.
  Alan glanced swiftly at his companion. Her lips were compressed, and  her cheeks were flaming hotly. Even then, as his own blood boiled, he  could not but observe how beautiful anger made her.
  &#8220;If you will pardon me a moment,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;I shall demand  an explanation.&#8221;
  Her hand linked itself quickly through his arm.
  &#8220;Please don't,&#8221; she entreated. &#8220;It is kind of you, and you are just  the sort of man I should expect to resent a thing like that. But it  would be absurd to notice it. Don't you think so?&#8221;
  In spite of her effort to speak calmly, there was a tremble in her  voice, and Alan was puzzled at the quickness with which the color went  from her face, leaving it strangely white.
  &#8220;I am at your service,&#8221; he replied with a rather cold inclination of  his head. &#8220;But if you were my sister, Miss Standish, I would not allow  anything like that to go unchallenged.&#8221;
  He watched the stranger until he disappeared through a door out upon  the deck.
  &#8220;One of John Graham's men,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A fellow named Rossland, going  up to get a final grip on the salmon fishing, I understand. They'll  choke the life out of it in another two years. Funny what this filthy  stuff we call money can do, isn't it? Two winters ago I saw whole  Indian villages starving, and women and little children dying by the  score because of this John Graham's money. Over-fishing did it, you  understand. If you could have seen some of those poor little devils,  just skin and bones, crying for a rag to eat&#8212;&#8221;
  Her hand clutched at his arm. &#8220;How could John Graham&#8212;do that?&#8221; she  whispered.
  He laughed unpleasantly. &#8220;When you have been a year in Alaska you  won't ask that question, Miss Standish.<I> How</I>? Why, simply by  glutting his canneries and taking from the streams the food supply  which the natives have depended upon for generations. In other words,  the money he handles represents the fish trust&#8212;and many other things.  Please don't misunderstand me. Alaska needs capital for its  development. Without it we will not only cease to progress; we will  die. No territory on the face of the earth offers greater opportunities  for capital than Alaska does today. Ten thousand fortunes are waiting  to be made here by men who have money to invest.
  &#8220;But John Graham does not represent the type we want. He is a  despoiler, one of those whose only desire is to turn original resource  into dollars as fast as he can, even though those operations make both  land and water barren. You must remember until recently the government  of Alaska as manipulated by Washington politicians was little better  than that against which the American colonies rebelled in 1776. A hard  thing for one to say about the country he loves, isn't it? And John  Graham stands for the worst&#8212;he and the money which guarantees his  power.
  &#8220;As a matter of fact, big and legitimate capital is fighting shy of  Alaska. Conditions are such, thanks to red-tapeism and bad politics,  that capital, big and little, looks askance at Alaska and cannot be  interested. Think of it, Miss Standish! There are thirty-eight separate  bureaus at Washington operating on Alaska, five thousand miles away. Is  it a wonder the patient is sick? And is it a wonder that a man like  John Graham, dishonest and corrupt to the soul, has a fertile field to  work in?
  &#8220;But we are progressing. We are slowly coming out from under the  shadow which has so long clouded Alaska's interests. There is now a  growing concentration of authority and responsibility. Both the  Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture now  realize that Alaska is a mighty empire in itself, and with their help  we are bound to go ahead in spite of all our handicaps. It is men like  John Graham I fear. Some day&#8212;&#8221;
  Suddenly he caught himself. &#8220;There&#8212;I'm talking politics, and I  should entertain you with pleasanter and more interesting things,&#8221; he  apologized. &#8220;Shall we go to the lower decks?&#8221;
  &#8220;Or the open air,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;I am afraid this smoke is  upsetting me.&#8221;
  He could feel the change in her and did not attribute it entirely to  the thickness of the air. Rossland's inexplicable rudeness had  disturbed her more deeply than she had admitted, he believed.
  &#8220;There are a number of Thlinkit Indians and a tame bear down in what  we should ordinarily call the steerage. Would you like to see them?&#8221; he  asked, when they were outside. &#8220;The Thlinkit girls are the prettiest  Indian women in the world, and there are two among those below who  are&#8212;well&#8212;unusually good-looking, the Captain says.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he has already made me acquainted with them,&#8221; she laughed  softly. &#8220;Kolo and Haidah are the girls. They are sweet, and I love  them. I had breakfast with them this morning long before you were  awake.&#8221;
  &#8220;The deuce you say! And that is why you were not at table? And the  morning before&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You noticed my absence?&#8221; she asked demurely.
  &#8220;It was difficult for me not to see an empty chair. On second  thought, I think the young engineer called my attention to it by  wondering if you were ill.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
  &#8220;He is very much interested in you, Miss Standish. It amuses me to  see him torture the corners of his eyes to look at you. I have thought  it would be only charity and good-will to change seats with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;In which event, of course, your eyes would not suffer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have they ever suffered?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think not.&#8221;
  &#8220;When looking at the Thlinkit girls, for instance?&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't seen them.&#8221;
  She gave her shoulders a little shrug.
  &#8220;Ordinarily I would think you most uninteresting, Mr. Holt. As it is  I think you unusual. And I rather like you for it. Would you mind  taking me to my cabin? It is number sixteen, on this deck.&#8221;
  She walked with her fingers touching his arm again. &#8220;What is your  room?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;Twenty-seven, Miss Standish.&#8221;
  &#8220;This deck?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  Not until she had said good night, quietly and without offering him  her hand, did the intimacy of her last questions strike him. He grunted  and lighted a fresh cigar. A number of things occurred to him all at  once, as he slowly made a final round or two of the deck. Then he went  to his cabin and looked over papers which were going ashore at Juneau.  These were memoranda giving an account of his appearance with Carl  Lomen before the Ways and Means Committee at Washington.
  It was nearly midnight when he had finished. He wondered if Mary  Standish was asleep. He was a little irritated, and slightly amused, by  the recurring insistency with which his mind turned to her. She was a  clever girl, he admitted. He had asked her nothing about herself, and  she had told him nothing, while he had been quite garrulous. He was a  little ashamed when he recalled how he had unburdened his mind to a  girl who could not possibly be interested in the political affairs of  John Graham and Alaska. Well, it was not entirely his fault. She had  fairly catapulted herself upon him, and he had been decent under the  circumstances, he thought.
  He put out his light and stood with his face at the open port-hole.  Only the soft throbbing of the vessel as she made her way slowly  through the last of the Narrows into Frederick Sound came to his ears.  The ship, at last, was asleep. The moon was straight overhead, no  longer silhouetting the mountains, and beyond its misty rim of light  the world was dark. Out of this darkness, rising like a deeper shadow,  Alan could make out faintly the huge mass of Kupreanof Island. And he  wondered, knowing the perils of the Narrows in places scarcely wider  than the length of the ship, why Captain Rifle had chosen this course  instead of going around by Cape Decision. He could feel that the land  was more distant now, but the<I> Nome</I> was still pushing ahead under  slow bell, and he could smell the fresh odor of kelp, and breathe  deeply of the scent of forests that came from both east and west.
  Suddenly his ears became attentive to slowly approaching footsteps.  They seemed to hesitate and then advanced; he heard a subdued voice, a  man's voice&#8212;and in answer to it a woman's. Instinctively he drew a  step back and stood unseen in the gloom. There was no longer a sound of  voices. In silence they walked past his window, clearly revealed to him  in the moonlight. One of the two was Mary Standish. The man was  Rossland, who had stared at her so boldly in the smoking-room.
  Amazement gripped Alan. He switched on his light and made his final  arrangements for bed. He had no inclination to spy upon either Mary  Standish or Graham's agent, but he possessed an inborn hatred of fraud  and humbug, and what he had seen convinced him that Mary Standish knew  more about Rossland than she had allowed him to believe. She had not  lied to him. She had said nothing at all&#8212;except to restrain him from  demanding an apology. Evidently she had taken advantage of him, but  beyond that fact her affairs had nothing to do with his own business in  life. Possibly she and Rossland had quarreled, and now they were making  up. Quite probable, he thought. Silly of him to think over the matter  at all.
  So he put out his light again and went to bed. But he had no great  desire to sleep. It was pleasant to lie there, flat on his back, with  the soothing movement of the ship under him, listening to the musical  thrum of it. And it was pleasant to think of the fact that he was going  home. How infernally long those seven months had been, down in the  States! And how he had missed everyone he had ever known&#8212;even his  enemies!
  He closed his eyes and visualized the home that was still thousands  of miles away&#8212;the endless tundras, the blue and purple foothills of  the Endicott Mountains, and &#8220;Alan's Range&#8221; at the beginning of them.  Spring was breaking up there, and it was warm on the tundras and the  southern slopes, and the pussy-willow buds were popping out of their  coats like corn from a hopper.
  He prayed God the months had been kind to his people&#8212;the people of  the range. It was a long time to be away from them, when one loved them  as he did. He was sure that Tautuk and Amuk Toolik, his two chief  herdsmen, would care for things as well as himself. But much could  happen in seven months. Nawadlook, the little beauty of his distant  kingdom, was not looking well when he left. He was worried about her.  The pneumonia of the previous winters had left its mark. And Keok, her  rival in prettiness! He smiled in the darkness, wondering how Tautuk's  sometimes hopeless love affair had progressed. For Keok was a little  heart-breaker and had long reveled in Tautuk's sufferings. An archangel  of iniquity, Alan thought, as he grinned&#8212;but worth any man's risk of  life, if he had but a drop of brown blood in him! As for his herds,  they had undoubtedly fared well. Ten thousand head was something to be  proud of&#8212;
  Suddenly he drew in his breath and listened. Someone was at his door  and had paused there. Twice he had heard footsteps outside, but each  time they had passed. He sat up, and the springs of his berth made a  sound under him. He heard movement then, a swift, running movement&#8212;and  he switched on his light. A moment later he opened the door. No one was  there. The long corridor was empty. And then&#8212;a distance away&#8212;he heard  the soft opening and closing of another door.
  It was then that his eyes saw a white, crumpled object on the floor.  He picked it up and reentered his room. It was a woman's handkerchief.  And he had seen it before. He had admired the pretty laciness of it  that evening in the smoking-room. Rather curious, he thought, that he  should now find it at his door.
