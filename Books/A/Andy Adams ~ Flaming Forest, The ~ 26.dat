  Into the stream Carrigan plunged and found it only waist-deep in   crossing. He saw where Black Roger had come out of the water and   where his feet had plowed deep in the ash and char and smoldering   debris ahead. This trail he followed. The air he breathed was hot  and  filled with stifling clouds of ash and char-dust and smoke.  His feet  struck red-hot embers under the ash, and he smelled  burning leather. A  forest of spruce and cedar skeletons still  crackled and snapped and  burst out into sudden tongues of flame  about him, and the air he  breathed grew hotter, and his face  burned, and into his eyes came a  smarting pain&#8212;when ahead of him  he saw Black Roger. He was no longer  calling out the Broken Man's  name, but was crashing through the  smoking chaos like a great  beast that had gone both blind and mad.  Twice David turned aside  where Black Roger had rushed through burning  debris, and a third  time, following where Audemard had gone, his feet  felt the sudden  stab of living coals. In another moment he would have  shouted  Black Roger's name, but even as the words were on his lips,   mingled with a gasp of pain, the giant river-man stopped where the   forest seemed suddenly to end in a ghostly, smoke-filled space,  and  when David came up behind him, he was standing at the black  edge of a  cliff which leaped off into a smoldering valley below. 
  Out of this narrow valley between two ridges, an hour ago choked   with living spruce and cedar, rose up a swirling, terrifying heat.   Down into this pit of death Black Roger stood looking, and David   heard a strange moaning coming in his breath. His great, bare arms   were black and scarred with heat; his hair was burned; his shirt  was  torn from his shoulders. When David spoke&#8212;and Black Roger  turned at  the sound&#8212;his eyes glared wildly out of a face that was  like a black  mask. And when he saw it was David who had spoken,  his great body  seemed to sag, and with an unintelligible cry he  pointed down. 
  David, staring, saw nothing with his half-blind eyes, but under   his feet he felt a sudden giving way, and the fire-eaten tangle of   earth and roots broke off like a rotten ledge, and with it both he   and Black Roger went crashing into the depths below, smothered in  an  avalanche of ash and sizzling earth. At the bottom David lay  for a  moment, partly stunned. Then his fingers clutched a bit of  living  fire, and with a savage cry he staggered to his feet and  looked to see  Black Roger. For a space his eyes were blinded, and  when at last he  could see, he made out Black Roger, fifty feet  away, dragging himself  on his hands and knees through the  blistering muck of the fire. And  then, as he stared, the stricken  giant came to the charred remnant of  a stump and crumpled over it  with a great cry, moaning again that  name&#8212; 
  &quot;Andre&#8212;Andre&#8212;&quot; 
  David hurried to him, and as he put his hands under Black Roger's   arms to help him to his feet, he saw that the charred stump was  not a  stump, but the fire-shriveled corpse of Andre, the Broken  Man! 
  Horror choked back speech on his own lips. Black Roger looked up   at him, and a great breath came in a sob out of his body. Then,   suddenly, he seemed to get grip of himself, and his burned and   bleeding fingers closed about David's hand at his shoulder. 
  &quot;I knew he was coming here,&quot; he said, the words forcing themselves   with an effort through his swollen lips. &quot;He came home&#8212;to die.&quot; 
  &quot;Home&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. His mother and father were buried here nearly thirty years   ago, and he worshiped them. Look at him, Carrigan. Look at him   closely. For he is the man you have wanted all these years, the   finest man God ever made, Roger Audemard! When he saw the fire, he   came to shield their graves from the flames. And now he is dead!&quot; 
  A moan came to his lips, and the weight of his body grew so heavy   that David had to exert his strength to keep him from falling. 
  &quot;And YOU?&quot; he cried. &quot;For God's sake, Audemard&#8212;tell me&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I, m'sieu? Why, I am only St. Pierre Audemard, his brother.&quot; 
  And with that his head dropped heavily, and he was like a dead man   in David's arms. 
  How at last David came to the edge of the stream again, with the   weight of St. Pierre Audemard on his shoulders, was a torturing   nightmare which would never be quite clear in his brain. The  details  were obliterated in the vast agony of the thing. He knew  that he  fought as he had never fought before; that he stumbled  again and again  in the fire-muck; that he was burned, and blinded,  and his brain was  sick. But he held to St. Pierre, with his  twisted, broken leg, knowing  that he would die if he dropped him  into the flesh-devouring heat of  the smoldering debris under his  feet. Toward the end he was conscious  of St. Pierre's moaning, and  then of his voice speaking to him. After  that he came to the water  and fell down in the edge of it with St.  Pierre, and inside his  head everything went as black as the world over  which the fire had  swept. 
  He did not know how terribly he was hurt. He did not feel pain   after the darkness came. Yet he sensed certain things. He knew  that  over him St. Pierre was shouting. For days, it seemed, he  could hear  nothing but that great voice bellowing away in the  interminable  distance. And then came other voices, now near and  now far, and after  that he seemed to rise up and float among the  clouds, and for a long  time he heard no other sound and felt no  movement, but was like one  dead. 
  Something soft and gentle and comforting roused him out of   darkness. He did not move, he did not open his eyes for a time,  while  reason came to him. He heard a voice, and it was a woman's  voice,  speaking softly, and another voice replied to it. Then he  heard gentle  movement, and some one went away from him, and he  heard the almost  noiseless opening and closing of a door. A very  little he began to  see. He was in a room, with a patch of sunlight  on the wall. Also, he  was in a bed. And that gentle, comforting  hand was still stroking his  forehead and hair, light as  thistledown. He opened his eyes wider and  looked up. His heart  gave a great throb. Over him was a glorious,  tender face smiling  like an angel into his widening eyes. And it was  the face of  Carmin Fanchet! 
  He made an effort, as if to speak. 
  &quot;Hush,&quot; she whispered, and he saw something shining in her eyes,   and something wet fell upon his face. &quot;She is returning&#8212;and I  will  go. For three days and nights she has not slept, and she must  be the  first to see you open your eyes.&quot; 
  She bent over him. Her soft lips touched his forehead, and he   heard her sobbing breath. 
  &quot;God bless you, David Carrigan!&quot; 
  Then she was going to the door, and his eyes dropped shut again.   He began to experience pain now, a hot, consuming pain all over  him,  and he remembered the fight through the path of the fire.  Then the  door opened very softly once more, and some one came in,  and knelt  down at his side, and was so quiet that she scarcely  seemed to  breathe. He wanted to open his eyes, to cry out a name,  but he waited,  and lips soft as velvet touched his own. They lay  there for a moment,  then moved to his closed eyes, his forehead,  his hair&#8212;and after that  something rested gently against him. 
  His eyes shot open. It was Marie-Anne, with her head nestled in   the crook of his arm as she knelt there beside him on the floor.  He  could see only a bit of her face, but her hair was very near,  crumpled  gloriously on his breast, and he could see the tips of  her long lashes  as she remained very still, seeming not to  breathe. She did not know  he had roused from his sleep&#8212;the first  sleep of those three days of  torture which he could not remember  now; and he, looking at her, made  no movement to tell her he was  awake. One of his hands lay over the  edge of the bed, and so  lightly he could scarce feel the weight of her  fingers she laid  one of her own upon it, and a little at a time drew  it to her,  until the bandaged thing was against her lips. It was  strange she  did not hear his heart, which seemed all at once to beat  like a  drum inside him! 
  Suddenly he sensed the fact that his other hand was not bandaged.   He was lying on his side, with his right arm partly under him, and   against that hand he felt the softness of Marie-Anne's cheek, the   velvety crush of her hair! 
  And then he whispered, &quot;Marie-Anne&#8212;&quot; 
  She still lay, for a moment, utterly motionless. Then, slowly, as   if believing he had spoken her name in his sleep, she raised her  head  and looked into his wide-open eyes. There was no word between  them in  that breath or two. His bandaged hand and his well hand  went to her  face and hair, and then a sobbing cry came from Marie-  Anne, and  swiftly she crushed her face down to his, holding him  close with both  her arms for a moment. And after that, as on that  other day when she  kissed him after the fight, she was up and gone  so quickly that her  name had scarcely left his lips when the door  closed behind her, and  he heard her running down the hall. 
  He called after her, &quot;Marie-Anne! Marie-Anne!&quot; 
  He heard another door, and voices, and quick footsteps again,   coming his way, and he was waiting eagerly, half on his elbow,  when  into his room came Nepapinas and Carmin Fanchet. And again he  saw the  glory of something in the woman's face. 
  His eyes must have burned strangely as he stared at her, but it   did not change that light in her own, and her hands were  wonderfully  gentle as she helped Nepapinas raise him so that he  was sitting up  straight, with pillows at his back. 
  &quot;It doesn't hurt so much now, does it?&quot; she asked, her voice low   with a mothering tenderness. 
  He shook his head. &quot;No. What is the matter?&quot; 
  &quot;You were burned&#8212;terribly. For two days and nights you were in   great pain, but for many hours you have been sleeping, and  Nepapinas  says the burns will not hurt any more. If it had not  been for you&#8212;&quot; 
  She bent over him. Her hand touched his face, and now he began to   understand the meaning of that glory shining in her eyes. 
  &quot;If it hadn't been for you&#8212;he would have died!&quot; 
  She drew back, turning to the door. &quot;He is coming to see you&#8212;   alone,&quot; she said, a little broken note in her throat. &quot;And I pray  God  you will see with clear understanding, David Carrigan&#8212;and  forgive  me&#8212;as I have forgiven you&#8212;for a thing that happened long  ago.&quot; 
  He waited. His head was in a jumble, and his thoughts were   tumbling over one another in an effort to evolve some sort of   coherence out of things amazing and unexpected. One thing was   impressed upon him&#8212;he had saved St. Pierre's life, and because he   had done this Carmin Fanchet was very tender to him. She had  kissed  him, and Marie-Anne had kissed him, and&#8212; 
  A strange dawning was coming to him, thrilling him to his finger-   tips. He listened. A new sound was approaching from the hall. His   door was opened, and a wheel-chair was rolled in by old Nepapinas.  In  the chair was St. Pierre Audemard. Feet and hands and arms were   wrapped in bandages, but his face was uncovered and wreathed in   smiling happiness when he saw David propped up against his  pillows.  Nepapinas rolled him close to the bed and then shuffled  out, and as he  closed the door, David was sure he heard the  subdued whispering of  feminine voices down the hall. 
  &quot;How are you, David?&quot; asked St. Pierre. 
  &quot;Fine,&quot; nodded Carrigan. &quot;And you?&quot; 
  &quot;A bit scorched, and a broken leg.&quot; He held up his padded hands.   &quot;Would be dead if you hadn't carried me to the river. Carmin says  she  owes you her life for having saved mine.&quot; 
  &quot;And Marie-Anne?&quot; 
  &quot;That's what I've come to tell you about,&quot; said St. Pierre. &quot;The   instant they knew you were able to listen, both Carmin and Marie-   Anne insisted that I come and tell you things. But if you don't  feel  well enough to hear me now&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Go on!&quot; almost threatened David. 
  The look of cheer which had illumined St. Pierre's face faded   away, and David saw in its place the lines of sorrow which had   settled there. He turned his gaze toward a window through which  the  afternoon sun was coming, and nodded slowly. 
  &quot;You saw&#8212;out there. He's dead. They buried him in a casket made   of sweet cedar. He loved the smell of that. He was like a little   child. And once&#8212;a long time ago&#8212;he was a splendid man, a greater   and better man than St. Pierre, his brother, will ever be. What he   did was right and just, M'sieu David. He was the oldest&#8212;sixteen&#8212;   when the thing happened. I was only nine, and didn't fully   understand. But he saw it all&#8212;the death of our father because a   powerful factor wanted my mother. And after that he knew how and  why  our mother died, but not a word of it did he tell us until  years  later&#8212;after the day of vengeance was past. 
  &quot;You understand, David? He didn't want me in that. He did it   alone, with good friends from the upper north. He killed the   murderers of our mother and father, and then he buried himself  deeper  into the forests with us, and we took our mother's family  names which  was Boulain, and settled here on the Yellowknife.  Roger&#8212;Black Roger,  as you know him&#8212;brought the bones of our  father and mother and buried  them over in the edge of that plain  where he died and where our first  cabin stood. Five years ago a  falling tree crushed him out of shape,  and his mind went at the  same time, so that he has been like a little  child, and was always  seeking for Roger Audemard&#8212;the man he once was.  That was the man  your law wanted. Roger Audemard. Our brother,&quot; 
  &quot;OUR brother,&quot; cried David. &quot;Who is the other?&quot; 
  &quot;My sister.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes?&quot; 
  &quot;Marie-Anne.&quot; 
  &quot;Good God!&quot; choked David. &quot;St. Pierre, do you lie? Is this another   bit of trickery?&quot; 
  &quot;It is the truth,&quot; said St. Pierre. &quot;Marie-Anne is my sister, and   Carmin&#8212;whom you saw in my arms through the cabin window&#8212;&quot; 
  He paused, smiling into David's staring eyes, taking full measure   of recompense in the other's heart-breaking attitude as he waited.   &quot;&#8212;Is my wife, M'sieu David.&quot; 
  A great gasp of breath came out of Carrigan. 
  &quot;Yes, my wife, and the greatest-hearted woman that ever lived,   without one exception in all the world!&quot; cried St. Pierre, a  fierce  pride in his voice. &quot;It was she, and not Marie-Anne, who  shot you on  that strip of sand, David Carrigan! Mon Dieu, I tell  you not one woman  in a million would have done what she did&#8212;let  you live! Why? Listen,  m'sieu, and you will understand at last.  She had a brother, years  younger than she, and to that brother she  was mother, sister,  everything, because they had no parents almost  from babyhood. She  worshiped him. And he was bad. Yet the worse he  became, the more she  loved him and prayed for him. Years ago she  became my wife, and I  fought with her to save the brother. But he  belonged to the devil hand  and foot, and at last he left us and  went south, and became what he  was when you were sent out to get  him, Sergeant Carrigan. It was then  that my wife went down to make  a last fight to save him, to bring him  back, and you know how she  made that fight, m'sieu&#8212;until the day you  hanged him!&quot; 
  St. Pierre was leaning from his chair, his face ablaze. &quot;Tell me,   did she not fight?&quot; he cried. &quot;And YOU, until the last&#8212;did you  not  fight to have her put behind prison bars with her brother?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it is so,&quot; murmured Carrigan. 
  &quot;She hated you,&quot; went on St. Pierre. &quot;You hanged her brother, who   was almost a part of her flesh and body. He was bad, but he had  been  hers from babyhood, and a mother will love her son if he is a  devil.  And then&#8212;I won't take long to tell the rest of it! Through  friends  she learned that you, who had hanged her brother, were on  your way to  run down Roger Audemard. And Roger Audemard, mind you,  was the same as  myself, for I had sworn to take my brother's place  if it became  necessary. She was on the bateau with Marie-Anne when  the messenger  came. She had but one desire&#8212;to save me&#8212;to kill  you. If it had been  some other man, but it was you, who had hanged  her brother! She  disappeared from the bateau that day with a  rifle. You know, M'sieu  David, what happened. Marie-Anne heard the  shooting and  came&#8212;alone&#8212;just as you rolled out in the sand as if  dead. It was she  who ran out to you first, while my Carmin  crouched there with her  rifle, ready to send another bullet into  you if you moved. It was  Marie-Anne you saw standing over you, it  was she who knelt down at  your side, and then&#8212;&quot; 
  St. Pierre paused, and he smiled, and then grimaced as he tried to   rub his two bandaged hands together. &quot;David, fate mixes things up  in  a funny way. My Carmin came out and stood over you, hating you;  and  Marie-Anne knelt down there at your side, loving you. Yes, it  is true.  And over you they fought for life or death, and love won,  because it  is always stronger than hate. Besides, as you lay there  bleeding and  helpless, you looked different to my Carmin than as  you did when you  hanged her brother. So they dragged you up under  a tree, and after  that they plotted together and planned, while I  was away up the river  on the raft. The feminine mind works  strangely, M'sieu David, and  perhaps it was that thing we call  intuition which made them do what  they did. Marie-Anne knew it  would never do for you to see and  recognize my Carmin, so in their  scheming of things she insisted on  passing herself off as my wife,  while my Carmin came back in a canoe  to meet me. They were  frightened, and when I came, the whole thing had  gone too far for  me to mend, and I knew the false game must be played  out to the  end. When I saw what was happening&#8212;that you loved  Marie-Anne so  well that you were willing to fight for her honor even  when you  thought she was my wife&#8212;I was sure it would all end well.  But I  could take no chances until I knew. And so there were bars at  your  windows, and&#8212;&quot; 
  St. Pierre shrugged his shoulders, and the lines of grief came   into his face again, and in his voice was a little break as he   continued: &quot;If Roger had not gone out there to fight back the  flames  from the graves of his dead, I had planned to tell you as  much as I  dared, M'sieu David, and I had faith that your love for  our sister  would win. I did not tell you on the river because I  wanted you to see  with your own eyes our paradise up here, and I  knew you would not  destroy it once you were a part of it. And so I  could not tell you  Carmin was my wife, for that would have  betrayed  us&#8212;and&#8212;besides&#8212;that fight of yours against a love  which you thought  was dishonest interested me very much, for I saw  in it a wonderful  test of the man who might become my brother if  he chose wisely between  love and what he thought was duty. I loved  you for it, even when you  sat me there on the sand like a silly  loon. And now, even my Carmin  loves you for bringing me out of the  fire&#8212;But you are not listening!&quot; 
  David was looking past him toward the door, and St. Pierre smiled   when he saw the look that was in his face. 
  &quot;Nepapinas!&quot; he called loudly. &quot;Nepapinas!&quot; 
  In a moment there was shuffling of feet outside, and Nepapinas   came in. St. Pierre held out his two great, bandaged hands, and  David  met them with his own, one bandaged and one free. Not a word  was  spoken between them, but their eyes were the eyes of men  between whom  had suddenly come the faith and understanding of a  brotherhood as  strong as life itself. 
  Then Nepapinas wheeled St. Pierre from the room and David   straightened himself against his pillows, and waited, and  listened,  until it seemed two hearts were thumping inside him in  the place of  one. 
  It was an interminable time, he thought, before Marie-Anne stood   in the doorway. For a breath she paused there, looking at him as  he  stretched out his bandaged arm to her, moved by every yearning  impulse  in her soul to come in, yet ready as a bird to fly away.  And then, as  he called her name, she ran to him and dropped upon  her knees at his  side, and his arms went about her, insensible to  their hurt&#8212;and her  hot face was against his neck, and his lips  crushed in the smothering  sweetness of her hair. He made no effort  to speak, beyond that first  calling of her name. He could feel her  heart throbbing against him,  and her hands tightened at his  shoulders, and at last she raised her  glorious face so near that  the breath of it was on his lips. Then,  seeing what was in his  eyes, her soft mouth quivered in a little  smile, and with a broken  throb in her throat she whispered, 
  &quot;Has it all ended&#8212;right&#8212;David?&quot; 
  He drew the red mouth to his own, and with a glad cry which was no   word in itself he buried his face in the lustrous tresses he  loved.  Afterward he could not remember all it was that he said,  but at the  end Marie-Anne had drawn a little away so that she was  looking at him,  her eyes shining gloriously and her cheeks  beautiful as the petals of  a wild rose. And he could see the  throbbing in her white throat, like  the beating of a tiny heart. 
  &quot;And you'll take me with you?&quot; she whispered joyously. 
  &quot;Yes; and when I show you to the old man&#8212;Superintendent Me Vane,   you know&#8212;and tell him you're my wife, he can't go back on his   promise. He said if I settled this Roger Audemard affair, I could   have anything I might ask for. And I'll ask for my discharge, I  ought  to have it in September, and that will give us time to  return before  the snow flies. You see&#8212;&quot; 
  He held out his arms again. &quot;You see,&quot; he cried, his face   smothered in her hair again, &quot;I've found the place of my dreams up   here, and I want to stay&#8212;always. Are you a little glad, Marie-   Anne?&quot; 
  In a great room at the end of the hall, with windows opening in   three directions upon the wilderness, St. Pierre waited in his   wheel-chair, grunting uneasily now and then at the long time it  was  taking Carmin to discover certain things out in the hall.  Finally he  heard her coming, tiptoeing very quietly from the  direction of David  Carrigan's door, and St. Pierre chuckled and  tried to rub his bandaged  hands when she came in, her face pink  and her eyes shining with the  greatest thrill that can stir a  feminine heart. 
  &quot;If we'd only known,&quot; he tried to whisper, &quot;I would have had the   keyhole made larger, Cherie! He deserves it for having spied on us  at  the cabin window. But&#8212;tell me!&#8212;Could you see? Did you hear?  What&#8212;&quot; 
  Carmin's soft hand went over his mouth. &quot;In another moment you'll   be shouting,&quot; she warned. &quot;Maybe I didn't see, and maybe I didn't   hear, Big Bear&#8212;but I know there are four very happy people in   Chateau Boulain. And now, if you want to guess who is the  happiest&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I am, chere-coeur.&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, then, if you insist&#8212;YOU are.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. And the next?&quot; 
  St. Pierre chuckled. &quot;David Carrigan,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;No, no, no! If you mean that&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I mean&#8212;always&#8212;that I am second, unless you will ever let me be   first,&quot; corrected St. Pierre, kissing the hand that was gently   stroking his cheek. 
  And then he leaned his great head back against her where she stood   behind him, and Carmin's fingers ran where his hair was crisp with   the singe of fire, and for a long time they said no other word,  but  let their eyes rest upon the dim length of the hall at the far  end of  which was David Carrigan's room.
