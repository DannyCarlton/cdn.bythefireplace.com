The spare Professor, grave and bald,<br> Began his paper. It was called,<br> I think, "A Brief Historic Glance<br> At Russia, Germany, and France."<br> A glance, but to my best belief<br> 'Twas almost anything but brief--<br> A wide survey, in which the earth<br> Was seen before mankind had birth;<br> Strange monsters basked them in the sun,<br> Behemoth, armored glyptodon,<br> And in the dawn's unpractised ray<br> The transient dodo winged its way;<br> Then, by degrees, through silt and slough,<br> We reached Berlin--I don't know how.<br> The good Professor's monotone<br> Had turned me into senseless stone<br> Instanter, but that near me sat<br> Hypatia in her new spring hat,<br> Blue-eyed, intent, with lips whose bloom<br> Lighted the heavy-curtained room.<br> Hypatia--ah, what lovely things<br> Are fashioned out of eighteen springs!<br> At first, in sums of this amount,<br> The eighteen winters do not count.<br> Just as my eyes were growing dim<br> With heaviness, I saw that slim,<br> Erect, elastic figure there,<br> Like a pond-lily taking air.<br> She looked so fresh, so wise, so neat,<br> So altogether crisp and sweet,<br> I quite forgot what Bismarck said,<br> And why the Emperor shook his head,<br> And how it was Von Moltke's frown<br> Cost France another frontier town.<br> The only facts I took away<br> From the Professor's theme that day<br> Were these: a forehead broad and low,<br> Such as the antique sculptures show;<br> A chin to Greek perfection true;<br> Eyes of Astarte's tender blue;<br> A high complexion without fleck<br> Or flaw, and curls about her neck.
