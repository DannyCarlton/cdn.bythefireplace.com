  Herbert left the counting-room of Godfrey Lynn, not a little  depressed  in spirits. The two days which must elapse before he could  see Mr.  Godfrey were to him a formidable delay. By that time his money  would be  almost exhausted. Then, suppose, which was very probable, Mr.  Godfrey  could do nothing for him immediately, but only hold out his  promise of  future assistance, how was he to live in the meantime?  After all, he  might have to realize his thought of the morning, and  join the ranks of  the bootblacks. That was not a pleasant thought to a  boy of his  education. All labor is honorable, to be sure, but, then,  some  occupations are more congenial than others. 
  If Greenleaf had not robbed him so basely, he could have afforded  to  wait. He felt sore and indignant about that. Nobody likes to own  that he  has been victimized, but Herbert was obliged to confess to  himself that  such was the case with him. 
  He walked about rather aimlessly, feeling miserable enough. But,  all at  once, it occurred to him, &quot;Would it not be cheaper for him to  take board  by the week in some boarding-house?&quot; Reckoning up, he found  that his  hotel bill would be three dollars and a half a week, while  his meals,  even if he were quite abstemious, would make as much more;  in all, seven  dollars. Surely, he could be boarded somewhere for less  than that. 
  In the reading-room of the hotel he found a daily paper, and  carefully  ran his eye down the advertisements for boarders and  lodgers. The  following attracted his attention: 
  &quot;BOARDERS WANTED.&#8212;A few mechanics may obtain comfortable rooms and   board at No. &#8212;&#8212; Stanton Street, at three dollars per week.&quot; 
  This, be it remembered, was previous to the war, and before the  price of  board had doubled. 
  &quot;Three dollars a week!&quot; repeated Herbert. &quot;Less than half my  present  rate of expense. I must go at once and secure it.&quot; 
  He found the way to Stanton Street, and found that No. &#8212;&#8212; was a   shabby-looking house in a shabby neighborhood. But he could not afford   to be fastidious. He accordingly stepped up without hesitation, and  rang  the bell, which emitted a shrill sound in reply. 
  A middle-aged woman, with a red handkerchief tied around her head,  and a  broom in her hand, opened the door and looked inquiringly at our  hero. 
  &quot;What's wanted?&quot; she said. 
  &quot;I saw your advertisement for boarders,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Yes; I advertised in the paper this morning.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you let me see your rooms?&quot; 
  &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot; 
  &quot;Myself.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know as you'll be suited. My price is low, and I can't  give  first-class accommodations for three dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;No; I suppose not.&quot; 
  &quot;Come up, if you would like to see what I've got.&quot; 
  The interior of the house was shabby like the outside, the oilcloth   carpet faded, and the wall paper torn off in places. The stairs, too,   were narrow and uncarpeted. All this Herbert observed, but he could  not  afford to be critical. 
  On the third floor, his guide threw open the door of a dark, little  hall  bedroom, meagerly furnished. 
  &quot;I could give you this room by yourself,&quot; she said, &quot;or a larger  room  with someone else.&quot; 
  &quot;I would rather be alone.&quot; 
  &quot;That's the only single room I have. Will you take it?&quot; 
  &quot;I think so,&quot; said Herbert, though he did not anticipate much  enjoyment  in such a poor place. 
  &quot;When do you want to come?&quot; 
  &quot;To-morrow morning.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well. I shall expect a deposit, so that I may be sure the  room is  let.&quot; 
  &quot;How much?&quot; 
  &quot;A dollar will do.&quot; 
  Herbert drew a dollar from his pocket, and handed it to Mrs.  Morgan, for  such, she informed him, was her name. 
  Then he went downstairs and out into the air again. 
  &quot;Well,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I'm sure of a home, such as it is, for  a  week. In that time something must turn up.&quot; 
  Examining his pocketbook he found that he had two dollars and a  half  left. Of that sum, two dollars must be reserved to pay the  balance of  his week's board. Out of the remaining fifty cents he must  pay for his  meals until the next morning, when he would take  possession of his new  boarding place. He wished that he had proposed  to come to breakfast, but  it was too late now. 
  With such a small sum in hand, he could not afford to dine on the  same  magnificent scale as he had breakfasted, but he must be rigidly   economical. He decided that the cheapest food he could buy was a five-   cent loaf at some baker's. This would probably last him through the  day,  and might prove sufficient for breakfast also, since he would  take a  regular dinner, though he doubted, from what he had seen of the   establishment in Stanton Street, whether it would be a very inviting   repast. But it was the best he could afford, and that was all he need   consider. 
  Late in the afternoon, it occurred to Herbert to wonder where, in  the  city, his Uncle Stanton lived. Not that he had any intention of  applying  to him for assistance, even if matters came to a crisis, but  he felt a  natural curiosity as to how his uncle was situated. He found  the  directory readily, and, turning to the letter S, ran down the list  of  names till he came to Stanton, Benjamin. 
  He learned that his uncle's store was in the lower part of  Broadway,  while his house was in West Seventeenth Street, between  Fifth and Sixth  Avenues. 
  &quot;I should like to see what sort of a house Uncle Benjamin lives  in,&quot;  thought Herbert. 
  There was nothing to prevent his gratifying this wish, as he had  plenty  of time on his hands. If he had had more money, he would have  taken the  horse cars, but in his present circumstances this would be  imprudent. He  decided, as it was only five o'clock, to take a  leisurely walk up  Broadway, noticing his uncle's place of business on  the way. 
  A few minutes brought him in front of the latter&#8212;an  imposing-looking  building, with all the appearance of belonging to a  prosperous merchant.  Appearances are deceitful, to be sure, and no  doubt there are some  merchants, as outwardly prosperous, who might  profitably change places  with their head clerks. But Herbert naturally  judged from appearances,  and he could not help contrasting in his mind  his own condition with  that of his uncle's. But he was too manly to be  despondent on this  account, and thought rather, &quot;I am young and ready  to work, Some time,  if I am patient and work hard. I may be as well  off as Uncle Benjamin.&quot;  The thought of applying to him for assistance  was as far off as ever. 
  He pursued his way uptown, finding it a longer walk than he  anticipated,  arriving at half-past five at Union Square. At the upper  end he turned  off, and went down Seventeenth Street. 
  Carefully noting the numbers, he at length found his uncle's house.  It  was a handsome, substantial city mansion, and seemed appropriate as  the  residence of a rich New York merchant. 
  &quot;So my uncle lives here,&quot; thought Herbert, and there rose  involuntarily  in his mind the memory of the humble Western home where  he and his  mother had struggled against poverty, while his uncle, who  was evidently  so amply provided with the world's goods, coldly held  aloof, and forbore  to offer the assistance which he could so well  afford. 
  &quot;If I had a sister, I could never treat her like that,&quot; thought  Herbert,  indignantly. &quot;He would not help my mother. I will starve  before I ask  him to help me.&quot; 
  He paused a moment on the opposite side of the street to look at  his  uncle's house. While he was standing there, a boy of about his own  age,  apparently, came down the street whistling, and ascended the  steps of  his uncle's house. 
  &quot;I wonder if that is my cousin Tom,&quot; thought Herbert. He knew the  names  of his cousins from his mother, though he had never seen them. 
  While he looked, he was struck by something familiar in the  appearance  of this boy. Where had he seen him before? 
  All at once it flashed upon him. It was the same boy he had seen in  the  counting-room of Godfrey He knew him by his dandified dress and  his  face, which he had noticed at the time. 
  This was certainly a strange coincidence, that his cousin, for it  was  doubtless he, should be the first boy he encountered after  reaching New  York. It would be still stranger if Mr. Godfrey should  offer him  employment, and he should find himself a clerk in the same  office as the  son of his rich uncle. But it was by no means certain  that he would be  lucky enough to obtain such employment. Therefore  there was no need of  wondering whether, under such circumstances, Tom  would recognize him as  a relation. 
  Herbert walked thoughtfully back, and on reaching his room ate the   remainder of the loaf which he had purchased at the baker's in the   morning. It was not a very luxurious repast, but his walk had given  him  an appetite, and he had no difficulty in disposing of all that was  left.
