  After the concert, Tom Stanton took even a greater dislike to his  cousin  than before. To say that he was in love with Julia Godfrey  would be  rather ridiculous, considering his youth. Even if he had been  older, Tom  cared too much about himself to fall in love with another.  But Julia had  been a belle among the children of her own age at the  dancing school,  and there was considerable rivalry among the boys&#8212;or,  I should,  perhaps, say young gentlemen&#8212;for the honor of her notice.  Tom desired  it, because it would give him a kind of distinction among  his fellows.  So, though he was not in love with Julia, he was jealous  when she showed  favor to anyone else. But this feeling was mild  compared with that he  experienced when Julia bestowed her notice upon  his penniless cousin.  That Herbert should be preferred to himself, he  thought, not only showed  great lack of taste on the part of the young  heiress, but was a grievous  wrong to himself. 
  &quot;I can't understand how girls can be such fools,&quot; thought Tom, as  that  evening, after returning from the concert, he surveyed his rather   perturbed face in the mirror surmounting his bureau. &quot;I wouldn't have   believed Julia Godfrey would stoop to notice such a pauper.&quot; 
  Then a cheerful thought came to him. Perhaps she was only trying to   rouse his jealousy. He had heard of such things. But, if so, why  should  she choose such a beggar as Herbert to practice her arts upon? 
  Certainly, to an unprejudiced observer, such a thought would never  have  suggested itself. The cool indifference with which Julia had  treated Tom  did not appear to argue any such feeling as would lead to  the attempt to  rouse his jealousy. But, then, Tom was not an  unprejudiced observer, and  considered his personal attractions such  that any girl might appreciate  them. 
  When he arrived at the counting-room the next morning, he found  Herbert  already there. Indeed, our hero was very particular to be  punctual in  his attendance, while Tom was generally at least a quarter  of an hour  behind time. 
  &quot;I saw you at the concert last evening, Mason,&quot; said Tom, who  wanted to  get a chance to say something disagreeable. 
  &quot;Yes, I was there,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;You sat in the row just behind  us.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. I suppose you were never at a concert before.&quot; 
  &quot;Not in New York.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey was very kind to take you.&quot; 
  That was what Herbert thought himself. But as Tom expressed it,  there  was something in his tone which implied a conviction of  Herbert's social  inferiority, which our hero did not like. 
  &quot;I have found Mr. Godfrey very kind,&quot; he said, briefly. 
  There are not many employers who would invite a boy in your  position to  a concert with his family,&quot; said Tom. 
  &quot;I believe my position is the same as yours,&quot; said Herbert,  nettled. 
  &quot;I don't see it,&quot; said Tom, haughtily. &quot;Will you explain yourself?&quot; 
  &quot;I believe we are both in Mr. Godfrey's employ,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Oh, yes, so far as that goes. But I am the son of a rich man,&quot;  said  Tom, pompously. 
  Herbert might have replied that he was the nephew of a rich man,  but he  had no disposition to boast of his relationship to his cousin's  family. 
  &quot;I don't see that that makes any difference,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Don't you? Well, I do.&quot; 
  &quot;We are both boys in Mr. Godfrey's employ.&quot; 
  &quot;That's true, but then, he took you out of pity, you know.&quot; 
  Tom's tone as he said this was very aggravating, and Herbert's face   flushed. 
  &quot;I don't know anything of the sort,&quot; he retorted. 
  &quot;No, I suppose you don't consider it in that light,&quot; said Tom,   carelessly; &quot;but, of course, it is clear enough to others. Where would   you have been, if Mr. Godfrey hadn't given you a place? Blacking  boots,  probably, among the street ragamuffins.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I might,&quot; said Herbert, quietly, &quot;if I couldn't have got   anything better to do.&quot; 
  &quot;It's a very genteel occupation,&quot; sneered Tom. 
  &quot;I don't think it is,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;but it's an honest one.&quot; 
  &quot;You may have to take it yet.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps so. So may you.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you mean to insult me?&quot; demanded Tom, haughtily, his face  flushing. 
  &quot;I only said to you the same thing you said to me. If it's an  insult on  one side, it is on the other.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem to forget that our circumstances are very different,&quot;  said  Tom. 
  &quot;They are just now, so far as money goes. I get a larger salary  than  you.&quot; 
  Tom was very much incensed at this remark, being aggrieved by the  fact  that Herbert received more than he. 
  &quot;I didn't mean that,&quot; said he. &quot;Of course, if Mr. Godfrey chooses  to  give away money in charity, it is none of my business. I don't need  any  charity&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey pays me for my services,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;If he pays me  too  liberally now, I hope to make it up to him afterward.&quot; 
  &quot;You seemed to be very intimate with Julia Godfrey last evening,&quot;  said  Tom, unpleasantly. 
  &quot;I found her very pleasant.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; she is very kind to take notice of you.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose the notice you have taken of me this morning is meant in   kindness,&quot; said Herbert, thinking his cousin very disagreeable. 
  &quot;Yes, of course, being in the same counting-room, I think it right  to  take some notice of you,&quot; said Tom, condescendingly. 
  &quot;I am very much obliged to you,&quot; said Herbert, sarcastically. 
  &quot;But there's one piece of advice I should like to give you,&quot;  proceeded  Tom. 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; inquired Herbert, looking his cousin in the face. 
  &quot;Don't feel too much set up by Julia Godfrey's notice. She only  took  notice of you out of pity, and to encourage you. If you had been  in her  own position in society&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Like you, for instance!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, like me,&quot; said Tom, complacently, &quot;she would have been more   ceremonious. I thought I would just mention it to you, Mason, or you   might not understand it.&quot; 
  It was only natural that Herbert should be provoked by this  elaborate  humiliation suggested by Tom, and his cousin's offensive  assumption of  superiority. This led him to a retort in kind. 
  &quot;I suppose that is the reason she took so little notice of you,&quot; he   said. 
  Tom was nettled at this statement of a fact, but he answered in an  off-  hand manner, &quot;Oh, Julia and I are old friends. I've danced with  her  frequently at dancing school.&quot; 
  Herbert happened to remember what Julia had said of his cousin, and  was  rather amused at this assumption of intimacy. 
  &quot;I am much obliged to you for your information,&quot; said Herbert,  &quot;though I  am rather surprised that you should take so great an  interest in my  affairs.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, you're new in the city, and I know all the ropes,&quot; said Tom.  &quot;I  thought I might as well give you a friendly hint.&quot; 
  &quot;I am lucky in having such a friend,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;and will take  the  advice as it was given.&quot; 
  Here the bookkeeper entered, and, soon after, Mr. Godfrey made his   appearance. 
  &quot;I hope you had a pleasant evening, Herbert,&quot; he said, kindly. 
  &quot;Very pleasant, sir; thank you,&quot; said Herbert, in a very different  tone  from the one he had used in addressing Tom. 
  &quot;I believe I saw you, also, at the concert, Thomas,&quot; said Mr.  Godfrey. 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Tom. &quot;I am very fond of music, and attend all the   first-class musical entertainments&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed?&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, but this was all the reply he made. 
  &quot;My daughter insists that I shall invite you to the house again  soon,&quot;  said Mr. Godfrey, again addressing Herbert. 
  &quot;I am very much obliged to her, and to you, sir,&quot; said Herbert,   modestly. &quot;I shall be very glad to come.&quot; 
  Tom's face darkened, as he heard this. He would have given  considerable  to receive such an invitation himself, but the prospect  did not seem  very promising. 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey must he infatuated,&quot; he said to himself, impatiently,  &quot;to  invite such a beggar to his house. Mason ought to have good sense  enough  to feel that he is out of place in such a house. I wouldn't  accept any  invitation given out of pity.&quot; 
  &quot;I wonder why Tom dislikes me so much?&quot; thought Herbert. &quot;He  certainly  takes pains enough to show his feeling. Would it be  different, I wonder,  if he knew that I was his cousin?&quot; 
  Herbert thought of mentioning to Mr. Godfrey that he had recovered   three-quarters of the money of which he had been robbed. It would have   been well if he had done so, but Mr. Godfrey seemed particularly   engaged, and he thought it best not to interrupt him.
