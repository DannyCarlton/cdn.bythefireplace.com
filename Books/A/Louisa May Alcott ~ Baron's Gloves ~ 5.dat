"I wonder what that young man's name was. Did he mention it, Helen?"  said the major, pausing in his march up and down the room, as if the  question was suggested by the sight of the little baskets, which the  girls had kept.    
"No, uncle; but you can easily ask Hoffman," replied Helen.    
"By the way, Karl, who was the Polish gentleman who came on with  us?" asked the major a moment afterward, as the courier came in with  newspapers.    
"Casimer Teblinski, sir."    
"A baron?" asked Amy, who was decidedly a young lady of one idea just  then.    
"No, mademoiselle, but of a noble family, as the 'ski' denotes, for  that is to Polish and Russian names what 'von' is to German and 'de'  to French."    
"I was rather interested in him. Where did you pick him up, Hoffman?"  said the major.    
"In Paris, where he was with fellow-exiles."    
"He is what he seems, is he?--no impostor, or anything of that sort?  One is often deceived, you know."    
"On my honor, sir, he is a gentleman, and as brave as he is  accomplished and excellent."    
"Will he die?" asked Amy, pathetically.    
"With care he would recover, I think; but there is no one to nurse  him, so the poor lad must take his chance and trust in heaven for  help."    
"How sad! I wish we were going his way, so that we might do something  for him--at least give him the society of his friend."    
Helen glanced at Hoffman, feeling that if he were not already engaged  by them, he would devote himself to the invalid without any thought of  payment.    
"Perhaps we are. You want to see the Lake of Geneva, Chillon, and that  neighborhood. Why not go now, instead of later?"    
"Will you, uncle? That's capital! We need say nothing, but go on and  help the poor boy, if we can."    
Helen spoke like a matron of forty, and looked as full of maternal  kindness as if the Pole were not out of his teens.    
The courier bowed, the major laughed behind his paper, and Amy gave a  sentimental sigh to the memory of the baron, in whom her interest was  failing.    
They only caught a glimpse of the Pole that evening at the Kursaal,  but next morning they met, and he was invited to join their party for  a little expedition.    
The major was in fine spirits, and Helen assumed her maternal air  toward both invalids, for the sound of that hollow cough always  brought a shadow over her face, recalling the brother she had lost.    
Amy was particularly merry and charming, and kept the whole party  laughing at her comical efforts to learn Polish and teach English as  they drove up the mountainside to the old Schloss.    
"I'm not equal to mounting all those steps for a view I've seen a  dozen times; but pray take care of the child, Nell, or she'll get lost  again, as at Heidelberg," said the major, when they had roamed about  the lower part of the place; for a cool seat in the courtyard and a  glass of beer were more tempting than turrets and prospects to the  stout gentleman.    
"She shall not be lost; I am her body-guard. It is steep--permit that  I lead you, mademoiselle;" Casimer offered his hand to Amy, and they  began their winding way. As she took the hand, the girl blushed and  half smiled, remembering the vaults and the baron.    
"I like this better," she said to herself, as they climbed step by  step, often pausing to rest in the embrasures of the loopholes,  where the sun glanced in, the balmy wind blew, and vines peeped from  without, making a pretty picture of the girl, as she sat with rosy  color on her usually pale cheeks, brown curls fluttering about her  forehead, laughing lips, and bright eyes full of pleasant changes.  Leaning opposite in the narrow stairway, Casimer had time to study the  little tableau in many lights, and in spite of the dark glasses,  to convey warm glances of admiration, of which, however, the young  coquette seemed utterly unconscious.    
Helen came leisurely after, and Hoffman followed with a telescope,  wishing, as he went, that his countrywomen possessed such dainty feet  as those going on before him, for which masculine iniquity he will be  pardoned by all who have seen the foot of a German Fraulein.    
It was worth the long ascent, that wide-spread landscape basking in  the August glow.    
Sitting on a fallen block of stone, while Casimer held a sun-umbrella  over her, Amy had raptures at her ease; while Helen sketched and asked  questions of Hoffman, who stood beside her, watching her progress with  interest. Once when, after repeated efforts to catch a curious effect  of light and shade, she uttered an impatient little exclamation, Karl  made a gesture as if to take the pencil and show her, but seemed to  recollect himself and drew back with a hasty "Pardon, mademoiselle."  Helen glanced up and saw the expression of his face, which plainly  betrayed that for a moment the gentleman had forgotten he was a  courier. She was glad of it, for it was a daily trial to her to order  this man about; and following the womanly impulse, she smiled and  offered the pencil, saying simply,--    
"I felt sure you understood it; please show me."    
He did so, and a few masterly strokes gave the sketch what it needed.  As he bent near her to do this Helen stole a glance at the grave, dark  face, and suddenly a disturbed look dawned in the eyes fixed on the  glossy black locks pushed off the courier's forehead, for he had  removed his hat when she spoke to him. He seemed to feel that  something was amiss, shot a quick glance at her, returned the pencil  and rose erect, with an almost defiant air, yet something of shame in  his eye, as his lips moved as if to speak impetuously. But not a word  did he utter, for Helen touched her forehead significantly, and said  in a low tone,--    
"I am an artist; let me recommend Vandyke brown, which is <i>not</i>  affected by heat."    
Hoffman looked over his shoulder at the other pair, but Amy was  making an ivy wreath for her hat, and the Pole pulling sprays for the  absorbing work. Speaking rapidly, Karl said, with a peculiar blending  of merriment, humility, and anxiety in his tone,--    
"Mademoiselle, you are quick to discover my disguise; will you also be  kind in concealing? I have enemies as well as friends, whom I desire  to escape: I would earn my bread unknown; Monsieur le Major keeps my  foolish secret; may I hope for equal goodness from yourself?"    
"You may, I do not forget that I owe my life to you, nor that you are  a gentleman. Trust me, I never will betray you."    
"Thanks, thanks! there will come a time when I may confess the truth  and be myself, but not yet," and his regretful tone was emphasized by  an impatient gesture, as if concealment was irksome.    
"Nell, come down to lunch; uncle is signalling as if he'd gone mad.  No, monsieur, it is quite impossible; you cannot reach the harebells  without risking too much; come away and forget that I wanted them."    
Amy led the way, and all went down more quietly than they came up,  especially Helen and Hoffman. An excellent lunch waited on one of the  tables in front of the old gateway, and having done justice to it, the  major made himself comfortable with a cigar, bidding the girls keep  near, for they must be off in half an hour. Hoffman went to see to the  horses, Casimer strolled away with him, and the young ladies went to  gather wild flowers at the foot of the tower.    
"Not a harebell here; isn't it provoking, when they grow in tufts up  there, where one can't reach them. Mercy, what's that? Run, Nell, the  old wall is coming down!"    
Both had been grubbing in a damp nook, where ferns and mosses grew  luxuriantly; the fall of a bit of stone and a rending sound above made  them fly back to the path and look up.    
Amy covered her eyes, and Helen grew pale, for part way down the  crumbling tower, clinging like a bird to the thick ivy stems, hung  Casimer, coolly gathering harebells from the clefts of the wall.    
"Hush; don't cry out or speak; it may startle him. Crazy boy! Let us  see what he will do," whispered Helen.    
"He can't go back, the vines are so torn and weak; and how will he get  down the lower wall? for you see the ivy grows up from that ledge, and  there is nothing below. How could he do it? I was only joking when I  lamented that there were no knights now, ready to leap into a lion's  den for a lady's glove," returned Amy, half angry.    
In breathless silence they watched the climber till his cap was full  of flowers, and taking it between his teeth, he rapidly swung down to  the wide ledge, from which there appeared to be no way of escape but a  reckless leap of many feet on to the turf below.    
The girls stood in the shadow of an old gateway, unperceived, and  waited anxiously what should follow.    
Lightly folding and fastening the cap together, he dropped it down,  and, leaning forward, tried to catch the top of a young birch rustling  close by the wall. Twice he missed it; the first time he frowned, but  the second he uttered an emphatic, "Deuce take it!"    
Helen and Amy looked at each other with a mutual smile and  exclamation,--    
"He knows some English, then!"    
There was time for no more--a violent rustle, a boyish laugh, and down  swung the slender tree, with the young man clinging to the top.    
As he landed safely, Helen cried, "Bravo!" and Amy rushed out,  exclaiming reproachfully, yet admiringly,--    
"How could you do it and frighten us so? I shall never express a wish  before you again, for if I wanted the moon you'd rashly try to get it,  I know."    
"<i>Certainement</i>, mademoiselle," was the smiling reply. Casimer  presented the flowers, as if the exploit was a mere trifle.    
"Now I shall go and press them at once in uncle's guide-book. Come and  help me, else you will be in mischief again." And Amy led the way to  the major with her flowers and their giver.    
Helen roamed into one of the ruined courts for a last look at a  fountain which pleased her eye. A sort of cloister ran round the  court, open on both sides, and standing in one of these arched nooks,  she saw Hoffman and a young girl talking animatedly. The girl was  pretty, well dressed, and seemed refusing something for which  the other pleaded eagerly. His arm was about her, and she leaned  affectionately upon him, with a white hand now and then caressing his  face, which was full of sparkle and vivacity now. They seemed about to  part as Helen looked, for the maiden standing on tiptoe, laughingly  offered her blooming cheek, and as Karl kissed it warmly, he said in  German, so audibly Helen heard every word,--    
"Farewell, my Ludmilla. Keep silent and I shall soon be with you.  Embrace the little one, and do not let him forget me."    
Both left the place as they spoke, each going a different way, and  Helen slowly returned to her party, saying to herself in a troubled  tone,--    
"'Ludmilla' and 'the little one' are his wife and child, doubtless. I  wonder if uncle knows that."    
When Hoffman next appeared she could not resist looking at him; but  the accustomed gravity was resumed, and nothing remained of the glow  and brightness he had worn when with Ludmilla in the cloister.
