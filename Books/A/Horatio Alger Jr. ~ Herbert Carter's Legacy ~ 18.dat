  Leaving the squire in the sitting room, Herbert went in quest of  his  mother. 
  &#8220;Squire Leech is here,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;What shall we say to him?&#8221; asked his mother, soberly. 
  &#8220;Wait a minute and I will tell you,&#8221; said Herbert, his face   brightening. 
  &#8220;I've had a stroke of luck, mother. I've been engaged to work   afternoons, at five dollars a week.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Who has engaged to pay you such high wages?&#8221; asked Mrs. Carter,   astonished. 
  &#8220;A young man staying at the hotel, whose eyes are weak. I am to  read  to him, and do whatever else he requires. I got the chance  through the  landlord.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are certainly fortunate,&#8221; said his mother, gratified. 
  &#8220;Now, what I am going to propose to the squire is to wait two or  three  weeks for the balance of the interest till I can make it up out  of my  wages.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If he weren't so anxious to get possession of the place he would;  but  I am afraid on that account he will refuse But we ought to go in.&#8221; 
  Mrs. Carter removed the apron which she had worn about her work,  and  entered the sitting room, followed by Herbert. 
  &#8220;I hope you will excuse my keeping you waiting, Squire Leech,&#8221; she   said. 
  &#8220;Certainly, ma'am, though I am rather in a hurry.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose you have come about the interest?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is due to-day, as, of course, you know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose you have it ready,&#8221; said the squire, eyeing her  shrewdly. 
  &#8220;I can pay you fifteen dollars of it,&#8221; said the widow, nervously. 
  Squire Leech felt exultant, but he only frowned. 
  &#8220;It amounts to twenty-two dollars and a half,&#8221; he said, sharply. 
  &#8220;I know that, and I shall be able to pay the remainder if you will  be  kind enough to wait two or three weeks.&#8221; 
  Not knowing anything of Herbert's good fortune, Squire Leech  utterly  disbelieved this. He knew no source from which the widow could  get the  money. 
  &#8220;It is easy enough to make promises,&#8221; he said, with a sneer, &#8220;but  that  doesn't satisfy me. I want my money.&#8221; 
  Now Herbert felt it time for him to take part in the conversation. 
  &#8220;My mother can keep her promise,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;Can she? Perhaps you will explain where you expect to get the  money.&#8221; 
  &#8220;From my wages,&#8221; answered Herbert, proudly. 
  &#8220;I wasn't aware that you received any,&#8221; sneered the squire. 
  &#8220;I have just made an engagement to work for five dollars a week,&#8221;  said  our hero, enjoying the squire's look of surprise. 
  &#8220;Indeed! Who pays you that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;A gentleman boarding at the hotel has engaged me to read to him as   his eyes are weak.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A fool and his money are soon parted,&#8221; said Squire Leech. &#8220;You may   retain the position a week.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope to keep it. I feel sure that I shall.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't,&#8221; said the squire, emphatically. 
  &#8220;Then are you willing to wait&#8212;say two weeks&#8212;for the rest of the   interest?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, I am not, and you ought to have known I shouldn't be. There is  a  way of arranging the whole matter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;By selling the place, you mean?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; I mean just that. It is folly for you to think of keeping the   property with such a heavy mortgage upon it on which you are unable to   pay the interest. I have offered you a fair price for it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You offered four hundred dollars less than it cost.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is nonsense! It never cost fifteen hundred dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have my husband's word for it,&#8221; said the widow. 
  &#8220;Then, he made some mistake, you may be sure.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am sure father was right,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Besides, we have his   bills to prove it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's neither here nor there,&#8221; said Squire Leech, impatiently.  &#8220;Even  if it cost ten thousand dollars, it's only worth eleven hundred  now;  that is to say, three hundred and fifty dollars over and above  the  mortgage.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are hard upon me, Squire Leech,&#8221; said Mrs. Carter,  despondently. 
  &#8220;You are a woman, ma'am, and women never understand business. I  make  allowance for you; but your son ought to know better than to  encourage  you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I want my mother to be treated fairly and justly.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you mean to imply that I would treat her otherwise, young man?&#8221;   demanded the squire, angrily. &#8220;I advise you not to make an enemy of   me.&#8221; 
  Herbert looked sober. The squire might not be right but certainly  he  had the power to carry his point and that power he was certain to   exercise. 
  &#8220;Will you give my mother and myself a little time to consult what  is  to be done?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the squire, feeling that he had carried his point. &#8220;I   might refuse, of course, but I wish to be easy with you and therefore   I will give you till half past twelve. I will be back at that time.&#8221; 
  He took his cane and left the house. 
  His reference to the post office reminded Herbert of the letter he  had  in his pocket for his mother. 
  &#8220;Here's a letter for you, mother,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;A letter! Who can it be from?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's postmarked at Randolph,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Perhaps it's from Aunt Nancy,&#8221; suggested the widow. &#8220;I don't know   anyone else in Randolph that would be likely to write to me.&#8221; 
  She opened the envelope and uttered a cry of surprise as two bills   dropped out and fluttered to the floor. 
  Herbert picked them up eagerly and cried: &#8220;Why, mother, they are  ten-dollar bills. Twenty dollars in all!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Twenty dollars!&#8221; repeated Mrs. Carter, in amazement. 
  &#8220;Hurrah! now we can pay the interest!&#8221; exclaimed Herbert. &#8220;Won't  the  squire be mad!&#8221; and he laughed joyously. &#8220;Read the letter aloud,   mother.&#8221; 
  Mrs. Carter read as follows: 
  &#8220;MY DEAR NIECE: I have thought of you often, and wish we were not  so  far distant from each other. I should enjoy seeing you and that  good  son of yours often. I am afraid you have had a hard time getting   along. My wants are few and I have more than enough to supply them. I   inclose twenty dollars in this letter. I shall not need them, for an   old woman like me can live on very little. 
  &#8220;I wish you would write to me sometimes or ask Herbert to. I feel   lonely and it would be a great favor to me. If it were not so far, I   would ask you and Herbert to come over and spend a day or two with me.   Perhaps you can manage to do it some time. Only don't delay too long,   for I am getting old and can't expect to live much longer, 
  &#8220;Your affectionate aunt, 
  &#8220;NANCY CARTER.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How good of Aunt Nancy! If her brother had possessed her kind  heart,  we should be better off to-day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It came just in the nick of time, mother. How lucky!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Say, rather, how providential, my son. We owe to the kindness of  God.  He will not see us want.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course you are right, mother; but the squire won't regard it in   the same light. He will be terribly disappointed, for he thinks he has   got us in his power.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am thankful that this is to be our home for six months more.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Longer than that, mother. I am earning something now, and I will  save  up money to pay our next interest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Squire Leech is coming back,&#8221; said Mrs. Carter. 
  &#8220;See how briskly he walks!&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I don't think he'll be  so  cheerful when he leaves the house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think we ought to exult, Herbert.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can't help it, mother and I'm not ashamed of it, either. You are   carrying benevolence too far.&#8221; 
  Here the squire's knock was heard, and Herbert went to admit him.
