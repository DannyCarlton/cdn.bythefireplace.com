As Hamilton had anticipated, the Jacobin press shouted and laughed  itself hoarse, vowed that it never could have concocted so effective a  bit of campaign literature, and that the ursine roars of Adams could be  heard from Dan to Beersheba. Burr, as yet undetected, almost danced as  he walked. The windows were filled with parodies of the pamphlet,  entitled, "The Last Speech and Dying Words of Alexander Hamilton,"  "Hamilton's Last Letter and His Amorous Vindication," "A Free  Examination of the Morals, Political and Literary Characters of John  Adams and Alexander Hamilton." One cartoon displayed the sinking ship  <i>Administration</i>, with the Federal rats scuttling out of her, and  Hamilton standing alone on the deck; another, "The Little Lion"  sitting, dejected and forlorn, outside the barred gates of  "Hamiltonopolis." The deep, silent laughter of Jefferson shook the  continent.    
The Federalist leaders were furious and aghast. But they recovered, and  when the time came, every Federalist delegate to the Electoral College,  with one exception, voted precisely as Hamilton had counselled. South  Carolina deserted Pinckney because he would not desert Adams, but she  would have pursued that policy had the pamphlet never been written; and  whether it affected the defeat of the Federalists in Pennsylvania and  other States is doubtful. The publication in August of Adams's letter to  Tench Coxe, written in 1792, when he was bitterly disappointed at  Washington's refusal to send him as minister to England, and asserting  that the appointment of Pinckney was due to British influence, thus  casting opprobrium upon the integrity of Washington, had done as much as  Hamilton's pamphlet, if not more, to damn him finally with the  Federalists. Hamilton's chief punishment for his thunderbolt was in his  conscience, and his leadership of his party was not questioned for a  moment. He expected a paternal rebuke from General Schuyler, but that  old warrior, severe always with the delinquencies of his own children,  had found few faults in his favourite son-in-law; and he took a greater  pride in his career than he had taken in his own. Now that gout and  failing sight had forced him from public life, he found his chief  enjoyment in Hamilton's society. General Schuyler survived the death of  several of his children and of his wife, but Hamilton's death killed  him. Assuredly, life dealt generously with our hero in the matter of  fathers, despite or because of an early oversight. James Hamilton had  never made the long and dangerous journey to the North, and he had died  on St. Vincent, in 1799, but what filial regret his son might have  dutifully experienced was swept away on the current of the overwhelming  grief for Washington. And as for mothers, charming elder sisters, and  big brothers, eager to fight his battles, no man was ever so blest. In  December Hamilton received the following letter from William Vans  Murray:--    <blockquote>
 Paris, Oct. 9th, 1800.    
 Dear Sir: I was extremely flattered by the confidence which your   letter by Mr. Colbert proved you have in my disposition to follow   your wishes. A letter from you is no affair of ceremony. It is an   obligation on any man who flatters himself with the hope of your   personal esteem. Mr. Colbert gave it to me yesterday. I   immediately, in particular, addressed a letter to Bonaparte, and   made use of your name, which I was sure would be pleasing to him.   To-day I dined with him. The Secretary of State assured me that he   received it kindly, and I can hope something good from him. If any   come it will be your work. I never before spoke or wrote to   Bonaparte on any affair other than public business. It will be very   pleasing to you if we succeed, that your silent agency works good   to the unhappy and meritorious at such a distance. I know nothing   better belonging to reputation.</blockquote>    
Poor Adams!    
General Davie arrived by the next ship, bringing with him a convention  concluded with France on the 30th of October. He also brought a letter  to Hamilton from one of the commission, with a copy of the document and  a journal of the proceedings of the negotiators. The writer was Oliver  Ellsworth, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Adams might  occupy the chair of State, but to the Federals Hamilton was President in  all but name.    
Sedgwick and Gouverneur Morris, now a member of the Senate, not knowing  of the communication, wrote immediately to Hamilton, acquainting him  with the contents of the treaty.    <blockquote>
 It contains no stipulation for satisfaction of the injuries we have   received [Sedgwick wrote in wrath]. It makes the treaty of '78 a   subject for future negotiation. It engages that we shall return, in   the condition they now are, all our captures. It makes neutral   bottoms a protection to their cargoes, and it contains a   stipulation directly in violation of the 25th article of our treaty   with Great Britain. Such are the blessed effects of our mission!   These are the ripened fruits of this independent Administration!   Our friends in the Senate are not enough recovered from their   astonishment to begin to reflect on the course they shall pursue.</blockquote>    
This treaty was a far more deadly weapon in Hamilton's hands than the  entire arsenal he had manipulated in his pamphlet, for campaign  literature is often pickled and retired with the salt of its readers.  But did this mission fail, did Adams lose his only chance of  justification for sending the commission at all, did the Senate refuse  to ratify, and war break out, or honourable terms of peace be left to  the next President, then Adams's Administration must be stamped in  history as a failure, and he himself retire from office covered with  ignominy. But had Hamilton not recovered his balance and trimmed to  their old steady duty the wicks of those lamps whose brilliance had  dimmed in a stormy hour, his statesmanship would have controlled him in  such a crisis as this. He knew that the rejection of the treaty would  shatter the Federal party and cause national schisms and discords; that,  if left over to a Jacobin administration, the result would be still  worse for the United States. It was a poor thing, but no doubt the best  that could have been extracted from triumphant France; nor was it as bad  in some respects as the irritated Senate would have it. Such as it was,  it must be ratified, peace placed to the credit of the Federalists, and  the act of the man they had made President justified. Hamilton was  obliged to write a great many letters on the subject, for the  Federalists found it a bitter pill to swallow; but he prevailed and they  swallowed it.    
Meanwhile, the Electoral College had met. Adams had received sixty-five  votes, Pinckney sixty-four, Jefferson and Burr seventy-three each. That  threw the decision upon the House of Representatives, for Burr refused  to recognize the will of the people, and withdraw in favour of the man  whom the Democratic hemisphere of American politics had unanimously  elected. Burr had already lost caste with the party by his attempts to  secure more votes than the leaders were willing to give him, and had  alarmed Jefferson into strenuous and diplomatic effort, the while he  piously folded his visible hands or discoursed upon the bones of the  mammoth. When Burr, therefore, permitted the election to go to the  House, he was flung out of the Democratic party neck and crop, and  Jefferson treated him like a dog until he killed Hamilton, when he gave  a banquet in his honour. Burr's only chance for election lay with the  Federalists, who would rather have seen horns and a tail in the  Executive Chair than Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton had anticipated their  hesitation and disposition to bargain with Burr, and he bombarded them  with letters from the moment the Electoral College announced the result,  until the House decided the question on the 17th of February. He  analyzed Burr for the benefit of the anxious members until the dark and  poisonous little man must have haunted their dreams at night. Whether  they approached Burr or not will never be known; but they were finally  convinced that to bargain with a man as unfigurable as water would be  throwing away time which had far better be employed in extracting  pledges from Jefferson.    
One of Hamilton's letters to Gouverneur Morris, who wielded much  influence in the House, is typical of many.    <blockquote>
 ... Another subject. <i>Jefferson or Burr</i>? The former beyond a   doubt. The latter in my judgement has no principle, public or   private; could be bound by no agreement; will listen to no monitor   but his ambition; and for this purpose will use the worst portion   of the community as a ladder to climb to permanent power, and an   instrument to crush the better part. He is bankrupt beyond   redemption, except by the resources that grow out of war and   disorder; or by a sale to a foreign power, or by great peculation.   War with Great Britain would be the immediate instrument. He is   sanguine enough to hope everything, daring enough to attempt   everything, wicked enough to scruple nothing. From the elevation of   such a man may heaven preserve the country.    
 Let our situation be improved to obtain from Jefferson assurances   on certain points: the maintenance of the present system,   especially on the cardinal articles of public credit--a navy,   neutrality. Make any discreet use you may think fit of this letter.</blockquote>    
He was deeply alarmed at the tendency of the excited House, which sat in  continuous session from the 11th to the 17th, members sleeping on the  floor and sick men brought thither on cots, one with his wife in  attendance. The South was threatening civil war, and Burr's subsequent  career justified his alarm and his warnings; but in spite of his great  influence he won his case with his followers by a very small margin.  They were under no delusions regarding the character of Burr, their  letters to Hamilton abound in strictures almost as severe as his own,  but their argument was that he was the less of two evils, that every  move he made could be sharply watched. It is quite true that he would  have had Federalists and Democrats in both Houses to frustrate him; but  it does not seem to have occurred to the former that impeachment would  have been inevitable, and Jefferson President but a year or two later  than the will of the people decreed. But it was a time of terrible  excitement, and for the matter of that their brains must have been a  trifle clouded by the unvarying excitement of their lives. Bayard of  Delaware, with whom Hamilton had fought over point by point, winning one  or more with each letter, changed his vote on the last ballot from Burr  to a blank. Hamilton's friends knew that Burr would kill him sooner or  later, for the ambitious man had lost his one chance of the great  office; but Hamilton chose to see only the humour of the present he had  made Thomas Jefferson. That sensible politician had tacitly agreed to  the terms suggested by the Federalists, when they debated the  possibility of accepting him, and Hamilton knew that he was far too  clever to break his word at once. What Hamilton hoped for was what came  to pass: Jefferson found the machinery of his new possession more to his  taste than he could have imagined while sitting out in the cold, and he  let it alone.
