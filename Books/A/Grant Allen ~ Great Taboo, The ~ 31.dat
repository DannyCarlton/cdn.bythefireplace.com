In a moment, Felix's mind was fully made up. There was no time to think;  it was the hour for action. He saw how he must comport himself toward  this strange wild people. Seating Muriel gently on the ground, Mali  beside her, and stepping forward himself, with Peyron's hand in his, he  beckoned to the vast and surging crowd to bespeak respectful silence.    
A mighty hush fell at once upon the people. The King of Fire and the King  of Water stood back, obedient to his nod. They waited for the upshot of  this strange new development.    
"Men of Boupari," Felix began, speaking with a marvellous fluency in  their own tongue, for the excitement itself supplied him with eloquence;  "I have killed your late god in the prescribed way; I have plucked the  sacred bough, and fought in single combat by the established rules of  your own religion. Fire and Water, you guardians of this holy island, is  it not so? You saw all things done, did you not, after the precepts of  your ancestors?"    
The King of Fire bowed low and answered: "Tu-Kila-Kila speaks, indeed,  the truth. Water and I, with our own eyes, have seen it."    
"And now," Felix went on, "I am myself, by your own laws, Tu-Kila-Kila."    
The King of Fire made a gesture of dissent. "Oh, great god, pardon me,"  he murmured, "if I say aught, now, to contradict you; but you are not a  full Tu-Kila-Kila yet till you have eaten of the heart of the god, your  predecessor."    
"Then where is now the spirit of Tu-Kila-Kila, the very high god, if I am  not he?" Felix asked, abruptly, thus puzzling them with a hard problem in  their own savage theology.    
The King of Fire gave a start, and pondered. This was a detail of his  creed that had never before so much as occurred to him. All faiths have  their <i>cruces</i>. "I do not well know," he answered, "whether it is in the  heart of Lavita, the son of Sami, or in your own body. But I feel sure it  must now be certainly somewhere, though just where our fathers have never  told us."    
Felix recognized at once that he had gained a point. "Then look to it  well," he said, austerely. "Be careful how you act. Do nothing rash. For  either the soul of the god is in the heart of Lavita, the son of Sami;  and then, since I refuse to eat it, it will decay away, as Lavita's body  decays, and the world will shrivel up, and all things will perish,  because the god is dead and crumbled to dust forever. Or else it is in my  body, who am god in his place; and then, if anybody does me harm or hurt,  he will be an impious wretch, and will have broken taboo, and Heaven  knows what evils and misfortunes may not, therefore, fall on each and all  of you."    
A very old chief rose from the ranks outside. His hair was white and  his eyes bleared. "Tu-Kila-Kila speaks well," he cried, in a loud but  mumbling voice. "His words are wise. He argues to the point. He is very  cunning. I advise you, my people, to be careful how you anger the  white-faced stranger, for you know what he is; he is cruel; he is  powerful. There was never any storm in my time--and I am an old man--so  great in Boupari as the storm that rose when the King of the Rain ate the  storm-apple. Our yams and our taros even now are suffering from it. He is  a mighty strong god. Beware how you tamper with him!"    
He sat down, trembling. A younger chief rose from a nearer rank, and  said his say in turn. "I do not agree with our father," he cried,  pointing to the chief who had just spoken. "His word is evil; he is much  mistaken. I have another thought. My thought is this. Let us kill and eat  the white-faced stranger at once, by wager of battle; and let whosoever  fights and overcomes him receive his honors, and take to wife the fair  woman, the Queen of the Clouds, the sun-faced Korong, whom he brought  from the sun with him."    
"But who will then be Tu-Kila-Kila?" Felix asked, turning round upon him  quickly. Habituation to danger had made him unnaturally alert in such  utmost extremities.    
"Why, the man who slays you," the young chief answered, pointedly,  grasping his heavy tomahawk with profound expression.    
"I think not," Felix answered. "Your reasoning is bad. For if I am not  Tu-Kila-Kila, how can any man become Tu-Kila-Kila by killing me? And if I  am Tu-Kila-Kila, how dare you, not being yourself Korong, and not having  broken off the sacred bough, as I did, venture to attack me? You wish to  set aside all the customs of Boupari. Are you not ashamed of such gross  impiety?"    
"Tu-Kila-Kila speaks well," the King of Fire put in, for he had no cause  to love the aggressive young chief, and he thought better of his chances  in life as Felix's minister. "Besides, now I think of it, he <i>must</i> be  Tu-Kila-Kila, because he has taken the life of the last great god, whom  he slew with his hands; and therefore the life is now his--he holds it."    
Felix was emboldened by this favorable opinion to strike out a fresh line  in a further direction. He stood forward once more, and beckoned again  for silence. "Yes, my people," he said calmly, with slow articulation,  "by the custom of your race and the creed you profess I am now indeed,  and in every truth, the abode of your great god, Tu-Kila-Kila. But,  furthermore, I have a new revelation to make to you. I am going to  instruct you in a fresh way. This creed that you hold is full of errors.  As Tu-Kila-Kila, I mean to take my own course, no islander hindering me.  If you try to depose me, what great gods have you now got left? None,  save only Fire and Water, my ministers. King of the Rain there is none;  for I, who was he, am now Tu-Kila-Kila. Tu-Kila-Kila there is none, save  only me; for the other, that was, I have fought and conquered. The Queen  of the Clouds is with me. The King of the Birds is with me. Consider,  then, O friends, that if you kill us all, you will have nowhere to turn;  you will be left quite godless."    
"It is true," the people murmured, looking about them, half puzzled. "He  is wise. He speaks well. He is indeed a Tu-Kila-Kila."    
Felix pressed his advantage home at once. "Now listen," he said, lifting  up one solemn forefinger. "I come from a country very far away, where the  customs are better by many yams than those of Boupari. And now that I am  indeed Tu-Kila-Kila--your god, your master--I will change and alter some  of your customs that seem to me here and now most undesirable. In the  first place--hear this!--I will put down all cannibalism. No man shall  eat of human flesh on pain of death. And to begin with, no man shall cook  or eat the body of Lavita, the son of Sami. On that I am determined--I,  Tu-Kila-Kila. The King of the Birds and I, we will dig a pit, and we will  bury in it the corpse of this man that was once your god, and whom his  own wickedness compelled me to fight and slay, in order to prevent more  cruelty and bloodshed."    
The young chief stood up, all red in his wrath, and interrupted him,  brandishing a coral-stone hatchet. "This is blasphemy," he said. "This is  sheer rank blasphemy. These are not good words. They are very bad  medicine. The white-faced Korong is no true Tu-Kila-Kila. His advice  is evil--and ill-luck would follow it. He wishes to change the sacred  customs of Boupari. Now, that is not well. My counsel is this: let us eat  him now, unless he changes his heart, and amends his ways, and partakes,  as is right, of the body of Lavita, the son of Sami."    
The assembly swayed visibly, this way and that, some inclining to the  conservative view of the rash young chief, and others to the cautious  liberalism of the gray-haired warrior. Felix noted their division, and  spoke once more, this time still more authoritatively than ever.    
"Furthermore," he said, "my people, hear me. As I came in a ship  propelled by fire over the high waves of the sea, so I go away in one. We  watch for such a ship to pass by Boupari. When it comes, the Queen of the  Clouds--upon whose life I place a great Taboo; let no man dare to touch  her at his peril; if he does, I will rush upon him and kill him as I  killed Lavita, the son of Sami. When it comes, the Queen of the Clouds,  the King of the Birds, and I, we will go away back in it to the land  whence we came, and be quit of Boupari. But we will not leave it fireless  or godless. When I return back home again to my own far land, I will send  out messengers, very good men, who will tell you of a God more powerful  by much than any you ever knew, and very righteous. They will teach you  great things you never dreamed of. Therefore, I ask you now to disperse  to your own homes, while the King of Birds and I bury the body of Lavita,  the son of Sami."    
All this time Muriel had been seated on the ground, listening with  profound interest, but scarcely understanding a word, though here and  there, after her six months' stay in the island, a single phrase was  dimly intelligible to her. But now, at this critical moment she rose,  and, standing upright by Felix's side in her spotless English purity  among those assembled savages, she pointed just once with her uplifted  finger to the calm vault of heaven, and then across the moonlit horizon  of the sea, and last of all to the clustering huts and villages of  Boupari. "Tell them," she said to Felix, with blanched lips, but without  one sign of a tremor in her fearless voice, "I will pray for them to  Heaven, when I go across the sea, and will think of the children that I  loved to pat and play with, and will send out messengers from our home  beyond the waves, to make them wiser and happier and better."    
Felix translated her simple message to them in its pure womanly  goodness. Even the natives were touched. They whispered and hesitated.  Then after a time of much murmured debate, the King of Fire stood forward  as a mediator. "There is an oracle, O Korong," he said, "not to prejudge  the matter, which decides all these things--a great conch-shell at a  sacred grove in the neighboring island of Aloa Mauna. It is the holiest  oracle of all our holy religion. We gods and men of Boupari have taken  counsel together, and have come to a conclusion. We will put forth a  canoe and send men with blood on their faces to inquire at Aloa Mauna of  the very great oracle. Till then, you are neither Tu-Kila-Kila, nor not  Tu-Kila-Kila. It behooves us to be very careful how we deal with gods.  Our people will stand round your precinct in a row, and guard you with  their spears. You shall not cross the taboo line to them, nor they to  you: all shall be neutral. Food shall be laid by the line, as always,  morn, noon, and night; and your Shadows shall take it in; but you shall  not come out. Neither shall you bury the body of Lavita, the son of Sami.  Till the canoe comes back it shall lie in the sun and rot there."    
He clapped his hands twice.    
In a moment a tom-tom began to beat from behind, and the people all  crowded without the circle. The King of Fire came forward ostentatiously  and made taboo. "If, any man cross this line," he said in a droning  sing-song, "till the canoe return from the great oracle of our faith on  Aloa Mauna, I, Fire, will scorch him into cinder and ashes. If any woman  transgress, I will pitch her with palm oil, and light her up for a lamp  on a moonless night to lighten this temple."    
The King of Water distributed shark's-tooth spears. At once a great  serried wall hemmed in the Europeans all round, and they sat down to  wait, the three whites together, for the upshot of the mission to Aloa  Mauna.    
And the dawn now gleamed red on the eastern horizon.
