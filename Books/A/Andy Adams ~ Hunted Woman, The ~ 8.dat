  John Aldous confessed to himself that he did not quite understand,  in spite of the effort Stevens had made to impress upon him, the  importance of not going to Tete Jaune. He was bewildered over a number  of things, and felt that he needed to be alone for a time to clear his  mind. He left Stevens, promising to return later to share a couple of  blankets and a part of his tepee, for he was determined to keep his  promise to Joanne, and not return to his own cabin, even though Quade  had left Miette. He followed a moonlit trail along the river to an  abandoned surveyors' camp, knowing that he would meet no one, and that  in this direction he would have plenty of unbroken quiet in which to  get some sort of order out of the chaotic tangle of events through  which he had passed that day.
  Aldous had employed a certain amount of caution, but until he had  talked with Stevens he had not believed that Quade, in his twofold  desire to avenge himself and possess Joanne, would go to the  extraordinary ends predicted by the packer. His point of view was now  entirely changed. He believed Stevens. He knew the man was not  excitable. He was one of the coolest heads in the mountains. And he had  abundant nerve. Thought of Stimson and Stimson's wife had sent the hot  blood through Aldous like fire. Was Stevens right in that detail? And  was Quade actually planning the same end for him and Joanne? Why had  Quade stolen on ahead to Tete Jaune? Why had he not waited for  to-morrow's train?
  He found himself walking swiftly along the road, where he had  intended to walk slowly&#8212;a hundred questions pounding through his  brain. Suddenly a thought came to him that stopped him in the trail,  his unseeing eyes staring down into the dark chasm of the river. After  all, was it so strange that Quade would do these things? Into his own  life Joanne had come like a wonderful dream-creature transformed into  flesh and blood. He no longer tried to evade the fact that he could not  think without thinking of Joanne. She had become a part of him. She had  made him forget everything but her, and in a few hours had sent into  the dust of ruin his cynicism and aloneness of a lifetime. If Joanne  had come to him like this, making him forget his work, filling him more  and more with the thrilling desire to fight for her, was it so very  strange that a beast like Quade would fight&#8212;in another way?
  He went on down the trail, his hands clenched tightly. After all, it  was not fear of Quade or of what he might attempt that filled him with  uneasiness. It was Joanne herself, her strange quest, its final  outcome. With the thought that she was seeking for the man who was her  husband, a leaden hand seemed gripping at his heart. He tried to shake  it off, but it was like a sickness. To believe that she had been the  wife of another man or that she could ever belong to any other man than  himself seemed like shutting his eyes forever to the sun. And yet she  had told him. She had belonged to another man; she might belong to him  even now. She had come to find if he was alive&#8212;or dead.
  And if alive? Aldous stopped again, and looked down into the dark  pit through which the river was rushing a hundred feet below him. It  tore in frothing maelstroms through a thousand rocks, filling the night  with a low thunder. To John Aldous the sound of it might have been a  thousand miles away. He did not hear. His eye saw nothing in the  blackness. For a few moments the question he had asked himself  obliterated everything. If they found Joanne's husband alive at Tete  Jaune&#8212;what then? He turned back, retracing his steps over the trail, a  feeling of resentment&#8212;of hatred for the man he had never seen&#8212;slowly  taking the place of the oppressive thing that had turned his heart sick  within him. Then, in a flash, came the memory of Joanne's words&#8212;words  in which, white-faced and trembling, she had confessed that her anxiety  was not that she would find him dead, but that<I> she would find him  alive</I>. A joyous thrill shot through him as he remembered that.  Whoever this man was, whatever he might have been to her once, or was  to her now, Joanne did not want to find him alive! He laughed softly to  himself as he quickened his pace. The tense grip of his fingers  loosened. The grim, almost ghastly part of it did not occur to him&#8212;the  fact that deep in his soul he was wishing a man dead and in his grave.
  He did not return at once to the scenes about Quade's place, but  went to the station, three quarters of a mile farther up the track.  Here, in a casual way, he learned from the little pink-faced Cockney  Englishman who watched the office at night that Stevens had been  correct in his information. Quade had gone to Tete Jaune. Although it  was eleven o'clock, Aldous proceeded in the direction of the engineers'  camp, still another quarter of a mile deeper in the bush. He was  restless. He did not feel that he could sleep that night. The  engineers' camp he expected to find in darkness, and he was surprised  when he saw a light burning brightly in Keller's cabin.
  Keller was the assistant divisional engineer, and they had become  good friends. It was Keller who had set the first surveyor's line at  Tete Jaune, and it was he who had reported it as the strategic point  from which to push forward the fight against mountain and wilderness,  both by river and rail. He was, in a way, accountable for the existence  of Tete Jaune just where it did exist, and he knew more about it than  any other man in the employ of the Grand Trunk Pacific. For this reason  Aldous was glad that Keller had not gone to bed. He knocked at the door  and entered without waiting for an invitation.
  The engineer stood in the middle of the floor, his coat off, his  fat, stubby hands thrust into the pockets of his baggy trousers, his  red face and bald cranium shining in the lamplight. A strange fury  blazed in his eyes as he greeted his visitor. He began pacing back and  forth across the room, puffing volumes of smoke from a huge bowled  German pipe as he motioned Aldous to a chair.
  &#8220;What's the matter, Peter?&#8221;
  &#8220;Enough&#8212;an' be damned!&#8221; growled Peter. &#8220;If it wasn't enough do you  think I'd be out of bed at this hour of the night?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm sure it's enough,&#8221; agreed Aldous. &#8220;If it wasn't you'd be in  your little trundle over there, sleeping like a baby. I don't know of  any one who can sleep quite as sweetly as you, Peter. But what the  devil<I> is</I> the trouble?&#8221;
  &#8220;Something that you can't make me feel funny over. You haven't  heard&#8212;about the bear?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a word, Peter.&#8221;
  Keller took his hands from his pockets and the big, bowled pipe from  his mouth.
  &#8220;You know what I did with that bear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;More than a year ago  I made friends with her up there on the hill instead of killing her.  Last summer I got her so she'd eat out of my hands. I fed her a barrel  of sugar between July and November. We used to chum it an hour at a  time, and I'd pet her like a dog. Why, damn it, man, I thought more of  that bear than I did of any human in these regions! And she got so fond  of me she didn't leave to den up until January. This spring she came  out with two cubs, an' as soon as they could waddle she brought 'em out  there on the hillside an' waited for me. We were better chums than  ever. I've got another half barrel of sugar&#8212;lump sugar&#8212;on the way  from Edmonton. An' now what do you think that damned C.N.R. gang has  done?&#8221;
  &#8220;They haven't shot her?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, they haven't shot her. I wish to God they had! They've<I> blown  her up!</I>&#8220;
  The little engineer subsided into a chair.
  &#8220;Do you hear?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;They've blown her up! Put a stick of  dynamite under some sugar, attached a battery wire to it, an' when she  was licking up the sugar touched it off. An' I can't do anything, damn  'em! Bears ain't protected. The government of this province calls 'em  'pests.' Murder 'em on sight, it says. An' those fiends over there  think it's a good joke on me&#8212;an' the bear!&#8221;
  Keller was sweating. His fat hands were clenched, and his round,  plump body fairly shook with excitement and anger.
  &#8220;When I went over to-night they laughed at me&#8212;the whole bunch,&#8221; he  went on thickly. &#8220;I offered to lick every man in the outfit from A to  Z, an' I ain't had a fight in twenty years. Instead of fighting like  men, a dozen of them grabbed hold of me, chucked me into a blanket, an'  bounced me for fifteen minutes straight! What do you think of<I> that</I>, Aldous? Me&#8212;assistant divisional engineer of the G.T.P.&#8212;<I>bounced in  a blanket</I>!&#8221;
  Peter Keller hopped from his chair and began pacing back and forth  across the room again, sucking truculently on his pipe.
  &#8220;If they were on our road I'd&#8212;I'd chase every man of them out of  the country. But they're not. They belong to the C.N.R. They're out of  my reach.&#8221; He stopped, suddenly, in front of Aldous. &#8220;What can I do?&#8221;  he demanded.
  &#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Aldous. &#8220;You've had something like this coming to  you, Peter. I've been expecting it. All the camps for twenty miles up  and down the line know what you thought of that bear. You fired Tibbits  because, as you said, he was too thick with Quade. You told him that  right before Quade's face. Tibbits is now foreman of that grading gang  over there. Two and two make four, you know. Tibbits&#8212;Quade&#8212;the  blown-up bear. Quade doesn't miss an opportunity, no matter how small  it is. Tibbits and Quade did this to get even with you. You might  report the blanket affair to the contractors of the other road. I don't  believe they would stand for it.&#8221;
  Aldous had guessed correctly what the effect of associating Quade's  name with the affair would be. Keller was one of Quade's deadliest  enemies. He sat down close to Aldous again. His eyes burned deep back.  It was not Keller's physique, but his brain, and the fearlessness of  his spirit, that made him dangerous.
  &#8220;I guess you're right, Aldous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some day&#8212;I'll even up on  Quade.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so shall I, Peter.&#8221;
  The engineer stared into the other's eyes.
  &#8220;You&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  Aldous nodded.
  &#8220;Quade left for Tete Jaune to-night, on a hand-car. I follow him  to-morrow, on the train. I can't tell you what's up, Peter, but I don't  think it will stop this side of death for Quade and Culver Rann&#8212;or me.  I mean that quite literally. I don't see how more than one side can  come out alive. I want to ask you a few questions before I go on to  Tete Jaune. You know every mountain and trail about the place, don't  you?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've tramped them all, afoot and horseback.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then perhaps you can direct me to what I must find&#8212;a man's grave.&#8221;
  Peter Keller paused in the act of relighting his pipe. For a moment  he stared in amazement.
  &#8220;There are a great many graves up at Tete Jaune,&#8221; he said, at last.  &#8220;A great many graves&#8212;and many of them unmarked. If it's a<I> Quade</I>  grave you're looking for, Aldous, it will be unmarked.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am quite sure that it is marked&#8212;or<I> was</I> at one time,&#8221; said  Aldous. &#8220;It's the grave of a man who had quite an unusual name, Peter,  and you might remember it&#8212;Mortimer FitzHugh.&#8221;
  &#8220;FitzHugh&#8212;FitzHugh,&#8221; repeated Keller, puffing out fresh volumes of  smoke. &#8220;Mortimer FitzHugh&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;He died, I believe, before there was a Tete Jaune, or at least  before the steel reached there,&#8221; added Aldous. &#8220;He was on a hunting  trip, and I have reason to think that his death was a violent one.&#8221;
  Keller rose and fell into his old habit of pacing back and forth  across the room, a habit that had worn a path in the bare pine boards  of the floor.
  &#8220;There's graves an' graves up there, but not so many that were there  before Tete Jaune came,&#8221; he began, between puffs. &#8220;Up on the side of  White Knob Mountain there's the grave of a man who was torn to bits by  a grizzly. But his name was Humphrey. Old Yellowhead John&#8212;Tete Jaune,  they called him&#8212;died years before that, and no one knows where his  grave is. We had five men die before the steel came, but there wasn't a  FitzHugh among 'em. Crabby&#8212;old Crabby Tompkins, a trapper, is buried  in the sand on the Frazer. The last flood swept his slab away. There's  two unmarked graves in Glacier Canyon, but I guess they're ten years  old if a day. Burns was shot. I knew him. Plenty died after the steel  came, but before that&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  Suddenly he stopped. He faced Aldous. His breath came in quick  jerks.
  &#8220;By Heaven, I do remember!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;There's a mountain in the Saw  Tooth Range, twelve miles from Tete Jaune&#8212;a mountain with the  prettiest basin you ever saw at the foot of it, with a lake no bigger  than this camp, and an old cabin which Yellowhead himself must have  built fifty years ago. There's a blind canyon runs out of it, short an'  dark, on the right. We found a grave there. I don't remember the first  name on the slab. Mebby it was washed out. But, so 'elp me God,<I> the  last name was FitzHugh</I>!&#8221;
  With a sudden cry, Aldous jumped to his feet and caught Keller's  arm.
  &#8220;You're sure of it, Peter?&#8221;
  &#8220;Positive!&#8221;
  It was impossible for Aldous to repress his excitement. The engineer  stared at him even harder than before.
  &#8220;What can that grave have to do with Quade?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;The man died  before Quade was known in these regions.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't tell you now, Peter,&#8221; replied Aldous, pulling the engineer  to the table. &#8220;But I think you'll know quite soon. For the present, I  want you to sketch out a map that will take me to the grave. Will you?&#8221;
  On the table were pencil and paper. Keller seated himself and drew  them toward him.
  &#8220;I'm damned if I can see what that grave can have to do with Quade,&#8221;  he said; &#8220;but I'll tell you how to find it!&#8221;
  For several minutes they bent low over the table, Peter Keller  describing the trail to the Saw Tooth Mountain as he sketched it, step  by step, on a sheet of office paper. When it was done, Aldous folded it  carefully and placed it in his wallet.
  &#8220;I can't go wrong, and&#8212;thank you, Keller!&#8221;
  After Aldous had gone, Peter Keller sat for some time in deep  thought.
  &#8220;Now I wonder what the devil there can be about a grave to make him  so happy,&#8221; he grumbled, listening to the whistle that was growing  fainter down the trail.
  And Aldous, alone, with the moon straight above him as he went back  to the Miette Plain, felt, in truth, this night had become brighter for  him than any day he had ever known. For he knew that Peter Keller was  not a man to make a statement of which he was not sure. Mortimer  FitzHugh was dead. His bones lay under the slab up in that little blind  canyon in the shadow of the Saw Tooth Mountain. To-morrow he would tell  Joanne. And, blindly, he told himself that she would be glad.
  Still whistling, he passed the Chinese laundry shack on the creek,  crossed the railroad tracks, and buried himself in the bush beyond. A  quarter of an hour later he stole quietly into Stevens' camp and went  to bed.
