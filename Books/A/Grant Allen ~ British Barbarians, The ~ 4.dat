On the way to church, the Monteiths sifted out their new  acquaintance.    
"Well, what do you make of him, Frida?" Philip asked, leaning back  in his place, with a luxurious air, as soon as the carriage had  turned the corner. "Lunatic or sharper?"    
Frida gave an impatient gesture with her neatly gloved hand. "For  my part," she answered without a second's hesitation, "I make him  neither: I find him simply charming."    
"That's because he praised your dress," Philip replied, looking  wise. "Did ever you know anything so cool in your life? Was it  ignorance, now, or insolence?"    
"It was perfect simplicity and naturalness," Frida answered with  confidence. "He looked at the dress, and admired it, and being  transparently naif, he didn't see why he shouldn't say so. It  wasn't at all rude, I thought--and it gave me pleasure."    
"He certainly has in some ways charming manners," Philip went on  more slowly. "He manages to impress one. If he's a madman, which  I rather more than half suspect, it's at least a gentlemanly form  of madness."    
"His manners are more than merely charming," Frida answered, quite  enthusiastic, for she had taken a great fancy at first sight to the  mysterious stranger. "They've such absolute freedom. That's what  strikes me most in them. They're like the best English aristocratic  manners, without the insolence; or the freest American manners,  without the roughness. He's extremely distinguished. And, oh,  isn't he handsome!"    
"He <i>is</i> good-looking," Philip assented grudgingly. Philip owned a  looking-glass, and was therefore accustomed to a very high  standard of manly beauty.    
As for Robert Monteith, he smiled the grim smile of the wholly  unfascinated. He was a dour business man of Scotch descent, who  had made his money in palm-oil in the City of London; and having  married Frida as a remarkably fine woman, with a splendid figure,  to preside at his table, he had very small sympathy with what he  considered her high-flown fads and nonsensical fancies. He had seen  but little of the stranger, too, having come in from his weekly  stroll, or tour of inspection, round the garden and stables, just  as they were on the very point of starting for St. Barnabas: and  his opinion of the man was in no way enhanced by Frida's enthusiasm.  "As far as I'm concerned," he said, with his slow Scotch drawl,  inherited from his father (for though London-born and bred, he was  still in all essentials a pure Caledonian)--"As far as I'm  concerned, I haven't the slightest doubt but the man's a swindler.  I wonder at you, Frida, that you should leave him alone in the  house just now, with all that silver. I stepped round before I  left, and warned Martha privately not to move from the hall till  the fellow was gone, and to call up cook and James if he tried to  get out of the house with any of our property. But you never  seemed to suspect him. And to supply him with a bag, too, to  carry it all off in! Well, women are reckless! Hullo, there,  policeman;--stop, Price, one moment;--I wish you'd keep an eye on  my house this morning. There's a man in there I don't half like  the look of. When he drives away in a cab that my boy's going to  call for him, just see where he stops, and take care he hasn't got  anything my servants don't know about."    
In the drawing-room, meanwhile, Bertram Ingledew was reflecting, as  he waited for the church people to clear away, how interesting  these English clothes-taboos and day-taboos promised to prove,  beside some similar customs he had met with or read of in his  investigations elsewhere. He remembered how on a certain morning of  the year the High Priest of the Zapotecs was obliged to get drunk,  an act which on any other day in the calendar would have been  regarded by all as a terrible sin in him. He reflected how in  Guinea and Tonquin, at a particular period once a twelvemonth,  nothing is considered wrong, and everything lawful, so that the  worst crimes and misdemeanours go unnoticed and unpunished. He  smiled to think how some days are tabooed in certain countries, so  that whatever you do on them, were it only a game of tennis, is  accounted wicked; while some days are periods of absolute licence,  so that whatever you do on them, were it murder itself, becomes fit  and holy. To him and his people at home, of course, it was the  intrinsic character of the act itself that made it right or wrong,  not the particular day or week or month on which one happened to do  it. What was wicked in June was wicked still in October. But not  so among the unreasoning devotees of taboo, in Africa or in England.  There, what was right in May became wicked in September, and what  was wrong on Sunday became harmless or even obligatory on Wednesday  or Thursday. It was all very hard for a rational being to  understand and explain: but he meant to fathom it, all the same, to  the very bottom--to find out why, for example, in Uganda, whoever  appears before the king must appear stark naked, while in England,  whoever appears before the queen must wear a tailor's sword or a  long silk train and a headdress of ostrich-feathers; why, in  Morocco, when you enter a mosque, you must take off your shoes and  catch a violent cold, in order to show your respect for Allah;  while in Europe, on entering a similar religious building, you must  uncover your head, no matter how draughty the place may be, since  the deity who presides there appears to be indifferent to the  danger of consumption or chest-diseases for his worshippers; why  certain clothes or foods are prescribed in London or Paris for  Sundays and Fridays, while certain others, just equally warm or  digestible or the contrary, are perfectly lawful to all the world  alike on Tuesdays and Saturdays. These were the curious questions  he had come so far to investigate, for which the fakirs and  dervishes of every land gave such fanciful reasons: and he saw he  would have no difficulty in picking up abundant examples of his  subject-matter everywhere in England. As the metropolis of taboo,  it exhibited the phenomena in their highest evolution. The only  thing that puzzled him was how Philip Christy, an Englishman born,  and evidently a most devout observer of the manifold taboos and  juggernauts of his country, should actually deny their very  existence. It was one more proof to him of the extreme caution  necessary in all anthropological investigations before accepting  the evidence even of well-meaning natives on points of religious or  social usage, which they are often quite childishly incapable of  describing in rational terms to outside inquirers. They take their  own manners and customs for granted, and they cannot see them in  their true relations or compare them with the similar manners and  customs of other nationalities.
