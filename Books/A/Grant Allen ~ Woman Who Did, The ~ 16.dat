Not that Herminia had not at times hard struggles and sore  temptations. One of the hardest and sorest came when Dolly was  about six years old. And this was the manner of it.    
One day the child who was to reform the world was returning from  some errand on which her mother had sent her, when her attention was  attracted by a very fine carriage, stopping at a door not far from  their lodgings. Now Dolly had always a particular weakness for  everything "grand;" and so grand a turn-out as this one was rare in  their neighborhood. She paused and stared hard at it. "Whose is it,  Mrs. Biggs?" she asked awe-struck of the friendly charwoman, who  happened to pass at the moment,--the charwoman who frequently came  in to do a day's cleaning at her mother's lodging-house. Mrs. Biggs  knew it well; "It's Sir Anthony Merrick's," she answered in that  peculiarly hushed voice with which the English poor always utter the  names of the titled classes. And so in fact it was; for the famous  gout doctor had lately been knighted for his eminent services in  saving a royal duke from the worst effects of his own  self-indulgence. Dolly put one fat finger to her lip, and elevated  her eyebrows, and looked grave at once. Sir Anthony Merrick! What a  very grand gentleman he must be indeed, and how nice it must seem to  be able to drive in so distinguished a vehicle with a liveried  footman.    
As she paused and looked, lost in enjoyment of that beatific  vision, Sir Anthony himself emerged from the porch. Dolly took a  good stare at him. He was handsome, austere, close-shaven,  implacable. His profile was clear-cut, like Trajan's on an aureus.  Dolly thought that was just how so grand a gentleman ought to look;  and, so thinking, she glanced up at him, and with a flash of her  white teeth, smiled her childish approval. The austere old  gentleman, unwontedly softened by that cherub face,--for indeed she  was as winsome as a baby angel of Raphael's,--stooped down and  patted the bright curly head that turned up to him so trustfully.  "What's your name, little woman?" he asked, with a sudden wave of  gentleness.    
And Dolly, all agog at having arrested so grand an old gentleman's  attention, spoke up in her clear treble, "Dolores Barton."    
Sir Anthony started. Was this a trap to entangle him? He was born  suspicious, and he feared that woman. But he looked into Dolly's  blue eyes of wonder, and all doubt fled from him. Was it blood?  was it instinct? was it unconscious nature? At any rate, the  child seemed to melt the grandfather's heart as if by magic. Long  years after, when the due time came, Dolly remembered that melting.  To the profound amazement of the footman, who stood with the  carriage-door ready open in his hand, the old man bent down and  kissed the child's red lips. "God bless you, my dear!" he  murmured, with unwonted tenderness to his son's daughter. Then he  took out his purse, and drew from it a whole gold sovereign.  "That's for you, my child," he said, fondling the pretty golden  curls. "Take it home, and tell your mammy an old man in the street  gave it to you."    
But the coachman observed to the footman, as they drove on together  to the next noble patient's, "You may take your oath on it, Mr.  Wells, that little 'un there was Mr. Alan's love-child!"    
Dolly had never held so much money in her hand before; she ran  home, clutching it tight, and burst in upon Herminia with the  startling news that Sir Anthony Merrick, a very grand gentleman in  a very fine carriage, had given a gold piece to her.    
Gold pieces were rare in the calm little attic, but Herminia caught  her child up with a cry of terror; and that very same evening, she  changed the tainted sovereign with Dolly for another one, and sent  Sir Anthony's back in an envelope without a word to Harley Street.  The child who was born to free half the human race from aeons of  slavery must be kept from all contagion of man's gold and man's  bribery. Yet Dolly never forgot the grand gentleman's name, though  she hadn't the least idea why he gave that yellow coin to her.    
Out of this small episode, however, grew Herminia's great temptation.    
For Sir Anthony, being a man tenacious of his purpose, went home  that day full of relenting thoughts about that girl Dolores. Her  golden hair had sunk deep into his heart. She was Alan's own  child, after all; she had Alan's blue eyes; and in a world where  your daughters go off and marry men you don't like, while your sons  turn out badly, and don't marry at all to vex you, it's something  to have some fresh young life of your blood to break in upon your  chilly old age and cheer you. So the great doctor called a few  days later at Herminia's lodgings, and having first ascertained  that Herminia herself was out, had five minutes' conversation alone  with her landlady.    
There were times, no doubt, when Mrs. Barton was ill? The landlady  with the caution of her class, admitted that might be so. And  times no doubt when Mrs. Barton was for the moment in arrears with  her rent? The landlady, good loyal soul, demurred to that  suggestion; she knit her brows and hesitated. Sir Anthony hastened  to set her mind at rest. His intentions were most friendly. He  wished to keep a watch,--a quiet, well-meaning, unsuspected watch,--  over Mrs. Barton's necessities. He desired, in point of fact, if  need were, to relieve them. Mrs. Barton was distantly connected  with relations of his own; and his notion was that without seeming  to help her in obtrusive ways, he would like to make sure Mrs.  Barton got into no serious difficulties. Would the landlady be so  good--a half sovereign glided into that subservient palm--as to let  Sir Anthony know if she ever had reason to suspect a very serious  strain was being put on Mrs. Barton's resources?    
The landlady, dropping the modern apology for a courtesy, promised  with effusion under pressure of hard cash, to accede to Sir  Anthony's benevolent wishes. The more so as she'd do anything to  serve dear Mrs. Barton, who was always in everything a perfect  lady, most independent, in fact; one of the kind as wouldn't be  beholden to anybody for a farthing.    
Some months passed away before the landlady had cause to report to  Sir Anthony. But during the worst depths of the next London  winter, when gray fog gathered thick in the purlieus of Marylebone,  and shivering gusts groaned at the street corners, poor little  Dolly caught whooping-cough badly. On top of the whooping-cough  came an attack of bronchitis; and on top of the bronchitis a  serious throat trouble. Herminia sat up night after night, nursing  her child, and neglecting the work on which both depended for  subsistence. Week by week things grew worse and worse; and Sir  Anthony, kept duly informed by the landlady, waited and watched,  and bided his time in silence. At last the case became desperate.  Herminia had no money left to pay her bill or buy food; and one  string to her bow after another broke down in journalism. Her  place as the weekly lady's-letter writer to an illustrated paper  passed on to a substitute; blank poverty stared her in the face,  inevitable. When it came to pawning the type-writer, as the  landlady reported, Sir Anthony smiled a grim smile to himself. The  moment for action had now arrived. He would put on pressure to get  away poor Alan's illegitimate child from that dreadful woman.    
Next day he called. Dolly was dangerously ill,--so ill that  Herminia couldn't find it in her heart to dismiss the great doctor  from her door without letting him see her. And Sir Anthony saw  her. The child recognized him at once and rallied, and smiled at  him. She stretched her little arms. She must surely get well if a  gentleman who drove in so fine a carriage, and scattered sovereigns  like ha'pennies, came in to prescribe for her. Sir Anthony was  flattered at her friendly reception. Those thin small arms touched  the grandfather's heart. "She will recover," he said; "but she  needs good treatment, delicacies, refinements." Then he slipped  out of the room, and spoke seriously to Herminia. "Let her come to  me," he urged. "I'll adopt her, and give her her father's name.  It will be better for herself; better for her future. She shall be  treated as my granddaughter, well-taught, well-kept; and you may  see her every six months for a fortnight's visit. If you consent,  I will allow you a hundred a year for yourself. Let bygones be  bygones. For the child's sake, say <i>yes</i>! She needs so much that  you can never give her!"    
Poor Herminia was sore tried. As for the hundred a year, she  couldn't dream of accepting it; but like a flash it went through  her brain how many advantages Dolly could enjoy in that wealthy  household that the hard-working journalist could not possibly  afford her. She thought of the unpaid bills, the empty cupboard,  the wolf at the door, the blank outlook for the future. For a  second, she half hesitated. "Come, come!" Sir Anthony said; "for  the child's own sake; you won't be so selfish as to stand in her  way, will you?"    
Those words roused Herminia to a true sense of her duty. "Sir  Anthony Merrick," she said holding her breath, "that child is my  child, and my dear dead Alan's. I owe it to Alan,--I owe it to  her,--to bring her up in the way that Alan would approve of. I  brought her into the world; and my duty is to do what I can to  discharge the responsibilities I then undertook to her. I must  train her up to be a useful citizen. Not for thousands would I  resign the delight and honor of teaching my child to those who  would teach her what Alan and I believed to be pernicious; who  would teach her to despise her mother's life, and to reject the  holy memory of her father. As I said to you before, that day at  Perugia, so I say to you now, 'Thy money perish with thee.' You  need never again come here to bribe me."    
"Is that final?" Sir Anthony asked. And Herminia answered with a  bow, "Yes, final; quite final."    
Sir Anthony bent his head and left. Herminia stood face to face  with abject poverty. Spurred by want, by indignation, by terror,  by a sense of the absolute necessity for action, she carried her  writing materials then and there into Dolly's sick-room, and  sitting by her child's cot, she began to write, she hardly knew  what, as the words themselves came to her. In a fever of  excitement she wrote and wrote and wrote. She wrote as one writes  in the silence of midnight. It was late before she finished. When  her manuscript was complete, she slipped out and posted it to a  weekly paper. It appeared that same Saturday, and was the  beginning of Herminia's most valuable connection.    
But even after she had posted it the distracted mother could not  pause or rest. Dolly tossed and turned in her sleep, and Herminia  sat watching her. She pined for sympathy. Vague ancestral  yearnings, gathering head within her, made her long to pray,--if  only there had been anybody or anything to pray to. She clasped  her bloodless hands in an agony of solitude. Oh, for a friend to  comfort! At last her overwrought feelings found vent in verse.  She seized a pencil from her desk, and sitting by Dolly's side,  wrote down her heart-felt prayer, as it came to her that moment,--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>A crowned Caprice is god of the world: <br>On his stony breast are his white wings furled. <br>No ear to hearken, no eye to see, <br>No heart to feel for a man hath he. <br> <br>But his pitiless hands are swift to smite, <br>And his mute lips utter one word of might <br>In the clash of gentler souls and rougher-- <br>'Wrong must thou do, or wrong must suffer.' <br> <br>Then grant, O dumb, blind god, at least that we <br>Rather the sufferers than the doers be.</small></i></blockquote> <br>
