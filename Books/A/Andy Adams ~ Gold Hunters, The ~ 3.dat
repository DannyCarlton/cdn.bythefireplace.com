  The cries came nearer, interspersed with the cracking of Mukoki's  whip as he urged on the few lagging dogs that Wabi had left with him  upon the trail. In another moment the old warrior and his team burst  into view and both of the young hunters hurried to meet him. A glance  showed Rod that a little longer and Mukoki would have dropped in his  tracks, as Wabi had done. The two led their faithful comrade to the  heap of bearskins on the mail sled and made him sit there while fresh  soup was being made.
  &#8220;You catch heem,&#8221; grinned Mukoki joyously. &#8220;You catch heem&#8212;queek!&#8221;
  &#8220;And pretty nearly killed himself doing it, Muky,&#8221; added Rod.  &#8220;Now&#8212;&#8221; he glanced from one to the other of his companions, &#8220;what is  the first thing to be done?&#8221; &#8220;We must strike for the Woonga trail  without a moment of unnecessary delay,&#8221; declared Wabi. &#8220;Minutes are  priceless, an hour lost or gained may mean everything!&#8221;
  &#8220;But the dogs&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You can take mine,&#8221; interrupted the courier. &#8220;There are six of  them, all good heavy fellows and not overly bushed. You can add a few  of your own and I'll take what's left to drive on the mail. I would  advise you to rest for an hour or so and give them and yourselves a  good feed. It'll count in the long run.&#8221;
  Mukoki grunted his approval of the driver's words and Rod at once  began gathering more fuel for the fire. The temporary camp was soon a  scene of the liveliest activity. While the courier unpacked his  provisions, Mukoki and Wabigoon assembled the teams and proceeded to  select three of the best of their own animals to put in harness with  those of the Hudson Bay mail. The dogs from Wabinosh House were wildly  famished and at the sight and odor of the great piece of meat which the  courier began cutting up for them they set up a snarling and snapping  of jaws, and began fighting indiscriminately among themselves until the  voices of their human companions were almost drowned in the tumult. A  full pound of the meat was given to each dog, and other pieces of it  were suspended over beds of coals drawn out from the big fire.  Meanwhile Rod was chopping through the thick ice of the lake in search  of water.
  After a little Wabi came down to join him.
  &#8220;Our sledge is ready,&#8221; he said, as Rod stopped to rest for a moment.  &#8220;We're a little short on grub for nine dogs and three people, but we've  got plenty of ammunition. We ought to find something on the trail.&#8221;
  &#8220;Rabbits, anyway,&#8221; suggested Rod, resuming his chopping. A few more  strokes, and water gushed through. Filling two pails the boys returned  to camp.
  The shadows from the sharp pointed cedars of the forest were falling  far out upon the frozen lake when the meal was finished, and the sun,  sinking early to its rest beyond the homeless solitudes, infused but  little warmth as the three hunters prepared to leave. It was only three  o'clock, but a penetrating chill was growing in the air. Half an hour  more and only a reddish glow would be where the northern sun still  shone feebly. In the far North winter night falls with the swiftness of  wings; it enshrouds one like a palpable, moving thing, a curtain of  gloom that can almost be touched and felt, and so it came now, as the  dogs were hitched to their sledge and Rod, Mukoki and Wabigoon bade  good-by to the driver of the Hudson Bay mail.
  &#8220;You'll make the other side in four hours,&#8221; he called, as Mukoki's  cries sent the dogs trotting out upon the lake. &#8220;And then&#8212;I'd camp!&#8221;
  Running on ahead Mukoki set the pace and marked the trail. Wabi took  the first turn on the sledge, and Rod, who was fresher than either of  his comrades, followed close behind. After a little he drew up beside  the young Indian and placed a hand on his shoulder as he ran.
  &#8220;We will reach our old camp&#8212;in the plain&#8212;to-morrow?&#8221; he  questioned, between breaths.
  &#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; affirmed Wabi. &#8220;Mukoki will show us the shortest cut to  it. After that, after we reach the camp, everything will depend upon  you.&#8221;
  Rod fell behind in the path made by the sledge, and saved his  breath. His mind was working as never before in his life. When they  reached the camp in which the wounded Mukoki had lain after their  escape from the Woongas, could he find the old trail where he had seen  Minnetaki's footprints? He was quite sure of himself, and yet he was  conscious of an indefinable something growing in him as he noticed more  and more what the sun had done that day. Was it nervousness, or fear?  Surely he could find the trail, even though it was almost obliterated!  But he wished that it had been Mukoki or Wabigoon who had discovered  it, either of whom, with the woodcraft instinct born in them, would  have gone to it as easily as a fox to the end of a strong trail hidden  in autumn leaves. If he did fail&#8212;He shuddered, even as he ran, as he  thought of the fate that awaited Minnetaki. A few hours before he had  been one of the happiest youths in the world. Wabi's lovely little  sister, he had believed, was safe at Kenegami House; he had bade adieu  to his friends at the Post; every minute after that had taken him  nearer to that far city in the South, to his mother, and home. And now  so suddenly that he had hardly come to realize the situation he was  plunged into what gave promise of being the most thrilling and tragic  adventure of his life. A few weeks more, when spring had come, he would  have returned to his friends accompanied by his mother, and they  three&#8212;Mukoki, Wabigoon and he&#8212;would have set out on their romantic  quest for the lost gold-mine that had been revealed to them by the  ancient skeletons in the old cabin. Even as these visions were glowing  in his brain there had come the interruption, the signal shots on the  lake, the return of the dog mail, and now this race to save the life of  Minnetaki!
  In his eagerness he ran ahead of the sledge and urged Mukoki into a  faster pace. Every ten minutes the one who rode exchanged place with  one of the runners, so that there were intervals of rest for each two  times an hour. Quickly the red glow over the southwestern forests faded  away; the gloom grew thicker; far ahead, like an endless sheet losing  itself in a distant smother of blackness, stretched the ice and snow of  Lake Nipigon. There was no tree, no rock for guidance over the  trackless waste, yet never for an instant did Mukoki or Wabigoon  falter. The stars began burning brilliantly in the sky; far away the  red edge of the moon rose over this world of ice and snow and forest,  throbbing and palpitating like a bursting ball of fire, as one sees it  now and then in the glory of the great northern night.
  Tirelessly, mile after mile, hour after hour, broken only by the  short intervals of rest on the sledge, continued the race across Lake  Nipigon. The moon rose higher; the blood in it paled to the crimson  glow of the moose flower, and silvered as it climbed into the sky,  until the orb hung like a great golden-white disk. In the splendor of  it the solitude of ice and snow glistened without end. There was no  sound but the slipping of the sledge, the pattering of the dogs'  moccasined feet, and now and then a few breathless words spoken by Rod  or his companions. It was a little after eight o'clock by Rod's watch  when there came a change in the appearance of the lake ahead of them.  Wabi, who was on the sledge, was the first to notice it, and he shouted  back his discovery to the white youth.
  &#8220;The forest! We're across!&#8221;
  The tired dogs seemed to leap into new life at his words, and the  leader replied with a whining joyous cry as the odors of balsam and fir  came to him. The sharp pinnacles of the forest, reaching up into the  night's white glow, grew more and more distinct as the sledge sped on,  and five minutes later the team drew up in a huddled, panting bunch on  the shore. That day the men and dogs from Wabinosh House had traveled  sixty miles.
  &#8220;We'll camp here!&#8221; declared Wabi, as he dropped on the sledge.  &#8220;We'll camp here&#8212;unless you leave me behind!&#8221;
  Mukoki, tireless to the last, had already found an ax.
  &#8220;No rest now,&#8221; he warned, &#8220;Too tired! You rest now&#8212;build no camp.  Build camp&#8212;then rest!&#8221;
  &#8220;You're right, Muky,&#8221; cried Wabi, jumping to his feet with forced  enthusiasm. &#8220;If I sit down for five minutes I'll fall asleep. Rod, you  build a fire. Muky and I will make the shelter.&#8221;
  In less than half an hour the balsam bough shelter was complete, and  in front of it roared a fire that sent its light and heat for twenty  paces round. From farther back in the forest the three dragged several  small logs, and no sooner had they been added to the flames than both  Mukoki and Wabigoon wrapped themselves in their furs and burrowed deep  into the sweet-scented balsam under the shelter. Rod's experience that  day had not been filled with the terrible hardships of his companions,  and for some time after they had fallen asleep he sat close to the  fire, thinking again of the strangeness with which his fortunes had  changed, and watching the flickering firelight as it played in a  thousand fanciful figures in the deeper and denser gloom of the forest.  The dogs had crept in close to the blazing logs and lay as still as  though life no longer animated their tawny bodies. From far away there  came the lonely howl of a wolf; a great white man-owl fluttered close  to the camp and chortled his crazy, half-human &#8220;hello, hello, hello;&quot;  the trees cracked with the tightening frost, but neither wolf howl nor  frost nor the ghostly visitant's insane voice aroused those who were  sleeping.
  An hour passed and still Rod sat by the fire; his rifle lying across  his knees. His imagination had painted a thousand pictures in that  time. Never for an instant had his mind ceased to work. Somewhere in  that great wilderness there was another camp-fire that night, and in  that camp Minnetaki was a captive. Some indefinable sensation seemed to  creep into him, telling him that she was awake, and that she was  thinking of her friends. Was it a touch of sleep, or that wonderful  thing called mental telepathy, that wrought the next picture in his  brain? It came with startling vividness. He saw the girl beside a fire.  Her beautiful hair, glistening black in the firelight, hung in a heavy  braid over her shoulder; her eyes were staring wildly into the flames,  as if she were about to leap into them, and back of her so close that  he might have touched her, was a figure that sent a chill of horror  through him. It was Woonga, the outlaw chief! He was talking, his red  face was fiendish, he stretched out a hand!
  With a cry that startled the dogs Rod sprang to his feet. He was  shivering as if in a chill. Had he dreamed? Or was it something more  than a dream? He thought of the vision that had come to him weeks  before in the mysterious chasm, the vision of the dancing skeletons,  and which had revealed the secret of the old cabin and the lost gold.  In vain he tried to shake off his nervousness and his fear. Why had  Woonga reached out his hands for Minnetaki? He worked to free himself  of the weight that had fallen on him, stirred the fire until clouds of  sparks shot high up into the gloom of the trees, and added new fuel.
  Then he sat down again, and for the twentieth time since leaving  Wabinosh House drew from his pocket the map that was to have led them  on their search for gold when he returned with his mother. It was a  vision that had guided him to the discovery of this precious map, and  the knowledge of it made him more uneasy now. A few moments before he  had seen Minnetaki as plainly as though she had been with him there  beside the fire; he fancied that he might almost have sent a bullet  through the Indian's chief face as he reached out his long arms toward  the girl.
  He stirred the fire again, awakened one of the dogs to keep him  company, and then went in to lie down between Mukoki and Wabigoon in an  attempt at slumber. During the hours that followed he secured only  short snatches of sleep. He dreamed, dreamed constantly of Minnetaki  whenever he lost consciousness. Now he saw her before the fire, as he  had seen her in his vision; again, she was struggling in the Woonga's  powerful grasp. At one time the strife between the two&#8212;the young girl  and the powerful savage&#8212;became terrible for him to behold, and at last  he saw the Indian catch her in his arms and disappear into the  blackness of the forest.
  This time when he wakened Rod made no further effort to sleep. It  was only a little past midnight. His companions had obtained four hours  of rest. In another hour he would arouse them. Quietly he began making  preparations for breakfast, and fed the dogs. At half-past one o'clock  he shook Wabigoon by the shoulder.
  &#8220;Get up!&#8221; he cried, as the Indian youth sat erect. &#8220;It's time to  go!&#8221;
  He tried to suppress his nervousness when Mukoki and Wabi joined him  beside the fire. He determined not to let them know of his visions, for  there was gloom enough among them as it was. But he would hurry. He was  the first to get through with breakfast, the first to set to work among  the dogs, and when Mukoki started out at the head of the team through  the forest he was close beside him, urging him to greater speed by his  own endeavors.
  &#8220;How far are we from the camp, Mukoki?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Four hour&#8212;twent' mile,&#8221; replied the old pathfinder.
  &#8220;Twenty miles. We ought to make it by dawn.&#8221;
  Mukoki made no answer, but quickened his pace as the cedar and  balsam forest gave place to an open plain which stretched for a mile or  two ahead of them. For an hour longer the moon continued to light up  the wilderness; then, with its descent lower and lower into the west,  the gloom began to thicken, until only the stars were left to guide the  pursuers. Even these were beginning to fade when Mukoki halted the  panting team on the summit of a mountainous ridge, and pointed into the  north.
  &#8220;The plains!&#8221;
  For several minutes the three stood silent, gazing out into the  gloom of the vast solitudes that swept unbroken to Hudson Bay. Again  Rod's blood was thrilled with the romance of what lay at his feet and  far beyond, thrilled with the romance and mystery of that land of the  wild which reached for hundreds of miles into the North, and into which  the foot of the white man had as yet scarce left its imprint.
  Before him, enveloped now in the deep gloom of the northern night,  slept a vast unexplored world, a land whose story the passing of ages  had left unrevealed. What tragedies of nature had its silent fastnesses  beheld? What treasure did they hold? Half a century or more ago the men  whose skeletons they had found in the old cabin had braved the perils  of those trackless solitudes, and somewhere hundreds of miles out in  that black gloom they had found gold, the gold that had fallen as an  inheritance to them in the discovery of the old birch-bark map. And  somewhere, somewhere out there was Minnetaki!
  Across the plain at their feet the three adventurers had raced for  their lives from the bloodthirsty Woongas only a week or so before; now  they crossed it a second time and at even greater speed, for then they  had possessed no dogs. At the end of another hour Mukoki no longer  traveled faster than a walk. His eyes were constantly on the alert.  Occasionally he would stop the dogs and strike off to the right or the  left of the trail alone. He spoke no word to his companions, and  neither Rod nor Wabigoon offered a suggestion. They knew, without  questioning, that they were approaching their old camp, and just as the  experienced hunter makes no sign or sound while his dog is nosing out a  half-lost trail so they held back while Mukoki, the most famous  pathfinder in all those regions, led them slowly on. The last of the  stars went out. For a time the blackness of the night grew deeper;  then, in the southeast, came the first faint streak of dawn. Day is  born as suddenly as it dies in these regions, and it was soon light  enough for Mukoki to resume his trail at a trot. A few minutes more and  a clump of balsam and spruce loomed up out of the plain ahead of them.  Neither Rod nor Wahigoon recognized it until the old warrior halted the  dogs close in its shadows and they saw the look of triumph in his face.
  &#8220;The camp!&#8221; breathed Wabi.
  &#8220;The camp!&#8221;
  Trembling, his voice quivering with suppressed excitement, the  Indian youth turned to Roderick Drew.
  &#8220;Rod&#8212;it's all up to you!&#8221;
  Mukoki, too, had come close to his side.
  &#8220;There&#8212;camp!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Now&#8212;where Minnetaki's trail?&#8221;
  The old warrior's eyes were blazing.
  &#8220;Where?&#8221;
  A dozen paces away was the balsam shelter they had built. But that  was all. Not a track was left in the snow. The warm sun had obliterated  every sign of their presence of a short time before!
  If their own trail was gone what could he hope to find of  Minnetaki's dainty foot-prints?
  Deep down in his heart Rod prayed for guidance in this moment of  terrible doubt.
