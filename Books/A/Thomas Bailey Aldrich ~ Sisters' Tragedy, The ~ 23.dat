Like Crusoe, walking by the lonely strand<br> And seeing a human footprint on the sand,<br> Have I this day been startled, finding here,<br> Set in brown mould and delicately clear,<br> Spring's footprint--the first crocus of the year!<br> O sweet invasion! Farewell solitude!<br> Soon shall wild creatures of the field and wood<br> Flock from all sides with much ado and stir,<br> And make of me most willing prisoner!
