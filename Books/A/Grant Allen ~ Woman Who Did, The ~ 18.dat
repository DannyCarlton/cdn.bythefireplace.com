And yet our Herminia was a woman after all. Some three years  later, when Harvey Kynaston came to visit her one day, and told her  he was really going to be married,--what sudden thrill was this  that passed through and through her. Her heart stood still. She  was aware that she regretted the comparative loss of a very near  and dear acquaintance.    
She knew she was quite wrong. It was the leaven of slavery. But  these monopolist instincts, which have wrought more harm in the  world we live in than fire or sword or pestilence or tempest,  hardly die at all as yet in a few good men, and die, fighting hard  for life, even in the noblest women.    
She reasoned with herself against so hateful a feeling. Though she  knew the truth, she found it hard to follow. No man indeed is  truly civilized till he can say in all sincerity to every woman of  all the women he loves, to every woman of all the women who love  him, "Give me what you can of your love and of yourself; but never  strive for my sake to deny any love, to strangle any impulse that  pants for breath within you. Give me what you can, while you can,  without grudging, but the moment you feel you love me no more,  don't pollute your own body by yielding it up to a man you have  ceased to desire; don't do injustice to your own prospective  children by giving them a father whom you no longer respect, or  admire, or yearn for. Guard your chastity well. Be mine as much  as you will, as long as you will, to such extent as you will, but  before all things be your own; embrace and follow every instinct of  pure love that nature, our mother, has imparted within you." No  woman, in turn, is truly civilized till she can say to every man of  all the men she loves, of all the men who love her, "Give me what  you can of your love, and of yourself; but don't think I am so  vile, and so selfish, and so poor as to desire to monopolize you.  Respect me enough never to give me your body without giving me your  heart; never to make me the mother of children whom you desire not  and love not." When men and women can say that alike, the world  will be civilized. Until they can say it truly, the world will be  as now a jarring battlefield for the monopolist instincts.    
Those jealous and odious instincts have been the bane of humanity.  They have given us the stiletto, the Morgue, the bowie-knife. Our  race must inevitably in the end outlive them. The test of man's  plane in the scale of being is how far he has outlived them. They  are surviving relics of the ape and tiger. But we must let the ape  and tiger die. We must cease to be Calibans. We must begin to be  human.    
Patriotism is the one of these lowest vices which most often  masquerades in false garb as a virtue. But what after all <i>is</i>  patriotism? "My country, right or wrong, and just because it is my  country!" This is clearly nothing more than collective selfishness.  Often enough, indeed, it is not even collective. It means merely,  "<i>My</i> business-interests against the business-interests of other  people, and let the taxes of my fellow-citizens pay to support  them." At other times it means pure pride of race, and pure lust of  conquest; "<i>My</i> country against other countries; <i>my</i> army and navy  against other fighters; <i>my</i> right to annex unoccupied territory  against the equal right of all other peoples; <i>my</i> power to oppress  all weaker nationalities, all inferior races." It <i>never</i> means or  can mean anything good or true. For if a cause be just, like  Ireland's, or once Italy's, then 'tis a good man's duty to espouse  it with warmth, be it his own or another's. And if a cause be bad,  then 'tis a good man's duty to oppose it, tooth and nail,  irrespective of your patriotism. True, a good man will feel more  sensitively anxious that strict justice should be done by the  particular community of which chance has made him a component member  than by any others; but then, people who feel acutely this joint  responsibility of all the citizens to uphold the moral right are not  praised as patriots but reviled as unpatriotic. To urge that our  own country should strive with all its might to be better, higher,  purer, nobler, more generous than other countries,--the only kind of  patriotism worth a moment's thought in a righteous man's eyes, is  accounted by most men both wicked and foolish.    
Then comes the monopolist instinct of property. That, on the face  of it, is a baser and more sordid one. For patriotism at least can  lay claim to some sort of delusive expansiveness beyond mere  individual interest; whereas property stops short at the narrowest  limits of personality. It is no longer "Us against the world!" but  "Me against my fellow-citizens!" It is the last word of the  intercivic war in its most hideous avatar. Look how it scars the  fair face of our common country with its antisocial notice-boards,  "Trespassers will be prosecuted." It says in effect, "This is my  land. As I believe, God made it; but I have acquired it, and  tabooed it to myself, for my own enjoyment. The grass on the wold  grows green; but only for me. The mountains rise glorious in the  morning sun; no foot of man, save mine and my gillies' shall tread  them. The waterfalls leap white from the ledge in the glen; avaunt  there, non-possessors; your eye shall never see them. For you the  muddy street; for me, miles of upland. All this is my own. And I  choose to monopolize it."    
Or is it the capitalist? "I will add field to field," he cries  aloud, despite his own Scripture; "I will join railway to railway.  I will juggle into my own hands all the instruments for the  production of wealth that my cunning can lay hold of; and I will  use them for my own purposes against producer and consumer alike  with impartial egoism. Corn and coal shall lie in the hollow of my  hand. I will enrich myself by making dear by craft the necessaries  of life; the poor shall lack, that I may roll down fair streets in  needless luxury. Let them starve, and feed me!" That temper, too,  humanity must outlive. And those who are incapable of outliving it  of themselves must be taught by stern lessons, as in the splendid  uprising of the spirit of man in France, that their race has  outstripped them.    
Next comes the monopoly of human life, the hideous wrong of  slavery. That, thank goodness, is now gone. 'Twas the vilest of  them all--the nakedest assertion of the monopolist platform:--"You  live, not for yourself, but wholly and solely for me. I disregard  your claims to your own body and soul, and use you as my chattel."  That worst form has died. It withered away before the moral  indignation even of existing humanity. We have the satisfaction of  seeing one dragon slain, of knowing that one monopolist instinct at  least is now fairly bred out of us.    
Last, and hardest of all to eradicate in our midst, comes the  monopoly of the human heart, which is known as marriage. Based upon  the primitive habit of felling the woman with a blow, stunning her  by repeated strokes of the club or spear, and dragging her off by  the hair of her head as a slave to her captor's hut or rock-shelter,  this ugly and barbaric form of serfdom has come in our own time by  some strange caprice to be regarded as of positively divine origin.  The Man says now to himself, "This woman is mine. Law and the Church  have bestowed her on me. Mine for better, for worse; mine, drunk or  sober. If she ventures to have a heart or a will of her own, woe  betide her! I have tabooed her for life: let any other man touch  her, let her so much as cast eyes on any other man to admire or  desire him--and, knife, dagger, or law-court, they shall both of  them answer for it." There you have in all its native deformity  another monopolist instinct--the deepest-seated of all, the  grimmest, the most vindictive. "She is not yours," says the moral  philosopher of the new dispensation; "she is her own; release her!  The Turk hales his offending slave, sews her up in a sack, and casts  her quick into the eddying Bosphorus. The Christian Englishman, with  more lingering torture, sets spies on her life, drags what he thinks  her shame before a prying court, and divorces her with contumely.  All this is monopoly, and essentially slavery. Mankind must outlive  it on its way up to civilization."    
And then the Woman, thus taught by her lords, has begun to retort  in these latter days by endeavoring to enslave the Man in return.  Unable to conceive the bare idea of freedom for both sexes alike,  she seeks equality in an equal slavery. That she will never  achieve. The future is to the free. We have transcended serfdom.  Women shall henceforth be the equals of men, not by levelling down,  but by levelling up; not by fettering the man, but by elevating,  emancipating, unshackling the woman.    
All this Herminia knew well. All these things she turned over in  her mind by herself on the evening of the day when Harvey Kynaston  came to tell her of his approaching marriage. Why, then, did she  feel it to some extent a disappointment? Why so flat at his  happiness? Partly, she said to herself, because it is difficult to  live down in a single generation the jealousies and distrusts  engendered in our hearts by so many ages of harem life. But more  still, she honestly believed, because it is hard to be a free soul  in an enslaved community. No unit can wholly sever itself from the  social organism of which it is a corpuscle. If all the world were  like herself, her lot would have been different. Affection would  have been free; her yearnings for sympathy would have been filled  to the full by Harvey Kynaston or some other. As it was, she had  but that one little fraction of a man friend to solace her; to  resign him altogether to another woman, leaving herself bankrupt of  love, was indeed a bitter trial to her.    
Yet for her principles' sake and Dolly's, she never let Harvey  Kynaston or his wife suspect it; as long as she lived, she was a  true and earnest friend at all times to both of them.
