  Of all the living creatures in this sleeping valley, Thor was the  busiest. He was a bear with individuality, you might say. Like some  people, he went to bed very early; he began to get sleepy in October,  and turned in for his long nap in November. He slept until April, and  usually was a week or ten days behind other bears in waking. He was a  sound sleeper, and when awake he was very wide awake. During April and  May he permitted himself to doze considerably in the warmth of sunny  rocks, but from the beginning of June until the middle of September he  closed his eyes in real sleep just about four hours out of every  twelve.
  He was very busy as Langdon began his cautious climb up the gully.  He had succeeded in getting his gopher, a fat, aldermanic old patriarch  who had disappeared in one crunch and a gulp, and he was now absorbed  in finishing off his day's feast with an occasional fat, white grub and  a few sour ants captured from under stones which he turned over with  his paw.
  In his search after these delicacies Thor used his right paw in  turning over the rocks. Ninety-nine out of every hundred  bears&#8212;probably a hundred and ninety-nine out of every two hundred&#8212;are  left-handed; Thor was right-handed. This gave him an advantage in  fighting, in fishing, and in stalking meat, for a grizzly's right arm  is longer than his left&#8212;so much longer that if he lost his sixth sense  of orientation he would be constantly travelling in a circle.
  In his quest Thor was headed for the gully. His huge head hung close  to the ground. At short distances his vision was microscopic in its  keenness; his olfactory nerves were so sensitive that he could catch  one of the big rock-ants with his eyes shut.
  He would choose the flat rocks mostly. His huge right paw, with its  long claws, was as clever as a human hand. The stone lifted, a sniff or  two, a lick of his hot, flat tongue, and he ambled on to the next.
  He took this work with tremendous seriousness, much like an elephant  hunting for peanuts hidden in a bale of hay. He saw no humour in the  operation. As a matter of fact, Nature had not intended there should be  any humour about it. Thor's time was more or less valueless, and during  the course of a summer he absorbed in his system a good many hundred  thousand sour ants, sweet grubs, and juicy insects of various kinds,  not to mention a host of gophers and still tinier rock-rabbits. These  small things all added to the huge rolls of fat which it was necessary  for him to store up for that &#8220;absorptive consumption&#8221; which kept him  alive during his long winter sleep. This was why Nature had made his  little greenish-brown eyes twin microscopes, infallible at distances of  a few feet, and almost worthless at a thousand yards.
  As he was about to turn over a fresh stone Thor paused in his  operations. For a full minute he stood nearly motionless. Then his head  swung slowly, his nose close to the ground. Very faintly he had caught  an exceedingly pleasing odour. It was so faint that he was afraid of  losing it if he moved. So he stood until he was sure of himself, then  he swung his huge shoulders around and descended two yards down the  slope, swinging his head slowly from right to left, and sniffing. The  scent grew stronger. Another two yards down the slope he found it very  strong under a rock. It was a big rock, and weighed probably two  hundred pounds. Thor dragged it aside with his one right hand as if it  were no more than a pebble.
  Instantly there was a wild and protesting chatter, and a tiny  striped rock-rabbit, very much like a chipmunk, darted away just as  Thor's left hand came down with a smash that would have broken the neck  of a caribou.
  It was not the scent of the rock-rabbit, but the savour of what the  rock-rabbit had stored under the stone that had attracted Thor. And  this booty still remained&#8212;a half-pint of ground-nuts piled carefully  in a little hollow lined with moss. They were not really nuts. They  were more like diminutive potatoes, about the size of cherries, and  very much like potatoes in appearance. They were starchy and sweet, and  fattening. Thor enjoyed them immensely, rumbling in that curious  satisfied way deep down in his chest as he feasted. And then he resumed  his quest.
  He did not hear Langdon as the hunter came nearer and nearer up the  broken gully. He did not smell him, for the wind was fatally wrong. He  had forgotten the noxious man-smell that had disturbed and irritated  him an hour before. He was quite happy; he was good-humoured; he was  fat and sleek. An irritable, cross-grained, and quarrelsome bear is  always thin. The true hunter knows him as soon as he sets eyes on him.  He is like the rogue elephant.
  Thor continued his food-seeking, edging still closer to the gully.  He was within a hundred and fifty yards of it when a sound suddenly  brought him alert. Langdon, in his effort to creep up the steep side of  the gully for a shot, had accidentally loosened a rock. It went  crashing down the ravine, starting other stones that followed in a  noisy clatter. At the foot of the coulee, six hundred yards down, Bruce  swore softly under his breath. He saw Thor sit up. At that distance he  was going to shoot if the bear made for the break.
  For thirty seconds Thor sat on his haunches. Then he started for the  ravine, ambling slowly and deliberately. Langdon, panting and inwardly  cursing at his ill luck, struggled to make the last ten feet to the  edge of the slope. He heard Bruce yell, but he could not make out the  warning. Hands and feet he dug fiercely into shale and rock as he  fought to make those last three or four yards as quickly as possible.
  He was almost to the top when he paused for a moment and turned his  eyes upward. His heart went into his throat, and he started. For ten  seconds he could not move. Directly over him was a monster head and a  huge hulk of shoulder. Thor was looking down on him, his jaws agape,  his finger-long fangs snarling, his eyes burning with a greenish-red  fire.
  In that moment Thor saw his first of man. His great lungs were  filled with the hot smell of him, and suddenly he turned away from that  smell as if from a plague. With his rifle half under him Langdon had  had no opportunity to shoot. Wildly he clambered up the remaining few  feet. The shale and stones slipped and slid under him. It was a matter  of sixty seconds before he pulled himself over the top.
  Thor was a hundred yards away, speeding in a rolling, ball-like  motion toward the break. From the foot of the coulee came the sharp  crack of Otto's rifle. Langdon squatted quickly, raising his left knee  for a rest, and at a hundred and fifty yards began firing.
  Sometimes it happens that an hour&#8212;a minute&#8212;changes the destiny of  man; and the ten seconds which followed swiftly after that first shot  from the foot of the coulee changed Thor. He had got his fill of the  man-smell. He had seen man. And now he<I> felt</I> him.
  It was as if one of the lightning flashes he had often seen  splitting the dark skies had descended upon him and had entered his  flesh like a red-hot knife; and with that first burning agony of pain  came the strange, echoing roar of the rifles. He had turned up the  slope when the bullet struck him in the fore-shoulder, mushrooming its  deadly soft point against his tough hide, and tearing a hole through  his flesh&#8212;but without touching the bone. He was two hundred yards from  the ravine when it hit; he was nearer three hundred when the stinging  fire seared him again, this time in his flank.
  Neither shot had staggered his huge bulk, twenty such shots would  not have killed him. But the second stopped him, and he turned with a  roar of rage that was like the bellowing of a mad bull&#8212;a snarling,  thunderous cry of wrath that could have been heard a quarter of a mile  down the valley.
  Bruce heard it as he fired his sixth unavailing shot at seven  hundred yards. Langdon was reloading. For fifteen seconds Thor offered  himself openly, roaring his defiance, challenging the enemy he could no  longer see; and then at Langdon's seventh shot, a whiplash of fire  raked his back, and in strange dread of this lightning which he could  not fight, Thor continued up over the break. He heard other rifle  shots, which were like a new kind of thunder. But he was not hit again.  Painfully he began the descent into the next valley.
  Thor knew that he was hurt, but he could not comprehend that hurt.  Once in the descent he paused for a few moments, and a little pool of  blood dripped upon the ground under his foreleg. He sniffed at it  suspiciously and wonderingly.
  He swung eastward, and a little later he caught a fresh taint of the  man-smell in the air. The wind was bringing it to him now, and in spite  of the fact that he wanted to lie down and nurse his wound he ambled on  a little faster, for he had learned one thing that he would never  forget: the man-smell and his hurt had come together.
  He reached the bottoms, and buried himself in the thick timber; and  then, crossing this timber, he came to a creek. Perhaps a hundred times  he had travelled up and down this creek. It was the main trail that led  from one half of his range to the other.
  Instinctively he always took this trail when he was hurt or when he  was sick, and also when he was ready to den up for the winter. There  was one chief reason for this: he was born in the almost impenetrable  fastnesses at the head of the creek, and his cubhood had been spent  amid its brambles of wild currants and soap berries and its rich red  ground carpets of kinnikinic. It was home. In it he was alone. It was  the one part of his domain that he held inviolate from all other bears.  He tolerated other bears&#8212;blacks and grizzlies&#8212;on the wider and  sunnier slopes of his range just so long as they moved on when he  approached. They might seek food there, and nap in the sun-pools, and  live in quiet and peace if they did not defy his suzerainty.
  Thor did not drive other bears from his range, except when it was  necessary to demonstrate again that he was High Mogul. This happened  occasionally, and there was a fight. And always after a fight Thor came  into this valley and went up the creek to cure his wounds.
  He made his way more slowly than usual to-day. There was a terrible  pain in his fore-shoulder. Now and then it hurt him so that his leg  doubled up, and he stumbled. Several times he waded shoulder-deep into  pools and let the cold water run over his wounds. Gradually they  stopped bleeding. But the pain grew worse.
  Thor's best friend in such an emergency was a clay wallow. This was  the second reason why he always took this trail when he was sick or  hurt. It led to the clay wallow. And the clay wallow was his doctor.
  The sun was setting before he reached the wallow. His jaws hung open  a little. His great head drooped lower. He had lost a great deal of  blood. He was tired, and his shoulder hurt him so badly that he wanted  to tear with his teeth at the strange fire that was consuming it.
  The clay wallow was twenty or thirty feet in diameter, and hollowed  into a little shallow pool in the centre. It was a soft, cool,  golden-coloured clay, and Thor waded into it to his armpits. Then he  rolled over gently on his wounded side. The clay touched his hurt like  a cooling salve. It sealed the cut, and Thor gave a great heaving gasp  of relief. For a long time he lay in that soft bed of clay. The sun  went down, darkness came, and the wonderful stars filled the sky. And  still Thor lay there, nursing that first hurt of man.
