  Mrs. Burke remained a week longer to nurse Colonel Preston. At the  end of this time Mr. Preston thought he was well enough to dispense  with a nurse, and accordingly she prepared to take leave.
  &#8220;I shall always remember your kind service, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; said the  colonel, warmly.
  &#8220;It was only my duty, sir,&#8221; said the widow, modestly.
  &#8220;Not all would have done their duty so faithfully.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad to see you well again,&#8221; said the widow.
  &#8220;Not more than I am to get well, I assure you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Whenever  you are in any trouble, come to me.&#8221;
  With these words, he placed in her hands an envelope, which, as she  understood, contained the compensation for her services. She thanked  him, and took her departure.
  Mrs. Preston was curious to know how much her husband paid the  nurse, and asked the question.
  &#8220;A hundred dollars,&#8221; he replied.
  &#8220;A hundred dollars!&#8221; she repeated, in a tone which implied  disapproval. &#8220;I thought she agreed to come for ten dollars a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;So she did.&#8221;
  &#8220;She has not been here ten weeks; only about six.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is true, but she has richly earned all I gave her.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ten dollars a week I consider very handsome remuneration to one in  her position in life,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, pointedly.
  &#8220;Lucinda, but for her attention I probably should not have lived  through this sickness. Do you think a hundred dollars so much to pay  for your husband's life?&#8221;
  &#8220;You exaggerate the value of her services,&#8221; said his wife.
  &#8220;Dr. Townley says the same thing that I do.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are both infatuated with that woman,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston,  impatiently.
  &#8220;We only do her justice.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, well, have it your own way. But I should have only paid her  what I agreed to. It is a great windfall for her.&#8221;
  &#8220;She deserves it.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston said no more at this time, for she found her husband  too &#8220;infatuated,&#8221; as she termed it, to agree with her. She did,  however, open the subject to Godfrey when he came home, and he adopted  her view of the case.
  &#8220;She and her low son are trying to get all they can out of father,&#8221;  he said. &#8220;It's just like them.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I could make your father see it,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, &#8220;but he  seems prepossessed in her favor.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he can give a hundred dollars to her, he can give me a little  extra money; I'm going to ask him.&#8221;
  So he did the same evening.
  &#8220;Will you give me ten dollars, father?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;What for?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, for various things. I need it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I give you an allowance of three dollars a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have a good many expenses.&#8221;
  &#8220;That will meet all your reasonable expenses. I was far from having  as much money as that when I was of your age.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see why you won't give me the money,&#8221; said Godfrey,  discontentedly.
  &#8220;I don't think you need it.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are generous enough to others.&#8221;
  &#8220;To whom do you refer?&#8221;
  &#8220;You give plenty of money to that Irish boy and his mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;They have both rendered me great services. The boy saved me from  being robbed. The mother, in all probability, saved me from falling a  victim to smallpox. But that has nothing to do with your affairs. It is  scarcely proper for a boy like you to criticise his father's way of  disposing of his money.&#8221;
  &#8220;I confess I think Godfrey is right in commenting upon your  extraordinary liberality to the Burkes,&#8221; observed Mrs. Preston.
  &#8220;Lucinda,&#8221; said her husband, gravely, &#8220;when my own wife deserted my  sick bed, leaving me to wrestle alone with a terrible and dangerous  disease, I was fortunate enough to find in Mrs. Burke a devoted nurse.  The money I have paid her is no adequate compensation, nor is it all  that I intend to do for her.&#8221;
  There was a part of this speech that startled Mrs. Preston. Never  before had her husband complained of her desertion of him in his  sickness, and she hoped that he had been imposed upon by the excuse  which she gave of saving herself for Godfrey. Now she saw that in this  she had not been altogether successful, and she regretted having  referred to Mrs. Burke, and so brought this reproach upon herself. She  felt it necessary to say something in extenuation.
  &#8220;It was because I wanted to live for Godfrey,&#8221; she said, with a  flushed face. &#8220;Nothing but that would have taken me away from you at  such a time. It was a great trial to me,&#8221; she continued, putting up her  handkerchief to eyes that were perfectly dry.
  &#8220;We will say no more about it,&#8221; said Colonel Preston, gravely. &#8220;I  shall not refer to it, unless you undervalue my obligations to Mrs.  Burke.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston thought it best not to reply, but on one thing that her  husband had said, she commented to Godfrey.
  &#8220;Your father speaks of giving more money to Mrs. Burke. I suppose we  shall not know anything about it if he does.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps he will leave her some money in his will,&#8221; said Godfrey.
  &#8220;Very likely. If he does, there is such a thing as contesting a  will&#8212;that is, if he gives her much.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston was right. Her husband did intend to give his devoted  nurse something in his will, but of that more anon. There was one thing  which he did at once, and that was to buy the cottage which Mrs. Burke  occupied, from the heir, a non-resident. Mrs. Burke didn't learn this  until she went to pay her rent to the storekeeper, who had acted as  agent for the owner.
  &#8220;I have nothing to do with the house any longer, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; he  said.
  &#8220;Then who shall I pay rent to?&#8221; said Mrs. Burke.
  &#8220;To Colonel Preston, who has recently bought the house.&#8221;
  Mrs. Burke, therefore, called at the house of the colonel.
  Mr. and Mrs. Preston were sitting together when the servant  announced that she wished to speak to him.
  &#8220;You seem to have a good deal of business with Mrs. Burke,&#8221; said his  wife, in a very unpleasant tone.
  &#8220;None that I care to conceal,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;Show Mrs. Burke in  here, Jane,&#8221; he continued, addressing the servant.
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mrs. Burke,&#8221; he said, pleasantly.
  &#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, coldly.
  &#8220;Good-morning, sir, I'm glad to see you looking so much better.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, I am feeling pretty well now.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't find out till just now, Colonel Preston, that you were my  landlord.&#8221;
  Here Mrs. Preston pricked up her ears, for it was news to her also,  as her husband had not mentioned his recent purchase.
  &#8220;Yes, I thought I would buy the house, as it was in the market.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have come to pay my rent. I have been in the habit of paying  fifteen dollars a quarter.&#8221;
  &#8220;I won't be a hard landlord,&#8221; said Colonel Preston. &#8220;You are welcome  to live in the house, if it suits you, free of all rent.&#8221;
  &#8220;This is too much kindness,&#8221; said Mrs. Burke, quite overwhelmed by  the unexpected liberality.
  Mrs. Preston thought so, too, but could not well say anything.
  &#8220;There's been kindness on both sides, Mrs. Burke. Put up your money,  I don't want it, but I have no doubt you will find use for it. Buy  yourself a new dress.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Colonel Preston. You are very generous, and I am very  grateful,&#8221; said the widow.
  &#8220;I have something to be grateful for also, Mrs. Burke. If you want  any repairs, just let me know, and they shall be attended to.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, sir, but the house is very comfortable.&#8221;
  She soon took her leave.
  &#8220;When did you buy that house, Colonel Preston?&#8221; asked his wife.
  &#8220;A month since.&#8221;
  &#8220;You didn't say anything about it to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor to anyone else, except those with whom I did the business.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston would like to have said more, but she did not think it  expedient, remembering what she had brought upon herself before.
