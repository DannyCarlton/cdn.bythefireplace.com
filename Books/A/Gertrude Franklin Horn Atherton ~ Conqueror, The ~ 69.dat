Meanwhile, Washington, deeply disturbed by the arguments in the press  and Congress against the constitutionality of the National Bank, had  privately asked for the written opinions of Jefferson and Randolph, and  for a form of veto from Madison. They were so promptly forthcoming that  they might have been biding demand. Washington read them carefully,  then, too worried and impatient for formalities, carried them himself to  Hamilton's house.    
"For God's sake read them at once and tell me what they amount to," he  said, throwing the bundle of papers on the table. "Of course you must  prepare me an answer in writing, but I want your opinion at once. I will  wait."    
Long years after, when Betsey was an old woman, someone asked her if she  remembered any incidents in connection with the establishment of the  great Bank. She replied, "Yes, I remember it all distinctly. One day  General Washington called at the house, looking terribly worried. He  shut himself up in the study with my husband for hours, and they talked  nearly all the time. When he went away he looked much more cheerful.  That night my husband did not go to bed at all, but sat up writing; and  the next day we had a Bank."    
Hamilton's answer, both verbally and in a more elaborate form, was so  able and sound a refutation of every point advanced by the enemy that  Washington hesitated no longer and signed the bill during the last  moments remaining to him. Years later, when the same question was raised  again, Chief Justice Marshall, the most brilliant ornament, by common  consent, the Supreme Court of the United States has had, admitted that  he could add nothing to Hamilton's argument. It must, also, have  convinced Madison; for while President of the United States, and his  opportunity for displaying the consistencies of his intellect,  unrivalled, he signed the charter of the Second National Bank. Monroe,  whose party was in power, and able to defeat any obnoxious measure of  the Federalists, advocated; the second Bank as heartily as he had cursed  the first. His defence of his conduct was a mixture of insolent  frankness and verbiage. He said: "As to the constitutional objection, it  formed no serious obstacle. In voting against the Bank in the first  instance, I was governed essentially by policy. The construction I gave  to the Constitution I considered a strict one. In the latter instance it  was more liberal but, according to my judgement, justified by its  powers." If anyone can tell what he meant, doubtless his own shade would  be grateful.    
Hamilton's second Report on the Public Credit had beer buffeted about  quite as mercilessly as the Report in favour of a bank. The customs  officers had, during the past year collected $1,900,000, which sufficed  to pay two-thirds of the annual expenses of the Government. There was  still a deficit of $826,000, and to meet future contingencies of a  similar nature, the Secretary of the Treasury urged the passage of an  Excise Bill.    
Even his enemies admired his courage, for no measure could be more  unpopular, raise more widespread wrath. It was regarded as a deliberate  attempt to deprive man of his most cherished vice; and every argument  was brought forth in opposition, from the historic relation of whiskey  to health and happiness, to the menace of adopting another British  measure. The bill passed; but it was a different matter to enforce it,  as many an excise officer reflected, uncheerfully, whilst riding a rail.  On the 28th of January Hamilton sent in his Report in favour of the  establishment of a mint, with details so minute that he left the framers  of the necessary bill little excuse for delay; but it had the same  adventurous and agitated experience of its predecessors, and only limped  through, in an amended form, after the wildest outburst of democratic  fanaticism which any of the measures of Hamilton had induced. The  proposition to stamp the coins with the head of the President was  conclusive of an immediate design to place a crown upon the head of  Washington. Doubtless the leaders of the Federal party, under the able  tuition of their despot, had their titles ready, their mine laid.  Jefferson, in the Cabinet, protested with such solemn persistence  against so dangerous a precedent, and Hamilton perforated him with such  arrows of ridicule, that Washington exploded with wrath, and demanded to  know if neither never intended to yield a point to the other.    
During this session of Congress, Hamilton also sent in Reports on Trade  with India and China, and on the Dutch Loan. He was fortunate in being  able to forget his enemies for days and even weeks at a time, when his  existence was so purely impersonal that every capacity of his mind, save  the working, slept soundly. By now, he had his department in perfect  running order; and his successors have accepted his legacy, with its  infinitude of detail, its unvarying practicality, with gratitude and  trifling alterations. When Jefferson disposed himself in the Chair of  State, in 1801, he appointed Albert Gallatin--the ablest financier,  after Hamilton, the country has produced--Secretary of the Treasury, and  begged him to sweep the department clean of the corruption amidst which  Hamilton had sat and spun his devilish schemes. Gallatin, after a  thorough and conscientious search for political microbes, informed his  Chief that in no respect could the department be improved, that there  was not a trace of crime, past or present. Jefferson was disconcerted;  but, as a matter of fact, his administrations were passed complacently  amidst Hamilton legacies and institutions. Jefferson's hour had come. He  could undo all that he had denounced in his rival as monarchical,  aristocratical, pernicious to the life of Democracy. But the  administrations of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, ran from first to  last on those Federal wheels which are still in use, protected within  and without by Federal institutions. But their architect was sent to his  grave soon after the rise of his arch-enemy to power, was beyond  humiliation or party triumph; it would be folly to war with a spirit,  and greater not to let well enough alone. But that is a far cry.  Meanwhile the Bank was being rushed through, and its establishment was  anticipated with the keenest interest, and followed by a season of crazy  speculation, dissatisfaction, and vituperation. But this Hamilton had  expected, and he used his pen constantly to point out the criminal folly  and inevitable consequences of speculation.
