  Harry flattened himself against the wall and all his training and   inherited instincts came promptly to his service.  He knew that he,  too,  would be in the shadow there, where it was not likely that the  sentinels  could see him owing to the darkness of the night.  Then he  moved  cautiously toward the window where he had seen the outline. 
  The cold rain beat on his face and he saw the figures of the  sentinels  moving back and forth, but, black against the black wall, he  was  confident that he could not be seen by them.  Half way to the  window,  his eyes now having gotten used to the darkness, he knelt down  and  examined the earth, made soft by the rains.  He distinctly saw  footprints,  undoubtedly those of a man, leading by the edge of the  wall, and now he  knew that he had not been mistaken. 
  Harry came to the window himself, and, glancing in, he saw that the   merriment was going on unabated.  He continued his search, following  the  revealing foot prints.  He went nearly all the way around the  house and  then lost them among heavy shrubbery.  He surmised that at  this point the  spy&#8212;he was sure that it was a spy and sure, too, that  it was Shepard&#8212;  had left the place, passing between the sentinels in  the rainy dark. 
  He spoke to the sentinels, who knew him well, and they were quite   confident that nobody had come within their lines.  But Harry, while   keeping his own counsel, held another opinion and he was equally  positive  about it.  He was returning to the house, when he heard the  tread of  hoofs, and then a horseman spoke with the sentinels.  He  looked back and  recognized Sherburne. 
  The young captain was holding himself erect in the saddle, but his  horse  and his uniform were covered with red mud.  There were heavy  black lines  under his eyes and his face, despite his will, showed  strong signs of  weariness.  Sure that his mission was important, Harry  went to him at  once. 
  &#8220;Is General Jackson inside?&#8221; asked Sherburne. 
  &#8220;Yes, and he has not yet gone to bed,&#8221; replied Harry, looking at  the  lighted windows. 
  &#8220;Then ask him if I can see him at once.  He sent my troop and me on  a  scout toward Romney this morning.  I have news, news that cannot  wait.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course, he'll see you.  Come inside.&#8221; 
  Sherburne slipped from his horse.  Harry noticed that it was not  his  usual elastic spring.  He seemed almost to fall to the ground, and  the  horse, no hand on the reins, still stood motionless, his head  drooping.  It was evident that Sherburne was in the last stages of  exhaustion,  and now that he came nearer his face showed great anxiety  as well as  weariness. 
  Harry opened the door promptly and pushed him inside.  Then he  helped him  off with his wet and muddy overcoat, pushed him into a  chair, and said: 
  &#8220;I'll announce you to General Jackson, and he'll see you at once.&#8221; 
  Harry knew that Jackson would not linger a second, when a messenger  of  importance came, and he went into the library where the minister  and the  general stood talking.  General Jackson held in one hand a  large  leather-covered volume, and with the forefinger of the other  hand he was  pointing to a paragraph in it.  The minister was saying  something that  Harry did not catch, but he believed that they were  arguing some disputed  point of Presbyterian doctrine. 
  When Jackson saw Harry he closed the book instantly, and put it on  the  shelf.  He had seen in the eyes of his aide that he was coming  with no  common message. 
  &#8220;Captain Sherburne is in the hall, sir,&#8221; said the boy.  &#8220;He has  come back  from the scout toward Romney.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; 
  The minister quietly slipped out, as Sherburne entered, but Jackson  bade  Harry remain, saying that he might have orders for him to carry. 
  &#8220;What have you to tell me, Captain Sherburne?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;We saw the patrols of the enemy, and we took two prisoners.  We  learned  that McClellan's army is showing signs of moving, and we saw  with our own  eyes that Banks and Shields are preparing for the same.   They threaten us  here in Winchester.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What force do you think Banks has?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He must have forty thousand men.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A good guess.  The figures of my spies say thirty-eight thousand,   and we can muster scarcely five thousand here.  We must move.&#8221; 
  Jackson spoke without emotion.  His words were cold and dry, even  formal.  Harry's heart sank.  If eight times their numbers were  advancing upon  them, then they must abandon Winchester.  They must  leave to the enemy  this pleasant little city, so warmly devoted to the  Southern cause and  confess weakness and defeat to these friends who  had done so much for  them during their stay. 
  He felt the full bitterness of the blow.  The people of the  South&#8212;little  immigration had gone there&#8212;were knit together more  closely by ties of  kinship than those of the North.  Harry through the  maternal line was,  like most Kentuckians, of Virginia descent, and  even here in Winchester  he had found cousins, more or less removed it  was true, but it was  kinship, nevertheless, and they had made the most  of it.  It would have  been easier for him were strangers instead of  friends to see their  retreat. 
  &#8220;Captain Sherburne, you will go to your quarters and sleep.  It is   obvious that you need rest,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;Mr. Kenton, you will wait   and take the orders that I am going to write.&#8221; 
  Sherburne saluted and withdrew promptly.  Jackson turned to a shelf  of  the library on which lay pen, ink and paper, and standing before it   rapidly wrote several notes.  It was his favorite attitude&#8212;habit of  his  West Point days&#8212;to write or read standing. 
  It took him less than five minutes to write the notes, and he  handed them  to Harry to deliver without delay to the brigade  commanders.  His tones  were incisive and charged with energy.  Harry  felt the electric thrill  pass to himself, and with a quick salute he  was once more out in the rain. 
  Some of the brigadiers were asleep, and grumbled when Harry awoke  them,  but the orders soon sent the last remnants of sleep flying.  The  boy did  not linger, but returned quickly to the manse, where General  Jackson met  him at the door.  Other aides were coming or going, but  all save one or  two windows of the house were dark now, and the  merrymaking was over. 
  &#8220;You have delivered the orders?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;Yes, sir, all of them.&#8221; 
  Harry also told then of the face that he had seen at the window and  his  belief concerning its identity. 
  &#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said Jackson, &#8220;but we cannot pursue him now.  Now go  to  headquarters and sleep, but I shall want you at dawn.&#8221; 
  Harry was ready before the first sunlight, and that day  consternation  spread through Winchester.  The enemy was about to  advance in  overwhelming force, and Jackson was going to leave them.   Johnston was  retreating before McClellan, and Jackson in the valley  must retreat  before Banks. 
  There could be no doubt about the withdrawal of Jackson.  The   preparations were hurried forward with the utmost vigor.  A train took   the sick to Staunton, and in one of the coaches went Mrs. Jackson to  her  father's home.  Town and camp were filled with talk of march and  battle,  and the younger rejoiced.  They felt that a month of waiting  had made  them rusty. 
  Amid all the bustle Jackson found time to attend religious  services,  and also ordered every wagon that reached the camp with  supplies to be  searched.  If liquor were found it was thrown at once  upon the ground.  The soldiers, even the recruits, knew that they were  to follow a  God-fearing man.  Oliver Cromwell had come back to earth.   But most of  the soldiers were now disciplined thoroughly.  The month  they had spent  at Winchester after the great raid had been devoted  mostly to drill. 
  The day of departure came and the army, amid the good wishes of  many  friends in Winchester, filed out of the town.  The great rains,  which,  it had seemed, would never cease, had ceased at last.  There  was a touch  of spring in the air, and in sheltered places the grass  was taking on  deep tints of green. 
  During all the days of preparation Jackson had said nothing about  his  plan of retreat.  The Virginians, lining the streets and watching  so  anxiously, did not know where he would seek refuge.  And suddenly  as they  watched, a cheer, tremendous and involuntary, burst from them. 
  The heads of Jackson's columns were turned north.  He was not  marching  away from the enemy.  He was marching toward him.  But the  burst of  elation was short.  Even the civilians in Winchester knew  that Jackson  was hugely outnumbered. 
  Harry himself was astonished, and he gazed at his leader.  What   fathomless purpose lay beneath that stern, bearded face?  Jackson's  eyes  expressed nothing.  He and he alone knew what was in his mind. 
  But the troops asked no word from their leaders.  The fact that  their  faces were turned toward the north was enough for them.  They  knew, too,  of the heavy odds that were against them, but they were not  afraid. 
  As Harry watched the young soldiers, many of whom sang as they  marched,  his own enthusiasm rose.  He had seen companies in brilliant  uniforms at  Richmond, but no parade soldiers were here.  There were  few glimpses of  color in the columns, but the men marched with a  strong, elastic step.  They had all been born upon the farms or in the  little villages, and they  were familiar with the hills and forests.   They had been hunters, too,  as soon as their arms were strong enough  to hold rifle or shot gun.  Most of them had killed deer or bear in the  mountains, and all of them  had known how to ride from earliest  childhood.  They had endured every  hardship and they knew how to take  care of themselves in any kind of  country and in any kind of weather. 
  Harry smiled as he looked at their uniforms.  How different they  were  from some of the gay young companies of Charleston!  These  uniforms had  been spun for them and made for them by their own mothers  and wives and  sisters or sweethearts.  They were all supposed to be  gray, but there  were many shades of gray, sometimes verging to a light  blue, with  butternut as the predominant color.  They wore gray  jackets, short of  waist and single-breasted.  Caps were giving way to  soft felt hats,  and boots had already been supplanted by broad, strong  shoes, called  brogans. 
  Many of the soldiers carried frying pans and skillets hung on the  barrels  of their rifles, simple kitchen utensils which constituted  almost the  whole of their cooking equipment.  Their blankets and  rubber sheets for  sleeping were carried in light rolls on their backs.   A toothbrush was  stuck in a buttonhole.  On their flanks or in front  rode the cavalry,  led by the redoubtable Turner Ashby, and there was  in all their number  scarcely a single horseman who did not ride like  the Comanche Indian,  as if he were born in the saddle.  Ashby was a  host in himself.  He had  often ridden as much as eighty miles a day to  inspect his own pickets and  those of the enemy, and it was told of him  that he had once gone inside  the Union lines in the disguise of a  horse doctor. 
  The Northern cavalry, unused to the saddle, compared very badly  with  those of the South in the early years of the war.  Ashby's men,  moreover,  rode over country that they had known all their lives.   There was no  forest footpath, no train among the hills hidden from  them.  But the  cannon of Jackson's army was inferior.  Here the  mechanical genius of the  North showed supreme. 
  Such was the little army of Jackson, somber to see, which marched  forth  upon a campaign unrivalled in the history of war.  The men whom  they were  to meet were of staunch stock and spirit themselves.  Banks,  their  commander, had worked in his youth as a common laborer in a  cotton mill,  and had forced himself up by vigor and energy, but  Shields was a veteran  of the Mexican War.  Most of the troops had come  from the west, and they,  too, were used to every kind of privation and  hardship. 
  Harry's duties carried him back and forth with the marching  columns,  but he lingered longest beside the Invincibles, only a  regiment now,  and that regiment composed almost wholly of Virginians.   St. Clair was  still in the smartest of uniforms, a contrast to the  others, and as he  nodded to Harry he told him that the troops expected  to meet the enemy  before night. 
  &#8220;I don't know how they got that belief,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I know it  extends  to all our men.  What about it, Harry?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Stonewall Jackson alone knows, and he's not telling.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They say that Banks is coming with ten to one!&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;but  it  might be worse than that.  It might be a hundred to one.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's hardly as bad as ten to one, Tom,&#8221; said Harry with a laugh.   &#8220;Ashby's men say it's only eight to one, and they know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's all right, then,&#8221; said Langdon, squaring his shoulders, and  looking  ferocious.  &#8220;Ten to one would be a little rough on us, but I  don't mind  eight to one at all! at all!  They say that the army of  Banks is not many  miles away.  Is it so, Harry?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose so.  That's the news the cavalry bring in.&#8221; 
  Harry rode on, saluting Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St.  Hilaire  as he passed.  They returned the salutes, but said nothing,  and in a few  minutes he was with General Jackson again. 
  It was now March, and the spring was making headway in the great  valley.  The first flush of green was over everything.  The snows were  gone,  the rains that followed were gone, too, and the earth was drying  rapidly  under the mild winds that blew from the mountains.  It was  evident to all  that the forces of war were unloosed with the departure  of winter. 
  The day was filled with excitement for Harry.  The great Federal  army was  now so near that the rival pickets were almost constantly in  touch.  Only stern orders from Jackson kept his fiery cavalry from  making attacks  which might have done damage, but not damage enough.   Banks, the Union  leader, eminent through politics rather than war,  having been Governor of  Massachusetts, showed the utmost caution.   Feeling secure in his numbers  he resolved to risk nothing until he  gained his main object&#8212;Winchester&#8212;  and the efforts of Turner Ashby  and his brilliant young lieutenants like  Sherburne, could not lead him  into any trap. 
  Night came and the Southern army stopped for supper and rest.  The   Northern army was then only four miles from Winchester, and within a  half  hour hostile pickets had been firing at one another.  Yet the men  ate  calmly and lay down under the trees.  Jackson called a council in  a  little grove.  General Garnett, the commander of the Stonewall  Brigade,  all the colonels of the regiments, and the most trusted young  officers of  his staff were present.  A little fire of fallen wood  lighted up the  anxious and earnest faces. 
  Jackson spoke rapidly.  Harry had never before seen him show so  much  emotion and outward fire.  He wanted to bring up all his men and  attack  the Union army at once.  He believed that the surprise and the  immense  dash of the Southern troops would overcome the great odds.   But the other  officers shook their heads sadly.  There had been a  confusion of orders.  Their own troops had been scattered and their  supply trains were far  away.  If they attacked they would surely fall. 
  Jackson reluctantly gave up his plan and walked gloomily away.  But  he  turned presently and beckoned to Harry and others of his staff.   His eyes  were shining.  Some strange mood seemed to possess him. 
  &#8220;Mount at once, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and ride with me.  I'm going  to  Winchester.&#8221; 
  One or two of the officers opened their mouths to protest, but  checked  the words when they saw Jackson's stern face.  They sprang  into the  saddle, and scorning possible attack or capture by roving  Union cavalry,  galloped to the town. 
  Jackson drew rein before the manse, where Dr. Graham was already  standing  at the open door to meet him, runners from the town carrying  ahead the  news that Jackson was returning with his staff.  It seemed  that something  the general had said to the minister the day before  troubled him.  Harry inferred from the words he heard that Jackson had  promised the  minister too much and now he was stung by conscience.   Doubtless he had  told Dr. Graham that he would never let the Federals  take Winchester,  and he had come to apologize for his mistake.  Harry  was not at all  surprised.  In fact, as he came to know him thoroughly,  he was never  surprised at anything this strange man and genius did. 
  Harry's surmise was right.  Jackson was torn with emotion at being   compelled to abandon Winchester, and he wanted to explain how it was  to  the friend whom he liked so well.  He had thoughts even yet of  striking  the enemy that night and driving him away.  Looking the  minister steadily  in the face, but not seeing him, seeing instead a  field of battle,  he said slowly, biting each word: 
  &#8220;I&#8212;will&#8212;yet&#8212;carry&#8212;out&#8212;this plan.  I&#8212;will&#8212;think.  It&#8212;must be  done.&#8221; 
  The minister said nothing, standing and staring at the general like  one  fascinated.  He had never seen Jackson that way before.  His face  was  lined with thought and his eyes burned like coals of fire.  His  hand  fiercely clinched the hilt of his sword.  He, who showed emotion  so  rarely, was overcome by it now. 
  But the fire in his eyes died, his head sank, and his hand fell  from his  sword. 
  &#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said sadly.  &#8220;I must not try it.  Too many of my brave  men  would fall.  I must withdraw, and await a better time.&#8221; 
  Saying good-by to his friend he mounted and rode in silence from   Winchester again, and silently the people saw him go.  His staff  followed  without a word.  When they reached a high hill overlooking  the town  Jackson paused and the others paused with him.  All turned as  if by one  accord and looked at Winchester. 
  The skies were clear and a silver light shone over the town.  It  was a  beautiful, luminous light and it heightened the beauty of spire,  roof,  and wall.  Jackson looked at it a long time, the place where he  had spent  such a happy month, and then, his eye blazing again, he  lifted his hand  and exclaimed with fierce energy: 
  &#8220;That is the last council of war I will ever hold!&#8221; 
  Harry understood him.  He knew that Jackson now felt that the  council had  been too slow and too timid.  Henceforth he would be the  sole judge of  attack and retreat.  But the general's emotion was  quickly suppressed.  Taking a last look at the little city that he  loved so well, he rode  rapidly away, and his staff followed closely at  his heels. 
  That was a busy and melancholy night.  The young troops, after all,   were not to fight the enemy, but were falling back.  Youth takes less   account than age of odds, and they did not wish to retreat.  Harry who   had seen that look upon Jackson's face, when he gazed back at  Winchester,  felt that he would strike some mighty counter-blow, but he  did not know  how or when. 
  The army withdrew slowly toward Strasburg, twenty-five miles away,   and the next morning the Union forces in overwhelming numbers occupied   Winchester.  Meantime the North was urging McClellan with his mighty  army  to advance on Richmond, and Stonewall Jackson and his few  thousands who  had been driven out of Winchester were forgotten.  The  right flank of  McClellan, defended by Banks and forty thousand men,  would be secure. 
  There was full warrant for the belief of McClellan.  It seemed to  Harry  as they retreated up the valley that they were in a hopeless  checkmate.  What could a few thousand men, no matter how brave and  hardy, do against  an army as large as that of Banks?  But he was  cheered somewhat by the  boldness and activity of the cavalry under  Ashby.  These daring horsemen  skirmished continually with the enemy,  and Harry, as he passed back and  forth with orders, saw much of it. 
  Once he drew up with the Invincibles, now a Virginia instead of a  South  Carolina regiment, and sitting on horseback with his old  friends, watched  the puffs of smoke to the rear, where Ashby's men  kept back the  persistent skirmishers of the North. 
  &#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said Harry to Colonel Talbot, &#8220;what do you think of it?   Shall we ever make headway against such a force?  Or shall we be   compelled to retreat until we make a junction with the main army under   General Johnston?&#8221; 
  Colonel Talbot glanced back at the puffs of white smoke, and  suddenly his  eyes seemed to flash with the fire that Harry had seen in  Jackson's when  he looked upon the Winchester that he must leave. 
  &#8220;No, Harry, I don't believe we'll keep on retreating,&#8221; he replied.   &#8220;I was with General Taylor when he fell back before the Mexican forces   under Santa Anna which outnumbered him five to one.  But at Buena  Vista  he stopped falling back, and everybody knows the glorious  victory we won  there over overwhelming odds.  The Yankees are not  Mexicans.  Far from  it.  They are as brave as anybody.  But Stonewall  Jackson is a far  greater general than Zachary Taylor.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm hoping for the best,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;We'll all wait and see,&#8221; said the colonel. 
  They stopped falling back at Mount Jackson, twenty-five miles from   Winchester, and the army occupied a strong position.  Harry felt   instinctively that they would fall back no more, and his spirits began  to  rise again.  But the facts upon which his hopes were based were  small.  Jackson had less than five thousand men, and in the North he  was wiped  off the map.  It was no longer necessary for cabinet members  and generals  to take him into consideration. 
  Jackson now out of the way, the main portion of the army under  Banks was  directed to march eastward to Manassas, while a heavy  detachment still  more than double Jackson's in numbers remained in the  valley.  Meanwhile  McClellan, with his right flank clear, was going by  sea to Richmond,  goaded to action at last by the incessant demands of  a people which had a  right to expect much of his great and splendidly  equipped army. 
  Harry was with Stonewall Jackson when the news of these movements  reached  them, brought by Philip Sherburne, who, emulating his  commander, Turner  Ashby, seemed never to rest or grow weary. 
  &#8220;General Banks is moving eastward to cover the eastern approaches  to  Washington,&#8221; said the young captain, &#8220;while General Shields with  12,000  men is between us and Winchester.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So,&#8221; said Jackson.  Sherburne looked at him earnestly, but he gave  no  sign. 
  &#8220;Ride back to your chief and tell him I thank him for his vigilance  and  to report to me promptly everything that he may discover,&#8221; said  Jackson.  &#8220;You may ride with him also, Mr. Kenton, and return to me in  an hour with  such news as you may have.&#8221; 
  Harry went gladly.  Sometimes he longed to be at the front with  Turner  Ashby, there where the rifles were often crackling. 
  &#8220;What will he do?  Will he turn now?&#8221; said Sherburne anxiously to  Harry. 
  &#8220;I heard General Jackson say that he would never hold another  council of  war, and he's keeping his word.  Nobody knows his plans,  but I think  he'll attack.  I feel quite sure of it, captain.&#8221; 
  They came soon to a field in which Turner Ashby was sitting on a  horse,  examining points further down the valley with a pair of  powerful glasses.  Sherburne reported briefly and Ashby nodded, but did  not take the glasses  from his eyes.  Harry also looked down the valley  and his strong sight  enabled him to detect tiny, moving figures which  he knew were those of  Union scouts and skirmishers. 
  Despite his youth and the ardor of battle in his nostrils, Harry  felt the  tragedy of war in this pleasant country.  It was a noble  landscape,  that of the valley between the blue mountains.  Before him  stretched low  hills, covered here and there with fine groups of oak or  pine without  undergrowth.  Houses of red brick, with porticoes and  green shutters,  stood in wide grounds.  Most of them were inhabited  yet, and their owners  always brought information to the soldiers of  the South, never to those  of the North. 
  The earth had not yet dried fully from the great rains, and horses  and  cannon wheels sank deep in the mud, whenever they left the  turnpike  running down the center of the valley and across which a  Northern army  under Shields lay.  The men in blue occupied a wide  stretch of grassy  fields on the east, and on the west a low hill, with  a small grove  growing on the crest.  Dominating the whole were the  lofty cliffs of  North Mountain on the west.  The main force of the  North, strengthened  with cannon, lay to the east of the turnpike.  But  on the hill to the  west were two strong batteries and near it were  lines of skirmishers.  Shields, a veteran of the Mexican war himself,  was not present at this  moment, but Kimball, commanding in his  absence, was alert and did not  share the general belief that Stonewall  Jackson might be considered  non-existent. 
  Harry, things coming into better view, the longer he looked, saw  much of  the Union position, and Turner Ashby presently handed him the  glasses.  Then he plainly discerned the guns and a great mass of  infantry, with the  colors waving above them in the gentle breeze. 
  &#8220;They're there,&#8221; said Turner Ashby, dryly.  &#8220;If we want to attack  they're  waiting.&#8221; 
  Harry rode back to Jackson, and told him that the whole Union force  was  in position in front, and then the boy knew at once that a battle  was  coming.  The bearded, silent man showed no excitement, but sent  orders  thick and fast to the different parts of his army.  The cavalry  led by  Ashby began to press the enemy hard in front of a little  village called  Kernstown.  A regiment with two guns led the advance on  the west of the  turnpike, and the heavier mass of infantry marched  across the fields on  the left. 
  Harry, as his duty bade him, kept beside his general, who was  riding near  the head of the infantry.  The feet of men and horses  alike sank deep in  the soft earth of the fields, but they went forward  at a good pace,  nevertheless.  Their blood was hot and leaping.  There  was an end to  retreats.  They saw the enemy and they were eager to  rush upon him. 
  The pulses in Harry's temples were beating hard.  He already  considered  himself a veteran of battle, but he could not see it near  without feeling  excitement.  A long line of fire had extended across  the valley.  White  puffs of smoke arose like innumerable jets of  steam.  The crackle of the  rifles was incessant and at the distance  sounded like the ripping of  heavy cloth. 
  Then came a deep heavy crash that made the earth tremble.  The two   batteries on the hill had opened at a range of a mile on Jackson's   infantry.  Those men of the North were good gunners and Harry heard  the  shells and solid shot screaming and hissing around.  Despite his  will he  could not keep from trembling for a while, but presently it  ceased,  although the fire was growing heavier. 
  But the Southern infantry were so far away that the artillery fire  did  not harm.  Ever urged on by Jackson, they pressed through fields  and  marshy ground, their destination a low ridge from which, as a  place of  advantage, they could reply to the Union batteries.  From the  east and  from a point near a church called the Opequon came the  thunder of their  own guns advancing up the other side of the turnpike. 
  Now the great marching qualities of Jackson's men were shown.  Not  in  vain had they learned to be foot cavalry.  They pressed forward  through  the deep mud and always the roar of the increasing fire called  them on.  Before them stretched the ridge and Harry was in fear lest  the enemy  spring forward and seize it first. 
  But no foe appeared in front of them in the fields, and then with a  rush  they were at the foot of the ridge.  Another rush and they had  climbed  it.  Harry from its crest saw the wide field of combat and he  knew that  the greater battle had just begun.
