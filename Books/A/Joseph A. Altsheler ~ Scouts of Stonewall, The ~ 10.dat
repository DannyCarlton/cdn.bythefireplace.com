  Ashby's troopers put the armed guard of the wagons to flight in an   instant, and then they seized the rich pillage in these wagons.  They   were not yet used to the stern discipline of regular armies and Ashby   strove in vain to bring most of them back to the pursuit of the flying   enemy.  Harry also sought to help, but they laughed at him, and he had   not yet come to the point where he could cut down a disobedient  soldier.  Nor had the soldiers reached the point where they would  suffer such  treatment from an officer.  Had Harry tried such a thing  it is more than  likely that he would have been cut down in his turn. 
  But the delay and similar delays elsewhere helped the retreating  Northern  army.  Banks, feeling that the pursuit was not now so fierce,  sent back a  strong force with artillery under a capable officer,  Gordon, to help the  rear.  The scattered and flying detachments also  gathered around Gordon  and threw themselves across the turnpike. 
  Harry felt the resistance harden and he saw the pursuit of the  Southern  army slow up.  The day, too, was waning.  Shadows were  already appearing  in the east and if Jackson would destroy Banks' army  utterly he must  strike quick and hard.  Harry at that moment caught  sight of the general  on the turnpike, on Little Sorrel, the reins  lying loose on the horse's  neck, his master sitting erect, and gazing  at the darkening battlefield  which was spread out before him. 
  Harry galloped up and saluted. 
  &#8220;I could not come back at once, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because the enemy  was  crowded in between Ashby and yourself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But you've come at last.  I was afraid you had fallen.&#8221; 
  Harry's face flushed gratefully.  He knew now that Stonewall  Jackson  would have missed him. 
  &#8220;If the night were only a little further away,&#8221; continued Jackson,   &#8220;we could get them all!  But the twilight is fighting for them!  And  they  fight for themselves also!  Look, how those men retreat!  They do  well  for troops who were surprised and routed not so long ago!&#8221; 
  He spoke in a general way to his staff, but his tone expressed  decided  admiration.  Harry felt again that the core of the Northern  resistance  was growing harder and harder.  The hostile cannon blazed  down the road,  and the men as they slowly retired sent sheets of rifle  bullets at their  pursuers.  Detachments of their flying cavalry were  stopped, reformed on  the flanks, and had the temerity to charge the  victors more than once. 
  Harry did not notice now that the twilight was gone and the sun had  sunk  behind the western mountains.  The road between pursuer and  pursued was  lighted up by the constant flashes of cannon and rifles,  and at times he  fancied that he could see the vengeful and threatening  faces of those  whom he followed, but it was only fancy, fancy bred by  battle and its  excitement. 
  The pursued crossed a broad marshy creek, the Opequon, and suddenly   formed in line of battle behind it with the cavalry on their flanks.   The infantry poured in heavier volleys than before and their horsemen,   charging suddenly upon a Virginia regiment that was trying to cross,   sent it back in rapid retreat. 
  After the great volleys it was dark for a moment or two and then  Harry  saw that General Jackson and his staff were sitting alone on  their horses  on the turnpike.  The Northern rifles flashed again on  the edge of the  creek, and from a long stone fence, behind which they  had also taken  refuge for a last stand. 
  Harry and his comrades urged Jackson off the turnpike, where he was  a  fair target for the rifles whenever there was light, and into the  bushes  beside it.  They were just in time, as the night was  illuminated an  instant later by cannon flashes and then a shower of  bullets swept the  road where Jackson and his staff had been. 
  Harry thought that they would stop now, but he did not yet know  fully his  Stonewall Jackson.  He ordered up another Virginia regiment,  which,  reckless of death, charged straight in front, crossed the creek  and drove  the men in blue out of their position. 
  Yet the Northern troops, men from Massachusetts, refused to be  routed.  They fell back in good order, carrying their guns with them,  and stopping  at intervals to fire with cannon and rifles at their  pursuers.  Jackson  and his staff spurred through the Opequon.  Water  and mud flew in Harry's  face, but he did not notice them.  He was  eager to be up with the first,  because Jackson was still urging on the  pursuit, even far into the night.  Banks with his main force had  escaped him for the time, but he did not  mean that the Northern  commander should make his retreat at leisure. 
  Harry had never passed through such a night.  It contained nothing  but  continuous hours of pursuit and battle.  The famous foot cavalry  had  marched nearly twenty miles that day, they had fought a hard  combat that  afternoon, and they were still fighting.  But Jackson  allowed not a  moment's delay.  He was continually sending messengers  to regiments and  companies to hurry up, always to hurry up, faster,  and faster and yet  faster. 
  Harry carried many such messages.  In the darkness and the  confusion his  clothing was half torn off him by briars and bushes.   His horse fell  twice, stumbling into gulleys, but fortunately neither  he nor his rider  was injured.  Often he was compelled to rein up  suddenly lest he ride  over the Southern lads themselves.  All around  him he heard the panting  of men pushed to the last ounce of their  strength, and often there was  swearing, too.  Once in the darkness he  heard the voice of a boy cry out: 
  &#8220;Oh, Lord, have mercy on me and let me go to Hades!  The Devil will  have  mercy on me, but Stonewall Jackson never will!&#8221; 
  Harry did not laugh, nor did he hear anyone else laugh.  He had  expressed  the opinion that many of them held at that moment.   Stonewall Jackson was  driving them on in the darkness and the light  that he furnished them was  a flaming sword.  It was worse to shirk and  face him, than it was to go  on and face the cannon and rifles of the  enemy. 
  They called upon their reserves of strength for yet another ounce,   and it came.  The pursuit thundered on, through the woods and bushes  and  across the hills and valleys, but the men in blue, in spite of  everything,  retained their ranks on the turnpike, retreated in order,  and facing at  intervals, sent volley after volley against the foe.  It  was impossible  for the Southern army to ride them down or destroy them  with cannon and  rifle. 
  Harry came back about midnight from one of his messages, to  Jackson,  who was again riding on the turnpike.  Most of his staff were  gone on  like errands, but General Taylor who led the Acadians was now  with him.  Off in front the rifles were flashing, and again and again,  bullets  whistled near them.  Harry said nothing but fell in behind  Jackson and  close to him to await some new commission. 
  They heard the thunder of a horse's hoofs behind them, and a man  galloped  up, he as well as his horse breathing hard. 
  He was the chief quartermaster of the army, and Jackson recognized  him at  once, despite the dark. 
  &#8220;Where are the wagon trains?&#8221; exclaimed Jackson, shouting forth his  words. 
  &#8220;They're far behind.  They were held up by a bad road in the Luray   valley.  We did our best, sir,&#8221; replied the officer, his voice  trembling  with weariness and nervousness. 
  &#8220;And the ammunition wagons, where are they?&#8221; 
  The voice was stern, even accusing, but the officer met Jackson's  gaze  firmly. 
  &#8220;They are all right, sir,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;I sacrificed the other  wagons  for them, though.  They're at hand.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You have done well, sir,&#8221; said Jackson, and Harry thought he saw  him  smile.  No food for his veterans, but plenty of powder.  It was  exactly  what would appeal to Stonewall Jackson. 
  &#8220;Supply more powder and bullets to the men,&#8221; said Jackson  presently.  &#8220;Keep on pushing the enemy!  Never stop for a moment.&#8221; 
  Harry mechanically put his hand in his pocket, why he did not know,   but he felt a piece of bread and meat that he had put there in the   morning.  He fingered the foreign substance a moment, and it occurred  to  him that it was good to eat.  It occurred to him next that he had  not  eaten anything since morning, and this body of his, which for the  time  being seemed to be dissevered from mind, might be hungry. 
  He took out the food and looked at it.  It was certainly good to  the eyes,  and the body was not so completely dissevered after all, as  it began to  signal the mind that it was, in very truth, hungry.  He  was about to  raise the food to his lips and then he remembered. 
  Spurring forward a little he held out the bread and meat to  Jackson. 
  &#8220;It's cold and hard, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you'll find it good.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's thoughtful of you,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;I'll take half and see  that you  eat the rest.  Give none of it to this hungry horde around  me.  They're  able to forage for themselves.&#8221; 
  Jackson ate his half and Harry his.  That reminded most of the  officers  that they had food also, and producing it they divided it and  fell to  with an appetite.  As they ate, a shell from one of the  retreating  Northern batteries burst almost over their heads and  fragments of hot  metal struck upon the hard road.  They ate on  complacently.  When Jackson  had finished his portion he took out one  of his mysterious lemons and  began to suck the end of it. 
  Midnight was now far behind and the pursuit never halted.  One of  the  officers remarked jokingly that he had accepted an invitation to  take  breakfast on the Yankee stores in Winchester the next morning.   Jackson  made no comment.  Harry a few minutes later uttered a little  cry. 
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;We're coming upon our old battlefield of Kernstown.  I know those  hills  even in the dark.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So we are.  You have good eyes, boy.  It's been a long march, but  here  we are almost back in Winchester.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The enemy are massing in front, sir,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;It looks as  if they  meant to make another stand.&#8221; 
  The Massachusetts troops, their hearts bitter at the need to  retreat,  were forming again on a ridge behind Kernstown, and the  Pennsylvanians  and others were joining them.  Their batteries opened  heavily on their  pursuers, and the night was lighted again with the  flame of many cannon  and rifles. 
  But their efforts were vain against the resistless advance of  Jackson.  The peal of the Southern trumpets was heard above cannon and  rifles,  always calling upon the men to advance, and, summoning their  strength  anew, they hurled themselves upon the Northern position. 
  Fighting hard, but unable to turn the charge, the men in blue were  driven  on again, leaving more prisoners and more spoil in the hands of  their  pursuers.  The battle at three o'clock in the morning lasted but  a short  time. 
  The sound of the retreating column, the footsteps, the hoof-beats  and the  roll of the cannon, died away down the turnpike.  But the  sound of the  army marching in pursuit died, also.  Jackson's men could  call up no  further ounce of strength.  The last ounce had gone long  ago.  Many of  them, though still marching and at times firing, were in  a mere daze.  The roads swam past them in a dark blur and more than one  babbled of  things at home. 
  It would soon be day and there was Winchester, where the kin of so  many  of them lived, that Winchester they had left once, but to which  they were  now coming back as conquerors, conquerors whose like had not  been seen  since the young Napoleon led his republican troops to the  conquest of  Italy.  No, those French men were not as good as they.   They could not  march so long and over such roads.  They could not  march all day and all  night, too, fighting and driving armies of brave  men before them as they  fought.  Yes, the Yankees were brave men!   They were liars who said they  wouldn't fight!  If you didn't believe  it, all you had to do was to  follow Stonewall Jackson and see! 
  Such thoughts ran in many a young head in that army and Harry's,  too,  was not free from them, although it was no new thing to him to  admit that  the Yankees could and would fight just as well as the men  of his South.  The difference in the last few days lay in the fact that  the Southern  army was led by a man while the Northern army was led by  mere men. 
  The command to halt suddenly ran along the lines of Jackson's  troops, and,  before it ceased to be repeated, thousands were lying  prostrate in the  woods or on the grass.  They flung themselves down  just as they were,  reckless of horses or wagons or anything else.  Why  should they care?  They were Jackson's men.  They had come a hundred  miles, whipping armies  as they came, and they were going to whip more.   But now they meant to  rest and sleep a little while, and they would  resume the whipping after  sunrise. 
  It was but a little while until dawn and they lay still.  Harry,  who had  kept his eyes open, felt sorry for them as they lay motionless  in the  chill of the dawn, like so many dead men. 
  Jackson himself took neither sleep nor rest.  Without even a cloak  to  keep off the cold of dawn, he walked up and down, looking at the  silent  ranks stretched upon the ground, or going forward a little to  gaze in the  direction of Winchester.  Nothing escaped his eye, and he  heard  everything.  Dalton, too, had refused to lie down and he stood  with  Harry.  The two gazed at the sober figure walking slowly to and  fro. 
  &#8220;He begins to frighten me,&#8221; whispered Dalton.  &#8220;He now seems to me  at  times, Harry, not to be human, or rather more than human.  It has  been  more than a day and night now since he has taken a second of  rest,  and he appears to need none.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He is human like the rest of us, but the flame in him burns  stronger.  He gets cold and hungry and tired just as we do, but his  will carries him  on all the same.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm thankful that I fight with him and not against him,&#8221; said  Dalton  earnestly. 
  &#8220;Yes, and you're going to march again with him in five minutes.   See the  gray blur in the east, George.  It's the dawn and Jackson  never waits on  the morning.&#8221; 
  Jackson was already giving the order for the men to awake and march  forth  to battle.  It seemed to most of them that they had closed their  eyes but  a minute before.  They rose, half awake, without food, cold,  and stiff  from the frightful exertions of the day and night before,  and advanced  mechanically in line. 
  The sun again was yellow and bright in a clear blue sky, and soon  the day  would be warm.  As they heard the sound of the trumpets they  shook sleep  wholly from their eyes, and, as they moved, much of the  soreness went  from their bones.  Not far before them was Winchester. 
  Banks was in Winchester with his army.  The fierce pursuit of the  night  before had filled him with dismay, but with the morning he  recalled his  courage and resolved to make a victorious stand with the  valiant troops  that he led.  Many of his officers told him how these  men had fought  Jackson all through the night, and he found abundant  cause for courage. 
  Harry and Dalton sprang into the saddle again, and, as they rode  with  Jackson, they saw that the whole Southern army was at hand.   Ewell was  there and the cavalry and the Acadians, their band saluting  the morning  with a brave battle march.  It sent the blood dancing  through Harry's  veins.  He forgot his immense exertions, dangers and  hardships and that  he had had no sleep in twenty-four hours. 
  Before him lay the enemy.  It was no longer Jackson who retreated  before  overwhelming numbers.  He had the larger force now, at least  where the  battle was fought, and although the Northern troops in the  valley  exceeded him three or four to one, he was with his single army  destroying  their detached forces in detail. 
  General Jackson, General Taylor and several other high officers  were just  in front of the first Southern line, and Harry and Dalton  sat on their  horses a few yards in the rear.  The two generals were  examining the  Northern position minutely through their glasses, and  the chief, turning  presently to Harry, said: 
  &#8220;You have young and strong eyes.  Tell me what you can see.&#8221; 
  Harry raised the splendid pair of glasses that he had captured in  one of  the engagements and took a long, careful look. 
  &#8220;I can see west of the turnpike,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at least four or five   regiments and a battery of eight big guns.  I think, too, that there  is a  force of cavalry behind them.  On the right, sir, I see stone  fences and  the windings of the creeks with large masses of infantry  posted behind  them.&#8221; 
  He spoke modestly, but with confidence. 
  &#8220;Your eyesight agrees with mine,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;We outnumber  them,  but they have the advantage of the defense.  But it shall not  avail them.&#8221; 
  He spoke to himself rather than to the others, but Harry heard  every word  he said, and he already felt the glow of the victory that  Jackson had  promised.  He now considered it impossible for Jackson to  promise in vain. 
  The sun was rising on another brilliant morning, and the two armies  that  had been fighting all through the dark now stood face to face in  full  force in the light.  Behind the Northern army was Winchester in  all the  throes of anxiety or sanguine hope. 
  The people had heard two or three days before that Jackson was  fighting  his way back toward the north, winning wherever he fought.   They had  heard in the night the thunder of his guns coming, always  nearer, and the  torrents of fugitives in the dark had told them that  the Northern army  was pushed hard.  Now in the morning they were  looking eagerly southward,  hoping to see Jackson's gray legions  driving the enemy before him.  But it was yet scarcely full dawn, and  for a while they heard nothing. 
  Jackson waited a little and scanned the field again.  The morning  had now  come in the west as well as in the east, and he saw the strong  Northern  artillery posted on both sides of the turnpike, threatening  the Southern  advance. 
  &#8220;We must open with the cannon,&#8221; he said, and he dispatched Harry  and  Dalton to order up the guns. 
  The Southern batteries were pushed forward, and opened with a  terrific  crash on their enemy, telling the waiting people in  Winchester that the  battle had begun.  The infantry and cavalry on  either side, eager despite  their immense exertions and loss of rest  and lack of food, were held back  by their officers, while the  artillery combat went on. 
  Jackson, anxious to see the result, rode a little further forward,   and the group of staff officers, of course, went with him.  Some   keen-eyed Northern gunner picked them out, and a shell fell near.   Then came another yet nearer, and when it burst it threw dirt all over   them. 
  &#8220;A life worth so much as General Jackson's should not be risked  this way,&#8221;  whispered Dalton to Harry, &#8220;but I don't dare say anything  to him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nor do I, and if we did dare he'd pay no attention to us.  Our  gunners  don't seem to be driving their gunners away.  Do you notice  that, George?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I do and so does General Jackson.  I can see him frowning.&#8221; 
  The Northern batteries, nearly always of high quality, were doing  valiant  service that morning.  The three batteries on the left of the  turnpike  and another of eight heavy rifled guns on the right, swept  the whole of  Jackson's front with solid shot, grape and shell.  The  Southern guns,  although more numerous, were unable to crush them.  The  batteries of the  South were suffering the more.  One of them was  driven back with the loss  of half its men and horses.  At another  every officer was killed. 
  &#8220;They outshoot us,&#8221; said Dalton to Harry, &#8220;and they make a splendid  stand  for men who have been kept on the run for two days and nights.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So they do,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but sooner or later they'll have to give  way.  I heard General Jackson say that we would win a victory.&#8221; 
  Dalton glanced at him. 
  &#8220;So you feel that way, too,&#8221; he said very seriously.  &#8220;I got the  belief  some time ago.  If he says we'll win we'll win.  His prediction  settles  it in my mind.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There's a fog rising from the creek,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and it's  growing  heavier.  I think Ewell was to march that way with his  infantry and it  will hold him back.  Chance is against us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;His guns have been out of action, but there they come again!  I  can't  see them, but I can hear them through the mist.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And here goes the main force on our left.  Stonewall is about to  strike.&#8221; 
  Harry had discovered the movement the moment it was begun.  The  whole  Stonewall brigade, the Acadians and other regiments making a  formidable  force, moved to the left and charged.  Gordon, Banks' able  assistant,  threw in fresh troops to meet the Southern rush, and they  fired almost  point blank in the faces of the men in gray.  Harry,  riding forward with  the eager Jackson, saw many fall, but the Southern  charge was not checked  for a moment.  The men, firing their rifles,  leaped the stone fences and  charged home with the bayonet.  The  Northern regiments were driven back  in disorder and their cavalry  sweeping down to protect them, were met by  such a sleet of bullets  that they, too, were driven back. 
  Now all the Southern regiments came up.  Infantry, cavalry and  artillery  crossed the creek and the ridges and formed in a solid line  which nothing  could resist.  The enemy, carrying away what cannon he  could, was driven  swiftly before them.  The rebel yell, wild and  triumphant, swelled from  ten thousand throats as Jackson's army rushed  forward, pursuing the enemy  into Winchester. 
  Harry was shouting with the rest.  He couldn't help it.  The sober  Dalton  had snatched off his cap, and he, too, was shouting.  Then  Harry saw  Jackson himself giving way to exultation, for the first  time.  He was  back at Winchester which he loved so well, he had  defeated the enemy  before it, and now he was about to chase him  through its streets.  He spurred his horse at full speed down a rocky  hill, snatched off his  cap, whirled it around his head and cried at  the top of his voice again  and again: 
  &#8220;Chase them to the Potomac!  Chase them to the Potomac!&#8221; 
  Harry and Dalton, hearing the cry, took it up and shouted it, too.   Before them was a vast bank of smoke and dust, shot with fire, and the   battle thundered as it rolled swiftly into Winchester.  The Northern   officers, still strove to prevent a rout.  They performed prodigies of   valor.  Many of them fell, but the others, undaunted, still cried to  the  men to turn and beat off the foe. 
  Winchester suddenly shot up from the dust and smoke.  The battle  went on  in the town more fiercely than ever.  Torrents of shell and  bullets swept  the narrow streets, but many of the women did not  hesitate to appear at  the windows and shout amid all the turmoil and  roar of battle cheers and  praise for those whom they considered their  deliverers.  Over all rose  the roar and flame of a vast conflagration  where Banks had set his  storehouses on fire, but the women cheered all  the more when they saw it. 
  Harry did his best to keep up with his general, but Jackson still  seemed  to be aflame with excitement.  He was in the very front of the  attack and  he cried to his men incessantly to push on.  It was not  enough to take  Winchester.  They must follow the beaten army to the  Potomac. 
  Harry had a vision of flame-swept streets, of the whizzing of  bullets and  shell, of men crowded thick between the houses, and of the  faces of women  at windows, handkerchiefs and veils in their hands.   Before him was a red  mist sown with sparks, but every minute or two  the mist was rent open by  the blast of a cannon, and then the  fragments of shell whistled again  about his ears.  He kept his eyes on  Jackson, endeavoring to follow him  as closely as possible. 
  He heard suddenly a cry behind him.  He saw Dalton's horse falling,   and then Dalton and the horse disappeared.  He felt a catch at the  heart,  but it was not a time to remember long.  The Southern troops  were still  pouring forward driving hard on the Northern resistance. 
  He heard a moment or two later a voice by his side and there was  Dalton  again mounted. 
  &#8220;I thought you were gone!&#8221; Harry shouted. 
  &#8220;I was gone for a minute but it was only my horse that stayed.  He  was  shot through the heart but I caught another&#8212;plenty of riderless  ones are  galloping about&#8212;and here I am.&#8221; 
  The houses and the narrow streets offered some support to the  defense of  Banks, but he was gradually driven through the town and out  into the  fields beyond.  Then the women, careless of bullets, came out  of the  houses and weeping and cheering urged on the pursuit.  It  always seemed  to Harry that the women of this section hated the North  more than the men  did, and now it was in very fact and deed the fierce  women of the South  cheering on their men. 
  He came in the fields into contact with the Invincibles.  St. Clair  was  on foot, his horse killed, but Langdon was still riding, although  there  was a faint trickle of blood from his shoulder.  Some grim demon  seized  him as he saw Harry. 
  &#8220;We said we were coming back to Winchester,&#8221; he shouted in his  comrade's  ear, &#8220;and we have come, but we don't stay.  Harry, how long  does Old Jack  expect us to march and fight without stopping?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Until you get through.&#8221; 
  Then the Invincibles, curving a little to the right, were lost in  the  flame and smoke, and the pursuit, Jackson continually urging it,  swept  on.  He seemed to Harry to be all fire.  He shouted again and  again.  &#8220;We must follow them to the Potomac!  To the Potomac!  To the  Potomac!&#8221;  He sent his staff flying to every regimental commander with  orders.  He had the horses cut from the artillery and men mounted on  them to  continue the pursuit.  He inquired continually for the  cavalry.  Harry,  after returning from his second errand with orders,  was sent on a third  to Ashby.  There was no time to write any letter.   He was to tell him to  come up with cavalry and attack the Federal  rear with all his might. 
  Harry found Ashby far away on the right, and with but fifty men.   The  rest had been scattered.  He galloped back to his general and  reported.  He saw Jackson bite his lip in annoyance, but he said  nothing.  Harry  remained by his side and the chase went on through the  fields.  Winchester was left out of sight behind, but the crashing of  the rifles  and the shouts of the troopers did not cease. 
  The Northern army had not yet dissolved.  Although many commands  were  shattered and others destroyed, the core of it remained, and, as  it  retreated, it never ceased to strike back.  Harry saw why Jackson  was so  anxious to bring up his cavalry.  A strong charge by them and  the  fighting half of the Northern force would be split asunder.  Then  nothing  would be left but to sweep up the fragments. 
  But Jackson's men had reached the limit of human endurance.  They  were  not made of steel as their leader was, and the tremendous  exultation of  spirit that had kept them up through battle and pursuit  began to die.  Their strength, once its departure started, ebbed fast.   Their knees  crumpled under them and the weakest fell unwounded in the  fields.  The gaps between them and the Northern rear-guard widened, and  gradually  the flying army of Banks disappeared among the hills and  woods. 
  Banks, deeming himself lucky to have saved a part of his troops,  did not  stop until he reached Martinsburg, twenty-two miles north of  Winchester.  There he rested a while and resumed his flight, other  flying detachments  joining him as he went.  He reached the Potomac at  midnight with less  than half of his army, and boats carried the  wearied troops over the  broad river behind which they found refuge. 
  Most of the victors meanwhile lay asleep in the fields north of   Winchester, but others had gone back to the town and were making an   equitable division of the Northern stores among the different  regiments.  Harry and Dalton were sent with those who went to the town.   On their way  Harry saw St. Clair and Langdon lying under an apple  tree, still and  white.  He thought at first they were dead, but  stopping a moment he saw  their chests rising and falling with regular  motion, and he knew that  they were only sleeping.  The whiteness of  their faces was due to  exhaustion. 
  Feeling great relief he rode on and entered the exultant town.  He  marked  many of the places that he had known before, the manse where  the good  minister lived, the churches and the colonnaded houses, in  more than one  of which he had passed a pleasant hour. 
  Here Harry saw people that he knew.  They could not do enough for  him.  They wanted to overwhelm him with food, with clothes, with  anything he  wanted.  They wanted him to tell over and over again of  that wonderful  march of theirs, how they had issued suddenly from the  mountains in the  wake of the flying Milroy, how they had marched down  the valley winning  battle after battle, marching and fighting without  ceasing, both by day  and by night. 
  He was compelled to decline all offers of hospitality save food,  which he  held in his hands and ate as he went about his work.  When he  finished he  went back to his general, and being told that he was  wanted no more for  the night, wrapped himself in his cloak and lay  down under an apple tree. 
  He felt then that mother-earth was truly receiving him into her  kindly  lap.  He had not closed his eyes for nearly two days&#8212;it seemed  a  month&#8212;and looking back at all through which he had passed it seemed   incredible.  Human beings could not endure so much.  They marched  through  fire, where Stonewall Jackson led, and they never ceased to  march.  He saw just beyond the apple tree a dusky figure walking up and  down.  It was Jackson.  Would he never rest?  Was he not something  rather more  than normal after all?  Harry was very young and he rode  with his hero,  seeing him do his mighty deeds. 
  But nature had given all that it had to yield, and soon he slept,  lying  motionless and white like St. Clair and Langdon.  But all  through the  night the news of Jackson's great blow was traveling over  the wires.  He had struck other fierce blows, but this was the most  terrible of them  all.  Alarm spread through the whole North.  Lincoln  and his Cabinet saw  a great army of rebels marching on Washington.  A  New York newspaper  which had appeared in the morning with the  headline, &#8220;Fall of Richmond,&#8221;  appeared at night with the headline  &#8220;Defeat of General Banks.&#8221;  McDowell's army, which, marching by land,  was to co-operate with  McClellan in the taking of Richmond, was  recalled to meet Jackson.  The governors of the loyal states issued  urgent appeals for more troops. 
  Harry learned afterward how terribly effective had been the blow.   The whole Northern campaign had been upset by the meteoric appearance  of  Jackson and the speed with which he marched and fought.  McDowell's  army  of 40,000 men and a hundred guns had been scattered, and it would  take  him much time to get it all together again.  McClellan, advancing  on  Richmond, was without the support on his right which McDowell was  to  furnish and was compelled to hesitate. 
  But Jackson's foot cavalry were soon to find that they were not to  rest  on their brilliant exploits.  As eager as ever, their general was  making  them ready for another great advance further into the North.
