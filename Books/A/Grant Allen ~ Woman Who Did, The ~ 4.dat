From that day forth, Alan and Herminia met frequently. Alan was  given to sketching, and he sketched a great deal in his idle times  on the common. He translated the cottages from real estate into  poetry. On such occasions, Herminia's walks often led her in the  same direction. For Herminia was frank; she liked the young man,  and, the truth having made her free, she knew no reason why she  should avoid or pretend to avoid his company. She had no fear of  that sordid impersonal goddess who rules Philistia; it mattered not  to her what "people said," or whether or not they said anything  about her. "Aiunt: quid aiunt? aiant," was her motto. Could she  have known to a certainty that her meetings on the common with Alan  Merrick had excited unfavorable comment among the old ladies of  Holmwood, the point would have seemed to her unworthy of an  emancipated soul's consideration. She could estimate at its true  worth the value of all human criticism upon human action.    
So, day after day, she met Alan Merrick, half by accident, half by  design, on the slopes of the Holmwood. They talked much together,  for Alan liked her and understood her. His heart went out to her.  Compact of like clay, he knew the meaning of her hopes and  aspirations. Often as he sketched he would look up and wait,  expecting to catch the faint sound of her light step, or see her  lithe figure poised breezy against the sky on the neighboring  ridges. Whenever she drew near, his pulse thrilled at her coming,--  a somewhat unusual experience with Alan Merrick. For Alan, though  a pure soul in his way, and mixed of the finer paste, was not quite  like those best of men, who are, so to speak, born married. A man  with an innate genius for loving and being loved cannot long remain  single. He <i>must</i> marry young; or at least, if he does not marry, he  must find a companion, a woman to his heart, a help that is meet  for him. What is commonly called prudence in such concerns is only  another name for vice and cruelty. The purest and best of men  necessarily mate themselves before they are twenty. As a rule, it  is the selfish, the mean, the calculating, who wait, as they say,  "till they can afford to marry." That vile phrase scarcely veils  hidden depths of depravity. A man who is really a man, and who has  a genius for loving, must love from the very first, and must feel  himself surrounded by those who love him. 'Tis the first necessity  of life to him; bread, meat, raiment, a house, an income, rank far  second to that prime want in the good man's economy.    
But Alan Merrick, though an excellent fellow in his way, and of  noble fibre, was not quite one of the first, the picked souls of  humanity. He did not count among the finger-posts who point the  way that mankind will travel. Though Herminia always thought him  so. That was her true woman's gift of the highest idealizing  power. Indeed, it adds, to my mind, to the tragedy of Herminia  Barton's life that the man for whom she risked and lost everything  was never quite worthy of her; and that Herminia to the end not  once suspected it. Alan was over thirty, and was still "looking  about him." That alone, you will admit, is a sufficiently grave  condemnation. That a man should have arrived at the ripe age of  thirty and not yet have lighted upon the elect lady--the woman  without whose companionship life would be to him unendurable is in  itself a strong proof of much underlying selfishness, or, what  comes to the same thing, of a calculating disposition. The right  sort of man doesn't argue with himself at all on these matters. He  doesn't say with selfish coldness, "I can't afford a wife;" or, "If  I marry now, I shall ruin my prospects." He feels and acts. He  mates, like the birds, because he can't help himself. A woman  crosses his path who is to him indispensable, a part of himself,  the needful complement of his own personality; and without heed or  hesitation he takes her to himself, lawfully or unlawfully, because  he has need of her. That is how nature has made us; that is how  every man worthy of the name of man has always felt, and thought,  and acted. The worst of all possible and conceivable checks upon  population is the vile one which Malthus glossed over as "the  prudential," and which consists in substituting prostitution for  marriage through the spring-tide of one's manhood.    
Alan Merrick, however, was over thirty and still unmarried. More  than that, he was heart-free,--a very evil record. And, like most  other unmarried men of thirty, he was a trifle fastidious. He was  "looking about him." That means to say, he was waiting to find  some woman who suited him. No man does so at twenty. He sees and  loves. But Alan Merrick, having let slip the golden moment when  nature prompts every growing youth to fling himself with pure  devotion at the feet of the first good angel who happens to cross  his path and attract his worship, had now outlived the early flush  of pure passion, and was thinking only of "comfortably settling  himself." In one word, when a man is young, he asks himself with a  thrill what he can do to make happy this sweet soul he loves; when  he has let that critical moment flow by him unseized, he asks only,  in cold blood, what woman will most agreeably make life run smooth  for him. The first stage is pure love; the second, pure  selfishness.    
Still, Alan Merrick was now "getting on in his profession," and, as  people said, it was high time he should be settled. They said it  as they might have said it was high time he should take a business  partner. From that lowest depth of emotional disgrace Herminia  Barton was to preserve him. It was her task in life, though she  knew it not, to save Alan Merrick's soul. And nobly she saved it.    
Alan, "looking about him," with some fine qualities of nature  underlying in the background that mean social philosophy of the  class from which he sprang, fell frankly in love almost at first  sight with Herminia. He admired and respected her. More than  that, he understood her. She had power in her purity to raise his  nature for a time to something approaching her own high level.  True woman has the real Midas gift: all that she touches turns to  purest gold. Seeing Herminia much and talking with her, Alan could  not fail to be impressed with the idea that here was a soul which  could do a great deal more for him than "make him comfortable,"--  which could raise him to moral heights he had hardly yet dreamt  of,--which could wake in him the best of which he was capable. And  watching her thus, he soon fell in love with her, as few men of  thirty are able to fall in love for the first time,--as the young  man falls in love, with the unselfish energy of an unspoilt nature.  He asked no longer whether Herminia was the sort of girl who could  make him comfortable; he asked only, with that delicious tremor of  self-distrust which belongs to naive youth, whether he dare offer  himself to one so pure and good and beautiful. And his hesitation  was justified; for our sordid England has not brought forth many  such serene and single-minded souls as Herminia Barton.    
At last one afternoon they had climbed together the steep red face  of the sandy slope that rises abruptly from the Holmwood towards  Leith Hill, by the Robin Gate entrance. Near the top, they had  seated themselves on a carpet of sheep-sorrel, looking out across  the imperturbable expanse of the Weald, and the broad pastures of  Sussex. A solemn blue haze brooded soft over the land. The sun  was sinking low; oblique afternoon lights flooded the distant South  Downs. Their combes came out aslant in saucer-shaped shadows.  Alan turned and gazed at Herminia; she was hot with climbing, and  her calm face was flushed. A town-bred girl would have looked red  and blowsy; but the color and the exertion just suited Herminia.  On that healthy brown cheek it seemed natural to discern the  visible marks of effort. Alan gazed at her with a sudden rush of  untrammelled feeling. The elusive outline of her grave sweet face,  the wistful eyes, the ripe red mouth enticed him. "Oh, Herminia,"  he cried, calling her for the first time by her Christian name  alone, "how glad I am I happened to go that afternoon to Mrs.  Dewsbury's. For otherwise perhaps I might never have known you."    
Herminia's heart gave a delicious bound. She was a woman, and  therefore she was glad he should speak so. She was a woman, and  therefore she shrank from acknowledging it. But she looked him  back in the face tranquilly, none the less on that account, and  answered with sweet candor, "Thank you so much, Mr. Merrick."    
"<i>I</i> said 'Herminia,'" the young man corrected, smiling, yet aghast  at his own audacity.    
"And I thanked you for it," Herminia answered, casting down those  dark lashes, and feeling the heart throb violently under her neat  bodice.    
Alan drew a deep breath. "And it was <i>that</i> you thanked me for," he  ejaculated, tingling.    
"Yes, it was that I thanked you for," Herminia answered, with a  still deeper rose spreading down to her bare throat. "I like you  very much, and it pleases me to hear you call me Herminia. Why  should I shrink from admitting it? 'Tis the Truth, you know; and  the Truth shall make us Free. I'm not afraid of my freedom."    
Alan paused for a second, irresolute. "Herminia," he said at last,  leaning forward till his face was very close to hers, and he could  feel the warm breath that came and went so quickly; "that's very,  very kind of you. I needn't tell you I've been thinking a great  deal about you these last three weeks or so. You have filled my  mind; filled it to the brim, and I think you know it."    
Philosopher as she was, Herminia plucked a blade of grass, and drew  it quivering through her tremulous fingers. It caught and  hesitated. "I guessed as much, I think," she answered, low but  frankly.    
The young man's heart gave a bound. "And <i>you</i>, Herminia?" he asked,  in an eager ecstasy.    
Herminia was true to the Truth. "I've thought a great deal about  you too, Mr. Merrick," she answered, looking down, but with a great  gladness thrilling her.    
"I said 'Herminia,'" the young man repeated, with a marked stress  on the Christian name.    
Herminia hesitated a second. Then two crimson spots flared forth  on her speaking face, as she answered with an effort, "About you  too, Alan."    
The young man drew back and gazed at her.    
She was very, very beautiful. "Dare I ask you, Herminia?" he cried.  "Have I a right to ask you? Am I worthy of you, I mean? Ought I to  retire as not your peer, and leave you to some man who could rise  more easily to the height of your dignity?"    
"I've thought about that too," Herminia answered, still firm to her  principles. "I've thought it all over. I've said to myself, Shall  I do right in monopolizing him, when he is so great, and sweet, and  true, and generous? Not monopolizing, of course, for that would be  wrong and selfish; but making you my own more than any other  woman's. And I answered my own heart, Yes, yes, I shall do right  to accept him, if he asks me; for I love him, that is enough. The  thrill within me tells me so. Nature put that thrill in our souls  to cry out to us with a clear voice when we had met the soul she  then and there intended for us."    
Alan's face flushed like her own. "Then you love me," he cried,  all on fire. "And you deign to tell me so; Oh, Herminia, how sweet  you are. What have I done to deserve it?"    
He folded her in his arms. Her bosom throbbed on his. Their lips  met for a second. Herminia took his kiss with sweet submission,  and made no faint pretence of fighting against it. Her heart was  full. She quickened to the finger-tips.    
There was silence for a minute or two,--the silence when soul  speaks direct to soul through the vehicle of touch, the  mother-tongue of the affections. Then Alan leaned back once more,  and hanging over her in a rapture murmured in soft low tones, "So  Herminia, you will be mine! You say beforehand you will take me."    
"Not <i>will</i> be yours," Herminia corrected in that silvery voice of  hers. "<i>am</i> yours already, Alan. I somehow feel as if I had always  been yours. I am yours this moment. You may do what you would  with me."    
She said it so simply, so purely, so naturally, with all the  supreme faith of the good woman, enamoured, who can yield herself  up without blame to the man who loves her, that it hardly even  occurred to Alan's mind to wonder at her self-surrender. Yet he  drew back all the same in a sudden little crisis of doubt and  uncertainty. He scarcely realized what she meant. "Then,  dearest," he cried tentatively, "how soon may we be married?"    
At sound of those unexpected words from such lips as his, a flush  of shame and horror overspread Herminia's cheek. "Never!" she  cried firmly, drawing away. "Oh, Alan, what can you mean by it?  Don't tell me, after all I've tried to make you feel and  understand, you thought I could possibly consent to <i>marry</i> you?"    
The man gazed at her in surprise. Though he was prepared for much,  he was scarcely prepared for such devotion to principle. "Oh,  Herminia," he cried, "you can't mean it. You can't have thought of  what it entails. Surely, surely, you won't carry your ideas of  freedom to such an extreme, such a dangerous conclusion!"    
Herminia looked up at him, half hurt. "Can't have thought of what  it entails!" she repeated. Her dimples deepened. "Why, Alan,  haven't I had my whole lifetime to think of it? What else have I  thought about in any serious way, save this one great question of a  woman's duty to herself, and her sex, and her unborn children?  It's been my sole study. How could you fancy I spoke hastily, or  without due consideration on such a subject? Would you have me  like the blind girls who go unknowing to the altar, as sheep go to  the shambles? Could you suspect me of such carelessness?--such  culpable thoughtlessness?--you, to whom I have spoken of all this  so freely?"    
Alan stared at her, disconcerted, hardly knowing how to answer.  "But what alternative do you propose, then?" he asked in his  amazement.    
"Propose?" Herminia repeated, taken aback in her turn. It all  seemed to her so plain, and transparent, and natural. "Why, simply  that we should be friends, like any others, very dear, dear  friends, with the only kind of friendship that nature makes  possible between men and women."    
She said it so softly, with some womanly gentleness, yet with such  lofty candor, that Alan couldn't help admiring her more than ever  before for her translucent simplicity, and directness of purpose.  Yet her suggestion frightened him. It was so much more novel to  him than to her. Herminia had reasoned it all out with herself, as  she truly said, for years, and knew exactly how she felt and  thought about it. To Alan, on the contrary, it came with the shock  of a sudden surprise, and he could hardly tell on the spur of the  moment how to deal with it. He paused and reflected. "But do you  mean to say, Herminia," he asked, still holding that soft brown  hand unresisted in his, "you've made up your mind never to marry  any one? made up your mind to brave the whole mad world, that can't  possibly understand the motives of your conduct, and live with some  friend, as you put it, unmarried?"    
"Yes, I've made up my mind," Herminia answered, with a faint tremor  in her maidenly voice, but with hardly a trace now of a traitorous  blush, where no blush was needed. "I've made up my mind, Alan; and  from all we had said and talked over together, I thought you at  least would sympathize in my resolve."    
She spoke with a gentle tinge of regret, nay almost of disillusion.  The bare suggestion of that regret stung Alan to the quick. He  felt it was shame to him that he could not rise at once to the  height of her splendid self-renunciation. "You mistake me,  dearest," he answered, petting her hand in his own (and she allowed  him to pet it). "It wasn't for myself, or for the world I  hesitated. My thought was for you. You are very young yet. You  say you have counted the cost. I wonder if you have. I wonder if  you realize it."    
"Only too well," Herminia replied, in a very earnest mood. "I have  wrought it all out in my mind beforehand,--covenanted with my soul  that for women's sake I would be a free woman. Alan, whoever would  be free must himself strike the blow. I know what you will say,--  what every man would say to the woman he loved under similar  circumstances,--'Why should <i>you</i> be the victim? Why should <i>you</i> be  the martyr? Bask in the sun yourself; leave this doom to some  other.' But, Alan, I can't. I feel <i>I</i> must face it. Unless one  woman begins, there will be no beginning." She lifted his hand in  her own, and fondled it in her turn with caressing tenderness.  "Think how easy it would be for me, dear friend," she cried, with  a catch in her voice, "to do as other women do; to accept the  <i>honorable marriage</i> you offer me, as other women would call it; to  be false to my sex, a traitor to my convictions; to sell my kind  for a mess of pottage, a name and a home, or even for thirty pieces  of silver, to be some rich man's wife, as other women have sold it.  But, Alan, I can't. My conscience won't let me. I know what  marriage is, from what vile slavery it has sprung; on what unseen  horrors for my sister women it is reared and buttressed; by what  unholy sacrifices it is sustained, and made possible. I know it  has a history, I know its past, I know its present, and I can't  embrace it; I can't be untrue to my most sacred beliefs. I can't  pander to the malignant thing, just because a man who loves me  would be pleased by my giving way and would kiss me, and fondle me  for it. And I love you to fondle me. But I must keep my proper  place, the freedom which I have gained for myself by such arduous  efforts. I have said to you already, 'So far as my will goes, I am  yours; take me, and do as you choose with me.' That much I can  yield, as every good woman should yield it, to the man she loves,  to the man who loves her. But more than that, no. It would be  treason to my sex; not my life, not my future, not my individuality,  not my freedom."    
"I wouldn't ask you for those," Alan answered, carried away by the  torrent flood of her passionate speech. "I would wish you to guard  them. But, Herminia, just as a matter of form,--to prevent the  world from saying the cruel things the world is sure to say,--and  as an act of justice to you, and your children! A mere ceremony of  marriage; what more does it mean now-a-days than that we two agree  to live together on the ordinary terms of civilized society?"    
Still Herminia shook her head. "No, no," she cried vehemently. "I  deny and decline those terms; they are part and parcel of a system  of slavery. I have learnt that the righteous soul should avoid all  appearance of evil. I will not palter and parley with the unholy  thing. Even though you go to a registry-office and get rid as far  as you can of every relic of the sacerdotal and sacramental idea,  yet the marriage itself is still an assertion of man's supremacy  over woman. It ties her to him for life, it ignores her  individuality, it compels her to promise what no human heart can be  sure of performing; for you can contract to do or not to do, easily  enough, but contract to feel or not to feel,--what transparent  absurdity! It is full of all evils, and I decline to consider it.  If I love a man at all, I must love him on terms of perfect  freedom. I can't bind myself down to live with him to my shame one  day longer than I love him; or to love him at all if I find him  unworthy of my purest love, or unable to retain it; or if I  discover some other more fit to be loved by me. You admitted the  other day that all this was abstractly true; why should you wish  this morning to draw back from following it out to its end in  practice?"    
Alan was only an Englishman, and shared, of course, the inability  of his countrymen to carry any principle to its logical conclusion.  He was all for admitting that though things must really be so, yet  it were prudent in life to pretend they were otherwise. This is  the well-known English virtue of moderation and compromise; it has  made England what she is, the shabbiest, sordidest, worst-organized  of nations. So he paused for a second and temporized. "It's for  your sake, Herminia," he said again; "I can't bear to think of your  making yourself a martyr. And I don't see how, if you act as you  propose, you could escape martyrdom."    
Herminia looked up at him with pleading eyes. Tears just trembled  on the edge of those glistening lashes. "It never occurred to me  to think," she said gently but bravely, "my life could ever end in  anything else but martyrdom. It <i>must</i> needs be so with all true  lives, and all good ones. For whoever sees the truth, whoever  strives earnestly with all his soul to be good, must be raised many  planes above the common mass of men around him; he must be a moral  pioneer, and the moral pioneer is always a martyr. People won't  allow others to be wiser and better than themselves, unpunished.  They can forgive anything except moral superiority. We have each  to choose between acquiescence in the wrong, with a life of ease,  and struggle for the right, crowned at last by inevitable failure.  To succeed is to fail, and failure is the only success worth aiming  at. Every great and good life can but end in a Calvary."    
"And I want to save you from that," Alan cried, leaning over her  with real tenderness, for she was already very dear to him. "I  want to save you from yourself; I want to make you think twice  before you rush headlong into such a danger."    
"<i>Not</i> to save me from myself, but to save me from my own higher and  better nature," Herminia answered with passionate seriousness.  "Alan, I don't want any man to save me from that; I want you rather  to help me, to strengthen me, to sympathize with me. I want you to  love me, not for my face and form alone, not for what I share with  every other woman, but for all that is holiest and deepest within  me. If you can't love me for that, I don't ask you to love me; I  want to be loved for what I am in myself, for the yearnings I  possess that are most of all peculiar to me. I know you are  attracted to me by those yearnings above everything; why wish me  untrue to them? It was because I saw you could sympathize with me  in these impulses that I said to myself, Here, at last, is the man  who can go through life as an aid and a spur to me. Don't tell me  I was mistaken; don't belie my belief. Be what I thought you were,  what I know you are. Work with me, and help me. Lift me! raise  me! exalt me! Take me on the sole terms on which I can give myself  up to you."    
She stretched her arms out, pleading; she turned those subtle eyes  to him, appealingly. She was a beautiful woman. Alan Merrick was  human. The man in him gave way; he seized her in his clasp, and  pressed her close to his bosom. It heaved tumultuously. "I could  do anything for you, Herminia," he cried, "and indeed, I do  sympathize with you. But give me, at least, till to-morrow to  think this thing over. It is a momentous question; don't let us be  precipitate."    
Herminia drew a long breath. His embrace thrilled through her.  "As you will," she answered with a woman's meekness. "But  remember, Alan, what I say I mean; on these terms it shall be, and  upon none others. Brave women before me have tried for awhile to  act on their own responsibility, for the good of their sex; but  never of their own free will from the very beginning. They have  avoided marriage, not because they thought it a shame and a  surrender, a treason to their sex, a base yielding to the unjust  pretensions of men, but because there existed at the time some  obstacle in their way in the shape of the vested interest of some  other woman. When Mary Godwin chose to mate herself with Shelley,  she took her good name in her hands; but still there was Harriet.  As soon as Harriet was dead, Mary showed she had no deep principle  of action involved, by marrying Shelley. When George Eliot chose  to pass her life with Lewes on terms of equal freedom, she defied  the man-made law; but still, there was his wife to prevent the  possibility of a legalized union. As soon as Lewes was dead,  George Eliot showed she had no principle involved, by marrying  another man. Now, <i>I</i> have the rare chance of acting otherwise; I  can show the world from the very first that I act from principle,  and from principle only. I can say to it in effect, 'See, here is  the man of my choice, the man I love, truly, and purely, the man  any one of you would willingly have seen offering himself in lawful  marriage to your own daughters. If I would, I might go the beaten  way you prescribe, and marry him legally. But of my own free will  I disdain that degradation; I choose rather to be free. No fear of  your scorn, no dread of your bigotry, no shrinking at your cruelty,  shall prevent me from following the thorny path I know to be the  right one. I seek no temporal end. I will not prove false to the  future of my kind in order to protect myself from your hateful  indignities. I know on what vile foundations your temple of  wedlock is based and built, what pitiable victims languish and die  in its sickening vaults; and I will not consent to enter it. Here,  of my own free will, I take my stand for the right, and refuse your  sanctions! No woman that I know of has ever yet done that. Other  women have fallen, as men choose to put it in their odious dialect;  no other has voluntarily risen as I propose to do.'" She paused a  moment for breath. "Now you know how I feel," she continued,  looking straight into his eyes. "Say no more at present; it is  wisest so. But go home and think it out, and talk it over with me  tomorrow."
