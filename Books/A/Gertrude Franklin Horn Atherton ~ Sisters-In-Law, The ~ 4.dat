That was a unique and vivid day for young Alexina Groome, whose disposition  was to look upon life as drama and asked only that it shift its scenes  often and be consistently entertaining and picturesque.    
Never, so James told her, since her Grandmother Ballinger's reign, had  there been such life and movement in the old house. All Mrs. Groome's  intimate friends and many of Alexina's came to it, some to make kindly  inquiries, others to beg them to leave the city, many to gossip and  exchange experiences of that fateful morning; a few from Rincon Hill and  the old ladies' fashionable boarding-house district to claim shelter until  they could make their way to relatives out of town.    
Mrs. Groome welcomed her friends not only with the more spontaneous  hospitality of an older time but in that spirit of brotherhood that  every disaster seems to release, however temporarily. Brotherhood is  unquestionably an instinct of the soul, an inheritance from that sunrise  era when mutual interdependence was as imperative as it was automatic. The  complexities of civilization have overlaid it, and almost but not wholly  replaced it by national and individual selfishness. But the world as yet is  only about one-third civilized. Centuries hence a unified civilization may  complete the circle, but human nature and progress must act and react a  thousand times before the earthly millenium; and it cannot be hastened by  dreamers and fanatics.    
All Mrs. Groome's spare rooms were placed at the service of her friends,  and cots were bought in the humble Fillmore Street shops and put up in the  billiard room, the double parlors, the library and the upper hall. Some  forty people would sleep under the old Ballinger roof that night--dynamite  permitting. Mrs. Groome was firm in her determination not to flee, and as  James and Mike were there to watch, she had graciously given a number  of the gloomy refugees from the lower regions permission to camp in the  outhouses and grounds.

Alexina spent the greater part of the day with Aileen Lawton, Olive Bascom,  and Sibyl Thorndyke, out of doors, fascinated by the spectacle of the  burning city.    
The valley beyond Market Street, and the lower business district, were a  rolling mass of smoke parting about pillars of fire, shot with a million  glittering sparks when a great building was dynamited. All the windows in  those sections of the city as yet beyond the path of the fire were open,  for although closed windows might have shut out the torrid atmosphere, the  explosions would have shattered them.    
"Oh, dear," sighed Olive Bascom, "there goes my building. The smoke lifted  for a moment and I saw the flames spouting out of the windows. A cool  million and uninsured. We thought Class A buildings were safe from any sort  of fire."    
"Heavens!" exclaimed Alexina naively, "I wish I had a million-dollar  building down in that furnace. It must be a great sensation to watch a  million dollars go up in sparks."    
"I hope your mother hasn't any buildings down in the business district,"  said Aileen anxiously. "I've heard dad talk about her ground rents. She'll  get those again soon enough. I fancy the old tradition survives in this  town and they'll begin to draw the plans for the new city before the fire  is out. It used to burn down regularly in the fifties, dad says."    
"I don't fancy we have much of anything," said Alexina cheerfully. "I think  mother has only a life interest in a part of father's estate, and I heard  her tell Maria once that she intended to leave me all she had of her own,  this place and a few thousand a year in bonds and some flats that are  probably burning up right now. I gathered from the conversation that father  didn't have much left when he died and that it was understood mother was  to look out for me. I believe he gave a lot to the others when he was  wealthy."    
"Good Lord!" Aileen sighed heavily. "It won't pay your dressmakers' bills,  what with taxes and all. I won't be much better off. We'll have to marry  Rex Roberts or Bob Cheever or Frank Bascom--unless he's going up in smoke  too, Olive dear. But there are a few others."    
Alexina shook her head. Her color could not rise higher for her face was  crimson from the heat; like the others she had a wet handkerchief on her  head. "There is not a grain of romance in one of them," she announced.  "Curious that the sons of the rich nearly always have round faces,  no particular features, and a tendency to bulge. I intend to have a  romance--old style--good old style--before the vogue of the middle-class  realists. There's nothing in life but youth and you only have it once.  I'm going to have a romance that means falling wildly, unreasonably,  uncalculatingly in love."    
"You anticipate my adjectives," said Aileen drily. "Although not all. But  let that pass. I'd like to know where you expect to find the opposite  lead, as they say on the stage. Our men are not such a bad sort, even the  richest--with a few exceptions, of course. They may hit it up at week-ends,  generally at the country clubs, but they're better than the last generation  because their fathers have more sense. I'll bet they're all down there now  fighting the fire with the vim of their grandfathers....But romantic! Good  Lord! I'll marry one of them all right and glad of the chance--after I've  had my fling. I'm in no hurry. I'd have outgrown my illusions in any case  by that time, only Nature did the trick by not giving me any."    
"Don't you believe there isn't a man in all San Francisco able to inspire  romance." If Alexina could not blush her dark gray eyes could sparkle and  melt. "All the men we meet don't belong to that rich group."    
"Bunch, darling. Where--will you give us the pointer?--are to be found the  romantic knights of San Francisco? 'Frisco as those tiresome Eastern people  call it. Makes me sick to think that they are even now pitying 'poor  'Frisco.' "Well?--I could beat my brains and not call one to mind."    
"Oh!"    
"What does that mean, Alex Groome? When you roll up your eyes like that you  look like a love-sick tomato."    
"Mortimer Dwight was most devoted last night," said Sibyl Thorndyke. "She  danced with him at least eight times."    
"You must have sat out alone to know what I was doing," Alexina began  hotly, but Aileen sprang at her and gripped her shoulders.    
"Don't tell me that you are interested in that cheap skate. Alexina Groome!  You!"    
"He's not a cheap skate. I despise your cheap slang."    
"He's a rank nobody."    
"You mean he isn't rich. Or his family didn't belong. What do you suppose I  care? I'm not a snob."    
"He is. A climbing, ingenuous, empty-headed snob."    
"You are a snob. You ought to be ashamed of yourself."    
"I've a right to be a snob if I choose, and he hasn't. My snobbery is the  right sort: the 'I will maintain' kind. He'd give all the hair on his head  to have the right to that sort of snobbery. His is" (she chanted in a  high light maddening voice): "Oh, God, let me climb. Yank me up into the  paradise of San Francisco society. Burlingame, Alta, Menlo Park, Atherton,  Belvidere, San Rafael. Oh, God, it's awful to be a nobody, not to be in  the same class with these rich fellers, not to belong to the Pacific-Union  Club, not to have polo ponies, not to belong to smart golf clubs, to the  Burlingame Club. Not to get clothes from New York and London--"    
"You keep quiet," shrieked Alexina, who with difficulty refrained from  substituting: "You shut up." She flung off Aileen's hands. "What do you  know about him? He doesn't like you."    
"Never had a chance to find out."    
"What can you know about him, then?"    
"Think I'm blind? Think I'm deaf? Don't I know everything that goes on in  this town? Isn't sizing-up my long suit? And he's as dull as--as a fish  without salt. I sat next to him at a dinner, and all he could talk about  was the people he'd met--our sort, of course. And he was dull even at that.  He's all manners and bluff--"    
"You couldn't draw him out. He talked to me."    
"What about? I'm really interested to know. Everybody says the same thing.  They fall for his dancing and manners, and--well, yes--I 'll admit it--for  his looks. He even looks like a gentleman. But all the girls say he bores  'em stiff. They have to talk their heads off. What did he say to you that  was so frantically interesting?"    
"Well, of course--we danced most of the time."    
"That's just it. He's inherited the shell of some able old ancestor and not  a bit of the skull furniture. Nature often plays tricks like that. But I  could forgive him for being dull if he weren't such a damn snob."    
"You shan't call him names. If he wants to be one of us, and life was  so unkind as to--to--well, birth him on the outside, I'm sure that's no  crime."    
"Snobbery," said Miss Thorndyke, who was intellectual at the moment and  cultivating the phrase, "is merely a rather ingenuous form of aspiration. I  can't see that it varies except in kind from other forms of ambition. And  without ambition there would be no progress."    
"Oh, can it," sneered Judge Lawton's daughter. "You're all wrong, anyhow.  Snobbery leads to the rocks much oftener than to high achievement. I've  heard dad say so, and you won't venture to assert that <i>he</i> doesn't  know. It bears about the same relation to progress that grafting does to  legitimate profits. Anyhow, it makes me sick, and I'm not going to have  Alex falling in love with a poor fish--"    
"Fish?" Alexina's voice rose above a fresh detonation, "You dare--and you  think I'm going to ask you whom I shall fall in love with? Fish? What do  you call those other shrimps who don't think of anything but drinking and  sport, whether they attend to business or not?--their fathers make them,  anyhow. And you want to marry one of them! They're fish, if you like."    
The two girls were glaring at each other. Gray eyes were blazing, green  eyes snapping. Two sets of white even teeth were bared. They looked like a  couple of belligerent puppies. Another moment and they would have forgotten  the sacred traditions of their class and flown at each other's hair. But  Miss Bascom interposed. Even the loss of her uninsured million did not  ruffle her, for she had another in Government and railroad bonds, and full  confidence in her brother, who was an admirable business man, and not in  the least dissipated.    
"Come, come," she said. "It's much too hot to fight. Dwight is not good  enough for Alex--from a worldly point of view, I mean," as Alexina made a  movement in her direction. "We should none of us marry out of our class. It  never works, somehow. But Mr. Dwight is really quite all right otherwise. I  like him very much, Alex darling, and I don't mind his being an outsider  in the least--so long as he doesn't try to marry one of us. He's <i>too</i>  good-looking, and his heels are fairly inspired. No one questions the fact  that he is an honorable and worthy young man, working like a real man to  earn his living. It isn't at all as if he were an adventurer. He has never  struck me as being more of a snob than most people, and I don't see why I  haven't thought to ask him down to San Mateo for a week-end."    
"You'll certainly have a friend for life if you do," said Aileen  satirically. "Fall in love with him yourself if you choose. You can afford  it."    
"No fear. I've made up my mind. I'm going to marry a French marquis."    
"What?" Even Alexina forgot Mortimer Dwight. "Who is he? Where did you meet  him?"    
"I haven't met him yet. But I shall. I'm going to Paris next winter to  visit my aunt, and I'll find one. You get anything in this world you go  for hard enough. To be a French marquise is the most romantic thing in the  world."    
"Why not Elton Gwynne? It's an open secret that he's an English marquis. Or  that young Gathbroke Lady Victoria brought last night?"    
"He's a younger son, and he never looked at any one but Alex. And Isabel  Otis has preempted Mr. Gwynne. And I adore France and don't care about  England."    
"Well, that is romantic if you like!" cried Aileen, her green eyes dancing"  "You have my best wishes. Doesn't it make your Geary Street knight look  cheap--he boards somewhere down on Geary Street."    
"No, it doesn't! And I'm a good American. French marquis, indeed! Mr.  Dwight comes of the best old American stock from New York. He told mother  so, I'd spit on any old decadent European title."    
"I wish your mother could hear you. So--he's been getting round her has  he? Where on earth did he meet her?"    
Alexina, with sulky triumph, reported Mr. Dwight's early visit and the  favorable impression he had made.    
Aileen groaned. "That's just the one thing she would fall for in a rank  outsider--superlative manners. His being poor is rather in his favor. I'll  put a flea in her ear--"    
"You dare!"    
Aileen lifted her shoulders. "Well, as a matter of fact I can't. Tattling  just isn't in my line. But if I can queer him with you I will."    
"I won't talk about him any more." Alexina drew herself up with immense  dignity. She had the advantage of Aileen not only in inches but in a  natural repose of manner. The eminent Judge Lawton's only child, upon whom,  possibly, he may have lavished too much education, had a thin nervous  little body that was seldom in repose, and her face, with its keen  irregular features and brilliant green eyes, shifted its surface  impressions as rapidly as a cinematograph. Olive Bascom had soft blue eyes  and abundant brown hair, and Sibyl Thorndyke had learned to hold her long  black eyes half closed, and had the black hair and rich complexion of a  Creole great-grandmother. Alexina was admittedly the "beauty of the bunch."  Nevertheless, Miss Lawton had informed her doting parent before this, her  first season, was half over, that she was <i>vivid</i> enough to hold her own  with the best of them. The boys said she was a live wire and she preferred  that high specialization to the tameness of mere beauty.    
<b>IV</b>    
Said Alexina: "Sibyl, what are you going to do with your young life? Shall  you marry an English duke or a New York millionaire?"    
But Miss Thorndyke smiled mysteriously. She was not as frank as the other  girls, although by no means as opaque as she imagined.    
Aileen laughed. "Oh, don't ask her. Doubt if she knows. To-day she's all  for being intellectual and reading those damn dull Russian novelists.  To-morrow she may be setting up as an odalisque. It would suit her style  better."    
Miss Thorndyke's face was also crimson from the heat, but she would not  have flushed had it been the day before. She was not subject to sudden  reflexes.    
"Your satire is always a bit clumsy, dear," she said sweetly. "The  odalisque is not your role at all events."    
"I don't go in for roles."    
And the four girls wrangled and dreamed and planned, while a city burnt  beneath them; some three hundred million dollars flamed out, lives were  ruined, exterminated, altered; and Labor sat on the hills and smiled  cynically at the tremendous impetus the earth had handed them on that  morning of April eighteenth, nineteen hundred and six.    
They were too young to know or to care. When the imagination is trying its  wings it is undismayed even by a world at war.
