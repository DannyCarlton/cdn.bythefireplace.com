Betty Madison arrived in Washington two days before Christmas, with  the sensation of having lived through several life-times since Lady  Mary's car had left the Pennsylvania station on the fourteenth of  March; she half expected to see several new public buildings, and she  found herself wondering if her old friends were much changed.    
People capable of the deepest and most enduring impressions often  receive these impressions upon apparently shallow waters. They feel  the blow, but it skims the surface at the moment, to choose its place  and sink slowly, surely, into the thinking brain.    
Betty's immediate attitude toward the tragic fact of Harriet's death  was almost spectacular. She felt herself the central figure in a  thrilling and awful drama, its horror stifling for a moment the hope  that the man whose footsteps followed closely upon that tramping of  heavy feet would fulfil his promise and take her in his arms. And when  he did her sense of personal responsibility left her, as well as her  clearer comprehension of what had happened to bring about this climax  so long and so ardently desired.    
But she had not seen Senator North since the day following the  funeral. Mrs. Madison had announced with emphasis that she had had as  much as she could stand and would not remain another day in the  Adirondacks; she wanted Narragansett and the light and agreeable  society of many Southern friends who did not have frequent tragedies  in their families. Betty telegraphed for rooms at one of the  large hotels at the Pier, and thereafter had the satisfaction of  seeing her mother gossip contentedly for hours with other ladies of  lineage and ante-bellum reminiscences, or sit with even deeper  contentment for intermediate hours upon the veranda of the Casino.  When she herself was bored beyond endurance, she crossed the bay and  lunched or dined in Newport, where she had many friends; and she spent  much time on horseback. When the season was over, they paid a round of  visits to country houses, and finished with the few weeks in New York  necessary for the replenishment of Miss Madison's wardrobe. She had  hoped to reach Washington for the opening of Congress, but her mother  had been ill, prolonging the last visit a fortnight, and gowns must be  consulted upon, fitted and altered did the world itself stand still.  And this was the one period of mental rest that Betty had experienced  since her parting from Senator North.    
She had been much with people during these five months, seeking and  finding little solitude, and few had found any change in her beyond a  deeper shade of indifference and more infrequent flashes of humour.  She permitted men to amuse her if she did not amuse them, to all out-  door sports she was faithful, and she read the new books and talked  intelligently of the fashions. When the conversation swung with the  precision of a pendulum from clothes and love to war with Spain, her  mind leapt at once to action, and she argued every advocate of war  into a state of fury. She had responded heavily to the President's  appeal in behalf of the reconcentrados, but her mind was no longer  divided. The failure of the belligerency resolutions to reach the  attention of the House during the Extra Session of Congress had  rekindled the war fever in the country; and the constant chatter about  the suffering Cuban and the duty of the United States, the black  iniquity of the Speaker and the timidity of the President, were  wearying to the more evenly balanced members of the community. "You  say that we need a war," said Betty contemptuously one day, "that it  will shake us up and do us good. If we had fallen as low as that, no  war could lift us, certainly not the act of bullying a small country,  of rushing into a war with the absolute certainty of success. But we  need no war. American manhood is where it always has been and always  will be until we reach that pitch of universal luxury and sloth and  vice which extinguished Rome. Those commercial and financial pursuits  should make a man less a man is the very acme of absurdity. If our men  were drawn into a righteous war to-morrow or a hundred years hence,  they would fight to the glory of their country and their own honour.  But if they swagger out to whip a decrepit and wheezy old man, when  the excitement is over they will wish that the whole episode could be  buried in oblivion. And I would be willing to wager anything you like  that if this war does come off, so false is its sentiment that it will  not inspire one great patriotic poem, nor even one of merit, and that  the only thing you will accomplish will be to drag Cuba from the  relaxing clutches of one tyrant and fling her to a horde of  politicians and greedy capitalists."    
But, except when politics possessed it, her brain seldom ceased, no  matter how crowded her environment, from pondering on the events of  the summer, and pondering, it sobered and grew older. She had engaged  in a conflict with the Unseen Forces of life and been conquered. She  had been obliged to stand by and see these forces work their will upon  a helpless being, who carried in solution the vices of civilizations  and men persisting to their logical climax, almost demanding aloud the  sacrifice of the victim to death that this portion of themselves might  be buried with her. Despite her intelligence, nothing else could have  given her so clear a realization of the eternal persistence of all  acts, of the sequential symmetrical links they forge in the great  chain of Circumstance. It was this that made her hope more eager that  the United States would be guided by its statesmen and not by  hysteria, and it was this that made her think deeply and constantly  upon her future relation with Senator North.    
The danger was as great as ever. Her brain had sobered, but her heart  had not. Separation and the absence of all communication--they had  agreed not to correspond--had strengthened and intensified a love that  had been half quiescent so long as its superficial wants were  gratified. Troubled times were coming when he would need her, would  seek her whenever he could, and yet when their meetings must be short  and unsatisfactory. When hours are no longer possible, minutes become  precious, and the more precious the more dangerous. If she were older,  if tragedy and thought had sobered and matured her character, if she  were deprived of the protection of the lighter moods of her mind,  would not the danger be greater still? The childish remnant upon which  she had instinctively relied had gone out of her, she had a deeper and  grimmer knowledge of what life would be without the man who had  conquered her through her highest ideals and most imperious needs; and  of what it would be with him.    
She had no intention of making a problem out of the matter, constantly  as her mind dwelt upon the future. Senator North had told her once  that problems fled when the time for action began. She supposed that  one of two things would happen after her return to Washington: great  events would absorb his mind and leave him with neither the desire nor  the time for more than an occasional friendly hour with her; or after  a conscientious attempt to take up their relationship on the old lines  and give each other the companionship both needed, all intercourse  would abruptly cease.
