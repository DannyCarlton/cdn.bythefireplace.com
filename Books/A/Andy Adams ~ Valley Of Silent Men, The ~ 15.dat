  For a space he stood where she had left him, staring at the door   through which she had gone. The nearness of her in those last few   seconds of her presence, the caressing touch of her hands, what he   had seen in her eyes, her promise to kiss him if he did not reveal   himself&#8212;these things, and the thought of the splendid courage  that  must be inspiring her to face Kedsty now, made him blind even  to the  door and the wall at which he was apparently looking. He  saw only her  face, as he had seen it in that last moment&#8212;her  eyes, the tremble of  her lips, and the fear which she had not  quite hidden from him. She  was afraid of Kedsty. He was sure of  it. For she had not smiled; there  was no flicker of humor in her  eyes, when she called him Jeems, an  intimate use of the names Jim  and James in the far North. It was not  facetiously that she had  promised to kiss him. An almost tragic  seriousness had possessed  her. And it was that seriousness that  thrilled him&#8212;that, and the  amazing frankness with which she had  coupled the name Jeems with  the promise of her lips. Once before she  had called him Jeems. But  it was M'sieu Jeems then, and there had been  a bit of taunting  laughter in her voice. Jim or James meant nothing,  but Jeems&#8212;He  had heard mothers call little children that, in moments  of  endearment. He knew that wives and sweethearts used it in that   same way. For Jim and James were not uncommon names up and down  the  Three Rivers, even among the half-breeds and French, and Jeems  was the  closer and more intimate thing bred of it. 
  His heart was thumping riotously as he went to the door and   listened. A little while ago, when she faced him with flashing  eyes,  commanding him not to question her, he had felt an abyss  under his  feet. Now he was on a mountain. And he knew that no  matter what he  heard, unless it was her cry for help, he would not  go down. 
  After a little he opened the door a mere crack so that sound might   come to him. She had not forbidden that. Through the crack he  could  see a dim glow of light in the lower hall. But he heard no  sound, and  it occurred to him that old Mooie could still run  swiftly, and that it  might be some time before Kedsty would  arrive. 
  As he waited, he looked about the room. His first impression was   that Marette must have lived in it for a long time. It was a  woman's  room, without the newness of sudden and unpremeditated  occupancy. He  knew that formerly it had been Kedsty's room, but  nothing of Kedsty  remained in it now. And then, as his wondering  eyes beheld the  miracle, a number of things struck him with  amazing significance. He  no longer doubted that Marette Radisson  was of the far Northland. His  faith in that was absolute. If there  had been a last question in his  mind, it was wiped away because  she called him Jeems. Yet this room  seemed to give the lie to his  faith. Fascinated by his discovery of  things, he drew away from  the door and stood over the dressing-table  in front of the mirror. 
  Marette had not prepared the room for him, and her possessions   were there. It did not strike him as sacrilege to look at them,  the  many intimate little things that are mysteriously used in the  process  of a lady's toilette. It was their number and variety that  astounded  him. He might have expected them in the boudoir of the  Governor  General's daughter at Ottawa, but not here&#8212;and much less  farther  north. What he saw was of exquisite material and  workmanship. And  then, as if attracted by a magnet, his eyes were  drawn to something  else. It was a row of shoes neatly and  carefully arranged on the floor  at one side of the dressing-table. 
  He stared at them, astounded. Never had he seen such an array of   feminine footwear intended for the same pair of feet. And it was  not  Northern footwear. Every individual little beauty in that  amazing row  stood on a high heel! Their variety was something to  which he had long  been a stranger. There were buttoned boots,  laced boots, brown boots,  black boots, and white boots, with  dangerously high and fragile  looking heels; there were dainty  little white kid slippers, slippers  with bows, slippers with cut  steel buckles, and slippers with dainty  ribbon ties; there were  high-heeled oxfords and high-heeled patent  leather pumps! He  gasped. He reached over, moved by an automatic sort  of impulse,  and took a satiny little pump in his hand. 
  The size of it gave him a decidedly pleasant mental shock, and,   beginning to feel like one prying into a sleeper's secrets, he  looked  inside it. The size was there&#8212;number three. And it had  come from  Favre's in Montreal! One after another he looked inside  half a dozen  others. And all of them had come from Favre's in  Montreal. The little  shoes, more than all else that he had seen or  that had happened, sent  a question pounding through his brain. Who  was Marette Radisson? 
  And that question was followed by other questions, until they   tumbled over one another in his head. If she was from Montreal,  why  was she going north? If she belonged in the North, if she was  a part  of it, why was she taking all of this apparently worthless  footwear  with her? Why had she come to Athabasca Landing? What was  she to  Kedsty? Why was she hiding under his roof? Why&#8212; 
  He stopped himself, trying to find some one answer in all that   chaos of questions. It was impossible for him to take his eyes  from  the shoes. A thought seized him. Ludicrously he dropped upon  his knees  in front of the row and with a face growing hotter each  moment  examined them all. But he wanted to know. And the discovery  he made  was that most of the footwear had been worn, some of it so  slightly,  however, that the impression of the foot was barely  visible. 
  He rose to his feet and continued his inquiry. Of course she had   expected him to look about. One couldn't help seeing, unless one  were  blind. He would have cut off a hand before opening one of the   dressing-table drawers. But Marette herself had told him to hide   behind the curtains if it became necessary, and it was an  excusable  caution for him to look behind those curtains now, to  see what sort of  hiding-place he had. He returned to the door  first and listened. There  was still no sound from below. Then he  drew the curtains apart, as  Marette had drawn them. Only he looked  longer. He would tell her about  it when she returned, if the act  needed an apology. 
  His impression was a man's impression. What he saw was a   billowing, filmy mass of soft stuff, and out of it there greeted  him  the faintest possible scent of lilac sachet powder. He closed  the  curtains with a deep breath of utter joy and of consternation.  The two  emotions were a jumble to him. The shoes, all that mass of  soft stuff  behind the curtains, were exquisitely feminine. The  breath of perfume  had come to him straight out of a woman's soul.  There were seduction  and witchery to it. He saw Marette, an  enrapturing vision of  loveliness, floating before his eyes in that  sacred and mysterious  vestment of which he had stolen a half-  frightened glimpse. In  white&#8212;the white, cobwebby thing of laces  and embroidery that had hung  straight before his eyes&#8212;in white&#8212;  with her glorious black hair, her  violet eyes, her&#8212; 
  And then it was that the incongruity of the thing, the almost   sheer impossibility of it, clashed in upon his vision. Yet his  faith  was not shaken. Marette Radisson was of the North. He could  not  disbelieve that, even in the face of these amazing things that   confronted him. 
  Suddenly he heard a sound that was like the explosion of a gun   under his feet. It was the opening and closing of the hall door&#8212;  but  mostly the closing. The slam of it shook the house and rattled  the  glass in the windows. Kedsty had returned, and he was in a  rage. Kent  extinguished the light so that the room was in  darkness. Then he went  to the door. He could hear the quick, heavy  tread of Kedsty's feet  After that came the closing of a second  door, followed by the rumble  of Kedsty's voice. Kent was  disappointed. 
  The Inspector of Police and Marette were in a room too far distant   for him to distinguish what was said. But he knew that Kedsty had   returned to barracks and had discovered what had happened there.   After an interval his voice was a steady rumble. It rose higher.  He  heard the crash of a chair. Then the voice ceased, and after it  came  the tramping of Kedsty's feet. Not once did he catch the  sound of  Marette's voice, but he was sure that in the interval of  silence she  was talking. Then Kedsty's voice broke forth more  furiously than  before. Kent's fingers dug into the sill of the  door. Each moment  added to his conviction that Marette was in  danger. It was not  physical violence he feared. He did not believe  Kedsty capable of  perpetrating that upon a woman. It was fear that  he would take her to  barracks. The fact that Marette had told him  there was a powerful  reason why Kedsty would not do this failed to  assure him. For she had  also told him that Kedsty would kill her,  if he dared. He held himself  in readiness. At a cry from her, or  the first move on Kedsty's part to  take her from the bungalow, he  would give battle in spite of Marette's  warning. 
  He almost hoped one of these two things would happen. As he stood   there, listening, waiting, the thought became almost a prayer. He  had  Pelly's revolver. Within twenty seconds he could have Kedsty  looking  down the barrel of it. The night was ideal for escape.  Within half an  hour they would be on the river. They could even  load up with  provisions from Kedsty's place. He opened the door a  little more,  scarcely making an effort to combat the impulse that  dragged him out.  Marette must be in danger, or she would not have  confessed to him that  she was in the house of a man who would like  to see her dead. Why she  was there did not interest him deeply  now. It was the fact of the  moment that was moving him swiftly  toward action. 
  The door below opened again, and Kent's body grew rigid. He heard   Kedsty charging through the lower hall like a mad bull. The outer   door opened, slammed shut, and he was gone. 
  Kent drew back into the darkness of his room. It was some moments   before he heard Marette coming slowly up the stairs. She seemed to  be  groping her way, though there was a dim illumination out there.  Then  she came through the door into the blackness of her room. 
  &quot;Jeems,&quot; she whispered. 
  He went to her. Her hands reached out, and again they rested on   his arms. 
  &quot;You&#8212;you didn't come down the stair?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;You&#8212;didn't hear?&quot; 
  &quot;I heard no words. Only Kedsty's voice.&quot; 
  It seemed to him that her voice, when she spoke again, trembled   with an immeasurable relief. &quot;You were good, Jeems. I am glad.&quot; 
  In that darkness he could not see. Yet something reached into him,   thrilling him, quickening his pulse with a thing to which his eyes   were blind. He bent down. He found her lips upturned, offering him   the sweetness of the kiss which was to be his reward; and as he  felt  their warmth upon his own, he felt also the slightest  pressure of her  hands upon his arms. 
  &quot;He is gone. We will light the lamp again,&quot; she said then.
