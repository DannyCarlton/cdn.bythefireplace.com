As Cyril drove home from Waterloo next day to his lonely rooms in  Staple Inn, Holborn, he turned aside with his cab for a few minutes  to make a passing call at the bank in Lombard Street. He was short  of ready money, and wanted to cash a cheque for fifty pounds for  expenses incurred in his defence at Tavistock.    
The cashier stared at him hard; then, without consulting anybody,  he said, in a somewhat embarrassed tone, "I don't know whether  you're aware of it, Mr. Waring, but this overdraws your current  account. We haven't fifty pounds on our books to your credit."    
He was well posted on the subject, in fact, for only that morning  he had hunted up Cyril's balance in the ledger at his side for the  gratification of his own pure personal curiosity.    
Cyril stared at him in astonishment. In this age of surprises, one  more surprise was thus suddenly sprung upon him. His first impulse  was to exclaim in a very amazed voice, "Why, I've six thousand odd  pounds to my credit, surely;" but he checked himself in time with  a violent effort. How could he tell what strange things might have  happened in his absence? If the money was gone, and Nevitt was  murdered, and Guy in hiding, who could say what fresh complications  might not still be in store for him? So he merely answered, with  a strenuous endeavour to suppress his agitation, "Will you kindly  let me have my balance-sheet, if you please? I--ur--I thought I'd  more money than that still left with you."    
The cashier brought out a big book and a bundle of cheques, which  he handed to Cyril with a face of profound interest. To him, too,  this little drama was pregnant with mystery and personal implications.  Cyril turned the vouchers over one by one, with close attention,  recognising the signature and occasion of each, till he arrived  at last at a big cheque which staggered him sadly for a moment. He  took it up in his hands and examined it in the light. "Pay Self or  Bearer, Six Thousand Pounds (L6,000), Cyril Waring."    
Oh, horrible, horrible! This, then, was the secret of Guy's sudden  disappearance.    
He didn't cry aloud. He didn't say a word. He looked at the thing  hard, and knew in a moment exactly what had happened. Guy had  forged that cheque; it was Guy's natural hand, written forward like  Cyril's own, instead of backward, as usual. And no one but himself  could possibly have told it from his own true signature. But Cyril  knew it at once for Guy's by one infallible sign--a tiny sign that  might escape the veriest expert--some faint hesitation about the  tail of the capital C, which was shorter in Guy's hand than Cyril  ever made it, and which Guy had therefore deliberately lengthened,  by an effort or an afterthought, to complete the imitation.    
"You cashed that cheque yourself, sir, over the counter, you  remember," the cashier said quietly, "on the date it was drawn on."    
Cyril never altered a muscle of his rigid face.    
"Ah, quite so," he answered, in a very dry voice, not daring to  contradict the man. He knew just what had happened. Guy must have  come to get the money himself, and the cashier must have mistaken  him for the proper owner of the purloined six thousand. They were  so very much alike. Nobody ever distinguished them.    
"And that was one of the days, I think, when you proved the alibi  in Belgium before the Devonshire magistrates at Tavistock yesterday,"  the clerk went on, with a searching glance. Cyril started this  time. He saw in a second the new danger thus sprung upon him. If  the cashier chose to press the matter home to the hilt, he must  necessarily arrive at one or other of two results. Either the alibi  would break down altogether, or it would be perfectly clear that  Guy had committed a forgery.    
"So it seems," he answered, looking his keen interlocutor straight  in the eyes. "So it seems, I should say, by the date on the face  of it."    
But the cashier did <i>not</i> care to press the matter home any further;  and for a very good reason. It was none of his business to suggest  the idea of a forgery, after a cheque had been presented and duly  cashed, if the customer to whose account it was debited in course  chose voluntarily to accept the responsibility of honouring it.  The objection should come first from the customer's side. If <i>he</i>  didn't care to press it, then neither did the cashier. Why should  he, indeed? Why saddle his firm with six thousand pounds loss? He  would only get himself into trouble for having failed to observe  the discrepancy in the signatures, and the difference between the  brothers. That, after all, is what a cashier is for. If he doesn't  fulfil those first duties of his post, why what on earth can be  the good of him to anybody in any way?    
The two men looked at one another across the counter with a strong  inscrutable stare of mutual suspicion. Then Cyril slowly tore  up the cheque he had tendered for fifty pounds, filled in another  for his real balance of twenty-two, handed it across to the clerk  without another word, received the cash in white trembling hands,  and went out to his cab again in a turmoil of excitement.    
All the way back to his rooms in Staple Inn one seething idea alone  possessed his soul. His faith in Guy was beginning to break down.  And with it, his faith in himself almost went. The man was his own  brother--his very counterpart, he knew; could he really believe  him capable of committing a murder? Cyril looked within, and said  a thousand times <i>no</i>; he looked at that forged cheque, and his heart  misgave him.    
At Staple Inn, the housekeeper who took care of their joint rooms  came out to greet him with no small store of tears and lamentations.  "Oh, Mr. Cyril," she cried, seizing both his hands in hers with a  tremulous welcome, "I'm glad to see you back, and to know you're  innocent. I always said you never could have done it; no, no, not  you, nor yet Mr. Guy neither. The police has been here time and  again to search the rooms, but, the Lord be praised, they never  found anything. And I've got a letter for you, too, from Mr. Guy  himself; but there--I locked it up till you come in my own cupboard  at home, for fear of the detectives; and now you're back and safe  in London again, I'll run home this minute round the corner and  get it."    
Cyril sat down in the familiar easy-chair, holding his face in his  hands, and gazed about him blankly. Such a home-coming as this  was inexpressibly terrible to him.    
In a few minutes more the housekeeper came back, bringing in her  hand Guy's letter from Plymouth.    
Cyril sat for a minute and looked at the envelope in deadly silence.  Then he motioned the housekeeper out of the room with one quivering  hand. Before that good woman's face, he couldn't open it and read  it.    
As soon as she was gone, he tore it apart, trembling. As he read  and read the suspicion within him deepened quickly into a doubt,  the doubt into a conviction, the conviction into a certainty. He  clapped his hands to his head. Oh, God, what was this? Guy acknowledged  his own guilt! He confessed he had done it!    
Cyril's last hope was gone. Guy himself admitted it!    
"How I came to do it," the letter said, "I've no idea myself. A  sudden suggestion--a strange, unaccountable impulse--a prompting,  as it were, pressed upon me from without, and almost before I knew,  the crime was committed."    
Cyril bent his head low upon his knees with shame. He never  could hold up that head henceforth. No further doubt or hesitation  remained. He knew the whole truth. Guy was indeed a murderer.    
He steeled himself for the worst, and read the letter through  with a superhuman effort. It almost choked him to read. The very  consecutiveness and coherency of the sentences seemed all but  incredible under such awful circumstances. A murderer, red-handed,  to speak of his crime so calmly as that! And then, too, this undying  anger expressed and felt, even after death, against his victim  Nevitt! Cyril couldn't understand how any man--least of all his own  brother--could write such words about the murdered man whose body  was then lying all silent and cold, under the open sky, among the  bracken at Mambury.    
And once more, this awful clue of the dead man's pocket-book! Those  accursed notes! That hateful sum of money! How could Guy venture  to speak of it all in such terms as those--the one palpable fact  that indubitably linked him with that cold-blooded murder. "The  three thousand sent herewith I recovered, almost by a miracle, from  that false creature's grasp, under extraordinary circumstances,  and I return them now, in proof of the fact, in Montague Nevitt's  own pocket-book, which I'm sure you'll recognise as soon as you  look at it."    
Cyril saw it all now beyond the shadow of a doubt. He reconstructed  the whole sad tale. He was sure he understood it. But to understand  it was hardly even yet to believe it. Guy had lost heavily in the  Rio Negro Mines, as the prosecution declared; in an evil hour he'd  been cajoled into forging Cyril's name for six thousand. Montague  Nevitt had in some way misappropriated the stolen sum. Guy had  pursued him in a sudden white-heat of fury, had come up with him  unawares, had killed him in his rage, and now calmly returned as  much as he could recover of that fateful and twice-stolen money to  Cyril. It was all too horrible, but all too true. In a wild ferment  of remorse for his brother's sin, the unhappy painter sat down at  once and penned a letter of abject self-humiliation to Elma Clifford.    
"ELMA,-I said to you last night that I could never marry you till  I had clearly proved my brother Guy's innocence. Well, I said what  I can never conceivably do. Since returning to town I received a  letter from Guy himself. What it contained I must never tell you,  for Guy's own sake. But what I <i>must</i> tell you is this--I can never  again see you. Guy and I are so nearly one, in every nerve and  fibre of our being, that whatever he may have done is to me almost  as if I myself had done it. You will know how terrible a thing it  is for me to write these words, but for <i>your</i> sake I can't refrain  from writing them. Think no more of me. I am not worthy of you.  I will think of you as long as I live.    
"Your ever devoted and heart-broken    
"CYRIL."    
He folded the letter, and sent it off to the temporary address at  the West-End where Elma had told him that she and her mother would  spend the night in London. Very late that evening a ring came at  the bell. Cyril ran to the door. It was a boy with a telegram. He  opened it, and read it with breathless excitement.    
"Whatever Guy may have said, you are quite mistaken. There's a  mystery somewhere. Keep his letter and show it to me. I may, perhaps,  be able to unravel the tangle. I'm more than ever convinced that  what I said to you last night was perfectly true. We will save him  yet. Unalterably,    
"ELMA."    
But the telegram brought little peace to Cyril. Of what value were  Elma's vague intuitions now, by the side of Guy's own positive  confession? With his very own hand Guy admitted that he had done  it. Cyril went to bed that night, the unhappiest, loneliest man  in London. What Guy was, he was. He felt himself almost like the  actual murderer.
