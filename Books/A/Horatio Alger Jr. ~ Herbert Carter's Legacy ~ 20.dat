  When Herbert reached the hotel he went up at once to Mr. Cameron's   room. 
  &#8220;I believe I am a little late,&#8221; he said, apologetically; &#8220;but I was   detained at home by a matter of business.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are young to have your time occupied by matters of business,&#8221;   said the young man, smiling. 
  &#8220;Yes, if my father were alive it would not devolve upon me, but my   mother generally consults with me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope your business was arranged satisfactorily.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, but it came near turning out otherwise. I would like to tell  you  about it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do so,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron, kindly. &#8220;I shall be interested in  whatever  affects you.&#8221; 
  Herbert gave an account of Squire Leech's attempts to get  possession  of their cottage. 
  &#8220;But for that letter of Aunt Nancy's,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;we should  have  been obliged to part with our house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;For the paltry sum of twenty-two dollars and a half?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It wasn't paltry to us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, to be sure. Why didn't you tell me this morning? I would have   lent you the money.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You would?&#8221; exclaimed Herbert. 
  &#8220;With pleasure.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said our hero; &#8220;but I shouldn't have  dared  to ask such a favor of a stranger.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I must tell you that this Squire Leech has probably taken  advantage  of your ignorance of business. I don't know exactly how the  law is in  this State, but I presume that, so far from the squire being   authorized to take immediate possession of your place, he would be   obliged to give legal notice of sale, on foreclosure of mortgage, by   advertisement in some weekly paper. This would allow of sale at   auction to the highest bidder.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I didn't know that; I supposed the squire could order us out   immediately and take possession.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Squire Leech certainly knew better than that, but he evidently  wanted  to frighten your mother into selling to him at a sacrifice.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That was mean,&#8221; said Herbert, indignantly, &#8220;and he a rich man,  too.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I quite agree with you,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron. &#8220;If you have any  further  difficulty with this grasping capitalist, come to me and I  will give  you the best advice I can.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I will, Mr. Cameron, and thank you for your advice. You have  relieved  my mind. I will tell mother what you say. What would you like  to have  me read first?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We will put off the reading for a short time. I want to ask you a  few  more questions about yourself, not out of curiosity, but because I   may, if I understand your circumstances, some time have it in my power   to serve you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you, sir. I shall be very glad to tell you anything. I was   afraid you would not feel interested.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are my private secretary now and that insures my interest. How   long since did your father die?&#8221; 
  &#8220;A little over a year.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What was his business?&#8221; 
  &#8220;When he was a young man he was employed in a manufactory near   Providence, but the confinement injured his health and he learned the   carpenter's trade.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shouldn't think there would be much for a carpenter to do in a   small village like this.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My father managed to make a comfortable living but that was all.  At  the time he died, he considered that our house was mortgaged for  only  half its value, but Squire Leech thinks otherwise.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Squire Leech wants to get possession of your place. So that was  all  your father was able to leave you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, not quite all; there was something else which father seemed to   think was worth something, but I am afraid it will never do us any   good.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked Mr. Cameron. 
  &#8220;He was at work in his leisure for the last two years of his life  on  an invention.&#8221; 
  &#8220;An invention! Of what nature?&#8221; 
  &#8220;You know I told you he was employed in a cotton manufactory when a   young man. This made him familiar with spinning and weaving. He   thought he could make an improvement in some of the machinery used and   he worked out his idea in a wooden model.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you the model?&#8221; asked Cameron, with interest. 
  &#8220;Yes, sir, and also a written paper describing the invention. A few   days before he died father called me to his bedside and told me that   he wanted me some day to show his invention to a manufacturer and get   his opinion of it. He said that he hoped some time it would be a   source of profit to mother and myself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you ever done as he advised?&#8221; asked Cameron. 
  &#8220;I have never had opportunity. There is no manufacturing town near   here and I cannot afford to travel.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am myself the son of a cotton manufacturer,&#8221; said Cameron, &#8220;and,   though I have never been employed in the business, I have from my   boyhood been accustomed to visit my father's factory. My opinion may   be worth something, therefore. If you are willing to show me your   father's model&#8212;&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shall be very much obliged to you if you will look at it,&#8221; said   Herbert. &#8220;I have been afraid that father exaggerated its value and   that it might have defects which would prevent its being adopted   anywhere.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I will give you my opinion when I have seen it. And now suppose we   set to work. Here is a treatise on logic. You may begin and read it   very slowly, pausing at the end of every paragraph till I tell you to   go on.&#8221; 
  Herbert began to read as he had been requested. For the first two  or  three times he took very little interest in his subject and thought  it  very dry. In fact, it was not all he began to re-read the earlier   portions that he could comprehend much of it. 
  &#8220;Now,&#8221; said Cameron, after he had read half an hour, &#8220;I have  something  else for you to do. You are not only my reader, but I must  make you my  teacher, too.&#8221; 
  Herbert laughed, saying: &#8220;I think you'll have to get somebody that   knows more than I, then; I wouldn't venture to teach a college   student.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I mean that you shall hear my lessons. I want you to imagine  yourself  a college professor and ask me questions on what you have  just read.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you think I can?&#8221; 
  &#8220;You may bungle a little at first, but you'll improve. If you do  well,  when I get through with you I will try to get you a professor's  chair  at some college.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should like that, if professors get well paid.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They generally get more than five dollars a week; but that is all   that I can afford to pay at present.&#8221; &#8220;I'm only an apprentice,&#8221; said   Herbert smiling, &#8220;and am quite satisfied.&#8221; 
  Herbert began to question Cameron on what he had been reading. He  did  not find it altogether easy, partly from want of practice, partly   because the subject was one he knew nothing about. But whenever   blunders were made Cameron laughed good-naturedly and the young   professor joined in the merriment. 
  &#8220;We'll take political economy next,&#8221; said the student. &#8220;You won't  find  that so dry as logic.&#8221; 
  Though political economy is generally studied in the junior or  senior  year at college, its principles, if familiarly illustrated, are  not  beyond the comprehension of a boy of fifteen. He found himself  reading  with interest, and when he came to act the role of professor  he  acquitted himself more creditably than with logic. 
  &#8220;I think,&#8221; said Cameron, &#8220;I shall recommend you for the chair of   political economy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I like it much better,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;So do I. Still, logic is important in its way. Tomorrow I must try   you on Latin.&#8221; &#8220;I am afraid it won't be much use,&#8221; said our hero. &#8220;I   have studied it a little two winters when we had a college student   keeping our winter school.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you know as much as that you will answer my purpose better than  I  anticipated. Now we'll take a walk. You shall show me the houses of   Wrayburn.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The houses of Wrayburn are four in number,&#8221; said Herbert; &#8220;the two   churches, the town hall, and Squire Leech's house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There's another walk which I prefer; I mean to Prospect Pond.  Suppose  we walk over to it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shall be glad to,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;You are a very accommodating professor. You let me off from study   when I feel lazy.&#8221;
