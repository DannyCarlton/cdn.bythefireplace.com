If the reception at the White House had been calm, Betty's <i>salon</i> on  the following evening was not. On Tuesday the House, after duly  relieving its feelings by an hour and a half of war talk, flaming with  every variety of patriotism, passed the bill appropriating $50,000,000  for the national defence. On Wednesday the bill passed the Senate  without a word beyond the "ayes" of its members. On the morrow the War  Department would begin the mobilization of the army; and although the  <i>Maine</i> Court of Inquiry had not completed its labours, the New York  World, in the interest of curious humanity, had instituted a submarine  inquiry of its own and given the result to the country. Even Senator  North regarded war as almost inevitable, although the controvertible  proof of explosion from without only involved the Spanish by  inference.    
The women who were privileged to attend the now famous <i>salon</i> wore  their freshest and most becoming gowns, and most of the Senators would  have been glad to have frivoled away the evening in compliments, so  refreshing was the sight of an attractive face after a long and  anxious day. But the eyes of the women sparkled with patriotic fire  only. One burst into tears and others threatened hysterics, but got  through the evening comfortably. Mrs. Madison sat on a sofa and fanned  herself nervously; Senator Maxwell and Senator North at her request  kept close to her side.    
"They were not so excited during the Civil War," she exclaimed, as a  shrill voice smote her ear. "I suppose we have developed more nerves  or something."    
"The mind was possessed by the Grim Fact during the Civil War," said  Senator Maxwell. "This is a second-rate thing that appeals to the  nerves and not to the soul."    
Betty, who understood the patient longing of her statesmen for  variety, had imported for the evening several members of the troupe  singing at the Metropolitan Opera House. Conversation consequently was  interrupted six or seven times, but it burst forth with increased  vigour at the end of every song; and when the Polish tenor with  mistaken affability sang "The Star Spangled Banner," the women and  some of the younger men took it up with such vehemence that Mrs.  Madison put her fingers to her ears. When one girl jumped on a chair  and waved her handkerchief, which she had painted red, white, and  blue, the unwilling hostess asked Senator North if he thought Betty  would be able to keep her head till the end of the evening, or would  be excited to some extraordinary antic.    
"There is not the least danger," he replied soothingly. "Miss Madison  could manage to look impassive if a cyclone were raging within her. It  is a long while since the Americans have had a chance to be excited.  You must make allowances."    
Betty for some time had suppressed her Populist with difficulty. He  was one of those Americans to whom a keen thin face and a fair  education give the superficial appearance of refinement. In a country  as democratic as the United States and where schooling and  intelligence are so widespread, it is possible for many half-bred men  to create a good impression when in an equable frame of mind. But  excitement tears their thin coat of gentility in twain, and Betty  already regretted having invited Armstrong to her salon. He had not  missed a Thursday evening, for he not only appreciated the social  advantage of a footing in such a house, but his clever mind enjoyed  the conversation there, and the frankly expressed opinions of well-  bred people who argued without acerbity and never called each other  names. With his slender well-dressed figure and bright fair sharply  cut face, he by no means looked an alien, and if he could have  corrected the habit of contradicting people up and down--to say  nothing of his occasional indulgence in the Congressional snort--his  manners would have passed muster in any gathering. He was a good  specimen of the ambitious American of obscure birth and clever but  shallow brain, quick to seize every opportunity for advancement. But  politics were his strongest instinct, and exciting crises stifled  every other.    
He was very much excited to-night, for he had, during the afternoon,  tried three times to bring in a war resolution, and thrice been  extinguished by the Speaker. When the tenor started "The Star-Spangled  Banner," he braced himself against the wall and sang at the top of his  lungs; and the performance seemed to lash his temper rather than  relieve it. He twice raised his voice to unburden his mind, and was  distracted by Betty, who kept him close beside her. Finally she  attempted to change the subject by chatting of personal matters.    
"I went to the White House last night," she said, "and was delighted  to find that the President had the most charming manners--"    
"What's a manner?" interrupted Armstrong, roughly. "You women are all  alike. I suppose you'd turn up your nose at William J. Bryan because  he ain't what you call a gentleman. But if he were in the White House  instead of that milk-and-water puppet of Wall Street, we'd be shooting  those murderers down in Cuba as we ought to be. The President and the  whole Republican party," he shouted, "are a lot of hogs who've chawed  so much gold their digestion won't work and their brains are torpid;  and there's nothing to do but to kick them into this war--the whole  greedy, white-livered, Trust-owned, thieving lot of them, including  that great immaculate Joss up at the White House with his manners.  Damn his manners! They come too high--"    
"Armstrong," said Burleigh soothingly, but with a glint in his eye, "I  have an important communication to make to you. Will you come out into  the hall a moment?" He passed his arm through the Populist's, and led  him unresistingly away.    
Betty glanced at her mother. Mrs. Madison was fanning herself with an  air of profound satisfaction. As she met her daughter's eyes, she  raised her brows, and her whole being breathed the content of the  successful prophetess. Senator North looked grimly amused. Betty  turned away hastily. She felt much like laughing, herself.    
Burleigh returned alone. "I took the liberty of telling him to go and  not to come again," he said. "That sort of man never apologizes, so  you are rid of him."    
Betty smiled and thanked him; then she frowned a little, for she saw  several people glance significantly at each other. She knew that  Washington took it for granted she would marry Burleigh.    
They went in to supper a few moments later, and in that admirable meal  the weary statesmen found the solace that woman denied him. And the  flowers were fragrant; the candlelight was grateful to tired eyes, and  the champagne unrivalled. Until the toasts--which in this agitated  time had become a necessary feature of the <i>salon</i>--the conversation,  under the tactful management of Betty and several of her friends, and  the diverting influence of the great singers, was but a subdued hum  about nothing in particular. When at the end of an hour Burleigh rose  impulsively and proposed the health of the President, even the  Democrats responded with as much warmth as courtesy.    
"You manage your belligerents very well," said Senator North, when he  shook her hand awhile later. "Yours has probably been the only amiable  supper-room in Washington to-night."
