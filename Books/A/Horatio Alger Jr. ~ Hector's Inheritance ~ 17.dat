    It would be natural to suppose that Jim Smith, relying upon his   influence with his uncle, would have reported this last &quot;outrage,&quot;  as  he chose to consider it, to the principal, thus securing the   punishment of Hector. But he was crafty, and considered that no   punishment Hector was likely to receive would satisfy him. Corporal   punishment for taking the part of an ill-used boy, Hector was   probably too spirited to submit to, and, under these circumstances,   it would hardly have been inflicted. Besides, Jim was aware that the   offense for which Hector had attacked him was not likely, if made   known, to secure sympathy. Even his uncle would be against him, for   he was fond of money, and had no wish to lose the new pupil, whose   friends were well able to pay for him. 
  No! He decided that what he wanted was to bring Hector into   disgrace. The method did not immediately occur to him, but after a   while he saw his way clear. 
  His uncle's bedchamber was on the second floor, and Jim's directly   over it on the third story. Some of the other boys, including  Hector,  had rooms also on the third floor. 
  Jim was going upstairs one day when, through the door of his  uncle's  chamber, which chanced to be open, he saw a wallet lying on  the  bureau. On the impulse of the moment, he walked in on tiptoes,   secured the wallet, and slipped it hurriedly into his pocket. Then  he  made all haste upstairs, and bolted himself into his own room.  Two  other boys slept there, but both were downstairs in the  playground. 
  Jim took the wallet from his pocket and eagerly scanned the   contents. There were eight five-dollar bills and ten dollars in  small  bills, besides a few papers, which may be accurately described  as of  no value to anyone but the owner. 
  The boy's face assumed a covetous look. He, as well as his uncle,   was fond of money&#8212;a taste which, unfortunately, as he regarded it,   he was unable to gratify. His family was poor, and he was received  at  half price by Socrates Smith on the score of relationship, but  his  allowance of pocket money was less than that of many of the  small  boys. He made up the deficiency, in part, by compelling them  to  contribute to his pleasures. If any boy purchased candy, or any  other  delicacy, Jim, if he learned the fact, required him to give  him a  portion, just as the feudal lords exacted tribute from their  serfs and  dependents. Still, this was not wholly satisfactory, and  Jim longed,  instead, for a supply of money to spend as he chose. 
  So the thought came to him, as he scanned the contents of the   wallet: &quot;Why shouldn't I take out one or two of these bills before   disposing of it? No one will lay it to me.&quot; 
  The temptation proved too strong for Jim's power of resistance. He   selected a five-dollar bill and five dollars in small bills, and   reluctantly replaced the rest of the money in the wallet. 
  &quot;So far, so good!&quot; he thought. &quot;That's a good idea.&quot; 
  Then, unlocking the door, he passed along the entry till he came to   the room occupied by Hector. As he or one of the two boys who roomed   with him might be in the room, he looked first through the keyhole. 
  &quot;The coast is clear!&quot; he said to himself, in a tone of  satisfaction. 
  Still, he opened the door cautiously, and stepped with catlike  tread  into the room. Then he looked about the room. Hanging on nails  were  several garments belonging to the inmates of the room. Jim  selected  a pair of pants which he knew belonged to Hector, and  hurrying  forward, thrust the wallet into one of the side pockets.  Then, with  a look of satisfaction, he left the room, shutting the door   carefully behind him. 
  &quot;There,&quot; he said to himself, with exultation. &quot;That'll fix him!   Perhaps he'll wish he hadn't put on quite so many airs.&quot; 
  He was rather annoyed, as he walked along the corridor, back to his   own room, to encounter Wilkins. He had artfully chosen a time when  he  thought all the boys would be out, and he heartily wished that  some  untoward chance had not brought Wilkins in. 
  &quot;Where are you going, Jim?&quot; asked Wilkins. 
  &quot;I went to Bates' room, thinking he might be in, but he wasn't.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you want him? I left him out on the playground.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, it's no matter! It'll keep!&quot; said Jim, indifferently. 
  &quot;I got out of that pretty well!&quot; he reflected complacently. 
  Perhaps Jim Smith would not have felt quite so complacent, if he  had  known that at the time he entered Hector's room it was occupied,   though he could not see the occupant. It so chanced that Ben Platt,   one of Hector's roommates, was in the closet, concealed from the  view  of anyone entering the room, yet so placed that he could see  through  the partially open door what wras passing in the room. 
  When he saw Jim Smith enter he was surprised, for he knew that that   young man was not on visiting terms with the boy who had discomfited   and humiliated him. 
  &quot;What on earth can Jim want?&quot; he asked himself. 
  He did not have long to wait for an answer though not a real one;   but actions, as men have often heard, speak louder than words. 
  When he saw Jim steal up to Hector's pants, and producing a wallet,   hastily thrust it into one of the pockets, he could hardly believe   the testimony of his eyes. 
  &quot;Well!&quot; he ejaculated, inwardly, &quot;I would not have believed it if I   hadn't seen it. I knew Jim was a bully and a tyrant, but I didn't   think he was as contemptible as all that.&quot; 
  The wallet he recognized at once, for he had more than once seen   Socrates take it out of his pocket. 
  &quot;It's old Sock's wallet!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;It's clear that Jim   has taken it, and means to have it found in Roscoe's possession.   That's as mean a trick as I ever heard of.&quot; 
  Just then Wilkins entered the room. Wilkins and Ben Platt were   Hector's two roommates. 
  &quot;Hello, Wilkins! I'm glad you've come just as you have.&quot; 
  &quot;What for, Platt? Do you want to borrow some money?&quot; 
  &quot;No; there is more money in this room now than there has been for a   long time.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean? The governor hasn't sent you a remittance, has   he?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;Expound your meaning, then, most learned and mysterious chum.&quot; 
  &quot;I will. Within five minutes Jim Smith has been here and left a   wallet of money.&quot; 
  &quot;Jim been here? I met him in the corridor.&quot; 
  &quot;I warrant he didn't say he had been here.&quot; 
  &quot;No; he said he had been to Bates' room, but didn't find him  there.&quot; 
  &quot;That's all gammon! Wilkins, what will you say when I tell you that   old Sock's wallet is in this very room!&quot; 
  &quot;I won't believe it!&quot; 
  &quot;Look here, then!&quot; 
  As he spoke, Ben went to Hector's pants and drew out the wallet. 
  Wilkins started in surprise and dismay. 
  &quot;How did Roscoe come by that?&quot; he asked; &quot;surely he didn't take  it?&quot; 
  &quot;Of course he didn't. You might know Roscoe better. Didn't you hear   me say just now that Jim brought it here?&quot; 
  &quot;And put it in Roscoe's pocket?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;In your presence?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; only he didn't know that I was present,&quot; said Platt. 
  &quot;Where were you?&quot; 
  &quot;In the closet. The door was partly open, and I saw everything.&quot; 
  &quot;What does it all mean?&quot; 
  &quot;Can't you see? It's Jim's way of coming up with Roscoe. You know  he  threatened that he'd fix him.&quot; 
  &quot;All I can say is, that it's a very mean way,&quot; said Wilkins in   disgust. 
  He was not a model boy&#8212;far from it, indeed!&#8212;but he had a  sentiment  of honor that made him dislike and denounce a conspiracy  like this. 
  &quot;It's a dirty trick,&quot; he said, warmly. 
  &quot;I agree with you on that point.&quot; &quot;What shall we do about it?&quot; 
  &quot;Lay low, and wait till the whole thing comes out. When Sock   discovers his loss, Jim will be on hand to tell him where his wallet   is. Then we can up and tell all we know.&quot; 
  &quot;Good! There's a jolly row coming!&quot; said Wilkins, smacking his  lips.
