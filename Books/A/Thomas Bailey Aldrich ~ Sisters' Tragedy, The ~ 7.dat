[Midnight.] 
First, two white arms that held him very close,<br> And ever closer as he drew him back<br> Reluctantly, the loose gold-colored hair<br> A thousand delicate fibres reaching out<br> Still to detain him; then some twenty steps<br> Of iron staircase winding round and down,<br> And ending in a narrow gallery hung<br> With Gobelin tapestries--Andromeda<br> Rescued by Perseus, and the sleek Diana<br> With her nymphs bathing; at the farther end<br> A door that gave upon a starlit grove<br> Of citron and clipt palm-trees; then a path<br> As bleached as moonlight, with the shadow of leaves<br> Stamped black upon it; next a vine-clad length<br> Of solid masonry; and last of all<br> A Gothic archway packed with night, and then--<br> A sudden gleaming dagger through his heart.
