Frida seated herself in her misery on the ice-worn boulder where  three minutes earlier Bertram had been sitting. Her face was buried  in her bloodless hands. All the world grew blank to her.    
Monteith, for his part, sat down a little way off with folded arms  on another sarsen-stone, fronting her. The strange and unearthly  scene they had just passed through impressed him profoundly. For  the first few minutes a great horror held him. But his dogged  Scottish nature still brooded over his wrongs, in spite of the  terrible sight he had so unexpectedly evoked. In a way, he felt he  had had his revenge; for had he not drawn upon his man, and fired  at him and killed him? Still, after the fever and torment of the  last few days, it was a relief to find, after all, he was not, as  this world would judge, a murderer. Man and crime were alike mere  airy phantoms. He could go back now to the inn and explain with a  glib tongue how Mr. Ingledew had been hurriedly called away to town  on important business. There was no corpse on the moor, no blabbing  blood to tell the story of his attempted murder: nobody anywhere,  he felt certain in his own stolid soul, would miss the mysterious  Alien who came to them from beyond the distant abyss of centuries.  With true Scotch caution, indeed, even in the midst of his wrath,  Robert Monteith had never said a word to any one at Brackenhurst of  how his wife had left him. He was too proud a man, if it came to  that, to acknowledge what seemed to him a personal disgrace, till  circumstances should absolutely force such acknowledgment upon him.  He had glossed it over meanwhile with the servants and neighbours  by saying that Mrs. Monteith had gone away with the children for  their accustomed holiday as always in August. Frida had actually  chosen the day appointed for their seaside journey as the fittest  moment for her departure with Bertram, so his story was received  without doubt or inquiry. He had bottled up his wrath in his own  silent soul. There was still room, therefore, to make all right  again at home in the eyes of the world--if but Frida was willing.  So he sat there long, staring hard at his wife in speechless  debate, and discussing with himself whether or not to make  temporary overtures of peace to her.    
In this matter, his pride itself fought hard with his pride. That  is the wont of savages. Would it not be better, now Bertram  Ingledew had fairly disappeared for ever from their sphere, to  patch up a hollow truce for a time at least with Frida, and let all  things be to the outer eye exactly as they had always been? The  bewildering and brain-staggering occurrences of the last half-hour,  indeed, had struck deep and far into his hard Scotch nature. The  knowledge that the man who had stolen his wife from him (as he  phrased it to himself in his curious belated mediaeval phraseology)  was not a real live man of flesh and blood at all, but an  evanescent phantom of the twenty-fifth century, made him all the  more ready to patch up for the time-being a nominal reconciliation.  His nerves--for even <i>he</i> had nerves--were still trembling to the  core with the mystic events of that wizard morning; but clearer and  clearer still it dawned upon him each moment that if things were  ever to be set right at all they must be set right then and there,  before he returned to the inn, and before Frida once more went back  to their children. To be sure, it was Frida's place to ask  forgiveness first, and make the first advances. But Frida made no  move. So after sitting there long, salving his masculine vanity  with the flattering thought that after all his rival was no mere  man at all, but a spirit, an avatar, a thing of pure imagination,  he raised his head at last and looked inquiringly towards Frida.    
"Well?" he said slowly.    
Frida raised her head from her hands and gazed across at him  scornfully.    
"I was thinking," Monteith began, feeling his way with caution,  but with a magnanimous air, "that perhaps--after all--for the  children's sake, Frida--"    
With a terrible look, his wife rose up and fronted him. Her face  was red as fire; her heart was burning. She spoke with fierce  energy. "Robert Monteith," she said firmly, not even deigning to  treat him as one who had once been her husband, "for the children's  sake, or for my own sake, or for any power on earth, do you think,  poor empty soul, after I've spent three days of my life with <i>him</i>,  I'd ever spend three hours again with <i>you</i>? If you do, then this is  all: murderer that you are, you mistake my nature."    
And turning on her heel, she moved slowly away towards the far edge  of the moor with a queenly gesture.    
Monteith followed her up a step or two. She turned and waved him  back. He stood glued to the ground, that weird sense of the  supernatural once more overcoming him. For some seconds he watched  her without speaking a word. Then at last he broke out. "What are  you going to do, Frida?" he asked, almost anxiously.    
Frida turned and glanced back at him with scornful eyes. Her mien  was resolute. The revolver with which he had shot Bertram Ingledew  lay close by her feet, among the bracken on the heath, where  Monteith had flung it. She picked it up with one hand, and once  more waved him backward.    
"I'm going to follow him," she answered solemnly, in a very cold  voice, "where <i>you</i> have sent him. But alone by myself: not here,  before you." And she brushed him away, as he tried to seize it,  with regal dignity.    
Monteith, abashed, turned back without one word, and made his way  to the inn in the little village. But Frida walked on by herself,  in the opposite direction, across the open moor and through the  purple heath, towards black despair and the trout-ponds at  Broughton.
