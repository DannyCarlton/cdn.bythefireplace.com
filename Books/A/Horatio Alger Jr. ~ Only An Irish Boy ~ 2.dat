  Andy Burke was not the boy to run away from an opponent of his own  size and age. Neither did he propose to submit quietly to the thrashing  which Godfrey designed to give him. He dropped his stick and bundle,  and squared off scientifically at his aristocratic foe.
  Godfrey paused an instant before him.
  &#8220;I'm going to give you a thrashing,&#8221; he said; &#8220;the worst thrashing  you ever had.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you, now?&#8221; asked Andy, undismayed. &#8220;Come on, thin; I'm ready  for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're an impudent young ruffian.&#8221;
  &#8220;So are you.&#8221;
  Godfrey's aristocratic blood boiled at this retort, and he struck  out at Andy, but the latter knew what was coming, and, swift as a  flash, warded it off, and fetched Godfrey a blow full upon his nose,  which started the blood. Now, the pain and the sight of the blood  combined filled him with added fury, and he attempted to seize Andy  around the waist and throw him. But here again he was foiled. The young  Irish boy evaded his grasp, and, seizing him in turn, by an adroit  movement of the foot, tripped him up. Godfrey fell heavily on his back.
  Andy withdrew a little, and did not offer to hold him down, as  Godfrey would have been sure to do under similar circumstances. &#8220;Have  you got enough?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;That wasn't fair,&#8221; exclaimed Godfrey, jumping up hastily, deeply  mortified because he had been worsted in the presence of John, who,  sooth to say, rather enjoyed his young master's overthrow.
  He rushed impetuously at Andy, but he was blinded by his own  impetuosity, and his adversary, who kept cool and self-possessed, had,  of course, the advantage. So the engagement terminated as  before&#8212;Godfrey was stretched once more on the sidewalk. He was about  to renew the assault, however, when there was an interruption. This  interruption came in the form of Colonel Preston himself, who was  returning from a business meeting of citizens interested in  establishing a savings bank in the village.
  &#8220;What's all this, Godfrey?&#8221; he called out, in a commanding tone.
  Godfrey knew that when his father spoke he must obey, and he  therefore desisted from the contemplated attack. He looked up at his  father and said, sulkily:
  &#8220;I was punishing this Irish boy for his impertinence.&#8221;
  John grinned a little at this way of putting it, and his father  said:
  &#8220;It looked very much as if he were punishing you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't get fair hold,&#8221; said Godfrey, sulkily.
  &#8220;So he was impertinent, was he? What did he say?&#8221;
  &#8220;He said I was no gentleman.&#8221;
  Andy Burke listened attentively to what was said, but didn't attempt  to justify himself as yet.
  &#8220;I have sometimes had suspicions of that myself,&#8221; said his father,  quietly.
  Though Godfrey was an only son, his father was sensible enough to be  fully aware of his faults. If he was indulged, it was his mother, not  his father, that was in fault. Colonel Preston was a fair and just man,  and had sensible views about home discipline; but he was overruled by  his wife, whose character may be judged from the fact that her son  closely resembled her. She was vain, haughty, and proud of putting on  airs. She considered herself quite the finest lady in the village, but  condescended to associate with the wives of the minister, the doctor,  and a few of the richer inhabitants, but even with them she took care  to show that she regarded herself superior to them all. She was,  therefore, unpopular, as was her son among his companions. However,  these two stood by each other, and Mrs. Preston was sure to defend  Godfrey in all he did, and complained because his father did not do the  same.
  &#8220;I didn't think you'd turn against me, and let a low boy insult me,&#8221;  complained Godfrey.
  &#8220;Why do you call him low?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because he's only an Irish boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Some of our most distinguished men have been Irish boys or of Irish  descent. I don't think you have proved your point.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's a beggar.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not a beggar,&#8221; exclaimed Andy, speaking for the first time. &#8220;I  never begged a penny in all my life.&#8221;
  &#8220;Look at his rags,&#8221; said Godfrey, scornfully.
  &#8220;You would be in rags, too, if you had to buy your own clothes. I  think I should respect you very much more under the circumstances,&#8221;  returned his father.
  &#8220;The colonel's a-givin' it to him,&#8221; thought John, with a grin.  &#8220;'Twon't do the young master any harm.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is your name?&#8221; inquired Colonel Preston, turning now to our  hero, as his son seemed to have no more to say.
  &#8220;Andy Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you live here?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've just come to town, sir. My mother lives here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where does she live?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know, sir, just. He knows,&#8221; pointing out John.
  &#8220;I calcerlate his mother lives in old Jake Barlow's house,&#8221; said  John.
  &#8220;Oh, the Widow Burke. Yes, I know. I believe Mrs. Preston employs  her sometimes. Well, Andy, if that's your name, how is it that I catch  you fighting with my son? That is not very creditable, unless you have  good cause.&#8221;
  &#8220;He called my mother a low woman,&#8221; said Andy, &#8220;and then he run up  and hit me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you do that, Godfrey?&#8221;
  &#8220;He was putting on too many airs. He talked as if he was my equal.&#8221;
  &#8220;He appears to be more than your equal in strength,&#8221; said his  father. &#8220;Well, was that all?&#8221;
  &#8220;It was about all.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I think he did perfectly right, and I hope you'll profit by  the lesson you have received.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is a gentleman,&#8221; thought Andy. &#8220;He ain't hard on a boy because  he's poor.&#8221;
  Colonel Preston went into the house, but Godfrey lingered behind a  moment. He wanted to have a parting shot at his adversary. He could  fight with words, if not with blows.
  &#8220;Look here!&#8221; he said, imperiously; &#8220;don't let me see you round here  again.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want to see you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you can look the other way,&#8221; said Andy, independently.
  &#8220;This is my house.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought it was your father's.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the same thing. You'd better stay at home with your mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Andy; &#8220;you're very kind. May I come along the road  sometimes?&#8221;
  &#8220;If you do, walk on the other side.&#8221;
  Andy laughed. He was no longer provoked, but amused.
  &#8220;Then, by the same token, you'd better not come by my mother's  house,&#8221; he said, good-humoredly.
  &#8220;I don't want to come near your miserable shanty,&#8221; said Godfrey,  disdainfully.
  &#8220;You may come, if you keep on the other side of the road,&#8221; said  Andy, slyly.
  Godfrey was getting disgusted; for in the war of words, as well as  of blows, his ragged opponent seemed to be getting the better of him.  He turned on his heel and entered the house. He was sure of one who  would sympathize with him in his dislike and contempt for Andy&#8212;this  was, of course, his mother. Besides, he had another idea. He knew that  Mrs. Burke had been employed by his mother, occasionally, to assist in  the house. It occurred to him that it would be a fine piece of revenge  to induce her to dispense hereafter with the poor woman's services.  Bent on accomplishing this creditable retaliation, he left his young  opponent master of the field.
  &#8220;I must be goin',&#8221; said Andy, as he picked up his bundle and  suspended it from his stick. &#8220;Will I find the house where my mother  lives, easy?&#8221;
  The question was, of course, addressed to John, who had just turned  to go to the stable.
  &#8220;You can't miss it,&#8221; answered John. &#8220;It's a mile up the road, stands  a little way back. There's a few hills of potatoes in the front yard.  How long since you saw your mother?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's three months.&#8221;
  &#8220;Does she know you are coming to-day?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. I would have wrote to her, but my fingers isn't very ready with  the pen.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor mine either,&#8221; said John. &#8220;I'd rather take a licking any time  than write a letter. Come round and see us some time.&#8221;
  &#8220;The boy'll lick me,&#8221; said Andy, laughing.
  &#8220;I guess you can manage him.&#8221;
  Andy smiled, for it was his own conviction, also. With his bundle on  his shoulder he trudged on, light of heart, for he was about to see his  mother and sister, both of whom he warmly loved.
