Betty had invited Senator Burleigh to dinner on Saturday, that he  might feel free to call elsewhere on Sunday. At four o'clock, when  Mrs. Madison had retired for her nap, she commanded Jack Emory to take  Harriet for a long walk and a long ride on the cable cars, and to stop  for Sally Carter. No one else was likely to call, and she retired to  her boudoir, a three-cornered room in an angle between the parlor and  library, to await Senator North.    
The boudoir was a room that any man might look forward to after a hard  day on Capitol Hill. Its easychairs were very soft and deep, its rugs  were rosy and delicate, and the walls and windows and doors were hung  with one of those old French silk stuffs with a design of royal  conventionality and uniformly old rose in colour. All of Betty's own  books were there, her piano, several handsome pieces of carved oak,  and a unique collection of ivory. Betty had banished the former  girlish simplicity of this room a few days after her introduction to  the Montgomery house. She had imagined herself greeting Senator North  in it many times, and had received no other man within its now sacred  walls.    
She wore a white cloth gown today and a blue ribbon in her hair. There  was also a touch of blue at the neck, to make her throat look the  whiter. Otherwise, the long closely fitting gown was without ornament  as far down as the hem, which was lightly embroidered in white. She  looked tall and lithe, but her figure was round, and did not sway like  a reed that a strong wind would beat to the ground, as Harriet's did.  Although that possible descendant of African kings possessed the black  splendour of eyes and hair and a marble regularity of feature, Betty  was the more beautiful woman of the two; for her colour filled and  warmed the eye, she seemed typical of womanhood in its highest  development, and she was a chosen receptacle of enchantment. Moreover,  she was more modern and original, and as healthy as had been the  fashion for the past generation, Harriet looked like an old Roman coin  come to life, with a blight on her soul and little blood in her thin  body. It was not in Betty's nature to fear any woman, much less to  experience petty jealousy, but it was not without satisfaction she  reflected that she and Harriet would hardly attract the same sort of  man. Jack was doing his duty nobly, and he liked vivacious women who  amused him, poor soul! As for Senator Burleigh, he had said politely  that she was handsome but looked delicate, and then unquestionably  dismissed her from his mind. He and Betty had talked politics on the  previous evening until Mrs. Madison had slipped off to bed an hour  earlier than usual.    
Betty dismissed them all from her mind and glanced at the clock. It  was half-past four. She thrust the poker between the glowing logs, and  the flames leaped and sent a quivering glow through the charming room.  Betty leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes, almost holding her  breath that she might hear the advancing step of the butler the  sooner. In what seemed to her exactly thirty minutes she looked at the  clock again. It was twenty-five minutes to five. She nestled down,  assuring herself that nobody could be expected to come on the moment,  but this time she did not close her eyes; she watched the clock.    
And the joy imperceptibly died out of her; the hands travelled  inexorably round to ten minutes to five; she remembered that she had  not seen Senator North since Wednesday, and that in four days a busy  legislator might easily forget the existence of every woman he knew,  except perhaps of the woman he loved. Within her seemed to rise a tide  of bitter memories, the memories of all those women who had sat and  waited through dreary hours for man's uncertain coming. She shivered  and drew close to the fire and covered her face with her hands. Her  heart ached for the helpless misery of her sex.    
But she sprang suddenly to her feet. The butler was coming down the  hall. A moment later he had ushered in Senator North, and Betty forgot  the misery of the world, forgot it so completely that there was no  violent reaction; she was merely what she had been at half-past four,  full of pleasurable excitement held down and watched over by the  instinct of caution.    
"I must apologize humbly for being late," he said, "but on Sunday I  always sit with my wife until she falls asleep, and to-day she was  nearly an hour later than usual. What a room to come into out of a  biting wind! Thank heaven I was able to get here."    
Betty thought of the sister and cousin she had turned out into the  cruel afternoon, and then looked at Senator North deep in the chair  where she had so often imagined him, and forgot their existence. This  was her hour--her first, at least--and visions of pneumonia and  possible consumption should not mar it. She sat opposite him in a  straight dark high-backed chair, and she was quite aware that she made  a delightful picture.    
"Well?" he asked. "What of your visit and its consequences?"    
Betty told the story; and her description of the dilapidated parsonage  at the head of the miserable village, the group of silent women about  the coffin in the dark room, and her interview with her melancholy  relative was as dramatic as she had felt at the time.    
"I thought I was running from a nightmare when I left the house," she  concluded, smiling at him as if to demonstrate that it had left no  shadow in her brain; "but now we both feel better. She wants a gown of  many colours, and this morning she roused the house at five o'clock  singing camp-meeting hymns. But I think she is quick and observant,  and will soon cease to be in any danger of betraying herself. But she  is a great responsibility, and I really felt old this morning."    
Senator North laughed. "I hope she won't give you any real trouble. If  she does, I shall feel more than half responsible. But otherwise she  will be an interesting study for you. She is nearly all white; how  much of racial lying, and slothfulness, barbarism, and general  incapacity that black vein of hers contains will give you food for  thought, for she certainly will reveal herself in the course of a  year."    
"You must admit that a nature like that is a great responsibility."    
"Yes, but she alone can work through all the contradictions to the  light, and she will do it naturally, under pressure of new  experiences, within and without. Don't suggest even the word 'problem'  to her, and don't look upon her as one, yourself. You have put her in  the right conditions. Leave her alone and Time will do the rest. His  work is indubious; never forget that. Are you going to marry  Burleigh?" he added abruptly.    
She answered vehemently, "No! No!" "I thought not. I know you very  little, so far, but I was willing to deny the report."    
"I often wonder why I don't fall in love with him. He really has every  quality I admire. But much as I like him I should not mind if I knew I  never should see him again. I have thought a good deal about it and I  should like to understand it."    
She looked at him coaxingly, and he smiled, for he understood women  very well; but he gave her the explanation she desired.    
"The reason is simple enough. The admired qualities, even when they  are the component parts of a personality of one who more or less  resembles a cherished ideal, never yet inspired love. Love is the  result of two responsive sparks coming within each other's range of  action. Their owners may be in certain ways unfitted for one another,  but the responsive sparks, rising Nature only knows out of what  combination of elements, fly straight, and Reason sulks. To put it  in another way: Love is merely the intuitive faculty recognizing in  another being the power to give its own lord happiness. It is a  faculty that is very active in some people," he added with a laugh,  "and when it is overworked it often goes wrong, like any other  machinery. That is the reason why men who have loved many women make a  mistake in marrying; the intuitive faculty is both dulled and  coarsened by that time. They are still susceptible to charm, and that  is about all."    
"Have you loved many women?" asked Betty, without preamble.    
He stood up and turned his back to the fire. Betty noted again how  squarely he planted himself on his feet. "A few," he said bluntly.  "Not many. I have not overworked my intuitive faculty, if that is what  you mean. I was not thinking of myself when I spoke."    
He stared down at her for a few moments, during which it seemed to  Betty that the air vibrated between them. Her breath began to shorten,  and she dropped her eyes, lest their depths reveal the spark which was  active enough in her.    
"Will you play for me?" he asked. "I lost a little girl a few years  ago who played well, although she was only sixteen. I have disliked  the piano ever since, but I should like to hear you play."    
She played to him for an hour, with tenderness, passion, and  brilliancy. A gift had been cultivated by the best masters and hours  of patient study.    
When he thanked her and rose to go and she put her hand in his, her  face expressed all the bright earnestness of genuine friendship; there  was not a sparkle of coquetry in her eyes.    
"Will you come in often on your way home when you are tired and would  like to forget bills and things, and let me play to you? I won't talk  --you must get so tired of voices!--and the practice will do me good."    
"Of course I will come. The pleasantest thing in life is a charming  woman's face at the close of a busy day. Good-bye."    
When he had gone, Betty got into the depths of a chair and covered her  eyes with her hand. For the first time she knew out of her own  experience that love means a greater want than the satisfaction of the  eye and mind. She would have given anything but her inherited ideals  of right and wrong if he had come back and taken her in his arms and  kissed her; and she loved him with adoration that he did not, that in  all probability he never would, that although he had the great  passions which stimulate all great brains, the inflexible honour which  his State had rewarded and never questioned for thirty-five years must  make short work of struggles with the ordinary temptations of man.    
As soon as a man awakens a woman's passions she begins to idealize him  and there is no limit to the virtues he will be made to carry. But let  a man be endowed by Nature with every noble and elevated attribute she  has in her power to bestow, if he lacks sensuality a woman will see  him in the clear cold light of reason. Betty Madison, having something  of the intuitive faculty, in addition to that knowledge of man which  any girl of twenty-seven who has had much love offered her must  possess, made fewer mistakes even in the thick of a throbbing brain  than most women make; the great danger she did not foresee until time  had accustomed her somewhat to the wonder of being able to love at  last, and Reason had resumed her place in a singularly clear and  logical mind.
