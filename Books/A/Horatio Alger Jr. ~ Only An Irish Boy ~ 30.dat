  Mrs. Preston was a cold woman, and was far from being a devoted  wife. She was too selfish for that supreme love which some women bestow  upon their husbands. Still, when Colonel Preston's lifeless form was  brought into the house, she did experience a violent shock. To have the  companion of nearly twenty years so unexpectedly taken away might well  touch the most callous, and so, for a few minutes, Mrs. Preston forgot  herself and thought of her husband.
  But this was not for long. The thought of her own selfish interests  came back, and in the midst of her apparent grief the question forced  itself upon her consideration, &#8220;Did my husband make a will?&#8221;
  Of course, she did not give utterance to this query. She knew what  was expected of her, and she was prudent enough to keep up appearances  before the neighbors, who poured into the house to offer their  sympathy. She received them with her cambric handkerchief pressed to  her eyes, from which, by dint of effort, she succeeded in squeezing a  few formal tears, and, while her bosom appeared to heave with emotion,  she was mentally calculating how much Colonel Preston had probably  left.
  &#8220;Shan't I stay with you, my dear Mrs. Preston?&#8221; said worthy Mrs.  Cameron, in a tone full of warm interest and sympathy.
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, in a low voice; &#8220;you are very kind,  but I would rather be left alone.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it must be so sad for you to be alone in your sorrow,&#8221; said her  neighbor.
  &#8220;No. I can bear sorrow better alone,&#8221; said the newly made widow.  &#8220;Perhaps I am peculiar, but I would prefer it.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you really wish it,&#8221; said the other, reluctantly.
  &#8220;Yes, I wish it. Thank you for your kind offer, but I know my own  feelings, and the presence of others would only increase my pain.&#8221;
  This was what she said to others who made the same offer. It did not  excite great surprise, for Mrs. Preston had never leaned upon anyone  for sympathy, nor was she ready with her sympathy when others were in  trouble. She was self-poised and self-contained, and, in fact, for this  reason was not popular with her neighbors. Still, in this her distress  they were ready to forget all this and extend the same cordial sympathy  which they would have done in other cases. There was but one person  whose company she did crave at this time and this was her son, Godfrey.  So, when Alfred Turner offered to go for him the next morning, she  accepted his offer with thanks.
  At last she was left alone. The servant had gone to bed, and there  was no one but herself and her dead husband in the lower part of the  house. She no longer sat with her handkerchief pressed before her eyes.  Her face wore its usual look of calm composure. She was busily  thinking, not of her husband's fate, but of her own future.
  &#8220;Did he leave a will? And, if so, how much did he leave me?&#8221; she  thought.
  If there was a will, it was probably in the house, and Mrs. Preston  determined to find it, if possible.
  &#8220;Of course, all ought to come to me and Godfrey,&#8221; she soliloquized.  &#8220;I don't think it is right to leave money to charitable institutions as  long as a wife and child are living. Fortunately, my husband had no  brothers or sisters, or perhaps he would have divided the property. If  there is no will, I shall have my thirds, and shall have the control of  Godfrey's property till he comes of age. I think I will go to Boston to  live. My friend, Mrs. Boynton, has a very pleasant house on Worcester  Street. I should like to settle down somewhere near her. I don't know  how much Mr. Preston was worth, but I am sure we shall have enough for  that. I always wanted to live in the city. This village is intolerably  stupid, and so are the people. I shall be glad to get away.&#8221;
  Could the good women, whose kind hearts had prompted them to proffer  their sympathy, have heard these words they would not have been likely  to obtrude any more on the hard, cold woman who held them in such low  estimation.
  Mrs. Preston took the lamp in her hand, and began to explore her  husband's desk. She had often thought of doing so, but, as his death  was not supposed to be so near, she had not thought that there was any  immediate cause of doing so. Besides, it had almost been her belief  that he had made no will. Now she began to open drawers and untie  parcels of papers, but it was some time before she came to what she  sought. At length, however, her diligence was rewarded. In the middle  of a pile of papers, she found one labeled on the outside:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MY WILL.
  Her heart beat as she opened it, and, though there was no need, for  it was now past ten o'clock, and there was not likely to be a caller at  that late hour, she looked cautiously about her, and even peered out of  the window into the darkness, but could find no one whose observation  she might fear.
  I am not about to recite at length the items in the will, which  covered a page of foolscap. It is enough to quote two items, which Mrs.  Preston read with anger and dissatisfaction. They are as follows:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Item.&#8212;To my young friend, Andy Burke, son of the widow <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burke, of this village, in consideration of a valuable <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service rendered to me on one occasion, and as a mark of my <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regard and interest, I give and bequeath the sum of five <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand dollars; and to his mother, as a token of gratitude <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for her faithful nursing when I was dangerously sick with the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smallpox, I give and bequeath, free of all incumbrance, the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cottage in which she at present resides.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Item.&#8212;To the town I give five thousand dollars, the <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest to be annually appropriated to the purchase of books <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a public library, for the benefit of all the citizens, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided the town will provide some suitable place in which <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep them.&#8221;
  All the balance of the property was left to his wife and son, in  equal proportions, his wife to be the guardian of Godfrey till he  should have attained his majority. As Colonel Preston was well known to  be rich, this seemed to be an adequate provision, but Mrs. Preston did  not look upon it in that light. On the contrary, she was deeply  incensed at the two legacies of which mention has been made above.
  &#8220;Was ever anything more absurd than to waste five thousand dollars  and a house upon that Irish boy and his mother?&#8221; she said to herself.  &#8220;I don't suppose it was so much my husband's fault. That artful woman  got around him, and wheedled him into it. I know now why she was so  willing to come here and take care of him when he was sick. She wanted  to wheedle him into leaving money to her low-lived boy. She is an  artful and designing hussy, and I should like to tell her so to her  face.&#8221;
  The cold and usually impassible woman was deeply excited. Her  selfish nature made her grudge any of her husband's estate to others,  except, indeed, to Godfrey, who was the only person she cared for. As  she thought over the unjust disposition, as she regarded it, which her  husband had made of his property, a red spot glowed in her usually pale  cheek.
  Then it was another grievance that money should have been left to  the town.
  &#8220;What claim had the town on my husband,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;that he  should give it five thousand dollars? In doing it, he was robbing  Godfrey and me. It was wrong. He had no right to do it. What do I care  for these people? They are a set of common farmers and mechanics, with  whom I condescend to associate because I have no one else here, except  the minister's and the doctor's family, to speak to. Soon I shall be in  the city, and then I don't care if I never set eyes on any of them  again. In Boston I can find suitable society.&#8221;
  The more Mrs. Preston thought of it, the more she felt aggravated by  the thought that so large a share of her husband's property was to go  to others. She fixed her eyes thoughtfully on the document which she  held in her hand, and a strong temptation came to her.
  &#8220;If this should disappear,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;the money would be  all mine and Godfrey's, and no one would be the wiser. That Irish boy  and his mother would stay where they belonged, and my Godfrey would  have his own. Why should I not burn it? It would only be just.&#8221;
  Deluding herself by this false view, she persuaded herself that it  was right to suppress the will. With steady hand she held it to the  flame of the lamp, and watched it as it was slowly consumed. Then,  gathering up the fragments, she threw them away.
  &#8220;It is all ours now,&#8221; she whispered, triumphantly, as she prepared  to go to bed. &#8220;It was lucky I found the will.&#8221;
