  Peter, thrust back from the door through which through which his   master had gone, listened vainly for the sound of returning  footsteps  in the beat of rain and the crash of thunder outside. A  strange thing  had burned itself into his soul, a thing that made  his flesh quiver  and set hot fires running in his blood. As a dog  sometimes senses the  stealthy approach of death, so he began to  sense the tragedy of this  night that had brought with it not only  a chaos of blackness and  storm, but an anguish which roused an  answering whimper in his throat  as he turned toward Nada. 
  She was crumpled with her head in her arms, where she had flung   herself with Jolly Roger's last kiss of worship on her lips, and  she  was sobbing like a child with its heart broken. And beside her  knelt  the old gray Missioner, man of God in the deep forest, who  stroked her  hair with his thin hand, whispering courage and  consolation to her,  with the wind and rain beating overhead and  the windows rattling to  the accompaniment of ghostly voices that  shrieked and wailed in the  tree-tops outside. 
  Peter trembled at the sobbing, but his heart and his desire were   with the man who had gone. In his unreasoning little soul it was  Jed  Hawkins who was rattling the windows with his unseen hands and  who was  pounding at the door with the wind, and who was filling  the black  night with its menace and fear. He hated this man, who  lay back in the  trail with his lifeless face turned up to the  deluge that poured out  of the sky. And he was afraid of the man,  even as he hated him, and he  believed that Nada was afraid of him,  and that because of her fear she  was crying there in the middle of  the floor, with Father John patting  her shoulder and stroking her  hair, and saying things to her which he  could not understand. He  wanted to go to her. He wanted to feel  himself close against her,  as Nada had held him so often in those  hours when she had  unburdened her grief and her unhappiness to him.  But even stronger  than this desire was the one to follow his master. 
  He went to the door, and thrust his nose against the crack at the   bottom of it. He felt the fierceness of the wind fighting to break   in, and the broken mist of it filled his nostrils. But there came  no  scent of Jolly Roger McKay. For a moment he struggled at the  crack  with his paws. Then he flopped himself down, his heart  beating fast,  and fixed his eyes inquiringly on Nada and the  Missioner. 
  His four and a half months of life in the big wilderness, and his   weeks of constant comradeship with Jolly Roger, had developed in  him  a brain that was older than his body. No process of reasoning  could  impinge upon him the fact that his master was an outlaw, but  with the  swift experiences of tragedy and hiding and never-ceasing  caution had  come instinctive processes which told him almost as  much as reason. He  knew something was wrong tonight. It was in the  air. He breathed it.  It thrilled in the crash of thunder, in the  lightning fire, in the  mighty hands of the wind rocking the cabin  and straining at the  windows. And vaguely the knowledge gripped  him that the dead man back  in the trail was responsible for it  all, and that because of this  something that had happened his  mistress was crying and his master was  gone. And he believed he  should also have gone with Jolly Roger into  the blackness and  mystery of the storm, to fight with him against the  one creature  in all the world he hated&#8212;the dead man who lay back in  the  thickness of gloom between the forest walls. 
  And the Missioner was saying to Nada, in a quiet, calm voice out   of which the tragedies of years had burned all excitement and   passion: 
  &quot;God will forgive him, my child. In His mercy He will forgive   Roger McKay, because he killed Jed Hawkins to save YOU. But man  will  not forgive. The law has been hunting him because he is an  outlaw, and  to outlawry he has added what the law will call  murder. But God will  not look at it in that way. He will look into  the heart of the man,  the man who sacrificed himself&#8212;&quot; 
  And then, fiercely, Nada struck up the Missioner's comforting   hand, and Peter saw her young face white as star-dust in the   lampglow. 
  &quot;I don't care what God thinks,&quot; she cried passionately. &quot;God   didn't do right today. Mister Roger told me everything, that he  was  an outlaw, an' I oughtn't to marry him. But I didn't care. I  loved  him. I could hide with him. An' we were coming to have you  marry us  tonight when God let Jed Hawkins drag me away, to sell me  to a man  over on the railroad&#8212;an' it was God who let Mister Roger  go back and  kill him. I tell you He didn't do right! He didn't&#8212;he  didn't&#8212;because  Mister Roger brought me the first happiness I ever  knew, an' I loved  him, an' he loved me&#8212;an' God was wicked to let  him kill Jed  Hawkins&#8212;&quot; 
  Her voice cried out, a woman's soul broken in a girl's body, and   Peter whimpered and watched the Missioner as he raised Nada to her   feet and went with her into his bedroom, where a few minutes  before  he had lighted a lamp. And Peter crept in quietly after  them, and when  the Missioner had gone and closed the door, leaving  them alone in  their tragedy, Nada seemed to see him for the first  time and slowly  she reached out her arms. 
  &quot;Peter!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;&quot; 
  In the minutes that followed, Peter could feel her heart beating.   Clutched against her breast he looked up at the white, beautiful   face, the trembling throat, the wide-open blue eyes staring at the   one black window between them and the outside night. A lull had  come  in the storm. It was quiet and ominous stillness, and the  ticking of a  clock, old and gray like the Missioner himself,  filled the room. And  Nada, seated on the edge of Father John's  bed, no longer looked like  the young girl of &quot;seventeen goin' on  eighteen.&quot; That afternoon, in  the hidden jackpine open, with its  sweet-scented jasmines, its violets  and its crimson strawberries  under their feet, the soul of a woman had  taken possession of her  body. In that hour the first happiness of her  life had come to  her. She had heard Jolly Roger McKay tell her those  things which  she already knew&#8212;that he was an outlaw, and that he was  hiding  down on the near-edge of civilization because the Royal Mounted   were after him farther north&#8212;and that he was not fit to love her,   and that it was a crime to let her love him. It was then the soul  of  the woman had come to her in all its triumph. She had made her  choice,  definitely and decisively, without hesitation and without  fear. And  now, as she stared unseeingly at the window against  which the rain was  beating, the woman in her girlish body rose in  her mightier than in  the hour of her happiness, fighting to find a  way&#8212;crying out for the  man she loved. 
  Her mind swept back in a single flash through all the years she   had lived, through her years of unhappiness and torment as the   foster-girl of Jed Hawkins and his broken, beaten wife; through   summers and winters that had seemed ages to her, eternities of   desolation, of heartache, of loneliness, with the big wilderness  her  one friend on earth. As the window rattled in a fresh blast of  storm,  she thought of the day months ago when she had accidentally  stumbled  upon the hiding-place of Roger McKay. Since that day he  had been her  God, and she had lived in a paradise. He had been  father, mother,  brother, and at last&#8212;what she most yearned for&#8212;a  lover to her. And  this day, when for the first time he had held  her in his arms, when  the happiness of all the earth had reached  out to them, God had put it  into Jed Hawkins' heart to destroy  her&#8212;and Jolly Roger had killed  him! 
  With a sharp little cry she sprang to her feet, so suddenly that   Peter fell with a thump to the floor. He looked up at her,  puzzled,  his jaws half agape. She was breathing quickly. Her  slender body was  quivering. Suddenly Peter saw the fire in her  eyes and the flame that  was rushing into her white cheeks. Then  she turned to him, and panted  in a wild little whisper, so low  that the Missioner could not hear: 
  &quot;Peter, I was wrong. God wasn't wicked to let Mister Roger kill   Jed Hawkins. He oughta been killed. An' God meant him to be  killed.  Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;we don't care if he's an outlaw! We're goin'  with him.  We're goin'&#8212;goin'&#8212;&quot; 
  She sprang to the window, and Peter was at her heels as she   strained at it with all her strength, and he could hear her  sobbing: 
  &quot;We're goin' with him, Peter. We're goin'&#8212;if we die for it!&quot; 
  An inch at a time she pried the window up. The storm beat in. A   gust of wind blew out the light, but in the last flare of it Nada  saw  a knife in an Eskimo sheath hanging on the wall. She groped  for it,  and clutched it in her hand as she climbed through the  window and  dropped to the soggy ground beneath. In a single leap  Peter followed  her. Blackness swallowed them as they turned toward  the trail leading  north&#8212;the only trail which Jolly Roger could  travel on a night like  this. They heard the voice of the Missioner  calling from the window  behind them. Then a crash of thunder set  the earth rolling under their  feet, and the lull in the storm came  to an end. The sky split open  with the vivid fire of lightning.  The trees wailed and whined, the  rain fell again in a smothering  deluge, and through it Nada ran,  gripping the knife as her one  defense against the demons of  darkness&#8212;and always close at her  side ran Peter. 
  He could not see her in that pitchy blackness, except when the   lightning flashes came. Then she was like a ghostly wraith, with   drenched clothes clinging to her until she seemed scarcely  dressed,  her wet hair streaming and her wide, staring eyes looking  straight  ahead. After the lightning flashes, when the world was  darkest, he  could hear the stumbling tread of her feet and the  panting of her  breath, and now and then the swish of brush as it  struck across her  face and breast. The rain had washed away the  scent of his master's  feet but he knew they were following Jolly  Roger, and that the girl  was running to overtake him. In him was  the desire to rush ahead, to  travel faster through the night, but  Nada's stumbling feet and her  panting breath and the strange white  pictures he saw of her when the  sky split open with fire held him  back. Something told him that Nada  must reach Jolly Roger. And he  was afraid she would stop. He wanted to  bark to give her  encouragement, as he had often barked in their  playful races in  the green plain-lands on the farther side of Cragg's  Ridge. But  the rain choked him. It beat down upon him with the weight  of  heavy hands, it slushed up into his face from pools in the trail   and drove the breath from him when he attempted to open his jaws.  So  he ran close&#8212;so close that at times Nada felt the touch of his  body  against her. 
  In these first minutes of her fight to overtake the man she loved   Nada heard but one voice&#8212;a voice crying out from her heart and  brain  and soul, a voice rising above the tumult of thunder and  wind, urging  her on, whipping the strength from her frail body in  pitiless  exhortation. Jolly Roger was less than half an hour ahead  of her. And  she must overtake him&#8212;quickly&#8212;before the forests  swallowed him,  before he was gone from her life forever. 
  The wall of blackness against which she ran did not frighten her.   When the brush tore at her face and hair she swung free of it, and   stumbled on. Twice she ran blindly into broken trees that lay  across  her path, and dragged her bruised body through their  twisted tops,  moaning to Peter and clutching tightly to the  sheathed knife in her  hand. And the wild spirits that possessed  the night seemed to gather  about her, and over her, exulting in  the helplessness of their victim,  shrieking in weird and savage  joy at the discovery of this human  plaything struggling against  their might. Never had Peter heard  thunder as he heard it now. It  rocked the earth under his feet. It  filled the world with a  ceaseless rumble, and the lightning came like  flashes from swift-  loading guns, and with it all a terrific assault  of wind and rain  that at last drove Nada down in a crumpled heap,  panting for  breath, with hands groping out wildly for him. 
  Peter came to them, sodden and shivering. His warm tongue found   the palm of her hand, and for a space Nada hugged him close to  her,  while she bowed her head until her drenched curls became a  part of the  mud and water of the trail. Peter could hear her  sobbing for breath.  And then suddenly, there came a change. The  thunder was sweeping  eastward. The lightning was going with it.  The wind died out in  wailing sobs among the treetops, and the rain  fell straight down.  Swiftly as its fury had come, the July storm  was passing. And Nada  staggered to her feet again and went on. 
  Her mind began to react with the lessening of the storm, dragging   itself out quickly from under the oppression of fear and shock.  She  began to reason, and with that reason the beginning of faith  and  confidence gave her new strength. She knew that Jolly Roger  would take  this trail, for it was the one trail leading from the  Missioner's  cabin through the thick forest country north. And in  half an hour he  would not travel far. The thrilling thought came  to her that possibly  he had sought shelter in the lee of a big  tree trunk during the fury  of the storm. If he had done that he  would be near, very near. She  paused in the trail and gathered her  breath, and cried out his name.  Three times she called it, and  only the low whine in Peter's throat  came in answer. Twice again  during the next ten minutes she cried out  as loudly as she could  into the darkness. And still no answer came  back to her through  the gloom ahead. 
  The trail had dipped, and she felt the deepening slush of swamp-   mire under her feet. She sank in it to her shoe-tops, and stumbled   into pools knee-deep, and Peter wallowed in it to his belly. A   quarter of an hour they fought through it to the rising ground   beyond. And by that time the last of the black storm clouds had   passed overhead. The rain had ceased. The rumble of thunder came  more  faintly. There was no lightning, and the tree-tops began to  whisper  softly, as if rejoicing in the passing of the wind. About   them&#8212;everywhere&#8212;they could hear the run and drip of water, the   weeping of the drenched trees, the gurgle of flooded pools, and  the  trickle of tiny rivulets that splashed about their feet.  Through a  rift in the breaking clouds overhead came a passing  flash of the moon. 
  &quot;We'll find him now, Peter,&quot; moaned the girl. &quot;We'll find him&#8212;   now. He can't be very far ahead&#8212;&quot; 
  And Peter waited, holding his breath, listening for an answer to   the cry that went out for Jolly Roger McKay. 
  The glory of July midnight, with a round, full moon straight   overhead, followed the stress of storm. The world had been lashed  and  inundated, every tree whipped of its rot and slag, every blade  of  grass and flower washed clean. Out of the earth rose sweet  smells of  growing life, the musky fragrance of deep moss and  needle-mold, and  through the clean air drifted faintly the aroma  of cedar and balsam  and the subtle tang of unending canopies and  glistening tapestries of  evergreen breathing into the night. The  deep forest seemed to tremble  with the presence of an invisible  and mysterious life&#8212;life that was  still, yet wide-awake,  breathing, watchful, drinking in the  rejuvenating tonic of the air  which had so quietly followed thunder  and lightning and the roar  of wind and rain. And the moon, like a  queen who had so ordered  these things, looked down in a mighty  triumph. Her radiance,  without dust or fog or forest-smoke to impede  its way, was like  the mellow glow of half-day. It streamed through the  treetops in  paths of gold and silver, throwing dark shadows where it  failed to  penetrate, and gathering in wide pools where its floods  poured  through broad rifts in the roofs of the forest. And the trail,   leading north, was like a river of shimmering silver, splitting  the  wilderness from earth to sky. 
  In this trail, clearly made in the wet soil, were Jolly Roger's   foot-prints, and in a wider space, where at some time a trapper  had  cleared himself a spot for his tepee or shack, Jolly Roger had  paused  to rest after his fight through the storm&#8212;and had then  continued on  his way. And into this clearing, three hours after  they left the  Missioner's cabin, came Nada and Peter. 
  They came slowly, the girl a slim wraith in the moon-light; in the   open they stood for a moment, and Peter's heart weighed heavily   within him as his mistress cried out once more for Jolly Roger.  Her  voice rose only in a sob, and ended in a sob. The last of her  strength  was gone. Her little figure swayed, and her face was  white and  haggard, and in her drawn lips and staring eyes was the  agony of  despair. She had lost, and she knew that she had lost as  she crumpled  down in the trail, crying out sobbingly to the  footprints which led so  clearly ahead of her. 
  &quot;Peter, I can't go on,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I can't&#8212;go on&#8212;&quot; 
  Her hands clutched at her breast. Peter saw the glint of the   moonlight on the ivory sheath of the Eskimo knife, and he saw her   white face turned up to the sky&#8212;and also that her lips were  moving,  but he did not hear his name come from them, or any other  sound. He  whined, and foot by foot began to nose along the trail  on the scent  left by Jolly Roger. It was very clear to his  nostrils, and it  thrilled him. He looked back, and again he whined  his encouragement to  the girl. 
  &quot;Peter!&quot; she called. &quot;Peter!&quot; 
  He returned to her. She had drawn the knife out of its scabbard,   and the cold steel glistened in her hand. Her eyes were shining,  and  she reached out and clutched Peter close up against her, so  that he  could hear the choke and throb of her heart. 
  &quot;Oh, Peter, Peter,&quot; she panted. &quot;If you could only talk! If you   could run and catch Mister Roger, an' tell him I'm here, an' that  he  must come back&#8212;&quot; 
  She hugged him closer. He sensed the sudden thrill that leapt   through her body. 
  &quot;Peter,&quot; she whispered, &quot;will you do it?&quot; 
  For a few moments she did not seem to breathe. Then he heard a   quick little cry, a sob of inspiration and hope, and her arms came   from about him, and he saw the knife flashing in the yellow   moonlight. 
  He did not understand, but he knew that he must watch her   carefully. She had bent her head, and her hair, nearly dry, glowed   softly in the face of the moon. Her hands were fumbling in the   disheveled curls, and Peter saw the knife flash back and forth,  and  heard the cut of it, and then he saw that in her hand she held  a thick  brown tress of hair that she had severed from her head. He  was  puzzled. And Nada dropped the knife, and his curiosity  increased when  she tore a great piece out of her tattered dress,  and carefully  wrapped the tress of hair in it. Then she drew him  to her again, and  tied the knotted fold of dress securely about  his neck; after that she  tore other strips from her dress, and  wound them about his neck until  he felt muffled and half  smothered. 
  And all the time she was talking to him in a half sobbing, excited   little voice, and the blood in Peter's body ran swifter, and the   strange thrill in him was greater. When she had finished she rose  to  her feet, and stood there swaying back and forth, like one of  the  spruce-top shadows, while she pointed up the moonlit trail. 
  &quot;Go, Peter!&quot; she cried softly. &quot;Quick! Follow him, Peter&#8212;catch   him&#8212;bring him back! Mister Roger&#8212;Jolly Roger&#8212;go, Peter! Go&#8212;go   &#8212;go&#8212;&quot; 
  It was strange to Peter. But he was beginning to understand. He   sniffed in Jolly Roger's footprints, and then he looked up  quickly,  and saw that it had pleased the girl. She was urging him  on. He  sniffed from one footprint to another, and Nada clapped her  hands and  cried out that he was right&#8212;for him to hurry&#8212;hurry&#8212; 
  Impulse, thought, swiftly growing knowledge of something to be   done thrilled in his brain. Nada wanted him to go. She wanted him  to  go to Jolly Roger. And she had put something around his neck  which she  wanted him to take with him. He whined eagerly, a bit  excitedly. Then  he began to trot. Instinctively it was his test.  She did not call him  back. He flattened his ears, listening for  her command to return, but  it did not come. And then the thrill in  him leapt over all other  things. He was right. He was not  abandoning Nada. He was not running  away. She WANTED him to go! 
  The night swallowed him. He became a part of the yellow floods of   its moonlight, a part of its shifting shadows, a part of its   stillness, its mystery, its promise of impending things. He knew  that  grim and terrible happenings had come with the storm, and he  still  sensed the nearness of tragedy in this night-world through  which he  was passing. He did not go swiftly, yet he went three  times as fast as  the girl and he had traveled together. He was  cautious and watchful,  and at intervals he stopped and listened,  and swallowed hard to keep  the whine of eagerness out of his  throat. Now that he was alone every  instinct in him was keyed to  the pulse and beat of life about him. He  knew the Night People of  the deep forests were awake. Softly padded,  clawed, sharp-beaked  and feathered&#8212;the prowlers of darkness were on  the move. With the  stillness of shadows they were stealing through the  moonlit  corridors of the wilderness, or hovering gray-winged and  ghostly  in the ambuscades of the treetops, eager to waylay and kill,   hungering for the flesh and blood of creatures weaker than   themselves. Peter knew. Both heritage and experience warned him.  And  he watched the shadows, and sniffed the air, and kept his  fangs half  bared and ready as he followed the trail of McKay. 
  He was not stirred by the impulse of adventure alone. Without the   finesse of what man might charitably call reason in a beast, he  had  sensed a responsibility. It was present in the closely drawn  strips of  faded cloth about his neck. It was, in a way, a part of  the girl  herself, a part of her flesh and blood, a part of her   spirit&#8212;something vital to her and dependent upon him. He was  ready  to guard it with every instinct of caution and every ounce  of courage  there was in him. And to protect it meant to fight.  That was the first  law of his breed, the primal warning which came  to him through the red  blood of many generations of wilderness  forefathers. So he listened,  and he watched, and his blood pounded  hot in his veins as he followed  the footprints in the trail. A bit  of brush, swinging suddenly free  from where it had been prisoned  by the storm, drew a snarl from him as  he faced the sound with the  quickness of a cat. A gray streak, passing  swiftly over the trail  ahead of him, stirred a low growl in his  throat. It was a lynx,  and for a space Peter paused, and then sped  soft-footed past the  moon-lit spot where the stiletto-clawed menace of  the woods had  passed. 
  Now that he was alone, and no longer accompanied by a human   presence whose footsteps and scent held the wild things aloof and   still, Peter felt nearer and nearer to him the beat and stir of  life.  Powerful beaks, instead of remaining closed and without  sound, snapped  and hissed at him as the big gray owls watched his  passing. He heard  the rustling of brush, soft as the stir of a  woman's dress, where  living things were secretly moving, and he  heard the louder crash of  clumsy and piggish feet, and caught the  strong scent of a porcupine as  it waddled to its midnight lunch of  poplar bark. Then the trail ended,  and Jolly Roger's scent led  into the pathless forest, with its  shifting streams and pools of  moonlight, its shadows and black pits of  darkness. And here&#8212;now&#8212;  Peter began his trespass into the  strongholds of the People of the  Night. He heard a wolf howl, a cry  filled with loneliness, yet  with a shivering death-note in it; he  caught the musky, skunkish  odor of a fox that was stalking prey in the  face of a whispering  breath of wind; once, in a moment of dead  stillness, he listened  to the snap of teeth and the crackle of bones  in one of the dark  pits, where a fisher-cat&#8212;with eyes that gleamed  like coals of  fire&#8212;was devouring the warm and bleeding carcass of a  mother  partridge. And beaks snapped at him more menacingly as he went  on,  and gray shapes floated over his head, and now and then he heard   the cries of dying things&#8212;the agonized squeak of a wood-mouse,  the  cry of a day-bird torn from its sleeping place by a sinuous,   beady-eyed creature of fur and claw, the noisy screaming of a  rabbit  swooped upon and pierced to the vitals by one of the gray-  feathered  pirates of the air. And then, squarely in the center of  a great pool  of moonlight, Peter came upon a monster. It was a  bear, a huge mother  bear, with two butter-fat cubs wrestling and  rolling in the moon glow.  Peter had never seen a bear. But the  mother, who raised her brown nose  suddenly from the cool mold out  of which she had been digging  lily-bulbs, had seen dogs. She had  seen many dogs, and she had heard  their howl, and she knew that  always they traveled with man. She gave  a deep, chesty sniff, and  close after that sniff a WHOOF that startled  the cubs like the  lashing end of a whip. They rolled to her, and with  two cuffs of  the mother's huge paws they were headed in the right  direction,  and all three crashed off into darkness. 
  In spite of his swelling heart Peter let out a little yip. It was   a great satisfaction, just at a moment when his nerves were  getting  unsteady, to discover that a monster like this one in the  moonlight  was anxious to run away from him. And Peter went on, a  bit of pride  and jauntiness in his step, his bony tail a little  higher. 
  A mile farther on, in another yellow pool of the moon, lay the   partly devoured carcass of a fawn. A wolf had killed it, and had  fed,  and now two giant owls were rending and tearing in the flesh  and  bowels of what the wolf had left. They were Gargantuans of  their kind,  one a male, the other a female. Their talons warm in  blood, their  beaks red, their slow brains drunk with a ravenous  greed, they rose on  their great wings in sullen rage when Peter  came suddenly upon them.  He had ceased to be afraid of owls. There  was something shivery in the  gritting of their beaks, especially  in the dark places, but they had  never attacked him, and had  always kept out of his reach. So their  presence in a black spruce  top directly over the dead fawn did not  hold him back now. He  sniffed at the fresh, sweet meat, and hunger all  at once possessed  him. Where the wolf had stripped open a tender flank  he began to  eat, and as he ate he growled, so that warning of his   possessorship reached the spruce top. 
  In answer to it came a stir of wings, and the male owl launched   himself out into the moon glow. The female followed. For a few   moments they floated like gray ghosts over Peter, silent as the  night  shadows. Then, with the suddenness and speed of a bolt from  a  catapult, the giant male shot out of a silvery mist of gloom and   struck Peter. The two rolled over the carcass of the fawn, and for  a  space Peter was dazed by the thundering beat of powerful wings,  and  the hammering of the owl's beak at the back of his neck. The  male had  missed his claw-hold, and driven by rage and ferocity,  fought to  impale his victim from the ground, without launching  himself into the  air again. Swiftly he struck, again and again,  while his wings beat  like clubs. Suddenly his talons sank into the  cloth wrapped about  Peter's neck. Terror and shock gave way to a  fighting madness inside  Peter now. He struck up, and buried his  fangs in a mass of feathers so  thick he could not feel the flesh.  He tore at the padded breast,  snarling and beating with his feet,  and then, as the stiletto-points  of the owl's talons sank through  the cloth into his neck, his jaws  closed on one of the huge bird's  legs. His teeth sank deep, there was  a snapping and grinding of  tendon and bone, and a hissing squawk of  pain and fear came from  above him as the owl made a mighty effort to  launch himself free.  As the five-foot pinions beat the air Peter was  lifted from the  ground. But the owl's talons were hopelessly entangled  in the  cloth, and the two fell in a heap again. Peter scarcely sensed   what happened after that, except that he was struggling against   death. He closed his eyes, and the leg between his jaws was broken   and twisted into pulp. The wings beat about him in a deafening   thunder, and the owl's beak tore at his flesh, until the pool of   moonlight in which they fought was red with blood. At last  something  gave way. There was a ghastly cry that was like the cry  of neither  bird nor beast, a weak flutter of wings, and Gargantua  of the Air  staggered up into the treetops and fell with a crash  among the thick  boughs of the spruce. 
  Peter raised himself weakly, the severed leg of the owl dropping   from his jaws. He was half blinded. Every muscle in his body  seemed  to be torn and bleeding, yet in his discomfort the  thrilling  conviction came to him that he had won. He tensed  himself for another  attack, hugging the ground closely as he  watched and waited, but no  attack came. He could hear the flutter  and wheeze of his maimed  adversary, and slowly he drew himself  back&#8212;still facing the scene of  battle&#8212;until in a farther patch  of gloom he turned once more to his  business of following the  trail of Jolly Roger McKay. 
  There was no mark of bravado in his advance now. If he had   possessed an over-growing confidence, Gargantua's attack had set  it  back, and he stole like a shifty fox through the night. Driven  into  his brain was the knowledge that all things were not afraid  of him,  for even the snapping beaks and floating gray shapes to  which he had  paid but little attention had now become a deadly  menace. His egoism  had suffered a jolt, a healthful reaction from  its too swift  ascendency. He sensed the narrowness of his escape  without the mental  action of reasoning it out, and his injuries  were secondary to the  oppressive horror of the uncanny combat out  of which he had come  alive. Yet this horror was not a fear.  Heretofore he had recognized  the ghostly owl-shapes of night more  or less as a curious part of  darkness, inspiring neither like nor  dislike in him. Now he hated  them, and ever after his fangs  gleamed white when one of them floated  over his head. 
  He was badly hurt. There were ragged tears in his flank and back,   and a last stroke of Gargantua's talons had stabbed his shoulder  to  the bone. Blood dripped from him, and one of his eyes was  closing, so  that shapes and shadows were grotesquely dim in the  night. Instinct  and caution, and the burning pains in his body,  urged him to lie down  in a thicket and wait for the day. But  stronger than these were memory  of the girl's urging voice, the  vague thrill of the cloth still about  his neck, and the freshness  of Jolly Roger's trail as it kept straight  on through the forest's  moonlit corridors and caverns of gloom. 
  It was in the first graying light of July dawn that Peter dragged   himself up the rough side of a ridge and looked down into a narrow   strip of plain on the other side. Just as Nada had given up in   weakness and despair, so now he was almost ready to quit. He had   traveled miles since the owl fight, and his wounds had stiffened,  and  with every step gave him excruciating pain. His injured eye  was  entirely closed, and there was a strange, dull ache in the  back of his  head, where Gargantua had pounded him with his beak.  The strip of  valley, half hidden in its silvery mist of dawn,  seemed a long  distance away to Peter, and he dropped on his belly  and began to lick  his raw shoulder with a feverish tongue. He was  sick and tired, and  the futility of going farther oppressed him.  He looked again down into  the strip of plain, and whined. 
  Then, suddenly, he smelled something that was not the musty fog-   mist that hung between the ridges. It was smoke. Peter's heart  beat  faster, and he pulled himself to his feet, and went in its  direction. 
  Hidden in a little grassy cup between two great boulders that   thrust themselves out from the face of the ridge, he found Jolly   Roger. First he saw the smouldering embers of a fire that was  almost  out&#8212;and then his master. Jolly Roger was asleep. Storm-  beaten and  strangely haggard and gray his face was turned to the  sky. Peter did  not awaken him. There was something in his master's  face that quieted  the low whimper in his throat. Very gently he  crept to him, and lay  down. The movement, slight as it was, made  the man stir. His hand  rose, and then fell limply across Peter's  body. But the fingers moved. 
  Unconsciously, as if guided by the spirit and prayer of the girl   waiting far back in the forest, they twined about the cloth around   Peter's neck&#8212;his message to his master. 
  And for a long time after that, as the sun rose over a wonderful   world, Peter and his master slept.
