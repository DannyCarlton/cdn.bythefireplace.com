  It is doubtful whether in the few moments that followed, any   clear-cut mental argument passed through Neewa's head. It is too  much  to suppose that he deliberately set about assisting the half-  dead and  almost unconscious Miki from his precarious position. His  sole  ambition was to get himself where it was safe and dry, and to  do this  he of necessity had to drag the pup with him. So Neewa  tugged at the  end of his rope, digging his sharp little claws into  the driftwood,  and as he advanced Miki was dragged up head  foremost out of the cold  and friendless stream. It was a simple  process. Neewa reached a log  around which the water was eddying,  and there he flattened himself  down and hung on as he had never  hung to anything else in his life.  The log was entirely hidden  from shore by a dense growth of brushwood.  Otherwise, ten minutes  later Challoner would have seen them. 
  As it was, Miki had not sufficiently recovered either to smell or   hear his master when Challoner came to see if there was a  possibility  of his small comrade being alive. And Neewa only  hugged the log more  tightly. He had seen enough of the man-beast  to last him for the  remainder of his life. It was half an hour  before Miki began to gasp,  and cough, and gulp up water, and for  the first time since their scrap  in the canoe the cub began to  take a live interest in him. In another  ten minutes Miki raised  his head and looked about him. At that Neewa  gave a tug on the  rope, as if to advise him that it was time to get  busy if they  were expected to reach shore. And Miki, drenched and  forlorn,  resembling more a starved bone than a thing of skin and  flesh,  actually made an effort to wag his tail when he saw Neewa. 
  He was still in a couple of inches of water, and with a hopeful   eye on the log upon which Neewa was squatted he began to work his   wobbly legs toward it. It was a high log, and a dry log, and when   Miki reached it his unlucky star was with him again. Cumbrously he   sprawled himself against it, and as he scrambled and scraped with  his  four awkward legs to get up alongside Neewa he gave to the log  the  slight push which it needed to set it free of the sunken  driftage.  Slowly at first the eddying current carried one end of  the log away  from its pier. Then the edge of the main current  caught at it,  viciously&#8212;and so suddenly that Miki almost lost his  precarious  footing, the log gave a twist, righted itself, and  began, to scud down  stream at a speed that would have made  Challoner hug his breath had he  been in their position with his  faithful canoe. 
  In fact, Challoner was at this very moment portaging the rapids   below the waterfall. To have set his canoe in them where Miki and   Neewa were gloriously sailing he would have considered an  inexcusable  hazard, and as a matter of safety he was losing the  better part of a  couple of hours by packing his outfit through the  forest to a point  half a mile below. That half mile was to the cub  and the pup a show  which was destined to live in their memories  for as long as they were  alive. 
  They were facing each other about amidships of the log, Neewa   flattened tight, his sharp claws dug in like hooks, and his little   brown eyes half starting from his head. It would have taken a  crowbar  to wrench him from the log. But with Miki it was an open  question from  the beginning whether he would weather the storm. He  had no claws that  he could dig into the wood, and it was  impossible for him to use his  clumsy legs as Neewa used his&#8212;like  two pairs of human arms. All he  could do was to balance himself,  slipping this way or that as the log  rolled or swerved in its  course, sometimes lying across it and  sometimes lengthwise, and  every moment with the jaws of uncertainty  open wide for him.  Neewa's eyes never left him for an instant. Had  they been gimlets  they would have bored holes. From the acuteness of  this life-and-  death stare one would have given Neewa credit for  understanding  that his own personal safety depended not so much upon  his claws  and his hug as upon Miki's seamanship. If Miki went  overboard  there would be left but one thing for him to do&#8212;and that  would be  to follow. 
  The log, being larger and heavier at one end than at the other,   swept on without turning broadside, and with the swiftness and   appearance of a huge torpedo. While Neewa's back was turned toward   the horror of frothing water and roaring rock behind him, Miki,  who  was facing it, lost none of its spectacular beauty. Now and  then the  log shot into one of the white masses of foam and for an  instant or  two would utterly disappear; and at these intervals  Miki would hold  his breath and close his eyes while Neewa dug his  toes in still  deeper. Once the log grazed a rock. Six inches more  and they would  have been without a ship. Their trip was not half  over before both cub  and pup looked like two round balls of lather  out of which their eyes  peered wildly. 
  Swiftly the roar of the cataract was left behind; the huge rocks   around which the current boiled and twisted with a ferocious  snarling  became fewer; there came open spaces in which the log  floated smoothly  and without convulsions, and then, at last, the  quiet and placid flow  of calm water. Not until then did the two  balls of suds make a move.  For the first time Neewa saw the whole  of the thing they had passed  through, and Miki, looking down  stream, saw the quiet shores again,  the deep forest, and the  stream aglow with the warm sun. He drew in a  breath that filled  his whole body and let it out again with a sigh of  relief so deep  and sincere that it blew out a scatter of foam from the  ends of  his nose and whiskers. For the first time he became conscious  of  his own discomfort. One of his hind legs was twisted under him,   and a foreleg was under his chest. The smoothness of the water and   the nearness of the shores gave him confidence, and he proceeded  to  straighten himself. Unlike Neewa he was an experienced  VOYAGEUR. For  more than a month he had travelled steadily with  Challoner in his  canoe, and of ordinarily decent water he was  unafraid. So he perked up  a little, and offered Neewa a  congratulatory yip that was half a  whine. 
  But Neewa's education had travelled along another line, and while   his experience in a canoe had been confined to that day he did  know  what a log was. He knew from more than one adventure of his  own that a  log in the water is the next thing to a live thing, and  that its  capacity for playing evil jokes was beyond any  computation that he had  ever been able to make. That was where  Miki's store of knowledge was  fatally defective. Inasmuch as the  log had carried them safely through  the worst stretch of water he  had ever seen he regarded it in the  light of a first-class canoe&#8212;  with the exception that it was  unpleasantly rounded on top. But  this little defect did not worry him.  To Neewa's horror he sat up  boldly, and looked about him. 
  Instinctively the cub hugged the log still closer, while Miki was   seized with an overwhelming desire to shake from himself the mass  of  suds in which, with the exception of the end of his tail and  his eyes,  he was completely swathed. He had often shaken himself  in the canoe;  why not here? Without either asking or answering the  question he did  it. 
  Like the trap of a gibbet suddenly sprung by the hangman, the log   instantly responded by turning half over. Without so much as a  wail  Miki was off like a shot, hit the water with a deep and  solemn CHUG,  and once more disappeared as completely as if he had  been made of  lead. 
  Finding himself completely submerged for the first time, Neewa   hung on gloriously, and when the log righted itself again he was   tenaciously hugging his old place, all the froth washed from him.  He  looked for Miki&#8212;but Miki was gone. And then he felt once more  that  choking drag on his neck! Of necessity, because his head was  pulled in  the direction of the rope, he saw where the rope  disappeared in the  water. But there was no Miki. The pup was down  too far for Neewa to  see. With the drag growing heavier and  heavier&#8212;for here there was not  much current to help Miki along&#8212;  Neewa hung on like grim death. If he  had let go, and had joined  Miki in the water, the good fortune which  was turning their way  would have been missed. For Miki, struggling  well under water, was  serving both as an anchor and a rudder; slowly  the log shifted its  course, was caught in a beach-eddy, and drifted in  close to a  muddy bank. 
  With one wild leap Neewa was ashore. Feeling the earth under his   feet he started to run, and the result was that Miki came up  slowly  through the mire and spread himself out like an overgrown  crustacean  while he got the wind back into his lungs. Neewa,  sensing the fact  that for a few moments his comrade was physically  unfit for travel,  shook himself, and waited. Miki picked up  quickly. Within five minutes  he was on his feet shaking himself so  furiously that Neewa became the  centre of a shower of mud and  water. 
  Had they remained where they were, Challoner would have found them   an hour or so later, for he paddled that way, close inshore,  looking  for their bodies. It may be that the countless generations  of instinct  back of Neewa warned him of that possibility, for  within a quarter of  an hour after they had landed he was leading  the way into the forest,  and Miki was following. It was a new  adventure for the pup. 
  But Neewa began to recover his good cheer. For him the forest was   home even if his mother was missing. After his maddening  experiences  with Miki and the man-beast the velvety touch of the  soft pine-needles  under his feet and the familiar smells of the  silent places filled him  with a growing joy. He was back in his  old trails. He sniffed the air  and pricked up his ears, thrilled  by the enlivening sensations of  knowing that he was once more the  small master of his own destiny. It  was a new forest, but Neewa  was undisturbed by this fact. All forests  were alike to him,  inasmuch as several hundred thousand square miles  were included in  his domain and it was impossible for him to landmark  them all. 
  With Miki it was different. He not only began to miss Challoner   and the river, but became more and more disturbed the farther  Neewa  led him into the dark and mysterious depths of the timber.  At last he  decided to set up a vigorous protest, and in line with  this decision  he braced himself so suddenly that Neewa, coming to  the end of the  rope, flopped over on his back with an astonished  grunt. Seizing his  advantage Miki turned, and tugging with the  horse-like energy of his  Mackenzie father he started back toward  the river, dragging Neewa  after him for a space of ten or fifteen  feet before the cub succeeded  in regaining his feet. 
  Then the battle began. With their bottoms braced and their   forefeet digging into the soft earth, they pulled on the rope in   opposite directions until their necks stretched and their eyes  began  to pop. Neewa's pull was steady and unexcited, while Miki,  dog-like,  yanked and convulsed himself in sudden backward jerks  that made Neewa  give way an inch at a time. It was, after all,  only a question as to  which possessed the most enduring neck.  Under Neewa's fat there was as  yet little real physical strength.  Miki had him handicapped there.  Under the pup's loose hide and his  overgrown bones there was a lot of  pull, and after bracing himself  heroically for another dozen feet  Neewa gave up the contest and  followed in the direction chosen by  Miki. 
  While the instincts of Neewa's breed would have taken him back to   the river as straight as a die, Miki's intentions were better than   was his sense of orientation. Neewa followed in a sweeter temper  when  he found that his companion was making an unreasonable circle  which  was taking them a little more slowly, but just as surely,  away from  the danger-ridden stream. At the end of another quarter  of an hour  Miki was utterly lost; he sat down on his rump, looked  at Neewa, and  confessed as much&#8212;with a low whine. Neewa did not  move. His sharp  little eyes were fixed suddenly on an object that  hung to a low bush  half a dozen paces from them. Before the man-  beast's appearance the  cub had spent three quarters of his time in  eating, but since  yesterday morning he had not swallowed so much  as a bug. He was  completely empty, and the object he saw hanging  to the bush set every  salivary gland in his mouth working. It was  a wasp's nest. Many times  in his young life he had seen Noozak,  his mother, go up to nests like  that, tear them down, crush them  under her big paw, and then invite  him to the feast of dead wasps  within. For at least a month wasps had  been included in his daily  fare, and they were as good as anything he  knew of. He approached  the nest; Miki followed. When they were within  three feet of it  Miki began to take notice of a very distinct and  peculiarly  disquieting buzzing sound. Neewa was not at all alarmed;  judging  the distance of the nest from the ground, he rose on his hind   feet, raised his arms, and gave it a fatal tug. 
  Instantly the drone which Miki had heard changed into the angry   buzzing of a saw. Quick as a flash Neewa's mother would have had  the  nest under her paws and the life crushed out of it, while  Neewa's tug  had only served partly to dislodge the home of Ahmoo  and his dangerous  tribe. And it happened that Ahmoo was at home  with three quarters of  his warriors. Before Neewa could give the  nest a second tug they were  piling out of it in a cloud and  suddenly a wild yell of agony rose out  of Miki. Ahmoo himself had  landed on the end of the dog's nose. Neewa  made no sound, but  stood for a moment swiping at his face with both  paws, while Miki,  still yelling, ran the end of his crucified nose  into the ground.  In another moment every fighter in Ahmoo's army was  busy. Suddenly  setting up a bawling on his own account Neewa turned  tail to the  nest and ran. Miki was not a hair behind him. In every  square inch  of his tender hide he felt the red-hot thrust of a needle.  It was  Neewa that made the most noise. His voice was one continuous  bawl,  and to this bass Miki's soprano wailing added the touch which   would have convinced any passing Indian that the loup-garou devils   were having a dance. 
  Now that their foes were in disorderly flight the wasps, who are   rather a chivalrous enemy, would have returned to their upset   fortress had not Miki, in his mad flight, chosen one side of a  small  sapling and Neewa the other&#8212;a misadventure that stopped  them with a  force almost sufficient to break their necks.  Thereupon a few dozen of  Ahmoo's rear guard started in afresh.  With his fighting blood at last  aroused, Neewa swung out and  caught Miki where there was almost no  hair on his rump. Already  half blinded, and so wrought up with pain  and terror that he had  lost all sense of judgment or understanding,  Miki believed that  the sharp dig of Neewa's razor-like claws was a  deeper thrust than  usual of the buzzing horrors that overwhelmed him,  and with a  final shriek he proceeded to throw a fit. 
  It was the fit that saved them. In his maniacal contortions he   swung around to Neewa's side of the sapling, when, with their  halter  once more free from impediment, Neewa bolted for safety.  Miki  followed, yelping at every jump. No longer did Neewa feel a  horror of  the river. The instinct of his kind told him that he  wanted water, and  wanted it badly. As straight as Challoner might  have set his course by  a compass he headed for the stream, but he  had proceeded only a few  hundred feet when they came upon a tiny  creek across which either of  them could have jumped. Neewa jumped  into the water, which was four or  five inches deep, and for the  first time in his life Miki voluntarily  took a plunge. For a long  time they lay in the cooling rill. 
  The light of day was dim and hazy before Miki's eyes, and he was   beginning to swell from the tip of his nose to the end of his bony   tail. Neewa, being so much fat, suffered less. He could still see,   and, as the painful hours passed, a number of things were  adjusting  themselves in his brain. All this had begun with the  man-beast. It was  the man-beast who had taken his mother from him.  It was the man-beast  who had chucked him into the dark sack, and  it was the man-beast who  had FASTENED THE ROPE AROUND HIS NECK.  Slowly the fact was beginning  to impinge itself upon him that the  rope was to blame for everything. 
  After a long time they dragged themselves out of the rivulet and   found a soft, dry hollow at the foot of a big tree. Even to Neewa,   who had the use of his eyes, it was growing dark in the deep  forest.  The sun was far in the west. And the air was growing  chilly. Flat on  his belly, with his swollen head between his fore  paws, Miki whined  plaintively. 
  Again and again Neewa's eyes went to the rope as the big thought   developed itself in his head. He whined. It was partly a yearning  for  his mother, partly a response to Miki. He drew closer to the  pup,  filled with the irresistible desire for comradeship. After  all, it was  not Miki who was to blame. It was the man-beast&#8212;and  THE ROPE! 
  The gloom of evening settled more darkly about them, and snuggling   himself still closer to the pup Neewa drew the rope between his  fore  paws. With a little snarl he set his teeth in it. And then,  steadily,  he began to chew. Now and then he growled, and in the  growl there was  a peculiarly communicative note, as if he wished  to say to Miki: 
  &quot;Don't you see?&#8212;I'm chewing this thing in two. I'll have it done   by morning. Cheer up! There's surely a better day coming.&quot;
