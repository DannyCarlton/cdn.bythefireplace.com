  It was two o'clock in the afternoon. The caribou were roasting   brown. In two more hours the feast would begin. The hour of the  fight  was at hand. 
  In the centre of the clearing three hundred men, women, and   children were gathered in a close circle about a sapling cage ten   feet square. Close to this cage, one at each side, were drawn the  two  smaller cages. Beside one of these cages stood Henri Durant;  beside  the other, Grouse Piet. They were not bantering now. Their  faces were  hard and set. And three hundred pairs of eyes were  staring at them,  and three hundred pairs of ears waiting for the  thrilling signal. 
  It came&#8212;from Grouse Piet. 
  With a swift movement Durant pulled up the door of Miki's cage.   Then, suddenly, he prodded him from behind with a crotched stick,  and  with a single leap Miki was in the big cage. Almost at the  same  instant the wolf-dog leapt from Grouse Piet's cage, and the  two faced  each other in the arena. 
  With the next breath he drew Durant could have groaned. What   happened in the following half minute was a matter of environment   with Miki. In the forest the wolf-dog would have interested him to   the exclusion of everything else, and he would have looked upon  him  as another Netah or a wild wolf. But in his present  surroundings the  idea of fighting was the last to possess him. He  was fascinated by  that grim and waiting circle of faces closing in  the big cage; he  scrutinized it, turning his head sharply from  point to point, as if  hoping to see Nanette and the baby, or even  Challoner his first  master. To the wolf-dog Grouse Piet had given  the name of Taao,  because of the extraordinary length of his  fangs; and of Taao, to  Durant's growing horror, Miki was utterly  oblivious after that first  head-on glance. He trotted to the edge  of the cage and thrust his nose  between the bars, and a taunting  laugh rose out of Grouse Piet's  throat. Then he began making a  circle of the cage, his sharp eyes on  the silent ring of faces.  Taao stood in the centre of the cage, and  not once did his reddish  eyes leave Miki. What was outside of the cage  held small interest  for him. He understood his business, and murder  was bred in his  heart. For a space during which Durant's heart beat  like a hammer  Taao turned, as if on a pivot, following Miki's  movement, and the  crest on his spine stood up like bristles. 
  Then Miki stopped, and in that moment Durant saw the end of all   his hopes. Without a sound the wolf-dog was at his opponent. A  bellow  rose from Grouse Piet's lips. A deep breath passed through  the circle  of spectators, and Durant felt a cold chill run up his  back to the  roots of his hair. What happened in the next instant  made men's hearts  stand still. In that first rush Miki should have  died. Grouse Piet  expected him to die, and Durant expected him to  die. But in the last  fractional bit of the second in which the  wolf-dog's jaws closed, Miki  was transformed into a thing of  living lightning. No man had ever seen  a movement swifter than  that with which he turned on Taao. Their jaws  clashed. There was a  sickening grinding of bone, and in another moment  they were  rolling and twisting together on the earth floor. Neither  Grouse  Piet nor Durant could see what was happening. They forgot even   their own bets in the horror of that fight. Never had there been  such  a fight at Fort O' God. 
  The sound of it reached to the Company's store. In the door,   looking toward the big cage, stood the young white man. He heard  the  snarling, the clashing of teeth, and his jaws set heavily and  a dull  flame burned in his eyes. His breath came in a sudden gasp. 
  &quot;DAMN!&quot; he cried, softly. 
  His hands clenched, and he stepped slowly down from the door and   went toward the cage. It was over when he made his way through the   ring of spectators. The fight had ended as suddenly as it had  begun,  and Grouse Piet's wolf-dog lay in the centre of the cage  with a  severed jugular. Miki looked as though he might be dying.  Durant had  opened the door and had slipped a rope over his head,  and outside the  cage Miki stood swaying on his feet, red with  blood, and half blind.  His flesh was red and bleeding in a dozen  places, and a stream of  blood trickled from his mouth. A cry of  horror rose to the young white  man's lips as he looked down at  him. 
  And then, almost in the same breath, there came a still stranger   cry. 
  &quot;Good God! Miki&#8212;Miki&#8212;Miki&#8212;&quot; 
  Beating upon his brain as if from a vast distance, coming to him   through the blindness of his wounds, Miki heard that voice. 
  The VOICE! THE voice that had lived with him in all his dreams,   the voice he had waited for, and searched for, and knew that some  day  he would find. The voice of Challoner, his master! 
  He dropped on his belly, whining, trying to see through the film   of blood in his eyes; and lying there, wounded almost unto death,  his  tail thumped the ground in recognition. And then, to the  amazement of  all who beheld, Challoner was down upon his knees  beside him, and his  arms were about him, and Miki's lacerated  tongue was reaching for his  hands, his face, his clothes. 
  &quot;Miki&#8212;Miki&#8212;Miki!&quot; 
  Durant's hand fell heavily upon Challoner's shoulder. 
  It was like the touch of a red-hot iron to Challoner. In a flash   he was on his feet, facing him. 
  &quot;He's mine,&quot; Challoner cried, trying to hold back his passion.   &quot;He's mine you&#8212;you devil!&quot; 
  And then, powerless to hold back his desire for vengeance, his   clenched fist swung like a rock to Durant's heavy jaw, and the   Frenchman went to the ground. For a moment Challoner stood over  him,  but he did not move. Fiercely he turned upon Grouse Piet and  the  crowd. Miki was cringing at his feet again. Pointing to him,  Challoner  cried loudly, so all could hear. 
  &quot;He's my dog. Where this beast got him I don't know. But he's   mine. Look for yourselves! See&#8212;see him lick my hand. Would he do   that for HIM? And look at that ear. There's no other ear in all  the  north cut like that. I lost him almost a year ago, but I'd  know him  among ten thousand by that ear. By God!&#8212;if I had known&#8212;  -&quot; 
  He elbowed his way through the breeds and Indians, leading Miki by   the rope Durant had slipped over the dog's head. He went to   MacDonnell, and told him what had happened. He told of the  preceding  spring, and of the accident in which Miki and the bear  cub were lost  from his canoe and swept over the waterfall. After  registering his  claim against whatever Durant might have to say he  went to the shack  in which he was staying at Fort 0' God. 
  An hour later Challoner sat with Miki's big head between his two   hands, and talked to him. He had bathed and dressed his wounds,  and  Miki could see. His eyes were on his master's face, and his  hard tail  thumped the floor. Both were oblivious of the sounds of  the revellers  outside; the cries of men, the shouting of boys, the  laughter of  women, and the incessant barking of dogs. In  Challoner's eyes there  was a soft glow. 
  &quot;Miki, old boy, you haven't forgotten a thing&#8212;not a dam' thing,   have you? You were nothing but an onery-legged pup then, but you   didn't forget! Remember what I told you, that I was going to take  you  and the cub down to the Girl? Do you remember? The Girl I said  was an  angel, and 'd love you to death, and all that? Well, I'm  glad  something happened&#8212;and you didn't go. It wasn't the same  when I got  back, an' SHE wasn't the same, Miki. Lord, she'd got  married, AND HAD  TWO KIDS! Think of that, old scout&#8212;TWO! How the  deuce could she have  taken care of you and the cub, eh? And  nothing else was the same, Boy.  Three years in God's Country&#8212;up  here where you burst your lungs just  for the fun of drinking in  air&#8212;changed me a lot, I guess. Inside a  week I wanted to come  back, Miki. Yessir, I was SICK to come back. So  I came. And we're  going to stick now, Miki. You're going with me up to  that new Post  the Company has given me. From now on we're pals.  Understand, old  scout, we're PALS!&quot;
