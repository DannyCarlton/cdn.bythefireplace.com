   It was late in the month of March, at the dying-out of the Eagle   Moon, that Neewa the black bear cub got his first real look at the   world. Noozak, his mother, was an old bear, and like an old person   she was filled with rheumatics and the desire to sleep late. So   instead of taking a short and ordinary nap of three months this   particular winter of little Neewa's birth she slept four, which,  made  Neewa, who was born while ms mother was sound asleep, a  little over  two months old instead of six weeks when they came out  of den. 
  In choosing this den Noozak had gone to a cavern at the crest of a   high, barren ridge, and from this point Neewa first looked down  into  the valley. For a time, coming out of darkness into sunlight,  he was  blinded. He could hear and smell and feel many things  before he could  see. And Noozak, as though puzzled at finding  warmth and sunshine in  place of cold and darkness, stood for many  minutes sniffing the wind  and looking down upon her domain. 
  For two weeks an early spring had been working its miracle of   change in that wonderful country of the northland between  Jackson's  Knee and the Shamattawa River, and from north to south  between God's  Lake and the Churchill. 
  It was a splendid world. From the tall pinnacle of rock on which   they stood it looked like a great sea of sunlight, with only here  and  there patches of white snow where the winter winds had piled  it deep.  Their ridge rose up out of a great valley. On all sides  of them, as  far as a man's eye could have reached, there were blue  and black  patches of forest, the shimmer of lakes still partly  frozen, the  sunlit sparkle of rivulet and stream, and the greening  open spaces out  of which rose the perfumes of the earth. These  smells drifted up like  tonic and food to the nostrils of Noozak  the big bear. Down there the  earth was already swelling with life.  The buds on the poplars were  growing fat and near the bursting  point; the grasses were sending out  shoots tender and sweet; the  camas were filling with juice; the  shooting stars, the dog-tooth  violets, and the spring beauties were  thrusting themselves up into  the warm glow of the sun, inviting Noozak  and Neewa to the feast.  All these things Noozak smelled with the  experience and the  knowledge of twenty years of life behind her&#8212;the  delicious aroma  of the spruce and the jackpine; the dank, sweet scent  of water-  lily roots and swelling bulbs that came from a thawed-out  fen at  the foot of the ridge; and over all these things, overwhelming   their individual sweetnesses in a still greater thrill of life,  the  smell of the heart itself! 
  And Neewa smelled them. His amazed little body trembled and   thrilled for the first time with the excitement of life. A moment   before in darkness, he found himself now in a wonderland of which  he  had never so much as had a dream. In these few minutes Nature  was at  work upon him. He possessed no knowledge, but instinct was  born within  him. He knew this was HIS world, that the sun and the  warmth were for  him, and that the sweet things of the earth were  inviting him into his  heritage. He puckered up his little brown  nose and sniffed the air,  and the pungency of everything that was  sweet and to be yearned for  came to him. 
  And he listened. His pointed ears were pricked forward, and up to   him came the drone of a wakening earth. Even the roots of the  grasses  must have been singing in their joy, for all through that  sunlit  valley there was the low and murmuring music of a country  that was at  peace because it was empty of men. Everywhere was the  rippling sound  of running water, and he heard strange sounds that  he knew was life;  the twittering of a rock-sparrow, the silver-  toned aria of a  black-throated thrush down in the fen, the shrill  paean of a  gorgeously coloured Canada jay exploring for a nesting  place in a  brake of velvety balsam. And then, far over his head, a  screaming cry  that made him shiver. It was instinct again that  told him in that cry  was danger. Noozak looked up, and saw the  shadow of Upisk, the great  eagle, as it flung itself between the  sun and the earth. Neewa saw the  shadow, and cringed nearer to his  mother. 
  And Noozak&#8212;so old that she had lost half her teeth, so old that   her bones ached on damp and chilly nights, and her eyesight was   growing dim&#8212;was still not so old that she did not look down with   growing exultation upon what she saw. Her mind was travelling  beyond  the mere valley in which they had wakened. Off there beyond  the walls  of forest, beyond the farthest lake, beyond the river  and the plain,  were the illimitable spaces which gave her home. To  her came dully a  sound uncaught by Neewa&#8212;the almost  unintelligible rumble of the great  waterfall. It was this, and the  murmur of a thousand trickles of  running water, and the soft wind  breathing down in the balsam and  spruce that put the music of  spring into the air. 
  At last Noozak heaved a great breath out of her lungs and with a   grunt to Neewa began to lead the way slowly down among the rocks  to  the foot of the ridge. 
  In the golden pool of the valley it was even warmer than on the   crest of the ridge. Noozak went straight to the edge of the  slough.  Half a dozen rice birds rose with a whir of wings that  made Neewa  almost upset himself. Noozak paid no attention to them.  A loon let out  a squawky protest at Noozak's soft-footed  appearance, and followed it  up with a raucous screech that raised  the hair on Neewa's spine. And  Noozak paid no attention to this.  Neewa observed these things. His eye  was on her, and instinct had  already winged his legs with the  readiness to run if his mother  should give the signal. In his funny  little head it was developing  very quickly that his mother was a most  wonderful creature. She  was by all odds the biggest thing alive&#8212;that  is, the biggest that  stood on legs, and moved. He was confident of  this for a space of  perhaps two minutes, when they came to the end of  the fen. And  here was a sudden snort, a crashing of bracken, the  floundering of  a huge body through knee-deep mud, and a monstrous bull  moose,  four times as big as Noozak, set off in lively flight. Neewa's   eyes all but popped from his head. And STILL Noozak PAID NO   ATTENTION! 
  It was then that Neewa crinkled up his tiny nose and snarled, just   as he had snarled at Noozak's ears and hair and at sticks he had   worried in the black cavern. A glorious understanding dawned upon   him. He could snarl at anything he wanted to snarl at, no matter  how  big. For everything ran away from Noozak his mother. 
  All through this first glorious day Neewa was discovering things,   and with each hour it was more and more impressed upon him that  his  mother was the unchallenged mistress of all this new and  sunlit  domain. 
  Noozak was a thoughtful old mother of a bear who had reared   fifteen or eighteen families in her time, and she travelled very   little this first day in order that Neewa's tender feet might  toughen  up a bit. They scarcely left the fen, except to go into a  nearby clump  of trees where Noozak used her claws to shred a  spruce that they might  get at the juice and slimy substance just  under the bark. Neewa liked  this dessert after their feast of  roots and bulbs, and tried to claw  open a tree on his own account.  By mid-afternoon Noozak had eaten  until her sides bulged out, and  Neewa himself&#8212;between his mother's  milk and the many odds and  ends of other things&#8212;looked like an  over-filled pod. Selecting a  spot where the declining sun made a warm  oven of a great white  rock, lazy old Noozak lay down for a nap, while  Neewa, wandering  about in quest of an adventure of his own, came face  to face with  a ferocious bug. 
  The creature was a giant wood-beetle two inches long. Its two   battling pincers were jet black, and curved like hooks of iron. It   was a rich brown in colour and in the sunlight its metallic armour   shone in a dazzling splendour. Neewa, squatted flat on his belly,   eyed it with a swiftly beating heart. The beetle was not more than  a  foot away, and ADVANCING! That was the curious and rather  shocking  part of it. It was the first living thing he had met with  that day  that had not run away. As it advanced slowly on its two  rows of legs  the beetle made a clicking sound that Neewa heard  quite distinctly.  With the fighting blood of his father,  Soominitik, nerving him on to  the adventure he thrust out a  hesitating paw, and instantly  Chegawasse, the beetle, took upon  himself a most ferocious aspect. His  wings began humming like a  buzz-saw, his pincers opened until they  could have taken in a  man's finger, and he vibrated on his legs until  it looked as  though he might be performing some sort of a dance. Neewa  jerked  his paw back and after a moment or two Chegawasse calmed  himself  and again began to ADVANCE! 
  Neewa did not know, of course, that the beetle's field of vision   ended about four inches from the end of his nose; the situation,   consequently, was appalling. But it was never born in a son of a   father like Soominitik to run from a bug, even at nine weeks of  age.  Desperately he thrust out his paw again, and unfortunately  for him one  of his tiny claws got a half Nelson on the beetle and  held Chegawasse  on his shining back so that he could neither buzz  not click. A great  exultation swept through Neewa. Inch by inch he  drew his paw in until  the beetle was within reach of his sharp  little teeth. Then he smelled  of him. 
  That was Chegawasse's opportunity. The pincers closed and Noozak's   slumbers were disturbed by a sudden bawl of agony. When she raised   her head Neewa was rolling about as if in a fit. He was scratching   and snarling and spitting. Noozak eyed him speculatively for some   moments, then reared herself slowly and went to him. With one big  paw  she rolled him over&#8212;and saw Chegawasse firmly and  determinedly  attached to her offspring's nose. Flattening Neewa on  his back so that  he could not move she seized the beetle between  her teeth, bit slowly  until Chegawasse lost his hold, and then  swallowed him. 
  From then until dusk Neewa nursed his sore nose. A little before   dark Noozak curled herself up against the big rock, and Neewa took   his supper. Then he made himself a nest in the crook of her big,  warm  forearm. In spite of his smarting nose he was a happy bear,  and at the  end of his first day he felt very brave and very  fearless, though he  was but nine weeks old. He had come into the  world, he had looked upon  many things, and if he had not conquered  he at least had gone  gloriously through the day.
