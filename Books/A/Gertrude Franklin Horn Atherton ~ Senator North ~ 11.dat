Betty went home to her room and cried steadily for an hour. She would  not analyze the complex source of her emotions, but addressed a bitter  reproach to her father's shade; and she reassured herself by frankly  admitting that it would give her pleasure to win the approval of  Senator North.    
She bathed her eyes and went to her mother's room. The sooner that  ordeal was over, she reflected, the better. Mrs. Madison was reading  an amusing novel and looked up with a smile, then pushed the book  aside.    
"Have you been crying, darling?" she asked. "What can be the matter?"    
Betty told her story without preamble. Her mother's nerves could stand  a shock, but not three minutes of uncertainty. Mrs. Madison listened  with more equanimity than Betty anticipated.    
"I suppose I may consider myself fortunate that I have not had one of  his brats thrust on me before," she remarked philosophically. "What  are we to do about this creature?"    
"There is only one human thing to do. It is not her fault, and she is  very wretched at present. And now that I know the truth I suppose I am  as responsible as my father would be if he were alive. I shall go to  see her to-morrow, and if she is presentable and seems good I shall  bring her to Washington. Of course I shall not bring her here without  your permission--it is your house. Let me read you his letter."    
"Do you feel very strongly on the subject?" Mrs. Madison asked when  Betty had finished.    
"Oh, I do! I do! I will promise not to bring her to Washington at all  if she is impossible, but if she is all I feel sure she must be, let  me bring her here for a few weeks, until we have decided what to do  for her. I know it is a great deal to ask--her presence cannot fail to  be hateful to you--"    
"My dear, I have outlived any feeling of that sort, and I have not put  everything on your shoulders all these years to thwart you now, when  you feel so deeply. Moreover, an old memory came to me while you were  reading that letter. When I was a little girl, about eight or ten, I  spent an entire summer with Aunt Mary Eager at her home in Virginia.  She had a house full, and there were five other little girls beside  myself. A brook ran across the foot of the plantation, and we were  very fond of playing there. Directly across was the hut of a freed  slave who had a little girl about our own age. The child was a  beautiful octaroon. I can see her plainly, with her honey-coloured  skin, her immense black eyes, her long straight black hair, and her  stiff little white frock tucked to the waist. Her mother took the  greatest pride in her, and was always changing her clothes.    
"Every day she used to come to the edge of her side of the brook and  watch us. We never noticed her, for although we often played with the  little black piccaninnies, the yellow child of a freed slave was  another matter. One day--I think she had watched us for about a week--  she came half-way across the bridge. We stared at each other, but took  no notice of her. The next day she walked straight across and up to  us, and asked us very nicely if she might play with us. We turned upon  her six scarlet scandalized faces, and what we said, in what brutal  child language, I do not care to repeat. The child stared at us for a  moment as if she were looking into the Inferno itself, and I expect  she was, poor little soul! Then she gave a cry, and tore across the  bridge and up the 'pike as hard as she could run. As long as we could  see her she was running, and as I never saw her again--we avoided the  brook after that--it seemed to me for years as if she must be running  still. And for years those flying feet haunted me, and I used to long  as I grew older to do penance in some way. I befriended many a poor  yellow girl, hoping she might be that child. Then life grew too sad  for me to remember the sins of my childhood. But I like the idea of  making penance at this late day and receiving this girl for a few  weeks into my house: it will be a penance, for I do not fancy sitting  at the table with a woman with negro blood in her veins, I can assure  you. But I shall do it. I believe if I did not I should be haunted  again by those little flying feet. There is no chance of this being  her daughter, for she would have been too old to attract your father's  fancy. But that is not the point. I make one condition. No one must  know the truth, not even Sally or Jack. She must pass for a distant  relative, left suddenly destitute." "She would probably be the last to  wish the truth known. But you have taken a weight off my mind, Molly  dear, and I am deeply grateful to you."
