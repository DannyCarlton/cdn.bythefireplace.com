    Mr. Crabb acted rashly in siding with Hector, and speaking against   Mr. Smith's nephew. Socrates showed his displeasure by a frigid   demeanor, and by seeking occasions for snubbing his assistant. On  the  other hand, Hector felt grateful for his intercession, and an  intimacy  sprang up between them. 
  A few days afterward, on a half holiday, Mr. Crabb said: &quot;Roscoe, I   am going out for a walk. Do you care to accompany me?&quot; 
  &quot;I will do so with pleasure,&quot; said Hector, sincerely. 
  &quot;Mr. Crabb,&quot; he said, after they were fairly on their way, &quot;I am   sorry to see that Mr. Smith has not forgiven you for taking my part   against Jim.&quot; 
  &quot;I would do it again, Roscoe,&quot; said the usher. &quot;I could not sit   silent while so great an injustice was being done.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think Jim was punished?&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure he was not. He is a boy after Mr. Smith's own heart,  that  is, he possesses the same mean and disagreeable qualities,  perhaps  in a greater degree. Has he interfered with you since?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered Hector, smiling; &quot;he probably found that I object to   being bullied.&quot; 
  &quot;You are fortunate in being strong enough to withstand his  attacks.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Hector, quietly; &quot;I am not afraid of him.&quot; 
  &quot;Bullies are generally cowards,&quot; said the usher. 
  &quot;I wonder, Mr. Crabb, you are willing to stay at Smith Institute,  as  usher to such a man as Mr. Smith.&quot; 
  &quot;Ah, Roscoe!&quot; said Mr. Crabb, sighing; &quot;it is not of my own free   will that I stay. Poverty is a hard task-master. I must teach for a   living.&quot; 
  &quot;But surely you could get a better position?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps so; but how could I live while I was seeking for it. My   lad,&quot; he said, after a pause, &quot;I have a great mind to confide in  you;  I want one friend to whom I can talk unreservedly.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Crabb,&quot; said Hector, earnestly, &quot;I shall feel flattered by  your  confidence.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Roscoe; or, rather, since we are going to be friends,   let me distinguish you from the other boys and call you Hector.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish you would, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;I need not tell you that I am poor,&quot; continued Mr. Crabb; &quot;you can   read it in my shabby clothes. I sometimes see the boys looking at my   poor suit, as if they wondered why I dressed so badly. Smith has  more  than once cast insulting looks at my rusty coat. It is not   penuriousness, as some of the boys may think&#8212;it is poverty that   prevents me from attiring myself more becomingly.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Crabb, I sympathize with you,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;Thank you, Hector. Of that I am sure.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Smith ought to pay you enough to clothe yourself neatly. He   makes you work hard enough.&quot; 
  &quot;He pays me twenty dollars a month,&quot; said the usher; &quot;twenty  dollars  and my board.&quot; 
  &quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Hector, in amazement. &quot;Why, the girl in the   kitchen earns nearly that&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure,&quot; answered the usher, bitterly; &quot;but in Mr. Smith's   estimation, I stand very little higher. He does not value education,   not possessing it himself. However, you may wonder why, even with   this sum, I cannot dress better. It is because I have another than   myself to support.&quot; 
  &quot;You are not married?&quot; asked Hector, in surprise. 
  &quot;No; but I have an invalid sister, who is wholly dependent upon me.   To her I devote three-quarters of my salary, and this leaves me very   little for myself. My poor sister is quite unable to earn anything   for herself, so it is a matter of necessity.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; said Hector, in a tone of sympathy. 
  &quot;You now see why I do not dare to leave this position, poor as it   is. For myself, I might take the risk, but I should not feel   justified in exposing my sister to the hazard of possible want.&quot; 
  &quot;You are right, Mr. Crabb. I am very sorry now that you spoke up  for  me. It has prejudiced Mr. Smith against you.&quot; 
  &quot;No, no; I won't regret that. Indeed, he would hesitate to turn me   adrift, for he would not be sure of getting another teacher to take   my place for the same beggarly salary.&quot; 
  &quot;Something may turn up for you yet, Mr. Crabb,&quot; said Hector,   hopefully. 
  &quot;Perhaps so,&quot; answered the usher, but his tone was far from   sanguine. 
  When they returned to the school, Hector carried out a plan which   had suggested itself to him in the interest of Mr. Crabb. He wrote  to  a boy of his acquaintance, living in New York, who, he had heard,  was  in want of a private tutor, and recommended Mr. Crabb, in strong   terms, for that position. He did this sincerely, for he had found  the  usher to be a good teacher, and well versed in the studies  preparatory  to college. He did not think it best to mention this to  Mr. Crabb, for  the answer might be unfavorable, and then his hopes  would have been  raised only to be dashed to the earth. 
  Later in the day, Hector fell in with Bates, already referred to as   a special friend of Jim Smith. The intimacy, however, had been   diminished since the contest in which Hector gained the victory.   Bates was not quite so subservient to the fallen champion, and Jim   resented it. 
  &quot;I saw you walking out with old Crabb,&quot; said Bates. 
  &quot;He isn't particularly old,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;Oh, you know what I mean. Did you ever see such a scarecrow?&quot; 
  &quot;Do you refer to his dress?&quot; asked Hector. 
  &quot;Yes; he'll soon be in rags. I shouldn't wonder at all if that old   suit of his was worn by one of Noah's sons in the ark.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't suppose he wears it from choice, do you?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know. He's stingy, I suppose&#8212;afraid to spend a cent.&quot; 
  &quot;You are mistaken. He has a sister to support, and his salary is   very small.&quot; 
  &quot;I can believe that. Old Sock is mean with his teachers. How much   does he pay Crabb?&quot; 
  &quot;It is very little, but I don't know that I ought to tell.&quot; 
  &quot;I say, though, Roscoe, I wouldn't go to walk with him again.&quot; 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; 
  &quot;The boys will say that, you are trying to get into his good  graces,  so he'll let you off easy in your lessons.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't want him to let me off easy; I generally intend to be   prepared.&quot; 
  &quot;I know, but that's what they will say.&quot; 
  &quot;Let them say what they please, and I will do what I please,&quot; said   Hector, independently. 
  &quot;Old Sock ain't any too fond of Crabb since he took your part the   other day. Jim says the old man means to bounce him before long.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose that means discharge him.&quot; 
  &quot;It means giving him his walking papers. Jim will see that he does   it, too.&quot; 
  Hector did not reply, but he felt more than ever glad that he had   written a letter which might possibly bring the poor usher more   profitable and, at the same time, agreeable employment. 
  &quot;Jim doesn't like you, either,&quot; added Bates. 
  &quot;I never supposed he did. I can do without his favor.&quot; 
  &quot;He will get you into a scrape if he can.&quot; 
  &quot;I have no doubt whatever of his benevolent intentions toward me. I   shall not let it interfere with my happiness.&quot; 
  Just then a sharp cry was heard, as of a boy in pain. It came from   the school yard, which the two boys were approaching on their return   from a walk. 
  &quot;What's that?&quot; asked Hector, quickly. 
  &quot;I expect it's the new boy.&quot; 
  One had arrived the day before. 
  &quot;Is he hurt, I wonder?&quot; asked Hector, quickening his steps. 
  &quot;Jim's got hold of him, probably,&quot; said Bates; &quot;he said this  morning  he was going to give the little chap a lesson to break him  into  school ways.&quot; 
  &quot;He did, did he?&quot; said Hector, compressing his lips. &quot;I shall have   something to say to that,&quot; and he quickened his steps.
