  A red, unwinking eye staring at him fixedly from out of impenetrable  gloom&#8212;an ogreish, gleaming thing that brought life back into him with  a thrill of horror&#8212;was Howland's first vision of returning  consciousness. It was dead in front of him, on a level with his face&#8212;a  ball of yellow fire that seemed to burn into his very soul. He tried to  cry out, but no sound fell from his lips; he strove to move, to fight  himself away, but there was no power of movement in his limbs. The eye  grew larger. He saw that it was so bright it cast a halo, and the halo  widened before his own staring eyes until the dense gloom about it  seemed to be melting away. Then he knew. It was a lantern in front of  him, not more than ten feet away. Consciousness flooded him, and he  made another effort to cry out, to free his arms from an invisible  clutch that held him powerless. At first he thought this was the clutch  of human hands; then as the lantern-light revealed more clearly the  things about him and the outlines of his own figure, he saw that it was  a rope, and he knew that he was unable to cry out because of something  tight and suffocating about his mouth.
  The truth came to him swiftly. He had come up to the coyote on a  sledge. Some one had struck him. He remembered that men had  half-dragged him over the rocks, and these men had bound and gagged  him, and left him here, with the lantern staring him in the face. But  where was he? He shifted his eyes, straining to penetrate the gloom.  Ahead of him, just beyond the light, there was a black wall; he could  not move his head, but he saw where that same wall closed in on the  left. He turned his gaze upward, and it ended with that same  imprisoning barrier of rock. Then he looked down, and the cry of horror  that rose in his throat died in a muffled groan. The light fell dimly  on a sack&#8212;two of them&#8212;three&#8212;a tightly packed wall of them.
  He knew now what had happened. He was imprisoned in the coyote, and  the sacks about him were filled with powder. He was sitting on  something hard&#8212;a box&#8212;fifty pounds of dynamite! The cold sweat stood  out in beads on his face, glistening in the lantern-glow. From between  his feet a thin, white, ghostly line ran out until it lost itself in  the blackness under the lantern. It was the fuse, leading to the box of  dynamite on which he was sitting!
  Madly he struggled at the thongs that bound him until he sank  exhausted against the row of powder sacks at his back. Like words of  fire the last warning of Meleese burned in his brain&#8212;&#8220;You must go,  to-morrow&#8212;to-morrow&#8212;or they will kill you!&#8221; And this was the way in  which he was to die! There flamed before his eyes the terrible  spectacle which he had witnessed a few hours before&#8212;the holocaust of  fire and smoke and thunder that had disrupted a mountain, a chaos of  writhing, twisting fury, and in that moment his heart seemed to cease  its beating. He closed his eyes and tried to calm himself. Was it  possible that there lived men so fiendish as to condemn him to this  sort of death? Why had not his enemies killed him out among the rocks?  That would have been easier&#8212;quicker&#8212;less troublesome. Why did they  wish to torture him? What terrible thing had he done? Was he  mad&#8212;mad&#8212;and this all a terrible nightmare, a raving find unreal  contortion of things in his brain? In this hour of death question after  question raced through his head, and he answered no one of them. He sat  still for a time, scarcely breathing. There was no sound, save the  beating of his own heart. Then there came another, almost unheard at  first, faint, thrilling, maddening.
  Tick&#8212;tick&#8212;tick!
  It was the beating of his watch. A spasm of horror seized him.
  What time was it? The coyote was to be fired at nine o'clock. It was  four when he left his cabin. How long had he been unconscious? Was it  time now&#8212;now? Was MacDonald's finger already reaching out to that  little white button which would send him into eternity?
  He struggled again, gnashing furiously at the thing which covered  his mouth, tearing the flesh of his wrists as he twisted at the ropes  which bound him, choking himself with his efforts to loosen the thong  about his neck. Exhausted again, he sank back, panting, half dead. As  he lay with closed eyes a little of his reason asserted itself. After  all, was he such a coward as to go mad?
  Tick&#8212;tick&#8212;tick!
  His watch was beating at a furious rate. Was something wrong with  it? Was it going too fast? He tried to count the seconds, but they  raced away from him. When he looked again his gaze fell on the little  yellow tongue of flame in the lantern globe. It was not the steady,  unwinking eye of a few minutes before. There was a sputtering weakness  about it now, and as he watched the light grew fainter and fainter. The  flame was going out. A few minutes more and he would be in darkness. At  first the significance of it did not come to him; then he straightened  himself with a jerk that tightened the thong about his neck until it  choked him. Hours must have passed since the lantern had been placed on  that rock, else the oil would not be burned out of it now!
  For the first time Howland realized that it was becoming more and  more difficult for him to get breath. The thing about his neck was  tightening, slowly, inexorably, like a hot band of steel, and suddenly,  because of this tightening, he found that he had recovered his voice.
  &#8220;This damned rawhide&#8212;is pinching&#8212;my Adam's apple&#8212;&#8221;
  Whatever had been about his mouth had slipped down and his words  sounded hollow and choking in the rock-bound chamber. He tried to raise  his voice in a shout, though he knew how futile his loudest shrieks  would be. The effort choked him more. His suffering was becoming  excruciating. Sharp pains darted like red-hot needles through his  limbs, his back tortured him, and his head ached as though a knife had  cleft the base of his skull. The strength of his limbs was leaving him.  He no longer felt any sensation in his cramped feet. He measured the  paralysis creeping up his legs inch by inch, driving the sharp pains  before it&#8212;and then a groan of horror rose to his lips.
  The light had gone out!
  As if that dying of the little yellow flame were the signal for his  death, there came to his ears a sharp hissing sound, a spark leaped up  into the blackness before his eyes, and a slow, creeping glow came  toward him over the rock at his feet.
  The hour&#8212;the minute&#8212;the second had come, and MacDonald had pressed  the little white button that was to send him into eternity! He did not  cry out now. He knew that the end was very near, and in its nearness he  found new strength. Once he had seen a man walk to his death on the  scaffold, and as the condemned had spoken his last farewell, with the  noose about his neck, he had marveled at the clearness of his voice, at  the fearlessness of this creature in his last moment on earth.
  Now he understood. Inch by inch the fuse burned toward him&#8212;a fifth  of the distance, a quarter&#8212;now a third. At last it reached a half&#8212;was  almost under his feet. Two minutes more of life. He put his whole  strength once again in an attempt to free his hands. This time his  attempt was cool, steady, masterful&#8212;-with death one hundred seconds  away. His heart gave a sudden bursting leap into his throat when he  felt something give. Another effort&#8212;and in the powder-choked vault  there rang out a thrilling cry of triumph. His hands were free! He  reached forward to the fuse, and this time a moaning, wordless sob fell  from him, faint, terrifying, with all the horror that might fill a  human soul in its inarticulate note. He could not reach the fuse  because of the thong about his neck!
  He felt for his knife. He had left it in his room. Sixty seconds  more&#8212;forty&#8212;thirty! He could see the fiery end of the fuse almost at  his feet. Suddenly his groping fingers came in contact with the cold  steel of his pocket revolver and with a last hope he snatched it forth,  stretching down his pistol arm until the muzzle of the weapon was  within a dozen inches of the deadly spark. At his first shot the spark  leaped, but did not go out. After the second there was no longer the  fiery, creeping thing on the floor, and, crushing his head back against  the sacks, Howland sat for many minutes as if death had in reality come  to him in the moment of his deliverance. After a time, with tedious  slowness, he worked a hand into his trousers' pocket, where he carried  a pen-knife. It took him a long time to saw through the rawhide thong  about his neck. After that he cut the rope that bound his ankles.
  He made an effort to rise, but no sooner had he gained his feet than  his paralyzed limbs gave way under him and he dropped in a heap on the  floor. Very slowly the blood began finding its way through his choked  veins again, and with the change there came over him a feeling of  infinite restfulness. He stretched himself out, with his face turned to  the black wall above, realizing only that he was saved, that he had  outwitted his mysterious enemies again, and that he was comfortable. He  made no effort to think&#8212;to scheme out his further deliverance. He was  with the powder and the dynamite, and the powder and the dynamite could  not be exploded until human hands came to attach a new fuse. MacDonald  would attend to that very soon, so he went off into a doze that was  almost sleep. In his half-consciousness there came to him but one  sound&#8212;that dreadful ticking of his watch. He seemed to have listened  to it for hours when there arose another sound&#8212;the ticking of another  watch.
  He sat up, startled, wondering, and then he laughed happily as he  heard the sound more distinctly. It was the beating of picks on the  rock outside. Already MacDonald's men were at work clearing the mouth  of the coyote. In half an hour he would be out in the big, breathing  world again.
  The thought brought him to his feet. The numbness was gone from his  limbs and he could walk about. His first move was to strike a match and  look at his watch.
  &#8220;Half-past ten!&#8221;
  He spoke the words aloud, thinking of Meleese. In an hour and a half  he was to meet her on the trail. Would he be released in time to keep  the tryst? How should he explain his imprisonment in the coyote so that  he could leave MacDonald without further loss of time? As the sound of  the picks came nearer his brain began working faster. If he could only  evade explanations until morning&#8212;and then reveal the whole dastardly  business to MacDonald! There would be time then for those explanations,  for the running down of his murderous assailants, and in the while he  would be able to keep his appointment with Meleese.
  He was not long in finding a way in which this scheme could be  worked, and gathering up the severed ropes and rawhide he concealed  them between two of the powder sacks so that those who entered the  coyote would discover no signs of his terrible imprisonment. Close to  the mouth of the tunnel there was a black rent in the wall of rock,  made by a bursting charge of dynamite, in which he could conceal  himself. When the men were busy examining the broken fuse he would step  out and join them. It would look as though he had crawled through the  tunnel after them.
  Half an hour later a mass of rock rolled down close to his feet, and  a few moments after he saw a shadowy human form crawling through the  hole it had left. A second followed, and then a third;&#8212;and the first  voice he heard was that of MacDonald.
  &#8220;Give us the lantern, Bucky,&#8221; he called back, and a gleam of light  shot into the black chamber. The men walked cautiously toward the fuse,  and Howland saw the little superintendent fall on his knees.
  &#8220;What in hell!&#8221; he heard him exclaim, and then there was a silence.  As quietly as a cat Howland worked himself to the entrance and made a  clatter among the rocks. It was he who responded to the voice.
  &#8220;What's up, MacDonald?&#8221;
  He coolly joined the little group. MacDonald looked up, and when he  saw the new chief bending over him his eyes stared in unbounded wonder.
  &#8220;Howland!&#8221; he gasped.
  It was all he said, but in that one word and in the strange  excitement in the superintendent's face Howland read that which made  him turn quickly to the men, giving them his first command as  general-in-chief of the road that was going to the bay.
  &#8220;Get out of the coyote, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We won't do anything more  until morning.&#8221;
  To MacDonald, as the men went out ahead of them, he added in a low  voice:
  &#8220;Guard the entrance to this tunnel with half a dozen of your best  men to-night, MacDonald. I know things which will lead me to  investigate this to-morrow. I'm going to leave you as soon as I get  outside. Spread the report that it was simply a bad fuse. Understand?&#8221;
  He crawled out ahead of the superintendent, and before MacDonald had  emerged from the coyote he had already lost himself in the starlit  gloom of the night and was hastening to his tryst with the beautiful  girl, who, he believed, would reveal to him at least a part of one of  the strangest and most diabolical plots that had ever originated in the  brain of man.
