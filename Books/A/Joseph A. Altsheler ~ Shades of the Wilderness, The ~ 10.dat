  Harry and Dalton did not awake until late the next morning and they  found they had not suffered at all from sleeping between four walls and  under a roof. Their lungs were full of fresh air, and youth with all  its joyous irresponsibility had come back. Harry sprang out of bed.
  &#8220;Up! up! old boy!&#8221; Harry cried to Dalton. &#8220;Don't you hear the bugles  calling? not to battle but to pleasure! There is no enemy in our front!  We don't have to cross a river with an overwhelming army pressing down  upon us! We don't have to ride before the dawn on a scout which may  lead us into a thicket full of hostile riflemen. We're in a city, boy,  and our business now is beauty and pleasure!&#8221;
  &#8220;Harry,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;you ought to go far.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, George? What induces you to assume the role of a prophet  concerning me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because you're so full of life. You're so keen about everything.  You must have a heart and lungs of extra steam power.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I notice you don't say anything about brain power. Maybe you  think it's the quiet, rather silent fellows like yourself, George, who  have an excess of that.&#8221;
  &#8220;None of your irony. Am I not looking forward to this ball as much  as you are? I was a boy when I entered the war, Harry, but two years of  fighting day and night age one terribly. I feel as if I could patronize  any woman under twenty-five, and treat her as quite a simple young  thing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Try it, George, and see what happens to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, no! I merely said I felt that way. I've too much sense to put  it into action.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you know, George, that when this war is over it will be really  time for us to be thinking about girls. We'll be quite old enough. They  say that many of the Yankee maidens in Philadelphia and New York are  fine for looks. I wonder if they'll cast a favoring eye on young  Southern officers as our conquering armies go marching down their  streets!&#8221;
  &#8220;It's too remote. Don't think about it, Harry. Richmond will do us  for the present.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you can let a fellow project his mind into the future.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not so far that we'll be marching as conquerors through  Philadelphia and New York. Let's deal with realities.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've always thought there was something of the Yankee about you,  George, not in political principles&#8212;I never question your devotion to  the cause&#8212; but in calculating, weighing everything and deciding in  favor of the one that weighs an ounce the most.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you about through dressing? You've taken a minute longer than  the regular time.&#8221;
  There was a knock at the door, and, when Dalton opened it a few  inches, a black head announced through the crack that breakfast was  ready.
  &#8220;See what a disgrace you're bringing upon us,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Delaying everything. Mrs. Lanham will say that we're two impostors,  that such malingerers cannot possibly belong to the Army of Northern  Virginia.&#8221;
  &#8220;Lead on,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I'm ready, and I'm hungry as every soldier  in the Southern army always is.&#8221;
  They had a warm greeting from their hospitable hosts, followed by an  abundant breakfast. Then at Mrs. Lanham's earnest solicitation they  turned over their dress uniforms to her to be repaired and pressed.  Then they went out into the streets again, and spent the whole day  rambling about, enjoying everything with the keen and intense delight  that can come only to the young, and after long abstinence. Richmond  was not depressed. Far from it. There had been a wonderful  transformation since those dark days when the army of McClellan was  near enough to see the spires of its churches. The flood of battle had  rolled far away since then, and it had never come back. It could never  come back. It was true that the Army of Northern Virginia had failed at  Gettysburg, but it was returning to the South unassailed, and was ready  to repeat its former splendid achievements.
  Harry went to the post office, and found there, to his great  surprise and delight, a letter from his father, written three or four  days after Vicksburg.
  My dear son: [he wrote]
  The news has just come to us that the Army of Northern Virginia,  while performing prodigies of valor, has failed to carry all the  Northern positions at Gettysburg. Only complete success could warrant a  further advance. I assume therefore that General Lee is retreating and  I assume also that you, Harry, my beloved son, are alive, that you came  unharmed out of that terrible battle. It does not seem possible to me  that it could be otherwise. I cannot conceive of you fallen. It may be  that it's because you are my son. The sons of others may fall, but not  mine, just as we know that all others are doomed to die, but get into  the habit of thinking ourselves immortal. So, I address this letter to  you in the full belief that it will reach you somewhere, and that you  will read it.
  You know, of course, of our great loss at Vicksburg. It is  disastrous but not irreparable. We still have a powerful army in the  West, hardy, indomitable, one with which the enemy will have to reckon.  As for myself I have been spared in many battles and I am well. It  seems the sport of chance that you and I, while fighting on the same  side, should have been separated in this war, you in the East and I in  the West. But it has been done by One who knows best, and after all I  am glad that you have been in such close contact with two of the  greatest and highest-minded soldiers of the ages, Stonewall Jackson and  Robert E. Lee. I do not think of them merely as soldiers, but as  knights and champions with flaming swords. One of them, alas! is gone,  but we have the other, and if man can conquer he will. Here in the West  we repose our faith in Lee, as surely as do you in the East, you who  see his face and hear his voice every day.
  I have had two or three letters from Pendleton. That part of the  State is for the present outside the area of conflict, though I hear  that the guerilla bands to the east in the mountains still vex and  annoy, and that Skelly is growing bolder. I foresee the time when we  shall have to reckon with this man, who is a mere brigand.
  I hear that the prospects for fruit in our orchards were never  finer. You will remember how you prowled in them when you were a little  boy, Harry, and what a pirate you were among the apples and peaches and  pears and good things that grew on tree and bush and briar in that  beautiful old commonwealth of ours. I often upbraided you then, but I  should like to see you now, far out on a bough as of old, reaching for  a big yellow pear, or a red, red bunch of cherries! Alas! there are  many lads who will never return, who will never see the pear trees and  the cherry trees again, but I repeat I cannot feel that you will be  among them. Who would ever have dreamed when this war began that it  could go so far? More than two years of fierce and deadly battles and I  can see no end. A deadlock and neither side willing to yield! How glad  would be the men who made the war to see both sections back where they  were two and a half years ago! and that's no treason.
  Water rose in Harry's eyes. He knew how terribly his father's heart  had been torn by the quarrel between North and South, and that he had  thoughts which he did not tell to his son. Harry was beginning at last  to think some of the same thoughts himself. If the South succeeded,  then, after the war, what? Another war later on or reunion.
  The rest of the letter was wholly personal, and in the end it  directed Harry, when writing to him, to address his letters care of the  Western Army under General Bragg. Harry was moved and he responded at  once. He went to the hotel in which he had met the young men who  constituted the leading lights in what was called the Mosaic Club, and,  securing writing materials, made a long reply, which he posted with  every hope that it would soon reach its destination.
  Early in the evening he rejoined Dalton at the house of the Lanhams  and they found that Mrs. Lanham had done wonders with their best  uniforms. When they were dressed in them they felt that it was no  harder to charge the Curtis house than to rush a battery.
  &#8220;You young men go early,&#8221; said Mr. Lanham. &#8220;Mrs. Lanham and I will  appear later.&#8221;
  They departed, daring to practice their dance steps in the street to  the delight of small boys who did not hesitate to chaff them. But Harry  and Dalton did not care. They answered the chaff in kind, and soon  approached the Curtis home, all the windows of which were blazing with  light.
  The house stood in extensive grounds, and lofty white pillars gave  it an imposing appearance. Guests were arriving fast. Most of the men  were military, but there was a fair sprinkling of civilians  nevertheless. The lads saw their friends of the Mosaic Club pass in  just ahead of them, all dressed with extreme care. Generals and  colonels and other officers were in most favor now, but these men, with  their swift and incisive wit and their ability to talk well about  everything, fully made up for the lack of uniform.
  Harry and Dalton, before passing through the side gateway that led  to the house, paused awhile to look at those who came. Many people, and  they ranked among the best in Richmond, walked. They had sent all their  horses to the front long ago to be ridden by cavalrymen or to draw  cannon. Others, not so self-sacrificing, came in heavy carriages with  negroes driving.
  Harry noticed that in many cases the clothing of the men showed a  little white at the seams, and there were cuffs the ends of which had  been trimmed with great care. But it was these whom he respected most.  He remembered that Virginia had not really wanted to go into the war,  and that she had delayed long, but, being in it, she was making supreme  sacrifices.
  And there were many young girls who did not need elaborate dress. In  their simple white or pink, often but cotton, their cheeks showing the  delicate color that is possessed only by the girls in the border states  of the South, they seemed very beautiful to Harry and George, who had  known nothing but camps and armies so long.
  It was the healthy admiration of the brave youth of one sex for the  fair youth of the other, but there was in it a deeper note, too. Age  can stand misfortune. Youth wonders why it is stricken, and Harry felt  as they passed by, bright of face and soft of voice, that the clouds  were gathering heavily over them.
  But he was too young himself for the feeling to endure long. Dalton  was proposing that they go in and they promptly joined the stream of  entering guests. Randolph soon found them and presented them to Mrs.  Curtis, a large woman of middle years, and dignified manner, related to  nearly all the old families of Virginia, and a descendant of a  collateral branch of the Washingtons. Her husband, William Curtis,  seemed to be of a different type, a man of sixty, tall, thin and more  reserved than most Southerners of his time. His thin lips were usually  compressed and his pale blue eyes were lacking in warmth. But the long  strong line of his jaw showed that he was a man of strength and  decision.
  &#8220;A Northern bough on a Southern tree,&#8221; whispered Dalton, as they  passed on. &#8220;He comes from some place up the valley and they say that  the North itself has not his superior in financial skill.&#8221;
  &#8220;I did not warm to him at first,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but I respect him. As  you know, George, we've put too little stress upon his kind of ability.  We'll need him and more like him when the Confederacy is established.  We'll have to build ourselves up as a great power, and that's done by  trade and manufactures more than by arms.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's so, Harry. But listen to that music!&#8221;
  A band of four pieces placed behind flowers and shrubbery was  playing. Here was no blare of trumpets or call of bugles. It was the  music of the dance and the sentimental old songs of the South, nearly  all of which had a sad and wailing note. Harry heard the four black men  play the songs that he had heard Samuel Jarvis sing, deep in the  Kentucky mountains, and his heart beat with an emotion that he could  not understand. Was it a cry for peace? Did his soul tell him that an  end should come to fighting? Then throbbed the music of the lines:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Soft o'er the fountain lingering falls the Southern moon <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Far o'er the mountain breaks the day too soon. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;In thy dark eyes' splendor, where the moonlight loves to dwell <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;Weary looks, yet tender, speak their fond farewell. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nita, Juanita! Ask thy soul if we should part, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nita, Juanita! Lean thou on my heart!
  The music of the sad old song throbbed and throbbed, and sank deep  into Harry's heart. At another time he might not have been stirred, but  at this moment he was responsive in every fiber. He saw once more the  green wilderness, and he heard once more the mellow tones of the singer  coming back in far echoes from the gorges.
  &#8220;Nita, Juanita! Ask thy soul if we should part,&#8221; hummed Dalton, but  Harry was still far away in the green wilderness, listening to the  singer of the mountains. Then the singer stopped suddenly, and he was  listening once more to the startling prediction of the old, old woman:
  &#8220;I am proud that our house has sheltered you, but it is not for the  last time. You will come again, and you will be thin and pale and in  rags, and you will fall at the door. I see you coming with these two  eyes of mine.&#8221;
  That prediction had been made a long time ago, years since, it  seemed, but whenever it returned to him, and it returned at most  unexpected times, it lost nothing of its amazing vividness and power;  rather they were increased. Could it be true that the supremely old had  a vision or second sight? Then he rebuked himself angrily. There was  nothing supernatural in this world.
  &#8220;Wake up, Harry! What are you thinking about?&#8221; whispered Dalton  sharply. &#8220;You seem to be dreaming, and here's a house full of pretty  girls, with more than a half-dozen looking at you, the gallant young  officer of the Army of Northern Virginia, the story of whose romantic  exploits had already reached Richmond.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was dreaming and I apologize,&#8221; said Harry. That minute in which  he had seen so much, so far away, passed utterly, and in another minute  both he and Dalton were dancing with Virginia girls, as fair as dreams  to these two, who had looked so long only upon the tanned faces of  soldiers.
  Both he and Dalton were at home in a half-hour. People in the Old  South then, as in the New South now, are closely united by ties of  kinship which are acknowledged as far as they run. One is usually a  member of a huge clan and has all the privileges that clanship can  confer. Kentucky was the daughter of Virginia, and mother and daughter  were fond of each other, as they are to-day.
  After the third dance Harry was sitting with Rosamond Lawrence of  Petersburg in a window seat. She was a slender blonde girl, and the  dancing had made the pink in her cheeks deepen into a flush.
  &#8220;You're from Kentucky, I know,&#8221; said Miss Lawrence, &#8220;but you haven't  yet told me your town.&#8221;
  &#8220;Pendleton. It's small but it's on the map. My father is a colonel  in the Western army.&#8221;
  &#8220;Aren't you a Virginian by blood? Most all Kentuckians are.&#8221;
  &#8220;Partly. My great grandfather, though, was born in Maryland.&#8221;
  &#8220;What was his name, Lieutenant Kenton?&#8221;
  &#8220;Henry Ware!&#8221;
  &#8220;Henry Ware! Kentucky's first and greatest governor.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, he was my great grandfather. I'm proud to be his descendant.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should think you would be.&#8221;
  &#8220;But his wife, who was Lucy Upton, my great grandmother, was of  Virginia blood, and all of the next two generations intermarried with  people of Virginia stock.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you are a Kentuckian and a Virginian, too. I knew it! You have  a middle name, haven't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you tell me what it is?&#8221;
  &#8220;Cary.&#8221;
  The girl laughed.
  &#8220;Harry Cary Kenton. Why Cary is one of our best old Virginia names.  Will you tell me too what was your mother's name before she was  married?&#8221;
  &#8220;Parham.&#8221;
  &#8220;Another. Oh, all this unravels finely. And what was your  grandmother's name?&#8221;
  &#8220;Brent.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing could be more Virginian than Brent. Oh, you're one of us,  Lieutenant Kenton, a real Virginian of the true blood.&#8221;
  &#8220;And heart and soul too!&#8221; giving her one of his finest young  military glances.
  She laughed. It was only quick friendship between them and no more,  and a half-hour later he was dancing with another Virginia girl, not so  blonde, but just as handsome, and their talk was quite as friendly. Her  name was Lockridge, and as they sat down near the musicians to rest,  and listen a while, Harry saw a figure, slender and black-robed, pass.  He knew at once who she was, and it had been predicted that he might  meet her there, but she had stirred his curiosity a little, and  thinking he might obtain further information he asked Miss Lockridge:
  &#8220;Who is the woman who just passed us?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's Miss Carden, Miss Henrietta Carden, a sewing woman, very  capable too, who always helps at the big balls. Mrs. Curtis relies  greatly upon her. The door through which she went leads to the ladies'  dressing-room.&#8221;
  &#8220;A native of Richmond?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know. But why are you so curious about a sewing woman,  Lieutenant Kenton?&#8221;
  Harry flushed. There was a faint tinge of rebuke in her words, and  he knew that he merited it.
  &#8220;It was just an idle question,&#8221; he replied quickly, and with an air  of indifference. &#8220;I noticed her on the train when we came into the  capital, and we are so little used to women that we are inquisitive  about every one whom we see. Why, Miss Lockridge, I didn't realize  until I came to this ball that women could be so extraordinarily  beautiful. Every one of you looks like an angel, just lowered gently  from Heaven.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you're not merely a flatterer then it's long absence that gives  charm. I assure you, Lieutenant Kenton, that we're very, very common  clay. You should see us eat.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll get you an ice at once.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, I don't mean that. I mean substantial things!&#8221;
  &#8220;A healthy appetite doesn't keep a girl from being an angel.&#8221;
  &#8220;When men marry us they find out that we're not angels.&#8221;
  &#8220;The word 'angel' is with me merely a figure of speech. I don't want  any real angel. I want my wife, if I ever marry, to be thoroughly  human.&#8221;
  Harry's progress was rapid. A handsome figure and face, and an  ingenuous manner made him a favorite. After midnight he wandered into a  room where older men were smoking and talking. They were mostly  officers, some of high rank, one a general, and they talked of that  which they could never get wholly from their minds, the war. All knew  Harry, and, as he wanted fresh air, they gave him a place by a window  which looked upon a small court.
  Harry was tired. In dancing he had been compelled to bring into play  muscles long unused, and he luxuriated in the cushioned chair, while  the pleasant night breeze blew upon him. They were discussing Lee's  probable plans to meet Meade, who would certainly follow him in time  across the Potomac. They spoke with weight and authority, because they  were experienced men who had been in many battles, and they were here  on furlough, most of them recovering from wounds.
  Harry heard them, but their words were like the flowing of a river.  He paid no heed. They did not bring the war back to him. He was  thinking of the music and of the brilliant faces of the girls whom he  loved collectively. What that Lawrence girl had said was true. He was a  Virginian as well as a Kentuckian, and the Kentuckians and Virginians  were all one big family. All those pretty Virginia girls were his  cousins. It might run to the thirty-second degree, but they were his  cousins just the same, and he would claim them with confidence.
  He smiled and his eyelids drooped a little. It was rather dark  outside, and he was looking directly into the court in which rosebushes  and tall flowering plants grew. A shadow passed. He did not see whence  it came or went, but he sat up and laughed at himself for dozing and  conjuring up phantoms when he was at his first real ball in ages.
  All the civilians had gone out and only five or six of the officers,  the most important, were left. Their talk had grown more eager, and on  the center of the table around which they sat lay a large piece of  white canvas upon which they were drawing a map expressing their  collective opinion. Every detail was agreed upon, after much  discussion, and Harry, as much interested as they, began to watch,  while the lines grew upon the canvas. He ventured no opinion, being so  much younger than the others.
  &#8220;We don't know, of course, exactly what General Lee will do,&#8221; said a  colonel, &#8220;but we do know that he's always dangerous. He invariably acts  on the offensive, even if he's retreating. I should think that he'd  strike Meade about here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not there, but not far from it,&#8221; said the general. &#8220;Make a dot at  that point, Bathurst, and make another dot here about twenty miles to  the east, which represents my opinion.&#8221;
  Bathurst made the dots and the men, wholly absorbed, bent lower over  their plans, which were growing almost unconsciously into a map, and a  good one too. Harry was as much interested as they, and he still kept  himself in the background, owing to his youth and minor rank.
  The door to the room was open a little and the music, a waltz, came  in a soft ripple from the drawing room. It was rhythmic and languorous,  and Harry's feet would have moved to its tune at any other time, but he  was too deeply absorbed in the conjectures and certainties that they  were drawing with their pencils on the white canvas.
  Many of the details, he knew, were absolutely true, and others he  was quite sure must be true, because these were men of high rank who  carried in their minds the military secrets of the Confederacy.
  &#8220;I think we're pretty well agreed on the general nature of the  plan,&#8221; said Bathurst. &#8220;We differ only in details.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;but we're lingering too long here.  God knows that we see little enough of our women folks, and, when we  have the chance to see them, and feel the touch of their hands, we  waste our time like a lot of fools making military guesses. If I'm not  too old to dance to the tune of the shells I'm not too old to dance to  the tune of the fiddle and the bow. That's a glorious air floating in  from the ballroom. I think I can show some of these youngsters like  Kenton here how to shake a foot.&#8221;
  &#8220;After you, General,&#8221; laughed Bathurst. &#8220;We know your capacity on  both the field and the floor, and how you respond to the shell and the  bow. Come on! The ballroom is calling to us, and I doubt whether we'll  explain to the satisfaction of everybody why we've been away from it so  long. You, too, Harry!&#8221;
  They rose in a group and went out hastily. Harry was last, and his  hand was on the bolt of the door, preparatory to closing it, when the  general turned to Bathurst and said:
  &#8220;You've that diagram of ours, haven't you, Bathurst? It's not a  thing to be left lying loose.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, no, sir, I thought you put it in your pocket.&#8221;
  The general laughed.
  &#8220;You're suffering from astigmatism, Bathurst,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Doubtless  it was Colton whom you saw stowing it away. I think we'd better tear it  into little bits as we have no further use for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I haven't it, sir,&#8221; said Colton, a veteran colonel, just  recovering from a wound in the arm. &#8220;I supposed of course that one of  the others took it.&#8221;
  An uneasy look appeared in the general's eyes, but it passed in an  instant.
  &#8220;You have it, Morton?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir. Like Bathurst I thought one of the others took it.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you, Kitteridge?&#8221;
  &#8220;I did not take it, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;You surely have it, Johnson?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir, I was under the impression that you had taken it away with  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you, McCurdy?&#8221;
  McCurdy shook his head.
  &#8220;Then Kenton, as you were the last to rise, you certainly have it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was just a looker-on; I did not touch it,&#8221; said Harry, whose hand  was still on the bolt of the partly opened door.
  The general laughed.
  &#8220;Another case of everybody expecting somebody else to do a thing,  and nobody doing it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Kenton, go back and take it from the  table. In our absorption we've been singularly forgetful, and that plan  must be destroyed at once.&#8221;
  Harry reentered the room, and in their eagerness all of the officers  followed. Then a simultaneous &#8220;Ah!&#8221; of dismay burst from them all.  There was nothing on the table. The plan was gone. They looked at one  another, and in the eyes of every one apprehension was growing.
  &#8220;The window is partly open,&#8221; said the general, affecting a laugh,  although it had an uneasy note, &#8220;and of course it has blown off the  table. We'll surely find it behind the sofa or a chair.&#8221;
  They searched the room eagerly, going over every inch of space,  every possible hiding place, but the plan was not there.
  &#8220;Perhaps it's in the court,&#8221; said the general. &#8220;It might have  fluttered out there. Raise the sash higher, Kenton. Let nobody make any  noise. We must be as quiet as possible about this. Luckily there's  enough moonlight now for us to find even a small scrap of paper in the  court.&#8221;
  They stole through the window silently, one by one, and searched  every inch of the court's space. But nothing was in it, save the grass  and the flowers and the rosebushes that belonged there. They returned  to the room, and once more looked at one another in dismay.
  &#8220;Shut the window entirely and lock the door, Kenton,&#8221; said the  general.
  Harry did so. Then the general looked at them all, and his face was  set and very firm.
  &#8220;We must all be searched,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know that every one of you is  the soul of honor. I know that not one of you has concealed about his  person this document which has suddenly become so valuable. I know that  not one of you would smuggle through to the enemy such a plan at any  price, no matter how large. Nevertheless we must know beyond the shadow  of a doubt that none of us has the map. And I insist, too, that I be  searched first. Bathurst, Colton, begin!&#8221;
  They examined one another carefully in turn. Every pocket or  possible place of concealment was searched. Harry was the last and when  they were done with him the general heaved a huge sigh of relief.
  &#8220;We know positively that we are not guilty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We knew it  before, but now we've proved it. That is off our minds, but the mystery  of the missing map remains. What a strange combination of  circumstances. I think, gentlemen, that we had best say nothing about  it to outsiders. It's certainly to the interest of every one of us not  to do so. It's also to the interest of all of us to watch the best we  can for a solution. You're young, Kenton, but from what I hear of you  you're able to keep your own counsel.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can trust me, sir,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I know it, and now unlock the door. We've held ourselves prisoners  long enough, and they'll be wondering about us in the ballroom.&#8221;
  Harry turned the key promptly enough and he was glad to escape from  the room. He felt that he had left behind a sinister atmosphere. He had  not mentioned to the older men the faint shadow that he thought he had  seen crossing the courtyard. But then it was only fancy, nothing more,  an idle figment of the brain! There was the music now, softer and more  tempting than ever, an irresistible call to flying feet, and another  dance with Rosamond Lawrence was due.
  &#8220;I thought you weren't coming, Lieutenant Kenton,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Some  one said that you had gone into the smoking-room and that you were  talking war with middle-aged generals and colonels.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I escaped as soon as I could, Miss Rosamond,&#8221; he said&#8212;he was  thinking of the locked door and the universal search.
  &#8220;Well, you came just in time. The band is beginning and I was about  to give your dance to that good-looking Lieutenant Dalton.&#8221;
  &#8220;You wouldn't treat me like that! Throw over your cousin in such a  manner! I can't think it!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I wouldn't!&#8221;
  Then the full swell of the music caught them both, and they glided  away, as light and swift as the melody that bore them on.
