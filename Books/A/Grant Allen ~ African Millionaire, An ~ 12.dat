When we reached Bow Street, we were relieved to find that our  prisoner, after all, had <i>not</i> evaded us. It was a false alarm.  He was there with the policeman, and he kindly allowed us to  make the first formal charge against him.    
Of course, on Charles's sworn declaration and my own, the man was  at once remanded, bail being refused, owing both to the serious  nature of the charge and the slippery character of the prisoner's  antecedents. We went back to Mayfair--Charles, well satisfied that  the man he dreaded was under lock and key; myself, not too well  pleased to think that the man I dreaded was no longer at large, and  that the trifling little episode of the ten per cent commission  stood so near discovery.    
Next day the police came round in force, and had a long consultation  with Charles and myself. They strongly urged that two other persons  at least should be included in the charge--Cesarine and the little  woman whom we had variously known as Madame Picardet, White Heather,  Mrs. David Granton, and Mrs. Elihu Quackenboss. If these accomplices  were arrested, they said, we could include conspiracy as one count  in the indictment, which gave us an extra chance of conviction. Now  they had got Colonel Clay, in fact, they naturally desired to keep  him, and also to indict with him as many as possible of his pals  and confederates.    
Here, however, a difficulty arose. Charles called me aside with a  grave face into the library. "Seymour," he said, fixing me, "this  is a serious business. I will not lightly swear away any woman's  character. Colonel Clay himself--or, rather, Paul Finglemore--is an  abandoned rogue, whom I do not desire to screen in any degree. But  poor little Madame Picardet--she may be his lawful wife, and she  may have acted implicitly under his orders. Besides, I don't know  whether I could swear to her identity. Here's the photograph the  police bring of the woman they believe to be Colonel Clay's chief  female accomplice. Now, I ask you, does it in the least degree  resemble that clever and amusing and charming little creature,  who has so often deceived us?"    
In spite of Charles's gibes, I flatter myself I do really understand  the whole duty of a secretary. It was clear from his voice he did  not <i>wish</i> me to recognise her; which, as it happened, I did not.  "Certainly, it doesn't resemble her, Charles," I answered, with  conviction in my voice. "I should never have known her." But I did  not add that I should no more have known Colonel Clay himself in  his character of Paul Finglemore, or of Cesarine's young man, as  <i>that</i> remark lay clearly outside my secretarial functions.    
Still, it flitted across my mind at the time that the Seer had made  some casual remarks at Nice about a letter in Charles's pocket,  presumably from Madame Picardet; and I reflected further that Madame  Picardet in turn might possibly hold certain answers of Charles's,  couched in such terms as he might reasonably desire to conceal from  Amelia. Indeed, I must allow that under whatever disguise White  Heather appeared to us, Charles was always that disguise's devoted  slave from the first moment he met it. It occurred to me, therefore,  that the clever little woman--call her what you will--might be the  holder of more than one indiscreet communication.    
"Under these circumstances," Charles went on, in his austerest  voice, "I cannot consent to be a party to the arrest of White  Heather. I--I decline to identify her. In point of fact"--he grew  more emphatic as he went on--"I don't think there is an atom of  evidence of any sort against her. Not," he continued, after a  pause, "that I wish in any degree to screen the guilty. Cesarine,  now--Cesarine we have liked and trusted. She has betrayed our trust.  She has sold us to this fellow. I have no doubt at all that she  gave him the diamonds from Amelia's riviere; that she took us by  arrangement to meet him at Schloss Lebenstein; that she opened and  sent to him my letter to Lord Craig-Ellachie. Therefore, I say, we  <i>ought</i> to arrest Cesarine. But not White Heather--not Jessie; not  that pretty Mrs. Quackenboss. Let the guilty suffer; why strike at  the innocent--or, at worst, the misguided?"    
"Charles," I exclaimed, with warmth, "your sentiments do you honour.  You are a man of feeling. And White Heather, I allow, is pretty  enough and clever enough to be forgiven anything. You may rely upon  my discretion. I will swear through thick and thin that I do not  recognise this woman as Madame Picardet."    
Charles clasped my hand in silence. "Seymour," he said, after  a pause, with marked emotion, "I felt sure I could rely upon  your--er--honour and integrity. I have been rough upon you  sometimes. But I ask your forgiveness. I see you understand the  whole duties of your position."    
We went out again, better friends than we had been for months.  I hoped, indeed, this pleasant little incident might help to  neutralise the possible ill-effects of the ten per cent disclosure,  should Finglemore take it into his head to betray me to my employer.  As we emerged into the drawing-room, Amelia beckoned me aside  towards her boudoir for a moment.    
"Seymour," she said to me, in a distinctly frightened tone, "I have  treated you harshly at times, I know, and I am very sorry for it.  But I want you to help me in a most painful difficulty. The police  are quite right as to the charge of conspiracy; that designing  little minx, White Heather, or Mrs. David Granton, or whatever else  we're to call her, ought certainly to be prosecuted--and sent to  prison, too--and have her absurd head of hair cut short and combed  straight for her. But--and you will help me here, I'm sure, dear  Seymour--I <i>cannot</i> allow them to arrest my Cesarine. I don't pretend  to say Cesarine isn't guilty; the girl has behaved most ungratefully  to me. She has robbed me right and left, and deceived me without  compunction. Still--I put it to you as a married man--<i>can</i> any woman  afford to go into the witness-box, to be cross-examined and teased  by her own maid, or by a brute of a barrister on her maid's  information? I assure you, Seymour, the thing's not to be dreamt of.  There are details of a lady's life--known only to her maid--which  <i>cannot</i> be made public. Explain as much of this as you think well to  Charles, and <i>make</i> him understand that <i>if</i> he insists upon arresting  Cesarine, I shall go into the box--and swear my head off to prevent  any one of the gang from being convicted. I have told Cesarine as  much; I have promised to help her: I have explained that I am her  friend, and that if <i>she'll</i> stand by <i>me</i>, <i>I'll</i> stand by <i>her</i>,  and by this hateful young man of hers."    
I saw in a moment how things went. Neither Charles nor Amelia could  face cross-examination on the subject of one of Colonel Clay's  accomplices. No doubt, in Amelia's case, it was merely a question  of rouge and hair-dye; but what woman would not sooner confess to  a forgery or a murder than to those toilet secrets?    
I returned to Charles, therefore, and spent half an hour in  composing, as well as I might, these little domestic difficulties.  In the end, it was arranged that if Charles did his best to protect  Cesarine from arrest, Amelia would consent to do her best in return  on behalf of Madame Picardet.    
We had next the police to tackle--a more difficult business. Still,  even <i>they</i> were reasonable. They had caught Colonel Clay, they  believed, but their chance of convicting him depended entirely upon  Charles's identification, with mine to back it. The more they urged  the necessity of arresting the female confederates, however, the  more stoutly did Charles declare that for his part he could by no  means make sure of Colonel Clay himself, while he utterly declined  to give evidence of any sort against either of the women. It was a  difficult case, he said, and he felt far from confident even about  the man. If <i>his</i> decision faltered, and he failed to identify, the  case was closed; no jury could convict with nothing to convict upon.    
At last the police gave way. No other course was open to them. They  had made an important capture; but they saw that everything depended  upon securing their witnesses, and the witnesses, if interfered  with, were likely to swear to absolutely nothing.    
Indeed, as it turned out, before the preliminary investigation at  Bow Street was completed (with the usual remands), Charles had been  thrown into such a state of agitation that he wished he had never  caught the Colonel at all.    
"I wonder, Sey," he said to me, "why I didn't offer the rascal two  thousand a year to go right off to Australia, and be rid of him for  ever! It would have been cheaper for my reputation than keeping him  about in courts of law in England. The worst of it is, when once the  best of men gets into a witness-box, there's no saying with what  shreds and tatters of a character he may at last come out of it!"    
"In <i>your</i> case, Charles," I answered, dutifully, "there can be  no such doubt; except, perhaps, as regards the Craig-Ellachie  Consolidated."    
Then came the endless bother of "getting up the case" with the  police and the lawyers. Charles would have retired from it  altogether by that time, but, most unfortunately, he was bound  over to prosecute. "You couldn't take a lump sum to let me off?"  he said, jokingly, to the inspector. But I knew in my heart it was  one of the "true words spoken in jest" that the proverb tells of.    
Of course we could see now the whole building-up of the great  intrigue. It had been worked out as carefully as the Tichborne  swindle. Young Finglemore, as the brother of Charles's broker,  knew from the outset all about his affairs; and, after a gentle  course of preliminary roguery, he laid his plans deep for a campaign  against my brother-in-law. Everything had been deliberately  designed beforehand. A place had been found for Cesarine as Amelia's  maid--needless to say, by means of forged testimonials. Through her  aid the swindler had succeeded in learning still more of the family  ways and habits, and had acquired a knowledge of certain facts which  he proceeded forthwith to use against us. His first attack, as the  Seer, had been cleverly designed so as to give us the idea that we  were a mere casual prey; and it did not escape Charles's notice now  that the detail of getting Madame Picardet to inquire at the Credit  Marseillais about his bank had been solemnly gone through on purpose  to blind us to the obvious truth that Colonel Clay was already in  full possession of all such facts about us. It was by Cesarine's  aid, again, that he became possessed of Amelia's diamonds, that  he received the letter addressed to Lord Craig-Ellachie, and  that he managed to dupe us over the Schloss Lebenstein business.  Nevertheless, all these things Charles determined to conceal in  court; he did not give the police a single fact that would turn  against either Cesarine or Madame Picardet.    
As for Cesarine, of course, she left the house immediately after the  arrest of the Colonel, and we heard of her no more till the day of  the trial.    
When that great day came, I never saw a more striking sight than the  Old Bailey presented. It was crammed to overflowing. Charles arrived  early, accompanied by his solicitor. He was so white and troubled  that he looked much more like prisoner than prosecutor. Outside the  court a pretty little woman stood, pale and anxious. A respectful  crowd stared at her silently. "Who is that?" Charles asked. Though  we could both of us guess, rather than see, it was White Heather.    
"That's the prisoner's wife," the inspector on duty replied. "She's  waiting to see him enter. I'm sorry for her, poor thing. She's a  perfect lady."    
"So she seems," Charles answered, scarcely daring to face her.    
At that moment she turned. Her eyes fell upon his. Charles paused  for a second and looked faltering. There was in those eyes just the  faintest gleam of pleading recognition, but not a trace of the old  saucy, defiant vivacity. Charles framed his lips to words, but  without uttering a sound. Unless I greatly mistake, the words he  framed on his lips were these: "I will do my best for him."    
We pushed our way in, assisted by the police. Inside the court we  saw a lady seated, in a quiet black dress, with a becoming bonnet.  A moment passed before I knew--it was Cesarine. "Who is--that  person?" Charles asked once more of the nearest inspector, desiring  to see in what way he would describe her.    
And once more the answer came, "That's the prisoner's wife, sir."    
Charles started back, surprised. "But--I was told--a lady outside  was Mrs. Paul Finglemore," he broke in, much puzzled.    
"Very likely," the inspector replied, unmoved. "We have plenty that  way. <i>When</i> a gentleman has as many aliases as Colonel Clay, you can  hardly expect him to be over particular about having only <i>one</i> wife  between them, can you?"    
"Ah, I see," Charles muttered, in a shocked voice. "Bigamy!"    
The inspector looked stony. "Well, not exactly that," he replied,  "occasional marriage."    
Mr. Justice Rhadamanth tried the case. "I'm sorry it's him, Sey,"  my brother-in-law whispered in my ear. (He said <i>him</i>, not <i>he</i>,  because, whatever else Charles is, he is <i>not</i> a pedant; the English  language as it is spoken by most educated men is quite good enough  for his purpose.) "I only wish it had been Sir Edward Easy. Easy's a  man of the world, and a man of society; he would feel for a person  in <i>my</i> position. He wouldn't allow these beasts of lawyers to  badger and pester me. He would back his order. But Rhadamanth is one  of your modern sort of judges, who make a merit of being what they  call 'conscientious,' and won't hush up anything. I admit I'm afraid  of him. I shall be glad when it's over."    
"Oh, <i>you'll</i> pull through all right," I said in my capacity of  secretary. But I didn't think it.    
The judge took his seat. The prisoner was brought in. Every eye  seemed bent upon him. He was neatly and plainly dressed, and,  rogue though he was, I must honestly confess he looked at least a  gentleman. His manner was defiant, not abject like Charles's. He  knew he was at bay, and he turned like a man to face his accusers.    
We had two or three counts on the charge, and, after some formal  business, Sir Charles Vandrift was put into the box to bear witness  against Finglemore.    
Prisoner was unrepresented. Counsel had been offered him, but he  refused their aid. The judge even advised him to accept their help;  but Colonel Clay, as we all called him mentally still, declined to  avail himself of the judge's suggestion.    
"I am a barrister myself, my lord," he said--"called some nine years  ago. I can conduct my own defence, I venture to think, better than  any of these my learned brethren."    
Charles went through his examination-in-chief quite swimmingly.  He answered with promptitude. He identified the prisoner without  the slightest hesitation as the man who had swindled him under  the various disguises of the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon,  the Honourable David Granton, Count von Lebenstein, Professor  Schleiermacher, Dr. Quackenboss, and others. He had not the  slightest doubt of the man's identity. He could swear to him  anywhere. I thought, for my own part, he was a trifle too cocksure.  A certain amount of hesitation would have been better policy. As  to the various swindles, he detailed them in full, his evidence to  be supplemented by that of bank officials and other subordinates.  In short, he left Finglemore not a leg to stand upon.    
When it came to the cross-examination, however, matters began  to assume quite a different complexion. The prisoner set out by  questioning Sir Charles's identifications. Was he sure of his man?  He handed Charles a photograph. "Is that the person who represented  himself as the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon?" he asked  persuasively.    
Charles admitted it without a moment's delay.    
Just at that moment, a little parson, whom I had not noticed till  then, rose up, unobtrusively, near the middle of the court, where  he was seated beside Cesarine.    
"Look at that gentleman!" the prisoner said, waving one hand, and  pouncing upon the prosecutor.    
Charles turned and looked at the person indicated. His face grew  still whiter. It was--to all outer appearance--the Reverend Richard  Brabazon in propria persona.    
Of course I saw the trick. This was the real parson upon whose outer  man Colonel Clay had modelled his little curate. But the jury was  shaken. And so was Charles for a moment.    
"Let the jurors see the photograph," the judge said, authoritatively.  It was passed round the jury-box, and the judge also examined it.  We could see at once, by their faces and attitudes, they all  recognised it as the portrait of the clergyman before them--not  of the prisoner in the dock, who stood there smiling blandly at  Charles's discomfiture.    
The clergyman sat down. At the same moment the prisoner produced a  second photograph.    
"Now, can you tell me who <i>that</i> is?" he asked Charles, in the regular  brow-beating Old Bailey voice.    
With somewhat more hesitation, Charles answered, after a pause:  "That is yourself as you appeared in London when you came in the  disguise of the Graf von Lebenstein."    
This was a crucial point, for the Lebenstein fraud was the one count  on which our lawyers relied to prove their case most fully, within  the jurisdiction.    
Even while Charles spoke, a gentleman whom I had noticed before,  sitting beside White Heather, with a handkerchief to his face,  rose as abruptly as the parson. Colonel Clay indicated him with  a graceful movement of his hand. "And <i>this</i> gentleman?" he asked  calmly.    
Charles was fairly staggered. It was the obvious original of the  false Von Lebenstein.    
The photograph went round the box once more. The jury smiled  incredulously. Charles had given himself away. His overweening  confidence and certainty had ruined him.    
Then Colonel Clay, leaning forward, and looking quite engaging,  began a new line of cross-examination. "We have seen, Sir Charles,"  he said, "that we cannot implicitly trust your identifications. Now  let us see how far we can trust your other evidence. First, then,  about those diamonds. You tried to buy them, did you not, from a  person who represented himself as the Reverend Richard Brabazon,  because you believed he thought they were paste; and if you could,  you would have given him 10 pounds or so for them. <i>Do</i> you think  that was honest?"    
"I object to this line of cross-examination," our leading counsel  interposed. "It does not bear on the prosecutor's evidence. It is  purely recriminatory."    
Colonel Clay was all bland deference. "I wish, my lord," he said,  turning round, "to show that the prosecutor is a person unworthy of  credence in any way. I desire to proceed upon the well-known legal  maxim of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. I believe I am permitted  to shake the witness's credit?"    
"The prisoner is entirely within his rights," Rhadamanth answered,  looking severely at Charles. "And I was wrong in suggesting that  he needed the advice or assistance of counsel."    
Charles wriggled visibly. Colonel Clay perked up. Bit by bit, with  dexterous questions, Charles was made to acknowledge that he wanted  to buy diamonds at the price of paste, knowing them to be real; and,  a millionaire himself, would gladly have diddled a poor curate out  of a couple of thousand.    
"I was entitled to take advantage of my special knowledge," Charles  murmured feebly.    
"Oh, certainly," the prisoner answered. "But, while professing  friendship and affection for a clergyman and his wife, in straitened  circumstances, you were prepared, it seems, to take three thousand  pounds' worth of goods off their hands for ten pounds, if you could  have got them at that price. Is not that so?"    
Charles was compelled to admit it.    
The prisoner went onto the David Granton incident. "When you offered  to amalgamate with Lord Craig-Ellachie," he asked, "had you or  had you not heard that a gold-bearing reef ran straight from your  concession into Lord Craig-Ellachie's, and that his portion of the  reef was by far the larger and more important?"    
Charles wriggled again, and our counsel interposed; but Rhadamanth  was adamant. Charles had to allow it.    
And so, too, with the incident of the Slump in Golcondas.  Unwillingly, shamefacedly, by torturing steps, Charles was compelled  to confess that he had sold out Golcondas--he, the Chairman of the  company, after repeated declarations to shareholders and others  that he would do no such thing--because he thought Professor  Schleiermacher had made diamonds worthless. He had endeavoured to  save himself by ruining his company. Charles tried to brazen it out  with remarks to the effect that business was business. "And fraud is  fraud," Rhadamanth added, in his pungent way.    
"A man must protect himself," Charles burst out.    
"At the expense of those who have put their trust in his honour and  integrity," the judge commented coldly.    
After four mortal hours of it, all to the same effect, my respected  brother-in-law left the witness-box at last, wiping his brow and  biting his lip, with the very air of a culprit. His character had  received a most serious blow. While he stood in the witness-box all  the world had felt it was <i>he</i> who was the accused and Colonel Clay  who was the prosecutor. He was convicted on his own evidence of  having tried to induce the supposed David Granton to sell his  father's interests into an enemy's hands, and of every other shady  trick into which his well-known business acuteness had unfortunately  hurried him during the course of his adventures. I had but one  consolation in my brother-in-law's misfortunes--and that was the  thought that a due sense of his own shortcomings might possibly make  him more lenient in the end to the trivial misdemeanours of a poor  beggar of a secretary!    
<i>I</i> was the next in the box. I do not desire to enlarge upon my own  achievements. I will draw a decent veil, indeed, over the painful  scene that ensued when I finished my evidence. I can only say I was  more cautious than Charles in my recognition of the photographs;  but I found myself particularly worried and harried over other  parts of my cross-examination. Especially was I shaken about that  misguided step I took in the matter of the cheque for the Lebenstein  commission--a cheque which Colonel Clay handed to me with the utmost  politeness, requesting to know whether or not it bore my signature.  I caught Charles's eye at the end of the episode, and I venture to  say the expression it wore was one of relief that I too had tripped  over a trifling question of ten per cent on the purchase money of  the castle.    
Altogether, I must admit, if it had not been for the police  evidence, we would have failed to make a case against our man  at all. But the police, I confess, had got up their part of the  prosecution admirably. Now that they knew Colonel Clay to be  really Paul Finglemore, they showed with great cleverness how Paul  Finglemore's disappearances and reappearances in London exactly  tallied with Colonel Clay's appearances and disappearances  elsewhere, under the guise of the little curate, the Seer,  David Granton, and the rest of them. Furthermore, they showed  experimentally how the prisoner at the bar might have got himself  up in the various characters; and, by means of a wax bust, modelled  by Dr. Beddersley from observations at Bow Street, and aided by  additions in the gutta-percha composition after Dolly Lingfield's  photographs, they succeeded in proving that the face as it stood  could be readily transformed into the faces of Medhurst and David  Granton. Altogether, their cleverness and trained acumen made up  on the whole for Charles's over-certainty, and they succeeded in  putting before the jury a strong case of their own against Paul  Finglemore.    
The trial occupied three days. After the first of the three, my  respected brother-in-law preferred, as he said, not to prejudice the  case against the prisoner by appearing in court again. He did not  even allude to the little matter of the ten per cent commission  further than to say at dinner that evening that all men were bound  to protect their own interests--as secretaries or as principals.  This I took for forgiveness; and I continued diligently to attend  the trial, and watch the case in my employer's interest.    
The defence was ingenious, even if somewhat halting. It consisted  simply of an attempt to prove throughout that Charles and I had made  our prisoner the victim of a mistaken identity. Finglemore put into  the box the ingenuous original of the little curate--the Reverend  Septimus Porkington, as it turned out, a friend of his family; and  he showed that it was the Reverend Septimus himself who had sat to  a photographer in Baker Street for the portrait which Charles too  hastily identified as that of Colonel Clay in his personification of  Mr. Richard Brabazon. He further elicited the fact that the portrait  of the Count von Lebenstein was really taken from Dr. Julius Keppel,  a Tyrolese music-master, residing at Balham, whom he put into the  box, and who was well known, as it chanced, to the foreman of the  jury. Gradually he made it clear to us that no portraits existed of  Colonel Clay at all, except Dolly Lingfield's--so it dawned upon  me by degrees that even Dr. Beddersley could only have been misled  if we had succeeded in finding for him the alleged photographs of  Colonel Clay as the count and the curate, which had been shown us  by Medhurst. Altogether, the prisoner based his defence upon the  fact that no more than two witnesses directly identified him; while  one of those two had positively sworn that he recognised as the  prisoner's two portraits which turned out, by independent evidence,  to be taken from other people!    
The judge summed up in a caustic way which was pleasant to neither  party. He asked the jury to dismiss from their minds entirely the  impression created by what he frankly described as "Sir Charles  Vandrift's obvious dishonesty." They must not allow the fact that he  was a millionaire--and a particularly shady one--to prejudice their  feelings in favour of the prisoner. Even the richest--and vilest--of  men must be protected. Besides, this was a public question. If a  rogue cheated a rogue, he must still be punished. If a murderer  stabbed or shot a murderer, he must still be hung for it. Society  must see that the worst of thieves were not preyed upon by others.  Therefore, the proved facts that Sir Charles Vandrift, with all his  millions, had meanly tried to cheat the prisoner, or some other poor  person, out of valuable diamonds--had basely tried to juggle Lord  Craig-Ellachie's mines into his own hands--had vilely tried to bribe  a son to betray his father--had directly tried, by underhand means,  to save his own money, at the risk of destroying the wealth of  others who trusted to his probity--these proved facts must not  blind them to the truth that the prisoner at the bar (if he were  really Colonel Clay) was an abandoned swindler. To that point alone  they must confine their attention; and <i>if</i> they were convinced that  the prisoner was shown to be the self-same man who appeared on  various occasions as David Granton, as Von Lebenstein, as Medhurst,  as Schleiermacher, they must find him guilty.    
As to that point, also, the judge commented on the obvious strength  of the police case, and the fact that the prisoner had not attempted  in any one out of so many instances to prove an alibi. Surely, if  he were <i>not</i> Colonel Clay, the jury should ask themselves, must it  not have been simple and easy for him to do so? Finally, the judge  summed up all the elements of doubt in the identification--and all  the elements of probability; and left it to the jury to draw their  own conclusions.    
They retired at the end to consider their verdict. While they were  absent every eye in court was fixed on the prisoner. But Paul  Finglemore himself looked steadily towards the further end of the  hall, where two pale-faced women sat together, with handkerchiefs  in their hands, and eyes red with weeping.    
Only then, as he stood there, awaiting the verdict, with a fixed  white face, prepared for everything, did I begin to realise with  what courage and pluck that one lone man had sustained so long an  unequal contest against wealth, authority, and all the Governments  of Europe, aided but by his own skill and two feeble women! Only  then did I feel he had played his reckless game through all those  years with <i>this</i> ever before him! I found it hard to picture.    
The jury filed slowly back. There was dead silence in court as the  clerk put the question, "Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty  or not guilty?"    
"We find him guilty."    
"On all the counts?"    
"On all the counts of the indictment."    
The women at the back burst into tears, unanimously.    
Mr. Justice Rhadamanth addressed the prisoner. "Have you anything  to urge," he asked in a very stern tone, "in mitigation of whatever  sentence the Court may see fit to pass upon you?"    
"Nothing," the prisoner answered, just faltering slightly. "I have  brought it upon myself--but--I have protected the lives of those  nearest and dearest to me. I have fought hard for my own hand. I  admit my crime, and will face my punishment. I only regret that,  since we were both of us rogues--myself and the prosecutor--the  lesser rogue should have stood here in the dock, and the greater in  the witness-box. Our country takes care to decorate each according  to his deserts--to him, the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St.  George; to me, the Broad Arrow!"    
The judge gazed at him severely. "Paul Finglemore," he said, passing  sentence in his sardonic way, "you have chosen to dedicate to the  service of fraud abilities and attainments which, if turned from the  outset into a legitimate channel, would no doubt have sufficed to  secure you without excessive effort a subsistence one degree above  starvation--possibly even, with good luck, a sordid and squalid  competence. You have preferred to embark them on a lawless life of  vice and crime--and I will not deny that you seem to have had a good  run for your money. Society, however, whose mouthpiece I am, cannot  allow you any longer to mock it with impunity. You have broken its  laws openly, and you have been found out." He assumed the tone of  bland condescension which always heralds his severest moments. "I  sentence you to Fourteen Years' Imprisonment, with Hard Labour."    
The prisoner bowed, without losing his apparent composure. But his  eyes strayed away again to the far end of the hall, where the two  weeping women, with a sudden sharp cry, fell at once in a faint on  one another's shoulders, and were with difficulty removed from court  by the ushers.    
As we left the room, I heard but one comment all round, thus voiced  by a school-boy: "I'd a jolly sight rather it had been old Vandrift.  This Clay chap's too clever by half to waste on a prison!"    
But he went there, none the less--in that "cool sequestered vale  of life" to recover equilibrium; though I myself half regretted it.    
I will add but one more little parting episode.    
When all was over, Charles rushed off to Cannes, to get away from  the impertinent stare of London. Amelia and Isabel and I went with  him. We were driving one afternoon on the hills beyond the town,  among the myrtle and lentisk scrub, when we noticed in front of us  a nice victoria, containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We  followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine  tree that looks across the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies  descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards  the sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very  deep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot. "Poor  things!" Amelia said. Then her tone altered suddenly.    
"Why, good gracious," she cried, "if it isn't Cesarine!"    
So it was--with White Heather!    
Charles got down and drew near them. "I beg your pardon," he said,  raising his hat, and addressing Madame Picardet: "I believe I have  had the pleasure of meeting you. And since I have doubtless paid in  the end for your victoria, <i>may</i> I venture to inquire for whom you  are in mourning?"    
White Heather drew back, sobbing; but Cesarine turned to him, fiery  red, with the mien of a lady. "For <i>him</i>!" she answered; "for Paul!  for our king, whom <i>you</i> have imprisoned! As long as <i>he</i> remains  there, we have both of us decided to wear mourning for ever!"    
Charles raised his hat again, and drew back without one word.  He waved his hand to Amelia and walked home with me to Cannes.  He seemed deeply dejected.    
"A penny for your thoughts!" I exclaimed, at last, in a jocular  tone, trying feebly to rouse him.    
He turned to me, and sighed. "I was wondering," he answered, "if  <i>I</i> had gone to prison, would Amelia and Isabel have done as much  for me?"    
For myself, I did <i>not</i> wonder. I knew pretty well. For Charles, you  will admit, though the bigger rogue of the two, is scarcely the kind  of rogue to inspire a woman with profound affection.
