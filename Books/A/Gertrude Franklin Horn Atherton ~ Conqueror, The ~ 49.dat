The story of the Convention has been told so often that only the merest  outline is necessary here; those who have not before this read at least  one of the numberless reports, would be the last to wish its  multigenerous details. To the students of history there is nothing new  to tell, as may be the case with less exploited incidents of Hamilton's  career. Someone has said that it was an assemblage of hostile camps, and  it certainly was the scene of intense and bitter struggles, of a  heterogeneous mass blindly striving to cohere, whilst a thousand  sectional interests tugged at the more familiar of the dual ideal; of  compromise after compromise; of a fear pervading at least one-half that  the liberties of republicanism were menaced by every energetic  suggestion; of the soundest judgement and patriotism compelled to  truckle to meaner sentiments lest they get nothing; of the picked men of  the Confederacy, honourable, loyal, able, and enlightened, animated in  the first and last instance by a pure and common desire for the highest  welfare of the country, driven to war upon one another by the strength  of their conflicting opinions; ending--among the thirty-nine out of the  sixty-one delegates who signed the Constitution--in a feeling as closely  resembling general satisfaction as individual disappointments would  permit.    
At first so turbulent were the conditions, that Franklin, who troubled  the Almighty but little himself, arose and suggested that the meetings  be opened with prayer. After this sarcasm, and the submission of his  mild compromise with the Confederation, he sat and watched the painted  sun behind Washington's chair, pensively wondering if the artist had  intended to convey the idea of a rise or a setting. Hamilton presented  his draft at the right moment, and the startled impression it made quite  satisfied him, particularly as his long speech to the Committee of the  Whole was received with the closest attention. Nothing could alter his  personal fascination, and even his bitterest enemies rarely left their  chairs while he spoke. The small figure, so full of dignity and  magnetizing power that it excluded every other object from their vision,  the massive head with a piercing force in every line of its features,  the dark eyes blazing and flashing with a fire that never had been seen  in the eyes of a mere mortal before, the graceful rapid gestures, and  the passionate eloquence which never in its most apparently abandoned  moments failed to be sincere and logical, made him for the hour the  glory of friend and enemy alike, although the reaction was  correspondingly bitter. Upon this occasion he spoke for six hours  without the interruption of a scraping heel; and what the Convention did  not know about the science of government before he finished with them,  they never would learn elsewhere. Although he made but this one speech,  he talked constantly to the groups surrounding him wherever he moved. To  his original scheme he had too much tact to make further allusion; but  his general opinions, ardently propounded, his emphatic reiteration of  the demoralized country's need for a national government, and of the  tyrannies inherent in unbridled democracies, wedged in many a chink.  Nevertheless, he was disgusted and disheartened when he left for New  York, at the end of May. The Convention was chaos, but he could  accomplish nothing more than what he hoped he might have done; the  matter was now best in the hands of Madison and Gouverneur Morris, and  his practice could no longer be neglected.    
But although he returned to a mass of work,--for he handled most of the  great cases of the time,--he managed to mingle daily with the crowd at  Fraunces' and the coffee-houses, in order to gauge the public sentiment  regarding the proposed change of government, and to see the leading men  constantly. On the whole, he wrote to Washington, he found that both in  the Jerseys and in New York there was "an astonishing revolution for the  better in the minds of the people."    
Washington replied from the depths of his disgust:--    <blockquote>
 ... In a word I almost despair of seeing a favourable issue to the   proceedings of the Convention, and do, therefore, repent having any   agency in the business. The men who oppose a strong and energetic   government are, in my opinion, narrow-minded politicians, or are   under the influence of local views. The apprehension expressed by   them that the <i>people</i> will not accede to the form proposed, is the   <i>ostensible</i>, not the real cause of the opposition; but admitting   that <i>present</i> sentiment is as they prognosticate, the question   ought nevertheless to be, is it, or is it not, the best form? If   the former, recommend it, and it will assuredly obtain, maugre   opposition. I am sorry you went away; I wish you were back.</blockquote>    
To Washington, who presided over that difficult assemblage with a  superhuman dignity, to Hamilton who breathed his strong soul into it, to  Madison who manipulated it, to Gouverneur Morris, whose sarcastic  eloquent tongue brought it to reason again and again, and whose  accomplished pen gave the Constitution its literary form, belong the  highest honours of the Convention; although the services rendered by  Roger Sherman, Rufus King, James Wilson, R.R. Livingston, and Charles  Cotesworth Pinckney entitle them to far more than polite mention.    
When Hamilton signed the Constitution, on the 17th of September, it was  by no means strong enough to suit him, but as it was incomparably better  than the Articles of Confederation, which had carried the country to the  edge of anarchy and ruin, and was regarded by a formidable number of  people and their leaders as so strong as to be a menace to the liberties  of the American citizen, he could with consistency and ardour exert  himself to secure its ratification. After all, it was built of his  stones, chipped and pared though they might be; had he not gone to the  Convention, the result might have been a constitution for which his pen  would have refused to plead.    
Manhattan Island, Kings and Westchester counties had long since accepted  his doctrines, and they stood behind him in unbroken ranks; but the  northern counties and cities of New York, including Albany, were still  under the autocratic sway of Clinton. Hamilton's colleagues, Yates and  Lansing, had resigned their seats in the Great Convention. Among the  signatures to the Constitution his name stood alone for New York, and  the fact was ominous of his lonely and precarious position. But  difficulties were ever his stimulant, and this was not the hour to find  him lacking in resource.    
"The Constitution terrifies by its length, complexity, frigidity, and  above all by its novelty," he said to Jay and Madison, who met by  appointment in his library. "Clinton, in this State, has persuaded his  followers that it is so many iron hoops, in which they would groan and  struggle for the rest of their lives. To defeat him and this pernicious  idea, we must discuss the Constitution publicly, in the most lucid and  entertaining manner possible, lay every fear, and so familiarize the  people with its merits, and with the inseparable relation of its  adoption to their personal interests, that by the time the elections for  the State Convention take place, they will be sufficiently educated to  give us the majority. And as there is so much doubt, even among members  of the Convention, as to the mode of enacting the Constitution, we must  solve that problem as quickly as possible. My purpose is to publish a  series of essays in the newspapers, signed, if you agree with me,  Publius, and reaching eighty or ninety in number, which shall expound  and popularize the Constitution of the United States; and if you will  give me your inestimable help, I am sure we shall accomplish our  purpose."    
"If you need my help, I will give it to you to the best of my ability,  sir," said Jay, "but I do not pretend to compete with your absolute  mastery of the complex science of government, and I fear that my weaker  pen may somewhat counteract the vigour of yours; but, I repeat, I will  do my best with the time at my disposal."    
Hamilton laughed, "You know how anxious I am to injure our chances of  success," he said. "I hope all things from your pen."    
Jay bowed formally, and Hamilton turned to Madison. "I know you must  feel that you have done your share for the present," he said, "and there  is hard work awaiting you in your State Convention, but the subject is  at your finger tips; it hardly can be too much trouble."    
"I am not very well," said Madison, peevishly, "but I realize the  necessity,--and that the papers should be read as extensively in  Virginia as here. I will write a few, and more if I can."    
But, as it came to pass, Madison wrote but fourteen separate papers of  the eighty-five, although he collaborated with Hamilton on three others,  and Jay wrote five only. The remaining sixty-three, therefore, of the  essays, collected during and after their publication under the title of  "The Federalist," which not only did so much to enlighten and educate  the public mind and weaken the influence of such men as Clinton, but  which still stand as the ablest exposition of the science of government,  and as the parent of American constitutional law, were the work of  Hamilton.    
"It is the fortunate situation of our country," said Hamilton, a few  months later, at Poughkeepsie, "that the minds of the people are  exceedingly enlightened and refined." Certainly these papers are a great  tribute to the general intelligence of the American race of a century  and more ago. Selfish, petty, and lacking in political knowledge they  may have been, but it is evident that their mental <i>tone</i> was high, that  their minds had not been vulgarized by trash and sensationalism.  Hamilton's sole bait was a lucid and engaging style, which would not  puzzle the commonest intelligence, which he hoped might instruct without  weighing heavily on the capacity of his humbler readers. That he was  addressing the general voter, as well as the men of a higher grade as  yet unconvinced, there can be no doubt, for as New York State was still  seven-tenths Clintonian, conversion of a large portion of this scowling  element was essential to the ratification of the Constitution. And yet  he chose two men of austere and unimaginative style to collaborate with  him; while his own style for purity, distinction, and profundity  combined with simplicity, has never been excelled.    
Betsey was ailing, and her doors closed to society; the children romped  on the third floor or on the Battery. Hamilton wrote chiefly at night,  his practice occupying the best of the hours of day, but he was sensible  of the calm of his home and of its incentive to literary composition; it  never occurred to him to open his office in the evening. Betsey, the  while she knitted socks, listened patiently to her brilliant husband's  luminous discussions on the new Constitution--which she could have  recited backward--and his profound interpretation of its principles and  provisions. If she worried over these continuous labours she made no  sign, for Hamilton was racing Clinton, and there was not a moment to  lose. Clinton won in the first heat. After a desperate struggle in the  State Legislature the Hamiltonians succeeded in passing resolutions  ordering a State Convention to be elected for the purpose of considering  the Constitution; but the result in April proved the unabated power and  industry of Clinton,--the first, and not the meanest of New York's  political "bosses,"--for two-thirds of the men selected were his  followers. The Convention was called for the 17th of June and it was  rumoured that the Clintonians intended immediately to move an  adjournment until the following year. According to an act of Congress  the ratification of only nine States was necessary to the adoption of  the Constitution. The others could come into the Union later if they  chose, and there was a disposition in several States to watch the  experiment before committing themselves. Hamilton, who knew that such a  policy, if pursued by the more important States, would result in civil  war, was determined that New York should not behave in a manner which  would ruin her in the present and disgrace her in history, and wrote on  with increasing vigour, hoping to influence the minds of the  oppositionists elected to the Convention as well as the people at large.  Even he had never written anything which had attracted so wide admiring  and acrimonious attention. The papers were read in all the cities of the  Confederation, and in such hamlets as boasted a mail-bag. When they  reached England and France they were almost as keenly discussed. That  they steadily made converts, Hamilton had cause to know, for his  correspondence was overwhelming. Troup and General Schuyler attended to  the greater part of it; but only himself could answer the frequent  letters from leaders in the different states demanding advice. He  thought himself fortunate in segregating five hours of the twenty-four  for sleep. The excitement throughout the country was intense, and it is  safe to say that nowhere and for months did conversation wander from the  subject of politics and the new Constitution, for more than ten minutes  at a time. In New York Hamilton was the subject of constant and vicious  attack, the Clintonians sparing no effort to discredit him with the  masses. New York City was nicknamed Hamiltonopolis and jingled in  scurrilous rhymes. In the midst of it all were two diversions: the  fourth of his children, and a letter which he discovered before General  Schuyler or Troup had sorted his mail. As the entire Schuyler family  were now in his house, and his new son was piercingly discontented with  his lot, he took refuge in his chambers in Garden Street, until Betsey  was able to restore peace and happiness to his home. The postman had  orders to bring his mail-bag thither, and it was on the second morning  of his exile that the perfume of violets caused him to make a hasty  journey through the letters.    
He found the spring sweetness coincidentally with a large square,  flowingly superscribed. He glanced at the clock. His devoted assistants  would not arrive for half an hour. He broke the seal. It was signed  Eliza Capet Croix, and ran as follows:--    <blockquote>
 MY DEAR SIR: Do you care anything for the opinion of my humble sex,   I wonder? The humblest of your wondering admirers is driven beyond   the bounds of feminine modesty, sir, to tell you that what you do   not write she no longer cares to read. I was the first to detect--I   claim that honour--such letters by Publius as were not by your   hand, and while I would not disparage efforts so conscientious,   they seem to me like dawn to sunrise. Is this idle flattery? Ah,   sir! I too am greatly flattered. I do not want for admirers. Nor   can I hope to know--to know--so great and busy a man. But my   restless vanity, sir, compels me to force myself upon your notice.   I should die if I passed another day unknown to the man who gives   me the greatest pleasures of my life--I have every line you have   had printed that can be found, and half the booksellers in the   country searching for the lost copies of the <i>Continentalist</i>--I   should die, I say, if you were longer ignorant that I have the   intelligence, the ambition, and the erudition to admire you above   all men, living or dead. For that is my pride, sir. Perchance I was   born for politics; at all events you have made them my passion, and   I spend my days converting Clintonians to your cause. Do not scorn   my efforts. It is not every day that a woman turns a man's thoughts   from love to patriotism; I have heard that 'tis oftenest the other   way. But I take your time, and hasten to subscribe myself, my dear   sir,    
 Your humble and obd't servant    
 ELIZA CAPET CROIX.</blockquote>    
The absence of superfluous capitals and of underscoring in this letter,  alone would have arrested his attention, for even men of a less severe  education than himself were liberal in these resources, and women were  prodigal. The directness and precision were also remarkable, and he  recalled that she was but nineteen. The flattery touched him, no doubt,  for he was very human; and despite the brevity of his leisure, he read  the note twice, and devoted a moment to conjecture.    
"She is cleverer, even, than Lady Kitty, or Susan and Kitty Livingston,  by this," he mused. "She would be worth knowing, did a driven mortal but  have the time to idle in the wake of so much intelligence--and beauty.  Not to answer this were unpardonable--I cannot allow the lady to die."  He wrote her a brief note of graceful acknowledgement, which caused Mrs.  Croix to shed tears of exultation and vexation. He acknowledged her but  breathed no fervid desire for another letter. It is not to be expected  that maturest nineteen can realize that, although a busy man will find  time to see a woman if it be worth his while, the temptations to a  romantic correspondence are not overwhelming.    
Hamilton tore up the letter and threw it into the waste basket. Its  perfume, delicate but imperious, intruded upon his brief. He dived into  the basket as he heard Troup's familiar whistle, and thrust the pieces  into a breast pocket. In a moment he remembered that Betsey's head would  be pillowed upon that pocket at five in the afternoon, and he hastily  extracted the mutilated letter, and applied a match to it, consigning  women to perdition. Troup sniffed as he entered the room.    
"Violets and burnt paper," remarked he. "'Tis a combination I have  noticed before. I wonder will some astute perfumer ever seize the idea?  It would have its guilty appeal for our sex--perchance for t'other;  though I'm no cynic like you and Morris."    
"Shut up," said Hamilton, "and get to work if you love me, for I've no  time to write to St. Croix, much less waste five seconds on any woman."    
That afternoon he wasted half an hour in search of a bunch of redolent  violets to carry home to his wife. He pinned three on his coat.
