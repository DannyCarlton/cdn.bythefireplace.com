"The Southern Transept,<br> hardly known by any other name but Poet's Corner." 
DEAN STANLEY. 
TREAD softly here; the sacredest of tombs<br> Are those that hold your Poets. Kings and queens<br> Are facile accidents of Time and Chance.<br> Chance sets them on the heights, they climb not there!<br> But he who from the darkling mass of men<br> Is on the wing of heavenly thought upborne<br> To finer ether, and becomes a voice<br> For all the voiceless, God anointed him:<br> His name shall be a star, his grave a shrine. 
Tread softly here, in silent reverence tread.<br> Beneath those marble cenotaphs and urns<br> Lies richer dust than ever nature hid<br> Packed in the mountain's adamantine heart,<br> Or slyly wrapt in unsuspected sand--<br> The dross men toil for, and oft stain the soul.<br> How vain and all ignoble seems that greed<br> To him who stands in this dim claustral air<br> With these most sacred ashes at his feet!<br> This dust was Chaucer, Spenser, Dryden this--<br> The spark that once illumed it lingers still.<br> O ever-hallowed spot of English earth!<br> If the unleashed and happy spirit of man<br> Have option to revisit our dull globe,<br> What august Shades at midnight here convene<br> In the miraculous sessions of the moon,<br> When the great pulse of London faintly throbs,<br> And one by one the stars in heaven pale!
