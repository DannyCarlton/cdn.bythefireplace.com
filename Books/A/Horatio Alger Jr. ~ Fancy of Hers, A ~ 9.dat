  Three months before, a new minister had been appointed to take  charge of the Methodist Society in Granville. The Rev. Adoniram Fry, in  spite of an unprepossessing name, was a man of liberal mind and genial  temper, who could neither originate nor keep up a quarrel. In  consequence the relations between the two parishes became much more  friendly. Mr. Fry took the initiative in calling upon Mr. Wilson. 
  &quot;Brother Wilson,&quot; he said cordially, &quot;we are both laborers in the  Lord's vineyard. Is there any reason why we should stand apart?&quot; 
  &quot;None whatever, Brother Fry, said the other clergyman, his face  lighting up with pleasure. &quot;Let us be friends.&quot; 
  &quot;Agreed. If we set the example we can draw our people together. How  is it that they have been estranged in years past?&quot; 
  &quot;I can hardly tell you. Probably there has been fault on both  sides.&quot; 
  The two pastors had a pleasant chat, and walked together down the  village street, attracting considerable attention. Some were pleased,  others seemed undecided how to regard the new alliance, while Deacon  Uriah Peabody openly disapproved. 
  &quot;I don't believe in countenancin' error,&quot; said he, shaking his  head. &quot;We should be stern and uncompromisin' in upholding the right.&quot; 
  &quot;Why shouldn't our minister be friendly with the Methodist parson,  deacon?&quot; questioned Squire Hadley, who was less bigoted than the  deacon. &quot;I've met Mr. Fry, and I think him a whole souled man.&quot; 
  &quot;He may have a whole soul,&quot; retorted the deacon, with grim humor;  &quot;but it's a question whether he'll save it if he holds to his Methodist  doctrines.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't the Methodists and Congregationalists believe very much  alike?&quot; asked the Squire.  &quot;How can you ask such a question, Squire?&quot;  asked the deacon, scandalized. 
  &quot;But how do they differ? I wish you'd tell me that.&quot; 
  &quot;The Methodists have bishops.&quot; 
  &quot;That isn't a matter of doctrine.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it is; they say it's accordin' to Scripture to have bishops.&quot; 
  &quot;Is that all the difference?&quot; 
  &quot;It's enough.&quot; 
  &quot;Enough to prevent their being saved?&quot; 
  &quot;It's an error, and all error is dangerous.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you disapprove of friendship between our people and the  Methodists? 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the deacon emphatically. 
  &quot;Wouldn't you sell a cow to a Methodist if you could get a good  profit?&quot; 
  &quot;That's different,&quot; said Deacon Peabody, who was fond of a trade.  &quot;Tradin' is one thing and spiritual intercourse is another.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't agree with you, deacon. I like what I've seen of Mr. Fry,  and I hope he'll draw us together in friendly feeling without regard to  our attendance at different churches.&quot; 
  When Fast Day came Mr. Wilson proposed that there should be a union  service in the Methodist church, Mr. Fry to preach the sermon. 
  &quot;In the two societies,&quot; he urged, there will not be enough people  desirous of attending church to make more than a fair sized  congregation. Nothing sectarian need be preached. There are doctrines  enough in which we jointly believe to afford the preacher all the scope  he needs.&quot; 
  Mr. Fry cordially accepted the suggestion, and the union service  was held; but Deacon Uriah Peabody was conspicuous by his absence. 
  &quot;I don't like to lose my gospel privileges,&quot; he said; &quot;but I can't  consort with Methodists or enter a Methodist church. It's agin' my  principles.&quot; 
  Old Mrs. Slocum sympathized with the deacon; but curiosity got the  better of principle, and she attended the service, listening with keen  eared and vigilant attention for something with which she could  disagree. In this she was disappointed; there was nothing to startle or  shock the most exacting Congregationalist. 
  &quot;What did you think of the sermon?&quot; asked Squire Hadley, as he fell  in with the old lady on the way home. 
  &quot;It sounded well enough,&quot; she replied, shaking her head but  appearances are deceitful.&quot; 
  &quot;Would you have been satisfied if you had heard the same sermon  from Mr. Wilson?&quot; 
  &quot;I would have known it was all right then,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum. &quot;You  can't never tell about these Methodists.&quot; 
  But Deacon Peabody and Mrs. Slocum were exceptions. Most of the  people were satisfied, and the union service led to a more social and  harmonious feeling. For the first time in three years Mrs. John Keith,  Congregationalist, took tea at the house of Mrs. Henry Keith,  Methodist. The two families, though the husbands were brothers, had  been kept apart by sectarian differences, each being prominent in his  church. The two ministers rejoiced in the more cordial feeling which  had grown out of their own pleasant personal relations, and they  frequently called upon each other. 
  One result of the restored harmony between the two religious  societies was a union picnic of the Sunday schools connected with each.  It became a general affair, and it was understood that not only the  children, but the older people, would participate in it. The place  selected was a grove on the summit of a little hill sloping down to  Thurber's Pond, a sheet of water sometimes designated as a lake, though  scarcely a mile in circumference. 
  From the first, Mr. Randolph Chester intended to invite Mabel to  accompany him. The attention would look pointed, he admitted to  himself; but he was quite prepared for that. So far as his heart was   capable of being touched Mabel had touched it. He was not the man to  entertain a grand passion, and never had been; but his admiration of  the new school teacher was such that a refusal would have entailed upon  him serious disappointment. Of rivalry &#151; that is, of serious rivalry  &#151; Mr. Chester had no apprehension. One afternoon he encountered Allan  Thorpe walking with Mabel, and he was not quite pleased, for he had  mentally monopolized her. But he would have laughed at the idea of  Mabel's preferring Mr. Thorpe. He was handsome, and younger by twenty  five years; but he was, to use Mr. Chester's own term, &quot;a beggarly  artist.&quot; 
  If she should marry Thorpe she would have to live on romance and  moonshine. Artists rave about the true and the beautiful, but they do  not pay cash,&quot; Randolph said to himself, rather disdainfully. 
  Two days before the picnic Mr. Chester called at Mrs. Kent's and  inquired, in a tone of some importance, for Miss Frost. Mabel made her  appearance in the parlor without unnecessary delay. 
  &quot;I hope I see you well, Miss Frost,&quot; said Mr. Chester, with a smile  that was meant to be captivating. 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Chester; I have seldom been better.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope you are enjoying your summer in Granville.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed I am,&quot; answered Mabel heartily. 
  &quot;Where were you last summer, Miss Frost?&quot; 
  Mabel hesitated. She did not like to say that she spent the greater  part of the season at Newport, since this would probably lead to  further questions on the subject, and possibly expose her secret. 
  &quot;I was in the city part of the time,&quot; she answered evasively. 
  &quot;It must have been very uncomfortable,&quot; said Mr. Chester, adding  complacently: &quot;I have never passed the summer in New York. I should  find it quite intolerable.&quot; 
  &quot;A rich man can consult his own wishes,&quot; said Mabel. &quot;If you were a  poor school teacher it would be different.&quot; 
  Randolph Chester always enjoyed allusions to his wealth, It  gratified him that Mabel seemed aware of his easy circumstances. 
  &quot;Quite true, Miss Frost,&quot; he answered. &quot;I often feel how fortunate  I am in my worldly circumstances. You ought to be rich,&quot; he continued.  &quot;You have accomplishments which would grace a high social position.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid you flatter me, Mr. Chester.&quot; 
  &quot;Upon my word I do not,&quot; said the bachelor warmly. He was  dangerously near declaring himself, but stopped upon the brink. He did  not wish to be precipitate. 
  &quot;Are you going to the picnic on Saturday, Miss Frost?&quot; 
  &quot;I believe so. Everybody will go, and I do not want to be out of  fashion.&quot; 
  &quot;Permit me to offer my escort,&quot; said Randolph Chester gallantly. 
  &quot;You are too late, Mr. Chester,&quot; said Mabel, with a smile. &quot;Some  one has already invited me.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed!&quot; said the bachelor stiffly, and looking offended. &quot;May I  inquire who that somebody is?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly; it is no secret. I have promised to accompany Mr. Allan  Thorpe.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh! The artist!&quot; 
  The words were few, but the tone spoke volumes. It expressed  disdain, and implied that to be an artist was something exceedingly  disreputable. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Mabel, not unwilling to tease her elderly admirer, &quot;as  you say, he is an artist. He paints very clever pictures. Have you ever  seen any of them, Mr, Chester?&quot; 
  &quot;Can't say I have,&quot; answered Mr. Chester shortly. 
  &quot;He promises to be eminent some day,&quot; continued Mabel. 
  &quot;Does he? A good many promises are unfulfilled I don't think much  of artists.&quot; 
  &quot;How can you say that, Mr. Chester? I thought every man of culture  admired the pictures of Titian and Raffaelle.&quot;  &quot;Of course,&quot; said Mr.  Chester, suspecting that he had gone too far. &quot;They are the old  masters, you know. It's the modern daubers of canvas that I was  speaking of.&quot; 
  &quot;But are not some of the artists of the present day to become  eminent?&quot; asked Mabel. 
  &quot;When they have become so I will admire them. I don't think Mr.  Thorpe stands much chance of it if he wastes his time in Granville.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you don't know that he is painting a picture here?&quot; 
  &quot;I know nothing of the young man's movements,&quot; said Mr. Randolph  Chester loftily.&quot; Then I shall not have the pleasure of escorting you,  Miss Frost?&quot; 
  &quot;I fear not. I hope, however, to meet you there.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not sure that I shall go,&quot; returned Mr. Chester  discontentedly. 
  &quot;I believe Miss Bassett is unprovided with an escort, Mr. Chester,&quot;  suggested Mabel, still bent on teasing him. 
  &quot;I don't care to escort a Maypole,&quot; said the bachelor quickly.  &quot;Miss Bassett is not to my taste.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid you are very fastidious, Mr. Chester.&quot; 
  &quot;I admit that I am so. I prefer to leave Miss Clarissa to some one  who appreciates her more than I do.&quot; 
  Soon after Randolph Chester took his leave. He went from the  presence of Mabel in a very uncomfortable frame of mind. His feelings  toward the artist were far from cordial. 
  &quot;Why couldn't he go somewhere else?&quot; soliloquized Mr. Chester. &quot;I  am sure nobody wanted him here.&quot; But the idea would intrude itself that  perhaps Miss Frost wanted him. He would not entertain it. &quot;She is like  all the girls,&quot; he reflected. &quot;She is trying to bring me to the point.  So she is playing off the beggarly artist against me. I wish I could  retaliate. If I could find some other to take I might make her  jealous.&quot; 
  This struck Mr. Chester as a happy thought. But whom could he  select? There was Clarissa Bassett; but no girl in her sober senses  would think of being jealous of her. Still undecided, Mr. Chester  reached the hotel, when, to his satisfaction, he found the Raymonds, of  Brooklyn, had arrived to spend a couple of weeks. there for recreation. 
  The Raymonds included Mrs. Raymond and her two daughters. The elder  was a girl of twenty four, not pretty, but with plenty of pretension.  The younger, ten years younger, was still a school girl. The family was  supposed to occupy a very exalted social position. All that was known  on the subject in Granville came from themselves, and surely they ought  to know. They were constantly making references to their aristocratic  acquaintances and connections, and evidently felt that in visiting  Granville they were conferring a marked favor on that obscure place. 
  Randolph Chester had not a particle of admiration for Clementina  Raymond, but he hailed her arrival with great satisfaction. She was  quite a different person from Clarissa Bassett. He would invite her to  the picnic and pay her marked attention. Thus, he did not doubt, he  could arouse the jealousy of Mabel, and punish her for accepting the  escort of Allan Thorpe. 
  &quot;I am delighted to see you, Miss Raymond,&quot; he said. 
  Clementina received him very graciously. She understood that he was  an eligible parti, and she had not found suitors plentiful. The  Raymonds encouraged the idea that they were very rich, but it was a  fiction. They were, in truth, considerably straitened, and this  probably accounted for their selecting, as a summer home, the modest  hotel at Granville, where for seven dollars a week they could live  better than they allowed themselves to do at home, and keep up their  social status by being &quot;out of town.&quot; Clementina not only desired to  marry, but to marry a man of means, and it was understood that Mr.  Randolph Chester was rich. He must be nearly fifty, to be sure, while  she was only twenty four; but this would not  prove an insuperable  objection to the match. 
  &quot;How long have you been here, Mr. Chester?&quot; asked Miss Raymond  languidly. 
  &quot;Two weeks or more, Miss Raymond. I began to fear you would  overlook Granville this summer.&quot; 
  &quot;We had half a mind to go to Newport,&quot; said Clementina. &quot;So many of  our set there, you know. But mamma likes quiet, and preferred to come  here. The rest of the year, I am so gay &#151; I am sure you know what a  tyrant society is &#151; that with balls, parties, and receptions, I was  really quite run down, and our physician strongly advised some quiet  place like this. I was afraid of being bored, but since you are here,  Mr. Chester, I feel quite encouraged.&quot; 
  Mr. Chester cared nothing for Miss Raymond, but he did like  flattery, and he was pleased with this compliment. 
  &quot;I am quite at your service, Miss Raymond,&quot; he responded  cheerfully. &quot;You won't find in Granville the gayety of Brooklyn or New  York, but we have our amusements. For instance, day after tomorrow  there is to be a union picnic at Thurber's Pond.&quot; 
  &quot;How charming! I shall certainly go; that is, if ladies can go  unattended.&quot; 
  &quot;That will be quite en regle, but if you will accept my escort,  Miss Raymond &#151; &#151; &quot; 
  &quot;I shall be delighted, Mr. Chester, I am sure. May mamma go too?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly,&quot; said Mr. Chester, but he did not look delighted. 
  &quot;My dear,&quot; said the thoughtful mother, &quot;I hardly feel equal to  remaining there all the afternoon. You go with Mr. Chester, since he is  so kind as to invite you. I may appear there in the course of the  afternoon.&quot; 
  &quot;Since you prefer it, I will, mamma,&quot; said Clementina softly. No  daughter was more filial and considerate than she &#151; in public. 
  Mabel was with Allan Thorpe, watching the amusements of the  children, when she recognized Mr. Randolph Chester approaching. By his  side walked Miss Clementina, a stately figure, overtopping her escort. 
  &quot;Who is that lady with Mr. Chester?&quot; she asked, in some curiosity. 
  &quot;Miss Raymond, of Brooklyn,&quot; replied Thorpe. &quot;The Raymonds are at  the hotel.&quot; 
  &quot;She seems to be a young lady of some pretension,&quot; remarked Mabel,  rather amused by Clementina's airs. 
  &quot;Quite so,&quot; said Mr. Thorpe. &quot;She is a person of very considerable  importance &#151; in her own eyes.&quot; 
  &quot;You may be in danger, Mr. Thorpe; I believe you are fellow  boarders.&quot; 
  &quot;The danger is slight; Miss Clementina regards me as a poor artist,  quite unworthy of her attentions. Occasionally she condescends to  notice me; but in her eyes, I am an inferior being.&quot; 
  &quot;I fancy I shall be classed in the same category when she learns  that I am the village school mistress.&quot; 
  &quot;I suspect you are right. Will it materially detract from your  enjoyment, Miss Frost, if this proves to be so?&quot; 
  Mabel laughed merrily. 
  &quot;I have considerable fortitude,&quot; she replied, &quot;and I hope to bear  up under it. See, they are coming this way.&quot; . 
  Randolph Chester had not failed to notice Mabel, and it caused him  a pang of jealousy to see her under the escort of another. He meant  that she should see him, and, with Miss Raymond by his side, advanced  to where they were standing. 
  &quot;Oh, this is Miss Frost, the new teacher,&quot; he said. &quot;Let me  introduce you.&quot; 
  &quot;I believe you are a teacher, Miss Frost,&quot; said Clementina, when  this formality had been accomplished. 
  &quot;I teach the grammar school in this village, Miss Raymond,&quot; replied  Mabel demurely. 
  &quot;A very useful vocation,&quot; remarked Miss Raymond patronizingly. &quot;I  really feel ashamed of myself when I compare myself with you. I am  afraid we fashionable girls are very useless.&quot; 
  &quot;Not necessarily so. Your means  of usefulness are greater,&quot;  replied Mabel. 
  &quot;To be sure. We contribute to charities, and all that, but it isn't  like taking part in the work.&quot; 
  It would probably be extremely difficult to discover any charities  that were materially assisted by Miss Raymond, but it suited her to  convey the impression that she gave liberally. 
  &quot;I agree with you, Miss Raymond,&quot; said Allan Thorpe, speaking for  the first time. &quot;It is not enough to give money.&quot; 
  &quot;I plead guilty, Mr. Thorpe,&quot; said Clementina, ready to charge  herself with any sin that was fashionable; &quot;but really, if you only  knew how hard society girls find it to give their time &#151; there are so  many claims upon us &#151; parties, receptions, the opera. Oh, I know what  you will say. We should sacrifice our inclinations, and steal time to  do good. I dare say you think so, Miss Frost.&quot; 
  &quot;It seems to me that it would become a pleasure as well as a duty  to do something for others.&quot; 
  &quot;Excuse me, Miss Frost, but you cannot tell till you are placed as  I am. 
  &quot;Possibly not.&quot; 
  All this was very amusing to Mabel. She strongly suspected that  Miss Raymond's claims to high social position would not bear  examination. It was a novel sensation to be treated as one who had no  knowledge of the great world from which she had voluntarily exiled  herself, and she had no desire to disturb Miss Raymond in her delusion.  Mr. Thorpe also enjoyed the scene. Though he believed her to be in  reduced circumstances, he had seen her playing a brilliant part in New  York society, and he was equally confident that Miss Raymond was a  social humbug. 
  &quot;Shall we promenade, Mr. Chester?&quot; asked Clementina. 
  &quot;If you desire it,&quot; said her escort, with a show of devotion  intended to create uneasiness in Mabel. 
  &quot;May I come to your school some day, Miss Frost?&quot; asked Miss  Raymond. &quot;I should like to visit a country school.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be glad to see you,&quot; said Mabel politely. 
  &quot;Thank you so much. I will come if I can induce Mr. Randolph  Chester to accompany me.&quot; 
  Mr. Chester has already favored me with a visit,&quot; said Mabel,  smiling. 
  Clementina glanced suspiciously at her escort. Was it possible that  he felt an interest in the school teacher? 
  &quot;You will let him come again? she asked, smiling sweetly. 
  &quot;Most certainly.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you think of her? asked Mr. Chester with peculiar  interest, after the two couples had separated. 
  &quot;I rather like her appearance,&quot; drawled Clementina slightingly,  &quot;but you know there is always something plebeian about people of her  class, however they may dress.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't quite agree with you, Miss Raymond,&quot; said the bachelor,  who did not like to hear the future Mrs. Randolph Chester spoken of in  such contemptuous terms. &quot;Miss Mabel Frost is from the city of New  York, and is a highly accomplished girl. I suspect she has seen better  days, though at present reduced to school teaching.&quot; 
  Clementina was quick witted, and saw how the land lay. Having  resolved to capture the gentleman at her side, she determined to check  his evident admiration for Mabel. 
  &quot;Mr. Chester,&quot; she said, &quot;I don't wonder you are deceived. The girl  has a superficial polish, which a gentleman is not likely to see  through. I have been a great deal in society, and can at once  distinguish the counterfeit from the genuine. This school teacher has  probably received more than ordinary advantages; but blood will tell.  Rely upon it, she is a plebeian.&quot; 
  Mr. Chester did not think any the better of his companion for this  speech. He was too deeply interested in Mabel, and as strong as ever in  the determination to make her Mrs. Chester.  &quot;I fancy that this Mr.  Thorpe is very devoted to her,&quot; continued Clementina. 
  &quot;I didn't notice it,&quot; replied Mr. Chester shortly. 
  &quot;But the devotion was very marked, and I am quite disposed to think  it was mutual. Did you ever think, Mr. Chester, how interesting it is  to study love making between people of their class? And really, when  you come to think of it,&quot; she rattled on, much to the disgust of her  escort, &quot;it would be a capital match. He is a poor artist, you know,  and they would have to live in a very modest style, but she is used to  that. I do not suppose she would object to doing her own work, and of  course she would be obliged to do so at first. I hope they will invite  us to the wedding.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe there will be any wedding,&quot; said Mr. Chester  uncomfortably. &quot;He is only paying her a little ordinary attention. She  wouldn't accept him, I am confident.&quot; 
  &quot;Why wouldn't she? She can't expect a husband in your position, for  instance, Mr. Chester. She probably has low relations, and it wouldn't  be suitable or pleasant.&quot; 
  Mr. Chester thought of the baker on Sixth Avenue; but the time had  passed when even that could deter him. In spite of all that Miss  Raymond could suggest his mind was made up.
