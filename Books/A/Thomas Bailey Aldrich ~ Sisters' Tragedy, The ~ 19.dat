My mind lets go a thousand things,<br> Like dates of wars and deaths of kings,<br> And yet recalls the very hour--<br> 'Twas noon by yonder village tower,<br> And on the last blue noon in May--<br> The wind came briskly up this way,<br> Crisping the brook beside the road;<br> Then, pausing here, set down its load<br> Of pine-scents, and shook listlessly<br> Two petals from that wild-rose tree.
