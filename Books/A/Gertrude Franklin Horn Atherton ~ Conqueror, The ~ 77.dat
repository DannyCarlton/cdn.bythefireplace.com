Hamilton was not long kept in ignorance of the next tactics of his  enemies. They made their deadliest assault soon after Christmas.  Immediately upon the assembling of Congress it was suggested that the  Secretary of the Treasury be asked to furnish a plan for reducing the  public debt. Madison arose and fired the first gun. What Congress  wanted was not a plan, but a statement of the national finances. The  Federalists replied that the information would come in due course, and  that the House was in duty bound to ask the Secretary to furnish a  scheme. The Republicans, led by Madison, protested that already too much  power had been invested in the Secretary of the Treasury, that it had  exceeded constitutional limits. Moreover, he overwhelmed them with  volumes, deliberately calculated to confuse their understandings. One  Giles, who did the dirty work of the party, announced that the Secretary  was not fit to make plans, and added the numerous and familiar  denunciations. But the Republicans were outvoted, and the suggestions  were called for. Hamilton furnished them immediately. His plan to reduce  the debt was met by so strenuous an opposition from the Republicans that  it was defeated, and by the party which had been most persistent in  their detestation of the obnoxious burden. Rather than add to the  laurels of Hamilton, they would shoulder it with equanimity. But this  defeat was but an incident. The Secretary of the Treasury, as the result  of a series of resolutions, was bidden to lay before Congress an account  of the moneys borrowed at Antwerp and Amsterdam; the President to  furnish a statement of the loans made by his authority, their terms,  what use had been made of them, how large was the balance; the chiefs of  departments to make a return of the persons employed and their salaries.  Hamilton, by this time, was fully alive to the fact that he was about to  be subjected to fresh persecution, and the agility of his enemies could  not keep pace with his. He furnished the House with an itemized  list--which it took the Committee days to plod through--of his  bookkeepers, clerks, porters, and charwomen, and the varying emoluments  they had received since the Department was organized, three years and a  half before. He further informed them that the net yield of the foreign  loan was eighteen millions six hundred and seventy-eight thousand  florins, that the loans were six in number, that three bore five per  cent interest, two four and a half, and one four per cent The enemy was  disconcerted but not discouraged. Five fresh resolutions were moved  almost immediately. Impartial historians have agreed that Jefferson  suggested these shameful resolutions, and that Madison drew them up.  Giles brought them forward. In a vociferous speech he asserted that no  man could understand the Secretary's report, that his methods and  processes were clothed in a suspicious obscurity. It was his painful  duty to move the adoption of the following resolutions: That copies of  the papers authorizing the foreign loans should be made; that the names  of the persons to whom and by whom the French debt had been paid be sent  to Congress; that a statement of the balances between the United States  and the Bank be made; that an account of the sinking-fund be rendered,  how much money had come into it and where from, how much had been used  for the purchase of the debt and where the rest was deposited. The fifth  demanded an account of the unexpended revenue at the close of the  preceding year. Giles charged that a serious discrepancy existed between  the report of the Secretary and the books of the Bank--not less than a  million and a half. It had been the purpose of Jefferson and Madison to  bring forward the resolutions with an air of comparative innocence. But  the vanity of Giles carried him away, and his speech informed Congress,  and very shortly the country, that the honesty of the Secretary of the  Treasury had been impeached, and that he was called upon to vindicate  himself.    
In crises Hamilton never lost his temper. The greater the provocation,  as the greater the danger, the colder and more impersonal he became. Nor  was it in his direct impatient nature to seek to delay an evil moment  any more than it was to protect himself behind what the American of  to-day calls "bluff." In this, the severest trial of his public career,  he did not hesitate a moment for irritation or protest. He called upon  his Department to assist him, and with them he worked day and night,  gathering, arranging, elaborating all the information demanded by  Congress. When he was not directing his subordinates, he was shut up in  his library preparing his statements and replies. His meals were taken  to him; his family did not see him for weeks, except as he passed them  on his way to or from the front door. He sent in report after report to  Congress with a celerity that shattered his health, but kept his enemies  on the jump, and worked them half to death. The mass of manuscript he  sent would have furnished a modest bookstore, and the subjects and  accounts with which he was so familiar drove Madison and others, too  opposed to finance to master the maze of it, close upon the borders of  frenzy. It had been their uncommunicated policy to carry the matter over  to the next session, but Hamilton was determined to have done with them  by adjournment.    
And in the midst of this tremendous pressure arrived George Washington  Lafayette.    
It was on the first Saturday of his retirement into the deep obscurity  of his library, with orders that no one knock under penalty of driving  him from the house, that Hamilton, opening the door suddenly with intent  to make a dash for his office, nearly fell over Angelica. She was  standing just in front of the door, and her face was haggard.    
"How long have you been here?" demanded her father.    
"Three hours, sir."    
"Three! Have you stood all that time?"    
Angelica nodded. She was determined not to cry, but she was wise enough  not to tax the muscles of her throat.    
Hamilton hesitated. If the child fidgeted, she would distract his  attention, great as were his powers of concentration; but another  searching of her eyes decided him.    
"Very well," he said. "Go in, but mind you imagine that you are a mouse,  or you will have to leave."    
When he returned, she was sitting in a low chair by his desk, almost  rigid. She had neither doll nor book. "This will never do," he thought.  "What on earth shall I do with the child?" His eye fell upon the chaos  of his manuscript. He gathered it up and threw it on the sofa. "There,"  he said, "arrange that according to the numbers, and come here every  five minutes for more."    
And Angelica spent two hours of every day in the library, useful and  happy.    
One day Hamilton was obliged to attend a Cabinet meeting, and to spend  several hours at his office just after. Returning home in the early  winter dusk, he saw two small white faces pressed against the hall  window. One of them was Angelica's, the other he had never seen. As he  entered, his daughter fell upon him.    
"This is George Washington Lafayette," she announced breathlessly. "He  came to-day, and he doesn't speak any English, and he won't go near  Betsey or anyone but me, and he won't eat, and I know he's miserable and  wretched, only he won't cry. His tutor's ill at the Inn."    
The little Frenchman had retired to the drawing-room. Angelica darted  after him and dragged him forward into the light. He was small for his  age, but his features had the bold curious outline of his father's. He  carried himself with dignity, but it was plain that he was terrified and  unhappy. Hamilton gave him a warm embrace, and asked him several  questions in French. The boy brightened at once, answered rapidly and  intelligently, and took firm possession of his new friend's hand.    
"I am more happy now," he announced. "I don't like the other people  here, except this little girl, because they do not speak French, but you  are a Frenchman, and I shall love you, as my father said I should--long  ago! I will stay with you day and night."    
"Oh, you will?" exclaimed Hamilton. "I am going to send you to school  with my boys."    
"Oh, not yet, sir! not yet!" cried the boy, shrilly. "I have seen so  many strangers on that dreadful ship, and in France--we hid here,  there--moving all the time. I wish to live with you and be your little  boy."    
"And so you shall, but I am uncommonly busy."    
"He is a very quiet little boy," interposed Angelica, who was three  years his junior. "He would not move if he sat in your room, and I will  take him for a walk every day. He will die if he has to sit in a room by  himself all day."    
"I shall sleep with you, sir, I hope?" asked young Lafayette, eagerly.  "I have thought all day of the dark of to-night. I have seen such  terrible things, sir!"    
"Good Heaven!" thought Hamilton, "is it not enough to be dry nurse to a  nation?" But he could not refuse, and during the few hours he snatched  for sleep he was half strangled. By day the boy sat quietly in a corner  of the library, and studied the text-books his guardian bought him.  Betsey did all she could to win him, but he had no faith in people who  could not speak his language. Angelica, like all of Hamilton's children,  knew something of French, and he liked her and accepted her motherly  attentions; but Hamilton he adored. The moment his absorbed friend made  for the front door he was after him, and Hamilton let him run at his  heels, lest he get neither air nor exercise. He had no time at present  to take him to call on his august godfather, and, in truth, he dreaded  the prospect. Washington knew nothing of children, and his diminutive  namesake would probably be terrified into spasms.
