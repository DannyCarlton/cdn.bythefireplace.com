  For many seconds that seemed like minutes David stood where she   had left him, while Nepapinas rose gruntingly to his feet, and   gathered up his belongings, and hobbled sullenly to the bateau  door  and out. He was scarcely conscious of the Indian's movement,  for his  soul was aflame with a red-hot fire. Deliberately&#8212;with  that ravishing  glory of something in her eyes&#8212;St. Pierre's wife  had kissed him! On  her tiptoes, her cheeks like crimson flowers,  she had given her still  redder lips to him! And his own lips  burned, and his heart pounded  hard, and he stared for a time like  one struck dumb at the spot where  she had stood by the window.  Then suddenly, he turned to the door and  flung it wide open, and  on his lips was the reckless cry of  Marie-Anne's name. But St.  Pierre's wife was gone, and Nepapinas was  gone, and at the tail of  the big sweep sat only Joe Clamart, guarding  watchfully. 
  The two canoes were drawing near, and in one of them were two men,   and in the other three, and David knew that&#8212;like Joe Clamart&#8212;  they  were watchers set over him by St. Pierre. Then a fourth canoe  left the  far shore, and when it had reached mid-stream, he  recognized the  figure in the stern as that of Andre, the Broken  Man. The other, he  thought, must be St. Pierre. 
  He went back into the cabin and stood where Marie-Anne had stood&#8212;   at the window. Nepapinas had not taken away the basins of water,  and  the bandages were still there, and the pile of medicated  cotton, and  the suspiciously made-up bed. After all, he was losing  something by  not occupying the bed&#8212;and yet if St. Pierre or  Bateese had messed him  up badly, and a couple of fellows had  lugged him in between them, it  was probable that Marie-Anne would  not have kissed him. And that kiss  of St. Pierre's wife would  remain with him until the day he died! 
  He was thinking of it, the swift, warm thrill of her velvety lips,   red as strawberries and twice as sweet, when the door opened and  St.  Pierre came in. The sight of him, in this richest moment of  his life,  gave David no sense of humiliation or shame. Between him  and St.  Pierre rose swiftly what he had seen last night&#8212;Carmin  Fanchet in all  the lure of her disheveled beauty, crushed close in  the arms of the  man whose wife only a moment before had pressed  her lips close to his;  and as the eyes of the two met, there came  over him a desire to tell  the other what had happened, that he  might see him writhe with the  sting of the two-edged thing with  which he was playing. Then he saw  that even that would not hurt  St. Pierre, for the chief of the  Boulains, standing there with the  big lump over his eye, had caught  sight of the things on the table  and the nicely turned down bed, and  his one good eye lit up with  sudden laughter, and his white teeth  flashed in an understanding  smile. 
  &quot;TONNERRE, I said she would nurse you with gentle hands,&quot; he   rumbled. &quot;See what you have missed, M'sieu Carrigan!&quot; 
  &quot;I received something which I shall remember longer than a fine   nursing,&quot; retorted David. &quot;And yet right now I have a greater   interest in knowing what you think of the fight, St. Pierre&#8212;and  if  you have come to pay your wager.&quot; 
  St. Pierre was chuckling mysteriously in his throat. &quot;It was   splendid&#8212;splendid,&quot; he said, repeating Marie-Anne's words. &quot;And  Joe  Clamart says she ran out, blushing like a red rose in August,  and that  she said no word, but flew like a bird into the white-  birch ashore!&quot; 
  &quot;She was dismayed because I beat you, St. Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;Non, non&#8212;she was like a lark filled with joy.&quot; 
  Suddenly his eyes rested on the binoculars. 
  David nodded. &quot;Yes, she saw it all through the glasses.&quot; 
  St. Pierre seated himself at the table and heaved out a groan as   he took one of the bandage strips between his fingers. &quot;She saw my   disgrace. And she didn't wait to bandage ME up, did she?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps she thought Carmin Fanchet would do that, St. Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;And I am ashamed to go to Carmin&#8212;with this great lump over my   eye, m'sieu. And on top of that disgrace&#8212;you insist that I pay  the  wager?&quot; 
  &quot;I do.&quot; 
  St. Pierre's face hardened. 
  &quot;OUI, I am to pay. I am to tell you all I know about that BETE   NOIR&#8212;Black Roger Audemard. Is it not so?&quot; 
  &quot;That is the wager.&quot; 
  &quot;But after I have told you&#8212;what then? Do you recall that I gave   you any other guarantee, M'sieu Carrigan? Did I say I would let  you  go? Did I promise I would not kill you and sink your body to  the  bottom of the river? If I did, I can not remember.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you a beast, St. Pierre&#8212;a murderer as well as&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Stop! Do not tell me again what you saw through the window, for   it has nothing to do with this. I am not a beast, but a man. Had I   been a beast, I should have killed you the first day I saw you in   this cabin. I am not threatening to kill you, and yet it may be   necessary if you insist that I pay the wager. You understand,  m'sieu.  To refuse to pay a wager is a greater crime among my  people than the  killing of a man, if there is a good reason for  the killing. I am  helpless. I must pay, if you insist. Before I  pay it is fair that I  give you warning.&quot; 
  &quot;You mean?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean nothing, as yet. I can not say what it will be necessary   for me to do, after you have heard what I know about Roger  Audemard.  I am quite settled on a plan just now, m'sieu, but the  plan might  change at any moment. I am only warning you that it is  a great hazard,  and that you are playing with a fire of which you  know nothing,  because it has not burned you yet.&quot; 
  Carrigan seated himself slowly in a chair opposite St. Pierre,   with the table between them. 
  &quot;You are wasting time in attempting to frighten me,&quot; he said. &quot;I   shall insist on the payment of the wager, St Pierre.&quot; 
  For a moment St. Pierre was clearly troubled. Then his lips   tightened, and he smiled grimly over the table at David. 
  &quot;I am sorry, M'sieu David. I like you. You are a fighting man and   no coward, and I should like to travel shoulder to shoulder with  you  in many things. And such a thing might be, for you do not  understand.  I tell you it would have been many times better for  you had I whipped  you out there, and it had been you&#8212;and not me&#8212;  to pay the wager!&quot; 
  &quot;It is Roger Audemard I am interested in, St. Pierre. Why do you   hesitate?&quot; 
  &quot;I? Hesitate? I am not hesitating, m'sieu. I am giving you a   chance.&quot; He leaned forward, his great arms bent on the table. &quot;And   you insist, M'sieu David?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I insist.&quot; 
  Slowly the fingers of St. Pierre's hands closed into knotted   fists, and he said in a low voice, &quot;Then I will pay, m'sieu. <I>I</I>  AM ROGER AUDEMARD!&quot;
