On the 13th of December Hamilton sent to the House of Representatives  his second Report on Public Credit--no longer a nomen of bitter  sarcasm--and the Report in favour of a National Bank. Congress was once  more on edge. Since his first Great Report, it had considered and  wrangled over his successive Reports on State Debits and Credits, West  Point, Public Lands, Estimates, and Renewal of Certificates; and it had  lived through the hot summer on the prospect of the excitement which the  bold and creative Secretary would surely provide. Even his enemies loved  Hamilton in their way, for life was torpid when he rested on his  labours.    
The anti-Federalists, had they needed an additional incentive for the  coming battle, a condition to rouse all their strength and mettle, found  it in the rapidly increasing prosperity of the country, which had raised  Hamilton to a height of popularity from which it would be an historic  triumph to drag him down. He was, indeed, almost at the zenith of a  reputation which few men have achieved. From end to end of the Union his  name was on every lip, sometimes coupled with a hiss, but oftener with  every expression of honour and admiration that the language could  furnish. Even in the South he had his followers, and in the North and  East it was hardly worth a man's nose to abuse him. He was a magician,  who could make the fortunes of any man quick enough to seize his  opportunities, and the saviour of the national honour and fortunes. His  fame obscured that of Washington, and abroad he was by far the most  interesting and significant figure in the young country. No wonder the  anti-Federalists trembled for the future, and with all the vigour of  hardened muscles fought his scheme for allying the moneyed classes with  the Government.    
Hamilton made no secret of his design so closely to attach the wealthy  men of the country to the central Government that they must stand or  fall with it, coming to its rescue in every crisis; and time has  vindicated his far-sighted policy. But when the National Bank was in the  preliminary stages of its journey, certain of its hosts in Congress saw  but another horrid menace to the liberties of the people, another step  toward the final establishment of a monarchy after the British pattern.  The old arguments of subservience to British institutions in the matter  of funding, and other successful pets of the Secretary, were dragged  forth and wrangled over, in connection with this new and doubly  pernicious measure of a National Bank.    
Hamilton recommended that a number of subscribers should be incorporated  into a bank, to be known as the Bank of the United States; the capital  to be ten million dollars; the number of shares twenty-five thousand;  the par value of each share four hundred dollars; the Government to  become a subscriber to the amount of two millions, and to require in  return a loan of an equal sum, payable in ten yearly instalments of two  hundred thousand dollars each. The rest of the capital stock would be  open to the public, to be paid for, one-quarter in gold and silver, and  three-quarters in the six or three per cent certificates of the national  debt. The life of the bank was to end in 1811. As an inducement for  prompt subscriptions a pledge would be given that for twenty years to  come Congress would incorporate no other.    
It is odd reading for us, with a bank in every street, not only those  old diatribes in Congress against banks of all sorts, but Hamilton's  elaborate arguments in favour of banks in general, the benefits and  conveniences they confer upon individuals as well as nations. But in  those days there were but three banks in the Union, and each had been  established against violent opposition, Hamilton, in particular, having  carried the Bank of New York through by unremitting personal effort. The  average man preferred his stocking. Representatives from backwoods  districts were used to such circulating mediums as military warrants,  guard certificates, horses, cattle, cow-bells, land, and whiskey. They  looked askance at a bank as a sort of whirlpool into which wealth would  disappear, and bolt out at the bottom into the pockets of a few  individuals who understood what was beyond the average intellect. But by  far the most disquieting objection brought forward against this plan of  the Secretary's was its alleged unconstitutionality.    
Monroe, although a new man, and speaking seldom, exerted a systematic  opposition in the Senate, and Madison, in the House, argued, with  lucidity and persistence, that the Constitution had no power to grant a  charter to any such institution as the Secretary proposed. Others argued  that the success of this new scheme would infringe upon the rights of  the States, and still others thundered the everlasting accusations of  monarchical design. Nevertheless, the bill for granting the required  charter passed both Houses by a handsome majority. The able Federalists  had contemptuously dissected the arguments against it with greater skill  than even Madison could command; and confidence in Hamilton, by this  time, practically was a religion. The bill was sent to Washington to  sign or veto, and the anti-Federalists, disconcerted and alarmed by  their signal defeat in Congress, rested their final hope on Jefferson.    
The President, according to law, had but ten days in which to sign or  veto a bill: if he hesitated but a moment beyond the constitutional  limit, the bill became a law without his signature. It may safely be  said that these ten days were the most miserable of Washington's life so  far, although they were but the forerunner of many to come.    
By this time the Cabinet had acquired the habit of assembling for  conference about a council table in the President's house. Washington  sat at the head of the table, with Hamilton on his left, and Jefferson  on his right. Knox, who would have frowned upon the Almighty had he  contradicted Hamilton, sat beside his Captain. Randolph sat opposite,  his principles with Jefferson, but his intellect so given to  hair-splitting, that in critical moments this passion to weigh every  side of a proposition in turn frequently resulted in the wrench of a  concession by Hamilton, while Jefferson fumed. As time went on,  Washington fell into the habit of extending his long arms upon the table  in front of him, and clasping his imposing hands in the manner of a  rampart.    
Jefferson began a tentative showing of his colours while the bill was  fighting its stormy way through Congress, and Hamilton was a brief while  perceiving his drift and appreciating his implacable enmity. The first  time that Jefferson encountered the lightning in Hamilton's eye, the  quivering of his nostril, as he half rose from his chair under the  sudden recognition of what he was to expect, his legs slid forward  limply, and he turned his head toward the door. Washington suppressed a  smile, but it was long before he smiled again, Hamilton would have no  hints and innuendoes; he forced his enemy to show his hand. But although  he wrung from Jefferson his opposition to the Bank and to every scheme  the Secretary of the Treasury had proposed, he could not drag him into  the open. Jefferson was deprecating, politely determined to serve the  country in his own way, lost in admiration of this opponent's intellect,  but forced to admit his mistakes--the mistakes of a too ardent mind. The  more bitter and caustic the sarcasms that leaped from Hamilton's tongue,  the more suave he grew, for placidity was his only weapon of  self-preservation; a war of words with Hamilton, and he would be made  ridiculous in the presence of his colleagues and Washington.  Occasionally the volcano flared through his pale eyes, and betrayed such  hate and resentment that Washington elevated his hands an inch. The  President sat like a stoic, with a tornado on one side of him and a  growling Vesuvius on the other, and exhibited an impartiality, in spite  of the fact that Jefferson daily betrayed his hostility to the  Administration, which revealed but another of his superhuman attributes.  But there is a psychological manifestation of mental bias, no matter  what the control, and some men are sensitive enough to feel it.  Jefferson was quite aware that Washington loved Hamilton and believed in  him thoroughly, and he felt the concealed desire to side openly with the  Secretary to whom, practically, had been given the reins of government.  Washington, rather than show open favouritism, even to Hamilton, to whom  he felt the profoundest gratitude, would have resigned his high office;  but the desire was in his head, and Jefferson felt it. The campaign  open, he kept up a nagging siege upon Washington's convictions in favour  of his aggressive Secretary's measures, finding constant excuses to be  alone with the President. Hamilton, on the other hand, dismissed the  subject when left alone with Washington, unless responding to a demand.  He frequently remained to the midday meal with the family, and was as  gay and lively as if Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were in the limbo to  which he gladly would have consigned them. His nature was mercurial in  one, at least, of its essences, and a sudden let-down, followed by  congenial company, restored his equilibrium at once. But Washington  watched the development of the blackness and violence of his deeper  passions with uneasiness and regret, finally with alarm.    
Hamilton, in truth, was roused to his dregs. The sneaking retreat of  Madison from his standard and affections, the rancorous enmity of  Monroe, with whom he had fought side by side and been well with whenever  they had been thrown together in the bitter winters of inaction; the  slow, cool, determined, deadly opposition of Jefferson, whom he  recognized as a giant in intellect and despised as a man with that hot  contempt for the foe who will not strip and fight in the open, which  whips a passionate nature to the point of fury, had converted Hamilton  into a colossus of hate which, as Madison had intimated, far surpassed  the best endeavours of the powerful trio. He hated harder, for he had  more to hate with,--stronger and deeper passions, ampler resources in  his intellect, and an energy of temperament which Jefferson and Madison,  recruited by Monroe, could not outweigh. He saw that he was in for the  battle of his life, and that its finish might be deferred for years;  for he made no such mistake as to underrate the strength and resources  of this triple enemy; he knew that it would last until one or the other  were worn out. Hamilton had no thought of defeat; he never contemplated  it for a moment; his faith in himself and in the wisdom of his measures  was absolute; what he looked forward to with the deepest irritation was  the persistent opposition, the clogging of his wheels of progress, the  constant personal attacks which might weaken him with the country before  his multitudinous objects should be accomplished. He suggested resource  after resource to his faithful and brilliant disciples in Congress, and  he determined to force Jefferson to leave the Cabinet.    
"If he only would take himself out of that room with a defiant admission  that he intended to head the opposite party and fight me to the death!"  he exclaimed to Mrs. Croix, one day. "What right has he to sit there at  Washington's hand, a member of his Cabinet, ostensibly in its first  place, and at war with every measure of the Administration? He cannot  oppose me without involving the President, under whom he holds office,  and if he had a grain of decent feeling he would resign rather than  occupy such an anomalous position."    
"He intends to force you to resign."    
"You don't mean to say that he is coming here?" asked Hamilton, in  disgust. "Who next?"    
"Mr. Jefferson succumbed quite three weeks ago," said Mrs. Croix, gaily.  "He amuses me, and I am instilling the conviction that no human being  can force you to do anything you don't want to do, and that the sooner  he retreats gracefully the better."    
Hamilton shrugged his shoulders and made no answer. He had ceased  remonstrance long since. If it pleased her to think she was fighting the  battles he was forced to fight with undiminished vigour himself, he  should be the last to interfere with her amusement. She was a born  intrigante, and would have been miserable freckling her complexion in  the open sunlight. He was too grateful to her at this time to risk a  quarrel, or to condemn her for any of her violations of masculine  standards. It was to her he poured out his wrath, after an encounter  with Jefferson which had roused him too viciously for reaction at  Washington's board or at his own. His wife he spared in every way. Not  only was her delicate health taxed to the utmost with social duties  which could not be avoided, the management of her household affairs, and  an absorbing and frequently ailing family, but he would have controlled  himself had he burst, before he would have terrified her with a glimpse  of passions of whose existence she had not a suspicion. To her and his  family he was ever the most amiable and indulgent of men, giving them  every spare moment he could command, and as delighted as a schoolboy  with a holiday, when he could spend an hour in the nursery, an evening  with his wife, or take a ramble through the woods with his boys. He took  a deep pride in his son Philip, directed his studies and habits, and was  as pleased with every evidence of his progress as had he seen Madison  riding a rail in a coat of tar and feathers. He coddled and petted the  entire family, particularly his little daughter Angelica, and they  adored him, and knew naught of his depths.    
But Mrs. Croix knew them. In her management of Hamilton she made few  mistakes, passionately as she loved him. It was in her secluded presence  he stormed himself cool, was indignantly sympathized with first, then  advised, then soothed. He was made to understand that the more he  revealed the black and implacable deeps of his nature, the more was he  worshipped, the more keen the response from other and not dissimilar  deeps. His wife was necessary to him in many ways, his Egeria in many  more. Although he would have sacrificed the last to the first, had it  come to an issue, he would have felt as if one-half of him had been  cruelly divorced. Few women understand this dual nature in men, and few  are the men who do not. It has been known to exist in those who make no  pretensions to genius, and in Hamilton was as natural as the versatility  of his intellect. When with one he locked the other in the recesses of  his mind as successfully as when at college he had accomplished  herculean feats of mental accumulation by keeping but one thing before  his thought at a time. What he wanted he would have, so long as his  family were in no way affected; and had it not been for Mrs. Croix at  this time, it might have been worse for Betsey. She cooled his fevers;  her counsel was always sound. And her rooms and herself were beautiful.  She had her way of banishing the world by drawing her soft blue curtains  and lighting her many candles. Had she been a fool, Hamilton would have  tired of her in a month; as it was, he often thought of her as the most  confidential and dispensing of his friends, and no more.    
During the preceding two years of their acquaintance there had been many  quarrels, caused by furious bursts of temper on the part of the lady,  when Hamilton forgot her for a month or more. There were times when she  was the solitary woman of Earth, and others when she might have reigned  on Mars. He was very busy, and he had countless interests to absorb time  and thought. He never pretended to more than a romantic passion for her,  and deep as was her own infatuation, it was sometimes close to hate; for  she was a woman whose vanity was as strong as her passions. At this  time, however, he felt a frequent need of her, and she made the most of  the opportunity.
