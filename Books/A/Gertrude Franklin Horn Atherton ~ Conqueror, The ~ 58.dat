"Nick," said Hamilton, a few evenings later as they were peeling  walnuts, "This is the night on which Mrs. Croix receives, is it not? Do  you attend? I will go with you. The lady has kindly been at pains to let  me know that I shall not be unwelcome."    
Troup pushed back his plate abruptly, and Baron Steuben burst into a  panegyric. Fish replied that he had not intended to go, but should  change his mind for the sake of the sensation he must create with such a  lion in tow. He left the table shortly after, to dress, followed by  Steuben, who announced his intention to make one of the party. The host  and Troup were left alone.    
"What is the matter?" asked Hamilton, smiling. "I see you disapprove of  something. Surely you have not lost your heart--"    
"Nonsense," exclaimed Troup, roughly, "but I have always hoped you would  never meet her."    
"<i>Have</i> you?"    
"If you want to know the truth she has pumped me dry about you. She did  it so adroitly that it was some time before I discovered what she was up  to. At first I wondered if she were a spy, and I changed my first mind  to avoid her, determined to get to the bottom of her motives. I soon  made up my mind that she was in love with you, and then I began to  tremble, for she is not only a very witch of fascination, but she has  about forty times more power of loving, or whatever she chooses to call  it, than most women, and every mental attraction and fastidious  refinement, besides. There is not a good woman in the country that could  hold her own against her. I have no wish to slander her, and have never  discussed her before; but my instincts are strong enough to teach me  that a woman whose whole exterior being is a promise, will be driven by  the springs of that promise to redeem her pledges. And the talk of you  banishes all that regal calm from her face and lets the rest loose. I  suppose I am a fool to tell you this, but I've been haunted by the idea  from the first that if you know this woman, disaster will come of it. I  do not mean any old woman's presentiment, but from what I know of her  nature and yours. You do astonishingly few erratic things for a genius,  but in certain conditions you are unbridled, and my only hope has been  that the lightning in you would strike at random without doing much  harm--to you, at all events. But this volcano has a brain in it, and  great force of character. She will either consume you, ruining your  career, or if you attempt to leave her she will find some way to ruin  you still. God knows I'm no moralist, but I am jealous for your genius  and your future. This has been a long speech. I hope you'll forgive it."    
Hamilton had turned pale, and he hacked at the mahogany with the point  of his knife. He made no attempt to laugh off Troup's attack, Troup  watched him until he turned pale himself. "You have met her," he said  abruptly.    
Hamilton rose and pushed back his chair. "I promise you one thing," he  said: "that if I happen to lose my nethermost to Mrs. Croix, the world  shall never be the wiser. That I explicitly promise you. I dislike  extremely the position in which I put the lady by these words, but you  will admit that they mean nothing, that I am but striving to allay your  fears--which I know to be genuine. She will probably flout me. I shall  probably detest her conversation. But should the contrary happen, should  she be what you suspect, and should a part of my nature which has never  been completely accommodated, annihilate a resistance of many months, at  least you have my assurance that worse shall not happen."    
Troup groaned. "You have so many sides to satisfy! Would that you could  have your truly phenomenal versatility of mind with a sweet simplicity  of character. But we are not in the millennium. And as you have not the  customary failings of genius,--ingratitude, morbidity, a disposition to  prevaricate, a lack of common-sense, selfishness, and  irresponsibility,--it is easy for us to forgive you the one inevitable  weakness. Come to me if you get into trouble. She'd have no mercy at my  hands. I'd wring her neck."    
Many people were at their country-seats, but politics kept a number of  men in town, and for this political and wholly masculine <i>salon</i> of Mrs.  Croix, Gouverneur Morris drove down from Morrisania, Robert Livingston  from Clermont; Governor Clinton had made it convenient to remain a day  longer in New York. Dr. Franklin had been a guest of my lady for the  past two days. They were all, with the exception of Clinton, in the  drawing-room, when Hamilton, Steuben and Fish arrived; and several of  the Crugers, Colonel Duer, General Knox, Mayor Duane, Melancthon Smith,  Mr. Watts, Yates, Lansing, and a half-dozen lesser lights. Mrs. Croix  sat in the middle of the room, and her chair being somewhat higher and  more elaborate than its companions, suggested a throne: Madame de Stael  set the fashion in many affectations which were not long travelling to  America. In the house, Mrs. Croix discarded the hoopskirt, and the  classic folds of her soft muslin gown revealed a figure as superb in  contour as it was majestic in carriage. Her glittering hair was in a  tower, and the long oval of her face gave to this monstrous head-dress  an air of proportion. Her brows and lashes were black, her eyes the  deepest violet that ever man had sung, childlike when widely opened, but  infinitely various with a drooping lash. The nose was small and  aquiline, fine and firm, the nostril thin and haughty. The curves of her  mouth included a short upper lip, a full under one, and a bend at the  corners. There was a deep cleft in the chin. Technically her hair was  auburn; when the sun flooded it her admirers vowed they counted twenty  shades of red, yellow, sorrel, russet, and gold. Even under the soft  rays of the candles it was crisp with light and colour. The dazzling  skin and soft contours hid a jaw that denoted both strength and  appetite, and her sweet gracious manner gave little indication of her  imperious will, independent mind, and arrogant intellect. She looked to  be twenty-eight, but was reputed to have been born in 1769. For women so  endowed years have little meaning. They are born with what millions of  their sex never acquire, a few with the aid of time and experience only.  Nature had fondly and diabolically equipped her to conquer the world, to  be one of its successes; and so she was to the last of her ninety-six  years. Her subsequent career was as brilliant in Europe as it had been,  and was to be again, in America. In Paris, Lafayette was her sponsor,  and she counted princes, cardinals, and nobles among her conquests, and  died in the abundance of wealth and honours. If her sins found her out,  they surprised her in secret only. To the world she gave no sign, and  carried an unbroken spirit and an unbowed head into a vault which looks  as if not even the trump of Judgement Day could force its marble doors  to open and its secrets to come forth. But those doors closed behind her  seventy-seven years later, when the greatest of her victims had been  dust half a century, and many others were long since forgotten.  To-night, in her glorious triumphant womanhood she had no thought of  vaults in the cold hillside of Trinity, and when Hamilton entered the  room, she rose and courtesied deeply. Then, as he bent over her hand:  "At last! Is it you?" she exclaimed softly. "Has this honour indeed come  to my house? I have waited a lifetime, sir, and I took pains to assure  you long since of a welcome."    
"Do not remind me of those wretched wasted months," replied Hamilton,  gallantly, and Dr. Franklin nodded with approval. "Be sure, madam, that  I shall risk no reproaches in the future."    
She passed him on in the fashion of royalty, and was equally gracious to  Steuben and Fish, although she did not courtesy. The company, which had  been scattered in groups, the deepest about the throne of the hostess,  immediately converged and made Hamilton their common centre. Would  Washington accept? Surely he must know. Would he choose to be addressed  as "His Serene Highness," "His High Mightiness," or merely as  "Excellency"? Would so haughty an aristocrat lend himself agreeably to  the common forms of Republicanism, even if he had refused a crown, and  had been the most jealous guardian of the liberties of the American  people? An aristocrat is an aristocrat, and doubtless he would observe  all the rigid formalities of court life. Most of those present heartily  hoped that he would. They, too, were jealous of their liberties, but had  no yearning toward a republican simplicity, which, to their minds,  savoured of plebianism. Socially they still were royalists, whatever  their politics, and many a coat of arms was yet in its frame.    
"Of course Washington will be our first President," replied Hamilton,  who was prepared to go to Mount Vernon, if necessary. "I have had no  communication from him on the subject, but he would obey the command of  public duty if he were on his death-bed. His reluctance is natural, for  his life has been a hard one in the field, and his tastes are those of a  country gentleman,--tastes which he has recently been permitted to  indulge to the full for the first time. Moreover, he is so modest that  it is difficult to make him understand that no other man is to be  thought of for these first difficult years. When he does, there is no  more question of his acceptance than there was of his assuming the  command of the army. As for titles they come about as a matter of  course, and it is quite positive that Washington, although a Republican,  will never become a Democrat. He is a grandee and will continue to live  like one, and the man who presumes to take a liberty with him is lost."    
Mrs. Croix, quite forgotten, leaned back in her chair, a smile  succeeding the puzzled annoyance of her eyes. In this house her words  were the jewels for which this courtly company scrambled, but Hamilton  had not been met abroad for weeks, and from him there was always  something to learn; whereas from even the most brilliant of women--she  shrugged her shoulders; and her eyes, as they dwelt on Hamilton,  gradually filled with an expression of idolatrous pride. The new delight  of self-effacement was one of the keenest she had known.    
The bombardment continued. The Vice-President? Whom should Hamilton  support? Adams? Hancock? Was it true that there was a schism in the  Federal party that might give the anti-Federalists, with Clinton at  their head, a chance for the Vice-Presidency at least? Who would be  Washington's advisers besides himself? Would the President have a  cabinet? Would Congress sanction it? Whom should he want as confreres,  and whom in the Senate to further his plans? Whom did he favour as  Senators and Representatives from New York? Could this rage for  amendments be stopped? What was to be the fate of the circular letter?  Was all danger of a new Constitutional Convention well over? What about  the future site of the Capital--would the North get it, or the South?    
All these, the raging questions of the day, it took Hamilton the greater  part of the evening to answer or parry, but he deftly altered his orbit  until he stood beside Mrs. Croix, the company before her shrine. He had  encountered her eyes, but although he knew the supreme surrender of  women in the first stages of passion, he also understood the vanities  and weaknesses of human nature too well not to apprehend a chill of the  affections under too prolonged a mortification.    
Clinton entered at midnight; and after almost bending his gouty knee to  the hostess, whom he had never seen in such softened yet dazzling  beauty, he measured Hamilton for a moment, then laughed and held out his  hand.    
"You are a wonderful fighter," he said, "and you beat me squarely. We'll  meet in open combat again and again, no doubt of it, and I hope we will,  for you rouse all my mettle; but I like you, sir, I like you. I can't  help it."    
Hamilton, at that time of his life the most placable of men, had shaken  his hand heartily. "And I so esteem and admire you, sir," he answered  warmly, "that I would I could convert you, for your doctrines are bound  to plunge this country into civil war sooner or later. The Constitution  has given the States just four times more power than is safe in their  hands; but if we could establish a tradition at this early stage of the  country's history that it was the duty of the States always to consider  the Union first and themselves as grateful assistants to a hard-working  and paternal central power, we might do much to counteract an evil  which, if coddled, is bound to result in a trial of strength."    
"That is the first time I ever heard you croak, except in a public  speech where you had a point to gain," said Livingston. "Do you mean  that?"    
"What of it?" asked Clinton. "Under Mr. Hamilton's constitution--for if  it be not quite so monarchical as the one he wanted, it has been saddled  upon the United States through his agency more than through any other  influence or group of influences--I say, that under Mr. Hamilton's  constitution all individualism is lost. We are to be but the component  parts of a great machine which will grind us as it lists. Had we  remained thirteen independent and sovereign States, with a tribunal for  what little common legislation might be necessary, then we might have  built up a great and a unique nation; but under what is little better  than an absolute monarchy all but a small group of men are bound to live  and die nonentities."    
"But think of the excited competition for a place in that group," said  Hamilton, laughing. The disappointed Governor's propositions were not  worthy of serious argument.    
"I do not think it is as bad as that, your Excellency," said Dr.  Franklin, mildly. "I should have favoured a somewhat loose  Confederation, as you know, but the changes and the development of this  country will be so great that there will be plenty of room for  individualism; indeed, it could not be suppressed. And after a careful  study of this instrument that you are to live under--my own time is so  short that my only role now is that of the prophet--I fail to see  anything of essential danger to the liberties of the American people. I  may say that the essays of "The Federalist" would have reassured me on  this point, had I still doubted. I read them again the other week. The  proof is there, I think, that the Constitution, if rigidly interpreted  and lived up to, must prove a beneficent if stern parent to those who  dwell under it."    
Clinton shrugged his shoulders. "I would I could share your optimism,"  he said. "What a picture have we! The most venerable statesman in the  country finding some hope for individual liberty in this Constitution;  the youngest, an optimist by nature and habit, sanguine by youth and  temperament, trembling for the powers it may confer upon a people too  democratically inclined. This is true, sir--is it not?"    
"Yes," said Hamilton. "Democracy is a poison, just as Republicanism is  the ideal of all self-respecting men. I would do all I could to vitalize  the one and nullify the other. The spirit of democracy exists already,  no doubt of it. If we could suppress it in time, we should also suppress  the aspirations of encouraged plebianism,--a dangerous factor in any  republic. It means the mixing of ignoble blood with good, a gradual  lowering of ideals until a general level of sordidness, individualism in  its most selfish and self-seeking form, and political corruption, are  the inevitable results. You, your Excellency, are an autocrat. It is odd  that your principles should coincide so closely with the despotism of  democracy."    
"Oh, I can't argue with you!" exclaimed Clinton, impatiently. "No one  can. That is the reason you beat us when we clearly were in the right.  What says Madam? She is our oracle." "If she would but bring him under  her foot!" he said to Yates. "She is heart and soul with us. I augur  well that he is here at last."    
"It is long since our fairy queen has spoken," Franklin was saying;  gallant to all women, he was prostrate before this one. "Her genius  directs her to the most hidden kernels."    
"What do you wish?" she asked lightly. "A prophecy? I am no Cassandra.  Unlike Dr. Franklin, I am too selfish to care what may happen when I am  dead. At this date we are assured of two elements in government:  unselfish patriotism and common-sense. There never has been a nobler nor  a more keenly intelligent group of men in public life than General  Washington will be able to command as assistants in forming a  government. And should our Governor lead his own party to victory," she  added, turning to Clinton with so brilliant a smile that it dissipated a  gathering scowl, "it would be quite the same. The determined struggle  of the weaker party for the rights which only supremacy can insure them  is often misconstrued as selfishness; and power leads their higher  qualities as well as their caution and conservatism to victory. I am a  philosopher. I disapproved the Constitution, and loved the idea of  thirteen little sovereignties; but I bow to the Inevitable and am  prepared to love the Constitution. The country has too much to  accomplish, too much to recover from, to waste time arguing what might  have been; it is sure to settle down into as complacent a philosophy as  my own, and adjust itself to its new and roomy crinoline."    
"Crinoline is the word," growled Clinton, who accepted her choice of  words as a subtle thrust at Hamilton. "It is rigid. Wherever you move it  will move with you and bound your horizon."    
"Oh, well, you know," said Hamilton, who was tired of the conversation,  "like a crinoline it can always be broken."
