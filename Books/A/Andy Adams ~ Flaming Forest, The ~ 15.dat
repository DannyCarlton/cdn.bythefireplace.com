  It was easy for Carrigan to guess why the riverman had turned back   for him. Men were busy about the bateau, and Concombre Bateese  stood  in the stern, a long pole in his hands, giving commands to  the others.  The bateau was beginning to swing out into the stream  when he leaped  aboard. A wide grin spread over the half-breed's  face. He eyed David  keenly and laughed in his deep chest, an  unmistakable suggestiveness  in the note of it. 
  &quot;You look seek, m'sieu,&quot; he said in an undertone, for David's ears   alone, &quot;You look ver' unhappy, an' pale lak leetle boy! Wat happen   w'en you look t'rough ze glass up there, eh? Or ees it zat you  grow  frighten because ver' soon you stan' up an' fight Concombre  Bateese?  Eh, coq de bruyere? Ees it zat?&quot; 
  A quick thought came to David. &quot;Is it true that St. Pierre can not   whip you, Bateese?&quot; 
  Bateese threw out his chest with a mighty intake of breath. Then   he exploded: &quot;No man on all T'ree River can w'ip Concombre  Bateese.&quot; 
  &quot;And St. Pierre is a powerful man,&quot; mused David, letting his eyes   travel slowly from the half-breed's moccasined feet to the top of  his  head. &quot;I measured him well through the glasses, Bateese. It  will be a  great fight. But I shall whip you!&quot; 
  He did not wait for the half-breed to reply, but went into the   cabin and closed the door behind him. He did not like the taunting   note of suggestiveness in the other's words. Was it possible that   Bateese suspected the true state of his mind, that he was in love   with the wife of St. Pierre, and that his heart was sick because  of  what he had seen aboard the raft? He flushed hotly. It made him   uncomfortable to feel that even the half-breed might have guessed  his  humiliation. 
  David looked through the window toward the raft. The bateau was   drifting downstream, possibly a hundred feet from the shore, but  it  was quite evident that Concombre Bateese was making no effort  to bring  it close to the floating mass of timber, which had made  no change in  its course down the river. David's mind painted  swiftly what was  happening in the cabin into which Marie-Anne and  St. Pierre had  disappeared. At this moment Marie-Anne was telling  of him, of the  adventure in the hot patch of sand. He fancied the  suppressed  excitement in her voice as she unburdened herself. He  saw St. Pierre's  face darken, his muscles tighten&#8212;and crouching  in silence, he seemed  to see the misshapen hulk of Andre, the  Broken Man, listening to what  was passing between the other two.  And he heard again the mad monotone  of Andre's voice, crying  plaintively, &quot;HAS ANY ONE SEEN BLACK ROGER  AUDEMARD?&quot; 
  His blood ran a little faster, and his old craft was a dominantly   living thing within him once more. Love had dulled both his  ingenuity  and his desire. For a space a thing had risen before him  that was  mightier than the majesty of the Law, and he had TRIED to  miss the  bull's-eye&#8212;because of his love for the wife of St.  Pierre Boulain.  Now he shot squarely for it, and the bell rang in  his brain. Two times  two again made four. Facts assembled  themselves like arguments in  flesh and blood. Those facts would  have convinced Superintendent  McVane, and they now convinced  David. He had set out to get Black  Roger Audemard, alive or dead.  And Black Roger, wholesale murderer, a  monster who had painted the  blackest page of crime known in the  history of Canadian law, was  closely and vitally associated with  Marie-Anne and St. Pierre  Boulain! 
  The thing was a shock, but Carrigan no longer tried to evade the   point. His business was no longer with a man supposed to be a   thousand or fifteen hundred miles farther north. It was with   Marie-Anne, St. Pierre, and Andre, the Broken Man. And also with   Concombre Bateese. 
  He smiled a little grimly as he thought of his approaching battle   with the half-breed. St. Pierre would be astounded at the  proposition  he had in store for him. But he was sure that St.  Pierre would accept.  And then, if he won the fight with Bateese&#8212; 
  The smile faded from his lips. His face grew older as he looked   slowly about the bateau cabin, with its sweet and lingering  whispers  of a woman's presence. It was a part of her. It breathed  of her  fragrance and her beauty; it seemed to be waiting for her,  crying  softly for her return. Yet once had there been another  woman even  lovelier than the wife of St. Pierre. He had not  hesitated then.  Without great effort he had triumphed over the  loveliness of Carmin  Fanchet and had sent her brother to the  hangman. And now, as he  recalled those days, the truth came to him  that even in the darkest  hour Carmin Fanchet had made not the  slightest effort to buy him off  with her beauty. She had not tried  to lure him. She had fought proudly  and defiantly. And had Marie-  Anne done that? His fingers clenched  slowly, and a thickening came  in his throat. Would she tell St. Pierre  of the many hours they  had spent together? Would she confess to him  the secret of that  precious moment when she had lain close against his  breast, her  arms about him, her face pressed to his? Would she speak  to him of  secret hours, of warm flushes that had come to her face, of   glowing fires that at times had burned in her eyes when he had  been  very near to her? Would she reveal EVERYTHING to St. Pierre&#8212;  her  husband? He was powerless to combat the voice that told him  no. Carmin  Fanchet had fought him openly as an enemy and had not  employed her  beauty as a weapon. Marie-Anne had put in his way a  great temptation.  What he was thinking seemed to him like a  sacrilege, yet he knew there  could be no discriminating  distinctions between weapons, now that he  was determined to play  the game to the end, for the Law. 
  When Carrigan went out on deck, the half-breed was sweating from   his exertion at the stern sweep. He looked at the agent de police  who  was going to fight him, perhaps tomorrow or the next day.  There was a  change in Carrigan. He was not the same man who had  gone into the  cabin an hour before, and the fact impressed itself  upon Bateese.  There was something in his appearance that held back  the loose talk at  the end of Concombre's tongue. And so it was  Carrigan himself who  spoke first. 
  &quot;When will this man St. Pierre come to see me?&quot; he demanded. &quot;If   he doesn't come soon, I shall go to him.&quot; 
  For an instant Concombre's face darkened. Then, as he bent over   the sweep with his great back to David, he chuckled audibly, and   said: 
  &quot;Would you go, m'sieu? Ah&#8212;it is le malade d'amour over there in   the cabin. Surely you would not break in upon their love-making?&quot; 
  Bateese did not look over his shoulder, and so he did not see the   hot flush that gathered in David's face. But David was sure he  knew  it was there and that Concombre had guessed the truth of  matters.  There was a sly note in his voice, as if he could not  quite keep to  himself his exultation that beauty and bright eyes  had played a clever  trick on this man who, if his own judgment had  been followed, would  now be resting peacefully at the bottom of  the river. It was the final  stab to Carrigan. His muscles tensed.  For the first time he felt the  desire to shoot a naked fist into  the grinning mouth of Concombre  Bateese. He laid a hand on the  half-breed's shoulder, and Bateese  turned about slowly. He saw  what was in the other's eyes. 
  &quot;Until this moment I have not known what a great pleasure it will   be to fight you, Bateese,&quot; said David quietly. &quot;Make it tomorrow&#8212;  in  the morning, if you wish. Take word to St. Pierre that I will  make him  a great wager that I win, a gamble so large that I think  he will be  afraid to cover it. For I don't think much of this St.  Pierre of  yours, Bateese. I believe him to be a big-winded bluff,  like yourself.  And also a coward. Mark my word, he will be so much  afraid that he  will not accept my wager!&quot; 
  Bateese did not answer. He was looking over David's shoulder. He   seemed not to have heard what the other had said, yet there had  come  a sudden gleam of exultation in his eyes, and he replied,  still gazing  toward the raft, 
  &quot;Diantre, m'sieu coq de bruyere may keep ze beeg word in hees   mout'! See!&#8212;St. Pierre, he ees comin' to answer for himself. Mon   Dieu, I hope he does not wring ze leetle rooster's neck, for zat   would spoil wan great, gran' fight tomorrow!&quot; 
  David turned toward the big raft. At the distance which separated   them he could make out the giant figure of St. Pierre Boulain  getting  into a canoe. The humped-up form already in that canoe he  knew was the  Broken Man. He could not see Marie-Anne. 
  Very lightly Bateese touched his arm. &quot;M'sieu will go into ze   cabin,&quot; he suggested softly. &quot;If somet'ing happens, it ees bes'  too  many eyes do not see it. You understan', m'sieu agent de  police?&quot; 
  Carrigan nodded. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said.
