  A little later, clasping hands in the lamp glow, Kent and Sandy   McTrigger stood alone in the big room. In their handclasp was the   warm thrill of strong men met in an immutable brotherhood. Each  had  faced death for the other. Yet this thought, subconsciously  and  forever a part of them, expressed itself only in the grip of  their  fingers and in the understanding that lay deep in their  eyes. 
  In Kent's face the great question was of Marette. McTrigger saw   the fear of it, and slowly he smiled, a glad and yet an anxious   smile, as he looked toward the door through which Marette and the   older woman had gone. 
  &quot;Thank God you have come in time!&quot; he said, still holding Kent's   hand. &quot;She thought you were dead. And I know, Kent, that it was   killing her. We had to watch her at night. Sometimes she would  wander  out into the valley. She said she was looking for you. It  was that way  tonight.&quot; 
  Kent gulped hard. &quot;I understand now,&quot; he said. &quot;It was the living   soul of her that was pulling me here. I&#8212;&quot; 
  He took his pack with its precious contents from his shoulders,   listening to McTrigger. They sat down. What McTrigger was saying   seemed of trifling consequence beside the fact that Marette was   somewhere beyond the other door, alive, and that he would see her   again very soon. He did not see why McTrigger should tell him that   the older woman was his wife. Even the fact that a splendid chance   had thrown Marette upon a log wedged between two rocks in the  Chute,  and that this log, breaking away, had carried her to the  opposite side  of the river miles below, was trivial with the  thought that only a  door separated them now. But he listened. He  heard McTrigger tell how  Marette had searched for him those days  when he was lost in fever at  Andre Boileau's cabin, how she had  given him up for dead, and how in  those same days Laselle's  brigade had floated down, and she had come  north with it. Later he  would marvel over these things, but now he  listened, and his eyes  turned toward the door. It was then that  McTrigger drove something  home. It was like a shot piercing Kent's  brain. McTrigger was  speaking quietly of O'Connor. He said: 
  &quot;But you probably came by way of Fort Simpson, Kent, and O'Connor   has told you all this. It was he who brought Marette back home   through the Sulphur Country.&quot; 
  &quot;O'Connor!&quot; 
  Kent sprang to his feet. It took McTrigger but a moment to read   the truth in his face. 
  &quot;Good God, do you mean to tell me you don't know, Kent?&quot; he   whispered tensely, rising in front of the other. &quot;Haven't you seen   O'Connor? Haven't you come in touch with the Police anywhere  within  the last year? Don't you know&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;I know nothing,&quot; breathed Kent. 
  For a space McTrigger stared at him in amazement 
  &quot;I have been in hiding,&quot; said Kent. &quot;All this time I have been   keeping away from the Police.&quot; 
  McTrigger drew a deep breath. Again his hands gripped Kent's, and   his voice was incredulous, filled with a great wonder. &quot;And you  have  come to her, to her old home, believing that Marette killed  Kedsty! It  is hard to believe. And yet&#8212;&quot; Into his face came  suddenly a look of  grief, almost of pain, and Kent, following his  eyes, saw that he was  looking at a big stone fireplace in the end  of the room. 
  &quot;It was O'Connor who worked the thing out last Winter,&quot; he said,   speaking with, an effort. &quot;I must tell you before you see her  again.  You must understand everything. It will not do to have her  tell you.  See&#8212;&quot; 
  Kent followed him to the fireplace. From the shelf over the   stonework McTrigger took a picture and gave it to him. It was a   snapshot, the picture of a bare-headed man standing in the open  with  the sun shining on him. 
  A low cry broke from Kent's lips. It was the great, gray ghost of   a man he had seen in the lightning flare that night from the  window  of his hiding-place in Kedsty's bungalow. 
  &quot;My brother,&quot; said McTrigger chokingly. &quot;I loved him. For forty   years we were comrades. And Marette belonged to us, half and half.  It  was he&#8212;who killed&#8212;John Barkley.&quot; And then, after a moment in  which  McTrigger fought to speak steadily, he added, &quot;And it was  he&#8212;my  brother&#8212;who also killed Inspector Kedsty.&quot; 
  For a matter of seconds there was a dead silence between them.   McTrigger looked into the fireplace instead of at Kent. Then he  said: 
  &quot;He killed those men, but he didn't murder them, Kent. It couldn't   be called that. It was justice, single-man justice, without going  to  law. If it wasn't for Marette, I wouldn't tell you about it&#8212;  not the  horrible part of it. I don't like to bring it up in my  memory. ... It  happened years ago. I was not married then, but my  brother was ten  years older than I and had a wife. I think that  Marette loves you as  Marie loved Donald. And Donald's love was  more than that. It was  worship. We came into the new mountain  country, the three of us, even  before the big strikes at Dawson  and Bonanza. It was a wild country, a  savage country, and there  were few women in it, but Marie came with  Donald. She was  beautiful, with hair and eyes like Marette's. That was  the tragedy  of it. 
  &quot;I won't tell you the details. They were terrible. It happened   while Donald and I were out on a hunt. Three men&#8212;white men&#8212;   remember that, Kent; WHITE MEN&#8212;came out of the North and stopped  at  the cabin. When we returned, what we found there drove us mad.  Marie  died in Donald's arms. And leaving her there, alone, we set  out after  the white-skinned brutes who had destroyed her. Only a  blizzard saved  them, Kent. Their trail was fresh when the storm  came. Had it held off  another two hours, I, too, would have  killed. 
  &quot;From that day Donald and I became man-hunters. We traced the back   trail of the three fiends and discovered who they were. Two years   later Donald found one of the three on the Yukon, and before he   killed him he made him verify the names of the other two. It was a   long search after that, Kent. It has covered thirty years. Donald   grew old faster than I, and I knew, after a time, that he was   strangely mad. He would be gone for months at a time, always   searching for the two men. Ten years passed, and then, one day, in   the deep of Winter, we came on a cabin home that had been stricken   with the plague&#8212;the smallpox. It was the home of Pierre Radisson  and  his wife Andrea. Both were dead. But there was a little child  still  living, almost a babe in arms. We took her, Donald and I.  The child  was&#8212;Marette.&quot; 
  McTrigger had spoken almost in a monotone. He had not raised his   eyes from the ash of the fireplace. But now he looked up suddenly  at  Kent. 
  &quot;We worshipped her from the beginning,&quot; he said, his voice a bit   husky. &quot;I hoped that love for her would save Donald. It did, in a   way. But it did not cure his madness, his desire for vengeance. We   came farther east. We found this marvelous valley, and gold in the   mountains, untouched by other men. We built here, and I hoped even   more that the glory of this new world we had discovered would help   Donald to forget. I married, and my wife loved Marette. We had a   child, and then another, and both died. We loved Marette more than   ever after that. Anne, my wife, was the daughter of a missioner  and  capable of educating Marette up to a certain point. You will  find this  place filled with all kinds of books, and reading, and  music. But the  time came when we thought we must send Marette to  Montreal. It broke  her heart. And then&#8212;a long time after&#8212;&quot; 
  McTrigger paused a moment, looking into Kent's eyes. &quot;And then&#8212;   one day Donald came in from Dawson City, terrible in his madness,  and  told us that he had found his men. One of them was John  Barkley, the  rich timber man, and the other was Kedsty, Inspector  of Police at  Athabasca Landing.&quot; 
  Kent made no effort to speak. His amazement, as McTrigger had gone   on, was beyond the expression of words. The night held for him a   cumulative shock&#8212;the discovery that Marette was not dead, but  alive,  and now the discovery that he, Jim Kent, was no longer a  hunted man,  and that it was O'Connor, his old comrade, who had run  the truth down.  With dry lips he simply nodded, urging McTrigger  to continue. 
  &quot;I knew what would happen if Donald went after Barkley and   Kedsty,&quot; said the older man. &quot;And it was impossible to hold him  back.  He was mad, clean mad. There was just one thing for me to  do. I left  here first, with the intention of warning the two  brutes who had  killed Donald's wife. I knew, with the evidence in  our hands, they  could do nothing but make a getaway. No matter how  rich or powerful  they were, our evidence was complete, and through  many years we had  kept track of the movements of our witnesses. I  tried to explain to  Donald that we could send them to prison, but  there was but one  thought in his poor sick mind&#8212;to kill. I was  younger and beat him  south. And after that I made my fatal  mistake. I thought I was far  enough ahead of him to get down to  the line of rail and back before he  arrived. You see, I figured  his love for Marette would take him to  Montreal first, and I had  made up my mind to tell her everything so  that she might  understand the necessity of holding him if he went to  her. I wrote  everything to her and told her to remain in Montreal. How  she did  that, you know. She set out for the North as soon as she  received  my letter.&quot; 
  McTrigger's shoulders hunched lower. &quot;Well, you know what   happened, Kent. Donald got ahead of me, after all. I came the day   after Barkley was killed. I took it as a kind fate that the day   preceding the killing I shot a grouse for my dinner, and as the  bird  was only wounded when I picked it up, I got blood on the  sleeves of my  coat. I was arrested. Kedsty, every one, was sure  they had the real  man. And I kept quiet, except to maintain my  innocence. I could say  nothing that would turn the law on Donald's  trail. 
  &quot;After that, things happened quickly. You, my friend, made your   false confession to save one who had done you a poor service years   ago. Almost simultaneously with that, Marette had come. She came   quietly, in the night, and went straight to Kedsty. She told him   everything, showed him the written evidence, telling him this   evidence was in the hands of others and would be used if anything   happened to her. Her power over him was complete. As the price of  her  secrecy she demanded my release, and in that black hour your   confession gave Kedsty his opportunity. 
  &quot;He knew you were lying. He knew it was Donald who had killed   Barkley. Yet he was willing to sacrifice you to save himself. And   Marette remained in his house, waiting and watching for Donald,  while  I searched for him on the trails. That is why she secretly  lived in  Kedsty's house. She knew that Donald would come there  sooner or later,  if I did not find him and get him away. And she  was plotting how to  save you. 
  &quot;She loved you, Kent&#8212;from that first hour she came to you in the   hospital. And she tried to exact your freedom also as an added  price  for her secrecy. But Kedsty had become like a cornered  tiger. If he  freed you, he saw his whole world crumbling under his  feet. He, too,  went a little mad, I think. He told Marette that he  would not free  you, that he would go to the hangman first. Then,  Kent, came the night  of your freedom, and a little later&#8212;Donald  came to Kedsty's home. It  was he whom you saw that night out in  the storm. He entered and killed  Kedsty. 
  &quot;Something dragged Marette down to the room that night. She found   Kedsty in his chair&#8212;dead. Donald was gone. It was then that you   found her there. Kent, she loved you&#8212;and you will never know how  her  heart bled when she let you think she had killed Kedsty. She  has told  me everything. It was her fear for Donald, her desire to  keep all  possible suspicion from him until he was safe, that  compelled her not  to confide even in you. Later, when she knew  that Donald must be safe,  she was going to tell you. And then&#8212;you  were separated at the Chute.&quot;  McTrigger paused, and Kent saw him  choke back a grief that was still  like the fresh cut of a knife in  his heart. 
  &quot;And O'Connor found out all this?&quot; 
  McTrigger nodded. &quot;Yes. He defied Kedsty's command to go to Fort   Simpson and was on his way back to Athabasca Landing when he found  my  brother. It is strange how all things happened, Kent. But I  guess God  must have meant it that way. Donald was dying. And in  dying, for a  space, his old reason returned to him. It was from  him, before he  died, that O'Connor learned everything. The story  is known everywhere  now. It is marvelous that you did not hear&#8212;&quot; 
  There came an interruption, the opening of a door. Anne McTrigger   stood looking at them where a little time before she had  disappeared  with Marette. There was a glad smile in her face. Her  dark eyes were  glowing with a new happiness. First they rested on  McTrigger's face,  and then on Kent's. 
  &quot;Marette is much better,&quot; she said in her soft voice. &quot;She is   waiting to see you, M'sieu Kent. Will you come now?&quot; 
  Like one in a dream Kent went toward her. He picked up his pack,   for with its precious contents it had become to him like his own   flesh and blood. And as the woman led the way and Kent followed  her,  McTrigger did not move from the fireplace. In a little while  Anne  McTrigger came back into the room. Her beautiful eyes were  aglow. She  was smiling softly, and putting her arms about the  shoulders of the  man at the fireplace, she whispered: 
  &quot;I have looked at the night through the window, Malcolm. I think   that the stars are bigger and brighter than they have been in a  long  time. And the Watcher seems like a living god up in the sky.  Come,  please.&quot; 
  She took his hand, and Malcolm went with her. Over their heads   burned a glory of stars. The wind came gently up the valley, cool   with the freshness of the mountain-tops, sweet with the smell of   meadow and flowers. And when the woman pointed through the glow,   Malcolm McTrigger looked up at the Watcher, and for an instant he   fancied that he saw what she had seen&#8212;something that was life   instead of death, a glow of understanding and of triumph in the   mighty face of stone above the lace mists of the clouds. For a  long  time they walked on, and deep in the heart of the woman a  voice cried  out again and again that the Watcher knew, and that it  was a living  joy she saw up there, for up to that unmoving and  voiceless god of the  mountains she had cried and laughed and sung  &#8212;and even prayed; and  with her Marette had also done these  things, until at last the pulse  and beat of women's souls had  given a spirit to a form of rock. 
  Back in the chateau which Malcolm McTrigger and his brother Donald   had built of logs, in a room whose windows faced the Watcher  himself,  Marette was unveiling the last of mystery for Jim Kent.  And this, too,  was her hour of triumph. Her lips were red and warm  with the flush  brought there by Kent's love. 
  Her face was like the wild roses he had crushed under his feet all   that day. For in this hour the world had come to her, and had   prostrated itself at her feet. The sacred contents of the pack  were  in her lap as she leaned back in the great blanketed and  pillowed  chair that had been her invalid's nest for many days. But  it was an  invalid's nest no longer. The floods of life were  pounding through her  body again, and in that hour when Malcolm  McTrigger and his wife were  gone, Kent looked upon the miracle of  its change. And now Marette gave  to him a little packet, and while  Kent opened it she raised both hands  to her head and unbound her  hair so that it fell about her in shining  and glorious confusion. 
  Kent, unwrapping a last bit of tissue-paper, found in his hands a   long tress of hair. 
  &quot;See, Jeems, it has grown fast since I cut it that night.&quot; 
  She leaned a little toward him, parting her hair with slim, white   fingers so that he saw again where the hair had been clipped the   night of Kedsty's death. 
  And then she said: &quot;You may keep it always if you want to, Jeems,   for I cut it from my head when I left you in the room below, and  when  you&#8212;almost&#8212;believed I had killed Kedsty. It was this&#8212;&quot; 
  She gave him another packet, and her lips tightened a little as   Kent unwrapped it, and another tress of hair shimmered in the lamp   glow. 
  &quot;That was father Donald's,&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;It&#8212;it was all he had left of Marie, his wife. And that night&#8212;   when Kedsty died&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I understand,&quot; cried Kent, stopping her. &quot;He choked Kedsty with   it until he was dead. And when I found it around Kedsty's neck&#8212;   you&#8212;you let me think it was yours&#8212;to save father Donald!&quot; 
  She nodded. &quot;Yes, Jeems. If the police had come, they would have   thought I was guilty. I planned to let them think so until father   Donald was safe. But all the time I had here in my breast this  other  tress, which would prove that I was innocent&#8212;when the time  came. And  now, Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  She smiled at him again and reached out her hands. &quot;Oh, I feel so   strong! And I want to take you out now&#8212;and show you my valley&#8212;   Jeems&#8212;our valley&#8212;yours and mine&#8212;in the starlight. Not tomorrow,   Jeems. But tonight. Now.&quot; 
  A little later the Watcher looked down on them, even as it had   looked down on another man and another woman who had preceded  them.  But the stars were bigger and brighter, and the white cap of  snow that  rested on the Watcher's head like a crown caught the  faint gleam of a  far-away light; and after that, slowly and  wonderfully, other  snow-crested mountain-tops caught that greeting  radiance of the moon.  But it was the Watcher who stood out like a  mighty god among them all,  and when they came to the elbow in the  plain, Marette drew Kent down  beside her on a great flat rock and  laughed softly as she held his  hand tightly in her lap. 
  &quot;Always, from a little child, I have sat and played on this rock,   with the Watcher looking, like that,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;I   have grown to love him, Jeems. And I have always believed that he  was  gazing off there, night and day, into the east, watching for  something  that was coming to me. Now I know. It was you, Jeems.  And, Jeems, when  I was away&#8212;down there in the big city&#8212;&quot; 
  Her fingers gripped his thumb in their old way, and Kent waited. 
  &quot;It was the Watcher that made me want to come home most of all,&quot;   she went on, a bit of tremble in her voice. &quot;Oh, I grew lonely for   him, and I could see him in my dreams at night, watching,  watching,  watching, and sometimes even calling me. Jeems, do you  see that hump  on his left shoulder, like a great epaulet?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I see,&quot; said Kent. 
  &quot;Beyond that, on a straight line from here&#8212;hundreds of miles   away&#8212;are Dawson City, the Yukon, the big gold country, men,  women,  civilization. Father Malcolm and father Donald have never  found but  one trail to this side of the mountains, and I have been  over it three  times&#8212;to Dawson. But the Watcher's back is on those  things. Sometimes  I imagine it was he who built those great  ramparts through which few  men come. He wants this valley alone.  And so do I. Alone&#8212;with you,  and with my people.&quot; 
  Kent drew her close in his arms. &quot;When you are stronger,&quot; he   whispered, &quot;we will go over that hidden trail together, past the   Watcher, toward Dawson. For it must be that over there&#8212;we will   find&#8212;a missioner&#8212;&quot; He paused. 
  &quot;Please go on, Jeems.&quot; 
  &quot;And you will be&#8212;my wife.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, yes, Jeems&#8212;forever and ever. But, Jeems&quot;&#8212;her arms crept up   about his neck&#8212;&quot;very soon it will be the first of August.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;And in that month there come through the mountains, each year, a   man and a woman to visit us&#8212;mother Anne's father and mother. And   mother Anne's father&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;Is a missioner, Jeems.&quot; 
  And Kent, looking up in this hour of his triumph and joy, believed   that in the Watcher's face he caught for an instant the passing   radiance of a smile. 
  THE END
