The wedding of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler was the most  notable private event of the Revolution. The immense social and  political consequence of the Schuylers, and the romantic fame of the  young aide, of whom the greatest things possible were expected, brought  the aristocracy of New York and the Jersies to Albany despite the  inclement winter weather. The large house of the Schuylers gave a  prolonged hospitality to the women, and the men lodged in the  patriarchal little town. But although Hamilton was glad to see the  Livingstons, Sterlings, and Boudinots again, the greater number of the  guests interested him far less than a small group of weather-beaten  soldiers, of which this occasion was the happy cause of reunion. Troup  was there, full of youth and honours. He had received the thanks of  Congress for his services at Saratoga, and been appointed secretary of  the Board of War. Recently he had resigned from the army, and was  completing his law studies. Nicolas Fish came with Lafayette, whose  light artillery he commanded. He was known as a brave and gallant  soldier, and so excellent a disciplinarian that he had won the approval  and confidence of Washington. He still parted his little fringe in the  middle, and his face was as chubby as ever, his eyes as solemn.  Lafayette, who had brought a box full of clothes that had dazzled Paris,  embraced Hamilton with tears, but they were soon deep in conjectures of  the next campaign. Laurens, looking like a king in exile, wrung many  hearts. Hamilton's brother aides, unfortunately, were the more closely  bound by his absence, but they had despatched him with their blessing  and much chaffing.    
The hall of the Schuyler mansion was about twenty feet square and  panelled in white. It was decorated with holly, and for three nights  before the wedding illuminated by hundreds of wax candles, while the  young people danced till three in the morning. The Schuyler house, long  accustomed to entertaining, had never been gayer, and no one was more  content than the chatelaine. Although she had been reasonably sure of  Elizabeth, there was no telling at what moment the maiden might yield to  the romantic mania of the time, and climb out of her window at night  while Hamilton stood shivering below. Now all danger was past, and Mrs.  Schuyler moved, large, placid, and still handsome, among her guests,  beaming so affectionately whenever she met Mrs. Carter's flashing eyes  that Peggy and Cornelia renewed their vows to elope when the hour and  the men arrived. General Schuyler, once more on the crest of public  approval, was always grave and stern, but he, too, breathed satisfaction  and relief. He was a tall man of military appearance, powerful,  muscular, slender; but as his nose was large and fleshy, and he wore a  ragged-looking wig with wings like Washington's, he could not be called  handsome. It was a noble countenance, however, and his black eyes  flashed and pierced.    
As for Hamilton and Miss Schuyler, who had a trunk full of charming new  gowns, they were as happy as two children, and danced the night through.  They were married on the 20th, in the drawing-room, in front of the  splendid mantel, which the housewives had spent much time in admiring.  The bride wore the white which became her best, made with a long pointed  bodice and paniers, and lace that had been worn by the wife of the first  patroon. She had risen to the dignity of a wig, and her mass of black  hair was twisted mercilessly tight under the spreading white monstrosity  to which her veil was attached. Hamilton wore a black velvet coat, as  befitting his impending state. Its lining and the short trousers were of  white satin. His shapely legs were in white silk, his feet in pumps with  diamond buckles, the present of Lafayette. He, too, wore a wig,--a close  one, with a queue,--but he got rid of it immediately after the ceremony,  for it heated his head.    
Hamilton had then reached his full height, about five feet six. His  bride was perhaps three inches shorter. The world vowed that never had  there been so pretty a couple, nor one so well matched in every way.  Both were the perfection of make, and the one as fair and fresh as a  Scot, the other a golden gipsy, the one all fire and energy, the other  docile and tender, but with sufficient spirit and intelligence. It is  seldom that the world so generously gives its blessing, but it might  have withheld it, for all that Hamilton and his bride would have cared.    
Hamilton's honeymoon was brief. There was a mass of correspondence  awaiting him, and no place for a bride in the humble Dutch house at New  Windsor where Washington had gone into winter quarters. But the distance  was not great, and he could hope for flying leaves of absence.  Washington was not unsympathetic to lovers; he had been known to unbend  and advise his aides when complications threatened or a siege seemed  hopeless; and he had given Hamilton the longest leave possible.  Nevertheless, the bridegroom set forth, one harsh January morning, on  his long journey, over roads a foot deep in snow, and through solitary  winter forests, with any thing but an impassioned desire to see General  Washington again. Had he been returning to the command of a corps, with  a prospect of stirring events as soon as the snow melted, he would have  spurred his horse with high satisfaction, even though he left a bride  behind him; but to return to a drudgery which he hated the more for  having escaped it for three enchanted weeks, made his spirit turn its  back to the horse's head. He resolved anew to resign if an opportunity  offered. Four years of that particular sort of devotion to the patriot  cause were enough. He wished to demonstrate his patriotism in other  ways. He had accomplished the primary object for which Washington had  pressed him into service, and he believed that the war was nearing its  finish; there was nothing he could now do at Headquarters which the  other aides could not do as well, and he wanted military excitement and  renown while their possibilities existed.
