Betty amused herself for the next day or two observing Jack Emory and  Sally Carter. They unquestionably enjoyed each other's society, and  Sally at times looked almost pretty again. But at the end of the  second day Miss Madison shook her head.    
"He is not in love," she thought. "It does not affect him in that  way." And she felt more satisfaction in her discovery than she would  have anticipated. A woman would have a man go through life with only a  skull cap where his surrendered scalp had been. To grow another is an  insult to her power and pains her vanity.    
It occurred to Betty that she was not the only observant person in the  house. She seemed always stumbling over Miss Trumbull, who did not  appear to listen at doors but was usually as closely within ear-shot  as she could get. It was idle to suppose that the woman had any  malignant motive in that well-conducted household, and she seemed to  be good-natured and even kindly. Interest in other people's affairs  was evidently, save vanity, her strongest passion. It was the natural  result of an empty life and a common mind. But simple or not, it was  objectionable.    
Her vanity, her mistress had cause to discover, was more so. On  Wednesday morning Betty returned home from a long tramp, earlier than  was her habit, and went to her room. Miss Trumbull was standing before  the mirror trying on one of her hats.    
"That's real becomin' to me," she drawled, as Miss Madison entered the  room. "I always could wear a hat turned up on one side, and most of  your colours would suit me."    
Betty controlled her temper, but the effort hurt her. She would have  liked to pour her scorn all over the creature.    
"You may have the hat," she said. "Only do me the favour not to enter  my room again unless I send for you. The maid is very neat, and it  needs no inspection."    
The woman's face turned a dark red. "I'm sorry you're mad," she said,  "but there's no harm, as I can see, in tryin' on a hat."    
"It is a matter of personal taste, not of right or wrong. I  particularly dislike having my things touched."    
"Oh, of course I won't, then; but I like nice things, and I haven't  seen too many of them."    
Again Betty relented. "I will leave you a good many at the end of the  summer," she said. And the woman thanked her very nicely and went  away.    
"I am glad I was not brutal to her," thought Betty. "Democracy is a  great institution in spite of its nuisances. Still, I admire Hamilton  more than Jefferson."    
When, that night, Mrs. Madison had a painful seizure, and Miss  Trumbull was sympathetic and efficient, sacrificing every hour of her  night's rest, Betty was doubly thankful that she had not been brutal.  In the morning she gave her a wrap that matched the hat. Miss Trumbull  tried it on at once, and revolved three times before the mirror, then  strutted off with such evident delight in her stylish appearance that  Betty's smile was almost sympathetic. But she dared not be more  gracious, and Miss Trumbull only approached her when it was necessary.    
On Thursday afternoon Betty and Sally were rowing on the lake when the  latter said abruptly,--    
"Have you noticed anything between Jack and Harriet?"    
Betty nearly dropped her oars. "What--Jack and Harriet?"    
Sally nodded. Her mouth was set. There was an angry sparkle in her  eyes. "Yes, yes. They pretend to avoid each other, but they are in  love or I never saw two people in love. I suspected it in Washington,  but I have become sure of it up here. What is the matter? I don't  think she is his equal, if she is our thirty-first cousin, for I would  bet my last dollar there was a misalliance somewhere--but you look  almost horror-struck."    
"I was, but I can't tell you why. I don't believe it's true, though.  She is not Jack's style. She hasn't a grain of humour in her."    
"When a man's imagination is captured by a beauty as perfect as that,  he doesn't discover that it is without humour till he has married it.  Besides, any man can fall in love with any woman; I'm convinced of  that. You might as well try to turn this lake upside down as to mate  types."    
"I don't think she would deceive me," exclaimed Betty, hopefully. "I  cannot tell you all, but I am nearly sure she would never do that."    
"Any woman who has a secret constantly on her mind is bound to become  secretive, not to say deceitful in other ways. What is her secret?"  she asked abruptly. "Has she negro blood in her veins?"    
"Oh, Sally!" This time Betty did drop the oars, and her face was  scarlet as she lunged after them. She was furious at having betrayed  Harriet's secret, but Sally Carter had a fashion of going straight for  the truth and getting it.    
"I thought so," said Miss Carter, dryly. "Don't take the trouble to  deny it. And don't think for a moment, Betty dear, that I am going to  embarrass you with further questions. I could never imagine you  actuated by any but the highest motives. I should consider the whole  thing none of my business if it were not for Jack. Faugh! how he would  hate her if he knew!"    
"I am afraid he would. I don't believe he is man enough to love her  better for her miserable inheritance."    
"He is a Southern gentleman; I should hope he would not. I am by no  means without sympathy for her. I pity her deeply, and have ever since  I discovered that she loved him. For he must be told."    
"Shall you tell him?"    
Sally did not answer for a moment, and her face flushed deeply. Then  she said unsteadily: "No; for I could not be sure of my motive. Here  is my secret. I have loved Jack Emory ever since I can remember. It is  impossible for me to assure myself that I would consider interference  in their affairs warrantable if I cared nothing for him. I cannot  afford to despise myself for tattling out of petty jealousy. But you  are responsible for her. You should tell him."    
"I will speak to her as soon as we go back. If it is true that they  are engaged, and if she refuses to tell him, I shall. But I'd almost  rather come out here and drown myself."    
"So should I."    
"You're a brick, Sally, and I wish to heaven you were going to marry  Jack to-morrow. That would be a really happy marriage."    
"So I have thought for years! When he got over his attack of you, I  began to hope, although I'd got wrinkles crying about him. I never  thought of any other woman in the case." She laughed, with a defiant  attempt to recover her old spirits. "And I cannot have the happiness  of seeing him one day in bronze, and feeling that he is all mine! For  he hasn't even that spark of luck which so often passes for  infinitesimal greatness, poor dear!"    
"How did you guess that she had the taint in her?" asked Betty, as  they were about to land. "She has not a suggestion of it in her face."    
"I <i>felt</i> it. So vaguely that I scarcely put it in words to myself  until lately. And I never saw such an amount of pink on finger-nails  in my life."
