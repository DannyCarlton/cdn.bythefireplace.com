When Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve left Spa, he left with a ruddy glow  of recovered health on his bronzed red cheek; for in spite of anxiety  and repentance and doubt, the man's iron frame would somehow still  assert itself. When he took his seat on the bench in court that  morning, he looked so haggard and ill with fatigue and remorse  that even Elma Clifford herself pitied him. A hushed whisper ran  round among the spectators below that the judge wasn't fit to try  the case before him. And indeed he wasn't. For it was his own trial,  not Guy Waring's, he was really presiding over.    
He sat down in his place, a ghastly picture of pallid despair. The  red colour had faded altogether from his wan, white cheeks. His eyes  were dreamy and bloodshot with long vigil. His big hands trembled  like a woman's as he opened his note-book. His mouth twitched  nervously. So utter a collapse, in such a man as he was, seemed  nothing short of pitiable to every spectator.    
Counsel for the Crown stared him steadily in the face. Counsel for  the Crown--Forbes-Ewing, Q.C.--was an old forensic enemy, who had  fought many a hard battle against Gildersleeve, with scant interchange  of courtesy, when both were members of the junior Bar together; but  now Sir Gilbert's look moved even <i>him</i> to pity. "I think, my lord,"  the Q.C. suggested with a sympathetic simper, "your lordship's too  ill to open the court to-day. Perhaps the proceedings had better  be adjourned for the present."    
"No, no," the judge answered, almost testily, shaking his sleeve  with impatience. "I'll have no putting off for trifles in the court  where I sit. There's a capital case to come on this morning. When  a man's neck's at stake--when a matter of life and death's at issue--I  don't like to keep any one longer in suspense than I absolutely  need. Delay would be cruel."    
As he spoke he lifted his eyes--and caught Elma Clifford's. The  judge let his own drop again in speechless agony. Elma's never  flinched. Neither gave a sign; but Elma knew, as, well as Sir  Gilbert knew himself, it was his own life and death the judge was  thinking of, and not Guy Waring's.    
"As you will, my lord," counsel for the Crown responded demurely.  "It was your lordship's convenience we all had at heart, rather  than the prisoner's."    
"Eh! What's that?" the judge said sharply, with a suspicious frown.  Then he recovered himself with a start. For a moment he had half  fancied that fellow, Forbes-Ewing, meant <i>something</i> by what he  said--meant to poke innuendoes at him. But, after all, it was a  mere polite form. How frightened we all are, to be sure, when we  know we're on our trial!    
The opening formalities were soon got over, and then, amid a  deep hush of breathless lips, Guy Waring, of Staple Inn, Holborn,  gentleman, was put upon his trial for the wilful murder of Montague  Nevitt, eighteen months before, at Mambury in Devon.    
Guy, standing in the dock, looked puzzled and distracted rather  than alarmed or terrified. His cheek was pale, to be sure, and his  eyes were weary; but as Elma glanced from him hastily to the judge  on the bench she had no hesitation in settling in her own mind  which of the two looked most at that moment like a detected murderer  before the faces of his accusers. Guy was calm and self-contained.  Sir Gilbert's mute agony was terrible to behold. Yet, strange to  say, no one else in court save Elma seemed to note it as she did.  People saw the judge was ill, but that was all. Perhaps his wig  and robes helped to hide the effect of conscious guilt--nobody  suspects a judge of murder; perhaps all eyes were more intent on  the prisoner.    
Be that as it might, counsel for the Crown opened with a statement  of what they meant to prove, set forth in the familiar forensic  fashion. They didn't pretend the evidence against the accused  was absolutely conclusive or overwhelming in character. It was  inferential only, but not circumstantial--inferential in such a  cumulative and convincing way as could leave no moral doubt on any  intelligent mind as to the guilt of the prisoner. They would show  that a clbse intimacy had long existed between the prisoner Waring  and the deceased gentleman, Mr. Montague Nevitt. Witnesses would  be called who would prove to the court that just before the murder  this intimacy, owing to circumstances which could not fully be  cleared up, had passed suddenly into intense enmity and open hatred.  The landlord of the inn at Mambury, and other persons to be called,  would speak to the fact that prisoner had followed his victim in hot  blood into Devonshire, and had tracked him to the retreat where he  was passing his holiday alone and incognito--had tracked him with  every expression of indignant anger, and had uttered plain threats  of personal violence towards him.    
Nor was that all. It would be shown that on the afternoon of  Waring's visit to Mambury, Mr. Nevitt, who possessed an intense  love of nature in her wildest and most romantic moods--it's always  counsel's cue, for the prosecution, to set the victim's character  in the most amiable light, and so win the sympathy of the jury  as against the accused--Mr. Nevitt, that close student of natural  beauty, had strolled by himself down a certain woodland path,  known as The Tangle, which led through the loneliest and leafiest  quarter of Mambury Chase, along the tumbling stream described as  the Mam-water. Ten minutes after he had passed the gate, a material  witness would show them, the prisoner Waring presented himself, and  pointedly asked whether his victim had already gone down the path  before him. He was told that that was so. Thereupon the prisoner  opened the gate, and followed excitedly. What happened next no  living eye but the prisoner's ever saw. Montague Nevitt was not  destined to issue from that wood alive. Two days later his breathless  body was found, all stiff and stark, hidden among the brown bracken  at the bottom of the dell, where the murderer no doubt had thrust it  away out of his sight on that fatal afternoon in fear and trembling.    
Half-way through the opening speech Sir Gilbert's heart beat fast  and hard. He had never heard Forbes-Ewing open a case so well.  The man would be hanged! He felt sure of it! He could see it! For  a while the judge almost gloated over that prospect of release.  What was Guy's life to him now, by the side of his wife's and  Gwendoline's happiness? But as counsel uttered the words, "What  happened next no living eye but the prisoner's ever saw," he looked  hard at Guy. Not a quiver of remorse or of guilty knowledge passed  over the young man's face. But Elma Clifford, for her part, looked  at the judge on the bench. Their eyes met once more. Again Sir  Gilbert's fell. Oh, heavens! how terrible! Even for Gwendoline's  sake he could never stand this appalling suspense. But perhaps after  all the prosecution might fail. There was still a chance left that  the jury might acquit him.    
So, torn by conflicting emotions, he sat there still, stiff and  motionless in his seat as an Egyptian statue.    
Then counsel went on to deal in greater detail with the question of  motive. There were two motives the prosecution proposed to allege:  first, the known enmity of recent date between the two parties, believed  to have reference to some business dispute; and, secondly--here  counsel dropped his voice to a very low key--he was sorry to suggest  it; but the evidence bore it out--mere vulgar love of gain--the  commonplace thirst after filthy lucre. They would bring witnesses  to show that when Mr. Montague Nevitt was last seen alive, he was  in possession of a pocket-book containing a very large large sum in  Bank of England notes of high value; from the moment of his death  that pocket-book had disappeared, and nobody knew what had since  become of it. It was not upon the body when the body was found. And  all their efforts to trace the missing notes, whose numbers were  not known, had been unhappily unsuccessful.    
Guy listened to all this impeachment in a dazed, dreamy way. He  hardly knew what it meant. It appalled and chilled him. The web of  circumstances was too thick for him to break. He couldn't understand  it himself. And what was far worse, he could give no active  assistance to his own lawyers on the question of the notes--which  might be very important evidence against him--without further  prejudicing his case by confessing the forgery. At all hazards, he  was determined to keep that quiet now. Cyril had never spoken to  a soul of that episode, and to speak of it, as things stood, would  have been certain death to him. I would be to supply the one missing  link of motive which the prosecution needed to complete their chain  of cumulative evidence.    
It was some comfort to him to think, however, that the secret was  safe in Cyril's keeping. Cyril had all the remaining notes, still  unchanged, in his possession; and the prosecution, knowing nothing  of the forgery, or its sequel, had no clue at all as to where they  came from.    
But as for Sir Gilbert, he listened still with ever-deepening  horror. His mind swayed to and fro between hope and remorse. They  were making the man guilty, and Gwendoline would be saved! They  were making the man guilty, and a gross wrong would be perpetrated!  Great drops of sweat stood colder than ever on his burning brow.  He couldn't have believed Forbes-Ewing could have done it so well.  He was weaving a close web round an innocent man with consummate  forensic skill and cunning.    
The case went on to its second stage. Witnesses were called, and Guy  listened to them dreamily. All of them bore out counsel's opening  statement. Every man in court felt the evidence was going very  hard against the prisoner. They'd caught the right man, that was  clear--so the spectators opined. They'd proved it to the hilt. This  fellow would swing for it.    
At last the landlord of the Talbot Arms at Mambury shuffled slowly  into the witness-box. He was a heavy, dull man, and he gave evidence  as to Nevitt's stay under an assumed name--which counsel explained  suggestively by the deceased gentleman's profound love of retirement  --and as to Guy's angry remarks and evident indignation. But the  most sensational part of all his evidence was that which related  to the pocket-book Montague Nevitt was carrying at the time of his  death, containing notes, he should say, for several hundred-pounds,  "or it murt be thousands--and yet, again, it mustn't," which had  totally disappeared since the day of the murder. Diligent search  had been made for the pocket-book everywhere by the landlord and  the police, but it had vanished into space, "leaving not a wrack  behind," as junior counsel for the prosecution poetically phrased  it.    
At the words Cyril mechanically dived his hand into his pocket, as  he had done a hundred times a day before, during these last eighteen  months, to assure himself that that most incriminating and unwelcome  object was still safely ensconced in its usual resting-place. Yes,  there it was sure enough, as snug as ever! He sighed, and pulled  his hand out again nervously, with a little jerk. Something came  with it, that fell on the floor with a jingle by his neighbour's  feet. Cyril turned crimson, then deadly pale. He snatched at the  object; but his neighbour picked it up and examined it cursorily.  Its flap had burst open with the force of the fall, and on the  inside the finder read with astonishment, in very plain letters,  the very name of the murdered man, "Montague Nevitt."    
Cyril held out his hand to recover it impatiently. But the finder  was too much taken back at his strange discovery to part with it  so readily. It was full of money-Bank of England notes; and through  the transparent paper of the outermost among them the finder could  dimly read the words, "One hundred."    
He rose in his place, and held the pocket-book aloft in his hand  with a triumphant gesture. Cyril tried in vain to clutch at it. The  witness turned round sharply, disturbed by this incident. "What's  that?" the judge exclaimed, puckering his brows in disapprobation,  and looking angrily towards the disturber.    
"If you please, my lord," the innkeeper answered, letting his jaw  drop slowly in almost speechless amazement, "that's the thing I  was a-talking of: that's Mr. Nevitt's pocket-book."    
"Hand it up," the judge said shortly, gazing hard with all his eyes  at the mute evidence so tendered.    
The finder handed it up without note or comment.    
Sir Gilbert turned the book over in blank surprise. He was dumfoundered  himself. For a minute or two he examined it carefully, inside and  out. Yes; there was no mistake. It was really what they called it.  "Montague Nevitt" was written in plain letters on the leather flap;  within lay half-a-dozen engraved visiting-cards, a Foreign Office  passport in Nevitt's name, and thirty Bank of England notes for  one hundred pounds apiece. This was, indeed, a mystery!    
"Where did it come from?" the judge asked, drawing a painfully  deep breath, and handing it across to the jury.    
And the finder answered, "If you please, my lord, the gentleman  next to me pulled it out of his pocket."    
"Who is he?" the judge inquired, with a sinking heart, for he  himself knew perfectly well who was the unhappy possessor.    
And a thrill of horror ran round the crowded court as Forbes-Ewing  answered, in a very distinct voice, "Mr. Cyril Waring, my lord,  the brother of the prisoner."
