Elma hurried home full of intense misgivings. She dreaded having  to meet her mother's eye. How on earth could she hide from that  searching glance the whole truth as to what had happened in the  wood that morning? When she reached home, however, she learned to  her relief, from the maid who opened the door to her, that their  neighbour, Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve, the distinguished Q.C., had  dropped in for lunch, and this chance diversion supplied Elma with  a little fresh courage to face the inevitable. She went straight  up to her own room the moment she entered the house, without seeing  her mother, and there she waited, bathing her face copiously till  some minutes after the lunch bell had rung. For she felt sure she  would blush crimson when she met her mother; but as she blushed  habitually when strangers came in, the cause of it might thus,  perhaps, she vainly flattered herself, escape even those lynx-like  eyes of Mrs. Clifford's.    
The great Q.C., a big, overbearing man, with a pair of huge burly  hands that somehow seemed to form his chief feature, was a little  bit blustering in his talk, as usual; the more so because he had  just learned incidentally that something had gone wrong between  his daughter Gwendoline and Granville Kelmscott. For though that  little episode of private wooing had run its course nominally  without the knowledge or consent of either family, Mr. Gilbert  Gildersleeve, at least, had none the less been aware for many weeks  past of the frequent meetings between Gwendoline and Granville  in the dell just beyond the disputed boundary line. And as Mr.  Gildersleeve disliked Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate Park, for a  pig-headed esquire, almost as cordially as Colonel Kelmscott disliked  Mr. Gildersleeve in return for a rascally lawyer, it had given the  great Q.C. no little secret satisfaction in his own soul to learn  that his daughter Gwendoline was likely to marry the Colonel's son  and heir, directly against the wishes and consent of his father.    
Only that very morning, however, poor Mrs. Gildersleeve, that  tired, crushed wife, had imparted to her lord and master, in fear  and trembling, the unpleasant intelligence that, so far as she  could make out, there was something wrong between Granville and  Gwendoline. And this something wrong she ventured to suggest was  no mere lover's tiff of the ordinary kiss-and-make-it-up description,  but a really serious difficulty in the way of their marriage. So  Mr. Gildersleeve, thus suddenly deprived of his expected triumph,  took it out another way by more than even his wonted boisterousness  of manner in talking about the fortunes of the Kelmscott family.    
"I fancy, myself, you know, Mrs. Clifford," he was saying, very loud,  as Elma entered, "there's a screw loose just now in the Kelmscott  affairs--something rotten somewhere in the state of Denmark. That  young fellow, Granville, who's by no means such a bad lot as his  father all round--too good for the family, in fact; too good for  the family--Granville's been accustomed of late to come over into  my grounds, beyond the boundary wall, and being anxious above all  things to cultivate friendly relations with all my neighbours in  the county, I've allowed him to come--I've allowed him, and I may  even say to a certain extent I've encouraged him. There at times  he's met by accident my daughter Gwendoline. Oh, dear no"--with  uplifted hand, and deprecating lips--"I assure you, nothing of  <i>that</i> sort, my dear Mrs. Clifford. Gwendoline's far too young, and  I couldn't dream of allowing her to marry into Colonel Kelmscott's  family. But, however, be that as it may, he's been in the habit  of coming there, till very recently, when all of a sudden, only a  week or ten days back, to my immense surprise he ceased at once,  and ever since has dropped into the defensive, exactly as he used  to do. And I interpret it to mean--"    
Elma heard no more of that pompous speech. Her knees shook under  her. For she was aware only of Mrs. Clifford's eyes, fixed mildly  and calmly upon her face, not in anger, as she feared, or reproach,  but rather in infinite pity. For a second their glances met in mute  intercourse of soul, then each dropped their eyelashes as suddenly  as before. Through the rest of that lunch Elma sat as in a maze,  hearing and seeing nothing. What she ate, or drank, or talked  about, she knew not. Mr. Gildersleeve's pungent and embellished  anecdotes of the Kelmscott family and their unneighbourly pride  went in at one ear and out at the other. All she was conscious of  was her mother's sympathetic yet unerring eye; she felt sure that  at one glance that wonderful thought-reader had divined everything,  and seen through and through their interview that morning.    
After lunch, the two men strolled upon the lawn to enjoy their  cigars, and Elma and her mother were left alone in the drawing-room.    
For some minutes neither could make up her mind to break the ice  and speak. They sat shame-faced beside one another on the sofa,  like a pair of shy and frightened maidens. At last Mrs. Clifford  braced herself up to interrupt the awkward silence. "You've been  in Chetwood Forest, Elma," she murmured low, looking down and  averting her eyes carefully from her trembling daughter.    
"Yes, mother," Elma answered, all aglow with conscious blushes.  "In Chetwood Forest."    
"And you met him, dear?" The mother spoke tenderly and sympathetically.    
Elma's heart stood still. "Yes, mother, I met him."    
"And he had the snake there?"    
Elma started in surprise. Why dwell upon that seemingly unimportant  detail? "Oh yes," she answered, still redder and hotter than ever.  "He had it there. He was painting it."    
Mrs. Clifford paused a minute. Then she went on, with pain. "And  he asked you, Elma?"    
Elma bowed her head. "Yes, he asked me--and I refused him," she  answered, with a terrible wrench.    
"Oh, darling; I know it," Mrs. Clifford cried, seizing both cold  hands in hers. "And I know why, too. But, Elma, believe me, you  needn't have done it. My daughter, my daughter, you might just as  well have taken him."    
"No, never," Elma cried, rising from her seat and moving towards  the door in an agony of shame. "I couldn't. I daren't. It would  be wrong. It would be cruel. But, mother, don't speak to me of it.  Don't mention it again. Even before you it makes me more wretched  and ashamed than I can say to allude to it."    
She rushed from the room, with cheeks burning like fire. Come what  might, she never could talk to any living soul again about that  awful episode.    
But Mrs. Clifford sat on, on the sofa where Elma left her, and cried  to herself silently, silently, silently. What a mother should do  in these hateful circumstances she could hardly even guess. She  only knew she could never speak it out, and even if she did, Elma  would never have the courage or the heart to listen to her.    
That same evening, when Elma went up to bed, a strange longing  came across her to sit up late, and think over to herself again all  the painful details of the morning's interview. She seated herself  by her bedside in her evening dress, and began to think it all  out again, exactly as it happened. As she did so, the picture of  Sardanapalus, on his bed of fern, came up clear in her mind, just  as he lay coiled round in Cyril Waring's landscape. Beautiful  Sardanapalus, so sleek and smooth and glossy, if only she had him  here now--she paused and hesitated. In a moment, the wild impulse  rushed upon her once more. It clutched her by the throat; it held  her fast as in a vice. She must get up and dance; she must obey  the mandate; she must whirl till she fell in that mystical ecstasy.    
She rose, and seemed for a moment as though she must yield to the  temptation. The boa--the boa was in the lower drawer. Reluctantly,  remorsefully, she opened the drawer and took it out in her hands.  Fluff and feathers, fluff and feathers--nothing more than that!  But oh, how soft, how smooth, how yielding, how serpentine! With  a violent effort she steadied herself, and looked round for her  scissors. They lay on the dressing-table. She took them up with a  fixed and determined air. "If thy right hand offend thee, cut it  off," she thought to herself. Then she began ruthlessly hacking  the boa into short little lengths of a few inches each, which she  gathered up in her hands as soon as she had finished, and replaced  with care in the drawer where she had originally found them.    
After that her mind felt somewhat more at ease and a trifle less  turbulent. She loved Cyril Waring--oh yes, she loved him with all  her heart; it was hard to give him up; hard not to yield to that  pressing impulse in such a moment of doubt and despondency. The  boa had said to her, as it were, "Come, dance, go mad, and forget  your trouble!" But she had resisted the temptation. And now--    
Why, now, she would undress, and creep into bed, like any other good  English girl under similar circumstances, and cry herself asleep  with thoughts of Cyril.    
And so she did in truth. She let her emotion take its natural outlet.  She lay awake for an hour or two, till her eyes were red and sore  and swollen. Then at last she dropped off, for very weariness, and  slept soundly an unbroken sleep till morning.    
At eight o'clock, Mrs. Clifford knocked her tentative little knock  at the door. "Come in, mother," Elma cried, starting up in her  surprise; and her mother, much wondering, turned the handle and  entered.    
When she reached the bed, she gave a little cry of amazement. "Why,  Elma," she exclaimed, staring her hard and long in the face; "my  darling, what's this? Your eyes are red! How strange! You've been  crying!"    
"Yes, mother," Elma answered, turning her face to the wall, but a  thousand times less ashamed than she had been the day before when  her mother spoke to her. "I couldn't help it, dearest." She took  that soft white hand in hers and pressed it hard in silence. "It's  no wonder, you know," she said at last, after a long deep pause.  "He's going away from Chetwood to-day--and it was so very, very  hard to say good-bye to him for ever."    
"Oh yes, I know, darling," Mrs. Clifford answered, eyeing her  harder than ever now with a half-incredulous look. "I know all  that. But--you've had a good night in spite of everything, Elma."    
Elma guessed what she meant. They two could converse together quite  plainly without words. "Well, yes, a better night," she answered,  hesitating, and shutting her eyes under the bed-clothes for very  shame. "A little disturbed--don't you know--just at first; but I  had a good cry very soon, and then that mended everything."    
Her mother still looked at her, half doubting and half delighted.  "A good cry's the right thing," she said slowly, in a very low  voice. "The exact right thing, perfectly proper and normal. A good  cry never did any girl on this earth one atom of harm. It's the  best safety-valve. You're lucky, Elma, my child, in being able to  get one."    
"Yes, dear," Elma answered, with her head still buried. "Very lucky  indeed. So I think, too, mother."    
Mrs. Clifford's eye fell aimlessly upon certain tiny bits of  feathery fluff that flecked the floor here and there like floating  fragments of thistledown. In a second, her keen instinct divined  what they meant. Without one word she rose silently and noiselessly,  and opened the lower drawer, where the boa usually reposed among  the furs and feathers. One glimpse of those mangled morsels showed  her the truth at a glance. She shut the drawer again noiselessly  and silently as she had opened it. But Elma, lying still with her  eyes closed tight, yet knew perfectly well how her mother had been  occupied.    
Mrs. Clifford came back, and, stooping over her daughter's bed,  kissed her forehead tenderly. "Elma, darling," she said, while a hot  tear or two fell silently upon the girl's burning cheek, "you're  very, very brave. I'm so pleased with you, so proud of you! I  couldn't have done it myself. You're stronger-minded than I am. My  child, he kissed you for good-bye yesterday. You needn't say yes,  you needn't say no. I read it in your face. No need for you to  tell me of it. Well, darling, it wasn't good-bye after all, I'm  certain of that. Believe me, my child, he'll come back some day,  and you'll know you can marry him."    
"Never!" Elma cried, hiding her face still more passionately and  wildly than before beneath great folds of the bed-clothes. "Don't  speak to me of him any more, mother! Never! Never! Never!"
