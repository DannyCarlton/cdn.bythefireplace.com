  The next three months passed very unsatisfactorily for Andy. In a  small country town like that in which he lived there was little  opportunity for a boy, however industrious, to earn money. The farmers  generally had sons of their own, or were already provided with  assistants, and there was no manufacturing establishment in the village  to furnish employment to those who didn't like agriculture. Andy had  some idea of learning the carpenter trade, there being a carpenter who  was willing to take an apprentice, but, unfortunately, he was unwilling  to pay any wages for the first year&#8212;only boarding the apprentice&#8212;and  our hero felt, for his mother's sake, that it would not do to make such  an engagement.
  When the three months were over, the stock of money which Andy and  his mother had saved up was almost gone. In fact, he had not enough  left to pay the next quarter's rent to Dr. Townley.
  Things were in this unsatisfactory state, when something happened  that had a material effect upon Andy's fortunes, and, as my readers  will be glad to know, for their improvement.
  To explain what it was, I must go back to a period shortly before  Colonel's Preston's death. One day he met the doctor in the street, and  stopped to speak to him.
  &#8220;Dr. Townley,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have a favor to ask of you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be very glad to serve you, Colonel Preston,&#8221; said the  doctor.
  Thereupon Colonel Preston drew from his inside pocket a sealed  envelope of large size.
  &#8220;I want you to take charge of this for me,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the doctor, in some surprise.
  &#8220;Please read what I have written upon the envelope.&#8221;
  The doctor, his attention called to the envelope, read, inscribed in  large, distinct characters:
  &#8220;Not to be opened till six months after my death.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see you want an explanation,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;Here it is&#8212;the  paper contained in this envelope is an important one. I won't tell you  what it is. When you come to open it, it will explain itself.&#8221;
  &#8220;But, colonel, you are likely to live as long as I. In that case, I  can't follow your directions.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course, we can't tell the duration of our lives. Still, I think  you will outlive me. If not, I shall reclaim the paper. Meanwhile, I  shall be glad to have you take charge of it for me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course I will. It is a slight favor to ask.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may prove important. By the way, there is no need of telling  anyone, unless, perchance, your wife. I don't want to force you to keep  anything secret from her. Mrs. Townley, I know, may be depended upon.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think she may. Well, Colonel Preston, set your mind at rest. I  will take care of the paper.&#8221;
  When Colonel Preston died, not long afterward, the doctor naturally  thought of the paper, and, as no will was left, it occurred to him that  this might be a will; but, in that case, he couldn't understand why he  should have been enjoined to keep it six months before opening it. On  the whole, he concluded that it was not a will.
  Seated at the supper table, about this time, Mrs. Townley said,  suddenly:
  &#8220;Henry, how long is it since Colonel Preston died?&#8221;
  &#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said the doctor, thoughtfully. &#8220;It is&#8212;yes, it is six  months to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then it is time for you to open that envelope he gave into your  charge.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it is. My dear, your feminine curiosity inspired that thought,&#8221;  said the doctor, smiling.
  &#8220;Perhaps you are right. I own I am a little inquisitive in the  matter.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad you mentioned it. I have so much on my mind that I should  have let the day pass, and I should be sorry not to fulfill to the  letter the promise I made to my friend.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you any suspicion as to the nature of the document?&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought it might be a will; but, if so, I can't understand why a  delay of six months should have been interposed.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston may have had his reasons. Possibly he did not fully  trust his wife's attention to his requests.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may be so. I am afraid his married life was not altogether  harmonious. Mrs. Preston always struck me as a very selfish woman.&#8221;
  &#8220;No doubt of that.&#8221;
  &#8220;She evidently regarded herself as superior to the rest of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;In that respect Godfrey is like her. He is a self-conceited,  disagreeable young jackanapes. I wouldn't give much for his chances of  honorable distinction in life. I'll tell you of a boy who will, in my  opinion, beat him in the race of life.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Andy Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Andy is a good boy, but I am afraid the family is doing poorly  now.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I fear. The, fact is, there doesn't appear to be much opening  for a lad like Andy in this village.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hear that Mr. Graves, the storekeeper, who is getting old, wants  to get a boy, or young man, with a small capital to take an interest in  his business, and, eventually, succeed him.&#8221;
  &#8220;That would be a good chance for Andy, if he had the small capital;  but he probably hasn't ten dollars in the world.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a pity.&#8221;
  &#8220;If I were a capitalist, I wouldn't mind starting him myself; but as  you, my dear, are my most precious property, and are not readily  convertible into cash, I don't quite see my way to do anything to  assist him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't think of you, Henry. Country doctors are not likely to get  rich. But I thought Colonel Preston, who seemed to take an interest in  the boy, might do something for him.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he had lived, he might have done so&#8212;probably he would. But Mrs.  Preston and Godfrey hate the Burkes like poison, for no good reason  that I know of, and there is no chance of help from that quarter.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should think not.&#8221;
  The next day, Dr. Townley, immediately after breakfast, drew the  envelope already referred to from among his private papers, and,  breaking the seal, opened it.
  To his surprise and excitement, he discovered that the inclosure was  the last will and testament of his deceased friend. Accompanying it was  the following note:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;MY DEAR FRIEND, DR. TOWNLEY: This is the duplicate of a will <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executed recently, and expresses my well-considered wishes as <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the disposition of my property. The original will may have <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been found and executed before you open this envelope. In <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that case, of course, this will be of no value, and you can <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy it. But I am aware that valuable papers are liable to <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loss or injury, and, therefore, I deem it prudent to place <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this duplicate in your possession, that, if the other be <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost, you may see it carried into execution. I have named you <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my executor, and am sure, out of regard to me, you will <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accept the trust, and fulfill it to the best of your ability. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always felt the utmost confidence in your friendship, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this will account for my troubling you on the present <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occasion. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Your friend, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Anthony Preston.&#8221;
  From this letter Dr. Townley turned to the perusal of the will. The  contents filled him with equal surprise and pleasure.
  &#8220;Five thousand dollars to Andy Burke!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;That is  capital! It will start the boy in life, and with his good habits it  will make him sure of a competence by and by. With half of it he can  buy an interest in Graves' store, and the balance will, if well  invested, give him a handsome addition to his income. Then there's the  bequest for the town library&#8212;a capital idea, that! It will do a great  deal to make the town attractive, and be a powerful agency for refining  and educating the people.&#8221;
  Just then Mrs. Townley, who knew what her husband was about, came  into the room.
  &#8220;Well, Henry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is the paper important?&#8221;
  &#8220;I should say it was. It is Colonel Preston's last will and  testatment.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is it possible? How does he leave his property?&#8221;
  &#8220;He leaves five thousand dollars for a town library.&#8221;
  &#8220;Does he remember Andy Burke?&#8221;
  &#8220;He leaves him five thousand dollars, and gives his mother the house  they used to live in.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's splendid! But what will Mrs. Preston say?&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, that remains to be seen,&#8221; said the doctor, laughing.
