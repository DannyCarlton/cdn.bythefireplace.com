He came over to dinner that night, and Betty, who had walked about in  a vague dreamy state all day, dressed herself again in white. She woke  up suddenly as she came into his presence, and was the life of the  dinner. Harriet seemed absent of mind and nervous, but Emory's spirits  were normal, and he was more attentive to Sally Carter than she to  him. But Betty's interest in her friends' affairs had dropped to a  very low ebb. She was in a new mental world, stranger than that  entered by most women, for her hands were empty, but she was happy.  She had reflected again--in so far as she had been capable of  reflection--that most marriages were prosaic, and that her own high  romance, her inestimable happiness in loving and being loved by a man  in whom her pride was so great, was a lot to be envied of all women.  It was not all the destiny she herself would have chosen, but it  compassed a great deal. She would have made him wholly happy, been his  whole happiness; marriage between them never would have been prosaic,  and she would not have cared if it were; she would have made him  forget the deep trials and sorrows of his past and the worries and  annoyances of the present. But this was not to be, and there was much  she could do for him and would.    
They talked politics through dinner, and Mrs. Madison noted with a  sigh that Betty's interest in the undesirable institution was  unabated. She admired Senator North, however, and felt pride in his  appreciation of her brilliant daughter. She expressed her regret  amiably at not being able to meet again Mrs. North, who would see none  but old friends in these days, and Senator North assured her of his  wife's agreeable remembrance of her brief acquaintance with Mrs.  Madison.    
"How wonderfully well people behave whose common secret would set  their world by the ears," thought Betty. "Our worst enemies could  detect nothing; and on what there is heaven knows a huge scandal could  be built."    
After dinner she played to him for an hour, while the others, with the  exception of Mrs. Madison, who went to sleep, became absorbed in  whist. But she did not see him for a moment alone, and Jack rowed him  across the lake.    
She went to her bed, but not to sleep. She hardly cared if she never  slept again. Night in a measure gave him to her, and to sleep was to  forget the wonder that he loved her.    
It was shortly after midnight that she heard a faint but unmistakable  creaking on the tin roof of the veranda. She sat up. Some one was  about to pass her window. She sprang out of bed, crossed the room  softly, and lifted the edge of the curtain. A figure was almost  crawling past. It was a woman's figure; the stars gave enough light to  define its outlines at close range. She had a shawl over her head, but  her angular body was unmistakable. She was Miss Trumbull.    
Betty dropped the curtain and stared into the darkness. "Whom is she  watching?" she thought. "Whom is she watching?"    
She went back to bed and listened intently. In half an hour she heard  the same sound again.    
"She is going back to her room," thought Betty. "What has she seen?"    
The next morning she sent for Miss Trumbull to come to her room. She  had no intention of asking her to sit down, but the woman did not wait  to be invited. She took a chair and fanned herself with a palm leaf  that she picked from the table.    
"Lawsy, but it's hot," she said. "I had a long argument with Miss  Walker yesterday about New York State bein' hotter 'n down South, and  she wouldn't believe it. But I usually know what I'm talkin' about,  and hotter it is. I near lost my temper, for I guess I know when it's  hot--"    
"What were you doing on the roof of the veranda last night?" asked  Betty, abruptly.    
Miss Trumbull turned the dark ugly red of her embarrassed condition.    
"I--" she stammered.    
"I saw you. Whom were you watching?"    
"I warn't watchin' anybody. I was takin' a walk. I couldn't sleep."    
"You know perfectly well that the roof of a veranda is not intended to  be walked on. Your curiosity is insufferable. I suppose it has become  professional. Or are you hoping for blackmail? If so, the hotel is the  place for you."    
This time Miss Trumbull turned purple.    
"I like money as well as anybody, I guess," she stuttered; 'but I'd  never sell a secret to get it. I ain't low down and despicable if I am  poor." "Then you admit it is mere curiosity? I would rather you  stole."    
"Well, I don't steal, thank heaven. And I don't see any harm in tryin'  to know what's goin' on in the world."    
"Read the newspapers and let your neighbours alone, at all events the  people in this house. I have twice seen you reading over the addresses  of the letters of the outgoing mail. Don't you ever do it again. You  are a good housekeeper, but if I find you attending to anything but  your own business, once more, you go on the moment. That is all I have  to say."    
The woman left the room hurriedly. An hour or two later Betty met  Harriet on the terrace.    
"I am sorry to appear to be always admonishing you," she said, "but I  must ask you to have nothing more to do with Miss Trumbull."    
"I don't want to have anything more to do with her, honey. She has  taken to arguing with me in that long self-satisfied drawl, and I have  'most got to hate her. I wouldn't mind so much if she was ever right,  but she is a downright fool, and I reckon all fools are pretty much  alike. And I have a horrible idea that she suspects something. I have  seen her staring at my finger-nails two or three times. And I am 'most  sure some one has gone through the little trunk I keep my letters in.  Of course the key is always in my purse, but she may have had one that  fits, and the things are not like I left them, I am 'most sure."    
"She probably envies your finger-nails, and the trunk, doubtless, was  upset in travelling. Besides, I don't think she's malignant. Like most  underbred persons, she is curious, and she has cultivated the trait  until it has become a disease."    
"But there's no knowing what she might do if she took a dislike to me.  She's not bad-hearted at all, but she could be spiteful, and I can't  and won't stand her any longer. I reckon I'd like to go to Europe,  anyhow. I feel as if every one was guessing my secret. Over there you  say they don't mind those things, and I'd enjoy being in that kind of  a place."    
"Go, by all means. I'll write at once and inquire about a chaperon--"    
"Oh, I don't want to go just yet. September will do. I reckon these  mountains are about as cool at this time of the year as anywhere, and  they make me feel strong." She added abruptly: "Does Sally suspect?"    
Betty nodded. "Yes, she surprised the truth out of me. I am more  sorry--"    
Harriet had gripped her arm with both hands. Her face was ghastly.  "She knows? She knows?" she gasped. "Then she will tell him. Oh! Why  was I ever born?"    
Betty made her sit down and took her head in her arms. Harriet was  weeping with more passion than she ever had seen her display.    
"You believe me always, don't you?" she said. "For Miss Trumbull I  cannot answer, but for Sally I can--positively. She never would do a  mean and ignoble thing."    
"She loves him!"    
That is the more reason for not telling him. Cannot you understand  high-mindedness?"    
"Oh, yes. You are high-minded, and <i>he</i>--that is the reason I should  die if he found out; for he hates, he loathes deceit. Oh, I've grown  to hate this country. I love you, but I'd like to forget that it was  ever on the map. I wish I was coal black and had been born in Africa."    
"Why don't you go there and live, set up a sort of court?" asked  Betty, seized with an inspiration.    
"And live among niggers? I despise and abhor niggers! If one put his  dirty black paw on me, I'd 'most kill him!"    
Betty turned away her head to conceal a smile; but Harriet, who was  wholly without humour, continued:    
"Betty, honey, I want you to promise me that if I ever do anything to  disappoint you, you'll forgive me. I love you so I couldn't bear to  have you despise me."    
"What have you been doing?" asked Betty, anxiously.    
"Nothing, honey," replied Harriet, promptly. "I mean if I did."    
"Don't do anything that requires forgiveness. It makes life so much  simpler not to. And remember the promise you made me."    
"Oh, I don't reckon I'll ever forget that."
