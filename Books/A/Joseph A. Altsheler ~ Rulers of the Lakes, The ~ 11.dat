Robert settled the inert form of the Onondaga against his left shoulder,  and, being naturally very strong, with a strength greatly increased by a  long life in the woods, he was able to carry the weight easily. He had  no plan yet in his mind, merely a vague resolve to carry Tayoga outside  the fighting zone and then do what he could to resuscitate him. It was  an unfortunate chance that the hostile flankers had cut in between him  and the main force of Rogers, but it could not be helped, and the  farther he was from his own people the safer would he and Tayoga be.    
Two hundred yards more and putting his comrade on the ground he cut away  the deerskin, disclosing the wound. The bullet had gone almost through  the shoulder, and as he felt of its path he knew with joy that it had  touched no bone. Then, unless the loss of blood became great, it could  not prove mortal. But the bullet was of heavy type, fired from the old  smoothbore musket and the shock had been severe. Although it had not  gone quite through the shoulder he could feel it near the surface, and  he decided at once upon rude but effective surgery.    
Laying Tayoga upon his face, he drew his keen hunting knife and cut  boldly into the flesh of the shoulder until he reached the bullet. Then  he pried it out with the point of the knife, and threw it away in the  bushes. A rush of blood followed and Tayoga groaned, but Robert, rapidly  cutting the Onondaga's deerskin tunic into suitable strips, bound  tightly and with skill both the entrance and the exit of the wound. The  flow of blood was stopped, and he breathed a fervent prayer of  thankfulness to the white man's God and the red man's Manitou. Tayoga  would live, and he knew that he had saved the life of his comrade, as  that comrade had more than once saved his.    
Yet both were still surrounded by appalling dangers. At any moment St.  Luc's savages might burst through the woods and be upon them. As he  finished tying the bandage and stood erect the flare of the fighting  came from a point much nearer, though between them and the ranger band,  forbidding any possible attempt to rejoin Rogers and Willet. Tayoga  opened his eyes, though he saw darkly, through a veil, and said in  feeble tones:    
"They have closed again with the forces of St. Luc. You would be there,  Dagaeoga, to help in the fighting. Go, I am useless. It is not a time to  cumber yourself with me."    
"If I lay there as you are, and you stood here as I am would you leave  me?" asked Robert.    
The Onondaga was silent.    
"You know you wouldn't," continued Robert, "and you know I won't.  Listen, the battle comes nearer. St. Luc must have received a  reenforcement."    
He leaned forward a little, cupping his ear with his right hand, and he  heard distinctly all the sounds of a fierce and terrible conflict, rifle  shots, yells of the savages, shouts of the rangers, and once or twice he  thought he saw faintly the flashes of rifles as they were fired in the  thickets.    
"Go," said Tayoga again. "I can see that your spirit turns to the  battle. They may not find me, and, perhaps in a day, I shall be able to  walk and take care of myself."    
Robert made no reply in words, but once more he lifted the Onondaga in  his sinewy arms, settled his weight against his left shoulder and  resumed his walk away from the battle. Tayoga did not speak, and Robert  soon saw that he had relapsed again into unconsciousness. He went at  least three hundred yards before resting, and all the while the battle  called to him, the shots, the yells and the shouts still coming clearly  through the thin mountain air.    
He rested perhaps fifteen minutes, and he saw that, while Tayoga was  unconscious, the flow of blood was still held in check by the bandages.  Resuming his burden, he went on through the forest, a full quarter of a  mile now, and the last sound of the battle sank into nothingness behind  him. He was consumed with anxiety to know who had won, but there was not  a sign to tell.    
He came to a brook, and putting Tayoga down once more, he bathed his  face freely, until the Onondaga opened his eyes and looked about, not  with a veil before his eyes now, but clearly.    
"Where are we, Dagaeoga?" he asked.    
"I'd tell you if I could, but I can't," replied Robert, cheerfully,  rejoiced at the sight of his comrade's returning strength.    
"You have left the battle behind you?"    
"Yes. I can state in general terms that we're somewhere between  Andiatarocte and Oneadatote, which is quite enough for you to know at  the present time. I'm the forest doctor, and as this is the first chance  I've ever had to exert authority over you, I mean to make the most of  it."    
Tayoga smiled wanly.    
"I see that you have bound up my wound," he said. "That was well. But  since I cannot see the wound itself I do not know what kind of a bullet  made it."    
"It wasn't a bullet at all, Tayoga. It was a cannon ball, though it came  out of a wide-mouthed musket, and I'm happy to tell you that it somehow  got through your shoulder without touching bone."    
"The bullet is out?"    
"Yes, I cut it out with this good old hunting knife of mine."    
Again Tayoga smiled wanly.    
"You have done well, Dagaeoga," he said. "Did I not say to others in  your defense that you had intelligence and, in time, might learn? You  have saved my life, a poor thing perhaps, but the only life I have, and  I thank you."    
Robert laughed, and his laugh was full of heartiness. He saw the old  Tayoga coming back.    
"You'll be a new man tomorrow," he said. "With flesh and blood as  healthy as yours a hole through your shoulder that I could put my fist  in would soon heal."    
"What does Dagaeoga purpose to do next?"    
"You'll find out in good time. I'm master now, and I don't intend to  tell my plans. If I did you'd be trying to change 'em. While I'm ruler I  mean to be ruler."    
"It is a haughty spirit you show. You take advantage of my being  wounded."    
"Of course I do. As I said, it's the only chance I've had. Stop that!  Don't try to sit up! You're not strong enough yet. I'll carry you  awhile."    
Tayoga sank back, and, in a few more minutes, Robert picked him up and  went on once more. But he noticed that the Onondaga did not now lie a  dead weight upon his shoulder. Instead, there was in him again the vital  quality that made him lighter and easier to carry. He knew that Tayoga  would revive rapidly, but it would be days before he was fit to take  care of himself. He must find not only a place of security, but one of  shelter from the fierce midsummer storms that sometimes broke over those  mountain slopes. Among the rocks and ravines and dense woods he might  discover some such covert. Food was contained in his knapsack and the  one still fastened to the back of Tayoga, food enough to last several  days, and if the time should be longer his rifle must find more.    
The way became rougher, the rocks growing more numerous, the slopes  increasing in steepness, and the thickets becoming almost impenetrable.    
"Put me down," said Tayoga. "We are safe from the enemy, for a while at  least. All the warriors have been drawn by the battle, and, whether it  goes on now or not, they have not yet had time to scatter and seek  through the wilderness."    
"I said I was going to be absolute master, but it looks, Tayoga, as if  you meant to give advice anyhow. And as your advice seems good, and I  confess I'm a trifle weary, I'll let you see if you can sit up a little  on this heap of dead leaves, with your back against this old fallen  trunk. Here we go! Gently now! Oh, you'll soon be a warrior again, if  you follow my instructions!"    
Tayoga heaved a little sigh of relief as he leaned back against the  trunk. His eyes were growing clearer and Robert knew that the beat of  his pulse was fuller. All the amazing vitality that came from a powerful  constitution, hard training and clean living was showing itself.  Already, and his wound scarcely two hours old, his strength was coming  back.    
"You look for a wigwam, Dagaeoga?" he said.    
"Well, scarcely that," replied Robert. "I'm not expecting an inn in this  wilderness, but I'm seeking some sort of shelter, preferably high up  among the rocks, where we might find protection from storms."    
"Two or three hundred yards farther on and we'll find it."    
"Come, Tayoga, you're just guessing. You can't know such a thing."    
"I am not guessing at all, Dagaeoga, and I do know. Your position as  absolute ruler was brief. It expired between the first and second hour,  and now you have an adviser who may become a director."    
"Then proceed with your advice and direction. How do you know there is  shelter only two or three hundred yards farther on?"    
"I look ahead, and I see a narrow path leading up among the rocks. Such  paths are countless in the wilderness, and many of them are untrodden,  but the one before my eyes has sustained footsteps many times."    
"Come down to earth, Tayoga, and tell me what you see."    
"I see on the rocks on either side of this path long, coarse hairs. They  were left by a wild animal going back and forth to its den. It was a  large wild animal, else it would not have scraped against the rocks on  either side. It was probably a bear, and if you will hand me the two or  three twisted hairs in the crevice at your elbow I will tell you."    
Robert brought them to him and Tayoga nodded assent.    
"Aye, it was a bear," he said, "and a big one."    
"But how do you know his den is only two or three hundred yards away?"    
"That is a matter of looking as far as the eyes can reach. If you will  only lift yours and gaze over the tops of those bushes you will see that  the path ends against a high stone face or wall, too steep for climbing.  So the den must be there, and let us hope, Dagaeoga, that it is large  enough for us both. The bear is likely to be away, as this is summer.  Now, lift me up. I have talked all the talk that is in me and as much as  I have strength to utter."    
Robert carried him again, and it was hard traveling up the steep and  rocky path, but Tayoga's words were quickly proved to be true. In the  crumbling face of the stone cliff they found not only an opening but  several, the bear having preferred one of the smaller to the largest,  which ran back eight or ten feet and which was roomy enough to house a  dozen men. It bore no animal odor, and there was before it an abundance  of dead leaves that could be taken in for shelter.    
"Now Manitou is kind," said Tayoga, "or it may be that Areskoui and  Tododaho are still keeping their personal watch over us. Lay me in the  cave, Dagaeoga. Thou hast acquitted thyself as a true friend. No sachem  of the Onondagas, however great, could have been greater in fidelity and  courage."    
Robert made two beds of leaves. On one he spread the blanket that was  strapped to Tayoga's back. Then he built his own place and felt that  they were sheltered and secure for the time, and in truth they were  housed as well as millions of cave men for untold centuries had been. It  was a good cave, sweet-smelling, with pure, clean air, and Robert saw  that if it rained the water would not come in at the door, but would run  past it down the slope, which in itself was one of the luckiest strokes  of fortune.    
Tayoga lay on his blanket on his bed of leaves, and, looking up at the  rough and rocky roof, smiled. He had begged Robert to leave him and go  to the battle, and he knew that if his comrade had gone, he, wounded as  he was, would surely have perished. If a hostile skirmisher did not find  him, which was more than likely, he would have been overcome by the  fever of his wound, and, lying unconscious while some rainstorm swept  over him, his last chance would be gone. He could feel the fever  creeping into his veins now, and he knew that they had found the refuge  just in time. Yet he was grateful and cheerful, and in his heart he said  silent thanks to Tododaho, Areskoui and Manitou. Then he called to  Robert.    
"See if you can find water," he said. "There should be more than one  stream among these rocky hollows. Bring the water here in your cap and  wash my wound."    
Iroquois therapeutics were very simple, but wonderfully effective, and,  as Robert had seen both Onondagas and Mohawks practice their healing  art, he understood. He discovered a good stream not many yards away, and  carefully removing Tayoga's bandages, and bringing his cap filled to the  brim with water, he cleansed the wound thoroughly. Then the bandages  were put on again firmly and securely. This in most cases constituted  the whole of the Iroquois treatment, so far as the physical body was  concerned. The wound must be kept absolutely clean and away from the  air, nature doing the rest. Now and then the juices of powerful herbs  were used, but they were not needed for one so young and so wholesome in  blood as Tayoga.    
When the operation was finished the Onondaga lay back on his bed and  smiled once more at the rough and rocky roof.    
"Again you show signs of intelligence, Dagaeoga," he said. "As you have  learned to be a warrior, perhaps you can learn to be a medicine man  also, not the medicine man who deals with spirits, but one who heals.  Now, as you have done your part, I shall do mine."    
"What do you mean, Tayoga?"    
"I will resolve to be well. You know that among my people the healers  held in highest honor are those who do not acknowledge the existence of  any disease at all. The patient is sick because he has not willed that  he should be well. So the medicine man exerts a will for him and by  reciting to himself prayers or charms drives away the complaint which  the sick man fancies that he has. Now, I do not accept all their belief.  A bullet has gone through my shoulder, and I know it. Nothing can alter  the fact. Yet I do know that the will has great control over the nerves,  which direct the body, and I shall strengthen my will as much as I can,  and make it order my body to get well."    
Robert knew that what he said was true. Already the Iroquois were, and  long had been, practicing what came to be known much later among the  white people as Christian Science.    
"Try to sleep, Tayoga," he said. "I know the power of your will. If you  order yourself to sleep, sleep you will. I have your rifle and mine, and  if the enemy should come I think I can hold 'em off."    
"They will not come," said Tayoga, "at least, not today nor in the night  that will follow. They are so busy with the Great Bear and the Mountain  Wolf and Daganoweda that they will not have time to hunt among the hills  for the two who have sought refuge here. What of the skies, Dagaeoga?  What do they promise?"    
Robert, standing in the entrance, took a long look at the heavens.    
"Rain," he replied at last; "I can see clouds gathering in the west, and  a storm is likely to come with the night. I think I hear distant  thunder, but it is so low I'm not sure."    
"Areskoui is good to us once more. The kindness of his heart is never  exhausted. Truly, O Dagaeoga, he has been a shield between us and our  enemies. Now the rain will come, it will pour hard, it will sweep along  the slopes, and wash away any faint trace of a trail that we may have  left, thus hiding our flight from the eyes of wandering warriors."    
"All that's true, and now that you've explained it to your satisfaction,  you obey me, exercise your will and go to sleep. I've recovered my  rulership, and I mean to exercise it to the full for the little time  that it may last."    
Tayoga obeyed, composing himself in the easiest attitude on his blanket  and bed of leaves, and he exerted his will to the utmost. He wished  sleep, and sleep must come, yet he knew that the fever was still rising  in his veins. The shock and loss of blood from the great musket ball  could not be dismissed by a mere effort of the mind, but the mind  nevertheless could fight against their effects and neutralize them.    
As the fever rose steadily he exerted his will with increasing power. He  said to himself again and again how fortunate he was to be watched over  by such a brave and loyal friend, and to have a safe and dry refuge,  when other warriors of his nation, wounded, had lain in the forest to  die of exhaustion or to be devoured by wild beasts. He knew from the  feel of the air that a storm was coming, and again he was thankful to  his patron saint, Tododaho, and also to Areskoui, and to Manitou,  greatest of all, because a bed and a roof had been found for him in  this, the hour of his greatest need.    
The mounting fever in his veins seemed to make his senses more vivid  and acute for the time. Although Robert could not yet hear in reality  the rumbling thunder far down in the southwest, the menace came very  plainly to the ears of Tayoga, but it was no menace to him. Instead, the  rumble was the voice of a friend, telling him that the deluge was at  hand to wash away all traces of their flight and to force their enemies  into shelter, while his fever burned itself out.    
Tayoga on his blanket, with the thick couch of dry leaves beneath, could  still see the figure of Robert, rifle across his knees, crouched at the  doorway, a black silhouette against the fading sky. The Onondaga knew  that he would watch until the storm came in full flood, and nothing  would escape his keen eyes and ears. Dagaeoga was a worthy pupil of  Willet, known to the Hodenosaunee as the Great Bear, a man of surpassing  skill.    
Tayoga also heard the rushing of the rain, far off, coming, perhaps,  from Andiatarocte, and presently he saw the flashes of lightning, every  one a vast red blaze to his feverish eyes. It was only by the light of  these saber strokes across the sky that he could now see Robert, as the  dark had come, soon to be followed by floods of rain. Then he closed his  eyes, and calling incessantly for sleep, refused to open them again.  Sleep came by and by, though it was Tarenyawagon, the sender of dreams,  who presided over it, because as he slept, and his fever grew higher,  visions, many and fantastic, flitted through his disordered brain.    
Robert watched until long after the rain had been pouring in sheets,  and it was pitchy dark in the cave. Then he felt of Tayoga's forehead  and his pulse, and observed the fever, though without alarm. Tayoga's  wound was clean and his blood absolutely pure. The fever was due and it  would run its course. He could do nothing more for his comrade at  present, and lying down on his own spread of leaves, he soon fell  asleep.    
Robert's slumber was not sound. Although the Onondaga might be watched  over by Tododaho, Areskoui and even Manitou himself, he had felt the  weight of responsibility. The gods protected those who protected  themselves, and, even while he slept, the thought was nestling somewhere  in his brain and awoke him now and then. Upon every such occasion he sat  up and looked out at the entrance of the cave, to see, as he had hoped,  only the darkness and black sheets of driving rain, and also upon every  occasion devout thanks rose up in his throat. Tayoga had not prayed to  his patron saint and to the great Areskoui and Manitou in vain, else in  all that wilderness, given over to night and storm, they would not have  found so good a refuge and shelter.    
Tayoga's fever increased, and when morning came, with the rain still  falling, though not in such a deluge as by night, it seemed to Robert,  who had seen many gunshot wounds, that it was about at the zenith. The  Onondaga came out of his sleep, but he was delirious for a little while,  Robert sitting by him, covering him with his blanket and seeing that his  hurt was kept away from the air.    
The rain ceased by and by, but heavy fogs and vapors floated over the  mountains, so dense that Robert could not see more than fifteen or  twenty feet beyond the mouth of the cave, in front of which a stream of  water from the rain a foot deep was flowing. He was thankful. He knew  that fog and flood together would hide them in absolute security for  another day and night at least.    
He ate a little venison and regretted that he did not have a small  skillet in which he could make soup for Tayoga later on, but since he  did not have it he resolved to pound venison into shreds between stones,  when the time came. Examining Tayoga again, he found, to his great joy,  that the fever was decreasing, and he washed the wound anew. Then he sat  by him a long time while the morning passed. Tayoga, who had been  muttering in his fever, sank into silence, and about noon, opening his  eyes, he said in a weak voice:    
"How long have we been here, Dagaeoga?"    
"About half of the second day is now gone," replied Robert, "and your  fever has gone with it. You're as limp as a towel, but you're started  fairly on the road to recovery."    
"I know it," said Tayoga gratefully, "and I am thankful to Tododaho, to  Areskoui, to Manitou, greatest of all, and to you, Dagaeoga, without  whom the great spirits of earth and air would have let me perish."    
"You don't owe me anything, Tayoga. It's what one comrade has a right to  expect of another. Did you exert your will, as you said, when you were  delirious, and help along nature with your cure?"    
"I did, Dagaeoga. Before I lapsed into the unconsciousness of which you  speak, I resolved that today, when my fever should have passed, my soul  should lift me up. I concentrated my mind upon it, I attuned every nerve  to that end, and while I could not prevent the fever and the weakness,  yet the resolution to get well fast helps me to do so. By so much does  my mind rule over my body."    
"I've no doubt you're right about it. Courage and optimism can lift us  up a lot, as I've seen often for myself, and you're certainly out of  danger now, Tayoga. All you have to do is to lie quiet, if the French  and Indians will let us. In a week you'll be able to travel and fight,  and in a few weeks you'll never know that a musket ball passed through  your shoulder. When do you think you can eat? I'll pound some of the  venison very fine."    
"Not before night, and then but little. That little, though, I should  have. Tomorrow I will eat much more, and a few days later it will be all  Dagaeoga can do to find enough food for me. Be sure that you wait on me  well. It is the first rest that I have had in a long time, and it is my  purpose to enjoy it. If I should be fretful, humor me; if I should be  hungry, feed me; if I should be sleepy, let me sleep, and see that I am  not disturbed while I do sleep; if my bed is hard, make me a better, and  through it all, O Dagaeoga, be thou the finest medicine man that ever  breathed in these woods."    
"Come, now, Tayoga, you lay too great a burden upon me. I'm not all the  excellencies melted into one, and I've never pretended to be. But I can  see that you're getting well, because the spirit of rulership is upon  you as strong as ever, and, since you're so much improved, I may take  it into my mind to obey your commands, though only when I feel like it."    
The two lads looked at each other and laughed, and there was immense  relief in Robert's laugh. Only now did he admit to himself that he had  been terribly alarmed about Tayoga, and he recognized the enormous  relief he felt when the Onondaga had passed his crisis.    
"In truth, you pick up fast, Tayoga," he said whimsically. "Suppose we  go forth now and hunt the enemy. We might finish up what Rogers, Willet  and Daganoweda have left of St. Luc's force."    
"I would go," replied Tayoga in the same tone, "but Tododaho and  Areskoui have told me to bide here awhile. Only a fear that my  disobedience might cause me to lose their favor keeps me in the cave.  But I wish you to bear in mind, Dagaeoga, that I still exert my will as  the medicine men of my nation bid the sick and the hurt to do, and that  I feel the fevered blood cooling in my veins, strength flowing back into  my weak muscles, and my nerves, that were all so loose and unattuned,  becoming steady."    
"I'll admit that your will may help, Tayoga, but it's chiefly the long  sleep you've had, the good home you enjoy, and the superb care of Dr.  Robert Lennox of Albany, New York, and the Vale of Onondaga. On the  whole, weighing the question carefully, I should say that the  ministrations of Dr. Lennox constitute at least eighty per cent of the  whole."    
"You are still the great talker, Dagaeoga, that you were when you  defeated St. Luc in the test of words in the Vale of Onondaga, and it is  well. The world needs good talkers, those who can make speech flow in a  golden stream, else we should all grow dull and gloomy, though I will  say for you, O Lennox, that you act as well as talk. If I did not, I,  whose life you have saved and who have seen you great in battle, should  have little gratitude and less perception."    
"I've always told you, Tayoga, that when you speak English you speak out  of a book, because you learned it out of a book and you take delight in  long words. Now I think that 'gratitude' and 'perception' are enough for  you and you can rest."    
"I will rest, but it is not because you think my words are long and I am  exhausted, Dagaeoga. It is because you wish to have all the time  yourself for talking. You are cunning, but you need not be so now. I  give my time to you."    
Robert laughed. The old Tayoga with all his keenness and sense of humor  was back again, and it was a sure sign that a rapid recovery had set in.    
"Maybe you can go to sleep again," he said. "I think it was a stupor  rather than sleep that you passed through last night, but now you ought  to find sleep sweet, sound and healthy."    
"You speak words of truth, O great white medicine man, and it being so  my mind will make my body obey your instructions."    
He turned a little on his side, away from his wounded shoulder, and  either his will was very powerful or his body was willing, as he soon  slept again, and now Tarenyawagon sent him no troubled and disordered  dreams. Instead his breathing was deep and regular, and when Robert felt  his pulse he found it was almost normal. The fever was gone and the  bronze of Tayoga's face assumed a healthful tint.    
Then Robert took a piece of venison, and pounded it well between two  stones. He would have been glad to light a fire of dry leaves and  sticks, that he might warm the meat, but he knew that it was yet too  dangerous, and so strong was Tayoga's constitution that he might take  the food cold, and yet find it nutritious.    
It was late in the afternoon when the Onondaga awoke, yawned in human  fashion, and raised himself a little on his unwounded shoulder.    
"Here is your dinner, Tayoga," said Robert, presenting the shredded  venison. "I'm sorry it's not better, but it's the best the lodge  affords, and I, as chief medicine man and also as first assistant  medicine man and second assistant medicine man, bid you eat and find no  fault."    
"I obey, O physician, wise and stern, despite your youth," said Tayoga.  "I am hungry, which is a most excellent sign, and I will say, too, that  I begin to feel like a warrior again."    
He ate as much as Robert would let him have, and then, with a great sigh  of content, sank back on his bed of leaves.    
"I can feel my wound healing," he said. "Already the clean flesh is  spreading over the hurt and the million tiny strands are knitting  closely together. Some day it shall be said in the Vale of Onondaga that  the wound of Tayoga healed more quickly than the wound of any other  warrior of our nation."    
"Good enough as a prophecy, but for the present we'll bathe and bind it  anew. A little good doctoring is a wonderful help to will and  prediction."    
Robert once more cleansed the hurt very thoroughly, and he was surprised  to find its extremely healthy condition. It had already begun to heal, a  proof of amazing vitality on the part of Tayoga, and unless the  unforeseen occurred he would set a record in recovery. Robert heaped the  leaves under his head to form a pillow, and the young warrior's eyes  sparkled as he looked around at their snug abode.    
"I can hear the water running by the mouth of the cave," he said. "It  comes from last night's rain and flood, but what of tonight, Dagaeoga?  The skies and what they have to say mean much to us."    
"It will rain again. I've been looking out. All the west is heavy with  clouds and the light winds come, soaked with damp. I don't claim to be  any prophet like you, Tayoga, because I'm a modest man, I am, but the  night will be wet and dark."    
"Then we are still under the protection of Tododaho, of Areskoui and of  Manitou, greatest of all. Let the dark come quickly and the rain fall  heavily, because they will be a veil about us to hide us from Tandakora  and his savages."    
All that the Onondaga wished came to pass. The clouds, circling about  the horizon, soon spread to the zenith, and covered the heavens, hiding  the moon and the last star. The rain came, not in a flood, but in a cold  and steady pour lasting all night. The night was not only dark and wet  outside, but it was very chill also, though in the cave the two young  warriors, the white and the red, were warm and dry on their blankets  and beds of leaves.    
Robert pounded more of the venison the next morning and gave Tayoga  twice as much as he had eaten the day before. The Onondaga clamored for  an additional supply, but Robert would not let him have it.    
"Epicure! Gourmand! Gorger!" said young Lennox. "Would you do nothing  but eat? Do you think it your chief duty in this world to be a glutton?"    
"No, Dagaeoga," replied Tayoga, "I am not a glutton, but I am yet  hungry, and I warn thee, O grudging medicine man, that I am growing  strong fast. I feel upon my arm muscles that were not there yesterday  and tomorrow or the next day my strength will be so great that I shall  take from you all the food of us both and eat it."    
"By that time we won't have any left, and I shall have to take measures  to secure a new supply. I must go forth in search of game."    
"Not today, nor yet tomorrow. It is too dangerous. You must wait until  the last moment. It is barely possible that the Great Bear or Black  Rifle may find us."    
"I don't think so. We'll have to rely on ourselves. But at any rate,  I'll stay in the cave today, though I think the rain is about over.  Don't you see the sun shining in at the entrance? It's going to be a  fine day in the woods, Tayoga, but it won't be a fine day for us."    
"That is true, Dagaeoga. It is hard to stay here in a hole in the rocks,  when the sun is shining and the earth is drying. The sun has brought  back the green to the leaves and the light now must be wonderful on  Andiatarocte and Oneadatote. Their waters shift and change with all the  colors of the rainbow. It fills me with longing when I think of these  things. Go now, Dagaeoga, and find the Great Bear, the Mountain Wolf and  Daganoweda. I am well past all danger from my wound, and I can take care  of myself."    
"Tayoga, you talk like a foolish child. If I hear any more such words I  shall have to gag you, for two reasons, because they make a weariness in  my ear, and because if anyone else were to hear you he would think you  were weak of mind. It's your reputation for sanity that I'm thinking  about most. You and I stay here together, and when we leave we leave  together."    
Tayoga said no more on the subject. He had known all the while that  Robert would not leave him, but he had wished to give him the chance. He  lay very quiet now for many hours, and Robert sitting at the door of the  cave, with his rifle across his knees, was also quiet. While a great  talker upon occasion, he had learned from the Iroquois the habit of  silence, when silence was needed, and it required no effort from him.    
Though he did not speak he saw much. The stream, caused by the flood,  still flowed before the mouth of the cave, but it was diminishing  steadily. By the time night came it would sink to a thin thread and  vanish. The world itself, bathed and cleansed anew, was wonderfully  sweet and fresh. The light wind brought the pleasant odors of flower and  leaf and grass. Birds began to sing on the overhanging boughs, and a  rabbit or two appeared in the valley. These unconscious sentinels made  him feel quite sure that no savages were near.    
Curiosity about the battle between the forces of St. Luc and those of  the rangers and Mohawks, smothered hitherto by his anxiety and care for  Tayoga, was now strong in his breast. It was barely possible that St.  Luc had spread a successful ambush and that all of his friends had  fallen. He shuddered at the thought, and then dismissed it as too  unlikely. Tayoga fell asleep again, and when he awoke he was not only  able to sit up, but to walk across the cave.    
"Tomorrow," he said, "I shall be able to sit near the entrance and load  and fire a rifle as well as ever. If an enemy should come I think I  could hold the refuge alone."    
"That being the case," said Robert, "and you being full of pride and  haughtiness, I may let you have the chance. Not many shreds of our  venison are left, and as I shall have in you a raging wolf to feed, I'll  go forth and seek game. It seems to me I ought to find it soon. You  don't think it's all been driven away by marching rangers and warriors,  do you, Tayoga?"    
"No, the rangers and warriors have been seeking one another, not the  game, and perhaps the deer and the moose know it. Why does man think  that Manitou watches over him alone? Perhaps He has told the big animals  that they are safer when the men fight. On our way here I twice saw the  tracks of a moose, and it may be your fortune to find one tomorrow,  Dagaeoga."    
"Not fortune, at all, Tayoga. If I bring down one it will be due to my  surpassing skill in trailing and to my deadly sharpshooting, for which  I am renowned the world over. Anyhow, I think we can sleep another night  without a guard and then we'll see what tomorrow will bring forth."
