   An hour ago, under the marvelous canopy of the blue northern sky,   David Carrigan, Sergeant in His Most Excellent Majesty's Royal   Northwest Mounted Police, had hummed softly to himself, and had   thanked God that he was alive. He had blessed McVane,  superintendent  of &quot;N&quot; Division at Athabasca Landing, for detailing  him to the mission  on which he was bent. He was glad that he was  traveling alone, and in  the deep forest, and that for many weeks  his adventure would carry him  deeper and deeper into his beloved  north. Making his noonday tea over  a fire at the edge of the  river, with the green forest crowding like  an inundation on three  sides of him, he had come to the  conclusion&#8212;for the hundredth  time, perhaps&#8212;that it was a nice thing  to be alone in the world,  for he was on what his comrades at the  Landing called a &quot;bad  assignment.&quot; 
  &quot;If anything happens to me,&quot; Carrigan had said to McVane, &quot;there   isn't anybody in particular to notify. I lost out in the matter of   family a long time ago.&quot; 
  He was not a man who talked much about himself, even to the   superintendent of &quot;N&quot; Division, yet there were a thousand who  loved  Dave Carrigan, and many who placed their confidences in him.   Superintendent Me Vane had one story which he might have told, but  he  kept it to himself, instinctively sensing the sacredness of it.  Even  Carrigan did not know that the one thing which never passed  his lips  was known to McVane. 
  Of that, too, he had been thinking an hour ago. It was the thing   which, first of all, had driven him into the north. And though it  had  twisted and disrupted the earth under his feet for a time, it  had  brought its compensation. For he had come to love the north  with a  passionate devotion. It was, in a way, his God. It seemed  to him that  the time had never been when he had lived any other  life than this  under the open skies. He was thirty-seven now. A  bit of a philosopher,  as philosophy comes to one in a sun-cleaned  and unpolluted air, A  good-humored brother of humanity, even when  he put manacles on other  men's wrists; graying a little over the  temples&#8212;and a lover of life.  Above all else he was that. A lover  of life. A worshiper at the shrine  of God's Country. 
  So he sat, that hour ago, deep in the wilderness eighty miles   north of Athabasca Landing, congratulating himself on the present   conditions of his existence. A hundred and eighty miles farther on   was Fort McMurray, and another two hundred beyond that was  Chipewyan,  and still beyond that the Mackenzie and its fifteen-  hundred-mile  trail to the northern sea. He was glad there was no  end to this world  of his. He was glad there were few people in it.  But these people he  loved. That hour ago he had looked out on the  river as two York boats  had forged up against the stream, craft  like the long, slim galleys of  old, brought over through the  Churchill and Clearwater countries from  Hudson's Bay. There were  eight rowers in each boat. They were singing.  Their voices rolled  between the walls of the forests. Their naked arms  and shoulders  glistened in the sun. They rowed like Vikings, and to  him they  were symbols of the freedom of the world. He had watched them   until they were gone up-stream, but it was a long time before the   chanting of their voices had died away. And then he had risen from   beside his tiny fire, and had stretched himself until his muscles   cracked. It was good to feel the blood running red and strong in   one's veins at the age of thirty-seven. For Carrigan felt the  thrill  of these days when strong men were coming out of the north  &#8212;days when  the glory of June hung over the land, when out of the  deep wilderness  threaded by the Three Rivers came romance and  courage and red-blooded  men and women of an almost forgotten  people to laugh and sing and  barter for a time with the outpost  guardians of a younger and more  progressive world. It was north of  Fifty-Four, and the waters of a  continent flowed toward the Arctic  Sea. Yet soon would the  strawberries be crushing red underfoot;  the forest road was in bloom,  scarlet fire-flowers reddened the  trail, wild hyacinths and  golden-freckled violets played hide-  and-seek with the forget-me-nots  in the meadows, and the sky was a  great splash of velvety blue. It was  the north triumphant&#8212;at the  edge of civilization; the north  triumphant, and yet paying its  tribute. For at the other end were  waiting the royal Upper Ten  Thousand and the smart Four Hundred with  all the beau monde behind  them, coveting and demanding that tribute to  their sex&#8212;the silken  furs of a far country, the life's blood and  labor of a land  infinitely beyond the pale of drawing-rooms and the  whims of  fashion. 
  Carrigan had thought of these things that hour ago, as he sat at   the edge of the first of the Three Rivers, the great Athabasca.  From  down the other two, the Slave and the Mackenzie, the fur  fleets of the  unmapped country had been toiling since the first  breakups of ice.  Steadily, week after week, the north had been  emptying itself of its  picturesque tide of life and voice, of  muscle and brawn, of laughter  and song&#8212;and wealth. Through, long  months of deep winter, in ten  thousand shacks and tepees and  cabins, the story of this June had been  written as fate had  written it each winter for a hundred years or  more. A story of the  triumph of the fittest. A story of tears, of  happiness here and  there, of hunger and plenty, of new life and quick  death; a story  of strong men and strong women, living in the faith of  their  forefathers, with the best blood of old England and France still   surviving in their veins. 
  Through those same months of winter, the great captains of trade   in the city of Edmonton had been preparing for the coming of the   river brigades. The hundred and fifty miles of trail between that   last city outpost of civilization and Athabasca Landing, the door   that opened into the North, were packed hard by team and dog-  sledge  and packer bringing up the freight that for another year  was to last  the forest people of the Three River country&#8212;a domain  reaching from  the Landing to the Arctic Ocean. In competition  fought the drivers of  Revillon Brothers and Hudson's Bay, of free  trader and independent  adventurer. Freight that grew more precious  with each mile it advanced  must reach the beginning of the  waterway. It started with the early  snows. The tide was at full by  midwinter. In temperature that nipped  men's lungs it did not  cease. There was no let-up in the whip-hands of  the masters of  trade at Edmonton, Winnipeg, Montreal, and London  across the sea.  It was not a work of philanthropy. These men cared not  whether  Jean and Jacqueline and Pierre and Marie were well-fed or  hungry,  whether they lived or died, so far as humanity was concerned.  But  Paris, Vienna, London, and the great capitals of the earth must   have their furs&#8212;and unless that freight went north, there would  be  no velvety offerings for the white shoulders of the world.  Christmas  windows two years hence would be bare. A feminine wail  of grief would  rise to the skies. For woman must have her furs,  and in return for  those furs Jean and Jacqueline and Pierre and  Marie must have their  freight. So the pendulum swung, as it had  swung for a century or two,  touching, on the one side, luxury,  warmth, wealth, and beauty; on the  other, cold and hardship, deep  snows and open skies&#8212;with that  precious freight the thing  between. 
  And now, in this year before rail and steamboat, the glory of   early summer was at hand, and the wilderness people were coming up  to  meet the freight. The Three Rivers&#8212;the Athabasca, the Slave,  and the  Mackenzie, all joining in one great two-thousand-mile  waterway to the  northern sea&#8212;were athrill with the wild impulse  and beat of life as  the forest people lived it. The Great Father  had sent in his treaty  money, and Cree song and Chipewyan chant  joined the age-old melodies  of French and half-breed. Countless  canoes drove past the slower and  mightier scow brigades; huge York  boats with two rows of oars heaved  up and down like the ancient  galleys of Rome; tightly woven cribs of  timber, and giant rafts  made tip of many cribs were ready for their  long drift into a  timberless country. On this two-thousand-mile  waterway a world had  gathered. It was the Nile of the northland, and  each post and  gathering place along its length was turned into a  metropolis,  half savage, archaic, splendid with the strength of red  blood,  clear eyes, and souls that read the word of God in wind and  tree. 
  And up and down this mighty waterway of wilderness trade ran the   whispering spirit of song, like the voice of a mighty god heard  under  the stars and in the winds. 
  But it was an hour ago that David Carrigan had vividly pictured   these things to himself close to the big river, and many things  may  happen in the sixty minutes that follow any given minute in a  man's  life. That hour ago his one great purpose had been to bring  in Black  Roger Audemard, alive or dead&#8212;Black Roger, the forest  fiend who had  destroyed half a dozen lives in a blind passion of  vengeance nearly  fifteen years ago. For ten of those fifteen years  it had been thought  that Black Roger was dead. But mysterious  rumors had lately come out  of the North. He was alive. People had  seen him. Fact followed rumor.  His existence became certainty. The  Law took up once more his  hazardous trail, and David Carrigan was  the messenger it sent. 
  &quot;Bring him back, alive or dead,&quot; were Superintendent McVane's last   words. 
  And now, thinking of that parting injunction, Carrigan grinned,   even as the sweat of death dampened his face in the heat of the   afternoon sun. For at the end of those sixty minutes that had  passed  since his midday pot of tea, the grimly, atrociously  unexpected had  happened, like a thunderbolt out of the azure of  the sky.
