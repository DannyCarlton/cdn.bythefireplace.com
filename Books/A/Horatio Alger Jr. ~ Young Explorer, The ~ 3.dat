    During the week which Ben had agreed to take before coming to a   final decision, he had another offer of employment. 
  This is how it came about: 
  A little out of the village, in a handsome house, the best in   Hampton, lived Major Sturgis, a wealthy landholder, who had plenty  to  live upon and nothing in particular to do, except to look after  his  property. He was a portly man, who walked with a slow, dignified  step,  leaning on a gold-headed cane, and evidently felt his  importance. His  son, Sam, was a chip of the old block. He  condescended to associate  with the village boys, because solitary  grandeur is not altogether  pleasant. He occasionally went to New  York to visit a cousin of about  his own age. From such a visit he  had just returned, bringing back  with him a new idea. 
  &quot;Father,&quot; he said, &quot;Cousin Henry has a boy about his own age to  wait  on him, black his boots, and run errands.&quot; 
  &quot;Has he?&quot; asked the major mechanically, not looking up from the   daily paper which he was reading. 
  &quot;Yes, sir. He don't pay him much, you know, only five dollars a   month and his board, and Henry finds it very convenient.&quot; 
  Major Sturgis did not reply. In fact, he was too much interested in   the article he was reading. 
  &quot;Ain't you as rich as uncle?&quot; asked Sam, who was gradually leading   up to his proposal. 
  &quot;Yes, Sam, I think so,&quot; answered his father, laying down the paper   and removing his gold-bowed spectacles. 
  &quot;Then why won't you let me have a servant, too?&quot; 
  &quot;What do you want of a servant? There are servants enough in the   house.&quot; 
  &quot;I want a boy to follow me round, and do just what I bid him.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see any necessity for it.&quot; 
  &quot;He could do errands for you, too, father,&quot; said Sam  diplomatically. 
  &quot;We would have to send to the city for a boy, in case I let you  have  one.&quot; 
  &quot;No, we wouldn't,&quot; answered Sam. 
  &quot;Do you know of any one around here?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; there is Ben Stanton. He's got to find something to do.&quot; 
  &quot;I thought you didn't like Ben Stanton,&quot; said the major, in some   surprise. &quot;I have heard you say-&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, he's rather uppish-feels too big for a poor boy; but I would   soon train him. I'd make him know his place.&quot; 
  &quot;Your remarks are well founded, my son. Only yesterday I met the  boy  on the village street, and instead of taking off his hat and  making  a low bow, as he should do to a man of my position, he nodded   carelessly, and said. 'How are you, major?' Really, I don't know  what  the country is coming to, when the rising generation is so  deficient  in veneration.&quot; 
  &quot;The fact is, father, Ben thinks himself as good as anybody. You'd   think, by the way he speaks to me, that he considered himself my   equal.&quot; 
  &quot;That is one of the evils incident to a republican form of   government,&quot; said the major pompously. &quot;For my part, I prefer the   English social system, where the gentry are treated with proper   deference.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, father, may I engage Ben as my servant?&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid you would not find him properly subordinate.&quot; 
  &quot;Just leave that to me,&quot; said Sam confidently. &quot;If I can't teach  him  his place, then nobody can. I should enjoy having him to order   about.&quot; 
  Sam generally carried his point with his father, and the present   instance was no exception. 
  &quot;I don't know that I have any particular objection,&quot; said the  major. 
  &quot;How much wages may I offer, father?&quot; 
  &quot;The same that your Cousin Henry's servant gets.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, sir,&quot; said Sam, with satisfaction. &quot;I guess I'll go   round, and see him about it this afternoon. I suppose he can come  any  time?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, my son.&quot; 
  As Sam went out of the room his father thought, complacently: 
  &quot;My son has all the pride and instincts of a gentleman. He will do   credit to the family.&quot; 
  Few persons in the village would have agreed with the major. Sam   Sturgis was decidedly unpopular. No boy who puts on airs is likely  to  be a favorite with any class of persons, and Sam put on rather  more  than he was entitled to. From time to time he received a  rebuff, but  still money will tell. He had his followers and  sycophants, but we may  be sure that Ben was not numbered among them.  It was quite useless for  Sam to patronize him-he would not be  patronized, but persisted in  treating the major's son with the most  exasperating familiarity. Of  course this would be impossible if he  became Sam's servant, and this  more than anything else was the  motive of the young aristocrat in  wishing to engage him. As to  conferring a favor on Ben, that was the  last thing in his thoughts. 
  Sam bent his steps toward the humble home of Job Stanton, but he  did  not have to go the whole distance. He met Ben with a fishing-pole   over his shoulder. 
  &quot;How are you, Sam?&quot; was Ben's familiar greeting. &quot;Want to go  fishing  with me?&quot; 
  &quot;He's entirely too familiar,&quot; thought Sam. &quot;I'll cure him of that   when he is under my orders.&quot; 
  At present Sam did not think it politic to express his feelings on   the subject. Ben was so independent that it might frustrate his  plan. 
  &quot;I will walk along with you, Ben,&quot; said Sam condescendingly. 
  &quot;All right. Haven't you got a fishing-pole at home?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I have a very handsome one; it cost five dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;Then it's rather ahead of mine,&quot; said Ben. 
  &quot;I should say so,&quot; remarked Sam, surveying Ben's pole with  contempt. 
  &quot;But I'll bet you can't catch as many fish with it,&quot; said Ben   promptly. &quot;I don't think it makes much difference to the fish,&quot; he   added, with a laugh, &quot;whther they are caught with a five-dollar pole   or a five-cent one.&quot; 
  &quot;Very likely,&quot; said Sam briefly, &quot;but I prefer to use a nice pole.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, there's no objection,&quot; said Ben, &quot;if you fancy it. It doesn't   make any difference to me.&quot; 
  &quot;When are you going to work?&quot; asked Sam abruptly. 
  &quot;I am working every day-that is, I am helping Uncle Job.&quot; 
  &quot;But I suppose you mean to get regular work somewhere, don't you?&quot; 
  &quot;What's he after, I wonder?&quot; thought Ben. &quot;Maybe I do,&quot; he said   aloud. 
  &quot;Perhaps I can throw something in your way,&quot; said Sam, in a   patronizing way. 
  &quot;You are very kind,&quot; said Ben, who supposed Sam had heard of some   business position which he could fill. Our hero decided that perhaps   he had misjudged the major's son, and he was prepared to make  amends.  &quot;If you get me a position, I shall be much obliged.&quot; 
  &quot;The fact is,&quot; said Sam, &quot;I should find it convenient to have a boy   go about with me, and be at my orders. My Cousin Henry has one, and   father says I may engage you.&quot; 
  Ben faced round, and looked steadily at Sam. He felt that he would   far rather work for Deacon Pitkin, in spite of his meager table, or   toil twelve hours a day in his uncle's shoe-shop, than accept such a   place as was now offered him. He penetrated Sam's motive, and felt   incensed with him, though he did not choose to show it. 
  &quot;What are you willing to pay?&quot; asked Ben, in a businesslike tone. 
  &quot;Five dollars a month and your board,&quot; said Sam. &quot;You'll live  better  than you ever did before in your life, and your duties will be   easy.&quot; 
  &quot;What would you want me to do?&quot; asked Ben. 
  &quot;Why, I would take you with me whenever I went out rowing or   fishing. That would be easy enough. Then, in the morning you would   black my shoes and keep my clothes well brushed, and go of any   errands I had for you. Oh, well, I can't tell you all you would have   to do, but you'd have an easy time.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I don't think it would tire me out,&quot; said Ben. &quot;You'd want me   to black your boots?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I might agree to that on one condition.&quot; 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; 
  &quot;That you would black mine.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded Sam, his face flushing angrily. 
  &quot;Just what I say.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you mean to insult me?&quot; 
  &quot;Not a bit; any more than you mean to insult me,&quot; 
  &quot;Do you dare to propose that I, a gentleman, should black your   low-lived shoes?&quot; exclaimed Sam furiously. 
  &quot;I think you're rather hard on my shoes,&quot; said Ben, laughing. &quot;I'll   come for four dollars a month, if you'll do that.&quot; 
  &quot;I never heard such impudence,&quot; said Sam, in concentrated wrath. &quot;I   never was so repaid for kindness before.&quot; 
  &quot;Look here, Sam,&quot; said Ben, &quot;I understand just how kind you are.  You  want the satisfaction of ordering me round, and you can't have it.  I  decline your offer. I'd rather beg for bread than accept it.&quot; 
  &quot;You may starve, for all me,&quot; said Sam. &quot;It's ridiculous for a poor   boy to put on such airs. You'll die in the poorhouse yet.&quot; 
  &quot;I won't live there, if I can help it. What! are you going to leave   me?&quot; 
  &quot;I won't condescend to be seen with you.&quot; 
  &quot;Good-by, Sam. I hope you won't have to black your own boots.&quot; 
  Sam did not deign a reply. 
  &quot;He looks mad,&quot; thought Ben. &quot;I'd live on one meal a day rather  than  let him order me round.&quot;
