  In the star dusk of evening the time came when he spoke his fears   to Father John. 
  Nada had gone into her room, taking Peter with her, and out under   the cool of the skies Father John's pale face was turned up to the   unending glory of the firmament, and his lips were whispering a   prayer of gratitude and blessing, when Roger laid a hand gently on   his arm. 
  &quot;Father,&quot; he said, &quot;it is a wonderful night.&quot; 
  &quot;A night of gladness and omen,&quot; replied Father John. &quot;See the   stars! They seem to be alive and rejoicing, and it is not  sacrilege  to believe they are, giving you their benediction.&quot; 
  &quot;And yet&#8212;I am afraid.&quot; 
  &quot;Afraid?&quot; 
  Father John looked into his eyes, and saw him staring off over the   forest-tops. 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;afraid for her.&quot; 
  Briefly he told him of what had happened on the Barren months ago,   and how he had narrowly escaped Breault in coming away from the   burned country. 
  &quot;He is on my trail,&quot; he said, &quot;and tonight he is not very far   away.&quot; 
  The Missioner's hand rested in a comforting way on his arm. 
  &quot;You did not kill Jed Hawkins, my son, and for that we have   thanked God each day and night of our lives&#8212;Nada and I. And each   evening she has prayed for you, kneeling at my side, and through   every hour of the day I know she was praying for you in her heart   &#8212;and I believe in the answer to prayer such as that, Roger. Her   faith, now, is as deep as the sea. And you, too, must have faith.&quot; 
  &quot;She is more precious to me than life&#8212;a thousand lives, if I had   them,&quot; whispered Jolly Roger. &quot;If anything should happen&#8212;now&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, if the thing you fear should happen, what then?&quot; cried   Father John, faith ringing like a note of inspiration in his low   voice. &quot;What, then, Roger? You did not kill Jed Hawkins. If the  law  compels you to pay a price for the errors it believes you have   committed, will that price be so terribly severe?&quot; 
  &quot;Prison, Father. Probably five years.&quot; 
  Father John laughed softly, the star-glow revealing a radiance in   his face. 
  &quot;Five years!&quot; he repeated. &quot;Oh, my boy, my dear boy, what are five   years to pay for such a treasure as that which has come into your   possession tonight? Five short years&#8212;only five. And she waiting  for  you, proud of you for those very achievements which sent you  to  prison, planning for all the future that lies beyond those five  short  years, growing sweeter and more beautiful for you as she  waits&#8212;Roger,  is that a very great sacrifice? Is it too great a  price to pay? Five  years, and after that&#8212;peace, love, happiness  for all time? Is it,  Roger?&quot; 
  McKay felt his voice tremble as he tried to answer. 
  &quot;But she, father&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, yes, I know what you would say,&quot; interrupted Father John   gently. &quot;I argued with her, just as you would have argued, Roger.  I  appealed to her reason. I told her that if you returned it would  mean  prison for you, and strangely I said that same thing&#8212;five  years. But  I found her selfish, Roger, very selfish&#8212;and set upon  her desire  beyond all reason. And it was she who asked first those  very questions  I have asked you tonight. 'What are five years?'  she demanded of me,  defying my logic. 'What are five years&#8212;or  ten&#8212;or twenty, IF I KNOW I  AM TO HAVE HIM AFTER THAT?' Yes, she  was selfish, Roger. Just that  great is her love for you.&quot; 
  &quot;Dear God in Heaven,&quot; breathed Jolly Roger, and stopped, his eyes   staring wide at the stars. 
  &quot;And after that, after I had given in to her selfishness, Roger,   she planned how we&#8212;she and I&#8212;would live very near to the place   where they imprisoned you, and how each day some sight or sign  should  pass between you, and the baby&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;The baby, Father?&quot; 
  &quot;Thus it seems she dreams, Roger. She, in the wilfulness of her   desire and selfishness&#8212;&quot; 
  With a choking cry Roger bowed his face in his hands. 
  For a moment Father John was silent. And then he said, so very low   that it was almost a whisper, 
  &quot;I have passed many years in the wilderness, Roger, many years   trying to look into the hearts of people&#8212;and of God. And this&#8212;  this  love of Nada's&#8212;is the greatest of all the miracles I have  witnessed  in a life that is now reaching to its three score and  five. Do you see  the wonder of it, son? And does it make you  happy, and fearless now?&quot; 
  He did not wait for an answer, but turned slowly and went in the   direction of the cabin, leaving Roger alone under the thickening   stars. And McKay's face was like Father John's, filled with a  strange  and wonderful radiance when he looked up. But with that  light of  happiness was also the fiercer underglow of a great  determination. For  Nada&#8212;for THE BABY&#8212;the worst should not  happen; he breathed the  thought aloud, and in the words was a  prayer that God might help him,  and make unnecessary the sacrifice  from which Father John had taken  the sting of fear. And yet, if  that sacrifice came, he saw clearly now  that it would not be a  great tragedy but only a brief shadow cast over  the undying  happiness in his soul. For they&#8212;NADA AND THE BABY&#8212;would  be  waiting&#8212;waiting&#8212; 
  Suddenly he was conscious of a sound very near, and he beheld   Nada, taller and slimmer and more beautiful than ever, it seemed  to  him, in the starlight. 
  &quot;I have told him,&quot; Father John had whispered to her only a moment   before. &quot;I have told him, so that he will not fear prison&#8212;either  for  himself or for you.&quot; 
  And she had come to him quietly, all of the pretty triumph and   playfulness gone, so that she stood like an angel in the soft glow  of  the skies, much older than he had ever seen her before, and  smiled at  him with a new and wonderful tenderness as she held out  her hands to  him. 
  Not until she lay in his arms, looking up at him from under her   long lashes, did he dare to speak. And then, 
  &quot;Is it true&#8212;what Father John has told me?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;It is true,&quot; she whispered, and the silken lashes covered her   eyes. 
  Her hand crept up to his face in the silence that followed, and   rested there; and with no desire to hear more than the three words   she had spoken he crushed his lips in the sweet coils of her hair,   and together, in that peace ands understanding, they listened to  the  gentle whisperings of the night. 
  &quot;Roger,&quot; she whispered at last. 
  &quot;Yes, my NEWA&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What does that mean, Roger?&quot; 
  &quot;It means&#8212;beloved&#8212;wife&quot; 
  &quot;Then I like it. But I shall like the others&#8212;one of the others&#8212;   best.&quot; 
  &quot;My&#8212;WIFE.&quot; 
  &quot;That&#8212;that makes me happiest, Roger. Your WIFE. Oh, it is the   sweetest word in the world, that&#8212;and&#8212;&quot; 
  He felt her warm face hide itself softly against his neck. 
  &quot;Mother,&quot; he added. 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;Mother,&quot; she repeated after him in an awed little voice.   &quot;Oh, I have dreamed of Mothers since I have been old enough to  dream,  Roger! My Mother&#8212;I never had one that I can remember,  except in a  dream. It must be wonderful to&#8212;to&#8212;have a Mother,  Roger.&quot; 
  &quot;And yet, I think, not quite so wonderful as to BE a Mother, my   Nada.&quot; 
  &quot;Listen!&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;It is the Leaf Bud singing.&quot; 
  &quot;A love song?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, in Cree.&quot; 
  She raised her head, so that her eyes were wide open, and looking   at him. 
  &quot;Since we came up here all this wonderful world has been promising   song for me, Roger. And since you came back to me it has been   singing&#8212;singing&#8212;singing&#8212;every hour of night and day. Have you  ever  dreamed of leaving it, Roger&#8212;of going down into that world  of towns  and cities of which Father John has told me so much?&quot; 
  &quot;Would you like to go there, Nada?&quot; 
  &quot;Only to look upon it, and come away. I want to live in the   forests, where I found you. Always and always, Roger.&quot; 
  She raised herself on tip-toe, and kissed him. 
  &quot;I want to live near Yellow Bird and Sun Cloud&#8212;please&#8212;Mister   Jolly Roger&#8212;I do. And Father John will go with us. And we'll be  so  happy there all together, Yellow Bird and Sun Cloud and Giselle  and  I&#8212;oh!&quot; 
  His arms had tightened so suddenly that the little cry came from   her. 
  &quot;And yet&#8212;I may have to leave you for a little time, Nada. But it   will not be for long. What are five years, when all life reaches  out  a paradise before us? They are nothing&#8212;nothing&#8212;and will pass   swiftly&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, they will pass swiftly,&quot; she said, so gently that scarce did   he hear. 
  But on his breast she gave a little sob which would not choke   itself back, a sob which bravely she smiled through a moment  later,  and which he&#8212;knowing that it was best&#8212;made as if he had  not heard. 
  And so, this night, while Father John and Peter waited and watched   in the cabin, did they plan their future in the company of the  stars.
