  The intimacy between Harry and Oscar Vincent continued, and, as  during the former term, the latter volunteered to continue giving  French lessons to our hero. These were now partly of a conversational  character, and, as Harry was thoroughly in earnest, it was not long  before he was able to speak quite creditably.
  About the first of November, Fitzgerald Fletcher left the Prescott  Academy, and returned to his home in Boston. It was not because he had  finished his education, but because he felt that he was not appreciated  by his fellow-students. He had been ambitious to be elected to an  official position in the Clionian Society, but his aspirations were not  gratified. He might have accepted this disappointment, and borne it as  well as he could, had it not been aggravated by the elevation of Harry  Walton to the presidency. To be only a common member, while a boy so  far his social inferior was President, was more than Fitzgerald could  stand. He was so incensed that upon the announcement of the vote he  immediately rose to a point of order.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; he said warmly, &#8220;I must protest against this  election. Walton is not a member of the Prescott Academy, and it is  unconstitutional to elect him President.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will the gentleman point out the constitutional clause which has  been violated by Walton's election?&#8221; said Oscar Vincent.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Fletcher, &#8220;this Society was founded by  students of the Prescott Academy; and the offices should be confined to  the members of the school.&#8221;
  Harry Walton rose and said: &#8220;Mr. President, my election has been a  great surprise to myself. I had no idea that any one had thought of me  for the position. I feel highly complimented by your kindness, and  deeply grateful for it; but there is something in what Mr. Fletcher  says. You have kindly allowed me to share in the benefits of the  Society, and that satisfies me. I think it will be well for you to make  another choice as President.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will put it to vote,&#8221; said the presiding officer. &#8220;Those who are  ready to accept Mr. Walton's resignation will signify it in the usual  way.&#8221;
  Fletcher raised his hand, but he was alone.
  &#8220;Those who are opposed,&#8221; said the President.
  Every other hand except Harry's was now raised.
  &#8220;Mr. Walton, your resignation is not accepted,&#8221; said the presiding  officer. &#8220;I call upon you to assume the duties of your new position.&#8221;
  Harry rose, and, modestly advanced to the chair. &#8220;I have already  thanked you, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the honor you have conferred  upon me in selecting me as your presiding officer. I have only to add  that I will discharge its duties to the best of my ability.&#8221;
  All applauded except Fletcher. He sat with an unpleasant scowl upon  his face, and waited for the result of the balloting for Vice-President  and Secretary. Had he been elected to either position, the Clionian  would probably have retained his illustrious name upon its roll. But as  these honors were conferred upon other members, he formed the heroic  resolution no longer to remain a member.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; he said, when the last vote was announced, &#8220;I  desire to terminate my connection with this Society.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope Mr. Fletcher will reconsider his determination,&#8221; said Harry  from the chair.
  &#8220;I would like to inquire the gentleman's reasons,&#8221; said Tom Carver.
  &#8220;I don't like the way in which the Society is managed,&#8221; said  Fletcher. &#8220;I predict that it will soon disband.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see any signs of it,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;If the gentleman is  really sincere, he should not desert the Clionian in the hour of  danger.&#8221;
  &#8220;I insist upon my resignation,&#8221; said Fletcher.
  &#8220;I move that it be accepted,&#8221; said Tom Carver.
  &#8220;Second the motion,&#8221; said the boy who sat next him.
  The resignation was unanimously accepted. Fletcher ought to have  felt gratified at the prompt granting of his request, but he was not.  He had intended to strike dismay into the Society by his proposal to  withdraw, but there was no consternation visible. Apparently they were  willing to let him go.
  He rose from his seat mortified and wrathful.
  &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have complied with my request, and I am  deeply grateful. I no longer consider it an honor to belong to the  Clionian. I trust your new President may succeed as well in his new  office as he has in the capacity of a printer's devil.&#8221;
  Fletcher was unable to proceed, being interrupted by a storm of  hisses, in the midst of which he hurriedly made his exit.
  &#8220;He wanted to be President himself&#8212;that's what's the matter,&#8221; said  Tom Carver in a whisper to his neighbor. &#8220;But he couldn't blame us for  not wanting to have him.&#8221;
  Other members of the Society came to the same conclusion, and it was  generally said that Fletcher had done himself no good by his  undignified resentment. His parting taunt levelled at Harry was  regarded as mean and ungenerous, and only strengthened the sentiment in  favor of our hero who bore his honors modestly. In fact Tom Carver, who  was fond of fun, conceived a project for mortifying Fletcher, and  readily obtained the co-operation of his classmates.
  It must be premised that Fitz was vain of his reading and  declamation. He had a secret suspicion that, if he should choose to  devote his talents to the stage, he would make a second Booth. This  self-conceit of his made it the more easy to play off the following  joke upon him.
  A fortnight later, the young ladies of the village proposed to hold  a Fair to raise funds for some public object. At the head of the  committee of arrangements was a sister of the doctor's wife, named  Pauline Clinton. This will explain the following letter which, Fletcher  received the succeeding day:&#8212;
  &#8220;FITZGERALD FLETCHER, ESQ.&#8212;Dear Sir: Understanding that you are a  superior reader, we should be glad of your assistance in lending<I>  eclat</I> to the Fair which we propose to hold on the evening of the  29th. Will you be kind enough to occupy twenty minutes by reading such  selections as in your opinion will be of popular interest? It is  desirable that you should let me know as soon as possible what pieces  you have selected, that they may be printed on the programme.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yours respectfully, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;PAULINE CLINTON, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;(for the Committee).&#8221;
  This note reached Fletcher at a time when he was still smarting from  his disappointment in obtaining promotion from the Clionian Society. He  read it with a flushed and triumphant face. He never thought of  questioning its genuineness. Was it not true that he was a superior  reader? What more natural than that he should be invited to give<I>  eclat</I> to the Fair by the exercise of his talents! He felt it to be  a deserved compliment. It was a greater honor to be solicited to give a  public reading than to be elected President of the Clionian Society.
  &#8220;They won't laugh at me now,&#8221; thought Fletcher.
  He immediately started for Oscar's room to make known his new  honors.
  &#8220;How are you, Fitz?&#8221; said Oscar, who was in the secret, and guessed  the errand on which he came.
  &#8220;Very well, thank you, Oscar,&#8221; answered Fletcher, in a stately  manner.
  &#8220;Anything new with you?&#8221; asked Oscar, carelessly.
  &#8220;Not much,&#8221; said Fletcher. &#8220;There's a note I just received.
  &#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Oscar, in affected astonishment. &#8220;Are you going to  accept?&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose I ought to oblige them,&#8221; said Fletcher. &#8220;It won't be much  trouble to me, you know.&#8221;
  &#8220;To be sure; it's in a good cause. But how did they hear of your  reading?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, there are no secrets in a small village like this,&#8221; said  Fletcher.
  &#8220;It's certainly a great compliment. Has anybody else been invited to  read?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Fletcher, proudly. &#8220;They rely upon me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Couldn't you get a chance for me? It would be quite an honor, and I  should like it for the sake of the family.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shouldn't feel at liberty to interfere with their arrangements,&#8221;  said Fletcher, who didn't wish to share the glory with any one.  &#8220;Besides, you don't read well enough.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, I suppose I must give it up,&#8221; said Oscar, in a tone of  resignation. &#8220;By the way, what have you decided to read?&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't quite made up my mind,&#8221; said Fletcher, in a tone of  importance. &#8220;I have only just received the invitation, you know.&#8221;
  &#8220;Haven't you answered it yet?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; but I shall as soon as I go home. Good-night, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good-night, Fitz.&#8221;
  &#8220;How mad Fitz will be when he finds he has been sold!&#8221; said Oscar to  himself. &#8220;But he deserves it for treating Harry so meanly.&#8221;
