  If my young readers do not find the town of Waverley on the map of  Ohio,  they may conclude that it was too small to attract the notice of  the  map-makers. The village is small, consisting of about a dozen  houses, a  church, a schoolhouse, and, as a matter of course, one of  that well-  known class of stores in which everything required for the  family is  sold, from a dress-pattern to a pound of sugar. Outside of  the village  there are farmhouses, surrounded by broad acres, which  keep them at  respectable distances from each other, like the feudal  castles of the  Middle Ages. The land is good, and the farmers are  thrifty and well-to-  do; but probably the whole town contains less  than a thousand  inhabitants. 
  In one of the houses, near the church, lived Dr. Kent, whose letter  has  already been referred to. He was a skillful physician, and a very  worthy  man, who would have been very glad to be benevolent if his  limited  practice had supplied him with the requisite means. But chance  had  directed him to a healthy and sparsely-settled neighborhood, where  he  was able only to earn a respectable livelihood, and indeed found  himself  compelled to economize at times where he would have liked to  indulge  himself in expense. 
  When Mrs. Mason died it was found that the sale of her furniture  barely  realized enough to defray the expenses of her funeral. Herbert,  her only  son, was left wholly unprovided for. Dr. Kent, knowing that  he had a  rich uncle in New York, undertook to communicate to him the  position in  which his nephew had been left, never doubting that he  would cheerfully  extend a helping hand to him. Meanwhile he invited  Herbert to come to  his house and make it his home till his uncle  should send for him. 
  Herbert was a handsome, well-grown boy of fourteen, and a general   favorite in the village. While his mother lived he had done all he  could  to lighten her tasks, and he grieved deeply for her loss now  that she  was gone. His father had ten years before failed in business  in the city  of New York, and, in a fit of depression, had emigrated to  this obscure  country village, where he had invested the few hundred  dollars remaining  to him in a farm, from which he was able to draw a  scanty income. Being  a man of liberal education, he had personally  superintended the  education of his son till his death, two years  before, so that Herbert's  attainments were considerably in advance of  those of other boys of his  age in the neighborhood. He knew something  of Latin and French, which  made him looked upon as quite a model of  learning by his playmates.  After his father's death he had continued  the daily study of the  languages, so that he was able to read ordinary  French with nearly as  much ease as if it were English. Though  studious, he was not a bookworm,  but was distinguished in athletic  sports popular with boys of his age. 
  Enough has been said of our hero by way of introduction. Herbert's   faults and virtues will appear as the record of his adventures is   continued. It may be hinted only that, while he was frank, manly, and   generous in his disposition, he was proud and high-spirited also, and   perhaps these qualities were sometimes carried to excess. He would not   allow himself to be imposed upon if he could help it. Being strong for   his age, he was always able to maintain his rights, but never abused  his  strength by making it the instrument of tyrannizing over weaker  boys. 
  Of course Herbert felt somewhat anxious as to his future prospects.  He  knew that the doctor had written to his Uncle Benjamin about him,  and he  hoped that he might be sent for to New York, having a great  curiosity to  see the city, of which he had heard so much. 
  &quot;Have you heard from my uncle, Dr. Kent?&quot; he inquired, a few days  after  the scene recorded in our first chapter. 
  His question was prompted by seeing the doctor coming into the yard  with  an open letter in his hand. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Dr. Kent, with troubled expression and perplexed took. 
  &quot;What does Uncle Benjamin say?&quot; asked our young hero, eagerly. 
  &quot;Nothing very encouraging, Herbert, I am sorry to say,&quot; returned  the  doctor. &quot;However, here is the letter; you may read it for  yourself.&quot; 
  Herbert received the letter from the doctor's hands and read it  through  with feelings of mortification and anger. 
  Here it is: 
  &quot;DEAR SIR: I have to acknowledge yours of the 10th inst. I regret  to  hear of my sister's decease. I regret, also, to hear that her son,   Herbert, is left without a provision for his support. My  brother-in-law  I cannot but consider culpable in neglecting to lay up  something during  his life upon which his widow and son might depend. I  suspect that he  must have lived with inconsiderate extravagance. 
  &quot;As for myself, I have a family of my own to provide for, and the   expense of living in a city like this is very great. In justice to  them,  I do not feel that it would be right for me to incur extra  expense. You  tell me that he is now fourteen and a stout boy. He is  able, I should  think, to earn his own living. I should recommend that  he be bound out  to a farmer or mechanic. To defray any little expenses  that may arise, I  enclose ten dollars, which I hope he may find  serviceable. Yours etc., 
  &quot;BENJAMIN STANTON.&quot; 
  This cold and selfish letter Herbert read with rising color, and a   feeling of bitterness found a place in his young heart, which was  quite  foreign to him. 
  &quot;Well, Herbert, what do you think of it?&quot; asked the doctor. 
  &quot;I think,&quot; said Herbert, hotly, &quot;that I don't want to have anything  to  do with an uncle who could write such a letter as that.&quot; 
  &quot;He doesn't seem to write with much feeling.&quot; acknowledged the  doctor. 
  &quot;Feeling!&quot; repeated Herbert; &quot;he writes as if I were a beggar, and  asked  charity. Where is the money he inclosed, Dr. Kent?&quot; 
  &quot;I have it here in my vest pocket. I was afraid it would slip out  of the  letter, and so took care of it.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you let me send it back to my uncle?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  &quot;Send it back?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Dr. Kent; I don't want any of his charity, and I'll tell him  so.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid, Herbert, that you are giving way to your pride.&quot; 
  &quot;But isn't it a proper pride, doctor?&quot; 
  &quot;I hardly know what to say, Herbert. You must remember, however,  that,  as you are left quite unprovided for, even this small sum may be  of use  to you.&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't the smallness of the sum that I mind,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;If  Uncle  Benjamin had written a kind letter, or showed the least feeling  in it  for me, or for&#8212;for mother [his voice faltered a moment], I  would have  accepted it thankfully. But I couldn't accept money thrown  at me in that  way. He didn't want to give it to me, I am sure, and  wouldn't if he  hadn't felt obliged to.&quot; 
  Dr. Kent paced the room thoughtfully. He respected Herbert's  feelings,  but he saw that it was not wise for him to indulge them. He  was in a  dependent situation, and it was to be feared that he would  have much to  suffer in time to come from the coldness and selfishness  of the world. 
  &quot;I will tell you what to do, Herbert,&quot; he said, after a while. &quot;You  can  accept this money as a loan, and repay it when you are able.&quot; 
  &quot;With interest?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, with interest, if you prefer it.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be willing to accept it on those terms,&quot; said Herbert;  &quot;but I  want my uncle to understand it.&quot; 
  &quot;You may write to your uncle to that effect, if you like.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well, Dr. Kent. Then I will write to him at once.&quot; 
  &quot;You will find some paper in my desk, Herbert. I suppose you will  not  object to my seeing your letter.&quot; 
  &quot;No, doctor, I intended to show it to you. You won't expect me to  show  much gratitude, I hope?&quot; 
  &quot;I won't insist upon it, Herbert,&quot; said the doctor, smiling. 
  Herbert in about half an hour submitted the following note to the   doctor's inspection. It had cost him considerable thought to determine   how to express himself, but he succeeded at last to his tolerable   satisfaction. 
  &quot;UNCLE BENJAMIN [so the letter commenced]: Dr. Kent has just shown  me  your reply to his letter about me. You seem to think I wish you to   support me, which is not the case. All I should have asked was your   influence to help me in obtaining a situation in the city, where I  might  support myself. I am willing to work, and shall probably find  some  opportunity here. The ten dollars, which you inclose, I will  accept AS A  LOAN, and will repay you as soon as I am able, WITH  INTEREST. HERBERT  MASON.&quot; 
  &quot;Will that do?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  Dr. Kent smiled. 
  &quot;You were careful not to express any gratitude, Herbert,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Because I don't feel any,&quot; returned Herbert, promptly. &quot;I feel  grateful  to you, Dr. Kent, for your great kindness. I wish I could pay  you for  that. I shall never forget how you attended my mother in her  sickness,  when there was small prospect of your being paid.&quot; 
  &quot;My dear boy,&quot; said the doctor, resting his hand affectionately on   Herbert's shoulder, &quot;I have been able to do but very little. I wish I   could do more. If you wish to repay me, you can do it a hundred times   over by growing up a good and honorable man; one upon whom your mother   in heaven can look down with grateful joy, if it is permitted her to   watch your progress here.&quot; 
  &quot;I will do my best, doctor,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;The world is all before you,&quot; proceeded Dr. Kent. &quot;You may not  achieve  a brilliant destiny. It is permitted to few to do that. But  whether your  sphere is wide or narrow, you may exert an influence for  good, AND LEAVE  THE WORLD BETTER FOR YOUR HAVING LIVED IN IT.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope it may be so,&quot; said Herbert, thoughtfully. &quot;When I am  tempted to  do wrong, I will think of my mother.&quot; 
  &quot;It is the very best thing you can do, Herbert. And now for your  plans.  I wish I were in a situation to have you remain with me. But as  that  cannot be, I will do my best to get you a place.&quot; 
  &quot;I ought to be at work,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;as I have my living to get.  I  want you to take that ten dollars, doctor, as part payment of the  debt I  owe you.&quot; 
  The doctor shook his head. 
  &quot;I can't do that, Herbert, not even to oblige you. You were too  proud to  accept a favor from your uncle. You will not be too proud, I  hope, to  accept one from me?&quot; 
  &quot;No, doctor; I am not too proud for that. You are my friend, and my   uncle cares nothing for me.&quot; 
  When Herbert's letter reached New York, his uncle felt a momentary   shame, for he saw that his nephew had rightfully interpreted his own   selfishness and lack of feeling, and he could not help involuntarily   admiring the independent spirit which would not allow him to accept  the  proffered money, except as a loan. But mingled with his shame was  a  feeling of relief, as he foresaw that Herbert's pride would not  suffer  him to become a burden upon him in the future. He hardly  expected ever  to see the ten dollars returned with interest; but even  if he lost it,  he felt that he should be getting off cheap.
