  For many minutes after the last gentle breath had passed from the   woman's lips, Jan Thoreau played softly upon his violin. It was the   great, heart-broken sob of John Cummins that stopped him. As tenderly   as if she had fallen into a sweet sleep from which he feared to awaken   her, the man unclasped his arms and lowered his wife's head to the   pillow; and with staring black eyes Jan crushed his violin against his   ragged breast and watched him as he smoothed back the shimmering hair   and looked long and hungrily into the still, white face. 
  Cummins turned to him, and, in the dim light of the cabin, their  eyes  met. It was then that Jan Thoreau knew what had happened. He  forgot  his starvation. He crushed his violin closer, and whispered to   himself: 
  &quot;The white angel ees&#8212;gone!&quot; 
  Cummins rose from the bedside, slowly, like a man who had suddenly   grown old. His moccasined feet dragged as he went to the door. They   stumbled when he went out into the pale star-glow of the night. 
  Jan followed, swaying weakly, for the last of his strength had gone  in  the playing of the violin. Midway in the cabin he paused, and his  eyes  glowed with a wild, strange grief as he gazed down upon the still  face  of Cummins' wife, beautiful in death as it had been in life, and  with  the sweet softness of life still lingering there. Some time, ages  and  ages ago, he had known such a face, and had felt the great  clutching  love of it. 
  Something drew him to where John Cummins had knelt, and he fell  upon  his knees and gazed hungrily and longingly where John Cummins had   gazed. His pulse was beating feebly, the weakness of seven days'   starvation blurred his eyes, and unconsciously he sank over the bed   and one of his thin hands touched the soft sweep of the woman's hair.   A stifled cry fell from him as he jerked himself rigidly erect; and as   if for the desecration of that touch there was but one way of   forgiveness, he drew his violin half to his shoulder, and for a few   moments played so softly that none but the spirit of the woman and   himself could hear. 
  Cummins had partly closed the door after him; but watchers had seen   the opening of it. A door opened here, and another there, and paths of   yellow light flashed over the hard-trodden snow as shadowy life came   forth to greet what message he brought from the little cabin. 
  Beyond those flashes of light there was no other movement, and no   sound. Dark figures stood motionless. The lonely howl of a sledge-dog   ended in a wail of pain as some one kicked it into terrified silence.   The hollow cough of Mukee's father was smothered in the thick fur of   his cap as he thrust his head from his little shack in the edge of the   forest. A score of eyes watched Cummins as he came out into the snow,   and the rough, loyal hearts of those who looked throbbed in fearful   anticipation of the word he might be bringing to them. 
  Sometimes a nation ceases to breathe in the last moments of its  dying  chief, and the black wings of calamity gather over its people,   enshrouding them in a strange gloom and a stranger fear; and so,   because the greatest of all tragedies had come into their little   world, Cummins' people were speechless in their grief and their   waiting for the final word. And when the word came to them at last,   and passed from lip to lip, and from one grim, tense face to another,   the doors closed again, and the lights went out one by one, until   there remained only the yellow eye of the factor's office and the   faint glow from the little cabin in which John Cummins knelt with his   sobbing face crushed close to that of his dead. 
  There was no one who noticed Jan Thoreau when he came through the  door  of the factor's office. His coat of caribou-skin was in tatters.  His  feet thrust themselves from the toes of his moccasins. His face  was so  thin and white that it shone with the pallor of death from its  frame  of straight dark hair. His eyes gleamed like black diamonds. The   madness of hunger was in him. 
  An hour before, death had been gripping at his throat, when he   stumbled upon the lights of the post, That night he would have died in   the deep snows. Wrapped in its thick coat of bearskin he clutched his   violin to his breast, and sank down in a ragged heap beside the hot   stove. His eyes traveled about him in fierce demand. There is no   beggary among these strong-souled men of the far North, and Jan's lips   did not beg. He unwrapped the bearskin, and whispered: 
  &quot;For the museek of the violon&#8212;somet'ing to eat!&quot; 
  He played, even as the words fell from him, but only for a  moment&#8212;for  the bow slipped from his nerveless grip and his head sank  forward upon  his breast. 
  In the half-Cree's eyes there was something of the wild beauty that   gleamed in Jan's. For an instant those eyes had met in the savage   recognition of blood; and when Jan's head fell weakly, and his violin   slipped to the floor, Mukee lifted him in his strong arms and carried   him to the shack in the edge of the spruce and balsam. 
  And there was no one who noticed Jan the next day&#8212;except Mukee. He   was fed. His frozen blood grew warm. As life returned, he felt more   and more the pall of gloom that had settled over this spark of life in   the heart of the wilderness. He had seen the woman, in life and in   death, and he, too, loved her and grieved that she was no more. He   said nothing; he asked nothing; but he saw the spirit of adoration in   the sad, tense faces of the men. He saw it in the terror-stricken eyes   of the wild little children who had grown to worship Cummins' wife. He   read it in the slinking stillness of the dogs, in the terrible,   pulseless quiet that had settled about him. 
  It was not hard for Jan to understand, for he, too, worshiped the   memory of a white, sweet face like the one that he had seen in the   cabin. He knew that this worship at Lac Bain was a pure worship, for   the honor of the big snows was a part of his soul. It was his   religion, and the religion of these others who lived four hundred   miles or more from a southern settlement. 
  It meant what civilization could not understand&#8212;freezing and slow   starvation rather than theft, and respect for the tenth commandment   above all other things. It meant that up here, under the cold chill of   the northern skies, things were as God meant them to be, and that a   few of His creatures could live in a love that was neither possession   nor sin. 
  A year after Cummins brought his wife into the North, a man came to   the post from Fort Churchill, on Hudson's Bay. He was an Englishman,   belonging to the home office of the Hudson's Bay Company in London. He   brought with him something new, as the woman had brought something   new; only in this instance it was an element of life which Cummins'   people could not understand. 
  It breathed of tragedy from the first, to the men of the post. To  the  Englishman, on the other hand, it promised to be but an  incident&#8212;a  passing adventure in pleasure. Here again was that  difference of  viewpoint&#8212;the eternity of difference between the middle  and the end  of the earth. 
  Cummins was away for a month on a trap-line that went into the  Barren  Lands. At these times the woman fell as a heritage to those who   remained, and they watched over her as a parent might guard its child.   Yet the keenest eyes would not have perceived that this was so. 
  With Cummins gone, the tragedy progressed swiftly toward finality.  The  Englishman came from among women. For months he had been in a  torment  of desolation. Cummins' wife was to him like a flower suddenly  come to  relieve the tantalizing barrenness of a desert; and with the  wiles and  ways of civilization he sought to breathe its fragrance. 
  In the days and weeks that followed, he talked a great deal, when   heated by the warmth of the box stove and by his own thoughts; and   this was because he had not yet measured the hearts of Cummins'   people. And because the woman knew nothing of what was said about the   box stove, she continued in the even course of her pure life, neither   resisting nor encouraging the new-comer, yet ever tempting him with   that sweetness which she gave to all alike. 
  As yet there was no suspicion in her soul. She accepted the   Englishman's friendship, for he was a stranger among her people. She   did not hear the false note, she saw no step that promised evil. Only   the men at the post heard, and saw, and understood. 
  Like so many faithful beasts, they were ready to spring, to rend   flesh, to tear life out of him who threatened the desecration of all   that was good and pure and beautiful to them; and yet, dumb in their   devotion and faith, they waited and watched for a sign from the woman.   The blue eyes of Cummins' wife, the words of her gentle lips, the   touch of her hands, had made law at the post. If she smiled upon the   stranger and talked with him, and was pleased with him, that was only   one other law that she had made for them to respect. So they were   quiet, evaded the Englishman as much as possible, and watched&#8212;always   watched. 
  One day something happened. Cummins' wife came into the company's   store; and a quick flush shot into her cheeks, and the glitter of blue   diamonds into her eyes, when she saw the stranger standing there. The   man's red face grew redder, and he shifted his gaze. When Cummins'   wife passed him, she drew her skirt close to her; and there was the   poise of a queen in her head, the glory of wife and womanhood, the   living, breathing essence of all that was beautiful in her people's   honor of the big snows. 
  That night Mukee, the half-Cree, slunk around in the edge of the   forest to see that all was well in Cummins' little home. Once Mukee   had suffered a lynx-bite that went clear to the bone, and the woman   had saved his hand. After that, the savage in him was enslaved to her   like an invisible spirit. 
  He crouched for a few minutes in the snow, looking at the pale  filter  of light that came through a hole in the curtain of the woman's   window; and as he looked something came between him and the light.   Against the cabin he saw the shadow of a sneaking human form; and as   silently as the steely flash of the aurora over his head, as swiftly   as a lean deer, he sped through the gloom of the forest's edge and   came up behind the woman's home. 
  With the caution of a lynx, his head close to the snow, he peered   around the logs. It was the Englishman who stood looking through the   tear in that curtained window. 
  Mukee's moccasined feet made no sound. His hand fell as gently as a   child's upon the stranger's arm. 
  &quot;Thees is not the honor of the beeg snows,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Come!&quot; 
  A sickly pallor filled the other man's face; but Mukee's voice was   soft and dispassionate, his touch was velvety in its hint, and he went   with the guiding hand away from the curtained window, smiling in a   companionable way. Mukee's teeth gleamed back. The Englishman   chuckled. 
  Then Mukee's hands changed. They flew to the thick, reddening  throat  of the man from civilization, and without a sound the two sank   together upon the snow. 
  The next day a messenger behind six dogs set out for Fort  Churchill,  with word for the company's home office that the Englishman  had died  in the big snow&#8212;which was true. 
  Mukee told this to Jan, for there was the bond of blood between  them.  It was a painting of life, and love, and purity. Deep down in  the  loneliness of his heart, Jan Thoreau, in his own simple way,  thanked  the great God that it had been given to him to play his violin  as the  woman died.
