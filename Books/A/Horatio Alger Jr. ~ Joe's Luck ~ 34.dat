  It may surprise some of my young friends to learn that the grizzly  bear is to be found in California. Though as the State has increased in  population mostly all have been killed off, even now among the  mountains they may be found, and occasionally visit the lower slopes  and attack men and beasts.
  Hogan had had the ill-luck to encounter one of these animals.
  When he first saw the grizzly there was a considerable space between  them. If he had concealed himself, he might have escaped the notice of  the beast, but when he commenced running the grizzly became aware of  his presence and started in pursuit.
  Hogan was rather dilapidated in appearance. Trusting to luck instead  of labor, he had had a hard time, as he might have expected. His  flannel shirt was ragged and his nether garments showed the ravages of  time. In the race his hat had dropped off and his rough, unkempt hair  was erect with fright. He was running rapidly, but was already showing  signs of exhaustion. The bear was getting over the ground with clumsy  speed, appearing to take it easily, but overhauling his intended victim  slowly, but surely.
  Joe and Bickford were standing on one side, and had not yet  attracted the attention of either party in this unequal race.
  &#8220;Poor chap!&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;He looks most tuckered out. Shall I  shoot?&#8221;
  &#8220;Wait till the bear gets a little nearer. We can't afford to miss.  He will turn on us.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm in a hurry to roll the beast over,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;It's a cruel  sight to see a grizzly hunting a man.&#8221;
  At this moment Hogan turned his head with the terror-stricken look  of a man who felt that he was lost.
  The bear was little more than a hundred feet behind him and was  gaining steadily. He was already terribly fatigued&#8212;his breathing was  reduced to a hoarse pant. He was overcome by the terror of the  situation, and his remaining strength gave way. With a shrill cry he  sank down upon the ground, and, shutting his eyes, awaited the attack.
  The bear increased his speed.
  &#8220;Now let him have it!&#8221; said Joe in a sharp, quick whisper.
  Mr. Bickford fired, striking the grizzly in the face.
  Bruin stood still and roared angrily. He wagged his large head from  one side to the other, seeking by whom this attack was made.
  He espied the two friends, and, abandoning his pursuit of Hogan,  rolled angrily toward them.
  &#8220;Give it to him quick, Joe!&#8221; exclaimed Bickford. &#8220;He's making for  us.&#8221;
  Joe held his rifle with steady hand and took deliberate aim. It was  well he did, for had he failed both he and Bickford would have been in  great peril.
  His faithful rifle did good service.
  The bear tumbled to the earth with sudden awkwardness. The bullet  had reached a vital part and the grizzly was destined to do no more  mischief.
  &#8220;Is he dead, or only feigning?&#8221; asked Joe prudently.
  &#8220;He's a gone coon,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;Let us go up and look at him.&#8221;
  They went up and stood over the huge beast. He was not quite dead.  He opened his glazing eyes, made a convulsive movement with his paws as  if he would like to attack his foes, and then his head fell back and he  moved no more.
  &#8220;He's gone, sure enough,&#8221; said Bickford. &#8220;Good-by, old grizzly. You  meant well, but circumstances interfered with your good intentions.&#8221;
  &#8220;Now let us look up Hogan,&#8221; said Joe.
  The man had sunk to the ground utterly exhausted, and in his  weakness and terror had fainted.
  Joe got some water and threw it in his face.
  He opened his eyes and drew a deep breath. A sudden recollection  blanched his face anew, and he cried:
  &#8220;Don't let him get at me!&#8221;
  &#8220;You're safe, Mr. Hogan,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;The bear is dead.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dead! Is he really dead?&#8221;
  &#8220;If you don't believe it, get up and look at him,&#8221; said Bickford.
  &#8220;I can't get up&#8212;I'm so weak.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let me help you, then. There&#8212;do you see the critter?&#8221;
  Hogan shuddered as he caught sight of the huge beast only  twenty-five feet distant from him.
  &#8220;Was he as near as that?&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;He almost had you,&#8221; said Bickford. &#8220;If it hadn't been for Joe and  me, he'd have been munchin' you at this identical minute. Things have  changed a little, and in place of the bear eatin' you you shall help  eat the bear.&#8221;
  By this time Hogan, realizing that he was safe, began to recover his  strength. As he did so he became angry with the beast that had driven  him such a hard race for life. He ran up to the grizzly and kicked him.
  &#8220;Take that!&#8221; he exclaimed with an oath. &#8220;I wish you wasn't dead, so  that I could stick my knife into you.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he wasn't dead you'd keep your distance,&#8221; said Joshua dryly. &#8220;It  don't require much courage to tackle him now.&#8221;
  Hogan felt this to be a reflection upon his courage.
  &#8220;I guess you'd have run, too, if he'd been after you,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I guess I should. Bears are all very well in their place, but I'd  rather not mingle with 'em socially. They're very affectionate and fond  of hugging, but if I'm going to be hugged I wouldn't choose a bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;You seem to think I was a coward for runnin' from the bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I don't. How do I know you was runnin' from the bear? Maybe you  was only takin' a little exercise to get up an appetite for dinner.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am faint and weak,&#8221; said Hogan. &#8220;I haven't had anything to eat  for twelve hours.&#8221;
  &#8220;You shall have some food,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Joshua, where are the  provisions? We may as well sit down and lunch.&#8221;
  &#8220;Jest as you say, Joe. I most generally have an appetite.&#8221;
  There was a mountain spring within a stone's throw. Joshua took a  tin pail and brought some of the sparkling beverage, which he offered  first to Hogan.
  Hogan drank greedily. His throat was parched and dry, and he needed  it.
  He drew a deep breath of relief.
  &#8220;I feel better,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I was in search of a spring when that  cursed beast spied me and gave me chase.&#8221;
  They sat down under the shade of a large tree and lunched.
  &#8220;What sort of luck have you had since you tried to break into my  restaurant, Mr. Hogan?&#8221; asked Joe.
  Hogan changed color. The question was an awkward one.
  &#8220;Who told you I tried to enter your restaurant?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;The man you brought there.&#8221;
  &#8220;That wasn't creditable of you, Hogan,&#8221; said Joshua, with his mouth  full. &#8220;After my friend Joe had given you a supper and promised you  breakfast, it was unkind to try to rob him. Don't you think so  yourself?&#8221;
  &#8220;I couldn't help it,&#8221; said Hogan, who had rapidly decided on his  defense.
  &#8220;Couldn't help it?&#8221; said Joe in a tone of inquiry. &#8220;That's rather a  strange statement.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's true,&#8221; said Hogan. &#8220;The man forced me to do it.&#8221;
  &#8220;How was that?&#8221;
  &#8220;He saw me comin' out of the restaurant a little while before, and  when he met me, after trying to rob me and finding that it didn't pay,  he asked me if I was a friend of yours. I told him I was. Then he began  to ask if you slept there at night and if anybody was with you. I  didn't want to answer, but he held a pistol at my head and forced me  to. Then he made me go with him. I offered to get in, thinking I could  whisper in your ear and warn you, but he wouldn't let me. He stationed  me at the window and got in himself. You know what followed. As soon as  I saw you were too strong for him I ran away, fearing that he might try  to implicate me in the attempt at robbery.&#8221;
  Hogan recited this story very glibly and in a very plausible manner.
  &#8220;Mr. Hogan,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;if I didn't know you so thoroughly, I might  be disposed to put confidence in your statements. As it is, I regret to  say I don't believe you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Hogan,&#8221; said Joshua, &#8220;I think you're one of the fust romancers of  the age. If I ever start a story-paper I'll engage you to write for  me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am sorry you do me so much injustice, gentlemen,&#8221; said Hogan,  with an air of suffering innocence. &#8220;I'm the victim of circumstances.&#8221;
  &#8220;I expect you're a second George Washington. You never told a lie,  did you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Some time you will know me better,&#8221; said Hogan.
  &#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I know you better now than I want to.&#8221;
