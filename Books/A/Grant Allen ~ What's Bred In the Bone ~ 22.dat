At the Gildersleeves', too, the house that day was alive with  excitement.    
Gwendoline had thrown herself into a fever of alarm as soon as she  had posted her letter to Granville Kelmscott. She went up to her  own room, flung herself wildly on the hed, and sobbed herself into  a half-hysterical, half-delirious state, long before dinner-time.  She hardly knew herself at first how really ill she was. Her hands  were hot and her forehead burning. But she disregarded such mere  physical and medical details as those, by the side of a heart too  full for utterance. She thought only of Granville, and of that  horrid man who had threatened with such evident spite and rancour  to ruin him.    
She lay there some hours alone, in a high fever, before her mother  came up to her room to fetch her. Mrs. Gildersleeve was a subdued  and soft-voiced woman, utterly crushed, so people said, by the  stronger individuality of that blustering, domineering, headstrong  man, her husband. And to say the truth, the eminent Q.C. had taken  all the will out of her in twenty-three years of obedient slavery.  She was pretty still, to be sure, in a certain faded, jaded,  unassuming way; but her patient face wore a constant expression  of suppressed terror, as if she expected every moment to be the  victim of some terrible and unexplained exposure. And that feature  at least in her idiosyncrasy could hardly be put down to Gilbert  Gildersleeve's account; for hectoring and strong-minded as the  successful Q.C. was known to be, nobody could for a moment accuse  him in any definite way of deliberate unkindness to his wife or  daughter. On the contrary, he was tender and indulgent to them to  the last degree, as he understood those virtues. It was only by  constant assertion of his own individuality, and constant repression  or disregard of theirs, that he had broken his wife's spirit and  was breaking his daughter's. He treated them as considerately as  one treats a pet dog, doing everything for them that care and money  could effect, except to admit for a moment their claim to independent  opinions and actions of their own, or to allow the possibility  of their thinking and feeling on any subject on earth one nail's  breadth otherwise than as he himself did.    
At sight of Gwendoline, Mrs. Gildersleeve came over to the bed with  a scared and startled air, felt her daughter's face tenderly with  her hands for a moment, and then cried in alarm, "Why, Gwennie,  what's this? Your cheeks are burning! Who on earth has been here?  Has that horrid man come down again from London to worry you?"    
Gwendoline looked up and tried to prevaricate. But conscience was  too strong for her; the truth would out for all that. "Yes, mother,"  she cried, after a pause, "and he said, oh, he said--I could never  tell you what dreadful things he said. But he's so wicked, so cruel!  You never knew such a man! He thinks I want to marry Granville  Kelmscott, and so he told me--" She broke off, of a sudden, unable  to proceed, and buried her face in her hands, sobbing long and  bitterly.    
"Well, what did he tell you, dear?" Mrs. Gildersleeve asked, with  that frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper  than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.    
"He told me--oh, he told me--I can't tell you what he told me; but  he threatened to ruin us--he threatened it so dreadfully. It was  a hateful threat. He seemed to have found out something that he  knew would be our ruin. He frightened me to death. I never heard  any one say such things as he did."    
Mrs. Gildersleeve drew back in profound agitation. "Found out  something that would be our ruin!" she cried, with white face all  aghast. "Oh, Gwennie, what do you mean? Didn't he tell you what  it was? Didn't he try to explain to you? He's a wicked, wicked man  --so cruel, so unscrupulous! He gets one's secrets into his hands,  by underhand means, and then uses them to make one do whatever he  chooses. I see how it is. He wants to force us into letting him  marry you--into making you marry him! Oh, Gwennie, this is hard.  Didn't he tell you at all what it was he knew? Didn't he give you  a hint what sort of secret he was driving at?"    
Gwendoline looked up once more, and murmured low through her sobs,  "No, he didn't say what it was. He's too cunning for that. But I  think--I think it was something about Granville. Mother, I never  told you, but you know I love him! I think it was something about  <i>him</i>, though I can't quite make sure. Some secret about somebody not  being properly married, or something of that sort. I didn't quite  understand. You see, he was so discreetly vague and reticent."    
Mrs. Gildersleeve drew back her face all aghast with horror. "Some  secret--about somebody--not being properly married!" she repeated  slowly, with wild terror in her eyes.    
"Yes, mother," Gwendoline gasped out, with an effort once more.  "It was about somebody not being really the proper heir; he made  me promise I wouldn't tell; but I don't know how to keep it. He  was immensely full of it; it was an awful secret; and he said he  would ruin us--ruin us ruthlessly. He said we were in his power,  and he'd crush us under his heel. And, oh, when he said it, you  should have seen his face. It was horrible, horrible. I've seen  nothing else since. It dogs me--it haunts me."    
Mrs. Gildersleeve sat down by the bedside wringing her hands in  silence. "It's too late to-night," she said at last, after a long  deep pause, and in a voice like a woman condemned to death, "too  late to do anything; but to-morrow your father must go up to town  and try to see him. At all costs we must buy him off. He knows  everything--that's clear. He'll ruin us. He'll ruin us!"    
"It's no use papa going up to town, though," Gwendoline answered  half dreamily. "That dreadful man said he was going away for his  holiday to the country at once. He'll be gone to-morrow."    
"Gone? Gone where?" Mrs. Gildersleeve cried, in the same awestruck  voice.    
"To Devonshire," Gwendoline replied, shutting her eyes hard and  still seeing him.    
Mrs. Gildersleeve echoed the phrase in a startled cry. "To  Devonshire, Gwendoline! To Devonshire! Did he say to Devonshire?"    
"Yes," Gwendoline went on slowly, trying to recall his very words.  "To the skirts of Dartmoor, I think he said; to a place in the  wilds by the name of Mambury."    
"Mambury!"    
The terror and horror that frail and faded woman threw into the one  word fairly startled Gwendoline. She opened her eyes and stared  aghast at her mother. And well she might, for the effect was  electrical. Mrs. Gildersleeve was sitting there, transfixed with  awe and some unspeakable alarm; her figure was rigid; her face was  dead white; her mouth was drawn down with a convulsive twitch; she  clasped her bloodless hands on her knees in mute agony. For a moment  she sat there like a statue of flesh. Then, as sense and feeling  came back to her by slow degrees, she could but rock her body up  and down in her chair with a short swaying motion, and mutter over  and over again to herself in that same appalled and terrified voice,  "Mambury--Mambury--Mambury--Mambury."    
"That was the name, I'm sure," Gwendoline went on, almost equally  alarmed. "On a hunt after records, he said; on a hunt after records.  Whatever it was he wanted to prove, I suppose he knew that was the  place to prove it."    
Mrs. Gildersleeve rose, or to speak with more truth, staggered  slowly to her feet, and, steadying herself with an effort, made  blindly for the door, groping her way as she went, like some faint  and wounded creature. She said not a word to Gwendoline. She had  no tongue left for speech or comment. She merely stepped on, pale  and white, pale and white, like one who walks in her sleep, and  clutched the door-handle hard to keep her from falling. Gwendoline,  now thoroughly alarmed, followed her close on her way to the top  of the stairs. There Mrs. Gildersleeve paused, turned round to her  daughter with a mute look of anguish and held up one hand, palm  outward, appealingly, as if on purpose to forbid her from following  farther. At the gesture, Gwendoline fell back, and looked after her  mother with straining eyes. Mrs. Gildersleeve staggered on, erect,  yet to all appearance almost incapable of motion, and stumbled  down the stairs, and across the hall, and into the drawing-room  opposite. The rest Gwendoline neither saw, nor heard, nor guessed  at. She crept back into her own room, and, flinging herself on her  bed alone as she stood, cried still more piteously and miserably  than ever.    
Down in the drawing-room, however, Mrs. Gildersleeve found the  famous Q.C. absorbed in the perusal of that day's paper. She came  across towards him, pale as a ghost, and with ashen lips. "Gilbert,"  she said slowly, blurting it all out in her horror, without one  word of warning, "that dreadful man Nevitt has seen Gwennie again,  and he's told her he knows all, and he means to ruin us, and he's  heard of the marriage, and he's gone down to Mambury to hunt up  the records!"    
The eminent Q.C. let the paper drop from his huge red hands in  the intensity of his surprise, while his jaw fell in unison at so  startling and almost incredible a piece of intelligence. "Nevitt  knows all!" he exclaimed, half incredulous. "He means to ruin  us! And he told this to Gwendoline! Gone down to Mambury! Oh no,  Minnie, impossible! You must have made some mistake. What did she  say exactly? Did she mention Mambury?"    
"She said it exactly as I've said it now to you," Mrs. Gildersleeve  persisted with a stony stare. "He's gone down to Devonshire, she  said; to the borders of Dartmoor, on a hunt after the records; to  a place in the wilds by the name of Mambury. Those were her very  words. I could stake my life on each syllable. I give them to you  precisely as she gave them to me."    
Mr. Gildersleeve gazed across at her with the countenance which had  made so many a nervous witness quake at the Old Bailey. "Are you  <i>quite</i> sure of that, Minnie?" he asked, in his best cross-examining  tone. "Quite sure she said Mambury, all of her own accord? Quite  sure you didn't suggest it to her, or supply the name, or give her  a hint of its whereabouts, or put her a leading question?"    
"Is it likely I'd suggest it to her?" the meekest of women answered,  aroused to retort for once, and with her face like a sheet. "Is it  likely I'd tell her? Is it likely I'd give my own girl the clue? She  said it all of herself, I tell you, without one word of prompting.  She said it just as I repeated it--to a place in the wilds by the  name of Mambury."    
Gilbert Gildersleeve whistled inaudibly to himself. 'Twas his way  when he felt himself utterly nonplussed. This was very strange  news. He didn't really understand it. But he rose and confronted  his wife anxiously. That overbearing big man was evidently stirred  by this untoward event to the very depths of his nature.    
"Then Gwennie knows all!" he cried, the blood rushing purple into  his ruddy flushed cheeks. "The wretch! The brute! He must have told  her everything!"    
"Oh, Gilbert," his wife answered, sinking into a chair in her  horror, "even <i>he</i> couldn't do that--not to my own very daughter!  And he didn't do it, I'm sure. He didn't dare--coward as he is,  he couldn't be quite so cowardly. She doesn't guess what it means.  She thinks it's something, I believe, about Granville Kelmscott.  She's in love with young Kelmscott, as I told you long ago, and  everything to her mind takes some colour from that fancy. I don't  think it ever occurred to her, from what she says, this has anything  at all to do with you or me, Gilbert."    
The Q.C. reflected. He saw at once he was in a tight corner. That  boisterous man, with the burly big hands, looked quite subdued and  crestfallen now. He could hardly have snubbed the most unassuming  junior. This was a terrible thing, indeed, for a man so unscrupulous  and clever as Montague Nevitt to have wormed out of the registers.  How he could ever have wormed it out Gilbert Gildersleeve hadn't  the faintest idea, Why, who on earth could have shown him the entry  of that fatal marriage--Minnie's first marriage--the marriage with  that wretch who died in Portland prison--the marriage that was  celebrated at St. Mary's, at Mambury? He couldn't for a moment  conceive, for nobody but themselves, he fondly imagined, had ever  identified Mrs. Gilbert Gildersleeve, the wife of the eminent Q.C.,  with that unhappy Mrs. Read, the convict's widow. The convict's  widow. Ah, there was the rub. For she was really a widow in name  alone when Gilbert Gildersleeve married her.    
And Montague Nevitt, that human ferret, with his keen sharp eyes, and  his sleek polite ways, had found it all out in spite of them--had  hunted up the date of Read's death and their marriage, and had  bragged how he was going down to Mambury to prove it!    
All the Warings and Reads always got married at Widdicombe or  Mambury. There were lots of them on the books there, that was one  comfort, anyhow. He'd have a good search to find his needle in  such a pottle of hay. But to think the fellow should have, had the  double-dyed cruelty to break the shameful secret first of all to  Gwendoline! That was his vile way of trying to force a poor girl  into an unwilling consent. Gilbert Gildersleeve lifted his burly  big hands in front of his capacious waistcoat, and pressed them  together angrily. If only he had that rascal's throat well between  them at that moment! He'd crush the fellow's windpipe till he choked  him on the spot, though he answered for it before the judges of  assize to-morrow!    
"There's only one thing possible for it, Minnie," he said at last,  drawing a long deep breath. "I must go down to Mambury to-morrow  to be beforehand with him. And I must either buy him off; or else,  if that won't do--"    
"Or else what, Gilbert?"    
She trembled like an aspen leaf.    
"Or else get at the books in the vestry myself," the Q.C. muttered  low between his clenched teeth, "before the fellow has time to see  them and prove it."
