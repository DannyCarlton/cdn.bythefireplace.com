  All that night the storm came out of the north and east. Hours   after Jeanne and her father had left him Philip went quietly from  his  room, passed down the hall, and opened the outer door. He  could hear  the gale whistling over the top of the great rock, and  moaning in the  spruce and cedar forest, and he closed the door  after him, and buried  himself in the darkness and wind. He bowed  his head to the stinging  snow, which came like blasts of steeled  shot, and hurried into the  shelter of the Sun Rock, and stood  there after that listening to the  wildness of the storm and the  strange whistling of the wind cutting  itself to pieces far over  his head. Since man had first beheld that  rock such storms as this  had come and gone for countless generations.  Two hundred years and  more had passed since Grosellier first looked  out upon a wondrous  world from its summit. And yet this  storm&#8212;to-night&#8212;whistling  and moaning about him, filling all space  with its grief, its  triumph, and its madness, seemed to be for  him&#8212;and for him alone.  His heart answered to it. His soul trembled to  the marvelous  meaning of it. To-night this storm was his own. He was a  part of a  world which he would never leave. Here, beside the great Sun  Rock  of the Crees, he had found home, life, happiness, his God. Here,   henceforth through all time, he would live with his beloved  Jeanne,  dreaming no dreams that went beyond the peace of the  mountains and the  forests. He lifted his face to where the storm  swept above him, and  for an instant he fancied that high up on the  ragged edge of the rock  there might have stood Pierre, with his  great, gaping, hungry heart,  filled with pain and yearning,  staring off into the face of the  Almighty. And he fancied, too,  that beside him there hovered the wife  and mother. And then he  looked to Fort o' God. The lights were out.  Quiet, if not sleep,  had fallen upon all life within. And it seemed to  Philip, as he  went back again through the storm, that in the moaning  tumult of  the night there was music instead of sadness. 
  He did not sleep until nearly morning. And when he awoke he found   that the storm had passed, and that over a world of spotless white   there had risen a brilliant sun. He looked out from his window,  and  saw the top of the Sun Rock glistening in a golden fire, and  where the  forest trees had twisted and moaned there were now  unending canopies  of snow, so that it seemed as though the storm,  in passing, had left  behind only light, and beauty, and happiness  for all living things. 
  Trembling with the joy of this, Philip went to his door, and from   the door down the hall, and where the light of the sun blazed  through  a window near to the great room where he expected to find  the master  of Fort o' God, there stood Jeanne. And as she heard  him coming, and  turned toward him, all the glory and beauty of the  wondrous day was in  her face and hair. Like an angel she stood  waiting for him, pale and  yet flushing a little, her eyes shining  and yearning for him, her soul  in the tremble of the single word  on her sweet lips. 
  &quot;Philip&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;&quot; 
  No more&#8212;and yet against each other their hearts told what it was   futile for their lips to attempt. They looked out through the  window.  Beyond that window, as far as the vision could reach,  swept the  barrens, over which Pierre had brought the little  Jeanne. Something  sobbing rose in the girl's throat. She lifted  her eyes, swimming with  love and tears, to Philip, and from his  breast she reached up both  hands gently to his face. 
  &quot;They will bring Pierre&#8212;to-day&#8212;-&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;to-day.&quot; 
  &quot;We will bury him out yonder,&quot; she said, stroking his face, and he   knew that she meant out in the barren, where the mother lay. 
  He bowed his face close down against hers to hide the woman's   weakness that was bringing a misty film into his eyes. 
  &quot;You love me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You love me&#8212;love me&#8212;and you will   never take me away, but will stay with me always. You will stay   here&#8212;dear&#8212;in my beautiful world&#8212;we two&#8212;alone&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;For ever and for ever,&quot; he murmured. 
  They heard a step, firm and vibrant with the strength of a new   life, and they knew that it was the master of Fort o' God. 
  &quot;Always&#8212;we two&#8212;forever,&quot; whispered Philip again. 
  THE END
