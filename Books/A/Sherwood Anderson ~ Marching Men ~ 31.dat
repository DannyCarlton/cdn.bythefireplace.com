It is difficult not to be of two minds about the manifestation now  called, and perhaps rightly, "The Madness of the Marching Men." In one  mood it comes back to the mind as something unspeakably big and  inspiring. We go each of us through the treadmill of our lives caught  and caged like little animals in some vast menagerie. In turn we love,  marry, breed children, have our moments of blind futile passion and  then something happens. All unconsciously a change creeps over us.  Youth passes. We become shrewd, careful, submerged in little things.  Life, art, great passions, dreams, all of these pass. Under the night  sky the suburbanite stands in the moonlight. He is hoeing his radishes  and worrying because the laundry has torn one of his white collars.  The railroad is to put on an extra morning train. He remembers that  fact heard at the store. For him the night becomes more beautiful. For  ten minutes longer he can stay with the radishes each morning. There  is much of man's life in the figure of the suburbanite standing  absorbed in his own thoughts in the midst of his radishes.    
And so about the business of our lives we go and then of a sudden  there comes again the feeling that crept over us all in the year of  the Marching Men. In a moment we are again a part of the moving mass.  The old religious exaltation, strange emanation from the man McGregor,  returns. In fancy we feel the earth tremble under the feet of the men  --the marchers. With a conscious straining of the mind we strive to  grasp the processes of the mind of the leader during that year when  men sensed his meaning, when they saw as he saw the workers--saw them  massed and moving through the world.    
My own mind, striving feebly to follow that greater and simpler mind,  gropes about. I remember sharply the words of a writer who said that  men make their own gods and realise that I myself saw something of the  birth of such a god. For he was near to being a god then--our  McGregor. The thing he did rumbles in the minds of men yet. His long  shadow will fall across men's thoughts for ages. The tantalising  effort to understand his meaning will tempt us always into endless  speculation.    
Only last week I met a man--he was a steward in a club and lingered  talking to me by a cigar case in an empty billiard-room--who suddenly  turned away to conceal from me two large tears that had jumped into  his eyes because of a kind of tenderness in my voice at the mention of  the Marching Men.    
Another mood comes. It may be the right mood. I see sparrows jumping  about in an ordinary roadway as I walk to my office. From the maple  trees the little winged seeds come fluttering down before my eyes. A  boy goes past sitting in a grocery wagon and over-driving a rather  bony horse. As I walk I overtake two workmen shuffling along. They  remind me of those other workers and I say to myself that thus men  have always shuffled, that never did they swing forward into that  world-wide rhythmical march of the workers.    
"You were drunk with youth and a kind of world madness," says my  normal self as I go forward again, striving to think things out.    
Chicago is still here--Chicago after McGregor and the Marching Men.  The elevated trains still clatter over the frogs at the turning into  Wabash Avenue; the surface cars clang their bells; the crowds pour up  in the morning from the runway leading to the Illinois Central trains;  life goes on. And men in their offices sit in their chairs and say  that the thing that happened was abortive, a brain storm, a wild  outbreak of the rebellious the disorderly and the hunger in the minds  of men.    
What begging of the question. The very soul of the Marching Men was a  sense of order. That was the message of it, the thing that the world  has not come up to yet. Men have not learned that we must come to  understand the impulse toward order, have that burned into our  consciousness, before we move on to other things. There is in us this  madness for individual expression. For each of us the little moment of  running forward and lifting our thin childish voices in the midst of  the great silence. We have not learned that out of us all, walking  shoulder to shoulder, there might arise a greater voice, something to  make the waters of the very seas to tremble.    
McGregor knew. He had a mind not sick with much thinking of trifles.  When he had a great idea he thought it would work and he meant to see  that it did work.    
Mightily was he equipped. I have seen the man in halls talking, his  huge body swaying back and forth, his great fists in the air, his  voice harsh, persistent, insistent--with something of the quality of  the drums in it--beating down into the upturned faces of the men  crowded into the stuffy little places.    
I remember that newspaper men used to sit in their little holes and  write saying of him that the times made McGregor. I do not know about  that. The city caught fire from the man at the time of that terrible  speech of his in the court room when Polk Street Mary grew afraid and  told the truth. There he stood, the raw untried red-haired miner from  the mines and the Tenderloin, facing an angry court and a swarm of  protesting lawyers and uttering that city-shaking philippic against  the old rotten first ward and the creeping cowardice in men that lets  vice and disease go on and pervade all modern life. It was in a way  another "J'Accuse!" from the lips of another Zola. Men who heard it  have told me that when he had finished in the whole court no man spoke  and no man dared feel guiltless. "For the moment something--a section,  a cell, a figment, of men's brains opened--and in that terrible  illuminating instant they saw themselves as they were and what they  had let life become."    
They saw something else, or thought they did, saw McGregor a new force  for Chicago to reckon with. After the trial one young newspaper man  returned to his office and running from desk to desk yelled in the  faces of his brother reporters: "Hell's out for noon. We've got a big  red-haired Scotch lawyer up here on Van Buren Street that is a kind of  a new scourge of the world. Watch the First Ward get it."    
But McGregor never looked at the First Ward. That wasn't bothering  him. From the court room he went to march with men in a new field.    
Followed the time of waiting and of patient quiet work. In the  evenings McGregor worked at the law cases in the bare room in Van  Buren Street. That queer bird Henry Hunt still stayed with him,  collecting tithes for the gang and going to his respectable home at  night--a strange triumph of the small that had escaped the tongue of  McGregor on that day in court when so many men had their names bruited  to the world in McGregor's roll call--the roll call of the men who  were but merchants, brothers of vice, the men who should have been  masters in the city.    
And then the movement of the Marching Men began to come to the  surface. It got into the blood of men. That harsh drumming voice began  to shake their hearts and their legs.    
Everywhere men began to see and hear of the Marchers. From lip to lip  ran the question, "What's going on?"    
"What's going on?" How that cry ran over Chicago. Every newspaper man  in town got assignments on the story. The papers were loaded with it  every day. All over the city they appeared, everywhere--the Marching  Men.    
There were leaders enough! The Cuban War and the State Militia had  taught too many men the swing of the march step for there not to be at  least two or three competent drill masters in every little company of  men.    
And there was the marching song the Russian wrote for McGregor. Who  could forget it? Its high pitched harsh feminine strain rang in the  brain. How it went pitching and tumbling along in that wailing calling  endless high note. It had strange breaks and intervals in the  rendering. The men did not sing it. They chanted it. There was in it  just the weird haunting something the Russians know how to put into  their songs and into the books they write. It isn't the quality of the  soil. Some of our own music has that. But in this Russian song there  was something else, something world-wide and religious--a soul, a  spirit. Perhaps it is just the spirit that broods over that strange  land and people. There was something of Russia in McGregor himself.    
Anyway the marching song was the most persistently penetrating thing  Americans had ever heard. It was in the streets, the shops, the  offices, the alleys and in the air overhead--the wail--half shout. No  noise could drown it. It swung and pitched and rioted through the air.    
And there was the fellow who wrote the music down for McGregor. He was  the real thing and he bore the marks of the shackles on his legs. He  had remembered the march from hearing the men sing it as they went  over the Steppes to Siberia, the men who were going up out of misery  to more misery. "It would come out of the air," he explained. "The  guards would run down the line of men to shout and strike out with  their short whips. 'Stop it!' they cried. And still it went on for  hours, defying everything, there on the cold cheerless plains."    
And he had brought it to America and put it to music for McGregor's  marchers.    
Of course the police tried to stop the marchers. Into a street they  would run crying "Disperse!" The men did disperse only to appear again  on some vacant lot working away at the perfection of the marching.  Once an excited squad of police captured a company of them. The same  men were back in line the next evening. The police could not arrest a  hundred thousand men because they marched shoulder to shoulder along  the streets and chanted a weird march song as they went.    
The whole thing was not an outbreak of labour. It was something  different from anything that had come into the world before. The  unions were in it but besides the unions there were the Poles, the  Russian Jews, the Hunks from the stockyards and the steel works in  South Chicago. They had their own leaders, speaking their own  languages. And how they could throw their legs into the march! The  armies of the old world had for years been training men for the  strange demonstration that had broken out in Chicago.    
The thing was hypnotic. It was big. It is absurd to sit writing of it  now in such majestic terms but you have to go back to the newspapers  of that day to realise how the imagination of men was caught and held.    
Every train brought writers tumbling into Chicago. In the evening  fifty of them would gather in the back room at Weingardner's  restaurant where such men congregate.    
And then the thing broke out all over the country, in steel towns like  Pittsburgh and Johnstown and Lorain and McKeesport and men working in  little independent factories in towns down in Indiana began drilling  and chanting the march song on summer evenings on the village baseball  ground.    
How the people, the comfortable well-fed middle class people were  afraid! It swept over the country like a religious revival, the  creeping dread.    
The writing men got to McGregor, the brain back of it all, fast  enough. Everywhere his influence appeared. In the afternoon there  would be a hundred newspaper men standing on the stairway leading up  to the big bare office in Van Buren Street. At his desk he sat, big  and red and silent. He looked like a man half asleep. I suppose the  thing that was in their minds had something to do with the way men  looked at him but in any case the crowd in Weingardner's agreed that  there was in the man something of the same fear-inspiring bigness  there was in the movement he had started and was guiding.    
It seems absurdly simple now. There he sat at his desk. The police  might have walked in and arrested him. But if you begin figuring that  way the whole thing was absurd. What differs it if men march coming  from work, swinging along shoulder to shoulder or shuffle aimlessly  along, and what harm can come out of the singing of a song?    
You see McGregor understood something that all of us had not counted  on. He knew that every one has an imagination. He was at war with  men's minds. He challenged something in us that we hardly realised was  there. He had been sitting there for years thinking it out. He had  watched Dr. Dowie and Mrs. Eddy. He knew what he was doing.    
A crowd of newspaper men went one night to hear McGregor at a big  outdoor meeting up on the North Side. Dr. Cowell was with them--the  big English statesman and writer who later was drowned on the  <i>Titanic.</i> He was a big man, physically and mentally, and was in  Chicago to see McGregor and try to understand what he was doing.    
And McGregor got him as he had all men. Out there under the sky the  men stood silent, Cowell's head sticking up above the sea of faces,  and McGregor talked. The newspaper men declared he could not talk.  They were wrong about that. McGregor had a way of throwing up his arms  and straining and shouting out his sentences, that got to the souls of  men.    
He was a kind of crude artist drawing pictures on the mind.    
That night he talked about labour as always--labour personified--huge  crude old Labour. How he made the men before him see and feel the  blind giant who has lived in the world since time began and who still  goes stumbling blindly about, rubbing his eyes and lying down to sleep  away centuries in the dust of the fields and the factories.    
A man arose in the audience and climbed upon the platform beside  McGregor. It was a daring thing to do and men's knees trembled. While  the man was crawling up to the platform shouts arose. One has in mind  a picture of a bustling little fellow going into the house and into  the upper room where Jesus and his followers were having the last  supper together, going in there to wrangle about the price to be paid  for the wine.    
The man who got on the platform with McGregor was a socialist. He  wanted to argue.    
But McGregor did not argue with him. He sprang forward, it was a quick  tiger-like movement, and spun the socialist about, making him stand  small and blinking and comical before the crowd.    
Then McGregor began to talk. He made of the little stuttering arguing  socialist a figure representing all labour, made him the  personification of the old weary struggle of the world. And the  socialist who went to argue stood with tears in his eyes, proud of his  position in men's eyes.    
All over the city McGregor talked of old Labour and how he was to be  built up and put before men's eyes by the movement of the Marching  Men. How our legs tingled to fall in step and go marching away with  him.    
Out of the crowds there came the note of that wailing march. Some one  always started that.    
That night on the North Side Doctor Cowell got hold of the shoulder of  a newspaper man and led him to a car. He who knew Bismarck and who had  sat in council with kings went walking and babbling half the night  through the empty streets.    
It is amusing now to think of the things men said under the influence  of McGregor. Like old Doctor Johnson and his friend Savage they walked  half drunk through the streets swearing that whatever happened they  would stick to the movement. Doctor Cowell himself said things just as  absurd as that.    
And all over the country men were getting the idea--the Marching Men--  old Labour in one mass marching before the eyes of men--old Labour  that was going to make the world see--see and feel its bigness at  last. Men were to come to the end of strife--men united--Marching!  Marching! Marching!
