  The others followed Rod's arm. Behind him he heard the gentle click  of Wabigoon's revolver and the sharp, vicious snap of the safety on  Mukoki's rifle.
  From beyond the driftwood there was rising a thin spiral of smoke!
  &#8220;Whoever they are, they have certainly seen or heard us!&#8221; said Wabi,  after they had stood in silence for a full minute.
  &#8220;Unless they are gone from camp,&#8221; replied Rod in a whisper.
  &#8220;Keep eyes open!&#8221; warned Mukoki as they advanced cautiously in the  direction of the smoke. &#8220;No can tell what, I guess so!&#8221;
  He was first to mount the driftwood, and then he gave vent to a huge  grunt. The smoke was rising from beside a charred log which was heaped  half-way up its side with ashes and earth. In a flash the meaning of  the ash and dirt dawned on Rod and his companions. The fire was banked.  Those who had built it were gone, but they expected to return. The  naked footprints were thick about the camp-fire, and close to one end  of the charred log were scattered a number of bones. One after another  Mukoki picked up several of these and closely examined them. While Rod  and Wabigoon were still gazing about them in blank astonishment, half  expecting attack from a savage horde at any moment, the old warrior had  already reached a conclusion, and calling to his companions he brought  their attention to the tracks in the sand.
  &#8220;Same feet!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;One man mak' all track!&#8221;
  &#8220;Impossible!&#8221; cried Wabi. &#8220;There are&#8212;thousands of them!&#8221;
  Mukoki grunted and fell upon his knees.
  &#8220;Heem big toe&#8212;right foot&#8212;broke sometime. Same in all track. See?&#8221;
  Disgusted at his own lack of observation, Wabigoon saw at once that  the old pathfinder was right. The joint of the big toe on the right  foot was twisted fully half an inch outward, a deformity that left a  peculiar impression in the sand, and every other track bore this  telltale mark. No sooner were the two boys convinced of the correctness  of Mukoki's assertion than another and still more startling surprise  was sprung on them. Holding out his handful of bones, Mukoki said:
  &#8220;Meat no cook&#8212;eat raw!&#8221;
  &#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; gasped Rod.
  Wabi's eyes flashed with a new understanding, and as he gazed into  Rod's astonished face the latter, too, began to comprehend the  significance of it all.
  &#8220;It must have been the madman!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he was here yesterday!&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably the day before,&#8221; said Wabi. The young Indian turned  suddenly to Mukoki. &#8220;What did he want of the fire if he didn't cook  meat?&#8221; he asked.
  Mukoki shrugged his shoulders but did not answer.
  &#8220;Well, it wasn't cooked, anyway,&#8221; declared Wabi, again examining the  bones. &#8220;Here are chunks of raw flesh clinging to the bones. Perhaps he  just singed the outside of his meat.&#8221;
  The old Indian nodded at this suggestion and turned to investigate  the fire. On the end of the log were two stones, one flat and the other  round and smooth, and after a moment's inspection of these he dropped  an exclamation which was unusual for him, and which he used only in  those rare intervals when all other language seemed to fail him.
  &#8220;Bad dog man&#8212;mak' bullet&#8212;here!&#8221; he called, holding out the stones.  &#8220;See&#8212;gold&#8212;gold!&#8221;
  The boys hurried to his side.
  &#8220;See&#8212;gold!&#8221; he repeated excitedly.
  In the center of the flat stone there was a gleaming yellow film. A  single glance told the story. With the round stone for a hammer the mad  hunter had pounded his golden bullets into shape upon the flat stone!  There was no longer a doubt in their minds; they were in the madman's  camp. That morning they had left this strange creature of the  wilderness fifty miles away. But how far away was he now? The fire  slumbering under its covering of ash and earth proved that he meant to  return&#8212;and soon. Would he travel by night as well as by day? Was it  possible that he was already close behind them?
  &#8220;He travels with the swiftness of an animal,&#8221; said Wabi, speaking in  a low voice to Rod. &#8220;Perhaps he will return to-night!&#8221;
  Mukoki overheard him and shook his head.
  &#8220;Mak' heem through chasm in two day on snow-shoe,&#8221; he declared,  referring to his trip of exploration to the first waterfall over the  snows of the previous winter. &#8220;No mak' in t'ree day over rock!&#8221;
  &#8220;If Mukoki is satisfied, I am,&#8221; said Rod. &#8220;We can pull up behind the  driftwood on the farther edge of the lake bed.&#8221;
  Wabi made no objection, and the camp site was chosen. Strangely  enough, with the discovery of the footprints, the fire, the picked  bones and the stones with which the mad hunter had manufactured his  golden bullets, Mukoki seemed to have lost all fear of the wild  creature of the chasm. He was confident now that he had only a man to  deal with, a man who had gone &#8220;bad dog,&#8221; and his curiosity overcame his  alarm. His assurance served to dispel the apprehension of his  companions, and sleep came early to the tired adventurers. Nor did  anything occur during the night to awaken them.
  Soon after dawn the trip down the chasm stream was resumed. With the  abrupt turning of the channel to the north, however, there was an  almost immediate change in the topography of the country. Within an  hour the precipitous walls of the mountains gave place to  verdure-covered slopes, and now and then the gold seekers found  themselves between plains that swept back for a mile or more on either  side. Frequent signs of game were observed along the shores of the  river and several times during the morning moose and caribou were seen  in the distance. A few months before, when they had invaded the  wilderness to hunt and trap, this country would have aroused the  wildest enthusiasm among Rod and his friends, but now they gave but  little thought to their rifles. That morning they had set out with the  intention of reaching the second waterfall before dusk, and it was with  disappointment rather than gladness that they saw the swift current of  the chasm torrent change into the slower, steadier sweep of a stream  that had now widened into a fair-sized river. According to the map the  second fall was about fifty-five miles from the mad hunter's camp.  Darkness found them still fifteen miles from where it should be.
  Excitement kept Rod awake most of that night. Try as he would, he  could not keep visions of the lost treasure out of his mind. The next  day they would be far on their way to the third and last waterfall. And  then&#8212;the gold! That they might not find it, that the passing of half a  century or more might have obliterated all traces left by its ancient  discoverers, never for a moment disturbed his belief.
  He was the first awake the following morning, the first to take his  place in the canoe. Every minute now his ears were keenly attuned for  that distant sound of falling water. But hours passed without a sign of  it. Noon came. They had traveled six hours and had covered twenty-five  miles instead of fifteen! Where was the waterfall?
  There was a little more of anxiety in Wabigoon's eyes when they  resumed their journey after dinner. Again and again Rod looked at his  map, figuring out the distances as drawn by John Ball, the murdered  Englishman. Surely the second waterfall could not be far away now! And  still hour after hour passed, and mile after mile slipped behind them,  until the three knew that they had gone fully thirty miles beyond where  the cataract should have been, if the map was right. Twilight was  falling when they stopped for supper. For the last hour Mukoki had  spoken no word. A feeling of gloom was on them all; without  questioning, each knew what the fears of the others were.
  Was it possible that, after all, they had not solved the secret of  the mysterious map?
  The more Rod thought of it the more his fears possessed him. The two  men who fought and died in the old cabin were on their way to  civilization. They were taking gold with them, gold which they meant to  exchange for supplies. Would they, at the same time, dare to have in  their possession a map so closely defining their trail as the rude  sketch on the bit of birch bark? Was there not some strange key, known  only to themselves, necessary to the understanding of that sketch?
  Mukoki had taken his rifle and disappeared in the plain along the  river, and for a long time after they had eaten their bear steak and  drank their hot coffee Rod and Wabigoon sat talking in the glow of the  camp-fire. The old warrior had been gone for about an hour when  suddenly there came the report of a gun from far down the stream, which  was quickly followed by two others&#8212;three in rapid succession. After an  interval of a few seconds there sounded two other shots.
  &#8220;The signal!&#8221; cried Rod. &#8220;Mukoki wants us!&#8221;
  Wabigoon sprang to his feet and emptied the five shots of his  magazine into the air.
  &#8220;Listen!&#8221;
  Hardly had the echoes died away when there came again the reports of  Mukoki's rifle.
  Without another word the two boys hurried to the canoe, which had  not been unloaded.
  &#8220;He's a couple of miles down-stream,&#8221; said Wabi, as they shoved off.  &#8220;I wonder what's the matter?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can make a pretty good guess,&#8221; replied Rod, his voice trembling  with a new excitement. &#8220;He has found the second waterfall!&#8221;
  The thought gave fresh strength to their aching arms and the canoe  sped swiftly down the stream. Fifteen minutes later another shot  signaled to them, this time not more than a quarter of a mile away, and  Wabi responded to it with a loud shout. Mukoki's voice floated back in  an answering halloo, but before the young hunters came within sight of  their comrade another sound reached their ears,&#8212;the muffled roar of a  cataract! Again and again the boys sent their shouts of joy echoing  through the night, and above the tumult of their own voices they heard  the old warrior calling on them to put into shore. Mukoki was waiting  for them when they landed.
  &#8220;This is big un!&#8221; he greeted. &#8220;Mak' much noise, much swift water!&#8221;
  &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; yelled Rod for the twentieth time, jumping up and down in  his excitement.
  &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Wabi.
  And Mukoki chuckled, and grinned, and rubbed his leathery hands  together in high glee.
  At last, when they had somewhat cooled down, Wabi said:
  &#8220;That John Ball was a pretty poor fellow at a guess, eh? What do you  say, Rod?&#8221;
  &#8220;Or else pretty clever,&#8221; added Rod. &#8220;By George, I wonder if he had a  reason for making his scale fifty miles or so out of the way?&#8221;
  Wabi looked at him, only partly understanding.
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;I mean that our third waterfall is more than likely to be mighty  close to this one! And if it is&#8212;well, John Ball had a reason, and a  good one! If we strike the last fall to-morrow it will be pretty good  proof that he drew the map in a way intended to puzzle  somebody,&#8212;perhaps his two partners, who were just about to start for  civilization.&#8221;
  &#8220;Muky, how far have we come?&#8221; asked Wabigoon.
  &#8220;T'ree time first fall,&#8221; replied the old Indian quickly.
  &#8220;A hundred and fifty miles&#8212;in three days and one night. I don't  believe that is far out of the way. Then, according to the map, we  should still be a hundred miles from the third fall.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we're not more than twenty-five!&#8221; declared Rod confidently.  &#8220;Let's build a fire and go to bed. We'll have enough to do  to-morrow&#8212;hunting gold!&#8221; The fourth day's journey was begun before it  was yet light. Breakfast was eaten in the glow of the camp-fire, and by  the time dawn broke the adventurers were already an hour upon their  way. Nothing but confidence now, animated them. The mad hunter and his  golden bullets were entirely forgotten in these last hours of their  exciting quest. Once, far back, Rod had thought with chilling dread  that this might be the madman's trail, that his golden bullets might  come from the treasure they were seeking. But he gave no thought to  this possibility now. His own belief that the third and last fall was  not far distant, in spite of the evidence of the map, gradually gained  possession of his companions, and the nerves of all three were keyed to  the highest tension of expectancy. The preceding night Mukoki had made  himself a paddle to replace the one he had broken, and not a stroke of  the three pairs of arms was lost. Early in the morning a young moose  allowed them to pass within a hundred yards of him. But no shot was  fired, for to obtain the meat would have meant an hour's loss of time.
  Two hours after the start the country again began taking on a sudden  change. From east and west the wild mountain ridges closed in, and with  each mile's progress the stream narrowed and grew swifter, until again  it was running between chasm walls that rose black and silent over the  adventurers' heads. Darker and gloomier became the break between the  mountains. Far above, a thousand feet or more, dense forests of red  pine flung their thick shadows over the edge of the chasm, in places  almost completely shutting out the light of day. This was not like the  other chasm. It was deeper and darker and more sullen. Under its walls  the gloom was almost that of night. Its solitude was voiceless; not a  bird fluttered or chirped among its rocks; the lowest of whispered  words sounded with startling distinctness. Once Rod spoke aloud, and  his voice rose and beat itself in the cavernous depths of the walls  until it seemed as though he had shouted. Now they ceased paddling, and  Mukoki steered. Noiselessly the current swept them on. In the twilight  gloom Rod's face shone with singular whiteness. Mukoki and Wabigoon  crouched like bronze silhouettes. It was as if some mysterious  influence held them in its power, forbidding speech, holding their eyes  in staring expectancy straight ahead, filling them with indefinable  sensations that made their hearts beat faster and their blood tingle.
  Softly, from far ahead, at last there came a murmur. It was like the  first gentle whispering of an approaching wind, the soughing of a  breath among the pines at the top of the chasm. But a wind among the  trees rises, and then dies away, like a chord struck low and gently  upon some soft-toned instrument. This whisper that came up the chasm  remained. It grew no louder, and sometimes it almost faded away, until  the straining ears of those who listened could barely detect it; but  after a moment it was there again, as plainly as before. Little by  little it became more distinct, until there were no longer intervals  when it died away, and at last Wabigoon turned in the bow and faced his  companions, and though he spoke no word there was the gleam of a great  excitement in his eyes. Rod's heart beat like a drum. He, too, began to  understand. That moaning, whispering sound floating up the chasm was  not the wind, but the far-away rumble of the third waterfall!
  Mukoki's voice broke the tense silence from behind.
  &#8220;That the fall!&#8221;
  Wabigoon replied in words scarcely louder than a whisper. There was  no joyful shouting now, as there had been at the discovery of the  second fall. Even Mukoki's voice was so low that the others could  barely hear. Something between these chasm walls seemed to demand  silence from them, and as the rumble of the cataract came more and more  clearly to their ears they held their breath in voiceless anticipation.  A few hundred yards ahead of them was the treasure which men long since  dead had discovered more than half a century before; between the black  mountain walls that so silently guarded that treasure there seemed to  lurk the spirit presence of the three men who had died because of it.  Here, somewhere very near, John Ball had been murdered, and Rod almost  fancied that along the sandy edge of the chasm stream they might  stumble on the footprints of the men whose skeletons they had  discovered in the ancient cabin.
  Mukoki uttered no sound as he guided the canoe ashore. Still without  word, the three picked up their rifles and Wabigoon led the way along  the edge of the stream. Soon it dashed a swift racing torrent between  the rocks, and Rod and his companions knew that they were close upon  the fall. A hundred yards or more and they saw the white mist of it  leaping up before their eyes. Wabi began to run, his moccasined feet  springing from stone to stone with the caution of a hunter approaching  game, and Mukoki and Rod came close behind him.
  They paused upon the edge of a great mass of rock with the spray of  the plunging cataract rising in their faces. Breathless they gazed  down. It was not a large fall. Wabi silently measured it at forty feet.  But it added just that much more to the depth and the gloom of the  chasm beyond, into which there seemed no way of descent. The rock walls  rose sheer and black, with clumps of cedar and stunted pine growing at  their feet. Farther on the space between the mountains became wider,  and the river reached out on either side, frothing and beating itself  into white fury in a chaos of slippery water-worn rocks.
  Down there&#8212;somewhere&#8212;was the golden treasure they had come to  seek, unless the map lied! Was it among those rocks, where the water  dashed and fumed? Was it hidden in some gloomy cavern of the mountain  sides, its trail concealed by the men who discovered it half an age  ago? Would they find it, after all&#8212;would they find it?
  A great gulp of excitement rose in Rod's throat, and he looked at  Wabigoon.
  The Indian youth had stretched out an arm. His eyes were blazing,  his whole attitude was one of tense emotion.
  &#8220;There's the cabin,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;the cabin built by John Ball and the  two Frenchmen! See, over there among those cedars, almost hidden in  that black shadow of the mountain! Great Scott, Muky&#8212;Rod&#8212;can't you  see? Can't you see?&#8221;
