Senator North had been formally invited by Mrs. Madison for dinner  that evening, and Betty, who had parted from him just seven hours  before, restrained an impulse to run down the terrace as his boat made  the landing. Emory and Harriet were on the veranda, however, and she  managed to look stately and more or less indifferent at the head of  the steps. There were pillars and vines on either side of her, and  bunches of purple wistaria hung above her head. It was a picturesque  frame for a picturesque figure in white, and a kindly consideration  for Senator North's highly trained and exacting eye kept her immovable  for nearly five minutes. As he reached the steps, however, self-  consciousness suddenly possessed her and she started precipitately to  meet him. She wore slippers with high Louis Quinze heels. One caught  in a loosened strand of the mat. Her other foot went too far. She made  a desperate effort to reach the next step, and fell down the whole  flight with one unsupported ankle twisted under her.    
For a moment the pain was so intense she hardly was aware that Senator  North had his arm about her shoulders while Emory was straightening  her out. Harriet was screaming frantically. She gave a sharp scream  herself as Emory touched her ankle, but repressed a second as she  heard her mother's voice.    
Mrs. Madison stood in the doorway with more amazement than alarm on  her face.    
"Betty?" she cried. "Nothing can have happened to Betty! Why, she has  not even had a doctor since she was six years old."    
"It's nothing but a sprained ankle," said Emory. "For heaven's sake,  keep quiet, Harriet," he added impatiently, "and go and get some hot  water. Let's get her into the house."    
Betty by this time was laughing hysterically. Her ankle felt like a  hot pincushion, and the unaccustomed experience of pain, combined with  Harriet's shrieks, delivered with a strong darky accent, and her  mother's attitude of disapproval, assaulted her nerves.    
When they had carried her in and put her foot into a bucket of hot  water, she forgot them completely, and while her mother fanned her and  Senator North forced her to swallow brandy, she felt that all the  intensity of life's emotions was circumferenced by a wooden bucket.  But when they had carefully extended her on the sofas and Emory, who  had a farmer's experience with broken bones, announced his intention  of examining her ankle at once, Betty with remarkable presence of  mind asked Senator North to hold her hand. This he did with a firmness  which fortified her during the painful ordeal, and Mrs. Madison was  not terrified by so much as a moan.    
"You have pluck!" exclaimed Senator North when Emory, after much  prodding, had announced that it was only a sprain. "You have splendid  courage."    
Emory assured her that she was magnificent, and Betty felt so proud of  herself that she had no desire to undo the accident.    
In the days that followed, although she suffered considerable pain,  she enjoyed herself thoroughly. It was her first experience of being  "fussed over," as she expressed it. She never had had so much as a  headache, no one within her memory had asked her how she felt, and she  had regarded her mother as the centre of the medical universe. Now a  clever and sympathetic doctor came over every day from the hotel and  felt her pulse, and intimated that she was his most important patient.  Mrs. Madison insisted upon bathing her head, Emory and Harriet treated  her like a sovereign whose every wish must be anticipated, even the  servants managed to pass the door of her sitting-room a dozen times a  day. Senator North came over every morning and sat by her couch of  many rose-coloured pillows; and not only looked tender and anxious,  but suggested that the statesman within him was dead.    
"It is hard on you, though," she murmured one day, when they happened  to be alone for a few moments. "Two invalids are more than one man's  portion. And no one ever enjoyed the outdoor life as you do."    
"This room is full of sunshine and fresh air, and I came up here to be  with you. I don't know but what I am heartless enough to enjoy seeing  such an imperious and insolently healthy person helpless for a time,  and to be able to wait on her."    
"I feel as if the entire order of the universe had been reversed."    
"It will do you good. I hope you will have every variety of pleasure  at least once in your life."    
"You are laughing at me--but as I am a truthful person I will confide  to you that I almost hate the idea of being well again."    
"Of course you do. And as for the real invalids they enjoy themselves  thoroughly. The great compensation law is blessed or cursed, whichever  way you choose to look at it."    
"I wonder if you had happened to be unmarried, what price we would  have had to pay."    
"God knows. The compensation law is the most immutable of all the  fates."    
"I have most of the gifts of life,--good looks, wealth, position,  brains, and the power of making people like me. So I am not permitted  to have the best of all. If I could, I wonder which of the others I'd  lose. Probably we'd have an accident on our wedding journey, which  would reduce my nerves to such a state that I'd be irritable for the  rest of my life and lose my good looks and power to make you happy.  It's a queer world."    
He made no reply.    
"What are you thinking of?" she asked, meeting his eyes.    
"That you are not to become anything so commonplace as a pessimist.  Get everything out of the present that is offered you and give no  thought to the future. What is it?" he added tenderly, as the blood  came into her cheeks and she knit her brows.    
"I moved my ankle and it hurt me so!" She moved her hand at the same  time, and he took it, and held it until her brows relaxed, which was  not for some time.    
The best of women are frauds. Betty made that ankle the pivot of her  circle for the rest of the summer. When she wanted to see Senator  North look tender and worried, she puckered her brows and sighed. When  she felt the promptings of her newly acquired desire to be "fussed  over," she dropped suddenly upon a couch and demanded a cushion for  her foot, or asked to be assisted to a hammock. She often laughed at  herself; but the new experience was very sweet, and she wondered over  Life's odd and unexpected sources of pleasure.
