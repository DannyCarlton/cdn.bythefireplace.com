That was the last of Hamilton's battles in the Cabinet. Jefferson  resigned; although, in order that the Administration might, until the  crisis was past, preserve an unbroken front to the country, he  reluctantly consented to withhold his resignation until the assembling  of Congress. He retired to Monticello, however; and apologized to the  Secretary of the Treasury.    
Hamilton, almost immediately, was taken down with yellow fever, which  broke out suddenly and raged with a fearful violence. To the ordinary  odours of carcasses and garbage, were added those of vinegar, tar,  nitre, garlic, and gunpowder. Every disinfectant America had ever heard  of was given a trial, and every man who possessed a shot-gun fired it  all day and all night. The bells tolled incessantly. The din and the  smells were hideous, the death carts rattled from dawn till dawn; many  were left unburied in their houses for a week; hundreds died daily; and  the city confessed itself helpless, although it cleaned the streets.  Hamilton had a very light attack, but Dr. Stevens dropped in frequently  to see him; he privately thought him of more importance than all  Philadelphia.    
Lying there and thinking of many things, too grateful for the rest to  chafe at the imprisonment, and striving for peace with himself, Hamilton  one day conceived the idea of immersing yellow-fever patients in  ice-water. Microbes were undiscovered, but Hamilton, perhaps with a  flashing glimpse of the truth, reasoned that if cold weather invariably  routed the disease, a freezing of the infected blood should produce the  same result. He succeeded in convincing Stevens, with the issue that  when the scourge was over, the young West Indian doctor had so many  cures to his credit, where all other physicians had failed, that the  City Council presented him with a silver tankard, gratefully inscribed,  and filled with golden coins. Hamilton's fecund brain, scattering its  creations, made more than one reputation.    
Meanwhile, he awoke one day to find Mrs. Croix sitting beside his bed.  She had left town in June, and usually did not return until late in  September. She wore a white frock and a blue sash, and looked like an  angel about to do penance.    
"I have come back to take care of the sick, including yourself," she  announced, "I was born to be a nurse, and I felt that my place was here.  I have come to see you first, and I shall call daily, but otherwise I am  in Dr. Stevens's hands."    
Hamilton stared at her. He was not surprised, for she was kind hearted  in her erratic imperious fashion, and much beloved by the poor; nor was  she afraid of anything under heaven. But she was the last person he had  wished to see; she was for his triumphant hours, or his furious, not for  helpless invalidism. He had longed consistently for his wife, and  written to her by every packet-boat, lest she suspect his illness and  return to the plague-stricken city. He was filled with a sudden  resentment that any other woman should presume to fill her chair. To  forget her under overwhelming provocation he had reconciled to his  conscience with little difficulty, for his extenuations were many, and  puritanism had not yet invaded the national character; but to permit  another woman to ministrate to him when ill, he felt to be an  unpardonable breach of his Eliza's rights, and his loyalty rebelled. So,  although he treated Mrs. Croix with politeness while she remained, he  gave orders to Dr. Stevens to keep her away upon any pretext he chose.  "I am too nervous to be bothered with women," he added; and Stevens  obeyed without comment.    
Hamilton's convalescence was cheered by two facts: the revival of his  spirits and equilibrium, and frequent assurances from his wife that for  the first time in five years she was entirely well. She wrote that she  had regained all her old colour, "spring," vivacity, and plumpness, and  felt quite ten years younger. Hamilton was delighted; for her courage  had so far exceeded her strength that he had often feared a collapse.  Although she detested the sight of a pen, she was so elated with her  recovered health that she wrote to him weekly. Suddenly, and without  explanation, the letters stopped. Still, he was quite unprepared for  what was to follow, and on the first of October, his health improved by  a short sojourn in the country, he went to the wharf to meet the  packet-boat which invariably brought his family; his pockets full of  sweets, and not a misgiving in his mind.    
As he stood on the wharf, watching the boat towed slowly to dock, his  four oldest children suddenly appeared, waving their hats and shouting  like young Indians. James, who was as broad as he was long, and was  wedged firmly between Angelica and Philip lest he turn over, swelled a  chorus which excited much amusement among by-standers. To Hamilton's  surprise his wife did not occupy her usual place behind that  enthusiastic group, but as the boat touched the pier, and all four  precipitated themselves upon him at once,--the three oldest about his  neck, and James upon his pockets,--he forgot her for the moment in the  delight of seeing and embracing his children after three months of  separation. He emerged from that wild greeting, dishevelled and  breathless, only to disappear once more within six long arms and a  circle of sunburned faces. Hamilton received from his children an almost  frantic affection; indeed, few people merely liked him; it was either  hate or a love which far transcended the bounds of such affection as the  average mortal commands. The passion he inspired in his children cost  one his life, another her reason, and left its indelible mark on a  third; but for what they gave, they received an overflowing measure in  return; no man was ever more passionately attached to his brood, nor  took a greater delight in its society.    
Suddenly, through the web of Angelica's flying locks, he saw that his  wife had appeared on deck and was about to land. He disentangled himself  hastily and went forward to greet her. In a flash he noted that she was  prettier than ever, and that she was affected by something far more  extraordinary than an increase of health. She threw back her head, and  her black eyes flashed with anger as he approached with the assurance of  thirteen years of connubial ownership; but she greeted him politely and  took his arm. No explanation was possible there; and he escorted her and  the children to the coach as quickly as possible. Philip, Angelica, and  Alexander were sensible at once of the chasm yawning between the seats;  they redoubled their attentions to their father, and regarded their  mother with reproving and defiant eyes. Poor Betsey, conscious that she  was entirely in the right, felt bitter and humiliated, and sought to  find comfort in the indifference of James, who was engaged with a  cornucopia and blind to the infelicity of his parents.    
When they reached the house, Hamilton dismissed the children and opened  the door of his library.    
"Will you come in?" he said peremptorily.    
Mrs. Hamilton entered, and sat down on a high-backed chair. She was very  small, her little pigeon toes were several inches above the floor; but  no judge on his bench ever looked so stern and so inexorable.    
"Now," said Hamilton, who was cold from head to foot, for he had an  awful misgiving, "let us have an explanation at once. This is our first  serious misunderstanding, and you well know that I shall be in misery  until it is over--"    
"I have not the least intention of keeping you in suspense," interrupted  Betsey, sarcastically. "I am too thankful that you did not happen to  come to Saratoga when <i>I</i> was prostrated with misery. I have gone  through everything,--every stage of wretchedness that the human heart is  capable of,--but now, thank Heaven, I am filled with only a just  indignation. Read that!"    
She produced a letter from her reticule and flipped it at him. Even  before he opened it he recognized the familiar handwriting, the profuse  capitals, of Mrs. Reynolds. Fortunately, he made no comment, for the  contents were utterly different from his quick anticipation. It  contained a minute and circumstantial account of his visits during the  past year to Mrs. Croix, with many other details, which, by spying and  bribing, no doubt, she had managed to gather. Failing one revenge, the  woman had resorted to another, and fearing that it might be lost among  the abundant and surfeiting lies of the public press, she had aimed at  what he held most dear. The letter was so minute and circumstantial that  it would have convinced almost any woman.    
There was but one thing for Hamilton to do, and he lied with his  unsurpassable eloquence. When he paused tentatively, his wife  remarked:--    
"Alexander, you are a very great man, but you are a wretchedly poor  liar. As Mr. Washington would say, your sincerity is one of the most  valuable of your gifts, and without it you could not convince a child.  As if this were not enough, only yesterday, on the boat, I overheard two  of your intimate friends discussing this intrigue as a matter of course.  There was not a word of censure or criticism; they were merely wondering  when you would add to your enemies; for as this woman was desperately in  love with you, she was bound to hate you as violently when you tired of  her. I think men are horrors!" she burst out passionately. "When, unable  to bear this terrible affliction any longer, and unwilling to worry my  poor mother, I took that letter and my grief to my father--what do you  suppose he said? After he had tried to convince me that the story was a  base fabrication, and that an anonymous communication should be  destroyed unread--as if any woman living would not read an anonymous  letter!--he said, crossly, that women did not understand men and never  made allowances for them; and he went on to make as many excuses for you  as if he were defending himself; and then wound up by saying that he did  not believe a word of it, and that the letter was written by someone you  had flouted. But it seemed to me in those awful days that I was awake  for the first time, that for the first time I understood you--and your  horrid sex, in general--I do! I do!"    
She looked so adorable with her flashing eyes, the hot colour in her  cheek, and the new personality she exhibited, that Hamilton would have  foregone a triumph over his enemies to kiss her. But he dared not make a  false move, and he was terribly perplexed.    
"I can only reiterate," he said, "that this letter is a lie from  beginning to end. It is written by a woman, who, with her husband, has  blackmailed me and jeopardized my reputation. I treated them as they  deserved, and this is their next move. As for Mrs. Croix, I repeat, she  is a most estimable person, whose brilliant wit and talent for politics  draw all public men about her. There is hardly one among them who might  not be victimized by a similar attack. I doubt if I have called half as  often as many others. As for the friends whom you heard discussing my  visits--you know the love of the human mind for scandal. Please be  reasonable. You have made me the most wretched man on earth, I shall be  unfit for public duty or anything else if you continue to treat me in  this brutal manner. I hardly know you. No woman was ever more loved by  her husband or received more devotion."    
Betsey almost relented, he looked so miserable. But she replied firmly:  "There is one condition I have a right to make. If you agree to it, I  will consider if I can bring myself to believe your denial and your  protestations. It is that you never enter Mrs. Croix's house again, nor  see her willingly."    
Hamilton knew what the promise would mean, but his mind worked with the  rapidity of lightning in great crises, and never erred. He replied  promptly:    
"I will see her once, and once only--to give her a decent reason for not  calling again--that I understand I am compromising her good name, or  something of the sort. I have accepted too much hospitality at her hands  to drop her brusquely, without a word of explanation."    
"You can write her a letter. You can merely send polite excuses when she  invites you. You are very busy. You have every excuse. Gradually, she  will think no more about you--if it be true that she is nothing to you.  You have your choice, sir! Either your promise, or I return by the next  packet to Albany."    
But Hamilton, always considerate of women, and despising the weakness  and brutality which permits a man to slink out of an amour, would not  retreat, and Betsey finally settled herself in her chair, and said, with  unmistakable determination:--    
"Very well, go now. I shall not move from this room--this chair--until  you return."    
Hamilton caught his hat and left the house. Although he was possessed by  the one absorbing desire to win back his wife, who had never been so  dear as to-day, when for the first time she had placed him at arm's  length and given him a thorough fright, still his brain, accustomed to  see all sides of every question at once, and far into the future, spoke  plainly of the hour when he would regret the loss of Mrs. Croix. He  might forget her for weeks at a time, but he always reawakened to a  sense of her being with a glowing impression that the world was more  alive and fair. The secret romance had been very dear and pleasant. The  end was come, however, and he was eager to pass it.    
His eye was attracted to a chemist's window, and entering the shop  hastily, he purchased a bottle of smelling salts. The act reminded him  of Mrs. Mitchell, and that he had not heard from her for several months.  He resolved to write that night, and permitted his mind to wander to the  green Island which was almost lost among his memories. The respite was  brief, however.    
To his relief he found Mrs. Croix in her intellectual habit. The lady,  who was reading in the door of her boudoir above the garden steps,  exclaimed, without formal greeting:--    
"I am transported, sir. Such descriptions never were written before.  Listen!"    
Hamilton, who hated descriptions of scenery at any time, and was in his  most direct and imperative temper, stood the infliction but a moment,  then asked her attention. She closed the book over her finger and smiled  charmingly.    
"Forgive me for boring you," she said graciously. "But you know my  passion for letters; and if truth must be told, I am a little piqued. I  have not laid eyes on you for a fortnight. Not but that I am used to  your lapses of memory by this time," she added, with a sigh.    
Hamilton went straight to the point. He told her the exact reason for  the necessary breach, omitting nothing but the episode of Mrs. Reynolds;  one cause of reproach was as much as a man could be expected to furnish  an angry woman.    
For Mrs. Croix was very angry. At first she had pressed her hand against  her heart as if about to faint, and Hamilton had hastily extracted the  salts; but the next moment she was on her feet, towering and expanding  like an avenging queen about to order in her slaves with scimitars and  chargers.    
"Do you mean," she cried, "that I am flouted, flung aside like an old  cravat? I? With half the men in America in love with me? Good God, sir!  I have known from the beginning that you would tire, but I thought to be  on the watch and save my pride. How dare you come like this? Why could  you not give me warning? It is an outrage. I would rather you had killed  me."    
"I am sorry I have blundered," said Hamilton, humbly. "But how in  Heaven's name can a man know how a woman will take anything? I had such  respect for your great intelligence that I thought it due you to treat  you as I would a man--"    
"A man?" exclaimed Mrs. Croix. "Treat me like a man! Of all the  supremely silly things I ever heard one of your sex say, that is the  silliest. I am not a man, and you know it."    
Hamilton hastened to assure her that she was deliberately averting her  intelligence from his true meaning. "You have never doubted my sincerity  for a moment," he added. "You surely know what it will cost me never to  see you again. There is but one cause under heaven that could have  brought me to you with this decision. You may believe in my regret--to  use a plain word--when you reflect upon all that you have been to me."    
He was desperately afraid that her anger would dissolve in tears, and he  be placed in a position from which he was not sure of emerging with a  clear conscience,--and he dared take home nothing less. But Mrs. Croix,  however she might feel on the morrow, was too outraged in her pride and  vanity to be susceptible either to grief or the passion of love. She  stormed up and down the room in increasing fury, her eyes flashing blue  lightning, her strong hands smashing whatever costly offering they  encountered. "Wives! Wives! Wives!" she screamed. "The little fools!  What are wives for but to keep house and bring up babies? They are a  class apart. I have suffered enough from their impertinent interference.  Am I not a woman apart? Will you assert that there is a 'wife' in  America who can hold her own with me for a moment in anything? Was I not  created to reveal to men--and only the ablest, for I waste no time on  fools--the very sublimation of my sex--a companionship they will find  in no silly little fool, stupid with domesticity? Am I to submit, then,  to be baulked by a sex I despise--and in the greatest passion that ever  possessed a woman?" She stopped and laughed, bringing her lashes  together and moving forward her beautiful lips. "What a fool I am!" she  said. "You will come back when the humour seizes you. I had forgot that  your family returned to-day. You are in your most domestic mood--and I  have been inflicted with that before. But there will come an hour when  neither your wife nor any other mortal power will keep you away from me.  Is it not true?"    
Hamilton had turned pale; his ready imagination had responded with a  presentiment of many desperate struggles. He rose, and took her hand  forcibly.    
"No," he said. "I shall not return. Believe me, that is the hardest  sentence I have ever pronounced upon myself. And forgive me if I have  been rude and inconsiderate. It was the result of the desire to have the  agony over as quickly as possible. I should have found the anticipation  unbearable, and I do not believe it would have been more soothing to  you. There is no reason why your pride should be wounded, for this is  not the result of satiety on my part, but of an imperative necessity.  Shake hands with me."    
She wrenched her hand free and, seizing a vase, flung it into a mirror.  Hamilton retreated.
