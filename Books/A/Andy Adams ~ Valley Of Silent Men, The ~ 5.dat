  The latch moved slowly, and with its movement came a gentle tap on   the panel. 
  &quot;Come in,&quot; he said. 
  The next instant he was staring. The girl had entered and closed   the door behind her. O'Connor's picture stood in flesh and blood   before him. The girl's eyes met his own. They were like glorious   violets, as O'Connor had said, but they were not the eyes he had   expected to see. They were the wide-open, curious eyes of a child.  He  had visualized them as pools of slumbering flame&#8212;the idea  O'Connor  had given him&#8212;and they were the opposite of that. Their  one emotion  seemed to be the emotion roused by an overwhelming,  questioning  curiosity. They were apparently not regarding him as a  dying human  being, but as a creature immensely interesting to look  upon. In place  of the gratitude he had anticipated, they were  filled with a great,  wondering interrogation, and there was not  the slightest hint of  embarrassment in their gaze. For a space it  seemed to Kent that he saw  nothing but those wonderful,  dispassionate eyes looking at him. Then  he saw the rest of her&#8212;  her amazing hair, her pale, exquisite face,  the slimness and  beauty of her as she stood with her back to the door,  one hand  still resting on the latch. He had never seen anything quite  like  her. He might have guessed that she was eighteen, or twenty, or   twenty-two. Her hair, wreathed in shimmering, velvety coils from  the  back to the crown of her head, struck him as it had struck  O'Connor,  as unbelievable. The glory of it gave to her an  appearance of height  which she did not possess, for she was not  tall, and her slimness  added to the illusion. 
  And then, greatly to his embarrassment in the next instant, his   eyes went to her feet. Again O'Connor was right&#8212;tiny feet, high-   heeled pumps, ravishingly turned ankles showing under a skirt of  some  fluffy brown stuff or other&#8212; 
  Correcting himself, his face flushed red. The faintest tremble of   a smile was on the girl's lips. She looked down, and for the first   time he saw what O'Connor had seen, the sunlight kindling  slumberous  fires in her hair. 
  Kent tried to say something, but before he succeeded she had taken   possession of the chair near his bedside. 
  &quot;I have been waiting a long time to see you,&quot; she said. &quot;You are   James Kent, aren't you?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I'm Jim Kent. I'm sorry Dr. Cardigan kept you waiting. If I   had known&#8212;&quot; 
  He was getting a grip on himself again, and smiled at her. He   noticed the amazing length of her dark lashes, but the violet eyes   behind them did not smile back at him. The tranquillity of their  gaze  was disconcerting. It was as if she had not quite made up her  mind  about him yet and was still trying to classify him in the  museum of  things she had known. 
  &quot;He should have awakened me,&quot; Kent went on, trying to keep himself   from slipping once more. &quot;It isn't polite to keep a young lady   waiting two hours!&quot; 
  This time the blue eyes made him feel that his smile was a maudlin   grin. 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;you are different.&quot; She spoke softly, as if expressing the   thought to herself. &quot;That is what I came to find out, if you were   different. You are dying?&quot; 
  &quot;My God&#8212;yes&#8212;I'm dying!&quot; gasped Kent. &quot;According to Dr. Cardigan   I'm due to pop off this minute. Aren't you a little nervous,  sitting  so near to a man who's ready to explode while you're  looking at him?&quot; 
  For the first time the eyes changed. She was not facing the   window, yet a glow like the glow of sunlight flashed into them,  soft,  luminous, almost laughing. 
  &quot;No, it doesn't frighten me,&quot; she assured him. &quot;I have always   thought I should like to see a man die&#8212;not quickly, like drowning  or  being shot, but slowly, an inch at a time. But I shouldn't like  to see  YOU die.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm glad,&quot; breathed Kent. &quot;It's a great satisfaction to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Yet I shouldn't be frightened if you did.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh!&quot; 
  Kent drew himself up straighter against his pillows. He had been a   man of many adventures. He had faced almost every conceivable kind  of  shock. But this was a new one. He stared into the blue eyes,   tongueless and mentally dazed. They were cool and sweet and not at   all excited. And he knew that she spoke the truth. Not by a quiver  of  those lovely lashes would she betray either fear or horror if  he  popped off right there. It was astonishing. 
  Something like resentment shot for an instant into his bewildered   brain. Then it was gone, and in a flash it came upon him that she  was  but uttering his own philosophy of life, showing him life's  cheapness,  life's littleness, the absurdity of being distressed by  looking upon  the light as it flickered out. And she was doing it,  not as a  philosopher, but with the beautiful unconcern of a child. 
  Suddenly, as if impelled by an emotion in direct contradiction to   her apparent lack of sympathy, she reached out a hand and placed  it  on Kent's forehead. It was another shock. It was not a  professional  touch, but a soft, cool little pressure that sent a  comforting thrill  through him. The hand was there for only a  moment, and she withdrew it  to entwine the slim fingers with those  of the others in her lap. 
  &quot;You have no fever,&quot; she said. &quot;What makes you think you are   dying?&quot; 
  Kent explained what was happening inside him. He was completely   shunted off his original track of thought and anticipation. He had   expected to ask for at least a mutual introduction when his  visitor  came into his room, and had anticipated taking upon  himself the  position of a polite inquisitor. In spite of O'Connor,  he had not  thought she would be quite so pretty. He had not  believed her eyes  would be so beautiful, or their lashes so long,  or the touch of her  hand so pleasantly unnerving. And now, in  place of asking for her name  and the reason for her visit, he  became an irrational idiot,  explaining to her certain matters of  physiology that had to do with  aortas and aneurismal sacs. He had  finished before the absurdity of  the situation dawned upon him,  and with absurdity came the humor of  it. Even dying, Kent could  not fail to see the funny side of a thing  It struck him as  suddenly as had the girl's beauty and her bewildering  and  unaffected ingenuousness. 
  Looking at him, that same glow of mysterious questioning in her   eyes, the girl found him suddenly laughing straight into her face. 
  &quot;This is funny. It's very funny, Miss&#8212;Miss&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Marette,&quot; she supplied, answering his hesitation. 
  &quot;It's funny, Miss Marette.&quot; 
  &quot;Not Miss Marette. Just Marette,&quot; she corrected. 
  &quot;I say, it's funny,&quot; he tried again. &quot;You see, it's not so   terribly pleasant as you might think to&#8212;er&#8212;be here, where I am,   dying. And last night I thought about the finest thing in the  world  would be to have a woman beside me, a woman who'd be sort of   sympathetic, you know, ease the thing off a little, maybe say she  was  sorry. And then the Lord answers my prayer, and YOU come&#8212;and  you sort  of give me the impression that you made the appointment  with yourself  to see how a fellow looks when he pops off.&quot; 
  The shimmer of light came into the blue eyes again. She seemed to   have done with her mental analysis of him, and he saw that a bit  of  color was creeping into her cheeks, pale when she had entered  the  room. 
  &quot;You wouldn't be the first I've seen pop off,&quot; she assured him.   &quot;There have been a number, and I've never cried very much. I'd  rather  see a man die than some animals. But I shouldn't like to  see YOU do  it. Does that comfort you&#8212;like the woman you prayed  the Lord for?&quot; 
  &quot;It does,&quot; gasped Kent. &quot;But why the devil, Miss Marette&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Marette,&quot; she corrected again. 
  &quot;Yes, Marette&#8212;why the devil have you come to see me at just the   moment I'm due to explode? And what's your other name, and how old   are you, and what do you want of me?&quot; 
  &quot;I haven't any other name, I'm twenty, and I came to get   acquainted with you and see what you are like.&quot; 
  &quot;Bully!&quot; exclaimed Kent. &quot;We're getting there fast! And now, why?&quot; 
  The girl drew her chair a few inches nearer, and for a moment Kent   thought that her lovely mouth was trembling on the edge of a  smile. 
  &quot;Because you have lied so splendidly to save another man who was   about to die.&quot; 
  &quot;Et tu, Brute!&quot; sighed Kent, leaning back against his pillows.   &quot;Isn't it possible for a decent man to kill another man and not be   called a liar when he tells about it? Why do so many believe that  I  lie?&quot; 
  &quot;They don't,&quot; said the girl. &quot;They believe you&#8212;now. You have gone   so completely into the details of the murder in your confession  that  they are quite convinced. It would be too bad if you lived,  for you  surely would be hanged. Your lie sounds and reads like the  truth. But  I know it is a lie. You did not kill John Barkley.&quot; 
  &quot;And the reason for your suspicion?&quot; 
  For fully half a minute the girl's eyes rested on, his own. Again   they seemed to be looking through him and into him. &quot;Because I  know  the man who DID kill him,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and it was not  you.&quot; 
  Kent made a mighty effort to appear calm. He reached for a cigar   from the box that Cardigan had placed on his bed, and nibbled the  end  of it. &quot;Has some one else been confessing?&quot; he asked. 
  She shook her head the slightest bit. 
  &quot;Did you&#8212;er&#8212;see this other gentleman kill John Barkley?&quot; he   insisted. 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I must answer you as I have answered at least one other. I   killed John Barkley. If you suspect some other person, your  suspicion  is wrong.&quot; 
  &quot;What a splendid liar!&quot; she breathed softly. &quot;Don't you believe in   God?&quot; 
  Kent winced. &quot;In a large, embracing sense, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I   believe in Him, for instance, as revealed to our senses in all  that  living, growing glory you see out there through the window  Nature and  I have become pretty good pals, and you see I've sort  of built up a  mother goddess to worship instead of a he-god.  Sacrilege, maybe, but  it's a great comfort at times. But you  didn't come to talk religion?&quot; 
  The lovely head bent still nearer him. He felt an impelling desire   to put up his hand and touch her shining hair, as she laid her  hand  on his forehead. 
  &quot;I know who killed John Barkley,&quot; she insisted. &quot;I know how and   when and why he was killed. Please tell me the truth. I want to  know.  Why did you confess to a crime which you did not commit?&quot; 
  Kent took time to light his cigar. The girl watched him closely,   almost eagerly. 
  &quot;I may be mad,&quot; he said. &quot;It is possible for any human being to be   mad and not know it. That's the funny part about insanity. But if  I'm  not insane, I killed Barkley; if I didn't kill him, I must be  insane,  for I'm very well convinced that I did. Either that, or  you are  insane. I have my suspicions that you. are. Would a sane  person wear  pumps with heels like those up here?&quot; He pointed  accusingly to the  floor. 
  For the first time the girl smiled, openly, frankly, gloriously.   It was as if her heart had leaped forth for an instant and had   greeted him. And then, like sunlight shadowed by cloud, the smile  was  gone. &quot;You are a brave man,&quot; she said. &quot;You are splendid. I  hate men.  But I think if you lived very long, I should love you. I  will believe  that you killed Barkley. You compel me to believe it.  You confessed,  when you found you were going to die, that an  innocent man might be  saved. Wasn't that it?&quot; 
  Kent nodded weakly. &quot;That's it. I hate to think of it that way,   but I guess it's true. I confessed because I knew I was going to  die.  Otherwise I am quite sure that I should have let the other  fellow take  my medicine for me. You must think I am a beast.&quot; 
  &quot;All men are beasts,&quot; she agreed quickly. &quot;But you are&#8212;a   different kind of beast. I like you. If there were a chance, I  might  fight for you. I can fight.&quot; She held up her two small  hands, half  smiling at him again. 
  &quot;But not with those,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I think you would fight with   your eyes. O'Connor told me they half killed Kedsty when you met  them  in the poplar grove yesterday.&quot; 
  He had expected that the mention of Inspector Kedsty's name would   disturb her. It had no effect that he could perceive. 
  &quot;O'Connor was the big, red-faced man with Mr. Kedsty?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, my trail partner. He came to me yesterday and raved about   your eyes. They ARE beautiful; I've never seen eyes half so  lovely.  But that wasn't what struck Bucky so hard. It was the  effect they had  on Kedsty. He said they shattered every nerve in  Kedsty's body, and  Kedsty isn't the sort to get easily frightened.  And the queer part of  it was that the instant you had gone, he  gave O'Connor an order to  free McTrigger&#8212;and then turned and  followed you. All the rest of that  day O'Connor tried to discover  something about you at the Landing. He  couldn't find hide nor  hair&#8212;I beg pardon!&#8212;I mean he couldn't find  out anything about  you at all. We made up our minds that for some  reason or other you  were hiding up at Kedsty's bungalow. You don't  mind a fellow  saying all this&#8212;when he is going to pop off soon&#8212;do  you?&quot; 
  He was half frightened at the directness with which he had   expressed the thing. He would gladly have buried his own curiosity   and all of O'Connor's suspicions for another moment of her hand on   his forehead. But it was out, and he waited. 
  She was looking down, her fingers twisting some sort of tasseled   dress ornament in her lap, and Kent mentally measured the length  of  her lashes with a foot rule in mind. They were superb, and in  the  thrill of his admiration he would have sworn they were an inch  long.  She looked up suddenly and caught the glow in his eyes and  the flush  that lay under the tan of his cheeks. Her own color had  deepened a  little. 
  &quot;What if you shouldn't die?&quot; she asked him bluntly, as if she had   not heard a word of all he had said about Kedsty. &quot;What would you   do?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm going to.&quot; 
  &quot;But if you shouldn't?&quot; 
  Kent shrugged his shoulders. &quot;I suppose I'd have to take my   medicine. You're not going?&quot; 
  She had straightened up and was sitting on the edge of her chair.   &quot;Yes, I'm going. I'm afraid of my eyes. I may look at you as I  looked  at Mr. Kedsty, and then&#8212;pop you'd go, quick! And I don't  want to be  here when you die!&quot; 
  He heard a soft little note of laughter in her throat. It sent a   chill through him. What an adorable, blood-thirsty little wretch  she  was! He stared at her bent head, at the shining coils of her  wonderful  hair. Undone, he could see it completely hiding her. And  it was so  soft and warm that again he was tempted to reach out and  touch it. She  was wonderful, and yet it was not possible that she  had a heart. Her  apparent disregard of the fact that he was a  dying man was almost  diabolic. There was no sympathy in the  expression of her violet eyes  as she looked at him. She was even  making fun of the fact that he was  about to die! 
  She stood up, surveying for the first time the room in which she   had been sitting. Then she turned to the window and looked out.  She  reminded Kent of a beautiful young willow that had grown at  the edge  of a stream, exquisite, slender, strong. He could have  picked her up  in his arms as easily as a child, yet he sensed in  the lithe beauty of  her body forces that could endure  magnificently. The careless poise of  her head fascinated him. For  that head and the hair that crowned it he  knew that half the women  of the earth would have traded precious years  of their lives. 
  And then, without turning toward him, she said, &quot;Some day, when I   die, I wish I might have as pleasant a room as this.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope you never die,&quot; he replied devoutly. 
  She came back and stood for a moment beside him. 
  &quot;I have had a very pleasant time,&quot; she said, as though he had   given her a special sort of entertainment. &quot;It's too bad you are   going to die. I'm sure we should have been good friends. Aren't  you?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, very sure. If you had only arrived sooner&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And I shall always think of you as a different kind of man-   beast,&quot; she interrupted him. &quot;It is really true that I shouldn't  like  to see you die. I want to get away before it happens. Would  you care  to have me kiss you?&quot; 
  For an instant Kent felt that his aorta was about to give away.   &quot;I&#8212;I would,&quot; he gasped huskily. 
  &quot;Then&#8212;close your eyes, please.&quot; 
  He obeyed. She bent over him. He felt the soft touch of her hands   and caught for an instant the perfume of her face and hair, and  then  the thrill of her lips pressed warm and soft upon his. 
  She was not flushed or embarrassed when he looked at her again. It   was as if she had kissed a baby and was wondering at its red face.   &quot;I've only kissed three men before you,&quot; she avowed. &quot;It is  strange.  I never thought I should do it again. And now, good-by!&quot;  She moved  quickly to the door. 
  &quot;Wait,&quot; he cried plaintively. &quot;Please wait. I want to know your   name. It is Marette&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Radisson,&quot; she finished for him. &quot;Marette Radisson, and I come   from away off there, from a place we call the Valley of Silent  Men.&quot;  She was pointing into the north. 
  &quot;The North!&quot; he exclaimed. 
  &quot;Yes, it is far north. Very far.&quot; 
  Her hand was on the latch. The door opened slowly. 
  &quot;Wait,&quot; he pleaded again. &quot;You must not go.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I must go. I have remained too long. I am sorry I kissed   you. I shouldn't have done that. But I had to because you are such  a  splendid liar!&quot; 
  The door opened quickly and closed behind her. He heard her steps   almost running down the hall, where not long ago he had listened  to  the last of O'Connor's. 
  And then there was silence, and in that silence he heard her words   again, drumming like little hammers in his head, &quot;BECAUSE YOU ARE   SUCH A SPLENDID LIAR!&quot;
