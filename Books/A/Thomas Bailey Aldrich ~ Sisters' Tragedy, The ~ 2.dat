<b>1851-1870</b> 
<b>I</b> 
Now there was one who came in later days<br> To play at Emperor: in the dead of night<br> Stole crown and sceptre, and stood forth to light<br> In sudden purple. The dawn's straggling rays<br> Showed Paris fettered, murmuring in amaze,<br> With red hands at her throat--a piteous sight.<br> Then the new Caesar, stricken with affright<br> At his own daring, shrunk from public gaze 
In the Elysee, and had lost the day<br> But that around him flocked his birds of prey,<br> Sharp-beaked, voracious, hungry for the deed.<br> 'Twixt hope and fear behold great Caesar hang!<br> Meanwhile, methinks, a ghostly laughter rang<br> Through the rotunda of the Invalides. 
<b>II</b> 
What if the boulevards, at set of sun,<br> Reddened, but not with sunset's kindly glow?<br> What if from quai and square the murmured woe<br> Swept heavenward, pleadingly? The prize was won,<br> A kingling made and Liberty undone.<br> No Emperor, this, like him awhile ago,<br> But his Name's shadow; that one struck the blow<br> Himself, and sighted the street-sweeping gun! 
This was a man of tortuous heart and brain,<br> So warped he knew not his own point of view--<br> The master of a dark, mysterious smile. 
And there he plotted, by the storied Seine<br> And in the fairy gardens of St. Cloud,<br> The Sphinx that puzzled Europe, for awhile.

I see him as men saw him once--a face<br> Of true Napoleon pallor; round the eyes<br> The wrinkled care; mustache spread pinion-wise,<br> Pointing his smile with odd sardonic grace<br> As wearily he turns him in his place,<br> And bends before the hoarse Parisian cries--<br> Then vanishes, with glitter of gold-lace<br> And trumpets blaring to the patient skies. 
Not thus he vanished later! On his path<br> The Furies waited for the hour and man,<br> Foreknowing that they waited not in vain. 
Then fell the day, O day of dreadful wrath!<br> Bow down in shame, O crimson-girt Sedan!<br> Weep, fair Alsace! weep, loveliest Lorraine! 
So mused I, sitting underneath the trees<br> In that old garden of the Tuileries,<br> Watching the dust of twilight sifting down<br> Through chestnut boughs just toucht with autumn's brown--<br> Not twilight yet, but that illusive bloom<br> Which holds before the deep-etched shadows come;<br> For still the garden stood in golden mist,<br> Still, like a river of molten amethyst,<br> The Seine slipt through its spans of fretted stone,<br> And, near the grille that once fenced in a throne,<br> The fountains still unbraided to the day<br> The unsubstantial silver of their spray. 
A spot to dream in, love in, waste one's hours!<br> Temples and palaces, and gilded towers,<br> And fairy terraces!--and yet, and yet<br> Here in her woe came Marie Antoinette,<br> Came sweet Corday, Du Barry with shrill cry,<br> Not learning from her betters how to die!<br> Here, while the Nations watched with bated breath,<br> Was held the saturnalia of Red Death!<br> For where that slim Egyptian shaft uplifts<br> Its point to catch the dawn's and sunset's drifts<br> Of various gold, the busy Headsman stood. . . .<br> Place de la Concorde--no, the Place of Blood! 
And all so peaceful now! One cannot bring<br> Imagination to accept the thing.<br> Lies, all of it! some dreamer's wild romance--<br> High-hearted, witty, laughter-loving France!<br> In whose brain was it that the legend grew<br> Of Maenads shrieking in this avenue,<br> Of watch-fires burning, Famine standing guard,<br> Of long-speared Uhlans in that palace-yard!<br> What ruder sound this soft air ever smote<br> Than a bird's twitter or a bugle's note?<br> What darker crimson ever splashed these walks<br> Than that of rose-leaves dropping from the stalks?<br> And yet--what means that charred and broken wall,<br> That sculptured marble, splintered, like to fall,<br> Looming among the trees there? . . . And you say<br> This happened, as it were, but yesterday?<br> And here the Commune stretched a barricade,<br> And there the final desperate stand was made?<br> Such things have been? How all things change and fade!<br> How little lasts in this brave world below!<br> Love dies; hate cools; the Caesars come and go;<br> Gaunt Hunter fattens, and the weak grow strong.<br> Even Republics are not here for long! 
Ah, who can tell what hour may bring the doom,<br> The lighted torch, the tocsin's heavy boom!
