"It is just a year ago to-day, Betty, that you nearly killed me by  announcing your determination to go into politics--or whatever you  choose to call it. I put down the date. A great deal has happened  since then--poor dear Jack! And I often think of that unfortunate  creature, too. But you and I are here in this same room, and I wonder  if you are glad or sorry that you entered upon this eccentric course."    
"I have no regrets," said Betty, smiling. "And I don't think you have.  You like every man that comes here, and while they are talking to you  forget that you ever had an ache. As for me--no, I have no regrets,  not one. I am glad."    
"Well, I will admit that they are much better than I thought. I must  say I never saw a finer set of men than those at your dinner, and I  felt proud of my country, although I was nervous once or twice. I  almost love Mr. Burleigh; so I refrain from further criticism. But,  Betty, there is one thing I feel I must say--"    
She hesitated and readjusted her cushions nervously. Betty looked at  her inquiringly, and experienced a slight chill. She stood up suddenly  and put her foot on the fender.    
"It is this," continued Mrs. Madison, hurriedly. "I think you are too  much with Senator North. He was here constantly before you left  Washington, and of course I know you boated with him a great deal last  summer. Since your return he has been here several times, and you  treat him with twice the attention with which you treat any other man.  Of course I can understand the attraction which a man with a brain  like that must have for you, but there is something more important  to be considered. You have been the most noticeable girl in Washington  for years--in our set--and now that you have branched out in this  extraordinary manner and are even going to have a <i>salon</i>, you'll  quickly be the most conspicuous in the other set. Mr. North is easily  the most conspicuous figure in the Senate--a half dozen of your new  friends, including that Speaker, have told me so--and if this  friendship keeps on people will talk, as sure as fate. There is no  harm done yet--I sounded Sally Carter--but there will be. That sort of  gossip grows gradually and surely; it is not like a great scandal that  blazes up and out and that people get tired of; they will get into the  habit of believing all sorts of dreadful things, and they never will  acquire the habit of disbelieving them."    
Betty made no reply. She stood staring into the fire.    
"It would have been more difficult for me to say such a thing to you a  year ago; but you seem a good deal older, somehow. I suppose it is  being so much with men old enough to be your father, and talking  constantly about things that give me the nightmare to think of. And of  course you have had two terrible shocks. But you are so buoyant I hope  you will get over all that in time. Wouldn't you like to go to the  Riviera, and then to London for the season?"    
"And desert my <i>salon?</i>" asked Betty, lightly. "You forget this is the  long term. I am praying that summer will come late, so that you can  stay on. It never had occurred to me that any one would notice my  friendship with Mr. North. I hope they will do nothing so silly as to  comment on it."    
"Well, they will, if you are not very careful. And there is no  position in the world so unenviable as that of a girl who gets herself  talked about with a married man. Men lose interest in her and raise  their eyebrows at the clubs when her name is mentioned, and women  gradually drop her. Money and position will cover up a good many  indiscretions in a married woman or a widow, but the world always has  demanded that a girl shall be immaculate; and if she permits Society  to think she is not, it punishes her for violating one of its pet  standards. Mr. North can be nothing to you. The day is sure to come  when you will want to marry. No woman is really satisfied in any other  state."    
Betty turned and looked squarely at her mother, who had lost even the  semblance of nervousness in her deep maternal anxiety.    
"Do you believe that I love Mr. North?"    
"Yes, I do. And I know that he loves you. There is no mistaking the  way a man turns to a woman every time she begins to speak. But on that  score I have no fears. I know that you not only must have the high  principles of the women of your race, but that you are too much a  woman-of-the-world to enter upon a <i>liaison</i>, which would mean  constant lying, fear, blackmail by servants, and general wretchedness.  And I have perfect faith in him. Even a scoundrel will hesitate a long  while before he makes himself responsible for the future of a girl in  your position, and Mr. North is not a scoundrel but an honourable  gentleman. Moreover he knows that a scandal would ruin him in his  Puritanical State; and he adores his sons, who are prouder of him than  if he were ten Presidents. But the world can talk and continue to  talk, and to act as viciously about an imprudent friendship as about a  <i>liaison</i>, for it has no means of proving anything and likes to  believe the worst. Now, I shan't say any more. You are capable of  doing your own thinking. Only do think--please." Betty nodded to  her mother, and went to her boudoir and sat there for hours. Nothing  could have put the ugly practical side of her romance so precisely  before her as her mother's black and white statement, full of the  little colloquial phrases with which an un-ambitious world expresses  itself. Even for him, Betty reflected, she could not endure vulgar  gossip, and wondered how any high-bred woman could for any man.    
"For what else does civilization mean," she thought, "if those of us  that have its highest advantages are not wiser and more fastidious  than the mob? And unless a woman is ready to go and live in a cave,  she cannot be happy in the loss of the world's regard, for it can make  her uncomfortable in quite a thousand little ways. Expediency is the  root of all morality. It is stupid to be unmoral, and that is the long  and the short of it. I would marry him to-morrow if I had to cook for  him, if he were dishonoured by his country, if he were smitten  suddenly with ill-health and never could walk again. I am willing to  go through life alone for his sake, even without seeing him, and after  he is dead and gone. I love him absolutely, and if there is another  world I must meet him there. But I am not willing to become a social  pariah on his account."    
She never had permitted her mind to linger on the practical aspect of  a different relationship, to admit that such a chapter was possible  outside of her imagination, but she did so now, deliberately. She knew  that what her mother had intimated was true, that the happiness to be  got out of it would amount to very little, and that the day would come  when she would say that it was not worth the price. There were many  times when she was not capable of reasoning coldly on this question,  but she had been listening for two hours to Senator French on the  restriction of immigration, and felt all intellect.    
Her mind turned to Harriet. There was a creature foredoomed to  destruction by the forces within her, struggling in vain, assisted and  guarded in vain. Should she, with her inheritance of kindly forces  within and without, deliberately readjust her manifest lines into a  likeness of Harriet Walker's? And she knew that even if she hoodwinked  the world, the miserable deception of it all, the nervous terrors, not  only would wear love down, but shatter her ideals of herself and him.  She would be infinitely more miserable than now.    
It relieved her to have thought that phase out, and she put it aside.  But the other? Must she give him up? What pleasure could she find in  sitting here with him if her mother's apprehensive mind did not leave  the room for a moment? What pleasure if a vulgar world were  whispering? She reflected with some bitterness that one danger was  receding. He had not entered this room since the day of her return.  Although he had called several times, he had come in the evening, when  she always sat with her mother, or in the morning, when Mrs. Madison  again was sure to be present. She knew that he dared not come here,  and that it was more than likely he never would call at the old hour  again.    
She realized these two facts suddenly and vividly; her mind worked  with a brutal frankness at times. She began to cry heavily, the tears  raining on her intellectual mood and obliterating it. If she were not  to see him alone again, she might as well ask him to come to the house  on Thursday evenings only, and to show her no attention in public; if  she could not have the old hours again, she wanted nothing less. And  she wanted them passionately; those hours came back to her with a  poignancy of happiness in memory that the present had not revealed,  and the thought that they had gone for ever filled her with a  suffocating anguish that was as complete as it was sudden. She  implored him under her breath to come to her, then prayed that he  would not....    
She became conscious that she was in a mood to take any step, were he  here, rather than lose him; and the mood terrified her. Would the time  come when this intolerable pain would kill every inheritance in her  brain, its empire the more absolute because it made passion itself  insignificant in the more terrible want of the heart? If it did, she  would marry Burleigh. She made up her mind instantly. She would fight  as long as she could, for she passionately desired to live her life  alone with the idea of this man; but if she were not strong enough,  she would marry and bury herself in the West. Nothing but an  irrevocable step would affect a permanent mental attitude, and  Burleigh would give her little time for thought.
