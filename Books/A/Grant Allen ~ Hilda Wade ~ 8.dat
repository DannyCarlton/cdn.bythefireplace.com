Hilda took me back with her to the embryo farm where she had  pitched her tent for the moment; a rough, wild place. It lay close  to the main road from Salisbury to Chimoio.    
Setting aside the inevitable rawness and newness of all things  Rhodesian, however, the situation itself was not wholly  unpicturesque. A ramping rock or tor of granite, which I should  judge at a rough guess to extend to an acre in size, sprang  abruptly from the brown grass of the upland plain. It rose like a  huge boulder. Its summit was crowned by the covered grave of some  old Kaffir chief--a rude cairn of big stones under a thatched  awning. At the foot of this jagged and cleft rock the farmhouse  nestled--four square walls of wattle-and-daub, sheltered by its  mass from the sweeping winds of the South African plateau. A  stream brought water from a spring close by: in front of the house--  rare sight in that thirsty land--spread a garden of flowers. It  was an oasis in the desert. But the desert itself stretched grimly  all round. I could never quite decide how far the oasis was caused  by the water from the spring, and how far by Hilda's presence.    
"Then you live here?" I cried, gazing round--my voice, I suppose,  betraying my latent sense of the unworthiness of the position.    
"For the present," Hilda answered, smiling. "You know, Hubert, I  have no abiding city anywhere, till my Purpose is fulfilled. I  came here because Rhodesia seemed the farthest spot on earth where  a white woman just now could safely penetrate--in order to get away  from you and Sebastian."    
"That is an unkind conjunction!" I exclaimed, reddening.    
"But I mean it," she answered, with a wayward little nod. "I  wanted breathing-space to form fresh plans. I wanted to get clear  away for a time from all who knew me. And this promised best. . . .  But nowadays, really, one is never safe from intrusion anywhere."    
"You are cruel, Hilda!"    
"Oh, no. You deserve it. I asked you not to come--and you came in  spite of me. I have treated you very nicely under the circumstances,  I think. I have behaved like an angel. The question is now, what  ought I to do next? You have upset my plans so."    
"Upset your plans? How?"    
"Dear Hubert,"--she turned to me with an indulgent smile,--"for a  clever man, you are really <i>too</i> foolish! Can't you see that you  have betrayed my whereabouts to Sebastian? <i>I</i> crept away  secretly, like a thief in the night, giving no name or place; and,  having the world to ransack, he might have found it hard to track  me; for <i>he</i> had not <i>your</i> clue of the Basingstoke letter--nor your  reason for seeking me. But now that <i>you</i> have followed me openly,  with your name blazoned forth in the company's passenger-lists, and  your traces left plain in hotels and stages across the map of South  Africa--why, the spoor is easy. If Sebastian cares to find us, he  can follow the scent all through without trouble."    
"I never thought of that!" I cried, aghast.    
She was forbearance itself. "No, I knew you would never think of  it. You are a man, you see. I counted that in. I was afraid from  the first you would wreck all by following me."    
I was mutely penitent. "And yet, you forgive me, Hilda?"    
Her eyes beamed tenderness. "To know all, is to forgive all," she  answered. "I have to remind you of that so often! How can I help  forgiving, when I know <i>why</i> you came--what spur it was that drove  you? But it is the future we have to think of now, not the past.  And I must wait and reflect. I have <i>no</i> plan just at present."    
"What are you doing at this farm?" I gazed round at it,  dissatisfied.    
"I board here," Hilda answered, amused at my crestfallen face.  "But, of course, I cannot be idle; so I have found work to do. I  ride out on my bicycle to two or three isolated houses about, and  give lessons to children in this desolate place, who would  otherwise grow up ignorant. It fills my time, and supplies me with  something besides myself to think about."    
"And what am <i>I</i> to do?" I cried, oppressed with a sudden sense of  helplessness.    
She laughed at me outright. "And is this the first moment that  that difficulty has occurred to you?" she asked, gaily. "You have  hurried all the way from London to Rhodesia without the slightest  idea of what you mean to do now you have got here?"    
I laughed at myself in turn. "Upon my word, Hilda," I cried, "I  set out to find you. Beyond the desire to find you, I had no plan  in my head. That was an end in itself. My thoughts went no  farther."    
She gazed at me half saucily. "Then don't you think, sir, the best  thing you can do, now you <i>have</i> found me, is--to turn back and go  home again?"    
"I am a man," I said, promptly, taking a firm stand. "And you are  a judge of character. If you really mean to tell me you think <i>that</i>  likely--well, I shall have a lower opinion of your insight into men  than I have been accustomed to harbour."    
Her smile was not wholly without a touch of triumph.    
"In that case," she went on, "I suppose the only alternative is for  you to remain here."    
"That would appear to be logic," I replied. "But what can I do?  Set up in practice?"    
"I don't see much opening," she answered. "If you ask my advice, I  should say there is only one thing to be done in Rhodesia just now--  turn farmer."    
"It <i>is</i> done," I answered, with my usual impetuosity. "Since <i>you</i>  say the word, I am a farmer already. I feel an interest in oats  that is simply absorbing. What steps ought I to take first in my  present condition?"    
She looked at me, all brown with the dust of my long ride. "I  would suggest," she said slowly, "a good wash, and some dinner."    
"Hilda," I cried, surveying my boots, or what was visible of them,  "that is <i>really</i> clever of you. A wash and some dinner! So  practical, so timely! The very thing! I will see to it."    
Before night fell, I had arranged everything. I was to buy the  next farm from the owner of the one where Hilda lodged; I was also  to learn the rudiments of South African agriculture from him for a  valuable consideration; and I was to lodge in his house while my  own was building. He gave me his views on the cultivation of oats.  He gave them at some length--more length than perspicuity. I knew  nothing about oats, save that they were employed in the manufacture  of porridge--which I detest; but I was to be near Hilda once more,  and I was prepared to undertake the superintendence of the oat from  its birth to its reaping if only I might be allowed to live so  close to Hilda.    
The farmer and his wife were Boers, but they spoke English. Mr.  Jan Willem Klaas himself was a fine specimen of the breed--tall,  erect, broad-shouldered, and genial. Mrs. Klaas, his wife, was  mainly suggestive, in mind and person, of suet-pudding. There was  one prattling little girl of three years old, by name Sannie, a  most engaging child; and also a chubby baby.    
"You are betrothed, of course?" Mrs. Klaas said to Hilda before me,  with the curious tactlessness of her race, when we made our first  arrangement.    
Hilda's face flushed. "No; we are nothing to one another," she  answered--which was only true formally. "Dr. Cumberledge had a  post at the same hospital in London where I was a nurse; and he  thought he would like to try Rhodesia. That is all."    
Mrs. Klaas gazed from one to other of us suspiciously. "You  English are strange!" she answered, with a complacent little shrug.  "But there--from Europe! Your ways, we know, are different."    
Hilda did not attempt to explain. It would have been impossible to  make the good soul understand. Her horizon was so simple. She was  a harmless housewife, given mostly to dyspepsia and the care of her  little ones. Hilda had won her heart by unfeigned admiration for  the chubby baby. To a mother, that covers a multitude of  eccentricities, such as one expects to find in incomprehensible  English. Mrs. Klaas put up with me because she liked Hilda.    
We spent some months together on Klaas's farm. It was a dreary  place, save for Hilda. The bare daub-and-wattle walls; the clumps  of misshapen and dusty prickly-pears that girt round the thatched  huts of the Kaffir workpeople; the stone-penned sheep-kraals, and  the corrugated iron roof of the bald stable for the waggon oxen--  all was as crude and ugly as a new country can make things. It  seemed to me a desecration that Hilda should live in such an  unfinished land--Hilda, whom I imagined as moving by nature through  broad English parks, with Elizabethan cottages and immemorial oaks--  Hilda, whose proper atmosphere seemed to be one of coffee-coloured  laces, ivy-clad abbeys, lichen-incrusted walls--all that is  beautiful and gracious in time-honoured civilisations.    
Nevertheless, we lived on there in a meaningless sort of way--I  hardly knew why. To me it was a puzzle. When I asked Hilda, she  shook her head with her sibylline air and answered, confidently:  "You do not understand Sebastian as well as I do. We have to wait  for <i>him</i>. The next move is his. Till he plays his piece, I cannot  tell how I may have to checkmate him."    
So we waited for Sebastian to advance a pawn. Meanwhile, I toyed  with South African farming--not very successfully, I must admit.  Nature did not design me for growing oats. I am no judge of oxen,  and my views on the feeding of Kaffir sheep raised broad smiles on  the black faces of my Mashona labourers.    
I still lodged at Tant Mettie's, as everybody called Mrs. Klaas;  she was courtesy aunt to the community at large, while Oom Jan  Willem was its courtesy uncle. They were simple, homely folk, who  lived up to their religious principles on an unvaried diet of  stewed ox-beef and bread; they suffered much from chronic  dyspepsia, due in part, at least, no doubt, to the monotony of  their food, their life, their interests. One could hardly believe  one was still in the nineteenth century; these people had the calm,  the local seclusion of the prehistoric epoch. For them, Europe did  not exist; they knew it merely as a place where settlers came from.  What the Czar intended, what the Kaiser designed, never disturbed  their rest. A sick ox, a rattling tile on the roof, meant more to  their lives than war in Europe. The one break in the sameness of  their daily routine was family prayers; the one weekly event, going  to church at Salisbury. Still, they had a single enthusiasm. Like  everybody else for fifty miles around, they believed profoundly in  the "future of Rhodesia." When I gazed about me at the raw new  land--the weary flat of red soil and brown grasses--I felt at least  that, with a present like that, it had need of a future.    
I am not by disposition a pioneer; I belong instinctively to the  old civilisations. In the midst of rudimentary towns and incipient  fields, I yearn for grey houses, a Norman church, an English  thatched cottage.    
However, for Hilda's sake, I braved it out, and continued to learn  the A B C of agriculture on an unmade farm with great assiduity  from Oom Jan Willem.    
We had been stopping some months at Klaas's together when business  compelled me one day to ride in to Salisbury. I had ordered some  goods for my farm from England which had at last arrived. I had  now to arrange for their conveyance from the town to my plot of  land--a portentous matter. Just as I was on the point of leaving  Klaas's, and was tightening the saddle-girth on my sturdy little  pony, Oom Jan Willem himself sidled up to me with a mysterious air,  his broad face all wrinkled with anticipatory pleasure. He placed  a sixpence in my palm, glancing about him on every side as he did  so, like a conspirator.    
"What am I to buy with it?" I asked, much puzzled, and suspecting  tobacco. Tant Mettie declared he smoked too much for a church  elder.    
He put his finger to his lips, nodded, and peered round.  "Lollipops for Sannie," he whispered low, at last, with a guilty  smile. "But"--he glanced about him again--"give them to me,  please, when Tant Mettie isn't looking." His nod was all mystery.    
"You may rely on my discretion," I replied, throwing the time-  honoured prejudices of the profession to the winds, and well  pleased to aid and abet the simple-minded soul in his nefarious  designs against little Sannie's digestive apparatus. He patted me  on the back. "<i>Peppermint</i> lollipops, mind!" he went on, in the same  solemn undertone. "Sannie likes them best--peppermint."    
I put my foot in the stirrup, and vaulted into my saddle. "They  shall not be forgotten," I answered, with a quiet smile at this  pretty little evidence of fatherly feeling. I rode off. It was  early morning, before the heat of the day began. Hilda accompanied  me part of the way on her bicycle. She was going to the other  young farm, some eight miles off, across the red-brown plateau,  where she gave lessons daily to the ten-year old daughter of an  English settler. It was a labour of love; for settlers in Rhodesia  cannot afford to pay for what are beautifully described as  "finishing governesses"; but Hilda was of the sort who cannot eat  the bread of idleness. She had to justify herself to her kind by  finding some work to do which should vindicate her existence.    
I parted from her at a point on the monotonous plain where one  rubbly road branched off from another. Then I jogged on in the  full morning sun over that scorching plain of loose red sand all  the way to Salisbury. Not a green leaf or a fresh flower anywhere.  The eye ached at the hot glare of the reflected sunlight from the  sandy level.    
My business detained me several hours in the half-built town, with  its flaunting stores and its rough new offices; it was not till  towards afternoon that I could get away again on my sorrel, across  the blazing plain once more to Klaas's.    
I moved on over the plateau at an easy trot, full of thoughts of  Hilda. What could be the step she expected Sebastian to take next?  She did not know, herself, she had told me; there, her faculty  failed her. But <i>some</i> step he <i>would</i> take; and till he took it she  must rest and be watchful.    
I passed the great tree that stands up like an obelisk in the midst  of the plain beyond the deserted Matabele village. I passed the  low clumps of dry karroo-bushes by the rocky kopje. I passed the  fork of the rubbly roads where I had parted from Hilda. At last, I  reached the long, rolling ridge which looks down upon Klaas's, and  could see in the slant sunlight the mud farmhouse and the  corrugated iron roof where the oxen were stabled.    
The place looked more deserted, more dead-alive than ever. Not a  black boy moved in it. Even the cattle and Kaffir sheep were  nowhere to be seen. . . . But then it was always quiet; and  perhaps I noticed the obtrusive air of solitude and sleepiness even  more than usual, because I had just returned from Salisbury. All  things are comparative. After the lost loneliness of Klaas's farm,  even brand-new Salisbury seemed busy and bustling.    
I hurried on, ill at ease. But Tant Mettie would, doubtless, have  a cup of tea ready for me as soon as I arrived, and Hilda would be  waiting at the gate to welcome me.    
I reached the stone enclosure, and passed up through the flower-  garden. To my great surprise, Hilda was not there. As a rule, she  came to meet me, with her sunny smile. But perhaps she was tired,  or the sun on the road might have given her a headache. I  dismounted from my mare, and called one of the Kaffir boys to take  her to the stable. Nobody answered. . . . I called again. Still  silence. . . . I tied her up to the post, and strode over to the  door, astonished at the solitude. I began to feel there was  something weird and uncanny about this home-coming. Never before  had I known Klaas's so entirely deserted.    
I lifted the latch and opened the door. It gave access at once to  the single plain living-room. There, all was huddled. For a  moment my eyes hardly took in the truth. There are sights so  sickening that the brain at the first shock wholly fails to realise  them.    
On the stone slab floor of the low living-room Tant Mettie lay  dead. Her body was pierced through by innumerable thrusts, which I  somehow instinctively recognised as assegai wounds. By her side  lay Sannie, the little prattling girl of three, my constant  playmate, whom I had instructed in cat's-cradle, and taught the  tales of Cinderella and Red Riding Hood. My hand grasped the  lollipops in my pocket convulsively. She would never need them.  Nobody else was about. What had become of Oom Jan Willem--and the  baby?    
I wandered out into the yard, sick with the sight I had already  seen. There Oom Jan Willem himself lay stretched at full length; a  bullet had pierced his left temple; his body was also riddled  through with assegai thrusts.    
I saw at once what this meant. A rising of the Matabele!    
I had come back from Salisbury, unknowing it, into the midst of a  revolt of bloodthirsty savages.    
Yet, even if I had known, I must still have hurried home with all  speed to Klaas's--to protect Hilda.    
Hilda? Where was Hilda? A breathless sinking crept over me.    
I staggered out into the open. It was impossible to say what  horror might not have happened. The Matabele might even now be  lurking about the kraal--for the bodies were hardly cold. But  Hilda? Hilda? Whatever came, I must find Hilda.    
Fortunately, I had my loaded revolver in my belt. Though we had  not in the least anticipated this sudden revolt--it broke like a  thunder-clap from a clear sky--the unsettled state of the country  made even women go armed about their daily avocations.    
I strode on, half maddened. Beside the great block of granite  which sheltered the farm there rose one of those rocky little  hillocks of loose boulders which are locally known in South Africa  by the Dutch name of kopjes. I looked out upon it drearily. Its  round brown ironstones lay piled irregularly together, almost as if  placed there in some earlier age by the mighty hands of prehistoric  giants. My gaze on it was blank. I was thinking, not of it, but  of Hilda, Hilda.    
I called the name aloud: "Hilda! Hilda! Hilda!"    
As I called, to my immense surprise, one of the smooth round  boulders on the hillside seemed slowly to uncurl, and to peer about  it cautiously. Then it raised itself in the slant sunlight, put a  hand to its eyes, and gazed out upon me with a human face for a  moment. After that it descended, step by step, among the other  stones, with a white object in its arms. As the boulder uncurled  and came to life, I was aware, by degrees . . . yes, yes, it was  Hilda, with Tant Mettie's baby!    
In the fierce joy of that discovery I rushed forward to her,  trembling, and clasped her in my arms. I could find no words but  "Hilda! Hilda!"    
"Are they gone?" she asked, staring about her with a terrified air,  though still strangely preserving her wonted composure of manner.    
"Who gone? The Matabele?"    
"Yes, yes!"    
"Did you see them, Hilda?"    
"For a moment--with black shields and assegais, all shouting madly.  You have been to the house, Hubert? You know what has happened?"    
"Yes, yes, I know--a rising. They have massacred the Klaases."    
She nodded. "I came back on my bicycle, and, when I opened the  door, found Tant Mettie and little Sannie dead. Poor, sweet little  Sannie! Oom Jan was lying shot in the yard outside. I saw the  cradle overturned, and looked under it for the baby. They did not  kill her--perhaps did not notice her. I caught her up in my arms,  and rushed out to my machine, thinking to make for Salisbury, and  give the alarm to the men there. One must try to save others--and  <i>you</i> were coming, Hubert! Then I heard horses' hoofs--the Matabele  returning. They dashed back, mounted,--stolen horses from other  farms,--they have taken poor Oom Jan's,--and they have gone on,  shouting, to murder elsewhere! I flung down my machine among the  bushes as they came,--I hope they have not seen it,--and I crouched  here between the boulders, with the baby in my arms, trusting for  protection to the colour of my dress, which is just like the  ironstone."    
"It is a perfect deception," I answered, admiring her instinctive  cleverness even then. "I never so much as noticed you."    
"No, nor the Matabele either, for all their sharp eyes. They  passed by without stopping. I clasped the baby hard, and tried to  keep it from crying--if it had cried, all would have been lost; but  they passed just below, and swept on toward Rozenboom's. I lay  still for a while, not daring to look out. Then I raised myself  warily, and tried to listen. Just at that moment, I heard a  horse's hoofs ring out once more. I couldn't tell, of course,  whether it was <i>you</i> returning, or one of the Matabele, left behind  by the others. So I crouched again. . . . Thank God, you are  safe, Hubert!"    
All this took a moment to say, or was less said than hinted. "Now,  what must we do?" I cried. "Bolt back again to Salisbury?"    
"It is the only thing possible--if my machine is unhurt. They may  have taken it . . . or ridden over and broken it."    
We went down to the spot, and picked it up where it lay, half-  concealed among the brittle, dry scrub of milk-bushes. I examined  the bearings carefully; though there were hoof-marks close by, it  had received no hurt. I blew up the tire, which was somewhat  flabby, and went on to untie my sturdy pony. The moment I looked  at her I saw the poor little brute was wearied out with her two  long rides in the sweltering sun. Her flanks quivered. "It is no  use," I cried, patting her, as she turned to me with appealing eyes  that asked for water. "She <i>can't</i> go back as far as Salisbury; at  least, till she has had a feed of corn and a drink. Even then, it  will be rough on her."    
"Give her bread," Hilda suggested. "That will hearten her more  than corn. There is plenty in the house; Tant Mettie baked this  morning."    
I crept in reluctantly to fetch it. I also brought out from the  dresser a few raw eggs, to break into a tumbler and swallow whole;  for Hilda and I needed food almost as sorely as the poor beast  herself. There was something gruesome in thus rummaging about for  bread and meat in the dead woman's cupboard, while she herself lay  there on the floor; but one never realises how one will act in  these great emergencies until they come upon one. Hilda, still  calm with unearthly calmness, took a couple of loaves from my hand,  and began feeding the pony with them. "Go and draw water for her,"  she said, simply, "while I give her the bread; that will save time.  Every minute is precious."    
I did as I was bid, not knowing each moment but that the insurgents  would return. When I came back from the spring with the bucket,  the mare had demolished the whole two loaves, and was going on upon  some grass which Hilda had plucked for her.    
"She hasn't had enough, poor dear," Hilda said, patting her neck.  "A couple of loaves are penny buns to her appetite. Let her drink  the water, while I go in and fetch out the rest of the baking."    
I hesitated. "You <i>can't</i> go in there again, Hilda!" I cried.  "Wait, and let me do it."    
Her white face was resolute. "Yes, I <i>can</i>," she answered. "It is a  work of necessity; and in works of necessity a woman, I think,  should flinch at nothing. Have I not seen already every varied  aspect of death at Nathaniel's?" And in she went, undaunted, to  that chamber of horrors, still clasping the baby.    
The pony made short work of the remaining loaves, which she  devoured with great zest. As Hilda had predicted, they seemed to  hearten her. The food and drink, with a bucket of water dashed on  her hoofs, gave her new vigour like wine. We gulped down our eggs  in silence. Then I held Hilda's bicycle. She vaulted lightly on  to the seat, white and tired as she was, with the baby in her left  arm, and her right hand on the handle-bar.    
"I must take the baby," I said.    
She shook her head.    
"Oh, no. I will not trust her to you."    
"Hilda, I insist."    
"And I insist, too. It is my place to take her."    
"But can you ride so?" I asked, anxiously.    
She began to pedal. "Oh, dear, yes. It is quite, quite easy. I  shall get there all right--if the Matabele don't burst upon us."    
Tired as I was with my long day's work, I jumped into my saddle. I  saw I should only lose time if I disputed about the baby. My  little horse seemed to understand that something grave had  occurred; for, weary as she must have been, she set out with a will  once more over that great red level. Hilda pedalled bravely by my  side. The road was bumpy, but she was well accustomed to it. I  could have ridden faster than she went, for the baby weighted her.  Still, we rode for dear life. It was a grim experience.    
All round, by this time, the horizon was dim with clouds of black  smoke which went up from burning farms and plundered homesteads.  The smoke did not rise high; it hung sullenly over the hot plain in  long smouldering masses, like the smoke of steamers on foggy days  in England. The sun was nearing the horizon; his slant red rays  lighted up the red plain, the red sand, the brown-red grasses, with  a murky, spectral glow of crimson. After those red pools of blood,  this universal burst of redness appalled one. It seemed as though  all nature had conspired in one unholy league with the Matabele.  We rode on without a word. The red sky grew redder.    
"They may have sacked Salisbury!" I exclaimed at last, looking out  towards the brand-new town.    
"I doubt it," Hilda answered. Her very doubt reassured me.    
We began to mount a long slope. Hilda pedalled with difficulty.  Not a sound was heard save the light fall of my pony's feet on the  soft new road, and the shrill cry of the cicalas. Then, suddenly,  we started. What was that noise in our rear? Once, twice, it rang  out. The loud ping of a rifle!    
Looking behind us, we saw eight or ten mounted Matabele! Stalwart  warriors they were--half naked, and riding stolen horses. They  were coming our way! They had seen us! They were pursuing us!    
"Put on all speed!" I cried, in my agony. "Hilda, can you manage  it?" She pedalled with a will. But, as we mounted the slope, I  saw they were gaining upon us. A few hundred yards were all our  start. They had the descent of the opposite hill as yet in their  favour.    
One man, astride on a better horse than the rest, galloped on in  front and came within range of us. He had a rifle in his hand, he  pointed it twice, and covered us. But he did not shoot. Hilda  gave a cry of relief. "Don't you see?" she exclaimed. "It is Oom  Jan Willem's rifle! That was their last cartridge. They have no  more ammunition."    
I saw she was probably right; for Klaas was out of cartridges, and  was waiting for my new stock to arrive from England. If that were  correct, they must get near enough to attack us with assegais.  They are more dangerous so. I remembered what an old Boer had said  to me at Buluwayo: "The Zulu with his assegai is an enemy to be  feared; with a gun, he is a bungler."    
We pounded on up the hill. It was deadly work, with those brutes  at our heels. The child on Hilda's arm was visibly wearying her.  It kept on whining. "Hilda," I cried, "that baby will lose your  life! You <i>cannot</i> go on carrying it."    
She turned to me with a flash of her eyes. "What! You are a man,"  she broke out, "and you ask a woman to save her life by abandoning  a baby! Hubert, you shame me!"    
I felt she was right. If she had been capable of giving it up, she  would not have been Hilda. There was but one other way left.    
"Then <i>you</i> must take the pony," I called out, "and let me have the  bicycle!"    
"You couldn't ride it," she called back. "It is a woman's machine,  remember."    
"Yes, I could," I replied, without slowing. "It is not much too  short; and I can bend my knees a bit. Quick, quick! No words! Do  as I tell you!"    
She hesitated a second. The child's weight distressed her. "We  should lose time in changing," she answered, at last, doubtful but  still pedalling, though my hand was on the rein, ready to pull up  the pony.    
"Not if we manage it right. Obey orders! The moment I say 'Halt,'  I shall slacken my mare's pace. When you see me leave the saddle,  jump off instantly, you, and mount her! I will catch the machine  before it falls. Are you ready? Halt, then!"    
She obeyed the word without one second's delay. I slipped off,  held the bridle, caught the bicycle, and led it instantaneously.  Then I ran beside the pony--bridle in one hand, machine in the  other--till Hilda had sprung with a light bound into the stirrup.  At that, a little leap, and I mounted the bicycle. It was all done  nimbly, in less time than the telling takes, for we are both of us  naturally quick in our movements. Hilda rode like a man, astride--  her short, bicycling skirt, unobtrusively divided in front and at  the back, made this easily possible. Looking behind me with a  hasty glance, I could see that the savages, taken aback, had reined  in to deliberate at our unwonted evolution. I feel sure that the  novelty of the iron horse, with a woman riding it, played not a  little on their superstitious fears; they suspected, no doubt, this  was some ingenious new engine of war devised against them by the  unaccountable white man; it might go off unexpectedly in their  faces at any moment. Most of them, I observed, as they halted,  carried on their backs black ox-hide shields, interlaced with white  thongs; they were armed with two or three assegais apiece and a  knobkerry.    
Instead of losing time by the change, as it turned out, we had  actually gained it. Hilda was able to put on my sorrel to her full  pace, which I had not dared to do, for fear of outrunning my  companion; the wise little beast, for her part, seemed to rise to  the occasion, and to understand that we were pursued; for she  stepped out bravely. On the other hand, in spite of the low seat  and the short crank of a woman's machine, I could pedal up the  slope with more force than Hilda, for I am a practised hill-  climber; so that in both ways we gained, besides having momentarily  disconcerted and checked the enemy. Their ponies were tired, and  they rode them full tilt with savage recklessness, making them  canter up-hill, and so needlessly fatiguing them. The Matabele,  indeed, are unused to horses, and manage them but ill. It is as  foot soldiers, creeping stealthily through bush or long grass, that  they are really formidable. Only one of their mounts was tolerably  fresh, the one which had once already almost overtaken us. As we  neared the top of the slope, Hilda, glancing behind her, exclaimed,  with a sudden thrill, "He is spurting again, Hubert!"    
I drew my revolver and held it in my right hand, using my left for  steering. I did not look back; time was far too precious. I set  my teeth hard. "Tell me when he draws near enough for a shot," I  said, quietly.    
Hilda only nodded. Being mounted on the mare, she could see behind  her more steadily now than I could from the machine; and her eye  was trustworthy. As for the baby, rocked by the heave and fall of  the pony's withers, it had fallen asleep placidly in the very midst  of this terror!    
After a second, I asked once more, with bated breath, "Is he  gaining?"    
She looked back. "Yes; gaining."    
A pause. "And now?"    
"Still gaining. He is poising an assegai."    
Ten seconds more passed in breathless suspense. The thud of their  horses' hoofs alone told me their nearness. My finger was on the  trigger. I awaited the word. "Fire!" she said at last, in a calm,  unflinching voice. "He is well within distance."    
I turned half round and levelled as true as I could at the  advancing black man. He rode, nearly naked, showing all his teeth  and brandishing his assegai; the long white feathers stuck upright  in his hair gave him a wild and terrifying barbaric aspect. It was  difficult to preserve one's balance, keep the way on, and shoot,  all at the same time; but, spurred by necessity, I somehow did it.  I fired three shots in quick succession. My first bullet missed;  my second knocked the man over; my third grazed the horse. With a  ringing shriek, the Matabele fell in the road, a black writhing  mass; his horse, terrified, dashed back with maddened snorts into  the midst of the others. Its plunging disconcerted the whole party  for a minute.    
We did not wait to see the rest. Taking advantage of this  momentary diversion in our favour, we rode on at full speed to the  top of the slope--I never knew before how hard I could pedal--and  began to descend at a dash into the opposite hollow.    
The sun had set by this time. There is no twilight in those  latitudes. It grew dark at once. We could see now, in the plain  all round, where black clouds of smoke had rolled before, one lurid  red glare of burning houses, mixed with a sullen haze of tawny  light from the columns of prairie fire kindled by the insurgents.    
We made our way still onward across the open plain without one word  towards Salisbury. The mare was giving out. She strode with a  will; but her flanks were white with froth; her breath came short;  foam flew from her nostrils.    
As we mounted the next ridge, still distancing our pursuers, I saw  suddenly, on its crest, defined against the livid red sky like a  silhouette, two more mounted black men!    
"It's all up, Hilda!" I cried, losing heart at last. "They are on  both sides of us now! The mare is spent; we are surrounded!"    
She drew rein and gazed at them. For a moment suspense spoke in  all her attitude. Then she burst into a sudden deep sigh of  relief. "No, no," she cried; "these are friendlies!"    
"How do you know?" I gasped. But I believed her.    
"They are looking out this way, with hands shading their eyes  against the red glare. They are looking away from Salisbury, in  the direction of the attack. They are expecting the enemy. They  <i>must</i> be friendlies! See, see! they have caught sight of us!"    
As she spoke, one of the men lifted his rifle and half pointed it.  "Don't shoot! don't shoot!" I shrieked aloud. "We are English!  English!"    
The men let their rifles drop, and rode down towards us. "Who are  you?" I cried.    
They saluted us, military fashion. "Matabele police, sah," the  leader answered, recognising me. "You are flying from Klaas's?"    
"Yes," I answered. "They have murdered Klaas, with his wife and  child. Some of them are now following us."    
The spokesman was a well-educated Cape Town negro. "All right  sah," he answered. "I have forty men here right behind de kopje.  Let dem come! We can give a good account of dem. Ride on straight  wit de lady to Salisbury!"    
"The Salisbury people know of this rising, then?" I asked.    
"Yes, sah. Dem know since five o'clock. Kaffir boys from Klaas's  brought in de news; and a white man escaped from Rozenboom's  confirm it. We have pickets all round. You is safe now; you can  ride on into Salisbury witout fear of de Matabele."    
I rode on, relieved. Mechanically, my feet worked to and fro on  the pedals. It was a gentle down-gradient now towards the town.  I had no further need for special exertion.    
Suddenly, Hilda's voice came wafted to me, as through a mist.  "What are you doing, Hubert? You'll be off in a minute!"    
I started and recovered my balance with difficulty. Then I was  aware at once that one second before I had all but dropped asleep,  dog tired, on the bicycle. Worn out with my long day and with the  nervous strain, I began to doze off, with my feet still moving  round and round automatically, the moment the anxiety of the chase  was relieved, and an easy down-grade gave me a little respite.    
I kept myself awake even then with difficulty. Riding on through  the lurid gloom, we reached Salisbury at last, and found the town  already crowded with refugees from the plateau. However, we  succeeded in securing two rooms at a house in the long street, and  were soon sitting down to a much-needed supper.    
As we rested, an hour or two later, in the ill-furnished back room,  discussing this sudden turn of affairs with our host and some  neighbours--for, of course, all Salisbury was eager for news from  the scene of the massacres--I happened to raise my head, and saw,  to my great surprise . . . a haggard white face peering in at us  through the window.    
It peered round a corner, stealthily. It was an ascetic face, very  sharp and clear-cut. It had a stately profile. The long and wiry  grizzled moustache, the deep-set, hawk-like eyes, the acute,  intense, intellectual features, all were very familiar. So was the  outer setting of long, white hair, straight and silvery as it fell,  and just curled in one wave-like inward sweep where it turned and  rested on the stooping shoulders. But the expression on the face  was even stranger than the sudden apparition. It was an expression  of keen and poignant disappointment--as of a man whom fate has  baulked of some well-planned end, his due by right, which mere  chance has evaded.    
"They say there's a white man at the bottom of all this trouble,"  our host had been remarking, one second earlier. "The niggers know  too much; and where did they get their rifles? People at  Rozenboom's believe some black-livered traitor has been stirring up  the Matabele for weeks and weeks. An enemy of Rhodes's, of course,  jealous of our advance; a French agent, perhaps; but more likely  one of these confounded Transvaal Dutchmen. Depend upon it, it's  Kruger's doing."    
As the words fell from his lips, I saw the face. I gave a quick  little start, then recovered my composure.    
But Hilda noted it. She looked up at me hastily. She was sitting  with her back to the window, and therefore, of course, could not  see the face itself, which indeed was withdrawn with a hurried  movement, yet with a certain strange dignity, almost before I could  feel sure of having seen it. Still, she caught my startled  expression, and the gleam of surprise and recognition in my eye.  She laid one hand upon my arm. "You have seen him?" she asked  quietly, almost below her breath.    
"Seen whom?"    
"Sebastian."    
It was useless denying it to <i>her</i>. "Yes, I have seen him," I  answered, in a confidential aside.    
"Just now--this moment--at the back of the house--looking in at the  window upon us?"    
"You are right--as always."    
She drew a deep breath. "He has played his game," she said low to  me, in an awed undertone. "I felt sure it was he. I expected him  to play; though what piece, I knew not; and when I saw those poor  dead souls, I was certain he had done it--indirectly done it. The  Matabele are his pawns. He wanted to aim a blow at <i>me</i>; and <i>this</i>  was the way he chose to aim it."    
"Do you think he is capable of that?" I cried. For, in spite of  all, I had still a sort of lingering respect for Sebastian. "It  seems so reckless--like the worst of anarchists--when he strikes at  one head, to involve so many irrelevant lives in one common  destruction."    
Hilda's face was like a drowned man's.    
"To Sebastian," she answered, shuddering, "the End is all; the  Means are unessential. Who wills the End, wills the Means; that is  the sum and substance of his philosophy of life. From first to  last, he has always acted up to it. Did I not tell you once he was  a snow-clad volcano?"    
"Still, I am loth to believe--" I cried.    
She interrupted me calmly. "I knew it," she said. "I expected it.  Beneath that cold exterior, the fires of his life burn fiercely  still. I told you we must wait for Sebastian's next move; though I  confess, even from <i>him</i>, I hardly dreamt of this one. But, from the  moment when I opened the door on poor Tant Mettie's body, lying  there in its red horror, I felt it must be he. And when you  started just now, I said to myself in a flash of intuition--  'Sebastian has come! He has come to see how his devil's work has  prospered.' He sees it has gone wrong. So now he will try to  devise some other."    
I thought of the malign expression on that cruel white face as it  stared in at the window from the outer gloom, and I felt convinced  she was right. She had read her man once more. For it was the  desperate, contorted face of one appalled to discover that a great  crime attempted and successfully carried out has failed, by mere  accident, of its central intention.
