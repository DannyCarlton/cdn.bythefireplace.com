SCENE: St. Petersburg. Period: the present time. A ballroom in the<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; winter palace of the Prince--. The ladies in character costumes and<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; masks. The gentlemen in official dress and unmasked, with the<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exception of six tall figures in scarlet kaftans, who are treated with<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; marked distinction as they move here and there among the<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; promenaders. Quadrille music throughout the dialogue.<br> Count SERGIUS PAVLOVICH PANSHINE, who has just<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; arrived, is standing anxiously in the doorway of an antechamber<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with his eyes fixed upon a lady in the costume of a maid of honor<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in the time of Catherine II. The lady presently disengages herself<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the crowd, and passes near Count PANSHINE, who<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impulsively takes her by the hand and leads her across the threshold<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of the inner apartment, which is unoccupied. 
<b>HE.</b> 
Pauline! 
<b>SHE.</b> 
You knew me? 
<b>HE.</b> 
How could I have failed?<br> A mask may hide your features, not your soul.<br> There is an air about you like the air<br> That folds a star. A blind man knows the night,<br> And feels the constellations. No coarse sense<br> Of eye or ear had made you plain to me.<br> Through these I had not found you; for your eyes,<br> As blue as violets of our Novgorod,<br> Look black behind your mask there, and your voice--<br> I had not known that either. My heart said,<br> "Pauline Pavlovna." 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Ah! Your heart said that?<br> You trust your heart, then! 'Tis a serious risk!--<br> How is it you and others wear no mask? 
<b>HE.</b> 
The Emperor's orders. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Is the Emperor here?<br> I have not seen him. 
<b>HE.</b> 
He is one of the six<br> In scarlet kaftans and all masked alike.<br> Watch--you will note how every one bows down<br> Before those figures, thinking each by chance<br> May be the Tsar; yet none knows which is he.<br> Even his counterparts are left in doubt.<br> Unhappy Russia! No serf ever wore<br> Such chains as gall our Emperor these sad days.<br> He dare trust no man. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
All men are so false. 
<b>HE.</b> 
Spare one, Pauline Pavlovna. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
No; all, all!<br> I think there is no truth left in the world,<br> In man or woman. Once were noble souls.--<br> Count Sergius, is Nastasia here to-night? 
<b>HE.</b> 
Ah! then you know! I thought to tell you first.<br> Not here, beneath these hundred curious eyes,<br> In all this glare of light; but in some place<br> Where I could throw me at your feet and weep.<br> In what shape came the story to your ear?<br> Decked in the teller's colors, I'll be sworn;<br> The truth, but in the livery of a lie,<br> And so must wrong me. Only this is true:<br> The Tsar, because I risked my wretched life<br> To shield a life as wretched as my own,<br> Bestows upon me, as supreme reward--<br> O irony!--the hand of this poor girl.<br> Says, HERE, I HAVE THE PEARL OF PEARLS FOR YOU,<br> SUCH AS WAS NEVER PLUCKED FROM OUT THE DEEP<br> BY INDIAN DIVER, FOR A SULTAN'S CROWN.<br> YOUR JOY'S DECREED, and stabs me with a smile. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
And she--she loves you? 
<b>HE.</b> 
I know not, indeed.<br> Likes me, perhaps. What matters it?--HER love!<br> The guardian, Sidor Yurievich, consents,<br> And she consents. No love in it at all,<br> A mere caprice, a young girl's spring-tide dream.<br> Sick of her ear-rings, weary of her mare,<br> She'll have a lover--something ready-made,<br> Or improvised between two cups of tea--<br> A lover by imperial ukase!<br> Fate said her word--I chanced to be the man!<br> If that grenade the crazy student threw<br> Had not spared me, as well as spared the Tsar,<br> All this would not have happened. I'd have been<br> A hero, but quite safe from her romance.<br> She takes me for a hero--think of that!<br> Now by our holy Lady of Kazan,<br> When I have finished pitying myself,<br> I'll pity her. 
<b>SHE.</b><br>  Oh no; begin with her;<br> She needs it most. 
<b>HE.</b> 
At her door lies the blame,<br> Whatever falls. She, with a single word,<br> With half a tear, had stopt it at the first,<br> This cruel juggling with poor human hearts. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
The Tsar commanded it--you said the Tsar. 
<b>HE.</b> 
The Tsar does what she wills--God fathoms why.<br> Were she his mistress, now! but there's no snow<br> Whiter within the bosom of a cloud,<br> Nor colder either. She is very haughty,<br> For all her fragile air of gentleness;<br> With something vital in her, like those flowers<br> That on our desolate steppes outlast the year.<br> Resembles you in some things. It was that<br> First made us friends. I do her justice, see!<br> For we were friends in that smooth surface way<br> We Russians have imported out of France.<br> Alas! from what a blue and tranquil heaven<br> This bolt fell on me! After these two years,<br> My suit with Ossip Leminoff at end,<br> The old wrong righted, the estates restored,<br> And my promotion, with the ink not dry!<br> Those fairies which neglected me at birth<br> Seemed now to lavish all good gifts on me--<br> Gold roubles, office, sudden dearest friends.<br> The whole world smiled; then, as I stooped to taste<br> The sweetest cup, freak dashed it from my lip.<br> This very night--just think, this very night--<br> I planned to come and beg of you the alms<br> I dared not ask for in my poverty.<br> I thought me poor then. How stript am I now!<br> There's not a ragged mendicant one meets<br> Along the Nevski Prospekt but has leave<br> To tell his love, and I have not that right!<br> Pauline Pavlovna, why do you stand there<br> Stark as a statue, with no word to say? 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Because this thing has frozen up my heart.<br> I think that there is something killed in me,<br> A dream that would have mocked all other bliss.<br> What shall I say? What would you have me say? 
<b>HE.</b> 
If it be possible, the word of words! 
<b>SHE, VERY SLOWLY.</b> 
Well, then--I love you. I may tell you so<br> This once, . . . and then forever hold my peace.<br> We cannot stay here longer unobserved.<br> No--do not touch me! but stand further off,<br> And seem to laugh, as if we jested--eyes,<br> Eyes everywhere! Now turn your face away . . .<br> I love you. 
<b>HE.</b> 
With such music in my ears<br> I would death found me. It were sweet to die<br> Listening! You love me--prove it. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Prove it--how?<br> I prove it saying it. How else? 
<b>HE.</b> 
Pauline,<br> I have three things to choose from; you shall choose:<br> This marriage, or Siberia, or France.<br> The first means hell; the second, purgatory;<br> The third--with you--were nothing less than heaven! 
<b>SHE, STARTING.</b> 
How dared you even dream it! 
<b>HE.</b> 
I was mad.<br> This business has touched me in the brain.<br> Have patience! the calamity's so new.<br> (Pauses.)<br> There is a fourth way; but that gate is shut<br> To brave men who hold life a thing of God. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Yourself spoke there; the rest was not of you. 
<b>HE.</b> 
Oh, lift me to your level! So I'm safe.<br> What's to be done? 
<b>SHE.</b> 
There must be some path out.<br> Perhaps the Emperor-- 
<b>HE.</b> 
Not a ray of hope!<br> His mind is set on this with that insistence<br> Which seems to seize on all match-making folk.<br> The fancy bites them, and they straight go mad. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Your father's friend, the Metropolitan--<br> A word from him . . . 
<b>HE.</b> 
Alas, he too is bitten!<br> Gray-haired, gray-hearted, worldly wise, he sees<br> This marriage makes me the Tsar's protege,<br> And opens every door to preference. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Think while I think. There surely is some key<br> Unlocks the labyrinth, could we but find it.<br> Nastasia! 
<b>HE.</b> 
What! beg life of her? Not I. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Beg love. She is a woman, young, perhaps<br> Untouched as yet of this too poisonous air.<br> Were she told all, would she not pity us?<br> For if she love you, as I think she must,<br> Would not some generous impulse stir in her,<br> Some latent, unsuspected spark illume?<br> How love thrills even commonest girl-clay,<br> Ennobling it an instant, if no more!<br> You said that she is proud; then touch her pride,<br> And turn her into marble with the touch.<br> But yet the gentler passion is the stronger.<br> Go to her, tell her, in some tenderest phrase<br> That will not hurt too much--ah, but 'twill hurt!--<br> Just how your happiness lies in her hand<br> To make or mar for all time; hint, not say,<br> Your heart is gone from you, and you may find-- 
<b>HE.</b> 
A casemate in St. Peter and St. Paul<br> For, say, a month; then some Siberian town.<br> Not this way lies escape. At my first word<br> That sluggish Tartar blood would turn to fire<br> In every vein. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
How blindly you read her,<br> Or any woman! Yes, I know. I grant<br> How small we often seem in our small world<br> Of trivial cares and narrow precedents--<br> Lacking that wide horizon stretched for men--<br> Capricious, spiteful, frightened at a mouse;<br> But when it comes to suffering mortal pangs,<br> The weakest of us measures pulse with you. 
<b>HE.</b> 
Yes, you, not she. If she were at your height!<br> But there's no martyr wrapt in HER rose flesh.<br> There should have been; for Nature gave you both<br> The self-same purple for your eyes and hair,<br> The self-same Southern music to your lips,<br> Fashioned you both, as 'twere, in the same mould,<br> Yet failed to put the soul in one of you!<br> I know her wilful--her light head quite turned<br> In this court atmosphere of flatteries;<br> A Moscow beauty, petted and spoiled there,<br> And since spoiled here; as soft as swan's down now,<br> With words like honey melting from the comb,<br> But being crossed, vindictive, cruel, cold.<br> I fancy her, between two rosy smiles,<br> Saying, "Poor fellow, in the Nertchinsk mines!"<br> That is the sum of her. 
<b>SHE.</b> 
You know her not.<br> Count Sergius Pavlovich, you said no mask<br> Could hide the soul, yet how you have mistaken<br> The soul these two months--and the face to-night!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Removes her mask.] 
<b>HE.</b> 
You!--it was YOU! 
<b>SHE.</b> 
Count Sergius Pavlovich,<br> Go find Pauline Pavlovna--she is here--<br> And tell her that the Tsar has set you free.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [She goes out hurriedly, replacing her mask.]
