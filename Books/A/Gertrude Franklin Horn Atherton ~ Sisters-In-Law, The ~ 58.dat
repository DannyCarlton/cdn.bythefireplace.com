Gora entered her room at the pension, mechanically lit the oil stove that  Alexina had procured for her, threw her hat on the bed, sat down in the low  chair and thrust her hands info the thick coils of hair piled as always on  top of her head. As she did so she caught sight of herself in the mirror  and wondered absurdly why she should have kept all her hair and lost so  much of her face. She looked more top-heavy than ever. Her face was a small  oblong, her eyes out of all proportion. She thought herself hideous.    
She had heard two hours before that Gathbroke was in Paris attached to  the British Commission. She had met an old acquaintance, a San Francisco  newspaper man, who had taken her to lunch and spoken of him casually.  Gathbroke had good-naturedly given him an Interview when other members of  the Commission had been inaccessible.    
Gathbroke had told her nothing of a definite object when he wrote her that  he was off for Paris. Nor had he mentioned it in the note he had written  her after his arrival. This had been merely to tell her that he was feeling  as well as he ever had felt in his life and was enjoying himself. Polite  admonition not to tire herself out. He was always hers gratefully and her  devoted friend.    
He had written the note at the Rite Hotel, but when, assuming this was  his address, she had called him up on her arrival, she had received the  information that he was not stopping there, nor had been.    
Gora was very proud. But she was also very much in love; and she had been  in love with Gathbroke for twelve years. For the greater part of that time  she had believed it to be hopeless, but it had always been with her, a sad  but not too painful undertone in her busy life. It had kept her from even  a passing interest in another man. She had even felt a Somewhat ironic  gratitude to him and his indifference, for all the forces of her nature,  deprived of their natural outlet, went into her literary work, informing it  with an arresting and a magnetic vitality. She had believed herself to be  without hope, but in the remote feminine fastnesses of her nature she had  hoped, even dreamed--when she had the time. That was not often. Her life,  except when at her desk with her literary faculty turned loose, had been  practical to excess.    
She would have offered her services in any case to one of the warring  allies, no doubt of that; the tremendous adventure would have appealed to  her quite aside from the natural desire to place her high accomplishment as  a nurse at the disposal of tortured men. Nevertheless she was quite aware  that she went to the British Army with the distinct hope of meeting  Gathbroke again; quite as, under the cloak of travel, she would have gone  to England long since had she not been swindled by Mortimer.    
Until she found him insensible, apparently at the point of death, after the  terrible disaster of March, nineteen-eighteen, she had only heard of him  once: when she read in the <i>Times</i> he had been awarded the D.S.O.    
She knew then where he was and maneuvered to get back to France. She found  him sooner than she had dared to hope. And she believed that she had saved  his life. Not only by her accomplished nursing. Her powerful will had  thrown out its grappling irons about his escaping ego and dragged it back  and held it in its exhausted tenement.    
He had believed that also. He had an engaging spontaneity of nature and  he had felt and shown her a lively gratitude. He was restless and frankly  unhappy when she was out of his sight. He had a charming way of Baying  charming things to a woman and he said them to her. But he was also as full  of ironic humor as in his letters and "ragged" her. And he talked to her  eagerly when he was better and she had gone with him to a hospital far back  of the lines. There were intervals when they could talk, and the other men  would listen...and had taken things for granted.    
So had she. He had not made love to her. There was no privacy. Moreover,  she guessed that his keen sense of the ridiculous would not permit him to  make love to any woman when helpless under her hands.    
But how could there be other than one finale to such a story as theirs?  What was fiction but the reflection of life? if she had written a story  with these obvious materials there could have been but one logical  ending--unless, in a sudden spasm of reaction against romance, she had  killed him off.    
But he would live; and not be strong enough to return to the front for  mouths...the war <i>must</i> be over by then....As for romance, well, she was in  the romantic mood. It was a right of youth that she had missed, but a woman  may be quite as romantic at thirty-four as at eighteen, if she has sealed  her fountain instead of splashing it dry when she was too young to know  its preciousness. Once before she had surrendered to romance, fleetingly:  during the week that followed the night she had sat on Calvary with  Gathbroke and watched a sea of flames.    
The mood descended upon her, possessed her. She had other patients. There  were the same old horrors, the same heart-rending duties; but the mood  stayed with her. And after he left, for England. She knew there could, be  but one ending. Her imagination had surrendered to tradition.    
Moreover, she was tired of hard work. She wanted to settle down in a home.  She wanted children. She must always write, of course. Writing was as  natural to her as breathing. And she had already proved that a woman could  do two things equally well.    
<b>II</b>    
She never thought of trying to follow him back to England, to shirk the  increasing terrible duties behind the reorganized but harassed armies. The  wounded seemed to drop through the hospital roof like flies.    
Nevertheless when she was abruptly transferred to London she went without  protest! It was then that she began to have misgivings. She was given  charge of a large hospital just outside of London and her duties were  constant and confining. But she managed to go out to lunch with him twice  and once to dine; after which they drove back to the hospital in a slow and  battered old hansom.    
She returned a few weeks before the Armistice. She had not seen him for  four months. He was well and expecting to be sent back to the front any  day. At present they were making use of him in London.    
If anything he appeared to admire her more than ever, to be more solicitous  for her health. He lamented personally her exacting duties. But it was the  almost exuberant friendliness of one man for another, for a comrade, a good  fellow; although he often paid her quick little diagnostic compliments. If  she hadn't loved him she would have enjoyed his companionship. He had read  and thought and lived. Before the war he had been in active public life. He  had far greater plans for the future.    
He had been almost entirely impersonal. It had maddened her. Even the night  they had driven through the dark streets of London out to her hospital,  although he had talked more or less about himself, even encouraged her to  talk about herself, there had not been one instant of correlation.    
But she had made excuses as women do, in self-defense. He assumed that  he might easily go back to the front just in time to get himself killed,  although the end of the war was in sight....Her utter lack of experience  with men in any sex relation had made her stiff, even in her letters;  afraid of "giving herself away." She had no coquetry. If she had,  pride would have forbidden her to use it. Her ideals were intensely  old-fashioned. She wanted to be pursued, won. The man must do it all. Her  writings had never been in the least romantic. Well, she was, if romance  meant having certain fixed ideals.    
One thing puzzled her. When she wrote she manipulated her men and women in  their mutual relations with a master-hand. But she had not the least idea  how to manage her own affair. What was genius? A rotten spot in the brain,  a displacement of particles that operated independently of personality, of  the inherited ego? Possession? Ancestors come to life for an hour in the  subliminal depths? But what did she care for genius anyhow!    
One thing she would have been willing to do as her part, aside from meeting  him mentally at all points and showing a brisk frank pleasure in his  society: give him every chance to woo and win her, to find her more and  more indispensable to his happiness. But she was no woman of leisure. She  could not receive him in charming toilettes in an equally seductive room.  She had nothing for evening wear but an old black satin gown. After her  arrival in London she had found time to buy a smart enough tailored coat  and skirt, and a hat, but nothing more.    
And after the Armistice was declared she only saw him once.    
Then came his abrupt departure for Paris. His noncommittal note. Even then  she refused to despair. It would be an utterly impossible end to such a  story...after twelve years...not for a moment would she accept that.    
<b>III</b>    
She applied for her discharge. During her long stay in the British service  she had made influential friends. She had also made a high record not only  for ability but for an untiring fidelity. Her vacations had been few and  brief. She obtained her discharge and went to Paris. Her pride would permit  her to telephone. What more natural? Nothing would have surprised him more  than if she had not. She had little doubt of his falling into the habit of  daily companionship. He knew Paris and she did not. He would have seen her  daily in London if she had been free.    
Something, no doubt of that, held him back. He was discouraged...or not  sure of himself....She had assumed as a matter of course that he was at the  Ritz. When she found that he was not, had not been, she realized that he  had omitted to give her an address.    
That might have been mere carelessness....But to find him in Paris! She had  not visualized such swarms of people. She might almost have passed him on  the street and not seen him. But not for a moment did she waver from her  purpose. She held passionately to the belief that were they together day  after day, hours on end....    
Unbelievable.    
<b>IV</b>    
She had telephoned an hour ago to the hotel where he was staying with other  members of the British Commission and been told that he was out of town,  but might return any moment.    
There was nothing to do but write him a note and wait. She was not equal  to the humiliation of telephoning a third time. She wrote it at the hotel  where her English friends were staying and sent it by messenger, having  heard of the idiosyncracies of the Paris post.    
Hastings, her newspaper friend, had been altogether a bird of ill omen. He  had told her that the American market was glutted with "war stuff." The  public was sick of it. Some of the magazines were advertising that  they would read no more of it. She had told him that her material was  magnificent and he had replied: "Can it. Maybe a year or two from  now--five, more likely. I'm told over here that the war fiction we've had  wished on us by the ton resembles the real thing just about as much as  maneuvers look like the first Battle of the Marne, say, when the Germans  didn't know where they were at; went out quail hunting and struck a jungle  full of tigers....Why not? When most of 'em were written by men of middle  age snug beside a library fire with mattresses on the roof--in America not  even a Zeppelin to warm up their blood. But that doesn't matter. The public  took it all as gospel. Ate it up. Now it is fed up and wants something  else."    
What irony!    
And what a future if he--but that she would not face.
