The town of Coal Creek was hideous. People from prosperous towns and  cities of the middle west, from Ohio, Illinois, and Iowa, going east  to New York or Philadelphia, looked out of the car windows and seeing  the poor little houses scattered along the hillside thought of books  they had read of life in hovels in the old world. In chair-cars men  and women leaned back and closed their eyes. They yawned and wished  the journey would come to an end. If they thought of the town at all  they regretted it mildly and passed it off as a necessity of modern  life.    
The houses on the hillside and the stores along Main Street belonged  to the mining company. In its turn the mining company belonged to the  officials of the railroad. The manager of the mine had a brother who  was division superintendent. It was the mine manager who had stood by  the door of the mine when Cracked McGregor went to his death. He lived  in a city some thirty miles away, and went there in the evening on the  train. With him went the clerks and even the stenographers from the  offices of the mine. After five o'clock in the afternoon no white  collars were to be seen upon the streets of Coal Creek.    
In the town men lived like brutes. Dumb with toil they drank greedily  in the saloon on Main Street and went home to beat their wives. Among  them a constant low muttering went on. They felt the injustice of  their lot but could not voice it logically and when they thought of  the men who owned the mine they swore dumbly, using vile oaths even in  their thoughts. Occasionally a strike broke out and Barney Butterlips,  a thin little man with a cork leg, stood on a box and made speeches  regarding the coming brotherhood of man. Once a troop of cavalry was  unloaded from the cars and with a battery paraded the main street. The  battery was made up of several men in brown uniforms. They set up a  Gatling gun at the end of the street and the strike subsided.    
An Italian who lived in a house on the hillside cultivated a garden.  His place was the one beauty spot in the valley. With a wheelbarrow he  brought earth from the woods at the top of the hill and on Sunday he  could be seen going back and forth and whistling merrily. In the  winter he sat in his house making a drawing on a bit of paper. In the  spring he took the drawing, and by it planted his garden, utilising  every inch of his ground. When a strike came on he was told by the  mine manager to go on back to work or move out of his house. He  thought of the garden and the work he had done and went back to his  routine of work in the mine. While he worked the miners marched up the  hill and destroyed the garden. The next day the Italian also joined  the striking miners.    
In a little one-room shack on the hill lived an old woman. She lived  alone and was vilely dirty. In her house she had old broken chairs and  tables picked up about town and piled in such profusion that she could  scarcely move about. On warm days she sat in the sun before the shack  chewing on a stick that had been dipped in tobacco. Miners coming up  the hill dumped bits of bread and meat-ends out of their dinner-pails  into a box nailed to a tree by the road. These the old woman collected  and ate. When the soldiers came to town she walked along the street  jeering at them. "Pretty boys! Scabs! Dudes! Dry-goods clerks!" she  called after them as she walked by the tails of their horses. A young  man with glasses on his nose, who was mounted on a grey horse turned  and called to his comrades, "Let her alone--it's old Mother Misery  herself."    
When the tall red-haired boy looked at the workers and at the old  woman who followed the soldiers he did not sympathise with them. He  hated them. In a way he sympathised with the soldiers. His blood was  stirred by the sight of them marching shoulder to shoulder. He thought  there was order and decency in the rank of uniformed men moving  silently and quickly along and he half wished they would destroy the  town. When the strikers made a wreck of the garden of the Italian he  was deeply touched and walked up and down in the room before his  mother, proclaiming himself. "I would have killed them had it been my  garden," he said. "I would not have left one of them alive." In his  heart he like Cracked McGregor nursed his hatred of the miners and of  the town. "The place is one to get out of," he said. "If a man doesn't  like it here let him get up and leave." He remembered his father  working and saving for the farm in the valley. "They thought him  cracked but he knew more than they. They would not have dared touch a  garden he had planted."    
In the heart of the miner's son strange half-formed thoughts began to  find lodgings. Remembering in his dreams at night the moving columns  of men in their uniforms he read new meaning into the scraps of  history picked up in the school and the movements of men in old  history began to have significance for him. On a summer afternoon as  he loitered before the town's hotel, beneath which was the saloon and  billiard room where the black-haired boy worked, he overheard two men  talking of the significance of men.    
One of the men was an itinerant oculist who came to the mining town  once a month to fit and sell spectacles. When the oculist had sold  several pairs of spectacles he got drunk, sometimes staying drunk for  a week. When he was drunk he spoke French and Italian and sometimes  stood in the barroom before the miners, quoting the poems of Dante.  His clothes were greasy from long wear and he had a huge nose streaked  with red and purple veins. Because of his learning in the languages  and his quoting of poems the miners thought the oculist infinitely  wise. To them it seemed that one with such a mind must have almost  unearthly knowledge concerning the eyes and the fitting of glasses and  they wore with pride the cheap ill-fitting things he thrust upon them.    
Occasionally, as though making a concession to his patrons, the  oculist spent an evening among them. Once after reciting one of the  sonnets of Shakespeare he put a hand on the bar and rocking gently  back and forth sang in a drink-broken voice a ballad beginning "The  harp that once through Tara's halls the soul of music shed." After the  song he put his head down upon the bar and wept while the miners  looked on touched with sympathy.    
On the summer afternoon when Beaut McGregor listened, the oculist was  engaged in a violent quarrel with another man, drunk like himself. The  second man was a slender dandified fellow of middle age who sold shoes  for a Philadelphia jobbing-house. He sat in a chair tilted against the  hotel and tried to read aloud from a book. When he was fairly launched  in a long paragraph the oculist interrupted. Staggering up and down  the narrow board walk before the hotel the old drunkard raved and  swore. He seemed beside himself with wrath.    
"I am sick of such slobbering philosophy," he declared. "Even the  reading of it makes you drool at the mouth. You do not say the words  sharply, and they can't be said sharply. I'm a strong man myself."    
Spreading his legs wide apart and blowing up his cheeks, the oculist  beat upon his breast. With a wave of his hand he dismissed the man in  the chair.    
"You but slobber and make a foul noise," he declared. "I know your  kind. I spit upon you. The Congress at Washington is full of such  fellows as is also the House of Commons in England. In France they  were once in charge. They ran things in France until the coming of a  man such as myself. They were lost in the shadow of the great  Napoleon."    
The oculist as though dismissing the dandified man from his mind  turned to address Beaut. He talked in French and the man in the chair  fell into a troubled sleep. "I am like Napoleon," the drunkard  declared, breaking again into English. Tears began to show in his  eyes. "I take the money of these miners and I give them nothing. The  spectacles I sell to their wives for five dollars cost me but fifteen  cents. I ride over these brutes as Napoleon rode over Europe. There  would be order and purpose in me were I not a fool. I am like Napoleon  in that I have utter contempt for men."    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Again and again the words of the drunkard came back into the mind of  the McGregor boy influencing his thoughts. Grasping nothing of the  philosophy back of the man's words his imagination was yet touched by  the drunkard's tale of the great Frenchman, babbled into his ears, and  it in some way seemed to give point to his hatred of the disorganised  ineffectiveness of the life about him.

After Nance McGregor opened the bakery another strike came to disturb  the prosperity of the business. Again the miners walked idly through  the streets. Into the bakery they came to get bread and told Nance to  write the debt down against them. Beaut McGregor was disturbed. He saw  his father's money being spent for flour which when baked into loaves  went out of the shop under the arms of the miners who shuffled as they  walked. One night a man whose name appeared on their books followed by  a long record of charged loaves came reeling past the bakery. McGregor  went to his mother and protested. "They have money to get drunk," he  said, "let them pay for their loaves."    
Nance McGregor went on trusting the miners. She thought of the women  and children in the houses on the hill and when she heard of the plans  of the mining company to evict the miners from their houses she  shuddered. "I was the wife of a miner and I will stick to them," she  thought.    
One day the mine manager came into the bakery. He leaned over the  showcase and talked to Nance. The son went and stood by his mother's  side to listen. "It has got to be stopped," the manager was saying. "I  will not see you ruin yourself for these cattle. I want you to close  this place till the strike is over. If you won't close it I will. The  building belongs to us. They did not appreciate what your husband did  and why should you ruin yourself for them?"    
The woman looked at him and answered in a low tone full of resolution.  "They thought he was crazy and he was," she said; "but what made him  so--the rotten timbers in the mine that broke and crushed him. You and  not they are responsible for my man and what he was."    
Beaut McGregor interrupted. "Well I think he is right," he declared,  leaning over the counter beside his mother and looking into her face.  "The miners don't want better things for their families, they want  more money to get drunk. We will close the doors here. We will put no  more money into bread to go into their gullets. They hated father and  he hated them and now I hate them also."    
Beaut walked around the end of the counter and went with the mine  manager to the door. He locked it and put the key into his pocket.  Then he walked to the rear of the bake shop where his mother sat on a  box weeping. "It is time a man took charge here," he said.    
Nance McGregor and her son sat in the bakery and looked at each other.  Miners came along the street, tried the door and went away grumbling.  Word ran from lip to lip up the hillside. "The mine manager has closed  Nance McGregor's shop," said the women leaning over back fences.  Children sprawling on the floors of the houses put up their heads and  howled. Their lives were a succession of new terrors. When a day  passed that a new terror did not shake them they went to bed happy.  When the miner and his woman stood by the door talking in low tones  they cried, expecting to be put to bed hungry. When guarded talk did  not go on by the door the miner came home drunk and beat the mother  and the children lay in beds along the wall trembling with fright.    
Late that night a party of miners came to the door of the bakery and  beat upon it with their fists. "Open up here!" they shouted. Beaut  came out of the rooms above the bakery and stood in the empty shop.  His mother sat in a chair in her room and trembled. He went to the  door and unlocking it stepped out. The miners stood in groups on the  wooden sidewalk and in the mud of the road. Among them stood the old  crone who had walked beside the horses and shouted at the soldiers. A  miner with a black beard came and stood before the boy. Waving his  hand at the crowd he said, "We have come to open the bakery. Some of  us have no ovens in our stoves. You give us the key and we will open  the place. We will break in the door if you don't want to do that. The  company can't blame you if we do it by force. You can keep account of  what we take. Then when the strike is settled we will pay you."    
A flame shot into the eyes of the boy. He walked down the steps and  stood among the miners. Thrusting his hands into his pockets he peered  into their faces. When he spoke his voice resounded through the  street, "You jeered at my father, Cracked McGregor, when he went into  the mine for you. You laughed at him because he saved his money and  did not spend it buying you drinks. Now you come here to get bread his  money bought and you do not pay. Then you get drunk and go reeling  past this very door. Now let me tell you something." He thrust his  hands into the air and shouted. "The mine manager did not close this  place. I closed it. You jeered at Cracked McGregor, a better man than  any of you. You have had fun with me--laughing at me. Now I jeer at  you." He ran up the steps and unlocking the door stood in the doorway.  "Pay the money you owe this bakery and there will be bread for sale  here," he called, and went in and locked the door.    
The miners walked off up the street. The boy stood within the bakery,  his hands trembling. "I've told them something," he thought, "I've  shown them they can't make a fool of me." He went up the stairway to  the rooms above. By the window his mother sat, her head in her hands,  looking down into the street. He sat in a chair and thought of the  situation. "They will be back here and smash the place like they tore  up that garden," he said.    
The next evening Beaut sat in the darkness on the steps before the  bakery. In his hands he held a hammer. A dull hatred of the town and  of the miners burned in his brain. "I will make it hot for some of  them if they come here," he thought. He hoped they would come. As he  looked at the hammer in his hand a phrase from the lips of the drunken  old oculist babbling of Napoleon came into his mind. He began to think  that he also must be like the figure of which the drunkard had talked.  He remembered a story the oculist had told of a fight in the streets  of a European city and muttered and waved the hammer about. Upstairs  his mother sat by the window with her head in her hands. From the  saloon down the street a light gleamed out on the wet sidewalk. The  tall pale woman who had gone with him to the eminence overlooking the  valley came down the stairway from above the undertaker's shop. She  ran along the sidewalk. On her head she wore a shawl and as she ran  she clutched it with her hand. The other hand she held against her  side.    
When the women reached the boy who sat in silence before the bakery  she put her hands on his shoulders and plead with him. "Come away,"  she said. "Get your mother and come to our place. They're going to  smash you up here. You'll get hurt."    
Beaut arose and pushed her away. Her coming had given him new courage.  His heart jumped at the thought of her interest in him and he wished  that the miners might come so that he could fight them before her. "I  wish I could live among people as decent as she," he thought.    
A train stopped at the station down the street. There came the sound  of tramping of men and quick sharp commands. A stream of men poured  out of the saloon onto the sidewalk. Down the street came a file of  soldiers with guns swung across their shoulders. Again Beaut was  thrilled by the sight of trained orderly men moving along shoulder to  shoulder. In the presence of these men the disorganized miners seemed  pitifully weak and insignificant. The girl pulled the shawl about her  head and ran up the street to disappear into the stairway. The boy  unlocked the door and went upstairs and to bed.    
After the strike Nance McGregor who owned nothing but unpaid accounts  was unable to open the bakery. A small man with a white moustache, who  chewed tobacco, came from the mill and took the unused flour and  shipped it away. The boy and his mother continued living above the  bakery store room. Again she went in the morning to wash the windows  and scrub the floors in the offices of the mine and her red-haired son  stood upon the street or sat in the pool room and talked to the black-  haired boy. "Next week I'll be going to the city and will begin making  something of myself," he said. When the time came to go he waited and  idled in the streets. Once when a miner jeered at him for his idleness  he knocked him into the gutter. The miners who hated him for his  speech on the steps, admired him for his strength and brute courage.
