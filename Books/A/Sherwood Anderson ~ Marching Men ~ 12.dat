When McGregor had secured the place in the apple-warehouse and went  home to the house in Wycliff Place with his first week's pay, twelve  dollars, in his pocket he thought of his mother, Nance McGregor,  working in the mine offices in the Pennsylvania town and folding a  five dollar bill sent it to her in a letter. "I will begin to take  care of her now," he thought and with the rough sense of equity in  such matters, common to labouring people, had no intention of giving  himself airs. "She has fed me and now I will begin to feed her," he  told himself.    
The five dollars came back. "Keep it. I don't want your money," the  mother wrote. "If you have money left after your expenses are paid  begin to fix yourself up. Better get a new pair of shoes or a hat.  Don't try to take care of me. I won't have it. I want you to look out  for yourself. Dress well and hold up your head, that's all I ask. In  the city clothes mean a good deal. In the long run it will mean more  to me to see you be a real man than to be a good son."    
Sitting in her rooms over the vacant bake-shop in Coal Creek Nance  began to get new satisfaction out of the contemplation of herself as a  woman with a son in the city. In the evening she thought of him moving  along the crowded thoroughfares among men and women and her bent  little old figure straightened with pride. When a letter came telling  of his work in the night school her heart jumped and she wrote a long  letter filled with talk of Garfield and Grant and of Lincoln lying by  the burning pine knot reading his books. It seemed to her unbelievably  romantic that her son should some day be a lawyer and stand up in a  crowded court room speaking thoughts out of his brain to other men.  She thought that if this great red-haired boy, who at home had been so  unmanageable and so quick with his fists, was to end by being a man of  books and of brains then she and her man, Cracked McGregor, had not  lived in vain. A sweet new sense of peace came to her. She forgot her  own years of toil and gradually her mind went back to the silent boy  sitting on the steps with her before her house in the year after her  husband's death while she talked to him of the world, and thus she  thought of him, a quiet eager boy, going about bravely there in the  distant city.    
Death caught Nance McGregor off her guard. After one of her long days  of toil in the mine office she awoke to find him sitting grim and  expectant beside her bed. For years she in common with most of the  women of the coal town had been afflicted with what is called "trouble  with the heart." Now and then she had "bad spells." On this spring  evening she got into bed and sitting propped among the pillows fought  out her fight alone like a worn-out animal that has crept into a hole  in the woods.    
In the middle of the night the conviction came to her that she would  die. Death seemed moving about in the room and waiting for her. In the  street two drunken men stood talking, their voices concerned with  their own human affairs coming in through the window and making life  seem very near and dear to the dying woman. "I've been everywhere,"  said one of the men. "I've been in towns and cities I don't even  remember the names of. You ask Alex Fielder who keeps a saloon in  Denver. Ask him if Gus Lamont has been there."    
The other man laughed. "You've been in Jake's drinking too much beer,"  he jeered.    
Nance heard the two men stumble off down the street, the traveller  protesting against the unbelief of his friend. It seemed to her that  life with all of its colour sound and meaning was running away from  her presence. The exhaust of the engine over at the mine rang in her  ears. She thought of the mine as a great monster lying asleep below  the ground, its huge nose stuck into the air, its mouth open to eat  men. In the darkness of the room her coat, flung over the back of a  chair, took the shape and outline of a face, huge and grotesque,  staring silently past her into the sky.    
Nance McGregor gasped and struggled for breath. She clutched the  bedclothes with her hands and fought grimly and silently. She did not  think of the place to which she might go after death. She was trying  hard not to go there. It had been her habit of life to fight not to  dream dreams.    
Nance thought of her father, drunk and throwing his money about in the  old days before her marriage, of the walks she as a young girl had  taken with her lover on Sunday afternoons and of the times when they  had gone together to sit on the hillside overlooking the farming  country. As in a vision the dying woman saw the broad fertile land  spread out before her and blamed herself that she had not done more  toward helping her man in the fulfilment of the plans she and he had  made to go there and live. Then she thought of the night when her boy  came and of how, when they went to bring her man from the mine, they  found him apparently dead under the fallen timbers so that she thought  life and death had visited her hand in hand in one night.    
Nance sat stiffly up in bed. She thought she heard the sound of heavy  feet on the stairs. "That will be Beaut coming up from the shop," she  muttered and fell back upon the pillow dead.
