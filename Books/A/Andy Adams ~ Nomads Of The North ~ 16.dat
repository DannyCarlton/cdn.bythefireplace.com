  That same night, ten miles to the west, Miki slept under a   windfall of logs and treetops not more than half a mile from Le   Beau's trapline. 
  In the early dawn, when Le Beau left his cabin, accompanied by   Netah, The Killer, Miki came out from under his windfall after a   night of troublous dreams. He had dreamed of those first weeks  after  he had lost his master, when Neewa was always at his side;  and the  visions that had come to him filled him with an uneasiness  and a  loneliness that made him whine as he stood watching the dark  shadows  fading away before the coming of day. Could Le Beau have  seen him  there, as the first of the cold sun struck upon him, the  words which  he had repeated over and over to The Killer would have  stuck in his  throat. For at eleven months of age Miki was a young  giant of his  breed. He weighed sixty pounds, and none of that  sixty was fat. His  body was as slim and as lean as a wolf's. His  chest was massive, and  over it the muscles rolled like BABICHE  cord when he moved. His legs  were like the legs of Hela, the big  Mackenzie hound who was his  father; and with his jaws he could  crack a caribou bone as Le Beau  might have cracked it with a  stone. For eight of the eleven months of  his life the wilderness  had been his master; it had tempered him to  the hardness of living  steel; it had wrought him without abeyance to  age in the mould of  its pitiless schooling&#8212;had taught him to fight  for his life, to  kill that he might live, and to use his brain before  he used his  jaws. He was as powerful as Netah, The Killer, who was  twice his  age, and with his strength he possessed a cunning and a  quickness  which The Killer would never know. Thus had the raw  wilderness  prepared him for this day. 
  As the sun fired up the forest with a cold flame Miki set off in   direction of Le Beau's trapline. He came to where Le Beau had  passed  yesterday and sniffed suspiciously of the man-smell that  was still  strong in the snowshoe tracks. He had become accustomed  to this smell,  but he had not lost his suspicion of it. It was  repugnant to him, even  as it fascinated him. It filled him with an  inexplicable fear, and yet  he found himself powerless to run away  from it. Three times in the  last ten days he had seen the man-  brute himself. Once he had been  hiding within a dozen yards of Le  Beau when he passed. 
  This morning he headed straight for the swamp through which Le   Beau's traps were set. There the rabbits were thickest and it was  in  the swamp that they most frequently got in Jacques's KEKEKS&#8212;  the  little houses he built of sticks and cedar boughs to keep the  snow off  his baits. They were so numerous that they were a pest,  and each time  that Le Beau made his trip over the line he found at  least two out of  every three traps sprung by them, and therefore  made useless for the  catching of fur. But, where there were many  rabbits there were also  fishers and lynx, and in spite of the rage  which the plague of rabbits  sent him into, Le Beau continued to  set his traps there. And now, in  addition to the rabbits, he had  the wild dog to contend with. 
  His heart was fired by a vengeful anticipation as he hurried on   through the glow of the early sun, with The Killer at his heels,  led  by a BABICHE thong. Miki was nosing about the first trap-house  as  Netah and Le Beau entered the edge of the swamp, three miles to  the  east. 
  It was in this KEKEK that Miki had killed the fisher-cat the   previous morning. It was empty now. Even the bait-peg was gone,  and  there was no sign of a trap. A quarter of a mile farther on he  came to  a second trap-house, and this also was empty. He was a bit  puzzled.  And then he went on to the third house. He stood for  several minutes,  sniffing the air still more suspiciously, before  he drew close to it.  The man-tracks were thicker here. The snow  was beaten down with them,  and the scent of Le Beau was so strong  in the air that for a space  Miki believed he was near. Then he  advanced so that he got a look into  the door of the trap-house.  Squatted there, staring at him with big  round eyes, was a huge  snowshoe rabbit. A premonition of danger held  Miki back. It was  something in the attitude of Wapoos, the old rabbit.  He was not  like the others he had caught along Le Beau's line. He was  not  struggling in a trap; he was not stretched out, half frozen, and   he was not dangling at the end of a snare. He was all furred up  into  a warm and comfortable looking ball. As a matter of fact, Le  Beau had  caught him with his hands in a hollow log, and had tied  him to the  bait peg with a piece of buck-skin string; and after  that, just out of  Wapoos's reach, he had set a nest of traps and  covered them with snow. 
  Nearer and nearer to this menace drew Miki, in spite of the   unaccountable impulse that warned him to keep back. Wapoos,   fascinated by his slow and deadly advance, made no movement, but  sat  as if frozen into stone. Then Miki was at him. His powerful  jaws  closed with a crunch. In the same instant there came the  angry snap of  steel and a fisher-trap closed on one of his hind  feet. With a snarl  he dropped Wapoos and turned upon it, SNAP&#8212;  SNAP&#8212;SNAP went three  more of Jacques's nest of traps. Two of them  missed. The third caught  him by a front paw. As he had caught  Wapoos, and as he had killed the  fisher-cat, so now he seized this  new and savage enemy between his  jaws. His fangs crunched on the  cold steel; he literally tore it from  his paw so that blood  streamed forth and strained the snow red. Madly  he twisted himself  to get at his hind foot. On this foot the  fisher-trap had secured  a hold that was unbreakable. He ground it  between his jaws until  the blood ran from his mouth. He was fighting  it when Le Beau came  out from behind a clump of spruce twenty yards  away with The  Killer at his heels. 
  The Brute stopped. He was panting, and his eyes were aflame. Two   hundred yards away he had heard the clinking of the trap-chain. 
  &quot;OW! he is there,&quot; he gasped, tightening his hold on The Killer's   lead thong. &quot;He is there, Netah, you Red Eye! That is the robber   devil you are to kill&#8212;almost. I will unfasten you, and then&#8212;GO  TO!&quot; 
  Miki, no longer fighting the trap, was eyeing them as they   advanced. In this moment of peril he felt no fear of the man. In  his  veins the hot blood raged with a killing madness. The truth  leapt upon  him in a flash of instinctive awakening. These two were  his enemies  instead of the thing on his foot&#8212;the man-beast, and  Netah, The  Killer. He remembered&#8212;as if it were yesterday. This  was not the first  time he had seen a man with a club in his hand.  And Le Beau held a  club. But he was not afraid. His steady eyes  watched Netah. Unleashed  by his master, The Killer stood on stiff  legs a dozen feet away, the  wiry crest along his spine erect, his  muscles tense. 
  Miki heard the man-beast's voice. 
  &quot;Go to, you devil! GO TO!&quot; 
  Miki waited, without the quiver of a muscle. Thus much he had   learned of his hard lessons in the wilderness&#8212;to wait, and watch,   and use his cunning. He was flat on his belly, his nose between  his  forepaws. His lips were drawn back a little, just a little;  but he  made no sound, and his eyes were as steady as two points of  flame. Le  Beau stared. He felt suddenly a new thrill, and it was  not the thrill  of his desire for vengeance. Never had he seen a  lynx or a fox or a  wolf in a trap like that. Never had he seen a  dog with eyes like the  eyes that were on Netah. For a moment he  held his breath. 
  Foot by foot, and then almost inch by inch, The Killer crept in.   Ten feet, eight, six&#8212;and all that time Miki made no move, never   winked an eye. With a snarl like that of a tiger, Netah came at  him. 
  What happened then was the most marvellous thing that Jacques Le   Beau had ever seen. So swiftly that his eyes could scarcely follow   the movement, Miki had passed like a flash under the belly of  Netah,  and turning then at the end of his trap chain he was at The  Killer's  throat before Le Beau could have counted ten. They were  down, and The  Brute gripped the club in his hand and stared like  one fascinated. He  heard the grinding crunch of jaws, and he knew  they were the Wild  Dog's jaws; he heard a snarl choking slowly  into a wheezing sob of  agony, and he knew that the sound came from  The Eller. The blood rose  into his face. The red fire in his eyes  grew livid&#8212;a blaze of  exultation, of triumph. 
  &quot;TONNERRE DE DIEU! he is choking the life out of Netah!&quot; he   gasped. &quot;NON, I have never seen a dog like that. I will keep him   alive; and he shall fight Durant's POOS over at Post Fort O' God!  By  the belly of Saint Gris, I say&#8212;&quot; 
  The Killer was as good as dead if left another minute. With   upraised club Le Beau advanced. As he sank his fangs deeper into   Netah's throat Miki saw the new danger out of the corner of his  eye.  He loosed his jaws and swung himself free of The Killer as  the club  descended. He only partly evaded the smashing blow, which  caught him  on the shoulder and knocked him down. Quick as a flash  he was on his  feet and had lunged at Le Beau. The Frenchman was a  master with the  club. All his life he had used it, and he brought  it around in a  sudden side-swing that landed with terrific force  against Miki's head.  The blood spurted from his mouth and  nostrils. He was dazed and half  blinded. He leapt again, and the  club caught him once more. He heard  Le Beau's ferocious cry of  joy. A third, a fourth, and a fifth time he  went down under the  club, and Le Beau no longer laughed, but swung his  weapon with a  look that was half fear in his eyes. The sixth time the  club  missed, and Miki's jaws closed against The Brute's chest, ripping   away the thick coat and shirt as if they had been of paper, and   leaving on Le Beau's skin a bleeding gash. Ten inches more&#8212;a  little  better vision in his blood-dimmed eyes&#8212;and he would have  reached the  man's throat. A great cry rose out of Le Beau. For an  instant he felt  the appalling nearness of death. 
  &quot;Netah! Netah!&quot; he cried, and swung the club wildly. 
  Netah did not respond. It may be that in this moment he sensed the   fact that it was his master who had made him into a monster. About   him was the wilderness, opening its doors of freedom. When Le Beau   called again The Killer was slinking away, dripping blood as he   went&#8212;and this was the last that Le Beau saw of him. Probably he   joined the wolves, for The Killer was a quarter-strain wild. 
  Le Beau got no more than a glimpse of him as he disappeared. His   club-arm shot out again, a clean miss; and this time it was pure   chance that saved him. The trap-chain caught, and Miki fell back  when  his hot breath was almost at The Brute's jugular. He fell  upon his  side. Before he could recover himself the club was  pounding his head  into the snow. The world grew black. He no  longer had the power to  move. Lying as if dead he still heard over  him the panting, exultant  voice of the man-beast. For Le Beau,  black though his heart was, could  not keep back a prayerful cry of  thankfulness that he was victor&#8212;and  had missed death, though by a  space no wider than the link of a chain.
