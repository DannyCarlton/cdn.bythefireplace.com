  In the cabin David waited. He did not look through the window to   watch St. Pierre's approach. He sat down and picked up a magazine   from the table upon which Marie-Anne's work-basket lay. He was  cool  as ice now. His blood flowed evenly and his pulse beat  unhurriedly.  Never had he felt himself more his own master, more  like grappling  with a situation. St. Pierre was coming to fight.  He had no doubt of  that. Perhaps not physically, at first. But,  one way or another,  something dynamic was bound to happen in the  bateau cabin within the  next half-hour. Now that the impending  drama was close at hand,  Carrigan's scheme of luring St. Pierre  into the making of a stupendous  wager seemed to him rather  ridiculous. With calculating coldness he  was forced to concede  that St. Pierre would be somewhat of a fool to  accept the wager he  had in mind, when he was so completely in St.  Pierre's power. For  Marie-Anne and the chief of the Boulains, the  bottom of the river  would undoubtedly be the best and easiest  solution, and the half-  breed's suggestion might be acted upon after  all. 
  As his mind charged itself for the approaching struggle, David   found himself staring at a double page in the magazine, given up   entirely to impossibly slim young creatures exhibiting certain  bits  of illusive and mysterious feminine apparel. Marie-Anne had  expressed  her approbation in the form of pencil notes under  several of them.  Under a cobwebby affair that wreathed one of the  slim figures he read,  &quot;St. Pierre will love this!&quot; There were two  exclamation points after  that particular notation! 
  David replaced the magazine on the table and looked toward the   door. No, St. Pierre would not hesitate to put him at the bottom  of  the river, for her. Not if he, Dave Carrigan, made the solution  of the  matter a necessity. There were times, he told himself, when  it was  confoundedly embarrassing to force the letter of the law.  And this was  one of them. He was not afraid of the river bottom.  He was thinking  again of Marie-Anne. 
  The scraping of a canoe against the side of the bateau recalled   him suddenly to the moment at hand. He heard low voices, and one  of  them, he knew, was St. Pierre's. For an interval the voices  continued,  frequently so low that he could not distinguish them at  all. For ten  minutes he waited impatiently. Then the door swung  open, and St.  Pierre came in. 
  Slowly and coolly David rose to meet him, and at the same moment   the chief of the Boulains closed the door behind him. There was no   greeting in Carrigan's manner. He was the Law, waiting, unexcited,   sure of himself, impassive as a thing of steel. He was ready to   fight. He expected to fight. It only remained for St. Pierre to  show  what sort of fight it was to be. And he was amazed at St.  Pierre,  without betraying that amazement. In the vivid light that  shot through  the western windows the chief of the Boulains stood  looking at David.  He wore a gray flannel shirt open at the throat,  and it was a splendid  throat David saw, and a splendid head above  it, with its reddish beard  and hair. But what he saw chiefly were  St. Pierre's eyes. They were  the sort of eyes he disliked to find  in an enemy&#8212;a grayish, steely  blue that reflected sunlight like  polished flint. But there was no  flash of battle-glow in them now.  St. Pierre was neither excited nor  in a bad humor. Nor did  Carrigan's attitude appear to disturb him in  the least. He was  smiling; his eyes glowed with almost boyish  curiosity as he stared  appraisingly at David&#8212;and then, slowly, a low  chuckle of laughter  rose in his deep chest, and he advanced with an  outstretched hand. 
  &quot;I am St. Pierre Boulain,&quot; he said. &quot;I have heard a great deal   about you, Sergeant Carrigan. You have had an unfortunate time!&quot; 
  Had the man advanced menacingly, David would have felt more   comfortable. It was disturbing to have this giant come to him with  an  extended hand of apparent friendship when he had anticipated an   entirely different sort of meeting. And St. Pierre was laughing at   him! There was no doubt of that. And he had the colossal nerve to   tell him that he had been unfortunate, as though being shot up by   somebody's wife was a fairly decent joke! 
  Carrigan's attitude did not change. He did not reach out a hand to   meet the other. There was no responsive glimmer of humor in his  eyes  or on his lips. And seeing these things, St. Pierre turned  his  extended hand to the open box of cigars, so that he stood for  a moment  with his back toward him. 
  &quot;It's funny,&quot; he said, as if speaking to himself, and with only a   drawling note of the French patois in his voice. &quot;I come home,  find  my Jeanne in a terrible mix-up, a stranger in her room&#8212;and  the  stranger refuses to let me laugh or shake hands with him.  Tonnerre, I  say it is funny! And my Jeanne saved his life, and  made him muffins,  and gave him my own bed, and walked with him in  the forest! Ah, the  ungrateful cochon!&quot; 
  He turned, laughing openly, so that his deep voice filled the   cabin. &quot;Vous aves de la corde de pendu, m'sieu&#8212;yes, you are a  lucky  dog! For only one other man in the world would my Jeanne  have done  that. You are lucky because you were not ended behind  the rock; you  are lucky because you are not at the bottom of the  river; you are  lucky&#8212;&quot; 
  He shrugged his big shoulders hopelessly. &quot;And now, after all our   kindness and your good luck, you wait for me like an enemy,  m'sieu.  Diable, I can not understand!&quot; 
  For the life of him Carrigan could not, in these few moments,   measure up his man. He had said nothing. He had let St. Pierre  talk.  And now St. Pierre stood there, one of the finest men he had  ever  looked upon, as if honestly overcome by a great wonder. And  yet behind  that apparent incredulity in his voice and manner David  sensed the  deep underflow of another thing. St. Pierre was all  that Marie-Anne  had claimed for him, and more. She had given him  assurance of her  unlimited confidence that her husband could  adjust any situation in  the world, and Carrigan conceded that St.  Pierre measured up  splendidly to that particular type of man. The  smile had not left his  face; the good humor was still in his eyes. 
  David smiled back at him coldly. He recognized the cleverness of   the other's play. St. Pierre was a man who would smile like that  even  as he fought, and Carrigan loved a smiling fighter, even when  he had  to slip steel bracelets over his wrists. 
  &quot;I am Sergeant Carrigan, of 'N' Division, Royal Northwest Mounted   Police,&quot; he said, repeating the formula of the law. &quot;Sit down, St.   Pierre, and I will tell you a few things that have happened. And   then&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Non, non, it is not necessary, m'sieu. I have already listened   for an hour, and I do not like to hear a story twice. You are of  the  Police. I love the Police. They are brave men, and brave men  are my  brothers. You are out after Roger Audemard, the rascal! Is  it not so?  And you were shot at behind the rock back there. You  were almost  killed. Ma foi, and it was my Jeanne who did the  shooting! Yes, she  thought you were another man.&quot; The chuckling,  drum-like note of  laughter came again out of St. Pierre's great  chest. &quot;It was bad  shooting. I have taught her better, but the sun  was blinding there in  the hot, white sand. And after that&#8212;I know  everything that has  happened. Bateese was wrong. I shall scold him  for wanting to put you  at the bottom of the river&#8212;perhaps. Oui,  ce que femme veut, Dieu le  veut&#8212;that is it. A woman must have her  way, and my Jeanne's gentle  heart was touched because you were a  brave and handsome man, M'sieu  Carrigan. But I am not jealous.  Jealousy is a worm that does not make  friendship! And we shall be  friends. Only as a friend could I take you  to the Chateau Boulain,  far up on the Yellowknife. And we are going  there.&quot; 
  In spite of what might have been the entirely proper thing to do   at this particular moment, Carrigan's face broke into a smile as  he  drew a second chair up close to the table. He was swift to  readjust  himself. It came suddenly back to him how he had grinned  behind the  rock, when death seemed close at hand. And St. Pierre  was like that  now. David measured him again as the chief of the  Boulains sat down  opposite him. Such a man could not be afraid of  anything on the face  of the earth, even of the Law. The gleam that  lay in his eyes told  David that as they met his own over the  table. &quot;We are smiling now  because it happens to please us,&quot; David  read in them. &quot;But in a  moment, if it is necessary, we shall  fight.&quot; 
  Carrigan leaned a little over the table. &quot;You know we are not   going to the Chateau Boulain, St. Pierre,&quot; he said. &quot;We are going  to  stop at Fort McMurray, and there you and your wife must answer  for a  number of things that have happened. There is one way out&#8212;  possibly.  That is largely up to you. Why did your wife try to kill  me behind the  rock? And what did you know about Black Roger  Audemard?&quot; 
  St. Pierre's eyes did not for an instant leave Carrigan's face.   Slowly a change came into them; the smile faded, the blue went  out,  and up from behind seemed to come another pair of eyes that  were hard  as steel and cold as ice. Yet they were not eyes that  threatened, nor  eyes that betrayed excitement or passion. And St.  Pierre's voice, when  he spoke, lacked the deep and vibrant note  that had been in it. It was  as if he had placed upon it the force  of a mighty will, chaining it  back, just as something hidden and  terrible lay chained behind his  eyes. 
  &quot;Why play like little children, M'sieu Carrigan?&quot; he asked. &quot;Why   not come out squarely, honestly, like men? I know what has  happened.  Mon Dieu, it was bad! You were almost killed, and you  heard that poor  wreck, Andre, call for Roger Audemard. My Jeanne  has told you about  that&#8212;how I found him in the forest with his  broken mind and body. And  about my Jeanne&#8212;&quot; St. Pierre's fists  grew into knotted lumps on the  table. &quot;Non, I will die&#8212;I will  kill you&#8212;before I will tell you why  she shot at you behind the  rock! We are men, both of us. We are not  afraid. And you&#8212;in my  place&#8212;what would YOU do, m'sieu?&quot; 
  In the moment's silence each man looked steadily at the other. 
  &quot;I would&#8212;fight,&quot; said David slowly. &quot;If it was for her, I am   pretty sure I would fight.&quot; 
  He believed that he was drawing the net in now, that it would   catch St. Pierre. He leaned a little farther over the table. 
  &quot;And I, too, must fight,&quot; he added. &quot;You know our law, St. Pierre.   We don't go back without our man&#8212;unless we happen to die. And I   would be stupid if I did not understand the situation here. It  would  be quite easy for you to get rid of me. But I don't believe  you are a  murderer, even if your Jeanne tried to be.&quot; A flicker of  a smile  crossed his lips. &quot;And Marie-Anne&#8212;I beg pardon!&#8212;your  wife&#8212;&quot; 
  St. Pierre interrupted him. &quot;It will please me to have you call   her Marie-Anne. And it will please her also, m'sieu. Dieu, if we  only  had eyes that could see what is in a woman's heart! Life is  funny,  m'sieu. It is a great joke, I swear it on my soul!&quot; 
  He shrugged his shoulders, smiling again straight into David's   eyes. &quot;See what has happened! You set out for a murderer. My  Jeanne  makes a great mistake and shoots you. Then she pities you,  saves your  life, brings you here, and&#8212;ma foi! it is true&#8212;learns  to care for you  more than she should! But that does not make me  want to kill you. Non,  her happiness is mine. Dead men tell no  tales, m'sieu, but there are  times when living men also keep tales  to themselves. And that is what  you are going to do, M'sieu  Carrigan. You are going to keep to  yourself the thing that  happened behind the rock. You are going to  keep to yourself the  mumblings of our poor mad Andre. Never will they  pass your lips. I  know. I swear it. I stake my life on it!&quot; St. Pierre  was talking  slowly and unexcitedly. There was an immeasurable  confidence in  his deep voice. It did not imply a threat or a warning.  He was  sure of himself. And his eyes had deepened into blue again and   were almost friendly. 
  &quot;You would stake your life?&quot; repeated Carrigan questioningly. &quot;You   would do that?&quot; 
  St. Pierre rose to his feet and looked about the cabin with a   shining light in his eyes that was both pride and exaltation. He   moved toward the end of the room, where the piano stood, and for a   moment his big fingers touched the keys; then, seeing the lacy bit  of  handkerchief that lay there, he picked it up&#8212;and placed it  back  again. Carrigan did not urge his question, but waited. In  spite of his  effort to fight it down he found himself in the grip  of a mysterious  and growing thrill as he watched St. Pierre. Never  had the presence of  another man had the same effect upon him, and  strangely the thought  came to him that he was matched&#8212;even  overmatched. It was as if St.  Pierre had brought with him into the  cabin something more than the  splendid strength of his body, a  thing that reached out in the  interval of silence between them,  warning Carrigan that all the law in  the world would not swerve  the chief of the Boulains from what was  already in his mind. For a  moment the thought passed from David that  fate had placed him up  against the hazard of enmity with St. Pierre.  His vision centered  in the man alone. And as he, too, rose to his  feet, an unconscious  smile came to his lips as he recalled the  boastings of Bateese. 
  &quot;I ask you,&quot; said he, &quot;if you would really stake your life in a   matter such as that? Of course, if your words were merely  accidental,  and meant nothing&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;If I had a dozen lives, I would stake them, one on top of the   other, as I have said,&quot; interrupted St. Pierre. Suddenly his laugh   boomed out and his voice became louder. &quot;M'sieu Carrigan, I have  come  to offer you just that test! Oui, I could kill you now. I  could put  you at the bottom of the river, as Bateese thinks is  right. Mon Dieu,  how completely I could make you disappear! And  then my Jeanne would be  safe. She would not go behind prison bars.  She would go on living, and  laughing, and singing in the big  forests, where she belongs. And Black  Roger Audemard, the rascal,  would be safe for a time! But that would  be like destroying a  little child. You are so helpless now. So you are  going on to the  Chateau Boulain with us, and if at the end of the  second month  from today you do not willingly say I have won my  wager&#8212;why&#8212;  m'sieu&#8212;I will go with you into the forest, and you may  shoot out  of me the life which is my end of the gamble. Is that not  fair?  Can you suggest a better way&#8212;between men like you and me?&quot; 
  &quot;I can at least suggest a way that has the virtue of saving time,&quot;   replied David. &quot;First, however, I must understand my position  here. I  am, I take it, a prisoner.&quot; 
  &quot;A guest, with certain restrictions placed upon you, m'sieu,&quot;   corrected St. Pierre. 
  The eyes of the two men met on a dead level. 
  &quot;Tomorrow morning I am going to fight Bateese,&quot; said David. &quot;It is   a little sporting event we have fixed up between us for the  amusement  of&#8212;your men. I have heard that Bateese is the best  fighting man along  the Three Rivers. And I&#8212;I do not like to have  any other man claim  that distinction when I am around.&quot; 
  For the first time St. Pierre's placidity seemed to leave him. His   brow became clouded, a moment's frown grew in his face, and there  was  a certain disconsolate hopelessness in the shrug of his  shoulders. It  was as if Carrigan's words had suddenly robbed the  day of all its  sunshine for the chief of the Boulains. His voice,  too, carried an  unhappy and disappointed note as he made a gesture  toward the window. 
  &quot;M'sieu, on that raft out there are many of my men, and they have   scarcely rested or slept since word was brought to them that a   stranger was to fight Concombre Bateese. Tonnerre, they have  gambled  without ever seeing you until the clothes on their backs  are in the  hazard, and they have cracked their muscles in labor to  overtake you!  They have prayed away their very souls that it would  be a good fight,  and that Bateese would not eat you up too  quickly. It has been a long  time since we have seen a good fight,  a long time since the last man  dared to stand up against the half-  breed. Ugh, it tears out my heart  to tell you that the fight can  not be!&quot; 
  St. Pierre made no effort to suppress his emotion. He was like a   huge, disappointed boy. He walked to the window, peered forth at  the  raft, and as he shrugged his big shoulders again something  like a  groan came from him. 
  The thrill of approaching triumph swept through David's blood. The   flame of it was in his eyes when St. Pierre turned from the  window. 
  &quot;And you are disappointed, St. Pierre? You would like to see that   fight!&quot; 
  The blue steel in St. Pierre's eyes flashed back. &quot;If the price   were a year of my life, I would give it&#8212;if Bateese did not eat  you  up too quickly. I love to look upon a good fight, where there  is no  venom of hatred in the blows!&quot; 
  &quot;Then you shall see a good fight, St. Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;Bateese would kill you, m'sieu. You are not big. You are not his   match.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall whip him, St. Pierre&#8212;whip him until he avows me his   master.&quot; 
  &quot;You do not know the half-breed, m'sieu. Twice I have tried him in   friendly combat myself and have been beaten.&quot; 
  &quot;But I shall whip him,&quot; repeated Carrigan. &quot;I will wager you   anything&#8212;anything in the world&#8212;even life against life&#8212;that I  whip  him!&quot; 
  The gloom had faded from the face of St. Pierre Boulain. But in a   moment it clouded again. 
  &quot;My Jeanne has made me promise that I will stop the fight,&quot; he   said. 
  &quot;And why&#8212;why should she insist in a matter such as this, which   properly should be settled among men?&quot; asked David. 
  Again St. Pierre laughed; with an effort, it seemed, &quot;She is   gentle-hearted, m'sieu. She laughed and thought it quite a joke  when  Bateese humbled me. 'What! My great St. Pierre, with the  blood of old  France in his veins, beaten by a man who has been  named after a  vegetable!' she cried. I tell you she was merry over  it, m'sieu! She  laughed until the tears came into her eyes. But  with you it is  different. She was white when she entreated me not  to let you fight  Bateese. Yes, she is afraid you will be badly  hurt. And she does not  want to see you hurt again. But I tell you  that I am not jealous,  m'sieu! She does not try to hide things  from me. She tells me  everything, like a little child. And so&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I am going to fight Bateese,&quot; said David. He wondered if St.   Pierre could hear the thumping of his heart, or if his face gave   betrayal of the hot flood it was pumping through his body.  &quot;Bateese  and I have pledged ourselves. We shall fight, unless you  tie one of us  hand and foot. And as for a wager&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;what have you to wager?&quot; demanded St. Pierre eagerly. 
  &quot;You know the odds are great,&quot; temporized Carrigan. 
  &quot;That I concede, m'sieu.&quot; 
  &quot;But a fight without a wager would be like a pipe without tobacco,   St. Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;You speak truly, m'sieu.&quot; 
  David came nearer and laid a hand on the other's arm. &quot;St. Pierre,   I hope you&#8212;and your Jeanne&#8212;will understand what I am about to   offer. It is this. If Bateese whips me, I will disappear into the   forests, and no word shall ever pass my lips of what has passed  since  that hour behind the rock&#8212;and this. No whisper of it will  ever reach  the Law. I will forget the attempted murder and the  suspicious  mumblings of your Broken Man. You will be safe. Your  Jeanne will be  safe&#8212;if Bateese whips me.&quot; 
  He paused, and waited. St. Pierre made no answer, but amazement   came into his face, and after that a slow and burning fire in his   eyes which told how deeply and vitally Carrigan's words had struck   into his soul. 
  &quot;And if I should happen to win,&quot; continued David, turning a bit   carelessly toward the window, &quot;why, I should expect as large a   payment from you. If I win, your fulfillment of the wager will be  to  tell me in every detail why your wife tried to kill me behind  the  rock, and you will also tell me all that you know about the  man I am  after, Black Roger Audemard. That is all. I am asking for  no odds,  though you concede the handicap is great.&quot; 
  He did not look at St. Pierre. Behind him he heard the other's   deep breathing. For a space neither spoke. Outside they could hear   the soft swish of water, the low voices of men in the stern, and a   shout and the barking of a dog coming from the raft far out on the   river. For David the moment was one of suspense. He turned again,  a  bit carelessly, as if his proposition were a matter of but  little  significance to him. St. Pierre was not looking at him. He  was staring  toward the door, as if through it he could see the  powerful form of  Bateese bending over the stern sweep. And  Carrigan could see that his  face was flaming with a great desire,  and that the blood in his body  was pounding to the mighty urge of  it. 
  Suddenly he faced Carrigan. 
  &quot;M'sieu, listen to me,&quot; he said. &quot;You are a brave man. You are a   man of honor, and I know you will bury sacredly in your heart what  I  am going to tell you now, and never let a word of it escape&#8212;  even to  my Jeanne. I do not blame you for loving her. Non! You  could not help  that. You have fought well to keep it within  yourself, and for that I  honor you. How do I know? Mon Dieu, she  has told me! A woman's heart  understands, and a woman's ears are  quick to hear, m'sieu. When you  were sick, and your mind was  wandering, you told her again and again  that you loved her&#8212;and  when she brought you back to life, her eyes  saw more than once the  truth of what your lips had betrayed, though  you tried to keep it  to yourself. Even more, m'sieu&#8212;she felt the  touch of your lips on  her hair that day. She understands. She has told  me everything,  openly, innocently&#8212;yet her heart thrills with that  sympathy of a  woman who knows she is loved. M'sieu, if you could have  seen the  light in her eyes and the glow in her cheeks as she told me  these  secrets. But I am not jealous! Non! It is only because you are a   brave man, and one of honor, that I tell you all this. She would  die  of shame did she know I had betrayed her confidence. Yet it is   necessary that I tell you, because if we make the big wager we  must  drop my Jeanne from the gamble. Do you comprehend me, m'sieu? 
  &quot;We are two men, strong men, fighting men. I&#8212;Pierre Boulain&#8212;can   not feel the shame of jealousy where a woman's heart is pure and   sweet, and where a man has fought against love with honor as you  have  fought. And you, m'sieu&#8212;David Carrigan, of the Police&#8212;can  not strike  with your hard man's hand that tender heart, that is  like a flower,  and which this moment is beating faster than it  should with the fear  that some harm is going to befall you. Is it  not so, m'sieu? We will  make the wager, yes. But if you whip  Bateese&#8212;and you can not do that  in a hundred years of fighting&#8212;I  will not tell you why my Jeanne shot  at you behind the rock. Non,  never! Yet I swear I will tell you the  other. If you win, I will  tell you all I know about Roger Audemard,  and that is  considerable, m'sieu. Do you agree?&quot; 
  Slowly David held out a hand. St. Pierre's gripped it. The fingers   of the two men met like bands of steel. 
  &quot;Tomorrow you will fight,&quot; said St. Pierre. &quot;You will fight and be   beaten so terribly that you may always show the marks of it. I am   sorry. Such a man as you I would rather have as a brother than an   enemy. And she will never forgive me. She will always remember it.   The thought will never die out of her heart that I was a beast to  let  you fight Bateese. But it is best for all. And my men? Ah!  Diable, but  it will be great sport for them, m'sieu!&quot; 
  His hand unclasped. He turned to the door. A moment later it   closed behind him, and David was alone. He had not spoken. He had  not  replied to the engulfing truths that had fallen quietly and  without a  betrayal of passion from St. Pierre's lips. Inwardly he  was crushed.  Yet his face was like stone, hiding his shame. And  then, suddenly,  there came a sound from outside that sent the  blood through his cold  veins again. It was laughter, the great,  booming laughter of St.  Pierre! It was not the merriment of a man  whose heart was bleeding, or  into whose life had come an  unexpected pain or grief. It was wild and  free, and filled with  the joy of the sun-filled day. 
  And David, listening to it, felt something that was more than   admiration for this man growing within him. And unconsciously his   lips repeated St. Pierre's words. 
  &quot;Tomorrow&#8212;you will fight.&quot;
