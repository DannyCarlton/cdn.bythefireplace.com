  The long stay in the windrow served Robert well, more than atoning  for the drain made upon his strength by their rapid flight. In three or  four hours he was back in his normal state, and he felt proudly that he  was now as good as he had ever been. The night, as they had expected,  was cold, and he was thankful that he had hung on to the buffalo robe,  in which he wrapped himself once more, while Tayoga was snug between  two big blankets.
  Robert dozed, but he was awakened by something stirring near them,  and he sat up with his finger on the trigger of his rifle. The Onondaga  was already listening and watching, ready with his weapon. Presently  the white youth heard his companion laughing softly, and his own  tension relaxed, as he knew Tayoga would not laugh without good cause.
  &#8220;It is a bear,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and he has a lair in the windrow, not  more than twenty feet away. He has been out very late at night, too  late for a good, honest home-keeping bear, but he is back at last, and  he smells us.&#8221;
  &#8220;And alarmed by the odor he does not know whether to enter his home  or not. Well, I hope he'll conclude to take his rest. We eat bear at  times, Tayoga, but just now I wouldn't dream of harming one.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor would I, Dagaeoga, and maybe the bear will divine that we are  harmless, that is, Tododaho or Areskoui will tell him in some way of  which we know nothing that his home is his own to be entered without  fear.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I hear him moving now, and also puffing a little.&#8221;
  &#8220;You hear aright, Dagaeoga. Tododaho has whispered to him, even as I  said, and he is going into his den which I know is snug and warm, in  the very thickest part of the windrow. Now he is lying down in it with  the logs and branches about him, and soon he will be asleep, dreaming  happy dreams of tender roots and wild honey with no stings of bees to  torment him.&#8221;
  &#8220;You grow quite poetical, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;Although foes are hunting us, I feel the spirit of the forest and  of peace strong upon me, Dagaeoga. Moreover, Tododaho, as I told you,  has whispered to the animals that we are not to be feared tonight. Hark  to the tiny rustling just beyond the log against which we lie!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I hear it, and what do you make of it, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Rabbits seeking their nests. They, too, have snuffed about,  noticing the man odor, which man himself cannot detect, and once they  started away in alarm, but now they are reassured, and they have  settled themselves down to sleep in comfort and security.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, you talk well and fluently, but as I have told you before,  you talk out of a dictionary.&#8221;
  &#8220;But as I learned my English out of a dictionary I cannot talk  otherwise. That is why my language is always so much superior to yours,  Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll let it be as you claim it, you boaster, but what noise is that  now? I seem to hear the light sound of hoofs.&#8221;
  The Onondaga raised himself to his full height and peered over the  dense masses of trunks and boughs, his keen eyes cutting the thick  dusk. Then he sank back, and, when he replied, his voice showed  distinct pleasure.
  &#8220;Two deer have come into a little open space, around which the arms  of the windrow stretch nearly all the way, and they have crouched  there, where they will rest, indifferent to the nearness of the bear.  Truly, O Dagaeoga, we have come into the midst of a happy family, and  we have been accepted, for the night, as members of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must be so, Tayoga, because I see a figure much larger than that  of the deer approaching. Look to the north and behold that shadow there  under the trees.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see it, Dagaeoga. It is the great northern moose, a bull. Perhaps  he has wandered down from Canada, as they are rare here. They are often  quarrelsome, but the bull is going to take his rest, within the shelter  of the windrow, and leave its other people at peace. Now he has found a  good place, and he will be quiet for the night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you sleep a while, Tayoga. You have done all the watching  for a long time, and, as I'm fit and fine now, it's right for me to  take up my share of the burden.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very well, but do not fail to awaken me in about three hours. We  must not be caught here in the morning by the warriors.&#8221;
  He was asleep almost instantly, and Robert sat in a comfortable  position with his rifle across his knees. Responsibility brought back  to him self-respect and pride. He was now a full partner in the  partnership, and will and strength together made his faculties so keen  that it would have been difficult for anything about the windrow to  have escaped his attention. He heard the light rustlings of other  animals coming to comfort and safety, and flutterings as birds settled  on upthrust boughs, many of which were still covered with leaves. Once  he heard a faint shout deep in the forest, brought by the wind a great  distance, and he was sure that it was the cry of their Indian pursuers.  Doubtless it was a signal and had connection with the search, but he  felt no alarm. Under the cover of darkness Tayoga and he were still  motes in the wilderness, and, while the night lasted, Tandakora could  not find them.
  When he judged that the three hours had passed he awoke the Onondaga  and they took their silent way north by east, covering much more  distance by dawn. But both were certain that warriors of Tandakora  would pick up their traces again that day. They would spread through  the forest, and, when one of them struck the trail, a cry would be  sufficient to call the others. But they pressed on, still adopting  every possible device to throw off their pursuers, and they continued  their flight several days, always through an unbroken forest, over  hills and across many streams, large and small. It seemed, at times, to  Robert that the pursuit must have dropped away, but Tayoga was quite  positive that Tandakora still followed. The Ojibway, he said, had  divined the identity of the fugitives and every motive would make him  follow, even all the way across the Province of New York and beyond, if  need be.
  They came at last to a lake, large, beautiful, extending many miles  through the wilderness, and Tayoga, usually so calm, uttered a little  cry of delight, which Robert repeated, but in fuller volume.
  &#8220;I think lakes are the finest things in the world,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They  always stir me.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that is why Manitou put so many and such splendid ones in the  land of the Hodenosaunee,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;This is Ganoatohale, which you  call in your language Oneida, and it is on its shores that I hid the  canoe of which I spoke to you. I think we shall find it just as I left  it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I devoutly hope so. A canoe and paddles would give me much pleasure  just now, and Ganoatohale will leave no trail.&#8221;
  They walked northward along the shore of the lake, and they came to  a place where many tall reeds grew thick and close in shallow water.  Tayoga plunged into the very heart of them and Robert's heart rose with  a bound, when he reappeared dragging after him a large and strong  canoe, containing two paddles.
  &#8220;It has rested in quiet waiting for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a good  canoe, and it knew that I would come some time to claim it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Before we go upon our voyage,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;I think we shall have  to pay some attention to the question of food. My pouch is about  empty.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so is mine. We shall have to take the risk, Dagaeoga, and shoot  a deer. Tandakora may be so far behind that none of his warriors will  hear the shot, but even so we cannot live without eating. We will,  however, hunt from the canoe. Since the war began, all human beings  have gone away from this lake, and the deer should be plentiful.&#8221;
  They launched the canoe on the deep waters, and the two took up the  paddles, sending their little craft northward, with slow, deliberate  strokes. They had the luck within the hour to find a deer drinking, and  with equal luck Robert slew it at the first shot. They would have taken  the body into the canoe, but the burden was too great, and Tayoga cut  it up and dressed it with great dispatch, while Robert watched. Then  they made room for the four quarters and again paddled northward.  Fearing that Tandakora had come much nearer, while they were busy with  the deer, they did not dare the wide expanse of the lake, but remained  for the present under cover of the overhanging forest on the western  shore.
  &#8220;If we put the lake between Tandakora and ourselves,&#8221; said Robert,  &#8220;we ought to be safe.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is likely that they, too, have canoes hidden in the reeds,&#8221; said  Tayoga. &#8220;Since the French and their allies have spread so far south  they would provide for the time when they wanted to go upon the waters  of Ganoatohale. It is almost a certainty that we shall be pursued upon  the lake.&#8221;
  They continued northward, never leaving the dark shadow cast by the  dense leafage, and, as they went slowly, they enjoyed the luxury of the  canoe. After so much walking through the wilderness it was a much  pleasanter method of traveling. But they did not forget vigilance,  continually scanning the waters, and Robert's heart gave a sudden beat  as he saw a black dot appear upon the surface of the lake in the south.  It was followed in a moment by another, then another and then three  more.
  &#8220;It is the band of Tandakora, beyond a doubt,&#8221; said Tayoga with  conviction. &#8220;They had their canoes among the reeds even as we had ours,  and now it is well for us that water leaves no trail.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shall we hide the canoe again, and take to the woods?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think not, Dagaeoga. They have had no chance to see us yet. We  will withdraw among the reeds until night comes, and then under its  cover cross Ganoatohale.&#8221;
  Keeping almost against the bank, they moved gently until they came  to a vast clump of reeds into which they pushed the canoe, while  retaining their seats in it. In the center they paused and waited. From  that point they could see upon the lake, while remaining invisible  themselves, and they waited.
  The six canoes or large boats, they could not tell at the distance  which they were, went far out into the lake, circled around for a  while, and then bore back toward the western shore, along which they  passed, inspecting it carefully, and drawing steadily nearer to Robert  and Tayoga.
  &#8220;Now, let us give thanks to Tododaho, Areskoui and to Manitou  himself,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;that they have been pleased to make the  reeds grow in this particular place so thick and so tall.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;they're fine reeds, beautiful reeds, a greater  bulwark to us just now than big oaks could be. Think you, Tayoga, that  you recognize the large man in the first boat?&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, Dagaeoga, I know him, as you do also. How could we mistake our  great enemy, Tandakora? It is a formidable fleet, too strong for us to  resist, and, like the wise man, we hide when we cannot fight.&#8221;
  Robert's pulses beat so hard they hurt, but he would not show any  uneasiness in the presence of Tayoga, and he sat immovable in the  canoe. Nearer and nearer came the Indian fleet, partly of canoes and  partly of boats, and he counted in them sixteen warriors, all armed  heavily. Now he prayed to Manitou, and to his own God who was the same  as Manitou, that no thought of pushing among the reeds would enter  Tandakora's head. The fleet soon came abreast of them, but his prayers  were answered, as Tandakora led ahead, evidently thinking the fugitives  would not dare to hide and lie in waiting, but would press on in flight  up the western shore.
  &#8220;I could pick him off from here with a bullet,&#8221; said Robert, looking  at the huge, painted chest of the Ojibway chief.
  &#8220;But our lives would be the forfeit,&#8221; the Onondaga whispered back.
  &#8220;I had no intention of doing it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Now they have passed us, and for the while we are safe. They will  go on up the lake, until they find no trace of us there, and then  Tandakora will come back.&#8221;
  &#8220;But how does he know we have a canoe?&#8221;
  &#8220;He does not know it, but he feels sure of it because our trail led  straight to the lake, and we would not purposely come up against such a  barrier, unless we knew of a way to cross it.&#8221;
  &#8220;That sounds like good logic. Of course when they return they'll  make a much more thorough search of the lake's edge, and then they'd be  likely to find us if we remained here.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so, but perhaps the night will come before Tandakora, and  then we'll take flight upon the lake.&#8221;
  They pushed their canoe back to the edge of the reeds, and watched  the Indian boats passing in single file northward, becoming smaller and  smaller until they almost blended with the water, but both knew they  would return, and in that lay their great danger. The afternoon was  well advanced, but the sun was very brilliant, and it was hot within  the reeds. Great quantities of wild fowl whirred about them and along  the edges of the lake.
  &#8220;No warriors are in hiding near us,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;or the wild fowl  would fly away. We can feel sure that we have only Tandakora and his  band to fear.&#8221;
  Robert had never watched the sun with more impatience. It was  already going down the western arch, but it seemed to him to travel  with incredible slowness. Far in the north the Indian boats were mere  black dots on the water, but they were turning. Beyond a doubt  Tandakora was now coming back.
  &#8220;Suppose we go slowly south, still keeping in the shadow of the  trees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can gain at least that much advantage.&#8221;
  Fortunately the scattered fringe of reeds and bushes, growing in the  water, extended far to the south, and they were able to keep in their  protecting shadow a full hour, although their rate of progress was not  more than one-third that of the Indians, who were coming without  obstruction in open water. Nevertheless, it was a distinct gain, and,  meanwhile, they awaited the coming of the night with the deepest  anxiety. They recognized that their fate turned upon a matter of a half  hour or so. If only the night would arrive before Tandakora! Robert  glanced at the low sun, and, although at all times, it was beautiful,  he had never before prayed so earnestly that it would go over the other  side of the world, and leave their own side to darkness.
  The splendor of the great yellow star deepened as it sank. It poured  showers of rays upon the broad surface of the lake, and the silver of  the waters turned to orange and gold. Everything there was enlarged and  made more vivid, standing out twofold against the burning western  background. Nothing beyond the shadow could escape the observation of  the Indians in the boats, and they themselves in Robert's intense  imagination changed from a line of six light craft into a great fleet.
  Nevertheless the sun, lingering as if it preferred their side of the  world to any other, was bound to go at last. The deep colors in the  water faded. The orange and gold changed back to silver, and the  silver, in its turn, gave way to gray, twilight began to draw a heavy  veil over the east, and Tayoga said in deep tones:
  &#8220;Lo, the Sun God has decided that we may escape! He will let the  night come before Tandakora!&#8221;
  Then the sun departed all at once, and the brilliant afterglow soon  faded. Night settled down, thick and dark, with the waters, ruffled by  a light wind, showing but dimly. The line of Tandakora became  invisible, and the two youths felt intense relief.
  &#8220;Now we will start toward the northeastern end of the lake,&#8221; said  Tayoga. &#8220;It will be wiser than to seek the shortest road across,  because Tandakora will think naturally that we have gone that way, and  he will take it also.&#8221;
  &#8220;And it's paddling all night for us,&#8221; said Robert &#8220;Well, I welcome  it.&#8221;
  They were interrupted by the whirring of the wild fowl again, though  on a much greater scale than before. The twilight was filled with  feathered bodies. Tayoga, in an instant, was all attention.
  &#8220;Something has frightened them,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Perhaps a bear or a deer,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;I think not. They are used to wild animals, and would not be  startled at their approach. There is only one being that everything in  the forest generally fears.&#8221;
  &#8220;Man?&#8221;
  &#8220;Even so, Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps we'd better pull in close to the bank and look.&#8221;
  &#8220;It would be wise.&#8221;
  Robert saw that the Onondaga, with his acute instincts, was deeply  alarmed, and he too felt that the wild fowl had given warning. They  sent the canoe with a few silent strokes through the shallow water  almost to the edge of the land, and, as it nearly struck bottom, two  dusky figures rising among the bushes threw their weight upon them. The  light craft sank almost to the edges with the weight, but did not  overturn, and both attackers and attacked fell out of it into the lake.
  Robert for a moment saw a dusky face above him, and instinctively he  clasped the body of a warrior in his arms. Then the two went down  together in the water. The Indian was about to strike at him with a  knife, but the lake saved him. As the water rushed into eye, mouth and  nostril the two fell apart, but Robert was able to keep his presence of  mind in that terrible moment, and, as he came up again, he snatched out  his own knife and struck almost blindly.
  He felt the blade encounter resistance, and then pass through it. He  heard a choked cry and he shuddered violently. All his instincts were  for civilization and against the taking of human life, and he had  struck merely to save his own, but almost articulate words of  thankfulness bubbled to his lips as he saw the dark figure that had  hovered so mercilessly over him disappear. Then a second figure took  the place of the first and he drew back the fatal blade again, but a  soft voice said:
  &#8220;Do not strike, Dagaeoga. I also have accounted for one of the  warriors who attacked us, and no more have yet come. We may thank the  wild fowl. Had they not warned us we should have perished.&#8221;
  &#8220;And even then we had luck, or your Tododaho is still watching over  us. I struck at random, but the blade was guided to its mark.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so was mine. What you say is also proved to be true by the fact  that the canoe did not overturn, when they threw themselves upon us.  The chances were at least ninety-nine out of a hundred that it would do  so.&#8221;
  &#8220;And our arms and ammunition and our deer?&#8221;
  &#8220;All in the canoe, except the weapons that are in our belts.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Tayoga, it is quite sure that your Tododaho has been watching  over us. But where is the canoe?&#8221;
  Robert was filled with alarm and horror. They were standing above  their knees in the water, and they no longer saw the little craft,  which had become a veritable ship of refuge to them. They peered about  frantically in the dusk and then Tayoga said:
  &#8220;There is a strong breeze blowing from the land and waves are  beginning to run on the water. They have taken the canoe out into the  lake. We must swim in search of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;And if we don't find it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we drown, but O Dagaeoga, death in the water is better than  death in the fires that Tandakora will kindle.&#8221;
  &#8220;We might escape into the woods.&#8221;
  &#8220;Warriors who have come upon our trail are there, and would fall  upon us at once. The attack by the two who failed proves their  presence.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Tayoga, we must take the perilous chance and swim for the  canoe.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so, Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  Both were splendid swimmers, even with their clothes on, and, wading  out until the water was above their waists, they began to swim with  strong and steady strokes toward the middle of the lake, following with  exactness the course of the wind. All the time they sought with anxious  eyes through the dusk for a darker shadow that might be the canoe. The  wind rose rapidly, and now and then the crest of a wave dashed over  them. Less expert swimmers would have sunk, but their muscles were  hardened by years of forest life&#8212;all Robert's strength had come back  to him&#8212;and an immense vitality made the love of life overwhelming in  them. They fought with all the powers of mind and body for the single  chance of overtaking the canoe.
  &#8220;I hope you see it, Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied the Onondaga. &#8220;The darkness is heavy over the  lake, and the mists and vapors, rising from the water, increase it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was a fine canoe, Tayoga, and it holds our rifles, our  ammunition, our deer, my buffalo robe, and all our precious belongings.  We have to find it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so, Dagaeoga. We have no other choice. We truly swim for  life. One could pray at this time to have all the powers of a great  fish. Do you see anything behind us?&#8221;
  Robert twisted his head and looked over his shoulder.
  &#8220;I see no pursuit,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I cannot even see the shore, as the  mists and vapors have settled down between. In a sense we're out at  sea, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Ganoatohale is large. The canoe, too, is afloat upon its bosom  and is, as you say, out at sea. We and it must meet or we are lost. Are  you weary, Dagaeoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not yet. I can still swim for quite a while.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then float a little, and we can take the exact course of the wind  again. The canoe, of course, will continue to go the way the wind  goes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Unless it's deflected by currents which do not always follow the  wind.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do not notice any current, and to follow the wind is our only  hope. The mists and vapors will hide the canoe from us until we are  very close to it&#8221;
  &#8220;And you may thank Tododaho that they will hide something else also.  Unless I make a great mistake, Tayoga, I hear the swish of paddles.&#8221;
  &#8220;You make no mistake, Dagaeoga. I too hear paddles, ten, a dozen, or  more of them. It is the fleet of Tandakora coming back and it will soon  be passing between us and the shore. Truly we may be thankful, as you  say, for the mists and vapors which, while they hide the canoe from us,  also hide us from our enemies.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall lie flat upon my back and float, and I'll blend with the  water.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a wise plan, Dagaeoga. So shall I. Then Tandakora himself  would not see us, even if he passed within twenty feet of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is passing now, and I can see the outlines of their boats.&#8221;
  The two were silent as the fish themselves, sustained by  imperceptible strokes, and Robert saw the fleet of Tandakora pass in a  ghostly line. They looked unreal, a shadow following shadows, the huge  figure of the Ojibway chief in the first boat a shadow itself. Robert's  blood chilled, and it was not from the cold of the water. He was in a  mystic and unreal world, but a world in which danger pressed in on  every side. He felt like one living back in a primeval time. The swish  of the paddles was doubled and tripled by his imagination, and the  canoes seemed to be almost on him.
  The questing eyes of Tandakora and his warriors swept the waters as  far as the night, surcharged with mists and vapors, would allow, but  they did not see the two human figures, so near them and almost  submerged in the lake. The sound of the swishing paddles moved  southward, and the line of ghostly canoes melted again, one by one,  into the darkness.
  &#8220;They're gone, Tayoga,&#8221; whispered Robert in a tone of immense  relief.
  &#8220;So they are, Dagaeoga, and they will seek us long elsewhere. Are  you yet weary?&#8221;
  &#8220;I might be at another time, but with my life at stake I can't  afford to grow tired. Let us follow the wind once more.&#8221;
  They swam anew with powerful strokes, despite the long time they had  been in the water, and no sailors, dying of thirst, ever scanned the  sea more eagerly for a sail than they searched through the heavy dusk  for their lost canoe. The wind continued to rise, and the waves with  it. Foam was often dashed over their heads, the water grew cold to  their bodies, now and then they floated on their backs to rest  themselves and thus the singular chase, with the wind their only guide,  was maintained.
  Robert was the first to see a dim shape, but he would not say  anything until it grew in substance and solidity. Nevertheless hope  flooded his heart, and then he said:
  &#8220;The wind has guided us aright, Tayoga. Unless some evil spirit has  taught my eyes to lie to me that is our canoe straight ahead.&#8221;
  &#8220;It has all the appearance of a canoe, Dagaeoga, and since the only  canoe on this part of the lake is our canoe, then our canoe it is.&#8221;
  &#8220;And none too soon. I'm not yet worn out, but the cold of the water  is entering my bones. I can see very clearly now that it's the canoe,  our canoe. It stands up like a ship, the strongest canoe, the finest  canoe, the friendliest canoe that ever floated on a lake or anywhere  else. I can hear it saying to us: 'I have been waiting for you. Why  didn't you come sooner?'&#8220;
  &#8220;Truly when Dagaeoga is an old, old man, nearly a hundred, and the  angel of death comes for him, he will rise up in his bed and with the  rounded words pouring from his lips he will say to the angel: 'Let me  make a speech only an hour long and then I will go with you without  trouble, else I stay here and refuse to die.'&#8220;
  &#8220;I'm using words to express my gratitude, Tayoga. Look, the canoe is  moving slowly toward the center of the lake, but it stays back as much  as the wind will let it and keeps beckoning to us. A few more long,  swift strokes, Tayoga, and we're beside it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, Dagaeoga, and we must be careful how we climb into it. It is  no light task to board a canoe in the middle of a lake. Since Tododaho  would not let it be overturned, when we fell out of it, we must not  overturn it ourselves when we get back into it, else we lose all our  arms, ammunition and other supplies.&#8221;
  The canoe was now not more than fifty feet in front of them, moving  steadily farther and farther from land before the wind that blew out of  the west, but, sitting upright on the waters like a thing of life,  bearing its precious freight. The mists and vapors had closed in so  much now that their chance of seeing it had been only one in a  thousand, and yet that lone chance had happened. The devout soul of  Tayoga was filled with gratitude. Even while swimming he looked up at  the great star that he could not see beyond the thick veil of cloud,  but, knowing it was there, he returned thanks to the mighty Onondaga  chieftain who had saved them so often.
  &#8220;The canoe retreats before us, Dagaeoga,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it is not to  escape us, it is to beckon us on, out of the path of Tandakora's boats  which soon may be returning again and which will now come farther out  into the lake, thinking that we may possibly have made a dash under the  cover of the mists.&#8221;
  &#8220;What you predict is already coming true, Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert,  &#8220;because I hear the first faint dip of their paddles once more, and  they can't be more than two hundred yards behind us.&#8221;
  The regular swishing grew louder and came closer, but the courage of  the two youths was still high. They had been drawn on so steadily by  the canoe, apparently in a predestined course, and they had been  victors over so many dangers, that they were confident the boats of  Tandakora would pass once more and leave them unseen.
  &#8220;They're almost abreast of us now, Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;Aye, Dagaeoga,&#8221; said the Onondaga, looking back. &#8220;They do not  appear through the mist and we hear only the paddles, but we know the  threat is there, and we can follow them as well with ear as with eye.  They keep straight on, going back toward the north. Nothing tells them  we are here, as our canoe beckons to us, nothing guides them to that  for which they are looking. Now the sound of their paddles becomes  less, now it is faint and now it is gone wholly. They have missed us  once more! Let us summon up the last of our strength and overtake the  canoe.&#8221;
  They put all their energy into a final effort and presently drew up  by the side of the canoe. Tayoga steadied it with his hands while  Robert was the first to climb into it. The Onondaga followed and the  two lay for a few minutes exhausted on the bottom. Then Tayoga sat up  and said in a full voice:
  &#8220;Lo, Dagaeoga, let us give thanks to Manitou for our wonderful  escape, because we have looked into the face of death.&#8221;
  Robert, awed by time and circumstance, shared fully the belief of  Tayoga that their escape was a miracle. His nature contained much that  was devout and spiritual and he, too, with his impressionable  imagination, peopled earth and air almost unconsciously with spirits,  good and bad. The good and bad often fought together, and sometimes the  good prevailed as they had just done. There lay in the canoe the  paddles, which they had lifted out of the water in their surprise at  the sudden attack, and beside them were the rifles and everything else  they needed.
  They were content to let the canoe travel its own course for a long  time, and that course was definite and certain, as if guided by the  hand of man. The wind always carried it toward the northeast and  farther and farther away from the fleet of Tandakora. But they took off  their clothing, wrung out as much water as they could, and wrapped  themselves in the dry blankets from their packs. Robert's spirits,  stimulated by the reaction, bubbled up in a wonderful manner.
  &#8220;We'll see no more of Tandakora for a long time, at least,&#8221; he  exclaimed, &#8220;and now, ho! for our wonderful voyage!&#8221;
  They drew the wet charges from their pistols and reloaded them, they  polished anew their hatchets and knives and then, these tasks done,  they still sat for a long time in the canoe, idle and content. Their  little boat needed no help or guidance from their hands. That favoring  wind always carried it away from their enemies and in the direction in  which they wished it to go. And yet the wind did not blow away the  mists and vapors, that grew thicker and thicker around them, until they  could not see twenty feet away.
  Robert's feeling that they were protected, his sense of the  spiritual and mystic, grew, and he saw that the mind of Tayoga was  under the same spell. The waters of the lake were friendly now. As they  lapped around the canoe they made a soothing sound, and the wind that  guided and propelled them sang a low but pleasant song.
  &#8220;We are in the arms of Tododaho,&#8221; said Tayoga in a reverential tone,  &#8220;and Hayowentha, the great Mohawk, also looks on and smiles. What need  for us to strive when the gods themselves take us in their keeping?&#8221;
  Hours passed before they spoke again. They had been at the uttermost  verge of exhaustion when they climbed into the canoe, and perhaps  physical weakness had made their minds more receptive to the belief  that they were in hands mightier than their own, but even as strength  came back the conviction remained in all its primitive force. Warmth  returned to their bodies, wrapped in the blankets, and they felt an  immense peace. Midnight passed and the boat bore steadily on with its  two silent occupants.
