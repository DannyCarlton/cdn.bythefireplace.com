  In an old fashioned house a little east of the village lived the  Rev. Theophilus Wilson, pastor of the Congregational Church in  Granville. The house was considerably out of repair, and badly needed  painting. It belonged to Squire Hadley, of whom the minister hired it,  together with an acre of land adjoining, for seventy five dollars a  year. An expenditure of one or two hundred dollars would have improved  its appearance and made it a little more habitable, and the Squire, who  was not a mean man, would have consented to this outlay but for the  strenuous opposition of his wife. 
  &quot;It's good enough for the minister,&quot; she said. &quot;Ministers shouldn't  be too particular about their earthly dwellings. I believe in ministers  being unworldly, for my part.&quot; 
  &quot;The house does look rather bad,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;Mrs. Wilson  says the roof leaks, too.&quot; 
  &quot;A few drops won't hurt all the furniture she's got,&quot; said Mrs.  Hadley contemptuously. 
  Mrs. Hadley was rather inconsistent. She regarded the minister's  poor furniture and his wife's worn dresses with scornful superiority;  yet, had either complained, she would have charged them with  worldliness. 
  &quot;One coat of paint won't cost much,&quot; said the Squire, watching his  wife's countenance for signs of approval or the opposite. 
  &quot;It will do no good,&quot; said she positively. &quot;It won't make the house  any warmer, and will only conduce to the vanity of the minister and his  wife.&quot; 
  &quot;I never thought either of them vain,&quot; expostulated her husband. 
  &quot;You only look to the surface,&quot; said his wife, in a tone of calm  superiority. &quot;I go deeper. You think, because Mrs. Wilson can't afford  to dress well, that she has no vanity. I can read her better. If she  had the means she'd cut a dash, you may depend upon it.&quot; 
  &quot;There's one thing I can't understand, Lucretia,&quot; said her husband.  &quot;Why are things worldly in them that are not in us?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know what you mean.&quot; 
  &quot;You like to dress well, and I like my house to look neat. Why  doesn't that show a worldly spirit in us?&quot; 
  &quot;Because you are not a minister nor I a minister's wife.&quot; 
  &quot;What difference does that make?&quot; 
  &quot;You are very dull this morning, Mr. Hadley,&quot; said his wife  scornfully. 
  &quot;Perhaps I may be, but still I should like an explanation.&quot; 
  &quot;Ministers should set their hearts on things above.&quot; 
  &quot;Shouldn't we?&quot; 
  &quot;Not in the same way. They should be humble and not self seeking.  They should set a good example to the parish. Does Mr. Wilson pay his  rent regular?&quot; she asked, suddenly changing the subject. 
  &quot;Tolerable.&quot; 
  &quot;Isn't he in arrears? 
  &quot;I can't tell exactly without looking at the books,&quot; said the  Squire evasively. 
  &quot;I understand; you don't want to tell me. I dare say he is owing  you half a year's rent.&quot;  This was quite true, but Squire Hadley  neither confirmed nor denied it. He could quite understand that Mr.  Wilson, with a wife and three children, found it hard to keep even with  the world on his scanty stipend, and he did not feel like pressing him. 
  &quot;I think it shameful for a minister not to pay his debts,&quot; said  Mrs. Hadley, in an acid tone. 
  &quot;Suppose he can't, my dear.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't dear me. I am out of patience with you,&quot; said the lady  sharply. 
  &quot;Why?&quot; 
  &quot;You needn't ask. You encourage the minister in his shiftless  course.&quot; 
  &quot;Suppose I had three children, and all our clothing and household  expenses had to be paid out of five hundred a year.&quot; 
  &quot;If you was a minister you ought to do it.&quot; 
  &quot;A minister can't make a dollar go any farther than other people.&quot; 
  &quot;He can give up luxuries and vanities.&quot; 
  &quot;Our minister indulges in very few of those,&quot; said the Squire,  shrugging his shoulders. 
  &quot;I don't know about that. I saw Sarah Wilson in the store the other  day buying some granulated sugar, when brown is cheaper and would do  equally as well.&quot; 
  &quot;I believe we use granulated sugar, Lucretia,&quot; said Squire Hadley,  his eyes twinkling. 
  &quot;You're not a minister.&quot; 
  &quot;And I shouldn't want to be if the sinners are to get all the good  things of this life, and the saints have to take up with the poorest.&quot; 
  &quot;Call yourself a sinner if you like, but don't call me one, Mr.  Hadley,&quot; said his wife with some asperity. 
  &quot;Ain't you a sinner?&quot; 
  &quot;We are all sinners, if it comes to that, but I consider myself as  good as most people. How much rent did you say the minister was owing  you?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't say,&quot; said the Squire shrewdly. 
  &quot;Keep it a secret if you please. All I say is that it's a duty you  owe your family to collect what is honestly due you. I would do it if I  were a man.&quot; 
  &quot;I think you would, Lucretia. However, to please you, I'll attend  to it within a week.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you're getting sensible. You allow your good nature to  run away with you.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you allow me one good quality, Lucretia,&quot; said her  husband with an attempt at humor. 
  Mrs. Hadley did not fail to inquire of her husband, a few days  afterward, if the rent had been collected, and heard with satisfaction  that it had been paid up to the current month. 
  &quot;I told you he would pay it if you pressed him,&quot; she said  triumphantly. 
  Her husband smiled. He thought it best not to relate the  circumstances under which it had been paid. He had called at the  minister's study the day after the conversation above detailed, and  after a few remarks on indifferent topics said: 
  &quot;By the way, Mr. Wilson, in regard to the rent &#151; &#151; &quot; 
  &quot;I regret being so much in arrears, Squire Hadley,&quot; said the  minister uncomfortably; &quot;but really it is a very perplexing problem to  make my salary cover the necessary expenses of my family. I hope in a  few weeks to be able to pay something.&quot; 
  Don't trouble yourself, my dear sir,&quot; said the Squire genially.  &quot;You must find it difficult, I am sure. I find, by my books, that you  are owing me six months' rent.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid it is as much as that,&quot; said Mr. Wilson, sighing. 
  &quot;And I am going to help you to pay it.&quot; 
  The minister looked at his guest in surprise. Squire Hadley took  out his pocket book, and drew there-from four ten dollar bills. 
  &quot;Mr. Wilson,&quot; said he, &quot;I make you a present of this, and now,  perhaps, you will be able to pay me the rent due &#151; thirty seven  dollars and a, half, I think the exact amount is.&quot; 
  &quot;My good friend,&quot; said the minister, almost overcome, &quot;how can I  thank you for this generosity?&quot; 
  &quot;By paying me my rent,&quot; said the Squire smiling. &quot;I am very  particular  to have that paid promptly. If you will furnish me with  writing materials I will write you a receipt. Now, Mr. Wilson,&quot; he  added, as he rose to go, &quot;I am going to ask you a favor.&quot; 
  &quot;Only mention it, my friend.&quot; 
  &quot;Let this little transaction be a secret between us.&quot; 
  It is hard to promise that; I should like to speak to others of  your goodness. If I say nothing about it, it will seem ungrateful.&quot; 
  &quot;If you do mention it, you will get me into hot water.&quot; 
  &quot;How is that?&quot; inquired the minister, in some perplexity. 
  &quot;The fact is my wife is very frugal, and just a leetle stingy. She  can't help it, you understand. Her father was pretty close fisted. She  wouldn't approve of my giving away so much money, and might  remonstrate.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; said the minister, who knew, as all the  village did, that Mrs. Hadley was quite as close fisted as her lamented  father. 
  &quot;So we had better say nothing about it.&quot; 
  &quot;I can tell my wife?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, you may tell her, for it may relieve her from anxiety. Of  course she won't mention it.&quot; 
  &quot;You are a firm friend, Squire Hadley,&quot; said Mr. Wilson, grasping  the hand of his parishioner cordially. &quot;You are one of those who do  good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I ain't,&quot; said Squire Hadley bluntly; &quot;I should be perfectly  willing to have all my good deeds known if it was not for Mrs. Hadley.  And that reminds me, I would willingly paint the house for you if she  did not object.&quot; 
  &quot;That is not of so much consequence; but the roof does leak badly,  and troubles my wife a good deal.&quot; 
  That ought to be fixed,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;How shall I manage it?&quot; 
  He reflected a moment, and his face brightened with a new idea. 
  &quot;I'll tell you what, Mr. Wilson, we must use a little strategy. You  shall see a carpenter, and have the roof repaired at your own expense.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Wilson's countenance fell. &quot;I fear &#151; &#151; &quot; he commenced. 
  &quot;But I will repay you whatever it costs. How will that do?&quot; 
  &quot;How kind you are, Squire Hadley!&quot; 
  &quot;It is only what I ought to do, and would have done before if I had  thought how to manage it. As Mrs. Hadley will wonder how you raised the  money, I will say you had a gift from a friend, and that I told you to  repair the house at your own expense.&quot; 
  A few days later Mrs. Hadley came home in some excitement. 
  &quot;Mr. Hadley,&quot; said she, severely, &quot;I find that the minister's house  is being new shingled.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it?&quot; asked her husband indifferently. 
  &quot;This is the way you waste your money, is it?&quot; 
  &quot;What have I to do with it? If Mr. Wilson chooses to shingle the  house at his own expense, I am perfectly willing.&quot; 
  &quot;Didn't you order it done?&quot; inquired his wife, in amazement. 
  &quot;Certainly not. The minister spoke of it when he paid the rent, and  I told him he could do it at his own expense if he chose to.&quot; 
  &quot;That's just what you ought to have said. But I don't understand  where the minister finds the money, if he is so poor as you say he is.&quot; 
  &quot;I understand that he has received a gift of money from a friend,&quot;  said the diplomatic Squire. 
  &quot;I didn't know he had any friend likely to give him money. Do you  know who it is?&quot; 
  &quot;He didn't tell me, and I didn't inquire,&quot; answered the Squire,  pluming himself on his strategy. 
  &quot;Was it a large sum?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think it was.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish his friend had given him enough to pay for painting the  house, too.&quot; 
  &quot;Why? The house wouldn't be any warmer for painting,&quot; said the  Squire slyly. 
  &quot;It would look better.&quot; 
  &quot;And so minister to his vanity.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem to be very stupid this  morning,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley,  provoked. 
  &quot;I am only repeating your own observations, my dear.&quot; 
  &quot;If Mr. Wilson can afford to paint the house, I am in favor of his  doing it; but I don't think you have any call to pay for it. The house  will be better property if it is newly painted.&quot; 
  &quot;Then don't you think I ought to do it, Lucretia?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I don't,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley sharply. 
  &quot;I think myself,&quot; said the wily Squire, &quot;considering the low rate  at which the minister gets the house, he could afford to put on one  coat of paint at his own expense. I have a great mind to hint it to  him.&quot; 
  &quot;You'd better do it, Mr. Hadley,&quot; said his wife approvingly. 
  &quot;I will; but perhaps he won't look at it in the same light.&quot; 
  Within a week the painters were at work on the parsonage. The coat  of paint improved its appearance very much. I suspect the bill was paid  in the same way as the shingling; but this is a secret between the  minister and Squire Hadley, whose strategy quite baffled his wife's  penetration.
