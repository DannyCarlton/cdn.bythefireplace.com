It was three months later that Aileen, once more sitting in Alexina's  bedroom, after her return from Santa Barbara, where she had gone with her  father for the summer, said abruptly: "Dad is terribly cut up, dear old  thing. He'd known your mother since they were both children, in the days  when there were wooden sidewalks on Montgomery Street, and Laurel Hill was  called Lone Mountain, and they had picnics in it. Odd they both should  have had young daughters. Another link--what? as the English say.  Well--anyhow--he told me to tell you that he was just as fond of your  father as of your mother, and that you must try to imagine that he is your  father from this time forth, and come to him when you are in doubt about  anything."    
Alexina looked her straight in the eyes. "I have sometimes thought uncle  daddy didn't like Mortimer."    
"On the contrary, he rather likes him. He respects a capacity for hard  work, and persistence, and a reputation for uncompromising honesty. But of  course Mortimer is young--in business, that is; and father thinks--but you  had better talk with him."    
"No. Why should I? But I don't mind you. At least I could not discuss  Mortimer with any one else. I am furious with Tom Abbott. He wants me to  put my money in trust, with himself and uncle daddy as trustees--ignoring  Mortimer, whom he pretends to like. He says Maria's fortune has been kept  intact, that he has never touched a cent of it, but that men in business  are likely to get into tight places and use their wife's money. Nothing  would induce Mortimer to touch my money, but he would feel pretty badly cut  up if I let any one else look after my affairs. Of course I wouldn't even  discuss the matter with Tom. And if Morty does need money at any time I'll  lend it to him. Why not? What else would any one expect me to do?"    
"Of course Tom Abbott went to work the wrong way, the blundering idiot.  No one doubts Mortimer's good faith, but the times are awful, money has  paresis; and when you are obliged to take any of your own out of the  stocking in order to keep business going, it is easily lost. Dad hopes you  will hang on like grim death to your inheritance. You see--the times are so  abnormal, Mortimer hasn't had time to prove his abilities yet; he's just  been able to hold on; and if things don't mend and he should lose out,  why--if you still have your own little fortune, at least you'll not be any  worse off than, you are now. Don't you see?"    
"Yes, I see. But Mortimer has told me of other panics and bad times. They  always pass, and better times come again. And if he has been able to hold  on, that at least shows ability, for others have gone under. Of course we  shall live here and run the house--as mother did. I couldn't bear to live  anywhere else, and Morty adores it too."    
"Oh, rather. I couldn't imagine you anywhere else."    
"Geary and Ballinger sent me ten thousand dollars for a wedding present and  Morty bought some bonds for me, but I'm going to sell a few and refurnish  the lower rooms. I love the old house but I like cheerful modern things.  The poor old parlors and dining-room do look like sarcophagi."    
"Good. I'll help. We'll have no end of fun."    
<b>II</b>    
There was a pause and then Alexina said: "Mortimer is so determined to be a  rich man and thinks of so little else and works so hard, that he is bound  to be. Otherwise, such gifts would be meaningless."    
She made the statements with an unconscious rising inflection. Aileen did  not answer and turned her sharp revealing green eyes on the eucalyptus  grove which concealed Ballinger House from the vulgar gaze, and  incidentally shut off a magnificent view.    
"I don't know whether I like Gora Dwight or not," she remarked.    
"Neither do I. But I admire her. She is a wonder."    
"Oh, yes, I admire her, and I've a notion she's got something big in her,  some sort of destiny. But those light eyes in that dark face give me the  creeps. It isn't that I don't trust her. I believe her to be insolently  honest and honorable--and just, if you like. But--perhaps it's only the  accident of her queer coloring--she gives me the impression that while she  might go to the stake for her pride, she'd murder you in cold blood if you  got in her way."    
"Poor Gora! You make her all the more interesting."    
"Did she ever tell you that she corresponds with that Englishman who was  out here at the time of the earthquake and fire and had that ghastly  adventure with his sister? We all met him at the Hofer ball--Gathbroke his  name was."    
Alexina was staring at her with an amazed frown. "Correspond--Gora?...I  remember now he told me she helped him to carry his sister's body out to  the old cemetery. Is he interested in her?"    
"I shouldn't wonder. They've corresponded off and on ever since. I  walked, home with her one afternoon before I went south--she interests me  frantically--and she invited me up to her quite artistic attic in Geary  Street, where she still lives, and gave me the most vivid description of  that night. It made me crawl. She stared straight before her as she told  it. Her eyes were just like gray oval mirrors in which it seemed to me I  saw the whole thing pass....    
"Then she showed me a photograph he had recently sent her--stunning thing  he is, all right, and looks years older than when he was here. She also  alluded to things he had said in a letter or two. So my phenomenally quick  wits inferred that they correspond. Perhaps they are engaged. Pretty good  deal for her."    
<b>III</b>    
Alexina, to her surprise, felt intensely angry, although she had the  presence of mind to cast up her eyes until the white showed below the large  brilliant iris and she looked like a saint in a niche.    
She had kept Gathbroke out of her thoughts for nearly four years,  deliberately. For a time she had hated him. Mortimer's love-making had  seemed tame in comparison with that primitive outburst, and never had she  felt any such fiery response to the man she had loved and chosen as during  those few moments when she had been in that impertinent, outrageous,  loathsome young Englishman's arms. At first she had wondered and resented,  loyally concluding that it was her own fault, or that of fate for endowing  her with such a slender emotional equipment that she used it all up at once  on the wrong man. Finally, she found it wise not to think about it at all  and to dismiss the intruder from her thoughts.    
Now she felt outraged in her sense of possession....Unconsciously she had  enshrined him as the secret mate of her inmost secret self...a self she  was barely conscious of even yet...lurking in her subconsciousness, the  personal and peculiar blend of many and diverse ancestors....Sometimes  she had glimpsed it...wondered a little with a not unpleasant sense of  apprehension....    
But for the most part Circumstance had decreed that she abide on the  abundant surface of her nature and enjoy a highly enjoyable life as it  came. Now, she had experienced her first grief, which at the same time was  her first set-back. She did not go out at all. She saw much of Mortimer and  little of any one else. It was the summer season and all her friends were  in the country or in Europe.    
She had given Mortimer her power of attorney (largely a gesture of  defiance, this) and he had attended to all details connected with her new  fortune. Between the inheritance tax, small legacies, and depreciations,  she would have a little over six thousand dollars a year; which, however,  with Mortimer's contribution, would run the old house, and keep her  wardrobe up to mark after she went out of mourning. She knew nothing of the  value of money, and was accustomed to having little to spend and everything  provided. But her mind regarding finances was quite at rest. Even if  Mortimer remained a victim of the hard times, they would be quite  comfortable.    
The cares of housekeeping were very light. She discussed the daily menus  with James, but he had run Ballinger House for years, little as Mrs. Groome  had suspected it. Mortimer, shortly after his mother-in-law's death, and  while Alexina was passing a fortnight at Rincona, had given James orders  to collect all bills on the first of every month and hand them to him,  together with a statement of the servants' wages. Mrs. Dwight was not to be  bothered.    
Alexina, when she returned, had made no protest. The details of  housekeeping did not appeal to her. But the arrangement left her without  occupation, and much time for thought. After a long walk morning and  afternoon she had little to do but read. She was an early riser and her  mind was active.    
<b>IV</b>    
Dwight had not the least intention of using his wife's money, for he had  perfect confidence in his change of luck, and in his ability to do great  things with his business as soon as the period of depression had passed.  But he had no faith in any woman's ability to invest and take care of  money, he had fixed ideas in regard to a man being master in his own house,  and he had asked Alexina for her power of attorney more to flaunt her  confidence in him and to annoy her damnable relatives than because there  might possibly be a moment when he should have need of immediate resources.  Like many Americans he chose to keep his wife in ignorance of his business  life, and it would have annoyed him excessively to go to her with an  explanation of temporary difficulties and ask for a loan.    
Moreover, he wished to keep Alexina young and superficial, ignorant of  money matters, indifferent to the sordid responsibilities of life. Not only  was the present Alexina no embarrassment whatever to a man full of schemes,  aside from the slow march of business, for getting rich, but she was  infinitely alluring.    
He detested business women, intellectual women, women with careers; they  tipped the even balance of the man's world; moreover, they had no accepted  place in the higher social scheme. For women wage-earners he had no  antipathy and much sympathy and consideration, although he underpaid them  cheerfully when circumstances would permit. It was an abiding canker that  his sister was obliged to support herself; he was not ashamed of it, for  nursing was an honorable (and altruistic) profession, and several young  women in his new circle bad taken it up; but he hated it as a man and a  brother. As for her turning herself into an authoress, however, he only  hoped he would make his million before she got herself talked about.    
As for Alexina she was the perfect flower of a system lie worshiped and  nothing should mar or change her if his fond surveillance could prevent it.    
On the whole he was quite happy at this time, despite his passionate desire  for wealth and his natural resentment, at the attitude of the Abbotts and  their intimate circle of old friends who were so like them that he always  included them in his mind when speaking of "the family." Although he was  making barely enough to pay his sister the monthly interest on her money,  the salaries of his employees, and, until recently, a monthly contribution  to the household expenses, he had a comfortable and delightful home with  not a few of the minor luxuries, an undisputed position in the best  society, an honorable one in the business world, and a beautiful wife.  Now that the conventions forced them to live the retired life, they could  economize without attracting attention; as he paid the bills Alexina would  not know whether he still contributed his share or not; (in time he meant  to pay the whole and give his wife, with the grand gesture, her entire  income for pin money) and, with Alexina's cordial assent, he had sold the  old carriage, and the horses, which were eating their heads off, dismissed  the coachman-gardener, and found a young Swede to take care of the garden  and outbuildings.    
Later, they would have their car like other people, but there was no need  for it at present, and it was neither the time nor the occasion to exhibit  a tendency to extravagance. In the matter of "front" he knew precisely  where to leave off.    
In a certain small anxious bag-of-tricks way he was clever. But not clever  enough. He knew nothing of Alexina beneath her shining surface. If he  had he would have sought to crowd her mind with the details of the home,  encouraged her to join in the frantic activities of some one of the women's  clubs he held in scorn, persuaded her to play golf daily at the fashionable  club of which they were members, even though she ran the risk of talking,  unchaperoned by himself, with other men.    
He never would have left her to long hours of idleness, with only books for  companions (and Alexina cared little for novels lacking in psychology, or  in revelations of the many phases of life of which she was personally so  ignorant); and only his own companionship evening after evening.    
But he had known all the Alexina he was ever to know. Such flashing  glimpses as he was destined to have later so bewildered him that he reacted  obstinately to his original estimate of her,...just a child under the  influence of her family or some of those friends of hers who had always  hated him...erratic and irresponsible like all women...a man never could  understand women because there was nothing to understand...merely a bundle  of contradictions....    
In some ways his mental equipment was an enviable one.    
<b>V</b>    
Some of all this Alexina guessed, and although she was nettled at times  that he took no note of her maturing mind and character, she was, on the  whole, more amused.    
Indulgent by nature, and somewhat indolent, she had been more than willing  that Morty should enjoy his new authority, should even delude himself that  he was footing all the bills, poor dear; and she listened raptly to his  evening visions of their future life in Burlingame, alternated with visits  to New York and England, the while she puzzled over the intricacies of some  character portrayed by a master analyst.    
Sometimes he did not talk at all, utterly fagged by a strenuous day in  which he had accomplished precisely nothing. But the more transparent and  truncated and dull he grew the more spontaneous the "niceness" and almost  effusive courtesy of his wife. Insensibly she was veering to the family  attitude, but he had tagged her once for all and never saw it.    
Until this moment, however, when Gathbroke had been jerked from his deep  seclusion within her ivory tower by Aileen's unwelcome news, she had never  had a moment of complete self-revelation....She knew instantly that she had  never loved her husband: he was not her mate and Gathbroke was. She had had  three years of rippling content and light enjoyment with Mortimer, they had  never quarreled seriously, and they had never taken their parts in one  moment of real drama.    
If she had married Gathbroke they would have quarreled furiously, they  would have thrown courtesy and behavior to the winds often enough,  particularly while they were young, for neither would have been in the  least apprehensive of wounding the rank-pride of the other, and such mutual  and passionate love as theirs naturally gave birth to a high state of  irritability; they would have loved and hated and made constant discoveries  about each other...there would have been depths never to be fully explored  but always luring them on...and the perfect companionship...the complete  fusion....    
How Alexina knew all this after less than three hours' association with  Gathbroke, let any woman answer. She was not so foolish as to imagine  herself the victim of a secret passion, or that she had ever loved the man,  or ever would. She had merely had her chance for the great duodrama, and  thrown it away for a callow dream. She had no passing wish, even in that  moment of visualizing him interlocked with her own wraith in that sacred  inner temple where even she had never intruded before, to meet him again.  She had no intention of passing any of her abundant leisure in dreaming  dreams of him and the perfect bliss. But he had been hers...and  utterly...he had loved her...he had wanted her...he had precipitately  begged her to marry him...he had offered her the homage of complete  brutality.    
Something of him would always be hers.    
And even though she renounced all rights in him because she must, she did  not in the least relish that any one so close to her as Gora Dwight should  have him. She might have heard of his marriage to a girl of his own land  and class with only a passing spasm, but his continued and possibly tender  friendship with her sister-in-law shook her out of the last of her jejunity  and its illusions....She was not exactly a dog in the manger...she was a  maturing woman looking back with anger and dismay not only upon the fatal  mistake of her youth, but upon the inexorable realities of her present  life....    
The reaction was a more intense feeling of loyalty to Mortimer than ever.  She was entirely to blame. He not only had been innocent of conscious  rivalry, even of pursuit--for she could quite easily have discouraged him  in the earlier stages of his courtship--but he was dependent upon her in  every way: for his happiness, for the secure social position that meant so  much to him, for the greater number of his valuable connections, for even  his comfort and ease of living.    
Something of this had passed through her stunned mind on the morning of her  mother's death. Now it was all as sharply outlined as the etching at which  she was raptly gazing, and she vowed anew that she would never desert him,  never deny him the assistance of the true partner. She had signed a life  contract with her eyes open and she would keep it to the letter.    
Only she hoped to heaven that Gathbroke was not serious about Gora. She  wished never to be reminded of his existence again.    
And, as Aileen talked of Santa Barbara, she wondered vaguely why there  was not a law forbidding girls to marry until they were well into their  twenties....until they had had a certain amount of experience....knew their  own minds....Maria had been right....
