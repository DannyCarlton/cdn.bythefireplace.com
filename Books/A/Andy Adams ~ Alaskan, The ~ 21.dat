  Stampede had started with one of the two saddle-deer left at the  range, but to ride deer-back successfully and with any degree of speed  and specific direction was an accomplishment which he had neglected,  and within the first half-dozen miles he had abandoned the adventure to  continue his journey on foot. As Tatpan had no saddle-deer in his herd,  and the swiftest messenger would require many hours in which to reach  Amuk Toolik, Alan set out for his range within half an hour after his  arrival at Tatpan's camp. Stampede, declaring himself a new man after  his brief rest and the meal which followed it, would not listen to  Alan's advice that he follow later, when he was more refreshed.
  A fierce and reminiscent gleam smoldered in the little gun-fighter's  eyes as he watched Alan during the first half-hour leg of their race  through the foothills to the tundras. Alan did not observe it, or the  grimness that had settled in the face behind him. His own mind was  undergoing an upheaval of conjecture and wild questioning. That  Rossland had discovered Mary Standish was not dead was the least  astonishing factor in the new development. The information might easily  have reached him through Sandy McCormick or his wife Ellen. The  astonishing thing was that he had in some mysterious way picked up the  trail of her flight a thousand miles northward, and the still more  amazing fact that he had dared to follow her and reveal himself openly  at his range. His heart pumped hard, for he knew Rossland must be  directly under Graham's orders.
  Then came the resolution to take Stampede into his confidence and to  reveal all that had happened on the day of his departure for the  mountains. He proceeded to do this without equivocation or hesitancy,  for there now pressed upon him a grim anticipation of impending events  ahead of them.
  Stampede betrayed no astonishment at the other's disclosures. The  smoldering fire remained in his eyes, the immobility of his face  unchanged. Only when Alan repeated, in his own words, Mary Standish's  confession of love at Nawadlook's door did the fighting lines soften  about his comrade's eyes and mouth.
  Stampede's lips responded with an oddly quizzical smile. &#8220;I knew  that a long time ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guessed it that first night of storm  in the coach up to Chitina. I knew it for certain before we left  Tanana. She didn't tell me, but I wasn't blind. It was the note that  puzzled and frightened me&#8212;the note she stuffed in her slipper. And  Rossland told me, before I left, that going for you was a wild-goose  chase, as he intended to take Mrs. John Graham back with him  immediately.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you left her alone after<I> that</I>?&#8221;
  Stampede shrugged his shoulders as he valiantly kept up with Alan's  suddenly quickened pace.
  &#8220;She insisted. Said it meant life and death for her. And she looked  it. White as paper after her talk with Rossland. Besides&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sokwenna won't sleep until we get back. He knows. I told him. And  he's watching from the garret window with a.303 Savage. I saw him pick  off a duck the other day at two hundred yards.&#8221;
  They hurried on. After a little Alan said, with the fear which he  could not name clutching at his heart, &#8220;Why did you say Graham might  not be far away?&#8221;
  &#8220;In my bones,&#8221; replied Stampede, his face hard as rock again. &#8220;In my  bones!&#8221;
  &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not quite. I think Rossland told her. She was so white. And her  hand cold as a lump of clay when she put it on mine. It was in her  eyes, too. Besides, Rossland has taken possession of your cabin as  though he owns it. I take it that means somebody behind him, a force,  something big to reckon with. He asked me how many men we had. I told  him, stretching it a little. He grinned. He couldn't keep back that  grin. It was as if a devil in him slipped out from hiding for an  instant.&#8221;
  Suddenly he caught Alan's arm and stopped him. His chin shot out.  The sweat ran from his face. For a full quarter of a minute the two men  stared at each other.
  &#8220;Alan, we're short-sighted. I'm damned if I don't think we ought to  call the herdsmen in, and every man with a loaded gun!&#8221;
  &#8220;You think it's that bad?&#8221;
  &#8220;Might be. If Graham's behind Rossland and has men with him&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;We're two and a half hours from Tatpan,&#8221; said Alan, in a cold,  unemotional voice. &#8220;He has only half a dozen men with him, and it will  take at least four to make quick work in finding Tautuk and Amuk  Toolik. There are eighteen men with the southward herd, and twenty-two  with the upper. I mean, counting the boys. Use your own judgment. All  are armed. It may be foolish, but I'm following your hunch.&#8221;
  They gripped hands.
  &#8220;It's more than a hunch, Alan,&#8221; breathed Stampede softly. &#8220;And for  God's sake keep off the music as long as you can!&#8221;
  He was gone, and as his agile, boyish figure started in a half-run  toward the foothills, Alan set his face southward, so that in a quarter  of an hour they were lost to each other in the undulating distances of  the tundra.
  Never had Alan traveled as on the last of this sixth day of his  absence from the range. He was comparatively fresh, as his trail to  Tatpan's camp had not been an exhausting one, and his more intimate  knowledge of the country gave him a decided advantage over Stampede. He  believed he could make the distance in ten hours, but to this he would  be compelled to add a rest of at least three or four hours during the  night. It was now eight o'clock. By nine or ten the next morning he  would be facing Rossland, and at about that same hour Tatpan's swift  messengers would be closing in about Tautuk and Amuk Toolik. He knew  the speed with which his herdsmen would sweep out of the mountains and  over the tundras. Two years ago Amuk Toolik and a dozen of his Eskimo  people had traveled fifty-two hours without rest or food, covering a  hundred and nineteen miles in that time. His blood flushed hot with  pride. He couldn't do that. But his people could&#8212;and<I> would</I>. He  could see them sweeping in from the telescoping segments of the herds  as the word went among them; he could see them streaking out of the  foothills; and then, like wolves scattering for freer air and leg-room,  he saw them dotting the tundra in their race for home&#8212;and war, if it  was war that lay ahead of them.
  Twilight began to creep in upon him, like veils of cool, dry mist  out of the horizons. And hour after hour he went on, eating a strip of  pemmican when he grew hungry, and drinking in the spring coulees when  he came to them, where the water was cold and clear. Not until a  telltale cramp began to bite warningly in his leg did he stop for the  rest which he knew he must take. It was one o'clock. Counting his  journey to Tatpan's camp, he had been traveling almost steadily for  seventeen hours.
  Not until he stretched himself out on his back in a grassy hollow  where a little stream a foot wide rippled close to his ears did he  realize how tired he had become. At first he tried not to sleep. Rest  was all he wanted; he dared not close his eyes. But exhaustion overcame  him at last, and he slept. When he awoke, bird-song and the sun were  taunting him. He sat up with a jerk, then leaped to his feet in alarm.  His watch told the story. He had slept soundly for six hours, instead  of resting three or four with his eyes open.
  After a little, as he hurried on his way, he did not altogether  regret what had happened. He felt like a fighting man. He breathed  deeply, ate a breakfast of pemmican as he walked, and proceeded to make  up lost time. The interval between fifteen minutes of twelve and twelve  he almost ran. That quarter of an hour brought him to the crest of the  ridge from which he could look upon the buildings of the range. Nothing  had happened that he could see. He gave a great gasp of relief, and in  his joy he laughed. The strangeness of the laugh told him more than  anything else the tension he had been under.
  Another half-hour, and he came up out of the dip behind Sokwenna's  cabin and tried the door. It was locked. A voice answered his knock,  and he called out his name. The bolt shot back, the door opened, and he  stepped in. Nawadlook stood at her bedroom door, a gun in her hands.  Keok faced him, holding grimly to a long knife, and between them,  staring white-faced at him as he entered, was Mary Standish. She came  forward to meet him, and he heard a whisper from Nawadlook, and saw  Keok follow her swiftly through the door into the other room.
  Mary Standish held out her hands to him a little blindly, and the  tremble in her throat and the look in her eyes betrayed the struggle  she was making to keep from breaking down and crying out in gladness at  his coming. It was that look that sent a flood of joy into his heart,  even when he saw the torture and hopelessness behind it. He held her  hands close, and into her eyes he smiled in such a way that he saw them  widen, as if she almost disbelieved; and then she drew in a sudden  quick breath, and her fingers clung to him. It was as if the hope that  had deserted her came in an instant into her face again. He was not  excited. He was not even perturbed, now that he saw that light in her  eyes and knew she was safe. But his love was there. She saw it and felt  the force of it behind the deadly calmness with which he was smiling at  her. She gave a little sob, so low it was scarcely more than a broken  breath; a little cry that came of wonder&#8212;understanding&#8212;and  unspeakable faith in this man who was smiling at her so confidently in  the face of the tragedy that had come to destroy her.
  &#8220;Rossland is in your cabin,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;And John Graham is back  there&#8212;somewhere&#8212;coming this way. Rossland says that if I don't go to  him of my own free will&#8212;&#8221;
  He felt the shudder that ran through her.
  &#8220;I understand the rest,&#8221; he said. They stood silent for a moment.  The gray-cheeked thrush was singing on the roof. Then, as if she had  been a child, he took her face between his hands and bent her head back  a little, so that he was looking straight into her eyes, and so near  that he could feel the sweet warmth of her breath.
  &#8220;You didn't make a mistake the day I went away?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;You&#8212;love me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  For a moment longer he looked into her eyes. Then he stood back from  her. Even Keok and Nawadlook heard his laugh. It was strange, they  thought&#8212;Keok with her knife, and Nawadlook with her gun&#8212;for the bird  was singing, and Alan Holt was laughing, and Mary Standish was very  still.
  Another moment later, from where he sat cross-legged at the little  window in the attic, keeping his unsleeping vigil with a rifle across  his knees, old Sokwenna saw his master walk across the open, and  something in the manner of his going brought back a vision of another  day long ago when Ghost Kloof had rung with the cries of battle, and  the hands now gnarled and twisted with age had played their part in the  heroic stand of his people against the oppressors from the farther  north.
  Then he saw Alan go into the cabin where Rossland was, and softly  his fingers drummed upon the ancient tom-tom which lay at his side. His  eyes fixed themselves upon the distant mountains, and under his breath  he mumbled the old chant of battle, dead and forgotten except in  Sokwenna's brain, and after that his eyes closed, and again the vision  grew out of darkness like a picture for him, a vision of twisting  trails and of fighting men gathering with their faces set for war.
