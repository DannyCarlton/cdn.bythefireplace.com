    The last new boy was a little fellow only eleven years old. His  name  was Tommy Cooper, as he was called at home. It was his first  absence  from the sheltering care of his mother, and he felt lonesome  in the  great, dreary school building, where he was called &quot;Cooper,&quot;  and  &quot;you little chap.&quot; He missed the atmosphere of home, and the   tenderness of his mother and sister. In fact, the poor boy was   suffering from that most distressing malady, homesickness. 
  Had Mrs. Socrates Smith been a kind, motherly woman, she might have   done much to reconcile the boy to his new home; but she was a tall,   gaunt, bony woman, more masculine than feminine, not unlike Miss   Sally Brass, whom all readers of Dickens will remember. 
  I am sorry to say that a homesick boy in a boarding school does not   meet with much sympathy. Even those boys who have once experienced   the same malady are half ashamed of it, and, if they remember it at   all, remember it as a mark of weakness. There was but one boy who   made friendly approaches to Tommy, and this was Hector Roscoe. 
  Hector had seen the little fellow sitting by himself with a sad   face, and he had gone up to him, and asked him in a pleasant tone   some questions about himself and his home. 
  &quot;So you have never been away from home before, Tommy,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered the boy, timidly. 
  &quot;Don't call me sir. I am only a boy like you. Call me Hector.&quot; 
  &quot;That is a strange name. I never heard it before.&quot; 
  &quot;No, it is not a common name. I suppose you don't like school very   much?&quot; 
  &quot;I never shall be happy here,&quot; sighed Tommy. 
  &quot;You think so now, but you will get used to it.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I shall.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes, you will. It will never seem like home, of course, but  you  will get acquainted with some of the boys, and will join in their   games, and then time will pass more pleasantly.&quot; 
  &quot;I think the boys are very rough,&quot; said the little boy. 
  &quot;Yes, they are rough, but they don't mean unkindly. Some of them   were homesick when they came here, just like you.&quot; 
  &quot;Were you homesick?&quot; asked Tommy, looking up, with interest. 
  &quot;I didn't like the school very well; but I was much older than you   when I came here, and, besides, I didn't leave behind me so pleasant   a home. I am not so rich as you, Tommy. I have no father nor  mother,&quot;  and for the moment Hector, too, looked sad. 
  The little fellow became more cheerful under the influence of   Hector's kind and sympathetic words. Our hero, however, was   catechised about his sudden intimacy with the new scholar. 
  &quot;I see you've got a new situation, Roscoe,&quot; said Bates, when Hector   was walking away. 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 
  &quot;You've secured the position of nurse to that little cry baby.&quot; 
  &quot;You mean Tommy Cooper?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, if that's his name.&quot; 
  &quot;I was cheering up the little fellow a bit. He's made rather a bad   exchange in leaving a happy home for Smith Institute.&quot; 
  &quot;That's so. This is a dreary hole, but there's no need of crying   about it.&quot; 
  &quot;You might if you were as young as Tommy, and had just come.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall you take him under your wing?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, if he needs it.&quot; 
  We now come to the few minutes preceding the return of Hector from   his walk, as indicated in the last chapter. 
  Tommy Cooper was sitting in the school yard, with a disconsolate   look, when Jim Smith, who was never happier than when he was  bullying  other boys, espied him. 
  &quot;What's the matter with you, young one?&quot; he said, roughly, &quot;Is your   grandmother dead?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered Tommy, briefly. 
  &quot;Come here and play.&quot; 
  &quot;I would rather not.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not going to have you sulking round here. Do you hear me?&quot; 
  &quot;Are you one of the teachers?&quot; asked Tommy, innocently. 
  &quot;You'll find out who I am,&quot; answered Jim, roughly. &quot;Here, Palmer,  do  you want a little fun with this young one?&quot; 
  Palmer and Bates were Jim Smith's most devoted adherents. 
  &quot;What are you going to do, Jim?&quot; questioned Palmer. 
  &quot;I'm going to stir him up a little,&quot; said Jim, with a malicious   smile. &quot;Go and get a blanket.&quot; 
  &quot;All right!&quot; said Palmer. 
  &quot;We'll toss him in a blanket. He won't look so sulky after we get   through with him.&quot; 
  There were two or three other boys standing by, who heard these   words. 
  &quot;It's a shame!&quot; said one, in a low voice. &quot;See the poor little  chap,  how sad he looks! I felt just as he does when I first came to   school.&quot; 
  &quot;Jim ought not to do it,&quot; said the second. &quot;It's a mean thing to   do.&quot; 
  &quot;Tell him so.&quot; 
  &quot;No, thank you. He'd treat me the same way.&quot; 
  The two speakers were among the smaller boys, neither being over   fourteen, and though they sympathized with Tommy, their sympathy was   not likely to do him any good. 
  Out came Palmer with the blanket. 
  &quot;Are there any teachers about?&quot; asked Jim. 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;That's good. We shan't be interfered with. Here, young one, come   here.&quot; 
  &quot;What for?&quot; asked Tommy, looking frightened. 
  &quot;Come here, and you'll find out.&quot; 
  But Tommy had already guessed. He had read a story of English  school  life, in which a boy had been tossed in a blanket, and he was  not  slow in comprehending the situation. 
  &quot;Oh, don't toss me in a blanket!&quot; said the poor boy, clasping his   hands. 
  &quot;Sorry to disturb you, but it's got to be done, young one,&quot; said   Jim. &quot;Here, jump in. It'll do you good.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, don't!&quot; sobbed the poor boy. &quot;It'll hurt me.&quot; 
  &quot;No, it won't! Don't be a cry baby. We'll make a man of you.&quot; 
  But Tommy was not persuaded. He jumped up, and tried to make his   escape. But, of course, there was no chance for him. Jim Smith   overtook him in a couple of strides, and seizing him roughly by the   collar, dragged him to the blanket, which by this time Palmer and  one  of the other boys, who had been impressed into the service   reluctantly, were holding. 
  Jim Smith, taking up Tommy bodily, threw him into the blanket, and   then seizing one end, gave it a violent toss. Up went the boy into   the air, and tumbling back again into the blanket was raised again. 
  &quot;Raise him, boys!&quot; shouted Jim. &quot;Give him a hoist!&quot; 
  Then it was that Tommy screamed, and Hector heard his cry for help. 
  He came rushing round the corner of the building, and comprehended,   at a glance, what was going on. 
  Naturally his hot indignation was much stirred. 
  &quot;For shame, you brutes!&quot; he cried. &quot;Stop that!&quot; 
  If there was anyone whom Jim Smith did not want to see at this   moment, it was Hector Roscoe. He would much rather have seen one of   the ushers. He saw that he was in a scrape, but his pride would not   allow him to back out. 
  &quot;Keep on, boys!&quot; he cried. &quot;It's none of Roscoe's business. He'd   better clear out, or we'll toss him.&quot; 
  As he spoke he gave another toss. 
  &quot;Save me, Hector!&quot; cried Tommy, espying his friend's arrival with   joy. 
  Hector was not the boy to let such an appeal go unheeded. He sprang   forward, dealt Jim Smith a powerful blow, that made him stagger, and   let go the blanket, and then helped Tommy to his feet. 
  &quot;Run into the house. Tommy!&quot; he said. &quot;There may be some rough work   here.&quot; 
  He faced round just in time to fend off partially a blow from the   angry bully. 
  &quot;Take that for your impudence!&quot; shouted Jim Smith. &quot;I'll teach you   to meddle with, me.&quot; 
  But Jim reckoned without his host. The blow was returned with   interest, and, in the heat of his indignation, Hector followed it up   with such a volley that the bully retreated in discomfiture, and was   glad to withdraw from the contest. 
  &quot;I'll pay you for this, you scoundrel!&quot; he said, venomously. 
  &quot;Whenever you please, you big brute!&quot; returned Hector,   contemptuously. &quot;It is just like you to tease small boys. If you   annoy Tommy Cooper again, you'll hear from me.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd like to choke that fellow!&quot; muttered Jim. &quot;Either he or I will   have to leave this school.&quot;
