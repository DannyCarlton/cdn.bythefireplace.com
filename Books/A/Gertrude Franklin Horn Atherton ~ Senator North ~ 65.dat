"Molly," said Betty, the next morning, "I should like to go up to the  Adirondacks alone for a few weeks. Would you mind staying here with  the Colonel and Sally for another ten days and then returning with  them? Sally says she will move into my room and that she and the  Colonel will take you to the theatre and do everything they can to  make you happy. You know the Colonel delights to be with you."    
"I understand, of course, that you are going," said Mrs. Madison. "I  shall not be bored, if that is what you mean. I hope you will  telegraph at once, so that the house will be warmed at least a day  before you arrive. I suppose you have got to a point in your affairs  where you must have solitude, but I wish you had not, and I wish you  would go where it is warmer."    
"Oh, I shall be comfortable enough." She added in a moment, "Don't  think I do not appreciate your consideration, for I do."    
Then she sat down at the desk and wrote a note to Burleigh. It was a  brief epistle, but she was a long while writing it. Her previous notes  had been dashed off in ten minutes, and usually related to the play of  the previous evening. His replies had been a curious mingling of half-  offended pride and a passion which was only restrained by the fear  that the lady was not yet ready for it.    
Finally Betty concocted the missive to the satisfaction of her mind's  diplomatic condition. She had not yet brought herself to begin any of  her notes to him formally. "Dear Robert" was as yet unnatural, and  "Dear Mr. Burleigh" absurd; so she ignored the convention.    
"I suddenly have made up my mind to go to the Adirondacks for a month,  <i>quite alone,</i>" she wrote. "When one is going to take a tremendous  step, one needs solitude that one may do a great deal of hard  thinking. I don't wonder that some Catholic women go into retreat. At  all events, Washington, 'the world,' even my mother, even you, who  always are so kind and considerate, seem impossible to me at present;  and if I am to live with some one else for the rest of my life, I must  have one uninterrupted month of solitary myself. Doubtless that will  do me till the end of my time! So would you mind if I asked you not  even to write to me? I have enjoyed your notes so much, but I want to  feel absolutely alone. Don't think this is petty egoism. It goes far  deeper than that! If we ever are to understand each other I am sure I  need not explain myself further.    <p align="right">  B. M."    
"It has a rather heartless ring," she thought with a sigh, "but it  will intrigue him, and--who knows? As heaven is my witness, I do not.  But I do know this, that unless I get away from them all and fairly  inside of myself, whatever I do will seem the wrong thing and I might  end by making a dramatic fool of myself."
