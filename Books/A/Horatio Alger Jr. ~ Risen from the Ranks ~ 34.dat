  During his temporary editorship, Harry did not feel at liberty to  make any decided changes in the character or arrangement of the paper;  but he was ambitious to improve it, as far as he was able, in its  different departments. Mr. Anderson had become rather indolent in the  collection of local news, merely publishing such items as were  voluntarily contributed. Harry, after his day's work was over, made a  little tour of the village, gathering any news that he thought would be  of interest to the public. Moreover he made arrangements to obtain news  of a similar nature from neighboring villages, and the result was, that  in the course of a month he made the &#8220;Gazette&#8221; much more readable.
  &#8220;Really, the 'Gazette' gives a good deal more news than it used to,&#8221;  was a common remark.
  It was probably in consequence of this improvement that new  subscriptions began to come in, not from Centreville alone, but from  towns in the neighborhood. This gratified and encouraged Harry, who now  felt that he was on the right tack.
  There was another department to which he devoted considerable  attention. This was a condensed summary of news from all parts of the  world, giving the preference and the largest space, of course, to  American news. He aimed to supply those who did not take a daily paper  with a brief record of events, such as they would not be likely,  otherwise, to hear of. Of course all this work added to his labors as  compositor; and his occasional sketches for Boston papers absorbed a  large share of his time. Indeed, he had very little left at his  disposal for rest and recreation.
  &#8220;I am afraid you are working too hard, Harry,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;You  are doing Mr. Anderson's work better than he ever did it, and your own  too.&#8221;
  &#8220;I enjoy it,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I work hard I know, but I feel paid by  the satisfaction of finding that my labors are appreciated.&#8221;
  &#8220;When Mr. Anderson gets back, he will find it necessary to employ  you as assistant editor, for it won't do to let the paper get back to  its former dulness.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will accept,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;if he makes the offer. I feel more and  more that I must be an editor.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are certainly showing yourself competent for the position.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have only made a beginning,&#8221; said our hero, modestly. &#8220;In time I  think I could make a satisfactory paper.&#8221;
  One day, about two months after Mr. Anderson's departure, Ferguson  and Harry were surprised, and not altogether agreeably, by the entrance  of John Clapp and Luke Harrison. They looked far from prosperous. In  fact, both of them were decidedly seedy. Going West had not effected an  improvement in their fortunes.
  &#8220;Is that you, Clapp?&#8221; asked Ferguson. &#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221;
  &#8220;From St. Louis.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you didn't feel inclined to stay there?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not I. It's a beastly place. I came near starving.&#8221;
  Clapp would have found any place beastly where a fair day's work was  required for fair wages, and my young readers in St. Louis, therefore,  need not heed his disparaging remarks.
  &#8220;How was it with you, Luke?&#8221; asked Harry. &#8220;Do you like the West no  better than Clapp?&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't catch me out there again,&#8221; said Luke. &#8220;It isn't what it's  cracked up to be. We had the hardest work in getting money enough to  get us back.&#8221;
  As Luke did not mention the kind of hard work by which the money was  obtained, I may state here that an evening's luck at the faro table had  supplied them with money enough to pay the fare to Boston by railway;  otherwise another year might have found them still in St. Louis.
  &#8220;Hard work doesn't suit your constitution, does it?&#8221; said Ferguson,  slyly.
  &#8220;I can work as well as anybody,&#8221; said Luke; &#8220;but I haven't had the  luck of some people.&#8221;
  &#8220;You were lucky enough to have your fare paid to the West for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and when we got there, the rascal left us to shift for  ourselves. That aint much luck.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've always had to shift for myself, and always expect to,&#8221; was the  reply.
  &#8220;Oh, you're a model!&#8221; sneered Clapp. &#8220;You always were as sober and  steady as a deacon. I wonder they didn't make you one.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Walton there is one of the same sort,&#8221; said Luke. &#8220;I say,  Harry, it was real mean in you not to send me the money I wrote for.  You hadn't it, had you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry, firmly; &#8220;but I worked hard for it, and I didn't  feel like giving it away.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who asked you to give it away? I only wanted to borrow it.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the same thing&#8212;with you. You were not likely to repay it  again.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean to insult me?&#8221; blustered Luke.
  &#8220;No, I never insult anybody. I only tell the truth. You know, Luke  Harrison, whether I have reason for what I say.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't leave a friend to suffer when I had plenty of money in  my pocket,&#8221; said Luke, with an injured air. &#8220;If you had been a  different sort of fellow I would have asked you for five dollars to  keep me along till I can get work. I've come back with empty pockets.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll lend you five dollars if you need it,&#8221; said Harry, who judged  from Luke's appearance that he told the truth.
  &#8220;Will you?&#8221; said Luke, brightening up. &#8220;That's a good fellow. I'll  pay you just as soon as I can.&#8221;
  Harry did not place much reliance on this assurance; but he felt  that he could afford the loss of five dollars, if loss it should prove,  and it might prevent Luke's obtaining the money in a more questionable  way.
  &#8220;Where's Mr. Anderson?&#8221; asked Clapp, looking round the office.
  &#8220;He's been in Michigan for a couple of months.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't say so! Why, who runs the paper?&#8221;
  &#8220;Ferguson and I,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I mean who edits it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Harry does that,&#8221; said his fellow-workman.
  &#8220;Whew!&#8221; ejaculated Clapp, in surprise. &#8220;Why, but two years ago you  was only a printer's devil!&#8221;
  &#8220;He's risen from the ranks,&#8221; said Ferguson, &#8220;and I can say with  truth that the 'Gazette' has never been better than since it has been  under his charge.&#8221;
  &#8220;How much does old Anderson pay you for taking his place?&#8221; asked  Luke, who was quite as much surprised as Clapp.
  &#8220;I don't ask anything extra. He pays me fifteen dollars a week as  compositor.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're doing well,&#8221; said Luke, enviously. &#8220;Got a big pile of money  laid up, haven't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have something in the bank.&#8221;
  &#8220;Harry writes stories for the Boston papers, also,&#8221; said Ferguson.  &#8220;He makes a hundred or two that way.&#8221;
  &#8220;Some folks are born to luck,&#8221; said Clapp, discontentedly. &#8220;Here am  I, six or eight years older, out of a place, and without a cent to fall  back upon. I wish I was one of your lucky ones.&#8221;
  &#8220;You might have had a few hundred dollars, at any rate,&#8221; said  Ferguson, &#8220;if you hadn't chosen to spend all your money when you were  earning good wages.&#8221;
  &#8220;A man must have a little enjoyment. We can't drudge all the time.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's better to do that than to be where you are now.&#8221;
  But Clapp was not to be convinced that he was himself to blame for  his present disagreeable position. He laid the blame on fortune, like  thousands of others. He could not see that Harry's good luck was the  legitimate consequence of industry and frugality.
  After a while the two left the office. They decided to seek their  old boarding-house, and remain there for a week, waiting for something  to turn up.
  The next day Harry received the following letter from Mr.  Anderson:&#8212;
  &#8220;DEAR WALTON: My brother urges me to settle permanently at the West.  I am offered a partnership in a paper in this vicinity, and my health  has much improved here. The West seems the place for me. My only  embarrassment is the paper. If I could dispose of the 'Gazette' for two  thousand dollars cash, I could see my way clear to remove. Why can't  you and Ferguson buy it? The numbers which you have sent me show that  you are quite capable of filling the post of editor; and you and  Ferguson can do the mechanical part. I think it will be a good chance  for you. Write me at once whether there us any likelihood of your  purchasing.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Your friend, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;JOTHAM ANDERSON.&#8221;
  Harry's face flushed eagerly as he read this letter, Nothing would  suit him better than to make this arrangement, if only he could provide  the purchase money. But this was likely to present a difficulty.
