Curled up and sitting on her feet,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within the window's deep embrasure,<br> Is Lydia; and across the street,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lad, with eyes of roguish azure,<br> Watches her buried in her book.<br> In vain he tries to win a look,<br> And from the trellis over there<br> Blows sundry kisses through the air,<br> Which miss the mark, and fall unseen,<br> Uncared for. Lydia is thirteen. 
My lad, if you, without abuse,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will take advice from one who's wiser,<br> And put his wisdom to more use<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than ever yet did your adviser; 
If you will let, as none will do,<br> Another's heartbreak serve for two,<br> You'll have a care, some four years hence,<br> How you lounge there by yonder fence<br> And blow those kisses through that screen--<br> For Lydia will be seventeen.
