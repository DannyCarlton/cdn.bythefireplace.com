  Harry and Dalton kept close together during the long hours of the  ghostly ride. Just ahead of them were Taylor and Marshall and Peyton,  and in front Lee rode in silence. Now and then they passed regiments,  and at other times they would halt and let regiments pass them. Then  the troops, seeing the man sitting on the white horse, would start to  cheer, but always their officers promptly subdued it, and they marched  on feeling more confident than ever that their general was leading them  to victory.
  Many hours passed and still the army marched through the forests.  The trees, however, were dwindling in size and even in the night they  saw that the earth was growing red and sterile. Dense thickets grew  everywhere, and the marching became more difficult. Harry felt a sudden  thrill of awe.
  &#8220;George,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;do you know the country into which we're  riding?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I do, Harry. It's the Wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;It can't be anything else, George, because I see the ghosts.&#8221;
  &#8220;What are you talking about, Harry? What ghosts?&#8221;
  &#8220;The thousands and thousands who have fallen in that waste. Why the  Wilderness is so full of dead men that they must walk at night to give  one another room. I only hope that the ghost of Old Jack will ride  before us and show us the way.&#8221;
  &#8220;I almost feel like that, too,&#8221; admitted Dalton, who, however, was  of a less imaginative mind than Harry. &#8220;As sure as I'm sitting in the  saddle we're bound for the Wilderness. Now, what is the day going to  give us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Marching mostly, I think, and with the next noon will come battle.  Grant doesn't hesitate and hold back. We know that, George.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, it's not his character.&#8221;
  Morning came and found them still in the forests, seeking the deep  thickets of the Wilderness, and Grant, warned by his scouts and spies,  and most earnestly by one whose skill, daring and judgment were  unequaled, turned from his chosen line of march to meet his enemy. Once  more Lee had selected the field of battle, where his inferiority in  numbers would not count so much against him.
  It was nearly morning when the march ceased, and officers and  troops, save those on guard, lay down in the forest for rest. Harry, a  seasoned veteran, could sleep under any conditions and with a blanket  over him and a saddle for a pillow closed his eyes almost immediately.  Lee and his older aides, Taylor and Peyton and Marshall, slept also.  Around them the brigades, too, lay sleeping.
  A while before dawn a large man in Confederate uniform, using the  soft, lingering speech of the South, appeared almost in the center of  the army of Northern Virginia. He knew all the pass words and told the  officers commanding the watch that the wing under Ewell was advancing  more rapidly than any of the others. Inside the line he could go about  almost as he chose, and one could see little of him, save that he was  large of figure and deeply tanned, like all the rest.
  He approached the little opening in which Lee and his staff lay,  although he kept back from the sentinels who watched over the sleeping  leader. But Shepard knew that it was the great Confederate chieftain  who lay in the shadow of the oak and he could identify him by the  glances of the sentinels so often directed toward the figure.
  There were wild thoughts for a moment or two in the mind of Shepard.  A single bullet fired by an unerring hand would take from the  Confederacy its arm and brain, and then what happened to himself  afterward would not matter at all. And the war would be over in a month  or two. But he put the thought fiercely from him. A spy he was and in  his heart proud of his calling, but no such secret bullet could be  fired by him.
  He turned away from the little opening, wandered an hour through the  camp and then, diving into the deep bushes, vanished like a shadow  through the Confederate lines, and was gone to Grant to report that  Lee's army was advancing swiftly to attack, and that the command of  Ewell would come in touch with him first.
  Not long after dawn Harry was again on the march, riding behind his  general. From time to time Lee sent messengers to the various divisions  of his army, four in number, commanded by Longstreet, Early, Hill and  Stuart, the front or Stuart's composed of cavalry. Harry's own time  came, when he received a dispatch of the utmost importance to take to  Ewell. He memorized it first, and, if capture seemed probable, he was  to tear it into bits and throw it away. Harry was glad he was to go to  Ewell. In the great campaign in the valley he had been second to  Jackson, his right arm, as Jackson had been Lee's right arm. Ewell had  lost a leg since then, and his soldiers had to strap him in the saddle  when he led them into battle, but he was as daring and cheerful as  ever, trusted implicitly by Lee.
  Harry with a salute to his chief rode away. Part of the country was  familiar to him and in addition his directions were so explicit that he  could not miss the way.
  The four divisions of the army were in fairly close touch, but in a  country of forests and many waters Northern scouts might come between,  and he rode with caution, his hand ever near the pistol in his belt.  The midday sun however clouded as the afternoon passed on. The thickets  and forests grew more dense. From the distance came now and then the  faint, sweet call of a trumpet, but everything was hidden from sight by  the dense tangle of the Wilderness, a wilderness as wild and dangerous  as any in which Henry Ware had ever fought. How it all came back to  him! Almost exactly a year ago he had ridden into it with Jackson and  here the armies were gathering again.
  Imagination, fancy, always so strong in him, leaped into vivid life.  The year had not passed and he was riding to meet Stonewall Jackson,  who was somewhere ahead, preparing for his great curve about Hooker and  the lightning stroke at Chancellorsville. Rabbits sprang out of the  undergrowth and fled away before his horse's hoofs. In the lonely  wilderness, which nevertheless had little to offer to the hunter, birds  chattered from every tree. Small streams flowed slowly between dense  walls of bushes. Here and there in the protection of the thickets wild  flowers were in early bloom.
  It was spring, fresh spring everywhere, but the bushes and the grass  alike were tinged with red for Harry. The strange mental illusion that  he was riding to Chancellorsville remained with him and he did not seek  to shake it off. He almost expected to see Old Jack ahead on a hill,  bent over a little, and sitting on Little Sorrel, with the old slouch  hat drawn over his eyes. They had talked of the ghost of Jackson  leading them in the Wilderness. He shivered. Could it be so? All the  time he knew it was an illusion, but he permitted it to cast its spell  over him, as one who dreams knowingly.
  And Harry was dreaming back. Old Jack, the earlier of his two  heroes, was leading them. He foresaw the long march through the  thickets of the Wilderness, Stonewall forming the line of battle in the  deep roads late in the evening, almost in sight of Hooker's camp, the  sudden rush of his brigades and then the terrible battle far into the  night.
  He shook himself. It was uncanny. The past was the past. Dreams were  thin and vanished stuff. Once more he was in the present and saw  clearly. Old Jack was gone to take his place with the great heroes of  the past, but the Army of Northern Virginia was there, with Lee leading  them, and the most formidable of all the Northern chiefs with the most  formidable of all the Northern armies was before them.
  He heard the distant thud of hoofs and with instinctive caution drew  back into a dense clump of bushes. A half-dozen horsemen were near and  their eager looks in every direction told Harry that they were scouts.  There was little difference then between a well worn uniform of blue or  gray, and they were very close before Harry was able to tell that they  belonged to Grant's army.
  He was devoutly glad that his horse was trained thoroughly and stood  quite still while the Northern scouts passed. A movement of the bushes  would have attracted their attention, and he did not wish to be  captured at any time, least of all on the certain eve of a great  battle. After a battle he always felt an extra regret for those who had  fallen, because they would never know whether they had won or lost.
  They were alert, keen and vigorous men, or lads rather, as young as  himself, and they rode as if they had been Southern youths almost born  in the saddle. Harry was not the only one to notice how the Northern  cavalry under the whip hand of defeat had improved so fast that it was  now a match, man for man, for that of the South.
  The young riders rode on and the tread of their hoofs died in the  undergrowth. Then Harry emerged from his own kindly clump of bushes and  increased his speed, anxious to reach Ewell, without any more of those  encounters. He made good progress through the thickets, and soon after  sundown saw a glow which he took to be that of campfires. He advanced  cautiously, met the Southern sentinels and knew that he was right.
  The very first of these sentinels was an old soldier of Jackson, who  knew him well.
  &#8220;Mr. Kenton!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;Yes, Thorn! It's you!&#8221; said Harry without hesitation.
  The soldier was pleased that he should be recognized thus in the  dusk, and he was still more pleased when the young aide leaned down and  shook his hand.
  &#8220;I might have known, Thorn, that I'd find you here, rifle on your  arm, watching,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Kenton. You'll find the general over there on a log  by the fire.&#8221;
  Harry dismounted, gave his horse to a soldier and walked into the  glade. Ewell sat alone, his crutch under his arms, his one foot kicking  back the coals, his bald head a white disc in the glow.
  &#8220;General Ewell, sir,&#8221; said Harry.
  General Ewell turned about and when he saw Harry his face clearly  showed gladness. He could not rise easily, but he stretched out a  welcoming hand.
  &#8220;Ah! Kenton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you're a pleasant sight to tired eyes like  mine. You bring back the glorious old days in the valley. So it's a  message from the commander-in-chief?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir. Here it is.&#8221;
  Ewell read it rapidly by the firelight and smiled.
  &#8220;He tells us we're nearest to the enemy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and to hold  fast, if we're attacked. You're to remain with us and report what  happens, but doubtless you knew all this.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I had to commit it to memory before I started.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then stay here with me. I may want to report to General Lee at any  time. The enemy is in our front only three or four miles away. He knows  we're here and it was a villainous surprise to him to find us in his  way. They say this man Grant is a pounder. So is Lee, when the time  comes to pound, but he's that and far more. I tell you, young man, that  General Lee has had to trim a lot of Northern generals. McClellan and  Pope and Burnside and Hooker and Meade have been going to school to  him, and now Grant is qualifying for his class.&#8221;
  &#8220;But Grant is a great general. So our men in the West themselves  say.&#8221;
  &#8220;He may be, but Lee is greater, greatest. And, Harry, you and I, who  knew him and loved him, wish that another who alone was fit to ride by  his side was here with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish it from the bottom of my heart,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Well, well, regrets are useless. Help me up, Harry. I'm only part  of a man, but I can still fight.&#8221;
  &#8220;We saw you do that at Gettysburg,&#8221; said Harry, as he put his arm  under Ewell's shoulder. Then Ewell took his crutch and they walked to  the far side of the glade, where several officers of his staff gathered  around him.
  &#8220;Lieutenant Kenton, whom you all know,&#8221; said General Ewell, &#8220;has  brought a message from the commander-in-chief that we will be attacked  first, and to be on guard. We consider it an honor, do we not, my  lads?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, let them come,&#8221; they said.
  &#8220;Harry, you may want to see the enemy. Clayton, you and Campbell  take him forward through the pickets. But don't go too far. We don't  want to lose three perfectly good young officers before the battle  begins. After that it may be your business to get yourselves shot.&#8221;
  The two rode nearly two miles to the crest of a hill and then, using  their strong glasses in the moonlight, they were able to see the lights  of a vast camp.
  &#8220;We hear that it is Warren's corps,&#8221; said Clayton. &#8220;As General Ewell  doubtless has told you, the enemy know that we're in front, but I don't  believe they know our exact location. I believe we'll be in battle with  those men in the morning.&#8221;
  Harry thought so too. In truth, it was inevitable. Warren would  advance and Ewell would stand in his way. Yet he slept soundly when he  went back to camp, although he was awakened long before dawn the next  day. Then he ate breakfast, mounted and sat his horse not far away from  Ewell, whom two soldiers had strapped into his saddle, and who was  watching with eager eyes for the sunrise.
  Harry, listening intently, heard no sound in front of them, save the  wind rippling through the dwarfed forests of the Wilderness, and he  knew that no battle had yet begun elsewhere. Sound would come far on  that placid May morning, and it was a certainty that Ewell was nearest  to contact with the enemy.
  But Ewell did not yet move. All his men had been served with early  breakfast, such as it was, and remained in silent masses, partly hidden  by the forest and thickets. The dawn was cold, and Harry felt a little  chill, but it soon passed, as the red edge of the sun showed over the  eastern border of the Wilderness. Then the light spread toward the  zenith, but the golden glow failed to penetrate the somber thickets.
  &#8220;It's going to be a good day,&#8221; said Harry to an aide.
  &#8220;A good day for a battle.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll hear from the Yankees soon. They can't fail to discover our  exact location by sunrise, and they'll fight. Be sure of that.&#8221;
  It was now nearly six o'clock, and General Ewell, growing impatient,  rode forward a little. Harry followed with his staff. A half-dozen  Southern sharpshooters rose suddenly out of the thickets, and one of  them dared to lay his hands on the reins of the general's horse. But  Ewell was not offended. He looked down at the man and said:
  &#8220;What is it, Strother?&#8221;
  &#8220;Riflemen of the enemy are not more than three or four hundred yards  away. If you go much farther, General, they will certainly see you and  fire upon you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks, Strother. So they've located us?&#8221;
  &#8220;They're about to do it. They're feeling around. We've seen 'em in  the bushes. We ask you not to go on, General. We wouldn't know what to  do without you. There, sir! They're firing on our pickets!&#8221;
  A half-dozen shots came from the front, and then a half-dozen or so  in reply. Harry saw pink flashes, and then spirals of smoke rising.  More shots were fired presently on their right, and then others on  their left. The Northern riflemen were evidently on a long line, and  intended to make a thorough test of their enemy's strength. Harry had  no doubt that Shepard was there. He would surely come to the point  where his enemy was nearest, and his eyes and ears would be the keenest  of all.
  The little skirmish continued for a few minutes, extending along a  winding line of nearly a mile through the thickets. Only two or three  were wounded and nobody killed on the Southern side. Harry understood  thoroughly, as Ewell had said, that the sharpshooters of the enemy were  merely feeling for them. They wanted to know if a strong force was  there, and now they knew.
  The firing ceased, not in dying shots, but abruptly. The Wilderness  in front of them returned to silence, broken only by the rippling  leaves. Harry knew that the Northern sharpshooters had discovered all  they wanted, and were now returning to their leaders.
  Ewell turned his horse and rode back toward the main camp, his staff  following. The cooking fires had been put out, the lines were formed  and every gun was in position. As little noise as possible was allowed,  while they waited for Grant; not for Grant himself, but for one of his  lieutenants, pushed forward by his master hand.
  Harry and most of the staff officers dismounted, holding their  horses by the bridle. The young lieutenant often searched the thickets  with his glasses, but he saw nothing. Nevertheless he knew that the  enemy would come. Grant having set out to find his foe, would never  draw back when he found him.
  A much longer period of silence than he had expected passed. The  sun, flaming red, was moving on toward the zenith, and no sounds of  battle came from either right or left. The suspense became acute,  almost unbearable, and it was made all the more trying by the blindness  of that terrible forest. Harry felt at times as if he would rather  fight in the open fields; but he knew that his commander-in-chief was  right when he drew Grant into the shades of the Wilderness.
  When the suspense became so great that heavy weights seemed to be  pressing upon his nerves, rifle shots were fired in front, and  skirmishers uttered the long, shrill rebel yell. Then above both shots  and shouts rose the far, clear call of a bugle.
  &#8220;Here they come!&#8221; Harry heard Ewell say to himself, and the next  moment the sound of human voices was drowned in the thunder of great  guns and the crash of fifty thousand rifles. The battle was so sudden  and the charge so swift that it seemed to leap into full volume in an  instant. Warren, a resolute and daring general, led the Northern column  and it struck with such weight and force that the Southern division was  driven back. Harry felt it yielding, as if the ground were sliding  under his feet.
  There was so much flame and smoke that he could not see well, but  the sensation of slipping was distinct. General Ewell was near him,  shouting orders. His hat had fallen off, and his round, bald head had  turned red, either from the rush of blood or the cannon's glare. It  shone like a red dome, but Harry knew that there was no better man in  such a crisis than this veteran lieutenant of Stonewall Jackson.
  The Wilderness, usually so silent, was an inferno now. The battle,  despite its tremendous beginning, increased in violence and fury.  Although Grant himself was not there, the spirit that had animated him  at Shiloh and Vicksburg was. He had communicated it to his generals,  and Warren brought every ounce of his strength into action. The long  line of his bayonets gleamed through the thickets and the Northern  artillery, superb as usual, rained shells upon the Southern army.
  Ewell's men, fighting with all the courage and desperation that they  had shown on so many a field, were driven back further and further.  Ewell, strapped in his saddle, flourishing his sword, his round, bald  head glowing, rode among them, bidding them to stand, that help would  soon come. They continued to go backward, but those veterans of so many  campaigns never lost cohesion nor showed sign of panic. Their own  artillery and rifles replied in full volume. The heads of the charging  columns were blown away, but other men took their places, and Warren's  force came on with undiminished fire and strength.
  Harry wondered if the attack at other points had been made with such  impetuosity, but there was such a roar and crash about him that it was  impossible to hear sounds of battle elsewhere. Men were falling very  fast, but the general was unharmed, and neither the young lieutenant  nor his horse was touched.
  A sudden shout arose, and it was immediately followed by the  piercing rebel yell, swelling wild and fierce above the tumult of the  battle. Help was coming. Regiments in gray were charging down the paths  and on the left flank rose the thunder of hoofs as a formidable body of  cavalry under Sherburne, sabers aloft, swept down on the Northern  flank.
  Ewell's entire division stopped its retreat and, reinforced by the  new men, charged directly upon the Northern bayonets. Men met almost  face to face. The saplings and bushes were mown down by cannon and  rifles and the air was full of bursting shells. From time to time  Ewell's men uttered their fierce, defiant yell, and with a great bound  of the heart Harry saw that they were gaining. Warren was being driven  back. Two of his cannon were captured already, and the Southern men,  feeling the glow of the advance after retreat, charged again and again,  reckless of death. But Harry soon saw that ultimate victory here would  rest with the South. The troops of Warren, exhausted by their early  rush, were driven from one position to another by the seasoned veterans  who faced them. The Confederates retained the captured cannon and  thrust harder and harder. It became obvious that Warren must soon fall  back to the main Northern line, and though the battle was still raging  with great fury Ewell beckoned Harry to him.
  &#8220;Don't stay here any longer,&#8221; he shouted in his ear. &#8220;Ride to  General Lee and tell him we're victorious at this point for the day at  least!&#8221;
  Harry saluted and galloped away through the thickets. Behind him the  battle still roared and thundered. A stray shell burst just in front of  him, and another just behind him, but he and his horse were untouched.  Once or twice he glanced back and it looked as if the Wilderness were  on fire, but he knew that it was instead the blaze of battle. He saw  also that Ewell was still moving forward, winning more ground, and his  heart swelled with gladness.
  How proud Jackson would have been had he been able to see the valor  and skill of his old lieutenant! Perhaps his ghost did really hover  over the Wilderness, where a year before he had fallen in the moment of  his greatest triumph! Harry urged his horse into a gallop. All his  faculties now became acute. He was beyond the zone of fire, but the  roar of the battle behind him seemed as loud as ever. Yet it was  steadily moving back on the main Union lines, and there could be no  doubt of Ewell's continued success.
  The curves of the low hills and the thick bushes hid everything from  Harry's sight, as he rode swiftly through the winding paths of the  Wilderness. When the tumult sank at last he heard a new thunder in  front of him, and now he knew that the Southern center under Hill had  been attacked also, and with the greatest fierceness.
  As Harry approached, the roar of the second battle became terrific.  Uncertain where General Lee would now be, he rode through the sleet of  steel, and found Hill engaged with the very flower of the Northern  army. Hancock, the hero of Gettysburg, was making desperate exertions  to crush him, pouring in brigade after brigade, while Sheridan,  regardless of thickets, made charge after charge with his numerous  cavalry.
  Harry remained in the rear on his horse, watching this furious  struggle. The day had become much darker, either from clouds or the  vast volume of smoke, and the thickets were so dense that the officers  often could not see their enemy at all, only their own men who stood  close to them. The struggle was vast, confused, carried on under  appalling conditions. The charging horsemen were sometimes swept from  the saddle by bushes and not by bullets. Infantrymen stepped into a  dark ooze left by spring rains, and pulling themselves out, charged,  black to the waist with mud. Sometimes the field pieces became mired,  and men and horses together dragged them to firmer ground.
  Grant here, as before Ewell, continually reinforced his veterans,  but Hill, although he was not able to advance, held fast. The difficult  nature of the ground that Lee had chosen helped him. In marsh and  thickets it was impossible for the more numerous enemy to outflank him.  Harry saw Hill twice, a slender man, who had suffered severe wounds but  one of the greatest fighters in the Southern army. He had been ordered  to hold the center, and Harry knew now that he would do it, for the day  at least. Night was not very far away, and Grant was making no  progress.
  He rode on in search of Lee and before he was yet beyond the range  of fire he met Dalton, mounted and emerging from the smoke.
  &#8220;The commander-in-chief, where is he?&#8221; asked Harry.
  &#8220;On a little hill not far from here, watching the battle. I'm just  returning with a dispatch from Hill.&#8221;
  &#8220;I saw that Hill was holding his ground.&#8221;
  &#8220;So my dispatch says, and it says also that he will continue to hold  it. You come from Ewell?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and he has done more than stand fast. He was driven back at  first, but when reinforcements came he drove Warren back in his turn,  and took guns and prisoners.&#8221;
  &#8220;The chief will be glad to hear it. We'll ride together. Look out  for your horse! He may go knee deep into mire at any time. Harry, the  Wilderness looks even more somber to me than it did a year ago when we  fought Chancellorsville.&#8221;
  &#8220;I feel the same way about it. But see, George, how they're  fighting! General Hill is making a great resistance!&#8221;
  &#8220;Never better. But if you look over those low bushes you can see  General Lee on the hill.&#8221;
  Harry made out the figure of Lee on Traveller, outlined against the  sky, with about a dozen men sitting on their horses behind him. He  hurried forward as fast as he could. The commander-in-chief was reading  a dispatch, while the fierce struggle in the thickets was going on, but  when Harry saluted and Marshall told him that he had come to report the  general put away the dispatch and said:
  &#8220;What news from General Ewell?&#8221;
  &#8220;General Ewell was at first borne back by the enemy's numbers, but  when help came he returned to the charge, and has been victorious. He  has gained much ground.&#8221;
  A gleam of triumph shot from Lee's eyes, usually so calm.
  &#8220;Well done, Ewell!&#8221; he said. &#8220;The loss of a leg has not dimmed his  ardor or judgment. I truly believe that if he were to lose the other  one also he would still have himself strapped into the saddle and lead  his men to victory. We thank you for the news you have brought,  Lieutenant Kenton.&#8221;
  He put his glasses to his eyes and Harry and Dalton as usual  withdrew to the rear of the staff. But they used their glasses also,  bringing nearer to them the different phases of the battle, which now  raged through the Wilderness. They saw at some points the continuous  blaze of guns, and the acrid powder smoke, lying low, was floating  through all the thickets.
  But Harry now knew that the combat, however violent and fierce, was  only a prelude. The sun was already setting, and they could not fight  at night in those wild thickets, where men and guns would become mired  and tangled beyond extrication. The great struggle, with both leaders  hurling in their full forces, would come on the morrow.
  The sun already hung very low, and in the twilight and smoke the  savagery of the Wilderness became fiercer than ever. The dusk gathered  around Lee, but his erect figure and white horse still showed  distinctly through it. Harry, his spirit touched by the tremendous  scenes in the very center of which he stood, regarded him with a fresh  measure of respect and admiration. He was the bulwark of the  Confederacy, and he did not doubt that on the morrow he would stop  Grant as he had stopped the others.
  The darkness increased, sweeping down like a great black pall over  the Wilderness. The battle in the center and on the left died. Lee and  his staff dismounting, prepared for the labors of the night.
