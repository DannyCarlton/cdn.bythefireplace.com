  Not until he had covered at least a quarter of a mile did Neewa   stop. To Miki it seemed as though they had come suddenly out of  day  into the gloom of evening. That part of the forest into which  Neewa's  flight had led them was like a vast, mysterious cavern.  Even Challoner  would have paused there, awed by the grandeur of  its silence, held  spellbound by the enigmatical whispers that made  up its only sound.  The sun was still high in the heavens, but not  a ray of it penetrated  the dense green canopy of spruce and balsam  that hung like a wall over  the heads of Miki and Neewa. About them  was no bush, no undergrowth;  under their feet was not a flower or  a spear of grass. Nothing but a  thick, soft carpet of velvety  brown needles under which all life was  smothered. It was as if the  forest nymphs had made of this their  bedchamber, sheltered through  all the seasons of the year from wind  and rain and snow; or else  that the were-wolf people&#8212;the  loup-garou&#8212;had chosen it as their  hiding-place and from its weird and  gloomy fastnesses went forth  on their ghostly missions among the sons  of men. 
  Not a bird twittered in the trees. There was no flutter of life in   their crowded branches. Everything was so still that Miki heard  the  excited throbbing of life in his own body. He looked at Neewa,  and in  the gloom the cub's eyes were glistening with a strange  fire. Neither  of them was afraid, yet in that cavernous silence  their comradeship  was born anew, and in it there was something now  that crept down into  their wild little souls and filled the  emptiness that was left by the  death of Neewa's mother and the  loss of Miki's master. The pup whined  gently, and in his throat  Neewa made a purring sound and followed it  with a squeaky grunt  that was like the grunt of a little pig. They  edged nearer, and  stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world. They  went on after  a little, like two children exploring the mystery of an  old and  abandoned house. They were not hunting, yet every hunting  instinct  in their bodies was awake, and they stopped frequently to  peer  about them, and listen, and scent the air. 
  To Neewa it all brought back a memory of the black cavern in which   he was born. Would Noozak, his mother, come up presently out of  one  of those dark forest aisles? Was she sleeping here, as she had  slept  in the darkness of their den? The questions may have come  vaguely in  his mind. For it was like the cavern, in that it was  deathly still;  and a short distance away its gloom thickened into  black pits. Such a  place the Indians called MUHNEDOO&#8212;a spot in  the forest blasted of all  life by the presence of devils; for only  devils would grow trees so  thick that sunlight never penetrated.  And only owls held the  companionship of the evil spirits. 
  Where Neewa and Miki stood a grown wolf would have paused, and   turned back; the fox would have slunk away, hugging the ground;  even  the murderous-hearted little ermine would have peered in with  his  beady red eyes, unafraid, but turned by instinct back into the  open  timber. For here, in spite of the stillness and the gloom,  THERE WAS  LIFE. It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those  black pits. It  was rousing itself, even as Neewa and Miki went on  deeper into the  silence, and eyes that were like round balls were  beginning to glow  with a greenish fire. Still there was no sound,  no movement in the  dense overgrowth of the trees. Like the imps of  MUHNEDOO the monster  owls looked down, gathering their slow wits&#8212;  and waiting. 
  And then a huge shadow floated out of the dark chaos and passed so   close over the heads of Neewa and Miki that they heard the  menacing  purr of giant wings. As the wraith-like creature  disappeared there  came back to them a hiss and the grating snap of  a powerful beak. It  sent a shiver through Miki. The instinct that  had been fighting to  rouse itself within him flared up like a  powder-flash. Instantly he  sensed the nearness of an unknown and  appalling danger. 
  There was sound about them now&#8212;movement in the trees, ghostly   tremours in the air, and the crackling, metallic SNAP&#8212;SNAP&#8212;SNAP   over their heads. Again Miki saw the great shadow come and go. It  was  followed by a second, and a third, until the vault under the  trees  seemed filled with shadows; and with each shadow came nearer  that  grating menace of powerfully beaked jaws. Like the wolf and  the fox he  cringed down, hugging the earth. But it was no longer  with the  whimpering fear of the pup. His muscles were drawn tight,  and with a  snarl he bared his fangs when one of the owls swooped  so low that he  felt the beat of its wings. Neewa responded with a  sniff that a little  later in his life would have been the defiant  WHOOF of his mother.  Bear-like he was standing up. And it was upon  him that one of the  shadows descended&#8212;a monstrous feathered bolt  straight out of  darkness. 
  Six feet away Miki's blazing eyes saw his comrade smothered under   a gray mass, and for a moment or two he was held appalled and   lifeless by the thunderous beat of the gargantuan wings. No sound   came from Neewa. Flung on his back, he was digging his claws into   feathers so thick and soft that they seemed to have no heart or   flesh. He felt upon him the presence of the Thing that was death.  The  beat of the wings was like the beat of clubs: they drove the  breath  out of his body, they blinded his senses, yet he continued  to tear  fiercely with his claws into a fleshless breast. 
  In his first savage swoop Oohoomisew, whose great wings measured   five feet from tip to tip, had missed his death-grip by the  fraction  of an inch. His powerful talons that would have buried  themselves like  knives in Neewa's vitals closed too soon, and were  filled with the  cub's thick hair and loose hide. Now he was  beating his prey down with  his wings until the right moment came  for him to finish the killing  with the terrific stabbing of his  beak. Half a minute of that and  Neewa's face would be torn into  pieces. 
  It was the fact that Neewa made no sound, that no cry came from   him, that brought Miki to his feet with his lips drawn back and a   snarl in his throat. All at once fear went out of him and in its   place came a wild and almost joyous exultation. He recognized  their  enemy&#8212;A BIRD. To him birds were a prey, and not a menace. A  dozen  times in their journey down from the Upper Country Challoner  had shot  big Canada geese and huge-winged cranes. Miki had eaten  their flesh.  Twice he had pursued wounded cranes, yapping at the  top of his voice,  AND THEY HAD RUN FROM HIM. He did not bark or  yelp now. Like a flash  he launched himself into the feathered mass  of the owl. His fourteen  pounds of flesh and bone landed with the  force of a stone, and  Oohoomisew was torn from his hold and flung  with a great flutter of  wings upon his side. 
  Before he could recover his balance Miki was at him again,   striking full at his head, where he had struck at the wounded  crane.  Oohoomisew went flat on his back&#8212;and for the first time  Miki let out  of his throat a series of savage and snarling yelps.  It was a new  sound to Oohoomisew and his blood-thirsty brethren  watching the  struggle from out of the gloom. The snapping beaks  drifted farther  away, and Oohoomisew, with a, sudden sweep of  wings, vaulted into the  air. 
  With his big forefeet planted firmly and his snarling face turned   up to the black wall of the tree-tops Miki continued to bark and  howl  defiantly. He wanted the bird to come back. He wanted to tear  and rip  at its feathers, and as he sent out his frantic challenge  Neewa rolled  over, got on his feet, and with a warning squeal to  Miki once more set  off in flight. If Miki was ignorant in the  matter, HE at least  understood the situation. Again it was the  instinct born of countless  generations. He knew that in the black  pits about them hovered  death&#8212;and he ran as he had never run  before in his life. As Miki  followed, the shadows were beginning  to float nearer again. 
  Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine. The trees grew   taller, and soon the day began breaking through so that there were  no  longer the cavernous hollows of gloom about them. If they had  gone on  another hundred yards they would have come to the edge of  the big  plain, the hunting grounds of the owls. But the flame of   self-preservation was hot in Neewa's head; he was still dazed by  the  thunderous beat of wings; his sides burned where Oohoomisew's  talons  had scarred his flesh; so, when he saw in his path a  tangled windfall  of tree trunks he dived into the security of it  so swiftly that for a  moment or two Miki wondered where he had  gone. 
  Crawling into the windfall after him Miki turned and poked out his   head. He was not satisfied. His lips were still drawn back, and he   continued to growl. He had beaten his enemy. He had knocked it  over  fairly, and had filled his jaws with its feathers. In the  face of that  triumph he sensed the fact that he had run away in  following Neewa,  and he was possessed with the desire to go back  and have it out to a  finish. It was the blood of the Airedale and  the Spitz growing  stronger in him, fearless of defeat; the blood  of his father, the  giant hunting-hound Hela. It was the demand of  his breed, with its  mixture of wolfish courage and fox-like  persistency backed by the  powerful jaws and Herculean strength of  the Mackenzie hound, and if  Neewa had not drawn deeper under the  windfall he would have gone out  again and yelped his challenge to  the feathered things from which they  had fled. 
  Neewa was smarting under the red-hot stab of Oohoomisew's talons,   and he wanted no more of the fight that came out of the air. He  began  licking his wounds, and after a while Miki went back to him  and  smelled of the fresh, warm blood. It made him growl. He knew  that it  was Neewa's blood, and his eyes glowed like twin balls of  fire as they  watched the opening through which they had entered  into the dark  tangle of fallen trees. 
  For an hour he did not move, and in that hour, as in the hour   after the killing of the rabbit, he GREW. When at last he crept  out  cautiously from under the windfall the sun was sinking behind  the  western forests. He peered about him, watching for movement  and  listening for sound. The sagging and apologetic posture of  puppyhood  was gone from him. His overgrown feet stood squarely on  the ground;  his angular legs were as hard as if carven out of  knotty wood; his  body was tense, his ears stood up, his head was  rigidly set between  the bony shoulders that already gave evidence  of gigantic strength to  come. About him he knew was the Big  Adventure. The world was no longer  a world of play and of  snuggling under the hands of a master.  Something vastly more  thrilling had come into it now. 
  After a time he dropped on his belly close to the opening under   the windfall and began chewing at the end of rope which dragged  from  about his neck. The sun sank lower. It disappeared. Still he  waited  for Neewa to come out and lie with him in the open. As the  twilight  thickened into deeper gloom he drew himself into the edge  of the door  under the windfall and found Neewa there. Together  they peered forth  into the mysterious night. 
  For a time there was the utter stillness of the first hour of   darkness in the northland. Up in the clear sky the stars came out  in  twos and then in glowing constellations. There was an early  moon. It  was already over the edge of the forests, flooding the  world with a  golden glow, and in that glow the night was filled  with grotesque  black shadows that had neither movement nor sound.  Then the silence  was broken. From out of the owl-infested pits  came a strange and  hollow sound. Miki had heard the shrill  screeching and the TU-WHO-O-O,  TU-WHO-O-O, TU-WHO-O-O of the  little owls, the trap-pirates, but never  this voice of the strong-  winged Jezebels and Frankensteins of the  deeper forests&#8212;the real  butchers of the night. It was a hollow,  throaty sound&#8212;more a moan  than a cry; a moan so short and low that it  seemed born of  caution, or of fear that it would frighten possible  prey. For a  few minutes pit after pit gave forth each its signal of  life, and  then there was a silence of voice, broken at intervals by  the  faint, crashing sweep of great wings in the spruce and balsam tops   as the hunters launched themselves up and over them in the  direction  of the plain. 
  The going forth of the owls was only the beginning of the night   carnival for Neewa and Miki. For a long time they lay side by  side,  sleepless, and listening. Past the windfall went the padded  feet of a  fisher-cat, and they caught the scent of it; to them  came the far cry  of a loon, the yapping of a restless fox, and the  MOOING of a cow  moose feeding in the edge of a lake on the farther  side of the plain.  And then, at last, came the thing that made  their blood run faster and  sent a deeper thrill into their hearts. 
  It seemed a vast distance away at first&#8212;the hot throated cry of   wolves on the trail of meat. It was swinging northward into the   plain, and this shortly brought the cry with the wind, which was  out  of the north and the west. The howling of the pack was very  distinct  after that, and in Miki's brain nebulous visions and  almost  unintelligible memories were swiftly wakening into life. It  was not  Challoner's voice that he heard, but it was A VOICE THAT  HE KNEW. It  was the voice of Hela, his giant father; the voice of  Numa, his  mother; the voice of his kind for a hundred and a  thousand generations  before him, and it was the instinct of those  generations and the hazy  memory of his earliest puppyhood that  were impinging the thing upon  him. A little later it would take  both intelligence and experience to  make him discriminate the  hair-breadth difference between wolf and  dog. And this voice of  his blood was COMING! It bore down upon them  swiftly, fierce and  filled with the blood-lust of hunger. He forgot  Neewa. He did not  observe the cub when he slunk back deeper under the  windfall. He  rose up on his feet and stood stiff and tense,  unconscious of all  things but that thrilling tongue of the hunt-pack. 
  Wind-broken, his strength failing him, and his eyes wildly   searching the night ahead for the gleam of water that might save  him,  Ahtik, the young caribou bull, raced for his life a hundred  yards  ahead of the wolves. The pack had already flung itself out  in the form  of a horse-shoe, and the two ends were beginning to  creep up abreast  of Ahtik, ready to close in for the hamstring&#8212;  and the kill. In these  last minutes every throat was silent, and  the young bull sensed the  beginning of the end. Desperately he  turned to the right and plunged  into the forest. 
  Miki heard the crash of his body and he hugged close to the   windfall. Ten seconds later Ahtik passed within fifty feet of him,  a  huge and grotesque form in the moonlight, his coughing breath  filled  with the agony and hopelessness of approaching death. As  swiftly as he  had come he was gone, and in his place followed half  a score of  noiseless shadows passing so quickly that to Miki they  were like the  coming and the going of the wind. 
  For many minutes after that he stood and listened but again   silence had fallen upon the night. After a little he went back  into  the windfall and lay down beside Neewa. 
  Hours that followed he passed in restless snatches of slumber. He   dreamed of things that he had forgotten. He dreamed of Challoner.  He  dreamed of chill nights and the big fires; he heard his  master's voice  and he felt again the touch of his hand; but over  it all and through  it all ran that wild hunting voice of his own  kind. 
  In the early dawn he came out from under the windfall and smelled   of the trail where the wolves and the caribou had passed.  Heretofore  it was Neewa who had led in their wandering; now it was  Neewa that  followed. His nostrils filled with the heavy scent of  the pack, Miki  travelled steadily in the direction of the plain.  It took him half an  hour to reach the edge of it. After that he  came to a wide and stony  out-cropping of the earth over which he  nosed the spoor to a low and  abrupt descent into the wider range  of the valley. 
  Here he stopped. 
  Twenty feet under him and fifty feet away lay the partly devoured   carcass of the young bull. It was not this fact that thrilled him   until his heart stood still. From out of the bushy plain had come   Maheegun, a renegade she-wolf, to fill herself of the meat which  she  had not helped to kill. She was a slinking, hollow-backed,   quick-fanged creature, still rib-thin from the sickness that had  come  of eating a poison-bait; a beast shunned by her own kind&#8212;a  coward, a  murderess even of her own whelps. But she was none of  these things to  Miki. In her he saw in living flesh and bone what  his memory and his  instinct recalled to him of his mother. And his  mother had come before  Challoner, his master. 
  For a minute or two he lay trembling, and then he went down, as he   would have gone to Challoner; with great caution, with a wilder   suspense, but with a strange yearning within him that the man's   presence would have failed to rouse. He was very close to Maheegun   before she was conscious that he was near. The Mother-smell was  warm  in his nose now; it filled him with a great joy; and yet&#8212;he  was  afraid. But it was not a physical fear. Flattened on the  ground, with  his head between his fore-paws, he whined. 
  Like a flash the she-wolf turned, her fangs bared the length of   her jaws and her bloodshot eyes aglow with menace and suspicion.  Miki  had no time to make a move or another sound. With the  suddenness of a  cat the outcast creature was upon him. Her fangs  slashed him just  once&#8212;and she was gone. Her teeth had drawn blood  from his shoulder,  but it was not the smart of the wound that held  him for many moments  as still as if dead. The Mother-smell was  still where Maheegun had  been. But his dreams had crumbled. The  thing that had been Memory died  away at last in a deep breath that  was broken by a whimper of pain.  For him, even as for Neewa, there  was no more a Challoner, and no  longer a mother. But there  remained&#8212;the world! In it the sun was  rising. Out of it came the  thrill and the perfume of life. And close  to him&#8212;very close&#8212;was  the rich, sweet smell of meat. 
  He sniffed hungrily. Then he turned, and saw Neewa's black and   pudgy body tumbling down the slope of the dip to join him in the   feast.
