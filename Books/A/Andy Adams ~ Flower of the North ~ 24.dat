  Both Philip and Jeanne were silent for some moments after Gregson   had gone; their only movement was the gentle stroking of Philip's   hand over the girl's soft hair. Their hearts were full, too full  for  speech. And yet he knew that upon his strength depended  everything  now. The revelations of Gregson, which virtually ended  the fight  against him personally, were but trivial in his thoughts  compared with  the ordeal which was ahead of Jeanne. Both Pierre  and her father were  dead, and, with the exception of Jeanne, no  one but he knew of the  secret that had died with them. He could  feel against him the  throbbing of the storm that was passing in  the girl's heart, and in  answer to it he said nothing in words,  but held her to him with a  gentleness that lifted her face, quiet  and beautiful, so that her eyes  looked steadily and questioningly  into his own. 
  &quot;You love me,&quot; she said, simply, and yet with a calmness that sent   a curious thrill through him. 
  &quot;Beyond all else in the world,&quot; he replied. 
  She still looked at him, without speaking, as though through his   eyes she was searching to the bottom of his soul. 
  &quot;And you know,&quot; she whispered, after a moment. 
  He drew her so close she could not move, and crushed his face down   against her own. 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;Jeanne&#8212;everything is as it should be,&quot; he said. &quot;I am   glad that you were found out in the snows. I am glad that the  woman  in the picture was your mother. I would have nothing  different than it  is, for if things were different you would not  be the Jeanne that I  know, and I would not love you so. You have  suffered, sweetheart. And  I, too, have had my share of sorrow. God  has brought us together, and  all is right in the end. Jeanne&#8212;my  sweet Jeanne&#8212;&quot; 
  Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar. A gust of wind   opened it wider. Through it there came now a sound that  interrupted  the words on Philip's lips, and sent a sudden quiver  through Jeanne.  In an instant both recognized the sound. It was  the firing of rifles,  the shots coming to them faintly from far  beyond the mountain at the  end of the lake. Moved by the same  impulse, they ran to the door, hand  in hand. 
  &quot;It is Sachigo!&quot; panted Jeanne. She could hardly speak. She seemed   to struggle to get breath, &quot;I had forgotten. They are fighting&#8212;&quot; 
  MacDougall strode up from his post beside the door, where he had   been waiting for the appearance of Jeanne. 
  &quot;Firing&#8212;off there,&quot; he said. &quot;What does it mean?&quot; 
  &quot;We must wait and see,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;Send two of your men to   investigate, Mac. I will rejoin you after I have taken Miss   d'Arcambal over to Cassidy's wife.&quot; 
  He moved away quickly with Jeanne. On a sudden rise of the wind   from the south the firing came to them more distinctly. Then it  died  away, and ended in three or four intermittent shots. For the  space of  a dozen seconds a strange stillness followed, and then  over the  mountain top, where there was still a faint glow in the  sky, there  came the low, quavering, triumphal cry of the Crees: a  cry born of the  forest itself, mournful even in its joy, only half  human&#8212;almost like  a far-away burst of tongue from a wolf pack on  the hunt trail. And  after that there was an unbroken silence. 
  &quot;It is over,&quot; breathed Philip. 
  He felt Jeanne's fingers tighten about his own. 
  &quot;No one will ever know,&quot; he continued. &quot;Even MacDougall will not   guess what has happened out there&#8212;to-night.&quot; 
  He stopped a dozen paces from Cassidy's cabin. The windows were   aglow, and they could hear the laughter and play of Cassidy's two   children within. Gently he drew Jeanne to him. 
  &quot;You will stay here to-night, dear,&quot; he said. &quot;To-morrow we will   go to Fort o' God.&quot; 
  &quot;You must take me home to-night,&quot; whispered Jeanne, looking up   into his face. &quot;I must go, Philip. Send some one with me, and you  can  come&#8212;in the morning&#8212;with Pierre&#8212;&quot; 
  She put her hand to his face again, in the sweet touch that told   more of her love than a thousand words. 
  &quot;You understand, dear,&quot; she went on, seeing the anxiety in his   eyes. &quot;I have the strength&#8212;to-night. I must return to father,  and he  will know everything&#8212;when you come to Fort o' God.&quot; 
  &quot;I will send MacDougall with you,&quot; said Philip, after a moment.   &quot;And then I will follow&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;With Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, with Pierre.&quot; 
  For a brief space longer they stood outside of Cassidy's cabin,   and then Philip, lifting her face, said gently: 
  &quot;Will you kiss me, dear? It is the first time.&quot; 
  He bent down, and Jeanne's lips reached his own. 
  &quot;No, it is not the first time,&quot; she confessed, in a whisper. &quot;Not   since that day&#8212;when I thought you were dying&#8212;after we came  through  the rapids&#8212;&quot; 
  Five minutes later Philip returned to MacDougall. Roberts,   Henshaw, Cassidy, and Lecault were with the engineer. 
  &quot;I've sent the St. Pierres to find out about the firing,&quot; he said.   &quot;Look at the crowd over at the store. Every one heard it, and  they've  seen the fire on the mountain. They think the Indians have  cornered a  moose or two and are shooting them by the blaze.&quot; 
  &quot;They're probably right,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I want a word with you,   Mac.&quot; 
  He walked a little aside with the engineer, leaving the others in   a group, and in a low voice told him as much as he cared to reveal   about the identity of Thorpe and Gregson's mission in camp. Then  he  spoke of Jeanne. 
  &quot;I believe that the death of Thorpe practically ends all danger to   us,&quot; he concluded. &quot;I'm going to offer you a pleasanter job than   fighting, Mac. It is imperative that Miss d'Arcambal should return  to  D'Arcambal House before morning, and I want you to take her, if  you  will. I'm choosing the best man I've got because&#8212;well,  because she's  going to be my wife, Mac. I'm the happiest man on  earth to-night!&quot; 
  MacDougall did not show surprise. 
  &quot;Guessed it,&quot; he said, shortly, thrusting out a hand and grinning   broadly into Philip's face &quot;Couldn't help from seeing, Phil. And  the  firing, and Thorpe, and that half-breed in there&#8212;&quot; 
  Understanding was slowly illuminating his face. 
  &quot;You'll know all about them a little later, Mac,&quot; said Philip   softly. &quot;To-night we must investigate nothing&#8212;very far. Miss   d'Arcambal must be taken home immediately. Will you go?&quot; 
  &quot;With pleasure.&quot; 
  &quot;She can ride one of the horses as far as the Little Churchill,&quot;   continued Philip. &quot;And there she will show you a canoe. I will  follow  in the morning with the body of Pierre, the half-breed.&quot; 
  A quarter of an hour later MacDougall and Jeanne set out over the   river trail, leaving Philip standing behind, watching them until  they  were hidden in the night. It was fully an hour later before  the St.  Pierres returned. Philip was uneasy until the two dark-  faced hunters  came into the little office and leaned their rifles  against the wall.  He had feared that Sachigo might have left some  trace of his ambush  behind. But the St. Pierres had discovered  nothing, and could give  only one reason for the burning pine on  the summit of the mountain.  They agreed that Indians had fired it  to frighten moose from a thick  cover to the south and west, and  that their hunt had been a failure. 
  It was midnight before Philip relaxed his caution, which he   maintained until then in spite of his belief that Thorpe's men,  under  Blake, had met a quick finish at the hands of Sachigo and  his ambushed  braves. His men left for their cabins, with the  exception of Cassidy,  whom he asked to spend the remainder of the  night in one of the office  bunks. Alone he went in to prepare  Pierre for his last journey to Fort  o' God. 
  A lamp was burning low beside the bunk in which Pierre lay. Philip   approached and turned the wick higher, and then he gazed in wonder   upon the transfiguration in the half-breed's face. Pierre had died   with a smile on his lips; and with a curious thickening in his  throat  Philip thought that those lips, even in death, were craved  in the act  of whispering Jeanne's name. It seemed to him, as he  stood in silence  for many moments, that Pierre was not dead, but  that he was sleeping a  quiet, unbreathing sleep, in which there  came to him visions of the  great love for which he had offered up  his life and his soul. Jeanne's  hands, in his last moments, had  stilled all pain. Peace slumbered in  the pale shadows of his  closed eyes. The Great God of his faith had  come to him in his  hour of greatest need on earth, and he had passed  away into the  Valley of Silent Men on the sweet breath of Jeanne's  prayers. The  girl had crossed his hands upon his breast. She had  brushed back  his long hair. Philip knew that she had imprinted a kiss  upon the  silent lips before the soul had fled, and in the warmth and   knowledge of that kiss Pierre had died happy. 
  And Philip, brokenly, said aloud: 
  &quot;God bless you, Pierre, old man!&quot; 
  He lifted the cold hands back, and gently drew the covers which   had hidden the telltale stains of death from Jeanne's eyes. He  turned  down Pierre's shirt, and in the lamp-glow there glistened  the golden  locket. For the first time he noticed it closely. It  was half as large  as the palm of his hand, and very thin, and he  saw that it was bent  and twisted. A shudder ran through him when  he understood what had  happened. The bullet that had killed Pierre  had first struck the  locket, and had burst it partly open. He took  it in his hand. And then  he saw that through the broken side there  protruded the end of a bit  of paper. For a brief space the  discovery made him almost forget the  presence of death. Pierre had  never opened the locket, because it was  of the old-fashioned kind  that locked with a key, and the key was  gone. And the locket had  been about Jeanne's neck when he found her  out in the snows! Was  it possible that this bit of paper had something  to do with the  girl he loved? 
  Carefully, so that it would not tear, he drew it forth. There was   writing on the paper, as he had expected, and he read it, bent low   beside the lamp. The date was nearly eighteen years old. The lines   were faint. The words were these: 
  MY HUSBAND,&#8212;God can never undo what I have done. I have dragged   myself back, repentant, loving you more than I have ever loved you  in  my life, to leave our little girl with you. She is your  daughter, and  mine. She was born on the eighth day of September,  the seventh month  after I left Fort o' God, She is yours, and so I  bring her back to  you, with the prayer that she will help to fill  the true and noble  heart that I have broken. I cannot ask your  forgiveness, for I do not  deserve it. I cannot let you see me, for  I should kill myself at your  feet. I have lived this long only for  the baby. I will leave her where  you cannot fail to find her, and  by the time you have read this I will  have answered for my sin&#8212;  my madness, if you can have charity regard  it so. And if God is  kind I will hover about you always, and you will  know that in  death the old sweetheart, and the mother, has found what  she could  never again hope for in life. 
  YOUR WIFE. 
  Philip rose slowly erect and gazed down into the still, tranquil   face of Pierre, the half-breed. 
  &quot;Why didn't you open it?&quot; he whispered. &quot;Why didn't you open it?   My God, what it would have saved&#8212;&quot; 
  For a full minute he looked down at Pierre, as though he expected   that the white lips would move and answer him. And then he thought  of  Jeanne hurrying to Fort o' God, and of the terrible things  which she  was to reveal to her father that night. She was  D'Arcambal's own  daughter. What pain&#8212;what agony of father and  child he might have  saved if he had examined the locket a little  sooner! He looked at his  watch and found that Jeanne had been gone  three hours. It would be  impossible to overtake MacDougall and the  girl unless something had  occurred to delay them somewhere along  the trail. He hurried back into  the little room, where he had left  Cassidy. In a few words he  explained that it was necessary for him  to follow Jeanne and the  engineer to D'Arcambal House without a  moment's delay, and he directed  Cassidy to take charge of camp  affairs, and to send Pierre's body with  a suitable escort the next  day. 
  &quot;It isn't necessary for me to tell you what to do,&quot; he finished,   &quot;You understand.&quot; 
  Cassidy nodded. Six months before he had buried his youngest child   under a big spruce back of his cabin. 
  Philip hastened to the stables, and, choosing one of the lighter   animals, was soon galloping over the trail toward the Little   Churchill. In his face there blew a cold wind from Hudson's Bay,  and  now and then he felt the sting of fine particles in his eyes.  They  were the presage of storm. A shifting of the wind a little to  the east  and south, and the fine particles would thicken, and turn  into snow.  By morning the world would be white. He came into the  forests beyond  the plain, and in the spruce and the cedar tops the  wind was half a  gale, filling the night with wailing and moaning  sounds that sent  strange shivers through him as he thought of  Pierre in the cabin. In  such a way, he imagined, had the north  wind swept across the cold  barrens on the night that Pierre had  found the woman and the babe; and  now it seemed, in his fancies,  as though above and about him the great  hand that had guided the  half-breed then was bringing back the old  night, as if Pierre, in  dying, had wished it so. For the wind changed.  The fine particles  thickened, and changed to snow. And then there was  no longer the  wailing and the moaning in the tree-tops, but the soft  murmur of a  white deluge that smothered him in a strange gloom and hid  the  trail. There were two canoes concealed at the end of the trail on   the Little Churchill, and Philip chose the smallest. He followed   swiftly after MacDougall and Jeanne. He could no longer see either   side of the stream, and he was filled with a fear that he might  pass  the little creek that led to Fort o' God. He timed himself by  his  watch, and when he had paddled for two hours he ran in close  to the  west shore, traveling so slowly that he did not progress a  mile in  half an hour. And then suddenly, from close ahead, there  rose through  the snow-gloom the dismal howl of a dog, which told  him that he was  near to Fort o' God. He found the black opening  that marked the  entrance to the creek, and when he ran upon the  sand-bar a hundred  yards beyond he saw lights burning in the great  room where he had  first seen D'Arcambal. He went now where Pierre  had led him that  night, and found the door unlocked. He entered  silently, and passed  down the dark hall until, on the left, he saw  a glow of light that  came from the big room. Something in the  silence that was ahead of him  made his own approach without sound,  and softly he entered through the  door. 
  In the great chair sat the master of Fort o' God, his gray head   bent; at his feet knelt Jeanne, and so close were they that   D'Arcambal's face was hidden in Jeanne's shining, disheveled hair.  No  sooner had Philip entered the room than his presence seemed to  arouse  the older man. He lifted his head slowly, looking toward  the door, and  when he saw who stood there he raised one of his  arms from about the  girl and held it out to Philip. 
  &quot;My son!&quot; he said. 
  In a moment Philip was upon his knees beside Jeanne, and one of   D'Arcambal's heavy hands fell upon his shoulder in a touch that  told  him he had come too late to keep back any part of the  terrible story  which Jeanne had bared to him. The girl did not  speak when she saw him  beside her. It was as if she had expected  him to come, and her hand  found his and nestled in it, as cold as  ice. 
  &quot;I have hurried from the camp,&quot; he said. &quot;I tried to overtake   Jeanne. About Pierre's neck I found a locket, and in the locket&#8212;  was  this&#8212;&quot; 
  He looked into D'Arcambal's haggard face as he gave him the blood-   stained note, and he knew that in the moment that was to come the   master of Fort o' God and his daughter should be alone. 
  &quot;I will wait in the portrait-room,&quot; he said, in a low voice, and   as he rose to his feet he pressed Jeanne's hand to his lips. 
  The old room was as he had left it weeks before. The picture of   Jeanne's mother still hung with its face to the wall. There was  the  same elusive movement of the portrait over the volume of warm  air that  rose from the floor. In this room he seemed to breathe  again the  presence of a warm spirit of life, as he had felt it on  the first  night&#8212;a spirit that seemed to him to be a part of  Jeanne herself, and  he thought of the last words of the wife and  mother&#8212;of her promise to  remain always near those whom she loved,  to regain after death the  companionship which she could never hope  for in life. And then there  came to him a thought of the vast and  wonderful mystery of death, and  he wondered if it was her spirit  that had been with him more than one  lonely night, when his camp-  fire was low; if it was her presence that  had filled him with  transcendent dreams of hope and love, coming to  him that night  beside the rock at Churchill, and leading him at last  to Jeanne,  for whom she had given up her life. He heard again the  rising of  the wind outside and the beating of the storm against the  window,  and he went softly to see if his vision could penetrate into  the  white, twisting gloom beyond the glass. For many minutes he stood,   seeing nothing. And then he heard a sound, and turned to see  Jeanne  and her father standing in the door. Glory was in the face  of the  master of Fort o' God. He seemed not to see Philip&#8212;he  seemed to see  nothing but the picture that was turned against the  wall. He strode  across the room, his great shoulders straightened,  his shaggy head  erect, and with the pride of one revealing first  to human eyes the  masterpiece of his soul and life he turned the  picture so that the  radiant face of the wife and mother looked  down upon him. And was it  fancy that for a fleeting moment the  smile left the beautiful lips,  and a light, soft and luminous,  pleading for love and forgiveness,  filled the eyes of Jeanne's  mother? Philip trembled. Jeanne came  across to him silently, and  crept into his arms. And then, slowly, the  master of Fort o' God  turned toward them and stretched out both of his  great arms. 
  &quot;My children!&quot; he said.
