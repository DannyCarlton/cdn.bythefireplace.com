The twelfth of August saw us, as usual, at Seldon Castle,  Ross-shire. It is part of Charles's restless, roving temperament  that, on the morning of the eleventh, wet or fine, he must set out  from London, whether the House is sitting or not, in defiance of  the most urgent three-line whips; and at dawn on the twelfth he must  be at work on his moors, shooting down the young birds with might  and main, at the earliest possible legal moment.    
He goes on like Saul, slaying his thousands, or, like David, his  tens of thousands, with all the guns in the house to help him, till  the keepers warn him he has killed as many grouse as they consider  desirable; and then, having done his duty, as he thinks, in this  respect, he retires precipitately with flying colours to Brighton,  Nice, Monte Carlo, or elsewhere. He must be always "on the trek";  when he is buried, I believe he will not be able to rest quiet in  his grave: his ghost will walk the world to terrify old ladies.    
"At Seldon, at least," he said to me, with a sigh, as he stepped  into his Pullman, "I shall be safe from that impostor!"    
And indeed, as soon as he had begun to tire a little of counting  up his hundreds of brace per diem, he found a trifling piece of  financial work cut ready to his hand, which amply distracted his  mind for the moment from Colonel Clay, his accomplices, and his  villainies.    
Sir Charles, I ought to say, had secured during that summer a very  advantageous option in a part of Africa on the Transvaal frontier,  rumoured to be auriferous. Now, whether it was auriferous or not  before, the mere fact that Charles had secured some claim on it  naturally made it so; for no man had ever the genuine Midas-touch  to a greater degree than Charles Vandrift: whatever he handles turns  at once to gold, if not to diamonds. Therefore, as soon as my  brother-in-law had obtained this option from the native vendor (a  most respected chief, by name Montsioa), and promoted a company  of his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord  Craig-Ellachie (formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately  secured a similar option of an adjacent track, the larger part of  which had pretty much the same geological conditions as that covered  by Sir Charles's right of pre-emption.    
We were not wholly disappointed, as it turned out, in the result.  A month or two later, while we were still at Seldon, we received  a long and encouraging letter from our prospectors on the spot,  who had been hunting over the ground in search of gold-reefs. They  reported that they had found a good auriferous vein in a corner of  the tract, approachable by adit-levels; but, unfortunately, only a  few yards of the lode lay within the limits of Sir Charles's area.  The remainder ran on at once into what was locally known as  Craig-Ellachie's section.    
However, our prospectors had been canny, they said; though young  Mr. Granton was prospecting at the same time, in the self-same  ridge, not very far from them, his miners had failed to discover  the auriferous quartz; so our men had held their tongues about it,  wisely leaving it for Charles to govern himself accordingly.    
"Can you dispute the boundary?" I asked.    
"Impossible," Charles answered. "You see, the limit is a meridian  of longitude. There's no getting over that. Can't pretend to deny  it. No buying over the sun! No bribing the instruments! Besides,  we drew the line ourselves. We've only one way out of it, Sey.  Amalgamate! Amalgamate!"    
Charles is a marvellous man! The very voice in which he murmured  that blessed word "Amalgamate!" was in itself a poem.    
"Capital!" I answered. "Say nothing about it, and join forces with  Craig-Ellachie."    
Charles closed one eye pensively.    
That very same evening came a telegram in cipher from our chief  engineer on the territory of the option: "Young Granton has somehow  given us the slip and gone home. We suspect he knows all. But we  have not divulged the secret to anybody."    
"Seymour," my brother-in-law said impressively, "there is no time to  be lost. I must write this evening to Sir David--I mean to My Lord.  Do you happen to know where he is stopping at present?"    
"The Morning Post announced two or three days ago that he was at  Glen-Ellachie," I answered.    
"Then I'll ask him to come over and thrash the matter out with me,"  my brother-in-law went on. "A very rich reef, they say. I must have  my finger in it!"    
We adjourned into the study, where Sir Charles drafted, I must  admit, a most judicious letter to the rival capitalist. He pointed  out that the mineral resources of the country were probably great,  but as yet uncertain. That the expense of crushing and milling might  be almost prohibitive. That access to fuel was costly, and its  conveyance difficult. That water was scarce, and commanded by our  section. That two rival companies, if they happened to hit upon ore,  might cut one another's throats by erecting two sets of furnaces or  pumping plants, and bringing two separate streams to the spot,  where one would answer. In short--to employ the golden word--that  amalgamation might prove better in the end than competition; and  that he advised, at least, a conference on the subject.    
I wrote it out fair for him, and Sir Charles, with the air of a  Cromwell, signed it.    
"This is important, Sey," he said. "It had better be registered,  for fear of falling into improper hands. Don't give it to Dobson;  let Cesarine take it over to Fowlis in the dog-cart."    
It is the drawback of Seldon that we are twelve miles from a  railway station, though we look out on one of the loveliest firths  in Scotland.    
Cesarine took it as directed--an invaluable servant, that girl!  Meanwhile, we learned from the Morning Post next day that young  Mr. Granton had stolen a march upon us. He had arrived from Africa  by the same mail with our agent's letter, and had joined his father  at once at Glen-Ellachie.    
Two days later we received a most polite reply from the opposing  interest. It ran after this fashion:--    
"CRAIG-ELLACHIE LODGE,    
"GLEN-ELLACHIE, INVERNESS-SHIRE.    
"DEAR SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Thanks for yours of the 20th. In reply,  I can only say I fully reciprocate your amiable desire that nothing  adverse to either of our companies should happen in South Africa.  With regard to your suggestion that we should meet in person, to  discuss the basis of a possible amalgamation, I can only say my  house is at present full of guests--as is doubtless your own--and  I should therefore find it practically impossible to leave  Glen-Ellachie. Fortunately, however, my son David is now at home  on a brief holiday from Kimberley; and it will give him great  pleasure to come over and hear what you have to say in favour of an  arrangement which certainly, on some grounds, seems to me desirable  in the interests of both our concessions alike. He will arrive  to-morrow afternoon at Seldon, and he is authorised, in every  respect, to negotiate with full powers on behalf of myself and the  other directors. With kindest regards to your wife and sons, I  remain, dear Sir Charles, yours faithfully,    
"CRAIG-ELLACHIE."    
"Cunning old fox!" Sir Charles exclaimed, with a sniff. "What's he  up to now, I wonder? Seems almost as anxious to amalgamate as we  ourselves are, Sey." A sudden thought struck him. "Do you know,"  he cried, looking up, "I really believe the same thing must have  happened to <i>both</i> our exploring parties. <i>They</i> must have found a  reef that goes under <i>our</i> ground, and the wicked old rascal wants  to cheat us out of it!"    
"As we want to cheat him," I ventured to interpose.    
Charles looked at me fixedly. "Well, if so, we're both in luck,"  he murmured, after a pause; "though <i>we</i> can only get to know the  whereabouts of <i>their</i> find by joining hands with them and showing  them ours. Still, it's good business either way. But I shall be  cautious--cautious."    
"What a nuisance!" Amelia cried, when we told her of the incident.  "I suppose I shall have to put the man up for the night--a nasty,  raw-boned, half-baked Scotchman, you may be certain."    
On Wednesday afternoon, about three, young Granton arrived. He was  a pleasant-featured, red-haired, sandy-whiskered youth, not unlike  his father; but, strange to say, he dropped in to call, instead of  bringing his luggage.    
"Why, you're not going back to Glen-Ellachie to-night, surely?"  Charles exclaimed, in amazement. "Lady Vandrift will be <i>so</i>  disappointed! Besides, this business can't be arranged between  two trains, do you think, Mr. Granton?"    
Young Granton smiled. He had an agreeable smile--canny, yet open.    
"Oh no," he said frankly. "I didn't mean to go back. I've put up at  the inn. I have my wife with me, you know--and, I wasn't invited."    
Amelia was of opinion, when we told her this episode, that David  Granton wouldn't stop at Seldon because he was an Honourable.  Isabel was of opinion he wouldn't stop because he had married an  unpresentable young woman somewhere out in South Africa. Charles was  of opinion that, as representative of the hostile interest, he put  up at the inn, because it might tie his hands in some way to be the  guest of the chairman of the rival company. And <i>I</i> was of opinion  that he had heard of the castle, and knew it well by report as the  dullest country-house to stay at in Scotland.    
However that may be, young Granton insisted on remaining at the  Cromarty Arms, though he told us his wife would be delighted to  receive a call from Lady Vandrift and Mrs. Wentworth. So we all  returned with him to bring the Honourable Mrs. Granton up to tea  at the Castle.    
She was a nice little thing, very shy and timid, but by no means  unpresentable, and an evident lady. She giggled at the end of every  sentence; and she was endowed with a slight squint, which somehow  seemed to point all her feeble sallies. She knew little outside  South Africa; but of that she talked prettily; and she won all  our hearts, in spite of the cast in her eye, by her unaffected  simplicity.    
Next morning Charles and I had a regular debate with young Granton  about the rival options. Our talk was of cyanide processes,  reverberatories, pennyweights, water-jackets. But it dawned upon us  soon that, in spite of his red hair and his innocent manners, our  friend, the Honourable David Granton, knew a thing or two. Gradually  and gracefully he let us see that Lord Craig-Ellachie had sent him  for the benefit of the company, but that <i>he</i> had come for the  benefit of the Honourable David Granton.    
"I'm a younger son, Sir Charles," he said; "and therefore I have to  feather my nest for myself. I know the ground. My father will be  guided implicitly by what I advise in the matter. We are men of the  world. Now, let's be business-like. <i>You</i> want to amalgamate. You  wouldn't do that, of course, if you didn't know of something to the  advantage of my father's company--say, a lode on our land--which you  hope to secure for yourself by amalgamation. Very well; <i>I</i> can make  or mar your project. If you choose to render it worth my while, I'll  induce my father and his directors to amalgamate. If you don't, I  won't. That's the long and the short of it!"    
Charles looked at him admiringly.    
"Young man," he said, "you're deep, very deep--for your age. Is this  candour--or deception? Do you mean what you say? Or do you know some  reason why it suits your father's book to amalgamate as well as it  suits mine? And are you trying to keep it from me?" He fingered his  chin. "If I only knew that," he went on, "I should know how to deal  with you."    
Young Granton smiled again. "You're a financier, Sir Charles," he  answered. "I wonder, at your time of life, you should pause to ask  another financier whether he's trying to fill his own pocket--or his  father's. Whatever is my father's goes to his eldest son--and <i>I</i> am  his youngest."    
"You are right as to general principles," Sir Charles replied, quite  affectionately. "Most sound and sensible. But how do I know you  haven't bargained already in the same way with your father? You  may have settled with <i>him</i>, and be trying to diddle me."    
The young man assumed a most candid air. "Look here," he said,  leaning forward. "I offer you this chance. Take it or leave it. <i>Do</i>  you wish to purchase my aid for this amalgamation by a moderate  commission on the net value of my father's option to yourself--which  I know approximately?"    
"Say five per cent," I suggested, in a tentative voice, just to  justify my presence.    
He looked me through and through. "<i>Ten</i> is more usual," he  answered, in a peculiar tone and with a peculiar glance.    
Great heavens, how I winced! I knew what his words meant. They were  the very words I had said myself to Colonel Clay, as the Count von  Lebenstein, about the purchase-money of the schloss--and in the very  same accent. I saw through it all now. That beastly cheque! This  was Colonel Clay; and he was trying to buy up my silence and  assistance by the threat of exposure!    
My blood ran cold. I didn't know how to answer him. What happened  at the rest of that interview I really couldn't tell you. My brain  reeled round. I heard just faint echoes of "fuel" and "reduction  works." What on earth was I to do? If I told Charles my  suspicion--for it was only a suspicion--the fellow might turn upon  me and disclose the cheque, which would suffice to ruin me. If I  didn't, I ran a risk of being considered by Charles an accomplice  and a confederate.    
The interview was long. I hardly know how I struggled through it.  At the end young Granton went off, well satisfied, if it was young  Granton; and Amelia invited him and his wife up to dinner at the  castle.    
Whatever else they were, they were capital company. They stopped  for three days more at the Cromarty Arms. And Charles debated and  discussed incessantly. He couldn't quite make up his mind what to  do in the affair; and <i>I</i> certainly couldn't help him. I never was  placed in such a fix in my life. I did my best to preserve a strict  neutrality.    
Young Granton, it turned out, was a most agreeable person; and so,  in her way, was that timid, unpretending South African wife of his.  She was naively surprised Amelia had never met her mamma at Durban.  They both talked delightfully, and had lots of good stories--mostly  with points that told against the Craig-Ellachie people. Moreover,  the Honourable David was a splendid swimmer. He went out in a boat  with us, and dived like a seal. He was burning to teach Charles  and myself to swim, when we told him we could neither of us take a  single stroke; he said it was an accomplishment incumbent upon every  true Englishman. But Charles hates the water; while, as for myself,  I detest every known form of muscular exercise.    
However, we consented that he should row us on the Firth, and made  an appointment one day with himself and his wife for four the next  evening.    
That night Charles came to me with a very grave face in my own  bedroom. "Sey," he said, under his breath, "have you observed?  Have you watched? Have you any suspicions?"    
I trembled violently. I felt all was up. "Suspicions of whom?"  I asked. "Not surely of Simpson?" (he was Sir Charles's valet).    
My respected brother-in-law looked at me contemptuously.    
"Sey," he said, "are you trying to take me in? No, <i>not</i> of Simpson:  of these two young folks. My own belief is--they're Colonel Clay  and Madame Picardet."    
"Impossible!" I cried.    
He nodded. "I'm sure of it."    
"How do you know?"    
"Instinctively."    
I seized his arm. "Charles," I said, imploring him, "do nothing  rash. Remember how you exposed yourself to the ridicule of fools  over Dr. Polperro!"    
"I've thought of that," he answered, "and I mean to ca' caller."  (When in Scotland as laird of Seldon, Charles loves both to dress  and to speak the part thoroughly.) "First thing to-morrow I shall  telegraph over to inquire at Glen-Ellachie; I shall find out  whether this is really young Granton or not; meanwhile, I shall keep  my eye close upon the fellow."    
Early next morning, accordingly, a groom was dispatched with a  telegram to Lord Craig-Ellachie. He was to ride over to Fowlis, send  it off at once, and wait for the answer. At the same time, as it was  probable Lord Craig-Ellachie would have started for the moors before  the telegram reached the Lodge, I did not myself expect to see the  reply arrive much before seven or eight that evening. Meanwhile, as  it was far from certain we had not the real David Granton to deal  with, it was necessary to be polite to our friendly rivals. Our  experience in the Polperro incident had shown us both that too much  zeal may be more dangerous than too little. Nevertheless, taught  by previous misfortunes, we kept watching our man pretty close,  determined that on this occasion, at least, he should neither do us  nor yet escape us.    
About four o'clock the red-haired young man and his pretty little  wife came up to call for us. She looked so charming and squinted  so enchantingly, one could hardly believe she was not as simple  and innocent as she seemed to be. She tripped down to the Seldon  boat-house, with Charles by her side, giggling and squinting her  best, and then helped her husband to get the skiff ready. As she did  so, Charles sidled up to me. "Sey," he whispered, "I'm an old hand,  and I'm not readily taken in. I've been talking to that girl, and  upon my soul I think she's all right. She's a charming little lady.  We may be mistaken after all, of course, about young Granton. In any  case, it's well for the present to be courteous. A most important  option! If it's really he, we must do nothing to annoy him or let  him see we suspect him."    
I had noticed, indeed, that Mrs. Granton had made herself most  agreeable to Charles from the very beginning. And as to one thing he  was right. In her timid, shrinking way she was undeniably charming.  That cast in her eye was all pure piquancy.    
We rowed out on to the Firth, or, to be more strictly correct, the  two Grantons rowed while Charles and I sat and leaned back in the  stern on the luxurious cushions. They rowed fast and well. In a very  few minutes they had rounded the point and got clear out of sight  of the Cockneyfied towers and false battlements of Seldon.    
Mrs. Granton pulled stroke. Even as she rowed she kept up a brisk  undercurrent of timid chaff with Sir Charles, giggling all the  while, half forward, half shy, like a school-girl who flirts with  a man old enough to be her grandfather.    
Sir Charles was flattered. He is susceptible to the pleasures of  female attention, especially from the young, the simple, and the  innocent. The wiles of women of the world he knows too well; but a  pretty little ingenue can twist him round her finger. They rowed on  and on, till they drew abreast of Seamew's island. It is a jagged  stack or skerry, well out to sea, very wild and precipitous on the  landward side, but shelving gently outward; perhaps an acre in  extent, with steep gray cliffs, covered at that time with crimson  masses of red valerian. Mrs. Granton rowed up close to it. "Oh, what  lovely flowers!" she cried, throwing her head back and gazing at  them. "I wish I could get some! Let's land here and pick them. Sir  Charles, you shall gather me a nice bunch for my sitting-room."    
Charles rose to it innocently, like a trout to a fly.    
"By all means, my dear child, I--I have a passion for flowers;"  which was a flower of speech itself, but it served its purpose.    
They rowed us round to the far side, where is the easiest  landing-place. It struck me as odd at the moment that they seemed  to know it. Then young Granton jumped lightly ashore; Mrs. Granton  skipped after him. I confess it made me feel rather ashamed to see  how clumsily Charles and I followed them, treading gingerly on the  thwarts for fear of upsetting the boat, while the artless young  thing just flew over the gunwale. So like White Heather! However,  we got ashore at last in safety, and began to climb the rocks as  well as we were able in search of the valerian.    
Judge of our astonishment when next moment those two young people  bounded back into the boat, pushed off with a peal of merry  laughter, and left us there staring at them!    
They rowed away, about twenty yards, into deep water. Then the man  turned, and waved his hand at us gracefully. "Good-bye!" he said,  "good-bye! Hope you'll pick a nice bunch! We're off to London!"    
"Off!" Charles exclaimed, turning pale. "Off! What do you mean?  You don't surely mean to say you're going to leave us here?"    
The young man raised his cap with perfect politeness, while Mrs.  Granton smiled, nodded, and kissed her pretty hand to us. "Yes,"  he answered; "for the present. We retire from the game. The fact  of it is, it's a trifle too thin: this is a coup manque."    
"A <i>what</i>?" Charles exclaimed, perspiring visibly.    
"A coup manque," the young man replied, with a compassionate smile.  "A failure, don't you know; a bad shot; a fiasco. I learn from  my scouts that you sent a telegram by special messenger to Lord  Craig-Ellachie this morning. That shows you suspect me. Now, it is a  principle of my system never to go on for one move with a game when  I find myself suspected. The slightest symptom of distrust, and--I  back out immediately. My plans can only be worked to satisfaction  when there is perfect confidence on the part of my patient. It is  a well-known rule of the medical profession. I <i>never</i> try to bleed  a man who struggles. So now we're off. Ta-ta! Good luck to you!"    
He was not much more than twenty yards away, and could talk to us  quite easily. But the water was deep; the islet rose sheer from I'm  sure I don't know how many fathoms of sea; and we could neither of  us swim. Charles stretched out his arms imploringly. "For Heaven's  sake," he cried, "don't tell me you really mean to leave us here."    
He looked so comical in his distress and terror that Mrs.  Granton--Madame Picardet--whatever I am to call her--laughed  melodiously in her prettiest way at the sight of him. "Dear Sir  Charles," she called out, "pray don't be afraid! It's only a  short and temporary imprisonment. We will send men to take you off.  Dear David and I only need just time enough to get well ashore and  make--oh!--a few slight alterations in our personal appearance."  And she indicated with her hand, laughing, dear David's red wig and  false sandy whiskers, as we felt convinced they must be now. She  looked at them and tittered. Her manner at this moment was anything  but shy. In fact, I will venture to say, it was that of a bold and  brazen-faced hoyden.    
"Then you <i>are</i> Colonel Clay!" Sir Charles cried, mopping his brow  with his handkerchief.    
"If you choose to call me so," the young man answered politely. "I'm  sure it's most kind of you to supply me with a commission in Her  Majesty's service. However, time presses, and we want to push off.  Don't alarm yourselves unnecessarily. I will send a boat to take you  away from this rock at the earliest possible moment consistent with  my personal safety and my dear companion's." He laid his hand on his  heart and struck a sentimental attitude. "I have received too many  unwilling kindnesses at your hands, Sir Charles," he continued,  "not to feel how wrong it would be of me to inconvenience you for  nothing. Rest assured that you shall be rescued by midnight at  latest. Fortunately, the weather just at present is warm, and I see  no chance of rain; so you will suffer, if at all, from nothing worse  than the pangs of temporary hunger."    
Mrs. Granton, no longer squinting--'twas a mere trick she had  assumed--rose up in the boat and stretched out a rug to us. "Catch!"  she cried, in a merry voice, and flung it at us, doubled. It fell  at our feet; she was a capital thrower.    
"Now, you dear Sir Charles," she went on, "take that to keep you  warm! You know I am really quite fond of you. You're not half a  bad old boy when one takes you the right way. You have a human side  to you. Why, I often wear that sweetly pretty brooch you gave me  at Nice, when I was Madame Picardet! And I'm sure your goodness to  me at Lucerne, when I was the little curate's wife, is a thing to  remember. We're so glad to have seen you in your lovely Scotch  home you were always so proud of! <i>Don't</i> be frightened, please. We  wouldn't hurt you for worlds. We <i>are</i> so sorry we have to take this  inhospitable means of evading you. But dear David--I <i>must</i> call  him dear David still--instinctively felt that you were beginning to  suspect us; and he can't bear mistrust. He <i>is</i> so sensitive! The  moment people mistrust him, he <i>must</i> break off with them at once.  This was the only way to get you both off our hands while we make  the needful little arrangements to depart; and we've been driven to  avail ourselves of it. However, I will give you my word of honour,  as a lady, you shall be fetched away to-night. If dear David doesn't  do it, why, I'll do it myself." And she blew another kiss to us.    
Charles was half beside himself, divided between alternate terror  and anger. "Oh, we shall die here!" he exclaimed. "Nobody'd ever  dream of coming to this rock to search for me."    
"What a pity you didn't let me teach you to swim!" Colonel Clay  interposed. "It is a noble exercise, and very useful indeed in such  special emergencies! Well, ta-ta! I'm off! You nearly scored one  this time; but, by putting you here for the moment, and keeping you  till we're gone, I venture to say I've redressed the board, and I  think we may count it a drawn game, mayn't we? The match stands at  three, love--with some thousands in pocket?"    
"You're a murderer, sir!" Charles shrieked out. "We shall starve or  die here!"    
Colonel Clay on his side was all sweet reasonableness. "Now, my dear  sir," he expostulated, one hand held palm outward, "<i>Do</i> you think  it probable I would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, with  so little compunction? No, no, Sir Charles Vandrift; I know too well  how much you are worth to me. I return you on my income-tax paper  as five thousand a year, clear profit of my profession. Suppose you  were to die! I might be compelled to find some new and far less  lucrative source of plunder. Your heirs, executors, or assignees  might not suit my purpose. The fact of it is, sir, your temperament  and mine are exactly adapted one to the other. <i>I</i> understand <i>you</i>;  and <i>you</i> do not understand <i>me</i>--which is often the basis of the  firmest friendships. I can catch you just where you are trying to  catch other people. Your very smartness assists me; for I admit you  <i>are</i> smart. As a regular financier, I allow, I couldn't hold a  candle to you. But in my humbler walk of life I know just how to  utilise you. I lead you on, where you think you are going to gain some  advantage over others; and by dexterously playing upon your love of  a good bargain, your innate desire to best somebody else--I succeed  in besting you. There, sir, you have the philosophy of our mutual  relations."    
He bowed and raised his cap. Charles looked at him and cowered. Yes,  genius as he is, he positively cowered. "And do you mean to say,"  he burst out, "you intend to go on so bleeding me?"    
The Colonel smiled a bland smile. "Sir Charles Vandrift," he  answered, "I called you just now the goose that lays the golden  eggs. You may have thought the metaphor a rude one. But you <i>are</i>  a goose, you know, in certain relations. Smartest man on the Stock  Exchange, I readily admit; easiest fool to bamboozle in the  open country that ever I met with. You fail in one thing--the  perspicacity of simplicity. For that reason, among others, I have  chosen to fasten upon you. Regard me, my dear sir, as a microbe of  millionaires, a parasite upon capitalists. You know the old rhyme:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em, <br> And these again have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum!</small></i></blockquote><br>
Well, that's just how I view myself. <i>You</i> are a capitalist and a  millionaire. In <i>your</i> large way you prey upon society. <i>You</i> deal in  Corners, Options, Concessions, Syndicates. You drain the world  dry of its blood and its money. You possess, like the mosquito, a  beautiful instrument of suction--Founders' Shares--with which you  absorb the surplus wealth of the community. In <i>my</i> smaller way,  again, <i>I</i> relieve you in turn of a portion of the plunder. I am a  Robin Hood of my age; and, looking upon <i>you</i> as an exceptionally bad  form of millionaire--as well as an exceptionally easy form of pigeon  for a man of my type and talents to pluck--I have, so to speak,  taken up my abode upon you."    
Charles looked at him and groaned.    
The young man continued, in a tone of gentle badinage. "I love the  plot-interest of the game," he said, "and so does dear Jessie here.  We both of us adore it. As long as I find such good pickings upon  you, I certainly am not going to turn away from so valuable a  carcass, in order to batten myself, at considerable trouble, upon  minor capitalists, out of whom it is difficult to extract a few  hundreds. It may have puzzled you to guess why I fix upon you so  persistently. Now you know, and understand. When a fluke finds a  sheep that suits him, that fluke lives upon him. You are my host: I  am your parasite. This coup has failed. But don't flatter yourself  for a moment it will be the last one."    
"Why do you insult me by telling me all this?" Sir Charles cried,  writhing.    
The Colonel waved his hand. It was small and white. "Because I <i>love</i>  the game," he answered, with a relish; "and also, because the more  prepared you are beforehand, the greater credit and amusement is  there in besting you. Well, now, ta-ta once more! I am wasting  valuable time. I might be cheating somebody. I must be off at  once.... Take care of yourself, Wentworth. But I know you <i>will</i>.  You always do. Ten per cent <i>is</i> more usual!"    
He rowed away and left us. As the boat began to disappear round the  corner of the island, White Heather--so she looked--stood up in the  stern and shouted aloud through her pretty hands to us. "By-bye,  dear Sir Charles!" she cried. "Do wrap the rug around you! I'll  send the men to fetch you as soon as ever I possibly can. And thank  you so much for those lovely flowers!"    
The boat rounded the crags. We were alone on the island. Charles  flung himself on the bare rock in a wild access of despondency.  He is accustomed to luxury, and cannot get on without his padded  cushions. As for myself, I climbed with some difficulty to the top  of the cliff, landward, and tried to make signals of distress with  my handkerchief to some passer-by on the mainland. All in vain.  Charles had dismissed the crofters on the estate; and, as the  shooting-party that day was in an opposite direction, not a soul  was near to whom we could call for succour.    
I climbed down again to Charles. The evening came on slowly. Cries  of sea-birds rang weird upon the water. Puffins and cormorants  circled round our heads in the gray of twilight. Charles suggested  that they might even swoop down upon us and bite us. They did not,  however, but their flapping wings added none the less a painful  touch of eeriness to our hunger and solitude. Charles was horribly  depressed. For myself, I will confess I felt so much relieved at  the fact that Colonel Clay had not openly betrayed me in the matter  of the commission, as to be comparatively comfortable.    
We crouched on the hard crag. About eleven o'clock we heard human  voices. "Boat ahoy!" I shouted. An answering shout aroused us to  action. We rushed down to the landing-place and cooee'd for the men,  to show them where we were. They came up at once in Sir Charles's  own boat. They were fishermen from Niggarey, on the shore of the  Firth opposite.    
A lady and gentleman had sent them, they said, to return the boat  and call for us on the island; their description corresponded to  the two supposed Grantons. They rowed us home almost in silence to  Seldon. It was half-past twelve by the gatehouse clock when we  reached the castle. Men had been sent along the coast each way to  seek us. Amelia had gone to bed, much alarmed for our safety. Isabel  was sitting up. It was too late, of course, to do much that night in  the way of apprehending the miscreants, though Charles insisted upon  dispatching a groom, with a telegram for the police at Inverness,  to Fowlis.    
Nothing came of it all. A message awaited us from Lord  Craig-Ellachie, to be sure, saying that his son had not left  Glen-Ellachie Lodge; while research the next day and later showed  that our correspondent had never even received our letter. An empty  envelope alone had arrived at the house, and the postal authorities  had been engaged meanwhile, with their usual lightning speed, in  "investigating the matter." Cesarine had posted the letter herself  at Fowlis, and brought back the receipt; so the only conclusion we  could draw was this--Colonel Clay must be in league with somebody  at the post-office. As for Lord Craig-Ellachie's reply, that was a  simple forgery; though, oddly enough, it was written on  Glen-Ellachie paper.    
However, by the time Charles had eaten a couple of grouse, and  drunk a bottle of his excellent Rudesheimer, his spirits and valour  revived exceedingly. Doubtless he inherits from his Boer ancestry a  tendency towards courage of the Batavian description. He was in  capital feather.    
"After all, Sey," he said, leaning back in his chair, "this time  we score one. He has <i>not</i> done us brown; we have at least detected  him. To detect him in time is half-way to catching him. Only the  remoteness of our position at Seldon Castle saved him from capture.  Next set-to, I feel sure, we will not merely spot him, we will also  nab him. I only wish he would try on such a rig in London."    
But the oddest part of it all was this, that from the moment those  two people landed at Niggarey, and told the fishermen there were  some gentlemen stranded on the Seamew's island, all trace of them  vanished. At no station along the line could we gain any news of  them. Their maid had left the inn the same morning with their  luggage, and we tracked her to Inverness; but there the trail  stopped short, no spoor lay farther. It was a most singular and  insoluble mystery.    
Charles lived in hopes of catching his man in London.    
But for my part, I felt there was a show of reason in one last  taunt which the rascal flung back at us as the boat receded: "Sir  Charles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects <i>you</i>.  It persecutes <i>me</i>. That's all the difference."
