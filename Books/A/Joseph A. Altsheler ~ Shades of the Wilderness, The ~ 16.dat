  Harry secured a little sleep toward morning, and, although his  nervous tension had been very great, when he lay down, he felt greatly  strengthened in body and mind. He awakened Dalton in turn, and the two,  securing a hasty breakfast, sat near the older members of the staff,  awaiting orders. The commander-in-chief was at the edge of the little  glade, talking earnestly with Hill, and several other important  generals.
  Harry often saw through the medium of his own feelings, and the rim  of the sun, beginning to show over the eastern edge of the Wilderness,  was blood red. The same crimson and sinister tinge showed through the  west which was yet in the dusk. But in east and west there were certain  areas of light, where the forest fires yet smoldered.
  Both sides had thrown up hasty breastworks of earth or timber, but  the two armies were unusually silent. A space of perhaps a mile and a  half lay between them, but as the light increased neither moved. There  was no crackle of rifle fire along their fronts. The skirmishers,  usually so active, seemed to be exhausted, and the big guns were at  rest. The fierce and tremendous fighting of the two days before seemed  to have taken all the life out of both North and South.
  Harry, inured to war, understood the reasons for silence and lack of  movement. Grant had been drawn into a region that he did not like,  where he could not use his superior numbers to advantage, and he must  be shuddering at the huge losses he had suffered already. He would seek  better ground. Lee too, was in no condition to take advantage of his  successful defense. The old days when he could send Jackson on a great  turning movement, to fall with all the crushing impact of a surprise  upon the Northern flank, were gone forever. Stuart, the brilliant  cavalryman, was there, but his men were not numerous enough, and,  however brilliant, he was not Jackson.
  The sun rose higher. Midmorning came, and the two armies still lay  close. Harry grew stronger in his opinion that they would not fight  again that day, although he watched, like the others, for any sign of  movement in the Northern camp.
  Noon came, and the same dead silence. The fires had burned  themselves out now and the dusk that had reigned over the Wilderness,  before the battle, recovered its ground, thickened still further by the  vast quantities of smoke still hanging low under a cloudy sky. But the  aspect of the Wilderness itself was more mournful than ever. Coals  smoldered in the burned areas, and now and then puffs of wind picked up  the hot ashes and sent them in the faces of the soldiers. Thickets and  bushes had been cut down by bullets and cannon balls, and lay heaped  together in tangled confusion. Back of the lines, the surgeons, with  aching backs, toiled over the wounded, as they had toiled through the  night.
  Harry saw nearly the whole Southern front. The members of Lee's  staff were busy that day, carrying orders to all his generals to  rectify their lines, and to be prepared, to the last detail, for  another tremendous assault. It was not until the afternoon that he was  able to look up the Invincibles again. The two colonels and the two  lieutenants were doing well, and the colonels were happy.
  &#8220;We've already been notified,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot, &#8220;that we're to  retain our organization as a regiment. We're to have about a hundred  new men now, the fragments of destroyed regiments. Of course, they  won't be like the veterans of the Invincibles, but a half-dozen battles  like that of yesterday should lick them into shape.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should think so,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Do you believe that Grant is retreating?&#8221; asked Lieutenant-Colonel  St. Hilaire.
  &#8220;Our scouts don't say so.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then he is merely putting off the evil day. The sooner he withdraws  the more men he will save. No Yankee general can ever get by General  Lee. Keep that in your mind, Harry Kenton.&#8221;
  Harry was silent, but rejoicing to find that his friends would soon  recover from their wounds, he went back to his place, and saw all the  afternoon pass, without any movement indicating battle.
  Night came again and the scouts reported to Lee that the Union army  was breaking camp, evidently with the intention of getting out of the  Wilderness and marching to Fredericksburg. Harry was with the general  when he received the news, and he saw him think over it long. Other  scouts brought in the same evidence.
  Harry did not know what the general thought, but as for himself,  although he was too young to say anything, it was incredible that Grant  should retreat. It was not at all in accordance with his character, now  tested on many fields, and his resources also were too great for  withdrawal.
  But the night was very dark and no definite knowledge yet came out  of it. Lee stayed by his little campfire and received reports. Far  after dusk Harry saw the look of doubt disappear from his eyes, and  then he began to send out messengers. It was evident that he had formed  his opinion, and intended to act upon it at once.
  He beckoned to Harry and Dalton, and bade them go together with  written instructions to General Anderson, who had taken the place of  General Longstreet.
  &#8220;You will stay with General Anderson subject to his orders,&#8221; he  said, as Harry and Dalton, saluting, rode toward Anderson's command.
  Their way led through torn, tangled and burned thickets. Sometimes a  horse sprang violently to one side and neighed in pain. His hoof had  come down on earth, yet so hot that it scorched like fire. Now and then  sparks fell upon them, but they pursued their way, disregarding all  obstacles, and delivered their sealed orders to General Anderson, who  at once gathered up his full force, and marched away from the heart of  the Wilderness toward Spottsylvania Court House.
  Harry surmised that Grant was attempting some great turning  movement, and Lee, divining it, was sending Anderson to meet his  advance. He never knew whether it was positive knowledge or a happy  guess.
  But he was quite sure that the night's ride was one of the most  singular and sinister ever made by an army. If any troops ever marched  through the infernal regions it was they. In this part of the  Wilderness the fires had been of the worst. Trees still smoldered. In  the hollows, where the bushes had grown thickest, were great beds of  coals. The smoke which the low heavy skies kept close to the earth was  thick and hot. Gusts of wind sent showers of sparks flying, and,  despite the greatest care to protect the ammunition, they marched in  constant danger of explosion.
  Harry thought at one time that General Anderson intended to camp in  the Wilderness for the night, but he soon saw that it was impossible.  One could not camp on hot ground in a smoldering forest.
  &#8220;I believe it's a march till day,&#8221; he said to Dalton. &#8220;It's bound to  be. If a man were to lie down here, he'd find himself a mass of cinders  in the morning, and it will take us till daylight and maybe past to get  out of the Wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he didn't burn to death he'd choke to death. I never breathed  such smoke before.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's because it's mixed with ashes and the fumes of burned  gunpowder. A villainous compound like this can't be called air. How  long is it until dawn?&#8221;
  &#8220;About three hours, I think.&#8221;
  &#8220;You remember those old Greek stories about somebody or other going  down to Hades, and then having a hard climb out again. We're the modern  imitators. If this isn't Hades then I don't know what it is.&#8221;
  &#8220;It surely is. Phew, but that hurt!&#8221;
  &#8220;What happened?&#8221;
  &#8220;I brushed my hand against a burning bush. The result was not happy.  Don't imitate me.&#8221;
  Dalton's horse leaped to one side, and he had difficulty in keeping  the saddle. His hoof had been planted squarely in the midst of a mass  of hot twigs.
  &#8220;The sooner I get out of this Inferno or Hades of a place the  happier I'll be!&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;I've never seen the like,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but there's one thing about  it that makes me glad.&#8221;
  &#8220;And what's the saving grace?&#8221;
  &#8220;That it's in Virginia and not in Kentucky, though for the matter of  that it couldn't be in Kentucky.&#8221;
  &#8220;And why couldn't it be in Kentucky?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because there's no such God-forsaken region in all that state of  mine.&#8221;
  &#8220;It certainly gets upon one's soul,&#8221; said Dalton, looking at the  gloomy region, so terribly torn by battle.
  &#8220;But if we keep going we're bound to come out of it some time or  other.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we're not stopping. A man can't make his bed on a mass of  coals, and there'll be no rest for us until we're clear out of the  Wilderness.&#8221;
  They marched on a long time, and, as day dawned, hundreds of voices  united in a shout of gladness. Behind them were the shades of the  Wilderness, that dismal region reeking with slaughter and ruin, and  before them lay firm soil, and green fields, in all the flush of a  brilliant May morning.
  &#8220;Well, we did come out of Hades, Harry,&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;And it does look like Heaven, but the trouble with our Hades,  George, is that the inmates will follow us. Put your glasses to your  eyes and look off there.&#8221;
  &#8220;Horsemen as sure as we're sitting in our own saddles.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Northern horsemen, too. Their uniforms are new enough for me to  tell their color. I take it that Grant's vanguard has moved by our  right flank and has come out of the Wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;And our surmises that we were to meet it are right. Spottsylvania  Court House is not far away, and maybe we are bound for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;And maybe the Yankees are too.&#8221;
  Harry's words were caused by the sound of a distant and scattering  fire. In obedience to an order from Anderson, he and Dalton galloped  forward, and, from a ridge, saw through their glasses a formidable  Union column advancing toward Spottsylvania. As they looked they saw  many men fall and they also saw flashes of flame from bushes and fences  not far from its flank.
  &#8220;Our sharpshooters are there,&#8221; said Harry. And he was right. While  the Union force was advancing in the night Stuart had dismounted many  of his men and using them as skirmishers had incessantly harassed the  march of Grant's vanguard led by Warren.
  &#8220;Each army has been trying to catch the other napping,&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;And neither has succeeded,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Now we make a race for the Spottsylvania ridge,&#8221; said Dalton. &#8220;You  see if we don't! I know this country. It's a strong position there, and  both generals want it.&#8221;
  Dalton was right. A small Union force had already occupied  Spottsylvania, but the heavy Southern division crossing the narrow, but  deep, river Po, drove it out and seized the defensive position.
  Here they rested, while the masses of the two armies swung toward  them, as if preparing for a new battlefield, one that Harry surveyed  with great interest. They were in a land of numerous and deep rivers.  Here were four spreading out, like the fingers of a human hand, without  the thumb, and uniting at the wrist. The fingers were the Mat, the Ta,  the Po, and the Nye, and the unit when they united was called the  Mattopony.
  Lee's army was gathering behind the Po. A large Union force crossed  it on his flank, but, recognizing the danger of such a position,  withdrew. Lee himself came in time. Hill, overcome by illness and old  wounds, was compelled to give up the command of his division, and Early  took his place. Longstreet also was still suffering severely from his  injuries. Lee had but few of the able and daring generals who had  served him in so many fields. But Stuart, the gay and brilliant, the  medieval knight who had such a strong place in the commander-in-chief's  affections, was there. Nor was his plumage one bit less splendid. The  yellow feather stood in his hat. There was no speck or stain on the  broad yellow sash and his undimmed courage was contagious.
  But Harry with his sensitive and imaginative mind, that leaped  ahead, knew their situation to be desperate. His opinion of Grant had  proved to be correct. Although he had found in Lee an opponent far  superior to any other that he had ever faced, the Union general,  undaunted by his repulse and tremendous losses in the Wilderness, was  preparing for a new battle, before the fire from the other had grown  cold.
  He knew too that another strong Union army was operating far to the  south of them, in order to cut them off from Richmond, and scouts had  brought word that a powerful force of cavalry was about to circle upon  their flank. The Confederacy was propped up alone by the Army of  Northern Virginia, which having just fought one great battle was about  to begin another, and by its dauntless commander.
  The Southern admiration for Lee, both as the general and as the man,  can never be shaken. How much greater then was the effect that he  created in the mind of impressionable youth, looking upon him with  youth's own eyes in his moments of supreme danger! He was in very truth  to Harry another Hannibal as great, and better. The long list of his  triumphs, as youth counted them, was indeed superior to those of the  great Carthaginian, and he believed that Lee would repel this new  danger.
  Nearly all that day the two armies constructed breastworks which  stood for many years afterward, but neither made any attempt at serious  work, although there was incessant firing by the skirmishers and an  occasional cannon shot. Harry, whether carrying an order or not, had  ample chance to see, and he noted with increasing alarm the growing  masses of the Union army, as they gathered along the Spottsylvania  front.
  &#8220;Can we beat them?&#8221; &#8220;Can we beat them?&#8221; was the question that he  continually asked himself. He wondered too where the Winchester  regiment and Dick Mason lay, and where the spy, Shepard, was. But  Shepard was not likely to remain long in one place. Skill and courage  such as his would be used to the utmost in a time like this. Doubtless  he was somewhere in the Confederate lines, discovering for Grant the  relatively small size of the army that opposed him.
  Near dusk and having the time he followed his custom and sought the  Invincibles. Both colonels had recovered considerable strength, and,  although one of them could not walk, he would be helped upon his horse  whenever the battle began, and would ride into the thick of it. But the  faces of St. Clair and Happy Tom glowed and their wounds apparently  were forgotten.
  &#8220;Lieutenant Arthur St. Clair and Lieutenant Thomas Langdon are gone  forever,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot. &#8220;In their places we have Major Arthur  St. Clair and Captain Thomas Langdon. All our majors and captains have  been killed, and with our reduced numbers these two will fill their  places, as best they can; and that they can do so most worthily we all  know. They received their promotions this afternoon.&#8221;
  Harry congratulated them both with the greatest warmth. They were  very young for such rank, but in this war the toll of officers was so  great that men sometimes became generals when they were but little  older.
  &#8220;Is it to be to-morrow?&#8221; asked Colonel Talbot.
  &#8220;I think it likely that we'll fight again then,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;And Grant has not yet had enough. He wants a little more of the  same, does he!&#8221;
  &#8220;It would appear so, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I take it without consulting General Lee that he is ready to  deal with the Yankees as he dealt with them in the Wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope so. Good night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good night!&#8221; they called to him, and Harry returned to the staff.  Taylor, the adjutant general, told him and Dalton to lie down and seek  a little sleep. Harry was not at all averse, as he was completely  exhausted again after the tremendous excitement of the battle, and the  long hours of strain and danger. But his nerves were so much on edge  that he could not yet sleep. His eyes were red and smarting from the  smoke and burned powder, and he felt as if accumulated smoke and dust  encased him like a suit of armor.
  &#8220;I'd give a hundred dollars for a good long drink, just as long as I  liked to make it,&#8221; he groaned, &#8220;and I mean a drink of pure cold water,  too.&#8221;
  &#8220;Confederate paper or money?&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;I mean real money, but at the same time you oughtn't to make  invidious comparisons.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then the money's mine, but you can pay me whenever you feel like  it, which I suppose will be never. There's a spring in the thick woods  just back of your quarters. It flows out from under rocks, at the  distance of several yards makes a deep pool, and then the overflow of  the pool goes on through the forest to the Po. Come on, Harry! We'll  luxuriate and then tell the others.&#8221;
  Harry found that it was a most glorious spring, indeed; clear and  cold. He and Dalton drank slowly at first, and then deeply.
  &#8220;I didn't know I could hold so much,&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Let's take another.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let's make it two more.&#8221;
  &#8220;I still follow you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Horace wrote about his old Falernian, and the other wines which he  enjoyed, as he and the leading Roman sports sat around the fountain,  flirting with the girls,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;but I don't believe any wine  ever brewed in Latium was the equal of this water.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've always had an idea that Horace wasn't as gay as he pretended  to be, else he wouldn't have written so much about Chloe and her  comrades. I imagine that an old Roman boy would keep pretty quiet about  his dancing and singing, and not publish it to the public.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, let him be. He's dead and the Romans are dead, and the  Americans are doing their best to kill off one another, but let's  forget it for a few minutes. That pool there is about four feet deep,  the water is clear and the bottom is firm ground; now do you know what  I'm going to do?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and I'm going to do the same. Bet you even that I beat you  into the water.&#8221;
  &#8220;Taken.&#8221;
  They threw off their clothes rapidly, but the splashes were  simultaneous as their bodies struck the water. Although the limits of  the pool were narrow they splashed and paddled there for a while, and  it was a long time since they had known such a luxury. Then they walked  out, dried themselves and spread the good news. All night long the pool  was filled with the bathers, following one another in turn.
  The water taken internally and externally soothed Harry's nerves.  His excitement was gone. A great army with which they were sure to  fight on the morrow was not far away, but for the time he was  indifferent. The morrow could take care of itself. It was night, and he  had permission to go to sleep. Hence he slumbered fifteen minutes  later.
  He slept almost through the night, and, when he was awakened shortly  before dawn, he found that his strength and elasticity had returned. He  and Dalton went down to the spring again, drank many times, and then  ate breakfast with the older members of the staff, a breakfast that  differed very little from that of the common soldiers.
  Then a day or two of waiting, and watching, and of confused but  terrible fighting ensued. The forests were again set on fire by the  bursting shells and they were not able to rescue many of the wounded  from the flames. Vast clouds again floated over the whole region,  drawing a veil of dusk between the soldiers and the sun. But neither  army was willing to attack the other in full force.
  Grant commanding all the armies of the East was moving meanwhile. A  powerful cavalry division, he heard, had got behind Beauregard, who was  to protect Richmond, and was tearing up an important railway line used  by the Confederacy. The daring Sheridan with another great division of  cavalry had gone around Lee's left and was wrecking another railway,  and with it the rations and medical supplies so necessary to the  Confederates. Grant, recognizing his antagonist's skill and courage and  knowing that to succeed he must destroy the main Southern army,  resolved to attack again with his whole force.
  The day had been comparatively quiet and the Army of Northern  Virginia had devoted nearly the whole time to fortifying with  earthworks and breastworks of logs. The young aides, as they rode on  their missions, could easily see the Northern lines through their  glasses. Harry's heart sank as he observed their extent. The Southern  army was sadly reduced in numbers, and Grant could get reinforcement  continually.
  But such is the saving grace of human nature that even in these  moments of suspense, with one terrible battle just over and another  about to begin, soldiers of the Blue and Gray would speak to one  another in friendly fashion in the bushes or across the Po. It was on  the banks of this narrow river that Harry at last saw Shepard once  more. He happened to be on foot that time, the slope being too densely  wooded for his horse, and Shepard hailed him from the other side.
  &#8220;Good day, Mr. Kenton. Don't fire! I want to talk,&#8221; he said, holding  up both hands as a sign of peace.
  &#8220;A curious place for talking,&#8221; Harry could not keep from saying.
  &#8220;So it is, but we're not observed here. It was almost inevitable  while the armies remained face to face that we should meet in time. I  want to tell you that I've met your cousin, Richard Mason, here, and  his commanding officer, Colonel Winchester. Oh, I know much more about  you and your relationships than you think.&#8221;
  &#8220;How is Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;He has not been hurt, nor has Colonel Winchester. Mr. Mason has  received a letter from his home and your home in Pendleton in Kentucky.  The outlaws to the eastward are troublesome, but the town is occupied  by an efficient Union garrison and is in no danger. His mother and all  of his and your old friends, who did not go to the war, are in good  health. He thought that in my various capacities as ranger, scout and  spy I might meet you, and he asked me, if it so happened, to tell these  things to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said Harry very earnestly, &#8220;and I'm truly sorry, Mr.  Shepard, that you and I are on different sides.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose it's too late for you to come over to the Union and the  true cause.&#8221;
  Harry laughed.
  &#8220;You know, Mr. Shepard, there are no traitors in this war.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know it. I was merely jesting.&#8221;
  He slipped into the underbrush and disappeared. Harry confessed to  himself once more that he liked Shepard, but he felt more strongly than  ever that it had become a personal duel between them, and they would  meet yet again in violence.
  That night he had little to do. It was a typical May night in  Virginia, clear and beautiful with an air that would have been a tonic  to the nerves, had it not been for the bitter smoke and odors that yet  lingered from the battle of the Wilderness.
  Before dawn the scouts brought in a rumor that there was a heavy  movement of Federal troops, although they did not know its meaning. It  might portend another flank march by Grant, but a mist that had begun  to rise after midnight hid much from them. The mist deepened into a  fog, which made it harder for the Southern leaders to learn the meaning  of the Northern movement.
  Just as the dawn was beginning to show a little through the fog,  Hancock and Burnside, with many more generals, led a tremendous attack  upon the Southern right center. They had come so silently through the  thickets that for once the Southern leaders were surprised. The Union  veterans, rushing forward in dense columns, stormed and took the  breastworks with the bayonet.
  Many of the Southern troops, sound asleep, awoke to find themselves  in the enemy's hands. Others, having no time to fire them, fought with  clubbed rifles.
  Harry, dozing, was awakened by the terrific uproar. Even before the  dawn had fairly come the battle was raging on a long front. The center  of Lee's army was broken, and the Union troops were pouring into the  gap. Grant had already taken many guns and thousands of prisoners, and  the bulldog of Shiloh and Vicksburg and Chattanooga was hurrying fresh  divisions into the combat to extend and insure his victory. Through the  forests swelled the deep Northern cry of triumph.
  Harry had never before seen the Southern army in such danger, and he  looked at General Lee, who had now mounted Traveller. The turmoil and  confusion in front of them was frightful and indescribable. The Union  troops had occupied an entire Confederate salient, and their generals,  feeling that the moment was theirs, led them on, reckless of life, and  swept everything before them.
  Harry never took his eyes from Lee. The rising sun shot golden beams  through the smoke and disclosed him clearly. His face was calm and his  voice did not shake as he issued his orders with rapidity and  precision. The lion at bay was never more the lion.
  A new line of battle was formed, and the fugitives formed up with  it. Then the Southern troops, uttering once more the fierce rebel yell,  charged directly upon their enemy and under the eye of the great chief  whom they almost worshiped.
  Now Harry for the first time saw his general show excitement. Lee  galloped to the head of one of the Virginia regiments, and ranging his  horse beside the colors snatched off his hat and pointed it at the  enemy. It was a picture which with all the hero worship of youth he  never forgot. It did not even grow dim in his memory&#8212;the great leader  on horseback, his hat in his hand, his eyes fiery, his face flushed,  his hand pointing the way to victory or death.
  It was an occasion, too, when the personal presence of a leader  meant everything. Every man knew Lee and tremendous rolling cheers  greeted his arrival, cheers that could be heard above the thunder of  cannon and rifles. It infused new courage into them and they gathered  themselves for the rush upon their victorious foe.
  Gordon of Georgia, spurring through the smoke, seized Lee's horse by  the bridle. He did not mean to have their commander-in-chief sacrificed  in a charge.
  &#8220;This is no place for you, General Lee!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Go to the rear!&#8221;
  Lee did not yet turn, and Gordon shouted:
  &#8220;These men are Virginians and Georgians who have never failed. Go  back, I entreat you!&#8221;
  Then Gordon turned to the troops and cried, as he rose on his toes  in his stirrups:
  &#8220;Men, you will not fail now!&#8221;
  Back came the answering shout:
  &#8220;No! No!&#8221; and the whole mass of troops burst into one thunderous,  echoing cry:
  &#8220;Lee to the rear! Lee to the rear! Lee to the rear!&#8221;
  Nor would they move until Lee turned and rode back. Then, led by  Gordon, they charged straight upon their foe, who met them with an  equal valor. All day long the battle of Spottsylvania, equal in  fierceness and desperation to that of the Wilderness, swayed to and  fro. To Harry as he remembered them they were much alike. Charge and  defense, defense and charge. Here they gained a little, and there they  lost a little. Now they were stumbling through sanguinary thickets, and  then they rushed across little streams that ran red.
  The firing was rapid and furious to an extraordinary degree. The air  rained shell and bullets. Areas of forest between the two armies were  mowed down. More than one large tree was cut through entirely by rifle  bullets. Other trees here, as in the Wilderness, caught fire and flamed  high.
  Midnight put an end to the battle, with neither gaining the victory  and both claiming it. Harry had lost another horse, killed under him,  and now he walked almost dazed over the terrible field of  Spottsylvania, where nearly thirty thousand men had fallen, and nothing  had yet been decided.
  Yet in Harry's heart the fear of the grim and silent Grant was  growing. The Northern general had fought within a few days two battles,  each the equal of Waterloo, and Harry felt sure that he was preparing  for a third. The combat of the giants was not over, and with an anxious  soul he waited the next dawn. They remained some days longer in the  Wilderness, or the country adjacent to it, and there was much  skirmishing and firing of heavy artillery, but the third great pitched  battle did not come quite as soon as Harry expected. Even Grant,  appalled by the slaughter, hesitated and began to maneuver again by the  flank to get past Lee. Then the fighting between the skirmishers and  heavy detached parties became continuous.
  During the days that immediately followed Harry was much with  Sherburne. The brave colonel was one of Stuart's most trusted officers.  Despite the forests and thickets there was much work for the cavalry to  do, while the two armies circled and circled, each seeking to get the  advantage of the other.
  Sheridan, they heard, was trying to curve about with his horsemen  and reach Richmond, and Stuart, with his cavalry, including  Sherburne's, was sent to intercept him, Harry riding by Sherburne's  side. It was near the close of May, but the air was cool and pleasant,  a delight to breathe after the awful Wilderness.
  Stuart, despite his small numbers, was in his gayest spirits, and  when he overtook the enemy at a little place called Yellow Tavern he  attacked with all his customary fire and vigor. In the height of the  charge, Harry saw him sink suddenly from his horse, shot through the  body. He died not long afterward and the greatest and most brilliant  horseman of the South passed away to join Jackson and so many who had  gone before. Harry was one of the little group who carried the news to  Lee, and he saw how deeply the great leader was affected. So many of  his brave generals had fallen that he was like the head of a family,  bereft.
  Nevertheless the lion still at bay was great and terrible to strike.  It was barely two weeks after Spottsylvania when Lee took up a strong  position at Cold Harbor, and Grant, confident in his numbers and  powerful artillery, attacked straightaway at dawn.
  Harry was in front during that half-hour, the most terrible ever  seen on the American continent, when Northern brigade after brigade  charged to certain death. Lee's men, behind their earthworks, swept the  field with a fire in which nothing could live. The charging columns  fairly melted away before them and when the half-hour was over more  than twelve thousand men in blue lay upon the red field.
  Grant himself was appalled, and the North, which had begun to  anticipate a quick and victorious end of the war, concealed its  disappointment as best it could, and prepared for another campaign.
  Grant and Lee, facing each other, went into trenches along the lines  of Cold Harbor, and the hopes of the young Southern soldiers after the  victory there rose anew. But Harry was not too sanguine, although he  kept his thoughts to himself.
  The officers of the Invincibles had recovered from their wounds, and  Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire,  sitting in a trench, resumed their game of chess.
  Colonel Talbot took a pawn, the first man captured by either since  early spring.
  &#8220;That was quite a victory,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Not important! Not important, Leonidas!&#8221;
  &#8220;And why not, Hector?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because you've left the way to your king easier. I shall promptly  move along that road.&#8221;
  &#8220;As Grant moved through the Wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't depreciate Grant, Leonidas. He never stops pounding. We've  fought two great battles with him in the Wilderness and a third at Cold  Harbor, but he's still out there facing us. Can't you see the Yankees  with your glasses, Harry?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir, quite clearly. They're about to fire a shot from a big  gun in a wood. There it goes!&#8221;
  The deep note of the cannon came to them, passed on, and then rolled  back in echoes like a threat.
 
  Appendix: Transcription notes:
  The following modifications were applied while transcribing the  printed book to etext:
  &nbsp;Chapter 1 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 6, para 1, change &#8220;criticise&#8221; to &#8220;criticize&quot;, for  consistency <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 20, para 6, fix typo, &#8220;calvaryman&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 21, para 8, change &#8220;things&#8221; to &#8220;thing&#8221;
  &nbsp;Chapter 2 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 35, para 2, add missing hyphen in &#8220;commander-in-chief&#8221;
  &nbsp;Chapter 3 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 48, para 1, change &#8220;where-ever&#8221; to &#8220;wherever&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 49, para 2, fix typo, period should be comma <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 49, para 2, change &#8220;gaints&#8221; to &#8220;giants&quot;, which is my best  guess <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to what it should be
  &nbsp;Chapter 4 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 74, para 7, add missing period
  &nbsp;Chapter 7 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 124, para 6, fix typo &#8220;qouth&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 132, para 14, &#8220;Pleasonton&#8221; should be &#8220;Pleasanton&#8221;
  &nbsp;Chapter 10 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 182, para 5, add missing close-quotes
  &nbsp;Chapter 11 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 208, para 6, add missing close-quotes
  &nbsp;Chapter 12 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 229, para 3, fix typo, &#8220;dulplicate&#8221;
  &nbsp;Chapter 13 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 245, para 3, change &#8220;with&#8221; to &#8220;was&#8221;
  &nbsp;Chapter 14 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 260, para 2, removed a badly-misplaced comma
  &nbsp;Chapter 16 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 301, para 4, moved a badly-misplaced comma
  Chapter 2, page 34, para 3 contains  the phrase &#8220;rest and realization&#8221; probably should be &#8220;relaxation&quot;, but  maybe not, so I left it as is.
  The following words were printed with accented vowels or with the  &#8220;ae&#8221; ligature, but these few occurrences hardly warrant an 8-bit  version of the text: <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;cooperation fete reentered Plataea Thermopylae
  As with all the books in this series, there are many instances where  commas seem to be missing or misplaced, but, except as noted above, I  refrained from &#8220;fixing&#8221; these.
