[One of the Bearers soliloquizes:] 
. . . Room in your heart for him, O Mother Earth,<br> Who loved each flower and leaf that made you fair,<br> And sang your praise in verses manifold<br> And delicate, with here and there a line<br> From end to end in blossom like a bough<br> The May breathes on, so rich it was. Some thought<br> The workmanship more costly than the thing<br> Moulded or carved, as in those ornaments<br> Found at Mycaene. And yet Nature's self<br> Works in this wise; upon a blade of grass,<br> Or what small note she lends the woodland thrush,<br> Lavishing endless patience. He was born<br> Artist, not artisan, which some few saw<br> And many dreamed not. As he wrote no odes<br> When Croesus wedded or Maecenas died,<br> And gave no breath to civic feasts and shows,<br> He missed the glare that gilds more facile men--<br> A twilight poet, groping quite alone,<br> Belated, in a sphere where every nest<br> Is emptied of its music and its wings.<br> Not great his gift; yet we can poorly spare<br> Even his slight perfection in an age<br> Of limping triolets and tame rondeaux.<br> He had at least ideals, though unreached,<br> And heard, far off, immortal harmonies,<br> Such as fall coldly on our ear to-day.<br> The mighty Zolaistic Movement now<br> Engrosses us--a miasmatic breath<br> Blown from the slums. We paint life as it is,<br> The hideous side of it, with careful pains,<br> Making a god of the dull Commonplace.<br> For have we not the old gods overthrown<br> And set up strangest idols? We could clip<br> Imagination's wing and kill delight,<br> Our sole art being to leave nothing out<br> That renders art offensive. Not for us<br> Madonnas leaning from their starry thrones<br> Ineffable, nor any heaven-wrought dream<br> Of sculptor or of poet; we prefer<br> Such nightmare visions as in morbid brains<br> Take shape and substance, thoughts that taint the air<br> And make all life unlovely. Will it last?<br> Beauty alone endures from age to age,<br> From age to age endures, handmaid of God.<br> Poets who walk with her on earth go hence<br> Bearing a talisman. You bury one,<br> With his hushed music, in some Potter's Field;<br> The snows and rains blot out his very name,<br> As he from life seems blotted: through Time's glass<br> Slip the invisible and magic sands<br> That mark the century, then falls a day<br> The world is suddenly conscious of a flower,<br> Imperishable, ever to be prized,<br> Sprung from the mould of a forgotten grave.<br> 'Tis said the seeds wrapt up among the balms<br> And hieroglyphics of Egyptian kings<br> Hold strange vitality, and, planted, grow<br> After the lapse of thrice a thousand years.<br> Some day, perchance, some unregarded note<br> Of our poor friend here--some sweet minor chord<br> That failed to lure our more accustomed ear--<br> May witch the fancy of an unborn age.<br> Who knows, since seeds have such tenacity?<br> Meanwhile he's dead, with scantiest laurel won<br> And little of our Nineteenth Century gold.<br> So, take him, Earth, and this his mortal part,<br> With that shrewd alchemy thou hast, transmute<br> To flower and leaf in thine unending Springs!
