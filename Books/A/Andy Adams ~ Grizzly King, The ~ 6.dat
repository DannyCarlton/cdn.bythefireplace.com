  Thor had gone up the gorge at daybreak. He was stiff when he rose  from the clay wallow, but a good deal of the burning and pain had gone  from his wound. It still hurt him, but not as it had hurt him the  preceding evening. His discomfort was not all in his shoulder, and it  was not in any one place in particular. He was<I> sick</I>, and had he  been human he would have been in bed with a thermometer under his  tongue and a doctor holding his pulse. He walked up the gorge slowly  and laggingly. An indefatigable seeker of food, he no longer thought of  food. He was not hungry, and he did not want to eat.
  With his hot tongue he lapped frequently at the cool water of the  creek, and even more frequently he turned half about, and sniffed the  wind. He knew that the man-smell and the strange thunder and the still  more inexplicable lightning lay behind him. All night he had been on  guard, and he was cautious now.
  For a particular hurt Thor knew of no particular remedy. He was not  a botanist in the finer sense of the word, but in creating him the  Spirit of the Wild had ordained that he should be his own physician. As  a cat seeks catnip, so Thor sought certain things when he was not  feeling well. All bitterness is not quinine, but certainly bitter  things were Thor's remedies, and as he made his way up the gorge his  nose hung close to the ground, and he sniffed in the low copses and  thick bush-tangles he passed.
  He came to a small green spot covered with kinnikinic, a ground  plant two inches high which bore red berries as big as a small pea.  They were not red now, but green; bitter as gall, and contained an  astringent tonic called uvaursi. Thor ate them.
  After that he found soap berries growing on bushes that looked very  much like currant bushes. The fruit was already larger than currants,  and turning pink. Indians ate these berries when they had fever, and  Thor gathered half a pint before he went on. They, too, were bitter.
  He nosed the trees, and found at last what he wanted. It was a  jackpine, and at several places within his reach the fresh pitch was  oozing. A bear seldom passes a bleeding jackpine. It is his chief  tonic, and Thor licked the fresh pitch with his tongue. In this way he  absorbed not only turpentine, but also, in a roundabout sort of way, a  whole pharmacopoeia of medicines made from this particular element.
  By the time he arrived at the end of the gorge Thor's stomach was a  fairly well-stocked drug emporium. Among other things he had eaten  perhaps half a quart of spruce and balsam needles. When a dog is sick  he eats grass; when a bear is sick he eats pine or balsam needles if he  can get them. Also he pads his stomach and intestines with them in the  last hour before denning himself away for the winter.
  The sun was not yet up when Thor came to the end of the gorge, and  stood for a few moments at the mouth of a low cave that reached back  into the wall of the mountain. How far his memory went back it would be  impossible to say; but in the whole world, as he knew it, this cave was  home. It was not more than four feet high, and twice as wide, but it  was many times as deep and was carpeted with a soft white floor of  sand. In some past age a little stream had trickled out of this cavern,  and the far end of it made a comfortable bedroom for a sleeping bear  when the temperature was fifty degrees below zero.
  Ten years before Thor's mother had gone in there to sleep through  the winter, and when she waddled out to get her first glimpse of spring  three little cubs waddled with her. Thor was one of them. He was still  half blind, for it is five weeks after a grizzly cub is born before he  can see; and there was not much hair on his body, for a grizzly cub is  born as naked as a human baby. His eyes open and his hair begins to  grow at just about the same time. Since then Thor had denned eight  times in that cavern home.
  He wanted to go in now. He wanted to lie down in the far end of it  and wait until he felt better. For perhaps two or three minutes he  hesitated, sniffing yearningly at the door to his cave, and then  feeling the wind from down the gorge. Something told him that he should  go on.
  To the westward there was a sloping ascent up out of the gorge to  the summit, and Thor climbed this. The sun was well up when he reached  the top, and for a little while he rested again and looked down on the  other half of his domain.
  Even more wonderful was this valley than the one into which Bruce  and Langdon had ridden a few hours before. From range to range it was a  good two miles in width, and in the opposite directions it stretched  away in a great rolling panorama of gold and green and black. From  where Thor stood it was like an immense park. Green slopes reached  almost to the summits of the mountains, and to a point halfway up these  slopes&#8212;the last timber-line&#8212;clumps of spruce and balsam trees were  scattered over the green as if set there by the hands of men. Some of  these timber-patches were no larger than the decorative clumps in a  city park, and others covered acres and tens of acres; and at the foot  of the slopes on either side, like decorative fringes, were thin and  unbroken lines of forest. Between these two lines of forest lay the  open valley of soft and undulating meadow, dotted with its purplish  bosks of buffalo willow and mountain sage, its green coppices of  wild-rose and thorn, and its clumps of trees. In the hollow of the  valley ran a stream.
  Thor descended about four hundred yards from where he stood, and  then turned northward along the green slope, so that he was travelling  from patch to patch of the parklike timber, a hundred and fifty or two  hundred yards above the fringe of forest. To this height, midway  between the meadows in the valley and the first shale and bare rock of  the peaks, he came most frequently on his small game hunts.
  Like fat woodchucks the whistlers were already beginning to sun  themselves on their rocks. Their long, soft, elusive whistlings,  pleasant to hear above the drone of mountain waters, filled the air  with a musical cadence. Now and then one would whistle shrilly and  warningly close at hand, and then flatten himself out on his rock as  the big bear passed, and for a few moments no whistling would break  upon the gentle purring of the valley.
  But Thor was giving no thought to the hunt this morning. Twice he  encountered porcupines, the sweetest of all morsels to him, and passed  them unnoticed; the warm,<I> sleeping</I> smell of a caribou came hot  and fresh from a thicket, but he did not approach the thicket to  investigate; out of a coulee, narrow and dark, like a black ditch, he  caught the scent of a badger. For two hours he travelled steadily  northward along the half-crest of the slopes before he struck down  through the timber to the stream.
  The clay adhering to his wound was beginning to harden, and again he  waded shoulder-deep into a pool, and stood there for several minutes.  The water washed most of the clay away. For another two hours he  followed the creek, drinking frequently. Then came the<I> sapoos oowin</I> &#8212;six hours after he had left the clay wallow. The kinnikinic berries,  the soap berries, the jackpine pitch, the spruce and balsam needles,  and the water he had drunk, all mixed in his stomach in one big  compelling dose, brought it about&#8212;and Thor felt tremendously better,  so much better that for the first time he turned and growled back in  the direction of his enemies. His shoulder still hurt him, but his  sickness was gone.
  For many minutes after the<I> sapoos oowin</I> he stood without  moving, and many times he growled. The snarling rumble deep in his  chest had a new meaning now. Until last night and to-day he had not  known a real hatred. He had fought other bears, but the fighting rage  was not hate. It came quickly, and passed away quickly; it left no  growing ugliness; he licked the wounds of a clawed enemy, and was quite  frequently happy while he nursed them. But this new thing that was born  in him was different.
  With an unforgetable and ferocious hatred he hated the thing that  had hurt him. He hated the man-smell; he hated the strange, white-faced  thing he had seen clinging to the side of the gorge; and his hatred  included everything associated with them. It was a hatred born of  instinct and roused sharply from its long slumber by experience.
  Without ever having seen or smelled man before, he knew that man was  his deadliest enemy, and to be feared more than all the wild things in  the mountains. He would fight the biggest grizzly. He would turn on the  fiercest pack of wolves. He would brave flood and fire without  flinching. But before man he must flee! He must hide! He must  constantly guard himself in the peaks and on the plains with eyes and  ears and nose!
  Why he sensed this, why he understood all at once that a creature  had come into his world, a pigmy in size, yet more to be dreaded than  any foe he had ever known, was a miracle which nature alone could  explain. It was a hearkening back in the age-dimmed mental fabric of  Thor's race to the earliest days of man&#8212;man, first of all, with the  club; man with the spear hardened in fire; man with the flint-tipped  arrow; man with the trap and the deadfall, and, lastly, man with the  gun. Through all the ages man had been his one and only master. Nature  had impressed it upon him&#8212;had been impressing it upon him through a  hundred or a thousand or ten thousand generations.
  And now for the first time in his life that dormant part of his  instinct leaped into warning wakefulness, and he understood. He hated  man, and hereafter he would hate everything that bore the man-smell.  And with this hate there was also born in him for the first time<I>  fear</I>. Had man never pushed Thor and his kind to the death the world  would not have known him as Ursus Horribilis the Terrible.
  Thor still followed the creek, nosing along slowly and lumberingly,  but very steadily; his head and neck bent low, his huge rear quarters  rising and falling in that rolling motion peculiar to all bears, and  especially so of the grizzly. His long claws<I> click-click-clicked</I>  on the stones; he crunched heavily in the gravel; in soft sand he left  enormous footprints.
  That part of the valley which he was now entering held a particular  significance for Thor, and he began to loiter, pausing often to sniff  the air on all sides of him. He was not a monogamist, but for many  mating seasons past he had come to find his<I> Iskwao</I> in this  wonderful sweep of meadow and plain between the two ranges. He could  always expect her in July, waiting for him or seeking him with that  strange savage longing of motherhood in her breast. She was a splendid  grizzly who came from the western ranges when the spirit of mating days  called; big, and strong, and of a beautiful golden-brown colour, so  that the children of Thor and his<I> Iskwao</I> were the finest young  grizzlies in all the mountains. The mother took them back with her  unborn, and they opened their eyes and lived and fought in the valleys  and on the slopes far to the west. If in later years Thor ever chased  his own children out of his hunting grounds, or whipped them in a  fight, Nature kindly blinded him to the fact. He was like most grouchy  old bachelors: he did not like small folk. He tolerated a little cub as  a cross-grained old woman-hater might have tolerated a pink baby; but  he wasn't as cruel as Punch, for he had never killed a cub. He had  cuffed them soundly whenever they had dared to come within reach of  him, but always with the flat, soft palm of his paw, and with just  enough force behind it to send them keeling over and over like little  round fluffy balls.
  This was Thor's only expression of displeasure when a strange  mother-bear invaded his range with her cubs. In other ways he was quite  chivalrous. He would not drive the mother-bear and her cubs away, and  he would not fight with her, no matter how shrewish or unpleasant she  was. Even if he found them eating at one of his kills, he would do  nothing more than give the cubs a sound cuffing.
  All this is somewhat necessary to show with what sudden and violent  agitation Thor caught a certain warm, close smell as he came around the  end of a mass of huge boulders. He stopped, turned his head, and swore  in his low, growling way. Six feet away from him, grovelling flat in a  patch of white sand, wriggling and shaking for all the world like a  half-frightened puppy that had not yet made up its mind whether it had  met a friend or an enemy, was a lone bear cub. It was not more than  three months old&#8212;altogether too young to be away from its mother; and  it had a sharp little tan face and a white spot on its baby breast  which marked it as a member of the black bear family, and not a  grizzly.
  The cub was trying as hard as it could to say, &#8220;I am lost, strayed,  or stolen; I'm hungry, and I've got a porcupine quill in my foot,&#8221; but  in spite of that, with another ominous growl, Thor began to look about  the rocks for the mother. She was not in sight, and neither could he  smell her, two facts which turned his great head again toward the cub.
  Muskwa&#8212;an Indian would have called the cub that&#8212;had crawled a foot  or two nearer on his little belly. He greeted Thor's second inspection  with a genial wriggling which carried him forward another half foot,  and a low warning rumbled in Thor's chest. &#8220;Don't come any nearer,&#8221; it  said plainly enough, &#8220;or I'll keel you over!&#8221;
  Muskwa understood. He lay as if dead, his nose and paws and belly  flat on the sand, and Thor looked about him again. When his eyes  returned to Muskwa, the cub was within three feet of him, squirming  flat in the sand and whimpering softly. Thor lifted his right paw four  inches from the ground. &#8220;Another inch and I'll give you a welt!&#8221; he  growled.
  Muskwa wriggled and trembled; he licked his lips with his tiny red  tongue, half in fear and half pleading for mercy, and in spite of  Thor's lifted paw he wormed his way another six inches nearer.
  There was a sort of rattle instead of a growl in Thor's throat. His  heavy hand fell to the sand. A third time he looked about and sniffed  the air; he growled again. Any crusty old bachelor would have  understood that growl. &#8220;Now where the devil is the kid's mother!&#8221; it  said.
  Something happened then. Muskwa had crept close to Thor's wounded  leg. He rose up, and his nose caught the scent of the raw wound. Gently  his tongue touched it. It was like velvet&#8212;that tongue. It was  wonderfully pleasant to feel, and Thor stood there for many moments,  making neither movement nor sound while the cub licked his wound. Then  he lowered his great head. He sniffed the soft little ball of  friendship that had come to him. Muskwa whined in a motherless way.  Thor growled, but more softly now. It was no longer a threat. The heat  of his great tongue fell once on the cub's face.
  &#8220;Come on!&#8221; he said, and resumed his journey into the north.
  And close at his heels followed the motherless little tan-faced cub.
