  From the moment that the adventurers turned their backs upon the  Woonga country Mukoki was in command. With the storm in their favor  everything else now depended upon the craft of the old pathfinder.  There was neither moon nor wind to guide them, and even Wabi felt that  he was not competent to strike a straight trail in a strange country  and a night storm. But Mukoki, still a savage in the ways of the  wilderness, seemed possessed of that mysterious sixth sense which is  known as the sense of orientation&#8212;that almost supernatural instinct  which guides the carrier pigeon as straight as a die to its home-cote  hundreds of miles away. Again and again during that thrilling night's  flight Wabi or Rod would ask the Indian where Wabinosh House lay, and  he would point out its direction to them without hesitation. And each  time it seemed to the city youth that he pointed a different way, and  it proved to him how easy it was to become hopelessly lost in the  wilderness.
  Not until midnight did they pause to rest. They had traveled slowly  but steadily and Wabi figured that they had covered fifteen miles. Five  miles behind them their trail was completely obliterated by the falling  snow. Morning would betray to the Woongas no sign of the direction  taken by the fugitives.
  &#8220;They will believe that we have struck directly westward for the  Post,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;To-morrow night we'll be fifty miles apart.&#8221;
  During this stop a small fire was built behind a fallen log and the  hunters refreshed themselves with a pot of strong coffee and what  little remained of the rabbit and biscuits. The march was then resumed.
  It seemed to Rod that they had climbed an interminable number of  ridges and had picked their way through an interminable number of  swampy bottoms between them, and he, even more than Mukoki, was  relieved when they struck the easier traveling of open plains. In fact,  Mukoki seemed scarcely to give a thought to his wound and Roderick was  almost ready to drop in his tracks by the time a halt was called an  hour before dawn. The old warrior was confident that they were now well  out of danger and a rousing camp-fire was built in the shelter of a  thick growth of spruce.
  &#8220;Spruce partridge in mornin',&#8221; affirmed Mukoki. &#8220;Plenty here for  breakfast.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Rod, whose hunger was ravenous.
  &#8220;Fine thick spruce, all in shelter of dip,&#8221; explained the Indian.  &#8220;Birds winter here.&#8221;
  Wabi had unpacked the furs, and the larger of these, including six  lynx and three especially fine wolf skins, he divided into three piles.
  &#8220;They'll make mighty comfortable beds if you keep close enough to  the fire,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Get a few spruce boughs, Rod, and cover them  over with one of the wolf skins. The two lynx pelts will make the  warmest blankets you ever had.&#8221;
  Rod quickly availed himself of this idea, and within half an hour he  was sleeping soundly. Mukoki and Wabigoon, more inured to the hardships  of the wilderness, took only brief snatches of slumber, one or both  awakening now and then to replenish the fire. As soon as it was light  enough the two Indians went quietly out into the spruce with their  guns, and their shots a little later awakened Rod. When they returned  they brought three partridges with them.
  &#8220;There are dozens of them among the spruce,&#8221; said Wabi, &#8220;but just  now we do not want to shoot any oftener than is absolutely necessary.  Have you noticed our last night's trail?&#8221;
  Rod rubbed his eyes, thus confessing that as yet he had not been out  from between his furs.
  &#8220;Well, if you go out there in the open for a hundred yards you won't  find it,&#8221; finished his comrade. &#8220;The snow has covered it completely.&#8221;
  Although they lacked everything but meat, this breakfast in the  spruce thicket was one of the happiest of the entire trip, and when the  three hunters were done each had eaten of his partridge until only the  bones were left. There was now little cause for fear, for it was still  snowing and their enemies were twenty-five miles to the north of them.  This fact did not deter the adventurers from securing an early start,  however, and they traveled southward through the storm until noon, when  they built a camp of spruce and made preparations to rest until the  following day.
  &#8220;We must be somewhere near the Kenogami trail,&#8221; Wabi remarked to  Mukoki. &#8220;We may have passed it.&#8221;
  &#8220;No pass it,&#8221; replied Mukoki. &#8220;She off there.&#8221; He pointed to the  south.
  &#8220;You see the Kenogami trail is a sled trail leading from the little  town of Nipigon, on the railroad, to Kenogami House, which is a Hudson  Bay Post at the upper end of Long Lake,&#8221; explained Wabi to his white  companion. &#8220;The factor of Kenogami is a great friend of ours and we  have visited back and forth often, but I've been over the Kenogami  trail only once. Mukoki has traveled it many times.&#8221;
  Several rabbits were killed before dinner. No other hunting was done  during the afternoon, most of which was passed in sleep by the  exhausted adventurers. When Rod awoke he found that it had stopped  snowing and was nearly dark.
  Mukoki's wound was beginning to trouble him again, and it was  decided that at least a part of the next day should be passed in camp,  and that both Rod and Wabigoon should make an effort to kill some  animal that would furnish them with the proper kind of oil to dress it  with, the fat of almost any species of animal except mink or rabbit  being valuable for this purpose. With dawn the two started out, while  Mukoki, much against his will, was induced to remain in camp. A short  distance away the hunters separated, Rod striking to the eastward and  Wabi into the south.
  For an hour Roderick continued without seeing game, though there  were plenty of signs of deer and caribou about him. At last he  determined to strike for a ridge a mile to the south, from the top of  which he was more likely to get a shot than in the thick growth of the  plains. He had not traversed more than a half of the distance when much  to his surprise he came upon a well-beaten trail running slightly  diagonally with his own, almost due north. Two dog-teams had passed  since yesterday's storm, and on either side of the sleds were the  snow-shoe trails of men. Rod saw that there were three of these, and at  least a dozen dogs in the two teams. It at once occurred to him that  this was the Kenogami trail, and impelled by nothing more than  curiosity he began to follow it.
  Half a mile farther on he found where the party had stopped to cook  a meal. The remains of their camp-fire lay beside a huge log, which was  partly burned away, and about it were scattered bones and bits of  bread. But what most attracted Rod's attention were other tracks which  joined those of the three people on snow-shoes. He was sure that these  tracks had been made by women, for the footprints made by one of them  were unusually small. Close to the log he found a single impression in  the snow that caused his heart to give a sudden unexpected thump within  him. In this spot the snow had been packed by one of the snow-shoes,  and in this comparatively hard surface the footprint was clearly  defined. It had been made by a moccasin. Rod knew that. And the  moccasin wore a slight heel! He remembered, now, that thrilling day in  the forest near Wabinosh House when he had stopped to look at  Minnetaki's footprints in the soft earth through which she had been  driven by her Woonga abductors, and he remembered, too, that she was  the only person at the Post who wore heels on her moccasins. It was a  queer coincidence! Could Minnetaki have been here? Had she made that  footprint in the snow? Impossible, declared the young hunter's better  sense. And yet his blood ran a little faster as he touched the delicate  impression with his bare fingers. It reminded him of Minnetaki, anyway;  her foot would have made just such a trail, and he wondered if the girl  who had stepped there was as pretty as she.
  He followed now a little faster than before, and ten minutes later  he came to where a dozen snow-shoe trails had come in from the north  and had joined the three. After meeting, the two parties had evidently  joined forces and had departed over the trail made by those who had  appeared from the direction of the Post.
  &#8220;Friends from Kenogami House came down to meet them,&#8221; mused Rod, and  as he turned back in the direction of the camp he formed a picture of  that meeting in the heart of the wilderness, of the glad embraces of  husband and wife, and the joy of the pretty girl with the tiny feet as  she kissed her father, and perhaps her big brother; for no girl could  possess feet just like Minnetaki's and not be pretty!
  He found that Wabi had preceded him when he returned. The young  Indian had shot a small doe, and that noon witnessed a feast in camp.  For his lack of luck Rod had his story to tell of the people on the  trail. The passing of this party formed the chief topic of conversation  during the rest of the day, for after weeks of isolation in the  wilderness even this momentary nearness of living civilized men and  women was a great event to them. But there was one fact which Rod dwelt  but slightly upon. He did not emphasize the similarity of the pretty  footprint and that made by Minnetaki's moccasin, for he knew that a  betrayal of his knowledge and admiration of the Indian maiden's feet  would furnish Wabi with fun-making ammunition for a week. He did say,  however, that the footprint in the snow struck him as being just about  the size that Minnetaki would make.
  All that day and night the hunters remained in camp, sleeping,  eating and taking care of Mukoki's wound, but the next morning saw them  ready for their homeward journey with the coming of dawn. They struck  due westward now, satisfied that they were well beyond the range of the  outlaw Woongas.
  As the boys talked over their adventure on the long journey back  toward the Post, Wabi thought with regret of the moose head which he  had left buried in the &#8220;Indian ice-box,&#8221; and even wished, for a moment,  to go home by the northern trail, despite the danger from the hostile  Woongas, in order to recover the valuable antlers. But Mukoki shook his  head.
  &#8220;Woonga make good fight. What for go again into wolf trap?&#8221;
  And so they reluctantly gave up the notion of carrying the big head  of the bull moose back to the Post.
  A little before noon of the second day they saw Lake Nipigon from  the top of a hill. Columbus when he first stepped upon the shore of his  newly discovered land was not a whit happier than Roderick Drew when  that joyous youth, running out upon the snow-covered ice, attempted to  turn a somersault with his snow-shoes on!
  Just over there, thought Rod&#8212;just over there&#8212;a hundred miles or  so, is Minnetaki and the Post! Happy visions filled his mind all that  afternoon as they traveled across the foot of the lake. Three weeks  more and he would see his mother&#8212;and home. And Wabi was going with  him! He seemed tireless; his spirits were never exhausted; he laughed,  whistled, even attempted to sing. He wondered if Minnetaki would be  very glad to see him. He knew that she would be glad&#8212;but how glad?
  Two days more were spent in circling the lower end of the lake. Then  their trail turned northward, and on the second evening after this, as  the cold red sun was sinking in all that heatless glory of the great  North's day-end, they came out upon a forest-clad ridge and looked down  upon the House of Wabinosh.
  And as they looked&#8212;and as the burning disk of the sun, falling down  and down behind forest, mountain and plain, bade its last adieu to the  land of the wild, there came to them, strangely clear and beautiful,  the notes of a bugle.
  And Wabi, listening, grew rigid with wonder. As the last notes died  away the cheers that had been close to his lips gave way to the  question, &#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;A bugle!&#8221; said Rod.
  As he spoke there came to their ears the heavy, reverberating boom  of a big gun.
  &#8220;If I'm not mistaken,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that is a sunset salute. I didn't  know you had&#8212;soldiers&#8212;at the Post!&#8221;
  &#8220;We haven't,&#8221; replied the Indian youth. &#8220;By George, what do you  suppose it means?&#8221;
  He hurried down the ridge, the others close behind him. Fifteen  minutes later they trailed out into the open near the Post. A strange  change had occurred since Rod and his companions had last seen Wabinosh  House. In the open half a dozen rude log shelters had been erected, and  about these were scores of soldiers in the uniform of his Majesty, the  King of England. Shouts of greeting died on the hunters' lips. They  hastened to the dwelling of the factor, and while Wabi rushed in to  meet his mother and father Rod cut across to the Company's store. He  had often found Minnetaki there. But his present hope was shattered,  and after looking in he turned back to the house. By the time he had  reached the steps a second time the princess mother, with Wabi close  behind her, came out to welcome him.
  Wabi's face was flushed with excitement. His eyes sparkled.
  &#8220;Rod, what do you think!&#8221; he exclaimed, after his mother had gone  back to see to the preparation of their supper. &#8220;The government has  declared war on the Woongas and has sent up a company of regulars to  wipe 'em out! They have been murdering and robbing as never before  during the last two months. The regulars start after them to-morrow!&#8221;
  He was breathing hard and excitedly.
  &#8220;Can't you stay&#8212;and join in the campaign?&#8221; he pleaded.
  &#8220;I can't,&#8221; replied Rod. &#8220;I can't, Wabi; I've got to go home. You  know that. And you're going with me. The regulars can get along without  you. Go back to Detroit with me&#8212;and get your mother to let Minnetaki  go with us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not now, Rod,&#8221; said the Indian youth, taking his friend's hand. &#8220;I  won't be able to go&#8212;now. Nor Minnetaki either. They have been having  such desperate times here that father has sent her away. He wanted  mother to go, but she wouldn't.&#8221;
  &#8220;Sent Minnetaki away?&#8221; gasped Rod.
  &#8220;Yes. She started for Kenogami House four days ago in company with  an Indian woman and three guides. That was undoubtedly their trail you  found.&#8221;
  &#8220;And the footprint&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Was hers,&#8221; laughed Wabi, putting an arm affectionately around his  chum's shoulders. &#8220;Won't you stay, Rod?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is impossible.&#8221;
  He went to his old room, and until suppertime sat alone in silent  dejection. Two great disappointments had fallen upon him. Wabi could  not go home with him&#8212;and he had missed Minnetaki. The young girl had  left a note in her mother's care for him, and he read it again and  again. She had written it believing that she would return to Wabinosh  House before the hunters, but at the end she had added a paragraph in  which she said that if she did not do this Rod must make the Post a  second visit very soon, and bring his mother with him.
  At supper the princess mother several times pressed Minnetaki's  invitation upon the young hunter. She read to him parts of certain  letters which she had received from Mrs. Drew during the winter, and  Rod was overjoyed to find that his mother was not only in good health,  but that she had given her promise to visit Wabinosh House the  following summer. Wabi broke all table etiquette by giving vent to a  warlike whoop of joy at this announcement, and once more Rod's spirits  rose high above his temporary disappointments.
  That night the furs were appraised and purchased by the factor for  his Company, and Rod's share, including his third of the gold, was  nearly seven hundred dollars. The next morning the bi-monthly sled  party, was leaving for civilization, and he prepared to go with it,  after writing a long letter to Minnetaki, which was to be carried to  her by the faithful Mukoki. Most of that night Wabi and his friend sat  up and talked, and made plans. It was believed that the campaign  against the Woongas would be a short and decisive one. By spring all  trouble would be over.
  &#8220;And you'll come back as soon as you can?&#8221; pleaded Wabi for the  hundredth time. &#8220;You'll come back by the time the ice breaks up?&#8221;
  &#8220;If I am alive!&#8221; pledged the city youth.
  &#8220;And you'll bring your mother?&#8221;
  &#8220;She has promised.&#8221;
  &#8220;And then&#8212;for the gold!&#8221;
  &#8220;For the gold!&#8221;
  Wabi held out his hand and the two gripped heartily.
  &#8220;And Minnetaki will be here then&#8212;I swear it!&#8221; said the Indian  youth, laughing.
  Rod blushed.
  And that night alone he slipped quietly out into the still, white  night; and he looked, longingly, far into the southeast where he had  found the footprint in the snow; and he turned to the north, and the  east, and the west, and lastly to the south, and his eyes seemed to  travel through the distance of a thousand miles to where a home and a  mother lay sleeping in a great city. And as he turned back to the House  of Wabinosh, where all the lights were out, he spoke softly to himself:
  &#8220;It's home&#8212;to-morrow!&#8221;
  And then he added:
  &#8220;But you bet I'll be back by the time the ice breaks up!&#8221;
  THE END
