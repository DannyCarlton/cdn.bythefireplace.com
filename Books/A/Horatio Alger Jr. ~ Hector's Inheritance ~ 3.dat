    Hector entered the library with some impetuosity. Usually he was   quiet and orderly, but he had been excited by the insinuations of   Guy, and he was impatient to know what he meant&#8212;if he meant   anything. 
  Allan Roscoe looked up, and remarked, with slight sarcasm: 
  &quot;This is not a bear garden, Hector. You appear to think you are on   the playground, judging by your hasty motions.&quot; 
  &quot;I beg your pardon, uncle,&quot; said Hector, who never took amiss a   rebuke which he thought deserved. &quot;I suppose I forgot myself, being   excited. I beg your pardon.&quot; 
  &quot;What is the cause of your excitement?&quot; asked Mr. Roscoe, surveying   the boy keenly. 
  &quot;Guy has said something that I don't understand.&quot; 
  &quot;He must have said something very profound, then,&quot; returned Allan   Roscoe, with light raillery. 
  &quot;Indeed, Uncle Allan, it is no laughing matter,&quot; said Hector,   earnestly. 
  &quot;Then let me hear what it is.&quot; 
  &quot;He intimates that he knows something that would let down my pride  a  peg or two. He hints that I am not the heir of Castle Roscoe.&quot; 
  The boy used the term by which the house was usually known. 
  Allan Roscoe knit his brow in pretended vexation. 
  &quot;Inconsiderate boy!&quot; he murmured. &quot;Why need he say this?&quot; 
  &quot;But,&quot; said Hector, startled, &quot;is it true?&quot; 
  &quot;My boy,&quot; said his uncle, with simulated feeling, &quot;my son has  spoken  to you of a secret which I would willingly keep from you if I  could.  Yet, perhaps, it is as well that you should be told now.&quot; 
  &quot;Told what?&quot; exclaimed Hector, quite at sea. 
  &quot;Can you bear to hear, Hector, that it is indeed true? You are not   the owner of this estate.&quot; 
  &quot;Who is then?&quot; ejaculated the astonished boy. 
  &quot;I am; and Guy after me.&quot; 
  &quot;What! Did my father leave the estate away from me? I thought he  did  not leave a will?&quot; 
  &quot;Nor did he.&quot; 
  &quot;Then how can anyone else except his son inherit?&quot; 
  &quot;Your question is a natural one. If you were his son you would   inherit under the law.&quot; 
  &quot;If I were his son!&quot; repeated Hector, slowly, his head swimming.   &quot;What do you mean by that? Of course I am your brother's son.&quot; 
  &quot;It is very painful for me to tell, Hector. It will be distressing   for you to hear. No tie of blood connects you with the late owner of   Castle Roscoe.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe you, Uncle Allan,&quot; said Hector, bluntly. 
  &quot;Of course, therefore, I am not your uncle,&quot; added Allan Roscoe,   dryly. 
  &quot;I beg your pardon; I should have said Mr. Allan Roscoe,&quot; said   Hector, bowing proudly, for his heart was sore, and he was deeply   indignant with the man who sat, smooth and sleek, in his father's   chair, harrowing up his feelings without himself being ruffled. 
  &quot;That is immaterial. Call me uncle, if you like, since the truth is   understood. But I must explain.&quot; 
  &quot;I would like to know what is your authority for so surprising a   statement, Mr. Roscoe. You cannot expect me to believe that I have   been deceived all my life.&quot; 
  &quot;I make the statement on your father's authority&#8212;I should say, on   my brother's authority.&quot; 
  &quot;Can you prove it, Mr. Roscoe?&quot; 
  &quot;I can. I will presently put into your hands a letter, written me  by  my brother some months since, which explains the whole matter. To   save you suspense, however, I will recapitulate. Where were you   born?&quot; 
  &quot;In California.&quot; 
  &quot;That is probably true. It was there that my brother found you.&quot; 
  &quot;Found me?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps that is not the word. My brother and his wife were  boarding  in Sacramento in the winter of 1859. In the same boarding  house was  a widow, with a child of some months old. You were that  child. Your  mother died suddenly, and it was ascertained that she left  nothing.  Her child was, therefore, left destitute. It was a fine,  promising  boy&#8212;give me credit for the compliment&#8212;and my brother,  having no  children of his own, proposed to his wife to adopt it. She  was fond  of children, and readily consented. No formalities were  necessary,  for there was no one to claim you. You were at once taken  in charge  by my brother and his wife, therefore, and very soon they  came to  look upon you with as much affection as if you were their own  child.  They wished you to consider them your real parents, and to you  the  secret was never made known, nor was it known to the world. When  my  brother returned to this State, three years after, not one of his   friends doubted that the little Hector was his own boy. 
  &quot;When you were six years old your mother died&#8212;that is, my  brother's  wife. All the more, perhaps, because he was left alone, my  brother  became attached to you, and, I think, he came to love you as  much as  if you were his own son.&quot; 
  &quot;I think he did,&quot; said Hector, with emotion. &quot;Never was there a   kinder, more indulgent father.&quot; 
  &quot;Yet he was not your father,&quot; said Allan Roscoe, with sharp   emphasis. 
  &quot;So you say, Mr. Roscoe.&quot; 
  &quot;So my brother says in his letter to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think it probable that, with all this affection for me, he   would have left me penniless?&quot; asked the boy. 
  &quot;No; it was his intention to make a will. By that will he would no   doubt have provided for you in a satisfactory manner. But I think my   poor brother had a superstitious fear of will making, lest it might   hasten death. At any rate, he omitted it till it was too late.&quot; 
  &quot;It was a cruel omission, if your story is a true one.&quot; 
  &quot;Your&#8212;my brother, did what he could to remedy matters. In his last   sickness, when too weak to sign his name, he asked me, as the legal   heir of his estate, to see that you were well provided for. He  wished  me to see your education finished, and I promised to do so. I  could  see that this promise relieved his mind. Of one thing you may  be  assured, Hector, he never lost his affection for you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank Heaven for that!&quot; murmured the boy, who had been deeply and   devotedly attached to the man whom, all his life long, he had looked   upon as his father. 
  &quot;I can only add, Hector,&quot; said Mr. Roscoe, &quot;that I feel for your   natural disappointment. It is, indeed, hard to be brought up to   regard yourself as the heir of a great estate, and to make the   discovery that you have been mistaken.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't mind that so much, Mr. Roscoe,&quot; said Hector, slowly. &quot;It  is  the hardest thing to think of myself as having no claim upon one   whom I have loved as a father&#8212;to think myself as a boy of unknown   parentage. But,&quot; he added, suddenly, &quot;I have it only on your word.   Why should I believe it?&quot; 
  &quot;I will give you conclusive proof, Hector. Read this.&quot; 
  Allan Roscoe took from his pocket a letter, without an envelope.  One  glance served to show Hector that it was in the handwriting of his   late father, or, at any rate, in a handwriting surprisingly like it. 
  He began to read it with feverish haste. 
  The letter need not find a place here. The substance of it had been   accurately given by Mr. Allan Roscoe. Apparently, it corroborated  his  every statement. 
  The boy looked up from its perusal, his face pale and stricken. 
  &quot;You see that I have good authority for my statement,&quot; said Mr.   Roscoe. 
  &quot;I can't understand it,&quot; said Hector, slowly. 
  &quot;I need only add,&quot; said Mr. Roscoe, apparently relieved by the   revelation, &quot;that my brother did not repose confidence in me in  vain.  I accept, as a sacred charge, the duty he imposed upon me. I  shall  provide for you and look after your education. I wish to put  you in a  way to prepare yourself for a useful and honorable career.  As a first  step, I intend, on Monday next, to place you in an  excellent boarding  school, where you will have exceptional  privileges.&quot; 
  Hector listened, but his mind was occupied by sad thoughts, and he   made no comment. 
  &quot;I have even selected the school with great care,&quot; said Mr. Roscoe.   &quot;It is situated at Smithville, and is under the charge of Socrates   Smith, A. M., a learned and distinguished educator. You may go now.  I  will speak with you on this subject later.&quot; 
  Hector bowed. After what he had heard, his interest in other  matters  was but faint. 
  &quot;I shall be glad to get him out of the house,&quot; thought Allan  Roscoe.  &quot;I never liked him.&quot;
