  They passed down an aisle through the tall trees, on each side of  which faced the vari-coloured and many-shaped architecture of the  little town. It was chiefly of canvas. Now and then a structure of logs  added an appearance of solidity to the whole. The girl did not look too  closely. She knew that they passed places in which there were long rows  of cots, and that others were devoted to trade. She noticed signs which  advertised soft drinks and cigars&#8212;always &#8220;soft drinks,&#8221; which  sometimes came into camp marked as &#8220;dynamite,&#8221; &#8220;salt pork,&#8221; and  &#8220;flour.&#8221; She was conscious that every one stared at them as they  passed. She heard clearly the expressions of wonder and curiosity of  two women and a girl who were spreading out blankets in front of a  rooming-tent. She looked at the man at her side. She appreciated his  courtesy in not attempting to force an acquaintanceship. In her eyes  was a ripple of amusement.
  &#8220;This is all strange and new to me&#8212;and not at all uninteresting,&#8221;  she said. &#8220;I came expecting&#8212;everything. And I am finding it. Why do  they stare at me so? Am I a curiosity?&#8221;
  &#8220;You are,&#8221; he answered bluntly. &#8220;You are the most beautiful woman  they have ever seen.&#8221;
  His eyes encountered hers as he spoke. He had answered her question  fairly. There was nothing that was audacious in his manner or his look.  She had asked for information, and he had given it. In spite of herself  the girl's lips trembled. Her colour deepened. She smiled.
  &#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; she entreated. &#8220;I seldom feel like laughing, but I  almost do now. I have encountered so many curious people and have heard  so many curious things during the past twenty-four hours. You don't  believe in concealing your thoughts out here in the wilderness, do  you?&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't expressed<I> my</I> thoughts,&#8221; he corrected. &#8220;I was  telling you what<I> they</I> think.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh-h-h&#8212;I beg your pardon again!&#8221;
  &#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he answered lightly, and now his eyes were laughing  frankly into her own. &#8220;I don't mind informing you,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that I  am the biggest curiosity you will meet between this side of the  mountains and the sea. I am not accustomed to championing women. I  allow them to pursue their own course without personal interference on  my part. But&#8212;I suppose it will give you some satisfaction if I confess  it&#8212;I followed you into Bill's place because you were more than  ordinarily beautiful, and because I wanted to see fair play. I knew you  were making a mistake. I knew what would happen.&#8221;
  They had passed the end of the street, and entered a little green  plain that was soft as velvet underfoot. On the farther side of this,  sheltered among the trees, were two or three tents. The man led the way  toward these.
  &#8220;Now, I suppose I've spoiled it all,&#8221; he went on, a touch of irony  in his voice. &#8220;It was really quite heroic of me to follow you into  Bill's place, don't you think? You probably want to tell me so, but  don't quite dare. And I should play up to my part, shouldn't I? But I  cannot&#8212;not satisfactorily. I'm really a bit disgusted with myself for  having taken as much interest in you as I have. I write books for a  living. My name is John Aldous.&#8221;
  With a little cry of amazement, his companion stopped. Without  knowing it, her hand had gripped his arm.
  &#8220;You are John Aldous&#8212;who wrote 'Fair Play,' and 'Women!'&#8220; she  gasped.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, amusement in his face.
  &#8220;I have read those books&#8212;and I have read your plays,&#8221; she breathed,  a mysterious tremble in her voice. &#8220;You despise women!&#8221;
  &#8220;Devoutly.&#8221;
  She drew a deep breath. Her hand dropped from his arm.
  &#8220;This is very, very funny,&#8221; she mused, gazing off to the sun-capped  peaks of the mountains. &#8220;You have flayed women alive. You have made  them want to mob you. And yet&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Millions of them read my books,&#8221; he chuckled.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;all of them read your books,&#8221; she replied, looking straight  into his face. &#8220;And I guess&#8212;in many ways&#8212;you have pointed out things  that are true.&#8221;
  It was his turn to show surprise.
  &#8220;You believe that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I do. More than that&#8212;I have always thought that I knew your  secret&#8212;the big, hidden thing under your work, the thing which you do  not reveal because you know the world would laugh at you. And so&#8212;<I> you despise me!</I>&#8220;
  &#8220;Not you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am a woman.&#8221;
  He laughed. The tan in his cheeks burned a deeper red.
  &#8220;We are wasting time,&#8221; he warned her. &#8220;In Bill's place I heard you  say you were going to leave on the Tete Jaune train. I am going to take  you to a real dinner. And now&#8212;I should let those good people know your  name.&#8221;
  A moment&#8212;unflinching and steady&#8212;she looked into his face.
  &#8220;It is Joanne, the name you have made famous as the dreadfulest  woman in fiction. Joanne Gray.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said, and bowed low. &#8220;Come. If I am not mistaken I  smell new-baked bread.&#8221;
  As they moved on he suddenly touched her arm. She felt for a moment  the firm clasp of his fingers. There was a new light in his eyes, a  glow of enthusiasm.
  &#8220;I have it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You have brought it to me&#8212;the idea. I have  been wanting a name for<I> her</I>&#8212;the woman in my new book. She is to  be a tremendous surprise. I haven't found a name, until now&#8212;one that  fits. I shall call her Ladygray!&#8221;
  He felt the girl flinch. He was surprised at the sudden startled  look that shot into her eyes, the swift ebbing of the colour from her  cheeks. He drew away his hand at the strange change in her. He noticed  how quickly she was breathing&#8212;that the fingers of her white hands were  clasped tensely.
  &#8220;You object,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Not enough to keep you from using it,&#8221; she replied in a low voice.  &#8220;I owe you a great deal.&#8221; He noted, too, how quickly she had recovered  herself. Her head was a little higher. She looked toward the tents.  &#8220;You were not mistaken,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I smell new-made bread!&#8221;
  &#8220;And I shall emphasize the first half of it&#8212;<I>Lady_gray,&#8221; said  John Aldous, as if speaking to himself. &#8220;That diminutizes it, you might  say&#8212;gives it the touch of sentiment I want. You can imagine a lover  saying 'Dear little<I> Lady_gray, are you warm and comfy?' He wouldn't  say Ladygray as if she wore a coronet, would he?&#8221;</I></I>
  &#8220;Smell-o'-bread&#8212;fresh bread!&#8221; sniffed Joanne Gray, as if she had  not heard him. &#8220;It's making me hungry. Will you please hurry me to it,  John Aldous?&#8221;
  They were approaching the first of the three tent-houses, over which  was a crudely painted sign which read &#8220;Otto Brothers, Guides and  Outfitters.&#8221; It was a large, square tent, with weather-faded red and  blue stripes, and from it came the cheerful sound of a woman's  laughter. Half a dozen trampish-looking Airedale terriers roused  themselves languidly as they drew nearer. One of them stood up and  snarled.
  &#8220;They won't hurt you,&#8221; assured Aldous. &#8220;They belong to Jack Bruce  and Clossen Otto&#8212;the finest bunch of grizzly dogs in the Rockies.&#8221;  Another moment, and a woman had appeared in the door. &#8220;And that is Mrs.  Jack Otto,&#8221; he added under his breath. &#8220;If all women were like her I  wouldn't have written the things you have read!&#8221;
  He might have added that she was Scotch. But this was not necessary.  The laughter was still in her good-humoured face. Aldous looked at his  companion, and he found her smiling back. The eyes of the two women had  already met.
  Briefly Aldous explained what had happened at Quade's, and that the  young woman was leaving on the Tete Jaune train. The good-humoured  smile left Mrs. Otto's face when he mentioned Quade.
  &#8220;I've told Jack I'd like to poison that man some day,&#8221; she cried.  &#8220;You poor dear, come in, I'll get you a cup of tea.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which always means dinner in the Otto camp,&#8221; added Aldous.
  &#8220;I'm not so hungry, but I'm tired&#8212;so tired,&#8221; he heard the girl say  as she went in with Mrs. Otto, and there was a new and strangely  pathetic note in her voice. &#8220;I want to rest&#8212;until the train goes.&#8221;
  He followed them in, and stood for a moment near the door.
  &#8220;There's a room in there, my dear,&#8221; said the woman, drawing back a  curtain. &#8220;Make yourself at home, and lie down on the bed until I have  the tea ready.&#8221;
  When the curtain had closed behind her, John Aldous spoke in a low  voice to the woman.
  &#8220;Will you see her safely to the train, Mrs. Otto?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It  leaves at a quarter after two. I must be going.&#8221;
  He felt that he had sufficiently performed his duty. He left the  tent, and paused for a moment outside to touzle affectionately the  trampish heads of the bear dogs. Then he turned away, whistling. He had  gone a dozen steps when a low voice stopped him. He turned. Joanne had  come from the door.
  For one moment he stared as if something more wonderful than  anything he had ever seen had risen before him. The girl was  bareheaded, and she stood in a sun mellowed by a film of cloud. Her  head was piled with lustrous coils of gold-brown hair that her hat and  veil had hidden. Never had he looked upon such wonderful hair, crushed  and crumpled back from her smooth forehead; nor such marvellous  whiteness of skin and pure blue depths of eyes! In her he saw now  everything that was strong and splendid in woman. She was not girlishly  sweet. She was not a girl. She was a woman&#8212;glorious to look at, a soul  glowing out of her eyes, a strength that thrilled him in the quiet and  beautiful mystery of her face.
  &#8220;You were going without saying good-bye,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Won't you let  me thank you&#8212;a last time?&#8221;
  Her voice brought him to himself again. A moment he bent over her  hand. A moment he felt its warm, firm pressure in his own. The smile  that flashed to his lips was hidden from her as he bowed his blond-gray  head.
  &#8220;Pardon me for the omission,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;Good-bye&#8212;and may good  luck go with you!&#8221;
  Their eyes met once more. With another bow he had turned, and was  continuing his way. At the door Joanne Gray looked back. He was  whistling again. His careless, easy stride was filled with a freedom  that seemed to come to her in the breath of the mountains. And then  she, too, smiled strangely as she reentered the tent.
