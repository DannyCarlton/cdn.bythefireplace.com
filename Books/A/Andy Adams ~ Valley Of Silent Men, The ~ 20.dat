  It was that hour when, with clear skies, the gray northern dawn   would have been breaking faintly over the eastern forests. Kent  found  the darkness more fog-like; about him was a grayer,  ghostlier sort of  gloom. But he could not see the water under his  feet. Nor could he see  the rail of the scow, or the river. From  the stern, ten feet from the  cabin door, the cabin itself was  swallowed up and invisible. 
  With the steady, swinging motion of the riverman he began bailing.   So regular became his movements that they ran in a sort of  rhythmic  accompaniment to his thoughts. The monotonous splash,  splash, splash  of the outflung pails of water assumed, after a few  minutes, the  character of a mechanical thing. He could smell the  nearness of the  shore. Even in the rain the tang of cedar and  balsam came to him  faintly. 
  But it was the river that impressed itself most upon his senses.   It seemed to him, as the minutes passed, like a living thing. He   could hear it gurgling and playing under the end of the scow. And   with that sound there was another and more indescribable thing,  the  tremble of it, the pulse of it, the thrill of it in the  impenetrable  gloom, the life of it as it swept on in a slow and  mighty flood  between its wilderness walls. Kent had always said,  &quot;You can hear the  river's heart beat&#8212;if you know how to listen  for it.&quot; And he heard it  now. He felt it. The rain could not beat  it out, nor could the splash  of the water he was throwing  overboard drown it, and the darkness  could not hide it from the  vision that was burning like a living coal  within him. Always it  was the river that had given him consolation in  times of  loneliness. For him it had grown into a thing with a soul, a  thing  that personified hope, courage, comradeship, everything that was   big and great in final achievement. And tonight&#8212;for he still  thought  of the darkness as night&#8212;the soul of it seemed whispering  to him a  sort of paean. 
  He could not lose. That was the thought that filled him. Never had   his pulse beat with greater assurance, never had a more positive   sense of the inevitable possessed him. It was inconceivable, he   thought, even to fear the possibility of being taken by the  Police.  He was more than a man fighting for his freedom alone,  more than an  individual struggling for the right to exist. A thing  vastly more  priceless than either freedom or life, if they were to  be accepted  alone, waited for him in the little cabin, shut in by  its sea of  darkness. And ahead of them lay their world. He  emphasized that. THEIR  world&#8212;the world which, in an illusive and  unreal sort of way, had  been a part of his dreams all his life. In  that world they would shut  themselves in. No one would ever find  them. And the glory of the sun  and the stars and God's open  country would be with them always. 
  Marette was the very heart of that reality which impinged itself   upon him now. He did not worry about what it was she would tell  him  tomorrow, or day after tomorrow. He believed that it was then  &#8212;when  she had told him what there was to tell, and he still  reached, out his  arms to her&#8212;that she would come into those arms.  And he knew that  nothing that might have happened in Kedsty's room  would keep his arms  from reaching, to her. Such was his faith,  potent as the mighty flood  hidden in the gray-ghost gloom of  approaching dawn. 
  Yet he did not expect to win easily. As he worked, his mind swept   up and down the Three Rivers from the Landing to Fort Simpson, and   mentally he pictured the situations that might arise, and how he   would triumph over them. He figured that the men at Barracks would   not enter Kedsty's bungalow until noon at the earliest. The Police   gasoline launch would probably set out on a river search soon  after.  By mid-afternoon the scow would have a fifty-mile start. 
  Before darkness came again they would be through the Death Chute,   where Follette and Ladouceur swam their mad race for the love of a   girl. And not many miles below the Chute was a swampy country  where  he could hide the scow. Then they would start overland, west  and  north. Given until another sunset, and they would be safe.  This was  what he expected. But if it came to fighting&#8212;he would  fight. 
  The rain had slackened to a thin drizzle by the time he finished   his bailing. The aroma of cedar and balsam came to him more  clearly,  and he heard more distinctly the murmuring surge of the  river. He  tapped again at the door of the cabin, and Marette  answered him. 
  The fire had burned down to a bed of glowing coals when he   entered. Again he fell on his knees, and took off his dripping   slicker. 
  The girl greeted him from the berth. &quot;You look like a great bear,   Jeems.&quot; There was a glad, welcoming note in her voice. 
  He laughed, and drew the stool beside her, and managed to sit on   it, the roof compelling him to bend his head over a little. &quot;I  feel  like an elephant in a birdcage,&quot; he replied. &quot;Are you  comfortable,  little Gray Goose?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. But you, Jeems? You are wet!&quot; 
  &quot;But so happy that I don't feel it, Gray Goose.&quot; 
  He could make her out only dimly there in the darkness of the   berth. Her face was a pale shadow, and she had loosened her damp  hair  so that the warmth and dry air might reach it more easily.  Kent  wondered if she could hear the beating of his heart. He  forgot the  fire, and the darkness grew thicker. He could no longer  see the pale  outline of her face, and he drew back a little,  possessed by the  thought that it was sacrilegious to bend nearer  to her, like a thief,  in that gloom. She sensed his movement, and  her hand reached to him  and lay lightly with its fingertips  touching his arm. 
  &quot;Jeems,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I'm not sorry&#8212;now&#8212;that I came up to   Cardigan's place that day&#8212;when you thought you were dying. I  wasn't  wrong. You are different. And I made fun of you then, and  laughed at  you, because I knew that you were not going to die.  Will you forgive  me?&quot; 
  He laughed happily. &quot;It's funny how little things work out,   sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;Wasn't a kingdom lost once upon a time  because  some fellow didn't have a horseshoe? Anyway, I knew of a  man whose  life was saved because of a broken pipe-stem. And you  came to me, and  I'm here with you now, because&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Of what?&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;Because of something that happened a long time ago,&quot; he said.   &quot;Something you wouldn't dream could have anything to do with you  or  with me. Shall I tell you about it, Marette?&quot; 
  Her fingers pressed slightly upon his arm. &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course, it's a story of the Police,&quot; he began. &quot;And I won't   mention this fellow's name. You may think of him as that red-  headed  O'Connor, if you want to. But I don't say that it was he.  He was a  constable in the Service and had been away North looking  up some  Indians who were brewing an intoxicating liquor from  roots. That was  six years ago. And he caught something. Le Mort  Rouge, we sometimes  call it&#8212;the Red Death&#8212;or smallpox. And he  was alone when the fever  knocked him down, three hundred miles  from anywhere. His Indian ran  away at the first sign of it, and he  had just time to get up his tent  before he was flat on his back. I  won't try to tell you of the days he  went through. It was a living  death. And he would have died, there is  no doubt of it, if it  hadn't been for a stranger who came along. He  was a white man.  Marette, it doesn't take a great deal of nerve to go  up against a  man with a gun, when you've got a gun of your own; and it  doesn't  take such a lot of nerve to go into battle when a thousand  others  are going with you. But it does take nerve to face what that   stranger faced. And the sick man was nothing to him. He went into   that tent and nursed the other back to life. Then the sickness got   him, and for ten weeks those two were together, each fighting to  save  the other's life, and they won out. But the glory of it was  with the  stranger. He was going west. The constable was going  south. They shook  hands and parted.&quot; 
  Marette's fingers tightened on Kent's arm. And Kent went on. 
  &quot;And the constable never forgot, Gray Goose. He wanted the day to   come when he might repay. And the time came. It was years later,  and  it worked out in a curious way. A man was murdered. And the  constable,  who had become a sergeant now, had talked with the dead  man only a  little while before he was killed. Returning for  something he had  forgotten, it was the sergeant who found him  dead. Very shortly  afterward a man was arrested. There was blood  on his clothing. The  evidence was convincing, deadly. And this  man&#8212;&quot; 
  Kent paused, and in the darkness Marette's hand crept down his arm   to his hand, and her fingers closed round it. 
  &quot;Was the man you lied to save,&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;Yes. When the halfbreed's bullet got me, I thought it was a good   chance to repay Sandy McTrigger for what he did for me in that  tent  years before. But it wasn't heroic. It wasn't even brave. I  thought I  was going to die and that I was risking nothing.&quot; 
  And then there came a soft, joyous little laugh from where her   head lay on the pillow. &quot;And all the time you were lying so   splendidly, Jeems&#8212;I KNEW,&quot; she cried. &quot;I knew that you didn't  kill  Barkley, and I knew that you weren't going to die, and I knew  what  happened in that tent ten years ago. And&#8212;Jeems&#8212;Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  She raised herself from the pillow. Her breath was coming a little   excitedly. Both her hands, instead of one, were gripping his hand   now. &quot;I knew that you didn't kill John Barkley,&quot; she repeated.   &quot;And&#8212;SANDY MCTRIGGER DIDN'T KILL HIM!&quot; 
  &quot;But&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;He DIDN'T,&quot; she interrupted him, almost fiercely. &quot;He was   innocent, as innocent as you were. Jeems&#8212;I Jeems&#8212;I know who  killed  Barkley. Oh, I KNOW&#8212;I KNOW!&quot; 
  A choking sob came into her throat, and then she added, in a voice   which she was straining to make calm, &quot;Don't think that I haven't   faith in you because I can't tell you more now, Jeems,&quot; she said.   &quot;You will understand&#8212;quite soon. When we are safe from the  Police, I  shall tell you. I shall keep nothing from you then. I  shall tell you  about Barkley, and Kedsty&#8212;everything. But I can't  now. It won't be  long. When you tell me we are safe, I shall  believe you. And then&#8212;&quot;  She withdrew her hands from his and  dropped back on her pillow. 
  &quot;And then&#8212;what?&quot; he asked, leaning far over. 
  &quot;You may not like me, Jeems.&quot; 
  &quot;I love you,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Nothing in the world can stop my   loving you.&quot; 
  &quot;Even if I tell you&#8212;soon&#8212;that I killed Barkley?&quot; 
  &quot;No. You would be lying.&quot; 
  &quot;Or&#8212;if I told you&#8212;that I&#8212;killed&#8212;Kedsty?&quot; 
  &quot;No matter what you said, or what proof there might be back there,   I would not believe you.&quot; 
  She was silent. And then, &quot;Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Niska, Little Goddess&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm going to tell you something&#8212;now!&quot; 
  He waited. 
  &quot;It is going to&#8212;shock you&#8212;Jeems.&quot; 
  He felt her arms reaching up. Her two hands touched his shoulders. 
  &quot;Are you listening?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I am listening.&quot; 
  &quot;Because I'm not going to say it very loud.&quot; And then she   whispered, &quot;Jeems&#8212;I LOVE YOU!&quot;
