The moment we reached the quay at Quebec, some two days later, a  dozen young men, with little notebooks in their hands, jumped on  board all at once.    
"Miss Callingham!" they cried with one accord, making a dash for the  quarter-deck. "Which is she? Oh, this!--If you please, Miss  Callingham, I should like to have ten minutes of your time to  interview you!"    
I clapped my hands to my ears, and stood back, all horrified. What I  should have done, I don't know, but for a very kind man in a big  rough overcoat, who had jumped on board at the same time, and made  over to me like the reporters. He stepped up to me at once, pushed  aside the young men, and said in a most friendly tone:    
"Miss Callingham, I think? You'd better come with me, then. These  people are all sharks. Everybody in Quebec's agog to see the Two-  souled Lady. Answer no questions at all. Take not the least notice  of them. Just follow me to the Custom House. Let them rave, but  don't speak to them."    
"Who are you?" I asked blindly, clinging to his arm in my terror.    
"I'm a policeman in plain clothes," my new friend answered; "and  I've been specially detailed by order for this duty. I'm here to  look after you. You've friends in Canada, though you may have quite  forgotten them. They've sent me to help you. Those are two of my  chums there, standing aside by the gangway. We'll walk you off  between us. Don't be afraid.--Here, you sir, there; make way!--No  one shall come near you."    
I was so nervous, and so ashamed that I accepted my strange escort  without inquiry or remonstrance. He helped me, with remarkable  politeness for a common policeman, across to the Custom House, where  I sat waiting for my luggage. Reporters and sightseers, meanwhile,  pressed obtrusively around me. My protector held them back. I was  half wild with embarrassment. I'm naturally a reserved and somewhat  sensitive girl, and this American publicity made me crimson with  bashfulness.    
As I sat there waiting, however, the two other policemen to whom my  champion had beckoned sat one on each side of me, keeping off the  idle crowd, while my first friend looked after the luggage and saw  it safely through the Customs for me. He must be an Inspector, I  fancied, or some other superior officer, the officials were so  deferential to him. I gave him my keys, and he looked after  everything himself. I had nothing, for my part, to do but to sit and  wait patiently for him.    
As soon as he had finished, he called a porter to his side.    
"Vite!" he cried, in a tone of authority, to the man. "Un fiacre!"    
And the porter called one.    
I started to find that I knew what he meant. Till that moment, in my  Second State, I had learned no French, and didn't know I could speak  any. But I recognised the words quite well as soon as he uttered  them. My lost knowledge reasserted itself.    
They bundled on my boxes. The crowd still stood around and gaped at  me, open-mouthed. I got into the cab, more dead than alive.    
"Allez!" my policeman cried to the French-Canadian driver, seating  himself by my side.    
"A la gare du chemin de fer Pacific! Aussi vite que possible!"    
I understood every word. This was wonderful. My memory was coming  back again.    
The man tore along the streets to the Pacific railway station. By  the time we reached it we had distanced the sightseers, though some  of them gave chase. My policeman got out.    
"The train's just going!" he said sharply. "Don't take a ticket for  Palmyra, if you don't want to be followed and tracked out all the  way. They'll telegraph on your destination. Book to Kingston  instead, and then change at Sharbot Lake, and take a second ticket  on from there to Palmyra."    
I listened, half dazed. Palmyra was the place where Dr. Ivor lived.  Yet, even in the hurry of the moment, I wondered much to myself how  the policeman knew I wanted to go to Palmyra.    
There was no time to ask questions, however, or to deliberate on my  plans. I took my ticket as desired, in a turmoil of feelings, and  jumped on to the train. I trusted by this time I had eluded  detection. I ought to have come, I saw now, under a feigned name.  This horrid publicity was more than I could endure. My policeman  helped me in with his persistent politeness, and saw my boxes  checked as far as Sharbot Lake for me. Then he handed me the checks.    
"Go in the Pullman," he said quietly. "It's a long journey, you  know: four-and-twenty hours. You've only just caught it. But if  you'd stopped in Quebec, you'd never have been able to give the  sightseers the slip. You'd have been pestered all through. I think  you're safe now. It was this or nothing."    
"Oh, thank you so much!" I cried, with heartfelt gratitude, leaning  out of the window as the train was on the point of starting. I  pulled out my purse, and drew timidly forth a sovereign. "I've only  English money," I said, hesitating, for I didn't know whether he'd  be offended or not at the offer of a tip--he seemed such a perfect  gentleman. "But if that's any use to you--"    
He smiled a broad smile and shook his head, much amused.    
"Oh, thank you," he said, half laughing, with a very curious air.  "I'm a policeman, as I told you. But I don't need tips. I'm the  Chief Constable of Quebec--there's my card; Major Tascherel,--and  I'm glad to be of use, I'm sure, to any friend of Dr. Ivor's."    
He lifted his hat with the inborn grace of a high-born gentleman. I  coloured and bowed. The train steamed out of the station. As it  went, I fell back, half fainting, in the comfortable armchair of the  Pullman car, hardly able to speak with surprise and horror. It was  all so strange, so puzzling, so bewildering! Then I owed my escape  from the stenographic myrmidons of the Canadian Press to the polite  care and attention of my father's murderer!    
Major Tascherel was a friend, he said, of Dr. Ivor's!    
Then Dr. Ivor knew I had come. He knew I was going to Palmyra to  find him. And yet he had written to Quebec, apparently, expecting  this crush, and asking his friend the Chief Constable to protect and  befriend me. Had he murdered my father, and was he in love with me  still? Did he think I'd come out, not to track him down, but to look  for him? Strange, horrible questions! My heart stood still within me  at this extraordinary revelation. Yet I was so frightened at the  moment, alone in a strange land, that I felt almost grateful to the  murderer himself for his kindness in thinking of me and providing  for my reception.    
As I settled in my seat and had time to realise what these things  meant, it dawned upon me by degrees that all this was less  remarkable, after all, than I first thought it. For they had  telegraphed from England that I sailed on the Sarmatian; and Dr.  Ivor, like everybody else, must have read the telegram. He might  naturally conclude I would be half-mobbed by reporters; and as it  was clear he had once been fond of me--hateful as I felt it even to  admit the fact to myself--he might really have desired to save me  annoyance and trouble. It was degrading, to be sure, even to think I  owed anything of any sort to such a wretch as that murderer; yet in  a certain corner of my heart I couldn't help being thankful to him.  But how strange to feel I had come there on purpose to hunt him  down! How horrible that I must so repay good with evil!    
Then a still more ghastly thought surged up suddenly in my mind. Why  on earth did he think I was going to Palmyra? Was it possible he  fancied I loved him still--that I wanted to marry him? Could he  imagine I'd come out just to fling myself at his feet and ask him to  take me? Could he suppose I'd forgotten all the rest of my past  life, and his vile act as well, and yet remembered alone what  little love, if any, I ever had borne him? It was incredible that  any man, however wicked, however conceited, should think such folly  as that--that a girl would marry her father's murderer; and yet what  might not one expect from a man who, after having shot my father,  had still the inconceivable and unbelievable audacity to take  deliberate steps for securing my own comfort and happiness? From  such a wretch as that, one might look for almost anything!    
For ten minutes or more, as we whirled along the line in the Pullman  car, I was too dazed and confused to notice anything around me. My  brain swam vaguely, filled full with wild whirling thoughts; the  strange drama of my life, always teeming with mysteries, seemed to  culminate in this reception in an unknown land by people who  appeared almost to know more about my business than I myself did. I  gazed out of the window blankly. In some vague dim way I saw we were  passing between rocky hills, pine-clad and beautiful, with deep  glimpses now and then into the riven gorge of a noble river. But I  didn't even realise to myself that these were Canadian hills--those  were the heights of Abraham--that was the silver St. Lawrence. It  all passed by like a living dream. I sat still in my chair, as one  stunned and faint; I gazed out, more dead than alive, on the  unfamiliar scene that unrolled itself in exquisite panorama before  me. Quebec and the Laurentian hills were to me half unreal: the  inner senses alone were awake and conscious.    
Presently a gentle voice at my side broke, not at all unpleasantly,  the current of my reflections. It was a lady's voice, very sweet and  musical.    
"I'm afraid," it said kindly, with an air of tender solicitude, "you  only just caught the train, and were hurried and worried and  flurried at the last at the station. You look so white and tired.  How your breath comes and goes! And I think you're new to our  Canadian ways. I saw you didn't understand about the checks for the  baggage. Let me take away this bag and put it up in the rack for  you. Here's a footstool for your feet; that'll make you more  comfortable."    
At the first sound of her sweet voice, I turned to look at the  speaker. She was a girl, perhaps a year or two younger than myself,  very slender and graceful, and with eyes like a mother's. She wasn't  exactly pretty, but her face was so full of intelligence and  expression that it was worth a great deal more than any doll-like  prettiness.    
Perhaps it was pleasure at being spoken to kindly at all in this  land of strangers; perhaps it was revulsion from the agony of shame  and modesty I had endured at Quebec; but, at any rate, I felt drawn  at first sight to my sweet-voiced fellow-traveller. Besides, she  reminded me somewhat of Minnie Moore, and that resemblance alone was  enough to attract me. I looked up at her gratefully.    
"Oh, thank you so much!" I cried, putting my bag in her hand. "I've  only just come out from England; and I'd hardly time at Quebec to  catch the train; and the people crowded around so, that I was  flustered at landing; and everything somehow seems to be going  against me."    
And with that my poor overwrought nerves gave way all at once, and  without any more ado I just burst out crying.    
The lady by my side leant over me tenderly.    
"There--cry, dear," she said, as if she'd known me for years,  stooping down and almost caressing me. "Jack,"--and she turned to a  tall gentleman at her side,--"quick! you've got my black bag; get me  out the sal volatile. She's quite faint, poor thing; we must look  after her instantly."    
The person to whom she spoke, and who was apparently her husband or  her brother, took down the black bag from the rack hastily, and got  out the sal volatile, as my friend directed him. He poured a little  into a tumbler and held it quietly to my lips. I liked his manner,  as I'd liked the lady's. He was so very brotherly. Besides, there  was something extremely soothing about his quick, noiseless way. He  did it all so fast, yet without the faintest sign of agitation. I  couldn't help thinking what a good nurse he would make; he was so  rapid and effective, yet so gentle and so quiet. He seemed perfectly  accustomed to the ways of nervous women.    
I dried my eyes after a while, and looked up in his face. He was  very good-looking, and had a charming soft smile. How lucky I should  have tumbled upon such pleasant travelling companions! In my present  mental state, I had need of sympathy. And, indeed, they took as much  care of me, and coddled me up as tenderly, as if they'd known me for  years. I was almost tempted to make a clean breast of my personality  to them, and tell them why it was I had been so worried and upset by  my reception at Quebec: but I shrank from confessing it. I hated my  own name, almost, it seemed to bring me such very unpleasant  notoriety.    
In a very few minutes, I felt quite at home with my new friends. I  explained to them that when I landed I had no intention of going on  West by train at once, but that news which I received on the way had  compelled me to push forward by the very first chance; and that I  had to change my ticket at a place called Sharbot Lake, whose very  position or distance I hadn't had time to discover. The lady smiled  sweetly, and calmed my fears by telling me we wouldn't reach Sharbot  Lake till mid-day to-morrow, and that I would have plenty of time  there to book on to my destination.    
Thus encouraged, I went on to tell them I had no Canadian money,  having brought out what I needed for travelling expenses and hotels  in Bank of England 20 pound notes. The lady smiled again, and said  in the friendliest way:    
"Oh, my brother'll get them changed for you at Montreal as we pass,  won't you, Jack? or at least as much as you need till you get  to"--she checked herself--"the end of your journey."    
I noticed how she pulled herself up, though at the moment I attached  no particular importance to it.    
So he was her brother, not her husband, then! Well, he was a very  nice fellow, either way, and nobody could be kinder or more  sympathetic than he'd been to me so far.    
We fell into conversation, which soon by degrees grew quite  intimate.    
"How far West are you going?" the man she called Jack asked after a  little time, tentatively.    
And I answered, all unsuspiciously:    
"To a place called Palmyra."    
"Why, we live not far from Palmyra," the sister replied, with a  smile. "We're going that way now. Our station's Adolphus Town, the  very next village."    
I hadn't yet learned to join the wisdom of the serpent to the  innocence of the dove, I'm afraid. Remember, though in some ways I  was a woman full grown, in others I was little more than a four-  year-old baby.    
"Do you know a Dr. Ivor there?" I asked eagerly, leaning forward.    
"Oh, yes, quite well," the lady answered, arranging my footstool  more comfortably as she spoke. "He's got a farm out there now, and  hardly practises at all. How queer it is! One always finds one knows  people in common. Is Dr. Ivor a friend of yours?"    
I recoiled at the stray question almost as if I'd been shot.    
"Oh, no!" I cried, horrified at the bare idea of such treason. "He's  anything but a friend... I--I only wanted to know about him."    
The lady looked at Jack, and Jack looked at the lady. Were they  telegraphing signs? I fancied somehow they gave one another very  meaning glances. Jack was the first to speak, breaking an awkward  silence.    
"You can't expect everyone to know your own friends, or to like them  either, Elsie," he said slowly, with his eyes fixed hard on her, as  if he expected her to flare up.    
My heart misgave me. A hateful idea arose in it. Could my sweet  travelling companion be engaged--to my father's murderer?    
"But he's a dear good fellow, for all that, Jack," Elsie said  stoutly; and strange as it sounds to say so, I admired her for  sticking up for her friend Dr. Ivor, if she really liked him. "I  won't hear him run down by anybody, not even by <i>you</i>. If this lady  knew him better, I'm sure she'd like him, as we all do."    
Jack turned the conversation abruptly.    
"But if you're going to Palmyra," he asked, "where do you mean to  stop? Have you thought about lodgings? You mustn't imagine it's a  place like an English town, with an inn or hotel or good private  apartments. There's nowhere you can put up at in these brand-new  villages. Are you going to friends, or did you expect to find  quarters as easily as in England?"    
This was a difficulty which, indeed, had never even occurred to me  till that moment. I stammered and hesitated.    
"Well," I said slowly, "to tell you the truth, I haven't thought  about that. The landing at Quebec was such a dreadful surprise to  me, and"--tears came into my eyes again--"I had a great shock  there--and I had to come on so quick, I didn't ask about anything  but catching the train. I meant to stop a night or two either at  Quebec or in Montreal, and to make all inquiries: but circumstances,  you see, have prevented that. So I really don't know what I'd better  do when I get to Palmyra."    
"I do," my new friend answered quickly, her soft sweet voice having  quite a decisive ring in it. "You'd better not go on to Palmyra at  all. There's no sort of accommodation there, except a horrid  drinking-saloon. You'd better stop short at Adolphus Town and spend  the night with us; and then you can look about you next day, if you  like, and see what chance there may be of finding decent quarters.  Old Mrs. Wilkins might take her in, Jack, or the Blacks at the  tannery."    
I smiled, and felt touched.    
"Oh, how good of you!" I cried. "But I really couldn't think of it.  Thank you ever so much, though, for your kind thought, all the same.  It's so good and sweet of you. But you don't even know who I am. I  have no introduction."    
"You're your own best introduction," Elsie said, with a pretty nod:  I thought of her somehow from the very first moment I heard her name  as Elsie. "And as to your not knowing us, never mind about that. We  know <i>you</i> at first sight. It's the Canadian way to entertain Angels  unawares. Out here, you know, hospitality's the rule of the  country."    
Well, I demurred for a long time; I fought off their invitation as  well as I could: I couldn't bear thus to quarter myself upon utter  strangers. But they both were so pressing, and brought up so many  cogent arguments why I couldn't go alone to the one village  saloon--a mere whisky-drinking public-house, they said, of very bad  character,--that in the long run I was fain almost to acquiesce in  their kind plan for my temporary housing. Besides, after my horrid  experience at Quebec, it was such a positive relief to me to meet  anybody nice and delicate, that I couldn't find it in my heart to  refuse these dear people. And then, perhaps it was best not to go  quite on to Palmyra at once, for fear of unexpectedly running  against my father's murderer. If I met him in the street, and he  recognised me and spoke to me, what on earth could I do? My head was  all in a whirl, indeed, as to what he might intend or expect: for I  felt sure he expected me. I made one last despairing effort.    
"If I stop at your house, though," I said, half ashamed of myself  for venturing to make conditions, "there's one promise you must make  me--that I sha'n't see Dr. Ivor unless you let me know and get my  consent beforehand."    
Jack, as I called him to myself, answered gaily back with a rather  curious smile:    
"If you like, you need see nobody but our own two selves. We'll  promise not to introduce anybody to you without due leave, and to  let you do as you like in that and in everything."    
So I yielded at last.    
"Well, I must know your name," I said tentatively.    
And Jack, looking queerly at me with an inquiring air, said:    
"My sister's name's Elsie; mine's John Cheriton."    
"And yours?" Elsie asked, glancing timidly down at me.    
My heart beat hard. I was face to face with a dilemma. These were  friends of Courtenay Ivor's, and I had given myself away to them. I  was going to their house, to accept their hospitality--and to  betray their friend! Never in my life did I feel so guilty before.  Oh! what on earth was I to do? I had told them too much; I had gone  to work foolishly. If I said my real name, I should let out my whole  secret. I must brazen it out now. With tremulous lips and flushed  cheek, I answered quickly, "Julia Marsden."    
Elsie drew back, all abashed. In a moment her cheek grew still  redder, I felt sure, than my own.    
"Oh, Marsden!" she cried, eyeing me close. "Why, I thought you were  Miss Callingham!"    
"How on earth did you know that?" I exclaimed, terrified almost out  of my life. Was I never for one moment to escape my own personality?    
"Why, they put it in the papers that you were coming," Elsie  answered, looking tenderly at me, more in sympathy than in anger.  "And it's written on your bag, you know, that Jack put up in the  rack there... That's why we were so sorry for you, and so grieved at  the way you must have been hustled on the quay. And that's also why  we wanted you to come to us... But don't be a bit afraid. We quite  understand you want to travel incognita. After the sort of reception  you got at Quebec, no wonder you're afraid of these hateful  sightseers!... Very well, dear," she took my hand with the air of an  old friend, "your disguise shall be respected while you stop at our  house. Miss Marsden let it be. You can make any inquiries you like  about Dr. Ivor. We will be secrecy itself. We'll say nothing to  anyone. And my brother'll take your ticket at Sharbot Lake for  Adolphus Town."    
I broke down once more. I fairly cried at such kindness.    
"Oh, how good you are!" I said. "How very, very good. This is more  than one could ever have expected from strangers."    
She held my hand and stroked it.    
"We're not strangers," she answered. "We're English ourselves. We  sympathise deeply with you in this new, strange country. You must  treat us exactly like a brother and sister. We liked you at first  sight, and we're sure we'll get on with you."    
I lifted her hand to my lips and kissed it.    
"And I liked you also," I said, "and your brother, too. You're both  so good and kind. How can I ever sufficiently thank you?"
