High up among the heather-clad hills which form the broad dividing  barrier between England and Scotland, the little river Esk brawls and  bickers over its stony bed through a wild land of barren braesides and  brown peat mosses, forming altogether some of the gloomiest and most  forbidding scenery in the whole expanse of northern Britain. Almost the  entire bulk of the counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Ayr is  composed of just such solemn desolate upland wolds, with only a few  stray farms or solitary cottages sprinkled at wide distances over their  bare bleak surface, and with scarcely any sign of life in any part save  the little villages which cluster here and there at long intervals  around some stern and simple Scottish church. Yet the hardy people who  inhabit this wild and chilly moorland country may well be considered to  rank among the best raw material of society in the whole of Britain; for  from the peasant homes of these southern Scotch Highlands have come  forth, among a host of scarcely less distinguished natives, three men,  at least, who deserve to take their place in the very front line of  British thinkers or workers--Thomas Telford, Robert Burns, and Thomas  Carlyle. By origin, all three alike belonged in the very strictest sense  to the working classes; and the story of each is full of lessons or of  warnings for every one of us: but that of Telford is perhaps the most  encouraging and the most remarkable of all, as showing how much may be  accomplished by energy and perseverance, even under the most absolutely  adverse and difficult circumstances.    
Near the upper end of Eskdale, in the tiny village of Westerkirk, a  young shepherd's wife gave birth to a son on the 9th of August, 1757.  Her husband, John Telford, was employed in tending sheep on a  neighbouring farm, and he and his Janet occupied a small cottage close  by, with mud walls and rudely thatched roof, such as in southern England  even the humblest agricultural labourer would scarcely consent willingly  to inhabit. Before the child was three months old, his father died; and  Janet Telford was left alone in the world with her unweaned baby. But in  remote country districts, neighbours are often more neighbourly than in  great towns; and a poor widow can manage to eke out a livelihood for  herself with an occasional lift from the helping hands of friendly  fellow-villagers. Janet Telford had nothing to live upon save her own  ten fingers; but they were handy enough, after the sturdy Scotch  fashion, and they earned some sort of livelihood in a humble way for  herself and her fatherless boy. The farmers about found her work on  their farms at haymaking or milking, and their wives took the child home  with them while its mother was busy labouring in the harvest fields.  Amid such small beginnings did the greatest of English engineers before  the railway era receive his first hard lessons in the art of life.    
After her husband's death, the poor widow removed from her old cottage  to a still more tiny hut, which she shared with a neighbour--a very  small hut, with a single door for both families; and here young Tam  Telford spent most of his boyhood in the quiet honourable poverty of the  uncomplaining rural poor. As soon as he was big enough to herd sheep, he  was turned out upon the hillside in summer like any other ragged country  laddie, and in winter he tended cows, receiving for wages only his food  and money enough to cover the cost of his scanty clothing. He went to  school, too; how, nobody now knows: but he <i>did</i> go, to the parish  school of Westerkirk, and there he learnt with a will, in the winter  months, though he had to spend the summer on the more profitable task of  working in the fields. To a steady earnest boy like young Tam Telford,  however, it makes all the difference in the world that he should have  been to school, no matter how simply. Those twenty-six letters of the  alphabet, once fairly learnt, are the key, after all, to all the book-  learning in the whole world. Without them, the shepherd-boy might remain  an ignorant, unprogressive shepherd all his life long, even his  undeniable native energy using itself up on nothing better than a  wattled hurdle or a thatched roof; with them, the path is open before  him which led Tam Telford at last to the Menai Bridge and Westminster  Abbey.    
When Tam had gradually eaten his way through enough thin oatmeal  porridge (with very little milk, we fear) to make him into a hearty lad  of fifteen, it began to be high time for him to choose himself a final  profession in life, such as he was able. And here already the born  tastes of the boy began to show themselves: for he had no liking for the  homely shepherd's trade; he felt a natural desire for a chisel and a  hammer--the engineer was there already in the grain--and he was  accordingly apprenticed to a stonemason in the little town of Lochmaben,  beyond the purple hills to eastward. But his master was a hard man; he  had small mercy for the raw lad; and after trying to manage with him for  a few months, Tam gave it up, took the law into his own hands, and ran  away. Probably the provocation was severe, for in after-life Telford  always showed himself duly respectful to constituted authority; and we  know that petty self-made master-workmen are often apt to be excessively  severe to their own hired helpers, and especially to helpless lads or  young apprentices. At any rate, Tam wouldn't go back; and in the end, a  well-to-do cousin, who had risen to the proud position of steward at the  great hall of the parish, succeeded in getting another mason at  Langholm, the little capital of Eskdale, to take over the runaway for  the remainder of the term of his indentures.    
At Langholm, a Scotch country town of the quietest and sleepiest  description, Tam Telford passed the next eight years of his uneventful  early life, first as an apprentice, and afterwards as a journeyman mason  of the humblest type. He had a good mother, and he was a good son. On  Saturday nights he generally managed to walk over to the cottage at  Westerkirk, and accompany the poor widow to the Sunday services at the  parish kirk. As long as she lived, indeed, he never forgot her; and one  of the first tasks he set himself when he was out of his indentures was  to cut a neat headstone with a simple but beautiful inscription for the  grave of that shepherd father whom he had practically never seen. At  Langholm, an old maiden lady, Miss Pasley, interested herself kindly in  Janet Telford's rising boy. She lent him what of all things the eager  lad most needed--books; and the young mason applied himself to them in  all his spare moments with the vigorous ardour and perseverance of  healthy youth. The books he read were not merely those which bore  directly or indirectly upon his own craft: if they had been, Tam Telford  might have remained nothing more than a journeyman mason all the days of  his life. It is a great mistake, even from the point of view of mere  worldly success, for a young man to read or learn only what "pays" in  his particular calling; the more he reads and learns, the more will he  find that seemingly useless things "pay" in the end, and that what  apparently pays least, often really pays most in the long run. This is  not the only or the best reason why every man should aim at the highest  possible cultivation of his own talents, be they what they may; but it  is in itself a very good reason, and it is a sufficient answer for those  who would deter us from study of any high kind on the ground that it  "does no good." Telford found in after-life that his early acquaintance  with sound English literature did do him a great deal of good: it opened  and expanded his mind; it trained his intelligence; it stored his brain  with images and ideas which were ever after to him a source of  unmitigated delight and unalloyed pleasure. He read whenever he had  nothing else to do. He read Milton with especial delight; and he also  read the verses that his fellow-countryman, Rob Burns, the Ayrshire  ploughman, was then just beginning to speak straight to the heart of  every aspiring Scotch peasant lad. With these things Tam Telford filled  the upper stories of his brain quite as much as with the trade details  of his own particular useful handicraft; and the result soon showed that  therein Tam Telford had not acted uncannily or unwisely.    
Nor did he read only; he wrote too--verses, not very good, nor yet very  bad, but well expressed, in fairly well chosen language, and with due  regard to the nice laws of metre and of grammar, which is in itself a  great point. Writing verse is an occupation at which only very few even  among men of literary education ever really succeed; and nine-tenths of  published verse is mere mediocre twaddle, quite unworthy of being put  into the dignity of print. Yet Telford did well for all that in trying  his hand, with but poor result, at this most difficult and dangerous of  all the arts. His rhymes were worth nothing as rhymes; but they were  worth a great deal as discipline and training: they helped to form the  man, and that in itself is always something. Most men who have in them  the power to do any great thing pass in early life through a verse-  making stage. The verses never come to much; but they leave their stamp  behind them; and the man is all the better in the end for having thus  taught himself the restraint, the command of language, the careful  choice of expressions, the exercise of deliberate pains in composition,  which even bad verse-making necessarily implies. It is a common mistake  of near-sighted minds to look only at the immediate results of things,  without considering their remoter effects. When Tam Telford, stonemason  of Langholm, began at twenty-two years of age to pen poetical epistles  to Robert Burns, most of his fellow-workmen doubtless thought he was  giving himself up to very foolish and nonsensical practices; but he was  really helping to educate Thomas Telford, engineer of the Holyhead Road  and the Caledonian Canal, for all his future usefulness and greatness.    
As soon as Tam was out of his indentures, he began work as a journeyman  mason at Langholm on his own account, at the not very magnificent wages  of eighteenpence a day. That isn't much; but at any rate it is an  independence. Besides building many houses in his own town, Tam made  here his first small beginning in the matter of roads and highways, by  helping to build a bridge over the Esk at Langholm. He was very proud of  his part in this bridge, and to the end of his life he often referred to  it as his first serious engineering work. Many of the stones still bear  his private mark, hewn with the tool into their solid surface, with  honest workmanship which helps to explain his later success. But the  young mason was beginning to discover that Eskdale was hardly a wide  enough field for his budding ambition. He could carve the most careful  headstones; he could cut the most ornamental copings for doors or  windows; he could even build a bridge across the roaring flooded Esk;  but he wanted to see a little of the great world, and learn how men and  masons went about their work in the busy centres of the world's  activity. So, like a patriotic Scotchman that he was, he betook himself  straight to Edinburgh, tramping it on foot, of course, for railways did  not yet exist, and coaches were not for the use of such as young Thomas  Telford.    
He arrived in the grey old capital of Scotland in the very nick of time.  The Old Town, a tangle of narrow alleys and close courtyards, surrounded  by tall houses with endless tiers of floors, was just being deserted by  the rich and fashionable world for the New Town, which lies beyond a  broad valley on the opposite hillside, and contains numerous streets of  solid and handsome stone houses, such as are hardly to be found in any  other town in Britain, except perhaps Bath and Aberdeen. Edinburgh is  always, indeed, an interesting place for an enthusiastic lover of  building, be he architect or stonemason; for instead of being built of  brick like London and so many other English centres, it is built partly  of a fine hard local sandstone and partly of basaltic greenstone; and  besides its old churches and palaces, many of the public buildings are  particularly striking and beautiful architectural works. But just at the  moment when young Telford walked wearily into Edinburgh at the end of  his long tramp, there was plenty for a stout strong mason to do in the  long straight stone fronts of the rising New Town. For two years, he  worked away patiently at his trade in "the grey metropolis of the  North;" and he took advantage of the special opportunities the place  afforded him to learn drawing, and to make minute sketches in detail of  Holyrood Palace, Heriot's Hospital, Roslyn Chapel, and all the other  principal old buildings in which the neighbourhood of the capital is  particularly rich. So anxious, indeed, was the young mason to perfect  himself by the study of the very best models in his own craft, that when  at the end of two years he walked back to revisit his good mother in  Eskdale, he took the opportunity of making drawings of Melrose Abbey,  the most exquisite and graceful building that the artistic stone-cutters  of the Middle Ages have handed down to our time in all Scotland.    
This visit to Eskdale was really Telford's last farewell to his old  home, before setting out on a journey which was to form the turning-  point in his own history, and in the history of British engineering as  well. In Scotch phrase, he was going south. And after taking leave of  his mother (not quite for the last time) he went south in good earnest,  doing this journey on horseback; for his cousin the steward had lent him  a horse to make his way southward like a gentleman. Telford turned where  all enterprising young Scotchmen of his time always turned: towards the  unknown world of London--that world teeming with so many possibilities  of brilliant success or of miserable squalid failure. It was the year  1782, and the young man was just twenty-five. No sooner had he reached  the great city than he began looking about him for suitable work. He had  a letter of introduction to the architect of Somerset House, whose  ornamental fronts were just then being erected, facing the Strand and  the river; and Telford was able to get a place at once on the job as a  hewer of the finer architectural details, for which both his taste and  experience well fitted him. He spent some two years in London at this  humble post as a stone-cutter; but already he began to aspire to  something better. He earned first-class mason's wages now, and saved  whatever he did not need for daily expenses. In this respect, the  improvidence of his English fellow-workmen struck the cautious young  Scotchman very greatly. They lived, he said, from week to week entirely;  any time beyond a week seemed unfortunately to lie altogether outside  the range of their limited comprehension.    
At the end of two years in London, Telford's skill and study began to  bear good fruit. His next engagement was one which raised him for the  first time in his life above the rank of a mere journeyman mason. The  honest workman had attracted the attention of competent judges. He  obtained employment as foreman of works of some important buildings in  Portsmouth Dockyard. A proud man indeed was Thomas Telford at this  change of fortune, and very proudly he wrote to his old friends in  Eskdale, with almost boyish delight, about the trust reposed in him by  the commissioners and officers, and the pains he was taking with the  task entrusted to him. For he was above all things a good workman, and  like all good workmen he felt a pride and an interest in all the jobs he  took in hand. His sense of responsibility and his sensitiveness, indeed,  were almost too great at times for his own personal comfort. Things  <i>will</i> go wrong now and then, even with the greatest care; well-  planned undertakings will not always pay, and the best engineering does  not necessarily succeed in earning a dividend; but whenever such mishaps  occurred to his employers, Telford felt the disappointment much too  keenly, as though he himself had been to blame for their miscalculations  or over-sanguine hopes. Still, it is a good thing to put one's heart in  one's work, and so much Thomas Telford certainly did.    
About this time, too, the rising young mason began to feel that he must  get a little more accurate scientific knowledge. The period for general  study had now passed by, and the period for special trade reading had  set in. This was well. A lad cannot do better than lay a good foundation  of general knowledge and general literature during the period when he is  engaged in forming his mind: a young man once fairly launched in life  may safely confine himself for a time to the studies that bear directly  upon his own special chosen subject. The thing that Telford began  closely to investigate was--lime. Now, lime makes mortar; and without  lime, accordingly, you can have no mason. But to know anything really  about lime, Telford found he must read some chemistry; and to know  anything really about chemistry he must work at it hard and  unremittingly. A strict attention to one's own business, understood in  this very broad and liberal manner, is certainly no bad thing for any  struggling handicraftsman, whatever his trade or profession may happen  to be.    
In 1786, when Telford was nearly thirty, a piece of unexpected good luck  fell to his lot. And yet it was not so much good luck as due recognition  of his sterling qualities by a wealthy and appreciative person. Long  before, while he was still in Eskdale, one Mr. Pulteney, a man of social  importance, who had a large house in the bleak northern valley, had  asked his advice about the repairs of his own mansion. We may be sure  that Telford did his work on that occasion carefully and well; for now,  when Mr. Pulteney wished to restore the ruins of Shrewsbury Castle as a  dwelling-house, he sought out the young mason who had attended to his  Scotch property, and asked him to superintend the proposed alterations  in his Shropshire castle. Nor was that all: by Mr. Pulteney's influence,  Telford was shortly afterwards appointed to be county surveyor of public  works, having under his care all the roads, bridges, gaols, and public  buildings in the whole of Shropshire. Thus the Eskdale shepherd-boy rose  at last from the rank of a working mason, and attained the well-earned  dignity of an engineer and a professional man.    
Telford had now a fair opportunity of showing the real stuff of which he  was made. Those, of course, were the days when railroads had not yet  been dreamt of; when even roads were few and bad; when communications  generally were still in a very disorderly and unorganized condition. It  is Telford's special glory that he reformed and altered this whole state  of things; he reduced the roads of half Britain to system and order; he  made the finest highways and bridges then ever constructed; and by his  magnificent engineering works, especially his aqueducts, he paved the  way unconsciously but surely for the future railways. If it had not been  for such great undertakings as Telford's Holyhead Road, which  familiarized men's minds with costly engineering operations, it is  probable that projectors would long have stood aghast at the alarming  expense of a nearly level iron road running through tall hills and over  broad rivers the whole way from London to Manchester.    
At first, Telford's work as county surveyor lay mostly in very small  things indeed--mere repairs of sidepaths or bridges, which gave him  little opportunity to develop his full talents as a born engineer. But  in time, being found faithful in small things, his employers, the county  magistrates, began to consult him more and more on matters of  comparative importance. First, it was a bridge to be built across the  Severn; then a church to be planned at Shrewsbury, and next, a second  church in Coalbrookdale. If he was thus to be made suddenly into an  architect, Telford thought, almost without being consulted in the  matter, he must certainly set out to study architecture. So, with  characteristic vigour, he went to work to visit London, Worcester,  Gloucester, Bath, and Oxford, at each place taking care to learn  whatever was to be learned in the practice of his new art. Fortunately,  however, for Telford and for England, it was not architecture in the  strict sense that he was finally to practise as a real profession.  Another accident, as thoughtless people might call it, led him to adopt  engineering in the end as the path in life he elected to follow. In  1793, he was appointed engineer to the projected Ellesmere Canal.    
In the days before railways, such a canal as this was an engineering  work of the very first importance. It was to connect the Mersey, the  Dee, and the Severn, and it passed over ground which rendered necessary  some immense aqueducts on a scale never before attempted by British  engineers. Even in our own time, every traveller by the Great Western  line between Chester and Shrewsbury must have observed on his right two  magnificent ranges as high arches, which are as noticeable now as ever  for their boldness, their magnitude, and their exquisite construction.  The first of these mighty archways is the Pont Cysylltau aqueduct which  carries the Ellesmere Canal across the wide valley of the Dee, known as  the Vale of Llangollen; the second is the Chirk aqueduct, which takes it  over the lesser glen of a minor tributary, the Ceriog. Both these  beautiful works were designed and carried out entirely by Telford. They  differ from many other great modern engineering achievements in the fact  that, instead of spoiling the lovely mountain scenery into whose midst  they have been thrown, they actually harmonize with it and heighten its  natural beauty. Both works, however, are splendid feats, regarded merely  as efforts of practical skill; and the larger one is particularly  memorable for the peculiarity that the trough for the water and the  elegant parapet at the side are both entirely composed of iron.  Nowadays, of course, there would be nothing remarkable in the use of  such a material for such a purpose; but Telford was the first engineer  to see the value of iron in this respect, and the Pont Cysylltau  aqueduct was one of the earliest works in which he applied the new  material to these unwonted uses. Such a step is all the more remarkable,  because Telford's own education had lain entirely in what may fairly be  called the "stone age" of English engineering; while his natural  predilections as a stonemason might certainly have made him rather  overlook the value of the novel material. But Telford was a man who  could rise superior to such little accidents of habit or training; and  as a matter of fact there is no other engineer to whom the rise of the  present "iron age" in engineering work is more directly and immediately  to be attributed than to himself.    
Meanwhile, the Eskdale pioneer did not forget his mother. For years he  had constantly written to her, in <i>print hand</i>, so that the letters  might be more easily read by her aged eyes; he had sent her money in  full proportion to his means; and he had taken every possible care to  let her declining years be as comfortable as his altered circumstances  could readily make them. And now, in the midst of this great and  responsible work, he found time to "run down" to Eskdale (very different  "running down" from that which we ourselves can do by the London and  North Western Railway), to see his aged mother once more before she  died. What a meeting that must have been, between the poor old widow of  the Eskdale shepherd, and her successful son, the county surveyor of  Shropshire, and engineer of the great and important Ellesmere Canal!    
While Telford was working busily upon his wonderful canal, he had many  other schemes to carry out of hardly less importance, in connection with  his appointment as county surveyor. His beautiful iron bridge across the  Severn at Build was was another application of his favourite metal to the  needs of the new world that was gradually growing up in industrial  England; and so satisfied was he with the result of his experiment (for  though not absolutely the first, it was one of the first iron bridges  ever built) that he proposed another magnificent idea, which  unfortunately was never carried into execution. Old London Bridge had  begun to get a trifle shaky; and instead of rebuilding it, Telford  wished to span the whole river by a single iron arch, whose splendid  dimensions would have formed one of the most remarkable engineering  triumphs ever invented. The scheme, for some good reason, doubtless, was  not adopted; but it is impossible to look at Telford's grand drawing of  the proposed bridge--a single bold arch, curving across the Thames from  side to side, with the dome of St Paul's rising majestically above it--  without a feeling of regret that such a noble piece of theoretical  architecture was never realized in actual fact.    
Telford had now come to be regarded as the great practical authority  upon all that concerned roads or communications; and he was reaping the  due money-reward of his diligence and skill. Every day he was called  upon to design new bridges and other important structures in all parts  of the kingdom, but more especially in Scotland and on the Welsh border.  Many of the most picturesque bridges in Britain, which every tourist has  admired, often without inquiring or thinking of the hand that planned  them, were designed by his inventive brain. The exquisite stone arch  which links the two banks of the lesser Scotch Dee in its gorge at  Tongueland is one of the most picturesque; for Telford was a bit of an  artist at heart, and, unlike too many modern railway constructors, he  always endeavoured to make his bridges and aqueducts beautify rather  than spoil the scenery in whose midst they stood. Especially was he  called in to lay out the great system of roads by which the Scotch  Highlands, then so lately reclaimed from a state of comparative  barbarism, were laid open for the great development they have since  undergone. In the earlier part of the century, it is true, a few central  highways had been run through the very heart of that great solid block  of mountains; but these were purely military roads, to enable the king's  soldiers more easily to march against the revolted clans, and they had  hardly more connection with the life of the country than the bare  military posts, like Fort William and Fort Augustus, which guarded their  ends, had to do with the ordinary life of a commercial town. Meanwhile,  however, the Highlands had begun gradually to settle down; and Telford's  roads were intended for the far higher and better purpose of opening out  the interior of northern Scotland to the humanizing influences of trade  and industry.    
Fully to describe the great work which the mature engineer constructed  in the Highland region, would take up more space than could be allotted  to such a subject anywhere save in a complete industrial history of  roads and travelling in modern Britain. It must suffice to say that when  Telford took the matter in hand, the vast block of country north and  west of the Great Glen of Caledonia (which divides the Highlands in two  between Inverness and Ben Nevis)--a block comprising the counties of  Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Cromarty, and half Inverness--had literally  nothing within it worthy of being called a road. Wheeled carts or  carriages were almost unknown, and all burdens were conveyed on pack-  horses, or, worse still, on the broad backs of Highland lassies. The  people lived in small scattered villages, and communications from one to  another were well-nigh impossible. Telford set to work to give the  country, not a road or two, but a main system of roads. First, he  bridged the broad river Tay at Dunkeld, so as to allow of a direct route  straight into the very jaws of the Highlands. Then, he also bridged over  the Beauly at Inverness, so as to connect the opposite sides of the  Great Glen with one another. Next, he laid out a number of trunk lines,  running through the country on both banks, to the very north of  Caithness, and the very west of the Isle of Skye. Whoever to this day  travels on the main thoroughfares in the greater Scottish Islands--in  Arran, Islay, Jura, Mull; or in the wild peninsula of Morvern, and the  Land of Lorne; or through the rugged regions of Inverness-shire and  Ross-shire, where the railway has not yet penetrated,--travels  throughout on Telford's roads. The number of large bridges and other  great engineering masterpieces on this network of roads is enormous;  among the most famous and the most beautiful, are the exquisite single  arch which spans the Spey just beside the lofty rearing rocks of Craig  Ellachie, and the bridge across the Dee, beneath the purple heather-clad  braes of Ballater. Altogether, on Telford's Highland roads alone, there  are no fewer than twelve hundred bridges.    
Nor were these the only important labours by which Telford ministered to  the comfort and well-being of his Scotch fellow-countrymen. Scotland's  debt to the Eskdale stonemason is indeed deep and lasting. While on  land, he improved her communications by his great lines of roads, which  did on a smaller scale for the Highland valleys what railways have since  done for the whole of the civilized world; he also laboured to improve  her means of transit at sea by constructing a series of harbours along  that bare and inhospitable eastern coast, once almost a desert, but now  teeming with great towns and prosperous industries. It was Telford who  formed the harbour of Wick, which has since grown from a miserable  fishing village into a large town, the capital of the North Sea herring  fisheries. It was he who enlarged the petty port of Peterhead into the  chief station of the flourishing whaling trade. It was he who secured  prosperity for Fraserburgh, and Banff, and many other less important  centres; while even Dundee and Aberdeen, the chief commercial cities of  the east coast, owe to him a large part of their present extraordinary  wealth and industry. When one thinks how large a number of human beings  have been benefited by Telford's Scotch harbour works alone, it is  impossible not to envy a great engineer his almost unlimited power of  permanent usefulness to unborn thousands of his fellow-creatures.    
As a canal-maker, Telford was hardly less successful than as a  constructor of roads and harbours. It is true, his greatest work in this  direction was in one sense a failure. He was employed by Government for  many years as the engineer of the Caledonian Canal, which runs up the  Great Glen of Caledonia, connecting the line of lakes whose basins  occupy that deep hollow in the Highland ranges, and so avoiding the  difficult and dangerous sea voyage round the stormy northern capes of  Caithness. Unfortunately, though the canal as an engineering work proved  to be of the most successful character, it has never succeeded as a  commercial undertaking. It was built just at the exact moment when  steamboats were on the point of revolutionizing ocean traffic; and so,  though in itself a magnificent and lordly undertaking, it failed to  satisfy the sanguine hopes of its projectors. But though Telford felt  most bitterly the unavoidable ill success of this great scheme, he might  well have comforted himself by the good results of his canal-building  elsewhere. He went to Sweden to lay out the Gotha Canal, which still  forms the main high-road of commerce between Stockholm and the sea;  while in England itself some of his works in this direction--such as the  improvements on the Birmingham Canal, with its immense tunnel--may  fairly be considered as the direct precursors of the great railway  efforts of the succeeding generation.    
The most remarkable of all Telford's designs, however, and the one which  most immediately paved the way for the railway system, was his  magnificent Holyhead Road. This wonderful highway he carried through the  very midst of the Welsh mountains, at a comparatively level height for  its whole distance, in order to form a main road from London to Ireland.  On this road occurs Telford's masterpiece of engineering, the Menai  suspension bridge, long regarded as one of the wonders of the world, and  still one of the most beautiful suspension bridges in all Europe. Hardly  less admirable, however, in its own way is the other suspension bridge  which he erected at Conway, to carry his road across the mouth of the  estuary, beside the grey old castle, with which its charming design  harmonizes so well. Even now it is impossible to drive or walk along  this famous and picturesque highway without being struck at every turn  by the splendid engineering triumphs which it displays throughout its  entire length. The contrast, indeed, between the noble grandeur of  Telford's bridges, and the works on the neighbouring railways, is by no  means flattering in every respect to our too exclusively practical  modern civilization.    
Telford was now growing an old man. The Menai bridge was begun in 1819  and finished in 1826, when he was sixty-eight years of age; and though  he still continued to practise his profession, and to design many  valuable bridges, drainage cuts, and other small jobs, that great  undertaking was the last masterpiece of his long and useful life. His  later days were passed in deserved honour and comparative opulence; for  though never an avaricious man, and always anxious to rate his services  at their lowest worth, he had gathered together a considerable fortune  by the way, almost without seeking it. To the last, his happy cheerful  disposition enabled him to go on labouring at the numerous schemes by  which he hoped to benefit the world of workers; and so much cheerfulness  was surely well earned by a man who could himself look back upon so good  a record of work done for the welfare of humanity. At last, on the 2nd  of September, 1834, his quiet and valuable life came gently to a close,  in the seventy-eighth year of his age. He was buried in Westminster  Abbey, and few of the men who sleep within that great national temple  more richly deserve the honour than the Westerkirk shepherd-boy. For  Thomas Telford's life was not merely one of worldly success; it was  still more pre-eminently one of noble ends and public usefulness. Many  working men have raised themselves by their own exertions to a position  of wealth and dignity far surpassing his; few indeed have conferred so  many benefits upon untold thousands of their fellow-men. It is  impossible, even now, to travel in any part of England, Wales, or  Scotland, without coming across innumerable memorials of Telford's great  and useful life; impossible to read the full record of his labours  without finding that numberless structures we have long admired for  their beauty or utility, owe their origin to the honourable, upright,  hardworking, thoroughgoing, journeyman mason of the quiet little Eskdale  village.
