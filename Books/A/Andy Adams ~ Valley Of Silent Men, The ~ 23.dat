  An hour later the fighting forces in his body dragged Kent back   into existence. He opened his eyes. The shock of what had happened   did not at once fall upon him. His first sensation was of  awakening  from a sleep that had been filled with pain and horror. 
  Then he saw a black rock wall opposite him; he heard the sullen   roar of the stream; his eyes fell upon a vivid patch of light   reflected from the setting sun. He dragged himself up until he was  on  his knees, and all at once a thing that was like an iron hoop&#8212;   choking his senses&#8212;seemed to break in his head, and he staggered  to  his feet, crying out Marette's name. Understanding inundated  him with  its horror, deadening his tongue after that first cry,  filling his  throat with a moaning, sobbing agony. Marette was  gone. She was lost.  She was dead. 
  Swiftly, as reason came, his eyes took in his environment. For a   quarter of a mile above him he could see the white spume between  the  chasm walls, darkening with the approach of night. He could  hear more  clearly the roar of the death-floods. But close to him  was smooth  water, and he stood now on a shelving tongue of rock  and shale, upon  which the current had flung him. In front of him  was a rock wall.  Behind him was another. There was no footing  except where he stood.  And Marette was not with him. 
  Only the truth could batter at his brain as he stood there. But   his physical self refused to accept that truth. If he had lived,  she  must live! She was there&#8212;somewhere&#8212;along the shore&#8212;among  the  rocks&#8212; 
  The moaning in his throat gave way to the voicing of her name. He   shouted, and listened. He swayed back along the tongue of rock to  the  boulder-strewn edge of the chasm wall. A hundred yards farther  on was  the opening of the Chute. He came out of this, his clothes  torn from  him, his body bleeding, unrecognizable, half a madman,&#8212;  shouting her  name more and more loudly. The glow of the setting  sun struck him at  last. He was out from between the chasm walls,  and it lighted up the  green world for him. Ahead of him the river  widened and swept on in  tranquil quiet. 
  And now it was no longer fear that possessed him. It was the   horrible, overwhelming certainty of the thing. The years fell from   him, and he sobbed&#8212;sobbed like a boy stricken by some great  childish  grief, as he searched along the edge of the shore. Over  and over again  he cried and whispered Marette's name. 
  But he did not shout it again, for he knew that she was dead. She   was gone from him forever. Yet he did not cease to search. The  last  of the sun went out. Twilight came, and then darkness. Even  in that  darkness he continued to search for a mile below the  Chute, calling  her name more loudly now, and listening always for  the answer which he  knew would never come. The moon came out after  a time, and hour after  hour he kept up his hopeless quest. He did  not know how badly the  rocks had battered and hurt him, and he  scarcely knew when it was that  exhaustion dropped him like a dead  man in his tracks. When dawn came,  it found him wandering away  from the river, and toward noon of that  day, he was found by Andre  Boileau, the old white-haired half-breed  who trapped on Burntwood  Creek. Andre was shocked at the sight of his  wounds and half  dragged and half carried him to his shack hidden away  in the  forest. 
  For six days thereafter Kent remained at old Andre's place, simply   because he had neither the strength nor the reason to move. Andre   wondered that there were no broken bones in him. But his head was   terribly hurt, and it was that hurt that for three days and three   nights made Kent hover with nerve-racking indecision between life  and  death. The fourth day reason came back to him, and Boileau fed  him  venison broth. The fifth day he stood up. The sixth he thanked  Andre,  and said that he was ready to go. 
  Andre outfitted him with old clothes, gave him a supply of food   and God's blessing. And Kent returned to the Chute, giving Andre  to  understand that his destination was Athabasca Landing. 
  Kent knew that it was not wise for him to return to the river. He   knew that it would have been better for him both in mind and body  had  be gone in the opposite direction. But he no longer had in him  the  desire to fight, even for himself. He followed the lines of  least  resistance, and these led him back to the scene of the  tragedy. His  grief, when he returned, was no longer the  heartbreaking agony of that  first night. It was a deep-seated,  consuming fire that had already  burned him out, heart and soul.  Even caution was dead in him. He  feared nothing, avoided nothing.  Had the police boat been at the  Chute, he would have revealed  himself without any thought of  self-preservation. A ray of hope  would have been precious medicine to  him. But there was no hope.  Marette was dead. Her tender body was  destroyed. And he was alone,  unfathomably and hopelessly alone. 
  And now, after he had reached the river again, something held him   there. From the head of the Chute to a bend in the river two miles   below, his feet wore a beaten trail. Three or four times a day he   would make the trip, and along the path he set a few snares in  which  he caught rabbits for food. Each night he made his bed in a  crevice  among the rocks at the foot of the Chute. At the end of a  week the old  Jim Kent was dead. Even O'Connor would not have  recognized him with  his shaggy growth of beard, his hollow eyes,  and the sunken cheeks  which the beard failed to hide. 
  And the fighting spirit in him also was dead. Once or twice there   leaped up in him a sudden passion demanding vengeance upon the   accursed Law that was accountable for the death of Marette, but  even  this flame snuffed itself out quickly. 
  And then, on the eighth day, he saw the edge of a thing that was   almost hidden under an overhanging bank. He fished it out. It was   Marette's little pack, and for many minutes before he opened it  Kent  crushed the sodden treasure to his breast, staring with half-  mad eyes  down where he had found it, as if Marette must be there,  too. Then he  ran with it to an open space, where the sun fell  warmly on a great,  flat rock that was level with the ground, and  with sobbing breath he  opened it. It was filled with the things  she had picked up quickly in  her room the night of their flight  from Kedsty's bungalow, and as he  drew them out one by one and  placed them in the sun on the rock, a new  and sudden rush of life  swept through his veins, and he sprang to his  feet and faced the  river again, as if at last a hope had come to him.  Then he looked  down again upon what she had treasured, and reaching  out his arms  to them, he whispered, 
  &quot;Marette&#8212;my little goddess&#8212;&quot; 
  Even in his grief the overwhelming mastery of his love for the one   who was dead brought a smile to his. haggard and bearded face. For   Marette, in filling her little pack on that night of hurried  flight,  had chosen strange things. On the sunlit rock, where he  had placed  them, were a pair of the little pumps which he had  fallen on his knees  to worship in her room, and with these she had  crowded into the pack  one of the billowing, sweet-smelling dresses  which had made his heart  stand still for a moment when he first  looked into their hiding-place.  It was no longer soft and cobwebby  as it had been then, like down  fluttering against his cheeks, but  sodden and discolored, as it lay on  the rock with little rivulets  of water running from it. 
  With the shoes and the dress were the intimate necessities which   Marette had taken with her. But it was one of the pumps that Kent   picked up and crushed close to his ragged breast&#8212;one of the two  she  had worn that first wonderful day she had come to see him at   Cardigan's place. 
  This hour was the beginning of another change in Kent. It seemed   to him that a message had come to him from Marette herself, that  the  spirit of her had returned to him and was with him now,  stirring  strange things in his soul and warming his blood with a  new heat. She  was gone forever, and yet she had come back to him,  and the truth grew  upon him that this spirit of her would never  leave him again as long  as he lived. He felt her nearness.  Unconsciously he reached out his  arms, and a strange happiness  entered Into him to battle with grief  and loneliness. His eyes  shone with a new glow as they looked at her  little belongings on  the sunlit rock. It was as if they were flesh and  blood of her, a  part of her heart and soul. They were the voice of her  faith in  him, her promise that she would be with him always. For the  first  time in many days Kent felt a new force within him, and he knew   that she was not quite gone, that he had something of her left to   fight for. 
  That night he made his bed for a last time in the crevice between   the rocks, and his treasure was gathered within the protecting  circle  of his arms as he slept. 
  The next day he struck out north and east. On the fifth day after   he left the country of Andre Boileau he traded his watch to a   half-breed for a cheap gun, ammunition, a blanket, flour, and a   cooking outfit. After that he had no hesitation in burying himself   still deeper into the forests. 
  A month later no one would have recognized Kent as the one-time   crack man of N Division. Bearded, ragged, long-haired, he wandered   with no other purpose than to be alone and to get still farther  away  from the river. Occasionally he talked with an Indian or a  half-breed.  Each night, though the weather was very warm, he made  himself a small  camp-fire, for it was always in these hours, with  the fire-light about  him, that he felt Marette was very near. It  was then that he took out  one by one the precious things that were  in Marette's little pack. He  worshipped these things. The dress  and each of the little shoes he had  wrapped in the velvety inner  bark of the birch tree. He protected them  from wet and storm. Had  emergency called for it, he would have fought  for them. They  became, after a time, more precious than his own life,  and in a  vague sort of way at first he began to thank God that the  river  had not robbed him of everything. 
  Kent's inclination was not to fight himself into forgetfulness. He   wanted to remember every act, every word, every treasured caress  that  chained him for all time to the love he had lost. Marette  became more  a part of him every day. Dead in the flesh, she was  always at his  side, nestling close in the shelter of his arms at  night, walking with  her hand in his during the day. And in this  belief his grief was  softened by the sweet and merciful comfort of  a possession of which  neither man nor fate could rob him&#8212;a  beloved Presence always with  him. 
  It was this Presence that rebuilt Kent. It urged him to throw up   his head again, to square his shoulders, to look life once more   straight in the face. It was both inspiration and courage to him  and  grew nearer and dearer to him as time passed. Early Autumn  found him  in the Fond du Lac country, two hundred miles east of  Fort Chippewyan.  That Winter he joined a Frenchman, and until  February they trapped  along the edges of the lower fingers of the  Barrens. 
  He came to think a great deal of Picard, his comrade. But he   revealed nothing of his secret to him, or of the new desire that  was  growing in him. And as the Winter lengthened this desire  became a deep  and abiding yearning. It was with him night and day.  He dreamed of it  when he slept, and it was never out of his  thoughts when awake. He  wanted to go HOME. And when he thought of  home, it was not of the  Landing, and not of the country south. For  him home meant only one  place in the world now&#8212;the place where  Marette had lived. Somewhere,  hidden in the mountains far north  and west, was that mysterious Valley  of Silent Men where they had  been going when her body died. And the  spirit of her wanted him to  go to it now. It was like a voice pleading  with him, urging him to  go, to live there always where she had lived.  He began to plan,  and in this planning he found new joy and new life.  He would find  her home, her people, the valley that was to have been  their  paradise. So late in February, with his share of the Winter  catch  in his pack, he said good-by to Picard and faced the River  again.
