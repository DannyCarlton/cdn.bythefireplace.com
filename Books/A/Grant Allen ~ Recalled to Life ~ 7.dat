I stopped for three weeks in Jane's lodgings; and before the end of  that time, Jane and I had got upon the most intimate footing. It was  partly her kindliness that endeared her to me, and her constant  sense of continuity with the earlier days which I had quite  forgotten; but it was partly too, I felt sure, a vague revival  within my own breast of a familiarity that had long ago subsisted  between us. I was coming to myself again, on one side of my nature.  Day by day I grew more certain that while facts had passed away from  me, appropriate emotions remained vaguely present. Among the  Woodbury people that I met, I recognised none to say that I knew  them; but I knew almost at first sight that I liked this one and  disliked that one. And in every case alike, when I talked the matter  over afterwards with Jane, she confirmed my suspicion that in my  First State I had liked or disliked just those persons respectively.  My brain was upset, but my heart remained precisely the same as  ever.    
On my second morning I went up to The Grange with her. The house was  still unlet. Since the day of the murder, nobody cared to live in  it. The garden and shrubbery had been sadly neglected: Jane took me  out of the way as we walked up the path, to show me the place where  the photographic apparatus had been found embedded in the grass, and  where the murderer had cut his hands getting over the wall in his  frantic agitation. The wall was pretty high and protected with  bottle-glass. I guessed he must have been tall to scramble over it.  That seemed to tell against Jane's crude idea that a woman might  have done it.    
But when I said so to Jane, she met me at once with the crushing  reply: "Perhaps it wasn't the same person that came back for the  box." I saw she was right again. I had jumped at a conclusion. In  cases like this, one must leave no hypothesis untried, jump at no  conclusions of any sort. Clearly, that woman ought to have been made  a detective.    
As I entered the house the weird sense of familiarity that pursued  me throughout rose to a very high pitch. I couldn't fairly say,  indeed, that I remembered the different rooms. All I could say with  certainty was that I had seen them before. To this there were three  exceptions--the three that belonged to my Second State--the library,  my bedroom, and the hall and staircase. The first was indelibly  printed on my memory as a component part of the Picture, and I found  my recollection of every object in the room almost startling in its  correctness. Only, there was an alcove on one side that I'd quite  forgotten, and I saw why most clearly. I stood with my back to it as  I looked at the Picture. The other two bits I remembered as the room  in which I had had my first great illness, and the passage down  which I had been carried or helped when I was taken to Aunt Emma's.    
I had begun to recognise now that the emotional impression made upon  me by people and things was the only sure guide I still possessed as  to their connection or association with my past history. And the  rooms at The Grange had each in this way some distinctive  characteristic. The library, of course, was the chief home of the  Horror which had hung upon my spirit even during the days when I  hardly knew in any intelligible sense the cause of it. But the  drawing-room and dining-room both produced upon my mind a vague  consciousness of constraint. I was dimly aware of being ill at ease  and uncomfortable in them. My own bedroom, on the contrary, gave me  a pleasant feeling of rest and freedom and security: while the  servants'-hall and the kitchen seemed perfect paradises of liberty.    
"Ah! many's the time, miss," Jane said with a sigh, looking over at  the empty grate, "you'd come down here to make cakes or puddings,  and laugh and joke like a child with Mary an' me. I often used to  say to Emily--her as was cook here before Ellen Smith,--'Miss Una's  never so happy as when she's down here in the kitchen.' And 'That's  true what you say,' says Emily to me, many a time and often."    
That was exactly the impression left upon my own mind. I began to  conclude, in a dim, formless way, that my father must have been a  somewhat stern and unsympathetic man; that I had felt constrained  and uncomfortable in his presence upstairs, and had often been  pleased to get away from his eye to the comparative liberty and ease  of my own room or of the maid-servants' quarters.    
At last, in the big attic that had once been the nursery, I paused  and looked at Jane. A queer sensation came over me.    
"Jane," I said slowly, hardly liking to frame the words, "there's  something strange about this room. He wasn't cruel to me, was he?"    
"Oh! no, miss," Jane answered promptly. "He wasn't never what you  might call exactly cruel. He was a very good father, and looked  after you well; but he was sort of stern and moody-like--would have  his own way, and didn't pay no attention to fads and fancies, he  called 'em. When you were little, many's the time he sent you up  here for punishment--disobedience and such like."    
I took out the photograph and tried, as it were, to think of my  father as alive and with his eyes open. I couldn't remember the  eyes. Jane told me they were blue; but I think what she said was the  sort of impression the face produced upon me. A man not unjust or  harsh in his dealings with myself, but very strong and masterful. A  man who would have his own way in spite of anybody. A father who  ruled his daughter as a vessel of his making, to be done as he would  with, and be moulded to his fashion.    
Still, my visit to The Grange resulted in the end in casting very  little light upon the problem before me. It pained and distressed me  greatly, but it brought no new elements of the case into view: at  best, it only familiarised me with the scene of action of the  tragedy. The presence of the alcove was the one fresh feature.  Nothing recalled to me as yet in any way the murderer's features. I  racked my brain in vain; no fresh image came up in it. I could  recollect nothing about the man or his antecedents.    
I almost began to doubt that I would ever succeed in reconstructing  my past, when even the sight of the home in which I had spent my  childish days suggested so few new thoughts or ideas to me.    
For a day or two after that I rested at Jane's, lest I should  disturb my brain too much. Then I called once more on the doctor who  had made the post mortem on my father, and given evidence at the  inquest, to see if anything he could say might recall my lapsed  memory.    
The moment he came into the room--a man about fifty, close-shaven  and kindly-looking--I recognised him at once, and held out my hand  to him frankly. He surveyed me from head to foot with a good medical  stare, and then wrung my hand in return with extraordinary warmth  and effusion. I could see at once he retained a most pleasing  recollection of my First State, and was really glad to see me.    
"What, you remember me then, Una!" he cried, with quite fatherly  delight. "You haven't forgotten me, my dear, as you've forgotten all  the rest, haven't you?"    
It was startling to be called by one's Christian name like that, and  by a complete stranger, too; but I was getting quite accustomed now  to these little incongruities.    
"Oh, yes; I remember you perfectly," I answered, half-grieved to  distress him, "though I shouldn't have known your name, and didn't  expect to see you. You're the doctor who attended me in my first  great illness--the illness with which my present life began--just  after the murder."    
He drew back, a little crestfallen.    
"Then that's all you recollect, is it?" he asked. "You don't  remember me before, dear? Not Dr. Marten, who used to take you on  his knee when you were a tiny little girl, and bring you lollipops  from town, to the great detriment of your digestion, and get into  rows with your poor father for indulging you and spoiling you? You  must surely remember me?"    
I shook my head slowly. I was sorry to disappoint him; but it was  necessary before all things to get at the bare truth.    
"I'm afraid not," I answered. "Do please forgive me! You must have  read in the papers, like everybody else, of the very great change  that has so long come over me. Bear in mind, I can't remember  anything at all that occurred before the murder. That first illness  is to me the earliest recollection of childhood."    
He gazed across at me compassionately.    
"My poor child," he said in a low voice, like a very affectionate  friend, "it's much better so. You have been mercifully spared a  great deal of pain. Una, when I first saw you at The Grange after  your father's death, I thanked heaven you had been so seized. I  thanked heaven the world had become suddenly a blank to you. I  prayed hard you might never recover your senses again, or at least  your memory. And now that you're slowly returned to life once more,  against all hope or fear, I'm heartily glad it's in this peculiar  way. I'm heartily glad all the past's blotted out for you. You can't  understand that, my child? Ah, no, very likely not. But I think it's  much best for you, all your first life should be wholly forgotten."  He paused for a second. Then he added slowly: "If you remembered it  all, the sense of the tragedy would be far more acute and poignant  even than at present."    
"Perhaps so," I said resolutely; "but not the sense of mystery. It's  <i>that</i> that appals me so! I'd rather know the truth than be so wrapped  up in the incomprehensible."    
He looked at me pityingly once more.    
"My poor child," he said, in the same gentle and fatherly voice,  "you don't wholly understand. It doesn't all come home to you. I can  see clearly, from what Inspector Wolferstan told me, after his visit  to you the other day--"    
I broke in, in surprise.    
"Inspector Wolferstan!" I cried. "Then he came down here to see you,  did he?"    
It was horrible to find how all my movements were discussed and  chronicled.    
"Yes, he came down here to see me and talk things over," Dr. Marten  went on, as calmly as if it were mere matter of course. "And I could  see from what he said you were still spared much. For instance, you  remember it all only as an event that happened to an old man with a  long white beard. You don't fully realise, except intellectually,  that it was your own father. You're saved, as a daughter, the misery  and horror of thinking and feeling it was your father who lay dead  there."    
"That's quite true," I answered. "I admit that I can't feel it all  as deeply as I ought. But none the less, I've come down here to make  a violent effort. Let it cost what it may, I must get at the truth.  I wanted to see whether the sight of The Grange and of Woodbury may  help me to recall the lost scenes in my memory."    
To my immense surprise, Dr. Marten rose from his seat, and standing  up before me in a perfect agony of what seemed like terror, half  mixed with affection, exclaimed in a very earnest and resolute  voice:    
"Oh, Una, my child, whatever you do--I beg of you--I implore  you--don't try to recall the past at all! Don't attempt it! Don't  dream of it!"    
"Why not?" I cried, astonished. "Surely it's my duty to try and find  out my father's murderer!"    
Instead of answering me, he looked about him for half a minute in  suspense, as if doubtful what next to do or to say. Then he walked  across with great deliberation to the door of the room, and locked  and double-locked it with furtive alarm, as I interpreted his  action.    
So terrified did he seem, indeed, that for a moment the idea  occurred to me in a very vague way--Was I talking with the murderer?  Had the man who himself committed the crime conducted the post  mortem, and put Justice off the scent? And was I now practically at  the mercy of the criminal I was trying to track down? The thought  for a second or two made me feel terribly uncomfortable. But I  glanced at his back and at his hands, and reassured myself. That  broad, short man was not the slim figure of my Picture and of the  photograph. Those large red hands were not the originals of the  small and delicate white palm just displayed at the back in both  those strange documents of the mysterious murder.    
The doctor came over again, and drew his chair close to mine.    
"Una, my child," he said slowly, "I love you very much, as if you  were my own daughter. I always loved you and admired you, and was  sorry--oh, so sorry!--for you. You've quite forgotten who I am; but  I've not forgotten you. Take what I say as coming from an old  friend, from one who loves you and has your interest at heart. For  heaven's sake, I implore you, my child, make no more inquiries. Try  to forget--not to remember. If you do recollect, you'll be sorry in  the end for it."    
"Why so?" I asked, amazed, yet somehow feeling in my heart I could  trust him implicitly. "Why should the knowledge of the true  circumstances of the case make me more unhappy than I am at  present?"    
He gazed harder at me than ever.    
"Because," he replied in slow tones, weighing each word as he spoke,  "you may find that the murder was committed by some person or  persons you love or once loved very much indeed. You may find it  will rend your very heart-strings to see that person or those  persons punished. You may find the circumstances were wholly  otherwise than you imagine them to be.... Let sleeping dogs lie, my  dear. Without your aid, nothing more can be done. Don't trouble  yourself to put the blood-hounds on the track of some unhappy  creature who might otherwise escape. Don't rake it all up afresh.  Bury it--bury it--bury it!"    
He spoke so earnestly that he filled me with vague alarm.    
"Dr. Marten," I said solemnly, "answer me just one question. Do you  know who was the murderer?"    
"No, no!" he exclaimed, starting once more. "Thank heaven, I can't  tell you that! I don't know. I know nothing. Nobody on earth knows  but the two who were present on the night of the murder, I feel  sure. And of those two, one's unknown, and the other has forgotten."    
"But you suspect who he is?" I put in, probing the secret curiously.    
He trembled visibly.    
"I suspect who he is," he replied, after a moment's hesitation. "But  I have never communicated, and will never communicate, my suspicions  to anybody, not even to you. I will only say this: the person whom I  suspect is one with whom you may now have forgotten all your past  relations, but whom you would be sorry to punish if you recovered  your memory. I formed a strong opinion at the time who that person  was. I formed it from the nature and disposition of the wound, and  the arrangement of the objects in the room when I was called in to  see your father's body."    
"And you never said so at the inquest!" I cried, indignant.    
He looked at me hard again. Then he spoke in a very slow and earnest  voice:    
"For your sake, Una, and for the sake of your affections, I held my  peace," he said. "My dear, the suspicion was but a very slender one:  I had nothing to go upon. And why should I have tried to destroy  your happiness?"    
That horrible article in the penny Society paper came back to my  mind once more with hideous suggestiveness. I turned to him almost  fiercely.    
"So far as you know, Dr. Marten," I asked, "was I ever in love? Had  I ever an admirer? Was I ever engaged to anyone?"    
He shrugged his shoulders and smiled a sort of smile of relief.    
"How should I know?" he answered. "Admirers?--yes, dozens of them;  I was one myself. Lovers?--who can say? But I advise you not to  push the inquiry further."    
I questioned him some minutes longer, but could get nothing more  from him. Then I rose to go.    
"Dr. Marten," I said firmly, "if I remember all, and if it wrings my  heart to remember, I tell you I will give up that man to justice all  the same! I think I know myself well enough to know this much at  least, that I never, never could stoop either to love or to screen a  man who could commit such a foul and dastardly crime as this one."    
He took my hand fervently, raised it with warmth to his lips and  kissed it twice over.    
"My dear," he said, with tears dropping down his gentle old cheeks,  "this is a very great mystery--a terrible mystery. But I know you  speak the truth. I can see you mean it. Therefore, all the more  earnestly do I beg and beseech you, go away from Woodbury at once,  and as long as you live think no more about it."
