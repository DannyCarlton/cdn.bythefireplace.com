  The next morning, when Aldous joined the engineer in the dining-room  below, he was disappointed to find the breakfast table prepared for two  instead of four. It was evident that Peggy Blackton and Joanne were not  going to interrupt their beauty nap on their account.
  Blackton saw his friend's inquiring look, and chuckled.
  &#8220;Guess we'll have to get along without 'em this morning, old man.  Lord bless me, did you hear them last night&#8212;after you went to bed?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;You were too far away,&#8221; chuckled Blackton again, &#8220;I was in the room  across the hall from them. You see, old man, Peggy sometimes gets  fairly starved for the right sort of company up here, and last night  they didn't go to bed until after twelve o'clock. I looked at my watch.  Mebby they were in bed, but I could hear 'em buzzing like two bees, and  every little while they'd giggle, and then go on buzzing again. By  George, there wasn't a break in it! When one let up the other'd begin,  and sometimes I guess they were both going at once. Consequently,  they're sleeping now.&#8221;
  When breakfast was finished Blackton looked at his watch.
  &#8220;Seven o'clock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We'll leave word for the girls to be  ready at nine. What are you going to do meantime, Aldous?&#8221;
  &#8220;Hunt up MacDonald, probably.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I'll run down and take a look at the work.&#8221;
  As they left the house the engineer nodded down the road. MacDonald  was coming.
  &#8220;He has saved you the trouble,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Remember, Aldous&#8212;nine  o'clock sharp!&#8221;
  A moment later Aldous was advancing to meet the old mountaineer.
  &#8220;They've gone, Johnny,&#8221; was Donald's first greeting.
  &#8220;Gone?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. The whole bunch&#8212;Quade, Culver Rann, DeBar, and the woman who  rode the bear. They've gone, hide and hair, and nobody seems to know  where.&#8221;
  Aldous was staring.
  &#8220;Also,&#8221; resumed old Donald slowly, &#8220;Culver Rann's outfit is  gone&#8212;twenty horses, including six saddles. An' likewise others have  gone, but I can't find out who.&#8221;
  &#8220;Gone!&#8221; repeated Aldous again.
  MacDonald nodded.
  &#8220;And that means&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;That Culver Rann ain't lost any time in gettin' under way for the  gold,&#8221; said Donald. &#8220;DeBar is with him, an' probably the woman.  Likewise three cut-throats to fill the other saddles. They've gone  prepared to fight.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Quade?&#8221;
  Old Donald hunched his shoulders, and suddenly John's face grew dark  and hard.
  &#8220;I understand,&#8221; he spoke, half under his breath. &#8220;Quade has  disappeared&#8212;but he isn't with Culver Rann. He wants us to believe he  has gone. He wants to throw us off our guard. But he's watching, and  waiting&#8212;somewhere&#8212;like a hawk, to swoop down on Joanne! He&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;That's it!&#8221; broke in MacDonald hoarsely. &#8220;That's it, Johnny! It's  his old trick&#8212;his old trick with women. There's a hunderd men who've  got to do his bidding&#8212;do it 'r get out of the mountains&#8212;an' we've got  to watch Joanne. We have, Johnny! If she should disappear&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  Aldous waited.
  &#8220;You'd never find her again, so 'elp me God, you wouldn't, Johnny!&#8221;  he finished.
  &#8220;We'll watch her,&#8221; said Aldous quietly. &#8220;I'll be with her to-day,  Mac, and to-night I'll come down to the camp in the coulee to compare  notes with you. They can't very well steal her out of Blackton's house  while I'm gone.&#8221;
  For an hour after MacDonald left him he walked about in the  neighbourhood of the Blackton bungalow smoking his pipe. Not until he  saw the contractor drive up in the buckboard did he return. Joanne and  Peggy were more than prompt. They were waiting. If such a thing were  possible Joanne was more radiantly lovely than the night before. To  Aldous she became more beautiful every time he looked at her. But this  morning he did not speak what was in his heart when, for a moment, he  held her hand, and looked into her eyes. Instead, he said:
  &#8220;Good morning, Ladygray. Have you used&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I have,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;Only it's Potterdam's Tar Soap, and not the  other. And you&#8212;have not shaved, John Aldous!&#8221;
  &#8220;Great Scott, so I haven't!&#8221; he exclaimed, rubbing his chin. &#8220;But I  did yesterday afternoon, Ladygray!&#8221;
  &#8220;And you will again this afternoon, if you please,&#8221; she commanded.  &#8220;I don't like bristles.&#8221;
  &#8220;But in the wilderness&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;One can shave as well as another can make curls,&#8221; she reminded him,  and there came an adorable little dimple at the corner of her mouth as  she looked toward Paul Blackton.
  Aldous was glad that Paul and Peggy Blackton did most of the talking  that morning. They spent half an hour where the explosion of the night  before had blown out the side of the mountain, and then drove on to  Coyote Number Twenty-eight. It was in the face of a sandstone cliff,  and all they could see of it when they got out of the wagon was a dark  hole in the wall of rock. Not a soul was about, and Blackton rubbed his  hands with satisfaction.
  &#8220;Everything is completed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gregg put in the last packing  this morning, and all we are waiting for now is four o'clock this  afternoon.&#8221;
  The hole in the mountain was perhaps four feet square. Ten feet in  front of it the engineer paused, and pointed to the ground. Up out of  the earth came two wires, which led away from the mouth of the cavern.
  &#8220;Those wires go down to the explosives,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;They're  battery wires half a mile long. But we don't attach the battery until  the final moment, as you saw last night. There might be an accident.&#8221;
  He bent his tall body and entered the mouth of the cavern, leading  his wife by the hand. Observing that Joanne had seen this attention on  the contractor's part, Aldous held out his own hand, and Joanne  accepted it. For perhaps twenty feet they followed the Blacktons with  lowered heads. They seemed to have entered a black, cold pit, sloping  slightly downward, and only faintly could they see Blackton when he  straightened.
  His voice came strange and sepulchral:
  &#8220;You can stand up now. We're in the chamber. Don't move or you might  stumble over something. There ought to be a lantern here.&#8221;
  He struck a match, and as he moved slowly toward a wall of  blackness, searching for the lantern, he called back encouragingly  through the gloom:
  &#8220;You folks are now standing right over ten tons of dynamite, and  there's another five tons of black powder&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  A little shriek from Peggy Blackton stopped him, and his match went  out.
  &#8220;What in heaven's name is the matter?&#8221; he asked anxiously.  &#8220;Peggy&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Why in heaven's name do you light a match then, with us standing  over all those tons of dynamite?&#8221; demanded Peggy. &#8220;Paul Blackton,  you're&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  The engineer's laughter was like a giant's roar in the cavern, and  Joanne gave a gasp, while Peggy shiveringly caught Aldous by the arm.
  &#8220;There&#8212;I've got the lantern!&#8221; exclaimed Blackton. &#8220;There isn't any  danger, not a bit. Wait a minute and I'll tell you all about it.&#8221; He  lighted the lantern, and in the glow of it Joanne's and Peggy's faces  were white and startled. &#8220;Why, bless my soul, I didn't mean to frighten  you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I was just telling you facts. See, we're standing on a  solid floor&#8212;four feet of packed rock and cement. The dynamite and  black powder are under that. We're in a chamber&#8212;a cave&#8212;an artificial  cavern. It's forty feet deep, twenty wide, and about seven high.&#8221;
  He held the lantern even with his shoulders and walked deeper into  the cavern as he spoke. The others followed. They passed a keg on which  was a half-burned candle. Close to the keg was an empty box. Beyond  these things the cavern was empty.
  &#8220;I thought it was full of powder and dynamite,&#8221; apologized Peggy.
  &#8220;You see, it's like this,&#8221; Blackton began. &#8220;We put the powder and  dynamite down there, and pack it over solid with rock and cement. If we  didn't leave this big air-chamber above it there would be only one  explosion, and probably two thirds of the explosive would not fire, and  would be lost. This chamber corrects that. You heard a dozen explosions  last night, and you'll hear a dozen this afternoon, and the biggest  explosion of all is usually the fourth or fifth. A 'coyote' isn't like  an ordinary blast or shot. It's a mighty expensive thing, and you see  it means a lot of work. Now, if some one were to touch off those  explosives at this minute&#8212;&#8212; What's the matter, Peggy? Are you cold?  You're shivering!&#8221;
  &#8220;Ye-e-e-e-s!&#8221; chattered Peggy.
  Aldous felt Joanne tugging at his hand.
  &#8220;Let's take Mrs. Blackton out,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I'm&#8212;I'm&#8212;afraid  she'll take cold!&#8221;
  In spite of himself Aldous could not restrain his laughter until  they had got through the tunnel. Out in the sunlight he looked at  Joanne, still holding her hand. She withdrew it, looking at him  accusingly.
  &#8220;Lord bless me!&#8221; exclaimed Blackton, who seemed to understand at  last. &#8220;There's no danger&#8212;not a bit!&#8221;
  &#8220;But I'd rather look at it from outside, Paul, dear,&#8221; said Mrs.  Blackton.
  &#8220;But&#8212;Peggy&#8212;if it went off now you'd be in just as bad shape out  here!&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think we'd be quite so messy, really I don't, dear,&#8221; she  persisted.
  &#8220;Lord bless me!&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;And they'd probably be able to find something of us,&#8221; she added.
  &#8220;Not a button, Peggy!&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I'm going to move, if you please!&#8221; And suiting her action to  the word Peggy led the way to the buckboard. There she paused and took  one of her husband's big hands fondly in both her own. &#8220;It's perfectly  wonderful, Paul&#8212;and I'm proud of you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;But, honestly, dear,  I can enjoy it so much better at four o'clock this afternoon.&#8221;
  Smiling, Blackton lifted her into the buckboard.
  &#8220;That's why I wish Paul had been a preacher or something like that,&#8221;  she confided to Joanne as they drove homeward. &#8220;I'm growing old just  thinking of him working over that horrid dynamite and powder all the  time. Every little while some one is blown into nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe,&#8221; said Joanne, &#8220;that I'd like to do something like that  if I were a man. I'd want to be a man, not that preachers aren't men,  Peggy, dear&#8212;but I'd want to do things, like blowing up mountains for  instance, or finding buried cities, or&#8221;&#8212;she whispered, very, very  softly under her breath&#8212;&#8220;writing books, John Aldous!&#8221;
  Only Aldous heard those last words, and Joanne gave a sharp little  cry; and when Peggy asked her what the matter was Joanne did not tell  her that John Aldous had almost broken her hand on the opposite  side&#8212;for Joanne was riding between the two.
  &#8220;It's lame for life,&#8221; she said to him half an hour later, when he  was bidding her good-bye, preparatory to accompanying Blackton down to  the working steel. &#8220;And I deserve it for trying to be kind to you. I  think some writers of books are&#8212;are perfectly intolerable!&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't you take a little walk with me right after dinner?&#8221; he was  asking for the twentieth time.
  &#8220;I doubt it very, very much.&#8221;
  &#8220;Please, Ladygray!&#8221;
  &#8220;I may possibly think about it.&#8221;
  With that she left him, and she did not look back as she and Peggy  Blackton went into the house. But as they drove away they saw two faces  at the window that overlooked the townward road, and two hands were  waving good-bye. Both could not be Peggy Blackton's hands.
  &#8220;Joanne and I are going for a walk this afternoon, Blackton,&#8221; said  Aldous, &#8220;and I just want to tell you not to worry if we're not back by  four o'clock. Don't wait for us. We may be watching the blow-up from  the top of some mountain.&#8221;
  Blackton chuckled.
  &#8220;Don't blame you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;From an observer's point of view, John,  it looks to me as though you were going to have something more than  hope to live on pretty soon!&#8221;
  &#8220;I&#8212;I hope so.&#8221;
  &#8220;And when I was going with Peggy I wouldn't have traded a quiet  little walk with her&#8212;like this you're suggesting&#8212;for a front seat  look at a blow-up of the whole Rocky Mountain system!&#8221;
  &#8220;And you won't forget to tell Mrs. Blackton that we may not return  by four o'clock?&#8221;
  &#8220;I will not. And&#8221;&#8212;Blackton puffed hard at his pipe&#8212;&#8220;and, John&#8212;the  Tete Jaune preacher is our nearest neighbour,&#8221; he finished.
  From then until dinner time John Aldous lived in an atmosphere that  was not quite real, but a little like a dream. His hopes and his  happiness were at their highest. He knew that Joanne would go walking  with him that afternoon, and in spite of his most serious efforts to  argue to the contrary he could not keep down the feeling that the event  would mean a great deal for him. Almost feverishly he interested  himself in Paul Blackton's work. When they returned to the bungalow, a  little before noon, he went to his room, shaved himself, and in other  ways prepared for dinner.
  Joanne and the Blacktons were waiting when he came down.
  His first look at Joanne assured him. She was dressed in a soft gray  walking-suit. Never had the preparation of a dinner seemed so slow to  him, and a dozen times he found himself inwardly swearing at Tom, the  Chinese cook. It was one o'clock before they sat down at the table and  it was two o'clock when they arose. It was a quarter after two when  Joanne and he left the bungalow.
  &#8220;Shall we wander up on the mountain?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It would be fine to  look down upon the explosion.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have noticed that in some things you are very observant,&#8221; said  Joanne, ignoring his question. &#8220;In the matter of curls, for instance,  you are unapproachable; in others you are&#8212;quite blind, John Aldous!&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked, bewildered.
  &#8220;I lost my scarf this morning, and you did not notice it. It is  quite an unusual scarf. I bought it in Cairo, and I don't want to have  it blown up.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. I must have dropped it in the cavern. I had it when we  entered.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll return for it,&#8221; he volunteered. &#8220;We'll still have plenty  of time to climb up the mountain before the explosion.&#8221;
  Twenty minutes later they came to the dark mouth of the tunnel.  There was no one in sight, and for a moment Aldous searched for matches  in his pocket.
  &#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I won't be gone two minutes.&#8221;
  He entered, and when he came to the chamber he struck a match. The  lantern was on the empty box. He lighted it, and began looking for the  scarf. Suddenly he heard a sound. He turned, and saw Joanne standing in  the glow of the lantern.
  &#8220;Can you find it?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;I haven't&#8212;yet.&#8221;
  They bent over the rock floor, and in a moment Joanne gave a little  exclamation of pleasure as she caught up the scarf. In that same  moment, as they straightened and faced each other, John Aldous felt his  heart cease beating, and Joanne's face had gone as white as death. The  rock-walled chamber was atremble; they heard a sullen, distant roaring,  and as Aldous caught Joanne's hand and sprang toward the tunnel the  roar grew into a deafening crash, and a gale of wind rushed into their  faces, blowing out the lantern, and leaving them in darkness. The  mountain seemed crumbling about them, and above the sound of it rang  out a wild, despairing cry from Joanne's lips. For there was no longer  the brightness of sunshine at the end of the tunnel, but  darkness&#8212;utter darkness; and through that tunnel there came a deluge  of dust and rock that flung them back into the blackness of the pit,  and separated them.
  &#8220;John&#8212;John Aldous!&#8221;
  &#8220;I am here, Joanne! I will light the lantern!&#8221;
  His groping hands found the lantern. He relighted it, and Joanne  crept to his side, her face as white as the face of the dead. He held  the lantern above him, and together they stared at where the tunnel had  been. A mass of rock met their eyes. The tunnel was choked. And then,  slowly, each turned to the other; and each knew that the other  understood&#8212;for it was Death that whispered about them now in the  restless air of the rock-walled tomb, a terrible death, and their lips  spoke no words as their eyes met in that fearful and silent  understanding.
