   A young officer in dingy Confederate gray rode slowly on a powerful  bay  horse through a forest of oak.  It was a noble woodland, clear of   undergrowth, the fine trees standing in rows, like those of a park.   They were bare of leaves but the winter had been mild so far, and a   carpet of short grass, yet green, covered the ground.  To the rider's   right flowed a small river of clear water, one of the beautiful  streams  of the great Virginia valleys. 
  Harry Kenton threw his head back a little and drew deep breaths of  the  cool, crisp air.  The light wind had the touch of life in it.  As  the  cool puffs blew upon him and filled his lungs his chest expanded  and his  strong pulses beat more strongly.  But a boy in years, he had  already  done a man's work, and he had been through those deeps of  passion and  despair which war alone brings. 
  A year spent in the open and with few nights under roof had  enlarged  Harry Kenton's frame and had colored his face a deep red.   His great  ancestor, Henry Ware, had been very fair, and Harry, like  him, became  scarlet of cheek under the beat of wind and rain. 
  Had anyone with a discerning eye been there, to see, he would have  called  this youth one of the finest types of the South that rode forth  so boldly  to war.  He sat his saddle with the ease and grace that come  only of long  practice, and he controlled his horse with the slightest  touch of the  rein.  The open, frank face showed hate of nobody,  although the soul  behind it was devoted without any reserve to the  cause for which he  fought. 
  Harry was on scout duty.  Although an officer on the staff of  Colonel  Talbot, commander of the Invincibles, originally a South  Carolina  regiment, he had developed so much skill in forest and field,  he had such  acuteness of eye and ear, that he was sent often to seek  the camps of the  enemy or to discover his plans.  His friends said  that these forest  powers were inherited, that they came from some  far-away ancestor who had  spent his life in the wilderness, and Harry  knew that what they said was  true. 
  Despite the peaceful aspect of the forest and the lack of human  presence  save his own, he rode now on an errand that was full of  danger.  The  Union camp must lie on the other side of that little  river, not many  miles farther on, and he might meet, at any moment,  the pickets of the  foe.  He meant to take the uttermost risk, but he  had no notion of being  captured.  He would suffer anything, any  chance, rather than that.  He had lately come into contact with a man  who had breathed into him the  fire and spirit belonging to legendary  heroes.  To this man, short of  words and plain of dress, nothing was  impossible, and Harry caught from  him not merely the belief, but the  conviction also. 
  Late in the autumn the Invincibles, who had suffered severely at  Bull Run  and afterward had been cut down greatly in several small  actions in the  mountains, had been transferred to the command of  Stonewall Jackson in  the Shenandoah Valley.  Disease and the hospital  had reduced the regiment  to less than three hundred, but their spirits  were as high as ever.  Their ranks were renewed partly with Virginians.   Colonel Talbot and  Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire had recovered from  small wounds, and  St. Clair and Langdon were whole and as hard as  iron.  After a period of  waiting they were now longing for action. 
  There was some complaint among the Invincibles when they were  detached  from the main army to the service of Jackson, but Harry did  not share in  it.  When he heard of the order he remembered that dread  afternoon at  Bull Run, when all seemed lost, and the most vivid of his  memories was  the calm figure riding back and forth just beyond the  pines among which  he stood, and gathering for a fresh charge the stern  ranks of his men who  were to turn almost sure defeat into absolutely  sure victory.  The  picture of the man in the heart of that red glare  among the showers of  bullets had been burned so deeply into Harry's  memory that he could call  it up, almost as vivid as life itself at any  time.  Surely that was a  leader to follow, and he, at least, would  wish to ride where Stonewall  led. 
  But action did not come as soon as he had expected.  Jackson was  held by  commands from Richmond.  The great army of the South waited,  because the  great army of the North, under McClellan, also waited and  temporized  while the autumn was passing fast. 
  But Jackson, while held in the bonds of orders, did not sleep.  The  most  active youth of his command rode day and night toward the  northern end of  the valley, where the forces of the Union were  gathering.  The movements  of Banks and Kelly and the other Northern  commanders were watched  continually by keen eyes trained in the  southern forests.  Slim  striplings passed in the night through the  little towns, and the people,  intensely loyal to the South, gave them  the news of everything. 
  Harry had seen the whole autumn pass and winter come, and the war,   save for a fitful skirmish now and then, stood at a pause in the  valley.  Yet he rode incessantly, both with the others and alone, on  scouting  duty.  He knew every square mile of the country over a wide  range,  and he had passed whole nights in the forest, when hail or snow  was  whistling by.  But these had been few.  Mostly mild winds blew and  the  hoofs of his horse fell on green turf. 
  Harry was intensely alert now.  He was far from his command, and he  knew  that he must see and hear everything or he would soon be in the  hands of  the enemy.  He rode on rather slowly, and amid continued  silence.  He saw on his left a white house with green shutters and a  portico.  But the shutters were closed tightly and no smoke rose from  the chimneys.  Although house and grounds showed no touch of harm, they  seemed to bear  the brand of desolation.  The owners had fled, knowing  that the sinister  march of war would pass here. 
  Harry's mood changed suddenly from gladness to depression.  The  desolate  house brought home to him the terrible nature of war.  It  meant  destruction, wounds and death, and they were all the worse  because it was  a nation divided against itself, people of the same  blood and the same  traditions fighting one another. 
  But youth cannot stay gloomy long, and his spirits presently flowed  back.  There was too much tang and life in that crisp wind from the  west for his  body to droop, and a lad could not be sad long, with  brilliant sunshine  around him and that shining little river before  him. 
  The thrill of high adventure shot up from his soul.  He had ceased  to  hate the Northern soldiers, if he had ever hated them at all.  Now  they  were merely brave opponents, with whom he contended, and success  demanded  of either skill, daring and energy to the utmost degree.  He  was resolved  not to fail in any of these qualities. 
  He left the desolate house a mile behind, and then the river curved  a  little.  The woods on the farther shore came down in dense masses to  the  edge of the stream, and despite the lack of foliage Harry could  not see  far into them.  The strong, inherited instincts leaped up.   His nostrils  expanded and a warning note was sounded somewhere in the  back of his  brain. 
  He turned his horse to the left and entered the forest on his own  side of  the river.  They were ancient trees that he rode among, with  many  drooping and twisted boughs, and he was concealed well, although  he could  yet see from his covert the river and the forest on the other  shore. 
  The song of a trumpet suddenly came from the deep woodland across  the  shining stream.  It was a musical song, mellow and triumphant on  every  key, and the forest and hills on either shore gave it back, soft  and  beautiful on its dying echoes.  It seemed to Harry that the volume  of  sound, rounded and full, must come from a trumpet of pure gold.  He  had  read the old romances of the Round Table, and for the moment his  head was  full of them.  Some knight in the thicket was sending forth a  challenge  to him. 
  But Harry gave no answering defiance.  Now the medieval glow was  gone,  and he was modern and watchful to the core.  He had felt  instinctively  that it was a trumpet of the foe, and the Northern  trumpets were not  likely to sing there in Virginia unless many  Northern horsemen rode  together. 
  Then he saw their arms glinting among the trees, the brilliant  beams of  the sun dancing on the polished steel of saber hilt and rifle  barrel.  A minute more, and three hundred Union horsemen emerged from  the forest  and rode, in beautiful order, down to the edge of the  stream. 
  Harry regarded them with an admiration which was touched by no  hate.  They were heavily built, strong young men, riding powerful  horses,  and it was easy for anyone to see that they had been drilled  long and  well.  Their clothes and arms were in perfect order, every  horse had been  tended as if it were to be entered in a ring for a  prize.  It was his  thought that they were not really enemies, but  worthy foes.  That ancient  spirit of the tournament, where men strove  for the sake of striving,  came to him again. 
  The Union horsemen rode along the edge of the stream a little  space,  and then plunged into a ford.  The water rose to their saddle  skirts,  but they preserved their even line and Harry still admired.   When all  were on his own shore the golden trumpet sang merrily again,  and they  turned the heads of their horses southward. 
  Harry rode deeper into the ancient wood.  They might throw out  scouts or  skirmishers and he had no mind to be taken.  It was his  belief that they  came from Romney, where a Northern army had gathered  in great force and  would eventually march toward Jackson at  Winchester.  But whatever their  errand, here was something for him to  watch, and he meant to know what  they intended. 
  The Northern troop, youths also, the average of their age not much  more  than twenty, rode briskly along the edge of the little river,  which was a  shining one for them, too, as well as Harry.  They knew  that no enemy in  force was near, and they did not suspect that a  single horseman followed,  keeping in the edge of the woods, his eyes  missing nothing that they did. 
  As for themselves, they were in the open now and the brilliant  sunshine  quickened their blood.  Some of them had been at Bull Run,  but the sting  of that day was going with time.  They were now in  powerful force at the  head of the great Virginia valleys, and they  would sweep down them with  such impact that nothing could stand before  them.  The trumpet sang its  mellow triumphant note again, and from  across a far range of hills came  its like, a low mellow note, faint,  almost an echo, but a certain reply.  It was the answer from another  troop of their men who rode on a parallel  line several miles away. 
  The lone lad in the edge of the forest heard the distant note also,   but he gave it no heed.  His eyes were always for the troop before  him.  He had already learned from Stonewall Jackson that you cannot do  two  things at once, but the one thing that you do you must do with all  your  might. 
  The troop presently left the river and entered the fields from  which the  crops had been reaped long since.  When the horsemen came to  a fence  twelve men dismounted and threw down enough panels for the  others to ride  through without breaking their formation.  Everything  was done with order  and precision.  Harry could not keep from  admiring.  It was not often  that he saw so early in the war troops who  were drilled so beautifully,  and who marched so well together. 
  Harry always kept on the far side of the fields, and as the fences  were  of rails with stakes and riders he was able by bending very low  in the  saddle to keep hidden behind them.  Nevertheless it was  delicate work.  He was sure that if seen he could escape to the forest  through the speed  of his horse.  But he did not want to be driven off.   He wished to follow  that troop to its ultimate destination. 
  Another mile or two and the Union force bore away to the right,  entering  the forest and following a road, where the men rode in files,  six  abreast.  They did not make much noise, beyond the steady beating  of the  hoofs, but they did not seem to seek concealment.  Harry made  the obvious  deduction that they thought themselves too far beyond the  range of the  Southern scouts to be noticed.  He felt a thrill of  satisfaction, because  he was there and he had seen them. 
  He rode in the forest parallel with the troop and at a distance of  about  four hundred yards.  There was scattered undergrowth, enough to  hide him,  but not enough to conceal those three hundred men who rode  in close files  along a well-used road. 
  Harry soon saw the forest thinning ahead of him and then the  trumpet sang  its mellow, golden note again.  From a point perhaps a  mile ahead came a  reply, also the musical call of the trumpet.  Not an  echo, but the voice  of a second trumpet, and now Harry knew that  another force was coming to  join the first.  All his pulses began to  beat hard, not with nervousness,  but with intense eagerness to know  what was afoot.  Evidently it must be  something of importance or  strong bodies of Union cavalry would not be  meeting in the woods in  this manner. 
  After the reply neither trumpet sounded again, and the troop that  Harry  was following stopped while yet in the woods.  He rode his horse  behind a  tall and dense clump of bushes, where, well hidden, he could  yet see all  that might happen, and waited. 
  He heard in a few minutes the beat of many hoofs upon the hard  road,  advancing with the precision and regularity of trained cavalry.   He saw  the head of a column emerge upon the road and an officer ride  forward to  meet the commander of the first troop.  They exchanged a  few words and  then the united force rode southward through the open  woods, with the  watchful lad always hanging on their rear. 
  Harry judged that the new troop numbered about five hundred men,  and  eight hundred cavalry would not march on any mere scouting  expedition.  His opinion that this was a ride of importance now became  a conviction,  and he hardened his purpose to follow them to the end,  no matter what the  risk. 
  It was now about noon, and the sun became warm despite the December  day.  The turf softened under the rays and the Union cavalry left an  immense  wide trail through the forest.  It was impossible to miss it,  and Harry,  careful not to ride into an ambush of rear guard pickets,  dropped back a  little, and also kept slightly to the left of the great  trail.  He could  not see the soldiers now, but occasionally he heard  the deep sound of so  many hoofs sinking into the soft turf.  Beyond  that turfy sigh no sound  from the marching men came to him. 
  The Union troop halted about two o'clock in the afternoon, and the  men  ate cold food from the knapsacks.  They also rested a full hour,  and  Harry, watching from a distance, felt sure that their lack of  hurry  indicated a night attack of some kind.  They had altered their  course  slightly, twice, and when they started anew they did so a third  time. 
  Now their purpose occurred suddenly to Harry.  It came in a flash  of  intuition, and he did not again doubt it for a moment.  The head of  the  column was pointed straight toward a tiny village in which food  and  ammunition for Stonewall Jackson were stored.  The place did not  have  more than a dozen houses, but one of them was a huge tobacco barn  stuffed  with powder, lead, medicines, which were already worth their  weight in  gold in the Confederacy, and other invaluable supplies.  It  had been  planned to begin their removal on the morrow to the Southern  camp at  Winchester, but it would be too late unless he intervened. 
  If he did not intervene!  He, a boy, riding alone through the  forest,  to defeat the energies of so many men, equipped splendidly!   The  Confederacy was almost wholly agricultural, and was able to  produce few  such supplies of its own.  Nor could it obtain them in  great quantities  from Europe as the Northern navy was drawing its belt  of steel about the  Southern coasts.  That huge tobacco barn contained  a treasure beyond  price, and Harry was resolved to save it. 
  He did not yet know how he would save it, but he felt that he  would.  All the courage of those border ancestors who won every new day  of life  as the prize of skill and courage sprang up in him.  It was no  vain  heritage.  Happy chance must aid those who trusted, and, taking a  deep  curve to the left, he galloped through the woods.  His horse   comparatively fresh after easy riding, went many miles without showing   any signs of weariness. 
  The boy knew the country well, and it was the object of his circuit  to  take him ahead of the Union troop and to the village which held a  small  guard of perhaps two hundred men.  If the happy chance in which  he  trusted should fail him after all, these men could carry off a part  of  the supplies, and the rest could be destroyed to keep them from  falling  into Northern hands. 
  He gave his horse a little breathing space and then galloped harder  than  ever, reckoning that he would reach the village in another hour.   He  turned from the woods into one of the narrow roads between farms,  just  wide enough for wagons, and increased his speed. 
  The afternoon sun was declining, filling the west with dusky gold,   and Harry still rode at a great pace along the rough road, wondering  all  the while what would be the nature of the lucky chance, in which  he was  trusting so firmly.  Lower sank the sun and the broad band of  dusky gold  was narrowing before the advance of the twilight.  The  village was not  now more than two miles away, and the road dipped down  before him.  Sounds like that made by the force behind him, the rattle  of arms,  the creak of leather and the beat of hoofs, came suddenly to  his ears. 
  Harry halted abruptly and reined his horse into some bushes beside  the  road.  Then he heard the sounds more plainly.  They were made by  cavalry,  riding slowly.  The great pulses in his throat leaped in  quick alarm.  Was it possible that they had sent a portion of their  force swiftly by  another route, and that it was now between him and  the village? 
  He listened again and with every faculty strained.  The cavalrymen  were  riding toward him and they could not be a part of the Union  force.  Then they must be of his own South.  Surely this was the happy  chance of  which he had dreamed!  Again the great pulses leaped, but  with a  different emotion. 
  Scorning every risk, he reined his horse back into the road and  rode  straight forward.  The heads of men were just topping the rise,  and a few  moments later they and the horses they bestrode came into  full view.  It was a thankful thrill that shot through him now.  The  sun, almost sunk,  sent a last golden shower across them and disclosed  the dingy gray of  their uniforms and the lean, tanned faces. 
  Uttering a shout of joy and holding up a hand to show that he was a   friend, Harry galloped forward.  A young man at the head of the troop,   a captain by his uniform, and evidently the leader, gave the signal to   his men to stop, and received the boy who came alone. 
  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;I'm Harry Kenton, a lieutenant in the army of Stonewall Jackson,  and an  aide on the staff of Colonel Leonidas Talbot, colonel of the  regiment  known as the Invincibles.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've heard of that regiment.  South Carolinians at first, but now  mostly  Virginians.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The Virginians filled up the gaps that were made on the  battlefield.&#8221; 
  Harry spoke proudly, and the young captain smiled.  The boy  regarded him  with increasing interest.  Somehow he was reminded of Jeb  Stuart,  although this man was younger, not having passed his boyhood  long. 
  It was evident that he was tall.  Thick, yellow curls showed from  under  the edge of his cap.  His face, like Harry's, had turned red  before wind  and rain.  His dress was a marvel, made of the finest gray  without a spot  or stain.  A sash of light blue silk encircled his  waist, and the costly  gray cloak thrown back a little from his  shoulders revealed a silk lining  of the same delicate blue tint.  His  gauntlets were made of the finest  buckskin, and a gold-hilted small  sword swung from his sash. 
  &#8220;A dandy,&#8221; thought Harry, &#8220;but the bravest of the brave, for all  that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My name's Sherburne, Captain Philip Sherburne,&#8221; said the young  leader.  &#8220;I'm from the Valley of Virginia, and so are my men.  We  belong to  Stonewall Jackson's army, too, but we've been away most of  the time on  scouting duty.  That's the reason you don't know us.   We're going toward  Winchester, after another of our fruitless rides.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But it won't be fruitless this time!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, eagerly.   &#8220;A  Union force of nearly a thousand men is on its way to destroy the  stores  at the village, the stores that were to be moved to a safer  place  tomorrow!&#8221; 
  &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've seen 'em.  I was behind 'em at first and followed 'em for a  long  time before I guessed their purpose.  Then I curved about 'em,  galloped  through the woods, and rode on here, hoping for the lucky  chance that has  come with you.&#8221; 
  Harry, as he spoke, saw the eyes of the young captain leap and  flame,  and he knew he was in the presence of one of those knightly  souls,  thrown up so often in the war, most often by the border States.   They  were youths who rode forth to battle in the spirit of high  romance. 
  &#8220;You ask us to go back to the village and help defend the stores?&#8221;   said Philip Sherburne. 
  &#8220;That's just what I do ask&#8212;and expect.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course.  We'd have done it without the asking, and glad of it.   What a chance for us, as well as for you!&#8221; 
  He turned and faced his men.  The golden glow of the sun was gone  now,  but a silver tint from the twilight touched his face.  Harry saw  there  the blaze of the knightly spirit that craved adventure. 
  &#8220;Men,&#8221; he said in clear, happy tones, &#8220;we've ridden for days and  days in  quests that brought nothing.  Now the enemy is at hand, nearly  a thousand  strong, and means to destroy our stores.  There are two  hundred of you  and there are two hundred more guarding the stores.  If  there's a single  one among you who says he must ride on to Winchester,  let him hold up his  hand.&#8221; 
  Not a hand was raised, and the bold young captain laughed. 
  &#8220;I don't need to put the other side of the question,&#8221; he said to  Harry.  &#8220;They're as eager as I am to scorch the faces of the Yankees.&#8221; 
  The order was given to turn and ride.  The &#8220;men,&#8221; not one of whom  was  over twenty-five, obeyed it eagerly, and galloped for the village,   every heart throbbing with the desire for action.  They were all from  the  rich farms in the valleys.  Splendid horsemen, fine marksmen, and  alive  with youth and courage, no deed was too great for them.  Harry  was proud  to ride with them, and he told more of the story to  Sherburne as they  covered the short distance to the village. 
  &#8220;Old Jack would order us to do just what we're doing,&#8221; said  Sherburne.  &#8220;He wants his officers to obey orders, but he wants them to  think, too.&#8221; 
  Harry saw his eyes flash again, and something in his own mind  answered to  the spirit of adventure which burned so brightly in this  young man.  He looked over the troop, and as far as he could see the  faces of all  were flushed with the same hope.  He knew with sudden  certainty that the  Union forces would never take that warehouse and  its precious contents.  These were the very flower of that cavalry of  the South destined to  become so famous. 
  &#8220;You know the village?&#8221; said Sherburne to Harry. 
  &#8220;Yes, I passed there last night.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What defense has it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;About two hundred men.  They are strangers to the region, drawn  from the  Tidewater country, and I don't think they're as good as most  of General  Jackson's men.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Lack of discipline, you think?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, but the material is fine.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All right.  Then we'll see that they acquire discipline.  Nothing  like  the enemy's fire to teach men what war is.&#8221; 
  They were riding at good speed toward the village, while they  talked,  and Harry had become at once the friend and lieutenant of  young Captain  Sherburne.  His manner was so pleasant, so intimate, so  full of charm,  that he did not have the power or the will to resist  it. 
  They soon saw Hertford, a village so little that it was not able to  put  itself on the map.  It stood on the crest of a low hill, and the  tobacco  barn was about as large as all the other buildings combined.   The  twilight had now merged into night, but there was a bright sky  and plenty  of stars, and they saw well. 
  Captain Sherburne stopped his troop at a distance of three or four   hundred yards, while they were still under cover of the forest. 
  &#8220;What's the name of the commander there?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;McGee,&#8221; Harry replied.  &#8220;Means well, but rather obstinate.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's the way with most of these untrained men.  We mustn't risk  being  shot up by those whom we've come to help.  Lasley, give them a  call from  the bugle.  Make it low and soft though.  We don't want  those behind us  to hear it.&#8221; 
  Lasley, a boy no older than Harry, rode forward a dozen yards in  front of  the troop, put his bugle to his lips and blew a soft, warning  call.  Harry had been stirred by the first sound of a hostile trumpet  hours  before, and now this, the note of a friend, thrilled him again.   He gazed  intently at the village, knowing that the pickets would be  on watch,  and presently he saw men appear at the edge of the hill just  in front of  the great warehouse.  They were the pickets, beyond a  doubt, because the  silver starshine glinted along the blades of their  bayonets. 
  The bugler gave one more call.  It was a soft and pleasing sound.   It said very plainly that the one who blew and those with him were   friends.  Two men in uniform joined the pickets beside the warehouse,   and looked toward the point whence the note of the bugle came. 
  &#8220;Forward!&#8221; said Captain Philip Sherburne, himself leading the way,   Harry by his side.  The troops, wheeling back into the road and  marching  by fours in perfect order, rode straight toward the village. 
  &#8220;Who comes?&#8221; was the stern hail. 
  &#8220;A troop of Stonewall Jackson's cavalry to help you,&#8221; replied  Sherburne.  &#8220;You are about to be attacked by a Northern division eight  hundred  strong.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Who says so?&#8221; came the question in a tone tinged with unbelief,  and  Harry knew that it was the stubborn and dogmatic McGee who spoke. 
  &#8220;Lieutenant Harry Kenton of the Invincibles, one of Stonewall  Jackson's  best regiments, has seen them.  You know him; he was here  yesterday.&#8221; 
  As he spoke, Captain Sherburne sprang from his horse and pointed to  Harry. 
  &#8220;You remember me, Captain McGee,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;I stopped with you  a  minute yesterday.  I rode on a scouting expedition, and I have seen  the  Union force myself.  It outnumbers us at least two to one, but  we'll have  the advantage of the defense.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I know you,&#8221; said McGee, his heavy and strong, but not very   intelligent face, brightening a little.  &#8220;But it's a great  responsibility  I've got here.  We ought to have had more troops to  defend such valuable  stores.  I've got two hundred men, captain, and I  should say that you've  about the same.&#8221; 
  It was then that Captain Philip Sherburne showed his knightly  character,  speaking words that made Harry's admiration of him immense. 
  &#8220;I haven't any men, Captain McGee,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you have four  hundred,  and I'll help my commander as much as I can.&#8221; 
  McGee's eyes gleamed.  Harry saw that while not of alert mind he  was  nevertheless a gentleman. 
  &#8220;We work together, Captain Sherburne,&#8221; he said gratefully, &#8220;and I  thank  God you've come.  What splendid men you have!&#8221; 
  Captain Sherburne's eyes gleamed also.  This troop of his was his  pride,  and he sought always to keep it bright and sharp like a  polished sword  blade. 
  &#8220;Whatever you wish, Captain McGee.  But it will take us all to  repel the  enemy.  Kenton here, who saw them well, says they have a  fine,  disciplined force.&#8221; 
  The men now dismounted and led their horses to a little grove just  in the  rear of the warehouse, where they were tethered under the guard  of the  villagers, all red-hot partisans of the South.  Then the four  hundred men,  armed with rifles and carbines, disposed themselves about  the warehouse,  the bulk of them watching the road along which the  attacking force was  almost sure to come. 
  Harry took his place with Sherburne, and once more he was compelled  to  admire the young captain's tact and charm of manner.  He directed   everything by example and suggestion, but all the while he made the  heavy  Captain McGee think that he himself was doing it. 
  Sherburne and Harry walked down the road a little distance. 
  &#8220;Aren't you glad to be here, Kenton?&#8221; asked the captain in a  somewhat  whimsical tone. 
  &#8220;I'm glad to help, of course.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, but there's more.  When I came to war I came to fight.  And  if we  save the stores look how we'll stand in Old Jack's mind.  Lord,  Kenton,  but he's a queer man!  You'd never take any notice of him, if  you didn't  know who he was, but I'd rather have one flash of approval  from those  solemn eyes of his than whole dictionaries of praise from  all the other  generals I know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I saw him at Bull Run, when he saved the day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So did I.  The regiment that I was with didn't come up until near  the  close, but our baptism of battle was pretty thorough, all the  same.  Hark! did you think you heard anything, Kenton?&#8221; 
  Harry listened attentively. 
  &#8220;Yes, I hear something,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;It's very soft, but I should  say  that it's the distant beat of hoofs.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And of many hoofs.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I think.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then it's our friends of the North, coming to take what we want to  keep.  A few minutes more, Kenton, and they'll be here.&#8221; 
  They slipped back toward the warehouse, and Harry's heart began to  throb  heavily.  He knew that Sherburne's words would soon come true.
