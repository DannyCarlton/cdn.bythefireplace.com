  To be willing to work, and yet to be unable to find an opportunity,   was certainly a hardship. Herbert was a boy of active temperament,   and, even had he not needed the wages of labor, he would still have   felt it necessary to his happiness to do something. 
  In the course of his walks about the village, he stopped at the  house  of a carpenter, who bore the rather peculiar name of Jeremiah  Crane.  Mr. Crane owned about an acre and a half of land, which might  have  been cultivated, but at the time Herbert called, early in April,  there  were no indications of this intention. The carpenter was at work  in a  small shop just beyond the house, and there Herbert found him. 
  &#8220;Well, Herbert,&#8221; said Mr. Crane, in a friendly manner, &#8220;what are  you  up to nowadays?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nothing profitable, Mr. Crane; I am wandering about in search of   work.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Can't you find any?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not yet.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you been to Squire Leech?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should think he might find something for you to do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There is a little difficulty in the way.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; 
  Then Herbert told Mr. Crane about the squire's wish to purchase  their  cottage, and his vexation because they were not willing to sell. 
  &#8220;Seems to me that's unreasonable in the squire. He acts as if it  was  your duty to oblige him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know but we shall have to come to his terms,&#8221; said  Herbert,  rather dejectedly. &#8220;We certainly shall if I don't find  anything to  do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish I could help you; but, if you were to learn my trade, you   wouldn't be worth any wages for nigh a year, and you couldn't afford   to work so long without pay.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, I couldn't.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Besides, in a village like this, there isn't more than enough work   for one man. Why, there isn't more than one new house built a year. If   the squire wants to provide Mr. Banks with a house, why doesn't he   build him one? He might just as well as not.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It would cost him more than to buy our place at the price he  offers.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So it would. Your place must have cost fifteen hundred dollars,  land  and all.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I did, but the squire laughed at the idea. All he offers is  eleven  hundred.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't you sell at that price. It would be too much of a  sacrifice.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We won't unless we are obliged to.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope you won't be obliged to. A man as rich as Squire Leech  ought  not to try to get it under price.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose he wants to make a good bargain, no matter if it is at  our  expense. I wish you had a farm, Mr. Crane, so you could give me  work  on it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've got more farm now than I can take care of.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't you have a garden?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've got the land, but no time to work on it. My wife often wishes  we  had our own vegetables, instead of having to buy, but you see,  after  working in the shop, or outside, all day, I'm too tired to work  on  land.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How much land have you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;About an acre that I could cultivate, I suppose.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Engage me to take care of it. I'll do all the work, and your wife  can  have her own vegetables.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Really, I never thought of that,&#8221; said the carpenter. &#8220;I don't  know  but it might be a good idea. How much pay would you want?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll tell you,&#8221; said Herbert, who had a business turn, and who had   already matured the plan in his own mind. &#8220;If you will pay for   plowing, and provide seed, I will do the planting, and gather it when   harvest time comes, for one-third of the crop.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You mean, you will take your pay in vegetables?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Herbert, promptly. &#8220;If there is more than you need, I  can  sell the surplus. What do you say?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It strikes me as a fair offer, Herbert. Just wait a minute, and  I'll  go and ask my wife what she thinks of it.&#8221; 
  Mr. Crane went into the house, leaving Herbert in the shop. He   reappeared in five minutes. Herbert, to whom the plan seemed every   minute more desirable, awaited his report eagerly. 
  &#8220;My wife is all for your plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She says it is the only  way  she knows of likely to give her the fresh vegetables she wants.   Besides, she thinks well of you. So, it's a settled thing, if you say   so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I do say so,&#8221; Herbert replied, promptly. 
  &#8220;Now, when will you have it plowed?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shall leave all that to you. I haven't time to make  arrangements.  You can engage anybody you like to do the plowing, and I  will pay the  bill.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then, as to the seed?&#8221; 
  &#8220;There, again, I trust all to you. You can buy what you find to be   necessary, and the bill may be sent to me. You may ask Mrs. Crane what   vegetables she wants.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All right,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Please understand,&#8221; said the carpenter, &#8220;that I will do what I  have  said, but I don't want to be worried about the details. You are a  boy,  but I shall trust to your judgment, as you are interested in the   result.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Herbert, rather proud of the confidence reposed  in  him. &#8220;I will do what I can to justify your confidence. I'll go  right  off and see about the plowing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well.&#8221; 
  Whatever Herbert did was done promptly. He knew of a man named   Kimball, a farmer on a small scale, who was accustomed to do work for   neighbors, not having enough work of his own to occupy his whole time.   He went to see him at once. 
  &#8220;Mr. Kimball,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to know if I can engage you to do  some  plowing for me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;For you!&#8221; repeated the farmer, opening his eyes. &#8220;Why, you haven't   taken a farm, have you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Herbert, smiling; &#8220;but I've agreed to cultivate a   little land on shares.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Sho! you don't say so! What land is it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's the field behind Mr. Crane's house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So he's engaged you, has he? Well, I've often wondered why he  didn't  cultivate it. Might as well as not.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's my idea. I proposed it to him. Now, when can you come?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said the farmer, cautiously; &#8220;who's a-going to pay   me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mr. Crane. He told me to engage somebody, and he would pay the  bill.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's all right, then,&#8221; said the farmer, in a tone of  satisfaction;  &#8220;Crane's a man that always pays his bills.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope I shall have the same reputation,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I hope  you  will, but you're only a boy, you know, and I couldn't collect of a   minor. That's the law.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shouldn't think anybody'd be dishonest enough to bring that as  an  excuse.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Plenty would do it, so I have to be careful What time do you want  me  to do the work for you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;As soon as you can.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Let me see, I guess I can come to-morrow. There ain't anything  very  pressing for me to do then.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's good,&#8221; said Herbert, with satisfaction. &#8220;You'll find me  there,  and I can ride the horse to plow if you want me to.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should like to have you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, thought Herbert, as he started for home to tell his mother  what  he had done, &#8220;I've made a beginning.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose you haven't found any work yet, Herbert,&#8221; said his  mother,  in a tone of resignation, as he entered the little cottage. 
  &#8220;Yes, I have; though I shall have to wait some time for the pay.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is it, Herbert?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm going to cultivate a garden on shares, mother; so next fall  and  winter you can have all the vegetables you want.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How is that, Herbert? Tell me all about it.&#8221; 
  When Herbert had detailed the contract he had entered into, he was   glad to find that his mother approved of it. She declared that it   would be very satisfactory to her to have an abundant stock of   vegetables, but she said, doubtfully: &#8220;Do you think you know enough of   farming to attend to all the work?&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I don't I can easily ask some farmer,&#8221; said Herbert,  confidently.  &#8220;I am not in the least afraid to undertake the job.&#8221; 
  He went to bed that night feeling that at last he had obtained   something to do. 
  The reader will perhaps recall the statement in our first chapter  that  there was a little land connected with the cottage, which was  used for  the growth of vegetables. This, in fact, supplied nearly all  that was  required by the widow and her son, and the probability was  that  Herbert would be able to send to market nearly all his share of   vegetables obtained under his new contract, and thus obtain payment in   money, of which they were so much in need.
