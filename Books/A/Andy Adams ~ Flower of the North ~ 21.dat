  As Philip approached the cabin he saw a figure stealing away   through the gloom. His first thought was that he had returned a   minute too late to wreak his vengeance upon the gang-foreman in  his  own home, and he quickened his steps in pursuit. The man ahead  of him  was cutting direct for the camp supply-house, which was the  nightly  rendezvous of those who wished to play cards or exchange  camp gossip.  The supply-house, aglow with light, was not more than  two hundred  yards from Thorpe's, and Philip saw that if he dealt  out the justice  he contemplated he had not a moment to lose. He  began to run, so  quickly that he approached within a dozen paces  of the man he was  pursuing without being heard. It was not until  then that he made a  discovery which stopped him. The man ahead was  not Thorpe. Suddenly,  looking beyond him, he saw a second figure  pass slowly through the  lighted door of the supply-house. Even at  that distance he recognized  the gang-foreman. He thrust his  revolver under his coat and fell a  little farther behind the man  he had mistaken for Thorpe so that when  the latter passed within  the small circle of light that came from the  supply-house windows  he was fifty instead of a dozen paces away.  Something in the  other's manner, something strangely and potently  familiar in his  slim, lithe form, in the quick, half-running movement  of his body,  drew a sharp breath from Philip. He was on the point of  calling a  name, but it died on his lips. A moment more and the man  passed  through the door. Philip was certain that it was Pierre Couchee   who had followed Thorpe. 
  He was filled with a sudden fear as he ran toward the store. He   had scarcely crossed the threshold when a glance showed him Thorpe   leaning upon a narrow counter, and Pierre close beside him. He saw   that the half-breed was speaking, and Thorpe drew himself erect.   Then, as quick as a flash, two things happened. Thorpe's hand went  to  his belt, Pierre's sent a lightning gleam of steel back over  his  shoulder. The terrible drive of the knife and the explosion of   Thorpe's revolver came in the same instant. Thorpe crumpled back  over  the counter, clutching at his breast. Pierre turned about,  staggering,  and saw Philip. His eyes lighted up, and with a  moaning cry he  stretched out his arms as Philip sprang to him.  Above the sudden  tumult of men's feet and excited voices he gasped  out Jeanne's name.  Half a dozen men had crowded about them.  Through the ring burst  MacDougall, a revolver in his hand. Pierce  had become a dead weight in  Philip's arms. 
  &quot;Help me over to the cabin with him, Mac,&quot; he said. He looked   around among the men. It struck him as curious, even then, that he   saw none of Thorpe's gang. &quot;Is Thorpe done for?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;He's dead,&quot; replied some one. 
  With an effort Pierre opened his eyes. 
  &quot;Dead!&quot; he breathed, and in that one word there was a tremble of   joy and triumph. 
  &quot;Take Thorpe over to his cabin,&quot; commanded Philip, as he and   MacDougall lifted Pierre between them. &quot;I will answer for this  man.&quot; 
  They could hear Pierre's sobbing breath as they hurried across the   open. They laid him on Philip's bunk and Pierre opened his eyes   again. He looked at Philip. 
  &quot;M'sieur,&quot; he whispered, &quot;tell me&#8212;quick&#8212;if I must die!&quot; 
  MacDougall had studied medicine and surgery before engineering,   and took the place of camp physician. Philip drew back while he   ripped open the half-breed's garments and bared his breast. Then  he  darted to his bunk for the satchel in which he kept his  bandages and  medicines, throwing off his coat as he went. Philip  bent over Pierre.  Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's  right breast. Over his  heart Philip noticed a blood-stained  locket, fastened by a babiche  string about his neck. 
  Pierre's hands groped eagerly for Philip's. 
  &quot;M'sieur&#8212;you will tell me&#8212;if I must die?&quot; he pleaded. &quot;There are   things you must know&#8212;about Jeanne&#8212;if I go. It will not hurt. I  am  not afraid. You will tell me&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Philip. 
  He could scarcely speak, and while MacDougall was at work stood so   that Pierre could not see his face. There was a sobbing note in   Pierre's breath, and he knew what it meant. He had heard that same   sound more than once when he had shot moose and caribou through  the  lungs. Five minutes later MacDougall straightened himself. He  had done  all that he could. Philip followed him to the back part  of the room.  Almost without sound his lips framed the words, &quot;Will  he die?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said MacDougall. &quot;There is no hope. He may last until   morning.&quot; 
  Philip took a stool and sat down beside Pierre. There was no fear   in the wounded man's face. His eyes were clear. His voice was a   little stronger. 
  &quot;I will die, M'sieur,&quot; he said, calmly. 
  &quot;I am afraid so, Pierre.&quot; 
  Pierre's damp fingers closed about his own. His eyes shone softly,   and he smiled. 
  &quot;It is best,&quot; he said, &quot;and I am glad. I feel quite well. I will   live for some time?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps for a few hours, Pierre.&quot; 
  &quot;God is good to me,&quot; breathed Pierre, devoutly. &quot;I thank Him. Are   we alone?&quot; 
  &quot;Do you wish to be alone?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  Philip motioned to MacDougall, who went into the little office   room. 
  &quot;I will die,&quot; whispered Pierre, softly, as though he were   achieving a triumph. &quot;And everything would die with me, M'sieur,  if I  did not know that you love Jeanne, and that you will care for  her when  I am gone. M'sieur, I have told you that I love her. I  have worshiped  her, next to my God. I die happy, knowing that I am  dying for her. If  I had lived I would have suffered, for I love  alone. She does not  dream that my love is different from hers, for  I have never told her.  It would have given her pain. And you will  never let her know. As Our  Dear Lady is my witness, M'sieur, she  has loved but one man, and that  man is you.&quot; 
  Pierre gave a great breath. A warm flood seemed suddenly to engulf   Philip. Did he hear right? Could he believe? He fell upon his  knees  beside Pierre and brushed his dark hair back from his face. 
  &quot;Yes, I love her,&quot; he said, softly. &quot;But I did not know that she   loved me.&quot; 
  &quot;It is not strange,&quot; said Pierre, looking straight into his eyes.   &quot;But you will understand&#8212;now&#8212;M'sieur. I seem to have strength,  and  I will tell you all&#8212;from the beginning. Perhaps I have done  wrong.  You will know&#8212;soon. You remember Jeanne told you the story  of the  baby&#8212;of the woman frozen in the snow. That was the  beginning of the  long fight&#8212;for me. This&#8212;what I am about to tell  you&#8212;will be sacred  to you, M'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;As my life,&quot; said Philip. 
  Pierre was silent for a few moments. He seemed to be gathering his   thoughts, so that he could tell in few words the tragedy of years.   Two brilliant spots burned in his cheeks, and the hand which  Philip  held was hot. 
  &quot;Years ago&#8212;twenty, almost&#8212;there came a man to Fort o' God,&quot; he   began. &quot;He was very young, and from the south. D'Arcambal was then   middle-aged, but his wife was young and beautiful. Jeanne says  that  you saw her picture&#8212;against the wall. D'Arcambal worshiped  her. She  was his life. You understand what happened. The man from  the  south&#8212;the young wife&#8212;they went away together.&quot; 
  Pierre coughed. A bit of blood reddened his lips. Philip wiped it   away gently with his handkerchief, hiding the stain from Pierre's   eyes. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I understand.&quot; 
  &quot;It broke D'Arcambal's heart,&quot; resumed Pierre. &quot;He destroyed   everything that had belonged to the woman. He turned her picture  to  the wall. His love turned slowly to hate. It was two years  later that  I came over the barrens one night and found Jeanne and  her dead  mother. The woman, M'sieur&#8212;Jeanne's mother&#8212;was  D'Arcambal's wife.  She was returning to Fort o' God, and God's  justice overtook her  almost at its doors. I carried little Jeanne  to my Indian mother, and  then made ready to carry the woman to her  husband. It was then that a  terrible thought came to me. Jeanne  was not D'Arcambal's daughter. She  was a part of the man who had  stolen his wife. I worshiped the little  Jeanne even then, and for  her sake my mother and I swore secrecy, and  buried the woman. Then  we took the babe to Fort o' God as a stranger.  We saved her. We  saved D'Arcambal. No one ever knew.&quot; 
  Pierre stopped for breath. 
  &quot;Was it best?&quot; 
  &quot;It was glorious,&quot; said Philip, trembling. 
  &quot;It would have come out right&#8212;in the end&#8212;if the father had not   returned,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I must hurry, M'sieur, for it hurts me  now  to talk. He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to  Jeanne. He  told her everything. D'Arcambal was rich; Jeanne and I  both had money.  He threatened&#8212;we bought him off. We fought to  keep the terrible thing  from D'Arcambal. Our money sent him away  for a time. Then he returned.  It was news of him I brought up the  river to Jeanne&#8212;from Churchill. I  offered to kill him&#8212;but Jeanne  would not listen to that. But the  Great God willed that I should.  I killed him to-night&#8212;over there!&quot; 
  A great joy surged above the grief in Philip's heart. He could not   speak, but pressed Pierre's hand harder, and looked into his   glistening eyes. 
  Pierre's next words broke his silence, and wrung a low cry from   his lips. 
  &quot;M'sieur, this man Thorpe&#8212;Jeanne's father&#8212;is the man whom you   know as Lord Fitzhugh Lee.&quot; 
  He coughed violently, and with sudden fear Philip lifted his head   so that it rested against his shoulder. After a moment he lowered  it  again. His face was as white as Pierre's after that sudden fit  of  coughing. 
  &quot;I talked with him&#8212;alone&#8212;on the afternoon of the fight on the   rock,&quot; continued Pierre, huskily. &quot;He was hiding in the woods near   Churchill, and left for Fort o' God on that same day. I did not  tell  Jeanne&#8212;until after what happened, and I came up with you on  the  river. Thorpe was waiting for us at Fort o' God. It was he  whom Jeanne  saw that night beside the rock, but I could not tell  you the  truth&#8212;then. He came often after that&#8212;two, three times a  week. He  tortured Jeanne. My God! he taunted her, M'sieur, and  made her let him  kiss her, because he was her father. We gave him  money&#8212;all that we  could get; we promised him more, if he would  leave&#8212;five thousand  dollars&#8212;in three years. He agreed to go&#8212;  after he had finished his  work here. And that work&#8212;M'sieur&#8212;was  to destroy you. He told Jeanne,  because it made her fear him more.  He compelled her to come to his  cabin. He thought she was his  slave, that she would do anything to be  free of him. He told her  of his plot&#8212;how he had fooled you in the  sham fight with one of  his men&#8212;how those men were going to attack you  a little later,  and how he had intercepted your letter from Churchill  and sent in  its place the other letter which made your camp  defenseless. He  was not afraid of her. She was in his power, and he  laughed at her  horror, and tortured her as a cat will a bird. But  Jeanne&#8212;&quot; 
  A spasm of pain shot over Pierre's face. Fresh blood dyed his   lips, and a shiver ran through his body. 
  &quot;My God!&#8212;water&#8212;something&#8212;M'sieur,&quot; he gasped. &quot;I must go on!&quot; 
  Philip raised him again in his arms. He saw MacDougall's head   appear through the door. 
  &quot;You will rest easier this way, Pierre,&quot; he said. 
  After a few moments Pierre spoke in a gasping whisper. 
  &quot;You must understand. I must be quick,&quot; he said. &quot;We could not   warn you of what Jeanne had discovered. That would have revealed  her  father. D'Arcambal would have known&#8212;every one. Thorpe plans  to dress  his men&#8212;like Indians. They are to attack your camp to-  morrow night.  Ten days ago we went to the camp of old Sachigo, the  Cree, who loves  Jeanne as his own daughter. It was Jeanne's idea&#8212;  to save you. Jeanne  told him of Thorpe's plot to destroy you, and  to lay the blame on  Sachigo's people. Sachigo is out there&#8212;in the  mountains&#8212;hiding with  thirty of his tribe. Two days ago Jeanne  learned where her father's  men were hiding. We had planned  everything. To-morrow night&#8212;when they  move to attack&#8212;we were to  start a signal-fire on the big rock  mountain at the end of the  lake. Sachigo starts at the signal, and  lays in ambush for the  others in the ravine between the two mountains.  None of Thorpe's  men will come out alive. Sachigo and his people will  destroy them,  and none will ever know how it happened, for the Crees  keep their  secrets. But now&#8212;it is too late&#8212;for me. When it  happens&#8212;I will  be gone. The signal-pile is built&#8212;birch-bark&#8212;at the  very top of  the rock. Jeanne will wait for me out on the plain&#8212;and I  will  not come. You must fire the signal, M'sieur&#8212;as soon as it is   dark. None will ever know. Jeanne's father is dead. You will keep  the  secret&#8212;of her mother&#8212;always&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Forever,&quot; said Philip. 
  MacDougall came into the room, He brought a glass, partly filled   with a colored liquid, and placed it to Pierre's lips. Pierre   swallowed with an effort, and with a significant hunch of his   shoulders for Philip's eyes alone the engineer returned to the  little  room. 
  &quot;Mon Dieu, how it burns!&quot; said Pierre, as if to himself. &quot;May I   lie down again, M'sieur?&quot; 
  Philip lowered him gently. He made no effort to speak in these   moments. Pierre's eyes were dark and luminous as they sought his  own.  The draught he had taken gave him a passing strength. 
  &quot;I saw Thorpe again this afternoon,&quot; he said, more calmly.   &quot;D'Arcambal thought I had taken Jeanne to visit a trapper's wife  down  the Churchill. I saw Thorpe&#8212;alone. He had been drinking. He  laughed  at me, and said that Jeanne and I were fools&#8212;that he  would not leave  as he had said he would&#8212;but that he would remain  &#8212;always. I told  Jeanne, and asked her again to let me kill him.  But she said no&#8212;and I  had taken my oath to her. Jeanne saw him  again to-night. I was near  the cabin, and saw you. I told him I  would kill him if he did not go.  He laughed again, and struck me.  When I came to my feet he was half  across the open; I followed. I  forgot my oath. Rage filled my heart.  You know what happened. You  will tell Jeanne&#8212;so that she will  understand&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Can we not send for her?&quot; asked Philip. &quot;She must be near.&quot; 
  &quot;No, M'sieur,&quot; he replied, softly. &quot;It would only give her great   pain to see me&#8212;like this. She was to meet me to-night&#8212;at twelve   o'clock&#8212;on the trail where the road-bed crosses. You will meet  her  in my place. When she understands all that has happened you  may bring  her here, if she wishes to come. Then&#8212;to-morrow night&#8212;  you will go  together to fire the signal.&quot; 
  &quot;But Thorpe is dead,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Will they attack without him?&quot; 
  &quot;There is another, besides him,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;That is one secret   which Thorpe has kept from Jeanne&#8212;who the other is&#8212;the one who  is  paying to have you destroyed. Yes&#8212;they will attack.&quot; 
  Philip bent low over Pierre. 
  &quot;I have known of this plot for a long time, Pierre,&quot; he said,   tensely. &quot;I know that this Thorpe, who for some reason has passed  as  Lord Fitzhugh Lee, is but the agent of a more powerful force  behind  him. Have you told me all, Pierre? Do you know nothing  more?&quot; 
  &quot;Nothing, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;Was it Thorpe who attacked you on the cliff at Churchill?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I am sure that it was not he. If the attack had not failed&#8212;   it would have meant loss&#8212;for him. I have laid it to the ruffians  who  wanted to kill me&#8212;and secure Jeanne. You understand&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, but I do not believe that was the motive for the attack,   Pierre,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know. He was concealing himself in the forest.&quot; 
  A convulsive shudder ran through Pierre's body. He gave a low cry   of pain, and his hand clutched at the babiche cord which held the   locket about his neck. 
  &quot;M'sieur,&quot; he whispered, quickly, &quot;this locket&#8212;was on the little   Jeanne&#8212;when I found her in the snow. I kept it because it bears  the  woman's initials. I am foolish, M'sieur. I am weak. But I  would like  to have it buried with me&#8212;under the old tree&#8212;where  Jeanne's mother  lies. And if you could, M'sieur&#8212;if you only  could&#8212;place something of  Jeanne's in my hand&#8212;I would rest  easier.&quot; 
  Philip bowed his head in silence, while his eyes grew blinding   hot. Pierre pressed his hand. 
  &quot;She loves you&#8212;as I love her,&quot; he whispered, so low that Philip   could scarcely hear. &quot;You will love her&#8212;always. If you do not&#8212;  the  Great God will let the curse of Pierre Couchee fall upon you!&quot; 
  Choking back the great sobs that rose in his breast, Philip sank   upon his knees beside Pierre, and buried his face in his arms like  a  heartbroken boy. For several moments there was a silence,  punctuated  by the rasping breath of the wounded man. Suddenly this  sound ceased,  and Philip felt a cold fear leap through him. He  listened, neither  breathing nor lifting his head. In that interval  of pulseless quiet a  terrible cry came from Pierre's lips, and  when Philip looked up the  dying half-breed had struggled to a  sitting posture, blood staining  his lips again, his eyes blazing,  his white face damp with the clammy  touch of death, and was  staring through the cabin window. It was the  window that looked  out over the lake, toward the rock mountain half a  mile away.  Philip turned, horrified and wondering. Through the window  he saw  a glow in the sky&#8212;the glow of a fire, leaping up in a crimson   flood from the top of the mountain! 
  Again that terrible, moaning cry fell from Pierre's lips, and he   reached out his arms toward the signal that was blazing forth its   warning in the night. 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;Jeanne&#8212;&quot; he sobbed. &quot;My Jeanne&#8212;&quot; 
  He swayed, and fell back. His words came in choking gasps. 
  &quot;The signal!&quot; he struggled, fighting to make Philip understand   him. &quot;Jeanne&#8212;saw&#8212;Thorpe&#8212;to-night. He&#8212;must&#8212;changed&#8212;plans.   Attack&#8212;to-night. Jeanne&#8212;Jeanne&#8212;my Jeanne&#8212;has lighted&#8212;the   signal&#8212;fire!&quot; 
  A tremor ran through his body, and he lay still. MacDougall ran   across from the half-open door, and put his head to Pierre's  breast. 
  &quot;Is he dead?&quot; asked Philip. 
  &quot;Not yet.&quot; 
  &quot;Will he become conscious again?&quot; 
  &quot;Possibly.&quot; 
  Philip gripped MacDougall by the arm. 
  &quot;The attack is to be made to-night, Mac,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Warn the   men. Have them ready. But you&#8212;YOU, MacDougall, attend to this  man,  AND KEEP HIM ALIVE!&quot; 
  Without another word he ran to the door and out into the night.   The signal-fire was leaping to the sky. It lighted up the black  cap  of the mountain, and sent a thousand aurora fires flashing  across the  lake. And Philip, as he ran swiftly through the camp  toward the narrow  trail that led to that mountain-top, repeated  over and over again the  dying words of Pierre&#8212; 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;my Jeanne&#8212;my Jeanne&#8212;&quot;
