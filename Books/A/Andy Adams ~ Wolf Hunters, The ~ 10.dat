  To Rod the blazing pine seemed to be but a short distance away&#8212;a  mile, perhaps a little more. In the silence of the two Indians as they  contemplated the strange fire he read an ominous meaning. In Mukoki's  eyes was a dull sullen glare, not unlike that which fills the orbs of a  wild beast in a moment of deadly anger. Wabi's face was filled with an  eager flush, and three times, Rod observed, he turned eyes strangely  burning with some unnatural passion upon Mukoki.
  Slowly, even as the instincts of his race had aroused the latent,  brutish love of slaughter and the chase in the tamed wolf, the long  smothered instincts of these human children of the forest began to  betray themselves in their bronzed countenances. Rod watched, and he  was thrilled to the soul. Back at the old cabin they had declared war  upon the Woongas. Both Mukoki and Wabigoon had slipped the leashes that  had long restrained them from meting first vengeance upon their  enemies. Now the opportunity had come. For five minutes the great pine  blazed, and then died away until it was only a smoldering tower of  light. Still Mukoki gazed, speechless and grim, out into the distance  of the night. At last Wabi broke the silence.
  &#8220;How far away is it, Muky?&#8221;
  &#8220;T'ree mile,&#8221; answered the old warrior without hesitation.
  &#8220;We could make it in forty minutes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  Wabi turned to Rod.
  &#8220;You can find your way back to camp alone, can't you?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Not if you're going over there!&#8221; declared the white boy. &#8220;I'm going  with you.&#8221;
  Mukoki broke in upon them with a harsh disappointed laugh.
  &#8220;No go. No go over there.&#8221; He spoke with emphasis, and shook his  head. &#8220;We lose pine in five minutes. No find Woonga camp&#8212;make big  trail for Woongas to see in morning. Better wait. Follow um trail in  day, then shoot!&#8221;
  Rod found immense relief in the old Indian's decision. He did not  fear a fight; in fact, he was a little too anxious to meet the outlaws  who had stolen his gun, now that they had determined upon opening fire  on sight. But in this instance he was possessed of the cooler judgment  of his race. He believed that as yet the Woongas were not aware of  their presence in this region, and that there was still a large  possibility of the renegades traveling northward beyond their trapping  sphere. He hoped that this would be the case, in spite of his desire to  recapture his gun. A scrimmage with the Woongas just now would spoil  the plans he had made for discovering gold.
  The &#8220;Skeleton Mine,&#8221; as he had come to call it, now absorbed his  thoughts beyond everything else. He felt confident that he would  discover the lost treasure ground if given time, and he was just as  confident that if war was once begun between themselves and the Woongas  it would mean disaster or quick flight from the country. Even Wabi,  worked up more in battle enthusiasm than by gold fever, conceded that  if half of the Woongas were in this country they were much too powerful  for them to cope with successfully, especially as one of them was  without a rifle.
  It was therefore with inward exultation that Rod saw the project of  attack dropped and Mukoki and Wabigoon proceed with their short task of  scalping the seven wolves. During this operation Wolf was allowed to  feast upon the carcass of the buck.
  That night there was but little sleep in the old cabin. It was two  o'clock when the hunters arrived in camp and from that hour until  nearly four they sat about the hot stove making plans for the day that  was nearly at hand. Rod could but contrast the excitement that had now  taken possession of them with the tranquil joy with which they had  first taken up their abode in this dip in the hilltop. And how  different were their plans from those of two or three days ago! Not one  of them now but realized their peril. They were in an ideal hunting  range, but it was evidently very near, if not actually in, the Woonga  country. At any moment they might be forced to fight for their lives or  abandon their camp, and perhaps they would be compelled to do both.
  So the gathering about the stove was in reality a small council of  war. It was decided that the old cabin should immediately be put into a  condition of defense, with a loophole on each side, strong new bars at  the door, and with a thick barricade near at hand that could be quickly  fitted against the window in case of attack. Until the war-clouds  cleared away, if they cleared at all, the camp would be continually  guarded by one of the hunters, and with this garrison would be left  both of the heavy revolvers. At dawn or a little later Mukoki would set  out upon Wabi's trap-line, both to become acquainted with it and to  extend the line of traps, while later in the day the Indian youth would  follow Mukoki's line, visiting the houses already built and setting  other traps. This scheme left to Rod the first day's watch in camp.
  Mukoki aroused himself from his short sleep with the first approach  of dawn but did not awaken his tired companions until breakfast was  ready. When the meal was finished he seized his gun and signified his  intention of visiting the mink traps just beyond the hill before  leaving on his long day's trail. Rod at once joined him, leaving Wabi  to wash the dishes.
  They were shortly within view of the trap-houses near the creek.  Instinctively the eyes of both rested upon these houses and neither  gave very close attention to the country ahead or about them. As a  result both were exceedingly startled when they heard a huge snort and  a great crunching in the deep snow close beside them. From out of a  small growth of alders had dashed a big bull moose, who was now tearing  with the speed of a horse up the hillside toward the hidden camp,  evidently seeking the quick shelter of the dip.
  &#8220;Wait heem git top of hill!&#8221; shouted Mukoki, swinging his rifle to  his shoulder. &#8220;Wait!&#8221;
  It was a beautiful shot and Rod was tempted to ignore the old  Indian's advice. But he knew that there was some good reason for it, so  he held his trembling finger. Hardly had the animal's huge antlered  head risen to the sky-line when Mukoki shouted again, and the young  hunter pressed the trigger of his automatic gun three times in rapid  succession. It was a short shot, not more than two hundred yards, and  Mukoki fired but once just as the bull mounted the hilltop.
  The next instant the moose was gone and Rod was just about to dash  in pursuit when his companion caught him by the arm.
  &#8220;We got um!&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;He run downhill, then fall&#8212;ver' close to  camp. Ver' good scheme&#8212;wait heem git on top hill. No have to carry  meat far!&#8221;
  As coolly as though nothing had occurred the Indian turned again in  the direction of the traps. Rod stood as though he had been nailed to  the spot, his mouth half open in astonishment.
  &#8220;We go see traps,&#8221; urged Mukoki. &#8220;Find moose dead when we go back.&#8221;
  But Roderick Drew, who had hunted nothing larger than house rats in  his own city, was not the young man to see the logic of this reasoning,  and before Mukoki could open his mouth again he was hurrying up the  hill. On its summit he saw a huge torn-up blotch in the snow, spattered  with blood, where the moose had fallen first after the shots; and at  the foot of the hill, as the Indian had predicted, the great animal lay  dead.
  Wabi was hastening across the lake, attracted by the shots, and both  reached the slain bull at about the same time. Rod quickly perceived  that three shots had taken effect; one, which was undoubtedly Mukoki's  carefully directed ball, in a vital spot behind the fore leg, and two  through the body. The fact that two of his own shots had taken good  effect filled the white youth with enthusiasm, and he was still  gesticulating excitedly in describing the bull's flight to Wabi when  the old Indian came over the hill, grinning broadly, and holding up for  their inspection a magnificent mink.
  The day could not have begun more auspiciously for the hunters, and  by the time Mukoki was ready to leave upon his long trail the  adventurers were in buoyant spirits, the distressing fears of the  preceding night being somewhat dispelled by their present good fortune  and the glorious day which now broke in full splendor upon the  wilderness.
  Until their early dinner Wabi remained in camp, securing certain  parts of the moose and assisting Rod in putting the cabin into a state  of defense according to their previous plans. It was not yet noon when  he started over Mukoki's trap-line.
  Left to his own uninterrupted thoughts, Rod's mind was once more  absorbed in his scheme of exploring the mysterious chasm. He had  noticed during his inspection from the top of the ridge that the winter  snows had as yet fallen but little in the gloomy gulch between the  mountains, and he was eager to attempt his adventure before other snows  came or the fierce blizzards of December filled the chasm with drifts.  Later in the afternoon he brought forth the buckskin bag from a niche  in the log wall where it had been concealed, and one after another  carefully examined the golden nuggets. He found, as he had expected,  that they were worn to exceeding smoothness, and that every edge had  been dulled and rounded. Rod's favorite study in school had been a  minor branch of geology and mineralogy, and he knew that only running  water could work this smoothness. He was therefore confident that the  nuggets had been discovered in or on the edge of a running stream. And  that stream, he was sure, was the one in the chasm.
  But Rod's plans for an early investigation were doomed to  disappointment. Late that day both Mukoki and Wabi returned, the latter  with a red fox and another mink, the former with a fisher, which  reminded Rod of a dog just growing out of puppyhood, and another story  of strange trails that renewed their former apprehensions. The old  Indian had discovered the remnants of the burned jackpine, and about it  were the snow-shoe tracks of three Indians. One of these trails came  from the north and two from the west, which led him to believe that the  pine had been fired as a signal to call the two. At the very end of  their trap-line, which extended about four miles from camp, a single  snow-shoe trail had cut across at right angles, also swinging into the  north.
  These discoveries necessitated a new arrangement of the plans that  had been made the preceding night. Hereafter, it was agreed, only one  trap-line would be visited each day, and by two of the hunters in  company, both armed with rifles. Rod saw that this meant the  abandonment of his scheme for exploring the chasm, at least for the  present.
  Day after day now passed without evidences of new trails, and each  day added to the hopes of the adventurers that they were at last to be  left alone in the country. Never had Mukoki or Wabigoon been in a  better trapping ground, and every visit to their lines added to their  hoard of furs. If left unmolested it was plainly evident that they  would take a small fortune back to Wabinosh House with them early in  the spring. Besides many mink, several fisher, two red foxes and a  lynx, they added two fine &#8220;cross&#8221; foxes and three wolf scalps to their  treasure during the next three weeks. Rod began to think occasionally  of the joy their success would bring to the little home hundreds of  miles away, where he knew that the mother was waiting and praying for  him every day of her life; and there were times, too, when he found  himself counting the days that must still elapse before he returned to  Minnetaki and the Post.
  But at no time did he give up his determination to explore the  chasm. From the first Mukoki and Wabigoon had regarded this project  with little favor, declaring the impossibility of discovering gold  under snow, even though gold was there; so Rod waited and watched for  an opportunity to make the search alone, saying nothing about his  plans.
  On a beautiful day late in December, when the sun rose with dazzling  brightness, his opportunity came. Wabi was to remain in camp, and  Mukoki, who was again of the belief that they were safe from the  Woongas, was to follow one of the trap-lines alone. Supplying himself  well with food, taking Wabi's rifle, a double allowance of cartridges,  a knife, belt-ax, and a heavy blanket in his pack, Rod set out for the  chasm. Wabi laughed as he stood in the doorway to see him off.
  &#8220;Good luck to you, Rod; hope you find gold,&#8221; he cried gaily, waving  a final good-by with his hand.
  &#8220;If I don't return to-night don't you fellows worry about me,&#8221;  called back the youth. &#8220;If things look promising I may camp in the  chasm and take up the hunt again in the morning.&#8221;
  He now passed quickly to the second ridge, knowing from previous  experience that it would be impossible to make a descent into the gulch  from the first mountain. This range, a mile south of the camp, had not  been explored by the hunters, but Rod was sure that there was no danger  of losing himself as long as he followed along the edge of the chasm  which was in itself a constant and infallible guide. Much to his  disappointment he found that the southern walls of this mysterious  break between the mountains were as precipitous as those on the  opposite side, and for two hours he looked in vain for a place where he  might climb down. The country was now becoming densely wooded and he  was constantly encountering signs of big game. But he paid little  attention to these. Finally he came to a point where the forest swept  over and down the steep side of the mountain, and to his great joy he  saw that by strapping his snow-shoes to his back and making good use of  his hands it was possible for him to make a descent.
  Fifteen minutes later, breathless but triumphant, he stood at the  bottom of the chasm. On his right rose the strip of cedar forest; on  his left he was shut in by towering walls of black and shattered rock.  At his feet was the little stream which had played such an important  part in his golden dreams, frozen in places, and in others kept clear  of ice by the swiftness of its current. A little ahead of him was that  gloomy, sunless part of the chasm into which he had peered so often  from the top of the ridge on the north. As he advanced step by step  into its mysterious silence, his eyes alert, his nerves stretched to a  tension of the keenest expectancy, there crept over him a feeling that  he was invading that enchanted territory which, even at this moment,  might be guarded by the spirits of the two mortals who had died because  of the treasure it held.
  Narrower and narrower became the walls high over his head. Not a ray  of sunlight penetrated into the soundless gloom. Not a leaf shivered in  the still air. The creek gurgled and spattered among its rocks, without  the note of a bird or the chirp of a squirrel to interrupt its  monotony. Everything was dead. Now and then Rod could hear the wind  whispering over the top of the chasm. But not a breath of it came down  to him. Under his feet was only sufficient snow to deaden his own  footsteps, and he still carried his snow-shoes upon his back.
  Suddenly, from the thick gloom that hung under one of the cragged  walls, there came a thundering, unearthly sound that made him stop, his  rifle swung half to shoulder. He saw that he had disturbed a great owl,  and passed on. Now and then he paused beside the creek and took up  handful after handful of its pebbles, his heart beating high with hope  at every new gleam he caught among them, and never sinking to  disappointment though he found no gold. The gold was here&#8212;somewhere.  He was as certain of that as he was of the fact that he was living, and  searching for it. Everything assured him of that; the towering masses  of cleft rock, whole walls seeming about to crumble into ruin, the  broad margins of pebbles along the creek&#8212;everything, to the very  stillness and mystery in the air, spoke this as the abode of the  skeletons' secret.
  It was this inexplicable<I> something</I>&#8212;this unseen, mysterious  element hovering in the air that caused the white youth to advance step  by step, silently, cautiously, as though the slightest sound under his  feet might awaken the deadliest of enemies. And it was because of this  stealth in his progress that he came very close upon something that was  living, and without startling it. Less than fifty yards ahead of him he  saw an object moving slowly among the rocks. It was a fox. Even before  the animal had detected his presence he had aimed and fired.
  Thunderous echoes rose up about him. They rolled down the chasm,  volume upon volume, until in the ghostly gloom between the mountain  walls he stood and listened, a nervous shiver catching him once or  twice. Not until the last echo had died away did he approach where the  fox lay upon the snow. It was not red. It was not black. It was not&#8212;
  His heart gave a big excited thump. The bleeding creature at his  feet was the most beautiful animal he had ever seen&#8212;and the tip of its  thick black fur was silver gray.
  Then, in that lonely chasm, there went up a great human whoop of  joy.
  &#8220;A silver fox!&#8221;
  Rod spoke the words aloud. For five minutes he stood and looked upon  his prize. He held it up and stroked it, and from what Wabi and Mukoki  had told him he knew that the silken pelt of this creature was worth  more to them than all the furs at the camp together.
  He made no effort to skin it, but put the animal in his pack and  resumed his slow, noiseless exploration of the gulch.
  He had now passed beyond those points in the range from which he had  looked down into this narrow, shut-in world. Ever more wild and gloomy  became the chasm. At times the two walls of rock seemed almost to meet  far above his head; under gigantic, overhanging crags there lurked the  shadows of night. Fascinated by the grandeur and loneliness of the  scenes through which he was passing Rod forgot the travel of time. Mile  after mile he continued his tireless trail. He had no inclination to  eat. He stopped only once at the creek to drink. And when he looked at  his watch he was astonished to find that it was three o'clock in the  afternoon.
  It was now too late to think of returning to camp. Within an hour  the day gloom of the chasm would be thickening into that of night. So  Rod stopped at the first good camp site, threw off his pack, and  proceeded with the building of a cedar shelter. Not until this was  completed and a sufficient supply of wood for the night's fire was at  hand did he begin getting supper. He had brought a pail with him and  soon the appetizing odors of boiling coffee and broiling moose sirloin  filled the air.
  Night had fallen between the mountain walls by the time Rod sat down  to his meal.
