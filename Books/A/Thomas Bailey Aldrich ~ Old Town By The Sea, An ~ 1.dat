Thou singest by the gleaming isles,<br>  By woods, and fields of corn,<br>  Thou singest, and the sunlight smiles<br>  Upon my birthday morn.    
But I within a city, I,<br>  So full of vague unrest,<br>  Would almost give my life to lie<br>  An hour upon upon thy breast.    
To let the wherry listless go,<br>  And, wrapt in dreamy joy,<br>  Dip, and surge idly to and fro,<br>  Like the red harbor-buoy;    
To sit in happy indolence,<br>  To rest upon the oars,<br>  And catch the heavy earthy scents<br>  That blow from summer shores;    
To see the rounded sun go down,<br>  And with its parting fires<br>  Light up the windows of the town<br>  And burn the tapering spires;    
And then to hear the muffled tolls<br>  From steeples slim and white,<br>  And watch, among the Isles of Shoals,<br>  The Beacon's orange light.    
O River! flowing to the main<br>  Through woods, and fields of corn,<br>  Hear thou my longing and my pain<br>  This sunny birthday morn;    
And take this song which fancy shapes<br>  To music like thine own,<br>  And sing it to the cliffs and capes<br>  And crags where I am known!
