Hamilton for many months was far too busy with the reports he sent to  Congress in rapid succession, above all with the one concerning the  establishment of a National Bank, to be presented at the opening of the  next Session, and with the routine of business connected with his  department, to interfere in politics. He warned General Schuyler,  however, and hoped that the scandal connected with the State lands, in  which Burr was deeply implicated, would argue for the statesman in his  contest with a mere politician. But Burr, in common with the other  commissioners, was acquitted, although no satisfactory explanation of  their astounding transactions was given, and General Schuyler lost the  election as much through personal unpopularity as through the industry  of Burr and the determined efforts of the Livingstons. Schuyler, the  tenderest of men in his friendships, was as austere in his public manner  as in his virtues, and inflexible in demanding the respect due to his  rank and position. Of a broad intelligence, and a statesman of  respectable stature, he knew little of the business of politics and  cared less. He took his defeat with philosophy, regretting it more for  the animosity toward his son-in-law it betokened than because it removed  him temporarily from public life, and returned with his family to  Albany, Hamilton was annoyed and disgusted, and resolved to keep his eye  on Burr in the future. While he himself was in power the United States  should have no set-backs that he could prevent, and if Burr realized his  reading of his character he should manage to balk his ambitions if they  threatened the progress of the country. Kitty Livingston he did not see  again for many months, for her father died on July 25th. Hamilton heard  of William Livingston's death with deep regret, for Liberty Hall was  among the brightest of his memories; but events and emotions were  crowding in his life as they never had crowded before, and he had little  time for reminiscence.    
Congress adjourned on the 12th of August to meet in Philadelphia in  December. New York followed Washington to the ferry stairs upon the day  of his departure, weeping not only for that great man's loss, but for  the glory that went with him. "That vile Philadelphia," as Angelica  Church, in a letter to Betsey of consolatory lament, characterized the  city where Independence was born, was to be the capital of the Nation  once more, New York to console herself with her commerce and the  superior cleanliness of her streets. Those who could, followed the  "Court," and those who could not, travelled the weary distance over the  corduroy roads through the forests, and over swamps and rivers, as often  as circumstances would permit. Of the former was Mrs. Croix, whose  particular court protested it must have the solace of her presence in a  city to which few went willingly. Clinton heaped her with reproaches,  but she argued sweetly that he was outvoted, and that she should ever go  where duty called. "She felt politics to be her mission," and in truth  she enjoyed its intrigues, the double game she played, with all her  feminine soul. Hamilton would not help himself in her valuable  storehouse, but it pleased her to know that she held dangerous secrets  in her hands, could confound many an unwary politician. And she had her  methods, as we have seen, of springing upon Hamilton many a useful bit  of knowledge, and of assisting him in ways unsuspected of any. She  established herself in lodgings in Chestnut Street, not unlike those in  which she had spent so many happy hours for two years past, inasmuch as  they were situated on the first floor and communicated with a little  garden. Her removal was looked upon as quite natural, and so admirably  did she deport herself that even Mrs. Washington received her in time.    
Philadelphia was a larger city than New York, with wide ill-kept  streets, good pavements, and many fine houses and public buildings.  Chestnut Street was the great thoroughfare, shopping district, and  promenade. It was a city renowned for social activity and "crucifying  expenses." Naturally its press was as jubilant over the revival of its  ancient splendour as that of disappointed New York was scurrilous and  vindictive. When the latter was not caricaturing Robert Morris,  staggering off with the Administration on its back, or "Miss Assumption  and her bastard brats," its anti-Federal part was abusing Hamilton as  the arch-fiend who had sold the country, and applying to him every  adjective of vituperation that fury and coarseness could suggest. There  were poems, taunts, jibes, and squibs, printed as rapidly as the press  and ingenuity could turn them out. If our ancestors were capable of  appreciating the literary excellence of their pamphleteers, as many of  those who have replaced them to-day could not, it must be admitted that  we do not rage and hate so violently. The most hysteric effusions of our  yellow press, or the caustic utterances of our reputable newspapers, are  tame indeed before the daily cyclones of a time when everybody who did  not love his political neighbor hated him with a deadly virulence of  which we know little to-day. We may be improved, merely commercialized,  or more diffuse in our interests. In those days every man was a  politician first and himself after.    
The violence of party feeling engendered once more by the debates over  Hamilton's Report spread over the country like a prairie fire, and raged  until, in the North at least, it was met by the back fire of increasing  prosperity. As the summer waned farmers and merchants beheld the prices  of public securities going up, heard that in Holland the foreign loan  had gone above par, and that two hundred and seventy-eight thousand  dollars of the domestic debt had been purchased and cancelled at a cost  of one hundred and fifty thousand, saw trade reviving, felt their own  burdens lighten with the banishment of the State debt. To sing the  praises of the Assumption Bill was but a natural sequence, and from  thence to a constant panegyric of Hamilton. The anti-Federalist press  was drowned in the North by the jubilance of the Federal and its  increasing recruits, but in the South everything connected with the  Government in general and Hamilton in particular was unholy, and the  language in which the sentiment was expressed was unholier.    
Meanwhile, Hamilton was established in a little house in Philadelphia,  at work upon his second Report on the Public Credit, and elaborating his  argument in favour of a National Bank. Betsey had been more fortunate  than many in getting her house in order within a reasonable time, for  others were camping in two rooms while the carpenters hammered over the  rest of the neglected mansions. Washington arrived in November and took  possession of the stately home of Robert Morris, although he grumbled  that the stables would hold but twelve horses. It was a splendid  mansion, however, and filled not only with the fine collections of the  rich merchant, but with many beautiful works of art that the President  brought from Mount Vernon. Congress opened on the 6th of December.    
If Hamilton had given only an occasional half-amused, half-irritated  attention to the journalistic and pamphlet warfare in which he had been  the target, he now found a domestic engagement confronting him which  commanded his attentions and roused all the fighting Scotch blood in his  composition. Jefferson had done much and distressful thinking during the  summer recess. In the leisure of his extensive, not to say magnificent,  Virginia estates, and while entertaining the neighbouring aristocracy,  he had moved slowly to the conclusion that he approved of nothing in the  Administration, and that Hamilton was a danger to the Nation and a  colossus in his path. Assumption he held to be a measure of the very  devil, and fumed whenever he reflected upon his part in its  accomplishment. "I was made to hold a candle!" he would explain  apologetically. "He hoodwinked me, made a fool of me."    
For a statesman of forty-seven, and one of the most distinguished and  successful men in the country, the literary author of The Declaration of  Independence, the father of many beneficent and popular laws in his own  State, a minister to foreign courts and one of the deepest and subtlest  students of human nature of his century, to find himself fooled and  played with by a young man of thirty-three, relegated by him to a second  place in the Cabinet and country, means--meant in those days, at  least--hate of the most remorseless quality. Jefferson was like a  volcano with bowels of fire and a crater which spilled over in the  night. He smouldered and rumbled, a natural timidity preventing the  splendour of fireworks. But he was deadly.    
He and Madison met often during these holidays, and an object of their  growing confidence was James Monroe, the new Senator from Virginia.  Monroe was a fighter, and hatred of Hamilton was his religion. Moreover,  he disapproved with violence of every measure of the new government, and  everybody connected with it, from Washington down, Jefferson excepted;  Randolph he held to be a trimmer, and overlooked the fact that although  he himself had opposed the Constitution with all his words, he was one  of the first to take office under it. Jefferson needed but this younger  man's incentive to disapprove more profoundly not only assumption, but  Hamilton's design to establish a National Bank. That was the most  criminal evidence of an ultimate dash for a throne which the Secretary  of the Treasury, whose place in the Cabinet should have been second to  his own, but who was the very head and front of the Administration, had  yet betrayed. And as for the triumphal progress of Washington through  the States in the previous autumn, and again before leaving for Mount  Vernon upon the close of the last Congress, a king could have done no  more. The new Republic was tottering on its rotten foundations, and  Jefferson and his able lieutenants vowed themselves to the rescue.  Madison was the anti-government leader in the House, Monroe would abet  him in the Senate, and Jefferson would undertake the fight in the  Cabinet. It cannot be said that he liked the prospect, for he read his  fellow-beings too well to mistake the mettle of Hamilton. He was a  peaceable soul, except when in his study with pen in hand, but stem this  monarchical tide he would, and bury Hamilton under the dam.    
"We are three to one," he said reassuringly to his coadjutors. "He is  brilliant. I do not deny it. But against a triple power--"    
"He is worth any three men I ever knew," said Madison, drearily. "We  shall have to work harder than he will."    
Jefferson lifted his pen, and squinted thoughtfully at its point.  Monroe, who was the youngest of the trio, laughed aloud.    
And these were the forces of which Hamilton felt the shock shortly after  the convening of Congress.
