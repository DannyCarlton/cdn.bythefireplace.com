That the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by induction: the  contrary of health is disease, of courage, cowardice, and so on.  But the contrary of an evil is sometimes a good, sometimes an  evil. For defect, which is an evil, has excess for its contrary,  this also being an evil, and the mean. which is a good, is  equally the contrary of the one and of the other. It is only in a  few cases, however, that we see instances of this: in most, the  contrary of an evil is a good.    
In the case of contraries, it is not always necessary that if one  exists the other should also exist: for if all become healthy  there will be health and no disease, and again, if everything  turns white, there will be white, but no black. Again, since the  fact that Socrates is ill is the contrary of the fact that  Socrates is well, and two contrary conditions cannot both obtain  in one and the same individual at the same time, both these  contraries could not exist at once: for if that Socrates was well  was a fact, then that Socrates was ill could not possibly be one.    
It is plain that contrary attributes must needs be present in  subjects which belong to the same species or genus. Disease and  health require as their subject the body of an animal; white and  black require a body, without further qualification; justice and  injustice require as their subject the human soul.    
Moreover, it is necessary that pairs of contraries should in all  cases either belong to the same genus or belong to contrary  genera or be themselves genera. White and black belong to the  same genus, colour; justice and injustice, to contrary genera,  virtue and vice; while good and evil do not belong to genera, but  are themselves actual genera, with terms under them.
