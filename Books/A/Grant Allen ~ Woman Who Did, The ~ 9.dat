They were bound for Italy; so Alan had decided. Turning over in his  mind the pros and cons of the situation, he had wisely determined  that Herminia's confinement had better take place somewhere else  than in England. The difficulties and inconveniences which block  the way in English lodgings would have been well-nigh insufferable;  in Italy, people would only know that an English signora and her  husband had taken apartments for a month or two in some solemn old  palazzo. To Herminia, indeed, this expatriation at such a moment  was in many ways to the last degree distasteful; for her own part,  she hated the merest appearance of concealment, and would rather  have flaunted the open expression of her supreme moral faith before  the eyes of all London. But Alan pointed out to her the many  practical difficulties, amounting almost to impossibilities, which  beset such a course; and Herminia, though it was hateful to her thus  to yield to the immoral prejudices of a false social system, gave  way at last to Alan's repeated expression of the necessity for  prudent and practical action. She would go with him to Italy, she  said, as a proof of her affection and her confidence in his  judgment, though she still thought the right thing was to stand by  her guns fearlessly, and fight it out to the bitter end undismayed  in England.    
On the morning of their departure, Alan called to see his father,  and explain the situation. He felt some explanation was by this  time necessary. As yet no one in London knew anything officially  as to his relations with Herminia; and for Herminia's sake, Alan  had hitherto kept them perfectly private. But now, further  reticence was both useless and undesirable; he determined to make a  clean breast of the whole story to his father. It was early for a  barrister to be leaving town for the Easter vacation; and though  Alan had chambers of his own in Lincoln's Inn, where he lived by  himself, he was so often in and out of the house in Harley Street  that his absence from London would at once have attracted the  parental attention.    
Dr. Merrick was a model of the close-shaven clear-cut London  consultant. His shirt-front was as impeccable as his moral  character was spotless--in the way that Belgravia and Harley Street  still understood spotlessness. He was tall and straight, and  unbent by age; the professional poker which he had swallowed in  early life seemed to stand him in good stead after sixty years,  though his hair had whitened fast, and his brow was furrowed with  most deliberative wrinkles. So unapproachable he looked, that not  even his own sons dared speak frankly before him. His very smile  was restrained; he hardly permitted himself for a moment that weak  human relaxation.    
Alan called at Harley Street immediately after breakfast, just a  quarter of an hour before the time allotted to his father's first  patient. Dr. Merrick received him in the consulting-room with an  interrogative raising of those straight, thin eyebrows. The mere  look on his face disconcerted Alan. With an effort the son began  and explained his errand. His father settled himself down into his  ample and dignified professional chair--old oak round-backed,--and  with head half turned, and hands folded in front of him, seemed to  diagnose with rapt attention this singular form of psychological  malady. When Alan paused for a second between his halting  sentences and floundered about in search of a more delicate way of  gliding over the thin ice, his father eyed him closely with those  keen, gray orbs, and after a moment's hesitation put in a "Well,  continue," without the faintest sign of any human emotion. Alan,  thus driven to it, admitted awkwardly bit by bit that he was  leaving London before the end of term because he had managed to get  himself into delicate relations with a lady.    
Dr. Merrick twirled his thumbs, and in a colorless voice enquired,  without relaxing a muscle of his set face,    
"What sort of lady, please? A lady of the ballet?"    
"Oh, no!" Alan cried, giving a little start of horror. "Quite  different from that. A real lady."    
"They always <i>are</i> real ladies,--for the most part brought down by  untoward circumstances," his father responded coldly. "As a rule,  indeed, I observe, they're clergyman's daughters."    
"This one is," Alan answered, growing hot. "In point of fact, to  prevent your saying anything you might afterwards regret, I think  I'd better mention the lady's name. It's Miss Herminia Barton, the  Dean of Dunwich's daughter."    
His father drew a long breath. The corners of the clear-cut mouth  dropped down for a second, and the straight, thin eyebrows were  momentarily elevated. But he gave no other overt sign of dismay or  astonishment.    
"That makes a great difference, of course," he answered, after a  long pause. "She <i>is</i> a lady, I admit. And she's been to Girton."    
"She has," the son replied, scarcely knowing how to continue.    
Dr. Merrick twirled his thumbs once more, with outward calm, for a  minute or two. This was most inconvenient in a professional  family.    
"And I understand you to say," he went on in a pitiless voice,  "Miss Barton's state of health is such that you think it advisable  to remove her at once--for her confinement, to Italy?"    
"Exactly so," Alan answered, gulping down his discomfort.    
The father gazed at him long and steadily.    
"Well, I always knew you were a fool," he said at last with  paternal candor; "but I never yet knew you were quite such a fool  as this business shows you. You'll have to marry the girl now in  the end. Why the devil couldn't you marry her outright at first,  instead of seducing her?"    
"I did not seduce her," Alan answered stoutly. "No man on earth  could ever succeed in seducing that stainless woman."    
Dr. Merrick stared hard at him without changing his attitude on his  old oak chair. Was the boy going mad, or what the dickens did he  mean by it?    
"You <i>have</i> seduced her," he said slowly. "And she is <i>not</i> stainless  if she has allowed you to do so."    
"It is the innocence which survives experience that I value, not  the innocence which dies with it," Alan answered gravely.    
"I don't understand these delicate distinctions," Dr. Merrick  interposed with a polite sneer. "I gather from what you said just  now that the lady is shortly expecting her confinement; and as she  isn't married, you tell me, I naturally infer that <i>somebody</i> must  have seduced her--either you, or some other man."    
It was Alan's turn now to draw himself up very stiffly.    
"I beg your pardon," he answered; "you have no right to speak in  such a tone about a lady in Miss Barton's position. Miss Barton  has conscientious scruples about the marriage-tie, which in theory  I share with her; she was unwilling to enter into any relations  with me except in terms of perfect freedom."    
"I see," the old man went on with provoking calmness. "She  preferred, in fact, to be, not your wife, but your mistress."    
Alan rose indignantly. "Father," he said, with just wrath, "if you  insist upon discussing this matter with me in such a spirit, I must  refuse to stay here. I came to tell you the difficulty in which I  find myself, and to explain to you my position. If you won't let  me tell you in my own way, I must leave the house without having  laid the facts before you."    
The father spread his two palms in front of him with demonstrative  openness. "As you will," he answered. "my time is much engaged.  I expect a patient at a quarter past ten. You must be brief,  please."    
Alan made one more effort. In a very earnest voice, he began to  expound to his father Herminia's point of view. Dr. Merrick  listened for a second or two in calm impatience. Then he consulted  his watch. "Excuse me," he said. "I have just three minutes. Let  us get at once to the practical part--the therapeutics of the case,  omitting its aetiology: You're going to take the young lady to  Italy. When she gets there, will she marry you? And do you expect  me to help in providing for you both after this insane adventure?"    
Alan's face was red as fire. "She will <i>not</i> marry me when she gets  to Italy," he answered decisively. "And I don't want you to do  anything to provide for either of us."    
The father looked at him with the face he was wont to assume in  scanning the appearance of a confirmed monomaniac. "She will not  marry you," he answered slowly; "and you intend to go on living  with her in open concubinage! A lady of birth and position! Is  that your meaning?"    
"Father," Alan cried despairingly, "Herminia would not consent to  live with me on any other terms. To her it would be disgraceful,  shameful, a sin, a reproach, a dereliction of principle. She  <i>couldn't</i> go back upon her whole past life. She lives for nothing  else but the emancipation of women."    
"And you will aid and abet her in her folly?" the father asked,  looking up sharply at him. "You will persist in this evil course?  You will face the world and openly defy morality?"    
"I will not counsel the woman I most love and admire to purchase  her own ease by proving false to her convictions," Alan answered  stoutly.    
Dr. Merrick gazed at the watch on his table once more. Then he  rose and rang the bell. "Patient here?" he asked curtly. "Show  him in then at once. And, Napper, if Mr. Alan Merrick ever calls  again, will you tell him I'm out?--and your mistress as well, and  all the young ladies." He turned coldly to Alan. "I must guard  your mother and sisters at least," he said in a chilly voice, "from  the contamination of this woman's opinions."    
Alan bowed without a word, and left the room. He never again saw  the face of his father.
