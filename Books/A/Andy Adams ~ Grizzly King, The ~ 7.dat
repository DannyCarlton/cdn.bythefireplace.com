  The creek which Thor was following was a tributary of the Babine,  and he was headed pretty nearly straight for the Skeena. As he was  travelling upstream the country was becoming higher and rougher. He had  come perhaps seven or eight miles from the summit of the divide when he  found Muskwa. From this point the slopes began to assume a different  aspect. They were cut up by dark, narrow gullies, and broken by  enormous masses of rocks, jagged cuffs, and steep slides of shale. The  creek became noisier and more difficult to follow.
  Thor was now entering one of his strongholds: a region which  contained a thousand hiding-places, if he had wanted to hide; a wild,  uptorn country where it was not difficult for him to kill big game, and  where he was certain that the man-smell would not follow him.
  For half an hour after leaving the mass of rocks where he had  encountered Muskwa, Thor lumbered on as if utterly oblivious of the  fact that the cub was following. But he could hear him and smell him.
  Muskwa was having a hard time of it. His fat little body and his fat  little legs were unaccustomed to this sort of journeying, but he was a  game youngster, and only twice did he whimper in that half-hour&#8212;once  he toppled off a rock into the edge of the creek, and again when he  came down too hard on the porcupine quill in his foot.
  At last Thor abandoned the creek and turned up a deep ravine, which  he followed until he came to a dip, or plateau-like plain, halfway up a  broad slope. Here he found a rock on the sunny side of a grassy knoll,  and stopped. It may be that little Muskwa's babyish friendship, the  caress of his soft little red tongue at just the psychological moment,  and his perseverance in following Thor had all combined to touch a  responsive chord in the other's big brute heart, for after nosing about  restlessly for a few moments Thor stretched himself out beside the  rock. Not until then did the utterly exhausted little tan-faced cub lie  down, but when he did lie down he was so dead tired that he was sound  asleep in three minutes.
  Twice again during the early part of the afternoon the<I> sapoos  oowin</I> worked on Thor, and he began to feel hungry. It was not the  sort of hunger to be appeased by ants and grubs, or even gophers and  whistlers. It may be, too, that he guessed how nearly starved little  Muskwa was. The cub had not once opened his eyes, and he still lay in  his warm pool of sunshine when Thor made up his mind to go on.
  It was about three o'clock, a particularly quiet and drowsy part of  a late June or early July day in a northern mountain valley. The  whistlers had piped until they were tired, and lay squat out in the  sunshine on their rocks; the eagles soared so high above the peaks that  they were mere dots; the hawks, with meat-filled crops, had disappeared  into the timber; goat and sheep were lying down far up toward the  sky-line, and if there were any grazing animals near they were well fed  and napping.
  The mountain hunter knew that this was the hour when he should scan  the green slopes and the open places between the clumps of timber for  bears, and especially for flesh-eating bears.
  It was Thor's chief prospecting hour. Instinct told him that when  all other creatures were well fed and napping he could move more openly  and with less fear of detection. He could find his game, and watch it.  Occasionally he would kill a goat or a sheep or a caribou in broad  daylight, for over short distances he could run faster than either a  goat or a sheep, and as fast as a caribou. But chiefly he killed at  sunset or in the darkness of early evening.
  Thor rose from beside the rock with a prodigious whoof that roused  Muskwa. The cub got up, blinked at Thor and then at the sun, and shook  himself until he fell down.
  Thor eyed the black and tan mite a bit sourly. After the<I> sapoos  oowin</I> he was craving red, juicy flesh, just as a very hungry man  yearns for a thick porterhouse instead of lady fingers or mayonnaise  salad&#8212;flesh and plenty of it; and how he could hunt down and kill a  caribou with that half-starved but very much interested cub at his  heels puzzled him.
  Muskwa himself seemed to understand and answer the question. He ran  a dozen yards ahead of Thor, then stopped and looked back impudently,  his little ears perked forward, and with the look in his face of a  small boy proving to his father that he is perfectly qualified to go on  his first rabbit hunt.
  With another<I> whoof</I> Thor started along the slope in a spurt  that brought him up to Muskwa immediately, and with a sudden sweep of  his right paw he sent the cub rolling a dozen feet behind him, a manner  of speech that said plainly enough, &#8220;That's where you belong if you're  going hunting with me!&#8221;
  Then Thor lumbered slowly on, eyes and ears and nostrils keyed for  the hunt. He descended until he was not more than a hundred yards above  the creek, and he no longer sought out the easiest trail, but the rough  and broken places. He travelled slowly and in a zigzag fashion,  stealing cautiously around great masses of boulders, sniffing up each  coulee that he came to, and investigating the timber clumps and  windfalls.
  At one time he would be so high up that he was close to the bare  shale, and again so low down that he walked in the sand and gravel of  the creek. He caught many scents in the wind, but none that held or  deeply interested him. Once, up near the shale, he smelled goat; but he  never went above the shale for meat. Twice he smelled sheep, and late  in the afternoon he saw a big ram looking down on him from a  precipitous crag a hundred feet above.
  Lower down his nose touched the trails of porcupines, and often his  head hung over the footprints of caribou as he sniffed the air ahead.
  There were other bears in the valley, too. Mostly these had  travelled along the creek-bottom, showing they were blacks or  cinnamons. Once Thor struck the scent of another grizzly, and he  rumbled ill-humouredly.
  Not once in the two hours after they left the sunrock did Thor pay  any apparent attention to Muskwa, who was growing hungrier and weaker  as the day lengthened. No boy that ever lived was gamer than the little  tan-faced cub. In the rough places he stumbled and fell frequently; up  places that Thor could make in a single step he had to fight  desperately to make his way; three times Thor waded through the creek  and Muskwa half drowned himself in following; he was battered and  bruised and wet and his foot hurt him&#8212;but he followed. Sometimes he  was close to Thor, and at others he had to run to catch up. The sun was  setting when Thor at last found game, and Muskwa was almost dead.
  He did not know why Thor flattened his huge bulk suddenly alongside  a rock at the edge of a rough meadow, from which they could look down  into a small hollow. He wanted to whimper, but he was afraid. And if he  had ever wanted his mother at any time in his short life he wanted her  now. He could not understand why she had left him among the rocks and  had never come back; that tragedy Langdon and Bruce were to discover a  little later. And he could not understand why she did not come to him  now. This was just about his nursing hour before going to sleep for the  night, for he was a March cub, and, according to the most approved  mother-bear regulations, should have had milk for another month.
  He was what Metoosin, the Indian, would have called<I> munookow</I> &#8212;that is, he was very soft. Being a bear, his birth had not been like  that of other animals. His mother, like all mother-bears in a cold  country, had brought him into life a long time before she had finished  her winter nap in her den. He had come while she was asleep. For a  month or six weeks after that, while he was still blind and naked, she  had given him milk, while she herself neither ate nor drank nor saw the  light of day. At the end of those six weeks she had gone forth with him  from her den to seek the first mouthful of sustenance for herself. Not  more than another six weeks had passed since then, and Muskwa weighed  about twenty pounds&#8212;that is, he had weighed twenty pounds, but he was  emptier now than he had ever been in his life, and probably weighed a  little less.
  Three hundred yards below Thor was a clump of balsams, a small thick  patch that grew close to the edge of the miniature lake whose water  crept around the farther end of the hollow. In that clump there was a  caribou&#8212;perhaps two or three. Thor knew that as surely as though he  saw them. The<I> wenipow</I>, or &#8220;lying down,&#8221; smell of hoofed game was  as different from the<I> nechisoo</I>, or &#8220;grazing smell,&#8221; to Thor as  day from night. One hung elusively in the air, like the faint and  shifting breath of a passing woman's scented dress and hair; the other  came hot and heavy, close to the earth, like the odour of a broken  bottle of perfume.
  Even Muskwa now caught the scent as he crept up close behind the big  grizzly and lay down.
  For fully ten minutes Thor did not move. His eyes took in the  hollow, the edge of the lake, and the approach to the timber, and his  nose gauged the wind as accurately as the pointing of a compass. The  reason he remained quiet was that he was almost on the danger-line. In  other words, the mountains and the sudden dip had formed a &#8220;split wind&quot;  in the hollow, and had Thor appeared fifty yards above where he now  crouched, the keen-scented caribou would have got full wind of him.
  With his little ears cocked forward and a new gleam of understanding  in his eyes, Muskwa now looked upon his first lesson in game-stalking.  Crouched so low that he seemed to be travelling on his belly, Thor  moved slowly and noiselessly toward the creek, the huge ruff just  forward of his shoulders standing out like the stiffened spine of a  dog's back. Muskwa followed. For fully a hundred yards Thor continued  his detour, and three times in that hundred yards he paused to sniff in  the direction of the timber. At last he was satisfied. The wind was  full in his face, and it was rich with promise.
  [Illustration: &#8220;Like the wind Thor bore down on the flank of the  caribou, swung a little to one side, and then without any apparent  effort&#8212;still like a huge ball&#8212;he bounded in and upward, and the short  race was done.&#8221;]
  He began to advance, in a slinking, rolling, rock-shouldered motion,  taking shorter steps now, and with every muscle in his great body ready  for action. Within two minutes he reached the edge of the balsams, and  there he paused again. The crackling of underbrush came distinctly. The  caribou were up, but they were not alarmed. They were going forth to  drink and graze.
  Thor moved again, parallel to the sound. This brought him quickly to  the edge of the timber, and there he stood, concealed by foliage, but  with the lake and the short stretch of meadow in view. A big bull  caribou came out first. His horns were half grown, and in velvet. A  two-year-old followed, round and sleek and glistening like brown velvet  in the sunset. For two minutes the bull stood alert, eyes, ears, and  nostrils seeking for danger-signals; at his heels the younger animal  nibbled less suspiciously at the grass. Then lowering his head until  his antlers swept back over his shoulders the old bull started slowly  toward the lake for his evening drink. The two-year-old followed&#8212;and  Thor came out softly from his hiding-place.
  For a single moment he seemed to gather himself&#8212;and then he  started. Fifty feet separated him from the caribou. He had covered half  that distance like a huge rolling ball when the animals heard him. They  were off like arrows sprung from the bow. But they were too late. It  would have taken a swift horse to beat Thor and he had already gained  momentum.
  Like the wind he bore down on the flank of the two-year-old, swung a  little to one side, and then without any apparent effort&#8212;still like a  huge ball&#8212;he bounded in and upward, and the short race was done.
  His huge right arm swung over the two-year-old's shoulder, and as  they went down his left paw gripped the caribou's muzzle like a huge  human hand. Thor fell under, as he always planned to fall. He did not  hug his victim to death. Just once he doubled up one of his hind legs,  and when it went back the five knives it carried disembowelled the  caribou. They not only disembowelled him, but twisted and broke his  ribs as though they were of wood. Then Thor got up, looked around, and  shook himself with a rumbling growl which might have been either a  growl of triumph or an invitation for Muskwa to come to the feast.
  If it was an invitation, the little tan-faced cab did not wait for a  second. For the first time he smelled and tasted the warm blood of  meat. And this smell and taste had come at the psychological moment in  his life, just as it had come in Thor's life years before. All  grizzlies are not killers of big game. In fact, very few of them are.  Most of them are chiefly vegetarians, with a meat diet of smaller  animals, such as gophers, whistling marmots, and porcupines. Now and  then chance makes of a grizzly a hunter of caribou, goat, sheep, deer,  and even moose. Such was Thor. And such, in days to come, would Muskwa  be, even though he was a black and not of the family Ursus Horribilis  Ord.
  For an hour the two feasted, not in the ravenous way of hungry dogs,  but in the slow and satisfying manner of gourmets. Muskwa, flat on his  little paunch, and almost between Thor's huge forearms, lapped up the  blood and snarled like a kitten as he ground tender flesh between his  tiny teeth. Thor, as in all his food-seeking, hunted first for the  tidbits, though the<I> sapoos oovin</I> had made him as empty as a room  without furniture. He pulled out the thin leafs of fat from about the  kidneys and bowels, and munched at yard-long strings of it, his eyes  half closed.
  The last of the sun faded away from the mountains, and darkness  followed swiftly after the twilight. It was dark when they finished,  and little Muskwa was as wide as he was long.
  Thor was the greatest of nature's conservators. With him nothing  went to waste that was good to eat, and at the present moment if the  old bull caribou had deliberately walked within his reach Thor in all  probability would not have killed him. He had food, and his business  was to store that food where it would be safe.
  He went back to the balsam thicket, but the gorged cub now made no  effort to follow him. He was vastly contented, and something told him  that Thor would not leave the meat. Ten minutes later Thor verified his  judgment by returning. In his huge jaws he caught the caribou at the  back of the neck. Then he swung himself partly sidewise and began  dragging the carcass toward the timber as a dog might have dragged a  ten-pound slab of bacon.
  The young bull probably weighed four hundred pounds. Had he weighed  eight hundred, or even a thousand, Thor would still have dragged  him&#8212;but had the carcass weighed that much he would have turned  straight around and<I> backed</I> with his load.
  In the edge of the balsams Thor had already found a hollow in the  ground. He thrust the carcass into this hollow, and while Muskwa  watched with a great and growing interest, he proceeded to cover it  over with dry needles, sticks, a rotting tree butt, and a log. He did  not rear himself up and leave his &#8220;mark&#8221; on a tree as a warning to  other bears. He simply nosed round for a bit, and then went out of the  timber.
  Muskwa followed him now, and he had some trouble in properly  navigating himself under the handicap of his added weight. The stars  were beginning to fill the sky, and under these stars Thor struck  straight up a steep and rugged slope that led to the mountain-tops. Up  and up he went, higher than Muskwa had ever been. They crossed a patch  of snow. And then they came to a place where it seemed as if a volcano  had disrupted the bowels of a mountain. Man could hardly have travelled  where Thor led Muskwa.
  At last he stopped. He was on a narrow ledge, with a perpendicular  wall of rock at his back. Under him fell away the chaos of torn-up rock  and shale. Far below the valley lay a black and bottomless pit.
  Thor lay down, and for the first time since his hurt in the other  valley he stretched out his head between his great arms, and heaved a  deep and restful sigh. Muskwa crept up close to him, so close that he  was warmed by Thor's body; and together they slept the deep and  peaceful sleep of full stomachs, while over them the stars grew  brighter, and the moon came up to flood the peaks and the valley in a  golden splendour.
