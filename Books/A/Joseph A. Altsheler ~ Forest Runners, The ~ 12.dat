Paul and Jim Hart waited several days, never once venturing from the  protecting shadows of the woods, and they found the burden very great. The  little island was like a cage, and Jim Hart groaned, moreover, because he  could not exercise his skill in the art of cooking.    
"These cold victuals," he said, "besides bein' unpleasant to the inside,  are a disgrace to me. I jest got to cook somethin'."    
Finally, he built up a bed of coals on a very dark night, when it was  impossible for anyone to see either their sheltered glow or the smoke they  sent out, and he broiled juicy steaks from the body of a deer that they  had hung up in a tree.    
"Isn't it fine, Paul?" he said, as they ate hungrily.    
"Fine's no name for it," replied Paul. "It's great, splendid, grand,  magnificent, surpassing, unapproachable! Are those the terms, Jim?"    
"I don't know jest what all uv 'em mean," replied Jim Hart, "but they  shorely sound right to me."    
They saw the Indian canoes on the lake once more, but the Miamis seemed to  be fishing, and did not come anywhere near the island. Paul appreciated  then how great had been their continual need of caution.    
A day or two later there was a magnificent thunder storm, despite the  lateness of the season. The heavenly artillery roared grandly, and lakes,  hills, and forest swam at times in a glare that dazzled Jim Hart. After  that it rained hard, and they clung to the shelter of their hut, which was  fortunately water-tight now. The rain ceased by and by, but the clouds  remained in the sky, and night came very thick and dark. Jim Hart  suggested that it would be a good time to do a little fishing, and Paul  was ready and willing.    
They paddled out silently a short distance from the island, where the  water was not too shallow, and let down the lines.    
They waited some time and received no bites; but as this was nothing  unusual, owing to the crudity of their fishing tackle, they persisted  patiently. The night deepened and darkened, and they could not see the  surface of the lake fifty yards away. The water, moved by a light wind,  bubbled faintly against the sides of the canoe. Neither spoke, but sat in  silence, waiting hopefully for a pull on the lines.    
Presently Paul heard a faint, wailing sound, coming from the mainland, but  at first he paid little attention to it. Then he noticed that Jim Hart had  raised his head and was listening intently. Naturally Paul then listened,  too, with the same eager attention, and the faint wailing sound,  singularly weird and strange in the night, came a second, and presently a  third time. But after that it was not repeated. Long Jim Hart looked at  the boy.    
"You know what that is?" he said.    
"The cry of the whip-poor-will."    
"The cry of the whip-poor-will, given three times! The signal! The boys  are thar, an' we must go fur 'em."    
"Of course," said Paul. "Do we need to return to the island for anything?"    
"No; we have our rifles an' ammunition with us. We got to start right now,  an' Paul, don't you splash any water with your paddle."    
Paul understood as well as Jim Hart the need of extreme caution, as the  Miamis might be abroad, and he made every stroke steady and sure. Jim Hart  emitted the lonesome cry of the whip-poor-will once in return--signal for  signal--and then they cut their way in silence through the dark.    
They laid their course, according to agreement, for the drinking place at  the mouth of the brook, and Paul's heart beat with relief and gladness.  His comrades had come back, safe and sound. It did not occur to him that  any one of them might have fallen in the venture. Half way to the mainland  Jim Hart stopped the canoe, and listened a moment.    
"I thought I heard somethin' down the lake that sounded like a splash," he  said.    
But he did not hear it again, and they resumed their progress. Paul now  saw the loom of the land, a darker outline in the darkness, and his heart,  already beating fast, began to beat faster. Suppose there should be some  trick in the signal! Suppose they should find the Miamis, and not their  comrades, waiting for them! He sought hard to pierce the darkness and see  what might be there on the land before him.    
The outline of the shore rose more distinctly out of the darkness, and the  prow of the boat struck softly on the margin. Then Paul saw a figure rise  from the bushes, and after it another, and then a third, and then no more.  He could not see their faces, but it was the right number, and a vast  relief surged up. The three figures came down confidently to the canoe,  and then the welcome voice of Henry Ware said in a low tone:    
"You are here, Paul! You and Jim are on time to the minute!"    
"An' mighty glad I am, too," said Shif'less Sol, in the same tone. "I wuz  never so tired before in all my life. I think I must have trotted a  thousan' miles, an' now I'm willin' to let Jim Hart paddle me the rest o'  the way in a canoe."    
Tom Ross said nothing, merely showing his white teeth in a smile.    
"The Miamis are about," said Paul. "They have been around the lake, and on  it, for days, looking for something."    
"We know it," said Henry. "In fact, we've seen some of them not so long  since, though none of them saw us. There are big doings afoot, Paul, and  we must have our part in them."    
"Should we go back to the island, then?"    
"For the present, yes. We need a base, and the island is safest and best."    
The five got cautiously into the canoe, disposing their weight carefully,  and Shif'less Sol, who had taken the paddle from Paul, raised it for the  first sweep. But it did not come down into the water. Instead, he stopped  it in its fall, and he and all the others listened. The same splash that  Jim Hart thought he had heard came now to their ears, and it was repeated.  Paul knew that it was made by paddles sweeping through water, and it was  coming nearer.    
"Push back into the bushes," whispered Henry.    
They gently shoved the canoe far among the bushes in the shallow water,  and waited. They were completely hidden, but even if seen they could  spring instantly to the land. They waited, and the splashing steadily grew  louder. Paul felt the pressure of Henry's hand on his arm, and he looked  with all his eyes. The Miami navy was abroad that night! A canoe, a long  one with seven or eight warriors in it, was abreast of them, and behind it  came five others. They were not twenty yards away, and Paul, in fancy at  least, saw the savage eyes and the painted faces. What had brought them  out on the lake, what suspicion or precaution, Paul never knew, but there  they were. All were brave hearts in the hidden canoe, but they held their  breath while that silent file passed by. Then, when the last had gone and  was lost in the darkness, they pushed out a little and listened, with all  the keenness of forest-bred ears. Hearing no splash, they paddled in a  straight course for the haunted island.    
"I think they've gone toward the north end of the lake, and as they are  likely to keep on their way, now is our time," said Henry.    
They pushed farther into the lake, Ross and Shif'less Sol now handling  the paddles with wonderful dexterity. They went very slowly, not wishing  to make the faintest splash, and meanwhile the darkness thickened and  deepened again. It felt very damp to the face, and Paul saw now that fog  from the rain of the day was mingled with it. They could not see the  faintest outline of the island, but held their course from memory.    
They had been out about ten minutes when Ross and Sol, as if by  simultaneous impulse, ceased paddling, and Henry whispered; "Don't anybody  make any noise; it's for our lives!"    
They heard that faint splash, which Paul had learned to hate, coming back.  The Miami navy, from some unknown cause, had turned in its course. How  Paul blessed the thick, fog-charged darkness!    
"It's all chance now," whispered Henry, ever so low, and Paul understood.    
Then they held their breath, and the Miami canoes steadily drew nearer.  Would they come directly upon the white canoe or would they pass? They  passed, but they passed so near that Paul could hear the Indians in the  boats talking to each other. He also heard his heart beating in his body  as the invisible file went by, and the loud beat did not cease until no  more splashing of the paddles was heard.    
"Is all my hair gray?" whispered Shif'less Sol.    
Paul wanted to laugh in a kind of nervous relief, but he did not dare.  Instead he whispered back:    
"I can't see, Sol, but I'm sure mine is."    
Ross and Shif'less Sol took up the paddles again, and now they reached the  island without interruption. The boat was hidden again, and soon all were  in the hut in the sheltered cove. Henry spoke with approval of the  industry and forethought of Paul and Jim in their absence.    
"This hut is a mighty good place on a raw night like this," he said. "Now,  I'm going to sleep, and I'd advise you to do the same, Paul. I'll tell you  to-morrow all that we've done and have seen and know."    
While the others slept, Jim Hart, long-legged and captious, but brave,  faithful, and enduring, watched. He saw the fog and the darkness clear  away, and the moonlight came out, crisp and cold. A light wind blew and  dead leaves fell from the trees, rustling dryly as they fell. Autumn was  waning and cold weather would soon be at hand. When pale dawn showed, Jim  roused his comrades, and they ate breakfast, though no fire was lighted.  Then Henry talked.    
"It's true," he said, "about a great league of all the tribes being formed  to destroy forever the white settlements in Kentucky. They are alarmed  about their hunting grounds, and they think they must all strike together  now, and strike hard. We've spied upon several of their villages, and we  know. Some renegades are with them, pointing the way, and among them is  Braxton Wyatt, the most venomous of them all. I don't see how one who is  born white can do such a thing."    
But Paul had read books, and his mind was always leaping forward to new  knowledge.    
"It is the bad blood of some far-off ancestor showing," he said. "It is  what they call a reversion. You know, Henry, that Braxton was always mean  and sulky. I never saw anybody else so spiteful and jealous as he is, and  maybe he thinks he will be a big man among the Indians."    
"That's so," said Henry. "I can understand why anybody should love a life  in the forest. Ah, it's such a glorious thing!"    
He expanded his chest, and the light leaping into his eyes told that Henry  Ware was living the life he loved.    
"But," he added, "I can't see how anybody could ever turn against his own  people."    
"It's moral perversity," said Paul.    
"Moral perversity," said Jim Hart, stumbling over the syllables. "Them  words sound mighty big, Paul. Would you mind tellin' us what they mean?"    
"They mean, Jim," put in Shif'less Sol, "that you won't be what you ought  to be, an' that you won't, all the time."    
"That's a good enough explanation," laughed Paul.    
"Whatever is the reason," said Tom Ross, who used words as rarely as if  they were precious jewels, "the tribes are comin' together to destroy the  white settlements. Braxton is givin' them all kinds uv useful information,  an' we've got to hinder these doin's, ef we kin."    
The others agreed once more, and talked further of the new league. They  did not go into much detail about their adventures while spying on the  villages, rather looking now to the future.    
"I told you, Paul, we ought to a-put a knife in that Braxton Wyatt when we  had the chance," growled Shif'less Sol.    
"I couldn't do it, Sol," replied Paul.    
Later they held a conference beside a bed of coals that threw out no  smoke, and Paul listened with absorbed attention while Henry stated the  case fully.    
"The Shawnees were somewhat daunted by their repulse at Wareville last  year," he said, "but they hope yet to crush the white settlement before we  grow too strong. They are seeking to draw the Miamis, Wyandottes, and all  the other tribes up here into a league for that purpose, and they want to  have it formed and strike while our people are not expecting it.  Wareville, owing to her victory of last year, thinks she's safe, and it is  not the custom of Indians to raid much in winter. See, cold weather is not  far away."    
Henry looked up, and the eyes of the others followed. The trees were still  clothed in leaves, but the blazing reds and yellows and the dim mist on  the horizon showed that Indian summer was at hand.    
"Any day," continued Henry, "a cold wind may strip off all these leaves,  and winter, which can be very cold up here, will come roaring down. Now,  the Shawnees are more than willing to cross the Ohio again to attack us,  but the Miamis, while ready enough to take white scalps up here, have not  yet made up their minds to go south on the war trail. The Shawnees are  sending war belts to them, because the Miamis are a powerful tribe and  have many warriors. The first thing for us to do is to take the messengers  with the war belts."    
"An' to do that," said Shif'less Sol, "we've got to git off this islan' ez  soon ez we kin, an' shake off the band o' Miamis. Thar is always work fur  a tired man to do."    
Paul laughed at his tone of disgust. The boy's spirits were high now; in  fact, he was exuberant over the safe return of his comrades, and the  entire enterprise appealed with steadily increasing force to him. To  hinder and prevent the Indian alliance until the white settlements were  strong enough to defy all the tribes! This was in truth a deed worth  while! It was foresight, statesmanship, a long step in the founding of a  great state, and he should have a part in it! Already his vivid mind  painted the picture of his comrades and himself triumphant.    
"We must go to-night, if it is dark," said Henry.    
"That's so," said Tom Ross emphatically.    
The three had captured fresh supplies of ammunition while they were gone,  and they replenished the powder-horns and bullet pouches of Paul and Jim  Hart. Moreover, they had taken blankets, of a fine, soft, light but warm  make, probably bought by the Indians from European traders, and they gave  one each to Paul and Jim Hart.    
"It's getting too cold now," said Henry, "to sleep in our clothes only on  the ground in the forest."    
They made up the blankets in tight little rolls, which they fastened on  their backs, and Paul and Jim Hart put in a tanned deerskin with each of  theirs.    
"They're pow'ful light, an' they may come in mighty handy," said Long Jim.    
The night fortunately was dark, as they had hoped, and about eleven  o'clock they embarked in the canoe, paddling straight for the western  shore. Paul looked back with some regret at the island, which at times had  been a snug little home. The ancient, mummified bodies in the trees had  protected them, as if with a circle of steel, and he was grateful to those  dead of long ago.    
They saw no sign of the Indian canoes, and both Henry and Ross were  certain that they were in camp somewhere on the eastern shore. The little  party reached the dense woods on the west without incident whatever, and  there they partly sank the canoe in shallow water among dense bushes. Then  they plunged into the forest, and traveled fast. Shif'less Sol spoke after  a while, and apparently his groaning voice was drawn up from the very  bottom of his chest.    
"Oh, that blessed canoe!" he said. "I wuz so happy when I wuz a-ridin' in  it, an' somebody else wuz a-paddlin'. Now I hev to do all my own work."    
"You wouldn't be truly happy, Sol Hyde," said Jim Hart, "'less you wuz  ridin' in a gilt coach drawed by four white horses, right smack through  the woods here."    
"That's heaven," said the shiftless one, with a deep sigh. "I don't ever  dream o' sech a thing ez that, and please don't call it up to my mind, Jim  Hart; the contras' between that an' footin' it ez I am now is too cruel  an' too great."    
Paul smiled. The little by-play between those two good friends amused and  brightened him, but nothing else was said for a long time. Then it was  Henry who spoke, and he called a halt.    
"The big Miami village is not more than a dozen miles away," he said, "and  the warriors there are expecting messengers from the Shawnees, with war  belts. The messengers will pass near here, and we'll wait for them. The  rest of you will go to sleep, and Tom and I will watch."    
Paul, Jim Hart, and Shif'less Sol rolled themselves in their blankets and  lay down under a tree, the shiftless one murmuring, "Now, this is what I  like," and the others saying nothing. Paul was devoutly grateful for the  blanket, because the air was now quite cold, but in five minutes all  emotions were lost in deep and dreamless sleep.    
When Paul awoke from his slumber he started up in horror. Three powerful,  painted Shawnees stood over him. He was so much overwhelmed by the  catastrophe that he could only utter a kind of gasp. But the blood flowed  back from his heart into his veins when he heard the dry laugh of Long  Jim Hart.    
"Paul," said Jim, "I'd like to introduce you to the three new Shawnee  warriors that you used to know, when they were white, an' that you called  then Henry Ware, Tom Ross, and Sol Hyde."    
"Why, what has happened?" asked Paul, still in the depths of astonishment.    
Then Henry spoke, and he spoke gravely.    
"Sol did not sleep long, Paul," he said, "and when he awoke he joined us.  Then we went to meet the three Shawnee messengers, carrying war belts and  peace belts, for the Miamis to choose. It was not a business for you,  Paul. We met them, there was a fight--well, they will never appear in the  Miami village, and we are here in their place."    
Paul understood, and he shuddered a little at the deadly conflict that  must have raged out there in the forest while he slept. Then he looked  curiously at the three. He never would have known any one of them  anywhere. They were savages in every aspect--painted and garbed like them,  and with their hair drawn up in the defiant scalp lock.    
"What are you going to do?" he asked.    
"Deliver the belts at the Miami village," replied Henry Ware, "but they  will be peace belts, not war belts."    
"It is death," said Paul in protest.    
"It is not death," replied Henry. "We will come back safely, and it is for  a great stake. You and Jim must remain here in the woods, waiting for us  again, and we'll trust to your skill and caution not to be caught. If the  warriors become too thick around here you might retreat to the island.  Anyway, the signal will be as before--three wails of the whip-poor-will."    
Paul was impressed by his words, which were spoken with gravity and  emphasis.    
"Yes, it's in a great cause, Henry," he said, "and we'll wait, expecting  you to come back."    
Five minutes later the three newly made warriors took their path through  the forest, and they never looked back. Yet Henry Ware felt emotion.  Although he regarded Paul Cotter almost as a younger brother, he respected  him as a high type of one kind of being, and they were comrades true as  steel. Moreover, he knew that he and Ross and Sol were engaged upon the  most dangerous of tasks, and the chances were that they would not come  back. Yet he faced them with a high heart and dauntless courage.    
The three walked swiftly and silently in single file, and neither Shawnee  nor Miami eye would have known that they were not Indian. They walked,  toes in, as Indians do, and they had every trick of manner or gesture  that the red men have. All trace of civilization was gone. Henry Ware,  Thomas floss, and Solomon Hyde had disappeared. In their places were Big  Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat, Shawnee warriors who bore belts to the Miami  village, and who would talk about the war to be made upon the white  intruders far to the south of the Ohio.    
Shortly before noon Big Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat approached the Miami  village, pitched in a pleasant valley, where wood and water were in  plenty. Then they uttered the long whoop of the Shawnees, and it was  answered from the Miami village; but Big Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat,  assured of a welcome, never stopped, keeping straight on for the village.  Squaws and children clustered around them, and openly spoke their  admiration of the three stalwart, splendidly proportioned warriors who had  come from the friendly tribe; but Big Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat, in  accordance with the Indian nature, took no notice. It was only warriors  and chiefs to whom they would condescend to speak, and they were silent  and expressionless until the right moment should come. They passed  straight through the swarm of old men, women, children, and dogs, toward  the center of the village, where a long, low cabin of poles stood. An  ancient and reverend figure stood in the doorway to meet them. It was that  of Gray Beaver, head chief of the Miamis, an old, old man, gray with years  and wise like the beaver, from which he took his name.    
"My Shawnee brethren are welcome to the Council House," he said. "You have  come far, and you shall rest, and the squaws shall bring you food before  we talk."    
"It is sufficient to us to see the great and wise chief, Gray Beaver,"  said Henry. "Though we come from a long journey, it makes us strong and  brave again."    
The old chief bowed, but his grave features did not relax. Nevertheless,  he was pleased in his secret soul at the gallant bearing and polite words  of the young warrior who addressed them. He led the way into the Council  House, and a half dozen underchiefs followed them, hiding their interest  beneath their painted masks of faces.    
The Council House was large--fifty warriors could have sat in it--and  robes of the buffalo, beaver, and other animals were spread about. Big  Fox, Brown Bear, and The Bat sat down gravely, each upon a mat of skins,  and were served by the warriors with food and drink, which the squaws had  brought to the door, but beyond which they could not pass. The three  Shawnee belt bearers ate and drank in silence and dignity, and they  appreciated the rest and refreshment so needful to those who had traveled  far. Neither did anyone else speak. The venerable Gray Beaver sat on a  couch of skins a little higher than the others, and his eyes rested  steadily on the belt bearers. The subchiefs, silent and motionless on  their mats of skins, also watched the belt bearers. At one end of the  great room, in a kind of rude chimney, smoldered the council fire, a bed  of coals.    
More than half an hour passed, and when the guests had eaten and drunk  sufficiently, the venerable chief waved his hands, and the remains of the  food and drink were taken away. Then Gray Beaver drew from beneath his  robe a beautifully ornamented pipe, with a curved horn stem and a carven  bowl. He pressed into the bowl a mixture of tobacco and aromatic herbs,  which he also drew from beneath his robe, and lighted it with a coal which  one of the chiefs brought from the fire. Then he took three whiffs and  gravely and silently passed the pipe to the chief of the Shawnee belt  bearers, Big Fox. It was a curious fact, but no one had said that Big Fox  was the chief of the three. Something in his manner made all take it for  granted, and Big Fox, too, unconsciously accepted it as a matter of  course.    
The magnificent young warrior took three whiffs at the pipe of peace, and  passed it to Brown Bear, who, after doing the same, handed it in his turn  to The Bat. Then it was passed on to all the subchiefs, and everyone  smoked it in gravity and silence. The smoke circled up in rings against  the low roof, and every man sat upon his mat of skins, painted,  motionless, and wordless. The young chief, Big Fox, waited. Though his  eyes never turned, he saw every detail of the scene, and he was conscious  of the tense and breathless silence. He was conscious, too, of the immense  dangers that surrounded his comrades and himself, but fear was not in his  heart.    
"My brethren have come to the Miami village with a message from their  friends, the Shawnees," said the ancient chief at last.    
"It is so," said Big Fox.    
"The hearts of the Shawnees are filled with hatred of the white men, who  have come into the hunting grounds beyond the Ohio, and who cut down trees  and build houses there."    
"It is so."    
Big Fox's gaze never wavered. He continued to look straight at the council  fire, and the tense silence came again. Big Fox was conscious that the air  in the Council House was heavy, and that all were watching him with black,  glittering eyes.    
"The Shawnees would destroy the white villages, and would seek the help  of all the tribes that know them," continued Gray Beaver.    
Then Big Fox spoke.    
"It is true," he said gravely and slowly, "that the Shawnees would wish  the white settlements destroyed, every house burned, and every warrior,  squaw, and child killed, that the forest might grow again where they live,  and the deer roam again unafraid."    
Big Fox paused, and for the first time looked away from the council fire.  His piercing gaze swept the circle of the Miamis, and every man among them  drew a deep breath. There was something extraordinary in this belt bearer,  a majesty and magnetism that all of them felt, and they hung upon his  words, listening intently.    
"The Shawnees are warriors," resumed Big Fox, "and they do not fear  battle. They went last year against the white settlements, and they went  alone. The Miamis know that."    
There was a deep murmur of assent.    
"The Shawnees are wise as well as brave," resumed Big Fox. "Their old  chiefs have talked over it long. It is a great war trail upon which we  would go, and he who would travel far and long should prepare well. The  white men are brave. From their wooden walls last year they beat us off,  and many Shawnees fell afterwards in the battle with them in the forest."    
Big Fox paused, and swept the circle again with his glittering eyes. As  before, every man among them drew a deep breath when that hypnotic gaze  fell upon him. But they were hearing words that they had not expected to  hear, and after the tremendous gaze had passed there came a faint murmur  of surprise. But Big Fox did not seem to notice it. Instead he continued:    
"The winter is at hand. Already the dead leaves fall, and soon the bitter  winds will sweep the forests and the prairies. The warrior would go forth  to battle, chilled and stiff. The gun would fall from his frozen hands."    
Again he paused and looked straight at Gray Beaver. The old chief stirred  in his furred robe beneath that piercing gaze.    
"We would not go forth to war until we are ready for war, until the season  is ripe for war," resumed Big Fox. "When we would strike, we would strike  with all the strength of all the allied tribes, that nothing of the white  man might be left. We would send to Canada for more rifles, more powder,  and more bullets, and to do all these things it must be long before we go  on the great war trail. So I bring you, for the present, peace."    
He took from beneath his robe the peace belts, message of the Shawnee  nation, and handed them to the old, old chief, Gray Beaver. The murmur  from the Miamis became deep and long, but Big Fox gazed once more at the  fire, painted, silent, and immovable.    
"It was war when I was in the Shawnee village, a moon ago," said a chief,  Yellow Panther, "and it was war belts that we expected. Why have the  Shawnees changed their minds?"    
Murmurs of approval greeted his words, but Big Fox never stirred.    
"The old men, the wise men of the Shawnees have so decided," he replied.  "It is not for the bearer of the belts to question their wisdom."    
"If the Shawnees wish to wait long to prepare, the Miamis must wait, too,"  said the chief, Gray Beaver, in whose veins flowed the cold and languid  blood of old age.    
The younger chiefs murmured again. Big Fox was conscious that a powerful  faction of the Miamis wished to go on a winter war path, and strike the  settlements at once. But Big Fox was still unafraid. He was a forest  diplomatist as well as a forest warrior, and he played for the most  precious of all stakes, the lives of his people.    
"The great chiefs of the Shawnees have lived long," he said. "Their heads  are heavy with age and with wisdom. It is not well to waste our strength  with a blow which will not reach the mark, but it is good to wait until we  can strike true."    
The chief, Yellow Panther, arose. He was a tall and ferocious savage, with  a cunning countenance.    
"The Shawnees change their minds quickly," he said, in tones of subtle and  insulting insinuation. "There is one here who came from their village but  three days since, and then they looked not so kindly upon the peace belts.  It is well to bring him to this council of the Miamis."    
He glanced at Gray Beaver and the ancient chief nodded. Then Yellow  Panther stepped from the Council House.    
The heart of Big Fox stirred within him ever so slightly. What did Yellow  Panther mean by "one who had come but three days since"? A new factor was  entering the terrible game. But he showed no emotion, nor did his  comrades, the other two belt bearers, Brown Bear and The Bat. Neither of  the latter had spoken since he entered the Council House.    
The murmurs ceased, and all sank back on their skin mats. Silence resumed  absolute sway in the long room. The little eddies of smoke still curled  against the roof, and the air was surcharged with suspense.    
The buffalo robe over the entrance was lifted, and Yellow Panther  returned. Behind him came a second figure.    
The eyes of Big Fox turned slowly from the council fire, and looked  straight into those of Braxton Wyatt.
