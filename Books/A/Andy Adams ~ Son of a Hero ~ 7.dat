  McEwen had fought like ten men. The crew stood back, cowed and   bleeding, and McEwen rested on his capstan-bar. He had done murder;   and now he knew that he was at the climax of his misfortunes. But he   had meted out vengeance in full measure, and though the stings of   regret were coming with a cooler realization of what men would call   his crime, his whole being still throbbed with the primal instinct   that had called upon him to become the messenger of a good but   unreasoning justice. The dead man at his feet had been a sinning   thing, a coveter of that which every man holds precious unto himself.   McEwen was glad that he had killed him. For an instant the little   woman behind him had been glad, too. 
  Now there was quiet where there had been the strife of battle.  Seven  men had struggled with McEwen, and six of them, their hearts  filled  with sympathy, rested for the command of the seventh who lay  only  partly conscious upon the deck. This seventh was the captain.  McEwen  had struck him hard, and the face of the woman was filled with  hatred  as she looked upon the great bulk of the master in his defeat.  She  came up to the man who was her husband and took one of his naked  arms  between her hands, the light of love shining in her eyes.  McEwen's  wife was almost beautiful. Now, when the world had come to  look its  blackest to the man whose life had been indissolubly mixed  with  misfortune, it was she who had innocently edged him on to final  ruin.  The knowledge was slowly coming to him as he waited for the next   attack. 
  His eyes gleamed with the fire of an animal longing, and he took  one  step forward toward the prostrate captain to measure over again  the  justice which was due to two, but which had emptied itself  unsparingly  upon the head of one. But the woman was before him. She  turned her  back upon the crew and twined one of her arms around the  man's neck.  With her other hand she drew his head down until it rested  upon her  shoulder. When men came up behind him the desire of vengeance  had gone  out of McEwen. Not a sound fell from his lips as the ship's  irons were  snapped over his wrists. Soothed into submission by the  touch of the  one for whom he had given his life, he walked quietly  with his captors  to the little cabin that had been his wife's, and  there, with the door  barred behind them, the two were left alone. 
  It was a long time before either the woman or the man spoke. McEwen   seated himself, and his companion kneeled silently and held his   manacled hands close to her. As darkness slowly hid her husband's face   she crept up to him until her cold wet cheek rested against his own.   &quot;Don't cry,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You weren't to blame&#8212;you couldn't be!&quot; 
  &quot;I struck him!&quot; cried the woman. &quot;Oh, I struck him hard, Ben!&quot; She   laid her head upon the man's knees and sobbed. &quot;Oh, Ben&#8212;Ben&#8212;I'd give   my life if I hadn't told you!&quot; 
  &quot;No&#8212;no&#8212;it was right,&quot; replied McEwen. &quot;I am to blame, little  girl&#8212;  only me. I knew Hendricks&#8212;I knew the captain-I was a fool for   bringing you on a trip with him. I could stand his eyeing you, an'   smiling, but when Hendricks came upon you for'rd, like a sneak, and&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I hit&#8212;I hit him!&quot; sobbingly interrupted the woman. She slipped up   between his arms and McEwen pressed her to him until the irons on his   wrist hurt her back. 
  &quot;Yes, you hit him. I know you hit him hard,&quot; said the man. &quot;But I  hit  'im harder, I hit 'im considerably harder. And I'm glad!&quot; 
  &quot;Ben&#8212;Ben,&quot; pleaded the woman. 
  &quot;Yes, I'm glad,&quot; repeated the man, doggedly. &quot;But I'm sorry for  you,  Anne. There was a time when I thought the worst had happened.  When  little Tom died and I lost my ship&#8212;my berth&#8212;and had to turn  common  seaman to keep you from starving. I've always been unlucky, and  now&#8212;&quot; 
  McEwen caught himself, and his wife did not question. Hours  afterward  the woman knocked on the barred door and the man on watch  let her out.  It was nearly midnight, but a light was burning brightly  in the  captain's cabin. McEwen's wife took a few steps towards it,  then  hesitated and turned into the shadow of the galley. Only a few  faint  gleams of the stem lights streaked the gloom of the after-deck,  and  into this she walked silently and leaned over the rail of the  ship.  For a long time she glared out into the blackness of the sea.  Now and  then over this highway of the lakes there glimmered faintly  the lights  of other ships, and far astern she saw a glowing,  ever-changing eye  that guarded a point of the Michigan wilderness,  winking at her, it  seemed, like a ball of we behind lids constantly  closing. 
  Behind that light the woman knew there lay the stillness of the  peace  of a land unclaimed by human strife, and into her heart there  came a  longing to reach over into it and to take with her the ironed  man she  had left back in the little cabin. As she thought of the  restfulness  there, amid the forests that breathed of good will to all  living  things, the great red eye winked and winked at her, and each  time, as  the hurrying ship left it farther behind, it seemed to call  to her  more eagerly, yet with growing hopelessness. At last it sank  behind a  forest headland, but even then a last reflection flashed up  into the  sky, and when that was gone the woman buried her head in her  arms and  sobbed and listened to the gurgling music of the running  water in the  ship's wake. After a little she slipped out among the  shadows of the  deck and approached a stalwart figure that was leaning  over the wheel  of the schooner. &quot;Mr. Falkner, may I talk with  you&#8212;just a minute,  please?&quot; she asked. 
  The young man turned and lifted his lantern as McEwen's wife came  up  into the light. In the struggle that day the woman had seen him   protect her husband, as if by accident, from a vicious blow by the   captain, and she had confidence in him. 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;I thank you for&#8212;for not hurting him.&quot; 
  The wheelman lowered his lantern from the white beautiful face of  the  woman and turned the wick down so that it left them almost in   darkness. 
  &quot;I saw what you did,&quot; she added. &quot;You don't blame him, then?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; muttered the sailor, glancing quickly in the direction of the   captain's lighted cabin, into which a new master had just moved. Jenks   was a fit successor for the dead man. &quot;I'd have done it myself in   Ben's place.&quot; And for a few minutes the two stood silent, looking out   into the blackness that hung over the Sea. ahead. 
  &quot;You think&#8212;there's no hope?&quot; faltered McEwen's wife. 
  He had expected this, and answered equivocally: &quot;We're bound for   Buffalo. If it was Detroit, or Algonac&#8212;&quot; Then he stopped, hoping that   the other would understand. 
  &quot;What difference does it make where we're bound for?&quot; she  persisted,  laying a hand upon his arm. 
  Falkner drove the schooner a point out of her course, to busy  himself,  then brought her slowly back, and thought hard as he worked.  &quot;Well, it  means this,&quot; he finally said, cornered. &quot;If a ship was just  leaving  Duluth and I was to kill a man or commit piracy, I'd be  punished by  the state for which bound, even if the port was a thousand  miles away.  It's the law of the lakes.&quot; 
  &quot;I understand,&quot; moaned the woman. &quot;In New York&#8212;they&#8212;kill&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And in Michigan they don't,&quot; said Falkner. 
  Anne McEwen's hand dropped from his arm. For a few moments she  stood  with bowed head, and Jim, with a thick feeling in his own  throat,  thought that she was crying. But when the woman spoke again  her voice  was so firm that it startled him. 
  &quot;You've been kind, Mr. Falkner. I'll always think of it,&quot; she said,   and walked in the direction of the captain's cabin, this time boldly. 
  God help me,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;Oh, I'll do it, Ben; I'll  do  it I'll do it!&quot; For a moment she paused beside the captain's door,  as  if still lacking a little of the courage she would need in the  trial  before her. Then she knocked, her little fist beating firmly  against  the oak panel, and Falkner heard the thick voice of the new  master as  he called for her to enter. For an hour after that the  wheelman  watched and listened closely, determined to rush to the  woman's  assistance should she call for it. But he heard no sounds; and  only  once did he see a figure through the lighted window, and that so   indistinctly that he could not tell whether it was the captain or the   prisoner's wife. At the end of the hour the cabin door was opened and   Mrs. McEwen reappeared. Her face flushed with excitement, and in her   eyes there was a dazzling fire which the captain did not understand as   he looked into them. 
  &quot;Then you don't understand what I mean, Captain?&quot; she whispered,   pausing and looking up at the man in the lighted doorway. &quot;I wish you   could&#8212;oh, I wish you could!&quot; She clenched her hands, and a look of   pathetic helplessness filled her face. Jim Falkner saw it and grinned.   He could not hear what she was saying, but his faith in the honour of   McEwen's wife was strong, and he knew that she was fighting&#8212;fighting   hard. &quot;Oh, I wish you could!&quot; the woman whispered again, so   tremulously that she seemed on the point of crying. &quot;Don't you see?   Ben has always made life miserable for me, and&#8212;I&#8212;I&#8212;want you to get   rid of him, but you mustn't kill him! Can't you see what I mean now?&quot;   she cried desperately. &quot;I want you to give him a chance, that's all&#8212;a   chance to kill himself!&quot; 
  Before the captain could detain her she turned and ran quickly  across  the deck of the schooner toward the little cabin. When the  watch  admitted her into McEwen's prison he smiled in a way that was  not  pleasant, and the woman felt like striking him. She knew that this  man  had seen her come from the captain's cabin, and that the next day   stories of her visit would be common among the crew. Her face burned   with mingled excitement, triumph, and shame, and she pressed it for a   moment against her husband's rough cheek. But now she could talk   hopefully. 
  She described to the condemned man the things they would do when he   was free. She told him of the light on the edge of the Michigan   wilderness, how it had seemed to call to her, and how he and she might   bury themselves in the great pine forest, and live there peacefully,   as others had done and were doing. She described the happy visions she   had seen in her dreams when he was away at sea, visions of a hundred   Arcadias waiting for them in the vast, unsettled northland, where   summer was sweet with the fragrance of flowers and the song of birds,   and the still, white winter was always filled with the peace of the   wild. Until the first light of dawn came in at the little cabin window   she added fuel to the spark of hope that was beginning to burn in the   man's breast. 
  This morning McEwen's wife made her toilet with more than usual  care.  She was a little pale and there were shadows under her eyes, but  when  she came on deck her hair glowed red-gold in the early sun and  her  eyes shone with unnatural brightness. She guessed that her visit  to  the new captain was already known among the men. The sailors stared  at  her boldly, and the seaman who had taken the place of the promoted   mate approached her and smilingly asked if she were ready for   breakfast. 
  &quot;I am going to take breakfast in the other cabin,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Will  you tell Captain Jenks that I am ready?&quot; 
  Her tone of authority confused him. If Captain Jenks was already   subject to the wiles of this woman, it behoved the sailor to act with   propriety; and he dropped a warning to the sailors as he carried Mrs.   McEwen's message to the skipper. The developments of the day showed   that his judgment was right, for Anne McEwen not only breakfasted in   the captain's cabin, but she took complete possession of its occupant,   and when the two came out upon the deck she clung to the man's arm   with an astonishing air of ownership. During the whole of the morning   the two were continually together, with the exception of brief   intervals which the woman spent in the prisoner's cabin. At noon the   two dined together. A little later Mrs. McEwen reappeared alone. Her   face was flushed with excitement, her eyes sparkled with triumph. She   tried vainly to hide her emotion as she hurried to her husband. Jim   Falkner saw her and knew that she had achieved something which meant   much to her and to the shackled man in the little cabin. She sought to   flash the news to him with her eyes as she passed, but he failed to   comprehend in detail; so he fell to guessing. 
  That afternoon Captain Jenks called Falkner into his cabin and  seemed  unusually pleased about something &quot;You're at the wheel from  twelve  until two to-night, ain't you, Jim?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the young man. 
  &quot;Well, you needn't report until one o'clock. And look here,  Falkner&#8212;&quot;  The giant captain stood up and placed both hands upon the  seaman's  broad shoulders. &quot;There ain't no use of gossiping about a  little  change like this, is there? Take a reef in your jaw, Jim&#8212;and  hold it!  Understand?&quot; The young man returned silently to his duty with  a  feeling in him that something stupendous depended upon his silence&#8212;   something that in some way had to do with the welfare of the woman who   was plotting. Once he even asked himself if it were possible that Anne   McEwen had turned traitor to her husband, but he immediately growled   out a curse at himself for having allowed such a thought to enter his   head. 
  McEwen's wife remained with her husband all of the afternoon.  Captain  Jenks showed no anxiety to see her, and even evaded as much as   possible that part of the ship where the prisoner's cabin was   situated. Toward evening the woman came on deck again and went into   the stern of the schooner. Until the ship's light began to glow in the   gathering darkness she amused herself by throwing crumbs of iron ore   into the bottom of a skiff that was dragging behind the vessel. At   first she missed frequently. Ten&#8212;twenty&#8212;thirty times, and her   judgment became more accurate. Then she closed her eyes, and with   tragic earnestness tossed the bits of ore blindly. She counted,   missing once out of three, once out of five, and at last only once out   of ten times. She was still practising when the captain came up and   stood beside her at the rail. 
  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked. He leaned over and looked down into   the bottom of the boat. The woman laughed as she called his attention   to the little pieces of ore. &quot;I've tossed seventy pieces out of a   hundred in there,&quot; she cried. &quot;I'll wager you couldn't do it,   Captain!&quot; She gave her companion a handful of ore and watched him with   apparent earnestness as he measured the distance. When he missed twice   out of ten throws she clapped her hands and laughed. In a moment she   became sober as the cook approached to inquire where she would have   her supper. 
  &quot;With my husband, please,&quot; she said, &quot;and send supper for half a   dozen. I'm ravenously hungry. Captain, tell him to bring us double   allowance, will you?&quot; She appealed to the skipper, who reiterated the   order. 
  &quot;I was hoping that you would take supper with me,&quot; he said, as the   cook turned away. 
  &quot;You know it is the last time,&quot; she replied, drawing back slightly  as  he came nearer to her. 
  &quot;Are you sure it is the last?&quot; questioned the captain. &quot;Are you  sure  that&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I'm absolutely certain,&quot; interrupted Mrs. McEwen, with a shudder.   &quot;Ben knows that he has got to die. But he fears the kind of death&#8212;and   the disgrace&#8212;to me.&quot; Unconsciously the woman's voice became almost   tender. But she hardened it in a moment. &quot;Ugh-h-h! He talks of it in   such a cold-blooded way&#8212;and I agree with him in everything. He thinks   that it will save me trouble if he kills himself before we arrive at   Buffalo. So when you give him his liberty for a few minutes to stretch   his legs, s he calls it, he is going to take advantage of the   opportunity and jump overboard. This afternoon he said that he was   glad you weren't going to take his irons off, for he'd drown quicker   with them on. Oh, yes&#8212;he'll do it!&quot; 
  The man came closer, and in the semi-gloom he stretched out an arm.   The woman drew suddenly back, but naturally, as if she did not see it.   &quot;I'm going back to&#8212;to the cabin now,&quot; she said. &quot;You won't see me   again until to-morrow. I'll pretend that I am asleep when you unlock   the door, and he won't awaken me. Good night.&quot; She slipped out of the   captain's reach and was gone before he could move to detain her. 
  A few minutes after she had rejoined her husband the cook was  admitted  with their supper. Mrs. McEwen ate lightly, and several times  during  the course of the meal she cautioned her husband to be more  sparing  with the food. After they had finished she took what remained  of bread  and meat and wrapped it in a piece of cloth. The half-dozen  potatoes  the cook had brought she put in a paper bag. Every scrap of  food, even  to bread-crumbs, she collected and hid away. When the cook  returned  for the dishes an hour later he made no attempt to conceal  his  astonishment. The prisoner grinned at him good-naturedly. Mrs.  McEwen  smiled at him. &quot;I know you think we're&#8212;we're pigs,&quot; she  laughed. 
  &quot;But we were so hungry, and your supper was awfully good.&quot; 
  After that the hours passed slowly. Once the woman drew a small  file  from inside her dress and showed it to McEwen, and the two  laughed  happily Again and again the prisoner drew his fingers over its  rough  edge, and each time he smiled more confidently. 
  &quot;I wish I might try it just a little on the under side, Ben,&quot;  begged  his wife, but the man shook his head and nodded suspiciously  toward  the door. 
  After ten o'clock the woman at times thought the hands of McEwen's   watch had stopped. She laid the timepiece in the light of the cabin   lamp and until eleven kept her eyes almost constantly upon it. Then   she extinguished the light, and in the thick darkness crept up close   to her husband. The man bent to whisper to her, but she stopped him by   placing a hand over his mouth. One by one she counted off the seconds   to herself. A hundred&#8212;two hundred&#8212;three hundred, and up to five   times three hundred she measured the time. Then she quietly slipped   out from between McEwen's arms and tiptoed to her bunk. Again she   counted, until she knew that the hour was almost gone. She strained   her ears now to catch the sounds of the ship. Once she thought she   heard footsteps. For a few minutes after that there was absolute   silence, and then there came the fumbling of a hand at the cabin door.   Trembling with excitement, the woman half raised herself until she was   sure that the man had come and gone. &quot;Ben,&quot; she whispered. 
  McEwen came to her. For a few moments the woman lay with her head  upon  his breast and her arms around him. Then she pushed him gently  away,  and the shackled man walked to the door and opened it. McEwen  could  discern no sign of life on deck with the exception of a shadow  at the  wheel, which he knew was the captain. So he walked out boldly  and  passed into the bow where he could conceal himself from the eyes  of  the man aft. Scarcely had he disappeared when Mrs. McEwen followed  him  and crept cautiously out into the deep shadow of the cabin. There  she  crouched, eagerly watching the figure at the wheel. The knowledge  that  the captain had thus far kept himself to her plot almost  overwhelmed  her. 
  She could see that he was alone and that part of the ship's lights   were extinguished. Amidships the vessel was buried in deep gloom. The   darkness hung like a wall between her and the dimly lighted stern,   where stood the man; and the woman knew that through this the captain   was watching the exposed part of the forward deck. Foot by foot she   crawled aft, until from the protection of a hatch in the outer edge of   the blackness of the midship deck she could look upon the wheelman and   almost hear him breathe. Once or twice she dared to move that she   might look back into the schooner's bow. The first time she saw her   husband leaning over the rail of the ship; the second, he had   disappeared. When she turned to the captain again he had left the   wheel and was coming quietly up into the gloom. 
  With her face pressed upon the deck, and her throbbing heart almost   bursting with mingled fear and hope, McEwen's wife heard him pass   within a few feet of her. Face to face with the crucial moment she   rose to her feet and darted across the illuminated space that lay   between her and the darkness of the stern, her bare feet falling   noiselessly upon the deck. For the fraction of a minute she stood   poised over the after rail. Once&#8212;twice&#8212;three times she tossed   objects into the blackness of the sea, and each time, as she heard   them drop into the bottom of the boat dragging behind, she thanked   Providence for the impulse that had urged her to practise with the   crumbs of ore. Then she caught the tow-line, and with a prayer upon   her lips climbed over the edge of the ship. 
  An inch at a time she lowered herself until she felt the wash of  the  sea about her feet. The rope cut into her tender hands, but as the   water came higher she gripped the line still more determinedly.   Gradually the water came to her knees, and she groped with one hand   for the boat. She could just touch it, and sank to her waist before   she could reach over into it. With a supreme effort she raised herself   out of the sea, pulling on the taut line with one arm and lifting on   the gunwale with the other, until, dripping and exhausted, she fell   headlong into the skiff. For a brief interval she rested. Then,   drawing a knife from her bosom, she crouched in the bottom of the   skiff, and waited, with her eyes on the rail of the ship towering   above her. 
  From the bow of the schooner McEwen, peering into the after-deck,  had  seen Captain Jenks leave the wheel and his wife run into the  stern.  Now he walked slowly back along the starboard rail, while from  the  ship's centre of gloom the captain eyed him like a wolf. Several  times  McEwen half climbed the vessel's side, and each time slipped  back, as  if lacking the nerve to launch himself into the sea.  Gradually he  approached the stern. The master of the ship followed  stealthily,  cursing under his breath at the other's cowardice and with  the desire  growing in him come up behind McEwen and end it all  himself. For  several minutes the shackled man stood leaning over the  aft rail. The  captain watched him closely and saw him motioning with  his iron hands.  He crept nearer, as McEwen raised himself, and like  animal prepared to  rush upon him if he faltered this time. But there  was something  terribly deliberate about McEwen's actions now. He  climbed upon the  rail, and for a full half-minute stood poised there.  Suddenly he  leaped out into the blackness that hung over the sea, and  the man on  deck could hear the plunge of his body in the wash behind.  Without a  shudder at the tragedy he witnessed the master of the ship  returned to  the wheel, lighted his pipe, and waited for Jim Falkner. 
  Out in the darkness the schooner's skiff was drifting. In it was   McEwen's wife, pulling frantically at a rope which was dragging   something up out of the sea. Soon a man appeared at the edge of the   craft, like a fish at the end of a line, and two helpless hands, with   iron cuffs about their wrists, were held up to the woman. Shortly   after this there were two people in the little skiff, and the joyful   sobs of a woman mingled with the tender love-talk of a man in the   Peaceful quiet of the night.
