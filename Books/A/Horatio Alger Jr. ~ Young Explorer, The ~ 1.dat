     &quot;I've settled up your father's estate, Benjamin,&quot; said Job Stanton.   &quot;You'll find it all figgered out on this piece of paper. There was   that two-acre piece up at Rockville brought seventy-five dollars,  the  medder fetched a hundred and fifty, the two cows&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;How much does it all come to, Uncle Job?&quot; interrupted Ben, who was   impatient of details. 
  &quot;Hadn't you better let me read off the items, nephew?&quot; asked Job,   looking over his spectacles. 
  &quot;No, Uncle Job. I know you've done your best for me, and there's no   need of your going through it all. How much is there left after all   expenses are paid?&quot; 
  &quot;That's what I was a-comin' to, Ben. I make it out that there's   three hundred and sixty-five dollars and nineteen cents. That's a   dollar for every day in the year. It's a good deal of money, Ben.&quot; 
  &quot;So it is, Uncle Job,&quot; answered Ben, and he was quite sincere.  There  are not many boys of sixteen to whom this would not seem a large   sum. 
  &quot;You're rich; that is, for a boy,&quot; added Uncle Job. 
  &quot;It's more than I expected, uncle. I want you to take fifteen   dollars and nineteen cents. That'll leave me just three hundred and   fifty.&quot; 
  &quot;Why should I take any of your money, nephew?&quot; 
  &quot;You've had considerable trouble in settling up the estate, and  it's  taken a good deal of your time, too.&quot; 
  &quot;My time ain't of much vally, and as to the trouble, it's a pity ef   I can't take some trouble for my brother's son. No, Ben, I won't  take  a cent. You'll need it all.&quot; 
  &quot;But you said yourself it was a good deal of money for a boy, Uncle   Job.&quot; 
  &quot;So it is, but it's all you've got. Most boys have fathers to take   care of 'em, while you're alone in the world.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes I am alone in the world,&quot; said Ben sadly, his cheerful face   clouding over. 
  &quot;But you've got an uncle, lad,&quot; continued Job Stanton, laying his   hand gently on the boy's shoulder. &quot;He's a poor man, but as much as   in him lies, he'll be your friend and helper.&quot; 
  &quot;I know it, Uncle Job. You've always been kind to me.&quot; 
  &quot;And allus will be, Ben. Now, Ben, I've got a plan for you. I don't   know what you'll think of it, but it's the best I've been able to   think of.&quot; 
  &quot;What is it, Uncle Job?&quot; 
  &quot;Ef you'll stay with me and help me in the shop, I'll give you a   home, such as it is, and fifty dollars a year toward your clothes.   Your Aunt Hannah and your Cousin Jane want you to make your home  with  us.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm very much obliged to you, Uncle Job,&quot; said Ben slowly. 
  &quot;You needn't be, boy. It's a sort of mutooal arrangement. It'll be   as good for me as for you. You can put your money in the bank, and   let it stay till you're twenty-one. Why, it'll be nigh on to five   hunderd dollars by that time.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm much obliged to you, Uncle Job, as I said before, but there's   one thing in the way.&quot; 
  &quot;What's that, Ben?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't like shoemaking.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps it isn't genteel enough for you, Ben,&quot; said his uncle. 
  &quot;I don't care for that, Uncle Job, but I don't like being shut up  in  a shop. Besides, it doesn't give steady work. Last year you were   without work at least a third of the time.&quot; 
  &quot;So I was, Ben,&quot; said Job. &quot;I'm willin' to own that's a great   drawback.&quot; 
  &quot;And it isn't likely to be any better hereafter. Last year was as   good as the average.&quot; 
  &quot;It was better,&quot; Job admitted. &quot;The year before I was out of work   five months.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, Uncle Job, I want to work at something that'll give me   employment all the year round.&quot; 
  &quot;So do I, Ben, but I don't see what you can find, unless you go to   work on a farm. You're used to that, and I guess you could find a   chance before long. There's Deacon Pitkin wants a boy, and would be   glad of the chance of gettin' you.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose he would,&quot; said Ben, laughing. &quot;Would you advise me to  go  there?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, there might be some objections, but-&quot; 
  &quot;You know I wouldn't get enough to eat, Uncle Job,&quot; interrupted   Ben. &quot;Why, Deacon Pitkin's the meanest man in the village.&quot; 
  &quot;You mustn't be hasty in your judgments, nephew.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm not. I know what I'm talking about. I worked for the deacon  two  days once. He gave me ten cents a day and board-and such board!  Why,  I got up from the table hungry every meal, and yet the deacon   reported afterward that I was a great eater. Mrs. Pitkin cuts a  small  pie into eight pieces, each about two mouthfuls, and when I  asked for  a second piece, she asked if I was allowed to have two  pieces at  home.&quot; 
  &quot;What did you say?&quot; asked Uncle Job, evidently amused. 
  &quot;I said yes, and that each piece was twice as big as she gave.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm afraid that was rather forward, Ben. Did she say anything to   that?&quot; 
  &quot;She said I must be very greedy, and that boys always ate more'n  was  good for 'em. No, Uncle Job, I don't care to work for Deacon   Pitkin.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you formed any plans, Ben? You don't want to go on a farm,  and  you don't want to go into a shoeshop, and that's about all you can   find to do in Hampton.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't mean to stay in Hampton,&quot; said Ben quietly. 
  &quot;Don't mean to stay in Hampton!&quot; exclaimed Uncle Joe, amazed. 
  &quot;No, uncle. There's a good many places besides Hampton in the   world.&quot; 
  &quot;So there is, Ben,&quot; answered Uncle Job, with a disregard of grammar   more excusable than his nephew's, for he had never had any special   educational advantages,-&quot;so there is, but you don't know anybody in   them other places.&quot; 
  &quot;It won't take me long to get acquainted,&quot; returned Ben, not at all   disturbed by this consideration. 
  &quot;Where do you want to go?&quot; 
  &quot;I want to go to California.&quot; 
  &quot;Gracious sakes! Want to go to California!&quot; gasped Job. &quot;What put   that idee into your head?&quot; 
  &quot;A good many people are going there, and there's a chance to get   rich quick out among the gold-mines.&quot; 
  &quot;But you're only a boy.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm a pretty large boy, Uncle Job,&quot; said Ben complacently, &quot;and  I'm  pretty strong.&quot; 
  &quot;So you be, Ben, but it takes more than strength.&quot; 
  &quot;What more, Uncle Job?&quot; 
  &quot;It takes judgment.&quot; 
  &quot;Can't a boy have judgment?&quot; 
  &quot;Waal, he may have some, but you don't often find an old head on   young shoulders.&quot; 
  &quot;I know all that, uncle, but I can work if I am a boy.&quot; 
  &quot;I know you're willin' to work, Ben, but it'll cost a sight of  money  to get out to Californy to start with.&quot; 
  &quot;I know that. It will take two hundred dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;And that's more'n half of all you've got. It seems to me temptin'   Providence to spend such a sight of money for the chance of earning   some on t'other side of the world, when you can get a livin' here  and  put all your money in the bank.&quot; 
  &quot;In five years it would only amount to five hundred dollars, and if   I go to California, I expect to be worth a good deal more than that   before two years are past.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm afraid you've got large idees, Ben.&quot; 
  &quot;You won't interfere with my going, Uncle Job?&quot; asked Ben  anxiously. 
  &quot;I won't actooly interfere, but I'll do all I can to have you give   it up.&quot; 
  &quot;But if my mind is set upon it, you'll let me go, won't you,  uncle?&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose I must,&quot; said Job Stanton. &quot;A wilful lad must have his   way. But you mustn't blame me if things turn out unlucky.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I shall only blame myself.&quot; 
  &quot;There's one promise you must make me,&quot; said his uncle. 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; 
  &quot;Take a week to consider whether you hadn't better take my advice   and stay at home.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, uncle, I'll promise that.&quot; 
  &quot;And you'll think it over in all its bearin's?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, uncle.&quot; 
  &quot;It ain't best to take any important step without reflection, Ben.&quot;   &quot;You're right, uncle.&quot; 
  This conversation took place in Job Stanton's little shoe-shop,  only  a rod distant from the small, plain house which he had occupied  ever  since he had been married. It was interrupted by the appearance  of a  pretty girl of fourteen, who, presenting herself at the door of  the  shop, called out: 
  &quot;Supper's ready, father.&quot; 
  &quot;So are we, Jennie,&quot; said Ben, promptly. 
  &quot;You are always ready to eat, Ben,&quot; said his cousin, smiling. 
  &quot;That's what Mrs. Pitkin used to think, Jennie. She used to watch   every mouthful I took.&quot;
