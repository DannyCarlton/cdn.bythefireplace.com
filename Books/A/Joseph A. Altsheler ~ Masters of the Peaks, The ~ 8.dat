  The Owl, with his warriors and captive, descended in time into the  low country in the northwest. They, too, had been on snowshoes, but now  they discarded them, since they were entering a region in which little  snow had fallen, the severity of the weather abating greatly. Robert  was still treated well, though guarded with the utmost care. The  Indians, who seemed to be from some tribe about the Great Lakes, did  not speak any dialect he knew, and, if they understood English, they  did not use it. He was compelled to do all his talking with the Owl  who, however, was not at all taciturn. Robert saw early that while a  wonderful woodsman and a born partisan leader, he was also a Gascon,  vain, boastful and full of words. He tried to learn from him something  about his possible fate, but he could obtain no hint, until they had  been traveling more than three weeks, and Langlade had been mellowed by  an uncommonly good supper of tender game, which the Indians had cooked  for him.
  &#8220;You've been trying to draw that information out of me ever since  you were captured,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You were indirect and clever about it,  but I noticed it. I, Charles Langlade, have perceptions, you must  understand. If I do live in the woods I can read the minds of white  men.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know you can,&#8221; said Robert, smilingly. &#8220;I observed from the first  that you had an acute intellect.&#8221;
  &#8220;Your judgment does you credit, my young friend. I did not tell you  what I was going to do with you, because I did not know myself. I know  more about you than you think I do. One of my warriors was with  Tandakora in several of his battles with you and Willet, that mighty  hunter whom the Indians call the Great Bear, and Tayoga, the Onondaga,  who is probably following on our trail in the hope of rescuing you. I  have also heard of you from others. Oh, as I tell you, I, Charles  Langlade, take note of all things. You are a prisoner of importance. I  would not give you to Tandakora, because he would burn you, and a man  does not burn valuable goods. I would not send you to St. Luc, because,  being a generous man, he might take some foolish notion to exchange  you, or even parole you. I would not give you to the Marquis Duquesne  at Quebec, because then I might lose my pawn in the game, and, in any  event, the Marquis Duquesne is retiring as Governor General of New  France.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is that true? I have met him. He seemed to me to be a great man.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps he is, but he was too haughty and proud for the powerful  men who dwelt at Quebec, and who control New France. I have heard  something of your appearance at the capital with the Great Bear and the  Onondaga, and of what chanced at Bigot's ball, and elsewhere. Ah, you  see, as I told you, I, Charles Langlade, know all things! But to  return, the Marquis Duquesne gives way to the Marquis de Vaudreuil. Oh,  that was accomplished some time ago, and perhaps you know of it. So, I  do not wish to give you to the Marquis de Vaudreuil. I might wait and  present you to the Marquis de Montcalm when he comes, but that does not  please me, either, and thus I have about decided to present you to the  Dove.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Dove! Who is the Dove?&#8221;
  Langlade laughed with intense enjoyment.
  &#8220;The Dove,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;is a woman, none other than Madame de  Langlade herself, a Huron. You English do not marry Indian women  often&#8212;and yet Colonel William Johnson has taken a Mohawk to wife&#8212;but  we French know them and value them. Do not think to have an easy and  careless jailer when you are put in the hands of the Dove. She will  guard you even more zealously than I, Charles Langlade, and you will  notice that I have neither given you any opportunity to escape nor your  friend, Tayoga, the slightest chance to rescue you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is true, Monsieur Langlade. I've abandoned any such hope on the  march, although I may elude you later.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Dove, as I told you, will attend to that. But it will be a  pretty play of wits, and I don't mind the test. I'm aware that you have  intelligence and skill, but the Dove, though a woman, possesses the wit  of a great chief, and I'll match her against you.&#8221;
  There was a further abatement of the weather, and they reached a  region where there was no snow at all. Warm winds blew from the  direction of the Great Lakes and the band traveled fast through a land  in which the game almost walked up to their rifles to be killed, such  plenty causing the Indians, as usual, now that they were not on the war  path, to feast prodigiously before huge fires, Langlade often joining  them, and showing that he was an adept in Indian customs.
  One evening, just as they were about to light the fire, the warrior  who had been posted as sentinel at the edge of the forest gave a signal  and a few moments later a tall, spare figure in a black robe with a  belt about the waist appeared. Robert's heart gave a great leap. The  wearer of the black robe was an elderly man with a thin face, ascetic  and high. The captive recognized him at once. It was Father Philibert  Drouillard, the priest, whose life had already crossed his more than  once, and it was not strange to see him there, as the French priests  roamed far through the great wilderness of North America, seeking to  save the souls of the savages.
  Langlade, when he beheld Father Drouillard, sprang at once to his  feet, and Robert also arose quickly. The priest saw young Lennox, but  he did not speak to him just yet, accepting the food that the Owl  offered him, and sitting down with his weary feet to the fire that had  now been lighted.
  &#8220;You have traveled far, Father?&#8221; said Langlade, solicitously.
  &#8220;From the shores of Lake Huron. I have converts there, and I must  see that they do not grow weak in the faith.&#8221;
  &#8220;All men, red and white, respect Philibert Drouillard. Why are you  alone, Father?&#8221;
  &#8220;A runner from the Christian village came with me until yesterday.  Then I sent him back, because I would not keep him too long from his  people. I can go the rest of the way alone, as it will be but a few  days before I meet a French force.&#8221;
  Then he turned to Robert for the first time.
  &#8220;And you, my son,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am sorry it has fared thus with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It has not gone badly, Father,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Monsieur de Langlade  has treated me well. I have naught to complain of save that I'm a  prisoner.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a good lad, Charles Langlade,&#8221; said the priest to the  partisan, &#8220;and I am glad he has suffered no harm at your hands. What do  you purpose to do with him?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is my present plan to take him to the village in which Madame  Langlade, otherwise the Dove, abides. He will be her prisoner until a  further plan develops, and you know how well she watches.&#8221;
  A faint smile passed over the thin face of the priest.
  &#8220;It is true, Charles Langlade,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That which escapes the  eyes of the Dove is very small, but I would take the lad with me to  Montreal.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nay, Father, that cannot be. I am second to nobody in respect for  Holy Church, and for you, Father Drouillard, whose good deeds are known  to all, and whose bad deeds are none, but those who fight the war must  use their judgment in fighting it, and the prisoners are theirs.&#8221;
  Father Drouillard sighed.
  &#8220;It is so, Charles Langlade,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but, as I have said, the  prisoner is a good youth. I have met him before, as I told you, and I  would save him. You know not what may happen in the Indian village, if  you chance to be away.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Dove will have charge of him. She can be trusted.&#8221;
  &#8220;And yet I would take him with me to Montreal. He will give his  parole that he will not attempt to escape on the way. It is the custom  for prisoners to be ransomed. I will send to you from Montreal five  golden louis for him.&#8221;
  Langlade shook his head.
  &#8220;Ten golden louis,&#8221; said Father Drouillard.
  &#8220;Nay, Father, it is no use,&#8221; said the partisan. &#8220;I cannot be tempted  to exchange him for money.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fifteen golden louis, Charles Langlade, though I may have to borrow  from the funds of the Church to send them to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I respect your motive, Father, but 'tis impossible. This is a  prisoner of great value and I must use him as a pawn in the game of  war. He was taken fairly and I cannot give him up.&#8221;
  Again Father Drouillard sighed, and this time heavily.
  &#8220;I would save you from captivity, Mr. Lennox,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but, as you  see, I cannot.&#8221;
  Robert was much moved.
  &#8220;I thank you, Father Drouillard, for your kind intentions,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;It may be that some day I shall have a chance to repay them.  Meanwhile, I do not dread the coming hospitality of Madame Langlade.&#8221;
  The priest shook his head sadly.
  &#8220;It is a great and terrible war,&#8221; he said, &#8220;though I cannot doubt  that France will prevail, but I fear for you, my son, a captive in the  vast wilderness. Although you are an enemy and a heretic I have only  good feeling for you, and I know that the great Chevalier, St. Luc,  also regards you with favor.&#8221;
  &#8220;Know you anything of St. Luc?&#8221; asked Robert eagerly.
  &#8220;Only that the expedition he was to lead against Albany has turned  back and that he has gone to Canada to fight under the banner of  Montcalm, when he comes with the great leaders, De Levis, Bourlamaque  and the others.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought I might meet him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not here, with Charles Langlade.&#8221;
  The priest spent the night with them and in the morning, after  giving them his blessing, captors and captive alike, he departed on his  long and solitary journey to Montreal.
  &#8220;A good man,&#8221; said Robert, as he watched his tall, thin figure  disappear in the surrounding forest.
  &#8220;Truly spoken,&#8221; said the Owl. &#8220;I am little of a churchman myself,  the forest and the war trail please me better, but the priests are a  great prop to France in the New World. They carry with them the  authority of His Majesty, King Louis.&#8221;
  A week later they reached a small Indian village on Lake Ontario  where the Owl at present made his abode, and in the largest lodge of  which his patient spouse, the Dove, was awaiting him. She was young,  much taller than the average Indian woman, and, in her barbaric  fashion, quite handsome. But her face was one of the keenest and most  alert Robert had ever seen. All the trained observation of countless  ancestors seemed stored in her and now he understood why Langlade had  boasted so often and so warmly of her skill as a guard. She regarded  him with a cold eye as she listened attentively to her husband's  instructions, and, for the remainder of that winter and afterward, she  obeyed them with a thoroughness beyond criticism.
  The village included perhaps four hundred souls, of whom about a  hundred were warriors. Langlade was king and Madame Langlade, otherwise  the Dove, was queen, the two ruling with absolute sovereignty, their  authority due to their superior intelligence and will and to the  service they rendered to the little state, because a state it was,  organized completely in all its parts, although composed of only a few  hundred human beings. In the bitter weather that came again, Langlade  directed the hunting in the adjacent forest and the fishing conducted  on the great lake. He also made presents from time to time of gorgeous  beads or of huge red or yellow blankets that had been sent from  Montreal. Robert could not keep from admiring his diplomacy and tact,  and now he understood more thoroughly than ever how the French  partisans made themselves such favorites with the wild Indians.
  His own position in the village was tentative. Langlade still seemed  uncertain what to do with him, and held him meanwhile for a possible  reward of great value. He was never allowed to leave the cluster of  tepees for the forest, except with the warriors, but he took part in  the fishing on the lake, being a willing worker there, because idleness  grew terribly irksome, and, when he had nothing to do, he chafed over  his long captivity. He slept in a small tepee built against that of  Monsieur and Madame Langlade, and from which there was no egress save  through theirs.
  He was enclosed only within walls of skin, and he believed that he  might have broken a way through them, but he felt that the eyes of the  Dove were always on him. He even had the impression that she was  watching him while he slept, and sometimes he dreamed that she was  fanged and clawed like a tigress.
  Langlade went away once, being gone a long time, and while he was  absent the Dove redoubled her watchfulness. Robert's singular  impression that her eyes were always on him was strengthened, and these  eyes were increased to the hundred of Argus and more. It became so  oppressive that he was always eager to go out with the warriors in  their canoes for the fishing. On Lake Ontario he was sure the eyes of  the Dove could not reach him, but the work was arduous and often  perilous. The great lake was not to be treated lightly. Often it took  toll of the Indians who lived around its shores. Winter storms came up  suddenly, the waves rolled like those of the sea, freezing spray dashed  over them, and it required a supreme exertion of both skill and  strength to keep the light canoes from being swamped.
  Yet Robert was always happier on water than on land. On shore,  confined closely and guarded zealously, his imaginative temperament  suffered and he became moody and depressed, but on the lakes, although  still a captive, he felt the winds of freedom. When the storms came and  the icy blasts swept down upon them he responded, body and soul. Relief  and freedom were to be found in the struggle with the elements and he  always went back to shore refreshed and stronger of spirit and flesh.  He also had a feeling that Tayoga might come by way of the lake, and  when he was with the little Indian fleet he invariably watched the  watery horizon for a lone canoe, but he never saw any.
  The absence of news from his friends, and from the world to which  they belonged, was the most terrible burden of all. If the Indians had  news they told him none. He seemed to have vanished completely. But,  however numerous may have been his moments of despondency, he was not  made of the stuff that yields. The flexible steel always rebounded. He  took thorough care of his health and strength. In his close little  tepee he flexed and tensed his muscles and went through physical  exercises every night and morning, but it was on the lake in the  fishing, where the Indians grew to recognize his help, that he achieved  most. Fighting the winds, the water and the cold, he felt his muscles  harden and his chest enlarge, and he would say to himself that when the  spring came and he escaped he would be more fit for the life of a free  forest runner than he had ever been before. Langlade, when he returned,  took notice of his increased size and strength and did not withhold  approval.
  &#8220;I like any prisoner of mine to flourish,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;The more  superior you become the greater will be the reward for me when I  dispose of you. You have found the Dove all I promised you she should  be, haven't you, Monsieur Lennox?&#8221;
  &#8220;All and more,&#8221; replied Robert. &#8220;Although she may be out of sight I  feel that her eyes are always on me, and this is true of the night as  well as the day.&#8221;
  &#8220;A great woman, the Dove, and a wife to whom I give all credit. If  it should come into the king's mind to call me to Versailles and bestow  upon me some kind of an accolade perhaps Madame Langlade would not feel  at home in the great palace nor at the Grand Trianon, nor even at the  Little Trianon, and maybe I wouldn't either. But since no such idea  will enter His Majesty's mind, and I have no desire to leave the great  forests, the Dove is a perfect wife for me. She is the true wilderness  helpmate, accomplished in all the arts of the life I live and love, and  with the eye and soul of a warrior. I repeat, young Monsieur Lennox,  where could I find a wife more really sublime?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nowhere, Monsieur Langlade. The more I see you two together the  more nearly I think you are perfectly matched.&#8221;
  The Owl seemed pleased with the recognition of his marital felicity,  and grew gracious, dropping some crumbs of information for Robert. He  had been to Montreal and the arrival of the great soldier, the Marquis  de Montcalm, with fresh generals and fresh troops from France, was  expected daily at Quebec. The English, although their fleets were  larger, could not intercept them, and it was now a certainty that the  spring campaign would sweep over Albany and almost to New York. He  spoke with so much confidence, in truth with such an absolute  certainty, that Robert's heart sank and then came back again with a  quick rebound.
  After a winter that had seemed to the young captive an age, spring  came with a glorious blossoming and blooming. The wilderness burst into  green and the great lake shining in the sun became peaceful and  friendly. Warm winds blew out of the west and the blood flowed more  swiftly in human veins. But spring passed and summer came. Then  Langlade announced that he would depart with the best of the warriors,  and that Robert would go with him, although he refused absolutely to  say where or for what purpose.
  Robert's joy was dimmed in nowise by his ignorance of his  destination. He had not found the remotest chance to escape while in  the village, but it might come on the march, and there was also a  relief and pleasant excitement in entering the wilderness again. He  joyously made ready, the Dove gave her lord and equal, not her master,  a Spartan farewell, and the formidable band, Robert in the center,  plunged into the forest.
  When the great mass of green enclosed them he felt a mighty surge of  hope. His imaginative temperament was on fire. A chance for him would  surely come. Tayoga might be hidden in the thickets. Action brought  renewed courage. Langlade, who was watching him, smiled.
  &#8220;I read your mind, young Monsieur Lennox,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Have I not told  you that I, Charles Langlade, have the perceptions? Do I not see and  interpret everything?&#8221;
  &#8220;Then what do you see and interpret now?&#8221;
  &#8220;A great hope in your heart that you will soon bid us farewell. You  think that when we are deep in the forest it will not be difficult to  elude our watch. And yet you could not escape when we were going  through this same forest to the village. Now why do you think it will  be easier when you are going through it again, but away?&#8221;
  &#8220;The Dove is not at the end of the march. Her eyes will no longer be  upon me.&#8221;
  The Owl laughed deeply and heartily.
  &#8220;You're a lad of sense,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when you lay such a tribute at  the feet of that incomparable woman, that model wife, that true  helpmate in every sense of the word. Why should you be anxious to leave  us? I could have you adopted into the tribe, and you know the ceremony  of adoption is sacred with the Indians. And let me whisper another  little fact in your ear which will surely move you. The Dove has a  younger sister, so much like her that they are twins in character if  not in years. She will soon be of marriageable age, and she shall be  reserved for you. Think! Then you will be my brother-in-law and the  brother-in-law of the incomparable Dove.&#8221;
  &#8220;No! No!&#8221; exclaimed Robert hastily.
  Now the laughter of the Owl was uncontrollable. His face writhed and  his sides shook.
  &#8220;A lad does not recognize his own good!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;or is it  bashfulness? Nay, don't be afraid, young Monsieur Lennox! Perhaps I  could get the Dove to intercede for you!&#8221;
  Robert was forced to smile.
  &#8220;I thank you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I am far from the marriageable age  myself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then the Dove and I are not to have you for a brother-in-law?&#8221; said  Langlade. &#8220;You show little appreciation, young Monsieur Lennox, when it  is so easy for you to become a member of such an interesting family.&#8221;
  Robert was confirmed in his belief that there was much of the wild  man in the Owl, who in many respects had become more Indian than the  Indians. He was a splendid trailer, a great hunter, and the hardships  of the forest were nothing to him. He read every sign of the wilderness  and yet he retained all that was French also, lightness of manner,  gayety, quick wit and a politeness that never failed. It is likely that  the courage and tenacity of the French leaders were never shown to  better advantage than in the long fight they made for dominion in North  America. Despite the fact that he was an enemy, and his belief that  Langlade could be ruthless, on occasion, Robert was compelled to like  him.
  The journey, the destination yet unknown to him, was long, but it  was not tedious to the young prisoner. He watched the summer progress  and the colors deepen and he was cheered continually by the hope of  escape, a fact that Langlade recognized and upon which he commented in  a detached manner, from time to time. Now and then the leader himself  went ahead with a scout or two and one morning he said to Robert:
  &#8220;I saw something in the forest last night.&#8221;
  &#8220;The forest contains much,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;But this was of especial interest to you. It was the trace of a  footstep, and I am convinced it was made by your friend Tayoga, the  Onondaga. Doubtless he is seeking to effect your escape.&#8221;
  Robert's heart gave a leap, and there was a new light in his eyes,  of which the shrewd Owl took notice.
  &#8220;I have heard of the surpassing skill of the Onondaga,&#8221; he  continued, &#8220;but I, Charles Langlade, have skill of my own. It will be  some time before we arrive at the place to which we are going, and I  lay you a wager that Tayoga does not rescue you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have no money, Monsieur Langlade,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and if I had I  could not accept a wager upon such a subject.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll let it be mental, wholly. My skill is matched against  the combined knowledge of Tayoga and yourself. He'll never be able, no  matter how dark the night, to get near our camp and communicate with  you.&#8221;
  Although Robert hoped and listened often in the dusk for the sound  of a signal from Tayoga, Langlade made good his boast. The two were  able to establish no communication. It was soon proved that he was in  the forest near them, one of the warriors even catching a sufficient  glimpse of his form for a shot, which, however, went wild. The Onondaga  did not reply, and, despite the impossibility of reaching him, Robert  was cheered by the knowledge that he was near. He had a faithful and  powerful friend who would help him some day, be it soon or late.
  The summer was well advanced when Langlade announced that their  journey was done.
  &#8220;Before night,&#8221; he said triumphantly, &#8220;we will be in the camp of the  Marquis de Montcalm, and we will meet the great soldier himself. I,  Charles Langlade, told you that it would be so, and it is so.&#8221;
  &#8220;What, Montcalm near?&#8221; exclaimed Robert, aflame with interest.
  &#8220;Look at the sky above the tops of those trees in the east and you  will see a smudge of smoke, beneath which stand the tents of the French  army.&#8221;
  &#8220;The French army here! And what is it doing in the wilderness?&#8221;
  &#8220;That, young Monsieur Lennox, rests on the knees of the gods. I have  some curiosity on the subject myself.&#8221;
  An hour or two later they came within sight of the French camp, and  Robert saw that it was a numerous and powerful force for time and  place. The tents stood in rows, and soldiers, both French and Canadian,  were everywhere, while many Indian warriors were on the outskirts. A  large white marquee near the center he was sure was that of the  commander-in-chief, and he was eager to see at once the famous  Montcalm, of whom he was hearing so much. But to his intense  disappointment, Langlade went into camp with the Indians.
  &#8220;The Marquis de Montcalm is a great man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the  commander-in-chief of all the forces of His Majesty, King Louis, in  North America, and even I, Charles Langlade, will not approach him  without ceremony. We will rest in the edge of the forest, and when he  hears that I have come he will send for me, because he will want to  know many things which none other can tell him. And it may be, young  Monsieur Lennox, that, in time, he will wish to see you also.&#8221;
  So Robert waited with as much patience as he could muster, although  he slept but little that night, the noises in the great French camp and  his own curiosity keeping him awake. What was Montcalm doing so far  from the chief seats of the French power in Canada, and did the English  and Americans know that he was here?
  Curiously enough he had little apprehension for himself, it was  rather a feeling of joy that he had returned to the world of great  affairs. Soon he would know what had been occurring during the long  winter when he was buried in an Indian village, and he might even hear  of Willet. Toward dawn he slept a little, and after daylight he was  awakened by Langlade who was as assured and talkative as usual.
  &#8220;It may be, my gallant young prisoner,&#8221; he said, ruffling and  strutting, &#8220;that I am about to lose you, but if it is so it will be for  value received. I, Charles Langlade, have seen the great Marquis de  Montcalm, but it was an equal speaking to an equal. It was last night  in his grand marquee, where he sat surrounded by his trusted  lieutenants, De Levis, St. Luc, Bourlamaque, Coulon de Villiers and the  others. But I was not daunted at all. I repeat that it was an equal  speaking to an equal, and the Marquis was pleased to commend me for the  work I have already done for France.&#8221;
  &#8220;And St. Luc was there?&#8221;
  &#8220;He was. The finest figure of them all. A brave and generous man and  a great leader. He stood at the right hand of the Marquis de Montcalm,  while I talked and he listened with attention, because the Chevalier de  St. Luc is always willing to learn from others. No false pride about  him! And the Marquis de Montcalm is like him. I gave the  commander-in-chief much excellent advice which he accepted with  gratitude, and in return for you, whom he expects to put to use, he has  raised me in rank, and has extended my authority over the western  tribes. Ah, I knew that you were a prize when I captured you, and I was  wise to save you as a pawn.&#8221;
  &#8220;How can I be of any value to the Marquis de Montcalm?&#8221;
  &#8220;That is to be seen. He knows his own plans best. You are to come  with me at once into his presence.&#8221;
  Robert was immediately in a great stir. He straightened out, and,  with his hands, brushed his own clothing, smoothed his hair, intending,  with his usual desire for neatness, to make the best possible  appearance before the French leader.
  After breakfast Langlade took him to the great marquee in which  Montcalm sat, as the morning was cool, and when their names had been  taken in a young officer announced that they might enter, the officer,  to Robert's great surprise, being none other than De Galissonniere, who  showed equal amazement at meeting him there. The Frenchman gave him a  hearty grasp of the hand in English fashion, but they did not have time  to say anything.
  Robert, walking by the side of Langlade, entered the great tent with  some trepidation, and beheld a swarthy man of middle years, in the  uniform of a general of France, giving orders to two officers who stood  respectfully at attention. Neither of the officers was St. Luc, nor  were they among those whom Robert had seen at Quebec. He surmised,  however, that they were De Levis and Bourlamaque, and he learned soon  that he was right. Langlade paused until Montcalm was ready to speak to  him, and Robert stood in silence at his side. Montcalm finished what he  had to say and turned his eyes upon the young prisoner. His countenance  was mild, but Robert felt that his gaze was searching.
  &#8220;And this, Captain Langlade,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the youth of whom you  were speaking?&#8221;
  So the Owl had been made a captain, and the promotion had been one  of his rewards. Robert was not sorry.
  &#8220;It is the one, sir,&#8221; replied Langlade, &#8220;young Monsieur Robert  Lennox. He has been a prisoner in my village all the winter, and he has  as friends some of the most powerful people in the British Colonies.&#8221;
  Montcalm continued to gaze at Robert as if he would read his soul.
  &#8220;Sit down, Mr. Lennox,&#8221; he said, not unkindly, motioning him to a  little stool. Robert took the indicated seat and so quick is youth to  warm to courtesy that he felt respect and even liking for the Marquis,  official and able enemy though he knew him to be. De Levis and  Bourlamaque also were watching him with alert gaze, but they said  nothing.
  &#8220;I hear,&#8221; continued Montcalm, with a slight smile, &#8220;that you have  not suffered in Captain Langlade's village, and that you have adapted  yourself well to wild life.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've had much experience with the wilderness,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Most  of my years have been passed there, and it was easy for me to live as  Captain Langlade lived. I've no complaint to make of his treatment,  though I will say that he has guarded me well.&#8221;
  Montcalm laughed.
  &#8220;It agrees with Captain Langlade's own account,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suppose  that one must be born, or at least pass his youth in it, to get the way  of this vast wilderness. We of old Europe, where everything has been  ruled and measured for many centuries, can have no conception of it  until we see it, and even then we do not understand it. Although with  an army about me I feel lost in so much forest. But enough of that. It  is of yourself and not of myself that I wish to speak. I have heard  good reports of you from one of my own officers, who, though he has  been opposed to you many times, nevertheless likes you.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Chevalier de St. Luc!&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, the Chevalier de St. Luc. I know, also, that you have been in  the councils of some of the Colonial leaders. You are a friend of Sir  William Johnson.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel William Johnson?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, Sir William Johnson. In reward for the affair at Lake George,  in which our Dieskau was unfortunate, he has been made a baronet by the  British king.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad.&#8221;
  &#8220;And doubtless Sir William is also. You know him well, I understand,  and he was still at the lake when you left on the journey that led to  your capture.&#8221;
  Robert was silent.
  &#8220;I have not asked you to answer,&#8221; continued Montcalm, &#8220;but I assume  that it is so. His army, although it was victorious in the battle  there, did not advance. There was much disagreement among the governors  of the British Colonies. The provinces could not be induced to act  together?&#8221;
  Robert was still silent.
  &#8220;Again I say I am not asking you to answer, but your silence  confirms the truth of our reports.&#8221;
  Robert flushed, and a warm reply trembled on his lips, but he  restrained the words. A swift smile passed over the dark face of  Montcalm.
  &#8220;You see, Mr. Lennox,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I am not asking you to say  anything, but there was great disappointment among the British  Colonials because there was no advance after the battle at the lake. It  has also cooled the enthusiasm of the Iroquois, many of whom have gone  home and who perhaps will take no further part in the war as the allies  of the English.&#8221;
  Again Robert flushed and again he bit back the hot reply. He looked  uneasily at De Levis and Bourlamaque, but their faces expressed  nothing. Then Montcalm suddenly changed the subject.
  &#8220;I am going to make you a very remarkable offer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and do  not think for a moment it is going to imply any change of colors on  your part, or the least suspicion of treason, which I could not ask of  the gentleman you obviously are. I request of you your parole, your  word of honor that you will not take any further part in this war.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't do it! As I have often told Captain Langlade, I intend to  escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is impossible. If you could not do so when you were in Captain  Langlade's village, you have no chance at all now that you are  surrounded by an army. But since you will not give me your parole it  will become necessary to keep you as a prisoner of war, and to send you  to a safe place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Many of our people in this and former wars with the French have  been held prisoners in the Province of Quebec. I know somewhat of the  city of Quebec, and it is not wholly an unpleasant place.&#8221;
  &#8220;I did not have Quebec, either the province or the city, in mind so  far as concerns you, Mr. Lennox. Three of our ships are to return  shortly to France, and, not wishing to give us your parole, you are to  go to France.&#8221;
  &#8220;To France?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, to France. Where else? And you should rejoice. It is a fair  and glorious land. And I have heard there is a spirit in you, Mr.  Lennox, which is almost French, a kindred touch, a Gallic salt and  savor, so to speak.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm wholly American and British.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps there are others who know you better than you know  yourself. I repeat, there is about you a French finish. Why should you  deny it? You should be proud of it. We are the oldest of the great  civilized nations, and the first in culture. Your stay in France should  be very pleasant. You can drink there at the fountain of ancient  culture and glory. The wilderness is magnificent in its way, but high  civilization is magnificent also in its own and another way. You can  see Paris, the city of light, the center of the world, and you can  behold the splendid court of His Majesty, King Louis. That should  appeal to a young man of taste and discernment.&#8221;
  Robert felt a thrill and his pulses leaped, but the thrill lasted  only a moment. It was clearly impossible that he should go even as a  prisoner, though a willing one, to France, and he did not see any  reason why the Marquis de Montcalm should take any personal interest in  his future. But responding invariably to the temperature about him his  manner was now as polite as that of the French general.
  &#8220;You have my thanks, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for the kindly way in which you  offer to treat a prisoner, but it is impossible for me to go to France,  unless you should choose to send me there by sheer force.&#8221;
  The slight smile passed again over the face of the Marquis de  Montcalm.
  &#8220;I fancied, young sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that this would be your answer,  and, being what it is, I cannot say that it has lowered you aught in my  esteem. For the present, you abide with us.&#8221;
  Robert bowed. Montcalm inspired in him a certain liking, and a  decided respect. Then, still under the escort of Langlade, he withdrew.
