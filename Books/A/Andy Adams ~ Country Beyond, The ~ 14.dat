  Jolly Roger did not answer, but crawled through the hole and found   the sledge in the outer darkness. He heard Peter coming after him,   and he saw Porter's bloodless face in the illumination of the  alcohol  lamp, where he waited to help him with the dunnage. In  those seconds  he fought to get a grip on himself. A quarter of an  hour ago he had  laughed at the thought of the law. Never had it  seemed to be so far  away from him, and never had he been more  utterly isolated from the  world. His mind was still a bit dazed by  the thing that had happened.  The police had not trailed him. They  had not ferreted him out, nor had  they stumbled upon him by  accident. It was he who had gone out into  the night and  deliberately dragged them in! Of all the trickery fate  had played  upon him this was the least to be expected. 
  His mind began to work more swiftly as in darkness he cut the   babiche cordage that bound the patrol dunnage to the sledge. &quot;N&quot;   Division, he told himself, was away over in the Athabasca country.  He  had never heard of Porter, nor of Superintendent Tavish, and  inasmuch  as the outfit was evidently a special escort to Fort  Churchill it was  very likely that Porter and his companions would  not be thinking of  outlaws, and especially of Jolly Roger McKay.  This was his one chance.  To attempt an escape through the blizzard  was not only a desperate  hazard. It was death. 
  There were only two packs on the sledge, and these he passed   through the hole to Porter. A few moments later he was holding a   flask of liquor to the lips of the gray-bearded man, while the  girl  looked at him with eyes that were widening as the snow-sting  left  them. Tavish gulped, and his mittened hand closed on the  girl's arm. 
  &quot;I'm all right, Jo,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;All right&#8212;&quot; 
  His eyes met McKay's, and then took in the snow walls of the dug-   out. They were deep, piercing eyes, overhung by shaggy brows.  Jolly  Roger felt the intentness of their gaze as he gave the girl  a swallow  of the brandy, and then passed the flask to Porter. 
  &quot;You have saved our lives,&quot; said Tavish, in a voice that was   clearer. &quot;I don't just understand how it happened. I remember   stumbling in the darkness, and being unable to rise. I was behind  the  sledge. Porter and Breault were dragging it, and Josephine, my   daughter, was sheltered under the blankets. After that&#8212;&quot; 
  He paused, and Jolly Roger explained how it all had come about. He   pointed to Peter. It was the dog, he said. Peter had insisted  there  was someone outside, and they had taken a chance by going in  search of  them. He was John Cummings, a fox trapper, and the storm  had caught  him fifty miles from his cabin. He was traveling  without a dog-sledge,  and had only a pack-outfit. 
  Breault, the third man, had regained his wind, and was listening   to him. One look at his dark, thin face told McKay that he was the   wilderness man of the three. He was staring at Jolly Roger in a   strange sort of way. And then, as if catching himself, he nodded,  and  began rubbing his frosted face with handfuls of snow. 
  Porter had thrown off his heavy coat, and was unpacking one of the   dunnage sacks. He and the girl seemed to have suffered less than  the  other two. Jo, the girl, was looking at him. And then her eyes  turned  to Jolly Roger. They were large, fine eyes, wide open and  clear now.  There was something of splendid strength about her as  she smiled at  McKay. She was not of the hysterical sort. He could  see that. 
  &quot;If we could have some hot soup,&quot; she suggested. &quot;May we?&quot; 
  There was gratitude in her eyes, which she made no attempt to   express in words. Jolly Roger liked her. And Peter crept up behind   her, and watched her as she followed Breault's example, and rubbed   the cheeks of the bearded man with snow. 
  &quot;There's an alcohol stove in the other pack,&quot; said Breault, with   his hard, narrow eyes fixed steadily on Jolly Roger's face. &quot;By  the  way, what did you say your name was?&quot; 
  &quot;Cummings&#8212;John Cummings.&quot; 
  Breault made no answer. During the next half hour Jolly Roger felt   stealing over him a growing sense of uneasiness. They drank soup  and  ate bannock. It grew warm, and the girl threw off the heavy  fur  garment that enveloped her. Color returned into her cheeks.  Her eyes  were bright, and in her voice was a tremble of happiness  at finding  warmth and life where she had expected death. Porter's  friendliness  was almost brotherly. He explained what had happened.  Two rascally  Chippewyans had deserted them, stealing off into  darkness and storm  with both dog teams and one of their sledges.  After that they had  fought on, seeking for a drift into which they  might dig a refuge. But  the Barren was as smooth as a table. They  had shouted, and Miss Tavish  had screamed&#8212;not because they  expected to find assistance&#8212;but on  account of Tavish falling in  the storm, and losing himself. It was  quite a joke, Porter  thought, that Superintendent Tavish, one of the  iron men of the  service, should have given up the ghost so easily. 
  Tavish smiled grimly. They were all in good humor, and happy, with   the possible exception of Breault. Not once did he laugh or smile.   Yet Jolly Roger noted that each time he spoke the others were   specially attentive. There was something repressive and mysterious   about the man, and the girl would cut herself short in the middle  of  a laugh if he happened to speak, and the softness of her mouth  would  harden in an instant. He understood the significance of her  gladness,  and of Porter's, for twice he saw their hands come  together, and their  fingers entwine. And in their eyes was  something which they could not  hide when they looked at each  other. But Breault puzzled him. He did  not know that Breault was  the best man-hunter in &quot;N&quot; Division, which  reached from Athabasca  Landing to the Arctic Ocean, or that up and  down the two thousand-  mile stretch of the Three River Country he was  known as Shingoos,  the Ferret. 
  The girl fell asleep first that night, with her cheek on her   father's shoulder. Breault, the Ferret, rolled himself in a  blanket,  and breathed deeply. Porter still smoked his pipe, and  looked  wistfully at the pale face of Josephine Tavish. He smiled a  bit  proudly at McKay. 
  &quot;She's mine,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We're going to be married.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger wanted to reach over and grip his hand. 
  He nodded, a little lump coming in his throat. 
  &quot;I know how you feel,&quot; he said. &quot;When I heard her calling out   there&#8212;it made me think&#8212;of a girl down south.&quot; 
  &quot;Down south?&quot; queried Porter. &quot;Why down south&#8212;if you care for   her&#8212;and you up here?&quot; 
  McKay shrugged his shoulders. He had said too much. Neither he nor   Porter knew that Breault's eyes were half open, and that he was   listening. 
  Jolly Roger held up a hand, as if something in the wailing of the   storm had caught his attention. 
  &quot;We'll have two or three days of this. Better turn in, Porter. I'm   going to dig out another room&#8212;for Miss Tavish. I'm afraid she'll   need the convenience of a private room before we're able to move.   It's an easy job&#8212;and passes the time away.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll help,&quot; offered Porter. 
  For an hour they worked, using McKay's snowshoes as shovels.   During that hour Breault did not close his eyes. A curious smile   curled his thin lips as he watched Jolly Roger. And when at last   Porter turned in, and slept, the Ferret sat up, and stretched   himself. McKay had finished his room, and was beginning a tunnel   which would lead as a back door out of the drift, when Breault  came  in and picked up the snowshoe which Porter had used. 
  &quot;I'll take my turn,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm a bit nervous, and not at all   sleepy, Cummings.&quot; He began digging into the snow. &quot;Been long in  this  country?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Three winters. It's a good red fox country, with now and then a   silver and a black.&quot; 
  Breault grunted. 
  &quot;You must have met Cassidy, then,&quot; he said casually, without   looking at McKay. &quot;Corporal Terence Cassidy. This is his country.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger did not look up from his work of digging. 
  &quot;Yes, I know him. Met him last winter. Red headed. A nice chap. I   like him. You know him?&quot; 
  &quot;Entered the service together,&quot; said Breault. &quot;But he's unlucky.   For two or three years he has been on the trail of a man named  McKay.  Jolly Roger, they call him&#8212;Jolly Roger McKay. Ever hear of  him?&quot; 
  Jolly Roger nodded. 
  &quot;Cassidy told me about him when he was at my cabin. From what I've   heard I&#8212;rather like him.&quot; 
  &quot;Who&#8212;Cassidy, or Jolly Roger?&quot; 
  &quot;Both.&quot; 
  For the first time the Ferret leveled his eyes at his companion.   They were mystifying eyes, never appearing to open fully, but   remaining half closed as if to conceal whatever thought might lie   behind them. McKay felt their penetration. It was like a cold  chill  entering into him, warning him of a menace deadlier than the  storm. 
  &quot;Haven't any idea where one might come upon this Jolly Roger, have   you?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;You see, he thinks he killed a man down south. Well, he didn't.   The man lived. If you happen to see him at any time give him that   information, will you?&quot; 
  Jolly Roger thrust his head and shoulders into the growing tunnel. 
  &quot;Yes, I will.&quot; 
  He knew Breault was lying. And also knew that back of the narrow   slits of Breault's eyes was the cunning of a fox. 
  &quot;You might also tell him the law has a mind to forgive him for   sticking up that free trader's post a few years ago.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger turned with his snowshoe piled high with a load of   snow. 
  &quot;I'll tell him that, too,&quot; he said, chuckling at the obviousness   of the other's trap. &quot;What do you think my cabin is, Breault&#8212;a  Rest  for Homeless Outlaws?&quot; 
  Breault grinned. It was an odd sort of grin, and Jolly Roger   caught it over his shoulder. When he returned from dumping his  load,  Breault said: 
  &quot;You see, we know this Jolly Roger fellow is spending the winter   somewhere up here. And Cassidy says there is a girl down south&#8212;&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's face was hidden in the tunnel. 
  &quot;&#8212;who would like to see him,&quot; finished Breault. 
  When McKay turned toward him the Ferret was carelessly lighting   his pipe. 
  &quot;I remember&#8212;Cassidy told me about this girl,&quot; said Jolly Roger.   &quot;He said&#8212;some day&#8212;he would trap this&#8212;this man&#8212;through the  girl.  So if I happen to meet Jolly Roger McKay, and send him back  to the  girl, it will help out the law. Is that it, Breault? And is  there any  reward tacked to it? Anything in it for me?&quot; 
  Breault was looking at him in the pale light of the alcohol lamp,   puffing out tobacco smoke, and with that odd twist of a smile  about  his thin lips. 
  &quot;Listen to the storm,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it's getting worse&#8212;   Cummings!&quot; 
  Suddenly he held out a hand to Peter, who sat near the lamp, his   bright eyes fixed watchfully on the stranger. 
  &quot;Nice dog you have, Cummings. Come here, Peter! Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;&quot; 
  Tight ringers seemed to grip at McKay's throat. He had not spoken   Peter's name since the rescue of Breault. 
  &quot;Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;&quot; 
  The Ferret was smiling affably. But Peter did not move. He made no   response to the outstretched hand. His eyes were steady and   challenging. In that moment McKay wanted to hug him up in his  arms. 
  The Ferret laughed. 
  &quot;He's a good dog, a very good dog, Cummings. I like a one-man dog,   and I also like a one-dog man. That's what Jolly Roger McKay is,  if  you ever happen to meet him. Travels with one dog. An Airedale,  with  whiskers on him like a Mormon. And his name is Peter. Funny  name for a  dog, isn't it?&quot; 
  He faced the outer room, stretching his long arms above his head. 
  &quot;I'm going to try sleep again, Cummings. Goodnight! And&#8212;Mother of   Heaven!&#8212;listen to the wind.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it's a bad night,&quot; said McKay. 
  He looked at Peter when Breault was gone, and his heart was   beating fast. He could hear the wind, too. It was sweeping over  the  Barren more fiercely than before, and the sound of it brought  a steely  glitter into his eyes. This time he could not run away  from the law.  Flight meant death. And Breault knew it. He was in a  trap&#8212;a trap  built by himself. That is, if Breault had guessed the  truth, and he  believed he had. There was only one way out&#8212;and  that meant fight. 
  He went into the outer room for his pack and a blanket. He did not   look at Breault, but he knew the man's narrow eyes were following   him. He left the alcohol lamp burning, but in his own room, after  he  had spread out his bed, he extinguished the light. Then, very  quietly,  he dug a hole through the snow partition between the two  rooms. He  waited for ten minutes before he thrust a finger-tip  through the last  thin crust of snow. With his eye close to the  aperture he could see  Breault. The Ferret was sitting up, and  leaning toward Porter, who was  sleeping an arm's length away. He  reached over, and touched him on the  shoulder. 
  Jolly Roger widened the snow-slit another inch, straining his ears   to hear. He could see Tavish and the girl asleep. In another  moment  Porter was sitting up, with the Ferret's hand gripping his  arm  warningly. Breault motioned toward the inner room, and Porter  was  silent. Then Breault bent over and began to whisper. Jolly  Roger could  hear only the indistinct monotone of his voice. But he  could see very  clearly the change that came into Porter's face.  His eyes widened, and  he stared toward the inner room, making a  movement as if to rouse  Tavish and the girl. 
  The Ferret stopped him. 
  &quot;Don't get excited. Let them sleep.&quot; 
  McKay heard that much&#8212;and no more. For some time after that the   two men sat close together, conversing in whispers. There was an   exultant satisfaction in Porter's clean-cut face, as well as in   Breault's. Jolly Roger watched them until Breault extinguished the   second lamp. Then he lightly plugged the hole in the partition  with  snow, and reached out in the darkness until his hand found  Peter. 
  &quot;They think they've got us, boy,&quot; he whispered, &quot;They think   they've got us!&quot; 
  Very quietly they lay for an hour. McKay did not sleep, and Peter   was wide awake. At the end of that hour Jolly Roger crept on his   hands and knees to the doorway and listened. One after another he   picked out the steady breathing of the sleepers. Then he began   feeling his way around the wall of his room until he came to a  place  where the snow was very soft. 
  &quot;An air-drift,&quot; he whispered to Peter, close at his shoulder.   &quot;We'll fool 'em, boy. And we'll fight&#8212;if we have to.&quot; 
  He began worming his head and shoulders and body into the air-   drift like a gimlet. A foot at a time he burrowed himself through,   heaving his body up and down and sideways to pack the light snow,   leaving a round tunnel two feet in diameter behind him. Within an   hour he had come to the outer crust on the windward side of the  big  snow-dune. He did not break through this crust, which was as  tough as  crystal-glass, but lay quietly for a time and listened to  the sweep of  the wind outside. It was warm, and very comfortable,  and he had  half-dozed off before he caught himself back into  wakefulness and  returned to his room. The mouth of his tunnel he  packed with snow.  After that he wound the blanket about him and  gave himself up calmly  to sleep. 
  Only Peter lay awake after that. And it was Peter who roused Jolly   Roger in what would have been the early dawn outside the snow-  dune.  McKay felt his restless movement, and opened his eyes. A  faint light  was illumining his room, and he sat up. In the outer  room the alcohol  lamp was burning again. He could hear movement,  and voices that were  very low and indistinct. Carefully he dug out  once more the little  hole in the snow wall, and widened the slit. 
  Breault and Tavish were asleep, but Porter was sitting up, and   close beside him sat the girl. Her coiled hair was loosened, and   fallen over her shoulders. There was no sign of drowsiness in her   wide-open eyes as they stared at the door between the two rooms.   McKay could see her hand clasping Porter's arm. Porter was  talking,  with his face so close to her bent head that his lips  touched her  hair, and though Jolly Roger could understand no word  that was spoken  he knew Porter was whispering the exciting secret  of his identity to  Josephine Tavish. He could see, for a moment, a  shadow of protest in  her face, he could hear the quick, sibilant  whisper of her voice, and  Porter cautioned her with a finger at  her lips, and made a gesture  toward the sleeping Tavish. Then his  fingers closed about her uncoiled  hair as he drew her to him.  McKay watched the long kiss between them.  The girl drew away  quickly then, and Porter tucked the blanket about  her when she lay  down beside her father. After that he stretched out  again beside  Breault. 
  Jolly Roger guessed what had happened. The girl had awakened, a   bit nervous, and had roused Porter and asked him to relight the   alcohol lamp. And Porter had taken advantage of the opportunity to   tell her of the interesting discovery which Breault had made&#8212;and  to  kiss her. McKay stroked Peter's scrawny neck, and listened. He  could  no longer hear the storm, and he wondered if the fury of it  was spent. 
  Every few minutes he looked through the slit in the snow wall. The   last time, half an hour after Porter had returned to his blanket,   Josephine Tavish was sitting up. She was very wide awake. McKay   watched her as she rose slowly to her knees, and then to her feet.   She bent over Porter and Breault to make sure they were asleep,  and  then came straight toward the door of his room. 
  He lay back on his blanket, with the fingers of one hand gripped   closely about Peter. 
  &quot;Be quiet, boy,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Be quiet.&quot; 
  He could see the shutting out of light at his door as the girl   stood there, listening for his breathing. He breathed heavily, and   before he closed his eyes he saw Josephine Tavish coming toward  him.  In a moment she was bending over him. He could feel the soft  caress of  her loose hair on his face and hands. Then she knelt  quietly down  beside him, stroking Peter with her hand, and shook  him lightly by the  shoulder. 
  &quot;Jolly Roger!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Jolly Roger McKay!&quot; 
  He opened his eyes, looking up at the white face in the gloom. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied softly. &quot;What is it, Miss Tavish?&quot; 
  He could hear the choking breath in her throat as her fingers   tightened at his shoulder. She bent her face still nearer to him,   until her hair cluttered his throat and breast. 
  &quot;You are&#8212;awake?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;listen to me. If you are Jolly Roger McKay you must get   away&#8212;somewhere. You must go before Breault awakens in the  morning. I  think the storm is over&#8212;there is no wind&#8212;and if you  are here when  day comes&#8212;&quot; 
  Her fingers loosened. Jolly Roger reached out and somewhere in the   darkness he found her hand. It clasped his own&#8212;firm, warm,   thrilling. 
  &quot;I thank you for what you have done,&quot; she whispered. &quot;But the law   &#8212;and Breault&#8212;they have no mercy!&quot; 
  She was gone, swiftly and silently, and McKay looked through the   slit in the wall until she was with her father again. 
  In the gloom he drew Peter close to him. 
  &quot;We're up against it again, Pied-Bot,&quot; he confided under his   breath. &quot;We've got to take another chance.&quot; 
  He worked without sound, and in a quarter of an hour his pack was   ready, and the entrance to his tunnel dug out. He went into the  outer  room then, where Josephine Tavish was awake. Jolly Roger  pantomimed  his desire as she sat up. He wanted something from one  of the packs.  She nodded. On his knees he fumbled in the dunnage,  and when he rose  to his feet, facing the girl, her eyes opened  wide at what he held in  his hand&#8212;a small packet of old newspapers  her father was taking to  the factor at Fort Churchill. She saw the  hungry, apologetic look in  his eyes, and her woman's heart  understood. She smiled gently at him,  and her lips formed an  unvoiced whisper of gratitude as he turned to  go. At the door he  looked back. He thought she was beautiful then,  with her shining  hair and eyes, and her lips parted, and her hands  half reaching  out to him, as if in that moment of parting she was  giving him  courage and faith. Suddenly she pressed the palms of her  fingers  to her mouth and sent the kiss of benediction to him through  the  twilight glow of the snow-room. 
  A moment later, crawling through his tunnel with Peter close   behind him, there was an exultant singing in Jolly Roger's heart.   Again he was fleeing from the law, but always, as Yellow Bird had   predicted in her sorcery, there were happiness and hope in his  going.  And always there was someone to urge him on, and to take a  pride in  him, like Josephine Tavish. 
  He broke through the dune-crust at the end of his tunnel and   crawled out into the thick, gray dawn of a barren-land day. The  sky  was heavy overhead, and the wind had died out. It was the  beginning of  the brief lull which came in the second day of the  Great Storm. 
  McKay laughed softly as he sensed the odds against them. 
  &quot;We'll be having the storm at our heels again before long, Pied-   Bot,&quot; he said. &quot;We'd better make for the timber a dozen miles  south.&quot; 
  He struck out, circling the dune, so that he was traveling   straight away from the first hole he had cut through the shell of  the  drift. From that door, made by the outlaw who had saved them,   Josephine Tavish watched the shadowy forms of man and dog until  they  were lost in the gray-white chaos of a frozen world.
