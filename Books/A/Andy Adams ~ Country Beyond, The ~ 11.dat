  Days of new hope and gladness followed in the camp of Yellow Bird   and Slim Buck. It was as if McKay, after a long absence, had come   back to his own people. The tenderness of mother and sister lay  warm  in Yellow Bird's breast. Slim Buck loved him as a brother.  The  wrinkled faces of the old softened when he came near and spoke  to  them; little children followed him, and at dusk and dawn Sun  Cloud  held up her mouth to be kissed. For the first time in years  McKay felt  as if he had found home. The northland Indian Summer  held the world in  its drowsy arms, and the sun-filled days and the  starry nights seemed  overflowing with the promise of all time.  Each day he put off his  going until tomorrow, and each day Slim  Buck urged him to remain with  them always. 
  But in Yellow Bird's eyes was a strange, quiet mystery, and she   did not urge. Each day and night she was watching&#8212;and waiting. 
  And at last that for which she watched and waited came to pass. 
  It was night, a dark, still night with a creeping restlessness in   it. This restlessness was like the ghostly pulse of a great living   body, still for a time, then moving, hiding, whispering between  the  clouds in the sky and the deeper shadowed earth below. A night  of  uneasiness, of unseen forces chained and stifled, of impending  doubt  and oppressive lifelessness. 
  There was no wind, yet under the stars gray masses of cloud sped   as if in flight. 
  There was no breeze in the treetops, yet they whispered and   sighed. 
  In the strange spell of this midnight, heavy with its unrest, the   wilderness lay half asleep, half awake, with the mysterious  stillness  of death enshrouding it. 
  At the edge of the white sands of Wollaston, whose broad water was   like oil tonight, stood the tepees of Yellow Bird's people. Smoke-   blackened and seasoned by wind and rain they were dark blotches   sentineling the shore of the big lake. Behind them, beyond the   willows, were the Indian dogs. From them came an occasional whine,  a  deep sigh, the snapping of a jaw, and in the gloom their bodies  moved  restlessly. In the tepees was the spell of this same unrest.  Sleep was  never quite sure of itself. Men, women and little  children twisted and  rolled, or lay awake, and weird and distorted  shapes and fancies came  in dreams. 
  In her tepee Yellow Bird lay with her eyes wide open, staring at   the gray blur of the smoke hole above. Her husband was asleep. Sun   Cloud, tossing on her blankets, had flung one of her long braids  so  that it lay across her mother's breast. Yellow Bird's slim  fingers  played with its silken strands as she looked straight up  into  nothingness. Wide awake, she was thinking&#8212;thinking as Slim   Buck&#8212;would never be able to think, back to the days when a white   woman had been her goddess, and when a little white boy&#8212;the  woman's  son&#8212;had called Yellow Bird &quot;my fairy.&quot; 
  In the gloom, with foreboding eating at her heart, Yellow Bird's   red lips parted in a smile as those days came back to her, for  they  were pleasing days to think about. But after that the years  sped  swiftly in her mind until the day when the little boy&#8212;a man   grown&#8212;came to save her tribe, and her own life, and the life of  Sun  Cloud, and of Slim Buck her husband. Since then prosperity and   happiness had been her lot. The spirits had been good. They had  not  let her grow old, but had kept her still beautiful. And Sun  Cloud, her  little daughter, was beautiful, and Slim Buck was more  than ever her  god among men, and her people were happy. And all  this she owed to the  man who was sleeping under the gloom of the  sky outside, the hunted  man, the outlaw, &quot;the little boy grown  up&quot;&#8212;Jolly Roger McKay. 
  As she listened, and stared up at the smoke hole, strange spirits   were whispering to her, and Yellow Bird's blood ran a little  faster  and her eyes grew bigger and brighter in the darkness. They  seemed to  be accusing her. They told her it was because of her  that Roger McKay  had come in that winter of starvation and death,  and had robbed and  almost killed, that she and Slim Buck and  little Sun Cloud might live.  That was the beginning, and the  thrill of it had got into the blood of  Neekewa, her &quot;little white  brother grown up.&quot; And now he was out  there, alone with his dog in  the night&#8212;and the red-coated avengers of  the law were hunting  him. They wanted him for many things, but chiefly  for the killing  of a man. 
  Yellow Bird sat up, her little hands clenched about the thick   braid of Sun Cloud's hair. She had conjured with the spirits and  had  let the soul go out of her body that she might learn the  future for  Neekewa, her white brother. And they had told her that  Roger McKay had  done right to think of killing. 
  Their voices had whispered to her that he would not suffer more   than he had already suffered&#8212;and that in the Country Beyond he  would  find Nada the white girl, and happiness, and peace. Yellow  Bird did  not disbelieve. Her faith was illimitable. The spirits  would not lie.  But the unrest of the night was eating at her  heart. She tried to lift  herself to the whisperings above the  tepee top. But they were  unintelligible, like many voices  mingling, and with them came a dull  fear into her soul. 
  She put out a hand, as if to rouse Slim Buck. Then she drew it   back, and placed Sun Cloud's braid away from her. She rose to her   feet so quietly that even in their restlessness they did not fully   awake. Through the tepee door she went, and stood up straight in  the  night, as if now she might hear more clearly, and understand. 
  For a space she breathed in the oppressive something that was in   the air, and her eyes went east and west for sign of storm. But  there  was no threat of storm. The clouds were drifting slowly and  softly,  with starlight breaking through their rifts, and there was  no moan of  thunder or wail of wind far away. Her heart, for a  little, seemed to  stop its beating, and her hands clasped tightly  at her breast. She  began to understand, and a strange thrill crept  into her. The spirits  had put a great burden upon the night so  that it might drive sleep  from her eyes. They were warning her.  They were telling her of danger,  approaching swiftly, almost  impending. And it was peril for the white  man who was sleeping  somewhere near. 
  Swiftly she began seeking for him, her naked little brown feet   making no sound in the soft white sands of Wollaston. 
  And as she sought, the clouds thinned out above, and the stars   shone through more clearly, as if to make easier for her the quest  in  the gloom. 
  Where he had made his bed of blankets in the sand, close beside a   flat mass of water-washed sandstone, Jolly Roger lay half asleep.   Peter was wide awake. His eyes gleamed brightly and watchfully.  His  lank and bony body was tense and alert. He did not whine or  snap his  jaws, though he heard the Indian dogs occasionally doing  so. The  comradeship of a fugitive, ever on the watch for his  fellow men, had  made him silent and velvet-footed, and had  sharpened his senses to the  keenness of knives. He, too, felt the  impelling force of an  approaching menace in this night of  stillness and mystery, and he  watched closely the restless  movements of his master's body, and  listened with burning eyes to  the name which he had spoken three times  in the last five minutes  of his sleep. 
  It was Nada's name, and as Jolly Roger cried it out softly in the   old way, as if Nada was standing before them, he reached out, and  his  hands struck the sandstone rock. His eyes opened, and slowly  he sat  up. The sky had cleared of clouds, and there was starlight,  and in  that starlight Jolly Roger saw a figure standing near him  in the sand.  At first he thought it was Sun Cloud, for Peter stood  with his head  raised to her. Then he saw it was Yellow Bird, with  her beautiful eyes  looking at him steadily and strangely as he  awakened. 
  He got upon his feet and went to her, and took one of her hands.   It was cold. He felt the shiver that ran through her slim body,  and  suddenly her eyes swept from him out into the night. 
  &quot;Listen, Neekewa!&quot; 
  Her fingers tightened in his hand. For a space he could hear the   beating of her heart. 
  &quot;Twice I have heard it,&quot; she whispered then. &quot;Neekewa, you must   go!&quot; 
  &quot;Heard what?&quot; he asked. 
  She shook her head. 
  &quot;Something&#8212;I don't know what. But it tells me there is danger.   And I saw danger over the tepee top, and I have heard whisperings  of  it all about me. It is coming. It is coming slowly and  cautiously. It  is very near. Hark, Neekewa! Was that not a sound  out on the water?&quot; 
  &quot;I think it was the wing of a duck, Yellow Bird.&quot; 
  &quot;And THAT!&quot; she cried swiftly, her fingers tightening still more.   &quot;That sound&#8212;as if wood strikes on wood!&quot; 
  &quot;The croak of a loon far up the shore, Yellow Bird.&quot; 
  She drew her hand away. 
  &quot;Neekewa, listen to me,&quot; she importuned him in Cree. &quot;The spirits   have made this night heavy with warning. I could not sleep. Sun  Cloud  twitches and moans. Slim Buck whispers to himself. You were  crying out  the name of Nada&#8212;Oo-Mee the Pigeon&#8212;when I came to  you. I know. It is  danger. It is very near. And it is danger for  you.&quot; 
  &quot;And only a short time ago you were confident happiness and peace   were coming to me, Yellow Bird,&quot; reminded Jolly Roger. &quot;The  spirits,  you said, promised the law should never get me, and I  would find Nada  again in that strange place you called the Country  Beyond. Have the  spirits changed their message, because the night  is heavy?&quot; 
  Yellow Bird's eyes were staring into darkness. 
  &quot;No, they have not changed,&quot; she whispered. &quot;They have spoken the   truth. They want to tell me more, but for some reason it is   impossible. They have tried to tell me where lies this place they   call the Country Beyond&#8212;where you will again find Oo-Mee the  Pigeon.  But a cloud always comes between. And they are trying to  tell me what  the danger is off there&#8212;in the darkness.&quot; Suddenly  she caught his  arm. &quot;Nee-kewa, DID YOU HEAR?&quot; 
  &quot;A fish leaping in the still water, Yellow Bird.&quot; 
  He heard a low whimper in Peter's throat, and looking down he saw   Peter's muzzle pointing toward the thick cloud of gloom over the   lake. 
  &quot;What is it, Pied-Bot?&quot; he asked. 
  Peter whimpered again. 
  Jolly Roger touched the cold hand that rested on his arm. 
  &quot;Go back to your bed, Yellow Bird. There is only one danger for   me&#8212;the red-coated police. And they do not travel in the dark  hours  of a night like this.&quot; 
  &quot;They are coming,&quot; she replied. &quot;I cannot hear or see, but they   are coming!&quot; 
  Her fingers tightened. 
  &quot;And they are near,&quot; she cried softly. 
  &quot;You are nervous, Yellow Bird,&quot; he said, thinking of the two days   and three nights of her conjuring, when she had neither slept nor   taken food, that she might more successfully commune with the   spirits. &quot;There is no danger. The night is a hard one for sleep.  It  has frightened you.&quot; 
  &quot;It has warned me,&quot; she persisted, standing as motionless as a   statue at his side. &quot;Neekewa, the spirits do not forget. They have   not forgotten that winter when you came, and my people were dying  of  famine and sickness&#8212;when I dreaded to see little Sun Cloud  close her  eyes even in sleep, fearing she would never open them  again. They have  not forgotten how all that winter you robbed the  white people over on  the Des Chenes, that we might live. If they  remember those things, and  lie, I would not be afraid to curse  them. But they do not lie.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger McKay did not answer. Deep down in him that strange   something was at work again, compelling him to believe Yellow  Bird.  She did not look at him, but in her low Cree voice, soft as  the mellow  notes of a bird, she was saying: 
  &quot;You will be going very soon, Neekewa, and I shall not see you   again for a long time. Do not forget what I have told you. And you   must believe. Somewhere there is this place called the Country   Beyond. The spirits have said so. And it is there you will find  your  Oo-Mee the Pigeon&#8212;and happiness. But if you go back to the  place  where you left The Pigeon when you fled from the red-coated  men of the  law, you will find only blackness and desolation.  Believe, and you  shall be guided. If you disbelieve&#8212;&quot; 
  She stopped. 
  &quot;You heard that, Neekewa? It was not the wing of a duck, nor was   it the croak of a loon far up the shore, or a fish leaping in the   still water. IT WAS A PADDLE!&quot; 
  In the star-gloom Jolly Roger McKay bowed his head, and listened. 
  &quot;Yes, a paddle,&quot; he said, and his voice sounded strange to him.   &quot;Probably it is one of your people returning to camp, Yellow  Bird.&quot; 
  She turned toward him, and stood very near. Her hands reached out   to him. Her hair and eyes were filled with the velvety glow of the   stars, and for an instant he saw the tremble of her parted lips. 
  &quot;Goodby, Neekewa,&quot; she whispered. 
  And then, without letting her hands touch him, she was gone.   Swiftly she ran to Slim Buck's tepee, and entered, and very soon  she  came out again with Slim Buck beside her. Jolly Roger did not  move,  but watched as Yellow Bird and her husband went down to the  edge of  the lake, and stood there, waiting for the strange canoe  to pass&#8212;or  come in. It was approaching. Slowly it came up, an  indistinct shadow  at first, but growing clearer, until at last he  could see the  silhouette of it against the star-silvered water  beyond. There were  two people in it. Before the canoe reached the  shore Slim Buck stood  out knee-deep in the water and hailed it. 
  A voice answered. And at the sound of that voice McKay dropped   like a shot beside Peter, and Peter's lips curled up, and he  snarled.  His master's hand warned him, and together they slipped  back into the  shadows, and from under a piece of canvas Jolly  Roger dragged forth  his pack, and quietly strapped it over his  shoulders while he waited  and listened. 
  And then, as he heard the voice again, he grinned, and chuckled   softly. 
  &quot;It's Cassidy, Pied-Bot! We can't lose that redheaded fox, can   we?&quot; 
  A good humored deviltry lay in his eyes, and Peter&#8212;looking up&#8212;   thought for a moment his master was laughing. Then Jolly Roger  made a  megaphone of his hands, and called very clearly out into  the night. 
  &quot;Ho, Cassidy! Is that you, Cassidy?&quot; 
  Peter's heart was choking him as he listened. He sensed a terrific   danger. There was no sound at the edge of the lake. There was no   sound anywhere. For a few moments a death-like stillness followed   Jolly Roger's words. 
  Then a voice came in answer, each word cutting the gloom with the   decisive clearness of a bullet coming from a gun. 
  &quot;Yes, this is Cassidy&#8212;Corporal Terence Cassidy, of 'M' Division,   Royal Northwest Mounted Police. Is that you, McKay?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it's me,&quot; replied Jolly Roger. &quot;Does the wager still hold,   Cassidy?&quot; 
  &quot;It holds.&quot; 
  There was a shadowy movement on the beach. The voice came again. 
  &quot;Watch yourself, McKay. If I see you I shall fire!&quot; 
  With drawn gun Cassidy rushed toward the spot where Jolly Roger   and Peter had stood. It was empty now, except for the bit of old   canvas. Cassidy's Indian came up and stood behind him, and for  many  minutes they listened for the crackling of brush. Slim Buck  joined  them, and last came Yellow Bird, her dark eyes glowing like  pools of  fire in their excitement. Cassidy looked at her,  marveling at her  beauty, and suspicious of something that was in  her face. He went back  to the beach. There he caught himself  short, astonishment bringing a  sharp exclamation from his lips. 
  His canoe and outfit were gone! 
  Out of the star-gloom behind him floated a soft ripple of laughter   as Yellow Bird ran to her tepee. 
  And from the mist of water&#8212;far out&#8212;came a voice, the voice of   Jolly Roger McKay. 
  &quot;Goodby, Cassidy!&quot; 
  With it mingled the defiant bark of a dog. 
  In her tepee, a moment later, Yellow Bird drew Sun Cloud's glossy   head close against her warm breast, and turned her radiant face up   thankfully to the smoke hole in the tepee top, through which the   spirits had whispered their warning to her. Indistinctly, and  still  farther away, her straining ears heard again the cry, 
  &quot;Goodby, Cassidy!&quot;
