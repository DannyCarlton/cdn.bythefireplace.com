  For what seemed to be an interminable time after the final   breakdown of his physical strength David Carrigan lived in a black   world where a horde of unseen little devils were shooting red-hot   arrows into his brain. He did not sense the fact of human  presence;  nor that the divan had been changed into a bed and the  four lamps  lighted, and that wrinkled, brown hands with talon-like  fingers were  performing a miracle of wilderness surgery upon him.  He did not see  the age-old face of Nepapinas&#8212;&quot;The Wandering Bolt  of Lightning&quot;&#8212;as  the bent and tottering Cree called upon all his  eighty years of  experience to bring him back to life. And he did  not see Bateese,  stolid-faced, silent, nor the dead-white face and  wide-open, staring  eyes of Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain as her slim,  white fingers worked  with the old medicine man's. He was in a gulf  of blackness that  writhed with the spirits of torment. He fought  them and cried out  against them, and his fighting and his cries  brought the look of death  itself into the eyes of the girl who was  over him. He did not hear her  voice nor feel the soothing of her  hands, nor the powerful grip of  Bateese as he held him when the  critical moments came. And Nepapinas,  like a machine that had  looked upon death a thousand times, gave no  rest to his claw-like  fingers until the work was done&#8212;and it was then  that something  came to drive the arrow-shooting devils out of the  darkness that  was smothering Carrigan. 
  After that Carrigan lived through an eternity of unrest, a life in   which he seemed powerless and yet was always struggling for  supremacy  over things that were holding him down. There were  lapses in it, like  the hours of oblivion that come with sleep, and  there were other times  when he seemed keenly alive, yet unable to  move or act. The darkness  gave way to flashes of light, and in  these flashes he began to see  things, curiously twisted, fleeting,  and yet fighting themselves  insistently upon his senses. He was  back in the hot sand again, and  this time he heard the voices of  Jeanne Marie-Anne and Golden-Hair,  and Golden-Hair flaunted a  banner in his face, a triangular pennon of  black on which a huge  bear was fighting white Arctic wolves, and then  she would run away  from him, crying out&#8212;&quot;St. Pierre Boulain&#8212;St.  Pierre Boulain&#8212;&quot;  and the last he could see of her was her hair  flaming like fire in  the sun. But it was always the other&#8212;the dark  hair and dark eyes  &#8212;that came to him when the little devils returned  to assault him  with their arrows. From somewhere she would come out of  darkness  and frighten them away. He could hear her voice like a  whisper in  his ears, and the touch of her hands comforted him and  quieted his  pain. After a time he grew to be afraid when the darkness   swallowed her up, and in that darkness he would call for her, and   always he heard her voice in answer. 
  Then came a long oblivion. He floated through cool space away from   the imps of torment; his bed was of downy clouds, and on these  clouds  he drifted with a great shining river under him; and at  last the cloud  he was in began to shape itself into walls and on  these walls were  pictures, and a window through which the sun was  shining, and a black  pennon&#8212;and he heard a soft, wonderful music  that seemed to come to  him faintly from another world. Other  creatures were at work in his  brain now. They were building up and  putting together the loose ends  of things. Carrigan became one of  them, working so hard that  frequently a pair of dark eyes came out  of the dawning of things to  stop him, and quieting hands and a  voice soothed him to rest. The  hands and the voice became very  intimate. He missed them when they  were not near, especially the  hands, and he was always groping for  them to make sure they had  not gone away. 
  Only once after the floating cloud transformed itself into the   walls of the bateau cabin did the chaotic darkness of the sands  fully  possess him again. In that darkness he heard a voice. It was  not the  voice of Golden-Hair, or of Bateese, or of Jeanne Marie-  Anne. It was  close to his ears. And in that darkness that  smothered him there was  something terrible about it as it droned  slowly the  words&#8212;&quot;HAS-ANY-ONE-SEEN-BLACK-ROGER-AUDEMARD?&quot; He  tried to answer, to  call back to it, and the voice came again,  repeating the words,  emotionless, hollow, as if echoing up out of  a grave. And still harder  he struggled to reply to it, to say that  he was David Carrigan, and  that he was out on the trail of Black  Roger Audemard, and that Black  Roger was far north. And suddenly  it seemed to him that the voice  changed into the flesh and blood  of Black Roger himself, though he  could not see in the darkness&#8212;  and he reached out, gripping fiercely  at the warm substance of  flesh, until he heard another voice, the  voice of Jeanne Marie-  Anne Boulain, entreating him to let his victim  go. It was this  time that his eyes shot open, wide and seeing, and  straight over  him was the face of Jeanne Marie-Anne, nearer him than  it had been  even in the visionings of his feverish mind. His fingers  were  clutching her shoulders, gripping like steel hooks. 
  &quot;M'sieu&#8212;M'sieu David!&quot; she was crying. 
  For a moment he stared; then his hands and fingers relaxed, and   his arms dropped limply. &quot;Pardon&#8212;I&#8212;I was dreaming,&quot; he struggled   weakly. &quot;I thought&#8212;&quot; 
  He had seen the pain in her face. Now, changing swiftly, it   lighted up with relief and gladness. His vision, cleared by long   darkness, saw the change come in an instant like a flash of  sunshine.  And then&#8212;so near that he could have touched her&#8212;she  was smiling down  into his eyes. He smiled back. It took an effort,  for his face felt  stiff and unnatural. 
  &quot;I was dreaming&#8212;of a man&#8212;named Roger Audemard,&quot; he continued to   apologize. &quot;Did I&#8212;hurt you?&quot; 
  The smile on her lips was gone as swiftly as it had come. &quot;A   little, m'sieu. I am glad you are better. You have been very  sick.&quot; 
  He raised a hand to his face. The bandage was there, and also a   stubble of beard on his cheeks. He was puzzled. This morning he  had  fastened his steel mirror to the side of a tree and shaved. 
  &quot;It was three days ago you were hurt,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;This is   the afternoon of the third day. You have been in a great fever.   Nepapinas, my Indian doctor, saved your life. You must lie quietly   now. You have been talking a great deal.&quot; 
  &quot;About&#8212;Black Roger?&quot; he said. 
  She nodded. 
  &quot;And&#8212;Golden&#8212;Hair?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, of Golden&#8212;Hair.&quot; 
  &quot;And&#8212;some one else&#8212;with dark hair&#8212;and dark eyes&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;It may be, m'sieu.&quot; 
  &quot;And of little devils with bows and arrows, and of polar bears,   and white wolves, and of a great lord of the north who calls  himself  St. Pierre Boulain?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, of all those.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I haven't anything more to tell you,&quot; grunted David. &quot;I   guess I've told you all I know. You shot me, back there. And here  I  am. What are you going to do next?&quot; 
  &quot;Call Bateese,&quot; she answered promptly, and she rose swiftly from   beside him and moved toward the door. 
  He made no effort to call her back. His wits were working slowly,   readjusting themselves after a carnival in chaos, and he scarcely   sensed that she was gone until the cabin door closed behind her.  Then  again he raised a hand to his face and felt his beard. Three  days! He  turned his head so that he could take in the length of  the cabin. It  was filled with subdued sunlight now, a western sun  that glowed  softly, giving depth and richness to the colors on the  floor and  walls, lighting up the piano keys, suffusing the  pictures with a  warmth of life. David's eyes traveled slowly to  his own feet. The  divan had been opened and transformed into a  bed. He was undressed. He  had on somebody's white nightgown. And  there was a big bunch of wild  roses on the table where three days  ago the cat had been sleeping in  the work-basket. His head cleared  swiftly, and he raised himself a  little on one elbow, with extreme  caution, and listened. The big  bateau was not moving. It was still  tied up, but he could hear no  voices out where the tar-sands were. 
  He dropped back on his pillow, and his eyes rested on the black   pennon. His blood stirred again as he looked at the white bear and   the fighting wolves. Wherever men rode the waters of the Three  Rivers  that pennon was known. Yet it was not common. Seldom was it  seen, and  never had it come south of Chipewyan. Many things came  to Carrigan  now, things that he had heard at the Landing and up  and down the  rivers. Once he had read the tail-end of a report the  Superintendent  of &quot;N&quot; Division had sent in to headquarters. 
  &quot;We do not know this St. Pierre. Few men have seen him out of his   own country, the far headwaters of the Yellowknife, where he rules   like a great overlord. Both the Yellowknives and the Dog Ribs call   him KICHEOO KIMOW, or King, and the same rumors say there is never   starvation or plague in his regions; and it is fact that neither  the  Hudson's Bay nor Revillon Brothers in their cleverest  generalship and  trade have been able to uproot his almost dynastic  jurisdiction. The  Police have had no reason to investigate or  interfere.&quot; 
  At least that was the gist of what Carrigan had read in McVane's   report. But he had never associated it with the name of Boulain.  It  was of St. Pierre that he had heard stories, St. Pierre and his  black  pennon with its white bear and fighting wolves. And so&#8212;it  was St.  Pierre BOULAIN! 
  He closed his eyes and thought of the long winter weeks he had   passed at Hay River Post, watching for Fanchet, the mail robber.  It  was there he had heard most about this St. Pierre, and yet no  one he  had talked with had ever seen him; no one knew whether he  was old or  young, a pigmy or a giant. Some stories said that he  was strong, that  he could twist a gun-barrel double in his hands;  others said that he  was old, very old, so that he never set forth  with his brigades that  brought down each year a treasure of furs  to be exchanged for freight.  And never did a Dog Rib or a  Yellowknife open his mouth about KICHEOO  KIMOW St. Pierre, the  master of their unmapped domains. In that great  country north and  west of the Great Slave he remained an enigma and a  sphinx. If he  ever came out with his brigades, he did not disclose his  identity,  so that if one saw a fleet of boats or canoes with the St.  Pierre  pennon, one had to make his own guess whether St. Pierre  himself  was there or not. But these things were known&#8212;that the  keenest,  quickest, and strongest men in the northland ran the St.  Pierre  brigades, that they brought out the richest cargoes of furs,  and  that they carried back with them into the secret fastnesses of   their wilderness the greatest cargoes of freight that treasure  could  buy. So much the name St. Pierre dragged out of Carrigan's  memory. It  came to him now why the name &quot;Boulain&quot; had pounded so  insistently in  his brain. He had seen this pennon with its white  bear and fighting  wolves only once before, and that had been over  a Boulain scow at  Chipewyan. But his memory had lost its grip on  that incident while  retaining vividly its hold on the stories and  rumors of the  mystery-man, St. Pierre. 
  Carrigan pulled himself a little higher on his pillow and with a   new interest scanned the cabin. He had never heard of Boulain  women.  Yet here was the proof of their existence and of the  greatness that  ran in the red blood of their veins. The history of  the great  northland, hidden in the dust-dry tomes and guarded  documents of the  great company, had always been of absorbing  interest to him. He  wondered why it was that the outside world  knew so little about it and  believed so little of what it heard. A  long time ago he had penned an  article telling briefly the story  of this half of a great continent in  which for two hundred years  romance and tragedy and strife for mastery  had gone on in a way to  thrill the hearts of men. He had told of huge  forts with thirty-  foot stone bastions, of fierce wars, of great  warships that had  fired their broadsides in battle in the ice-filled  waters of  Hudson's Bay. He had described the coming into this northern  world  of thousands and tens of thousands of the bravest and  best-blooded  men of England and France, and how these thousands had  continued  to come, bringing with them the names of kings, of princes,  and of  great lords, until out of the savagery of the north rose an   aristocracy of race built up of the strongest men of the earth.  And  these men of later days he had called Lords of the North&#8212;men  who had  held power of life and death in the hollow of their hands  until the  great company yielded up its suzerainty to the  Government of the  Dominion in 1870; men who were kings in their  domains, whose word was  law, who were more powerful in their  wilderness castles than their  mistress over the sea, the Queen of  Britain. 
  And Carrigan, after writing of these things, had stuffed his   manuscript away in the bottom of his chest at barracks, for he   believed that it was not in his power to do justice to the people  of  this wilderness world that he loved. The powerful old lords  were gone.  Like dethroned monarchs, stripped to the level of other  men, they  lived in the memories of what had been. Their might now  lay in trade.  No more could they set out to wage war upon their  rivals with powder  and ball. Keen wit, swift dogs, and the  politics of barter had taken  the place of deadlier things. LE  FACTEUR could no longer slay or  command that others be slain. A  mightier hand than his now ruled the  destinies of the northern  people&#8212;the hand of the Royal Northwest  Mounted Police. 
  It was this thought, the thought that Law and one of the powerful   forces of the wilderness had met in this cabin of the big bateau,   that came to Carrigan as he drew himself still higher against his   pillow. A greater thrill possessed him than the thrill of his hunt   for Black Roger Audemard. Black Roger was a murderer, a wholesale   murderer and a fiend, a Moloch for whom there could be no pity. Of   all men the Law wanted Black Roger most, and he, David Carrigan,  was  the chosen one to consummate its desire. Yet in spite of that  he felt  upon him the strange unrest of a greater adventure than  the quest for  Black Roger. It was like an impending thing that  could not be seen,  urging him, rousing his faculties from the  slough into which they had  fallen because of his wound and  sickness. It was, after all, the most  vital of all things, a  matter of his own life. Jeanne Marie-Anne  Boulain had tried to  kill him deliberately, with malice and intent.  That she had saved  him afterward only added to the necessity of an  explanation, and  he was determined that he would have that explanation  and settle  the present matter before he allowed another thought of  Black  Roger to enter his head. 
  This resolution reiterated itself in his mind as the machine-like   voice of duty. He was not thinking of the Law, and yet the   consciousness of his accountability to that Law kept repeating   itself. In the very face of it Carrigan knew that something  besides  the moral obligation of the thing was urging him,  something that was  becoming deeply and dangerously personal. At  least&#8212;he tried to think  of it as dangerous. And that danger was  his unbecoming interest in the  girl herself. It was an interest  distinctly removed from any ethical  code that might have governed  him in his experience with Carmin  Fanchet, for instance.  Comparatively, if they had stood together,  Carmin would have been  the lovelier. But he would have looked longer  at Jeanne Marie-Anne  Boulain. 
  He conceded the point, smiling a bit grimly as he continued to   study that part of the cabin which he could see from his pillow.  He  had lost interest&#8212;temporarily at least&#8212;in Black Roger  Audemard. Not  long ago the one question to which, above all  others, he had desired  an answer was, why had Jeanne Marie-Anne  Boulain worked so desperately  to kill him and so hard to save him  afterward? Now, as he looked about  him, the question which  repeated itself insistently was, what  relationship did she bear to  this mysterious lord of the north, St.  Pierre? 
  Undoubtedly she was his daughter, for whom St. Pierre had built   this luxurious barge of state. A fierce-blooded offspring, he   thought, one like Cleopatra herself, not afraid to kill&#8212;and  equally  quick to make amends when there was a mistake. 
  There came the quiet opening of the cabin door to break in upon   his thought. He hoped it was Jeanne Marie-Anne returning to him.  It  was Nepapinas. The old Indian stood over him for a moment and  put a  cold, claw-like hand to his forehead. He grunted and nodded  his head,  his little sunken eyes gleaming with satisfaction. Then  he put his  hands under David's arms and lifted him until he was  sitting upright,  with three or four pillows at his back. 
  &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Carrigan. &quot;That makes me feel better. And&#8212;if you   don't mind&#8212;my last lunch was three days ago, boiled prunes and a   piece of bannock&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I have brought you something to eat, M'sieu David,&quot; broke in a   soft voice behind him. 
  Nepapinas slipped away, and Jeanne Marie-Anne stood in his place.   David stared up at her, speechless. He heard the door close behind   the old Indian. Then Jeanne Marie-Anne drew up a chair, so that  for  the first time he could see her clear eyes with the light of  day full  upon her. 
  He forgot that a few days ago she had been his deadliest enemy. He   forgot the existence of a man named Black Roger Audemard. Her   slimness was as it had pictured itself to him in the hot sands.  Her  hair was as he had seen it there. It was coiled upon her head  like  ropes of spun silk, jet-black, glowing softly. But it was her  eyes he  stared at, and so fixed was his look that the red lips  trembled a bit  on the verge of a smile. She was not embarrassed.  There was no color  in the clear whiteness of her skin, except that  redness of her lips. 
  &quot;I thought you had black eyes,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;I'm glad you   haven't. I don't like them. Yours are as brown as&#8212;as&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Please, m'sieu,&quot; she interrupted him, sitting down close beside   him. &quot;Will you eat&#8212;now?&quot; 
  A spoon was at his mouth, and he was forced to take it in or have   its contents spilled over him. The spoon continued to move quickly   between the bowl and his mouth. He was robbed of speech. And the   girl's eyes, as surely as he was alive, were beginning to laugh at   him. They were a wonderful brown, with little, golden specks in  them,  like the freckles he had seen in wood-violets. Her lips  parted.  Between their bewitching redness he saw the gleam of her  white teeth.  In a crowd, with her glorious hair covered and her  eyes looking  straight ahead, one would not have picked her out.  But close, like  this, with her eyes smiling at him, she was  adorable. 
  Something of Carrigan's thoughts must have shown in his face, for   suddenly the girl's lips tightened a little, and the warmth went  out  of her eyes, leaving them cold and distant. He finished the  soup, and  she rose again to her feet. 
  &quot;Please don't go,&quot; he said. &quot;If you do, I think I shall get up and   follow. I am quite sure I am entitled to a little something more  than  soup.&quot; 
  &quot;Nepapinas says that you may have a bit of boiled fish for   supper,&quot; she assured him. 
  &quot;You know I don't mean that. I want to know why you shot me, and   what you think you are going to do with me.&quot; 
  &quot;I shot you by mistake&#8212;and&#8212;I don't know just what to do with   you,&quot; she said, looking at him tranquilly, but with what he  thought  was a growing shadow of perplexity in her eyes. &quot;Bateese  says to  fasten a big stone to your neck and throw you in the  river. But  Bateese doesn't always mean what he says. I don't think  he is quite as  bloodthirsty&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;&#8212;As the young lady who tried to murder me behind the rock,&quot;   Carrigan interjected. 
  &quot;Exactly, m'sieu. I don't think he would throw you into the river   &#8212;unless I told him to. And I don't believe I am going to ask him  to  do that,&quot; she added, the soft glow flashing back into her eyes  for an  instant. &quot;Not after the splendid work Nepapinas has done on  your head.  St. Pierre must see that. And then, if St. Pierre  wishes to finish  you, why&#8212;&quot; She shrugged her slim shoulders and  made a little gesture  with her hands. 
  In that same moment there came over her a change as sudden as the   passing of light itself. It was as if a thing she was hiding had   broken beyond her control for an instant and had betrayed her. The   gesture died. The glow went out of her eyes, and in its place came  a  light that was almost fear&#8212;or pain. She came nearer to Carrigan   again, and somehow, looking up at her, he thought of the little  brush  warbler singing at the end of its birch twig to give him  courage. It  must have been because of her throat, white and soft,  which he saw  pulsing like a beating heart before she spoke to him. 
  &quot;I have made a terrible mistake, m'sieu David,&quot; she said, her   voice barely rising above a whisper. &quot;I'm sorry I hurt you. I  thought  it was some one else behind the rock. But I can not tell  you more than  that&#8212;ever. And I know it is impossible for us to be  friends.&quot; She  paused, one of her hands creeping to her bare  throat, as if to cover  the throbbing he had seen there. 
  &quot;Why is it impossible?&quot; he demanded, leaning away from his pillows   so that he might bring himself nearer to her. 
  &quot;Because&#8212;you are of the police, m'sieu.&quot; 
  &quot;The police, yes,&quot; he said, his heart thrumming inside his breast.   &quot;I am Sergeant Carrigan. I am out after Roger Audemard, a  murderer.  But my commission has nothing to do with the daughter of  St. Pierre  Boulain. Please&#8212;let's be friends&#8212;&quot; 
  He held out his hand; and in that moment David Carrigan placed   another thing higher than duty&#8212;and in his eyes was the confession  of  it, like the glow of a subdued fire. The girl's fingers drew  more  closely at her throat, and she made no movement to accept his  hand. 
  &quot;Friends,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Friends&#8212;in spite of the police.&quot; 
  Slowly the girl's eyes had widened, as if she saw that new-born   thing riding over all other things in his swiftly beating heart.  And  afraid of it, she drew a step away from him. 
  &quot;I am not St. Pierre Boulain's daughter,&quot; she said, forcing the   words out one by one. &quot;I am&#8212;his wife.&quot;
