Jack had almost finished his breakfast when Betty entered the dining-  room. He looked beyond her with the surprised and sulky frown of the  neglected husband.    
"Where on earth is Harriet?" he asked. "Her natural inclination is to  lie in bed all day. What induced her--"    
"She wanted to go to the camp-meeting," said Betty, not without  apprehension. "You know she always went with her adopted father, who  was a Methodist clergyman--"    
"Great heaven!" Her apprehension was justified. His face was convulsed  with disgust. "My wife at a camp-meeting! And you let her go?"    
"Harriet is not sixteen. And when a person has been brought up to a  thing, you cannot expect her to change completely in a few months.  Poor Harriet lived in a forsaken village where she had no sort of  society; I suppose the camp-meeting was her only excitement. And you  know how emotionally religious the--the Methodists are--You glare at  me so I scalded my throat."    
"I am sorry, and I am afraid I have been rude. But you must--you must  know how distasteful it is for me to think of my wife at a camp-  meeting. Great heaven!"    
"It is even worse than my going over to politics, isn't it? Don't take  it so tragically, my dear. The truth is, I suspect, Harriet worries  about having deceived Molly and me, and the camp-meeting is probably  to the Methodist what the confessional is to the Catholic. Both must  ease one's mind a lot."    
"Harriet will have to ease her mind in some other way in the future.  And it will be some time before I can forget this." "Thank heaven I am  not married. Are you going after her? Shall you march her home by the  ear?"    
"I certainly shall not go after her--that is, if she is in no danger.  Where is this camp-meeting?"    
"Oh, there are five hundred or so of them, and it is near a  farmhouse." It was evident that he had forgotten the colour of the  camp. "Seriously, I would let her alone for to-day. That form of  hysteria has to wear itself out. I did not like the idea of her going,  and told her so, but I saw what it meant to her, and took her. When  you get her over to Europe, settle in some old town with a beautiful  cathedral and a dozen churches, where the choir boys are ducky little  things in scarlet habits and white lace capes, and there are mediaeval  religious processions with gorgeous costumes and solemn chants, and  the bells ring all day long, and there is a service every five minutes  with music, and a blessed relic to kiss in every church. She will be a  Catholic in less than no time, and look back upon the camp-meeting  with a shudder of aristocratic disgust."    
"I hope so. If you will excuse me I will go out and smoke a  cigarette."    
She said to Senator North as they approached the head of the lake that  evening, "A tempest is brewing in our matrimonial teapot. He looked  ready to divorce her when I told him where she had gone."    
"I hope he won't divorce her when she gets home. Keep them apart if  you can. She has developed more than one characteristic of the race to  which she is as surely forged as if her fetters were visible. If she  has all its religious fanaticism in her, she is quite likely to work  up to that point of hysteria where she will proclaim the truth to the  world."    
"Ah!" cried Betty, sharply. "Why did I not think of that? What a poor  guardian I am! If I had warned her, she never would have gone--but  probably she won't, as we have thought of it. The expected so seldom  happens."    
"Don't count too much on that when great crises threaten," he said  grimly. "The law of cause and effect does not hide in the realm of the  unexpected when intelligent beings go looking for it. To tell you the  truth, I have been apprehensive ever since I saw her face this  morning. All the intelligence had gone out of it. With her race,  religion means the periodical necessity to relapse into barbarism, to  act like shouting savages after the year of civilized restraints. I  will venture to guess that Harriet has forgotten to-day everything  she has learned since she entered your family. Within that sad, calm,  high-bred envelope is--I am afraid--a mind which has the taint of the  blood that feeds it."    
"I have thought that for a long while. Poor thing, why was she ever  born?"    
"Because sin has a habit of persisting, and is remorseless in its  choice of vehicles. I do not see anything of her."    
They waited almost an hour before she came hurrying down the path. She  barely recognized them, but dropped on her seat in the bow and  crouched there, sobbing and groaning.    
It was a cheerless journey through the forest and down the lake, and  the element of the grotesque did nothing to relieve it. Betty,  distracted at first, soon realized that upon her lay the  responsibility of averting a tragedy, and she ordered her brain to  action. She leaned forward finally and whispered to Senator North:    
"Row me to my boat-house and I will ask Jack to row you home. He is  too courteous to suggest sending a servant if I make a point of his  taking you."    
He nodded. She saw the confidence in his eyes, and even in that hour  of supreme anxiety her mind leapt forward to the winning of his  approval as the ultimate of her struggle to save the happiness of two  human beings who were almost at her mercy.    
Jack was walking on the terrace. Betty called to him, and he consented  with no marked grace to be boatman. He had taken the oars before he  noticed that his wife, whom he was not yet ready to forgive, was being  hurried off by his cousin.    
"Mrs. Emory is very tired and her head aches," said Senator North.  "Miss Madison is anxious to get her into bed. Can't you dine with me  to-night? It would give me great pleasure, and men are superfluous, I  have observed, when women have headaches."    
And Jack, who was not sorry to punish his wife, accepted the  invitation and did not return home till midnight.
