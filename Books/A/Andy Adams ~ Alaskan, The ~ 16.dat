  The physical sign of strain in Stampede's face, and the stolid  effort he was making to say something which it was difficult for him to  put into words, did not excite Alan as he waited for his companion's  promised disclosure. Instead of suspense he felt rather a sense of  anticipation and relief. What he had passed through recently had burned  out of him a certain demand upon human ethics which had been almost  callous in its insistence, and while he believed that something very  real and very stern in the way of necessity had driven Mary Standish  north, he was now anxious to be given the privilege of gripping with  any force of circumstance that had turned against her. He wanted to  know the truth, yet he had dreaded the moment when the girl herself  must tell it to him, and the fact that Stampede had in some way  discovered this truth, and was about to make disclosure of it, was a  tremendous lightening of the situation.
  &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;What do you know about Mary Standish?&#8221;
  Stampede leaned over the table, a gleam of distress in his eyes.  &#8220;It's rotten. I know it. A man who backslides on a woman the way I'm  goin' to oughta be shot, and if it was anything else&#8212;<I>anything</I> &#8212;I'd keep it to myself. But you've got to know. And you can't  understand just how rotten it is, either; you haven't ridden in a coach  with her during a storm that was blowing the Pacific outa bed, an' you  haven't hit the trail with her all the way from Chitina to the Range as  I did. If you'd done that, Alan, you'd feel like killing a man who said  anything against her.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not inquiring into your personal affairs,&#8221; reminded Alan. &#8220;It's  your own business.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the trouble,&#8221; protested Stampede. &#8220;It's not my business.  It's yours. If I'd guessed the truth before we hit the Range,  everything would have been different. I'd have rid myself of her some  way. But I didn't find out what she was until this evening, when I  returned Keok's music machine to their cabin. I've been trying to make  up my mind what to do ever since. If she was only making her get-away  from the States, a pickpocket, a coiner, somebody's bunco pigeon chased  by the police&#8212;almost anything&#8212;we could forgive her. Even if she'd  shot up somebody&#8212;&#8221; He made a gesture of despair. &#8220;But she didn't.  She's worse than that!&#8221;
  He leaned a little nearer to Alan.
  &#8220;She's one of John Graham's tools sent up here to sneak and spy on  you,&#8221; he finished desperately. &#8220;I'm sorry&#8212;but I've got the proof.&#8221;
  His hand crept over the top of the table; slowly the closed palm  opened, and when he drew it back, a crumpled paper lay between them.  &#8220;Found it on the floor when I took the phonograph back,&#8221; he explained.  &#8220;It was twisted up hard. Don't know why I unrolled it. Just chance.&#8221;
  He waited until Alan had read the few words on the bit of paper,  watching closely the slight tensing of the other's face. After a moment  Alan dropped the paper, rose to his feet, and went to the window. There  was no longer a light in the cabin where Mary Standish had been  accepted as a guest. Stampede, too, had risen from his seat. He saw the  sudden and almost imperceptible shrug of Alan's shoulders.
  It was Alan who spoke, after a half-mixture of silence. &#8220;Rather a  missing link, isn't it? Adds up a number of things fairly well. And I'm  grateful to you, Stampede. Almost&#8212;you didn't tell me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Almost,&#8221; admitted Stampede.
  &#8220;And I wouldn't have blamed you. She's that kind&#8212;the kind that  makes you feel anything said against her is a lie. And I'm going to  believe that paper is a lie&#8212;until tomorrow. Will you take a message to  Tautuk and Amuk Toolik when you go out? I'm having breakfast at seven.  Tell them to come to my cabin with their reports and records at eight.  Later I'm going up into the foothills to look over the herds.&#8221;
  Stampede nodded. It was a good fight on Alan's part, and it was just  the way he had expected him to take the matter. It made him rather  ashamed of the weakness and uncertainty to which he had confessed. Of  course they could do nothing with a woman; it wasn't a shooting  business&#8212;yet. But there was a debatable future, if the gist of the  note on the table ran true to their unspoken analysis of it. Promise of  something like that was in Alan's eyes.
  He opened the door. &#8220;I'll have Tautuk and Amuk Toolik here at eight.  Good night, Alan!&#8221;
  &#8220;Good night!&#8221;
  Alan watched Stampede's figure until it had disappeared before he  closed the door.
  Now that he was alone, he no longer made an effort to restrain the  anxiety which the prospector's unexpected revealment had aroused in  him. The other's footsteps were scarcely gone when he again had the  paper in his hand. It was clearly the lower part of a letter sheet of  ordinary business size and had been carelessly torn from the larger  part of the page, so that nothing more than the signature and half a  dozen lines of writing in a man's heavy script remained.
  What was left of the letter which Alan would have given much to have  possessed, read as follows:
  &#8220;&#8212;If you work carefully and guard your real identity in securing  facts and information, we should have the entire industry in our hands  within a year.&#8221;
  Under these words was the strong and unmistakable signature of John  Graham.
  A score of times Alan had seen that signature, and the hatred he  bore for its maker, and the desire for vengeance which had entwined  itself like a fibrous plant through all his plans for the future, had  made of it an unforgetable writing in his brain. Now that he held in  his hand words written by his enemy, and the man who had been his  father's enemy, all that he had kept away from Stampede's sharp eyes  blazed in a sudden fury in his face. He dropped the paper as if it had  been a thing unclean, and his hands clenched until his knuckles snapped  in the stillness of the room, as he slowly faced the window through  which a few moments ago he had looked in the direction of Mary  Standish's cabin.
  So John Graham was keeping his promise, the deadly promise he had  made in the one hour of his father's triumph&#8212;that hour in which the  elder Holt might have rid the earth of a serpent if his hands had not  revolted in the last of those terrific minutes which he as a youth had  witnessed. And Mary Standish was the instrument he had chosen to work  his ends!
  In these first minutes Alan could not find a doubt with which to  fend the absoluteness of the convictions which were raging in his head,  or still the tumult that was in his heart and blood. He made no  pretense to deny the fact that John Graham must have written this  letter to Mary Standish; inadvertently she had kept it, had finally  attempted to destroy it, and Stampede, by chance, had discovered a  small but convincing remnant of it. In a whirlwind of thought he pieced  together things that had happened: her efforts to interest him from the  beginning, the determination with which she had held to her purpose,  her boldness in following him to the Range, and her apparent endeavor  to work herself into his confidence&#8212;and with John Graham's signature  staring at him from the table these things seemed conclusive and  irrefutable evidence. The &#8220;industry&#8221; which Graham had referred to could  mean only his own and Carl Lomen's, the reindeer industry which they  had built up and were fighting to perpetuate, and which Graham and his  beef-baron friends were combining to handicap and destroy. And in this  game of destruction clever Mary Standish had come to play a part!
 <I> But why had she leaped into the sea?</I>
  It was as if a new voice had made itself heard in Alan's brain, a  voice that rose insistently over a vast tumult of things, crying out  against his arguments and demanding order and reason in place of the  mad convictions that possessed him. If Mary Standish's mission was to  pave the way for his ruin, and if she was John Graham's agent sent for  that purpose, what reason could she have had for so dramatically  attempting to give the world the impression that she had ended her life  at sea? Surely such an act could in no way have been related with any  plot which she might have had against him! In building up this  structure of her defense he made no effort to sever her relationship  with John Graham; that, he knew, was impossible. The note, her actions,  and many of the things she had said were links inevitably associating  her with his enemy, but these same things, now that they came pressing  one upon another in his memory, gave to their collusion a new  significance.
  Was it conceivable that Mary Standish, instead of working for John  Graham, was working<I> against</I> him? Could some conflict between  them have been the reason for her flight aboard the<I> Nome</I>, and  was it because she discovered Rossland there&#8212;John Graham's most  trusted servant&#8212;that she formed her desperate scheme of leaping into  the sea?
  Between the two oppositions of his thought a sickening burden of  what he knew to be true settled upon him. Mary Standish, even if she  hated John Graham now, had at one time&#8212;and not very long ago&#8212;been an  instrument of his trust; the letter he had written to her was positive  proof of that. What it was that had caused a possible split between  them and had inspired her flight from Seattle, and, later, her effort  to bury a past under the fraud of a make-believe death, he might never  learn, and just now he had no very great desire to look entirely into  the whole truth of the matter. It was enough to know that of the past,  and of the things that happened, she had been afraid, and it was in the  desperation of this fear, with Graham's cleverest agent at her heels,  that she had appealed to him in his cabin, and, failing to win him to  her assistance, had taken the matter so dramatically into her own  hands. And within that same hour a nearly successful attempt had been  made upon Rossland's life. Of course the facts had shown that she could  not have been directly responsible for his injury, but it was a  haunting thing to remember as happening almost simultaneously with her  disappearance into the sea.
  He drew away from the window and, opening the door, went out into  the night. Cool breaths of air gave a crinkly rattle to the swinging  paper lanterns, and he could hear the soft whipping of the flags which  Mary Standish had placed over his cabin. There was something comforting  in the sound, a solace to the dishevelment of nerves he had suffered, a  reminder of their day in Skagway when she had walked at his side with  her hand resting warmly in his arm and her eyes and face filled with  the inspiration of the mountains.
  No matter what she was, or had been, there was something tenaciously  admirable about her, a quality which had risen even above her feminine  loveliness. She had proved herself not only clever; she was inspired by  courage&#8212;a courage which he would have been compelled to respect even  in a man like John Graham, and in this slim and fragile girl it  appealed to him as a virtue to be laid up apart and aside from any of  the motives which might be directing it. From the beginning it had been  a bewildering part of her&#8212;a clean, swift, unhesitating courage that  had leaped bounds where his own volition and judgment would have hung  waveringly; that one courage in all the world&#8212;a woman's courage&#8212;which  finds in the effort of its achievement no obstacle too high and no  abyss too wide though death waits with outreaching arms on the other  side. And, surely, where there had been all this, there must also have  been some deeper and finer impulse than one of destruction, of physical  gain, or of mere duty in the weaving of a human scheme.
  The thought and the desire to believe brought words half aloud from  Alan's lips, as he looked up again at the flags beating softly above  his cabin. Mary Standish was not what Stampede's discovery had  proclaimed her to be; there was some mistake, a monumental stupidity of  reasoning on their part, and tomorrow would reveal the littleness and  the injustice of their suspicions. He tried to force the conviction  upon himself, and reentering the cabin he went to bed, still telling  himself that a great lie had built itself up out of nothing, and that  the God of all things was good to him because Mary Standish was alive,  and not dead.
