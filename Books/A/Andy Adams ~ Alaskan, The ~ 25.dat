  That in the lust and passion of his designs and the arrogance of his  power John Graham was not afraid to overstep all law and order, and  that he believed Holt would shelter Mary Standish from injury and  death, there could no longer be a doubt after the first few swift  moments following Sokwenna's rifle-shots from the attic window.
  Through the window of the lower room, barricaded by the cautious old  warrior until its aperture was not more than eight inches square, Alan  thrust his rifle as the crash of gun-fire broke the gray and thickening  mist of night. He could hear the thud and hiss of bullets; he heard  them singing like angry bees as they passed with the swiftness of  chain-lightning over the cabin roof, and their patter against the log  walls was like the hollow drumming of knuckles against the side of a  ripe watermelon. There was something fascinating and almost gentle  about that last sound. It did not seem that the horror of death was  riding with it, and Alan lost all sense of fear as he stared in the  direction from which the firing came, trying to make out shadows at  which to shoot. Here and there he saw dim, white streaks, and at these  he fired as fast as he could throw cartridges into the chamber and pull  the trigger. Then he crouched down with the empty gun. It was Mary  Standish who held out a freshly loaded weapon to him. Her face was  waxen in its deathly pallor. Her eyes, staring at him so strangely,  never for an instant leaving his face, were lustrous with the agony of  fear that flamed in their depths. She was not afraid for herself. It  was for<I> him</I>. His name was on her lips, a whisper unspoken, a  breathless prayer, and in that instant a bullet sped through the  opening in front of which he had stood a moment before, a hissing,  writhing serpent of death that struck something behind them in its  venomous wrath. With a cry she flung up her arms about his bent head.
  &#8220;My God, they will kill you if you stand there!&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;Give  me up to them, Alan. If you love me&#8212;give me up!&#8221;
  A sudden spurt of white dust shot out into the dim candle-glow, and  then another, so near Nawadlook that his blood went cold. Bullets were  finding their way through the moss and earth chinking between the logs  of the cabin. His arms closed in a fierce embrace about the girl's slim  body, and before she could realize what was happening, he leaped to the  trap with her and almost flung her into its protection. Then he forced  Nawadlook down beside her, and after them he thrust in the empty gun  and the apron with its weight of cartridges. His face was demoniac in  its command.
  &#8220;If you don't stay there, I'll open the door and go outside to  fight! Do you understand?<I> Stay there!</I>&#8220;
  His clenched fist was in their faces, his voice almost a shout. He  saw another white spurt of dust; the bullet crashed in tinware, and  following the crash came a shriek from Keok in the attic.
  In that upper gloom Sokwenna's gun had fallen with a clatter. The  old warrior bent himself over, nearly double, and with his two withered  hands was clutching his stomach. He was on his knees, and his breath  suddenly came in a panting, gasping cry. Then he straightened slowly  and said something reassuring to Keok, and faced the window again with  the gun which she had loaded for him.
  The scream had scarcely gone from Keok's lips when Alan was at the  top of the ladder, calling her. She came to him through the stark  blackness of the room, sobbing that Sokwenna was hit; and Alan reached  out and seized her, and dragged her down, and placed her with Nawadlook  and Mary Standish.
  From them he turned to the window, and his soul cried out madly for  the power to see, to kill, to avenge. As if in answer to this prayer  for light and vision he saw his cabin strangely illumined; dancing,  yellow radiance silhouetted the windows, and a stream of it billowed  out through an open door into the night. It was so bright he could see  the rain-mist, scarcely heavier than a dense, slowly descending fog, a  wet blanket of vapor moistening the earth. His heart jumped as with  each second the blaze of light increased. They had set fire to his  cabin. They were no longer white men, but savages.
  He was terribly cool, even as his heart throbbed so violently. He  watched with the eyes of a deadly hunter, wide-open over his  rifle-barrel. Sokwenna was still. Probably he was dead. Keok was  sobbing in the cellar-pit. Then he saw a shape growing in the  illumination, three or four of them, moving, alive. He waited until  they were clearer, and he knew what they were thinking&#8212;that the  bullet-riddled cabin had lost its power to fight. He prayed God it was  Graham he was aiming at, and fired. The figure went down, sank into the  earth as a dead man falls. Steadily he fired at the others&#8212;one, two,  three, four&#8212;and two out of the four he hit, and the exultant thought  flashed upon him that it was good shooting under the circumstances.
  He sprang back for another gun, and it was Mary who was waiting for  him, head and shoulders out of the cellar-pit, the rifle in her hands.  She was sobbing as she looked straight at him, yet without moisture or  tears in her eyes.
  &#8220;Keep down!&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Keep down below the floor!&#8221;
  He guessed what was coming. He had shown his enemies that life still  existed in the cabin, life with death in its hands, and now&#8212;from the  shelter of the other cabins, from the darkness, from beyond the light  of his flaming home, the rifle fire continued to grow until it filled  the night with a horrible din. He flung himself face-down upon the  floor, so that the lower log of the building protected him. No living  thing could have stood up against what was happening in these moments.  Bullets tore through the windows and between the moss-chinked logs,  crashing against metal and glass and tinware; one of the candles  sputtered and went out, and in this hell Alan heard a cry and saw Mary  Standish coming out of the cellar-pit toward him. He had flung himself  down quickly, and she thought he was hit! He shrieked at her, and his  heart froze with horror as he saw a heavy tress of her hair drop to the  floor as she stood there in that frightful moment, white and glorious  in the face of the gun-fire. Before she could move another step, he was  at her side, and with her in his arms leaped into the pit.
  A bullet sang over them. He crushed her so close that for a breath  or two life seemed to leave her body.
  A sudden draught of cool air struck his face. He missed Nawadlook.  In the deeper gloom farther under the floor he heard her moving, and  saw a faint square of light. She was creeping back. Her hands touched  his arm.
  &#8220;We can get away&#8212;there!&#8221; she cried in a low voice. &#8220;I have opened  the little door. We can crawl through it and into the ravine.&#8221;
  Her words and the square of light were an inspiration. He had not  dreamed that Graham would turn the cabin into a death-hole, and  Nawadlook's words filled him with a sudden thrilling hope. The rifle  fire was dying away again as he gave voice to his plan in sharp, swift  words. He would hold the cabin. As long as he was there Graham and his  men would not dare to rush it. At least they would hesitate a  considerable time before doing that. And meanwhile the girls could  steal down into the ravine. There was no one on that side to intercept  them, and both Keok and Nawadlook were well acquainted with the trails  into the mountains. It would mean safety for them. He would remain in  the cabin, and fight, until Stampede Smith and the herdsmen came.
  The white face against his breast was cold and almost  expressionless. Something in it frightened him. He knew his argument  had failed and that Mary Standish would not go; yet she did not answer  him, nor did her lips move in the effort.
  &#8220;Go&#8212;for<I> their</I> sakes, if not for your own and mine,&#8221; he  insisted, holding her away from him. &#8220;Good God, think what it will mean  if beasts like those out there get hold of Keok and Nawadlook! Graham  is your husband and will protect you for himself, but for them there  will be no hope, no salvation, nothing but a fate more terrible than  death. They will be like&#8212;like two beautiful lambs thrown among  wolves&#8212;broken&#8212;destroyed&#8212;&#8221;
  Her eyes were burning with horror. Keok was sobbing, and a moan  which she bravely tried to smother in her breast came from Nawadlook.
  &#8220;And<I> you!</I>&#8221; whispered Mary.
  &#8220;I must remain here. It is the only way.&#8221;
  Dumbly she allowed him to lead her back with Keok and Nawadlook.  Keok went through the opening first, then Nawadlook, and Mary Standish  last. She did not touch him again. She made no movement toward him and  said no word, and all he remembered of her when she was gone in the  gloom was her eyes. In that last look she had given him her soul, and  no whisper, no farewell caress came with it.
  &#8220;Go cautiously until you are out of the ravine, then hurry toward  the mountains,&#8221; were his last words.
  He saw their forms fade into dim shadows, and the gray mist  swallowed them.
  He hurried back, seized a loaded gun, and sprang to the window,  knowing that he must continue to deal death until he was killed. Only  in that way could he hold Graham back and give those who had escaped a  chance for their lives. Cautiously he looked out over his gun barrel.  His cabin was a furnace red with flame; streams of fire were licking  out at the windows and through the door, and as he sought vainly for a  movement of life, the crackling roar of it came to his ears, and so  swiftly that his breath choked him, the pitch-filled walls became  sheets of conflagration, until the cabin was a seething, red-hot torch  of fire whose illumination was more dazzling than the sun of day.
  Out into this illumination suddenly stalked a figure waving a white  sheet at the end of a long pole. It advanced slowly, a little  hesitatingly at first, as if doubtful of what might happen; and then it  stopped, full in the light, an easy mark for a rifle aimed from  Sokwenna's cabin. He saw who it was then, and drew in his rifle and  watched the unexpected maneuver in amazement. The man was Rossland. In  spite of the dramatic tenseness of the moment Alan could not repress  the grim smile that came to his lips. Rossland was a man of illogical  resource, he meditated. Only a short time ago he had fled ignominiously  through fear of personal violence, while now, with a courage that could  not fail to rouse admiration, he was exposing himself to a swift and  sudden death, protected only by the symbol of truce over his head. That  he owed this symbol either regard or honor did not for an instant  possess Alan. A murderer held it, a man even more vile than a murderer  if such a creature existed on earth, and for such a man death was a  righteous end. Only Rossland's nerve, and what he might have to say,  held back the vengeance within reach of Alan's hand.
  He waited, and Rossland again advanced and did not stop until he was  within a hundred feet of the cabin. A sudden disturbing thought flashed  upon Alan as he heard his name called. He had seen no other figures, no  other shadows beyond Rossland, and the burning cabin now clearly  illumined the windows of Sokwenna's place. Was it conceivable that  Rossland was merely a lure, and the instant he exposed himself in a  parley a score of hidden rifles would reveal their treachery? He  shuddered and held himself below the opening of the window. Graham and  his men were more than capable of such a crime.
  Rossland's voice rose above the crackle and roar of the burning  cabin. &#8220;Alan Holt! Are you there?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I am here,&#8221; shouted Alan, &#8220;and I have a line on your heart,  Rossland, and my finger is on the trigger. What do you want?&#8221;
  There was a moment of silence, as if the thought of what he was  facing had at last stricken Rossland dumb. Then he said: &#8220;We are giving  you a last chance, Holt. For God's sake, don't be a fool! The offer I  made you today is still good. If you don't accept it&#8212;the law must take  its course.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>The law!</I>&#8221; Alan's voice was a savage cry.
  &#8220;Yes, the law. The law is with us. We have the proper authority to  recover a stolen wife, a captive, a prisoner held in restraint with  felonious intent. But we don't want to press the law unless we are  forced to do so. You and the old Eskimo have killed three of our men  and wounded two others. That means the hangman, if we take you alive.  But we are willing to forget that if you will accept the offer I made  you today. What do you say?&#8221;
  Alan was stunned. Speech failed him as he realized the monstrous  assurance with which Graham and Rossland were playing their game. And  when he made no answer Rossland continued to drive home his arguments,  believing that at last Alan was at the point of surrender.
  Up in the dark attic the voices had come like ghost-land whispers to  old Sokwenna. He lay huddled at the window, and the chill of death was  creeping over him. But the voices roused him. They were not strange  voices, but voices which came up out of a past of many years ago,  calling upon him, urging him, persisting in his ears with cries of  vengeance and of triumph, the call of familiar names, a moaning of  women, a sobbing of children. Shadowy hands helped him, and a last time  he raised himself to the window, and his eyes were filled with the  glare of the burning cabin. He struggled to lift his rifle, and behind  him he heard the exultation of his people as he rested it over the sill  and with gasping breath leveled it at something which moved between him  and the blazing light of that wonderful sun which was the burning  cabin. And then, slowly and with difficulty, he pressed the trigger,  and Sokwenna's last shot sped on its mission.
  At the sound of the shot Alan looked through the window. For a  moment Rossland stood motionless. Then the pole in his hands wavered,  drooped, and fell to the earth, and Rossland sank down after it making  no sound, and lay a dark and huddled blot on the ground.
  The appalling swiftness and ease with which Rossland had passed from  life into death shocked every nerve in Alan's body. Horror for a brief  space stupefied him, and he continued to stare at the dark and  motionless blot, forgetful of his own danger, while a grim and terrible  silence followed the shot. And then what seemed to be a single cry  broke that silence, though it was made up of many men's voices. Deadly  and thrilling, it was a message that set Alan into action. Rossland had  been killed under a flag of truce, and even the men under Graham had  something like respect for that symbol. He could expect no  mercy&#8212;nothing now but the most terrible of vengeance at their hands,  and as he dodged back from the window he cursed Sokwenna under his  breath, even as he felt the relief of knowing he was not dead.
  Before a shot had been fired from outside, he was up the ladder; in  another moment he was bending over the huddled form of the old Eskimo.
  &#8220;Come below!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;We must be ready to leave through the  cellar-pit.&#8221;
  His hand touched Sokwenna's face; it hesitated, groped in the  darkness, and then grew still over the old warrior's heart. There was  no tremor or beat of life in the aged beast. Sokwenna was dead.
  The guns of Graham's men opened fire again. Volley after volley  crashed into the cabin as Alan descended the ladder. He could hear  bullets tearing through the chinks and windows as he turned quickly to  the shelter of the pit.
  He was amazed to find that Mary Standish had returned and was  waiting for him there.
