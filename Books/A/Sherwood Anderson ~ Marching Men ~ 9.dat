The matter of McGregor's attitude toward women and the call of sex was  not of course settled by the fight in the house in Lake Street. He was  a man who, even in the days of his great crudeness, appealed strongly  to the mating instinct in women and more than once his purpose was to  be shaken and his mind disturbed by the forms, the faces and the eyes  of women.    
McGregor thought he had settled the matter. He forgot the black-eyed  girl in the hallway and thought only of advancement in the warehouse  and of study in his room at night. Now and then he took an evening off  and went for a walk through the streets or in one of the parks.    
In the streets of Chicago, under the night lights, among the restless  moving people he was a figure to be remembered. Sometimes he did not  see the people at all but went swinging along in the same spirit in  which he had walked in the Pennsylvania hills. He was striving to get  a hold of some elusive quality in life that seemed to be forever out  of reach. He did not want to be a lawyer or a warehouseman. What did  he want? Along the street he went trying to make up his mind and  because his was not a gentle nature his perplexity drove him to anger  and he swore.    
Up and down Madison Street he went striding along, his lips muttering  words. In a corner saloon some one played a piano. Groups of girls  passed laughing and talking. He came to the bridge that led over the  river into the loop district and then turned restlessly back. On the  sidewalks along Canal Street he saw strong-bodied men loitering before  cheap lodging houses. Their clothing was filthy with long wear and  there was no light of determination in their faces. In the little fine  interstices of the cloth of which their clothes were made was gathered  the filth of the city in which they lived and in the stuff of their  natures the filth and disorder of modern civilisation had also found  lodging.    
On walked McGregor looking at man-made things and the flame of anger  within burned stronger and stronger. He saw the drifting clouds of  people of all nations that wander at night in Halstead Street and  turning into a side street saw also the Italians, Poles and Russians  that at evening gather on the sidewalks before tenements in that  district.    
The desire in McGregor for some kind of activity became a madness. His  body shook with the strength of his desire to end the vast disorder of  life. With all the ardour of youth he wanted to see if with the  strength of his arm he could shake mankind out of its sloth. A drunken  man passed and following him came a large man with a pipe in his  mouth. The large man did not walk with any suggestion of power in his  legs. He shambled along. He was like a huge child with fat cheeks and  great untrained body, a child without muscles and hardness, clinging  to the skirts of life.    
McGregor could not bear the sight of the big ungainly figure. The man  seemed to personify all of the things against which his soul was in  revolt and he stopped and stood crouched, a ferocious light burning in  his eyes.    
Into the gutter rolled the man stunned by the force of the blow dealt  him by the miner's son. He crawled on his hands and knees and cried  for help. His pipe had rolled away into the darkness. McGregor stood  on the sidewalk and waited. A crowd of men standing before a tenement  house started to run toward him. Again he crouched. He prayed that  they would come on and let him fight them also. In anticipation of a  great struggle joy shone in his eyes and his muscles twitched.    
And then the man in the gutter got to his feet and ran away. The men  who had started to run toward him stopped and turned back. McGregor  walked on, his heart heavy with the sense of defeat. He was a little  sorry for the man he had struck and who had made so ridiculous a  figure crawling about on his hands and knees and he was more perplexed  than ever.

McGregor tried again to solve the problem of women. He had been much  pleased by the outcome of the affair in the little frame house and the  next day bought law books with the twenty-seven dollars thrust into  his hand by the frightened woman. Later he stood in his room  stretching his great body like a lion returned from the kill and  thought of the little black-bearded barber in the room at the end of  the hall stooping over his violin, his mind busy with the attempt to  justify himself because he would not face one of life's problems. The  feeling of resentment against the man had gone. He thought of the  course laid out for himself by that philosopher and laughed. "There is  something about it to avoid, like giving yourself up to digging in the  dirt under the ground," he told himself.    
McGregor's second adventure began on a Saturday night and again he let  himself be led into it by the barber. The night was hot and the  younger man sat in his room filled with a desire to go forth and  explore the city. The quiet of the house, the distant rumble of street  cars, the sound of a band playing far down the street disturbed and  diverted his mind. He wished that he might take a stick in his hands  and go forth to prowl among the hills as he had gone on such nights in  his youth in the Pennsylvania town.    
The door to his room opened and the barber came in. In his hand he  held two tickets. He sat on the window sill to explain.    
"There is a dance in a hall on Monroe Street," said the barber  excitedly. "I have two tickets here. A politician sold them to the  boss in the shop where I work." The barber threw back his head and  laughed. To his mind there was something delicious in the thought of  the boss barber being forced by the politicians to buy dance tickets.  "They cost two dollars each," he cried and shook with laughter "You  should have seen my boss squirm. He didn't want the tickets but was  afraid not to take them. The politician could make trouble for him and  he knew it. You see we make a hand-book on the races in the shop and  that is against the law. The politician could make trouble for us. The  boss paid out the four dollars swearing under his breath and when the  politician had gone out he threw them at me. 'There, take them,' he  shouted, 'I don't want the rotten things. Is a man a horse trough at  which every beast can stop to drink?'"    
McGregor and the barber sat in the room laughing at the boss barber  who had smilingly bought the tickets while consumed with inward wrath.  The barber urged McGregor to go with him to the dance. "We will make a  night of it," he said. "We will see women there--two that I know. They  live upstairs over a grocery store. I have been with them. They will  open your eyes. They are a kind of women you haven't known, bold and  clever and good fellows too."    
McGregor got up and pulled his shirt over his head. A wave of feverish  excitement ran over his body. "We shall see about this," he said, "we  shall see if this is another wrong trail you are starting me on. You  go to your room and get ready. I am going to fix myself up."    
In the dance hall McGregor sat on a seat by the wall with one of the  two women lauded by the barber and a third one who was frail and  bloodless. To him the adventure had been a failure. The swing of the  dance music struck no answering chord in him. He saw the couples on  the floor clasped in each other's arms, writhing and turning, swaying  back and forth, looking into each other's eyes and turned aside  wishing himself back in his room among the law books.    
The barber talked to two of the women, bantering them. McGregor  thought the conversation inane and trivial. It skirted the edge of  things and ran off into vague references to other times and adventures  of which he knew nothing.    
The barber danced away with one of the women. She was tall and the  head of the barber barely Passed her shoulder. His black beard shone  against her white dress. The two women sat beside him and talked.  McGregor gathered that the frail woman was a maker of hats. Something  about her attracted him and he leaned against the wall and looked at  her, not hearing the talk.    
A youth came up and took the other woman away. From across the hall  the barber beckoned to him.    
A thought flashed into his mind. This woman beside him was frail and  thin and bloodless like the women of Coal Creek. A feeling of intimacy  with her came over him. He felt as he had felt concerning the tall  pale girl of Coal Creek when they together gether had climbed the hill  to the eminence that looked down into the valley of farms.
