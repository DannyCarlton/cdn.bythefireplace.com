  &#8220;You are getting on finely, Harry,&#8221; said Oscar Vincent, a fortnight  later. &#8220;You do credit to my teaching. As you have been over all the  regular verbs now, I will give you a lesson in translating.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall find that interesting,&#8221; said Harry, with satisfaction.
  &#8220;Here is a French Reader,&#8221; said Oscar, taking one down from the  shelves. &#8220;It has a dictionary at the end. I won't give you a lesson.  You may take as much as you have time for, and at the same time three  or four of the irregular verbs. You are going about three times as fast  as I did when I commenced French.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps I have a better teacher than you had,&#8221; said Harry, smiling.
  &#8220;I shouldn't wonder,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;That explains it to my  satisfaction. Well, now the lesson is over, sit down and we'll have a  chat. Oh, by the way, there's one thing I want to speak to you about.  We've got a debating society at our school. It is called 'The Clionian  Society.' Most of the students belong to it. How would you like to  join?&#8221;
  &#8220;I should like it very much. Do you think they would admit me?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see why not. I'll propose you at the next meeting, Thursday  evening. Then the nomination will lie over a week, and be acted upon at  the next meeting.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish you would. I never belonged to a debating society, but I  should like to learn to speak.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's nothing when you're used to it. It's only the first time you  know, that troubles you. By Jove! I remember how my knees trembled when  I first got up and said Mr. President. I felt as if all eyes were upon  me, and I wanted to sink through the floor. Now I can get up and  chatter with the best of them. I don't mean that I can make an eloquent  speech or anything of that kind, but I can talk at a minute's notice on  almost any subject.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I could.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, you can, after you've tried a few times. Well, then, it's  settled. I'll propose you at the next meeting.&#8221;
  &#8220;How lucky I am to have fallen in with you, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know what you mean. I'm your guide, philosopher, and friend, and  all that sort of thing. I hope you'll have proper veneration for me.  It's rather a new character for me. Would you believe it, Harry,&#8212;at  home I am regarded as a rattle-brained chap, instead of the dignified  Professor that you know me to be. Isn't it a shame?&#8221;
  &#8220;Great men are seldom appreciated at home, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know that. I shall have to get a certificate from you, certifying  to my being a steady and erudite young man.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll give it with the greatest pleasure.&#8221;
  &#8220;Holloa, there's a knock. Come in!&#8221; shouted Oscar.
  The door opened, and Fitzgerald Fletcher entered the room.
  &#8220;How are you, Fitz?&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;Sit down and make yourself  comfortable. You know my friend, Harry Walton, I believe?&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe I had the honor to meet him here one evening,&#8221; said  Fitzgerald stiffly, slightly emphasizing the word &#8220;honor.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope you are well, Mr. Fletcher,&#8221; said Harry, more amused than  disturbed by the manner of the aristocratic visitor.
  &#8220;Thank you, my health is good,&#8221; said Fitzgerald with equal  stiffness, and forthwith turned to Oscar, not deigning to devote any  more attention to Harry.
  Our hero had intended to remain a short time longer, but, under the  circumstances, as Oscar's attention would be occupied by Fletcher, with  whom he was not on intimate terms, he thought he might spend the  evening more profitably at home in study.
  &#8220;If you'll excuse me, Oscar,&#8221; he said, rising, &#8220;I will leave you  now, as I have something to do this evening.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you insist upon it, Harry, I will excuse you. Come round Friday  evening.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you have to work at the printing office in the evening?&#8221;  Fletcher deigned to inquire.
  &#8220;No; I have some studying to do.&#8221;
  &#8220;Reading and spelling, I suppose,&#8221; sneered Fletcher.
  &#8220;I am studying French.&#8221;
  &#8220;Indeed!&#8221; returned Fletcher, rather surprised. &#8220;How can you study it  without a teacher?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have a teacher.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Professor Vincent,&#8221; said Harry, smiling.
  &#8220;You didn't know that I had developed into a French Professor, did  you, Fitz? Well, it's so, and whether it's the superior teaching or  not, I can't say, but my scholar is getting on famously.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must be a great bore to teach,&#8221; said Fletcher.
  &#8220;Not at all. I like it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Every one to his taste,&#8221; said Fitzgerald unpleasantly.
  &#8220;Good-night, Oscar. Good-night, Mr. Fletcher,&#8221; said Harry, and made  his exit.
  &#8220;You're a strange fellow, Oscar,&#8221; said Fletcher, after Harry's  departure.
  &#8220;Very likely, but what particular strangeness do you refer to now?&#8221;
  &#8220;No one but you would think of giving lessons to a printer's devil.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know about that.&#8221;
  &#8220;No one, I mean, that holds your position in society.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know that I hold any particular position in society.&#8221;
  &#8220;Your family live on Beacon Street, and move in the first circles. I  am sure my mother would be disgusted if I should demean myself so far  as to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't propose to give lessons to any vulgar apprentice.&#8221;
  &#8220;You know whom I mean. This Walton is only a printer's devil.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know that that is any objection to him. It isn't morally  wrong to be a printer's devil, is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;What a queer fellow you are, Oscar. Of course I don't mean that. I  daresay he's well enough in his place, though he seems to be very  forward and presuming, but you know that he's not your equal.&#8221;
  &#8220;He is not my equal in knowledge, but I shouldn't be surprised if he  would be some time. You'd be astonished to see how fast he gets on.&#8221;
  &#8220;I daresay. But I mean in social position.&#8221;
  &#8220;It seems to me you can't think of anything but social position.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, it's worth thinking about.&#8221;
  &#8220;No doubt, as far as it is deserved. But when it is founded on  nothing but money, I wouldn't give much for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course we all know that the higher classes are more refined&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Than printers' devils and vulgar apprentices, I suppose,&#8221; put in  Oscar, laughing,
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, if refinement consists in wearing kid gloves and stunning  neckties, I suppose the higher classes, as you call them, are more  refined.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean me?&#8221; demanded Fletcher, who was noted for the character  of his neckties.
  &#8220;Well, I can't say I don't. I suppose you regard yourself as a  representative of the higher classes, don't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;To be sure I do,&#8221; said Fletcher, complacently.
  &#8220;So I supposed. Then you see I had a right to refer to you. Now  listen to my prediction. Twenty-five years from now, the boy whom you  look down upon as a vulgar apprentice will occupy a high position, and  you will be glad to number him among your acquaintances.&#8221;
  &#8220;Speak for yourself, Oscar,&#8221; said Fletcher, scornfully.
  &#8220;I speak for both of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I say I hope I can command better associates than this friend  of yours.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may, but I doubt it.&#8221;
  &#8220;You seem to be carried away by him,&#8221; said Fitzgerald, pettishly. &#8220;I  don't see anything very wonderful about him, except dirty hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you have seen more than I have.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course a fellow who meddles with printer's ink must have dirty  hands. Faugh!&#8221; said Fletcher, turning up his nose.
  At the same time he regarded complacently his own fingers, which he  carefully kept aloof from anything that would soil or mar their  aristocratic whiteness.
  &#8220;The fact is, Fitz,&#8221; said Oscar, argumentatively, &#8220;our upper ten, as  we call them, spring from just such beginnings as my friend Harry  Walton. My own father commenced life in a printing office. But, as you  say, he occupies a high position at present.&#8221;
  &#8220;Really!&#8221; said Fletcher, a little taken aback, for he knew that  Vincent's father ranked higher than his own.
  &#8220;I daresay your own ancestors were not always patricians.&#8221;
  Fletcher winced. He knew well enough that his father commenced life  as a boy in a country grocery, but in the mutations of fortune had  risen to be the proprietor of a large dry-goods store on Washington  Street. None of the family cared to look back to the beginning of his  career. They overlooked the fact that it was creditable to him to have  risen from the ranks, though the rise was only in wealth, for Mr.  Fletcher was a purse-proud parvenu, who owed all the consideration he  enjoyed to his commercial position. Fitz liked to have it understood  that he was of patrician lineage, and carefully ignored the little  grocery, and certain country relations who occasionally paid a visit to  their wealthy relatives, in spite of the rather frigid welcome they  received.
  &#8220;Oh, I suppose there are exceptions,&#8221; Fletcher admitted reluctantly.  &#8220;Your father was smart.&#8221;
  &#8220;So is Harry Walton. I know what he is aiming at, and I predict that  he will be an influential editor some day.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you got your Greek lesson?&#8221; asked Fletcher, abruptly, who did  not relish the course the conversation had taken.
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I want you to translate a passage for me. I couldn't make it  out.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right.&#8221;
  Half an hour later Fletcher left Vincent's room.
  &#8220;What a snob he is!&#8221; thought Oscar.
  And Oscar was right.
