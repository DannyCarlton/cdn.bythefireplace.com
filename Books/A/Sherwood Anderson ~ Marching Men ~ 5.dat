It was late in the summer of 1893 when McGregor came to Chicago, an  ill time for boy or man in that city. The big exposition of the year  before had brought multiplied thousands of restless labourers into the  city and its leading citizens, who had clamoured for the exposition  and had loudly talked of the great growth that was to come, did not  know what to do with the growth now that it had come. The depression  that followed on the heels of the great show and the financial panic  that ran over the country in that year had set thousands of hungry men  to wait dumbly on park benches poring over want advertisements in the  daily papers and looking vacantly at the lake or had driven them to  tramp aimlessly through the streets, filled with forebodings.    
In time of plenty a great American city like Chicago goes on showing a  more or less cheerful face to the world while in nooks and crannies  down side-streets and alleys poverty and misery sit hunched up in  little ill-smelling rooms breeding vice. In times of depression these  creatures crawl forth and joined by thousands of the unemployed tramp  the streets through the long nights or sleep upon benches in the  parks. In the alleyways off Madison Street on the West Side and off  State Street, on the South Side, eager women driven by want sold their  bodies to passersby for twenty-five cents. An advertisement in the  newspapers of one unfilled job brought a thousand men to block the  streets at daylight before a factory door. In the crowds men swore and  knocked each other about. Working-men driven to desperation went forth  into quiet streets and knocking over citizens took their money and  watches and ran trembling into the darkness. A girl of Twenty-fourth  Street was kicked and knocked into the gutter because when attacked by  thieves she had but thirty-five cents in her purse. A professor of the  University of Chicago addressing his class said that, having looked  into the hungry distorted faces of five hundred men clamouring for a  position as dishwasher in a cheap restaurant, he was ready to  pronounce all claims to social advancement in America a figment in the  brains of optimistic fools. A tall awkward man walking up State Street  threw a stone through the window of a store. A policeman hustled him  through the crowd. "You'll get a workhouse sentence for this," he  said.    
"You fool that's what I want. I want to make property that won't  employ me feed me," said the tall gaunt man who, trained in the  cleaner and more wholesome poverty of the frontier, might have been a  Lincoln suffering for mankind.    
Into this maelstrom of misery and grim desperate want walked Beaut  McGregor of Coal Creek--huge, graceless of body, indolent of mind,  untrained, uneducated, hating the world. Within two days he had  snatched before the very eyes of that hungry marching army three  prizes, three places where a man might by working all day get clothes  to wear upon his back and food to put into his stomach.    
In a way McGregor had already sensed something the realisation of  which will go far toward making any man a strong figure in the world.  He was not to be bullied with words. Orators might have preached to  him all day about the progress of mankind in America, flags might have  been flapped and newspapers might have dinned the wonders of his  country into his brain. He would only have shaken his big head. He did  not yet know the whole story of how men, coming out of Europe and  given millions of square miles of black fertile land mines and  forests, have failed in the challenge given them by fate and have  produced out of the stately order of nature only the sordid disorder  of man. McGregor did not know the fullness of the tragic story of his  race. He only knew that the men he had seen were for the most part  pigmies. On the train coming to Chicago a change had come over him.  The hatred of Coal Creek that burned in him had set fire to something  else. He sat looking out of the car window at the stations running  past during the night and the following day at the cornfields of  Indiana, making his plans. In Chicago he meant to do something. Coming  from a community where no man arose above a condition of silent brute  labour he meant to step up into the light of power. Filled with hatred  and contempt of mankind he meant that mankind should serve him. Raised  among men who were but men he meant to be a master.    
And his equipment was better than he knew. In a disorderly haphazard  world hatred is as effective an impulse to drive men forward to  success as love and high hope. It is a world-old impulse sleeping in  the heart of man since the day of Cain. In a way it rings true and  strong above the hideous jangle of modern life. Inspiring fear it  usurps power.    
McGregor was without fear. He had not yet met his master and looked  with contempt upon the men and women he had known. Without knowing it  he had, besides a huge body hard as adamant, a clear and lucid brain.  The fact that he hated Coal Creek and thought it horrible proved his  keenness. It was horrible. Well might Chicago have trembled and rich  men strolling in the evening along Michigan Boulevard have looked  fearfully about as this huge red fellow, carrying the cheap handbag  and staring with his blue eyes at the restless moving mobs of people,  walked for the first time through its streets. In his very frame there  was the possibility of something, a blow, a shock, a thrust out of the  lean soul of strength into the jelly-like fleshiness of weakness.    
In the world of men nothing is so rare as a knowledge of men. Christ  himself found the merchants hawking their wares even on the floor of  the temple and in his naive youth was stirred to wrath and drove them  through the door like flies. And history has represented him in turn  as a man of peace so that after these centuries the temples are again  supported by the hawking of wares and his fine boyish wrath is  forgotten. In France after the great revolution and the babbling of  many voices talking of the brotherhood of man it wanted but a short  and very determined man with an instinctive knowledge of drums, of  cannons and of stirring words to send the same babblers screaming  across open spaces, stumbling through ditches and pitching headlong  into the arms of death. In the interest of one who believed not at all  in the brotherhood of man they who had wept at the mention of the word  brotherhood died fighting brothers.    
In the heart of all men lies sleeping the love of order. How to  achieve order out of our strange jumble of forms, out of democracies  and monarchies, dreams and endeavours is the riddle of the Universe  and the thing that in the artist is called the passion for form and  for which he also will laugh in the face of death is in all men. By  grasping that fact Caesar, Alexander, Napoleon and our own Grant have  made heroes of the dullest clods that walk and not a man of all the  thousands who marched with Sherman to the sea but lived the rest of  his life with a something sweeter, braver and finer sleeping in his  soul than will ever be produced by the reformer scolding of  brotherhood from a soap-box. The long march, the burning of the throat  and the stinging of the dust in the nostrils, the touch of shoulder  against shoulder, the quick bond of a common, unquestioned,  instinctive passion that bursts in the orgasm of battle, the  forgetting of words and the doing of the thing, be it winning battles  or destroying ugliness, the passionate massing of men for  accomplishment--these are the signs, if they ever awake in our land,  by which you may know you have come to the days of the making of men.    
In Chicago in 1893 and in the men who went aimlessly seeking work in  the streets of Chicago in that year there were none of these signs.  Like the coal mining town from which Beaut McGregor had come, the city  lay sprawling and ineffective before him, a tawdry disorderly dwelling  for millions of men, built not for the making of men but for the  making of millions by a few odd meat-packers and drygoods merchants.    
With a slight lifting of his great shoulders McGregor sensed these  things although he could not have expressed his sense of them and the  hatred and contempt of men, born of his youth in the mining town, was  rekindled by the sight of city men wandering afraid and bewildered  through the streets of their own city.    
Knowing nothing of the customs of the unemployed McGregor did not walk  the streets looking for signs marked "Men Wanted." He did not sit on  park benches studying want advertisements, the want advertisements  that so often proved but bait put out by suave men up dirty stairways  to glean the last few pennies from pockets of the needy. Going along  the street he swung his great body through the doorways leading to the  offices of factories. When some pert young man tried to stop him he  did not say words but drew back his fist threateningly and, glowering,  walked in. The young men at the doors of factories looked at his blue  eyes and let him pass unchallenged.    
In the afternoon of his first day of seeking Beaut got a place in an  apple warehouse on the North Side, the third place offered him during  the day and the one that he accepted. The chance came to him through  an exhibition of strength. Two men, old and bent, struggled to get a  barrel of apples from the sidewalk up to a platform that ran waist  high along the front of the warehouse. The barrel had rolled to the  sidewalk from a truck standing in the gutter. The driver of the truck  stood with his hands on his hips, laughing. A German with blond hair  stood upon the platform swearing in broken English. McGregor stood  upon the sidewalk and looked at the two men who were struggling with  the barrel. A feeling of immense contempt for their feebleness shone  in his eyes. Pushing them aside he grasped the barrel and with a great  heave sent it up onto the platform and spinning through an open  doorway into the receiving room of the warehouse. The two workmen  stood on the sidewalk smiling sheepishly. Across the street a group of  city firemen who lounged in the sun before an engine house clapped  their hands. The truck driver turned and prepared to send another  barrel along the plank extending from the truck across the sidewalk to  the warehouse platform. At a window in the upper part of the warehouse  a grey head protruded and a sharp voice called down to the tall  German. "Hey Frank, hire that 'husky' and let about six of the dead  ones you've got around here go home."    
McGregor jumped upon the platform and walked in at the warehouse door.  The German followed, inventorying the size of the red-haired giant  with something like disapproval. His look seemed to say, "I like  strong fellows but you're too strong." He took the discomfiture of the  two feeble workmen on the sidewalk as in some way reflecting upon  himself. The two men stood in the receiving room and looked at each  other. A bystander might have thought them preparing to fight.    
And then a freight elevator came slowly down from the upper part of  the warehouse and from it jumped a small grey-haired man with a yard  stick in his hand. He had a sharp restless eye and a short stubby grey  beard. Striking the floor with a bound he began to talk. "We pay two  dollars for nine hours' work here--begin at seven, quit at five. Will  you come?" Without waiting for an answer he turned to the German.  "Tell those two old 'rummies' to get their time and get out of here,"  he said, turning again and looking expectantly at McGregor.    
McGregor liked the quick little man and grinned with approval of his  decisiveness. He nodded his assent to the proposal and, looking at the  German, laughed. The little man disappeared through a door leading to  an office and McGregor walked out into the street. At a corner he  turned and saw the German standing on the platform before the  warehouse looking after him. "He is wondering whether or not he can  whip me," thought McGregor.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
In the apple warehouse McGregor worked for three years, rising during  his second year to be foreman and replacing the tall German. The  German expected trouble with McGregor and was determined to make short  work of him. He had been offended by the action of the gray-haired  superintendent in hiring the man and felt that a prerogative belonging  to himself had been ignored. All day he followed McGregor with his  eyes, trying to calculate the strength and courage in the huge body.  He knew that hundreds of hungry men walked the streets and in the end  decided that the need of work if not the spirit of the man would make  him submissive. During the second week he put the question that burned  in his brain to the test. He followed McGregor into a dimly-lighted  upper room where barrels of apples, piled to the ceiling, left only  narrow ways for passage. Standing in the semi-darkness he shouted,  calling the man who worked among the apple barrels a foul name, "I  won't have you loafing in there, you red-haired bastard," he shouted.    
McGregor said nothing. He was not offended by the vileness of the name  the German had called him and took it merely as a challenge that he  had been expecting and that he meant to accept. With a grim smile on  his lips he walked toward the German and when but one apple barrel lay  between them reached across and dragged the foreman sputtering and  swearing down the passageway to a window at the end of the room. By  the window he stopped and putting his hand to the throat of the  struggling man began to choke him into submission. Blows fell on his  face and body. Struggling terribly the German kicked McGregor's legs  with desperate energy. Although his ears rang with the hammer-like  blows that fell about his neck and cheeks McGregor stool silent under  the storm. His blue eyes gleamed with hatred and the muscles of his  great arms danced in the light from the window. As he looked into the  protruding eyes of the writhing German he thought of fat Reverend  Minot Weeks of Coal Creek and added an extra twitch to the flesh  between his fingers. When a gesture of submission came from the man  against the wall he stepped back and let go his grip. The German  dropped to the floor. Standing over him McGregor delivered his  ultimatum. "You report this or try to get me fired and I'll kill you  outright," he said. "I'm going to stay here on this job until I get  ready to leave it. You can tell me what to do and how to do it but  when you speak to me again say 'McGregor'--Mr. McGregor, that's my  name."    
The German got to his feet and began walking down the passageway  between the rows of piled barrels. As he went he helped himself along  with his hands. McGregor went back to work. After the retreating form  of the German he shouted, "Get a new place when you can Dutch, I'll be  taking this job away from you when I'm ready for it."    
That evening as McGregor walked to the car he saw the little grey-  haired superintendent standing waiting for him before a saloon. The  man made a sign and McGregor walked across and stood beside him. They  went together into the saloon and stood leaning against the bar and  looked at each other. A smile played about the lips of the little man.  "What have you been doing to Frank?" he asked.    
McGregor turned to the bartender who stood waiting before him. He  thought that the superintendent intended to try to patronise him by  buying him a drink and he did not like the thought. "What will you  have? I'll take a cigar for mine," he said quickly, defeating the  superintendent's plan by being the first to speak. When the bartender  brought the cigars McGregor paid for them and walked out at the door.  He felt like one playing a game. "If Frank meant to bully me into  submission this man also means something."    
On the sidewalk before the saloon McGregor stopped. "Look here," he  said, turning and facing the superintendent, "I'm after Frank's place.  I'm going to learn the business as fast as I can. I won't put it up to  you to fire him. When I get ready for the place he won't be there."    
A light flashed into the eyes of the little man. He held the cigar  McGregor had paid for as though about to throw it into the street.  "How far do you think you can go with your big fists?" he asked, his  voice rising.    
McGregor smiled. He thought he had earned another victory and lighting  his cigar held the burning match before the little man. "Brains are  intended to help fists," he said, "I've got both."    
The superintendent looked at the burning match and at the cigar  between his fingers. "If I don't which will you use on me?" he asked.    
McGregor threw the match into the street. "Aw! don't bother asking,"  he said, holding out another match.    
McGregor and the superintendent walked along the street. "I would like  to fire you but I won't. Some day you'll run that warehouse like a  clock," said the superintendent.    
McGregor sat in the street-car and thought of his day. It had been he  felt a day of two battles. First the direct brutal battle of fists in  the passageway and then this other battle with the superintendent. He  thought he had won both fights. Of the fight with the tall German he  thought little. He had expected to win that. The other was different.  The superintendent he felt had wanted to patronise him, patting him on  the back and buying him drinks. Instead he had patronised the  superintendent. A battle had gone on in the brains of the two men and  he had won. He had met a new kind of man, one who did not live by the  raw strength of his muscles and he had given a good account of  himself. The conviction that he had, besides a good pair of fists, a  good brain swept in on him glorifying him. He thought of the sentence,  "Brains are intended to help fists," and wondered how he had happened  to think of it.
