BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:<br> "Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us better<br> friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<br> Each of us all must his end abide<br> in the ways of the world; so win who may<br> glory ere death! When his days are told,<br> that is the warrior's worthiest doom.<br> Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<br> and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel.<br> No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! --<br> enfolding of field or forested mountain<br> or floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!<br> But thou this day endure in patience,<br> as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one."<br> Leaped up the graybeard: God he thanked,<br> mighty Lord, for the man's brave words.<br> For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled<br> wave-maned steed. The sovran wise<br> stately rode on; his shield-armed men<br> followed in force. The footprints led<br> along the woodland, widely seen,<br> a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and trod<br> the murky moor; of men-at-arms<br> she bore the bravest and best one, dead,<br> him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.<br> On then went the atheling-born<br> o'er stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,<br> narrow passes and unknown ways,<br> headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<br> Foremost he[1] fared, a few at his side<br> of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<br> till he found in a flash the forested hill<br> hanging over the hoary rock,<br> a woful wood: the waves below<br> were dyed in blood. The Danish men<br> had sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,<br> for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,<br> ill for earls, when Aeschere's head<br> they found by the flood on the foreland there.<br> Waves were welling, the warriors saw,<br> hot with blood; but the horn sang oft<br> battle-song bold. The band sat down,<br> and watched on the water worm-like things,<br> sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,<br> and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness --<br> such as oft essay at hour of morn<br> on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --<br> and sea-snakes and monsters. These started away,<br> swollen and savage that song to hear,<br> that war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,<br> with bolt from bow, then balked of life,<br> of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart<br> went the keen war-shaft; in water it seemed<br> less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.<br> Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well<br> hooked and barbed, it was hard beset,<br> done to death and dragged on the headland,<br> wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed<br> the grisly guest.<br> Then girt him Beowulf<br> in martial mail, nor mourned for his life.<br> His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<br> woven by hand, should the waters try;<br> well could it ward the warrior's body<br> that battle should break on his breast in vain<br> nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe.<br> And the helmet white that his head protected<br> was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,<br> through wave-whirl win: 'twas wound with chains,<br> decked with gold, as in days of yore<br> the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,<br> with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<br> brandished in battle, could bite that helm.<br> Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps<br> which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:<br> "Hrunting" they named the hilted sword,<br> of old-time heirlooms easily first;<br> iron was its edge, all etched with poison,<br> with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at fight<br> in hero's hand who held it ever,<br> on paths of peril prepared to go<br> to folkstead[2] of foes. Not first time this<br> it was destined to do a daring task.<br> For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<br> sturdy and strong, that speech he had made,<br> drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent<br> to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<br> under welter of waters wager his life<br> as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,<br> honor of earls. With the other not so,<br> who girded him now for the grim encounter.

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "Have mind, thou honored offspring of Healfdene<br> gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,<br> sovran wise, what once was said:<br> if in thy cause it came that I<br> should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide<br> to me, though fallen, in father's place!<br> Be guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,<br> my warrior-friends, if War should seize me;<br> and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<br> Hrothgar beloved, to Hygelac send!<br> Geatland's king may ken by the gold,<br> Hrethel's son see, when he stares at the treasure,<br> that I got me a friend for goodness famed,<br> and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.<br> And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,<br> earl far-honored, this heirloom precious,<br> hard of edge: with Hrunting I<br> seek doom of glory, or Death shall take me." 
After these words the Weder-Geat lord<br> boldly hastened, biding never<br> answer at all: the ocean floods<br> closed o'er the hero. Long while of the day<br> fled ere he felt the floor of the sea. 
Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain<br> sword-hungry held these hundred winters,<br> greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<br> some man, was raiding her monster-realm.<br> She grasped out for him with grisly claws,<br> and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<br> his body hale; the breastplate hindered,<br> as she strove to shatter the sark of war,<br> the linked harness, with loathsome hand.<br> Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,<br> the lord of rings to the lair she haunted<br> whiles vainly he strove, though his valor held,<br> weapon to wield against wondrous monsters<br> that sore beset him; sea-beasts many<br> tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail,<br> and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<br> he was now in some hall, he knew not which,<br> where water never could work him harm,<br> nor through the roof could reach him ever<br> fangs of the flood. Firelight he saw,<br> beams of a blaze that brightly shone.<br> Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<br> mere-wife monstrous. For mighty stroke<br> he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.<br> Then sang on her head that seemly blade<br> its war-song wild. But the warrior found<br> the light-of-battle[1] was loath to bite,<br> to harm the heart: its hard edge failed<br> the noble at need, yet had known of old<br> strife hand to hand, and had helmets cloven,<br> doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this,<br> for the gleaming blade that its glory fell.<br> Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,<br> heedful of high deeds, Hygelac's kinsman;<br> flung away fretted sword, featly jewelled,<br> the angry earl; on earth it lay<br> steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,<br> hand-gripe of might. So man shall do<br> whenever in war he weens to earn him<br> lasting fame, nor fears for his life!<br> Seized then by shoulder, shrank not from combat,<br> the Geatish war-prince Grendel's mother.<br> Flung then the fierce one, filled with wrath,<br> his deadly foe, that she fell to ground.<br> Swift on her part she paid him back<br> with grisly grasp, and grappled with him.<br> Spent with struggle, stumbled the warrior,<br> fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.<br> On the hall-guest she hurled herself, hent her short sword,<br> broad and brown-edged,[2] the bairn to avenge,<br> the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay<br> braided breast-mail, barring death,<br> withstanding entrance of edge or blade.<br> Life would have ended for Ecgtheow's son,<br> under wide earth for that earl of Geats,<br> had his armor of war not aided him,<br> battle-net hard, and holy God<br> wielded the victory, wisest Maker.<br> The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;<br> and easily rose the earl erect.

'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<br> old-sword of Eotens, with edge of proof,<br> warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,<br> -- save only 'twas more than other men<br> to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --<br> as the giants had wrought it, ready and keen.<br> Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings' chieftain,<br> bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,<br> reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote<br> that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard,<br> her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through<br> that fated-one's flesh: to floor she sank.<br> Bloody the blade: he was blithe of his deed.<br> Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within<br> as when from the sky there shines unclouded<br> heaven's candle. The hall he scanned.<br> By the wall then went he; his weapon raised<br> high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,<br> angry and eager. That edge was not useless<br> to the warrior now. He wished with speed<br> Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many,<br> for the war he waged on Western-Danes<br> oftener far than an only time,<br> when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions<br> he slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,<br> fifteen men of the folk of Danes,<br> and as many others outward bore,<br> his horrible prey. Well paid for that<br> the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw<br> Grendel stretched there, spent with war,<br> spoiled of life, so scathed had left him<br> Heorot's battle. The body sprang far<br> when after death it endured the blow,<br> sword-stroke savage, that severed its head.<br> Soon,[1] then, saw the sage companions<br> who waited with Hrothgar, watching the flood,<br> that the tossing waters turbid grew,<br> blood-stained the mere. Old men together,<br> hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<br> the warrior would not, they weened, again,<br> proud of conquest, come to seek<br> their mighty master. To many it seemed<br> the wolf-of-the-waves had won his life.<br> The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<br> left the headland; homeward went<br> the gold-friend of men.[2] But the guests sat on,<br> stared at the surges, sick in heart,<br> and wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord<br> again to see. 
Now that sword began,<br> from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,[3]<br> war-blade, to wane: 'twas a wondrous thing<br> that all of it melted as ice is wont<br> when frosty fetters the Father loosens,<br> unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all<br> seasons and times: the true God he!<br> Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats<br> save only the head and that hilt withal<br> blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<br> burned was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<br> so poisoned the hell-sprite who perished within there.<br> Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat<br> downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<br> The clashing waters were cleansed now,<br> waste of waves, where the wandering fiend<br> her life-days left and this lapsing world.<br> Swam then to strand the sailors'-refuge,<br> sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,<br> of burden brave he bore with him.<br> Went then to greet him, and God they thanked,<br> the thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,<br> that safe and sound they could see him again.<br> Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor<br> deftly they doffed: now drowsed the mere,<br> water 'neath welkin, with war-blood stained.<br> Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,<br> merry at heart the highways measured,<br> well-known roads. Courageous men<br> carried the head from the cliff by the sea,<br> an arduous task for all the band,<br> the firm in fight, since four were needed<br> on the shaft-of-slaughter[4] strenuously<br> to bear to the gold-hall Grendel's head.<br> So presently to the palace there<br> foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,<br> marching came. Their master-of-clan<br> mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.<br> Strode then within the sovran thane<br> fearless in fight, of fame renowned,<br> hardy hero, Hrothgar to greet.<br> And next by the hair into hall was borne<br> Grendel's head, where the henchmen were drinking,<br> an awe to clan and queen alike,<br> a monster of marvel: the men looked on.

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "Lo, now, this sea-booty, son of Healfdene,<br> Lord of Scyldings, we've lustily brought thee,<br> sign of glory; thou seest it here.<br> Not lightly did I with my life escape!<br> In war under water this work I essayed<br> with endless effort; and even so<br> my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me.<br> Not a whit could I with Hrunting do<br> in work of war, though the weapon is good;<br> yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me<br> to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,<br> old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides<br> the friendless wight! -- and I fought with that brand,<br> felling in fight, since fate was with me,<br> the house's wardens. That war-sword then<br> all burned, bright blade, when the blood gushed o'er it,<br> battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought back<br> from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds<br> death-fall of Danes, as was due and right.<br> And this is my hest, that in Heorot now<br> safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,<br> and every thane of all thy folk<br> both old and young; no evil fear,<br> Scyldings' lord, from that side again,<br> aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"<br> Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,<br> hoary hero, in hand was laid,<br> giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it<br> after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,<br> wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid<br> of that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,<br> murder-marked, and his mother as well.<br> Now it passed into power of the people's king,<br> best of all that the oceans bound<br> who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's isle.<br> Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,<br> heirloom old, where was etched the rise<br> of that far-off fight when the floods o'erwhelmed,<br> raging waves, the race of giants<br> (fearful their fate!), a folk estranged<br> from God Eternal: whence guerdon due<br> in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.<br> So on the guard of shining gold<br> in runic staves it was rightly said<br> for whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,<br> best of blades, in bygone days,<br> and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,<br> son of Healfdene; silent were all: --<br> "Lo, so may he say who sooth and right<br> follows 'mid folk, of far times mindful,<br> a land-warden old,[1] that this earl belongs<br> to the better breed! So, borne aloft,<br> thy fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,<br> far and wide o'er folksteads many. Firmly thou<br> shalt all maintain,<br> mighty strength with mood of wisdom. Love of<br> mine will I assure thee,<br> as, awhile ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay<br> in future,<br> in far-off years, to folk of thine,<br> to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod thus<br> to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,<br> nor grew for their grace, but for grisly slaughter,<br> for doom of death to the Danishmen. 
He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,<br> companions at board! So he passed alone,<br> chieftain haughty, from human cheer.<br> Though him the Maker with might endowed,<br> delights of power, and uplifted high<br> above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,<br> his breast-hoard, grew, no bracelets gave he<br> to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless<br> strain of struggle and stress of woe,<br> long feud with his folk. Here find thy lesson!<br> Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said for thee,<br> wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems<br> how to sons of men Almighty God<br> in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,<br> estate, high station: He swayeth all things.<br> Whiles He letteth right lustily fare<br> the heart of the hero of high-born race, --<br> in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,<br> his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,<br> puts in his power great parts of the earth,<br> empire so ample, that end of it<br> this wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.<br> So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him<br> illness or age; no evil cares<br> shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens<br> from ever an enemy: all the world<br> wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,<br> till all within him obstinate pride<br> waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers,<br> the spirit's sentry; sleep is too fast<br> which masters his might, and the murderer nears,<br> stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow! 
[1] That is, "whoever has as wide authority as I have and can remember so far back so many instances of heroism, may well say, as I say, that no better hero ever lived than Beowulf."

"UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed<br> by sharpest shafts; and no shelter avails<br> from foul behest of the hellish fiend.[1]<br> Him seems too little what long he possessed.<br> Greedy and grim, no golden rings<br> he gives for his pride; the promised future<br> forgets he and spurns, with all God has sent him,<br> Wonder-Wielder, of wealth and fame.<br> Yet in the end it ever comes<br> that the frame of the body fragile yields,<br> fated falls; and there follows another<br> who joyously the jewels divides,<br> the royal riches, nor recks of his forebear.<br> Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,<br> best of men, and the better part choose,<br> profit eternal; and temper thy pride,<br> warrior famous! The flower of thy might<br> lasts now a while: but erelong it shall be<br> that sickness or sword thy strength shall minish,<br> or fang of fire, or flooding billow,<br> or bite of blade, or brandished spear,<br> or odious age; or the eyes' clear beam<br> wax dull and darken: Death even thee<br> in haste shall o'erwhelm, thou hero of war!<br> So the Ring-Danes these half-years a hundred I ruled,<br> wielded 'neath welkin, and warded them bravely<br> from mighty-ones many o'er middle-earth,<br> from spear and sword, till it seemed for me<br> no foe could be found under fold of the sky.<br> Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure<br> came grief for joy when Grendel began<br> to harry my home, the hellish foe;<br> for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered<br> heart-sorrow heavy. Heaven be thanked,<br> Lord Eternal, for life extended<br> that I on this head all hewn and bloody,<br> after long evil, with eyes may gaze!<br> -- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,<br> warrior worthy! A wealth of treasure<br> at dawn of day, be dealt between us!"<br> Glad was the Geats' lord, going betimes<br> to seek his seat, as the Sage commanded.<br> Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,<br> for the band of the hall, was a banquet dight<br> nobly anew. The Night-Helm darkened<br> dusk o'er the drinkers.<br> The doughty ones rose:<br> for the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,<br> aged Scylding; and eager the Geat,<br> shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.<br> Him wander-weary, warrior-guest<br> from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,<br> who by custom courtly cared for all<br> needs of a thane as in those old days<br> warrior-wanderers wont to have.<br> So slumbered the stout-heart. Stately the hall<br> rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on<br> till a raven black the rapture-of-heaven[2]<br> blithe-heart boded. Bright came flying<br> shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,<br> athelings all were eager homeward<br> forth to fare; and far from thence<br> the great-hearted guest would guide his keel.<br> Bade then the hardy-one Hrunting be brought<br> to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,<br> excellent iron, and uttered his thanks for it,<br> quoth that he counted it keen in battle,<br> "war-friend" winsome: with words he slandered not<br> edge of the blade: 'twas a big-hearted man!<br> Now eager for parting and armed at point<br> warriors waited, while went to his host<br> that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling<br> to high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "Lo, we seafarers say our will,<br> far-come men, that we fain would seek<br> Hygelac now. We here have found<br> hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.<br> If ever on earth I am able to win me<br> more of thy love, O lord of men,<br> aught anew, than I now have done,<br> for work of war I am willing still!<br> If it come to me ever across the seas<br> that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --<br> as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --<br> thousands then of thanes I shall bring,<br> heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,<br> ward of his folk, that, though few his years,<br> the lord of the Geats will give me aid<br> by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,<br> wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph<br> and lending thee might when thou lackest men.<br> If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,<br> a sovran's son, he will surely there<br> find his friends. A far-off land<br> each man should visit who vaunts him brave."<br> Him then answering, Hrothgar spake: --<br> "These words of thine the wisest God<br> sent to thy soul! No sager counsel<br> from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.<br> Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,<br> art wise in words! I ween indeed<br> if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir<br> by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,<br> by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,<br> people's leader, -- and life be thine, --<br> no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find<br> at all to choose for their chief and king,<br> for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt<br> thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me<br> the longer the better, Beowulf loved! 
Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,<br> sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,<br> shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,<br> such as once they waged, from war refrain.<br> Long as I rule this realm so wide,<br> let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold<br> each other greet o'er the gannet's-bath,<br> and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling waves<br> tokens of love. I trow my landfolk<br> towards friend and foe are firmly joined,<br> and honor they keep in the olden way."<br> To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son<br> gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls<br> bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,<br> hale to his home, and in haste return.<br> Then kissed the king of kin renowned,<br> Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,<br> and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears<br> of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,<br> he had chances twain, but he clung to this,[1] --<br> that each should look on the other again,<br> and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.<br> his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;<br> safe in his soul a secret longing,<br> locked in his mind, for that loved man<br> burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,<br> glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o'er,<br> warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode<br> riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.<br> As they hastened onward, Hrothgar's gift<br> they lauded at length. -- 'Twas a lord unpeered,<br> every way blameless, till age had broken<br> -- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might. 
[1] That is, he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he was, the latter chance was likely; but he clung to the former, hoping to see his young friend again "and exchange brave words in the hall." 
<b>XXVII</b> 
CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous<br> hardy henchmen, their harness bearing,<br> woven war-sarks. The warden marked,<br> trusty as ever, the earl's return.<br> From the height of the hill no hostile words<br> reached the guests as he rode to greet them;<br> but "Welcome!" he called to that Weder clan<br> as the sheen-mailed spoilers to ship marched on.<br> Then on the strand, with steeds and treasure<br> and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship<br> was heavily laden: high its mast<br> rose over Hrothgar's hoarded gems.<br> A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,<br> mounted with gold; on the mead-bench since<br> he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,<br> heirloom old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,<br> they drove through the deep, and Daneland left.<br> A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,<br> firm to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned;[1]<br> nor did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow<br> across from her course. The craft sped on,<br> foam-necked it floated forth o'er the waves,<br> keel firm-bound over briny currents,<br> till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs,<br> home-known headlands. High the boat,<br> stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.<br> Helpful at haven the harbor-guard stood,<br> who long already for loved companions<br> by the water had waited and watched afar.<br> He bound to the beach the broad-bosomed ship<br> with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows<br> that trusty timber should tear away.<br> Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure,<br> gold and jewels; no journey far<br> was it thence to go to the giver of rings,<br> Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt<br> by the sea-wall close, himself and clan.<br> Haughty that house, a hero the king,<br> high the hall, and Hygd[2] right young,<br> wise and wary, though winters few<br> in those fortress walls she had found a home,<br> Haereth's daughter. Nor humble her ways,<br> nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,<br> of precious treasure. Not Thryth's pride showed she,<br> folk-queen famed, or that fell deceit.<br> Was none so daring that durst make bold<br> (save her lord alone) of the liegemen dear<br> that lady full in the face to look,<br> but forged fetters he found his lot,<br> bonds of death! And brief the respite;<br> soon as they seized him, his sword-doom was spoken,<br> and the burnished blade a baleful murder<br> proclaimed and closed. No queenly way<br> for woman to practise, though peerless she,<br> that the weaver-of-peace[3] from warrior dear<br> by wrath and lying his life should reave!<br> But Hemming's kinsman hindered this. --<br> For over their ale men also told<br> that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,<br> onslaughts of evil, after she went,<br> gold-decked bride, to the brave young prince,<br> atheling haughty, and Offa's hall<br> o'er the fallow flood at her father's bidding<br> safely sought, where since she prospered,<br> royal, throned, rich in goods,<br> fain of the fair life fate had sent her,<br> and leal in love to the lord of warriors.<br> He, of all heroes I heard of ever<br> from sea to sea, of the sons of earth,<br> most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised<br> for his fighting and feeing by far-off men,<br> the spear-bold warrior; wisely he ruled<br> over his empire. Eomer woke to him,<br> help of heroes, Hemming's kinsman,<br> Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.

HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,<br> sandy strand of the sea to tread<br> and widespread ways. The world's great candle,<br> sun shone from south. They strode along<br> with sturdy steps to the spot they knew<br> where the battle-king young, his burg within,<br> slayer of Ongentheow, shared the rings,<br> shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac<br> Beowulf's coming was quickly told, --<br> that there in the court the clansmen's refuge,<br> the shield-companion sound and alive,<br> hale from the hero-play homeward strode.<br> With haste in the hall, by highest order,<br> room for the rovers was readily made.<br> By his sovran he sat, come safe from battle,<br> kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord<br> he first had greeted in gracious form,<br> with manly words. The mead dispensing,<br> came through the high hall Haereth's daughter,<br> winsome to warriors, wine-cup bore<br> to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then<br> his comrade fairly with question plied<br> in the lofty hall, sore longing to know<br> what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.<br> "What came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,<br> when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder<br> battle to seek o'er the briny sea,<br> combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou<br> aid at all, the honored chief,<br> in his wide-known woes? With waves of care<br> my sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted<br> my loved one's venture: long I begged thee<br> by no means to seek that slaughtering monster,<br> but suffer the South-Danes to settle their feud<br> themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked<br> that safe and sound I can see thee now!"<br> Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "'Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,<br> to many men, that meeting of ours,<br> struggle grim between Grendel and me,<br> which we fought on the field where full too many<br> sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,<br> evils unending. These all I avenged.<br> No boast can be from breed of Grendel,<br> any on earth, for that uproar at dawn,<br> from the longest-lived of the loathsome race<br> in fleshly fold! -- But first I went<br> Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts,<br> where Healfdene's kinsman high-renowned,<br> soon as my purpose was plain to him,<br> assigned me a seat by his son and heir.<br> The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never<br> such merry men over mead in hall<br> have I heard under heaven! The high-born queen,<br> people's peace-bringer, passed through the hall,<br> cheered the young clansmen, clasps of gold,<br> ere she sought her seat, to sundry gave.<br> Oft to the heroes Hrothgar's daughter,<br> to earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, --<br> she whom I heard these hall-companions<br> Freawaru name, when fretted gold<br> she proffered the warriors. Promised is she,<br> gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda.<br> Sage this seems to the Scylding's-friend,<br> kingdom's-keeper: he counts it wise<br> the woman to wed so and ward off feud,<br> store of slaughter. But seldom ever<br> when men are slain, does the murder-spear sink<br> but briefest while, though the bride be fair![1]<br> "Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,<br> and as little each of his liegemen all,<br> when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,<br> goes with the lady along their hall,<br> and on him the old-time heirlooms glisten<br> hard and ring-decked, Heathobard's treasure,<br> weapons that once they wielded fair<br> until they lost at the linden-play[2]<br> liegeman leal and their lives as well.<br> Then, over the ale, on this heirloom gazing,<br> some ash-wielder old who has all in mind<br> that spear-death of men,[3] -- he is stern of mood,<br> heavy at heart, -- in the hero young<br> tests the temper and tries the soul<br> and war-hate wakens, with words like these: --<br> Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword<br> which to the fray thy father carried<br> in his final feud, 'neath the fighting-mask,<br> dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him<br> and wielded the war-place on Withergild's fall,<br> after havoc of heroes, those hardy Scyldings?<br> Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,<br> proud of his treasure, paces this hall,<br> joys in the killing, and carries the jewel[4]<br> that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!_<br> Thus he urges and eggs him all the time<br> with keenest words, till occasion offers<br> that Freawaru's thane, for his father's deed,<br> after bite of brand in his blood must slumber,<br> losing his life; but that liegeman flies<br> living away, for the land he kens.<br> And thus be broken on both their sides<br> oaths of the earls, when Ingeld's breast<br> wells with war-hate, and wife-love now<br> after the care-billows cooler grows.<br> "So[5] I hold not high the Heathobards' faith<br> due to the Danes, or their during love<br> and pact of peace. -- But I pass from that,<br> turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,<br> and saying in full how the fight resulted,<br> hand-fray of heroes. When heaven's jewel<br> had fled o'er far fields, that fierce sprite came,<br> night-foe savage, to seek us out<br> where safe and sound we sentried the hall.<br> To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,<br> his fall there was fated. He first was slain,<br> girded warrior. Grendel on him<br> turned murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,<br> and all of the brave man's body devoured.<br> Yet none the earlier, empty-handed,<br> would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,<br> outward go from the gold-decked hall:<br> but me he attacked in his terror of might,<br> with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by him[6]<br> wide and wondrous, wound with bands;<br> and in artful wise it all was wrought,<br> by devilish craft, of dragon-skins.<br> Me therein, an innocent man,<br> the fiendish foe was fain to thrust<br> with many another. He might not so,<br> when I all angrily upright stood.<br> 'Twere long to relate how that land-destroyer<br> I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;<br> yet there, my prince, this people of thine<br> got fame by my fighting. He fled away,<br> and a little space his life preserved;<br> but there staid behind him his stronger hand<br> left in Heorot; heartsick thence<br> on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.<br> Me for this struggle the Scyldings'-friend<br> paid in plenty with plates of gold,<br> with many a treasure, when morn had come<br> and we all at the banquet-board sat down.<br> Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,<br> much tested, told of the times of yore.<br> Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,<br> wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted<br> of sooth and sadness, or said aright<br> legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;<br> or for years of his youth he would yearn at times,<br> for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,<br> hoary hero: his heart surged full<br> when, wise with winters, he wailed their flight.<br> Thus in the hall the whole of that day<br> at ease we feasted, till fell o'er earth<br> another night. Anon full ready<br> in greed of vengeance, Grendel's mother<br> set forth all doleful. Dead was her son<br> through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous<br> with fury fell a foeman she slew,<br> avenged her offspring. From Aeschere old,<br> loyal councillor, life was gone;<br> nor might they e'en, when morning broke,<br> those Danish people, their death-done comrade<br> burn with brands, on balefire lay<br> the man they mourned. Under mountain stream<br> she had carried the corpse with cruel hands.<br> For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow<br> of all that had laden the lord of his folk.<br> The leader then, by thy life, besought me<br> (sad was his soul) in the sea-waves' coil<br> to play the hero and hazard my being<br> for glory of prowess: my guerdon he pledged.<br> I then in the waters -- 'tis widely known --<br> that sea-floor-guardian savage found.<br> Hand-to-hand there a while we struggled;<br> billows welled blood; in the briny hall<br> her head I hewed with a hardy blade<br> from Grendel's mother, -- and gained my life,<br> though not without danger. My doom was not yet.<br> Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene's son,<br> gave me in guerdon great gifts of price. 
Note: [1] Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his journey, but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain policies at the Danish court. Talk of interpolation here is absurd. As both Beowulf and Hygelac know, -- and the folk for whom the Beowulf was put together also knew, -- Froda was king of the Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once near neighbors of Angle and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen in fight with the Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as "peace-weaver" and wife to the young king Ingeld, son of the slain Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation of the particular case, foretells trouble. 
Note: [2] Play of shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight, and takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son. This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the young princess Freawaru, to her new home when she is Ingeld's queen. Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out to Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land, escapes. So the old feud must break out again. 
[3] That is, their disastrous battle and the slaying of their king. 
[4] The sword. 
[5] Beowulf returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat as follows, he says; sketches a little tragic story; and with this prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure. 
[6] Not an actual glove, but a sort of bag.
