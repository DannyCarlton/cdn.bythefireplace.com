Betty Madison had exercised a great deal of self-control in resisting  the natural impulse to cultivate a fad and grapple with a problem.  Only her keen sense of humour saved her. On the Sunday following her  return, while sauntering home after a long restless tramp about the  city, she passed a church which many coloured people were entering.  Her newly awakened curiosity in all things pertaining to the political  life of her country prompted her to follow them and sit through the  service. The clergyman was light in colour, and prayed and preached in  simpler and better English than she had heard in more pretentious  pulpits, but there was nothing noteworthy, in his remarks beyond a  supplication to the Almighty to deliver the negro from the oppression  of the "Southern tyrant," followed by an admonition to the negro to  improve himself in mind and character if he would hope to compete with  the Whites; bitter words and violence but weakened his cause.    
This was sound commonsense, but the reverse of the sensational  entertainment Betty had half expected, and her eyes wandered from the  preacher to his congregation. There were all shades of Afro-American  colour and all degrees of prosperity represented. Coal-black women  were there, attired in deep and expensive mourning. "Yellow girls"  wore smart little tailor costumes. Three young girls, evidently of the  lower middle class of coloured society, for they were cheaply dressed,  had all the little airs and graces and mannerisms of the typical  American girl. In one corner a sleek mulatto with a Semitic profile  sat in the recognized attitude of the banker in church; filling his  corner comfortably and setting a worthy example to the less favoured  of Mammon.    
But Betty's attention suddenly was arrested and held by two men who  sat on the opposite side of the aisle, although not together, and  apparently were unrelated. There were no others quite like them in the  church, but the conviction slowly forced itself into her mind,  magnetic for new impressions, that there were many elsewhere. They  were men who were descending the fifties, tall, with straight gray  hair. One was very slender, and all but distinguished of carriage; the  other was heavier, and would have been imposing but for the listless  droop of his shoulders. The features of both were finely cut, and  their complexions far removed from the reproach of "yellow." They  looked like sun-burned gentlemen.    
For nearly ten minutes Betty stared, fascinated, while her mind  grappled with the deep significance of all those two sad and patient  men expressed. They inherited the shell and the intellect, the  aspirations and the possibilities of the gay young planters whose  tragic folly had called into being a race of outcasts with all their  own capacity for shame and suffering.    
Betty went home and for twenty-four hours fought with the desire to  champion the cause of the negro and make him her life-work. But not  only did she abominate women with missions; she looked at the subject  upon each of its many sides and asked a number of indirect questions  of her cousin, Jack Emory. Sincere reflection brought with it the  conclusion that her energies in behalf of the negro would be  superfluous. The careless planters were dead; she could not harangue  their dust. The Southerners of the present generation despised and  feared the coloured race in its enfranchised state too actively to  have more to do with it than they could help; if it was a legal  offence for Whites and Blacks to marry, there was an equally stringent  social law which protected the coloured girl from the lust of the  white man. Therefore, as she could not undo the harm already done, and  as a crusade in behalf of the next generation would be meaningless,  not to say indelicate, she dismissed the "problem" from her mind. But  the image of those two sad and stately reflections of the old school  sank indelibly into her memory, and rose to their part in one of the  most momentous decisions of her life.
