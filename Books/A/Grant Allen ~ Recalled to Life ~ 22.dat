At last my chance came," Jack went on. "I'd found out almost  everything; not, of course, exactly by way of legal proof, but to my  own entire satisfaction: and I determined to lay the matter  definitely at once before Mr. Callingham. So I took a holiday for a  fortnight, to go bicycling in the Midlands I told my patients; and I  fixed my head-quarters at Wrode, which, as you probably remember, is  twenty miles off from Woodbury.    
"It was important for my scheme I should catch Mr. Callingham alone.  I had no idea of entrapping him. I wanted to work upon his  conscience and induce him to confess. My object was rather to move  him to remorse and restitution than to terrify or surprise him.    
"So on the day of the accident--call it murder, if you will--I rode  over on my machine, unannounced, to The Grange to see him. You knew  where I was staying, you recollect--"    
At the words, a burst of memory came suddenly over me.    
"Oh yes!" I cried. "I remember. It was at the Wilsons', at Wrode. I  wrote over there to tell you we were going to dine alone at six that  evening, as papa had got his electric apparatus home from his  instrument-maker, and was anxious to try his experiments early.  You'd written to me privately--a boy brought the note--that you  wanted to have an hour's talk alone with papa. I thought it was  about <i>me</i>, and I was, oh, ever so nervous!"    
For it all came back to me now, as clear as yesterday.    
Jack looked at me hard.    
"I'm glad you remember that, dear," he said. "Now, Una, do try to  remember all you can as I go along with my story... Well, I rode  over alone, never telling anybody at Wrode where I was going, nor  giving your step-father any reason of any sort to expect me. I  trusted entirely to finding him busy with his new invention. When I  reached The Grange, I came up the drive unperceived, and looking in  at the library window, saw your father alone there. He was pottering  over his chemicals. That gave me the clue. I left my bicycle under  the window, tilted up against the wall, and walked in without  ringing, going straight to the library. Nobody saw me come: nobody  saw me return, except one old lady on the road, who seemed to have  forgotten all about it by the time of the inquest."    
(I nodded and gave a start. I knew that must have been Aunt Emma.)    
"Except yourself, Una, no human soul on earth ever seemed to suspect  me. And that wasn't odd; for you and your father, and perhaps Minnie  Moore, were the only people in the world who ever knew I was in love  with you or cared for you in any way."    
"Go on," I said, breathless. "And you went into the library."    
"I went into the library," Jack continued, "where I found your  father, just returned from enjoying his cigar on the lawn. He was  alone in the room--"    
"No, no!" I cried eagerly, putting in my share now; for I had a part  in the history. "He <i>wasn't</i> alone, Jack, though you thought him so at  the time. I remember all, at last. It comes back to me like a flash.  Oh, heavens, how it comes back to me! Jack, Jack, I remember to-day  every word, every syllable of it!"    
He gazed at me in surprise.    
"Then tell me yourself, Una!" he exclaimed. "How did you come to be  there? For I knew you were there at last; but till you fired the  pistol, I hadn't the faintest idea you had heard or seen anything.  Tell me all about it, quick! There comes in <i>my</i> mystery."    
In one wild rush of thought the whole picture rose up like a vision  before me.    
"Why, Jack," I cried, "there was a screen, a little screen in the  alcove! You remember the alcove at the west end of the room. It was  so small a screen, you'd hardly have thought it could hide me; but  it did--it did--and all, too, by accident. I'd gone in there after  dinner, not much thinking where I went, and was seated on the floor  by the little alcove window, reading a book by the twilight. It was  a book papa told me I wasn't to read, and I took it trembling from  the shelves, and was afraid he'd scold me--for you know how stern he  was. And I never was allowed to go alone into the library. But I got  interested in my book, and went on reading. So when he came in, I  went on sitting there very still, with the book hidden under my  skirt, for fear he should scold me. I thought perhaps before long  papa'd go out for a second, to get some plates for his photography  or something, and then I could slip away and never be noticed. The  big window towards the garden was open, you remember, and I meant to  jump out of it--as you did afterwards. It wasn't very high; and  though the book was only The Vicar of Wakefield, he'd forbidden me  to read it, and I was dreadfully afraid of him."    
"Then you were there all the time?" Jack cried interrogatively. "And  you heard our conversation--our whole conversation?"    
"I was there all the time, Jack," I cried, in a fever of exaltation:  "and I heard every word of it! It comes back to me now with a  vividness like yesterday. I see the room before my eyes. I remember  every syllable: I could repeat every sentence of it."    
Jack drew a deep sigh of intense relief.    
"Thank God for that!" he exclaimed, with profound gratitude. "Then  I'm saved, and you're saved. We can both understand one another in  that case. We know how it all happened!"    
"Perfectly," I answered. "I know all now. As I sat there and  cowered, I heard a knock at the door, and before papa could answer,  you entered hastily. Papa looked round, I could hear, and saw who it  was in a second.    
"'Oh, it's you!' he said, coldly. 'It's you, Dr. Ivor. And pray,  sir, what do you want here this evening?'"    
"Go on!" Jack cried, intensely relieved, I could feel. "Let me see  how much more you can remember, Una."    
"So you shut the door softly and said:    
"'Yes, it's I, Mr. Callingham,'" I continued all aglow, and looking  into his eyes for confirmation. "'And I've come to tell you a fact  that may surprise you. Prepare for strange news. Richard Wharton has  returned to England!'    
"I knew Richard Wharton was mamma's first husband, who was dead  before I was born, as I'd always been told: and I sat there aghast  at the news: it was so sudden, so crushing. I'd heard he'd been  wrecked, and I thought he'd come to life again; but as yet I didn't  suspect what was all the real meaning of it.    
"But papa drew back, I could hear, in a perfect frenzy of rage,  astonishment, and terror.    
"'Richard Wharton!' he hissed out between his teeth, springing away  like one stung. 'Richard Wharton come back! You liar! You sneak!  He's dead this twenty years! You're trying to frighten me.'    
"I never meant to overhear your conversation. But at that, it was so  strange, I drew back and cowered even closer. I was afraid of papa's  voice. I was afraid of his rage. He spoke just like a man who was  ready to murder you.    
"Then you began to talk with papa about strange things that  astonished me--strange things that I only half understood just then,  but that by the light of what you've told me to-day I quite  understand now--the history of my real father.    
"'I'm no liar,' you answered. 'Richard Wharton has come back. And by  the aid of what he's disclosed, I know the whole truth. The girl you  call your daughter, and whose money you've stolen, is not yours at  all. She's Richard Wharton's daughter Mary!'    
"Papa staggered back a pace or two, and came quite close to the  screen. I cowered behind it in alarm. I could see he was terrified.  For a minute or two you talked with him, and urged him to confess.  Bit by bit, as you went on, he recovered his nerve, and began to  bluster. He didn't deny what you said: he saw it was no use: he just  sneered and prevaricated.    
"As I listened to his words, I saw he admitted it all. A great  horror came over me. Then my life was one long lie! He was never my  father. He had concocted a vile plot. He had held me in this slavery  so many years to suit his own purposes. He had crushed my mother to  death, and robbed me of my birthright. Even before that night, I  never loved him. I thought it very wicked of me, but I never could  love him. As he spoke to you and grew cynical, I began to loathe and  despise him. I can't tell you how great a comfort it was to me to  know--to hear from his own lips I was not that man's daughter.    
"At last, after many recriminations, he looked across at you, and  said, half laughing, for he was quite himself again by that time:    
"'This is all very fine, Courtenay Ivor--all very fine in its way;  but how are you going to prove it? that's the real question. Do you  think any jury in England will believe, on your unsupported oath,  such a cock-and-bull story? Do you think, even if Richard Wharton's  come back, and you've got him on your side, I can't cross-examine  all the life out of his body?'    
"At that you said gravely--wanting to touch his conscience, I  suppose:--    
"'Richard Wharton's come back, but you can't cross-examine him. For  Richard Wharton died some six or eight weeks since at my cottage at  Babbicombe, after revealing to me all this vile plot against himself  and his daughter.'    
"Then papa drew back with a loud laugh--a hateful laugh like a  demon's. I can't help calling him papa still, though it pains me  even to think of him. That loud laugh rings still in my ears to this  day. It was horrible, diabolical, like a wild beast's in triumph.    
"'You fool!' he said, with a sneer. 'And you come here to tell me  that! You infernal idiot! You come here to put yourself in my power  like this! Courtenay Ivor, I always knew you were an ass, but I  didn't ever know you were quite such a born idiot of a fellow as  that. Hold back there, you image!' With a rapid dart, before you  could see what he was doing, he passed a wire round your body and  thrust two knobs into your hands. 'You're in my power now!' he  exclaimed. 'You can't move or stir!'    
"I saw at once what he'd done. He'd pinned you to the spot with the  handles of his powerful electric apparatus. It was so strong that it  would hold one riveted to the spot in pain. You couldn't let go. You  could hardly even speak or cry aloud for help. He had pinned you  down irresistibly. I thought he meant to murder you.    
"Yet I was too terrified, even so, to scream aloud for the servants.  I only crouched there, rooted, and wondered what next would happen.    
"He went across to the door and turned the key in it. Then he opened  the cabinet and took out some things there. It was growing quite  dusk, and I could hardly see them. He returned with them where you  stood, struggling in vain to set yourself free. His voice was as  hard as adamant now. He spoke slowly and distinctly, in a voice like  a fiend's. Oh, Jack, no wonder that scene took away my reason!"    
"And you can remember what he said next, Una?" Jack asked, following  me eagerly.    
"Yes, I can remember what he said next," I went on. "He stood over  you threateningly. I could see then the thing he held in his right  hand was a loaded revolver. In his left was a bottle, a small  medical phial.    
"'If you stir, I'll shoot you,' he said; 'I'll shoot you like a dog!  You fool, you've sealed your own fate! What an idiot to let me know  Richard Wharton's dead! Now, hear your fate! Nobody saw you come  into this house to-night. Nobody shall see you leave. Look here,  sir, at this bottle. It's chloroform: do you understand?  Chloroform--chloroform--chloroform! I shall hold it to your  nose--so. I shall stifle you quietly--no blood, no fuss, no nasty  mess of any sort. And when I'm done,--do you see these flasks?--I  can reduce your damned carcase to a pound of ashes with chemicals in  half-an-hour! You've found out too much. But you've mistaken your  man! Courtenay Ivor, say your prayers and commend your soul to the  devil! You've driven me to bay, and I give you no quarter!'"
