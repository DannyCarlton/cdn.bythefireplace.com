Alexina, although she would have found it impossible, even if she had  so desired, to relapse into the incognitance of the years preceding her  mother's death, had nevertheless locked and sealed and cellared her ivory  tower, those depths of her nature where, she suspected, her true ego dwelt.  It was an ego she had forfeited the right to indulge, nor had she at this  time any desire to know more of herself than she did. Life after all was  very pleasant; she managed to fill it with many little and even a  few absorbing interests; and once she spent a month at Santa Barbara  chaperoning Janet Maynard, where her duties sat lightly upon her and she  would have responded naturally if addressed as Miss Groome, so completely  did Mortimer fade into the background. In the summer of nineteen-thirteen  Judge Lawton and Aileen overcame all protests and took her with them to  Europe, where, after a month in Paris, she visited Olive de Morsigny in her  renaissance chateau on the Loire. The memory of Gathbroke revisited her  and she half-wished the Judge would go to England, but the climate did not  agree with him, and after a few more enchanted weeks, in Italy and Spain,  she returned to Mortimer, who was distinctly duller than ever.    
But she had reconciled herself long since to the dullness of her  life-partner; he could not help it and she had willfully married him in the  face of as imposing a phalanx of family and friendly opposition as ever  attempted to stand between a girl and her fate.    
Nevertheless, immediately after her return from Santa Barbara in the late  autumn of nineteen-eleven, and wholly without, analysis or pondering, she  made a significant change in the order of her life. Mortimer, who had,  during her absence, occupied a large room at the back of the house visited  by the afternoon sun, found himself invited to retain it....They must avoid  the least possibility of a family until they were better off....She had  been hearing the subject discussed...the most economical baby cost fifty  dollars a month. With a permanent trained nurse, and of course they would  have one, the cost would easily be doubled...thousands were required for  the proper education of a child...even if she had girls she should wish  them to go to college; she was not half educated herself...and boys, with  their extravagances, their debts, they cost a mint; it was better for  children to be born outright in the humbler classes than to be born into a  rich set without riches themselves...it all put her in a panic every time  she thought of it....Morty was so sensible and had such a high sense of  responsibility, of course he understood...children, even when small, would  hamper him fearfully, especially as he had not even begun to make his  million....As for herself she would be more economical than ever and help  him like the good pal she was.    
Mortimer had the sensation of being trussed up with invisible but  inflexible silken thongs. His thoughts need not be recorded.

Alexina refurnished her bedroom in her favorite periwinkle blue; a low  graceful day-bed with a screen before the stationary washstand helped to  create the atmosphere of a boudoir. It had an intensely personal atmosphere  in which man, more particularly a lawful husband, had no place.    
When Alexina stood on the threshold and surveyed this room, chaste, cool,  proud, and exquisitely lovely, she lifted her hand and blew off a kiss, out  of the window, wafting away the memory of the room as it had been. She  had remarkable powers of obliteration, a sort of River of Lethe among the  backwaters of her mind, where she held below the surface all she wished to  forget until it ceased to struggle. She never again gave a thought to  her early relationship with her husband; not even to the indifference  or distaste which had followed so quickly upon her curiosity and her  determination to feel romantic at all costs.

Subtly she felt she was happier than she had ever been even in those first  weeks, when she had barred the gates of her fool's paradise behind her; she  felt as free and happy as the birds skimming over the beds of periwinkle  below her window, and (miraculously finding her second youth quite as  productive as her first) took no pains to conceive of anything better. She  looked neither forward nor back, and all was well.    
She even flirted a little, that being the fashion, and, having had enough  of business men, encouraged the devotions of Bascom Luning and Jimmie  Thorne. She saw them when they chose to call in the daytime, and regaled  the glowering Mortimer at the dinner table with scraps of their sapience.    
Mortimer had resigned himself long since to the sacrifice of several of his  bourgeois ambitions, among them to be master in his own house; but not an  iota of his convictions. Although it would not have occurred to him to  distrust his wife if she had chosen to sit up all night with a man, he made  frozen comments upon the impropriety of a woman having men in the house  when her husband was not there, sitting out dances with men, taking long  tramps through Marin County with three men and no one for chaperon but  Alice Thorndyke and Janet Maynard--shocking flirts--whole Sundays--with  lunch heaven knew where, and himself, who hated tramping, not included.    
But these grim remonstrances were met in so gay a spirit of badinage that  he felt ridiculous, particularly as no powers of badinage or of repartee  had been included in his own mental equipment; and he usually relapsed into  a polite and bored silence.    
He never had had much to say at the dinner table when they were alone, and,  as time went on, his comments on the day were exhausted before the soup had  given place to the entree, and Alexina fell into the habit of bringing her  Italian text-book to the table--the study of Italian just then being the  rage in her set--and whatever interesting book she had on hand. Mortimer  made no protest. His brain was fagged at night. It was a relief not to  be expected to talk when they dined alone; those long silences had been  oppresive even to him; he rather welcomed the books.
