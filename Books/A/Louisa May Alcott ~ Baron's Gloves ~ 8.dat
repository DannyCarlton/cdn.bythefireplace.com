"Uncle, can I speak to you a moment?" said Helen, very gravely, as  they left the breakfast-room next morning.    
"Not now, my dear, I'm busy," was the hasty reply, as the major  shawled Mrs. Cumberland for an early promenade.    
Helen knit her brows irefully, for this answer had been given her half  a dozen times lately when she asked for an interview. It was evident  he wished to avoid all lectures, remonstrances, and explanations; and  it was also evident that he was in love with the widow.    
"Lovers are worse than lunatics to manage, so it is vain to try to get  any help from him," sighed Helen, adding, as her uncle was gallantly  leading his stout divinity away into the garden: "Amy has a bad  headache, and I shall stay to take care of her, so we can't join  your party to Chillon, sir. We have been there once, so you needn't  postpone it for us."    
"Very well, my dear," and the major walked away, looking much  relieved.    
As Helen was about to leave the <i>salon</i> Casimer appeared. A single  glance at her face assured him that she knew all, and instantly  assuming a confiding, persuasive air that was irresistible, he said,  meekly,--    
"Mademoiselle, I do not deserve a word from you, but it desolates me  to know that I have grieved the little angel who is too dear to me.  For her sake, pardon that I spoke my heart in spite of prudence, and  permit me to send her this."    
Helen glanced from the flowers he held to his beseeching face, and her  own softened. He looked so penitent and anxious, she had not the heart  to reproach him.    
"I will forgive you and carry your gift to Amy on one condition," she  said, gravely.    
"Ah, you are kind! Name, then, the condition. I implore you, and I  will agree."    
"Tell me, then, on your honor as a gentleman, are you not Baron  Palsdorf?"    
"On my honor as a gentleman, I swear to you I am not."    
"Are you, in truth, what you profess to be?"    
"I am, in truth, Amy's lover, your devoted servant, and a most unhappy  man, with but a little while to live. Believe this and pity me,  dearest Mademoiselle Helene."    
She did pity him, her eyes betrayed that, and her voice was very kind,  as she said,--    
"Pardon my doubts. I trust you now, and wish with all my heart that  it was possible to make you happy. You know it is not, therefore I am  sure you will be wise and generous, and spare Amy further grief by  avoiding her for the little time we stay. Promise me this, Casimer."    
"I may see her if I am dumb? Do not deny me this. I will not speak,  but I must look at my little and dear angel when she is near."    
He pleaded so ardently with lips and hands, and eager eyes, that Helen  could not deny him, and when he had poured out his thanks she left  him, feeling very tender toward the unhappy young lover, whose passion  was so hopeless, yet so warm.    
Amy was at breakfast in her room, sobbing and sipping, moaning and  munching, for, though her grief was great, her appetite was good, and  she was in no mood to see anything comical in cracking eggshells  while she bewailed her broken heart, or in eating honey in the act of  lamenting the bitterness of her fate.    
Casimer would have become desperate had he seen her in the little blue  wrapper, with her bright hair loose on her shoulders, and her  pretty face wet with tears, as she dropped her spoon to seize his  flowers,--three dewy roses, one a bud, one half and the other fully  blown, making a fragrant record and avowal of the love which she must  renounce.    
"Oh, my dear boy! how can I give him up, when he is so fond, and I am  all he has? Helen, uncle must let me write or go to mamma. She shall  decide; I can't; and no one else has a right to part us," sobbed Amy,  over her roses.    
"Casimer will not marry, dear; he is too generous to ask such a  sacrifice," began Helen, but Amy cried indignantly,--    
"It is no sacrifice; I'm rich. What do I care for his poverty?"    
"His religion!" hinted Helen, anxiously.    
"It need not part us; we can believe what we will. He is good; why  mind whether he is Catholic or Protestant?"    
"But a Pole, Amy, so different in tastes, habits, character, and  beliefs. It is a great risk to marry a foreigner; races are so  unlike."    
"I don't care if he is a Tartar, a Calmuck, or any of the other wild  tribes; I love him, he loves me, and no one need object if I don't."    
"But, dear, the great and sad objection still remains--his health. He  just said he had but a little while to live."    
Amy's angry eyes grew dim, but she answered, with soft earnestness,--    
"So much the more need of me to make that little while happy. Think  how much he has suffered and done for others; surely I may do  something for him. Oh, Nell, can I let him die alone and in exile,  when I have both heart and home to give him?"    
Helen could say no more; she kissed and comforted the faithful little  soul, feeling all the while such sympathy and tenderness that she  wondered at herself, for with this interest in the love of another  came a sad sense of loneliness, as if she was denied the sweet  experience that every woman longs to know.    
Amy never could remain long under a cloud, and seeing Helen's tears,  began to cheer both her cousin and herself.    
"Hoffman said he might live with care, don't you remember? and Hoffman  knows the case better than we. Let us ask him if Casimer is worse. You  do it; I can't without betraying myself."    
"I will," and Helen felt grateful for any pretext to address a  friendly word to Karl, who had looked sad of late, and had been less  with them since the major became absorbed in Mrs. Cumberland.    
Leaving Amy to compose herself, Helen went away to find Hoffman. It  was never difficult, for he seemed to divine her wishes and appear  uncalled the moment he was wanted. Hardly had she reached her favorite  nook in the garden when he approached with letters, and asked with  respectful anxiety, as she glanced at and threw them by with an  impatient sigh,--    
"Has mademoiselle any orders? Will the ladies drive, sail, or make a  little expedition? It is fine, and mademoiselle looks as if the air  would refresh her. Pardon that I make the suggestion."    
"No, Hoffman, I don't like the air of this place, and intend to leave  as soon as possible." And Helen knit her delicate dark brows with  an expression of great determination. "Switzerland is the refuge of  political exiles, and I hate plots and disguises; I feel oppressed by  some mystery, and mean to solve or break away from it at once."    
She stopped abruptly, longing to ask his help, yet withheld by a  sudden sense of shyness in approaching the subject, though she had  decided to speak to Karl of the Pole.    
"Can I serve you, mademoiselle? If so, pray command me," he said,  eagerly, coming a step nearer.    
"You can, and I intend to ask your advice, for there can be nothing  amiss in doing so, since you are a friend of Casimer's."    
"I am both friend and confidant, mademoiselle," he answered, as  if anxious to let her understand that he knew all, without the  embarrassment of words. She looked up quickly, relieved, yet troubled.    
"He has told you, then?"    
"Everything, mademoiselle. Pardon me if this afflicts you; I am his  only friend here, and the poor lad sorely needed comfort."    
"He did. I am not annoyed; I am glad, for I know you will sustain him.  Now I may speak freely, and be equally frank. Please tell me if he is  indeed fatally ill?"    
"It was thought so some months ago; now I hope. Happiness cures many  ills, and since he has loved, he has improved. I always thought care  would save him; he is worth it."    
Hoffman paused, as if fearful of venturing too far; but Helen seemed  to confide freely in him, and said, softly,--    
"Ah, if it were only wise to let him be happy. It is so bitter to deny  love."    
"God knows it is!"    
The exclamation broke from Hoffman as if an irrepressible impulse  wrung it from him.    
Helen started, and for a moment neither spoke. She collected herself  soonest, and without turning, said, quietly,--    
"I have been troubled by a strong impression that Casimer is not what  he seems. Till he denied it on his honor I believed him to be Baron  Palsdorf. Did he speak the truth when he said he was not?"    
"Yes, mademoiselle."    
"Then, Casimer Teblinski is his real name?"    
No answer.    
She turned sharply, and added,--    
"For my cousin's sake, I must know the truth. Several curious  coincidences make me strongly suspect that he is passing under an  assumed name."    
Not a word said Hoffman, but looked on the ground, as motionless and  expressionless as a statue.    
Helen lost patience, and in order to show how much she had discovered,  rapidly told the story of the gloves, ring, handkerchief, prayer-book  and collar, omitting all hint of the girlish romance they had woven  about these things.    
As she ended, Hoffman looked up with a curious expression, in which  confusion, amusement, admiration and annoyance seemed to contend.    
"Mademoiselle," he said, gravely, "I am about to prove to you that  I feel honored by the confidence you place in me. I cannot break my  word, but I will confess to you that Casimer does <i>not</i> bear his own  name."    
"I knew it!" said Helen, with a flash of triumph in her eyes. "He <i>is</i>  the baron, and no Pole. You Germans love masquerades and jokes. This  is one, but I must spoil it before it is played out."    
"Pardon; mademoiselle is keen, but in this she is mistaken. Casimer is  <i>not</i> the baron; he did fight for Poland, and his name is known and  honored there. Of this I solemnly assure you."    
She stood up and looked him straight in the face. He met her eye to  eye, and never wavered till her own fell.    
She mused a few minutes, entirely forgetful of herself in her  eagerness to solve the mystery.    
Hoffman stood so near that her dress touched him, and the wind blew  her scarf against his hand; and as she thought he watched her while  his eyes kindled, his color rose, and once he opened his lips to  speak, but she moved at the instant, and exclaimed,--    
"I have it!"    
"Now for it," he muttered, as if preparing for some new surprise or  attack.    
"When uncle used to talk about the Polish revolution, there was, I  remember a gallant young Pole who did something brave. The name  just flashed on me, and it clears up my doubts. Stanislas  Prakora--'S.P.'--and Casimer is the man."    
Helen spoke with an eager, bright face, as if sure of the truth now;  but, to her surprise, Hoffman laughed, a short, irrepressible laugh,  full of hearty but brief merriment. He sobered in a breath, and with  an entire change of countenance said, in an embarrassed tone,--    
"Pardon my rudeness; mademoiselle's acuteness threw me off my guard.  I can say nothing till released from my promise; but mademoiselle may  rest assured that Casimer Teblinski is as good and brave a man as  Stanislas Prakora."    
Helen's eyes sparkled, for in this reluctant reply she read  confirmation of her suspicion, and thought that Amy would rejoice to  learn that her lover was a hero.    
"You <i>are</i> exiles, but still hope and plot, and never relinquish your  hearts' desire?"    
"Never, mademoiselle!"    
"You are in danger?"    
"In daily peril of losing all we most love and long for," answered  Karl, with such passion that Helen found patriotism a lovely and  inspiring thing.    
"You have enemies?" she asked, unable to control her interest, and  feeling the charm of these confidences.    
"Alas! yes," was the mournful reply, as Karl dropped his eyes to hide  the curious expression of mirth which he could not banish from them.    
"Can you not conquer them, or escape the danger they place you in?"    
"We hope to conquer, we cannot escape."    
"This accounts for your disguise and Casimer's false name?"    
"Yes. We beg that mademoiselle will pardon us the anxiety and  perplexity we have caused her, and hope that a time will soon arrive  when we may be ourselves. I fear the romantic interest with which  the ladies have honored us will be much lessened, but we shall still  remain their most humble and devoted servants."    
Something in his tone nettled Helen, and she said sharply,--    
"All this may be amusing to you, but it spoils my confidence in others  to know they wear masks. Is your name also false?"    
"I am Karl Hoffman, as surely as the sun shines, mademoiselle. Do not  wound me by a doubt," he said, eagerly.    
"And nothing more?"    
She smiled as she spoke, and glanced at his darkened skin with a shake  of the head.    
"I dare not answer that."    
"No matter; I hate titles, and value people for their own worth, not  for their rank."    
Helen spoke impulsively, and, as if carried away by her words and  manner, Hoffman caught her hand and pressed his lips to it ardently,  dropped it, and was gone, as if fearing to trust himself a moment  longer.    
Helen stood where he left her, thinking, with a shy glance from her  hand to the spot where he had stood,--    
"It <i>is</i> pleasant to have one's hand kissed, as Amy said. Poor Karl,  his fate is almost as hard as Casimer's."    
Some subtile power seemed to make the four young people shun one  another carefully, though all longed to be together. The major  appeared to share the secret disquiet that made the rest roam  listlessly about, till little Roserl came to invite them to a <i>fete</i>  in honor of the vintage. All were glad to go, hoping in the novelty  and excitement to recover their composure.    
The vineyard sloped up from the chateau, and on the hillside was a  small plateau of level sward, shadowed by a venerable oak now hung  with garlands, while underneath danced the chateau servants with their  families, to the music of a pipe played by little Friedel. As the  gentlefolk approached, the revel stopped, but the major, who was in an  antic mood and disposed to be gracious, bade Friedel play on, and as  Mrs. Cumberland refused his hand with a glance at her weeds, the major  turned to the Count's buxom housekeeper, and besought her to waltz  with him. She assented, and away they went as nimbly as the best. Amy  laughed, but stopped to blush, as Casimer came up with an imploring  glance, and whispered,--    
"Is it possible that I may enjoy one divine waltz with you before I  go?"    
Amy gave him her hand with a glad assent, and Helen was left alone.  Every one was dancing but herself and Hoffman, who stood near by,  apparently unconscious of the fact. He glanced covertly at her, and  saw that she was beating time with foot and hand, that her eyes shone,  her lips smiled. He seemed to take courage at this, for, walking  straight up to her, he said, as coolly as if a crown-prince,--    
"Mademoiselle, may I have the honor?"    
A flash of surprise passed over her face, but there was no anger,  pride, or hesitation in her manner, as she leaned toward him with a  quiet "Thanks, monsieur."    
A look of triumph was in his eyes as he swept her away to dance, as  she had never danced before, for a German waltz is full of life and  spirit, wonderfully captivating to English girls, and German gentlemen  make it a memorable experience when they please. As they circled round  the rustic ball-room, Hoffman never took his eyes off Helen's, and,  as if fascinated, she looked up at him, half conscious that he was  reading her heart as she read his. He said not a word, but his  face grew very tender, very beautiful in her sight, as she forgot  everything except that he had saved her life and she loved him. When  they paused, she was breathless and pale; he also; and seating her he  went away to bring her a glass of wine. As her dizzy eyes grew clear,  she saw a little case at her feet, and taking it up, opened it. A worn  paper, containing some faded forget-me-nots and these words, fell  out,--    
"Gathered where Helen sat on the night of August 10th."    
There was just time to restore its contents to the case, when Hoffman  returned, saw it, and looked intensely annoyed as he asked, quickly,--    
"Did you read the name on it?"    
"I saw only the flowers;" and Helen colored beautifully as she spoke.    
"And read <i>them</i>?" he asked, with a look she could not meet.    
She was spared an answer, for just then a lad came up, saying, as he  offered a note,--    
"Monsieur Hoffman, madame, at the hotel, sends you this, and begs you  to come at once."    
As he impatiently opened it, the wind blew the paper into Helen's lap.  She restored it, and in the act, her quick eye caught the signature,  "Thine ever, Ludmilla."    
A slight shadow passed over her face, leaving it very cold and quiet.  Hoffman saw the change, and smiled, as if well pleased, but assuming  suddenly his usual manner, said deferentially,--    
"Will mademoiselle permit me to visit my friend for an hour?--she is  expecting me."    
"Go, then, we do not need you," was the brief reply, in a careless  tone, as if his absence was a thing of no interest to any one.    
"Thanks; I shall not be long away;" and giving her a glance that made  her turn scarlet with anger at its undisguised admiration, he walked  away, humming gayly to himself Goethe's lines,--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Maiden's heart and city's wall <br> Were made to yield, were made to fall; <br> When we've held them each their day, <br> Soldier-like we march away."</small></i></blockquote> <br>
