  This etext was transcribed from a volume of the 21st printing 
  The following modifications were applied while transcribing the   printed book to e-text: 
  &nbsp;While the other books in this series are consistently printed with <BR> &nbsp;a hyphen in &#8220;lieutenant-colonel&quot;, some chapters in this book were <BR> &nbsp;printed with and some without.  I added the hyphen where missing  in <BR> &nbsp;chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 14. 
  &nbsp;chapter 1 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 20, para 10, changed &#8220;its&#8221; to &#8220;it's&#8221; 
  &nbsp;chapter 2 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 45, para 6, removed extraneous quotation mark 
  &nbsp;chapter 6 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 132, para 3, moved a comma&#8212;my general policy is not to <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add/remove/move commas, even though I often find commas which <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to me out of place, but this one was just too bad to  ignore 
  &nbsp;chapter 8 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 159, para 2, fixed typo (&#8220;enmy&quot;) <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 167, para 5, missing quotation mark 
  &nbsp;chapter 10 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 211, para 4, missing quotation mark <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 216, para 6, changed &#8220;his section&#8221; to &#8220;this section&#8221; 
  &nbsp;chapter 11 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 225, para 4, fixed typo (&#8220;Generel&quot;) 
  &nbsp;chapter 12 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 249, para 4, fixed typo (&#8220;exerienced&quot;) <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 261, para 4, fixed typo (&#8220;woud&quot;) <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 262, para 1, removed excess quotation mark 
  &nbsp;chapter 13 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 277, para 3, missing quotation mark <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 292, para 3, apostrophe printed instead of quotation mark 
  &nbsp;chapter 14 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 298, para 4, changed &#8220;Its&#8221; to &#8220;It's&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 312, para 6, missing quotation mark <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 314, para 4, changed &#8221;.&#8221; to &#8221;:&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 315, para 5, removed excess period 
  &nbsp;chapter 15 <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 329, para 5, fixed typo (&#8220;painly&quot;) <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 331, para 1, fixed typo (&#8220;caried&quot;) <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;-Page 331, para 11, changed apostrophe to quotation mark 
  &nbsp;Limitations imposed by converting to plain ASCII: 8-bit characters <BR> &nbsp;were converted to their 7-bit equivalents: <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-chapter 9, page 186, &#8220;melee&quot; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-chapter 11, page 241, &#8220;Themopylae&#8221; (&#8220;ae&#8221; ligature) 
  I did not modify: 
  &nbsp;-As with all the books in this series, commas often seem to me to  be <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missing or misplaced.  Often one comma is printed where either  no <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comma or two commas would seem more appropriate, for example: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasant month for Harry, and all the young staff officers  passed <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Winchester.
