"So held this king to the customs old,<br> that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained,<br> the meed of my might; he made me gifts,<br> Healfdene's heir, for my own disposal.<br> Now to thee, my prince, I proffer them all,<br> gladly give them. Thy grace alone<br> can find me favor. Few indeed<br> have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!"<br> Then he bade them bear him the boar-head standard,<br> the battle-helm high, and breastplate gray,<br> the splendid sword; then spake in form: --<br> "Me this war-gear the wise old prince,<br> Hrothgar, gave, and his hest he added,<br> that its story be straightway said to thee. --<br> A while it was held by Heorogar king,<br> for long time lord of the land of Scyldings;<br> yet not to his son the sovran left it,<br> to daring Heoroweard, -- dear as he was to him,<br> his harness of battle. -- Well hold thou it all!"<br> And I heard that soon passed o'er the path of this treasure,<br> all apple-fallow, four good steeds,<br> each like the others, arms and horses<br> he gave to the king. So should kinsmen be,<br> not weave one another the net of wiles,<br> or with deep-hid treachery death contrive<br> for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever<br> by hardy Hygelac held full dear,<br> and each kept watch o'er the other's weal.<br> I heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented,<br> wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him<br> sovran's daughter: three steeds he added,<br> slender and saddle-gay. Since such gift<br> the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen.<br> Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow<br> as a man remarked for mighty deeds<br> and acts of honor. At ale he slew not<br> comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,<br> though of sons of earth his strength was greatest,<br> a glorious gift that God had sent<br> the splendid leader. Long was he spurned,<br> and worthless by Geatish warriors held;<br> him at mead the master-of-clans<br> failed full oft to favor at all.<br> Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him,<br> profitless prince; but payment came,<br> to the warrior honored, for all his woes. --<br> Then the bulwark-of-earls[1] bade bring within,<br> hardy chieftain, Hrethel's heirloom<br> garnished with gold: no Geat e'er knew<br> in shape of a sword a statelier prize.<br> The brand he laid in Beowulf's lap;<br> and of hides assigned him seven thousand,[2]<br> with house and high-seat. They held in common<br> land alike by their line of birth,<br> inheritance, home: but higher the king<br> because of his rule o'er the realm itself. 
Now further it fell with the flight of years,<br> with harryings horrid, that Hygelac perished,[3]<br> and Heardred, too, by hewing of swords<br> under the shield-wall slaughtered lay,<br> when him at the van of his victor-folk<br> sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,<br> in arms o'erwhelming Hereric's nephew.<br> Then Beowulf came as king this broad<br> realm to wield; and he ruled it well<br> fifty winters,[4] a wise old prince,<br> warding his land, until One began<br> in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.<br> In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,<br> in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,<br> unknown to mortals. Some man, however,<br> came by chance that cave within<br> to the heathen hoard.[5] In hand he took<br> a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,<br> stole with it away, while the watcher slept,<br> by thievish wiles: for the warden's wrath<br> prince and people must pay betimes! 
[1] Hygelac. 
[2] This is generally assumed to mean hides, though the text simply says "seven thousand." A hide in England meant about 120 acres, though "the size of the acre varied." 
[3] On the historical raid into Frankish territory between 512 and 520 A.D. The subsequent course of events, as gathered from hints of this epic, is partly told in Scandinavian legend. 
[4] The chronology of this epic, as scholars have worked it out, would make Beowulf well over ninety years of age when he fights the dragon. But the fifty years of his reign need not be taken as historical fact. 
[5] The text is here hopelessly illegible, and only the general drift of the meaning can be rescued. For one thing, we have the old myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure. But with this runs the story of some noble, last of his race, who hides all his wealth within this barrow and there chants his farewell to life's glories. After his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches over it. A condemned or banished man, desperate, hides in the barrow, discovers the treasure, and while the dragon sleeps, makes off with a golden beaker or the like, and carries it for propitiation to his master. The dragon discovers the loss and exacts fearful penalty from the people round about.

THAT way he went with no will of his own,<br> in danger of life, to the dragon's hoard,<br> but for pressure of peril, some prince's thane.<br> He fled in fear the fatal scourge,<br> seeking shelter, a sinful man,<br> and entered in. At the awful sight<br> tottered that guest, and terror seized him;<br> yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon<br> from fright and fear ere he fled away,<br> and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.<br> Of such besides there was store enough,<br> heirlooms old, the earth below,<br> which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,<br> left the last of his lofty race,<br> heedfully there had hidden away,<br> dearest treasure. For death of yore<br> had hurried all hence; and he alone<br> left to live, the last of the clan,<br> weeping his friends, yet wished to bide<br> warding the treasure, his one delight,<br> though brief his respite. The barrow, new-ready,<br> to strand and sea-waves stood anear,<br> hard by the headland, hidden and closed;<br> there laid within it his lordly heirlooms<br> and heaped hoard of heavy gold<br> that warden of rings. Few words he spake:<br> "Now hold thou, earth, since heroes may not,<br> what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee<br> brave men brought it! But battle-death seized<br> and cruel killing my clansmen all,<br> robbed them of life and a liegeman's joys.<br> None have I left to lift the sword,<br> or to cleanse the carven cup of price,<br> beaker bright. My brave are gone.<br> And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,<br> shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep<br> who could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;<br> and those weeds of war that were wont to brave<br> over bicker of shields the bite of steel<br> rust with their bearer. The ringed mail<br> fares not far with famous chieftain,<br> at side of hero! No harp's delight,<br> no glee-wood's gladness! No good hawk now<br> flies through the hall! Nor horses fleet<br> stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death<br> the flower of my race have reft away."<br> Mournful of mood, thus he moaned his woe,<br> alone, for them all, and unblithe wept<br> by day and by night, till death's fell wave<br> o'erwhelmed his heart. His hoard-of-bliss<br> that old ill-doer open found,<br> who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,<br> naked foe-dragon flying by night<br> folded in fire: the folk of earth<br> dread him sore. 'Tis his doom to seek<br> hoard in the graves, and heathen gold<br> to watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!<br> Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus<br> held the house of the hoard in earth<br> three hundred winters; till One aroused<br> wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing<br> that costly cup, and the king implored<br> for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,<br> borne off was booty. His boon was granted<br> that wretched man; and his ruler saw<br> first time what was fashioned in far-off days.<br> When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.<br> O'er the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found<br> footprint of foe who so far had gone<br> in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --<br> So may the undoomed easily flee<br> evils and exile, if only he gain<br> the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold<br> o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find<br> the man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.<br> Savage and burning, the barrow he circled<br> all without; nor was any there,<br> none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,<br> was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,<br> sought the cup, and discovered soon<br> that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,<br> his lordly gold. The guardian waited<br> ill-enduring till evening came;<br> boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,<br> and fain with flame the foe to pay<br> for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled<br> as the worm had wished. By its wall no more<br> was it glad to bide, but burning flew<br> folded in flame: a fearful beginning<br> for sons of the soil; and soon it came,<br> in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end. 
<b>XXXIII</b> 
THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,<br> and bright homes burned. The blaze stood high<br> all landsfolk frighting. No living thing<br> would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.<br> Wide was the dragon's warring seen,<br> its fiendish fury far and near,<br> as the grim destroyer those Geatish people<br> hated and hounded. To hidden lair,<br> to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.<br> Folk of the land it had lapped in flame,<br> with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,<br> its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain! 
To Beowulf then the bale was told<br> quickly and truly: the king's own home,<br> of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,<br> that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man<br> sad in heart, 'twas heaviest sorrow.<br> The sage assumed that his sovran God<br> he had angered, breaking ancient law,<br> and embittered the Lord. His breast within<br> with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.<br> The folk's own fastness that fiery dragon<br> with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold all<br> washed by waves; but the warlike king,<br> prince of the Weders, plotted vengeance.<br> Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work<br> all of iron -- the earl's commander --<br> a war-shield wondrous: well he knew<br> that forest-wood against fire were worthless,<br> linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,<br> he was fated to finish this fleeting life,[1]<br> his days on earth, and the dragon with him,<br> though long it had watched o'er the wealth of thehoard! --<br> Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,<br> to follow the flyer-afar with a host,<br> a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared he,<br> nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,<br> its vigor and valor: ventures desperate<br> he had passed a-plenty, and perils of war,<br> contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,<br> Hrothgar's hall he had wholly purged,<br> and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,<br> loathsome breed! Not least was that<br> of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac fell,<br> when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,<br> lord of his folk, in the Frisian land,<br> son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,<br> by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled<br> through strength of himself and his swimming power,<br> though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty<br> coats of mail, when he came to the sea!<br> Nor yet might Hetwaras[2] haughtily boast<br> their craft of contest, who carried against him<br> shields to the fight: but few escaped<br> from strife with the hero to seek their homes!<br> Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son<br> lonely and sorrowful, seeking his land,<br> where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,<br> rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught<br> the strength of her son to save their kingdom<br> from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death.<br> No sooner for this could the stricken ones<br> in any wise move that atheling's mind<br> over young Heardred's head as lord<br> and ruler of all the realm to be:<br> yet the hero upheld him with helpful words,<br> aided in honor, till, older grown,<br> he wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles<br> sought him o'er seas, the sons of Ohtere,<br> who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,<br> the bravest and best that broke the rings,<br> in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' line,<br> haughty hero.[3] Hence Heardred's end.<br> For shelter he gave them, sword-death came,<br> the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;<br> but the son of Ongentheow sought again<br> house and home when Heardred fell,<br> leaving Beowulf lord of Geats<br> and gift-seat's master. -- A good king he!

THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite<br> in after days; and to Eadgils he proved<br> friend to the friendless, and forces sent<br> over the sea to the son of Ohtere,<br> weapons and warriors: well repaid he<br> those care-paths cold when the king he slew.[1]<br> Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow<br> had passed a plenty, through perils dire,<br> with daring deeds, till this day was come<br> that doomed him now with the dragon to strive.<br> With comrades eleven the lord of Geats<br> swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.<br> He had heard whence all the harm arose<br> and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price<br> on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.<br> In the throng was this one thirteenth man,<br> starter of all the strife and ill,<br> care-laden captive; cringing thence<br> forced and reluctant, he led them on<br> till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,<br> the barrow delved near billowy surges,<br> flood of ocean. Within 'twas full<br> of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,<br> warrior trusty, the treasures held,<br> lurked in his lair. Not light the task<br> of entrance for any of earth-born men!<br> Sat on the headland the hero king,<br> spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,<br> gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,<br> wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh<br> stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,<br> to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart<br> life and body. Not long would be<br> the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh.<br> Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "Through store of struggles I strove in youth,<br> mighty feuds; I mind them all.<br> I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,<br> friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,<br> had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,<br> with food and fee, faithful in kinship.<br> Ne'er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,<br> bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,<br> Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.<br> For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,<br> by kinsman's deed, was the death-bed strewn,<br> when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,<br> his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,<br> missed the mark and his mate shot down,<br> one brother the other, with bloody shaft.<br> A feeless fight,[2] and a fearful sin,<br> horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,<br> unavenged must the atheling die!<br> Too awful it is for an aged man<br> to bide and bear, that his bairn so young<br> rides on the gallows. A rime he makes,<br> sorrow-song for his son there hanging<br> as rapture of ravens; no rescue now<br> can come from the old, disabled man!<br> Still is he minded, as morning breaks,<br> of the heir gone elsewhere;[3] another he hopes not<br> he will bide to see his burg within<br> as ward for his wealth, now the one has found<br> doom of death that the deed incurred.<br> Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,<br> wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers<br> reft of revel.

"THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants<br> alone for his lost. Too large all seems,<br> homestead and house. So the helmet-of-Weders<br> hid in his heart for Herebeald<br> waves of woe.

But Wyrd denied it,<br> and victory's honors. -- His arm he lifted<br> lord of the Geats, the grim foe smote<br> with atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned<br> brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly<br> than its noble master had need of then<br> in his baleful stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper<br> waxed full wild for that weighty blow,<br> cast deadly flames; wide drove and far<br> those vicious fires. No victor's glory<br> the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,<br> naked in battle, as never it should,<br> excellent iron! -- 'Twas no easy path<br> that Ecgtheow's honored heir must tread<br> over the plain to the place of the foe;<br> for against his will he must win a home<br> elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving<br> this lapsing life! -- Not long it was<br> ere those champions grimly closed again.<br> The hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved hisbreast<br> once more; and by peril was pressed again,<br> enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!<br> Nor yet about him his band of comrades,<br> sons of athelings, armed stood<br> with warlike front: to the woods they bent them,<br> their lives to save.

WIGLAF his name was, Weohstan's son,<br> linden-thane loved, the lord of Scylfings,<br> Aelfhere's kinsman. His king he now saw<br> with heat under helmet hard oppressed.<br> He minded the prizes his prince had given him,<br> wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line,<br> and folk-rights that his father owned<br> Not long he lingered. The linden yellow,<br> his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew: --<br> as heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it,<br> who was slain by the sword-edge, son of Ohtere,<br> friendless exile, erst in fray<br> killed by Weohstan, who won for his kin<br> brown-bright helmet, breastplate ringed,<br> old sword of Eotens, Onela's gift,<br> weeds of war of the warrior-thane,<br> battle-gear brave: though a brother's child<br> had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela.[1]<br> For winters this war-gear Weohstan kept,<br> breastplate and board, till his bairn had grown<br> earlship to earn as the old sire did:<br> then he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle,<br> portion huge, when he passed from life,<br> fared aged forth. For the first time now<br> with his leader-lord the liegeman young<br> was bidden to share the shock of battle.<br> Neither softened his soul, nor the sire's bequest<br> weakened in war.[2] So the worm found out<br> when once in fight the foes had met!<br> Wiglaf spake, -- and his words were sage;<br> sad in spirit, he said to his comrades: --<br> "I remember the time, when mead we took,<br> what promise we made to this prince of ours<br> in the banquet-hall, to our breaker-of-rings,<br> for gear of combat to give him requital,<br> for hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring<br> stress of this sort! Himself who chose us<br> from all his army to aid him now,<br> urged us to glory, and gave these treasures,<br> because he counted us keen with the spear<br> and hardy 'neath helm, though this hero-work<br> our leader hoped unhelped and alone<br> to finish for us, -- folk-defender<br> who hath got him glory greater than all men<br> for daring deeds! Now the day is come<br> that our noble master has need of the might<br> of warriors stout. Let us stride along<br> the hero to help while the heat is about him<br> glowing and grim! For God is my witness<br> I am far more fain the fire should seize<br> along with my lord these limbs of mine![3]<br> Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear<br> homeward hence, save here we essay<br> to fell the foe and defend the life<br> of the Weders' lord. I wot 'twere shame<br> on the law of our land if alone the king<br> out of Geatish warriors woe endured<br> and sank in the struggle! My sword and helmet,<br> breastplate and board, for us both shall serve!"<br> Through slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain,<br> his battle-helm bore, and brief words spake: --<br> "Beowulf dearest, do all bravely,<br> as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst<br> that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise<br> thy glory droop! Now, great in deeds,<br> atheling steadfast, with all thy strength<br> shield thy life! I will stand to help thee."<br> At the words the worm came once again,<br> murderous monster mad with rage,<br> with fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek,<br> the hated men. In heat-waves burned<br> that board[4] to the boss, and the breastplate failed<br> to shelter at all the spear-thane young.<br> Yet quickly under his kinsman's shield<br> went eager the earl, since his own was now<br> all burned by the blaze. The bold king again<br> had mind of his glory: with might his glaive<br> was driven into the dragon's head, --<br> blow nerved by hate. But Naegling[5] was shivered,<br> broken in battle was Beowulf's sword,<br> old and gray. 'Twas granted him not<br> that ever the edge of iron at all<br> could help him at strife: too strong was his hand,<br> so the tale is told, and he tried too far<br> with strength of stroke all swords he wielded,<br> though sturdy their steel: they steaded him nought.<br> Then for the third time thought on its feud<br> that folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon,<br> and rushed on the hero, where room allowed,<br> battle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth<br> closed on his neck, and covered him<br> with waves of blood from his breast that welled. 
[1] That is, although Eanmund was brother's son to Onela, the slaying of the former by Weohstan is not felt as cause of feud, and is rewarded by gift of the slain man's weapons.

'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need<br> that the earl made known his noble strain,<br> craft and keenness and courage enduring.<br> Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,<br> hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.<br> A little lower the loathsome beast<br> he smote with sword; his steel drove in<br> bright and burnished; that blaze began<br> to lose and lessen. At last the king<br> wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,<br> a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,<br> and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,<br> felled the foe, flung forth its life.<br> So had they killed it, kinsmen both,<br> athelings twain: thus an earl should be<br> in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor<br> this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,<br> of his work in the world. The wound began,<br> which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,<br> to swell and smart; and soon he found<br> in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,<br> pain of poison. The prince walked on,<br> wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;<br> then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,<br> where arch of stone and steadfast column<br> upheld forever that hall in earth.<br> Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless<br> lave with water his winsome lord,<br> the king and conqueror covered with blood,<br> with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.<br> Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,<br> his mortal wound; full well he knew<br> his portion now was past and gone<br> of earthly bliss, and all had fled<br> of his file of days, and death was near:<br> "I would fain bestow on son of mine<br> this gear of war, were given me now<br> that any heir should after me come<br> of my proper blood. This people I ruled<br> fifty winters. No folk-king was there,<br> none at all, of the neighboring clans<br> who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends'[1]<br> and threat me with horrors. At home I bided<br> what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;<br> feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore<br> ever on oath. For all these things,<br> though fatally wounded, fain am I!<br> From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,<br> when life from my frame must flee away,<br> for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go<br> and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,<br> Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,<br> sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.<br> And fare in haste. I would fain behold<br> the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,<br> have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down<br> softlier for sight of this splendid hoard<br> my life and the lordship I long have held."

I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan<br> at wish and word of his wounded king, --<br> war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,<br> battle-sark, bore 'neath the barrow's roof.<br> Then the clansman keen, of conquest proud,<br> passing the seat,[1] saw store of jewels<br> and glistening gold the ground along;<br> by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel<br> in the den of the dragon, the dawn-flier old:<br> unburnished bowls of bygone men<br> reft of richness; rusty helms<br> of the olden age; and arm-rings many<br> wondrously woven. -- Such wealth of gold,<br> booty from barrow, can burden with pride<br> each human wight: let him hide it who will! --<br> His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner<br> high o'er the hoard, of handiwork noblest,<br> brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,<br> all the earth-floor he easily saw<br> and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now<br> was seen of the serpent: the sword had ta'en him.<br> Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,<br> old work of giants, by one alone;<br> he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate<br> at his own good will, and the ensign took,<br> brightest of beacons. -- The blade of his lord<br> -- its edge was iron -- had injured deep<br> one that guarded the golden hoard<br> many a year and its murder-fire<br> spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows<br> at midnight hour, till it met its doom.<br> Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him<br> his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,<br> high-souled hero, if haply he'd find<br> alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,<br> weakening fast by the wall of the cave.<br> So he carried the load. His lord and king<br> he found all bleeding, famous chief<br> at the lapse of life. The liegeman again<br> plashed him with water, till point of word<br> broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,<br> sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. --<br> "For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,<br> to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,<br> for what I behold, to Heaven's Lord,<br> for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk<br> or ever the day of my death be run!<br> Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure<br> the last of my life, so look ye well<br> to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.<br> A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise<br> for my ashes. 'Twill shine by the shore of the flood,<br> to folk of mine memorial fair<br> on Hrones Headland high uplifted,<br> that ocean-wanderers oft may hail<br> Beowulf's Barrow, as back from far<br> they drive their keels o'er the darkling wave."<br> From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold,<br> valorous king, to his vassal gave it<br> with bright-gold helmet, breastplate, and ring,<br> to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.<br> "Thou art end and remnant of all our race<br> the Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,<br> all my line, to the land of doom,<br> earls in their glory: I after them go."<br> This word was the last which the wise old man<br> harbored in heart ere hot death-waves<br> of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled<br> his soul to seek the saints' reward.

IT was heavy hap for that hero young<br> on his lord beloved to look and find him<br> lying on earth with life at end,<br> sorrowful sight. But the slayer too,<br> awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,<br> lay felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,<br> could the writhing monster rule it more.<br> For edges of iron had ended its days,<br> hard and battle-sharp, hammers' leaving;[1]<br> and that flier-afar had fallen to ground<br> hushed by its hurt, its hoard all near,<br> no longer lusty aloft to whirl<br> at midnight, making its merriment seen,<br> proud of its prizes: prone it sank<br> by the handiwork of the hero-king.<br> Forsooth among folk but few achieve,<br> -- though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,<br> and never so daring in deed of valor, --<br> the perilous breath of a poison-foe<br> to brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,<br> whenever his watch the warden keeps<br> bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid<br> the price of death for that precious hoard;<br> and each of the foes had found the end<br> of this fleeting life.<br> Befell erelong<br> that the laggards in war the wood had left,<br> trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,<br> fearing before to flourish a spear<br> in the sore distress of their sovran lord.<br> Now in their shame their shields they carried,<br> armor of fight, where the old man lay;<br> and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat<br> at his sovran's shoulder, shieldsman good,<br> to wake him with water.[2] Nowise it availed.<br> Though well he wished it, in world no more<br> could he barrier life for that leader-of-battles<br> nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.<br> Doom of the Lord was law o'er the deeds<br> of every man, as it is to-day.<br> Grim was the answer, easy to get,<br> from the youth for those that had yielded to fear!<br> Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --<br> mournful he looked on those men unloved: --<br> "Who sooth will speak, can say indeed<br> that the ruler who gave you golden rings<br> and the harness of war in which ye stand<br> -- for he at ale-bench often-times<br> bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,<br> lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear<br> which near of far he could find to give, --<br> threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,<br> on men who failed when the foemen came!<br> Not at all could the king of his comrades-in-arms<br> venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,<br> God, gave him grace that he got revenge<br> sole with his sword in stress and need.<br> To rescue his life, 'twas little that I<br> could serve him in struggle; yet shift I made<br> (hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.<br> Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck<br> that fatal foe, and the fire less strongly<br> flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes<br> in throe of contest that thronged to our king!<br> Now gift of treasure and girding of sword,<br> joy of the house and home-delight<br> shall fail your folk; his freehold-land<br> every clansman within your kin<br> shall lose and leave, when lords highborn<br> hear afar of that flight of yours,<br> a fameless deed. Yea, death is better<br> for liegemen all than a life of shame!"

THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,<br> at the fort on the cliff, where, full of sorrow,<br> all the morning earls had sat,<br> daring shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:<br> would they wail as dead, or welcome home,<br> their lord beloved? Little[1] kept back<br> of the tidings new, but told them all,<br> the herald that up the headland rode. --<br> "Now the willing-giver to Weder folk<br> in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats<br> on the slaughter-bed sleeps by the serpent's deed!<br> And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men<br> with knife-wounds sick:[2] no sword availed<br> on the awesome thing in any wise<br> to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,<br> Weohstan's bairn, by Beowulf's side,<br> the living earl by the other dead,<br> and heavy of heart a head-watch[3] keeps<br> o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look<br> for waging of war when once unhidden<br> to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king<br> is spread afar. -- The strife began<br> when hot on the Hugas[4] Hygelac fell<br> and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.<br> Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war,<br> plied with such prowess their power o'erwhelming<br> that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it<br> and fell in fight. To his friends no wise<br> could that earl give treasure! And ever since<br> the Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.<br> Nor aught expect I of peace and faith<br> from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar<br> how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood<br> Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,<br> when the folk of Geats for the first time sought<br> in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.<br> Soon the sage old sire[5] of Ohtere,<br> ancient and awful, gave answering blow;<br> the sea-king[6] he slew, and his spouse redeemed,<br> his good wife rescued, though robbed of her gold,<br> mother of Ohtere and Onela.<br> Then he followed his foes, who fled before him<br> sore beset and stole their way,<br> bereft of a ruler, to Ravenswood. 
With his host he besieged there what swords had left,<br> the weary and wounded; woes he threatened<br> the whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:<br> some with the morrow his sword should kill,<br> some should go to the gallows-tree<br> for rapture of ravens. But rescue came<br> with dawn of day for those desperate men<br> when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound,<br> tones of his trumpet; the trusty king<br> had followed their trail with faithful band.
