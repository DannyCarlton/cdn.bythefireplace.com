  For perhaps a minute Carrigan made no sound that could have been   heard three feet away from him. It was not fear that held him  quiet.  It was something which he could not explain afterward, the  sensation,  perhaps, of one who feels himself confronted for a  moment by a  presence more potent than that of flesh and blood.  BLACK ROGER  AUDEMARD! Three times, twice in his sickness, some one  had cried out  that name in his ears since the hour when St.  Pierre's wife had  ambushed him on the white carpet of sand. And  the voice was now in his  room! 
  Was it Bateese, inspired by some sort of malformed humor? Carrigan   listened. Another minute passed. He reached out a hand and groped   about him, very careful not to make a sound, urged by the feeling   that some one was almost within reach of him. He flung back his   blanket and stood out in the middle of the floor. 
  Still he heard no movement, no soft footfalls of retreat or   advance. He lighted a match and held it high above his head. In  its  yellow illumination he could see nothing alive. He lighted a  lamp. The  cabin was empty. He drew a deep breath and went to the  window. It was  still open. The voice had undoubtedly come to him  through that window,  and he fancied he could see where the screen  netting was crushed a bit  inward, as though a face had pressed  heavily against it. Outside the  night was beautifully calm. The  sky, washed by storm, was bright with  stars. But there was not a  ripple of movement that he could hear. 
  After that he looked at his watch. He must have been sleeping for   some time when the voice roused him, for it was nearly three  o'clock.  In spite of the stars, dawn was close at hand. When he  looked out of  the window again they were paler and more distant.  He had no intention  of going back to bed. He was restless and felt  himself surrendering  more and more to the grip of presentiment. 
  It was still early, not later than six o'clock, when Bateese came   in with his breakfast. He was surprised, as he had heard no  movement  or sound of voices to give evidence of life anywhere near  the bateau.  Instantly he made up his mind that it was not Bateese  who had uttered  the mysterious words of a few hours ago, for the  half-breed had  evidently experienced a most uncomfortable night.  He was like a rat  recently pulled out of water. His clothes hung  upon him sodden and  heavy, his head kerchief dripped, and his lank  hair was wet. He  slammed the breakfast things down on the table  and went out again  without so much as nodding at his prisoner. 
  Again a sense of discomfort and shame swept over David, as he sat   down to breakfast. Here he was comfortably, even luxuriously,  housed,  while out there somewhere St. Pierre's lovely wife was  drenched and  even more miserable than Bateese. And the breakfast  amazed him. It was  not so much the caribou tenderloin, rich in its  own red juice, or the  potato, or the pot of coffee that was  filling the cabin with its  aroma, that roused his wonder, but the  hot, brown muffins that  accompanied the other things. Muffins! And  after a deluge that had  drowned every square inch of the earth!  How had Bateese turned the  trick? 
  Bateese did not return immediately for the dishes, and for half an   hour after he had finished breakfast Carrigan smoked his pipe and   watched the blue haze of fires on the far side of the river. The   world was a blaze of sunlit glory. His imagination carried him  across  the river. Somewhere over there, in an open spot where the  sun was  blazing, Jeanne Marie-Anne was probably drying herself  after the night  of storm. There was but little doubt in his mind  that she was already  heaping the ignominy of blame upon him. That  was the woman of it. 
  A knock at his door drew him about. It was a light, quick TAP,   TAP, TAP&#8212;not like the fist of either Bateese or Nepapinas. In   another moment the door swung open, and in the flood of sunlight  that  poured into the cabin stood St. Pierre's wife! 
  It was not her presence, but the beauty of her, that held him   spellbound. It was a sort of shock after the vivid imaginings of  his  mind in which he had seen her beaten and tortured by storm.  Her hair,  glowing in the sun and piled up in shining coils on the  crown of her  head, was not wet. She was not the rain-beaten little  partridge that  had passed in tragic bedragglement through his  mind. Storm had not  touched her. Her cheeks were soft with the  warm flush of long hours of  sleep. When she came in, her lips  greeting him with a little smile,  all that he had built up for  himself in the hours of the night  crumbled away in dust. Again he  forgot for a moment that she was St.  Pierre's wife. She was woman,  and as he looked upon her now, the most  adorable woman in all the  world. 
  &quot;You are better this morning,&quot; she said. Real pleasure shone in   her eyes. She had left the door open, so that the sun filled the   room. &quot;I think the storm helped you. Wasn't it splendid?&quot; 
  David swallowed hard. &quot;Quite splendid,&quot; he managed to say. &quot;Have   you seen Bateese this morning?&quot; 
  A little note of laughter came into her throat. &quot;Yes. I don't   think he liked it. He doesn't understand why I love storms. Did  you  sleep well, M'sieu Carrigan?&quot; 
  &quot;An hour or two, I think. I was worrying about you. I didn't like   the thought that I had turned you out into the storm. But it  doesn't  seem to have touched you.&quot; 
  &quot;No. I was there&#8212;quite comfortable.&quot; She nodded to the forward   bulkhead of the cabin, beyond the wardrobe closets and the piano.   &quot;There is a little dining-room and kitchenette ahead,&quot; she  explained.  &quot;Didn't Bateese tell you that?&quot; 
  &quot;No, he didn't. I asked him where you were, and I think he told me   to shut up.&quot; 
  &quot;Bateese is very odd,&quot; said St. Pierre's wife. &quot;He is exceedingly   jealous of me, M'sieu David. Even when I was a baby and he carried  me  about in his arms, he was just that way. Bateese, you know, is  older  than he appears. He is fifty-one.&quot; 
  She was moving about, quite as if his presence was in no way going   to disturb her usual duties of the day. She rearranged the damask   curtains which he had crumpled with his hands, placed two or three   chairs in their usual places, and moved from this to that with the   air of a housewife who is in the habit of brushing up a bit in the   morning. 
  She seemed not at all embarrassed because he was her prisoner, nor   uncomfortably restrained because of the message she had sent to  him  by Bateese. She was warmly and gloriously human. In her  apparent  unconcern at his presence he found himself sweating  inwardly. A bit  nervously he struck a match to light his pipe,  then extinguished it. 
  She noticed what he had done. &quot;You may smoke,&quot; she said, with that   little note in her throat which he loved to hear, like the  faintest  melody of laughter that did not quite reach her lips.  &quot;St. Pierre  smokes a great deal, and I like it.&quot; 
  She opened a drawer in the dressing-table and came to him with a   box half filled with cigars. 
  &quot;St. Pierre prefers these&#8212;on occasions,&quot; she said, &quot;Do you?&quot; 
  His fingers seemed all thumbs as he took a cigar from the   proffered box. He cursed himself because his tongue felt thick.   Perhaps it was his silence, betraying something of his mental   clumsiness, that brought a faint flush of color into her cheeks.  He  noted that; and also that the top of her shining head came just  about  to his chin, and that her mouth and throat, looking down on  them, were  bewitchingly soft and sweet. 
  And what she said, when her eyes opened wide and beautiful on him   again, was like a knife cutting suddenly into the heart of his   thoughts. 
  &quot;In the evening I love to sit at St. Pierre's feet and watch him   smoke,&quot; she said. &quot;I am glad it doesn't annoy you, because&#8212;I like  to  smoke,&quot; he replied lamely. 
  She placed the box on the little reading table and looked at his   breakfast things. &quot;You like muffins, too. I was up early this   morning, making them for you!&quot; 
  &quot;You made them?&quot; he demanded, as if her words were a most amazing   revelation to him. 
  &quot;Surely, M'sieu David. I make them every morning for St. Pierre.   He is very fond of them. He says the third nicest thing about me  is  my muffins!&quot; 
  &quot;And the other two?&quot; asked David. 
  &quot;Are St. Pierre's little secrets, m'sieu,&quot; she laughed softly, the   color deepening in her cheeks. &quot;It wouldn't be fair to tell you,   would it?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps it wouldn't,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;But there are one or two   other things, Mrs.&#8212;Mrs. Boulain&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You may call me Jeanne, or Marie-Anne, if you care to,&quot; she   interrupted him. &quot;It will be quite all right.&quot; 
  She was picking up the breakfast dishes, not at all perturbed by   the fact that she was offering him a privilege which had the  effect  of quickening his pulse for a moment or two. 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't mind telling you it is going to be   difficult for me to do that&#8212;because&#8212;well, this is a most unusual   situation, isn't it? In spite of all your kindness, including what   was probably your good-intentioned endeavor to put an end to my   earthly miseries behind the rock, I believe it is necessary for  you  to give me some kind of explanation. Don't you?&quot; 
  &quot;Didn't Bateese explain to you last night?&quot; she asked, facing him. 
  &quot;He brought a message from you to the effect that I was a   prisoner, that I must make no attempt to escape, and that if I did   try to escape, you had given your men instructions to kill me.&quot; 
  She nodded, quite seriously. &quot;That is right, M'sieu David.&quot; 
  His face flamed. &quot;Then I am a prisoner? You threaten me with   death?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall treat you very nicely if you make no attempt to escape,   M'sieu David. Isn't that fair?&quot; 
  &quot;Fair!&quot; he cried, choking back an explosion that would have vented   itself on a man. &quot;Don't you realize what has happened? Don't you  know  that according to every law of God and man I should arrest  you and  give you over to the Law? Is it possible that you don't  comprehend my  own duty? What I must do?&quot; 
  If he had noticed, he would have seen that there was no longer the   flush of color in her cheeks. But her eyes, looking straight at  him,  were tranquil and unexcited. She nodded. 
  &quot;That is why you must remain a prisoner, M'sieu David, It is   because I do realize, I shall not tell you why that happened  behind  the rock, and if you ask me, I shall refuse to talk to you.  If I let  you go now, you would probably have me arrested and put  in jail. So I  must keep you until St. Pierre comes. I don't know  what to do&#8212;except  to keep you, and not let you escape until then.  What would you do?&quot; 
  The question was so honest, so like a question that might have   been asked by a puzzled child, that his argument for the Law was   struck dead. He stared into the pale face, the beautiful, waiting   eyes, saw the pathetic intertwining of her slim fingers, and  suddenly  he was grinning in that big, honest way which made people  love Dave  Carrigan. 
  &quot;You're&#8212;doing&#8212;absolutely&#8212;right,&quot; he said. 
  A swift change came in her face. Her cheeks flushed. Her eyes   filled with a sudden glow that made the little violet-freckles in   them dance like tiny flecks of gold. 
  &quot;From your point of view you are right,&quot; he repeated, &quot;and I shall   make no attempt to escape until I have talked with St. Pierre. But  I  can't quite see&#8212;just now&#8212;how he is going to help the  situation.&quot; 
  &quot;He will,&quot; she assured him confidently. 
  &quot;You seem to have an unlimited faith in St. Pierre,&quot; he replied a   little grimly. 
  &quot;Yes, M'sieu David. He is the most wonderful man in the world. And   he will know what to do.&quot; 
  David shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Perhaps, in some nice, quiet place,   he will follow the advice Bateese gave you&#8212;tie a stone round my  neck  and sink me to the bottom of the river.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps. But I don't think he will do that I should object to   it.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, you would!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. St. Pierre is big and strong, afraid of nothing in the   world, but he will do anything for me. I don't think he would kill   you if I asked him not to.&quot; She turned to resume her task of  cleaning  up the breakfast things. 
  With a sudden movement David swung one of the' big chairs close to   her. &quot;Please sit down,&quot; he commanded. &quot;I can talk to you better  that  way. As an officer of the law it is my duty to ask you a few   questions. It rests in your power to answer all of them or none of   them. I have given you my word not to act until I have seen St.   Pierre, and I shall keep that promise. But when we do meet I shall   act largely on the strength of what you tell me during the next  tea  minutes. Please sit down!&quot;
