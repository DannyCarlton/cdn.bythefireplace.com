  Tayoga, into whose hands Robert had entrusted himself with the  uttermost faith, at last said stop, and drawing the paddles into the  canoe they took long, deep breaths of relief. Around them was a world  of waters, silver under the moon and stars now piercing the dusk, and  the Onondaga could see the vast star on which sat the mighty chieftain  who had gone away four hundred years ago to eternal life.
  &#8220;O Tododaho,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;thou hast guarded us well.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where do you think we are, Tayoga?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;Perhaps twenty miles from land,&#8221; replied the Onondaga, &#8220;and the  farther the better.&#8221;
  &#8220;True, Tayoga. Never before did I see a big lake look so kindly. If  it didn't require so much effort I'd like to go to the very center of  it and stay there for a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;Even as it is, Dagaeoga, we will wait here a while and take the  long rest we need.&#8221;
  &#8220;And while we're doing nothing but swing in our great canoe, Tayoga,  I want to thank you for all you've done for me. I'd been a prisoner  much longer than I wished.&#8221;
  &#8220;It but repays my debt, Dagaeoga. You will recall that you helped to  save me from the hands of Tandakora when he was going to burn me at the  stake. My imprisonment was short, but I have been in the forest the  whole winter and spring seeking to take you from Langlade.&#8221;
  &#8220;All of which goes to show, Tayoga, that we must allow only one of  us to be captured at a time. The other must go free in order to rescue  the one taken.&#8221;
  Although Robert's tone was light, his feeling was far from  frivolous, but he had been at extreme tension so long that he was  compelled to seek relief.
  &#8220;How did you manage it, Tayoga?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;In the confusion of the attack on the forts and the rejoicing that  followed it was easy,&#8221; replied the Onondaga. &#8220;When so many others were  dancing and leaping it attracted no attention for me to dance and leap  also, and I selected, without interference, the boat, the extra paddle,  weapons and ammunition that I wished. Areskoui and Tododaho did the  rest. Do you feel stronger now, Dagaeoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, I'm still able to handle the paddle. I suppose we'd better  seek a landing. We can't stay out in the lake forever. Tayoga, you've  taken the part of Providence itself. Now did it occur to you in your  infinite wisdom, while you were storing paddles, weapons and ammunition  in this boat, to store food also?&#8221;
  The Onondaga's smile was wide and satisfying.
  &#8220;I thought of that, too, Dagaeoga,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;because I knew our  journey, if we should be so fortunate as to have a journey, would take  us out on the lake, and I knew, also, that no matter how many hardships  and dangers Dagaeoga might pass through, the time would come when he  would be hungry. It is always so with Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  He took a heavy knapsack from the bottom of the canoe and opened it.
  &#8220;It is a French knapsack,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it contains both bread and  meat, which we will enjoy.&#8221;
  They ate in great content, and their spirits rose to an  extraordinary degree, though Tayoga regretted the absence of clothing  which his disguise had made necessary. Having been educated with white  lads, and having associated with white people so much, he was usually  clad as completely as they, either in their fashion or in his own full  Indian costume.
  &#8220;My infinite wisdom was not so infinite that it told me to take a  blanket,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the wind coming down from the Canadian shore is  growing cold.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm surprised to hear you speak of such trifles as that, Tayoga,  when we've been dealing with affairs of life and death.&#8221;
  &#8220;We are cold or we are warm, Dagaeoga, and peril and suffering do  not alter it. But lo! the wind is bringing the great mists with it, and  we will escape in them.&#8221;
  They turned the canoe toward a point far to the east of the Indian  camp and began to paddle, not hastily but with long, slow, easy strokes  that sent the canoe over the water at a great rate. The fogs and vapors  were thick and close about them, but Tayoga knew the direction. Robert  asked him if he had heard of Willet, and the Onondaga said he had not  seen him, but he had learned from a Mohawk runner that the Great Bear  had reached Waraiyageh with the news of St. Luc's prospective advance,  and Tayoga had also contrived to get news through to him that he was  lying in the forest, waiting a chance to effect the rescue of Robert.
  Toward morning they landed on a shore, clothed in deep and primeval  forest, and with reluctance abandoned their canoe.
  &#8220;It is an Abenaki craft,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;It is made well, it has  served us well, and we will treat it well.&#8221;
  Instead of leaving it on the lake to the mercy of storms they drew  it into some bushes at the mouth of a small creek, where it would stay  securely, and probably serve some day some chance traveler. Then they  plunged into the deep forest, but when they saw a smoke Robert remained  hidden while Tayoga went on, but with the intention of returning.
  The Onondaga was quite sure the smoke indicated the presence of a  small village and his quest was for clothes.
  &#8220;Let Dagaeoga rest in peace here in the thicket,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and when  I come back I shall be clad as a man. Have no fears for me. I will not  enter the village Until after dark.&#8221;
  He glided away without noise, and Robert, having supreme confidence  in him, lay down among the bushes, which were so dense that the keenest  eyes could not have seen him ten feet away. His frame was relaxed so  thoroughly after his immense exertions and he felt such utter  thankfulness at his escape that he soon fell into a deep slumber rather  than sleep, and when he awoke the dark had come, bringing with it  Tayoga.
  &#8220;Lo, Dagaeoga,&#8221; said the Onondaga, in a tone of intense  satisfaction, &#8220;I have done well. It is not pleasant to me to take the  property of others, but in this case what I have seized must have been  captured from the English. No watch was kept in the village, as they  had heard of their great victory and the warriors were away. I secured  three splendid blankets, two of green and one of brown. Since you have  a coat, Dagaeoga, you can have one green blanket and I will take the  other two, one to wear and the other to sleep in. I also took away more  powder and lead, and as I have my bullet molds we can increase our  ammunition when we need it. I have added, too, a supply of venison to  our beef and bread.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're an accomplished burglar, Tayoga, but I think that in this  case your patron saint, Tododaho, will forgive you. I'm devoutly glad  of the blanket. I feel stiff and sore, after such great exertions, and  I find I've grown cold with the coming of the dark.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a relapse,&#8221; said Tayoga with some anxiety. &#8220;The strain on  mind and body has been too great. Better wrap yourself in the blanket  at once, and lie quiet in the thicket.&#8221;
  Robert was prompt to take his advice, as his body was hot and his  sight was wavering. He felt that he was going to be ill and he might  get it over all the quicker by surrendering to it at once. He rolled  the blanket tightly about himself and lay down on the softest spot he  could find. In the night he became delirious and talked continually of  Langlade, St. Luc and Montcalm. But Tayoga watched by him continually  until late, when he hunted through the forest by moonlight for some  powerful herbs known to the Indians. In the morning he beat them and  bruised them and cooked them as best he could without utensils, and  then dropped the juices into his comrade's mouth, after which he  carefully put out the fire, lest it be seen by savage rovers.
  Robert was soon very much better. He had a profuse perspiration and  came out of his unconscious state, but was quite weak. He was also  thoroughly ashamed of himself.
  &#8220;Nice time for me to be breaking down,&#8221; he said, &#8220;here in the  wilderness near an Indian village, hundreds of miles from any of our  friends, save those who are captured. I make my apologies, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;They are not needed,&#8221; said the Onondaga. &#8220;You defended me with your  life when I was wounded and the wolves sought to eat me, now I repay  again. There is nothing for Dagaeoga to do but to keep on perspiring,  see that the blanket is still wrapped around him, and tonight I will  get something in which to cook the food he needs.&#8221;
  &#8220;How will you do that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I will go again to my village. I call it mine because it supplies  what we need and I will return with the spoil. Bide you in peace,  Dagaeoga. You have called me an accomplished burglar. I am more, I am a  great one.&#8221;
  Robert had the utmost confidence in him, and it was justified. When  he awoke from a restless slumber, Tayoga stood beside him, holding in  his hand a small iron kettle made in Canada, and a great iron spoon.
  &#8220;They are the best they had in the village,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not a  large and rich village and so its possessions are not great, but I  think these will do. I have also brought with me some very tender meat  of a young deer that I found in one of the lodges.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're all you claimed to be and more, Tayoga,&#8221; said Robert  earnestly and gratefully.
  The Onondaga lighted a fire in a dip, and cutting the deer into tiny  bits made a most appetizing soup, which Robert's weak stomach was able  to retain and to crave more.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;enough for tonight, but you shall have twice as  much in the morning. Now, go to sleep again.&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't been doing anything but sleep for the last day or two. I  want to get up and walk.&#8221;
  &#8220;And have your fever come back. Besides, you are not strong enough  yet to walk more than a few steps.&#8221;
  Robert knew that he would be forced to obey, and he passed the night  partly in dozing, and partly in staring at the sky. In the morning he  was very hungry and showed an increase of strength. Tayoga, true to his  word, gave him a double portion of the soup, but still forbade sternly  any attempt at walking.
  &#8220;Lie there, Dagaeoga,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and let the wind blow over you, and  I'll go farther into the forest to see if friend or enemy be near.&#8221;
  Robert, feeling that he must, lay peacefully on his back after the  Onondaga left him. He was free from fever, but he knew that Tayoga was  right in forbidding him to walk. It would be several days yet before he  could fulfill his old duties, as an active and powerful forest runner.  Yet he was very peaceful because the soreness of body that had troubled  him was gone and strength was flowing back into his veins. Despite the  fact that he was lying on his back alone in the wilderness, with savage  foes not far away, he believed that he had very much for which to be  grateful. He had been taken almost by a miracle out of the hands of his  foes, and, when he was ill and in his weakness might have been devoured  by wild beasts or might have starved to death, the most loyal and  resourceful of comrades had been by his side to save him.
  He saw the great star on which Tayoga's Tododaho lived, and he  accepted so much of the Iroquois theology, believing that it was in  spirit and essence the same as his own Christian belief, that he almost  imagined he could see the great Onondaga chieftain who had gone away  four centuries ago. In any event, it was a beneficent star, and he was  glad that it shone down on him so brilliantly.
  Tayoga before his departure had loaned him one of his blankets and  now he lay upon it, with the other wrapped around him, his loaded  pistol in his belt and his loaded rifle lying by his side. The fire  that the Onondaga had built in the dip not far away had been put out  carefully and the ashes had been scattered.
  Although it was midsummer, the night, as often happened in that  northern latitude, had come on cool, and the warmth of the blankets was  not unwelcome. Robert knew that he was only a mote in all that vast  wilderness, but the contiguity of the Indian village might cause  warriors, either arriving or departing, to pass near him. So he was not  surprised when he heard footsteps in the bushes not far away, and then  the sound of voices. Instinctively he tried to press his body into the  earth, and he also lifted carefully the loaded rifle, but second  thought told him he was not likely to be seen.
  Warriors presently came so near that they were visible, and to his  surprise and alarm he saw the huge figure of Tandakora among them. They  were about a dozen in number, walking in the most leisurely manner and  once stopped very close to him to talk. Although he raised himself up a  little and clutched the rifle more tightly he was still hopeful that  they would not see him. The Ojibway chieftain was in full war paint,  with a fine new American rifle, and also a small sword swinging from  his belt. Both were undoubtedly trophies of Oswego, and it was certain  that after carrying the sword for a while as a prize he would discard  it. Indians never found much use for swords.
  Robert always believed that Tayoga's Tododaho protected him that  night, because for a while all the chances were against him. As the  warriors stood near talking a frightened deer started up in the  thicket, and Tandakora himself brought it down with a lucky bullet, the  unfortunate animal falling not thirty yards from the hidden youth. They  removed the skin and cut it into portions where it lay, the whole task  taking about a half hour, and all the time Robert, lying under the  brush, saw them distinctly.
  He was in mortal fear lest one of them wander into the dip where  Tayoga had built the fire, and see traces of the ashes, but they did  not do so. Twice warriors walked in that direction and his heart was in  his mouth, but in neither case did the errand take them so far.  Tandakora was not alone in bearing Oswego spoils. Nearly all of them  had something, a rifle, a pistol or a sword, and two wore officers'  laced coats over their painted bodies. The sight filled Robert with  rage. Were his people to go on this way indefinitely, sacrificing men  and posts in unrelated efforts? Would they allow the French, with  inferior numbers, to beat them continuously? He had seen Montcalm and  talked with him, and he feared everything from that daring and  tenacious leader.
  While the Indians prepared the deer the moon and stars came out with  uncommon brilliancy, filling the forest with a misty, silver light.  Robert now saw Tandakora and his men so clearly that it seemed  impossible for them not to see him. Once more he had the instinctive  desire to press himself into the earth, but his mind told him that  absolute silence was the most necessary thing. As he lay, he could have  picked off Tandakora with a bullet from his rifle, and, so far as the  border was concerned, he felt that his own life was worth the  sacrifice, but he loved his life and the Ojibway might be put out of  the way at some other time and place.
  Tayoga's Tododaho protected him once more. Two of the Indians wanted  water and they started in search of a brook which was never far away in  that region. It seemed for a moment or two that they would walk  directly into the dip, where scattered ashes lay, but the great  Onondaga turned them aside just in time and they found at another point  the water they wished. Robert's extreme tension lasted until they were  back with the others. Nevertheless their harmless return encouraged him  in the belief that the star was working in his behalf.
  The Indians were in no hurry. They talked freely over their task of  dressing and quartering the deer, and often they were so near that  Robert could hear distinctly what they said, but only once or twice did  they use a dialect that he could understand, and then they were  speaking of the great victory of Oswego, in which they confirmed the  inference, drawn from the spoils, that they like Tandakora had taken a  part. They were in high good humor, expecting more triumphs, and  regarded the new French commander, Montcalm, as a great and invincible  leader.
  Robert was glad, then, that he was such an insignificant mote in the  wilderness and had he the power he would have made himself so small  that he would have become invisible, but as that was impossible he  still trusted in Tayoga's Tododaho. The Indian chief gave two of the  warriors an order, and they started on a course that would have brought  them straight to him. The lad gave himself up for lost, but, intending  to make a desperate fight for it, despite his weakness, his hand crept  to the hammer and trigger of his rifle. Something moved in the thicket,  a bear, perhaps, or a lynx, and the two Indians, when they were within  twenty feet of him, turned aside to investigate it. Then they went on,  and it was quite clear again to Robert that he had been right about the  friendly intervention of Tododaho.
  Nor was it long until the truth was demonstrated to him once more,  and in a conclusive manner. The entire party departed, taking with them  the portions of the deer, and they passed so very close to him that  their wary eyes, which always watched on all sides, would have been  compelled to see him, if Tododaho, or perhaps it was Areskoui, or even  Manitou, had not seen fit just at that moment to draw a veil before the  moon and stars and make the shadow so deep under the bush where young  Lennox lay that he was invisible, although they stepped within fifteen  feet of him. They went on in their usual single file, disappearing in  the direction of the village, while he lay still and gave thanks.
  They had not been gone more than fifteen minutes when there was a  faint rustle in the thicket, and Tayoga stood before him.
  &#8220;I was hid in a clump of weeds not far away and I saw,&#8221; said the  Onondaga. &#8220;It was a narrow escape, but you were protected by the great  powers of the earth and the air. Else they would have seen you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so,&#8221; said Robert, devoutly, &#8220;and it makes me all the more  glad to see you, Tayoga. I hope your journey, like all the others, has  been fruitful.&#8221;
  The Onondaga smiled in the dusk.
  &#8220;It is a good village to which I go,&#8221; he replied in his precise  fashion. &#8220;You will recall that they had in Albany what they call in the  English tongue a chemist's shop. It is such that I sought in the  village, and I found it in one lodge, the owners of which were absent,  and which I could reach at my leisure. Here is a gourd of Indian tea,  very strong, made from the essence of the sassafras root. It will purge  the impurities from your blood, and, in another day, your appetite will  be exceedingly strong. Then your strength will grow so fast that in a  short time you will be ready for a long journey. I have also brought a  small sack filled with samp.&#8221;
  Robert uttered a little cry of joy. He craved bread, or at least  something that would take its place, and samp, a variation of which is  known as hominy, was a most acceptable substitute.
  &#8220;You are, in truth, a most efficient burglar, Tayoga,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I obtained also information,&#8221; continued the Onondaga. &#8220;While I lay  in one of the lodges, hidden under furs, I heard two of the old men  talking. They believe since they have taken Oswego that all things are  possible for them and the French. Montcalm appears to them the greatest  of all leaders and he will take them from one victory to another. Their  defeat by Andiatarocte is forgotten, and they plan a great advance  toward the south. But they intend first to sweep up all the scouts and  bands of the Americans and English. Their first attack will be upon  Rogers, him whom we call the Mountain Wolf.&#8221;
  &#8220;Rogers! Is he somewhere near us?&#8221; exclaimed Robert eagerly.
  &#8220;Far to the east toward Andiatarocte, but they mean to strike him.  The Frenchmen De Courcelles and Jumonville will join with Tandakora,  then St. Luc will go too and he will lead a great force against the  Mountain Wolf, with whom, I suspect, our friend the Great Bear now is,  hoping perhaps, as they hunt through the forest, to discover some  traces of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;I knew all along, Tayoga, that Dave would seek me and rescue me if  you didn't, or if I didn't rescue myself, provided I remained alive, as  you see I did.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Great Bear is the most faithful of all comrades. He would never  desert a friend in the hands of the enemy.&#8221;
  &#8220;You think then that we should try to meet the Mountain Wolf and his  rangers?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of a certainty. As soon as Dagaeoga is strong enough. Now lie  still, while I scout through the forest. If no enemy is near I will  heat the tea, and then you must drink, and drink deep.&#8221;
  He made a wide circuit, and, coming back, lighted a little fire on  which he warmed the tea in the pot that he had taken from the village  on an earlier night. Then, under the insistence of Tayoga, Robert drank  a quantity that amounted to three cups, and soon fell into a deep  sleep, from which he awoke the next day with an appetite so sharp that  he felt able to bite a big piece out of a tree.
  &#8220;I think I'll go hunt a buffalo, kill him and eat him whole,&#8221; he  said in a large, round voice.
  &#8220;If so Dagaeoga will have to roam far,&#8221; said Tayoga sedately. &#8220;The  buffalo is not found east of the Alleghanies, as you well know.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course I know it, but what are time and distance to a Samson  like me? I say I will go forth and slay a buffalo, unless I am fed at  once and in enormous quantities.&#8221;
  &#8220;Would a haunch of venison and a gallon of samp help Dagaeoga a  little?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, a little, they'd serve as appetizers for something real and  substantial to come.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then if you feel so strong and are charged so full of ambition you  can help cook breakfast. You have had an easy time, Dagaeoga, but life  henceforth will not be all eating and sleeping.&#8221;
  They had a big and pleasant breakfast together and Robert rejoiced  in his new vigor. It was wonderful to be so strong after having been so  weak, it was like life after death, and he was eager to start at once.
  &#8220;It is a good thing to have been ill,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because then you  know how fine it is to be well.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we will not depart before tomorrow,&#8221; said the Onondaga  decisively.
  &#8220;And why?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because you have lived long enough in the wilderness, Dagaeoga, to  know that one must always fight the weather. Look into the west, and  you will see a little cloud moving up from the horizon. It does not  amount to much at present, but it contains the seed of great things. It  has been sent by the Rain God, and it will not do yet for Dagaeoga,  despite his new strength, to travel in the rain.&#8221;
  Robert became anxious as he watched the little cloud, which seemed  to swell as he looked at it, and which soon assumed an angry hue. He  knew that Tayoga had told the truth. Coming out of his fever it would  be a terrible risk for him to become drenched.
  &#8220;We will make a shelter such as we can in the dip where we built the  fire,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and now you can use your new strength as much as  you will in wielding a tomahawk.&#8221;
  They cut small saplings with utmost speed and speedily accomplished  one of the most difficult tasks of the border, making a rude brush  shelter which with the aid of their blankets would protect them from  the storm. By the time they had finished, the little cloud which had  been at first a mere signal had grown so prodigiously that it covered  the whole heavens, and the day became almost as dark as twilight. The  lightning began to flash in great, blazing strokes, and the thunder was  so nearly continuous that the earth kept up an incessant jarring. Then  the rain poured heavily and Robert saw Tayoga's wisdom. Although the  shelter and his blanket kept the rain from him he felt cold in the  damp, and shivered as if with a chill.
  &#8220;When the storm stops, which will not be before dark,&#8221; said Tayoga,  &#8220;I shall go to the village and get you a heavy buffalo robe. They have  some, acquired in trade from the Indians of the western plains, and one  of them belongs to you. So, Dagaeoga, I will get it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, you have taken too much risk for me already. I can make out  very well as I am, and suppose we start tonight in search of Rogers and  Willet.&#8221;
  &#8220;I mean to have my way, because in this case my way is right. We  work together as partners, and the partnership becomes ineffective when  one member of it cannot endure the hardships of a long march, and  perhaps of battle. And has not Dagaeoga said that I am an accomplished  burglar? I prove it anew tonight. As soon as the rain ceases I will go  to the village, the great storehouse of our supplies.&#8221;
  The Onondaga spoke in a light tone with a whimsical inflection, but  Robert saw that he was intensely in earnest, and that it was not worth  while for him to say more. The great storm passed on to the southward,  the rain sank to a drizzle, but it was very cold in the forest, and  Robert's teeth chattered, despite every effort to control his body.
  &#8220;I go, Dagaeoga,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and I shall return with the great,  warm buffalo robe that belongs to you.&#8221;
  Then he melted without noise into the darkness and Robert was alone.  He knew the mission of the Onondaga to be a perilous one, but he did  not doubt his success. The cold drizzle fell on the shelter of brush  and saplings, and some of it seeped through. Now and then a drop found  its way down his neck, and it felt like ice. Physically he was very  miserable, and it began to depress his spirit. He hoped that Tayoga  would not be long in obtaining the buffalo robe.
  The thunder moaned a little far to the south, and then died down  entirely. There were one or two stray flashes of lightning and then no  more. He sank into a sort of doze that was more like a stupor, from  which he was awakened by a dusky figure in the doorway of the little  shelter. It was Tayoga, and he bore a heavy dark bundle over his arm.
  &#8220;I have brought the buffalo robe that belongs to you, Dagaeoga,&#8221; he  said cheerfully. &#8220;It was in the lodge of the head chief of the village  and I had to wait until he went forth to greet Tandakora, who came with  a band of his warriors to claim shelter, food and rest. Then I took  what was your own and here it is, one of the finest I have ever seen.&#8221;
  He held up the great buffalo robe, tanned splendidly and rich in fur  and the sight of it made Robert's teeth stop chattering. He wrapped it  around his body and sufficient warmth came back.
  &#8220;You're a marvel, Tayoga,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Does the village contain  anything else that belongs to us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing that I can think of now. The rain will cease entirely in an  hour, and then we will start.&#8221;
  His prediction was right, and they set forth in the dark forest,  Robert wearing the great buffalo robe which stored heat and consequent  energy in his frame. But the woods were so wet, and it was so difficult  to find a good trail that they did not make very great progress, and  when dawn came they were only a few miles away. Robert's strength,  however, stood the test, and they dared to light a fire and have a warm  breakfast. Much refreshed they plunged on anew, hunting for friends who  could not be much more than motes in the wilderness. Robert hoped that  some chance would enable him to meet Willet, to whom he owed so much,  and who stood in the place of a father to him. It did not seem possible  that the Great Bear could have fallen in one of the numerous border  skirmishes, which must have been fought since his capture. He could not  associate death with a man so powerful and vital as Willet.
  The day was bright and warm, and he took off the buffalo robe. It  was quite a weight to be carried, but he knew he would need it again  when night came and particularly if there were other storms. They saw  many trails in the afternoon and Tayoga was quite sure they were made  by war bands. Nearly all of them led southeast.
  &#8220;The savages in the west and about the Great Lakes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have  heard of the victory at Oswego, and so they pour out to the French  standard, expecting many scalps and great spoils. Whenever the French  win a triumph it means more warriors for them.&#8221;
  &#8220;And may not some of the bands going to the war stumble on our own  trail?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is likely, Dagaeoga. But if it comes to battle see how much  better it is that you should be strong and able.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I concede now, Tayoga, that it was right for us to wait as  long as we did.&#8221;
  The trails grew much more numerous as they advanced. Evidently  swarms of warriors were about them and before midday Tayoga halted.
  &#8220;It will not be wise for us to advance farther,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must  seek some hiding place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Hark to that!&#8221; exclaimed Robert.
  A breeze behind them bore a faint shout to his ear. Tayoga listened  intently, and it was repeated once.
  &#8220;Pursuit!&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;They have come by chance upon our  trail. It may be Tandakora himself and it is unfortunate. They will  never leave us now, unless they are driven back.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'd better turn back towards the north, as the thickest of  the swarms are sure to be to the south of us.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so. Again the longest of roads becomes the safest for us, but  we will not make it wholly north, we will bear to the east also. I once  left a canoe, hidden in the edge of a lake there, and we may find it.&#8221;
  &#8220;What will we do with it if we find it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Tandakora will not be able to follow the trail of a canoe. But now  we must press forward with all speed, Dagaeoga. See, there is a smoke  in the south and now another answers it in the north. They are talking  about us.&#8221;
  Robert saw the familiar signals which always meant peril to them,  and he was willing to go forward at the uttermost speed. He had become  hardened in a measure to danger, though it seemed to him that he was  passing through enough of it to last a lifetime. But his soul rose to  meet it.
  They used all the customary devices to hide their traces, wading  when there was water, walking on stones or logs when they were  available, but they knew these stratagems would only delay Tandakora,  they could not throw him off the trail entirely. They hoped more from  the coming dark, and, when night came, it found them going at great  speed. Just at twilight they heard a faint shout again and the faint  shout in reply, telling them the pursuit was maintained, but the night  fortunately proved to be very dark, and, an hour or two later, they  came to a heavy windrow, the result of some old hurricane into which  they drew for shelter and rest. They knew that not even the Indian  trailers could find them there in such darkness, and for the present  they were without apprehension.
  &#8220;Do you think they will pass us in the night?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;No,&#8221; replied Tayoga. &#8220;They will wait until the dawn and pick up the  trail anew.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'd better start again about midnight.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think so, too.&#8221;
  Meanwhile, lying comfortably among the fallen trees and leaves, they  waited in silence.
