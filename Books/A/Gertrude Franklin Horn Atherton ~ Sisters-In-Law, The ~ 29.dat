This complete new freedom, and personal privacy, entailed in time a result  which Alexina would have been the last to anticipate even if she had  disposed of her husband by death or divorce.    
Owing to the thoroughness of her mental methods she was psychologically  free, the legal tie mattered as little as if Mortimer had been transposed  by some beneficent law to the status of a brother. The will when it is  strong enough can control acts, and, when favored by bias, thought; but it  has no command whatever over the sub-consciousness, and in that mysterious  region are the subtle inheritances of mind and character, the springs and  the direction, of all functional life; a fate with a thousand threads on  her wheel, filaments from the souls and the bodies, the minds and the  acts, of every ancestor straight back to that vast impersonal ocean where,  unthinkable millions of years ago proemial life awaited the call of the  worlds.    
This aged untiring fate at the wheel battles unceasingly with the conscious  mind above, for age is prone to live by law and rote. These fates, the  oldest daughters of the Earth-Mother, Nature, know nothing of morals or  manners, assume that men and women are as naive in their normality as the  denizens of forest and field. And so they are while children.    
<b>II</b>    
The eternal pull between civilizing Mind (Oh, centuries yet from being  civilized!) and the memoried but obstinate old lady at the wheel (who  laughs when a man of powerful will and too active mind "wills" sleep;  forcing him finally to choose between the horrors of insomnia, the  insidious tyranny of drugs, and the doubtful and wearisome alternative of  psychotherapeutics)--this pull, automatic in people of low estate, becomes  bitter and often appalling where the mind is highly developed and attuned  besides to the codes and customs of the best that civilization has so far  accomplished.    
The most vital of all these functions, for without it Mother Earth would be  like an ant hill without ants, and all these ancient norms of daughters  as homeless as the rest of the fates, is what man in a spirit of social  compromise has labeled an instinct--the sex-instinct. It is no more  an instinct than recurring sleep, lymphatic action, hunger, thirst,  alimentation. It is a primal function for which Mind, wisely foreseeing the  consequences of too much Nature, long since created laws both civil and  social to curb. There are many impulses, Inherited, from ten thousand  ancestors and constantly jogged by Earth's busy agent, human nature, that  may logically be called instincts (their roots lying in the ancient social  groups and their struggle to exist) but not a function that governs the  law of reproduction, as appetite governs the law of renewing the vital  necessities of the body.    
<b>III</b>    
In the Latin races the conscious war between the brain above and the  sub-ego below, with the latter's constant reminders that mind is a mere  excrescence, often warped or ill-directed, at the apex of the perfect body,  is almost negligible. Even, when moral their lack of reticence, their  practical logic, their habit of facing every fact pertaining to life,  psychical and physical, as squarely as they face a simple question of  hunger and thirst, above all their almost complete lack of that modern,  development, called romance, which has given birth to a peculiar form of  personal imagination, too often without foundation or logic--all these  preclude that most active of all mental aids to the matter of fact needs of  the body--glamour.    
But it is far otherwise with the English-speaking races--loosely called  Anglo-Saxon, They are powerfully sexed; their feelings and sentiments go  deeper than is possible to those of more ebullient temperament but fatal  clarity of vision; refinement of mind and habit and manner is perhaps the  most precious of their achievements, and they have established a code which  not only demands rectitude of act but suppression of thought and desire  where there is no lawful outlet.    
Nothing, possibly, has more infuriated the old lady at the methodically  performing wheel than this. She takes her revenge and squirts poison into  the physical structure of the brain, obscures the soul with dark and  brooding clouds, and subtly reduces the blood system to such a state that  any germ is welcome.    
<b>IV</b>    
Once more Mind uses its highest faculties and outwits her, having no  intention that civilization shall drop below the plane to which it has been  raised through long laborious centuries of time. Life becomes more diverse,  more complex. The middle classes work harder to live; they have little  leisure for thoughts, for introspection. Punishment is dire....Those that  have leisure and yet not enough to command the more brilliant and special  forms of distraction are supplied with public libraries, gymnasiums, free  medical advice regarding the laws of hygiene in places where they cannot  fail to see it, new forms of cheap amusement; they are subtly encouraged to  take up useful work or study; or there are increasing pressures which may  force even this semi-leisure class to work for luxuries if not for bread.  Tens of thousands of women are led into the passionate diversions of club  life. For them, too, politics with its fierce championships and hatreds  and frictions; the necessity of concentration of thought on the impersonal  plane if only in the matter of getting the best of rivals within the fold;  and if hair flies souls are saved.    
Over the Oldest Profession Mind still scratches its head in vain. It is  ever hopeful, and hamstrings a sovereign patron, like alcohol, now and  again; but the lady at the wheel smiles, for here, in addition to the  unquenchable maternal instinct, the ignorance of the poor, and the glamour  that the men of certain races have learned to give to love, she has her  clearest field.    
Aside from the women of commerce there are, of course, many secret  rebels--now and then only does one make her exit from society through the  courts. The vast majority of Anglo-Saxons in whatever clime or capital,  suppress their "unrefined" appetites or vagrant fancies--which are  vibrations from the wheel; sometimes hard jerks when the presiding genius  is more than commonly out of patience--and rise to serene heights or grow  morbid and irritable according to the strength or the meagerness of their  equipment; or the nature of their resources. A cultivated resource is a  persistent fiction that life is as it ought to be, not as it is, and it  is no plan of theirs to read books or witness plays that might carve and  populate a new groove in their brains.    
Let no one imagine that this class will become more "enlightened,"  "broader," as time goes on. Not for a century at least. Mind has made too  great a success of this product; she has practically achieved a complete  triumph over the lady at the wheel. It is this class that has made  civilization progress, the solid thing it is to date. The excrescences, the  deserters from the normal, scintillating or subtle, may be tolerated for  the spice they give to life but they will never rule,    
Possibly they do not mind. Life Is made up of compromises and  compensations.

American women in youth, of the visibly reputable world, may be freely  divided into two classes, the oversexed and those that seem cold to  themselves and others until they are well into the period of their second  youth--between twenty-four and thirty; and a not inconsiderable number are  so and permanently. In the first case they either precipitate themselves  into matrimony or have one or more intrigues until they find the man they  wish to marry, when they settle down and make excellent wives. The others,  if they are imaginative and high-minded, fall in love romantically and  marry far too soon; or they capitalize their youth or beauty and marry to  the best advantage; or they elect to live a life of serene spinsterhood  like Alexina's Aunt Clara, and bring up the family children. A not  inconsiderable number take their fling late.    
When the American girl of the super-refined class, and whose baleful norm  in the crypt was asleep at the wheel in her first blind youth, finds  herself disappointed in the most intimate partnership that exists, the  complaisance, voluntary at the beginning, drifts into habit, more and more  grimly endured. Some have the moral courage to put an end to it as they  would to any false situation, but if individuals were not rare in this  world we should have chaos, not a civilization of sorts which is a pleasant  place to plant the feet, however high into the clouds the head may poke its  investigating nose.    
It is natural that with such women during the period of endurance all love  should seem distasteful, and the mind dwell upon any other subject. But  remove the cause of sex-inertia and there is likely to be the stir and  awakening of spring after a long monotonous winter of hard frost and  blanketing snow. Or a homelier simile: remove the cause of chronic  indigestion and the appetite becomes fresh and normal.    
Thus Alexina.
