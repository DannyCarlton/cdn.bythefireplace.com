  &#8220;Get into the chaise, Mr. Fairfax,&#8221; said Colonel Preston.
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the adventurer, and accepted the invitation.
  &#8220;Now we are off,&#8221; said the colonel, as he took the reins, and  touched the horse lightly with the whip.
  &#8220;Is the road a pleasant one?&#8221; inquired Fairfax.
  &#8220;The latter part is rather lonely. For a mile it runs through the  woods&#8212;still, on a summer day, that is rather pleasant than otherwise.  In the evening, it is not so agreeable.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; said Fairfax, rather absently.
  Colonel Preston would have been startled could he have read the  thoughts that were passing through the mind of his companion. Could he  have known his sinister designs, he would scarcely have sat at his  side, chatting so easily and indifferently.
  &#8220;I will postpone my plan till we get to that part of the road he  speaks of,&#8221; thought Fairfax. &#8220;It would not do for me to be  interrupted.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose it is quite safe traveling anywhere on the road,&#8221;  remarked the adventurer.
  &#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Colonel Preston, with a laugh. &#8220;Thieves and highway  robbers do not pay us the compliment of visiting our neighborhood. They  keep in the large cities, or in places that will better reward their  efforts.&#8221;
  &#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said Fairfax; &#8220;I am glad to hear it, for I carry a  considerable amount of money about me.&#8221;
  &#8220;So do I, to-day. This is the day for payment of mill dividends, and  as I have occasion to use the money, I did not deposit it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good,&#8221; said Fairfax, to himself. &#8220;That is what I wanted to find  out.&#8221;
  Aloud he said:
  &#8220;Oh, well, there are two of us, so it would be a bold highwayman  that would venture to attack us. Do you carry a pistol?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not I,&#8221; said Colonel Preston. &#8220;I don't like the idea of carrying  firearms about with me. They might go off by mistake. I was reading in  a daily paper, recently, of a case where a man accidentally shot his  son with the pistol he was in the habit of carrying about with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;There is that disadvantage, to be sure,&#8221; said Fairfax. &#8220;So, he has  no pistol. He is quite in my power,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It's a good  thing to know.&#8221;
  &#8220;By the way,&#8221; he asked, merely to keep up the conversation, &#8220;are you  a family man, Colonel Preston?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir; I have a wife, and a son of fifteen.&#8221;
  &#8220;You have the advantage of me in that respect. I have always been  devoted to business, and have had no time for matrimony.&#8221;
  &#8220;Time enough yet, Mr. Fairfax.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, I suppose so.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you are going to settle down in our neighborhood, I can  introduce you to some of our marriageable young ladies,&#8221; said Colonel  Preston, pleasantly.
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Fairfax; in the same tone. &#8220;I may avail myself of  your offer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't you take supper at my home this evening?&#8221; said the colonel,  hospitably. &#8220;I shall be glad to introduce Mrs. Preston. My son is at  boarding school, so I shall not be able to let you see him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you but one child, then?&#8221;
  &#8220;But one. His absence leaves us alone.&#8221;
  Godfrey's absence would have been lamented more by his father, had  his character and disposition been different. But he was so arrogant  and overbearing in his manners, and so selfish, that his father hoped  that association with other boys would cure him in part of these  objectionable traits. At home, he was so much indulged by his mother,  who could see no fault in him, as long as he did not oppose her, that  there was little chance of amendment.
  So they rode on, conversing on various topics, but their  conversation was not of sufficient importance for me to report. At  length they entered on a portion of the road lined on either side by a  natural forest. Fairfax looked about him.
  &#8220;I suppose, Colonel Preston, these are the woods you referred to?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;How far do they extend?&#8221;
  &#8220;About a mile.&#8221;
  They had traversed about half a mile, when Fairfax said:
  &#8220;If you don't object, Colonel Preston, I will step out a moment.  There's a tree with a peculiar leaf. I would like to examine it nearer  to.&#8221;
  &#8220;Certainly, Mr. Fairfax,&#8221; said the colonel, though he wondered what  tree it could be, for he saw no tree of an unusual character.
  The chaise stopped and Fairfax jumped off. But he seemed to have  forgotten the object of dismounting. Instead of examining the foliage  of a tree, he stepped to the horse's head, and seized him by the  bridle.
  &#8220;What are you going to do, Mr. Fairfax?&#8221; asked Colonel Preston, in  surprise.
  By this time Fairfax had withdrawn a pistol from his inside pocket,  and deliberately pointed it at his companion.
  &#8220;Good heavens! Mr. Fairfax, what do you mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston,&#8221; said the adventurer, &#8220;I want all the money you  have about you. I know you have a considerable sum, for you have  yourself acknowledged it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why,&#8221; exclaimed Colonel Preston, startled, &#8220;this is highway  robbery.&#8221;
  &#8220;Precisely!&#8221; said Fairfax, bowing mockingly. &#8220;You have had the honor  of riding with a highwayman. Will you be good enough to give me the  money at once? I am in haste.&#8221;
  &#8220;Surely, this is a joke, Mr. Fairfax. I have heard of such practical  jokes before. You are testing my courage. I am not in the least  frightened. Jump in the chaise again, and we will proceed.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a very kind way of putting it,&#8221; said Fairfax, coolly; &#8220;but  not correct. I am no counterfeit, but the genuine article. Fairfax is  not my name. I won't tell you what it is, for it might be  inconvenient.&#8221;
  No man can look with equanimity upon the prospect of losing money,  and Colonel Preston may be excused for not wishing to part with his  eight hundred dollars. But how could he escape? He had no pistol, and  Fairfax held the horse's bridle in a strong grasp. If he could only  parley with him till some carriage should come up, he might save his  money. It seemed the only way, and he resolved to try it.
  &#8220;Mr. Fairfax,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you are really what you represent, I  hope you will consider the natural end of such a career. Turn, I  entreat you, to a more honest course of life.&#8221;
  &#8220;That may come some time,&#8221; said Fairfax; &#8220;but at present my  necessities are too great. Oblige me by producing your pocketbook.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will give you one hundred dollars, and keep the matter a secret  from all. That will be better than to expose yourself to the penalty of  the law.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston, a hundred dollars will not satisfy me. You have  eight hundred dollars with you, and I shall not leave this spot till it  is transferred to my possession.&#8221;
  &#8220;If I refuse?&#8221;
  &#8220;You will subject me to the unpleasant alternative of blowing your  brains out,&#8221; said the other, coolly.
  &#8220;You surely would not be guilty of such a crime, Mr. Fairfax?&#8221; said  Colonel Preston, with a shudder.
  &#8220;I would rather not. I have no desire to take your life, but I must  have that money. If you prefer to keep your money, you will compel me  to the act. You'll gain nothing, for in that case I shall take  both&#8212;your life first, and your money afterward.&#8221;
  &#8220;And this is the man with whom I dined, and with whom, a few moments  since, I was conversing freely!&#8221; thought Colonel Preston.
  The adventurer became impatient.
  &#8220;Colonel Preston,&#8221; he said, abruptly, &#8220;produce that money instantly,  or I will fire.&#8221;
  There was no alternative. With reluctant hand the colonel drew out  his pocketbook, and was about to hand it with its contents to the  highwayman, when there was a sudden crash in the bushes behind Fairfax,  his pistol was dashed from his hand, and our young hero, Andy Burke,  with resolute face, stood with his gun leveled at him. All happened so  quickly that both Colonel Preston and Fairfax were taken by surprise,  and the latter, still retaining his hold upon the bridle, stared at the  young hero, who had so intrepidly come between him and his intended  victim.
  With an oath he stopped, and was about to pick up the pistol which  had fallen from his hands, but was arrested by the quick, decisive  tones of Andy:
  &#8220;Let that pistol alone! If you pick it up, I will shoot you on the  spot.&#8221;
