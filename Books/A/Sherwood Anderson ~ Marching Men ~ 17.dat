When McGregor was admitted to the bar and ready to take his place  among the thousands of young lawyers scattered over the Chicago loop  district he half drew back from beginning the practice of his  profession. To spend his life quibbling over trifles with other  lawyers was not what he wanted. To have his place in life fixed by his  ability in quibbling seemed to him hideous.    
Night after night he walked alone in the streets thinking of the  matter. He grew angry and swore. Sometimes he was so stirred by the  meaninglessness of whatever way of life offered itself that he was  tempted to leave the city and become a tramp, one of the hordes of  adventurous dissatisfied souls who spend their lives drifting back and  forth along the American railroads.    
He continued to work in the South State Street restaurant that got its  patronage from the underworld. In the evenings from six until twelve  trade was quiet and he sat reading books and watching the restless  thrashing crowds that passed the window. Sometimes he became so  absorbed that one of the guests sidled past and escaped through the  door without paying his bill. In State Street the people moved up and  down nervously, wandering here and there, going without purpose like  cattle confined in a corral. Women in cheap imitations of the gowns  worn by their sisters two blocks away in Michigan Avenue and with  painted faces leered at the men. In gaudily lighted store-rooms that  housed cheap suggestive shows pianos kept up a constant din.    
In the eyes of the people who idled away the evenings in South State  Street was the vacant purposeless stare of modern life accentuated and  made horrible. With the stare went the shuffling walk, the wagging  jaw, the saying of words meaning nothing. On the wall of a building  opposite the door of the restaurant hung a banner marked "Socialist  Headquarters." There where modern life had found well-nigh perfect  expression, where there was no discipline and no order, where men did  not move, but drifted like sticks on a sea-washed beach, hung the  socialist banner with its promise of the co-operative commonwealth.    
McGregor looked at the banner and at the moving people and was lost in  meditation. Walking from behind the cashier's desk he stood in the  street by the door and stared about. A fire began to burn in his eyes  and the fists that were thrust into his coat pockets were clenched.  Again as when he was a boy in Coal Creek he hated the people. The fine  love of mankind that had its basis in a dream of mankind galvanised by  some great passion into order and meaning was lost.    
In the restaurant after midnight trade briskened Waiters and  bartenders from fashionable restaurants of the loop district began to  drop in to meet friends from among the women of the town. When a woman  came in she walked up to one of these young men. "What kind of a night  have you had?" they asked each other.    
The visiting waiters stood about and talked in low tones. As they  talked they absentmindedly practised the art of withholding money from  customers, a source of income to them. They played with coins, pitched  them into the air, palmed them, made them appear and disappear with  marvellous rapidity. Some of them sat on stools along the counter  eating pie and drinking cups of hot coffee.    
A cook clad in a long dirty apron came into the room from the kitchen  and putting a dish on the counter stood eating its contents. He tried  to win the admiration of the idlers by boasting. In a blustering voice  he called familiarly to women seated at tables along the wall. At some  time in his life the cook had worked for a travelling circus and he  talked continually of his adventures on the road, striving to make  himself a hero in the eyes of his audience.    
McGregor read the book that lay before him on the counter and tried to  forget the squalid disorder of his surroundings. Again he read of the  great figures of history, the soldiers and statesmen who have been  leaders of men. When the cook asked him a question or made some remark  intended for his ears he looked up, nodded and read again. When a  disturbance started in the room he growled out a command and the  disturbance subsided. From time to time well dressed middle-aged men,  half gone in drink, came and leaned over the counter to whisper to  him. He made a motion with his hand to one of the women sitting at the  tables along the wall and idly playing with toothpicks. When she came  to him he pointed to the man and said, "He wants to buy you a dinner."    
The women of the underworld sat at the tables and talked of McGregor,  each secretly wishing he might become her lover. They gossiped like  suburban wives, filling their talk with vague reference to things he  had said. They commented upon his clothes and his reading. When he  looked at them they smiled and stirred uneasily about like timid  children.    
One of the women of the underworld, a thin woman with hollow red  cheeks, sat at a table talking with the other women of the raising of  white leghorn chickens. She and her husband, a fat old roan, a waiter  in a loop restaurant, had bought a ten-acre farm in the country and  she was helping to pay for it with the money made in the streets in  the evening. A small black-eyed woman who sat beside the chicken  raiser reached up to a raincoat hanging on the wall and taking a piece  of white cloth from the pocket began to work out a design in pale blue  flowers for the front of a shirtwaist. A youth with unhealthy looking  skin sat on a stool by the counter talking to a waiter.    
"The reformers have raised hell with business," the youth boasted as  he looked about to be sure of listeners. "I used to have four women  working for me here in State Street in World's Fair year and now I  have only one and she crying and sick half the time."    
McGregor stopped reading the book. "In every city there is a vice  spot, a place from which diseases go out to poison the people. The  best legislative brains in the world have made no progress against  this evil," it said.    
He closed the book, threw it away from him and looked at his big fist  lying on the counter and at the youth talking boastfully to the  waiter. A smile played about the corners of his mouth. He opened and  closed his fist reflectively. Then taking a law book from a shelf  below the counter he began reading again, moving his lips and resting  his head upon his hands.    
McGregor's law office was upstairs over a secondhand clothing store in  Van Buren Street. There he sat at his desk reading and waiting and at  night he returned to the State Street restaurant. Now and then he went  to the Harrison Street police station to hear a police court trial and  through the influence of O'Toole was occasionally given a case that  netted him a few dollars. He tried to think that the years spent in  Chicago were years of training. In his own mind he knew what he wanted  to do but did not know how to begin. Instinctively he waited. He saw  the march and countermarch of events in the lives of the people  tramping on the sidewalks below his office window, saw in his mind the  miners of the Pennsylvania village coming down from the hills to  disappear below the ground, looked at the girls hurrying through the  swinging doors of department stores in the early morning, wondering  which of them would presently sit idling with toothpicks in O'Toole's  and waited for the word or the stir on the surface of that sea of  humanity that would be a sign to him. To an onlooker he might have  seemed but another of the wasted men of modern life, a drifter on the  sea of things--but it was not so. The people plunging through the  streets afire with earnestness concerning nothing had not succeeded in  sucking him into the whirlpool of commercialism in which they  struggled and into which year after year the best of America's youth  was drawn.    
The idea that had come into his mind as he sat on the hill above the  mining town grew and grew. Day and night he dreamed of the actual  physical phenomena of the men of labour marching their way into power  and of the thunder of a million feet rocking the world and driving the  great song of order purpose and discipline into the soul of Americans.    
Sometimes it seemed to him that the dream would never be more than a  dream. In the dusty little office he sat and tears came into his eyes.  At such times he was convinced that mankind would go on forever along  the old road, that youth would continue always to grow into manhood,  become fat, decay and die with the great swing and rhythm of life a  meaningless mystery to them. "They will see the seasons and the  planets marching through space but they will not march," he muttered,  and went to stand by the window and stare down into the dirt and  disorder of the street below.
