  If John Aldous had betrayed no visible sign of inward vanquishment  he at least was feeling its effect. For years his writings had made him  the target for a world of women, and many men. The men he had regarded  with indifferent toleration. The women were his life&#8212;the &#8220;frail and  ineffective creatures&#8221; who gave spice to his great adventure, and made  his days anything but monotonous. He was not unchivalrous. Deep down in  his heart&#8212;and this was his own secret&#8212;he did not even despise women.  But he had seen their weaknesses and their frailties as perhaps no  other man had ever seen them, and he had written of them as no other  man had ever written. This had brought him the condemnation of the  host, the admiration of the few. His own personal veneer of antagonism  against woman was purely artificial, and yet only a few had guessed it.  He had built it up about him as a sort of protection. He called himself  &#8220;an adventurer in the mysteries of feminism,&#8221; and to be this  successfully he had argued that he must destroy in himself the usual  heart-emotions of the sex-man and the animal.
  How far he had succeeded in this he himself did not know&#8212;until  these last moments when he had bid good-bye to Joanne Gray. He  confessed that she had found a cleft in his armour, and there was an  uneasy thrill in his blood. It was not her beauty alone that had  affected him. He had trained himself to look at a beautiful woman as he  might have looked at a beautiful flower, confident that if he went  beyond the mere admiration of it he would find only burned-out ashes.  But in her he had seen something that was more than beauty, something  that for a flashing moment had set stirring every molecule in his  being. He had felt the desire to rest his hand upon her shining hair!
  He turned off into a winding path that led into the thick poplars,  restraining an inclination to look back in the direction of the Otto  camp. He pulled out the pipe he had dropped into his shirt pocket,  filled it with fresh tobacco, and began smoking. As he smoked, his lips  wore a quizzical smile, for he was honest enough to give Joanne Gray  credit for her triumph. She had awakened a new kind of interest in  him&#8212;only a passing interest, to be sure&#8212;but a new kind for all that.  The fact amused him. In a large way he was a humourist&#8212;few guessing  it, and he fully appreciated the humour of the present situation&#8212;that  he, John Aldous, touted the world over as a woman-hater, wanted to peer  out through the poplar foliage and see that wonderful gold-brown head  shining in the sun once more!
  He wandered more slowly on his way, wondering with fresh interest  what his friends, the women, would say when they read his new book. His  title for it was &#8220;Mothers.&#8221; It was to be a tremendous surprise.
  Suddenly his face became serious. He faced the sound of a distant  phonograph. It was not the phonograph in Quade's place, but that of a  rival dealer in soft drinks at the end of the &#8220;street.&#8221; For a moment  Aldous hesitated. Then he turned in the direction of the camp.
  Quade was bolstered up on a stool, his back against the thin  partition, when John Aldous sauntered in. There was still a groggy look  in his mottled face. His thick bulk hung a bit limply. In his  heavy-lidded eyes, under-hung by watery pouches of sin and dissipation,  there was a vengeful and beastlike glare. He was surrounded by his  friends. One of them was taking a wet cloth from his head. There were a  dozen in the canvas-walled room, all with their backs to the door,  their eyes upon their fallen and dishonoured chief. For a moment John  Aldous paused in the door. The cool and insolent smile hovered about  his lips again, and little crinkles had gathered at the corners of his  eyes.
  &#8220;Did I hit you pretty hard, Bill?&#8221; he asked.
  Every head was turned toward him. Bill Quade stared, his mouth open.  He staggered to his feet, and stood dizzily.
  &#8220;You&#8212;damn you!&#8221; he cried huskily.
  Three or four of the men had already begun to move toward the  stranger. Their hands were knotted, their faces murderously dark.
  &#8220;Wait a minute, boys,&#8221; warned Aldous coolly. &#8220;I've got something to  say to you&#8212;and Bill. Then eat me alive if you want to. Do you want to  be square enough to give me a word?&#8221;
  Quade had settled back sickly on his stool. The others had stopped,  waiting. The quiet and insolently confident smile had not left Aldous'  lips.
  &#8220;You'll feel better in a few minutes, Bill,&#8221; he consoled. &#8220;A hard  blow on the jaw always makes you sick at the pit of the stomach. That  dizziness will pass away shortly. Meanwhile, I'm going to give you and  your pals a little verbal and visual demonstration of what you're up  against, and warn you to bait no traps for a certain young woman whom  you've lately seen. She's going on to Tete Jaune. And I know how your  partner plays his game up there. I'm not particularly anxious to butt  into your affairs and the business of this pretty bunch that's gathered  about you, but I've come to give you a friendly warning for all that.  If this young woman is embarrassed up at Tete Jaune you're going to  settle with me.&#8221;
  Aldous had spoken without a tremor of excitement in his voice. Not  one of the men noticed his speaking lips, his slim hands, or his  careless posture as he leaned in the door. They were looking straight  into his eyes, strangely scintillating and deadly earnest. In such a  man mere bulk did not count.
  &#8220;That much&#8212;for words,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Now I'm going to give you the  visual demonstration. I know your game, Bill. You're already planning  what you're going to do. You won't fight fair&#8212;because you never have.  You've already decided that some morning I'll turn up missing, or be  dug out from under a fall of rock, or go peacefully floating down the  Athabasca. See! There's nothing in that hand, is there?&#8221;
  He stretched out an empty hand toward them, palm up.
  &#8220;And now!&#8221;
  A twist of the wrist so swift their eyes could not follow, a  metallic click, and the startled group were staring into the black  muzzle of a menacing little automatic.
  &#8220;That's known as the sleeve trick, boys,&#8221; explained Aldous with his  imperturbable smile. &#8220;It's a relic of the old gun-fighting days when  the best man was quickest. From now on, especially at night, I shall  carry this little friend of mine just inside my wristband. There are  eleven shots in it, and I shoot fairly straight. Good-day!&#8221;
  Before they had recovered from their astonishment he was gone.
  He did not follow the road along which Joanne had come a short time  before, but turned again into the winding trail that led riverward  through the poplars. Where before he had been a little amused at  himself, he was now more seriously disgusted. He was not afraid of  Quade, who was perhaps the most dangerous man along the line of rail.  Neither was he afraid of the lawless men who worked his ends. But he  knew that he had made powerful enemies, and all because of an unknown  woman whom he had never seen until half an hour before. It was this  that disturbed his equanimity&#8212;the<I> woman</I> of it, and the  knowledge that his interference had been unsolicited and probably  unnecessary. And now that he had gone this far he found it not easy to  recover his balance. Who was this Joanne Gray? he asked himself. She  was not ordinary&#8212;like the hundred other women who had gone on ahead of  her to Tete Jaune Cache. If she had been that, he would soon have been  in his little shack on the shore of the river, hard at work. He had  planned work for himself that afternoon, and he was nettled to discover  that his enthusiasm for the grand finale of a certain situation in his  novel was gone. Yet for this he did not blame her. He was the fool.  Quade and his friends would make him feel that sooner or later.
  His trail led him to a partly dry muskeg bottom. Beyond this was a  thicker growth of timber, mostly spruce and cedar, from behind which  came the rushing sound of water. A few moments more and he stood with  the wide tumult of the Athabasca at his feet. He had chosen this spot  for his little cabin because the river ran wild here among the rocks,  and because pack-outfits going into the southward mountains could not  disturb him by fording at this point. Across the river rose the steep  embankments that shut in Buffalo Prairie, and still beyond that the  mountains, thick with timber rising billow on billow until trees looked  like twigs, with gray rock and glistening snow shouldering the clouds  above the last purple line. The cabin in which he had lived and worked  for many weeks faced the river and the distant Saw Tooth Range, and was  partly hidden in a clump of jack-pines. He opened the door and entered.  Through the window to the south and west he could see the white face of  Mount Geikie, and forty miles away in that wilderness of peaks, the  sombre frown of Hardesty; through it the sun came now, flooding his  work as he had left it. The last page of manuscript on which he had  been working was in his typewriter. He sat down to begin where he had  left off in that pivotal situation in his masterpiece.
  He read and re-read the last two or three pages of the manuscript,  struggling to pick up the threads where he had dropped them. With each  reading he became more convinced that his work for that afternoon was  spoiled. And by whom? By<I> what?</I> A little fiercely he packed his  pipe with fresh tobacco. Then he leaned back, lighted it, and laughed.  More and more as the minutes passed he permitted himself to think of  the strange young woman whose beauty and personality had literally  projected themselves into his workshop. He marvelled at the crudity of  the questions which he asked himself, and yet he persisted in asking  them. Who was she? What could be her mission at Tete Jaune Cache? She  had repeated to him what she had said to the girl in the coach&#8212;that at  Tete Jaune she had no friends. Beyond that, and her name, she had  offered no enlightenment.
  In the brief space that he had been with her he had mentally  tabulated her age as twenty-eight&#8212;no older. Her beauty alone, the  purity of her eyes, the freshness of her lips, and the slender  girlishness of her figure, might have made him say twenty, but with  those things he had found the maturer poise of the woman. It had been a  flashlight picture, but one that he was sure of.
  Several times during the next hour he turned to his work, and at  last gave up his efforts entirely. From a peg in the wall he took down  a little rifle. He had found it convenient to do much of his own  cooking, and he had broken a few laws. The partridges were out of  season, but temptingly fat and tender. With a brace of young broilers  in mind for supper, he left the cabin and followed the narrow  foot-trail up the river. He hunted for half an hour before he stirred a  covey of birds. Two of these he shot. Concealing his meat and his gun  near the trail he continued toward the ford half a mile farther up,  wondering if Stevens, who was due to cross that day, had got his outfit  over. Not until then did he look at his watch. He was surprised to find  that the Tete Jaune train had been gone three quarters of an hour. For  some unaccountable reason he felt easier. He went on, whistling.
  At the ford he found Stevens standing close to the river's edge,  twisting one of his long red moustaches in doubt and vexation.
  &#8220;Damn this river,&#8221; he growled, as Aldous came up. &#8220;You never can  tell what it's going to do overnight. Look there! Would you try to  cross?&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't,&#8221; replied Aldous. &#8220;It's a foot higher than yesterday. I  wouldn't take the chance.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not with two guides, a cook, and a horse-wrangler on your  pay-roll&#8212;and a hospital bill as big as Geikie staring you in the  face?&#8221; argued Stevens, who had been sick for three months. &#8220;I guess  you'd pretty near take a chance. I've a notion to.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't,&#8221; repeated Aldous.
  &#8220;But I've lost two days already, and I'm taking that bunch of  sightseers out for a lump sum, guaranteeing 'em so many days on the  trail. This ain't what you might call<I> on the trail</I>. They don't  expect to pay for this delay, and that outfit back in the bush is  costing me thirty dollars a day. We can get the dunnage and ourselves  over in the flat-boat. It'll make our arms crack&#8212;but we can do it.  I've got twenty-seven horses. I've a notion to chase 'em in. The river  won't be any lower to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you may be a few horses ahead.&#8221;
  Stevens bit off a chunk of tobacco and sat down. For a few moments  he looked at the muddy flood with an ugly eye. Then he chuckled, and  grinned.
  &#8220;Came through the camp half an hour ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hear you cleaned  up on Bill Quade.&#8221;
  &#8220;A bit,&#8221; said Aldous.
  Stevens rolled his quid and spat into the water slushing at his  feet.
  &#8220;Guess I saw the woman when she got off the train,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;She  dropped something. I picked it up, but she was so darned pretty as she  stood there looking about I didn't dare go up an' give it to her. If it  had been worth anything I'd screwed up my courage. But it wasn't&#8212;so I  just gawped like the others. It was a piece of paper. Mebby you'd like  it as a souvenir, seein' as you laid out Quade for her.&#8221;
  As he spoke, Stevens fished a crumpled bit of paper from his pocket  and gave it to his companion. Aldous had sat down beside him. He  smoothed the page out on his knee. There was no writing on it, but it  was crowded thick with figures, as if the maker of the numerals had  been doing some problem in mathematics. The chief thing that interested  him was that wherever monetary symbols were used it was the &#8220;pound&#8221; and  not the &#8220;dollar&#8221; sign. The totals of certain columns were rather  startling.
  &#8220;Guess she's a millionaire if that's her own money she's been  figgering,&#8221; said Stevens. &#8220;Notice that figger there!&#8221; He pointed with a  stubby forefinger. &#8220;Pretty near a billion, ain't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Seven hundred and fifty thousand,&#8221; said Aldous.
  He was thinking of the &#8220;pound&#8221; sign. She had not looked like the  Englishwomen he had met. He folded the slip of paper and put it in his  pocket.
  Stevens eyed him seriously.
  &#8220;I was coming over to give you a bit of advice before I left for the  Maligne Lake country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You'd better move. Quade won't want  you around after this. Besides&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221;
  &#8220;My kid heard something,&#8221; continued the packer, edging nearer. &#8220;You  was mighty good to the kid when I was down an' out, Aldous. I ought to  tell you. It wasn't an hour ago the kid was behind the tent an' he  heard Quade and Slim Barker talking. So far as I can find from the kid,  Quade has gone nutty over her. He's ravin'. He told Slim that he'd give  ten thousand dollars to get her in his hands. What sent the boy down to  me was Quade tellin' Slim that he'd get<I> you</I> first. He told Slim  to go on to Tete Jaune&#8212;follow the girl!&#8221;
  &#8220;The deuce you say!&#8221; cried Aldous, clutching the other's arm  suddenly. &#8220;He's done that?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's what the kid says.&#8221;
  Aldous rose to his feet slowly. The careless smile was playing about  his mouth again. A few men had learned that in those moments John  Aldous was dangerous.
  &#8220;The kid is undoubtedly right,&#8221; he said, looking down at Stevens.  &#8220;But I am quite sure the young woman is capable of taking care of  herself. Quade has a tremendous amount of nerve, setting Slim to follow  her, hasn't he? Slim may run up against a husband or a brother.&#8221;
  Stevens haunched his shoulders.
  &#8220;It's not the woman I'm thinking about. It's you. I'd sure change my  location.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why wouldn't it be just as well if I told the police of his  threat?&#8221; asked Aldous, looking across the river with a glimmer of  humour in his eyes.
  &#8220;Oh, hell!&#8221; was the packer's rejoinder.
  Slowly he unwound his long legs and rose to his feet.
  &#8220;Take my advice&#8212;move!&#8221; he said. &#8220;As for me, I'm going to cross that  cussed river this afternoon or know the reason why.&#8221;
  He stalked away in the direction of his outfit, chewing viciously at  his quid. For a few moments Aldous stood undecided. He would liked to  have joined the half-dozen men he saw lounging restfully a distance  beyond the grazing ponies. But Stevens had made him acutely aware of a  new danger. He was thinking of his cabin&#8212;and the priceless achievement  of his last months of work, his manuscript. If Quade should destroy  that&#8212;&#8212;
  He clenched his hands and walked swiftly toward his camp. To &#8220;burn  out&#8221; an enemy was one of Quade's favourite methods of retaliation. He  had heard this. He also knew that Quade's work was done so cleverly  that the police had been unable to call him to account.
  Quade's status had interested Aldous from the beginning. He had  discovered that Quade and Culver Rann, his partner at Tete Jaune, were  forces to be reckoned with even by the &#8220;powers&#8221; along the line of rail.  They were the two chiefs of the &#8220;underground,&#8221; the men who controlled  the most dangerous element from Miette to Fort George. He had once seen  Culver Rann, a quiet, keen-eyed, immaculately groomed man of forty&#8212;the  cleverest scoundrel that had ever drifted into the Canadian west. He  had been told that Rann was really the brain of the combination, and  that the two had picked up a quarter of a million in various ways. But  it was Quade with whom he had to deal now, and he began to thank  Stevens for his warning. He was filled with a sense of relief when he  reached his cabin and found it as he had left it. He always made a  carbon copy of his work. This copy he now put into a waterproof tin  box, and the box he concealed under a log a short distance back in the  bush.
  &#8220;Now go ahead, Quade,&#8221; he laughed to himself, a curious, almost  exultant ring in his voice. &#8220;I haven't had any real excitement for so  long I can't remember, and if you start the fun there's going to<I> be</I>  fun!&#8221;
  He returned to his birds, perched himself behind a bush at the  river's edge, and began skinning them. He had almost finished when he  heard hoarse shouts from up the river. From his position he could see  the stream a hundred yards below the ford. Stevens had driven in his  horses. He could see them breasting the first sweep of the current,  their heads held high, struggling for the opposite shore. He rose,  dropped his birds, and stared.
  &#8220;Good God, what a fool!&#8221; he gasped.
  He saw the tragedy almost before it had begun. Still three hundred  yards below the swimming horses was the gravelly bar which they must  reach on the opposite side. He noted the grayish strip of smooth water  that marked the end of the dead-line. Three or four of the stronger  animals were forging steadily toward this. The others grouped close  together, almost motionless in their last tremendous fight, were left  farther and farther behind. Then came the break. A mare and her  yearling colt had gone in with the bunch. Aldous saw the colt, with its  small head and shoulders high out of the water, sweep down like a chip  with the current. A cold chill ran through him as he heard the  whinneying scream of the mother&#8212;a warning cry that held for him the  pathos and the despair of a creature that was human. He knew what it  meant. &#8220;Wait&#8212;I'm coming&#8212;I'm coming!&#8221; was in that cry. He saw the mare  give up and follow resistlessly with the deadly current, her eyes upon  her colt. The heads behind her wavered, then turned, and in another  moment the herd was sweeping down to its destruction.
  Aldous felt like turning his head. But the spectacle fascinated him,  and he looked. He did not think of Stevens and his loss as the first of  the herd plunged in among the rocks. He stood with white face and  clenched hands, leaning over the water boiling at his feet, cursing  softly in his helplessness. To him came the last terrible cries of the  perishing animals. He saw head after head go under. Out of the white  spume of a great rock against which the flood split itself with the  force of an avalanche he saw one horse pitched bodily, as if thrown  from a huge catapault. The last animal had disappeared when chance  turned his eyes upstream and close in to shore. Here flowed a steady  current free of rock, and down this&#8212;head and shoulders still high out  of the water&#8212;came the colt! What miracle had saved the little fellow  thus far Aldous did not stop to ask. Fifty yards below it would meet  the fate of the others. Half that distance in the direction of the  maelstrom below was the dead trunk of a fallen spruce overhanging the  water for fifteen or twenty feet. In a flash Aldous was racing toward  it. He climbed out on it, leaned far over, and reached down. His hand  touched the water. In the grim excitement of rescue he forgot his own  peril. There was one chance in twenty that the colt would come within  his reach, and it did. He made a single lunge and caught it by the ear.  For a moment after that his heart turned sick. Under the added strain  the dead spruce sagged down with a warning crack. But it held, and  Aldous hung to his grip on the ear. Foot by foot he wormed his way  back, until at last he had dragged the little animal ashore.
  And then a voice spoke behind him, a voice that he would have  recognized among ten thousand, low, sweet, thrilling.
  &#8220;That was splendid, John Aldous!&#8221; it said. &#8220;If I were a man I would  want to be a man like you!&#8221;
  He turned. A few steps from him stood Joanne Gray. Her face was as  white as the bit of lace at her throat. Her lips were colourless, and  her bosom rose and fell swiftly. He knew that she, too, had witnessed  the tragedy. And the eyes that looked at him were glorious.
