  It was a long time after O'Connor had gone before Kent at last   fell asleep. It was a slumber weighted with the restlessness of a   brain fighting to the last against exhaustion and the inevitable  end.  A strange spirit seemed whirling Kent back through the years  he had  lived, even to the days of his boyhood, leaping from crest  to crest,  giving to him swift and passing visions of valleys  almost forgotten,  of happenings and things long ago faded and  indistinct in his memory.  Vividly his dreams were filled with  ghosts&#8212;ghosts that were  transformed, as his spirit went back to  them, until they were riotous  with life and pulsating with the red  blood of reality. He was a boy  again, playing three-old-cat in  front of the little old red brick  schoolhouse half a mile from the  farm where he was born, and where his  mother had died. 
  And Skinny Hill, dead many years ago, was his partner at the bat&#8212;   lovable Skinny, with his smirking grin and his breath that always   smelled of the most delicious onions ever raised in Ohio. And  then,  at dinner hour, he was trading some of his mother's cucumber  pickles  for some of Skinny's onions&#8212;two onions for a pickle, and  never a  change in the price. And he played old-fashioned casino  with his  mother, and they were picking blackberries together in  the woods, and  he killed over again a snake that he had clubbed to  death more than  twenty years ago, while his mother ran away and  screamed and then sat  down and cried. 
  He had worshiped that mother, and the spirit of his dreams did not   let him look down into the valley where she lay dead, under a  little  white stone in the country cemetery a thousand miles away,  with his  father close beside her. But it gave him a passing thrill  of the days  in which he had fought his way through college&#8212;and  then it brought  him into the North, his beloved North. 
  For hours the wilderness was heavy about Kent. He moved   restlessly, at times he seemed about to awaken, but always he  slipped  back into the slumberous arms of his forests. He was on  the trail in  the cold, gray beginning of Winter, and the glow of  his campfire made  a radiant patch of red glory in the heart of the  night, and close to  him in that glow sat O'Connor. He was behind  dogs and sledge, fighting  storm; dark and mysterious streams  rippled under his canoe; he was on  the Big River, O'Connor with  him again&#8212;and then, suddenly, he was  holding a blazing gun in his  hand, and he and O'Connor stood with  their backs to a rack, facing  the bloodthirsty rage of McCaw and his  free-traders. The roar of  the guns half roused him, and after that  came pleasanter things&#8212;  the droning of wind in the spruce tops, the  singing of swollen  streams in Springtime, the songs of birds, the  sweet smells of  life, the glory of life as he had lived it, he and  O'Connor. In  the end, half between sleep and wakefulness, he was  fighting a  smothering pressure on his chest. It was an oppressive and   torturing thing, like the tree that had fallen on him over in the   Jackfish country, and he felt himself slipping off into darkness.   Suddenly there was a gleam of light. He opened his eyes. The sun  was  flooding in at his window, and the weight on his chest was the  gentle  pressure of Cardigan's stethoscope. 
  In spite of the physical stress of the phantoms which his mind has   conceived, Kent awakened so quietly that Cardigan was not  conscious  of the fact until he raised his head. There was  something in his face  which he tried to conceal, but Kent caught  it before it was gone.  There were dark hollows under his eyes. He  was a bit haggard, as  though he had spent a sleepless night. Kent  pulled himself up,  squinting at the sun and grinning  apologetically. He had slept well  along into the day, and&#8212; 
  He caught himself with a sudden grimace of pain. A flash of   something hot and burning swept through his chest. It was like a   knife. He opened his mouth to breathe in the air. The pressure  inside  him was no longer the pressure of a stethoscope. It was  real. 
  Cardigan, standing over him, was trying to look cheerful. &quot;Too   much of the night air, Kent,&quot; he explained. &quot;That will pass away&#8212;   soon.&quot; 
  It seemed to Kent that Cardigan gave an almost imperceptible   emphasis to the word &quot;soon,&quot; but he asked no question. He was  quite  sure that he understood, and he knew how unpleasant for  Cardigan the  answer to it would be. He fumbled under his pillow  for his watch. It  was nine o'clock. Cardigan was moving about  uneasily, arranging the  things on the table and adjusting the  shade at the window. For a few  moments, with his back to Kent, he  stood without moving. Then he  turned, and said: 
  &quot;Which will you have, Kent&#8212;a wash-up and breakfast, or a   visitor?&quot; 
  &quot;I am not hungry, and I don't feel like soap and water just now.   Who's the visitor? Father Layonne or&#8212;Kedsty?&quot; 
  &quot;Neither. It's a lady.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I'd better have the soap and water! Do you mind telling me   who it is?&quot; 
  Cardigan shook his head. &quot;I don't know. I've never seen her   before. She came this morning while I was still in pajamas, and  has  been waiting ever since. I told her to come back again, but  she  insisted that she would remain until you were awake. She has  been very  patient for two hours.&quot; 
  A thrill which he made no effort to conceal leaped through Kent.   &quot;Is she a young woman?&quot; he demanded eagerly. &quot;Wonderful black  hair,  blue eyes, wears high-heeled shoes just about half as big as  your  hand&#8212;and very beautiful?&quot; 
  &quot;All of that,&quot; nodded Cardigan. &quot;I even noticed the shoes, Jimmy.   A very beautiful young woman!&quot; 
  &quot;Please let her come in,&quot; said Kent. &quot;Mercer scrubbed me last   night, and I feel fairly fit. She'll forgive this beard, and I'll   apologize for your sake. What is her name?&quot; 
  &quot;I asked her, and she didn't seem to hear. A little later Mercer   asked her, and he said she just looked at him for a moment and he   froze. She is reading a volume of my Plutarch's 'Lives'&#8212;actually   reading it. I know it by the way she turns the pages!&quot; 
  Kent drew himself up higher against his pillows and faced the door   when Cardigan went out. In a flash all that O'Connor had said  swept  back upon him&#8212;this girl, Kedsty, the mystery of it all. Why  had she  come to see him? What could be the motive of her visit&#8212;  unless it was  to thank him for the confession that had given Sandy  McTrigger his  freedom? O'Connor was right. She was deeply  concerned in McTrigger and  had come to express her gratitude. He  listened. Distant footsteps  sounded in the hall. They approached  quickly and paused outside his  door. A hand moved the latch, but  for a moment the door did not open.  He heard Cardigan's voice,  then Cardigan's footsteps retreating down  the hall. His heart  thumped. He could not remember when he had been so  upset over an  unimportant thing.
