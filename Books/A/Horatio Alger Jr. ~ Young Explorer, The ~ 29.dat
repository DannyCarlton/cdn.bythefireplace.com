    Though Dewey had received from the miners a promise that they would   not interfere with Ki Sing in case he gained a victory over  O'Reilly,  he was not willing to trust entirely to it. He feared that  some one  would take it into his head to play a trick on the  unoffending  Chinaman, and that the others unthinkingly would join  in. Accordingly,  he thought it best to keep the Mongolian under his  personal charge as  long as he remained in camp. 
  Ki Sing followed him to his tent as a child follows a guardian. 
  &quot;Are you hungry, Ki Sing?&quot; asked Dewey. 
  &quot;Plenty hungly.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I will first satisfy your appetite,&quot; and Dewey brought forth   some of his stock of provisions, to which Ki Sing did ample justice,   though neither rat pie nor rice was included. 
  When the lunch, in which Richard Dewey joined, was over, he said:   &quot;If you will help me for the rest of the day, I will pay you  whatever  I consider your services to be worth.&quot; 
  &quot;All lightee!&quot; responded Ki Sing, with alacrity. 
  Whatever objections may be made to the Chinaman, he cannot be   charged with laziness. As a class they are willing to labor   faithfully, even where the compensation is small. Labor in China,   which is densely peopled, is a matter of general and imperative   necessity, and has been so for centuries, and habit has probably had   a good deal to do with the national spirit of industry. 
  Ki Sing, under Richard Dewey's directions, worked hard, and richly   earned the two dollars which his employer gave him at the end of the   day. 
  Of course Dewey's action did not escape the attention of his fellow   miners. It cannot be said that they regarded it with favor. The one   most offended was naturally O'Reilly, who, despite the pounding he   had received, was about the camp as usual. 
  &quot;Boys,&quot; he said, &quot;are you goin' to have that haythen workin'   alongside you?&quot; 
  &quot;It won't do us any harm, will it?&quot; asked Dick Roberts. &quot;If Dewey   chooses to hire him, what is it to us?&quot; 
  &quot;I ain't goin' to demane myself by workin' wid a yeller haythen.&quot; 
  &quot;Nobody has asked you to do it. If anybody is demeaning himself it   is Dick Dewey, and he has a right to if he wants to.&quot; 
  &quot;If he wants to hire anybody, let him hire a dacent Christian.&quot; 
  &quot;Like you, O'Reilly?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't want to work for anybody. I work for myself. This Chinaman   has come here to take the bread out of our mouths, bad cess to him.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see that. He is workin' Dick Dewey's claim. I don't see  how  that interferes with us.&quot; 
  Of course, this was the reasonable view of the matter; but there   were some who sided with the Irishman, among others the Kentuckian,   and he volunteered to go as a committee of one to Dewey, and   represent to him the sentiments of the camp. 
  Accordingly he walked over to where Dewey and his apprentice were   working. 
  &quot;Look here, Dewey,&quot; he began, &quot;me and some of the rest of the boys   have takin' over this yere matter of your givin' work to this   Chinaman, and we don't like it.&quot; 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; asked Dewey coolly. 
  &quot;We don't feel no call to associate with sich as he.&quot; 
  &quot;You needn't; I don't ask you to,&quot; said Dewey quietly. &quot;I am the   only one who associates with him.&quot; 
  &quot;But we don't want him in camp.&quot; 
  &quot;He won't trouble any of you. I will take charge of him.&quot; 
  &quot;Look here, Dewey, you've got to respect public sentiment, and   public sentiment is agin' this thing.&quot; 
  &quot;Whose public sentiment&#8212;O'Reilly's?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, O'Reilly don't like it, for one.&quot; 
  &quot;I thought so.&quot; 
  &quot;Nor I for another.&quot; 
  &quot;It strikes me, Hodgson, that I've got some rights as well as   O'Reilly. Suppose I should say I didn't choose to work in the same   camp with an Irishman?&quot; 
  &quot;That's different.&quot; 
  &quot;Why is it different?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, you see, an Irishman isn't a yeller heathen.&quot; 
  Dewey laughed. 
  &quot;He may be a heathen, though not a yellow one,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Well, Dewey, what answer shall I take back to the boys?&quot; 
  &quot;You can say that I never intended to employ the Chinaman for any   length of time; but I shall not send him off till I get ready.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm afraid the boys won't like it, Dewey.&quot; 
  &quot;Probably O'Reilly won't. As for you, you are too intelligent a man   to be influenced by such a man as he.&quot; 
  All men are sensible to flattery, and Hodgson was won over by this   politic speech. 
  &quot;I won't say you're altogether wrong, Dewey,&quot; he said; &quot;but I   wouldn't keep him too long.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't mean to.&quot; 
  Hodgson returning reported that Dewey would soon dismiss the   Chinaman, and omitted the independent tone which the latter had   assumed. The message was considered conciliatory, and pronounced   satisfactory; but O'Reilly was not appeased. He still murmured, but   his words produced little effect. Seeing this, he devised a private   scheme of annoyance.
