Hamilton was now free to devote himself to the practice of law, with but  an occasional interruption. It hardly need be stated that he kept a  sharp eye on Jefferson, but for the sake of the country he supported him  when he could do so consistently with his principles. More than once the  President found in him an invaluable ally; and as often, perhaps, he  writhed as on a hot gridiron. Hamilton came forth in the pamphlet upon  extreme occasions only, but he was still the first political philosopher  and writer of his time, and the Federalists would have demanded his pen  upon these occasions had he been disposed to retire it. Although out of  the active field of politics, he kept the best of the demoralized  Federalists together, warning them constantly that the day might come  when they would be called upon to reorganize a disintegrated union, and  responding to the demands of his followers in Congress for advice. In  local politics he continued to make himself felt in spite of the  fattening ranks of Democracy. His most powerful instrument was the <i>New  York Evening Post</i>, which he founded for the purpose of keeping the  Federalist cause alive, and holding the enemy in check. He selected an  able man as editor, William Coleman of Massachusetts, but he directed  the policy of the paper, dictating many of the editorials in the late  hours of night. This journal took its position at once as the most  respectable and brilliant in the country.    
He also founded the Society for the Manumission of Slaves, securing as  honorary member the name of Lafayette--now a nobleman at large once  more. But all these duties weighed lightly. For the first time in his  life he felt himself at liberty to devote himself almost wholly to his  practice, and it was not long before he was making fifteen thousand  dollars a year. It was an immense income to make in that time, and he  could have doubled it had he been less erratic in the matter of fees.  Upon one occasion he was sent eight thousand dollars for winning a suit,  and returned seven. He invariably placed his own valuation upon a case,  and frequently refused large fees that would have been paid with  gratitude. If a case interested him and the man who asked his services  were poorer than himself, he would accept nothing. If he were convinced  that a man was in the wrong, he would not take his case at any price. He  was delighted to be able to shower benefits upon his little family, and  he would have ceased to be Alexander Hamilton had he been content to  occupy a second place at the bar, or in any other pursuit which engaged  his faculties; but for money itself, he had only contempt. Perhaps that  is the reason why he is so out of tune with the present day, and unknown  to the average American.    
Washington, after the retirement of John Jay, had offered Hamilton the  office of Chief Justice of the United States; but Hamilton felt that  the bar was more suited to his activities than the bench, and declined  the gift. His legal career was as brilliant and successful as his  political, but although none is more familiar to ambitious lawyers, and  his position as the highest authority on constitutional law has never  been rivalled, his achievements of greater value to the Nation have  reduced it in history to the position of an incident. There is little  space left, and somewhat of his personal life still to tell, but no  story of Hamilton would be complete without at least a glimpse of this  particular shuttle in the tireless loom of his brain. Such glimpses have  by no one been so sharply given as by his great contemporary, Chancellor  Kent.    <blockquote>
 He never made any argument in court [Kent relates] without   displaying his habits of thinking, resorting at once to some   well-founded principle of law, and drawing his deductions logically   from his premises. Law was always treated by him as a science,   founded on established principles.... He rose at once to the   loftiest heights of professional eminence, by his profound   penetration, his power of analysis, the comprehensive grasp and   strength of his understanding, and the firmness, frankness and   integrity of his character.... His manners were affable, gentle and   kind; and he appeared to be frank, liberal and courteous in all his   professional intercourse. [Referring to a particular case the   Chancellor continues.] Hamilton by means of his fine melodious   voice, and dignified deportment, his reasoning powers and   persuasive address, soared far above all competition. His   preeminence was at once and universally conceded.... Hamilton   returned to private life and to the practice of the law in '95. He   was cordially welcomed and cheered on his return, by his fellow   citizens. Between this year and 1798, he took his station as the   leading counsel at the bar. He was employed in every important and   every commercial case. He was a very great favourite with the   merchants of New York and he most justly deserved to be, for he had   shown himself to be one of the most enlightened, intrepid and   persevering friends to the commercial prosperity of this country.   Insurance questions, both upon the law and fact, constituted a   large portion of the litigated business in the courts, and much of   the intense study and discussion at the bar. Hamilton had an   overwhelming share of this business.... His mighty mind would at   times bear down all opposition by its comprehensive grasp and the   strength of his reasoning powers. He taught us all how to probe   deeply into the hidden recesses of the science, and to follow up   principles to their far distant sources. He ransacked cases and   precedents to their very foundations; and we learned from him to   carry our inquiries into the commercial codes of the nations of the   European continent; and in a special manner to illustrate the law   of Insurance by the secure judgement of Emerigon and the luminous   commentaries of Valin.... My judicial station in 1798 brought   Hamilton before me in a new relation.... I was called to listen   with lively interest and high admiration to the rapid exercise of   his reasoning powers, the intensity and sagacity with which he   pursued his investigations, his piercing criticisms, his masterly   analysis, and the energy and fervour of his appeals to the   judgement and conscience of the tribunal which he addressed. [In   regard to the celebrated case of Croswell vs. the People, in the   course of which Hamilton reversed the law of libel, declaring the   British interpretation to be inconsistent with the genius of the   American people, Kent remarks.] I have always considered General   Hamilton's argument in this cause as the greatest forensic effort   he ever made. He had come prepared to discuss the points of law   with a perfect mastery of the subject. He believed that the rights   and liberties of the people were essentially concerned.... There   was an unusual solemnity and earnestness on his part in this   discussion. He was at times highly impassioned and pathetic. His   whole soul was enlisted in the cause, and in contending for the   rights of the Jury and a free Press, he considered that he was   establishing the surest refuge against oppression.... He never   before in my hearing made any effort in which he commanded higher   reverence for his principles, nor equal admiration of the power and   pathos of his eloquence.... I have very little doubt that if   General Hamilton had lived twenty years longer, he would have   rivalled Socrates or Bacon, or any other of the sages of ancient or   modern times, in researches after truth and in benevolence to   mankind. The active and profound statesman, the learned and   eloquent lawyer, would probably have disappeared in a great degree   before the character of the sage and philosopher, instructing   mankind by his wisdom, and elevating the country by his example.    
 [Ambrose Spencer, Attorney General of the State,--afterward Chief   Justice,--who did not love him, having received the benefit of   Hamilton's scathing sarcasm more than once, has this to say.]   Alexander Hamilton was the greatest man this country ever produced.   I knew him well. I was in situations to observe and study him. He   argued cases before me while I sat as judge on the bench. Webster   has done the same. In power of reasoning, Hamilton was the equal of   Webster; and more than this can be said of no man. In creative   power, Hamilton was infinitely Webster's superior, and in this   respect he was endowed as God endows the most gifted of our race.   If we call Shakspeare a genius or creator, because he evoked plays   and character from the great chaos of thought, Hamilton merits the   same appellation; for it was he, more than any other man, who   thought out the Constitution of the United States and the details   of the Government of the Union; and out of the chaos that existed   after the Revolution, raised a fabric, every part of which is   instinct with his thought. I can truly say that hundreds of   politicians and statesmen of the day get both the web and woof of   their thoughts from Hamilton's brains. He, more than any man, did   the thinking of the time.</blockquote>    
His fooling was as inimitable as his use of passion and logic, and on  one occasion he treated Gouverneur Morris, who was his opposing counsel,  to such a prolonged attack of raillery that his momentary rival sat with  the perspiration pouring from his brow, and was acid for some time  after. During his earlier years of practice, while listening to  Chancellor Livingston summing up a case in which eloquence was made to  disguise the poverty of the cause, Hamilton scribbled on the margin of  his brief: "Recipe for obtaining good title for ejectment: two or three  void patents, several <i>ex parte</i> surveys, one or two acts of usurpation  acquiesced in for the time but afterwards proved such. Mix well with  half a dozen scriptural allusions, some ghosts, fairies, elves,  hobgoblins, and a <i>quantum suff</i>. of eloquence." Hamilton also  originated the practice of preparing "Points," now in general use.
