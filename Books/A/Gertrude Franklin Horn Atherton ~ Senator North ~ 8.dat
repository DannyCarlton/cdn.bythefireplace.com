"How many politicians are coming this afternoon?" asked Mrs. Madison,  at the Sunday midday dinner. Her voice indicated that all protest had  not gone out of her.    
"Senator Burleigh and Mr. Montgomery--and Lady Mary. Not a formidable  array."    
"They are exactly two too many. I have written and asked Sally Carter  to come over and chaperon you in case I do not feel equal to the  ordeal at the last moment. I am surprised that she takes your course  so quietly, but on the whole am relieved; you need some one  respectable to keep you in countenance."    
"This house reeks with respectability; no one would ever notice the  absence of a chaperon. Sally is not only quiescent, but sympathetic.  She knows that I have got to the end of teas and charities, and she  believes in people choosing their own lives. She says she would join a  travelling circus if her proclivities happened to point that way."    
Mrs. Madison shuddered. "I do not pretend to understand the present  generation, and the more I hear of it the less I wish to. As for Sally  I love her, but I should detest her if I didn't, for she is the worst  form of snob: she is so rich and so well born that she thinks she can  dress like a servant-girl and affect the manners of a barmaid."  "Molly! So you were haunting 'pubs' when I supposed you were yawning  at home? I hope you did not tell the barmaids your real name."    
"Well, I suppose I should not criticise people that I know nothing  about," said Mrs. Madison, colouring and serious. She changed the  subject hastily. "Jack, I hope you will stay this afternoon. It would  be the greatest comfort to have you in the house."    
"I will stay, certainly," said Emory. He had taken his Sunday dinner  at the old house in I Street for almost a quarter of a century. To-day  he had been unusually silent, and had contracted his brows nervously  every time Betty looked at him. She understood perfectly, and amused  herself by turning round upon him several times with abrupt  significance. However, she spared him until they had taken Mrs.  Madison to the parlor and gone to the library, where he might smoke  his after-dinner cigar. He sat down in front of a window, and the  sunlight poured over him, glistening his handsome head and  illuminating his skin. Betty supposed that some women might fall quite  desperately in love with him; and in addition to his beauty he was a  noble and high-minded gentleman, whose narrowness was due to the  secluded life he chose to lead.    
"Now!" she exclaimed, "come out with it! You've had eleven days, and  one can learn a good deal in that time."    
He bit sharply at the end of his cigar, but answered without  hesitation.    
"It is almost impossible to learn anything in Washington to the  detriment of the Senate. There seems to be a sort of <i>esprit de corps</i>  in the entire city. They look politely horrified if you suggest that a  Senator of the United States, honouring Washington with the society of  his wives and daughters, is anything that he should not be. I was  obliged to go to New York and Boston to get the information I wanted,  and even now it is far from complete. I don't believe it is possible  to arrive at anything like accurate knowledge on the subject."    
"Well, what did you get? Washington is a well-ordered community with a  high moral tone--it is said to have fewer scandals than any city in  the country--and there is no sordid commercial atmosphere to lower it.  It is the great city of leisure in everything but legislation and  paying calls; so it seems to me that it would be the last place to  fondle in its bosom ninety distinguished scoundrels. But go on. What  did you learn in Boston and New York?"    
"That a little of everything is represented in the Senate,--that is  about what it amounts to. There are unquestionably men there who  bought their seats from legislatures, and there are men who are agents  for trusts, syndicates, and railroad corporations, as well as three  party bosses--"    
"Ninety Senators leave a large margin for a number of loose fish. What  I want to know is, how do the big men stand--North, Maxwell, Ward,  March--and fifteen or twenty others, all the men who are the Chairmen  of the big Committees? The New England men seem to have charge of  everything of importance in the House and of a good deal in the  Senate."    
"Some of the Southern and North-western and most of the New England  States seem to have honest enough legislatures," said Emory,  unwillingly. "But that leaves plenty of others. Only a few of the  Western States are above suspicion, and as for New York, Pennsylvania,  and Delaware, they would not waste time defending themselves; and as  no Senators are better than the people that elect them--"    
"Oh, yes, they are sometimes--look at the Senator from Delaware. I too  have been asking questions for eleven days. It all comes to this:  there are millionaireism and corrupting influences in the Senate, but  that element is in the minority, and the greater number of leading, or  able Senators are above suspicion. And they seem to have things pretty  much all their own way. They could not if the majority in the Senate  were scoundrels. No corrupt body was ever led by its irreproachable  exceptions--"    
"In another ten years there will be no exceptions. All that are making  a desperate stand for honesty to-day will be overwhelmed by the  unprincipled element--"    
"Or have forced it to reform. The good in human nature predominates;  we are a healthy infant, and do not know the meaning of the word  'decadent;' and we are extraordinarily clever. Senator Burleigh says  that you can always bank on the American people going right in the  end. They may not bother for a long time, but when they do wake up  they make things hum."    
"Senator Burleigh evidently has all the easy-going optimism of this  country. But, Betty, I am no more reconciled than I was before to your  having anything to do with these people. Politics have a bad name,  whatever the truth of the matter. I think myself our sensational press  is largely to blame--" "There is nothing so interesting as the pursuit  of truth," said Betty, lightly. "Reconcile yourself to the sight of me  in pursuit of it--"    
"Ah, here you are!" exclaimed a staccato voice. Sally Carter entered  the room, kissed Betty, shook hands heartily with Emory, and threw  herself into a chair. Her fortune equalled Betty's, but it was her  pleasure to wear frocks so old and so dowdy that her friends wondered  where they had come from originally. She had been a handsome girl, and  her blue eyes were still full of fire, her fair hair abundant, but her  face was sallow and lined from many attacks of malarial fever. Her  manner was breezy and full of energy, and she was not only popular but  a very important person indeed. She lived alone with her father in the  old house in K Street and entertained rarely, but she had strawberry  leaves on her coronet, and it was currently reported that when she  arrived in England, clad in a rusty black serge and battered turban,--  which she certainly slept in at intervals during the day,--she was met  in state by the entire ducal family--including a prolific connection--  whose ancestor had founded the great house of Carter in the British  colonies of North America. What their private opinion was of this  representative of the American dukedom was never quite clear to the  Washington mind, but to know Sally Carter in her own city meant  complete social recognition, and not to know her an indifferent  success.    
"Senator North tells me that he met you the other day and would like  to meet you again," she said to Betty, who lifted her head with  attention. "I dropped in on my way here for a little call on Mrs.  North, poor dear! There's a real invalid for you--something the matter  with her spine--is liable to paralysis any minute. It must be so  cheerful to sit round and anticipate that. Why on earth do women  let their nerves run away with them, in the first place? Nerves in  this country are a mixture of climate, selfishness, and stupidity. I  could be as nervous as a witch, but I won't. I walk miles every day  and don't think about myself. Well! I told Mr. North all about the  bold course of the young lady weary of frivolities, and he seemed much  interested, paid you some compliment or other, I've forgotten what. He  said he would look out for you in the Senate gallery and go up and  speak to you--"    
Emory rose with an exclamation of disgust. "I hope you told him to do  nothing of the kind."    
"On the contrary, I told him not to forget, for as Betty would sail  her little yacht on the political sea, I wanted her to be recognized  by the men-of-war, not by the trading-ships and pirates."    
Emory threw away his cigar. "I think I will go in and see my aunt," he  said. "All this is most distasteful to me."    
He left the room, followed by Betty's mocking laugh. But Miss Carter  said with a sigh,--    
"He can't expect us all to live up to his ideals. It is better not to  have any, like my practical self. But I'm afraid he sits out there in  his damp old library and dreams of a world in which all the men are  Sir Galahads and all the women Madame Rolands. He is an ideal himself,  if he only knew it; I've always been half in love with him. Well,  Betty, how do you like your new toy? After all, what is even a Senate  but a toy for a pretty woman? That is really your attitude, only you  don't know it. Life is serious only for women with babies and bills.  As for charities, they were specially invented to give old maids like  myself an occupation in life. What--what--should I have done without  charities when Society palled?"    
"Why did you never marry, Sally?" asked Betty, abruptly. The question  never had occurred to her before, but as she asked it her eyes  involuntarily moved to the empty chair before the window.    
"What on earth should I do with a husband?" asked Miss Carter,  lightly. "I only love men when they are in bronze in the public parks.  Poor dear old General Lathom proposed to me four times, and the only  time I felt like accepting him was when I saw his statue unveiled. I  couldn't put a man on a pedestal to save my life, but when my grateful  country does it I'm all humble adoration. Could you idealize a live  thing in striped trousers and a frock coat?"    
"Woolen is hopeless," said Betty, with an attempt at playfulness. "We  must do the best we can with the inner man."    
"How on earth do you know what a man is like on the inside? Idealize  is the right word, though. Women make a god out of what they cannot  understand in a man. If he has a bad temper, they think of him as a  'dominant personality.' If he is unfaithful to his wife, he is  romantic in the eyes of a woman who has given no man a chance to be  unfaithful to her. If he comes to your dinner with an attack of  dyspepsia, you compare him sentimentally with the brutes that eat.  <i>You</i> haven't married yet, I notice, and you are on the corner of  twenty-seven."    
"American men don't give you a chance to idealize them," said Betty,  plaintively. "They tell you all about themselves at once. And although  Englishmen have more mystery and provoke your curiosity, they don't  understand women and don't want to; the women can do the adapting. I  never could stand that; and as I can't endure foreigners I'm afraid I  shall die an old maid. That's the reason I've gone into politics--"    
The butler announced that Senator Burleigh was in the parlor.    
"What of his inner man?" asked Sally.    
"I never have given it two thoughts. But his outer is all that could  be desired."    
"He would look well in bronze. I understand that his State thinks a  lot of him: as you know, I read the <i>Post</i> and <i>Star</i> through every  day to papa. I <i>have</i> to know something of politics."    
They found Senator Burleigh talking to Mrs. Madison, apparently  oblivious of her frigid attempt at tolerance and of Emory's sullen  silence. Sally Carter's eyes flashed with amusement, and she shook the  Senator warmly by the hand.    
"Such a very great pleasure!" she announced in her staccato tones.  "Now the only time I really allow myself pride is when I meet the  statesmen of my country. I am sure that is the way you feel, dear  Cousin Molly--is it not? We are such oysters, the few of us who always  have lived here, that a whiff from the political world puts new life  into us."    
Emory left the room. Burleigh looked surprised but gratified, and  assured her that it was the greatest possible pleasure as well as an  honour to meet Miss Carter. He appeared to have left his businesslike  manner on Capitol Hill, and he was even less abrupt than on the night  of the dinner. Only his exuberant vitality seemed out of place in that  dark old room, and it was an effort for him to keep his sonorous voice  in check.    
"Mrs. Madison says she takes no interest in politics," he added, "and  fears to be a wet blanket on the conversation. I have been assuring  her that on one day of the week politics are non-existent so far as I  am concerned."    
Mrs. Madison, who had been staring at Sally Carter, replied with an  evident attempt to be agreeable, "Of course I always find it  interesting to hear people talk about what they understand best."  "Politics are what I should like to understand least. Since I have  come to the Senate I have endeavoured to forget all I ever knew about  them. I rely upon my friends to keep me in office while I am making a  desperate attempt to become a fair-minded legislator."    
He spoke lightly. Betty could not determine whether he was posing or  telling the simple truth to people who would be glad to take him at  his word. There was a twinkle of amusement in his eye; but he looked  too impatient for even the milder sort of hypocrisy.    
Mrs. Madison thawed visibly. "You younger men should try to restore  the old ideals," she said.    
"Ah, madam," he replied, "if you only knew what the censors said about  the old ideals when they were alive! If Time will be as kind to us, we  can swallow our own dose with a reasonable amount of philosophy. John  Quincy Adams arraigned the politics of his day in the bitterest  phrases he could create; but to-day we are asked to remember the  glorious past and hide our heads."    
The Montgomery's entered the room. Randolph, who was as tall as  Senator Burleigh and very slender, looked so distinguished that Mrs.  Madison immediately decided to remember only that his family was as  old as her own. He had lost none of the repose he had found during his  three years' residence in Europe, but the effort to keep it in the  House had made his handsome face thin and touched his mouth with  cynicism. His hair was still black, and there were no lines about his  cool gray eyes.    
"Blessed day of rest!" exclaimed his wife. "I got up just one hour  ago. Do you know, Miss Madison, I paid twenty-six calls on Thursday,  eighteen on Friday and twelve on Saturday? Never marry into political  life."    
Senator Burleigh, who had been talking to Miss Carter, turned round  quickly. "Some women are so manifestly made for it," he said, "that it  would be folly for them to attempt to escape their fate."
