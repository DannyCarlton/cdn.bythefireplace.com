   Captain Rifle, gray and old in the Alaskan Steamship service, had  not lost the spirit of his youth along with his years. Romance was not  dead in him, and the fire which is built up of clean adventure and the  association of strong men and a mighty country had not died out of his  veins. He could still see the picturesque, feel the thrill of the  unusual, and&#8212;at times&#8212;warm memories crowded upon him so closely that  yesterday seemed today, and Alaska was young again, thrilling the world  with her wild call to those who had courage to come and fight for her  treasures, and live&#8212;or die.
  Tonight, with the softly musical throb of his ship under his feet,  and the yellow moon climbing up from behind the ramparts of the Alaskan  mountains, something of loneliness seized upon him, and he said simply:
  &#8220;That is Alaska.&#8221;
  The girl standing beside him at the rail did not turn, nor for a  moment did she answer. He could see her profile clear-cut as a cameo in  the almost vivid light, and in that light her eyes were wide and filled  with a dusky fire, and her lips were parted a little, and her slim body  was tense as she looked at the wonder of the moon silhouetting the  cragged castles of the peaks, up where the soft, gray clouds lay like  shimmering draperies.
  Then she turned her face a little and nodded. &#8220;Yes, Alaska,&#8221; she  said, and the old captain fancied there was the slightest ripple of a  tremor in her voice. &#8220;Your Alaska, Captain Rifle.&#8221;
  Out of the clearness of the night came to them a distant sound like  the low moan of thunder. Twice before, Mary Standish had heard it, and  now she asked: &#8220;What was that? Surely it can not be a storm, with the  moon like that, and the stars so clear above!&#8221;
  &#8220;It is ice breaking from the glaciers and falling into the sea. We  are in the Wrangel Narrows, and very near the shore, Miss Standish. If  it were day you could hear the birds singing. This is what we call the  Inside Passage. I have always called it the water-wonderland of the  world, and yet, if you will observe, I must be mistaken&#8212;for we are  almost alone on this side of the ship. Is it not proof? If I were  right, the men and women in there&#8212;dancing, playing cards,  chattering&#8212;would be crowding this rail. Can you imagine humans like  that? But they can't see what I see, for I am a ridiculous old fool who  remembers things. Ah, do you catch that in the air, Miss Standish&#8212;the  perfume of flowers, of forests, of green things ashore? It is faint,  but I catch it.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so do I.&#8221;
  She breathed in deeply of the sweet air, and turned then, so that  she stood with her back to the rail, facing the flaming lights of the  ship.
  The mellow cadence of the music came to her, soft-stringed and  sleepy; she could hear the shuffle of dancing feet. Laughter rippled  with the rhythmic thrum of the ship, voices rose and fell beyond the  lighted windows, and as the old captain looked at her, there was  something in her face which he could not understand.
  She had come aboard strangely at Seattle, alone and almost at the  last minute&#8212;defying the necessity of making reservation where half a  thousand others had been turned away&#8212;and chance had brought her under  his eyes. In desperation she had appealed to him, and he had discovered  a strange terror under the forced calm of her appearance. Since then he  had fathered her with his attentions, watching closely with the wisdom  of years. And more than once he had observed that questing, defiant  poise of her head with which she was regarding the cabin windows now.
  She had told him she was twenty-three and on her way to meet  relatives in Nome. She had named certain people. And he had believed  her. It was impossible not to believe her, and he admired her pluck in  breaking all official regulations in coming aboard.
  In many ways she was companionable and sweet. Yet out of his  experience, he gathered the fact that she was under a tension. He knew  that in some way she was making a fight, but, influenced by the wisdom  of three and sixty years, he did not let her know he had guessed the  truth.
  He watched her closely now, without seeming to do so. She was very  pretty in a quiet and unusual way. There was something irresistibly  attractive about her, appealing to old memories which were painted  clearly in his heart. She was girlishly slim. He had observed that her  eyes were beautifully clear and gray in the sunlight, and her  exquisitely smooth dark hair, neatly coiled and luxuriant crown of  beauty, reminded him of puritanism in its simplicity. At times he  doubted that she was twenty-three. If she had said nineteen or twenty  he would have been better satisfied. She puzzled him and roused  speculation in him. But it was a part of his business to see many  things which others might not see&#8212;and hold his tongue.
  &#8220;We are not quite alone,&#8221; she was saying. &#8220;There are others,&#8221; and  she made a little gesture toward two figures farther up the rail.
  &#8220;Old Donald Hardwick, of Skagway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the other is Alan  Holt.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;
  She was facing the mountains again, her eyes shining in the light of  the moon. Gently her hand touched the old captain's arm. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; she  whispered.
  &#8220;Another berg breaking away from Old Thunder. We are very near the  shore, and there are glaciers all the way up.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that other sound, like low wind&#8212;on a night so still and calm!  What is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;You always hear that when very close to the big mountains, Miss  Standish. It is made by the water of a thousand streams and rivulets  rushing down to the sea. Wherever there is melting snow in the  mountains, you hear that song.&#8221;
  &#8220;And this man, Alan Holt,&#8221; she reminded him. &#8220;He is a part of these  things?&#8221;
  &#8220;Possibly more than any other man, Miss Standish. He was born in  Alaska before Nome or Fairbanks or Dawson City were thought of. It was  in Eighty-four, I think. Let me see, that would make him&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Thirty-eight,&#8221; she said, so quickly that for a moment he was  astonished.
  Then he chuckled. &#8220;You are very good at figures.&#8221;
  He felt an almost imperceptible tightening of her fingers on his  arm.
  &#8220;This evening, just after dinner, old Donald found me sitting alone.  He said he was lonely and wanted to talk with someone&#8212;like me. He  almost frightened me, with his great, gray beard and shaggy hair. I  thought of ghosts as we talked there in the dusk.&#8221;
  &#8220;Old Donald belongs to the days when the Chilkoot and the White  Horse ate up men's lives, and a trail of living dead led from the  Summit to Klondike, Miss Standish,&#8221; said Captain Rifle. &#8220;You will meet  many like him in Alaska. And they remember. You can see it in their  faces&#8212;always the memory of those days that are gone.&#8221;
  She bowed her head a little, looking to the sea. &#8220;And Alan Holt? You  know him well?&#8221;
  &#8220;Few men know him well. He is a part of Alaska itself, and I have  sometimes thought him more aloof than the mountains. But I know him.  All northern Alaska knows Alan Holt. He has a reindeer range up beyond  the Endicott Mountains and is always seeking the last frontier.&#8221;
  &#8220;He must be very brave.&#8221;
  &#8220;Alaska breeds heroic men, Miss Standish.&#8221;
  &#8220;And honorable men&#8212;men you can trust and believe in?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is odd,&#8221; she said, with a trembling little laugh that was like a  bird-note in her throat. &#8220;I have never seen Alaska before, and yet  something about these mountains makes me feel that I have known them a  long time ago. I seem to feel they are welcoming me and that I am going  home. Alan Holt is a fortunate man. I should like to be an Alaskan.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you are&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;An American,&#8221; she finished for him, a sudden, swift irony in her  voice. &#8220;A poor product out of the melting-pot, Captain Rifle. I am  going north&#8212;to learn.&#8221;
  &#8220;Only that, Miss Standish?&#8221;
  His question, quietly spoken and without emphasis, demanded an  answer. His kindly face, seamed by the suns and winds of many years at  sea, was filled with honest anxiety as she turned to look straight into  his eyes.
  &#8220;I must press the question,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As the captain of this ship,  and as a father, it is my duty. Is there not something you would like  to tell me&#8212;in confidence, if you will have it so?&#8221;
  For an instant she hesitated, then slowly she shook her head. &#8220;There  is nothing, Captain Rifle.&#8221;
  &#8220;And yet&#8212;you came aboard very strangely,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;You will  recall that it was most unusual&#8212;without reservation, without  baggage&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You forget the hand-bag,&#8221; she reminded him.
  &#8220;Yes, but one does not start for northern Alaska with only a  hand-bag scarcely large enough to contain a change of linen, Miss  Standish.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I did, Captain Rifle.&#8221;
  &#8220;True. And I saw you fighting past the guards like a little wildcat.  It was without precedent.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am sorry. But they were stupid and difficult to pass.&#8221;
  &#8220;Only by chance did I happen to see it all, my child. Otherwise the  ship's regulations would have compelled me to send you ashore. You were  frightened. You can not deny that. You were running away from  something!&#8221;
  He was amazed at the childish simplicity with which she answered  him.
  &#8220;Yes, I was running away&#8212;from something.&#8221;
  Her eyes were beautifully clear and unafraid, and yet again he  sensed the thrill of the fight she was making.
  &#8220;And you will not tell me why&#8212;or from what you were escaping?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can not&#8212;tonight. I may do so before we reach Nome. But&#8212;it is  possible&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221;
  &#8220;That I shall never reach Nome.&#8221;
  Suddenly she caught one of his hands in both her own. Her fingers  clung to him, and with a little note of fierceness in her voice she  hugged the hand to her breast. &#8220;I know just how good you have been to  me,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I should like to tell you why I came aboard&#8212;like  that. But I can not. Look! Look at those wonderful mountains!&#8221; With one  free hand she pointed.
  &#8220;Behind them and beyond them lie the romance and adventure and  mystery of centuries, and for nearly thirty years you have been very  near those things, Captain Rifle. No man will ever see again what you  have seen or feel what you have felt, or forget what you have had to  forget. I know it. And after all that, can't you&#8212;won't you&#8212;forget the  strange manner in which I came aboard this ship? It is such a simple,  little thing to put out of your mind, so trivial, so unimportant when  you look back&#8212;and think. Please Captain Rifle&#8212;please!&#8221;
  So quickly that he scarcely sensed the happening of it she pressed  his hand to her lips. Their warm thrill came and went in an instant,  leaving him speechless, his resolution gone.
  &#8220;I love you because you have been so good to me,&#8221; she whispered, and  as suddenly as she had kissed his hand, she was gone, leaving him alone  at the rail.
