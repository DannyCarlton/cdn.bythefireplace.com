  There was a low tremble in Jeanne's voice. The canoe swung   broadside to the slow current, and Philip looked in astonishment  at  the change in Pierre. The tired half-breed had uncovered his  head, and  knelt with his face turned to that last crimson glow in  the sky, like  one in prayer. But his eyes were open, there was a  smile on his lips,  and he was breathing quickly. Pride and joy  came where there had been  the lines of grief and exhaustion. His  shoulders were thrown back, his  head erect, and the fire of the  distant rock reflected itself in his  eyes. From him Philip turned,  so that he could look into Jeanne's  face. The girl, too, had  changed. Again these two were the Pierre and  Jeanne whom he had  seen that first night on the moonlit cliff. Pierre  seemed no  longer the half-breed, but the prince of the rapier and  broad  cuffs; and Jeanne, smiling proudly at Philip, made him an   exquisite little courtesy from her cramped seat in the bow, and  said: 
  &quot;M'sieur Philip, welcome to Fort o' God!&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, and stared toward the sun-capped rock. 
  He could see nothing but the rock, the black forests, and the   desolate barren stretching between. Fort o' God, unless it was the   rock itself, was still a mystery hidden in the gathering gloom.  The  canoe began moving slowly onward, and Jeanne turned so that  her eyes  searched the stream ahead. A thick wall of stunted forest  shut out the  barren from their view; the stream grew narrower, and  on the opposite  side a barren ridge, threatening them with torn  and upheaved masses of  rock, flung the heavy shadows of evening  down upon them. No one spoke.  Philip could hear Pierre breathing  behind him: something in the  intense quiet&#8212;in the awesome effect  which their approach to Fort o'  God had upon these two&#8212;sent  strange little thrills shooting through  his body. He listened, and  heard nothing, not even the howl of a dog.  The stillness was  oppressive, and the darkness thickened about them.  For half an  hour they continued, and then Pierre headed the canoe into  a  narrow creek, thrusting it through a thick growth of wild rice and   reeds, 
  Balsam and cedar and swamp hazel shut them in. Overhead the tall   cedars interlaced, and hid the pale light of the sky. Philip could   just make out Jeanne ahead of him. 
  And then, suddenly, there came a wonderful change. They shot out   of the darkness, as if from a tunnel, but so quietly that one a  dozen  feet away could not have heard the ripple of Pierre's  paddle. Almost  in their faces rose a huge black bulk, and in that  blackness three or  four yellow lights gleamed like mellow stars.  The canoe touched  noiselessly upon sand. Pierre sprang out, still  without sound. Jeanne  followed, with a whispered word. Philip was  last. 
  Pierre pulled the canoe up, and Jeanne came to Philip. She held   out her two hands. Her face shone white in the gloom, and there  was a  look in her beautiful eyes, as she stood for a moment almost  touching  him, that set his heart jumping. She let her hands lie in  his while  she spoke. 
  &quot;We have not even alarmed the dogs, M'sieur Philip,&quot; she   whispered. &quot;Is not that splendid? I am going to surprise father,  and  you will go with Pierre. I will see you a little later, and&#8212;&quot; 
  She rose on tiptoe, and her face was dangerously close to his own. 
  &quot;And you are very, very welcome to Fort o' God, M'sieur.&quot; 
  She slipped away into the darkness, and Pierre stood beside   Philip. His white teeth were gleaming strangely, and he said in a   soft voice: 
  &quot;M'sieur, that is the first time that I have ever heard those   words spoken at Fort o' God. We welcome no man here who has your   blood and your civilization in his veins. You are greater than a   king!&quot; 
  With a sudden exclamation Philip turned upon Pierre. 
  &quot;And that is the reason for Jeanne's surprise?&quot; he said. &quot;She   wishes to pave a way for me. I begin to understand!&quot; 
  &quot;It is true that you might not have received that welcome which   you are certain to receive now from the master of Fort o' God,&quot;   replied Pierre, frankly. &quot;So we will go in quietly, and make no   disturbance, while your way is being paved, as you call it.&quot; 
  He walked ahead, with Philip following so closely that he could   have touched him. He made out more distinctly now the lines of the   huge black edifice from which the lights shone. It was a massive   structure of logs, two stories high, a half of it almost  completely  hidden in the impenetrable shadow of a great wall of  rock. Philip's  eyes traveled up this wall, and he was convinced  that he stood under  the rock upon whose towering crest he had seen  the last reflection of  the evening sun. About him there were no  signs of life or of other  habitation. Pierre moved swiftly. They  passed under a small lighted  window that was a foot above Philip's  head, and turned around the  corner of the building. Here all was  blackness. 
  Pierre went straight to a door, and uttered at low word of   satisfaction when he found that it was not barred. He opened it,  and  reached out a guiding hand to Philip's arm. Philip entered,  and the  door closed softly behind him. He felt the flow of warm  air in his  face, and his moccasined feet trod upon something soft  and velvety.  Faintly, as though coming from a great distance, he  heard a voice  singing. It was a woman's voice, but he knew that it  was not Jeanne's. 
  In spite of himself his heart was beating excitedly. The mystery   of Fort o' God was about him, warm and subtle, like a strange  spirit,  sending through him the thrill of anticipation, a hundred  fancies,  little fears. Pierre advanced, still guiding him; then he  stopped, and  chuckled softly in the darkness. The distant voice  had stopped  singing, and there came in place of it the loud  barking of a dog, an  unintelligible sound of a voice, and then  quiet. Jeanne had sprung her  surprise. 
  Pierre led the way to another room. 
  &quot;This is to be your room, M'sieur,&quot; he explained. &quot;Make yourself   comfortable. I have no doubt that the master of Fort o' God will  wish  to see you very soon.&quot; 
  He struck a match as he spoke, and lighted a lamp. A moment more   and he was gone. 
  Philip looked about him. He was in a room fully twenty feet   square, furnished in a manner that drew from him an audible gasp  of  astonishment. At one end of the room was a massive mahogany  bed,  screened by heavy curtains which were looped back by silken  cords.  Near the bed was an old-fashioned mahogany dresser, with a   diamond-shaped mirror, and in front of it a straight-backed chair   adorned with the grotesque carving of an ancient and long-dead   fashion. About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and  of  age. The big lamp, which gave a brilliant light, was of  hammered  brass; the base of its square pedestal was partly hidden  in the  rumples of a heavy damask spread which covered the table on  which it  rested. The table itself was old, spindle-legged, glowing  with the  mellow luster endowed by many passing generations&#8212;a  relic of the days  when the originator of its fashion became the  favorite of a capricious  and beautiful queen. Soft rugs were upon  the floor; from the walls,  papered and hung with odd bits of  tapestry, strange faces looked down  upon Philip from out of heavy  gilded frames; faces grim, pale,  shadowed; men with plaited  ruffles and curls; women with powdered  hair, who gazed down upon  him haughtily, as if they wondered at his  intrusion. 
  One picture was turned with its face to the wall. 
  Philip sank into a huge arm-chair, cushioned with velvet, and   dropped his cap upon the floor. And this was Fort o' God! He  scarcely  breathed. He was back two centuries, and he stared, as if  each moment  he expected some manifestation of life in what he saw.  He had dreamed  his dream over the dead at Churchill; here it was  reality&#8212;almost; it  lacked but a breath, a movement, a flutter of  life in the dead faces  that looked down upon him. He gazed up at  them again, and laughed a  little nervously. Then he fixed his eyes  on the opposite wall. One of  the pictures was moving. The thought  in his brain had given birth to  the movement he had imagined. It  was a woman's face in the picture,  young and beautiful, and it  nodded to him, one moment radiant with  light, the next caught in  shadows that cast over it a gloom. He jumped  from his chair and  went so that he stood directly under it. 
  A current of warm air shot up into his face from the floor. It was   this air that was causing movement in the picture, and he looked   down. What he discovered broke the spell he was under. About him  were  the relics of age, of a life long dead. Rubens might have sat  in that  room, and mourned over his handiwork, lost in a  wilderness. The stingy  Louis might have recognized in the spindle-  legged table a bit of his  predecessor's extravagance, which he had  sold for the good of the  exchequer of France; a Gobelin might have  reclaimed one of the woven  landscapes on the wall, a Grosellier  himself have issued from behind  the curtained bed. Philip himself,  in that environment, was the  stranger. It was the current of warm  air which brought him back from  the eighteenth to the twentieth  century. Under his feet was a furnace! 
  Even the master of Fort o' God, stern and forbidding as Philip   began to imagine him, might have laughed at the look which came  into  his face. Grosellier, the cavalier, had he appeared, Philip  would have  accepted with the same confidence that he had accepted  Jeanne and  Pierre. But&#8212;a furnace! He thrust his hands deep in his  pockets, a  trick which was always the last convincing evidence of  his perplexity,  and walked slowly around the room. There were two  books on the table.  One, bound in faded red vellum, was a Greek  Anthology, the other  Drummond's Ascent of Man. There were other  books on a quaintly carved  shelf, under the picture which had been  turned to the wall. He ran  over the titles. There were a number of  French novels, Ely's  Socialism, Sir Thomas More's Utopia, St.  Pierre's Paul and Virginia,  and a dozen other volumes; there were  Balzac and Hugo, and Dante's  Divine Comedy. Amid this array, like  a black sheep lost among the  angels, was a finger-worn and faded  little volume bearing the name  Camille. Something about this one  book, so strangely out of place in  its present company, aroused  Philip's curiosity. It bore the name,  too, which he had found  worked in the corner of Jeanne's handkerchief.  In a way, the  presence of this book gave him a sort of shock, and he  took it in  his hands, and opened the cover. Under his fingers were  pages  yellow and frayed with age, and in an ancient type, once black,   the title, The Meaning of God. In a large masculine hand some one  had  written under this title the accompanying words; &quot;A black skin  often  contains a white soul; a woman's beauty, hell.&quot; 
  Philip replaced the book with a feeling of awe. Something in those   words, brutal in their truth&#8212;something in the strange whim that  had  placed a pearl of purity within the faded and worn mask of the   condemned, seemed to speak to him of a tragedy that might be a key  to  the mystery of Fort o' God. From the books he looked up at the  picture  which had been turned to the wall. The temptation to see  what was  hidden overcame him, and he turned the frame over. Then  he stepped  back with a low cry of pleasure. 
  From out of the proscribed canvas there smiled down upon him a   face of bewildering beauty. It was the face of a young woman, a   stranger among its companions, because it was of the present.  Philip  stepped to one side, so that the light from the lamp shone  from behind  him, and he wondered if the picture had been condemned  to hang with  its face to the wall because it typified the existent  rather than the  past. He looked more closely, and drew back step  by step, until he was  in the proper focus to bring out every  expression in the lovely face.  In the picture he saw each moment a  greater resemblance to Jeanne. The  eyes, the hair, the sweetness  of the mouth, the smile, brought to him  a vision of Jeanne  herself. The woman in the picture was older than  Jeanne, and his  first thought was that it must be a sister, or her  mother. It came  to him in the next breath that this would be  impossible, for  Jeanne had been found by Pierre in the deep snows, on  her dead  mother's breast. And this was a painting of life, of youth,  of  beauty, and not of death and starvation. 
  He returned the forbidden picture to the position in which he had   found it against the wall, half ashamed of the act and thoughts  into  which his curiosity had led him. And yet, after all, it was  not  curiosity. He told himself that as he washed himself and  groomed his  disheveled clothes. 
  An hour had passed when he heard a low tap at the door, and Pierre   came in. In that time the half-breed had undergone a  transformation.  He was dressed in an exquisite coat of yellow  buckskin, with the same  old-fashioned cuffs he had worn when  Philip first saw him, trousers of  the same material, buckled below  the knees, and boot-moccasins with  flaring tops. He wore a new  rapier at his waist, and his glossy black  hair was brushed  smoothly back, and fell loose upon his shoulders. It  was the  courtier, and not Pierre the half-breed, who bowed to Philip. 
  &quot;M'sieur, are you ready?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Philip. 
  &quot;Then we will go to M'sieur d'Arcambal, the master of Fort o'   God.&quot; 
  They passed out into the hall, which was faintly illumined now, so   that Philip caught glimpses of deep shadows and massive doors as  he  followed behind Pierre. They turned into a second hall, at the  end of  which was an open door through which came a flood of light.  At this  door Pierre stopped, and with a bow allowed his companion  to pass in  ahead of him. The next moment Philip stood in a room  twice as large as  the one he had left. It was brilliantly lighted  by three or four  lamps; he had only an instant's vision of  numberless shelves loaded  with books, of walls covered with  pictures, of a ponderous table in  front of him, and then he heard  a voice. 
  A man stepped out from beside the door, and he stood face to face   with the master of Fort o' God.
