  The lockup was a basement room under the engine-house. There were  four  cells, about four by eight, and into one of these Walter was put.  The  cell opposite was occupied by a drunken tramp, who looked up  stupidly  as Walter entered, and hiccoughed: &quot;Glad to see you sonny.&quot; 
  &quot;And I must stay in here overnight&#8212;with that man?&quot; 
  &quot;Hoss-stealers mustn't be particular,&quot; said the constable. 
  &quot;Can you tell me where Colonel Owen lives&#8212;the man that owns the   horse?&quot; 
  &quot;You ought to know that!&quot; 
  &quot;Is there any lawyer in this village?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, there's two, an old man and a young one.&quot; 
  &quot;I should like to see one of them. Can you ask one of them to come   here?&quot; 
  &quot;It's a leetle out of my way,&quot; suggested Constable Stokes. 
  The constable pocketed with alacrity the half-dollar our hero  tendered  him, and said briskly. &quot;I'll send him right off.&quot; 
  &quot;I shay,&quot; interjected the tramp, &quot;send me a lawyer, too.&quot; 
  &quot;The same man will do for you,&quot; replied the constable. &quot;A lawyer  won't  do you no good, though.&quot; 
  &quot;We're victims of tyrannical 'pression!&quot; said the tramp gloomily.   &quot;What are you in for, young feller?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm charged with stealing a horse.&quot; 
  &quot;Smart boy!&quot; said the tramp admiringly. &quot;I didn't think you was up  to  hoss-stealin'.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not. The charge is false.&quot; 
  &quot;That's right! Stick to it! Deny everything. That's what I do.&quot;  Half  an hour later the outer door was opened and the constable  reappeared,  followed by a young man of about thirty. 
  &quot;This is Mr. Barry, the lawyer,&quot; he said. &quot;Mr. Barry, here is the  key.  You can keep it and let yourself out if you will be responsible  for  the safe custody of the prisoner.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Mr. Stokes, I will give you my word that he shall not escape.   Which is my client?&quot; 
  &quot;You don't look like a criminal, certainly,&quot; said the lawyer, with  a  rapid survey of his new client. 
  &quot;I hope not.&quot; 
  &quot;But one can't go by appearances wholly. As your lawyer, for I will   undertake your case, I must ask you to trust me entirely, and give me   your full confidence. 
  &quot;First, let me ask your name.&quot; 
  &quot;Walter Sherwood.&quot; 
  &quot;It will now be necessary for you to tell me frankly whether you  stole  the horse or not.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course I did not,&quot; answered Walter indignantly. 
  &quot;You must excuse my asking the question. I did not believe you  guilty,  but it was necessary for me to know positively from your own  lips. You  must not be sensitive.&quot; 
  &quot;I have no right to be, but I find myself in a very trying  position.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course, but I will try to get you out of it. Now, will you tell  me  in detail how the horse came into your possession?&quot; 
  Walter told the story, and the lawyer listened attentively. 
  &quot;Have you any proof of what you assert?&quot; he asked, when Walter   finished. 
  &quot;There was no one present.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose not. Did no papers pass between you and this man?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; answered Walter quickly, and he drew out the receipt  which  he had drawn up and got Hank Wilson to sign. 
  &quot;Come, this is very important!&quot; said Mr. Barry cheerfully. &quot;It is a   very valuable confirmation of your story. Will you trust me with it?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Is there any suggestion you have to offer, Mr. Sherwood? Sometimes  I  find that my clients give me valuable assistance that way.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish you would telegraph to Colonel Owen to come here.&quot; 
  &quot;Probably he has been sent for, but if not I will request him to  come.  Do you know the colonel?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir; I never heard his name till I read the advertisement. Do  you  know anything of him, Mr. Barry?&quot; 
  &quot;He is the owner of a large estate in Shelby, and is a thorough   gentleman of the old school.&quot; 
  &quot;All the better! I would rather deal with such a man. Besides, by   describing the man of whom I bought the horse I may put him in the way   of capturing the real thief.&quot; 
  &quot;Well thought of. May I ask, Mr. Sherwood, if you are from this  part  of the country?&quot; 
  &quot;No; I am a native of New York State. 
  &quot;A year ago I was a member of the sophomore class of Euclid  College.&quot; 
  &quot;That is strange!&quot; ejaculated Barry. &quot;What is strange?&quot; 
  &quot;Colonel Owen, the owner of the horse, is an old graduate of the  same  institution.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it possible?&quot; exclaimed Walter, in genuine amazement. 
  &quot;It is quite true. I am glad to have made the discovery. It will   prepossess him in your favor, and this, I need hardly say, will be a   great point gained. Well, I believe I have obtained all the data I   require, and I will now go home and think over your case. I wish I   could take you with me.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish you could; I hate to be left in such a place.&quot; 
  &quot;Cheer up, Mr. Sherwood. It won't be for long, I predict. You may  rest  assured of my best efforts in your behalf. I will at once  telegraph  for Colonel Owen.&quot; 
  The evening glided wearily away. Walter threw himself on his pallet   and was nearly asleep when a confused noise was heard outside, and   heavy blows were rained upon the outer door. 
  &quot;What does it mean?&quot; asked Walter, bewildered. 
  He listened intently, and there came to his ears a shout which made   him turn pale with terror.
