  The astounding statement of the man who sat opposite him held   David speechless. He had guessed at some mysterious relationship   between St. Pierre and the criminal he was after, but not this,  and  Roger Audemard, with his hands unclenching and a slow humor  beginning  to play about his mouth, waited coolly for him to  recover from his  amazement. In those moments, when his heart  seemed to have stopped  beating, Carrigan was staring at the other,  but his mind had shot  beyond him&#8212;to the woman who was his wife.  Marie-Anne AUDEMARD&#8212;the  wife of Black Roger! He wanted to cry out  against the possibility of  such a fact, yet he sat like one struck  dumb, as the monstrous truth  took possession of his brain and a  whirlwind of understanding swept  upon him. He was thinking  quickly, and with a terrific lack of  sentiment now. Opposite him  sat Black Roger, the wholesale murderer.  Marie-Anne was his wife.  Carmin Fanchet, sister of a murderer, was  simply one of his kind.  And Bateese, the man-gorilla, and the Broken  Man, and all the  dark-skinned pack about them were of Black Roger's  breed and kind.  Love for a woman had blinded him to the facts which  crowded upon  him now. Like a lamb he had fallen among wolves, and he  had tried  to believe in them. No wonder Bateese and the man he had  known as  St. Pierre had betrayed such merriment at times! 
  A fighting coolness possessed him as he spoke to Black Roger. 
  &quot;I will admit this is a surprise. And yet you have cleared up a   number of things very quickly. It proves to me again that comedy  is  not very far removed from tragedy at times.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you see the humor of it, M'sieu David.&quot; Black Roger was   smiling as pleasantly as his swollen eye would permit. &quot;We must  not  be too serious when we die. If I were to die a-hanging, I  would sing  as the rope choked me, just to show the world one need  not be unhappy  because his life is coming to an end.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose you understand that ultimately I am going to give you   that opportunity,&quot; said David. 
  Almost eagerly Black Roger leaned toward him over the table. &quot;You   believe you are going to hang me?&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure of it.&quot; 
  &quot;And you are willing to wager the point, M'sieu David?&quot; 
  &quot;It is impossible to gamble with a condemned man.&quot; 
  Black Roger chuckled, rubbing his big hands together until they   made a rasping sound, and his one good eye glowed at Carrigan. 
  &quot;Then I will make a wager with myself, M'sieu David. MA FOI, I   swear that before the leaves fall from the trees, you will be   pleading for the friendship of Black Roger Audemard, and you will  be  as much in love with Carmin Fanchet as I am! And as for Marie-  Anne&#8212;&quot; 
  He thrust back his chair and rose to his feet, the old note of   subdued laughter rumbling in his chest. &quot;And because I make this   wager with myself, I cannot kill you, M'sieu David&#8212;though that  might  be the best thing to do. I am going to take you to the  Chateau  Boulain, which is in the forests of the Yellowknife,  beyond the Great  Slave. Nothing will happen to you if you make no  effort to escape. If  you do that, you will surely die. And that  would hurt me, M'sieu  David, because I love you like a brother,  and in the end I know you  are going to grip the hand of Black  Roger Audemard, and get down on  your knees to Carmin Fanchet. And  as for Marie-Anne&#8212;&quot; Again he  interrupted himself, and went out of  the cabin, laughing. And there  was no mistake in the metallic  click of the lock outside the door. 
  For a time David did not move from his seat near the table. He had   not let Roger Audemard see how completely the confession had upset   his inner balance, but he made no pretense of concealing the thing   from himself now. He was in the power of a cut-throat, who in turn   had an army of cut-throats at his back, and both Marie-Anne and   Carmin Fanchet were a part of this ring. And he was not only a   prisoner. It was probable, under the circumstances, that Black  Roger  would make an end of him when a convenient moment came. It  was even  more than a probability. It was a grim necessity. To let  him live and  escape would be fatal to Black Roger. 
  From back of these convictions, riding over them as if to   demoralize any coherence and logic that might go with the evidence  he  was building up, came question after question, pounding at him  one  after the other, until his mind became more than ever a  whirling chaos  of uncertainty. If St. Pierre was Black Roger, why  would he confess to  that fact simply to pay a wager? What reason  could he have for letting  him live at all? Why had not Bateese  killed him? Why had Marie-Anne  nursed him back to life? His mind  shot to the white strip of sand in  which he had nearly died. That,  at least, was convincing. Learning in  some way that he was after  Black Roger, they had attempted to do away  with him there. But if  that were so, why was it Bateese and Black  Roger's wife and the  Indian Nepapinas had risked so much to make him  live, when if they  had left him where he had fallen he would have died  and caused  them no trouble? 
  There was something exasperatingly uncertain and illogical about   it all. Was it possible that St. Pierre Boulain was playing a huge   joke on him? Even that was inconceivable. For there was Carmin   Fanchet, a fitting companion for a man like Black Roger, and there   was Marie-Anne, who, if it had been a joke, would not have played  her  part so well. 
  Suddenly his mind was filled only with her. Had she been his   friend, using all her influence to protect him, because her heart  was  sick of the environment of which she was a part? His own heart  jumped  at the thought. It was easy to believe. In Marie-Anne he  had faith,  and that faith refused to be destroyed, but persisted&#8212;  even clearer  and stronger as he thought again of Carmin Fanchet  and Black Roger. In  his heart grew the conviction it was sacrilege  to believe the kiss she  had given him that morning was a lie. It  was something else&#8212;a  spontaneous gladness, a joyous exultation  that he had returned  unharmed, a thing unplanned in the soul of  the woman, leaping from her  before she could stop it. Then had  come shame, and she had run away  from him so swiftly he had not  seen her face again after the touch of  her lips. If it had been a  subterfuge, a lie, she would not have done  that. 
  He rose to his feet and paced restlessly back and forth as he   tried to bring together a few tangled bits of the puzzle. He heard   voices outside, and very soon felt the movement of the bateau  under  his feet, and through one of the shoreward windows he saw  trees and  sandy beach slowly drifting away. On that shore, as far  as his eyes  could travel up and down, he saw no sign of Marie-  Anne, but there  remained a canoe, and near the canoe stood Black  Roger Audemard, and  beyond him, huddled like a charred stump in  the sand, was Andre, the  Broken Man. On the opposite shore the  raft was getting under way. 
  During the next half-hour several things happened which told him   there was no longer a sugar-coating to his imprisonment. On each  side  of the bateau two men worked at his windows, and when they  had  finished, no one of them could be opened more than a few  inches. Then  came the rattle of the lock at the door, the grating  of a key, and  somewhat to Carrigan's surprise it was Bateese who  came in. The  half-reed bore no facial evidence of the paralyzing  blows which had  knocked him out a short time before. His jaw, on  which they had  landed, was as aggressive as ever, yet in his face  and his attitude,  as he stared curiously at Carrigan, there was no  sign of resentment or  unfriendliness. Nor did he seem to be  ashamed. He merely stared, with  the curious and rather puzzled  eyes of a small boy gazing at an  inexplicable oddity. Carrigan,  standing before him, knew what was  passing in the other's mind,  and the humor of it brought a smile to  his lips. 
  Instantly Concombre's face split into a wide grin. &quot;MON DIEU, w'at   if you was on'y brother to Concombre Bateese, m'sieu. T'ink of   zat&#8212;you&#8212;me&#8212;FRERE D'ARMES! VENTRE SAINT GRIS, but we mak' all   fightin' men in nort' countree run lak rabbits ahead of ze fox!  OUI,  we mak' gr-r-r-eat pair, m'sieu&#8212;you, w'at knock down  Bateese&#8212;an'  Bateese, w'at keel polar bear wit hees naked hands,  w'at pull down  trees, w'at chew flint w'en hees tobacco gone.&quot; 
  His voice had risen, and suddenly there came a laugh from outside   the door, and Concombre cut himself short and his mouth closed  with a  snap. It was Joe Clamart who had laughed. 
  &quot;I w'ip heem five time, an' now I w'ip heem seex!&quot; hissed Bateese   in an undertone. &quot;Two time each year I w'ip zat gargon Joe Clamart  so  he understan' w'at good fightin' man ees. An' you will w'ip  heem, eh,  m'sieu? Oui? An' I will breeng odder good fightin' mans  for you to  w'ip&#8212;all w'at Concombre Bateese has w'ipped&#8212;ten,  dozen, forty&#8212;an'  you w'ip se gran' bunch, m'sieu. Eh, shall we  mak' ze bargain?&quot; 
  &quot;You are planning a pleasant time for me, Bateese,&quot; said Carrigan,   &quot;but I am afraid it will be impossible. You see, this captain of   yours, Black Roger Audemard&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;W'at!&quot; Bateese jumped as if stung. &quot;W'at you say, m'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;I said that Roger Audemard, Black Roger, the man I thought was   St. Pierre Boulain&#8212;&quot; 
  Carrigan said no more. What he had started to say was unimportant   compared with the effect of Roger Audernard's name on Concombre   Bateese. A deadly light glittered in the half-breed's eyes, and  for  the first time David realized that in the grotesque head of  the  riverman was a brain quick to grip at the significance of  things. The  fact was evident that Black Roger had not confided in  Bateese as to  the price of the wager and the confession of his  identity, and for a  moment after the repetition of Audemard's name  came from David's lips  the half-breed stood as if something had  stunned him. Then slowly, as  if forcing the words in the face of a  terrific desire that had  transformed his body into a hulk of  quivering steel, he said: 
  &quot;M'sieu&#8212;I come with message&#8212;from St. Pierre. You see windows&#8212;   closed. Outside door&#8212;she locked. On bot' sides de bateau, all de   time, we watch. You try get away, an' we keel you. Zat ees all. We   shoot. We five mans on ze bateau, all ze day, TOUTE LA NUIT. You   unnerstan'?&quot; 
  He turned sullenly, waiting for no reply, and the door opened and   closed after him&#8212;and again came the snap of the lock outside. 
  Steadily the bateau swept down the big river that day. There was   no let-up in the steady creaking of the long sweep. Even in the   swifter currents David could hear the working of it, and he knew  he  had seen the last of the more slowly moving raft. Near one of  the  partly open windows he heard two men talking just before the  bateau  shot into the Brule Point rapids. They were strange voices.  He learned  that Audemard's huge raft was made up of thirty-five  cribs, seven  abreast, and that nine times between the Point Brule  and the  Yellowknife the raft would be split up, so that each crib  could be run  through dangerous rapids by itself. 
  That would be a big job, David assured himself. It would be slow   work as well as hazardous, and as his own life was in no immediate   jeopardy, he would have ample time in which to formulate some plan  of  action for himself. At the present moment, it seemed, the one  thing  for him to do was to wait&#8212;and behave himself, according to  the  half-breed's instructions. There was, when he came to think  about it,  a saving element of humor about it all. He had always  wanted to make a  trip down the Three Rivers in a bateau. And now&#8212;  he was making it! 
  At noon a guard brought in his dinner. He could not recall that he   had ever seen this man before, a tall, lithe fellow built to run  like  a hound, and who wore a murderous-looking knife at his belt.  As the  door opened, David caught a glimpse of two others. They  were  business-like looking individuals, with muscles built for  work or  fight; one sitting cross-legged on the bateau deck with a  rifle over  his knees, and the other standing with a rifle in his  hand. The man  who brought his dinner wasted no time or words. He  merely nodded,  murmured a curt bonjour, and went out. And  Carrigan, as he began to  eat, did not have to tell himself twice  that Audemard had been  particular in his selection of the bateau's  crew, and that the eyes of  the men he had seen could be as keen as  a hawk's when leveled over the  tip of a rifle barrel. They meant  business, and he felt no desire to  smile in the face of them, as  he had smiled at Concombre Bateese. 
  It was another man, and a stranger, who brought in his supper. And   for two hours after that, until the sun went down and gloom began  to  fall, the bateau sped down the river. It had made forty miles  that  day, he figured. 
  It was still light when the bateau was run ashore and tied up, but   tonight there were no singing voices or wild laughter of men whose   hours of play-time and rest had come. To Carrigan, looking through   his window, there was an oppressive menace about it all. The  shadowy  figures ashore were more like a death-watch than a guard,  and to  dispel the gloom of it he lighted two of the lamps in the  cabin,  whistled, drummed a simple chord he knew on the piano, and  finally  settled down to smoking his pipe. He would have welcomed  the company  of Bateese, or Joe Clamart, or one of the guards, and  as his  loneliness grew upon him there was something of  companionship even in  the subdued voices he heard occasionally  outside. He tried to read,  but the printed words jumbled  themselves and meant nothing. 
  It was ten o'clock, and clouds had darkened the night, when   through his open windows he heard a shout coming from the river.   Twice it came before it was answered from the bateau, and the  second  time Carrigan recognized it as the voice of Roger Audemard.  A brief  interval passed between that and the scraping of a canoe  alongside,  and then there was a low conversation in which even  Audemard's great  voice was subdued, and after that the grating of  a key in the lock,  and the opening of the door, and Black Roger  came in, bearing an  Indian reed basket under his arm. Carrigan did  not rise to meet him.  It was not like the coming of the old St.  Pierre, and on Black Roger's  lips there was no twist of a smile,  nor in his eyes the flash of  good-natured greeting. His face was  darkly stern, as if he had  traveled far and hard on an unpleasant  mission, but in it there was no  shadow of menace, as there had  been in that of Concombre Bateese. It  was rather the face of a  tired man, and yet David knew what he saw was  not physical  exhaustion. Black Roger guessed something of his thought,  and his  mouth for an instant repressed a smile. 
  &quot;Yes, I have been having a rough time,&quot; he nodded, &quot;This is for   you!&quot; 
  He placed the basket on the table. It held half a bushel, and was   filled to the curve of the handle. What lay in it was hidden under  a  cloth securely tied about it. 
  &quot;And you are responsible,&quot; he added, stretching himself in a chair   with a gesture of weariness. &quot;I should kill you, Carrigan. And   instead of that I bring you good things to eat! Half the day she  has  been fussing with the things in the basket, and then insisted  that I  bring them to you. And I have brought them simply to tell  you another  thing. I am sorry for her. I think, M'sieu Carrigan,  you will find as  many tears in the basket as anything else, for  her heart is crushed  and sick because of the humiliation she  brought upon herself this  morning.&quot; 
  He was twisting his big, rough hands, and David's own heart went   sick as he saw the furrowed lines that had deepened in the other's   face. Black Roger did not look at him as he went on. 
  &quot;Of course, she told me. She tells me everything. And if she knew   I was telling you this, I think she would kill herself. But I want   you to understand. She is not what you might think she is. That  kiss  came from the lips of the best woman God ever made, M'sieu  Carrigan!&quot; 
  David, with the blood in him running like fire, heard himself   answering, &quot;I know it. She was excited, glad you had not stained  your  hands with my life&#8212;&quot; 
  This time Audemard smiled, but it was the smile of a man ten years   older than he had appeared yesterday. &quot;Don't try to answer,  m'sieu. I  only want you to know she is as pure as the stars. It  was unfortunate,  but to follow the impulse of one's heart can not  be a sin. Everything  has been unfortunate since you came. But I  blame no one, except&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Carmin Fanchet?&quot; 
  Audemard nodded. &quot;Yes. I have sent her away. Marie-Anne is in the   cabin on the raft now. But even Carmin I can not blame very  greatly,  m'sieu, for it is impossible to hold anything against one  you love.  Tell me if I am right? You must know. You love my Marie-  Anne. Do you  hold anything against her?&quot; 
  &quot;It is unfair,&quot; protested David. &quot;She is your wife, Audemard, is   it possible you don't love her?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I love her.&quot; 
  &quot;And Carmin Fanchet?&quot; 
  &quot;I love her, too. They are so different. Yet I love them both. Is   it not possible for a big heart like mine to do that, m'sieu?&quot; 
  With almost a snort David rose to his feet and stared through one   of the windows into the darkness of the river. &quot;Black Roger,&quot; he  said  without turning his head, &quot;the evidence at Headquarters  condemns you  as one of the blackest-hearted murderers that ever  lived. But that  crime, to me, is less atrocious than the one you  are committing  against your own wife. I am not ashamed to confess  I love her, because  to deny it would be a lie. I love her so much  that I would sacrifice  myself&#8212;soul and body&#8212;if that sacrifice  could give you back to her,  clean and undefiled and with your hand  unstained by the crime for  which you must hang!&quot; 
  He did not hear Roger Audemard as he rose from his chair. For a   moment the riverman stared at the back of David's head, and in  that  moment he was fighting to keep back what wanted to come from  his lips  in words. He turned before David faced him again, and did  not pause  until he stood at the cabin door with his hand at the  latch. There he  was partly in shadow. 
  &quot;I shall not see you again until you reach the Yellowknife,&quot; he   said. &quot;Not until then will you know&#8212;or will I know&#8212;what is going  to  happen. I think you will understand strange things then, but  that is  for the hour to tell. Bateese has explained to you that  you must not  make an effort to escape. You would regret it, and so  would I. If you  have red blood in you, m'sieu&#8212;if you would  understand all that you  cannot understand now&#8212;wait as patiently  as you can. Bonne nuit,  M'sieu Carrigan!&quot; 
  &quot;Good night!&quot; nodded David. 
  In the pale shadows he thought a mysterious light of gladness   illumined Black Roger's face before the door opened and closed,   leaving him alone again.
