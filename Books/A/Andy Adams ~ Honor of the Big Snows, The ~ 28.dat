  That night Jan Thoreau passed for the last time back into the  shelter  of his forests; and all that night he traveled, and with each  mile  that he left behind him something larger and bolder grew in his  breast  until he cracked his whip in the old way, and shouted to the  dogs in  the old way, and the blood in him sang to the wild spirit of  the  wilderness. Once more he was home. To him the forest had always  been  home, filled with the low voice of whispering winds and trees,  and to-  night it was more his home than ever. Lonely and sick at  heart, with  no other desire than to bury himself deeper and deeper  into it, he  felt the life, and sympathy, and love of it creeping into  his heart,  grieving with him in his grief, warming him with its hope,  pledging  him again the eternal friendship of its trees, its mountains,  and all  of the wild that it held therein. 
  And from above him the stars looked down like a billion tiny fires   kindled by loving hands to light his way&#8212;the stars that had given him   music, peace, since he could remember, and that had taught him more of   the silent power of God than the lips of man could ever tell. From   this time forth Jan Thoreau knew that these things would be his life,   his god. A thousand times in fanciful play he had given life and form   to the star-shadows about him, to the shadows of the tall spruce, the   twisted shrub, the rocks and even the mountains. And now it was no   longer play. With each hour that passed this night, and with each day   and night that followed, they became more real to him, and his fires   in the black gloom painted him pictures as they had never painted them   before, and the trees and the rocks and the twisted shrub comforted   him more and more in his loneliness, and gave to him the presence of   life in their movement, in the coming and going of their shadow-forms.   Everywhere they were the same old friends, unvarying and changeless.   The spruce-shadow of to-night, nodding to him in its silent way, was   the same that had nodded to him last night&#8212;a hundred nights ago; the   stars were the same, the winds whispering to him in the tree-tops were   the same, everything was as it was yesterday&#8212;years ago&#8212;unchanged,   never leaving him, never growing cold in their devotion. He had loved   the forest&#8212;NOW he worshipped it. In its vast silence he still   possessed M&eacute;lisse. It whispered to him still of her old love, of their   days and years of happiness, and with his forest he lived these days   over and over again, and when he slept with his forest he dreamed of   them. 
  Nearly a month passed before he reached Oxford House and found the   sweet-faced girl whom Thornton loved. He did as Thornton had asked,   and went on&#8212;into the north and east. He had no mission now, except to   roam in his forests. He went down the Hayes, getting his few supplies   at Indian camps, and stopped at last, with the beginning of spring,   far up on the Cutaway. Here he built himself a camp and lived for a   time, setting dead-falls for bear. Then he struck north again, and   still east&#8212;keeping always away from Lac Bain. When the first chill   winds of the bay brought warning of winter down to him he was filled   for a time with a longing to strike north&#8212;and WEST, to go once more   back to his Barren Lands. But, instead, he went south, and so it came   to pass that a year after he had left Lac Bain he built himself a   cabin deep in the forest of God's River, fifty miles from Oxford   House, and trapped once more for the company. He had not forgotten his   promise to Thornton, and at Oxford House left word where he could be   found if the man from civilization should return. 
  In late mid-winter Jan returned to Oxford House with his furs. It  was  on the night of the day that he came into the post that he heard a   Frenchman who had come down from the north speak of Lac Bain. None   noticed the change in Jan's face as he hung back in the shadows of the   company's store. A little later he followed the Frenchman outside, and   stopped him where there were no others near to overhear. 
  &quot;M'sieur, you spoke of Lac Bain,&quot; he said in French. &quot;You have been   there?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the other, &quot;I was there for a week waiting for the   first sledge snow.&quot; 
  &quot;It is my old home,&quot; said Jan, trying to keep his voice natural. &quot;I   have wondered&#8212;if there are changes. You saw&#8212;Cummins&#8212;the factor?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he was there.&quot; 
  &quot;And&#8212;and Jean de Gravois, the chief man?&quot; 
  &quot;He was away. Mon Dieu, listen to that! The dogs are fighting out   there!&quot; 
  &quot;A moment, m'sieur,&quot; begged Jan, as the Frenchman made a movement  as  if to run in the direction of the tumult. &quot;The factor had a  daughter&#8212;  M&eacute;lisse&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;She left Lac Bain a long time ago, m'sieur,&quot; interrupted the  trapper,  making a tremendous effort to be polite as he edged toward  the sound  of battle. &quot;M'sieur Cummins told me that he had not seen her  in a long  time&#8212;I believe it was almost a year. Sacre, listen to that!  They are  tearing one another to bits, and they are MY dogs, m'sieur,  for I can  tell their voices among a thousand!&quot; 
  He sprang through the darkness and Jan made a movement to follow.  Then  he stopped, and turned instead to the company's store. He took  his  pack to the sledge and dogs in the edge of the spruce, and Kazan   leaped to greet him at the end of his babiche. This night as Jan   traveled through the forest he did not notice the stars or the   friendly shadows. 
  &quot;A year,&quot; he repeated to himself, again and again, and once, when   Kazan rubbed against his leg and looked up into his face, he said,   &quot;Ah, Kazan, our M&eacute;lisse went away with the Englishman. May the Great   God give them happiness!&quot; 
  The forest claimed him more than ever after this. He did not go  back  to Oxford House in the spring but sold his furs to a passing  half-  breed, and wandered through all of that spring and summer in the   country to the west. It was January when he returned to his cabin,   when the snows were deepest, and three days later he set out to outfit   at the Hudson's Bay post on God's Lake instead of at Oxford House. It   was while they were crossing a part of the lake that Kazan leaped   aside for an instant in his traces and snapped at something in the   snow. 
  Jan saw the movement but gave no attention to it until a little  later,  when Kazan stopped and fell upon his belly, biting at the  harness and  whining in pain. The thought of Kazan's sudden snap at the  snow came  to him then like a knife-thrust, and with a low cry of  horror and fear  he fell upon his knees beside the dog. Kazan whimpered  and his bushy  tail swept the snow as Jan lifted his great wolfish head  between his  two hands. No other sound came from Jan's lips now, and  slowly he drew  the dog up to him until he held him in his arms as he  might have held  a child, Kazan stilled the whimpering sounds in his  throat. His one  eye rested on his master's face, faithful, watching  for some sign&#8212;for  some language there, even as the burning fires of a  strange torture  gnawed at his life, and in that eye Jan saw the  deepening reddish film  which he had seen a hundred times before in the  eyes of foxes and  wolves killed by poison bait. 
  A moan of anguish burst from Jan's lips and he held his face close   down against Kazan's head, and sobbed now like a child, while Kazan   rubbed his hot muzzle against his cheek and his muscles hardened in a   last desire to give battle to whatever was giving his master grief. It   was a long time before Jan lifted his face from the shaggy head, and   when he did he knew that the last of all love, of all companionship,   of all that bound him to flesh and blood in his lonely world, was   gone. Kazan was dead. 
  From the sledge he took a blanket and wrapped Kazan in it, and  carried  him a hundred yards back from the trail. With bowed head he  came  behind his four dogs into God's House. Half an hour later he  turned  back into the wilderness with his supplies. It was dark when he   returned to where he had left Kazan. He placed him upon the sledge and   the four huskies whined as they dragged on their burden, from which   the smell of death came to them. They stopped in the deep forests   beyond the lake and Jan built a fire. 
  This night, as on all nights in his lonely life, Jan drew Kazan  close  to him, and he shivered as the other dogs slunk back from him   suspiciously and the fire and the spruce tops broke the stillness of   the forest. He looked at the crackling flames, at the fitful shadows   which they set dancing and grimacing about him, and it seemed to him   now that they were no longer friends, but were taunting him&#8212;gloating   in Kazan's death, and telling him that he was alone, alone, alone. He   let the fire die down, stirring it into life only when the cold   stiffened him, and when at last he fell into an unquiet slumber it was   still to hear the spruce tops whispering to him that Kazan was dead,   and that in dying he had broken the last fragile link between Jan   Thoreau and M&eacute;lisse. 
  He went on at dawn, with Kazan wrapped in his blanket on the  sledge.  He planned to reach the cabin that night, and the next day he  would  bury his old comrade. It was dark when he came to the narrow  plain  that lay between him and the river. The sky was brilliant with  stars  when he slowly climbed the big, barren ridge at the foot of  which was  his home. At the summit he stopped and seated himself on the  edge of a  rock, with nothing but a thousand miles of space between him  and the  pale glow of the northern lights. At his feet lay the forest,  black  and silent, and he looked down to where he knew his cabin was  waiting  for him, black and silent, too. 
  For the first time it came upon him that THIS was home&#8212;that the   forest, and the silence, and the little cabin hidden under the spruce   tops below held a deeper meaning for him than a few hours before, when   Kazan was a leaping, living comrade at his side. Kazan was dead. Down   there he would bury him. And he had loved Kazan;&#8212;he knew, now, as he   clutched his hands to his aching breast, that he would have fought for   Kazan&#8212;given up his life for him&#8212;as he would have done for a brother.   Down there, under the silent spruce, he would bury the last that had   remained to him of the old life, and there swelled up in his heart a   longing, almost a prayer, that M&eacute;lisse might know that he, Jan   Thoreau, would have nothing left to him to-morrow but a grave, and   that in that grave was their old chum, their old playmate&#8212;Kazan. Hot   tears blinded Jan's eyes and he covered his face with his hands, and   sobbed as he had sobbed years before, when in the southern wilderness   word came to him that M&eacute;lisse was dying. 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse&#8212;M&eacute;lisse&#8212;&quot; He moaned her name aloud, and stared through  the  hot film in his eyes away into the north, sobbing to her, calling  to  her in his grief, and looking through that thousand miles of  starlit  space as though from out of it her sweet face would come to  him once  more. And as he called there seemed to come to him from out  of that  space a sound, so sweet, and low, and tender that his heart  stood  still and he stood up straight and stretched his arms up to  Heaven,  for Jan Thoreau knew that it was the sound of a violin that  came to  him from out of the north&#8212;that M&eacute;lisse, an infinity away, had  heard  his call, his prayer, and was playing for him and Kazan! 
  And suddenly, as he listened, his arms fell to his sides, and there   shot into his eyes all of the concentrated light of the stars, for the   music came nearer and nearer, and still nearer to him, until he caught   Kazan in his arms and ran with him down the side of the mountain. It   died now in the forest&#8212;then rose again, softer and more distant it   seemed to him, luring him on into the forest gloom. For a few moments   consciousness of all else but that sound remained with him only in a   dazed, half real way, and as John Cummins had called upon the angels   at Lac Bain many years ago when he, too, had gone out into the night   to meet this wonderful music, so Jan Thoreau's soul cried to them now   as he clutched Kazan to him, and stumbled on. Then, suddenly, he came   upon the cabin, and in the cabin there was a light! 
  Gently he laid Kazan down upon the snow, and for a full minute he   stood and listened, and heard, lower and sweeter still, the gentle   music, of the violin. Some one was in his cabin&#8212;living hands were   playing! After all it was not the spirit of M&eacute;lisse that had come to   him in the hour of his deepest grief, and a sob rose in his throat. He   went on, step by step, and at the door he stopped again, wondering if   he was mad, if the spirits of the forest were taunting him still, if&#8212;   if&#8212; 
  One step more&#8212; 
  The Great God, he heard it now&#8212;the low, sweet music of the old  Cree  love song, played in the old, old way, with all of its old  sadness,  its whispering joy, its weeping song of life, of death, of  love! With  a great cry he flung open the door and leaped in, with his  arms  reaching out, his eyes blinded for a moment by the sudden  light&#8212;and  with a cry as piercing as his own, something ran through  that light to  meet him&#8212;M&eacute;lisse, the old, glorious M&eacute;lisse, crushing  her arms about  his neck, sobbing his name, pleading with him in her  old, sweet voice  to kiss her, kiss her, kiss her&#8212;while Jan Thoreau  for the first time  in his life felt sweeping over him a resistless  weakness, and in this  vision he knew that Jean de Gravois came to him,  too, and held him in  his arms, and that as the light faded away from  about him he still  heard M&eacute;lisse calling to him, felt her arms about  him, her face  crushed to his own. And as the deep gloom enveloped him  more densely,  and he felt himself slipping down through it, he  whispered to the  faces which he could no longer see, 
  &quot;Kazan&#8212;died&#8212;to-night&#8212;&quot; 
  For a long time Jan fought to throw off the darkness, and when he   succeeded, and opened his eyes again, he knew that it was M&eacute;lisse who   was sitting beside him, and that it was M&eacute;lisse who flung her arms   about him when he awoke from his strange sleep, and held his wild head   pressed against her bosom&#8212;M&eacute;lisse, with her glorious hair flowing   about her as he had loved it in their old days, and with the old love   shining in her eyes, only more glorious now, as he heard her voice. 
  &quot;Jan&#8212;Jan&#8212;we have been hunting for you&#8212;so long,&quot; she cried  softly.  &quot;We have been searching&#8212;ever since you left Lac Bain. Jan,  dear Jan,  I loved you so&#8212;and you almost broke my heart. Dear, dear  Jan,&quot; she  sobbed, stroking his face now, &quot;I know why you ran away&#8212;I  know, and I  love you so that&#8212;that I will die if&#8212;you go away again.&quot; 
  &quot;You know!&quot; breathed Jan. He was in his cot, and raised himself,   clasping her beautiful face between his two hands, staring at her with   the old horror in his eyes. &quot;You know&#8212;and you come&#8212;to me!&quot; 
  &quot;I love you,&quot; said M&eacute;lisse. She slipped up to him and laid her face   upon his breast, and with her fingers clutched in his long hair she   leaned over to him and kissed him. &quot;I love you!&quot; 
  Jan's arms closed about her, and he bowed his face so that it was   smothered in her hair and he felt against it the joyous tremble of her   bosom. 
  &quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered again, and under her cloud of hair  their  lips met, and she whispered again, with her sweet breath still  upon  his lips, &quot;I love you.&quot; 
  Outside Jean de Gravois was dancing up and down in the starlit edge  of  the forest, and Iowaka was looking at him. 
  &quot;And NOW what do you think of your Jean de Gravois?&quot; cried Jean for   the hundredth time at least. &quot;NOW what do you think of him, my   beautiful one?&quot; and he caught Iowaka's head in his arms, for the   hundredth time, too, and kissed her until she pushed him away. &quot;Was it   not right for me to break my oath to the Blessed Virgin and tell   M&eacute;lisse why Jan Thoreau had gone mad? Was it not right, I say? And did   not M&eacute;lisse do as I told that fool of a Jan that she WOULD do? And   didn't she HATE the Englishman all of the time? Eh? Can you not speak,   my raven-haired angel?&quot; 
  He hugged Iowaka again in his arms, and this time he did not let  her  go, but turned her face so that the starlight fell upon it. 
  &quot;And NOW what if Jan Thoreau still feels that the curse is upon  him?&quot;  he asked softly. &quot;Ho, ho, we have fixed that&#8212;you, my sweet  Iowaka,  and your husband, Jean de Gravois. I have it&#8212;here&#8212;in my  pocket&#8212;the  letter signed by the sub-commissioner at Prince Albert, to  whom I told  Jan's story when I followed his trail down there&#8212;the  letter which  says that the other woman died BEFORE the man who was to  be Jan  Thoreau's father married the woman who was to be his mother.  And NOW  do you understand why I did not tell M&eacute;lisse of this letter,  ma  ch&eacute;rie? It was to prove to that fool of a Jan Thoreau that she  loved  him&#8212;WHATEVER HE WAS. NOW what do you think of Jean de Gravois,  you  daughter of a princess, you&#8212;you&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Wife of the greatest man in the world,&quot; laughed Iowaka softly.  &quot;Come,  my foolish Jean, we can not stand out for ever. I am growing  cold. And  besides, do you not suppose that Jan would like to see ME?&quot; 
  &quot;Foolish&#8212;foolish&#8212;foolish&#8212;&quot; murmured Jean as they walked hand in   hand through the starlight. &quot;She, my Iowaka, my beloved, says that I   am foolish&#8212;AND AFTER THIS! Mon Dieu, what can a man do to make   himself great in the eyes of his wife?&quot; 
  THE END
