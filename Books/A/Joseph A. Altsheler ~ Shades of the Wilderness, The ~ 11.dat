  Youth was strong in Harry, and, while he danced and the music  played, he forgot all about the incident in the smoking-room. With him  it was just one pretty girl after another. He had heart enough for them  all, and only one who was so young and who had been so long on  battlefields could well understand what a keen, even poignant, pleasure  it was to be with them.
  Those were the days when a ball lasted long. Pleasures did not come  often, but when they came they were to be enjoyed to the full. But as  the morning hours grew the manner of the older people became slightly  feverish and unnatural. They were pursuing pleasure and forgetfulness  with so much zeal and energy that it bore the aspect of force rather  than spontaneity. Harry noticed it and divined the cause. Beneath his  high spirits he now felt it himself. It was that looming shadow in the  North and that other in that far Southwest hovering over lost  Vicksburg. Serious men and serious women could not keep these shadows  from their eyes long.
  The incident of the smoking-room and the missing map came back to  him with renewed force. It could not have walked away. They had  searched the room and the court so thoroughly that they would have  found it, had it been there. The disappearance of a document, which men  of authority and knowledge had built up almost unconsciously, puzzled  and alarmed him.
  It was almost day when he and Dalton left. They paid their respects  to Mr. and Mrs. Curtis, and said many good-bys to &#8220;the girls they left  behind them.&#8221; Then they went out into the street, and inhaled great  draughts of the cool night air.
  &#8220;A splendid night,&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;Yes, truly,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I hope you didn't propose to more than six girls.&#8221;
  &#8220;To none. But I love them all together.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad to hear it, because you're entirely too young to marry,  and your occupation is precarious.&#8221;
  &#8220;You needn't be so preachy. You're not more'n a hundred years old  yourself.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I'm two months older than you are and often two months makes a  vast difference, particularly in our cases. I notice about you, Harry,  at times, a certain juvenility which I feel it my duty to repress.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't do it, George. Let's enjoy it while we can, because as you  say my occupation is precarious and yours is the same.&#8221;
  They stopped at the corner of the iron fence enclosing the Curtis  home, in which many lights were still shining. It was near a dark alley  opening on the street and running by this side of the house.
  &#8220;I'm going to see what's behind Mr. Curtis's house,&#8221; said Harry.
  Dalton stared at him.
  &#8220;What's got into your head, Harry!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Do you mean to be  a burglar prowling about the home of the man who has entertained you?&#8221;
  Harry hesitated. He was sorry that Dalton was with him. Then he  could have gone on without question, but he must make some excuse to  Dalton.
  &#8220;George,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;will you swear to keep a secret, a most  important one which I am pledged to tell to nobody, but which I must  confide in you in order to give a good reason for what I am about to  do.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you are pledged to keep such a secret,&#8221; replied Dalton, &#8220;then  don't explain it to me. Your word is good enough, Harry. Go ahead and  do what you want to do. I'll ask nothing about any of your actions, no  matter how strange it may look.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're a man in a million, George. Come on, your confidence is  going to be tested. Besides, you'll run the danger of being shot.&#8221;
  But Dalton followed him fearlessly as he led the way down the alley.  Richmond was not lighted then, save along the main streets, and a few  steps took them into the full dark. The brilliant windows threw bright  bands across the lines, but they themselves were in darkness.
  The alley ran through the next street and so did the Curtis grounds.  They were as extensive in the rear of the house as in front, and  contained small pines carefully trimmed, banks of roses and two grape  arbors. Harry could hear no sound of any one stirring among them, but  people, obviously the cooks and other servants, were talking in the big  kitchen at the rear of the house.
  The street itself running in the rear of the building was as well  lighted as it was in front, but Harry saw no one in it save a member of  the city police, who seemed to be keeping a good watch. But as he did  not wish to be observed by the man he waited a little while in the  mouth of the alley, until he had moved on and was out of sight.
  &#8220;Now, George,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you and I are going to do a little  scouting. You know I'm descended from the greatest natural scout and  trailer ever known in the West, one whose senses were preternaturally  acute, one who could almost track a bird in the air by its flight.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I've heard of the renowned Henry Ware, and I know that you've  inherited a lot of his skill and intuition. Go ahead. I promised that I  would help you and ask no questions. I keep my word.&#8221;
  Harry climbed silently over the low fence, and Dalton followed in  the same manner. The light from the street and house did not penetrate  the pines and rosebushes, where Harry quickly found a refuge, Dalton as  usual following him.
  &#8220;What next?&#8221; whispered Dalton.
  &#8220;Now, I do my trailing and scouting, and you help me all you can,  George, but be sure you don't make any noise. There's enough moonlight  filtering through the pines to show the ground to me, but not enough to  disclose us to anybody twenty feet away.&#8221;
  He dropped to his hands and knees, and, crawling back and forth,  began to examine every inch of ground with minute care, while Dalton  stared at him in amazement.
  &#8220;I'd help,&#8221; whispered Dalton, &#8220;if I only knew what you were doing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose, George, that somebody wanted to see the Curtis house, and  yet not be seen, wanted to observe as well as he could, without  detection, what was going on there. He'd watch his chance, jump over  the fence as we have done and enter this group of pines. He could ask  no finer point of observation. We are perfectly hidden and yet we can  see the whole rear of the house and one side of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;So we can. I infer that you are looking for some one who you think  has been acting as a spy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ah! here we are. The earth is a bit soft by this pine, and I see  the trace of a footstep! And here is another trace, close by it,  undoubtedly the imprint of the other foot. It's as plain as day.&#8221;
  Dalton knelt, looked at the traces, and shook his head. &#8220;I can't  make out any of them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see nothing but a slight  displacement of the grass caused by the wind.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's because you haven't my keen eye, an inherited and natural  ability as a trailer, although you may beat me out of sight in other  things. The shape of these traces indicates that they were made by  human feet, and their closeness together shows that the man stood  looking at the house. If he had been walking along they would be much  wider apart.&#8221;
  He examined the traces again with long and minute care.
  &#8220;The toes point toward the house, consequently he was looking at  it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was a heavy man, and he stood here a long time, not  moving from his tracks. That's why he left these traces, which are so  clear and evident to me, George, although they're hidden from a blind  man like you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing much to you, but a lot to me.&#8221;
  He rose to his feet and examined the boughs of the pine.
  &#8220;As I thought,&#8221; he whispered with great satisfaction. &#8220;Despite his  courage and power over himself, both of which were very great, he  became a little excited. Doubtless he saw something that stirred him  deeply.&#8221;
  &#8220;What under the stars are you talking about, Harry?&#8221;
  &#8220;See, he broke off three twigs of the pine. Just snapped them in two  with nervous fingers. Here are pieces lying on the ground. Now, a man  does that sort of thing almost unconsciously. He will not reach up for  the twig or down for it, but he breaks it because it presents itself to  him at the corner of his eye. This man was six feet in height or more  and built very powerfully. I think I know him! Yes, I'm sure I know  him! Nor is it at all strange that he should be here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shall we make a thorough search for him among the pines? You say  he's tall and built powerfully. But maybe the two of us could master  him, and if not we could call for help.&#8221;
  &#8220;Too late, George. He left a long time ago, and he took with him  what he wanted. We needn't look any farther.&#8221;
  &#8220;Lead on, then, King of Trailers and Master of Secrets! If the  mighty Caliph, Haroun al Kenton, wishes to prowl in these grounds,  seeking the heart of some great conspiracy, it is not for his loyal  vizier, the Sheikh Ul Dalton to ask him questions.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not certain that a vizier is a sheikh.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor am I, but I'm certain that I want to go home and go to bed.  Vikings of the land like ourselves can't stand much luxury. It weakens  the tissues, made strong on the march and in the fields.&#8221;
  They left the grounds silently and unobserved and soon were in their  own quarters, where they slept nearly the whole day. Then they spent  three or four days more in the social affairs which were such a keen  pleasure to them after such a long deprivation. But wherever they went,  and they were in demand everywhere, Harry was always looking for  somebody, a man, tall, heavy and broad shouldered, not a man who would  come into a room where he was, or who would join a company of people  that he had joined, but one who would hang upon the outskirts, and hide  behind the corners of buildings or trees. He did not see the shadow,  but once or twice he felt that it was there.
  The officer, Bathurst, told him one night that some important papers  had been stolen from the White House of the Confederacy itself.
  &#8220;They pertain to our army,&#8221; said Bathurst, &#8220;and they will be of  value to the enemy, if they reach him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm quite certain that the most daring and dangerous of all  northern spies is in Richmond,&#8221; said Harry.
  Then he told Bathurst of Shepard and of the trails that he had seen  among the pines behind Curtis's house.
  &#8220;Do you think this man got our map?&#8221; asked Bathurst.
  &#8220;It may have been so. Perhaps he was hidden in the court and when he  saw us go out, leaving the map on the table, he slipped in at the  window and seized it.&#8221;
  &#8220;But the court was enclosed. He would have had to go with the paper  through the house itself.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's where my theory fails. I can provide for his taking the  paper, but I can't provide for his escape.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell the General about it. I think you're right, Harry. I've  heard of Shepard myself, and he's worth ten thousand men to the  Yankees. It's more than that. At such a critical stage of our affairs  he might ruin us. We'll make a general search for him. We'll rake the  city with a fine tooth comb.&#8221;
  The search was made everywhere. Soldiers pried in every possible  place, but they found nobody who could not give an adequate account of  his presence in Richmond. Harry felt sure nevertheless that Shepard was  somewhere in the capital, protected by his infinite daring and  resource, and they received the startling news the next day after the  search that a messenger sent northward with dispatches for Lee had been  attacked only a short distance from the city. He had been struck from  behind, and did not see his assailant, but the wound in the head&#8212;the  man had been found unconscious&#8212;and the missing dispatches were  sufficient proof.
  A night later precious documents were purloined from the office of  the Secretary of War and a list of important earthworks on the North  and South Carolina coast disappeared from the office of the Secretary  of the Navy. Alarm spread through all the departments of the  Confederacy. Some one, spy and burglar too, had come into the very  capital, and he was having uncommon success.
  Harry had not the least doubt that it was Shepard, and he was filled  with an ambition to capture this man, whom he really liked. If Shepard  were caught he would certainly be hanged, but then a spy must take his  chances.
  They heard meanwhile that General Lee had gone to a former camp of  his on the Opequan, but that later in response to maneuvers by General  Meade, he moved to a position near Front Royal. No orders came for  Harry or Dalton to rejoin him, and, as a period of inactivity seemed to  be at hand, they were glad to remain a while longer in Richmond. They  still stayed with the Lanhams, who refused to take any pay, although  the two young officers, chipping together, bought for Mrs. Lanham a  little watch which had just come through the blockade from England.
  Thus their days lengthened in Richmond, and, despite the shadow of  the spy and his doings which was over Harry, they were still very  pleasant. The members of the Mosaic Club, although older men, made much  of them, and Harry and Dalton, being youths of sprighty wit, were able  to hold their own in such company. The time had now passed into August,  and they sat one afternoon in the lobby of the big hotel with their new  friends. Richmond without was quiet and blazing in the sun. Harry had  received a second letter from his father from an unnamed point in  Georgia. It did not contain much news, but it was full of cheerfulness,  and it intimated in more than one place that Bragg's army was going to  strike a great blow.
  All eyes were turned toward the West. The opinion had been spreading  in the Confederacy that the chief danger was on that line. It seemed  that the Army of Northern Virginia could take care of anything to the  north and east, but in the south and west affairs did not go well.
  &#8220;It's a pity that General Bragg is President Davis' brother-in-law,&#8221;  said Randolph.
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Daniel.
  &#8220;Then he wouldn't be in command of our Western Army.&#8221;
  &#8220;Bragg's a fighter, though.&#8221;
  &#8220;But not a reaper.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;He wins the victory, but lets the enemy take it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may be so. But to come closer home, what about the Yankee spy in  Richmond? It's an established fact that a man of most uncommon daring  and skill is here.&#8221;
  &#8220;No doubt of it, what's the latest from him?&#8221;
  &#8220;The house of William Curtis was entered last night and robbed.&#8221;
  &#8220;Robbed of what?&#8221;
  &#8220;Papers. The man never takes any valuables.&#8221;
  &#8220;But Curtis is not in the government!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, but he carries on a lot of blockade running, chiefly through  Norfolk and Wilmington. I think the papers related to several blockade  running vessels coming out from England, and of course the Yankee  blockading ships will be ready for them. There's not a trace of the man  who took them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Something is deucedly sinister about it,&#8221; said Bagby. &#8220;It seems to  be the work of one man, and he must have a hiding place in Richmond,  but we can't find it. Kenton, you and Dalton are army officers,  supposedly of intelligence. Now, why don't you find this mysterious  terror? Ah, will you excuse me for a minute! I see Miss Carden leaving  the counter with her basket, and there is no other seamstress in  Richmond who can put the ruffles on a man's finest shirt as she can.  She's been doing work for me for some time.&#8221;
  He arose, and, leaving them, bowed very politely to the seamstress.  Her face, although thin and lined, was that of an educated woman of  strong character. Harry thought it probable that she was a lady in the  conventional meaning of the word. Many a woman of breeding and culture  was now compelled to earn her own living in the South. She and Bagby  exchanged only a few words, he returning to his chair, and she leaving  the hotel at a side door, walking with dignity.
  &#8220;I've seen Miss Carden three times before, once on the train, once  at this hotel and once at Mr. Curtis's house; can you tell me anything  about her?&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;It's an ordinary tale,&#8221; replied Bagby. &#8220;I think she lived well up  the valley and her house being destroyed in some raid of the Federal  troops she came down to the capital to earn a living. She's been doing  work for me and others I know for a year past, and I know she's not  been out of Richmond in that time.&#8221;
  The talk changed now to the books that had come through from Europe  in the blockade runners. There was a new novel by Dickens and another  by Thackeray, new at least to the South, and the members of the Mosaic  Club were soon deep in criticism and defense.
  Harry strolled away after a while. He did not tell his  friends&#8212;nothing was to be gained by telling them&#8212;that he was  absolutely sure of the identity of the spy, that it was Shepard. The  question of identity did not matter if they caught him, and his old  feeling that it was a duel between Shepard and himself returned. He  believed that the duty to catch the man had been laid upon him.
  He began to haunt Richmond at all hours of the night. More than once  he had to give explanations to watchmen about public buildings, but he  clung to the task that he had imposed upon himself. He explained to  Dalton and the Virginian found no fault except for Harry's loss of time  that might be devoted to amusement. Harry sometimes rebuked himself for  his own persistency, but Bagby's taunt had stung a little, and he felt  that it applied more to himself than to Dalton. He knew Shepard and he  knew something of his ways. Moreover, his was the blood of the greatest  of all trailers, and it was incumbent upon him to find the spy. Yet he  was trailing in a city and not in a forest. In spite of everything he  clung to his work.
  On a later night about one o'clock in the morning he was near the  building that housed army headquarters, and he noticed a figure come  from some bushes near it. He instantly stepped back into the shadow and  saw a man glance up and down the street, probably to see if it was  clear. It was a night to favor the spy, dark, with heavy clouds and  gusts of rain.
  The figure, evidently satisfied that no one was watching, walked  briskly down the street, and Harry's heart beat hard against his side.  He knew that it was Shepard, the king of spies, against whom he had  matched himself. He could not mistake, despite the darkness, his  figure, his walk and the swing of his powerful shoulders.
  His impulse was to cry for help, to shout that the spy was here, but  at the first sound of his voice Shepard would at once dart into the  shrubbery, and escape through the alleys of Richmond. No, his old  feeling that it was a duel between Shepard and himself was right, and  so they must fight it out.
  Shepard walked swiftly toward the narrower and more obscure streets,  and Harry followed at equal speed. The night grew darker and the rain,  instead of coming in gusts, now fell steadily. Twice Shepard stopped  and looked back. But on each occasion Harry flattened himself against a  plank fence and he did not believe the spy had seen him.
  Then Shepard went faster and his pursuer had difficulty in keeping  him in view. He went through an alley, turned into a street, and Harry  ran in order not to lose sight of him.
  The alley came into the street at a right angle, and, when Harry  turned the corner, a heavy, dark figure thrust itself into his path.
  &#8220;Shepard!&#8221; he cried.
  &#8220;Yes!&#8221; said the man, &#8220;and I hate to do this, but I must.&#8221;
  His heavy fist shot out and caught his pursuer on the jaw. Harry saw  stars in constellations, then floated away into blackness, and, when he  came out of it, found himself lying on a bed in a small room. His jaw  was bandaged and very sore, but otherwise he felt all right. A candle  was burning on a table near him and an unshuttered window on the other  side of the room told him that it was still night and raining.
  Harry looked leisurely about the room, into which he had been wafted  on the magic carpet of the Arabian genii, so far as he knew. It was  small and without splendor and he knew at once from the character of  its belongings that it was a woman's room.
  He sat up. His head throbbed, but touching it cautiously he knew  that he had sustained no serious injury. But he felt chagrin, and a lot  of it. Shepard had known that he was following him and had laid a trap,  into which he had walked without hesitation. The man, however, had  spared his life, although he could have killed him as easily as he had  stunned him. Then he laughed bitterly at himself. A duel between them,  he had called it! Shepard wouldn't regard it as much of a duel.
  His head became so dizzy that he lay down again rather abruptly and  began to wonder. What was he doing in a woman's room, and who was the  woman and how had he got there? This would be a great joke for Dalton  and St. Clair and Happy Tom.
  He was fully dressed, except for his boots, and he saw them standing  on the floor against the wall. He surveyed once more the immaculate  neatness of the room. It was certainly a woman's, and most likely that  of an old maid. He sat up again, but his head throbbed so fearfully  that he was compelled to lie down quickly. Shepard had certainly put a  lot in that right hand punch of his and he had obtained a considerable  percentage of revenge for his defeat in the river.
  Then Harry forgot his pain in the intensity of his curiosity. He had  sustained a certain temporary numbing of the faculties from the blow  and his fancy, though vivid now, was vague. He was not at all sure that  he was still in Richmond. The window still showed that it was night,  and the rain was pouring so hard that he could hear it beating against  the walls. At all events, he thought whimsically, he had secured  shelter, though at an uncommon high price.
  He heard a creak, and a door at the end of the room opened,  revealing the figure and the strong, haggard features of Henrietta  Carden. Evidently she had taken off a hood and cloak in an outer room,  as there were rain drops on her hair and her shoes were wet.
  &#8220;How are you feeling, Mr. Kenton?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;Full of aches and wonder.&#8221;
  &#8220;Both will pass.&#8221;
  She smiled, and, although she was not young, Harry thought her  distinctly handsome, when she smiled.
  &#8220;I seem to have driven you out of your room and to have taken your  bed from you, Miss Carden,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I assure you it was  unintentional. I ran against something pretty hard, and since then I  haven't been exactly responsible for what I was doing.&#8221;
  She smiled again, and this time Harry found the smile positively  winning.
  &#8220;I'm responsible for your being here,&#8221; she said.
  Then she went back to the door and said to some one waiting in the  outer room:
  &#8220;You can come in, Lieutenant Dalton. He's all right except for his  headache, and an extraordinary spell of curiosity.&#8221;
  Dalton stalked solemnly in, and regarded Harry with a stern and  reproving eye.
  &#8220;You're a fine fellow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lady finds you dripping blood  from the chin, and out of your head, wandering about the street in the  darkness and rain. Fortunately she knows who you are, takes you into  her own house, gives you an opiate or some kind of a drug, binds up  your jaw where some man good and true has hit you with all his goodness  and truth, and then goes for me, your guardian, who should never have  let you out of his sight. I was awakened out of a sound sleep in our  very comfortable room at the Lanham house, and I've come here through a  pouring rain with Miss Carden to see you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do seem to be the original trouble maker,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;How did  you happen to find me, Miss Carden?&#8221;
  &#8220;I was sitting at my window, working very late on a dress that Mrs.  Curtis wants to-morrow. It was not raining hard then, and I could see  very well outside. I saw a dark shadow in the street at the mouth of  the alley. I saw that it was the figure of a man staggering very much.  I ran out and found that it was you, Lieutenant Kenton. You were  bleeding at the chin, where apparently some one had struck you very  hard, and you were so thoroughly dazed that you did not know where you  were or who you were.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, he hit me very hard, just as you supposed, Miss Carden,&#8221; said  Harry, feeling gently his sore and swollen chin.
  &#8220;I half led and half dragged you into my house&#8212;there was nowhere  else I could take you&#8212;and, as you were sinking into a stupor, I  managed to make you lie down on my bed. I bound up your wound, while  you were unconscious, and then I went for Lieutenant Dalton.&#8221;
  &#8220;And she saved your life, too, you young wanderer. No doubt of  that,&#8221; said Dalton reprovingly. &#8220;This is what you get for roaming away  from my care. Lucky you were that an angel like Miss Carden saved you  from dying of exposure. If I didn't know you so well, Harry, I should  say that you had been in some drunken row.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, no! not that!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Carden. &#8220;There was no odor of  liquor on his breath.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was merely joking, Miss Carden,&#8221; said Dalton. &#8220;Old Harry here is  one of the best of boys, and I'm grateful to you for saving him and  coming to me. If there is any way we can repay you we'll do it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want any repayment. We must all help in these times.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we won't forget it. We can't. How are you feeling, Harry?&#8221;
  &#8220;My head doesn't throb so hard. The jarred works inside are  gradually getting into place, and I think that in a half-hour I can  walk again, that is, resting upon that stout right arm of yours,  George.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll go. I've brought an extra coat that will protect you  from the rain.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are welcome to stay here!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Carden. &#8220;Perhaps  you'd be wiser to do so.&#8221;
  &#8220;We thank you for such generous hospitality,&#8221; said Dalton gallantly,  &#8220;but it will be best for many reasons that we go back to Mrs. Lanham's  as soon as we can. But first can we ask one favor of you, Miss Carden?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course.&#8221;
  &#8220;That you say nothing of Mr. Kenton's accident. Remember that he was  on military duty and that in the darkness and rain he fell, striking  upon his jaw.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll remember it. Our first impression that he had been struck by  somebody was a mistake, of course. You can depend upon me, both of you.  Neither of you was ever in my house. The incident never occurred.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we're just as grateful to you as if it had happened.&#8221;
  A half-hour later they left the cottage, Miss Carden holding open  the door a little to watch them until they were out of sight. But Harry  had recovered his strength and he was able to walk without Dalton's  assistance, although the Virginian kept close by his side in case of  necessity.
  &#8220;Harry,&#8221; said Dalton, when they were nearly to the Lanham house,  &#8220;are you willing to tell what happened?&#8221;
  &#8220;As nearly as I know. I got upon the trail of that spy who has been  infesting Richmond. I knew at the time that it couldn't have been any  one else. I followed him up an alley, but he waited for me at the turn,  and before I could defend myself he let loose with his right. When I  came drifting back into the world I was lying upon the bed in Miss  Carden's cottage.&#8221;
  &#8220;He showed you some consideration. He might have quietly put you out  of the way with a knife.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shepard and I don't care to kill each other. Each wants to defeat  the other's plans. It's got to be a sort of duel between us.&#8221;
