  When Mukoki and Wabigoon returned half an hour later the hot-stone  biscuits were still unbaked. The fire was only a bed of coals. Beside  it sat Rod, the strange fish upon the ground at his feet. Before Mukoki  had thrown down the pack of meat which he was carrying he was showing  them this fish. Quickly he related what had happened. He added to this  some of the things which he had thought while sitting by the fire. The  chief of these things were that just behind the cataract was the  entrance to a great cavern, and that in this cavern they would not only  find John Ball, but also the rich storehouse of that treasure of which  they, had discovered a part in the pool.
  And as the night lengthened there was little talk about the gold and  much about John Ball. Again and again Rod described the madman's visit,  the trembling, pleading voice, the offering of the fish, the eager glow  that had come into the wild eyes when he talked to him and called him  by name. Even Mukoki's stoic heart was struck by the deep pathos of it  all. The mad hunter no longer carried his gun. He no longer sought  their lives. In his crazed brain something new and wonderful was at  work, something that drew him to them, with the half-fear of an animal,  and yet with growing trust. He was pleading for their companionship,  their friendship, and deep down in his heart Rod felt that the spark of  sanity was not completely gone from John Ball.
  When the three adventurers retired to their blankets in the cedar  shelter it was not the thought of gold that quickened their blood in  anticipation of the morning. The passing of an age would not dull the  luster of what they had come to seek. It would wait for them. The  greatest of all things&#8212;the sympathy of man for man&#8212;had stilled that  other passion in them. John Ball's salvation, and not more gold, was  the day's work ahead of them now.
  With the dawn they were up, and by the time it was light enough to  see they were ready for the exploration of whatever was hidden behind  the fall. In a rubber blanket Wabigoon wrapped a rifle and half a dozen  pine torches. Mukoki carried a quantity of cooked meat. Standing on the  edge of the pool Rod pointed into the falling torrent.
  &#8220;He dived straight under,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The opening to the cavern is  directly behind the shoot of falling water.&#8221;
  Wabi placed his hat and coat upon a rock.
  &#8220;I'll try it first. Wait until I come back,&#8221; he said.
  Without another word he plunged into the pool. Minute after minute  passed, and he did not reappear. Rod was conscious of a nervous chill  creeping into his blood. But Mukoki was chuckling confidently.
  &#8220;Found heem!&#8221; he replied in response to the white youth's inquiring  look.
  As he spoke Wabigoon came up out of the pool like a great fish. Rod  helped him upon the rocks.
  &#8220;We're two bright ones, we are, Muky!&#8221; he exclaimed, as soon as he  gained his breath. &#8220;Just behind the fall I ran up against the wall of  rock we found when we were hunting for John Ball, stood on my feet,  and&#8212;&#8221; he swung his arms suggestively&#8212;&#8220;there I was, head and shoulders  out of water, looking into a hole as big as a house!&#8221;
  &#8220;Dive easy!&#8221; warned the old pathfinder, turning to Rod. &#8220;Bump head  on rock&#8212;swush!&#8221;
  &#8220;We won't have to dive,&#8221; continued Wabi. &#8220;The water directly under  the fall of the stream isn't more than four feet deep. If we wade into  it from over there we can make it easy.&#8221;
  Taking his waterproof bundle the young Indian slipped into the pool  close up against the wall of rock that formed the foundation of the  upper chasm and plunged straight into the tumbling cataract. Mukoki  followed close behind and preparing himself with a long breath Rod  hurried into this new experience. For a moment he was conscious of a  smothering weight upon him and a thunderous roaring in his ears, and he  was borne irresistibly down. There was still air in his lungs when he  found himself safely through the deluge so he knew that its passage had  taken him only a brief but thrilling instant. For a time he could see  nothing. Then he made out a dark form drawing itself up out of the  water. Beyond that there lay a chaos of midnight blackness, and he knew  that his eyes were staring into the depths of a great cavern!
  Gripping the edge of the rock ledge he dragged himself up as both  Wabigoon and Mukoki had done, and found his feet upon a soft floor of  sand. Suddenly he felt a hand clutch his arm. A half-shout, rising  faintly above the wash of the cataract, sounded in his ear.
  &#8220;Look!&#8221;
  He wiped the water from his eyes and gazed ahead of him. For a  moment he saw nothing. Then, so faintly that at first it appeared no  larger than a star, he caught the faint glimmer of a light. As he  looked it became more and more distinct, and to his astonishment he saw  that it was slowly rising, like a huge will-o'-the-wisp that had  suddenly risen from the floor of the cavern to float off into the utter  blackness of space above. And even as he stared, gripping Wabi's arm in  his excitement, the strange light began to descend, and quickly  disappeared!
  The two boys saw Mukoki slip off into the gloom, and without  questioning his motive they followed close behind. As they progressed  the sound of the fall came more and more faintly to their ears. A  blackness deeper than the gloom of the darkest night environed them,  and the three now held to one another's arms. Rod understood why his  companions lighted no torches. Somewhere ahead of them was another  light, carried by the mad hunter. His blood thrilled with excitement.  Where would John Ball lead them?
  Suddenly he became conscious that they were no longer walking on a  level floor of sand but that they were ascending, as the light had  done. Mukoki stopped and for a full minute they stood and listened. The  tumult of the fall came to them in a far, subdued murmur. Beyond that  there was not the breath of a sound in the strange world of gloom about  them. They were about to start on again when something held them, a  whispering, sobbing echo, and Rod's heart seemed to stop its beating.  It died away slowly, and a weird stillness fell after it. Then came a  low moaning cry, a cry that was human in its agony, and yet which had  in it something so near the savage that even Wabigoon found himself  trembling as he strained in futile effort to pierce the impenetrable  gloom ahead. Before the cry had lost itself in the distances of the  cavern Mukoki was leading them on again.
  Step by step they followed in the path taken by the strange light.  Rod knew that they were climbing a hill of sand, and that just beyond  it they would see the light again, but he was not prepared for the  startling suddenness with which the next change came. As if a black  curtain had dropped from before their eyes the three adventurers beheld  a scene that halted them in their tracks. A hundred paces away a huge  pitch-pine torch a yard in length was burning in the sand, and  crouching in the red glow of this, his arms stretched out as if in the  supplication of a strange prayer, was John Ball! Just beyond him was  the gleam of water, inky-black in the weird flickerings of the torch,  and toward this John Ball reached out in his grief. His voice came up  softly to the three watchers now, so low that even in the vast silence  of the cavern it could barely be heard. To Roderick Drew it was as if  the strange creature below him was sobbing like a heart-broken child,  and he whispered in Wabigoon's ear. Then, foot by foot, so gently that  his moccasined feet made no sound, he approached the madman.
  Half-way to him he paused.
  &#8220;Hello, John Ball!&#8221; he called softly.
  The faint light of the torch was falling upon him, and he advanced  another step. The murmuring of the wild man ceased, but he made no  movement. He still knelt in his rigid posture, his arms stretched  toward the black chaos beyond him. Rod came very close to him before he  spoke again.
  &#8220;Is that you, John Ball?&#8221;
  Slowly the kneeling figure turned, and once more Rod saw in those  wild eyes, gleaming brightly now in the torch-light, the softer,  thrilling glow of recognition and returning reason. He reached out his  own arms and advanced boldly, calling John Ball's name, and the madman  made no retreat but crouched lower in the sand, strange, soft sounds  again falling from his lips. Rod had come within half a dozen feet of  him when he sprang up with the quickness of a cat, and with a wailing  cry plunged waist deep into the water. With his arms stretched  entreatingly into the mysterious world beyond the torch-light he turned  his face to the white youth, and Rod knew that he was trying as best he  could to tell him something.
  &#8220;What is it, John Ball?&#8221;
  He went to the edge of the black water and waded out until it rose  to his knees, his eyes staring into the blackness.
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
  He, too, pointed with one arm, and the madman gave an excited  gesture. Then he placed his hands funnel-shaped to his mouth, as Rod  had often seen Wabi and Mukoki do when calling moose, and there burst  from him a far-reaching cry, and Rod's heart gave a sudden bound as he  listened, for the cry was that of a woman's name!
  &#8220;Dol&#8212;o&#8212;res-s-s-s&#8212;Dol&#8212;o&#8212;res-s-s-s&#8212;&#8221;
  The cry died away in distant murmuring echoes, and with an answering  cry Rod shouted forth the name which he fancied John Ball had spoken.
  &#8220;Dolores! Dolores! Dolores!&#8221;
  There came a sudden leaping plunge, and John Ball was at his feet,  clasping him about the knees, and sobbing again and again that  name&#8212;Dolores. Rod put his arms about the old man's shoulders, and the  gray, shaggy head fell against him. The sobbing voice grew lower, the  weight of the head greater, and after a little Rod called loudly for  Mukoki and Wabigoon, for there was no longer movement or sound from the  form at his feet, and he knew that something had happened to John Ball.  The two Indians were quickly at his side, and together they carried the  unconscious form of Ball within the circle of torch-light. The old  man's eyes were closed, his claw-like fingers were clenched fiercely  upon his breast, and not until Mukoki placed a hand over his heart did  the three know that he was still breathing.
  &#8220;Now is our time to get him to camp,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;Lead the way with  the torch, Rod!&#8221;
  There was not much weight to John Ball, and the two Indians carried  him easily. At the fall the rubber blanket was wound about his head and  the adventurers plunged under the cataract with their burden. It was an  hour after that before the old man opened his eyes again. Rod was close  beside him and for a full minute the mad hunter gazed up into his face,  then once more he sank off into that strange unconsciousness which had  overcome him in the cavern. Rod rose white-faced and turned to Mukoki  and Wabigoon.
  &#8220;I'm afraid&#8212;he's dying,&#8221; he said.
  The Indians made no answer. For several minutes the three sat  silently about John Ball watching for signs of returning consciousness.  At last Mukoki roused himself to take a pot of soup from the fire. The  movement seemed to stir John Ball into life, and Rod was at his side  again, holding a cup of water to his lips. After a little he helped the  old man to sit up, and a spoonful at a time the warm soup was fed to  him.
  Through the whole of that day he returned to consciousness only for  brief intervals, lapsing back into a death-like sleep after each  awakening. During one of these periods of unconsciousness Wabi cut  short the tangled beard and hair, and for the first time they saw in  all its emaciation the thin, ghastly face of the man who, half a  century before, had drawn the map that led them to the gold. There was  little change in his condition during the night that followed, except  that now and then he muttered incoherently, and at these times Rod  always caught in his ravings the name that he had heard in the cavern.  The next day there was no change. And there was still none on the  third. Even Mukoki, who had tried every expedient of wilderness craft  in nursing, gave up in despair. So far as they could see John Ball had  no fever. Yet three-quarters of the time he lay as if dead. Nothing but  soup could be forced between his lips.
  On the second day Wabi revisited the subterranean world beyond the  cataract. When he came back he had discovered the secret of the  treasure in the pool. The gold came from the cavern. The soft sand  through which they had followed the strange light was rich in dust and  nuggets. During the floods of spring water came into the cavern from  somewhere, and flowing for a brief space out through the mouth of the  cave brought with it the precious burden of treasure-laden sand which  was dumped into the pool. The constant wash of the cataract had caused  most of the sand to overflow into the running stream, but the heavier  gold-dust and nuggets remained in the trap into which they had fallen.
  But the joy that came of this discovery was subdued by thoughts of  John Ball. The gold meant everything to Rod, the realization of his  hopes and ambitions; and he knew that it meant everything to his  mother, and to all those who belonged to Mukoki and Wabigoon. But the  gold could wait. They had already accumulated a small fortune, and they  could return for the rest a little later. At present they must do  something for John Ball, the man to whom they were indebted for all  that they had found, and to whom the treasure really belonged. On the  third day Rod laid his plans before Wabi and Mukoki.
  &#8220;We must take John Ball back to the Post as quickly as we can,&#8221; he  said. &#8220;It is our only chance of saving him. If we start now, while the  water in the creek is deep enough to float our canoe, we can make  Wabinosh House in ten or fifteen days.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will be impossible to paddle against the swift current,&#8221; said  Wabi.
  &#8220;That is true. But we can put John Ball into the canoe and tow him  up-stream. It will be a long wade and hard work, but&#8212;&#8221;
  He looked at Wabi in silence, then added,
  &#8220;Do we want John Ball to live, or do we want him to die?&#8221;
  &#8220;If I thought he would live I would wade a thousand miles to save  him,&#8221; rejoined the young Indian. &#8220;It means little to us but work. We  know where the rest of the gold is and can return to it within a few  weeks.&#8221;
  If there had been a doubt in the boys' minds as to the right course  to pursue John Ball settled it himself that very afternoon. He awakened  from an unusually long stupor. His eyes were burning with a new light,  and as Rod bent over him he whispered softly, but distinctly,
  &#8220;Dolores&#8212;Dolores&#8212;Where is Dolores?&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is Dolores, John Ball?&#8221; whispered the white youth, his heart  thumping wildly. &#8220;Who is Dolores?&#8221;
  Ball drew up one of his emaciated hands and clasped it to his head,  and a sobbing moan fell from his lips. Then, after a moment, he  repeated, as though to himself,
  &#8220;Dolores&#8212;Dolores&#8212;Who is Dolores?&#8221;
  The Indians had come near, and heard. But John Ball said no more. He  swallowed a few spoonfuls of soup and fell again into his death-like  trance.
  &#8220;Who is Dolores?&#8221; repeated Wabigoon, his face whitening as he looked  at Rod. &#8220;Is there somebody else in the cavern?&#8221;
  &#8220;He is talking of some one whom he probably knew forty or fifty  years ago,&#8221; replied Rod. But his own face was white. He stared hard at  Wabigoon, and a strange look came into Mukoki's face.
  &#8220;Dolores,&#8221; he mused, without taking his eyes from Wabi. &#8220;It's a  woman's name, or a girl's name. We must save John Ball! We must start  for Wabinosh House&#8212;now!&#8221;
  &#8220;While he's unconscious we can tie the rope about him and hoist him  into the upper chasm,&#8221; quickly added Wabigoon. &#8220;Muky, get to work. We  move this minute!&#8221;
  It was still two hours before dusk, and now that they had determined  on returning to Wabinosh House the adventurers lost no time in getting  under way. Wabi climbed the rope that was suspended from the upper  chasm, and that part of their equipment which it was necessary to take  back with them was hoisted up by him. Mukoki sheltered the rest in the  old cabin. John Ball was drawn up last. For an hour after that, until  the gray shadows of night began settling about them, the three waded up  the shallow stream, pulling the canoe and its unconscious burden after  them. That night the madman was not left unwatched for a minute. Mukoki  sat beside him until eleven o'clock. Then Wabi took his turn. A little  after midnight Rod was aroused by being violently pulled from his bed  of balsam boughs.
  &#8220;For the love of Heaven, get up!&#8221; whispered the young Indian. &#8220;He's  talking, Rod! He's talking about Dolores, and about some kind of a  great beast that's bigger than anything that ever lived up here!  Listen!&#8221;
  The madman was moaning softly.
  &#8220;I've killed it, Dolores&#8212;I've killed it&#8212;killed it! Where is  Dolores? Where&#8212;is&#8212;&#8221; There came a deep sigh, and John Ball was quiet.
  &#8220;Killed what?&#8221; panted Rod, his heart thumping until it choked him.
  &#8220;The beast&#8212;whatever it was,&#8221; whispered Wabi. &#8220;Rod, something  terrible happened in that cavern! We don't know the whole story. The  Frenchmen who killed themselves for possession of the birch-bark map  played only a small part in it. The greater part was played by John  Ball and Dolores!&#8221;
  For a long time the two listened, but the old man made no sound or  movement.
  &#8220;Better go back to bed,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;I thought if he was going to  keep it up you would like to hear. I'll call you at two.&#8221;
  But Rod could not sleep. For a long time he lay awake thinking of  John Ball and his, strange ravings. Who was Dolores? What terrible  tragedy had that black world under the mountains some time beheld?  Despite his better reason an indefinable sensation of uneasiness  possessed him as the madman's sobbing out of the woman's name recurred  to him. He spoke nothing of this to Wabi when he relieved him, and he  said nothing of it during the days that followed. They were days of  unending toil, of fierce effort to beat out death in the race to  Wabinosh House.
  For it seemed that the end of time was very near for John Ball. On  the fourth day his thin cheeks showed signs of fever, and on the fifth  he was tossing in delirium. The race now continued by night as well as  by day, only an hour or two of rest being snatched at a time. During  these days John Ball babbled ceaselessly of Dolores, and great beasts,  and the endless cavern; and now the beasts began taking the form of  strange people whose eyes gleamed from out of masses of fur, and who  had hands, and flung spears. On the eighth day the madman sank back  into his old lethargy. On the fourth day after that the three  adventurers, worn and exhausted, reached the shore of Lake Nipigon.  Thirty miles across the lake was Wabinosh House, and it was decided  that Mukoki and Rod should leave for assistance, while Wabigoon  remained with John Ball. The two rolled themselves in their blankets  immediately after supper, and after three hours' sleep were awakened by  the young Indian. All that night they paddled with only occasional  moments of rest. The sun was just rising over the forests when they  grounded their canoe close to the Post. As Rod sprang ashore he saw a  figure walk slowly out from the edge of the forest an eighth of a mile  away. Even at that distance he recognized Minnetaki! He looked at the  sharp-eyed Mukoki. He, too, had seen and recognized the girl.
  &#8220;Muky, I'm going along in the edge of the woods and give her a  surprise,&#8221; said Rod courageously. &#8220;Will you wait here?&#8221;
  Mukoki grinned a nodding assent, and the youth darted into the edge  of the forest. He was breathless when he came up a hundred yards behind  the girl, screened from view by the trees. Softly he whistled. It was a  signal that Minnetaki had taught him on his first trip into the North,  and he knew of only two who used it in all that Northland, and those  two were the Indian maiden and himself. The girl turned as she heard  the trilling note, and Rod drew himself farther back. He whistled  again, more loudly than before, and Minnetaki came hesitatingly toward  the forest's edge, and when he whistled a third time there came a timid  response from her, as if she recognized and yet doubted the notes that  floated to her from the shadows of the balsams.
  Again Rod whistled, laughing as he drew a little farther back, and  again Minnetaki answered, peering in among the trees. He saw the  wondering, half-expectant glow in her eyes, and suddenly crying out her  name he sprang from his concealment. With a little cry of joy and with  hands outstretched Minnetaki ran to meet him.
