  In the astonishment with which Mary's unexpected presence confused  him for a moment, Alan stood at the edge of the trap, staring down at  her pale face, heedless of the terrific gun-fire that was assailing the  cabin. That she had not gone with Keok and Nawadlook, but had come back  to him, filled him with instant dread, for the precious minutes he had  fought for were lost, and the priceless time gained during the parley  with Rossland counted for nothing.
  She saw his disappointment and his danger, and sprang up to seize  his hand and pull him down beside her.
  &#8220;Of course you didn't expect me to go,&#8221; she said, in a voice that no  longer trembled or betrayed excitement. &#8220;You didn't want me to be a  coward. My place is with you.&#8221;
  He could make no answer to that, with her beautiful eyes looking at  him as they were, but he felt his heart grow warmer and something rise  up chokingly in his throat.
  &#8220;Sokwenna is dead, and Rossland lies out there&#8212;shot under a flag of  truce,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can't have many minutes left to us.&#8221;
  He was looking at the square of light where the tunnel from the  cellar-pit opened into the ravine. He had planned to escape through  it&#8212;alone&#8212;and keep up a fight in the open, but with Mary at his side  it would be a desperate gantlet to run.
  &#8220;Where are Keok and Nawadlook?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;On the tundra, hurrying for the mountains. I told them it was your  plan that I should return to you. When they doubted, I threatened to  give myself up unless they did as I commanded them. And&#8212;Alan&#8212;the  ravine is filled with the rain-mist, and dark&#8212;&#8221; She was holding his  free hand closely to her breast.
  &#8220;It is our one chance,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;And aren't you glad&#8212;a little glad&#8212;that I didn't run away without  you?&#8221;
  Even then he saw the sweet and tremulous play of her lips as they  smiled at him in the gloom, and heard the soft note in her voice that  was almost playfully chiding; and the glory of her love as she had  proved it to him there drew from him what he knew to be the truth.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;I am glad. It is strange that I should be so happy in a moment  like this. If they will give us a quarter of an hour&#8212;&#8221;
  He led the way quickly to the square of light and was first to creep  forth into the thick mist. It was scarcely rain, yet he could feel the  wet particles of it, and through this saturated gloom whining bullets  cut like knives over his head. The blazing cabin illumined the open on  each side of Sokwenna's place, but deepened the shadows in the ravine,  and a few seconds later they stood hand in hand in the blanket of fog  that hid the coulee.
  Suddenly the shots grew scattering above them, then ceased entirely.  This was not what Alan had hoped for. Graham's men, enraged and made  desperate by Rossland's death, would rush the cabin immediately.  Scarcely had the thought leaped into his mind when he heard swiftly  approaching shouts, the trampling of feet, and then the battering of  some heavy object at the barricaded door of Sokwenna's cabin. In  another minute or two their escape would be discovered and a horde of  men would pour down into the ravine.
  Mary tugged at his hand. &#8220;Let us hurry,&#8221; she pleaded.
  What happened then seemed madness to the girl, for Alan turned and  with her hand held tightly in his started up the side of the ravine,  apparently in the face of their enemies. Her heart throbbed with sudden  fear when their course came almost within the circle of light made by  the burning cabin. Like shadows they sped into the deeper shelter of  the corral buildings, and not until they paused there did she  understand the significance of the hazardous chance they had taken.  Already Graham's men were pouring into the ravine.
  &#8220;They won't suspect we've doubled on them until it is too late,&#8221;  said Alan exultantly. &#8220;We'll make for the kloof. Stampede and the  herdsmen should arrive within a few hours, and when that happens&#8212;&#8221;
  A stifled moan interrupted him. Half a dozen paces away a crumpled  figure lay huddled against one of the corral gates.
  &#8220;He is hurt,&#8221; whispered Mary, after a moment of silence.
  &#8220;I hope so,&#8221; replied Alan pitilessly. &#8220;It will be unfortunate for us  if he lives to tell his comrades we have passed this way.&#8221;
  Something in his voice made the girl shiver. It was as if the  vanishing point of mercy had been reached, and savages were at their  backs. She heard the wounded man moan again as they stole through the  deeper shadows of the corrals toward the nigger-head bottom. And then  she noticed that the mist was no longer in her face. The sky was  clearing. She could see Alan more clearly, and when they came to the  narrow trail over which they had fled once before that night it reached  out ahead of them like a thin, dark ribbon. Scarcely had they reached  this point when a rifle shot sounded not far behind. It was followed by  a second and a third, and after that came a shout. It was not a loud  shout. There was something strained and ghastly about it, and yet it  came distinctly to them.
  &#8220;The wounded man,&#8221; said Alan, in a voice of dismay. &#8220;He is calling  the others. I should have killed him!&#8221;
  He traveled at a half-trot, and the girl ran lightly at his side.  All her courage and endurance had returned. She breathed easily and  quickened her steps, so that she was setting the pace for Alan. They  passed along the crest of the ridge under which lay the willows and the  pool, and at the end of this they paused to rest and listen. Trained to  the varied night whisperings of the tundras Alan's ears caught faint  sounds which his companion did not hear. The wounded man had succeeded  in giving his message, and pursuers were scattering over the plain  behind them.
  &#8220;Can you run a little farther?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Where?&#8221;
  He pointed, and she darted ahead of him, her dark hair streaming in  a cloud that began to catch a faint luster of increasing light. Alan  ran a little behind her. He was afraid of the light. Only gloom had  saved them this night, and if the darkness of mist and fog and cloud  gave way to clear twilight and the sun-glow of approaching day before  they reached the kloof he would have to fight in the open. With  Stampede at his side he would have welcomed such an opportunity of  matching rifles with their enemies, for there were many vantage points  in the open tundra from which they might have defied assault. But the  nearness of the girl frightened him. She, after all, was the hunted  thing. He was only an incident. From him could be exacted nothing more  than the price of death; he would be made to pay that, as Sokwenna had  paid. For her remained the unspeakable horror of Graham's lust and  passion. But if they could reach the kloof, and the hiding-place in the  face of the cliff, they could laugh at Graham's pack of beasts while  they waited for the swift vengeance that would come with Stampede and  the herdsmen.
  He watched the sky. It was clearing steadily. Even the mists in the  hollows were beginning to melt away, and in place of their dissolution  came faintly rose-tinted lights. It was the hour of dawn; the sun sent  a golden glow over the disintegrating curtain of gloom that still lay  between it and the tundras, and objects a hundred paces away no longer  held shadow or illusionment.
  The girl did not pause, but continued to run lightly and with  surprising speed, heeding only the direction which he gave her. Her  endurance amazed him. And he knew that without questioning him she had  guessed the truth of what lay behind them. Then, all at once, she  stopped, swayed like a reed, and would have fallen if his arms had not  caught her.
  &#8220;Splendid!&#8221; he cried.
  She lay gasping for breath, her face against his breast. Her heart  was a swiftly beating little dynamo.
  They had gained the edge of a shallow ravine that reached within  half a mile of the kloof. It was this shelter he had hoped for, and  Mary's splendid courage had won it for them.
  He picked her up in his arms and carried her again, as he had  carried her through the nigger-head bottom. Every minute, every foot of  progress, counted now. Range of vision was widening. Pools of sunlight  were flecking the plains. In another quarter of an hour moving objects  would be distinctly visible a mile away.
  With his precious burden in his arms, her lips so near that he could  feel their breath, her heart throbbing, he became suddenly conscious of  the incongruity of the bird-song that was wakening all about them. It  seemed inconceivable that this day, glorious in its freshness, and  welcomed by the glad voice of all living things, should be a day of  tragedy, of horror, and of impending doom for him. He wanted to shout  out his protest and say that it was all a lie, and it seemed absurd  that he should handicap himself with the weight and inconvenient bulk  of his rifle when his arms wanted to hold only that softer treasure  which they bore.
  In a little while Mary was traveling at his side again. And from  then on he climbed at intervals to the higher swellings of the gully  edge and scanned the tundra. Twice he saw men, and from their movements  he concluded their enemies believed they were hidden somewhere on the  tundra not far from the range-houses.
  Three-quarters of an hour later they came to the end of the shallow  ravine, and half a mile of level plain lay between them and the kloof.  For a space they rested, and in this interval Mary smoothed her long  hair and plaited it in two braids. In these moments Alan encouraged  her, but he did not lie. He told her the half-mile of tundra was their  greatest hazard, and described the risks they would run. Carefully he  explained what she was to do under certain circumstances. There was  scarcely a chance they could cross it unobserved, but they might be so  far ahead of the searchers that they could beat them out to the kloof.  If enemies appeared between them and the kloof, it would be necessary  to find a dip or shelter of rock, and fight; and if pursuers from  behind succeeded in out-stripping them in the race, she was to continue  in the direction of the kloof as fast as she could go, while he  followed more slowly, holding Graham's men back with his rifle until  she reached the edge of the gorge. After that he would come to her as  swiftly as he could run.
  They started. Within five minutes they were on the floor of the  tundra. About them in all directions stretched the sunlit plains. Half  a mile back toward the range were moving figures; farther west were  others, and eastward, almost at the edge of the ravine, were two men  who would have discovered them in another moment if they had not  descended into the hollow. Alan could see them kneeling to drink at the  little coulee which ran through it.
  &#8220;Don't hurry,&#8221; he said, with a sudden swift thought. &#8220;Keep parallel  with me and a distance away. They may not discover you are a woman and  possibly may think we are searchers like themselves. Stop when I stop.  Follow my movements.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir!&#8221;
  Now, in the sunlight, she was not afraid. Her cheeks were flushed,  her eyes bright as stars as she nodded at him. Her face and hands were  soiled with muck-stain, her dress spotted and torn, and looking at her  thus Alan laughed and cried out softly:
  &#8220;You beautiful little vagabond!&#8221;
  She sent the laugh back, a soft, sweet laugh to give him courage,  and after that she watched him closely, falling in with his scheme so  cleverly that her action was better than his own&#8212;and so they had made  their way over a third of the plain when Alan came toward her suddenly  and cried, &#8220;Now,<I> run</I>!&#8221;
  A glance showed her what was happening. The two men had come out of  the ravine and were running toward them.
  Swift as a bird she was ahead of Alan, making for a pinnacle of rock  which he had pointed out to her at the edge of the kloof.
  Close behind her, he said: &#8220;Don't hesitate a second. Keep on going.  When they are a little nearer I am going to kill them. But you mustn't  stop.&#8221;
  At intervals he looked behind him. The two men were gaining rapidly.  He measured the time when less than two hundred yards would separate  them. Then he drew close to Mary's side.
  &#8220;See that level place ahead? We'll cross it in another minute or  two. When they come to it I'm going to stop, and catch them where they  can't find shelter. But you must keep on going. I'll overtake you by  the time you reach the edge of the kloof.&#8221;
  She made no answer, but ran faster; and when they had passed the  level space she heard his footsteps growing fainter, and her heart was  ready to choke her when she knew the time had come for him to turn upon  their enemies. But in her mind burned the low words of his command, his  warning, and she did not look back, but kept her eyes on the pinnacle  of rock, which was now very near. She had almost reached it when the  first shot came from behind her.
  Without making a sound that would alarm her, Alan had stumbled, and  made pretense of falling. He lay upon his face for a moment, as if  stunned, and then rose to his knees. An instant too late Graham's men  saw his ruse when his leveled rifle gleamed in the sunshine. The speed  of their pursuit was their undoing. Trying to catch themselves so that  they might use their rifles, or fling themselves upon the ground, they  brought themselves into a brief but deadly interval of inaction, and in  that flash one of the men went down under Alan's first shot. Before he  could fire again the second had flattened himself upon the earth, and  swift as a fox Alan was on his feet and racing for the kloof. Mary  stood with her back against the huge rock, gasping for breath, when he  joined her. A bullet sang over their heads with its angry menace. He  did not return the fire, but drew the girl quickly behind the rock.
  &#8220;He won't dare to stand up until the others join him,&#8221; he encouraged  her. &#8220;We're beating them to it, little girl! If you can keep up a few  minutes longer&#8212;&#8221;
  She smiled at him, even as she struggled to regain her breath. It  seemed to her there was no way of descending into the chaos of rock  between the gloomy walls of the kloof, and she gave a little cry when  Alan caught her by her hands and lowered her over the face of a ledge  to a table-like escarpment below. He laughed at her fear when he  dropped down beside her, and held her close as they crept back under  the shelving face of the cliff to a hidden path that led downward, with  a yawning chasm at their side. The trail widened as they descended, and  at the last they reached the bottom, with the gloom and shelter of a  million-year-old crevasse hovering over them. Grim and monstrous rocks,  black and slippery with age, lay about them, and among these they  picked their way, while the trickle and drip of water and the  flesh-like clamminess of the air sent a strange shiver of awe through  Mary Standish. There was no life here&#8212;only an age-old whisper that  seemed a part of death; and when voices came from above, where Graham's  men were gathering, they were ghostly and far away.
  But here, too, was refuge and safety. Mary could feel it as they  picked their way through the chill and gloom that lay in the silent  passages between the Gargantuan rocks. When her hands touched their  naked sides an uncontrollable impulse made her shrink closer to Alan,  even though she sensed the protection of their presence. They were like  colossi, carved by hands long dead, and now guarded by spirits whose  voices guttered low and secretly in the mysterious drip and trickle of  unseen water. This was the haunted place. In this chasm death and  vengeance had glutted themselves long before she was born; and when a  rock crashed behind them, accidentally sent down by one of the men  above, a cry broke from her lips. She was frightened, and in a way she  had never known before. It was not death she feared here, nor the  horror from which she had escaped above, but something unknown and  indescribable, for which she would never be able to give a reason. She  clung to Alan, and when at last the narrow fissure widened over their  heads, and light came down and softened their way, he saw that her face  was deathly white.
  &#8220;We are almost there,&#8221; he comforted. &#8220;And&#8212;some day&#8212;you will love  this gloomy kloof as I love it, and we will travel it together all the  way to the mountains.&#8221;
  A few minutes later they came to an avalanche of broken sandstone  that was heaped half-way up the face of the precipitous wall, and up  this climbed until they came to a level shelf of rock, and back of this  was a great depression in the rock, forty feet deep and half as wide,  with a floor as level as a table and covered with soft white sand. Mary  would never forget her first glimpse of this place; it was unreal,  strange, as if a band of outlaw fairies had brought the white sand for  a carpet, and had made this their hiding-place, where wind and rain and  snow could never blow. And up the face of the cavern, as if to make her  thought more real, led a ragged fissure which it seemed to her only  fairies' feet could travel, and which ended at the level of the plain.  So they were tundra fairies, coming down from flowers and sunlight  through that fissure, and it was from the evil spirits in the kloof  itself that they must have hidden themselves. Something in the humor  and gentle thought of it all made her smile at Alan. But his face had  turned suddenly grim, and she looked up the kloof, where they had  traveled through danger and come to safety. And then she saw that which  froze all thought of fairies out of her heart.
  Men were coming through the chaos and upheaval of rock. There were  many of them, appearing out of the darker neck of the gorge into the  clearer light, and at their head was a man upon whom Mary's eyes fixed  themselves in horror. White-faced she looked at Alan. He had guessed  the truth.
  &#8220;That man in front?&#8221; he asked.
  She nodded. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is John Graham.&#8221;
  He heard the words choking in her throat.
  &#8220;Yes, John Graham.&#8221;
  He swung his rifle slowly, his eyes burning with a steely fire.
  &#8220;I think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that from here I can easily kill him!&#8221;
  Her hand touched his arm; she was looking into his eyes. Fear had  gone out of them, and in its place was a soft and gentle radiance, a  prayer to him.
  &#8220;I am thinking of tomorrow&#8212;the next day&#8212;the years and years to  come,<I> with you</I>,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Alan, you can't kill John  Graham&#8212;not until God shows us it is the only thing left for us to do.  You can't&#8212;&#8221;
  The crash of a rifle between the rock walls interrupted her. The  snarl of a bullet followed the shot. She heard it strike, and her heart  stopped beating, and the rigidity of death came into her limbs and body  as she saw the swift and terrible change in the stricken face of the  man she loved. He tried to smile at her, even as a red blot came where  the streak of gray in his hair touched his forehead. And then he  crumpled down at her feet, and his rifle rattled against the rocks.
  She knew it was death. Something seemed to burst in her head and  fill her brain with the roar of a flood. She screamed. Even the men  below hesitated and their hearts jumped with a new sensation as the  terrible cry of a woman rang between the rock walls of the chasm. And  following the cry a voice came down to them.
  &#8220;John Graham, I'm going to kill you&#8212;<I>kill you</I>&#8212;&#8221;
  And snatching up the fallen rifle Mary Standish set herself to the  task of vengeance.
