Wayfarers on the far side of Our Square used to stop before Number 37  and wonder. The little house, it seemed, was making music at them.  "Kleam, kleam, kleam, kleam," it would pipe pleasantly.    
"BHONG! BHONG! BHONG!" solemn and churchly, in rebuke of its own levity.    
"Kung-<i>glang</i>! Kung-<i>glang</i>! Kung-<i>glang</i>! Kung-<i>glang</i>! Kung-<i>glang</i>!"  That was a duet in the middle register.    
Then from some far-off aerie would ring the tocsin of an elfin  silversmith, fast, furious, and tiny:    
"Ping-ping-ping-ping-ping-ping-ping-ping!"    
We surmised that a retired Swiss bell-ringer had secluded himself in our  remote backwater of the great city to mature fresh combinations of  his art.    
Before the Voices came, Number 37 was as quiet a house as any in the  Square. Quieter than most, since it was vacant much of the time and the  ceremonious sign of the Mordaunt Estate, "For Rental to Suitable  Tenant," invited inspection. "Suitable" is the catch in that  innocent-appearing legend. For the Mordaunt Estate, which is no estate  at all and never has been, but an ex-butcher of elegant proclivities  named Wagboom, prefers to rent its properties on a basis of prejudice  rather than profit, and is quite capable of rejecting an applicant as  unsuitable on purely eclectic grounds, such as garlic for breakfast, or  a glass eye.    
How the new tenant had contrived to commend himself to Mr.  Mordaunt-Wagboom is something of a mystery. Probably it was his name  rather than his appearance, which was shiny, not to say seedy. He  encountered the Estate when that incorporated gentleman was engaged in  painting the front door, and, in a deprecating voice, inquired whether  twenty-five dollars a month would be considered.    
"Maybe," returned the Estate, whereupon the stranger introduced himself,  with a stiff little bow, as Mr. Winslow Merivale.    
Mr. Wagboom was favorably impressed with this, as possessing  aristocratic implications.    
"The name," he pronounced, "is satisfactory. The sum is satisfactory. It  is, however, essential that the lessor should measure up in character  and status to the standards of the Mordaunt Estate." This he had adapted  from the prospectus of a correspondence school, which had come to him  through the mail, very genteelly worded. "Family man?" he added briskly.    
"Yes, sir."    
"How many of you?"    
"Two."    
"Wife?"    
"No, sir," said the little man, very low.    
"Son? Daughter? What age?"    
"I have never been blessed with a child."    
"Then who--"    
"Willy Woolly would share the house with me, sir."    
For the first time the Mordaunt Estate noticed a small, fluffy poodle,  with an important expression, seated behind the railing.    
"I don't like dogs," said the Mordaunt Estate curtly.    
"Willy Woolly"--Mr. Winslow Merivale addressed his companion--"this  gentleman does not like dogs."    
The Mordaunt Estate felt suddenly convicted of social error. The feeling  deepened when Willy Woolly advanced, reckoned him up with an appraising  eye, and, without the slightest loss of dignity, raised himself on his  hind legs, offering the gesture of supplication. He did not, however,  droop his paws in the accepted canine style; he joined them, finger tip  to finger tip, elegantly and piously, after the manner of the  Maiden's Prayer.    
The Estate promptly capitulated.    
"Some pup!" he exclaimed. "When did you want to move in?"    
"At once, if you please."    
Before the Estate had finished his artistic improvements on the front  door, the new tenant had begun the transfer of his simple lares and  penates in a big hand-propelled pushcart. The initial load consisted in  the usual implements of eating, sitting, and sleeping. But the burden of  the half-dozen succeeding trips was homogeneous. Clocks. Big clocks,  little clocks, old clocks, new clocks, fat clocks, lean clocks, solemn  clocks, fussy clocks, clocks of red, of green, of brown, of pink, of  white, of orange, of blue, clocks that sang, and clocks that rang,  clocks that whistled, and blared, and piped, and drummed. One by one,  the owner established them in their new domicile, adjusted them, dusted  them, and wound them, and, as they set themselves once more to their  meticulous busy-ness, that place which had for so long been muffled in  quiet and deadened with dust, gave forth the tiny bustle of unresting  mechanism and the pleasant chime of the hours. Number 37 became the  House of Silvery Voices.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Thus came to Our Square, to be one of us, for better or for worse, Mr.  Winslow Merivale, promptly rechristened Stepfather Time. The Bonnie  Lassie gave him the name. She said that only a stepfather could bring up  his charges so badly. For his clocks were both independent and  irresponsible, though through no fault of their own. When they were  wound they went. When they were unwound they rested. Seldom were more  than half of them simultaneously busy, and their differences of opinion  as to the hour were radical and irreconcilable. The big, emphatic  eight-day, opposite the front door, might proclaim that it was eleven,  only to be at once contradicted by the little tinkler on the parlor  mantel, which announced that it was six, thereby starting up the  cathedral case on the stairway and the Grandfather in the dining-room,  who held out respectively for eight and two, while all the time it was  really half-past one. Thence arose in the early days painful  misunderstandings on the part of Our Square, for we are a simple people  and deem it the duty of a timepiece to keep time. In particular we were  befooled by Grandfather, the solemn-voiced Ananias of a clock with a  long-range stroke and a most convincing manner. So that Schepstein, the  note-shaver, on his way to a profitable appointment at 11 A.M., heard  the hour strike (thirty-five minutes in advance of the best professional  opinion) from the House of Silvery Voices, and was impelled to the  recklessness of hiring a passing taxi, thereby reaching his destination  with half an hour to spare and half a dollar to lack, for which latter  he threatened to sue the Mordaunt Estate's tenant. To the credit side of  the house's account it must be set down that MacLachan, the tailor,  having started one of his disastrous drunks within the precincts of his  Home of Fashion, was on his way to finish it in the gutter via the  zigzag route from corner saloon to corner saloon, when the Twelve  Apostles clock in the basement window lifted up its voice and  (presumably through the influence of Peter) thrice denied the hour,  which was actually a quarter before midnight. "Losh!" said MacLachan,  who invariably reacted in tongue to the stimulus of Scotch whiskey,  "they'll a' be closed. Hame an' to bed wi' ye, waster of the priceless  hours!" And back he staggered to sleep it off.    
Then there was the disastrous case of the Little Red Doctor, who set out  to attend a highly interesting consultation at 4 P.M. and, hearing  Grandfather Ananias strike three, erroneously concluded that he had  spare time to stop in for a peek at Madame Tallafferr's gout (which was  really vanity in the guise of tight shoes), and reached the hospital,  only to find it all over and the patient dead.    
"It's an outrage," declared the Little Red Doctor fiercely, "that an old  lunatic can move in here from God-knows-where in a pushcart and play  merry hell with a hard-working practitioner's professional duties. And  you're the one to tell him so, Dominie. You're the diplomat of  the Square."    
He even inveigled the Bonnie Lassie into backing him up in this  preposterous proposal. She had her own grievance against the House of  Silvery Voices.    
"It isn't the way it plays tricks on time alone," said she. "There's one  clock in there that's worse than conscience."    
And she brought her indictment against a raucous timepiece which was  wont to lead up to its striking with a long, preliminary  clack-and-whirr, alleging that twice, when she had quit her sculping  early because the clay was obdurate and wouldn't come right, and had  gone for a walk to clear her vision, the clock had accosted her in these  unjustifiable terms:    
"Clacketty-whirr-rr-rr! Back-to-yer-worr-rr-rrk! Yerr-rr-rr-rr <i>wrong!  wrong! wrong! wrong!"</i>    
"Wherefore," said the Bonnie Lassie, "your appellant prays that you be a  dear, good, stern, forbidding Dominie and go over to Number 37 and ask  him what he means by it, anyway, and tell him he's got to stop it."    
Now, the Bonnie Lassie holds the power of the high, the middle, and the  low justice over all Our Square by the divine right of loveliness and  kindliness. So that evening I went while the Little Red Doctor, as a  self-constituted Committee in Waiting, sat on my bench. Stepfather Time  himself opened the door to me.    
"What might they call you, sir, if I may ask?" he inquired with timid  courtesy.    
"They might call me the Dominie hereabouts. And they do."    
"I have heard of you." He motioned me to a seat in the bare little room,  alive with tickings and clickings. "You have lived long here, sir?"    
"Long."    
From some interminable distance a voice of time mocked me with a subtle  and solemn mockery: "<i>Long. Long. Long</i>."    
My host waited for the clock to finish before he spoke again. As I  afterward discovered, this was his invariable custom.    
"I, too, am an old man," he murmured.    
"A hardy sixty, I should guess."    
"A long life. Might I ask you a question, sir,' as to the folk in this  Square?" He hesitated a moment after I had nodded. "Are they, as one  might say, friendly? Neighborly?"    
I was a little taken aback. "We are not an intrusive people."    
"No one," he said, "has been to see my clocks."    
I began to perceive that this was a sad little man, and to mislike my  errand. "You live here quite alone?" I asked.    
"Oh, no!" said he quickly. "You see, I have Willy Woolly. Pardon me. I  have not yet presented him."    
At his call the fluffy poodle ambled over to me, sniffed at my extended  hand, and, rearing, set his paws on my knee.    
"He greets you as a friend," said my new acquaintance in a tone which  indicated that I had been signally honored. "I trust that we shall see  you here often, Mr. Dominie. Would you like to inspect my  collection now?"    
Here was my opening. "The fact is--" I began, and stopped from sheer  cowardice. The job was too distasteful. To wound that gentle pride in  his possessions which was obviously the life of the singular being  before me--I couldn't do it. "The fact is," I repeated, "I--I have a  friend outside waiting for me. The Little Red Doctor--er--Dr. Smith,  you know."    
"A physician?" he said eagerly. "Would he come in, do you think? Willy  Woolly has been quite feverish to-day."    
"I'll ask him," I replied, and escaped with that excuse.    
When I broke it to the Little Red Doctor, the mildest thing he said to  me was to ask me why I should take him for a dash-binged vet!    
Appeals to his curiosity finally overpersuaded him, and now it was my  turn to wait on the bench while he invaded the realm of the Voices.  Happily for me the weather was amiable; it was nearly two hours before  my substitute reappeared. He then tried to sneak away without seeing me.  Balked in this cowardly endeavor, he put on a vague professional  expression and observed that it was an obscure case.    
"For a man of sixty," I began, "Mr. Merivale--"    
"<i>Who</i>?" interrupted the Little Red Doctor; "I'm speaking of the dog."    
"Have you, then," I inquired in insinuating accents, "become a  dash-binged vet?"    
"A man can't be a brute, can he!" he retorted angrily. "When that  animated mop put up his paws and stuck his tongue out like a child--"    
"I know," I said. "You took on a new patient. Probably gratis," I added,  with malice, for this was one of the Little Red Doctor's notoriously  weak points.    
"Just the same, he's a fool dog."    
"On the contrary, he is a person of commanding intellect and nice social  discrimination," I asserted, recalling Willy Woolly's flattering  acceptance of myself.    
"A faker," asseverated my friend. "He pretends to see things."    
I sat up straight on my bench. "Things? What kind of things?"    
"Things that aren't there," returned the Little Red Doctor, and fell to  musing. "They couldn't be," he added presently and argumentatively.    
Receiving no encouragement when I sought further details, I asked  whether he had called the new resident to account for the delinquencies  of his clocks. He shook his head.    
"I didn't have time," said he doggedly.    
"Time? Why, there's nothing but time in that house."    
The Little Red Doctor chose to take my feeble joke at par. "No time at  all. None of the clocks keep it."    
"How does he manage his life, then?"    
"Willy Woolly does that for him. Barks him up in the morning. Jogs his  elbow at mealtimes. Tucks him in bed at night, for all I know."    
Thus abortively ended Our Square's protest against Stepfather Time and  his House of Silvery Voices. The Little Red Doctor's obscure suggestion  stuck in my mind, and a few nights later I made a second call. Curiosity  rather than neighborliness was the inciting cause. Therefore I ought to  have been embarrassed at the quiet warmth of my reception by both of the  tenants. Interrupting himself in the work of adjusting a new  acquisition's mechanism, Stepfather Time settled me into the most  comfortable chair and immediately began to talk of clocks.    
Good talk, it was; quaint and flavorous and erudite. But my attention  kept wandering to Willy Woolly, who, after politely kissing my hand, had  settled down behind his master's chair. Willy Woolly was seeing things.  No pretense about it. His mournful eyes yearned hither and thither,  following some entity that moved in the room, dimmer than darkness, more  ethereal than shadow. His ears quivered. A muffled, measured thumping  sounded, dull and indeterminate like spirit rapping; it took me an  appreciable time to identify it as the noise of the poodle's tail,  beating the floor. Once he whined, a quick, quivering, eager note. And  still the amateur of clocks murmured his placid lore. It was rather more  than old nerves could stand.    
"The dog," I broke in upon the stream of erudition. "Surely, Mr.  Merivale--"    
"Willy Woolly?" He looked down, and the faithful one withdrew himself  from his vision long enough to lick the master hand. "Does he  disturb you?"    
"Oh, no," I answered, a little confused. "I only thought--it seemed that  he is uneasy about something."    
"There are finer sensibilities than we poor humans have," said my host  gravely.    
"Then you have noticed how he watches and follows?"    
"He is always like that. Always, since."    
His "since" was one of the strangest syllables that ever came to my  ears. It implied nothing to follow. It was finality's self.    
"It is"--I sought a word--"interesting and curious," I concluded lamely,  feeling how insufficient the word was.    
"She comes back to him," said my host simply.    
No need to ask of whom he spoke. The pronoun was as final and definitive  as his "since." Never have I heard such tenderness as he gave to its  utterance. Nor such desolation as dimmed his voice when he added:    
"She never comes back to me."    
That evening he spoke no more of her. Yet I felt that I had been  admitted to an intimacy. And, as the habit grew upon me thereafter of  dropping in to listen to the remote, restful, unworldly quaintnesses of  his philosophy, fragments, dropped here and there, built up the outline  of the tragedy which had left him stranded in our little backwater of  quiet. She whom he had cherished since they were boy and girl together,  had died in the previous winter. She had formed the whole circle of his  existence within which he moved, attended by Willy Woolly, happily  gathering his troves. Her death had left him not so much alone as alien  in the world. He was without companionship except that of Willy Woolly,  without interest except that of his timepieces, and without hope except  that of rejoining her. Once he emerged from a long spell of musing, to  say in a tone of indescribable conviction:    
"I suppose I was the happiest man in the world."    
Any chance incident or remark might turn his thought and speech,  unconscious of the transition, from his favorite technicalities back to  the past. Some comment of mine upon a specimen of that dismal songster,  the cuckoo clock, which stood on his mantel, had started him into one of  his learned expositions.    
"The first cuckoo clock, as you are doubtless aware, sir"--he was always  scrupulous to assume knowledge on the part of his hearer, no matter how  abstruse or technical the subject; it was a phase of his inherent  courtesy--"was intended to represent not the cuckoo, but the blackbird.  It had a double pipe for the hours, 'Pit-weep! Pit-weep!' and  a single--"    
His voice trailed into silence as the mechanical bird of his own  collection popped forth and piped its wooden lay. Willy Woolly pattered  over, sat down before it, and, gazing through and beyond the meaningless  face with eyes of adoration whose purport there was no mistaking,  whined lovingly.    
"When the cuckoo sounded," continued the collector without the slightest  change of intonation, "she used to imitate it to puzzle Willy Woolly. A  merry heart! ... All was so still after it stopped beating. The clocks  forgot to strike."    
The poodle, turning his absorbed regard from the Presence that moves  beyond time and its perishing voices, trotted to his master and nuzzled  the frail hand.    
The hand fondled him. "Yes, little dog," murmured the man. His eyes, sad  as those of the animal, quested the dimness.    
"Why does she come to him and not to me? He loved her dearly, didn't  you, little dog? But not as I did." There was a quivering note of  jealousy in his voice. "Why is my vision blinded to what he sees?"    
"You have said yourself that there are finer sensibilities than ours," I  suggested.    
He shook his head. "It lies deeper than that. I think he is drawing near  her. He used to have a little bark that he kept for her alone. In the  dead of night I have heard him give that bark--since. And I knew that  she was speaking to him. I think that he will go first. Perhaps he will  tell her that I am coming.... But I should be very lonely."    
"Willy's a stout young thing," I asserted, "with years of life before  him."    
"Perhaps," he returned doubtfully. A gleam of rare fun lit up his pale,  vague eyes. "Can't you see him dodging past Saint Peter through the  pearly gates" ("I was brought up a Methodist," he added in apologetic  explanation), "trotting along the alabaster streets sniffing about for  her among all the Shining Ones, listening for her voice amid the sound  of the harps, and when he finds her, hallelujahing with that little bark  that was for her alone: 'Here I am, mistress! Here I am! And <i>he's</i>  coming soon, mistress. Your Old Boy is coming soon.'"    
When I retailed that conversation to the Little Red Doctor, he snorted  and said that Stepfather Time was one degree crazier than Willy Woolly  and that I wasn't much better than a higher moron myself. Well, if I've  got to be called a fool by my best friends, I'd rather be called it in  Greek than in English. It's more euphonious.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
The pair in Number 37 soon settled down to a routine life. Every morning  Stepfather Time got out his big pushcart and set forth in search of  treasure, accompanied by Willy Woolly. Sometimes the dog trotted beneath  the cart; sometimes he rode in it. He was always on the job. Never did  he indulge in those divagations so dear to the normal canine heart.  Other dogs and their ways interested him not. Cats simply did not exist  in his circumscribed life. Even to the shining mark of a boy on a  bicycle he was indifferent, and when a dog has reached that stage one  may safely say of him that he has renounced the world and all its  vanities. Willy Woolly's one concern in life was his master and their  joint business.    
Soon they became accepted familiars of Our Square. Despite the general  conviction that they were slightly touched, we even became proud of  them. They lent distinction to the locality by getting written up in a  Sunday supplement, Willy Woolly being specially photographed therefor, a  gleam of transient glory, which, however it may have gratified our local  pride, left both of the subjects quite indifferent. Stepfather Time  might have paid more heed to it had he not, at the time, been wholly  preoccupied in a difficult quest.    
In a basement window, far over on Avenue D, stood an old and battered  timepiece of which Stepfather Time had heard the voice but never seen  the face. Each of three attempts to investigate with a view to  negotiations had been frustrated by a crabbed and violent-looking man  with a repellent club. Nevertheless, the voice alone had ensnared the  connoisseur; it was, by the test of the pipe which he carried on all his  quests, D in alt, and would thus complete the major chord of a chime  which he had long been building up. (She had loved, best of all,  harmonic combinations of the clock bells.) Every day he would halt in  front of the place and wait to hear it strike, and its owner would peer  out from behind it and shake a wasted fist and curse him with strange,  hoarse foreign oaths, while Willy Woolly tugged at his trouser leg and  urged him to pass on from that unchancy spot. All that he could learn  about the basement dweller was that his name was Lukisch and he owed  for his rent.    
Mr. Lukisch had nothing special against the queer old party who made  sheep's eyes at his clock every day. He hated him quite impartially, as  he hated everybody. Mr. Lukisch had a bad heart in more senses than one,  and a grudge against the world which he blamed for the badness of his  heart. Also he had definite ideas of reprisal, which were focused by a  dispossess notice, and directed particularly upon the person and  property of his landlord. The clock he needed as the instrument of his  vengeance; therefore he would not have sold it at any price to the  sheep-eyed old lunatic of the pushcart, who now, on the eve of his  eviction, stood gazing in with wistful contemplation. Presently he  passed on and Mr. Lukisch resumed his tinkering with the clock's  insides. He was very delicate and careful about it, for these were the  final touches, preparatory to his leaving the timepiece as a memento  when he should quietly depart that evening, shortly before nine. What  might happen after nine, or, rather, on the stroke of nine, was no worry  of his, though it might be and probably would be of the landlord's,  provided that heartless extortioner survived it.    
Having completed his operations, Mr. Lukisch sat down in a rickety chair  and gazed at the clock, face to face, with contemplative satisfaction.  Stepfather Time would have been interested in the contrast between those  two physiognomies. The clock's face, benign and bland, would have  deceived him. But, innocent though he was in the ways of evil, the man's  face might have warned him.    
Something within the clock's mechanism clicked and checked and went on  again. The sound, quite unexpected, gave Mr. Lukisch a bad start. Could  something have gone wrong with the combination? Suppose a premature  release.... At that panic thought something within Mr. Lukisch's bad  heart clicked and checked and did not go on again. The fear in his eyes  faded and was succeeded by an expression of surprise and inquiry.  Whether the inquiry was answered, nobody could have guessed from the  still, unwinking regard on the face of the victim of heart failure.    
By and by a crowd gathered on the sidewalk, drawn by that mysterious  instinct for sensation which attracts the casual and the idle. Two bold  spirits entered the door and stood, hesitant, just inside, awed because  the clock seemed so startlingly alive in that place. Some one sent  upstairs for the landlord, who arrived to bemoan the unjust fates which  had not only mulcted him of two months' rent with nothing to show for it  but a rickety clock, but had also saddled him with a wholly superfluous  corpse. He abused both indiscriminately, but chiefly the clock because  it gave the effect of being sentient. So fervently did he curse it that  Stepfather Time, repassing with Willy Woolly, heard him and entered.    
"And who"--the landlord addressed high Heaven with a gesture at once  pious and pessimistic--"is to pay me fourteen dollars back rent this  dirty beggar owes?"    
"The man," said Stepfather Time gently, "is dead."    
"He is." The landlord confirmed the unwelcome fact with objurgations.  "Now must come the po-liss, the coroner, trouble, and expense. And what  have I who run my property honest and respectable got to pay for it?  Some rags and a bum clock."    
Willy Woolly sniffed at one protruding foot and growled. Dead or alive,  this was not Willy Woolly's kind of man. "Now, now, Willy Woolly!"  reproved his master. "Who are we that we should judge him?"    
"But I don't <i>like</i> him," declared Willy Woolly in unequivocal dog  language.    
"I think from his face that he has suffered much," said the gentle  collector, wise in human pain.    
"Me; I suppose I don't suffer!" pointed out the landlord vehemently.  "Fourteen dollars out. Two months' rent. A bum clock."    
He kicked the shabby case which whizzed and birred and struck five. The  voice of its bell, measured and mellow and pure, was unquestionably D  in alt.    
"My dear sir," said Stepfather Time urbanely, but quivering underneath  his calm manner with the hot eagerness of the chase, "I will buy  your clock."    
A gust of rough laughter passed through the crowd. The injurious word  "nut" floated in the air, and was followed by "Verrichter." The landlord  took thought and hope.    
"It is a very fine clock," he declared.    
"It is a bum clock," Stepfather Time reminded him mildly.    
"Stepnadel, the auctioneer, would pay me much money for it."    
"I will pay you much money for it."    
"How much?"    
"Seven dollars. That is one month's rent that he owed."    
"Two months' rent I must have."    
"One," said Stepfather Time firmly.    
"Two," said the landlord insistently.    
"Urff! Grr--rr--rr--rrff!" said Willy Woolly in emphatic dissuasion.    
Stepfather Time was scandalized. Expert opinion was quite outside of  Willy Woolly's province. Only once in the course of their years together  had he interfered in a purchase. Justice compelled Stepfather Time to  recall that the subject of Willy's protests on that occasion had  subsequently turned out to be far less antique than the worm holes in  the woodwork (artificially blown in with powder) would have led the  unsuspecting to suppose. But about the present legacy there could be no  such question. It was genuine. It was old. It was valuable. It possessed  a seraphic note pitched true to the long-desired chord.    
Extracting a ten-dollar note from his wallet, Stepfather Time waved it  beneath the landlord's wrinkled and covetous nose. The landlord  capitulated. Willy Woolly, sniffing at the clock with fur abristle,  lifted up his voice and wailed. Perhaps his delicate nose had already  detected the faint, unhallowed odor of the chemicals within. He  stubbornly refused to ride back in the cart with the new acquisition,  and was accused of being sulky and childish.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
The relic of the late unlamented Lukisch was temporarily installed in a  high chair before the open window giving on the areaway of Number 37.  There it briefly beamed upon the busy life of Our Square with its bland  and hypocritical face, and there, thrice and no more, it sounded the  passing of the hours with its sweet and false voice, biding the stroke  of nine. Meantime Willy Woolly settled down to keep watch on it and  could not be moved from that duty. Every time it struck the half he  growled. At the hour he barked and raged. When Stepfather Time sought to  draw him away to dinner he committed the unpardonable sin of dog-dom, he  snarled at his master. Turning this strange manifestation over in his  troubled mind, the collector decided that Willy Woolly must be ill, and  therefore that evening went to seek the Little Red Doctor and  his wisdom.    
Together they came across the park space opposite the House of Silvery  Voices in time to witness the final scene.    
The new clock struck the half after eight as they reached the turn in  the path. A long, quavering howl, mingled of rage and desperation,  answered in Willy Woolly's voice.    
"You hear?" said Stepfather Time anxiously to the Little Red Doctor.  "The dog is not himself."    
They saw him rear up against the clock case. He seemed to be trying to  tear it open with his teeth.    
"Willy!" cried his master in a tone such as, I suppose, the well-loved  companion had not heard twice before in his life. "Down, Willy!"    
The dog drooped back. But it was not in obedience. For once he  disregarded the master's command. Perhaps he did not even hear it in the  absorption of his dread and rage. Step by step he withdrew, then rushed  and launched himself straight at the timepiece. Slight though his bulk  was, the impetus of the charge did the work. The clock reeled, toppled,  and fell outward through the window; then--    
From the House of Silvery Voices rose a roar that smote the heavens. A  roar and a belch of flame and a spreading, poisonous stench that struck  the two men in the park to earth. When they struggled to their feet  again, the smoke had parted and the House of Silvery Voices gaped open,  its front wall stripped bodily away. But within, the sound of the busy  industry of time went on uninterrupted.    
Weaving and wobbling on his feet, Stepfather Time staggered toward the  pot calling on the name of Willy Woolly. At the gate he stopped, put  forth his hand, and lifted from the railing a wopsy, woolly fragment, no  bigger than a sheet of note paper. It was red and warm and wet.    
"He's gone," said Stepfather Time.    
The Clock of Conscience took up the tale. "Gone. Gone. Gone," it pealed.    
As the collector would not leave the shattered house, they sent for me  to stay the night with him. A strange vigil! For now it was the man who  followed with intent, unworldly eyes that which I, with my lesser  vision, could not discern. And the Unseen moved swiftly about the  desolate room, low to the floor, and seemed finally to stop, motionless  beneath a caressing hand. I thought to hear that dull, measured thumping  of a grateful tail, but it was only the Twelve Apostles getting ready  to strike.    
Only once that night did Stepfather Time speak, and then not to me.    
"Tell her," he said in an assured murmur, "that I shan't be long."    
"Not-long. Not-long. Not-long. Not-long. Not-long," confirmed  Grandfather from his stance on the stairway.    
In that assurance Stepfather Time fell asleep. He did not go out again  with his pushcart, but sat in the rear room while the Mordaunt Estate in  person superintended the job of putting a new front on the house.    
The night after it was finished I received an urgent telephone call to  come there at once. At the entrance I met the Little Red Doctor  coming out.    
"The clocks have stopped," said he gently.    
So I turned to cross the park with him.    
"I shall certify," said he, "heart disease."    
"You may certify what you please," said I. "But what do you believe?"    
The Little Red Doctor, who prides himself on being a hard-bitted  materialist, glared at me as injuriously as if my innocent question had  been an insult.    
"I don't believe it!" he averred violently. "Do you take me for a  sentimental idiot that I should pin silly labels on my old friend,  Death?" His expression underwent a curious change. "But I never saw such  joy on any living face," he muttered under his breath.

The House of Silvery Voices is silent now. But its echo still lives and  makes music in Our Square. For, with the proceeds of Stepfather Time's  clocks, an astounding total, we have built a miniature clock tower  facing Number 37, with a silvery voice of its own, for memory. The  Bonnie Lassie designed the tower, and because there is love and  understanding in all that the Bonnie Lassie sets her wonder-working hand  to, it is as beautiful as it is simple. Among ourselves we call it the  Tower of the Two Faithful Hearts.    
The silvery voice within it is the product of a paragon among  timepieces, a most superior instrument, of unimpeachable construction  and great cost. But it has one invincible peculiarity, the despair of  the best consulting experts who have been called in to remedy it and,  one and all, have failed for reasons which they cannot fathom. How  should they!    
It never keeps time.
