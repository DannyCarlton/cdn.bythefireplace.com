By 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people are said to be  such and such.    
Quality is a term that is used in many senses. One sort of  quality let us call 'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from  disposition in being more lasting and more firmly established.  The various kinds of knowledge and of virtue are habits, for  knowledge, even when acquired only in a moderate degree, is, it  is agreed, abiding in its character and difficult to displace,  unless some great mental upheaval takes place, through disease or  any such cause. The virtues, also, such as justice,  self-restraint, and so on, are not easily dislodged or dismissed,  so as to give place to vice.    
By a disposition, on the other hand, we mean a condition that is  easily changed and quickly gives place to its opposite. Thus,  heat, cold, disease, health, and so on are dispositions. For a  man is disposed in one way or another with reference to these,  but quickly changes, becoming cold instead of warm, ill instead  of well. So it is with all other dispositions also, unless  through lapse of time a disposition has itself become inveterate  and almost impossible to dislodge: in which case we should  perhaps go so far as to call it a habit.    
It is evident that men incline to call those conditions habits  which are of a more or less permanent type and difficult to  displace; for those who are not retentive of knowledge, but  volatile, are not said to have such and such a 'habit' as regards  knowledge, yet they are disposed, we may say, either better or  worse, towards knowledge. Thus habit differs from disposition in  this, that while the latter in ephemeral, the former is permanent  and difficult to alter.    
Habits are at the same time dispositions, but dispositions are  not necessarily habits. For those who have some specific habit  may be said also, in virtue of that habit, to be thus or thus  disposed; but those who are disposed in some specific way have  not in all cases the corresponding habit.    
Another sort of quality is that in virtue of which, for example,  we call men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly: in fact  it includes all those terms which refer to inborn capacity or  incapacity. Such things are not predicated of a person in virtue  of his disposition, but in virtue of his inborn capacity or  incapacity to do something with ease or to avoid defeat of any  kind. Persons are called good boxers or good runners, not in  virtue of such and such a disposition, but in virtue of an inborn  capacity to accomplish something with ease. Men are called  healthy in virtue of the inborn capacity of easy resistance to  those unhealthy influences that may ordinarily arise; unhealthy,  in virtue of the lack of this capacity. Similarly with regard to  softness and hardness. Hardness is predicated of a thing because  it has that capacity of resistance which enables it to withstand  disintegration; softness, again, is predicated of a thing by  reason of the lack of that capacity.    
A third class within this category is that of affective qualities  and affections. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples of  this sort of quality, together with all that is akin to these;  heat, moreover, and cold, whiteness, and blackness are affective  qualities. It is evident that these are qualities, for those  things that possess them are themselves said to be such and such  by reason of their presence. Honey is called sweet because it  contains sweetness; the body is called white because it contains  whiteness; and so in all other cases.    
The term 'affective quality' is not used as indicating that those  things which admit these qualities are affected in any way. Honey  is not called sweet because it is affected in a specific way, nor  is this what is meant in any other instance. Similarly heat and  cold are called affective qualities, not because those things  which admit them are affected. What is meant is that these said  qualities are capable of producing an 'affection' in the way of  perception. For sweetness has the power of affecting the sense of  taste; heat, that of touch; and so it is with the rest of these  qualities.    
Whiteness and blackness, however, and the other colours, are not  said to be affective qualities in this sense, but -because they  themselves are the results of an affection. It is plain that many  changes of colour take place because of affections. When a man is  ashamed, he blushes; when he is afraid, he becomes pale, and so  on. So true is this, that when a man is by nature liable to such  affections, arising from some concomitance of elements in his  constitution, it is a probable inference that he has the  corresponding complexion of skin. For the same disposition of  bodily elements, which in the former instance was momentarily  present in the case of an access of shame, might be a result of a  man's natural temperament, so as to produce the corresponding  colouring also as a natural characteristic. All conditions,  therefore, of this kind, if caused by certain permanent and  lasting affections, are called affective qualities. For pallor  and duskiness of complexion are called qualities, inasmuch as we  are said to be such and such in virtue of them, not only if they  originate in natural constitution, but also if they come about  through long disease or sunburn, and are difficult to remove, or  indeed remain throughout life. For in the same way we are said to  be such and such because of these.    
Those conditions, however, which arise from causes which may  easily be rendered ineffective or speedily removed, are called,  not qualities, but affections: for we are not said to be such  virtue of them. The man who blushes through shame is not said to  be a constitutional blusher, nor is the man who becomes pale  through fear said to be constitutionally pale. He is said rather  to have been affected.    
Thus such conditions are called affections, not qualities.  In like manner there are affective qualities and affections of  the soul. That temper with which a man is born and which has its  origin in certain deep-seated affections is called a quality. I  mean such conditions as insanity, irascibility, and so on: for  people are said to be mad or irascible in virtue of these.  Similarly those abnormal psychic states which are not inborn, but  arise from the concomitance of certain other elements, and are  difficult to remove, or altogether permanent, are called  qualities, for in virtue of them men are said to be such and  such.    
Those, however, which arise from causes easily rendered  ineffective are called affections, not qualities. Suppose that a  man is irritable when vexed: he is not even spoken of as a  bad-tempered man, when in such circumstances he loses his temper  somewhat, but rather is said to be affected. Such conditions are  therefore termed, not qualities, but affections.    
The fourth sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs  to a thing; and besides this, straightness and curvedness and any  other qualities of this type; each of these defines a thing as  being such and such. Because it is triangular or quadrangular a  thing is said to have a specific character, or again because it  is straight or curved; in fact a thing's shape in every case  gives rise to a qualification of it.    
Rarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be terms  indicating quality: yet these, it would appear, really belong to  a class different from that of quality. For it is rather a  certain relative position of the parts composing the thing thus  qualified which, it appears, is indicated by each of these terms.  A thing is dense, owing to the fact that its parts are closely  combined with one another; rare, because there are interstices  between the parts; smooth, because its parts lie, so to speak,  evenly; rough, because some parts project beyond others.    
There may be other sorts of quality, but those that are most  properly so called have, we may safely say, been enumerated.    
These, then, are qualities, and the things that take their name  from them as derivatives, or are in some other way dependent on  them, are said to be qualified in some specific way. In most,  indeed in almost all cases, the name of that which is qualified  is derived from that of the quality. Thus the terms 'whiteness',  'grammar', 'justice', give us the adjectives 'white',  'grammatical', 'just', and so on.    
There are some cases, however, in which, as the quality under  consideration has no name, it is impossible that those possessed  of it should have a name that is derivative. For instance, the  name given to the runner or boxer, who is so called in virtue of  an inborn capacity, is not derived from that of any quality; for  lob those capacities have no name assigned to them. In this, the  inborn capacity is distinct from the science, with reference to  which men are called, e.g. boxers or wrestlers. Such a science is  classed as a disposition; it has a name, and is called 'boxing'  or 'wrestling' as the case may be, and the name given to those  disposed in this way is derived from that of the science.  Sometimes, even though a name exists for the quality, that which  takes its character from the quality has a name that is not a  derivative. For instance, the upright man takes his character  from the possession of the quality of integrity, but the name  given him is not derived from the word 'integrity'. Yet this does  not occur often.    
We may therefore state that those things are said to be possessed  of some specific quality which have a name derived from that of  the aforesaid quality, or which are in some other way dependent  on it.    
One quality may be the contrary of another; thus justice is the  contrary of injustice, whiteness of blackness, and so on. The  things, also, which are said to be such and such in virtue of  these qualities, may be contrary the one to the other; for that  which is unjust is contrary to that which is just, that which is  white to that which is black. This, however, is not always the  case. Red, yellow, and such colours, though qualities, have no  contraries.    
If one of two contraries is a quality, the other will also be a  quality. This will be evident from particular instances, if we  apply the names used to denote the other categories; for  instance, granted that justice is the contrary of injustice and  justice is a quality, injustice will also be a quality: neither  quantity, nor relation, nor place, nor indeed any other category  but that of quality, will be applicable properly to injustice. So  it is with all other contraries falling under the category of  quality.    
Qualities admit of variation of degree. Whiteness is predicated  of one thing in a greater or less degree than of another. This is  also the case with reference to justice. Moreover, one and the  same thing may exhibit a quality in a greater degree than it did  before: if a thing is white, it may become whiter.    
Though this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if  we should say that justice admitted of variation of degree,  difficulties might ensue, and this is true with regard to all  those qualities which are dispositions. There are some, indeed,  who dispute the possibility of variation here. They maintain that  justice and health cannot very well admit of variation of degree  themselves, but that people vary in the degree in which they  possess these qualities, and that this is the case with  grammatical learning and all those qualities which are classed as  dispositions. However that may be, it is an incontrovertible fact  that the things which in virtue of these qualities are said to be  what they are vary in the degree in which they possess them; for  one man is said to be better versed in grammar, or more healthy  or just, than another, and so on.    
The qualities expressed by the terms 'triangular' and  'quadrangular' do not appear to admit of variation of degree, nor  indeed do any that have to do with figure. For those things to  which the definition of the triangle or circle is applicable are  all equally triangular or circular. Those, on the other hand, to  which the same definition is not applicable, cannot be said to  differ from one another in degree; the square is no more a circle  than the rectangle, for to neither is the definition of the  circle appropriate. In short, if the definition of the term  proposed is not applicable to both objects, they cannot be  compared. Thus it is not all qualities which admit of variation  of degree.    
Whereas none of the characteristics I have mentioned are peculiar  to quality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness can be  predicated with reference to quality only, gives to that category  its distinctive feature. One thing is like another only with  reference to that in virtue of which it is such and such; thus  this forms the peculiar mark of quality.    
We must not be disturbed because it may be argued that, though  proposing to discuss the category of quality, we have included in  it many relative terms. We did say that habits and dispositions  were relative. In practically all such cases the genus is  relative, the individual not. Thus knowledge, as a genus, is  explained by reference to something else, for we mean a knowledge  of something. But particular branches of knowledge are not thus  explained. The knowledge of grammar is not relative to anything  external, nor is the knowledge of music, but these, if relative  at all, are relative only in virtue of their genera; thus grammar  is said be the knowledge of something, not the grammar of  something; similarly music is the knowledge of something, not the  music of something.    
Thus individual branches of knowledge are not relative. And it is  because we possess these individual branches of knowledge that we  are said to be such and such. It is these that we actually  possess: we are called experts because we possess knowledge in  some particular branch. Those particular branches, therefore, of  knowledge, in virtue of which we are sometimes said to be such  and such, are themselves qualities, and are not relative.  Further, if anything should happen to fall within both the  category of quality and that of relation, there would be nothing  extraordinary in classing it under both these heads.
