It was a Sunday afternoon in full July, and a small party was seated  under the spreading mulberry tree on the Monteiths' lawn. General  Claviger was of the number, that well-known constructor of  scientific frontiers in India or Africa; and so was Dean Chalmers,  the popular preacher, who had come down for the day from his London  house to deliver a sermon on behalf of the Society for Superseding  the Existing Superstitions of China and Japan by the Dying Ones of  Europe. Philip was there, too, enjoying himself thoroughly in the  midst of such good company, and so was Robert Monteith, bleak and  grim as usual, but deeply interested for the moment in dividing  metaphysical and theological cobwebs with his friend the Dean, who  as a brother Scotsman loved a good discussion better almost than  he loved a good discourse. General Claviger, for his part, was  congenially engaged in describing to Bertram his pet idea for a  campaign against the Madhi and his men, in the interior of the  Soudan. Bertram rather yawned through that technical talk; he was a  man of peace, and schemes of organised bloodshed interested him no  more than the details of a projected human sacrifice, given by a  Central African chief with native gusto, would interest an average  European gentleman. At last, however, the General happened to say  casually, "I forget the exact name of the place I mean; I think it's  Malolo; but I have a very good map of all the district at my house  down at Wanborough."    
"What! Wanborough in Northamptonshire?" Bertram exclaimed with  sudden interest. "Do you really live there?"    
"I'm lord of the manor," General Claviger answered, with a little  access of dignity. "The Clavigers or Clavigeros were a Spanish  family of Andalusian origin, who settled down at Wanborough under  Philip and Mary, and retained the manor, no doubt by conversion to  the Protestant side, after the accession of Elizabeth."    
"That's interesting to me," Bertram answered, with his frank and  fearless truthfulness, "because my people came originally from  Wanborough before--well, before they emigrated." (Philip, listening  askance, pricked up his ears eagerly at the tell-tale phrase; after  all, then, a colonist!) "But they weren't anybody distinguished--  certainly not lords of the manor," he added hastily as the General  turned a keen eye on him. "Are there any Ingledews living now in  the Wanborough district? One likes, as a matter of scientific  heredity, to know all one can about one's ancestors, and one's  county, and one's collateral relatives."    
"Well, there <i>are</i> some Ingledews just now at Wanborough," the  General answered, with some natural hesitation, surveying the tall,  handsome young man from head to foot, not without a faint touch of  soldierly approbation; "but they can hardly be your relatives,  however remote. . . . They're people in a most humble sphere of  life. Unless, indeed--well, we know the vicissitudes of families--  perhaps your ancestors and the Ingledews that I know drifted apart  a long time ago."    
"Is he a cobbler?" Bertram inquired, without a trace of mauvaise  honte.    
The General nodded. "Well, yes," he said politely, "that's exactly  what he is; though, as you seemed to be asking about presumed  relations, I didn't like to mention it."    
"Oh, then, he's my ancestor," Bertram put in, quite pleased at the  discovery. "That is to say," he added after a curious pause, "my  ancestor's descendant. Almost all my people, a little way back, you  see, were shoe-makers or cobblers."    
He said it with dignity, exactly as he might have said they were  dukes or lord chancellors; but Philip could not help pitying him,  not so much for being descended from so mean a lot, as for being  fool enough to acknowledge it on a gentleman's lawn at Brackenhurst.  Why, with manners like his, if he had not given himself away, one  might easily have taken him for a descendant of the Plantagenets.    
So the General seemed to think too, for he added quickly, "But  you're very like the duke, and the duke's a Bertram. Is he also a  relative?"    
The young man coloured slightly. "Ye-es," he answered, hesitating;  "but we're not very proud of the Bertram connection. They never did  much good in the world, the Bertrams. I bear the name, one may  almost say by accident, because it was handed down to me by my  grandfather Ingledew, who had Bertram blood, but was a vast deal a  better man than any other member of the Bertram family."    
"I'll be seeing the duke on Wednesday," the General put in, with  marked politeness, "and I'll ask him, if you like, about your  grandfather's relationship. Who was he exactly, and what was his  connection with the present man or his predecessor?"    
"Oh, don't, please," Bertram put in, half-pleadingly, it is true,  but still with that same ineffable and indefinable air of a great  gentleman that never for a moment deserted him. "The duke would  never have heard of my ancestors, I'm sure, and I particularly  don't want to be mixed up with the existing Bertrams in any way."    
He was happily innocent and ignorant of the natural interpretation  the others would put upon his reticence, after the true English  manner; but still he was vaguely aware, from the silence that  ensued for a moment after he ceased, that he must have broken once  more some important taboo, or offended once more some much-revered  fetich. To get rid of the awkwardness he turned quietly to Frida.  "What do you say, Mrs. Monteith," he suggested, "to a game of  tennis?"    
As bad luck would have it, he had floundered from one taboo  headlong into another. The Dean looked up, open-mouthed, with a  sharp glance of inquiry. Did Mrs. Monteith, then, permit such  frivolities on the Sunday? "You forget what day it is, I think,"  Frida interposed gently, with a look of warning.    
Bertram took the hint at once. "So I did," he answered quickly.  "At home, you see, we let no man judge us of days and of weeks, and  of times and of seasons. It puzzles us so much. With us, what's  wrong to-day can never be right and proper to-morrow."    
"But surely," the Dean said, bristling up, "some day is set apart  in every civilised land for religious exercises."    
"Oh, no," Bertram replied, falling incautiously into the trap. "We  do right every day of the week alike,--and never do poojah of any  sort at any time."    
"Then where do you come from?" the Dean asked severely, pouncing  down upon him like a hawk. "I've always understood the very lowest  savages have at least some outer form or shadow of religion."    
"Yes, perhaps so; but we're not savages, either low or otherwise,"  Bertram answered cautiously, perceiving his error. "And as to your  other point, for reasons of my own, I prefer for the present not to  say where I come from. You wouldn't believe me, if I told you--as  you didn't, I saw, about my remote connection with the Duke of East  Anglia's family. And we're not accustomed, where I live, to be  disbelieved or doubted. It's perhaps the one thing that really  almost makes us lose our tempers. So, if you please, I won't go  any further at present into the debatable matter of my place of  origin."    
He rose to stroll off into the gardens, having spoken all the time  in that peculiarly grave and dignified tone that seemed natural to  him whenever any one tried to question him closely. Nobody save a  churchman would have continued the discussion. But the Dean was a  churchman, and also a Scot, and he returned to the attack,  unabashed and unbaffled. "But surely, Mr. Ingledew," he said in a  persuasive voice, "your people, whoever they are, must at least  acknowledge a creator of the universe."    
Bertram gazed at him fixedly. His eye was stern. "My people, sir,"  he said slowly, in very measured words, unaware that one must not  argue with a clergyman, "acknowledge and investigate every reality  they can find in the universe--and admit no phantoms. They believe  in everything that can be shown or proved to be natural and true;  but in nothing supernatural, that is to say, imaginary or non-  existent. They accept plain facts: they reject pure phantasies.  How beautiful those lilies are, Mrs. Monteith! such an exquisite  colour! Shall we go over and look at them?"    
"Not just now," Frida answered, relieved at the appearance of  Martha with the tray in the distance. "Here's tea coming." She was  glad of the diversion, for she liked Bertram immensely, and she  could not help noticing how hopelessly he had been floundering all  that afternoon right into the very midst of what he himself would  have called their taboos and joss-business.    
But Bertram was not well out of his troubles yet. Martha brought  the round tray--Oriental brass, finely chased with flowing Arabic  inscriptions--and laid it down on the dainty little rustic table.  Then she handed about the cups. Bertram rose to help her. "Mayn't  I do it for you?" he said, as politely as he would have said it to  a lady in her drawing-room.    
"No, thank you, sir," Martha answered, turning red at the offer,  but with the imperturbable solemnity of the well-trained English  servant. She "knew her place," and resented the intrusion. But  Bertram had his own notions of politeness, too, which were not to  be lightly set aside for local class distinctions. He could not  see a pretty girl handing cups to guests without instinctively  rising from his seat to assist her. So, very much to Martha's  embarrassment, he continued to give his help in passing the cake  and the bread-and-butter. As soon as she was gone, he turned round  to Philip. "That's a very pretty girl and a very nice girl," he  said simply. "I wonder, now, as you haven't a wife, you've never  thought of marrying her."    
The remark fell like a thunderbolt on the assembled group. Even  Frida was shocked. Your most open-minded woman begins to draw a  line when you touch her class prejudices in the matter of marriage,  especially with reference to her own relations. "Why, really, Mr.  Ingledew," she said, looking up at him reproachfully, "you can't  mean to say you think my brother could marry the parlour-maid!"    
Bertram saw at a glance he had once more unwittingly run his head  against one of the dearest of these strange people's taboos; but he  made no retort openly. He only reflected in silence to himself how  unnatural and how wrong they would all think it at home that a  young man of Philip's age should remain nominally celibate; how  horrified they would be at the abject misery and degradation such  conduct on the part of half his caste must inevitably imply for  thousands of innocent young girls of lower station, whose lives he  now knew were remorselessly sacrificed in vile dens of tainted  London to the supposed social necessity that young men of a certain  class should marry late in a certain style, and "keep a wife in the  way she's been accustomed to." He remembered with a checked sigh  how infinitely superior they would all at home have considered that  wholesome, capable, good-looking Martha to an empty-headed and  useless young man like Philip; and he thought to himself how  completely taboo had overlaid in these people's minds every ethical  idea, how wholly it had obscured the prime necessities of healthy,  vigorous, and moral manhood. He recollected the similar though less  hideous taboos he had met with elsewhere: the castes of India, and  the horrible pollution that would result from disregarding them;  the vile Egyptian rule, by which the divine king, in order to keep  up the so-called purity of his royal and god-descended blood, must  marry his own sister, and so foully pollute with monstrous  abortions the very stock he believed himself to be preserving  intact from common or unclean influences. His mind ran back to  the strange and complicated forbidden degrees of the Australian  Blackfellows, who are divided into cross-classes, each of which  must necessarily marry into a certain other, and into that other  only, regardless of individual tastes or preferences. He remembered  the profound belief of all these people that if they were to act in  any other way than the one prescribed, some nameless misfortune or  terrible evil would surely overtake them. Yet, nowhere, he thought  to himself, had he seen any system which entailed in the end so  much misery on both sexes, though more particularly on the women,  as that system of closely tabooed marriage, founded upon a broad  basis of prostitution and infanticide, which has reached its most  appalling height of development in hypocritical and puritan  England. The ghastly levity with which all Englishmen treated this  most serious subject, and the fatal readiness with which even Frida  herself seemed to acquiesce in the most inhuman slavery ever  devised for women on the face of this earth, shocked and saddened  Bertram's profoundly moral and sympathetic nature. He could sit  there no longer to listen to their talk. He bethought him at once  of the sickening sights he had seen the evening before in a London  music-hall; of the corrupting mass of filth underneath, by which  alone this abomination of iniquity could be kept externally decent,  and this vile system of false celibacy whitened outwardly to the  eye like Oriental sepulchres: and he strolled off by himself into  the shrubbery, very heavy in heart, to hide his real feelings from  the priest and the soldier, whose coarser-grained minds could never  have understood the enthusiasm of humanity which inspired and  informed him.    
Frida rose and followed him, moved by some unconscious wave of  instinctive sympathy. The four children of this world were left  together on the lawn by the rustic table, to exchange views by  themselves on the extraordinary behaviour and novel demeanour of  the mysterious Alien.
