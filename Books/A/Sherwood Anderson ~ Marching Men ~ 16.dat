McGregor began to attend some classes at Chicago University and walked  about among the massive buildings, erected for the most part through  the bounty of one of his country's leading business men, wondering why  the great centre of learning seemed so little a part of the city. To  him the University seemed something entirely apart, not in tune with  its surrounding. It was like an expensive ornament worn on the soiled  hand of a street urchin. He did not stay there long.    
One day he got into disfavour with the professor in one of the  classes. He sat in a room among other students, his mind busy with  thoughts of the future and of how he might get his movement of the  marching men under way. In a chair beside him sat a large girl with  blue eyes and hair like yellow wheat. She like McGregor was  unconscious of what was going on about her and sat with half-closed  eyes watching him. In the corners of her eyes lurked a gleam of  amusement. She drew sketches of his huge mouth and nose on a pad of  Paper.    
At McGregor's left with his legs sprawled into the aisle sat a youth  who was thinking of the yellow-haired girl and planning a campaign  against her. His father was a manufacturer of berry boxes in a brick  building on the West Side and he wished he were in school in another  city so that it would not be necessary to live at home. All day he  thought of the evening meal and of the coming of his father, nervous  and tired, to quarrel with his mother about the management of the  servants. Now he was trying to evolve a plan for getting money from  his mother with which to enjoy a dinner at a downtown restaurant. With  delight he contemplated such an evening with a box of cigarettes on  the table and the yellow-haired girl sitting opposite him under red  lights. He was a typical American youth of the upper middle class and  was in the University only because he was in no hurry to begin his  life in the commercial world.    
In front of McGregor sat another typical student, a pale nervous young  man who drummed with his fingers on the back of a book. He was very  serious about acquiring learning and when the professor paused in his  talk he threw up his hands and asked a question. When the professor  smiled he laughed loudly. He was like an instrument on which the  professor struck chords.    
The professor, a short man with a bushy black beard, heavy shoulders  and large powerful eye-glasses, spoke in a shrill voice surcharged  with excitement.    
"The world is full of unrest," he said; "men are struggling like  chicks in the shell. In the hinterland of every man's mind uneasy  thoughts stir. I call your attention to what is going on in the  Universities of Germany."    
The professor paused and glared about. McGregor was so irritated by  what he took to be the wordiness of the man that he could not restrain  himself. He felt as he had felt when the socialist orator talked on  the streets of Coal Creek. With an oath he arose and kicked out his  foot to push his chair away. The pad of paper fell out of the large  girl's lap and scattered its leaves about the floor. A light burned in  McGregor's blue eyes. As he stood in the classroom before the startled  class his head, big and red, had something of nobility about it like  the head of a fine beast. His voice rumbled out of his throat and the  girl looked at him, her mouth standing open.    
"We go from room to room hearing talk," began McGregor. "On the street  corners downtown in the evenings and in towns and villages men talk  and talk. Books are written, jaws wag. The jaws of men are loose. They  wabble about--saying nothing."    
McGregor's excitement grew. "If there is all this unrest why does it  not come to something?" he demanded. "Why do not you who have trained  brains strive to find the secret of order in the midst of this  disorder? Why is something not done?"    
The professor ran up and down on the platform. "I do not know what you  mean," he cried nervously. McGregor turned slowly and stared at the  class. He tried to explain. "Why do not men lead their lives like  men?" he asked. "They must be taught to march, hundreds of thousands  of men. Do you not think so?"    
McGregor's voice rose and his great fist was raised. "The world should  become a great camp," he cried. "The brains of the world should be at  the organisation of mankind. Everywhere there is disorder and men  chatter like monkeys in a cage. Why should some man not begin the  organisation of a new army? If there are men who do not understand  what is meant let them be knocked down."    
The professor leaned forward and peered through his spectacles at  McGregor. "I understand your kind," he said, and his voice trembled.  "The class is dismissed. We deprecate violence here."    
The professor hurried through a door and down a long hallway with the  class chattering at his heels. McGregor sat in his chair in the empty  class room and stared at the wall. As the professor hurried away he  muttered to himself: "What's getting in here? What's getting into our  schools?"

Late on the following afternoon McGregor sat in his room thinking of  what had happened in the class. He had decided that he would not spend  any more time at the University but would devote himself entirely to  the study of law. Several young men came in.    
Among the students at the University McGregor had seemed very old.  Secretly he was much admired and had often been the subject of talk.  Those who had now come to see him wanted him to join a Greek Letter  Fraternity. They sat about his room, on the window sill and on a trunk  by the wall. They smoked pipes and were boyishly eager and  enthusiastic. A glow shone in the cheeks of the spokesman--a clean-  looking youth with black curly hair and round pink--and--white cheeks,  the son of a Presbyterian minister from Iowa.    
"You have been picked by our fellows to be one of us," said the  spokesman. "We want you to become an Alpha Beta Pi. It is a grand  fraternity with chapters in the best schools in the country. Let me  tell you."    
He began reeling off a list of names of statesmen, college professors,  business men and well known athletes who belonged to the order.    
McGregor sat by the wall looking at his guests and wondering what he  would say. He was a little amused and half hurt and felt like a man  who has had a Sunday School scholar stop him on the street to ask him  about the welfare of his soul. He thought of Edith Carson waiting for  him in her store on Monroe Street, of the angry miners standing in the  saloon in Coal Creek plotting to break into the restaurant while he  sat with the hammer in his hands waiting for battle, of old Mother  Misery walking at the heels of the soldiers' horses through the  streets of the mining village, and last of all of the terrible  certainty that these bright-eyed boys would be destroyed, swallowed up  by the huge commercial city in which they were to live.    
"It means a lot to be one of us when a chap gets out into the world,"  the curly-haired youth said. "It helps you get on, get in with the  right people. You can't go on without men you know. You ought to get  in with the best fellows." He hesitated and looked at the floor. "I  don't mind telling you," he said with an outburst of frankness, "that  one of our stronger men--Whiteside, the mathematician--wanted us to  have you. He said you were worth while. He thought you ought to see us  and get to know us and that we ought to see and get to know you."    
McGregor got up and took his hat from a nail on the wall. He felt the  utter futility of trying to express what was in his mind and walked  down the stairs to the street with the file of boys following in  embarrassed silence and stumbling in the darkness of the hallway at  his heels. At the street door he stopped and faced them, struggling to  put his thoughts into words.    
"I can't do what you ask," he said. "I like you and like your asking  me to come in with you, but I'm going to quit the University." His  voice softened. "I would like to have you for friends," he added. "You  say a man needs to know people after awhile. Well, I would like to  know you while you are what you are now. I don't want to know you  after you become what you will become."    
McGregor turned and ran down the remaining steps to the stone sidewalk  and went rapidly up the street. A stern hard look was in his face and  he knew he would spend a silent night thinking of what had happened.  "I hate hitting boys," he thought as he hurried away to his evening's  work at the restaurant.
