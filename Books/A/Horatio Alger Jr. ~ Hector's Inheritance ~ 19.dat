    It was generally after vespers that Mr. Smith communicated to the   school anything which he desired to call to their attention. This  was  to be the occasion of bringing our hero into disgrace. 
  The boys assembled, most of them quite ignorant that anything   exceptional was to occur. Hector himself, the person chiefly   interested, was entirely unconscious that he was to be made &quot;a   shining mark&quot; for the arrows of suspicion and obloquy. If he had   noticed the peculiar and triumphantly malicious looks with which Jim   Smith, the bully and tyrant, whom he had humiliated and deposed,   regarded him, he might have been led to infer that some misfortune   was in store for him. But these looks he did not chance to notice. 
  There were two other boys, however, who did notice them. These were   Ben Platt and Wil-kins, who had very good reasons, as we know, for   doing so. 
  &quot;I believe old Sock is going to pitch into Roscoe at vespers,&quot; said   Ben, in a whisper, to his roommate. 
  &quot;So do I. There's a look about him like that of a tiger about to   pounce on his prey.&quot; 
  &quot;Or a cat with murderous designs on a mouse.&quot; 
  &quot;We must expose the whole thing.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course.&quot; 
  &quot;Won't Jim be mad?&quot; 
  &quot;Let him! He won't dare to thrash us while Roscoe is round.&quot; 
  There was, indeed, about Socrates Smith an air of mystery,   portentous and suggestive. He looked like one meditating a coup   d'etat, or, perhaps, it might better be said, a coup de main, as the   hand is with schoolmasters, generally, the instrument of attack. 
  When the proper time arrived, Mr. Smith cleared his throat, as he   always did before beginning to speak. 
  &quot;Boys,&quot; he said, &quot;I have an important, and I may say, a painful,   communication to make to you.&quot; 
  All the boys looked at each other in curiosity, except the three  who  were already in the secret. 
  &quot;You know, boys,&quot; continued Socrates, &quot;how proud I am of this   institute, how zealous I am for its good reputation, how unwearied I   am in my efforts for your progress and welfare.&quot; 
  Mr. Smith's unwearied efforts were largely in the line of making  out  and receipting bills for tuition, and it may be said that this was   to him by far the most agreeable of the duties he undertook to   perform. 
  &quot;I have been proud of my pupils,&quot; continued the principal, &quot;and it   has given me pleasure to reflect that you all reflected credit, more   or less, upon my teaching. I have, also, sought to form your  manners,  to train you to fill the positions which Providence may  have in store  for you. In a word, while from time to time you may  have indulged in  little escapades, slightly-culpable, I have felt  that you were all  gentlemen.&quot; 
  &quot;What in the world does he mean?&quot; thought more than one puzzled  boy.  &quot;What is all this leading to?&quot; 
  Among those to whom this thought occurred, was Hector Roscoe, who   was very far from conjecturing that all this long preamble was to   introduce an attack upon him. 
  &quot;But,&quot; proceeded Socrates, after a pause, &quot;I have this afternoon   been painfully undeceived. I have learned, with inexpressible pain,   that Smith Institute has received an ineffaceable stigma.&quot; 
  &quot;Old Sock is getting eloquent!&quot; whispered Ben Platt. 
  &quot;I have learned,&quot; continued Socrates, with tragic intensity, &quot;that  I  have nourished a viper in my bosom! I have learned that we have a   thief among us!&quot; 
  This declaration was greeted with a buzz of astonishment. Each boy   looked at his next door neighbor as if to inquire, &quot;Is it you?&quot; 
  Each one, except the three who were behind the scenes. Of these,  Jim  Smith, with an air of supreme satisfaction, looked in a sidelong  way  at Hector, unconscious the while that two pairs of eyes&#8212;those of   Wilkins and Ben Platt&#8212;were fixed upon him. 
  &quot;I thought you would be surprised,&quot; said the principal, &quot;except, of   course, the miserable criminal. But I will not keep you in suspense.   To-day, by inadvertence, I left my wallet, containing a considerable   sum of money, on the bureau in my chamber. An hour later,  discovering  my loss, I went upstairs, but the wallet was gone. It  had mysteriously  disappeared. I was at a loss to understand this at  first, but I soon  found a clew. I ascertained that a boy&#8212;a boy who  is presently one of  the pupils of Smith Institute&#8212;had entered my  chamber, had  appropriated the wallet, had carried it to his  dormitory, and there  had slyly concealed it in the pocket of a pair  of pants. Doubtless, he  thought his theft would not be discovered,  but it was, and I myself  discovered the missing wallet in its place  of concealment.&quot; 
  Here Mr. Smith paused, and it is needless to say that the  schoolroom  was a scene of great excitement. His tone was so  impressive, and his  statement so detailed, that no one could doubt  that he had most  convincing evidence of the absolute accuracy of what  he said. 
  &quot;Who was it?&quot; every boy had it on his lips to inquire. 
  &quot;Three hours have elapsed since my discovery,&quot; continued Mr. Smith.   &quot;During that time I have felt unnerved. I have, however, written and   posted an account of this terrible discovery to the friends of the   pupil who has so disgraced himself and the school.&quot; 
  Ben Platt and Wilkins exchanged glances of indignation. They felt   that Mr. Smith had been guilty of a piece of outrageous injustice in   acting thus before he had apprised the supposed offender of the   charge against him, and heard his defense. Both boys decided that   they would not spare Jim Smith, but at all hazards expose the   contemptible plot which he had contrived against his schoolfellow. 
  &quot;I waited, however, till I was somewhat more calm before laying the   matter before you. I know you will all be anxious to know the name  of  the boy who has brought disgrace upon the school to which you  belong,  and I am prepared to reveal it to you. Hector Roscoe, stand  up!&quot; 
  If a flash of lightning had struck him where he sat, Hector could   not have been more astonished. For a moment he was struck dumb, and   did not move. 
  &quot;Stand up, Hector Roscoe!&quot; repeated the principal. &quot;No wonder you   sit there as if paralyzed. You did not expect that so soon your sin   would find you out.&quot; 
  Then Hector recovered completely his self-possession. He sprang to   his feet, and not only that, but he strode forward, blazing with   passion, till he stood before Mr. Smith's desk and confronted him. 
  &quot;Mr. Smith!&quot; he said, in a ringing tone, &quot;do I understand you to   charge me with stealing a wallet of yours containing money?&quot; 
  &quot;I do so charge you, and I have complete evidence of the truth of  my  charge. What have you to say?&quot; 
  &quot;What have I to say?&quot; repeated Hector, looking around him proudly   and scornfully. &quot;I have to say that it is an infamous lie!&quot; 
  &quot;Hold, sir!&quot; exclaimed Socrates, angrily. &quot;Shameless boy, do you   intend to brazen it out? Did I not tell you that I had complete  proof  of the truth of the charge?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't care what fancied proof you have. I denounce the charge as   a lie.&quot; 
  &quot;That won't do, sir! I myself took the wallet from the pocket of   your pantaloons, hanging in the chamber. Mrs. Smith was with me and   witnessed my discovery, and there was another present, one of the   pupils of this institute, who also can testify to the fact. It is   useless for you to deny it!&quot; 
  &quot;You found the wallet in the pocket of my pantaloons?&quot; asked  Hector,  slowly. 
  &quot;Yes. There can be no doubt about that.&quot; 
  &quot;Who put it there?&quot; demanded Hector, quickly. 
  Socrates Smith was staggered, for he had not expected this query   from the accused. 
  &quot;Who put it there?&quot; he repeated. 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; continued Hector, firmly. &quot;If the matter is as you  state  it, some one has been mean enough to put the wallet into my  pocket  in order to implicate me in a theft.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course you put it there yourself, Roscoe. Your defense is very   lame.&quot; 
  Hector turned round to his fellow-scholars. 
  &quot;Boys,&quot; he said, &quot;you have heard the charge that has been made   against me. You know me pretty well by this time. Is there any one  of  you that believes it to be true?&quot; 
  &quot;No! No!&quot; shouted the boys, with one exception. Jim Smith was heard   to say distinctly, &quot;I believe it!&quot; 
  &quot;Silence in the school!&quot; shouted Socrates. &quot;This is altogether   irregular, and I won't have it.&quot; 
  Hector turned to the principal, and said, calmly: 
  &quot;You see, Mr. Smith, that, in spite of your proof, these boys will   not believe that your charge is well founded.&quot; 
  &quot;That is neither here nor there, Roscoe. Will anyone step up and   prove your innocence?&quot; 
  There was another sensation. In the second row back a boy was seen   to rise. 
  &quot;Mr. Smith,&quot; said Ben Platt, &quot;I can prove Roscoe's innocence!&quot;
