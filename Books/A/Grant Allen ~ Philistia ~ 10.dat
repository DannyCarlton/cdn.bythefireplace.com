May, beautiful May, had brought the golden flowers, and the trees  in the valley behind the sleepy old town of Calcombe Pomeroy were  decking themselves in the first wan green of their early spring  foliage. The ragged robins were hanging out, pinky red, from the  hedgerows; the cuckoo was calling from the copse beside the mill  stream; and the merry wee hedge-warblers were singing lustily from  the topmost sprays of hawthorn, with their full throats bursting  tremulously in the broad sunshine. And Ernest Le Breton, too,  filled with the season, had come down from Dunbude for a fortnight's  holiday, on his premised visit to his friend Oswald, or, to say  the truth more plainly, to Oswald's pretty little sister Edie. For  Ernest had fully made up his mind by this time what it was he had  come for, and he took the earliest possible opportunity of taking  a walk with Edie alone, through the tiny glen behind the town, where  the wee stream tumbles lazily upon the big slow-turning vanes of  the overshot mill-wheel.    
'Let us sit down a bit on the bank here, Miss Oswald,' he said to  his airy little companion, as they reached the old stone bridge that  crosses the stream just below the mill-house; 'it's such a lovely  day one feels loath to miss any of it, and the scenery here looks  so bright and cheerful after the endless brown heather and russet  bracken about Dunbude. Not that Exmoor isn't beautiful in its way,  too--all Devonshire is beautiful alike for that matter; but then  it's more sombre and woody in the north, and much less spring-like  than this lovely quiet South Devon country.'    
'I'm so glad you like Calcombe,' Edie said, with one of her unfailing  blushes at the indirect flattery to herself implied in praise of  her native county; 'and you think it prettier than Dunbude, then,  do you?'    
'Prettier in its own way, yes, though not so grand of course;  everything here is on a smaller scale. Dunbude, you know, is almost  mountainous.'    
'And the Castle?' Edie asked, bringing round the conversation to  her own quarter, 'is that very fine? At all like Warwick, or our  dear old Arlingford?'    
'Oh, it isn't a castle at all, really,' Ernest answered; 'only  a very big and ugly house. As architecture it's atrocious, though  it's comfortable enough inside for a place of the sort.'    
'And the Exmoors, are they nice people? What kind of girl is Lady  Hilda, now?' Poor little Edie? she asked the question shyly, but  with a certain deep beating in her heart, for she had often canvassed  with herself the vague possibility that Ernest might actually fall  in love with Lady Hilda. Had he fallen in love with her already,  or had he not? She knew she would be able to guess the truth by his  voice and manner the moment he answered her. No man can hide that  secret from a woman who loves him. Yet it was not without a thrill  and a flutter that she asked him, for she thought to herself, what  must she seem to him after all the grand people he had been mixing  with so lately at Dunbude? Was it possible he could see anything  in her, a little country village girl, coming to her fresh from  the great ladies of that unknown and vaguely terrible society?    
'Lady Hilda!' Ernest answered, laughing--and as he said the words  Edie knew in her heart that her question was answered, and blushed  once more in her bewitching fashion. 'Lady Hilda! Oh, she's a  very queer girl, indeed; she's not at all clever, really, but she  has the one virtue of girls of her class--their perfect frankness.  She's frank all over--no reserve or reticence at all about her.  Whatever she thinks she says, without the slightest idea that you'll  see anything to laugh at or to find fault with in it. In matters  of knowledge, she's frankly ignorant. In matters of taste, she's  frankly barbaric. In matters of religion, she's frankly heathen. And  in matters of ethics, she's frankly immoral--or rather extra-moral,'  he added, quickly correcting himself for the misleading expression.    
'I shouldn't think from your description she can be a very  nice person,' Edie said, greatly relieved, and pulling a few tall  grasses at her side by way of hiding her interest in the subject.  'She can't be a really nice girl if she's extra-moral, as you call  it.'    
'Oh, I don't mean she'd cut one's throat or pick one's pocket,  you know,' Ernest went on quickly, with a gentle smile. 'She's got  a due respect for the ordinary conventional moralities like other  people, no doubt; but in her case they're only social prejudices,  not genuine ethical principles. I don't suppose she ever seriously  asked herself whether anything was right or wrong or not in her  whole lifetime. In fact, I'm sure she never did; and if anybody  else were to do so, she'd be immensely surprised and delighted at  the startling originality and novelty of thought displayed in such  a view of the question.'    
'But she's very handsome, isn't she?' Edie asked, following up  her inquiry with due diligence.    
'Handsome? oh, yes, in a bold sort of actress fashion. Very handsome,  but not, to me at least, pleasing. I believe most men admire her a  great deal; but she lacks a feminine touch dreadfully. She dashes  away through everything as if she was hunting; and she <i>does</i> hunt  too, which I think bad enough in anybody, and horrible in a woman.'    
'Then you haven't fallen in love with her, Mr. Le Breton? I half  imagined you would, you know, as I'm told she's so very attractive.'    
'Fallen in love with <i>her</i>, Miss Oswald! Fallen in love with Hilda  Tregellis! What an absurd notion! Heaven forbid it!'    
'Why so, please?'    
'Why, in the first place, what would be the use of it? Fancy Lady  Exmoor's horror at the bare idea of her son's tutor falling in love  with Lady Hilda! I assure you, Miss Oswald, she would evaporate at  the very mention of such an unheard-of enormity. A man must be, if  not an earl, at least a baronet with five thousand a year, before  he dare face the inexpressible indignation of Lady Exmoor with an  offer of marriage for Lady Hilda.'    
'But people don't always fall in love by tables of precedence,'  Edie put in simply. 'It's quite possible, I suppose, for a man  who isn't a duke himself to fall in love with a duke's daughter,  even though the duke her papa mayn't personally happen to approve  of the match. However, you don't seem to think Lady Hilda herself  a pleasant girl, even apart from the question of Lady Exmoor's  requirements?'    
'Miss Oswald,' Ernest said, looking at her suddenly, as she sat  half hiding her face with her parasol, and twitching more violently  than ever at the tall grasses; 'Miss Oswald, to tell you the truth,  I haven't been thinking much about Hilda Tregellis or any of the  other girls I've met at Dunbude, and for a very sufficient reason,  because I've had my mind too much preoccupied by somebody else  elsewhere.'    
Edie blushed even more prettily than before, and held her peace,  half raising her eyes for a second in an enquiring glance at his,  and then dropping them hastily as they met, in modest trepidation.  At that moment Ernest had never seen anything so beautiful or so  engaging as Edie Oswald.    
'Edie,' he said, beginning again more boldly, and taking her little  gloved hand almost unresistingly in his; 'Edie, you know my secret.  I love you. Can you love me?'    
Edie looked up at him shyly, the tears glistening and trembling a  little in the corner of her big bright eyes, and for a moment she  answered nothing. Then she drew away her hand hastily and said with  a sigh, 'Mr. Le Breton, we oughtn't to be talking so. We mustn't.  Don't let us. Take me home, please, at once, and don't say anything  more about it.' But her heart beat within her bosom with a violence  that was not all unpleasing, and her looks half belied her words  to Ernest's keen glance even as she spoke them.    
'Why not, Edie?' he said, drawing her down again gently by her  little hand as she tried to rise hesitatingly. 'Why not? tell me.  I've looked into your face, and though I can hardly dare to hope  it or believe it, I do believe I read in it that you really might  love me.'    
'Oh, Mr. Le Breton,' Edie answered, a tear now quivering visibly  on either eyelash, 'don't ask me, please don't ask me. I wish you  wouldn't. Take me home, won't you?'    
Ernest dropped her hand quietly, with a little show of despondency  that was hardly quite genuine, for his eyes had already told him  better. 'Then you can't love me, Miss Oswald,' he said, looking at  her closely. 'I'm sorry for it, very sorry for it; but I'm grieved  if I have seemed presumptuous in asking you.'    
This time the two tears trickled slowly down Edie's cheek--not very  sad tears either--and she answered hurriedly, 'Oh, I don't mean  that, Mr. Le Breton, I don't mean that. You misunderstand me, I'm  sure you misunderstand me.'    
Ernest caught up the trembling little hand again. 'Then you <i>can</i>  love me, Edie?' he said eagerly, 'you can love me?'    
Edie answered never a word, but bowed her head and cried a little,  silently. Ernest took the dainty wee gloved hand between his own two  hands and pressed it tenderly. He felt in return a faint pressure.    
'Then why won't you let me love you, Edie?' he asked, looking at  the blushing girl once more.    
'Oh, Mr. Le Breton,' Edie said, rising and moving away from  the path a little under the shade of the big elm-tree, 'it's very  wrong of me to let you talk so. I mustn't think of marrying you,  and you mustn't think of marrying me. Consider the difference in  our positions.'    
'Is that all?' Ernest answered gaily. 'Oh, Edie, if that's all,  it isn't a very difficult matter to settle. My position's exactly  nothing, for I've got no money and no prospects; and if I ask you  to marry me, it must be in the most strictly speculative fashion,  with no date and no certainty. The only question is, will you  consent to wait for me till I'm able to offer you a home to live  in? It's asking you a great deal, I know; and you've made me only  too happy and too grateful already; but if you'll wait for me till  we can marry, I shall live all my life through to repay you for  your sacrifice.'    
'But, Mr. Le Breton,' Edie said, turning towards the path and  drying her eyes quickly, 'I really don't think you ought to marry  me. The difference in station is so great--even Harry would allow  the difference in station. Your father was a great man, and a general  and a knight, you know; and though my dear father is the best and  kindest of men, he isn't anything of that sort, of course.'    
A slight shade of pain passed across Ernest's face. 'Edie,' he said,  'please don't talk about that--please don't. My father was a just  and good man, whom I loved and honoured deeply; if there's anything  good in any of us boys, it comes to us from my dear father. But  please don't speak to me about his profession. It's one of the  griefs and troubles of my life. He was a soldier, and an Indian  soldier too; and if there's anything more certain to me than the  principle that all fighting is very wrong and indefensible, it's  the principle that our rule in India is utterly unjust and wicked.  So instead of being proud of my father's profession, much as  I respected him, I'm profoundly ashamed of it; and it has been a  great question to me always how far I was justified at all in living  upon the pension given me for his Indian services.'    
Edie looked at him half surprised and half puzzled. It was to her  such an odd and unexpected point of view. But she felt instinctively  that Ernest really and deeply meant what he said, and she knew she  must not allude to the subject again. 'I beg your pardon,' she said  simply, 'if I've put it wrong; yet you know I can't help feeling  the great disparity in our two situations.'    
'Edie,' said Ernest, looking at her again with all his eyes--'I'm  going to call you "Edie" always now, so that's understood between  us. Well, I shall tell you exactly how I feel about this matter.  From the first moment I saw you I felt drawn towards you, I felt that  I couldn't help admiring you and sympathising with you and loving  you. If I dared I would have spoken to you that day at Iffley; but  I said to myself "She will not care for me; and besides, it would  be wrong of me to ask her just yet." I had nothing to live upon,  and I oughtn't to ask you to wait for me--you who are so pretty,  and sweet and good, and clever--I ought to leave you free to your  natural prospect of marrying some better man, who would make you  happier than I can ever hope to do. So I tried to put the impulse  aside; I waited, saying to myself that if you really cared for me  a little bit, you would still care for me when I came to Calcombe  Pomeroy. But then my natural selfishness overcame me--you  can forgive me for it, Edie; how could I help it when I had once  seen you? I began to be afraid some other man would be beforehand  with you; and I liked you so much I couldn't bear to think of the  chance that you might be taken away from me before I asked you.  All day long, as I've been walking alone on those high grey moors  at Dunbude, I've been thinking of you; and at last I made up my  mind that I <i>must</i> come and ask you to be my wife--some time--whenever  we could afford to marry. I know I'm asking you to make a great  sacrifice for me; it's more than I have any right to ask you; I'm  ashamed of myself for asking it; I can only make you a poor man's  wife, and how long I may have to wait even for that I can't say;  but if you'll only consent to wait for me, Edie, I'll do the best  that lies in me to make you as happy and to love you as well as  any man on earth could ever do.'    
Edie turned her face towards his, and said softly, 'Mr. Le Breton,  I will wait for you as long as ever you wish; and I'm so happy, oh  so happy.'    
There was a pause for a few moments, and then, as they walked  homeward down the green glen, Edie said, with something more of  her usual archness, 'So after all you haven't fallen in love with  Lady Hilda! Do you know, Mr. Le Breton, I rather fancied at Oxford  you liked me just a little tiny bit; but when I heard you were  going to Dunbude I said to myself, "Ah, now he'll never care for a  quiet country girl like me!" And when I knew you were coming down  here to Calcombe, straight from all those grand ladies at Dunbude,  I felt sure you'd be disenchanted as soon as you saw me, and never  think anything more about me.'    
'Then you liked me, Edie?' Ernest asked eagerly. 'You wanted me  really to come to Calcombe to see you?'    
'Of course I did, Mr. Le Breton. I've liked you from the first  moment I saw you.'    
'I'm so glad,' Ernest went on quickly. 'I believe all real love  is love at first sight. I wouldn't care myself to be loved in any  other way. And you thought I might fall in love with Lady Hilda?'    
'Well, you know, she is sure to be so handsome, and so accomplished,  and to have had so many advantages that I have never had. I was  afraid I should seem so very simple to you after Lady Hilda.'    
'Oh, Edie!' cried Ernest, stopping a moment, and gazing at the  little light airy figure. 'I only wish you could know the difference.  Coming from Dunbude to Calcombe is like coming from darkness into  light. Up there one meets with nobody but essentially vulgar-minded  selfish people--people whose whole life is passed in thinking and  talking about nothing but dogs, and horses, and partridges, and  salmon; racing, and hunting, and billiards, and wines; amusements,  amusements, amusements, all of them coarse and most of them cruel,  all day long. Their talk is just like the talk of grooms and  gamekeepers in a public-house parlour, only a little improved by  better English and more money. Will So-and-so win the Derby? What  a splendid run we had with the West Somerset on Wednesday! Were  you in at the death of that big fox at Coulson's Corner? Ought the  new vintages of Madeira to be bottled direct or sent round the Cape  like the old ones? Capital burlesque at the Gaiety, but very slow  at the Lyceum. Who will go to the Duchess of Dorsetshire's dance  on the twentieth:--and so forth for ever. Their own petty round  of selfish pleasures from week's end to week's end--no thought of  anybody else, no thought of the world at large, no thought even  of any higher interest in their own personalities. Their politics  are just a selfish calculation of their own prospects--land, Church,  capital, privilege. Their religion (when they have any) is just  a selfish regard for their own personal future welfare. From the  time I went to Dunbude to this day, I've never heard a single word  about any higher thought of any sort--I don't mean only about the  troubles or the aspirations of other people, but even about books,  about science, about art, about natural beauty. They live in a world  of amusing oneself and of amusing oneself in vulgar fashions--as a  born clown would do if he came suddenly into a large fortune. The  women are just as bad as the men, only in a different way--not  always even that; for most of them think only of the Four-in-hand  Club and the pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham--things to sicken one.  Now, I've known selfish people before, but not selfish people  utterly without any tincture of culture. I come away from Dunbude,  and come down here to Calcombe: and the difference in the atmosphere  makes one's very breath come and go freer. And I look at you, Edie,  and think of you beside Lady Hilda Tregellis, and I laugh in my  heart at the difference that artificial rules have made between  you. I wish you knew how immeasurably her superior you are in  every way. The fact is, it's a comfort to escape from Dunbude for  a while and get down here to feel oneself once more, in the only  true sense of the word, in a little good society.'    
While these things were happening in the Bourne Close, palsied old  Miss Luttrell, mumbling and grumbling inarticulately to herself,  was slowly tottering down the steep High Street of Calcombe Pomeroy,  on her way to the village grocer's. She shambled in tremulously  to Mrs. Oswald's counter, and seating herself on a high stool, as  was her wont, laid herself out distinctly for a list of purchases  and a good deliberate ill-natured gossip.    
'Two pounds of coffee, if you please, Mrs. Oswald,' she began with  a quaver; 'coffee, mind, I say, not chicory; your stuff always has  the smallest possible amount of flavour in it, it seems to me, for  the largest possible amount of quantity; all chicory, all chicory--no  decent coffee to be had now in Calcombe Pomeroy. So your son's at  home this week, is he? Out of work, I suppose? I saw him lounging  about on the beach, idling away his time, yesterday; pity he wasn't  at some decent trade, instead of hanging about and doing nothing,  as if he was a gentleman. Five pounds of lump sugar, too; good lump  sugar, though I expect I shall get nothing but beetroot; it's all  beetroot now, my brother tells me; they've ruined the West Indies  with their emancipation fads and their differential duties and  the Lord knows what--we had estates in the West Indies ourselves,  all given up to our negroes nowadays--and now I believe they have  to pay the French a bounty or something of the sort to induce  them to make sugar out of beetroot, because the negroes won't work  without whipping, so I understand; that's what comes in the end of  your Radical fal-lal notions. Well, five pounds of lump, and five  pounds of moist, though the one's as bad as the other, really. A  great pity about your son. I hope he'll get a place again soon. It  must be a trial to you to have him so idle!'    
'Well, no, ma'am, it's not,' Mrs. Oswald answered, with such  self-restraint as she could command. 'It's not much of a trial to  his father and me, for we're glad to let him have a little rest  after working so hard at Oxford. He works too hard, ma'am, but he  gets compensation for it, don't 'ee see, Miss Luttrell, for he's  just been made a Fellow of the Royal Society--"for his mathematical  eminence," the "Times" says--a Fellow of the Royal Society.'    
Even this staggering blow did not completely crush old Miss Luttrell.  'Fellow of the Royal Society,' she muttered feebly through her  remaining teeth. 'Must be some mistake somewhere, Mrs. Oswald--quite  impossible. A very meritorious young man, your son, doubtless;  but a National schoolmaster's hardly likely to be made a Fellow of  the Royal Society. Oh, I remember you told me he's not a National  schoolmaster, but has something to do at one of the Oxford colleges.  Yes, yes; I see what it is--Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.  You subscribe a guinea, and get made a Fellow by subscription,  just for the sake of writing F.R.G.S. after your name; it gives a  young man a look of importance.'    
'No, Miss Luttrell, it isn't that; it's <i>the</i> Royal Society; and if  you'll wait a moment, ma'am, I'll fetch you the president's letter,  and the diploma, to let you see it.'    
'Oh, no occasion to trouble yourself, Mrs. Oswald!' the old lady put  in, almost with alacrity, for she had herself seen the announcement  of Harry Oswald's election in the 'Times' a few days before. 'No  occasion to trouble yourself, I'm sure; I daresay you may be right,  and at any rate it's no business of mine, thank heaven. I never  want to poke my nose into anybody else's business. Well, talking  of Oxford, Mrs. Oswald, there's a very nice young man down here  at present; I wonder if you know where he's lodging? I want to ask  him to dinner. He's a young Mr. Le Breton--one of the Cheshire Le  Bretons, you know. His father was Sir Owen Le Breton, a general in  the Indian army--brother officer of Major Standish Luttrell's and  very nice people in every way. Lady Le Breton's a great friend of  the Archdeacon's, so I should like to show her son some little  attention. He's had a very distinguished career at Oxford--your  boy may have heard his name, perhaps--and now he's acting as tutor  to Lord Lynmouth, the eldest son of Lord Exmoor, you know; Lady  Exmoor was a second cousin of my brother's wife; very nice people,  all of them. The Le Bretons are a really good family, you see; and  the Archdeacon's exceedingly fond of them. So I thought if you could  tell me where this young man is lodging--you shop-people pick up  all the gossip in the place, always--I'd ask him to dinner to meet  the Rector and Colonel Turnbull and my nephew, who would probably  be able to offer him a little shooting.'    
'There's no partridges about in May, Miss Luttrell,' said Mrs.  Oswald, quietly smiling to herself at the fancy picture of Ernest  seated in congenial converse with the Rector, Colonel Turnbull,  and young Luttrell; 'but as to Mr. Le Breton, I <i>do</i> happen to know  where he's stopping, though it's not often that I know any Calcombe  gossip, save and except what you're good enough to tell me when you  drop in, ma'am; for Mr. Le Breton's stopping here, in this house,  with us, ma'am, this very minute.'    
'In this house, Mrs. Oswald!' the old lady cried with a start,  wagging her unsteady old head this time in genuine surprise; 'why,  I didn't know you let lodgings. I thought you and your daughter  were too much of fine ladies for <i>that</i>, really. I'm glad to hear  it. I'll leave a note for him.'    
'No, Miss Luttrell, we don't let lodgings, ma'am, and we don't need  to,' Mrs. Oswald answered, proudly. 'Mr. Le Breton's stopping here  as my son's guest. They were friends at Oxford together: and now  that Mr. Le Breton has got his holiday, like, Harry's asked him  down to spend a fortnight at Calcombe Pomeroy. And if you'll leave  a note I'll be very happy to give it to him as soon as he comes  in, for he's out walking now with Harry and Edith.'    
Old Miss Luttrell sat for half a minute in unwonted silence,  revolving in her poor puzzled head what line of tactics she ought  to adopt under such a very singular and annoying combination of  circumstances. Stopping at the village grocer's!--this was really  too atrocious! The Le Bretons were all as mad as hatters, that she  knew well; all except the mother, who was a sensible person, and  quite rational. But old Sir Owen was a man with the most absurd  religious fancies--took an interest in the souls of the soldiers;  quite right and proper, of course, in a chaplain, but really too  ridiculous in a regular field officer. No doubt Ernest Le Breton  had taken up some equally extraordinary notions--liberty, equality,  fraternity, and a general massacre, probably; and he had picked up  Harry Oswald as a suitable companion in his revolutionary schemes  and fancies. There was no knowing what stone wall one of those  mad Le Bretons might choose to run his head against. Still, the  practical difficulty remained--how could she extricate herself from  this awkward dilemma in such a way as to cover herself with glory,  and inflict another bitter humiliation on poor Mrs. Oswald? If only  she had known sooner that Ernest was stopping at the Oswalds, she  wouldn't have been so loud in praise of the Le Breton family; she  would in that case have dexterously insinuated that Lady Le Breton  was only a half-pay officer's widow, living on her pension; and  that her boys had got promotion at Oxford as poor scholars, through  the Archdeacon's benevolent influence. It was too late now, however,  to adopt that line of defence; and she fell back accordingly upon  the secondary position afforded her by the chance of taking down  Mrs. Oswald's intolerable insolence in another fashion.    
'Oh, he's out walking with your daughter, is he?' she said, maliciously.  'Out walking with your daughter, Mrs. Oswald, <i>not</i> with your son.  I saw her passing down the meadows half an hour ago with a strange  young man; and her brother stopped behind near the millpond. A  strange young man; yes, I noticed particularly that he looked like  a gentleman, and I was quite surprised that you should let her walk  out with him in that extraordinary manner. Depend upon it, Mrs.  Oswald, when young gentlemen in Mr. Le Breton's position go out  walking with young women in your daughter's position, they mean no  good by it--they mean no good by it. Take my advice, Mrs. Oswald,  and don't permit it. Mr. Le Breton's a very nice young man, and well  brought up no doubt--I know his mother's a woman of principle--still,  young men will be young men; and if your son goes bringing down  his fine Oxford acquaintances to Calcombe Pomeroy, and you and your  husband go flinging Miss Jemima--her name's Jemima, I think--at  the young men's heads, why, then, of course, you must take  the consequences--you must take the consequences!' And with this  telling Parthian shot discharged carefully from the shadow of the  doorway, accompanied by a running comment of shrugs, nods, and  facial distortions, old Miss Luttrell successfully shuffled herself  out of the shop, her list unfinished, leaving poor Mrs. Oswald  alone and absolutely speechless with indignation. Ernest Le Breton  never got a note of invitation from the Squire's sister: but before  nightfall all that was visitable in Calcombe Pomeroy had heard at  full length of the horrid conspiracy by which those pushing upstart  Oswalds had inveigled a son of poor Lady Le Breton's down to stop  with them, and were now trying to ruin his prospects by getting  him to marry their brazen-faced hussey, Jemima Edith.    
When Edie returned from her walk that afternoon, Mrs. Oswald went  up into her bedroom to see her daughter. She knew at once from  Edie's radiant blushing face and moist eyes what had taken place,  and she kissed the pretty shrinking girl tenderly on her forehead.  'Edie darling, I hope you will be happy,' she whispered significantly.    
'Then you guess it all, mother dear?' asked Edie, relieved that  she need not tell her story in set words.    
'Yes, darling,' said the mother, kissing her again. 'And you said  "yes."'    
Edie coloured once more. 'I said "yes," mother, for I love him  dearly.'    
'He's a dear fellow,' the mother answered gently; 'and I'm sure  he'll do his best to make you happy.'    
Later on in the day, Harry came up and knocked at Edie's door. His  mother had told him all about it, and so had Ernest. 'Popsy,' he  said, kissing her also, 'I congratulate you. I'm so glad about  it. Le Breton's the best fellow I know, and I couldn't wish you a  better or a kinder husband. You'll have to wait for him, but he's  worth waiting for. He's a good fellow and a clever fellow, and an  affectionate fellow; and his family are everything that could be  desired. It'll be a splendid thing for you to be able to talk in  future about "my mother-in law, Lady Le Breton." Depend upon it,  Edie dear, that always counts for something in society.'    
Edie blushed again, but this time with a certain tinge of shame  and disappointment. She had never thought of that herself, and she  was hurt that Harry should think and speak of it at such a moment.  She felt with a sigh it was unworthy of him and unworthy of the  occasion. Truly the iron of Pi and its evaluations had entered  deeply into his soul!
