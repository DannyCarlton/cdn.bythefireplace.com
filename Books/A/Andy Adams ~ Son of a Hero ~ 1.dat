Here are the best of many thrilling stories written by the late  James  Oliver Curwood concerning the ships that once plied America's  fresh-  water oceans&#8212;and the dauntless men who sailed them. These  tales of  the Inland Seas are reliable word-pictures of vessels and  sailors now  remembered only by the survivors of a generation that will  soon have  passed entirely away. Mr. Curwood, though better known as a  writer of  Canadian wilderness novels, was once regarded as an  authority in such  matters. Early in the present century he contributed  to &quot;American  Waterways&quot; from the Knickerbocker Press, its volume on  The Great  Lakes. 
These narratives are substantially as the great story-teller  related  them. I have but arranged them into a book, each chapter of  which is  really a separate Curwood yarn. 
Naturally, a few changes were necessary&#8212;but only a few&#8212;and not  much  has been added. I am confident that James Oliver Curwood's  readers  will find the magic spell of these stories as great as that of  his  colourful narrations of the men and women who live in the northern   wildernesses&#8212;&quot;God's Country,&quot; as he called it.
