The same afternoon Benicia ran into the sala where her mother was lying  on a sofa, and exclaimed excitedly: "My mother! My mother! It is not  so bad. The Americans are not so wicked as we have thought. The  proclamation of the Commodore Sloat has been pasted on all the walls of  the town and promises that our grants shall be secured to us under the  new government, that we shall elect our own alcaldes, that we shall  continue to worship God in our own religion, that our priests shall  be protected, that we shall have all the rights and advantages of the  American citizen--"    
"Stop!" cried Dona Eustaquia, springing to her feet. Her face still  burned with the bitter experience of the morning. "Tell me of no more  lying promises! They will keep their word! Ay, I do not doubt but they  will take advantage of our ignorance, with their Yankee sharpness! I  know them! Do not speak of them to me again. If it must be, it must; and  at least I have thee." She caught the girl in her arms, and covered the  flower-like face with passionate kisses. "My little one! My darling!  Thou lovest thy mother--better than all the world? Tell me!"    
The girl pressed her soft, red lips to the dark face which could express  such fierceness of love and hate.    
"My mother! Of course I love thee. It is because I have thee that I do  not take the fate of my country deeper heart. So long as they do not put  their ugly bayonets between us, what difference whether the eagle or the  stars wave above the fort?"    
"Ah, my child, thou hast not that love of country which is part of my  soul! But perhaps it is as well, for thou lovest thy mother the more. Is  it not so, my little one?"    
"Surely, my mother; I love no one in the world but you."    
Dona Eustaquia leaned back and tapped the girl's fair cheek with her  finger.    
"Not even Don Fernando Altimira?"    
"No, my mother."    
"Nor Flujencio Hernandez? Nor Juan Perez? Nor any of the caballeros who  serenade beneath thy window?"    
"I love their music, but it comes as sweetly from one throat as from  another."    
Her mother gave a long sigh of relief. "And yet I would have thee marry  some day, my little one. I was happy with thy father--thanks to God he  did not live to see this day--I was as happy, for two little years, as  this poor nature of ours can be, and I would have thee be the same. But  do not hasten to leave me alone. Thou art so young! Thine eyes have yet  the roguishness of youth; I would not see love flash it aside. Thy mouth  is like a child's; I shall shed the saddest tears of my life the day  it trembles with passion. Dear little one! Thou hast been more than a  daughter to me; thou hast been my only companion. I have striven to  impart to thee the ambition of thy mother and the intellect of thy  father. And I am proud of thee, very, very proud of thee!"    
Benicia pinched her mother's chin, her mischievous eyes softening. "Ay,  my mother, I have done my little best, but I never shall be you. I am  afraid I love to dance through the night and flirt my breath away better  than I love the intellectual conversation of the few people you think  worthy to sit about you in the evenings. I am like a little butterfly  sitting on the mane of a mountain lion--"    
"Tush! Tush! Thou knowest more than any girl in Monterey, and I am  satisfied with thee. Think of the books thou hast read, the languages  thou hast learned from the Senor Hartnell. Ay, my little one, nobody  but thou wouldst dare to say thou cared for nothing but dancing and  flirting, although I will admit that even Ysabel Herrera could scarce  rival thee at either."    
"Ay, my poor Ysabel! My heart breaks every night when I say a prayer for  her." She tightened the clasp of her arms and pressed her face close to  her mother's. "Mamacita, darling," she said coaxingly, "I have a big  favour to beg. Ay, an enormous one! How dare I ask it?"    
"Aha! What is it? I should like to know. I thought thy tenderness was a  little anxious."    
"Ay, mamacita! Do not refuse me or it will break my heart. On Wednesday  night Don Thomas Larkin gives a ball at his house to the officers of the  American squadron. Oh, mamacita! mamacita! <i>darling!</i> do, do let me go!"    
"Benicia! Thou wouldst meet those men? Valgame Dios! And thou art a  child of mine!"    
She flung the girl from her, and walked rapidly up and down the room,  Benicia following with her little white hands outstretched. "Dearest  one, I know just how you feel about it! But think a moment. They have  come to stay. They will never go. We shall meet them everywhere--every  night--every day. And my new gown, mamacita! The beautiful silver  spangles! There is not such a gown in Monterey! Ay, I must go. And they  say the Americans hop like puppies when they dance. How I shall laugh  at them! And it is not once in the year that I have a chance to speak  English, and none of the other girls can. And all the girls, all the  girls, all the girls, will go to this ball. Oh, mamacita!"    
Her mother was obliged to laugh. "Well, well, I cannot refuse you  anything; you know that! Go to the ball! Ay, yi, do not smother me! As  you have said--that little head can think--we must meet these insolent  braggarts sooner or later. So I would not--" her cheeks blanched  suddenly, she caught her daughter's face between her hands, and bent her  piercing eyes above the girl's soft depths. "Mother of God! That could  not be. My child! Thou couldst never love an American! A Gringo! A  Protestant! Holy Mary!"    
Benicia threw back her head and gave a long laugh--the light rippling  laugh of a girl who has scarcely dreamed of lovers. "I love an American?  Oh, my mother! A great, big, yellow-haired bear! When I want only to  laugh at their dancing! No, mamacita, when I love an American thou shalt  have his ears for thy necklace."
