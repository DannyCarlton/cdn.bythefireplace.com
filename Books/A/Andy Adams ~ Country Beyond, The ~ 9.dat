  It was the restlessness of Peter that roused Jolly Roger. Half   awake, and before he opened his eyes, life seized upon him where   sleep had cut it off for a time last night. His muscles ached. His   neck was stiff. He seemed weighted like a log to the hard earth.   Swiftly the experience of the preceding hours rushed upon him, and  it  was in the first of this wakefulness that he felt the presence  of  Peter. 
  He sat up and stared wide-eyed at the dog. The fact that Peter had   escaped from the cabin, and had followed him, was not altogether   amazing. It was quite the natural thing for a one-man dog to do.  But  the unexpectedness of it held McKay speechless, and at first a  little  disappointed. It was as if Peter had deliberately betrayed  a trust.  During the storm and flight of the night McKay had  thought of him as  the one connecting link remaining between him  and the girl he loved.  He had left Peter to fill his place, to  guard and watch and keep alive  the memory of the man who was gone.  For him there had been something  of consolation in this giving up  of his comradeship to Nada. And Peter  had turned traitor. 
  Even Peter seemed to sense the argument and condemnation that was   passing behind McKay's unsmiling eyes. He did not move, but lay   squatted on his belly, with his nose straight out on the ground   between his forepaws. It was his attitude of self-immolation. His   acknowledgment of the other's right to strike with lash or club.  Yet  in his eyes, bright and steady behind his mop of whiskers,  Jolly Roger  saw a prayer. 
  Without a word he held out his arms. It was all Peter needed, and   in a moment he was hugged up close against McKay. After all, there   was a mighty something that reached from heart to heart of these  two,  and Jolly Roger said, with a sound that was half laugh and  half sob in  his throat, 
  &quot;Pied-Bot, you devil&#8212;you little devil&#8212;&quot; 
  His fingers closed in the cloth about Peter's neck, and his heart   jumped when he saw what it was&#8212;a piece of Nada's dress. Peter,   realizing that at last the importance of his mission was  understood,  waited in eager watchfulness while his master untied  the knot. And in  another moment, out in the clean and glorious sun  that had followed  storm, McKay held the shining tress of Nada's  hair. 
  It was a real sob that broke in his throat now, and Peter saw him   crush the shining thing to his face, and hold it there, while  strange  quivers ran through his strong shoulders, and a wetness  that was not  rain gathered in his eyes. 
  &quot;God bless her!&quot; he whispered. And then he said, &quot;I wish I was a   kid, Peter&#8212;a kid. Because&#8212;if I ever wanted to cry&#8212;IT'S NOW&quot; 
  In his face, even with the tears and the strange quivering of his   lips, Peter saw a radiance that was joy. And McKay stood up, and   looked south, back over the trail he had followed through the   blackness and storm of night. He was visioning things. He saw Nada  in  Father John's cabin, urging Peter out into the wild tumult of  thunder  and lightning with that precious part of her which she  knew he would  love forever. Her last message to him. Her last  promise of love and  faith until the end of time. 
  He guessed only the beginning of the truth. And Peter, denied the   power of thought transmission because of an error in the creation  of  things, ran back a little way over the trail, trying to tell  his  master that Nada had come with him through the storm, and was  back in  the deep forest calling for him to return. 
  But McKay's mind saw nothing beyond the dimly lighted room of the   Missioner's cabin. 
  He pressed his lips to the silken tress of Nada's hair, still damp   with the rain; and after that, with the care of a miser he  smoothed  it out, and tied the end of the tress tightly with a  string, and put  it away in the soft buckskin wallet which he  carried. 
  There was a new singing in his heart as he gathered sticks with   which to build a small fire, for after this he would not travel  quite  alone. 
  That day they went on; and day followed day, until August came,   and north&#8212;still farther north they went into the illimitable   wilderness which reached out in the drowsing stillness of the   Flying-up-Month&#8212;the month when newly fledged things take to their   wings, and the deep forests lie asleep. 
  Days added themselves into weeks, until at last they were in the   country of the Reindeer waterways. 
  To the east was Hudson's Bay; westward lay the black forests and   twisting waterways of Upper Saskatchewan; and north&#8212;always north   &#8212;beckoned the lonely plains and unmapped wildernesses of the   Athabasca, the Slave and the Great Bear&#8212;toward which far country   their trail was slowly but surely wending its way. 
  The woodlands and swamps were now empty of man. Cabin and shack   and Indian tepee were lifeless, and waited in the desolation of   abandonment. No smoke rose in the tree-tops; no howl of dog came  with  the early dawn and the setting sun; trap lines were over-  growing, and  laughter and song and the ring of the trapper's axe  were gone, leaving  behind a brooding silence that seemed to pulse  and thrill like a great  heart&#8212;the heart of the wild unchained for  a space from its human  bondage. 
  It was the vacation time&#8212;the midsummer carnival weeks of the   wilderness people. Wild things were breeding. Fur was not good.  Flesh  was unfit to kill. And so they had disappeared, man, woman  and child,  and their dogs as well, to foregather at the Hudson's  Bay Company's  posts scattered here and there in the fastnesses of  the wilderness  lands. A few weeks more and they would return.  Cabins would send up  their smoke again. Brown-faced children would  play about the tepee  door. Ten thousand dwellers of the forests,  white and half-breed and  Indian born, would trickle in twos and  threes and family groups back  into the age-old trade of a domain  that reached from Hudson's Bay to  the western mountains and from  the Height of Land to the Arctic Sea. 
  Until then nature was free, and in its freedom ran in riotous   silence over the land. These were days when the wolf lay with her   young, but did not howl; when the lynx yawned sleepily, and hunted   but little&#8212;days of breeding, nights of drowsy whisperings, and of   big red moons, and of streams rippling softly at lowest ebb while   they dreamed of rains and flood-time. And through it all&#8212;through  the  lazy drone of insects, the rustling sighs of the tree-tops and  the  subdued notes of living things ran a low and tremulous  whispering, as  if nature had found for itself a new language in  this temporary  absence of man. 
  To Jolly Roger this was Life, It breathed for him out of the cool   earth. He heard it over him, and under him, and on all sides of  him  where other ears would have found only a thing vast and  oppressive and  silent. On what he called these &quot;motherhood days of  the earth&quot; the  passing years had built his faith and his creed. 
  One evening he stopped for camp at the edge of the Burntwood. From   his feet reached out the wide river, ankle deep in places, knee  deep  in others, rippling and singing between sandbars and  driftwood where  in May and June it had roared with the fury of  flood Peter, half  asleep after their day's travel through a hot  forests watched his  master. Since their flight from the edge of  civilization far south he  had grown heavier and broadened out. The  hardship of adventuring and  the craft of fighting for food and  life had whipped the last of his  puppyhood behind him At six  months of age he was scarred, and  lithe-muscled, and ready for  instant action at all times. Through the  mop of Airedale whiskers  that covered his face his bright eyes were  ever alert, and always  they watched the back-trail as he wondered why  the slim, blue-eyed  girl they both loved and missed so much did not  come. And vaguely  he wondered why it was that his master always went  on and on, and  never waited for her to catch up with them. 
  And Jolly Roger was changed. He was not the plump and rosy-faced   wilderness freebooter who whistled and sang away down at Cragg's   Ridge even when he knew the Law was at his heels. The steadiness  of  their flight had thinned him, and a graver look had settled in  his  face. But in his clear eyes was still the love of life&#8212;a  thing even  stronger than the grief which was eating at his heart  as their trail  reached steadily toward the Barren Lands. 
  In the sunset glow of this late afternoon Peter's watchful eyes   saw his master draw forth their treasure. 
  It was something he had come to look for, and expect&#8212;once, twice,   and sometimes half a dozen times between the rising and the  setting  of the sun. And at night, when they paused in their flight  for the  day, Jolly Roger never failed to do what he was doing now.  Peter drew  nearer to where his master was sitting with his back to  the big rock,  and his eyes glistened. Always he caught the sweet,  illusive perfume  of the girl when Jolly Roger drew out their  preciously guarded  package. He unwrapped it gently now, and in a  moment held in his hands  the tress of Nada's hair, the last of her  they would ever possess or  see. And Peter wondered again why they  did not go back to where they  had left the rest of the girl. Many  times, seeing his restlessness and  his yearning, Jolly Roger had  tried to make him understand. And Peter  tried to comprehend. But  always in his dreams he was with the girl he  loved, following her,  playing with her, fighting for her, hearing her  voice&#8212;feeling the  touch of her hand. In his dog soul he wanted her,  just as Jolly  Roger wanted her with all the yearning and heartbreak of  the man.  Yet always when he awoke from his dreams they went on  again&#8212;not  south&#8212;but north. To Peter this was hopeless mystery, and  he  possessed no power of reason to solve it. Nor could he speak in   words the message which he carried in his heart&#8212;that last crying   agony of the girl when she had sent him out on the trail of Roger   McKay, entreating him to bring back the man she loved and would   always love in spite of all the broken and unbroken laws in the   world. 
  That night, as they lay beside the Burntwood, Peter heard his   master crying out Nada's name in his sleep. 
  And the next dawn they went on&#8212;still farther north. 
  In these days and weeks, with the hot inundation of the wilderness   about him, McKay fought doggedly against the forces which were   struggling to break down the first law of his creed. The law might   catch him, and probably would, and when it caught him the law  might  hang him&#8212;and probably would. But it would never KNOW him.  There was  something grimly and tragically humorous in this. It  would never know  of the consuming purity of his worship for little  children, and old  people&#8212;and women. It would laugh at the  religion he had built up for  himself, and it would cackle  tauntingly if he dared to say he was not  wholly bad. For it  believed he was bad, and it believed he had killed  Jed Hawkins,  and he knew that seven hundred men were anxious to get  him, dead  or alive. 
  But was he bad? 
  He took the matter up one evening, with Peter. 
  &quot;If I'm bad, mebby it isn't all my fault, Pied-Bot,&quot; he said.   &quot;Mebby it's this&#8212;&quot; and he swept his arms out to the gathering   night.&quot; I was born in the open, on a night just like this is going  to  be. My mother, before she died, told me many times how she  watched the  moon come up that night, and how it seemed to look  down on her, and  talk to her, like a living thing. And I've loved  the moon ever since,  and the sun, and everything that's outdoors&#8212;  and if there's a God I  don't believe He ever intended man to make  a law that wasn't right  according to the plans He laid out. That's  where I've got in wrong,  Pied-Bot, I haven't always believed in  man-made law, and I've settled  a lot of things in my own way. And  I guess I've loved trees and  flowers and sunshine and wind and  storm too much. I've just wandered.  And I've done things along the  way. The thrill of it got into me,  Pied-Bot, and&#8212;the law wants  me!&quot; 
  Peter heard the subdued humor of the man, a low laugh that held   neither fear nor regret. 
  &quot;It was the Treaty Money first,&quot; he went on, leaning very   seriously toward Peter, as if he expected an argument. &quot;You see,   Yellow Bird was in that particular tribe, Pied-Bot. I remember her  as  she looked to me when a boy, with her two long, shining black  braids  and her face that was almost as beautiful to me as my  mother's. My  mother loved her, and she loved my mother, and I  loved Yellow Bird,  just as a child loves a fairy. And always  Yellow Bird has been my  fairy, Peter. I guess child worship is the  one thing that lasts  through life, always remaining ideal, and  never forgotten. Years after  my mother's death, when I was a young  man, and had been down to  Montreal and Ottawa and Quebec, I went  back to Yellow Bird's tribe.  And it was starving, Pied-Bot.  Starving to death!&quot; 
  Reminiscent tenderness and humor were gone from McKay's voice. It   was hard and flinty. 
  &quot;It was winter,&quot; he continued, &quot;the dead of winter. And cold. So   cold that even the wolves and foxes had buried themselves in. No  fish  that autumn, no game in the deep snows, and the Indians were  starving.  Pied-Bot, my heart went dead when I saw Yellow Bird.  There didn't seem  to be anything left of her but her eyes and her  hair&#8212;those two great,  shining braids, and eyes that were big and  deep and dark, like  beautiful pools. Boy, you never saw an Indian  &#8212;an Indian like Yellow  Bird&#8212;cry. They don't cry very much. But  when that childhood fairy of  mine first saw me she just stood  there, swaying in her weakness, and  the tears filled those big,  wide-open eyes and ran down her thin  cheeks. She had married Slim  Buck. Two of their three children had  died within a fortnight.  Slim Buck was dying of hunger and exhaustion.  And Yellow Bird's  heart was broken, and her soul was crying out for  God to let her  lie down beside Slim Buck and die with him&#8212;when I  happened along. 
  &quot;Peter&#8212;&quot; Jolly Roger leaned over in the thickening dusk, and his   eyes gleamed. &quot;Peter, if there's a God, an' He thinks I did wrong   then, let Him strike me dead right here! I'm willin'. I found out   what the trouble was. There was a new Indian Agent, a cur. And  near  the tribe was a Free Trader, another cur. The two got  together. The  Agent sent up the Treaty Money, and along with it&#8212;  underground, mind  you&#8212;he sent a lot of whiskey to the Free  Trader. Inside of five days  the whiskey got the Treaty Money from  the Indians. Then came winter.  Everything went bad, When I came&#8212;  and found out what had  happened&#8212;eighteen out of sixty had died,  and inside of another two  weeks half the others would follow.  Pied-Bot, away  back&#8212;somewhere&#8212;there must have been a pirate  before me&#8212;mebby a  great-grandfather of mine. I set out, I came  back in three days, and I  had a sledge-load of grub, and warm  things to wear&#8212;plenty of them. My  God, how those starving things  did eat! I went again, and returned in  another week, with a still  bigger sledge-load. And Yellow Bird was  getting beautiful again,  and Slim Buck was on his feet, growing  strong, and there was  happiness&#8212;and I think God A'mighty was glad. I  kept it up for two  months. Then the back-bone of the winter broke.  Game came into the  country I left them well supplied&#8212;and skipped.  That was what made  me an outlaw, Pied-Bot. That!&quot; 
  He chuckled, and Peter heard the rubbing of his hands in the   gloom. 
  &quot;Want to know why?&quot; he asked. &quot;Well, you see, I went over to the   Free Trader's, and this God the law don't take into account went  with  me, and we found the skunk alone. First I licked him until he  was  almost dead. Then, sticking a knife into him about half an  inch, I  made him write a note saying he was called south suddenly,  and  authorizing me to take charge in his absence. Then I chained  him in a  dugout in a place where nobody would find him. And I took  charge.  Pied-Bot, I sure did! Everybody was on the trap-lines, and  I wasn't  bothered much by callers. And I fed and clothed my tribe  for eight  straight weeks, fed 'em until they grew fat, Boy&#8212;and  Yellow Bird's  eyes were bright as stars again. Then I brought  Roach&#8212;that was his  name&#8212;back to his empty post, and I lectured  him, an' gave him another  licking&#8212;and left.&quot; 
  McKay rose to his feet. The first stars were peeping out of the   velvety darkness of the sky, and Peter heard his master draw in a   deep breath&#8212;the breath of a man whose lungs rejoice in the glory  of  life. 
  After a moment he said, 
  &quot;And the Royal Mounted have been after me ever since that winter,   Peter. And the harder they've chased me the more I've given them   reason to chase me. I half killed Beaudin, the Government mail-   runner, because he insulted another man's wife when that man&#8212;my   friend&#8212;was away. Then Beaudin, seeing his chance, robbed the mail   himself, and the crime was laid to me. Well, I got even, and stuck  up  a mail-sledge myself&#8212;but I guess there was a good reason for  it. I've  done a lot of things since then, but I've done it all  with my naked  fists, and I've never put a bullet or a knife into a  man except Roach  the Free Trader. And the funniest thing of the  whole business,  Pied-Bot, is this&#8212;I didn't kill Jed Hawkins. Some  day mebby I'll tell  you about what happened on the trail, the  thing which you and Nada  didn't see. But now&#8212;&quot; 
  For a moment he stood very still, and Peter sensed the sudden   thrill that was going through the man as he stood there in  darkness.  And then, suddenly, Jolly Roger bent over him. 
  &quot;Peter, there's three women we'll love as long as we live,&quot; he   whispered. &quot;There's my mother, and she is dead. There's Nada back   there, and we'll never see her again&#8212;&quot; His voice choked for an   instant. &quot;And then&#8212;there's Yellow Bird&#8212;&quot; he added. &quot;It's five  years  since I fed the tribe. Mebby they've had more kids! Boy,  let's go and  see!&quot;
