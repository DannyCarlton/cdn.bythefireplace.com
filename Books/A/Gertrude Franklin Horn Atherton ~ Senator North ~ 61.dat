It was half-past one o'clock in the morning of the nineteenth of  April. A thousand people, weary and breathless but intensely silent,  were crowded together in the galleries of the Senate. They had been  there all night, some of them since early afternoon, a few since  twelve o'clock. Outside, the corridors were so packed with humanity  that it was a wonder the six acres of building did not sway. For the  first time in hours they were silent and motionless, although they  could hear nothing.    
On the floor of the Senate almost every chair was occupied, and every  Senator was singularly erect; no one was lounging, or whispering, or  writing to-night. All faced the Vice-President, alone on his dais,  much as an army faces its general. Every foot of the wide semicircle  between the last curve of chairs and the wall was occupied by members  of the House of Representatives, who stood in a dignified silence with  which they had been little acquainted of late.    
The Senate no longer looked like a Club. It recalled the description  of Bryce: "The place seems consecrated to great affairs."    
The Secretary was about to call the roll for the vote which would  decide the fate of Cuba and alter for ever the position of the United  States in the family of nations.    
Betty had been in the gallery all night and a part of the preceding  day. When the Senate took a recess at half-past six in the evening,  she and Mary Montgomery, while Mrs. Shattuc guarded their seats, had  forced their way down to the restaurant, but had been obliged to  content themselves with a few sandwiches bought at the counter. But  Betty was conscious of neither hunger nor fatigue, although the strain  during the last eight hours had been almost insupportable: the brief  sharp debates, the prosing of bores, interrupted by angry cries of  "Vote! Vote!" the reiterated announcement of the Chairman of the  Committee on Foreign Relations that the conferees could not agree, the  perpetual nagging of two Democrats and one Populist, the long trying  intervals of debate on matters irrelevant to the great question  torturing every mind, during which there was much confusion on the  floor: the Senators talked constantly in groups except when the  Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations brought in his amended  bill;--all this had made up a day trying to the stoutest nerves, and  more than one person had fainted and been carried from the galleries.    
The blood throbbed in Betty Madison's head from repressed excitement  and the long strain on her nerves. But the solemnity of the scene  affected her so powerfully that her ego seemed dead, she only was  conscious of looking down upon history. It seemed to her that for the  first time she fully realized the tremendous issues involved in the  calling of that roll of names. The attitude of the American people  which she had deprecated and scorned was dignified by the attitude of  that historical body below her. Even Senator North did not interest  her. The Senate for the time was a unit.    
It seemed to her an interminable interval between the last echo of the  rumbling voice of the Clerk who had read the resolution amended by the  report of the conferees, and the first raucous exasperated note of the  Secretary's clerk, after a brief colloquy between Senators. This clerk  calls the roll of the Senate at all times as if he hated every member  of it, and to-night he was nervous.    
Betty felt the blood throb in her ears as she counted the sharp  decisive "ayes" and "nos," although Burleigh, whom she had seen during  the recess, had told her there was no doubt of the issue. As the clerk  entered the M's, she came to herself with a shock, and simultaneously  was possessed by a desire to get out of the gallery before Senator  North's time came to say "aye." She had heard the roll called many  times, she knew there were fourteen M's, and that she would have time  to get out of the gallery if she were quick about it. She made so  violent an effort to control the excitement raging within her that her  brain ached as if a wedge had been driven through it. She whispered  hurriedly to Mary Montgomery, who was leaning breathlessly over the  rail and did not hear her, then made her way up to the door as rapidly  as she could; even the steps were set thick with people.    
As she was passed out of the gallery by the doorkeeper, and found  herself precipitated upon that pale trembling hollow-eyed crowd wedged  together like atoms in a rock, her knees trembled and her courage  almost failed her. Several caught her by the arms, and asked her how  the vote was going; but she only shrugged her shoulders with the  instinct of self-defence and pushed her way toward a big policeman. He  knew her and put out his hand, thrusting one or two people aside.    
"This has been too much for you, miss, I reckon," he said. "I'll get  you downstairs. Keep close behind me."    
He forced a way through the crowd to the elevator. To attempt to part  the compact mass on the staircase would invite disaster. The elevator  boy had deserted his post that he might hear the news the sooner, but  the policeman pushed Betty into the car, and manipulated the ropes  himself. On the lower floor was another dense crowd; but he got her to  the East door after rescuing her twice, called her carriage and  returned to his post, well pleased with his bill.    
For many moments Betty, bruised from elbows, breathless from her  passage through that crush in the stagnant air, could not think  connectedly. She vaguely recalled Mrs. Mudd's large face and black  silk dress in the Diplomats' Gallery, which even a Cabinet minister  might not enter without a permit from a member of the Corps. Doubtless  the doorkeepers had been flung to and fro more than once to-night,  like little skiffs in an angry sea. She wondered how she had had  sufficient presence of mind to fee the policeman, and hoped she had  not given him silver instead of the large bill which had seemed to  spring to her fingers at the end of that frightful journey.    
She leaned out of the open window, wishing it were winter, that the  blood might be driven from her head; but there was only the slight  chill of a delicious April morning in the air, and the young leaves  fluttered gently in the trees. In the afternoon hundreds of boys had  sold violets in the streets, and the perfume lingered, floating above  the heavier scent of the magnolias in the parks. Betty's weary mind  pictured Washington as it would be a few weeks hence, a great forest  of brilliant living green amidst which one had almost to look for the  houses and the heroes in the squares. Every street was an avenue whose  tall trees seemed to cut the sky into blue banners--the word started  the rearrangement of her scattered senses; in a few weeks the dust  would be flying up to the green from thousands of marching feet.    
She burst into tears, and they gave her some relief. The carriage  stopped at the house a moment later, and she went directly to her  boudoir. She took off her hat and pulled down her hair, rubbing her  fingers against her burning head. Senator North took possession of her  mind at once. The Senate was no longer a unit to her excited  imagination; it seemed to dissolve away and leave one figure standing  there beaten and alone.    
She forgot the passionate efforts of other Senators in behalf of  peace; to her the fine conservative strength of the Senate was  personified in one man. And if there were others as pure and unselfish  in their ideals, his at least was the master intellect.    
She wondered if he remembered in this hour of bitter defeat that she  had promised to come to this room and give him what she could of  herself. That was weeks and weeks ago, and she had not repeated her  intention, as she should have done. But he loved her, and was not  likely to forget anything she said to him. Or would he care if he did  remember? Must not personal matters seem of small account to-night? Or  was he too weary to care for anything but sleep? Perhaps he had flung  himself down on a sofa in the cloak-room, or in his Committee Room,  and forgotten the national disaster while she watched.    
She had been walking rapidly up and down the room. Her thoughts were  not yet coherent, and instinct prompted her to get the blood out of  her head if she could. A vague sense of danger possessed her, but she  was not capable of defining it. Suddenly she stopped and held her  breath. She had become aware of a recurring footstep on the sidewalk.  Her window abutted some thirty feet away. She craned her head forward,  listening so intently that the blood pounded in her ears. She expected  to hear the gate open, the footsteps to grow softer on the path. But  they continued to pace the stone flags of the sidewalk.    
She opened her door, ran down the hall and into the parlor. Without an  instant's hesitation she flung open a window and leaned out. The light  from the street lamp fell full upon her. He could not fail to see her  were he there. But he was not. The man pacing up and down before the  house was the night watchman.    
Betty closed the window hurriedly and stumbled back into the dark  room. The disappointment and reaction were intolerable. She felt the  same blind rage with Circumstance which had attacked her the night he  had kissed and left her. In such crises conventions are non-existent;  she might have been primeval woman for all she recalled in that hour  of the teachings of the centuries. Had he been there, she would have  called him in. He was hers, whatever stood between them, and she alone  had the right to console him.    
Her mind turned suddenly to his house. He was there, of course; it was  absurd to imagine that his cool deliberation would ever forsake him.  The moment the Senate adjourned he would have put on his hat, walked  down to the East door, called a cab and gone home. And he was in his  library. Why she felt so positive that he was there and not in bed she  could not have told, but she saw the light in the long wing. She put  her hands to her face suddenly, and moved to the door. She stumbled  over a chair, and then noticed the intense darkness of the room. But  beyond she saw distinctly the big red brick house of Senator North,  with the light burning in the wing. Was she going to him? She wondered  vaguely, for her will seemed to be at the bottom of a pile of  struggling thoughts and to have nothing to say in the matter. Surely  she must. He was a man who stood alone and scorned sympathy or help,  but he would be glad of hers because it was hers; there was no  possible doubt of that. And in spite of his record he must for the  hour feel a bitter and absolute failure.    
A pebble would bring him to the window. He would come out, and come  back here with her. She opened her arms suddenly. The room was so dark  she almost could fancy him beside her. Would that he were!    
She had no adequate conception of a morrow. The future was drab and  formless. His trouble drew her like a magnet. She trembled at the mere  thought of being able to make him forget.    
And he? If he came out and saw her standing there, he would be more  than a man if he resisted the impulse to return with her here and take  her in his arms. And he too must be in a state of mind in which to-day  dwarfed and blotted out to-morrow.    
For the moment she stood motionless, almost breathless, realizing so  vividly the procession of bitter and apprehensive thoughts in the mind  which for so long had possessed and controlled hers that she forgot  her intention, even her desire to go to him. It was this moment of  insight and abstraction from self that saved her. Her own mind seemed  to awake suddenly.    
It was as if her thinking faculty had descended to her heart during  the last hours and been made dizzy and dull by the wild hot whirl of  emotions there. It climbed suddenly to where it belonged, and set the  rested machinery of her brain to work.    
Doubtless his impulse had been to come to her, to the room where he  knew she was alone and would receive him if he demanded admittance. He  had put the temptation aside, as he had put aside many others; and it  had been in her mind, was in her mind still, to make the temptation  irresistible. And if he felt a failure to-night, she had it in her  power to wreck his life utterly.    
It was more than possible that in the remaining years of his vigour  dwelt his tardy opportunities for historical fame. The great Republic  had sailed out of her summer sea into foreign waters, stormy,  unfriendly, bristling with unimaginable dangers. Once more she would  need great statesmen, not merely able legislators, and there could be  no doubt in the mind of any student of the Senate that she would  discover them swiftly. North was the greatest of these; and the record  of his future, brilliant, glorious perhaps, seemed to unroll itself  suddenly in the dark room.    
Betty drew a long hard breath. Her cheeks were cool at last, and she  wondered if her heart were dead, it felt so cold. What mad impulse  nearly had driven her to him to-night, independently of her will;  which had slept, worn out, like other faculties, by a day of hunger,  excitement, fatigue, and physical pain? The impulse had risen  unhindered and uncriticised from her heart, and if it had risen once  it could rise again. The days to come would be full of excitement.  She fancied that she already heard the roar of cannon, the beating of  drums, the sobs of women. And below the racket and its sad  accompaniment was always the low indignant mutter of a triumphant  people at those who had dared to set themselves above the popular  clamour and ask for sanity. The intolerable longing that had become  her constant companion would be fed by every device of unpropitious  Circumstance. Again and again she would experience this impulse to go  to him, and some night the blood would not recede from her brain in  time.    
She groped her way out of the dark parlor and down the hall, grateful  for an excuse to walk slowly. Her boudoir was brilliant, and the  struggle of the last few moments seemed the more terrible and  significant by contrast with the dainty luxurious room. She wondered  if she ever should dare to enter the parlor again, and if it always  would not look dark to her.    
She sat down at her desk and wrote a letter. It ran:--  Dear Mr. Burleigh,--I will marry you if you still wish it. Will you  dine with us to-night?    
Betty Madison.    
She was too tired for emotion, but she knew what would come later.  Nevertheless, she went to the front door and asked the watchman to  post the letter. Then she went to bed.
