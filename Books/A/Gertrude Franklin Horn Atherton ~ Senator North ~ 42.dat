She sent a note over to Senator North that evening, explaining why she  could not meet him in the morning; but as she rowed Harriet up the  lake, she saw him standing on the accustomed spot. He beckoned  peremptorily, and she pulled over to the shore, wondering if he had  not received her note.    
"Will you take me with you?" he asked. "I cannot get a boat, and I  should like to row for you, if you will let me."    
He boarded the boat, and Betty meekly surrendered the oars. She sat  opposite him, Harriet in the bow, and he smiled into her puzzled and  disapproving eyes. But he talked of impersonal matters until they had  entered the upper lake, and explained to Harriet the whereabouts of  the farmhouse whence she might be directed to the camp. Harriet had  not parted her lips since she left home. She sprang on shore the  moment Senator North beached the boat, and almost ran up the path.    
"Well!" he exclaimed. "Did you suppose that I should allow you to row  through that lane alone? There is no lonelier spot in America; and  with the forest full of negroes--were you mad to think of such a  thing?"    
"I never thought about it," said Betty, humbly. "I am not very timid."    
"I never doubted that you would be heroic in any conditions, but that  is not the question. You must not take such risks. I shall return with  you tonight--"    
"And Harriet!" exclaimed Betty, in sudden alarm. "Perhaps we should  not leave her."    
"She will be with the crowd. Besides, it is her husband's place to  look after her. I am concerned about you only. And I certainly shall  not permit you to go to a camp-meeting, nor shall I leave you to take  care of her. So put her out of your mind for the present."    
And Betty Madison, who had been pleased to regard the world as her  football, surrendered herself to the new delight of the heavy hand. He  re-entered the long water lane in the cleft of the mountain, and she  did not speak for some moments, but his eyes held hers and he knew of  what she was thinking.    
"I wonder if you always will do what I tell you," he said at length.  She recovered herself as soon as he spoke.    
"Too much power is not good for any man! Nothing would induce me to  assure you that you held my destiny in your hands, even did you!"    
His face did not fall. "You are the most spirited woman in America,  and nothing becomes you so much as obedience."    
"Nevertheless--"    
"Nevertheless, you always will do exactly what I tell you."    
"Even if you told me to marry another man?"    
"Ah! I never shall tell you to do that. On your head be that  responsibility." He did not attempt to speak lightly. His face  hardened, and his eyes, which could change in spite of their  impenetrable quality, let go their fires for a moment.    
"Of course, if you wanted to go, I should make no protest. But so long  as you love me I shall hold you--should, if we ceased to meet. And  whatever you do, don't marry some man suddenly in self-defence. No man  ever loved a woman more than I love you, but you can trust me."    
"Ah!" she said with her first moment of bitterness, "you <i>are</i> strong.  And you believe that if you held out your arms to me now, in the  depths of this forest, I would spring to them. I might not stay. I  believe, I hope I never should see you alone again; but-"    
"You are deliberately missing the point," he said gravely. "I am not  willing to pay the price of a moment's incomplete happiness. I have  lived too long for that. And I should not have ventured even so far on  dangerous ground," he added more lightly, "if it were not quite  probable that five hundred people are ranging the forest this minute.  We are later than we were yesterday, and they are not at their hymns.  This evening when we return I shall discuss with you the possible age  of the Adirondacks, or tell you one of Cooper's yarns." She leaned  toward him, her breath coming so short for a moment that she could  not speak. Finally, with what voice she could command she said,--    
"Then, as we are safe here and you have broken down the reserve for a  moment, let me ask you this: Do you know how much I love you? Do you  guess? Or do you think it merely a girl's romantic fancy--"    
"No!" he exclaimed. "No! No!" This time she did not cower before the  passion in his face. She looked at him steadily, although her eyes  were heavy. "Ah!" she said at last. "I am glad you know. It seemed to  me a wicked waste of myself that you should not. And if you do--the  rest does not matter so much. For the matter of that, life is always  making sport of its ultimates. The most perfect dream is the dream  that never comes true."    
He did not answer for a moment, but when he did he had recovered  himself completely.    
"That is true enough," he said. "We who have lived and thought know  that. But there never was a man so strong as to choose the dream when  Reality cast off her shackles and beckoned. Imagination we regard as a  compensation, not as the supreme gift. The wise never hate it,  however, as the failures so often do. For what it gives let us be as  thankful as the poet in his garret. If we awake in the morning to find  rain when we vividly had anticipated sunshine, it is only the common  mind who would regret the compensation of the dream."
