In Chicago the Ormsbys lived in a large stone house in Drexel  Boulevard. The house had a history. It was owned by a banker who was a  large stockholder and one of the directors of the plough trust. Like  all men who knew him well the banker admired and respected the ability  and integrity of David Ormsby. When the ploughmaker came to the city  from a town in Wisconsin to be the master of the plough trust he  offered him the house to use.    
The house had come to the banker from his father, a grim determined  old money-making merchant of a past generation who had died hated by  half Chicago after toiling sixteen hours daily for sixty years. In his  old age the merchant had built the house to express the power wealth  had given him. It had floors and woodwork cunningly wrought of  expensive woods by workmen sent to Chicago by a firm in Brussels. In  the long drawing room at the front of the house hung a chandelier that  had cost the merchant ten thousand dollars. The stairway leading to  the floor above was from the palace of a prince in Venice and had been  bought for the merchant and brought over seas to the house in Chicago.    
The banker who inherited the house did not want to live in it. Even  before the death of his father and after his own unsuccessful marriage  he lived at a down town club. In his old age the merchant, retired  from business, lived in the house with another old man, an inventor.  He could not rest although he had given up business with that end in  view. Digging a trench in the lawn at the back of the house he with  his friend spent his days trying to reduce the refuse of one of his  factories to something having commercial value. Fires burned in the  trench and at night the grim old man, hands covered with tar, sat in  the house under the chandelier. After the death of the merchant the  house stood empty, staring at passers-by in the street, its walks and  paths overgrown with weeds and rank grass.    
David Ormsby fitted into his house. Walking through the long halls or  sitting smoking his cigar in an easy chair on the wide lawn he looked  arrayed and environed. The house became a part of him like a well-made  and intelligently worn suit of clothes. Into the drawing room under  the ten thousand dollar chandelier he moved a billiard table and the  click of ivory balls banished the churchliness of the place.    
Up and down the stairway moved American girls, friends of Margaret,  their skirts rustling and their voices running through the huge rooms.  In the evening after dinner David played billiards. The careful  calculation of the angles and the English interested him. Playing in  the evening with Margaret or with a man friend the fatigue of the day  passed and his honest voice and reverberating laugh brought a smile to  the lips of people passing in the street. In the evening David brought  his friends to sit in talk with him on the wide verandas. At times he  went alone to his room at the top of the house and buried himself in  books. On Saturday evenings he had a debauch and with a group of  friends from town sat at a card table in the long parlour playing  poker and drinking highballs.    
Laura Ormsby, Margaret's mother, had never seemed a real part of the  life about her. Even as a child the daughter had thought her  hopelessly romantic. Life had treated her too well and from every one  about her she expected qualities and reactions which in her own person  she would not have tried to achieve.    
David had already begun to rise when he married her, the slender  brown-haired daughter of a village shoemaker, and even in those days  the little plough company with its ownership scattered among the  merchants and farmers of the vicinity had started under his hand to  make progress in the state. People already spoke of its master as a  coming man and of Laura as the wife of a coming man.    
To Laura this was in some way unsatisfactory. Sitting at home and  doing nothing she had still a passionate wish to be known as a  character, an individual, a woman of action. On the street as she  walked beside her husband, she beamed upon people but when the same  people spoke, calling them a handsome couple, a flush rose to her  cheeks and a flash of indignation ran through her brain.    
Laura Ormsby lay awake in her bed at night thinking of her life. She  had a world of fancies in which she at such times lived. In her dream  world a thousand stirring adventures came to her. She imagined a  letter received through the mail, telling of an intrigue in which  David's name was coupled with that of another woman and lay abed  quietly hugging the thought. She looked at the face of the sleeping  David tenderly. "Poor hard-pressed boy," she muttered. "I shall be  resigned and cheerful and lead him gently back to his old place in my  heart."    
In the morning after a night spent in this dream world Laura looked at  David, so cool and efficient, and was irritated by his efficiency.  When he playfully dropped his hand upon her shoulder she drew away and  sitting opposite him at breakfast watched him reading the morning  paper all unconscious of the rebel thoughts in her mind.    
Once after she had moved to Chicago and after Margaret's return from  college Laura had the faint suggestion of an adventure. Although it  turned out tamely it lingered in her mind and in some way sweetened  her thoughts.    
She was alone on a sleeping car coming from New York. A young man sat  in a seat opposite her and the two fell into talk. As she talked Laura  imagined herself eloping with the young man and under her lashes  looked sharply at his weak and pleasant face. She kept the talk alive  as others in the car crawled away for the night behind the green  swaying curtains.    
With the young man Laura discussed ideas she had got from reading  Ibsen and Shaw. She grew bold and daring in the advancing of opinions  and tried to stir the young man to some overt speech or action that  might arouse her indignation.    
The young man did not understand the middle-aged woman who sat beside  him and talked so boldly. He knew of but one prominent man named Shaw  and that man had been governor of Iowa and later a member of the  cabinet of President McKinley. It startled him to think that a  prominent member of the Republican party should have such thoughts or  express such opinions. He talked of fishing in Canada and of a comic  opera he had seen in New York and at eleven o'clock yawned and  disappeared behind the green curtains. As the young man lay in his  berth he muttered to himself, "Now what did that woman want?" A  thought came into his mind and he reached up to where his trousers  swung in a little hammock above the window and looked to see that his  watch and pocket-book were still there.    
At home Laura Ormsby nursed the thought of the talk with the strange  man on the train. In her mind he became something romantic and daring,  a streak of light across what she was pleased to think of as her  sombre life.    
Sitting at dinner she talked of him describing his charms. "He had a  wonderful mind and we sat late into the night talking," she said,  watching the face of David.    
When she had spoken Margaret looked up and said laughingly, "Have a  heart Dad. Here is romance. Do not be blind to it. Mother is trying to  scare you about an alleged love affair."
