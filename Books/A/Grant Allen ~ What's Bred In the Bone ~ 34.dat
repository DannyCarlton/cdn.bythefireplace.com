In Africa, meanwhile, during those eighteen months, King Khatsua  had kept his royal word. He had held his two European prisoners  under close watch and ward in the Koranna hut he had assigned them  for their residence.    
Like most other negro princes, indeed, Khatsua was a shrewd man of  business in his own way; and while he meant to prevent the English  strangers from escaping seaward with news of the new El Dorado  they had discovered in Barolong land, he hadn't the least idea of  turning away on that account the incidental advantages to be gained  for himself by permitting them to hunt freely in his dominions for  diamonds. So long as they acquiesced in the rough-and-ready royalty  of 50 per cent, he had proposed to them when he first decided to  detain them in his own territory--one stone for the king, and one  for the explorers--they were free to pursue their quest after gems  to their hearts' content in the valleys of Barolong land. And as the  two Englishmen, for their part, had nothing else to do in Africa,  and as they still went on hoping against hope for some chance of  escape or rescue, they dug for diamonds with a will, and secured  a number of first-class stones that would have made their fortunes  indeed--if only they could have got them to the sea or to England.    
Of course they lived perforce in the Koranna hut assigned them by  the king, in pretty much the same way as the Korannas themselves  did. King Khatsua's men supplied them abundantly with grain,  and fruits, and game; and even at times procured them ready-made  clothes, by exchange with Kimberley. In other respects, they were  not ill-treated; they were merely detained "during his majesty's  pleasure." But as his majesty had no intention of killing the goose  that laid the golden eggs, or of letting them go, if he could  help it, to spread the news of their find among their greedy  fellow-countrymen, it seemed to them both as if they might go on  being detained like this in Barolong land for an indefinite period.    
Still, things went indifferently with them. As they lived and worked  together in their native hut by Khatsua's village, a change began  slowly but irresistibly to come over Granville Kelmscott's feelings  towards his unacknowledged half-brother. At first, it was with the  deepest sense of distaste and loathing that the dispossessed heir  found himself compelled to associate with Guy Waring in such close  companionship. But, bit by bit, as they two saw more and more of  one another, this feeling of distaste began to wear off piecemeal.  Granville Kelmscott was more than half ashamed to admit it even  to himself, but in process of time he really almost caught himself  beginning to like--well, to like the man he believed to be a  murderer. It was shocking and horrible, no doubt; but what else  was he to do? Guy formed now his only European society. By the  side of those savage Barolongs, whose chief thought nothing of  perpetrating the most nameless horrors before their very eyes, for  the gratification of mere freaks of passion or jealousy, a European  murderer of the gentlemanly class seemed almost by comparison a mild  and gentle personage. Granville hardly liked to allow it in his own  mind, but it was nevertheless the case; he was getting positively  fond of this man, Guy Waring.    
Besides, blood is generally thicker than water. Living in such  close daily communion with Guy, and talking with him unrestrainedly  at last upon all possible points--save that one unapproachable  one, which both seemed to instinctively avoid alluding to in any  way--Granville began to feel that, murderer or no murderer, Guy  was in all essentials very near indeed to him. Nay, more, he found  himself at times actually arguing the point with his own conscience  that, after all, Guy was a very good sort of fellow; and if ever he  had murdered Montague Nevitt at all--which looked very probable--he  must have murdered him under considerably extenuating circumstances.    
There was only one thing about Guy that Granville didn't like when  he got to know him. This homicidal half-brother of his was gentle  as a woman; tender, kindhearted, truthful, affectionate; a gentleman  to the core, and a jolly good fellow into the bargain; but--there's  always a but--he was a terrible money-grubber! Even there in the  lost heart of Africa, at such a distance from home, with so little  chance of ever making any use of his hoarded wealth, the fellow  used to hunt up those wretched small stones, and wear them night  and day in a belt round his waist, as if he really loved them for  their own mere sakes--dirty high-priced little baubles! Granville,  for his part, couldn't bear to see such ingrained love of pelf. It  was miserable; it was mercenary.    
To be sure, he himself hunted diamonds every day of his life, just  as hard as Guy did; there was nothing else to do in this detestable  place, and a man <i>must</i> find something to turn his idle hands to.  Also he carried them, like Guy, bound up in a girdle round his own  waist; it was a pity they should be lost, if ever he should chance  to get away safe in the end to England. But then, don't you see,  the cases were so different. Guy hoarded up his diamonds for mere  wretched gain; whereas Granville valued his (he said to himself  often) not for the mere worth in money of those shimmering little  trinkets, but for his mother's sake, and Gwendoline's, and the  credit of the family. He wanted Lady Emily to see her son filling  the place in the world she had always looked forward with hope to  his filling; and, by Heaven's help, he thought, he could still fill  it. He couldn't marry Gwendoline on a beggar's pittance; and, by  Heaven's help, he hoped still to be able to marry her.    
Guy, on the other hand, found himself almost equally surprised  in turn at the rapid way he grew really to be fond of Granville  Kelmscott. Though Kelmscott knew, as he thought, the terrible secret  of his half-unconscious crime--for he could feel now how completely  he had acted under Montague Nevitt's compelling influence--Guy  was aware before long of such a profound and deep-seated sympathy  existing between them, that he became exceedingly attached in time  to his friendly fellow-prisoner. In spite of the one barrier they  could never break down, he spoke freely by degrees to Granville of  everything else in his whole life; and Granville in return spoke to  him just as freely. A good fellow, Granville, when you got to know  him. There was only a single trait in his character Guy couldn't  endure; and that was his ingrained love of money-grubbing. For the  way the man pounced down upon those dirty little stones, when he  saw them in the mud, and hoarded them up in his belt, and seemed  prepared to defend them with his very life-blood, Guy couldn't  conceal from himself-the fact that he fairly despised him. Such  vulgar, common-place, unredeemed love of pelf! Such mere bourgeois  avarice! Of what use could those wretched pebbles be to him here  in the dusty plains of far inland Africa?    
Guy himself kept close count of his finds, to be sure; but then,  the cases, don't you see, were so different! <i>He</i> wanted his diamonds  to discharge the great debt of his life to Cyril, and to appear an  honest man, rehabilitated once more, before the brother he had so  deeply wronged and humiliated. Whereas Granville Kelmscott, a rich  man's son, and the heir to a great estate beyond the dreams of  avarice--that <i>he</i> should have come risking his life in these savage  wilds for mere increase of superfluous wealth, why, it was simply  despicable.    
So eighteen months wore away, in mutual friendship, tempered to a  certain degree by mutual contempt, and little chance of escape came  to the captives in Barolong land.    
At last, as the second winter came round once more, for two or  three weeks the Englishmen in their huts began to perceive that  much bustle and confusion was going on all around in King Khatsua's  dominions. Preparations for a war on a considerable scale were  clearly taking place. Men mustered daily on the dusty plain with  firearms and assegais. Much pombe was drunk; many palavers took  place; a constant drumming of gongs and tom-toms disturbed their ears  by day and by night. The Englishmen concluded some big marauding  expedition was in contemplation. And they were quite right.  King Khatsua was about to concentrate his forces for an attack on  a neighbouring black monarch, as powerful and perhaps as cruel as  himself, Montisive of the Bush Veldt.    
Slowly the preparations went on all around. Then the great day came  at last, and King Khatsua set forth on his mighty campaign, to the  sound of big drums and the blare of native trumpets.    
When the warriors had marched out of the villages on their way  northward to the war, Guy saw the two prisoners' chance of escape  had arrived in earnest. They were guarded as usual, of course;  but not so strictly as before; and during the night, in particular,  Guy noticed with pleasure, little watch was now kept upon them. The  savage, indeed, can't hold two ideas in his head at once. If he's  making war on his neighbour on one side, he has no room left to  think of guarding his prisoners on the other.    
"To-night," Guy said, one evening, as they sat together in their  hut, over their native supper of mealie cakes and springbok venison,  "we must make a bold stroke. We must creep out of the kraal as  well as we can, and go for the sea westward, through Namaqua land  to Angra Pequena."    
"Westward?" Granville answered, very dubiously. "But why westward,  Waring? Surely our shortest way to the coast is down to Kimberley  and so on to the Cape. It'll take us weeks and weeks to reach the  sea, won't it, by way of Namaqua land?"    
"No matter for that," Guy replied, with confidence. He knew the map  pretty well, and had thought it all over. "As soon as the Barolong  miss us in the morning, they'll naturally think we've gone south,  as you say, towards our own people. So they'll pursue us in that  direction and try to take us; and if they were to catch us after  we'd once run away, you may be sure they'd kill us as soon as look  at us. But it would never occur to them, don't you see, we were  going away west. They won't follow us that way. So west we'll go,  and strike out for the sea, as I say, at Angra Pequena."    
They sat up through the night discussing plans low to themselves  in the dark, till nearly two in the morning. Then, when all was  silent around, and the Barolong slept, they stole quietly out, and  began their long march across the country to westward. Each man  had his diamonds tied tightly round his waist, and his revolver  at his belt. They were prepared to face every unknown danger.    
Crawling past the native huts with very cautious steps, they  made for the open, and emerged from the village on to the heights  that bounded the valley of the Lugura. They had proceeded in this  direction for more than an hour, walking as hard as their legs would  carry them, when the sound of a man running fast, but barefoot,  fell on their ears from behind in a regular pit-a-pat. Guy looked  back in dismay, and saw a naked Barolong just silhouetted against  the pale sky on the top of a long low ridge they had lately crossed  over. At the very same instant Granville raised his revolver and  pointed it at the man, who evidently had not yet perceived them.  With a sudden gesture of horror, Guy knocked down his hand and  prevented his taking aim.    
"Don't shoot," he cried, in a voice of surprised dismay and  disapproval. "We mustn't take his life. How do we know he's an  enemy at all? He mayn't be pursuing us."    
"Best shoot on spec, anyway," Granville answered, somewhat  discomposed. "All's fair in war. The fellow's after us no doubt.  And, at any rate, if he sees us he may go and report our whereabouts  to the village."    
"What? shoot an unarmed man who shows no signs of hostility! Why,  it would be sheer murder," Guy cried, with some horror. "We mustn't  make our retreat on <i>those</i> principles, Kelmscott; it'd be quite  indefensible. I decline to fire except when we're attacked. I  won't be any party, myself, to needless bloodshed."    
Granville Kclmscott gazed at him, there in the grey dawn, in  unspeakable surprise. Not shoot at a negro! In such straits, too,  as theirs! And this rebuke had come to him--from the mouth of the  murderer!    
Turn it over as he might, Granville couldn't understand it.    
The Barolong ran along on the crest of the ridge, still at the top  of his speed, without seeming to notice them in the gloom of the  valley. Presently, he disappeared over the edge to southward. Guy  was right, after all. He wasn't in pursuit of them. More likely  he was only a runaway slave, taking advantage, like themselves, of  King Khatsua's absence.
