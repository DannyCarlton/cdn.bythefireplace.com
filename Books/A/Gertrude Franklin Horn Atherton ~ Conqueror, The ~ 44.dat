Little Mrs. Hamilton was delighted with the course affairs had taken,  and pleaded for resignation from the army. But to this Hamilton would  not hearken. Anxious as he was for the war to finish, that he might  begin upon the foundations of home and fortune, he had no intention of  deserting a cause to which he had pledged himself, and in which there  still was a chance for him to achieve distinction. So far, his ambitions  were wholly military. If the profound thought he had given to the  present and future needs of the Republic was not wholly impersonal; if  he took for granted that he had a part to play when the Revolution  finished, it was little more than a dream at present. His very  temperament was martial, the energy and impetuosity of his nature were  in their element on the battlefield, and he would rather have been a  great general than the elder Pitt. But although there is no reason to  doubt that he would have become a great general, had circumstance  favoured his pet ambition, yet Washington was a better judge of the  usefulness of his several abilities than he was himself. Not only had  that reader of men made up his mind that a brain like his favourite's  should not be wasted on the battlefield,--left there, perhaps, while  dolts escaped, for Hamilton had no appreciation of fear or danger,--but  he saw in him the future statesman, fertile, creative, executive,  commanding; and he could have no better training than at a desk in his  office. Phenomenally precocious, even mature, as Hamilton's brain had  been when they met that morning on the Heights of Harlem, these four  years had given it a structural growth which it would not have acquired  in camp life, and to which few men of forty were entitled. Of this fact  Hamilton was appreciative, and he was too philosophical to harbour  regrets; but that period was over now, and he wanted to fight.    
On April 27th he wrote to Washington, asking for employment during the  approaching campaign, suggesting the command of a light corps, and  modestly but decidedly stating his claims.    
Washington was greatly embarrassed. Every arbitrary appointment caused a  ferment in the army, where jealousies were hotter than martial ardours.  Washington was politic above all things, but to refuse Hamilton a  request after their quarrel and parting was the last thing he wished to  do. He felt that he had no choice, however, and wrote at once,  elaborating his reasons for refusal, ending as follows:--    <blockquote>
 My principal concern rises from an apprehension that you will   impute my refusal of your request to other motives than those I   have expressed, but I beg you to be assured I am only influenced by   the reasons I have mentioned.</blockquote>    
Hamilton knew him too well to misunderstand him, but he was deeply  disappointed. He retired into the library behind the drawing-room of the  Schuyler mansion, and wrote another and a more elaborate letter to  Robert Morris. He began with a reiteration of the impotence of Congress,  its loss of the confidence of this country and of Europe, the necessity  for an executive ministry, and stated that the time was past to indulge  in hopes of foreign aid. The States must depend upon themselves, and  their only hope lay in a National Bank. There had been some diffidence  in his previous letter. There was none in this, and he had a greater  mastery of the subject. In something like thirty pages of close writing,  he lays down every law, extensive and minute, for the building of a  National Bank, and not the most remarkable thing about this letter is  the psychological knowledge it betrays of the American people. Having  despatched it, he wrote again to Washington, demonstrating that his case  was dissimilar from those the Chief had quoted. He disposed of each case  in turn, and his presentation of his own claims was equally  unanswerable. Washington, who was too wise to enter into a controversy  with Hamilton's pen, did not reply to the letter, but made up his mind  to do what he could for him, although still determined there should be  no disaffection in the army of his making.    
Meanwhile Hamilton received letters from Lafayette, begging him to  hasten South and share his exile; from Washington, asking advice; and  from members of the family, reminding him of their affection and regret.  Tilghman's is characteristic:--    
Headquarters, 27th April.    <blockquote>
 MY DEAR HAMILTON: Between me and thee there is a gulf, or I should   not have been thus long without seeing you. My faith is strong, but   not strong enough to attempt walking on the waters. You must not   suppose from my dealing so much in Scripture phrase that I am   either drunk with religion or with wine, though had I been inclined   to the latter I might have found a jolly companion in my lord, who   came here yesterday. We have not a word of news.... I must go over   and see you soon, for I am not yet weaned from you, nor do I desire   to be. I will not present so cold words as compliments to Mrs.   Hamilton. She has an equal share of the best wishes of    
 Your most affectionate    
 TILGHMAN.</blockquote>    
The following was from Laurens:--    <blockquote>
 I am indebted to you, my dear Hamilton, for two letters: the first   from Albany, as masterly a piece of cynicism as ever was penned;   the other from Philadelphia, dated the second March; in both you   mention a design of retiring, which makes me extremely unhappy. I   would not wish to have you for a moment withdraw from the public   service; at the same time my friendship for you, and knowledge of   your value to the United States, makes me most ardently desire that   you should fill only the first offices of the Republic. I was   flattered with an account of your being elected a delegate from New   York, and am much mortified not to hear it confirmed by yourself. I   must confess to you that at the present stage of the war, I should   prefer your going into Congress, and from thence becoming a   minister plenipotentiary for peace, to your remaining in the army,   where the dull system of seniority, and the <i>tableau</i>, would   prevent you from having the important commands to which you are   entitled; but, at any rate, I will not have you renounce your rank   unless you entered the career above mentioned. Your private affairs   cannot require such immediate and close attention. You speak like a   <i>paterfamilias</i> surrounded with a numerous progeny.</blockquote>    
On the 26th of May he had an appreciative letter from Robert Morris,  thanking him for his suggestions, and assuring him of their  acceptability. He promises a bank on Hamilton's plan, although with far  less capital; still it may afterward be increased to any extent.    
The northern land was full of amenities, the river gay with pleasure  barges. The French gardens about the Schuyler mansion were romantic for  saunterings with the loveliest of brides; the seats beneath the great  trees commanded the wild heights opposite. Forty of the finest horses in  the country were in General Schuyler's stables, and many carriages.  There was a constant stream of distinguished guests. But Hamilton, who  could dally pleasurably for a short time, had no real affinity for  anything but work. There being no immediate prospect of fighting, he  retired again to the library and began that series of papers called <i>The  Continentalist</i>, which were read as attentively as if peace had come.  They examined the defects of the existing league of states, their  jealousies, which operated against the formation of a Federal  government, then proceeded to enumerate the powers with which such a  government should be clothed.    
Hamilton did not wait with any particular grace, but even the desired  command came to him after a reasonable period of attempted patience. At  Washington's request he accompanied him to Newport to confer with  Rochambeau. Although the Chief did not allude to Hamilton's last letter,  their intercourse on this journey was as natural and intimate as ever;  and Washington did not conceal his pleasure in the society of this the  most captivating and endearing of his many young friends. After the  conference was over, Hamilton returned to Albany for a brief visit, then  determined to force Washington to show his hand. He joined the army at  Dobbs Ferry, and sent the Chief his commission. Tilghman returned with  it, express haste, and the assurance that the General would endeavour to  give him a command, nearly such as he could desire in the present  circumstance of the army, Hamilton had accomplished his object. He  retained his commission and quartered with General Lincoln.    
When Washington arrived at Dobbs Ferry and went into temporary quarters,  he gave a large dinner to the French officers, and invited Hamilton to  preside.    <blockquote>
 His graceful manners and witty speeches provoked universal   admiration [runs the pen of a contemporary]. He was the youngest   and smallest man present. His hair was turned back from the   forehead, powdered, and queued at the back. His face was boyishly   fair, and lighted up with intelligence and genius. Washington,   grave, elegant and hospitable, sat at the side of the table, with   the accomplished Count de Rochambeau on his right. The Duke de   Luzerne occupied a seat opposite. General Knox was present, and so   was Baron Steuben.</blockquote>    
Shortly afterward, Hamilton attended a council of war, at Washington's  invitation. The squadron of De Grasse was approaching the coast of  Virginia. For the second time, Washington was obliged to give up his  cherished scheme of marching on New York, for it was now imperative to  meet Cornwallis in the South. The Chief completely hoodwinked Clinton as  to his immediate plans, Robert Morris raised the funds for moving the  army, and Hamilton obtained his command. To his high satisfaction, Fish  was one of his officers. Immediately before his departure for the South  he wrote to his wife. He had attained his desire, but he was too unhappy  to be playful. A portion of the letter is as follows:--    <blockquote>
 A part of the army, my dear girl, is going to Virginia, and I must,   of necessity, be separated at a much greater distance from my   beloved wife. I cannot announce the fatal necessity without feeling   everything that a fond husband can feel. I am unhappy;--I am   unhappy beyond expression. I am unhappy because I am to be so   remote from you; because I am to hear from you less frequently than   I am accustomed to do. I am miserable because I know you will be   so; I am wretched at the idea of flying so far from you, without a   single hour's interview, to tell you all my pains and all my love.   But I cannot ask permission to visit you. It might be thought   improper to leave my corps at such a time and upon such an   occasion. I must go without seeing you--I must go without embracing   you:--alas! I must go.</blockquote>    
The allied armies moved on the 22d of August and arrived within two  miles of the enemy's works at York Town, on the 28th of September.  Hamilton's light infantry was attached to the division of Lafayette, who  joined the main army with what was left of his own. Laurens was also in  command of a company of light infantry in the young French general's  division. He had acquitted himself brilliantly in France, returning, in  spite of all obstacles and the discouragement of Franklin, with two and  a half million livres in cash, part of a subsidy of six millions of  livres granted by the French king; but he felt that to be in the field  again with Washington, Hamilton, Lafayette, and Fish was higher fortune  than successful diplomacy.    
The allied army was twelve thousand strong; Cornwallis had about  seventy-eight hundred men. The British commander was intrenched in the  village of York Town, the main body of his troops encamped on the open  grounds in the rear. York Town is situated on a peninsula formed by the  rivers York and James, and into this narrow compass Cornwallis had been  driven by the masterly tactics of Lafayette. The arrival of De Grasse's  fleet cut off all hope of retreat by water. He made but a show of  opposition during the eight days employed by the Americans in bringing  up their ordnance and making other preparations. On the 9th the trenches  were completed, and the Americans began the bombardment of the town and  of the British frigates in the river. It continued for nearly  twenty-four hours, and so persistent and terrific was the cannonading,  that the British, being unfortunate in their embrasures, withdrew most  of their cannon and made infrequent reply. On the night of the 11th new  trenches were begun within two and three hundred yards of the British  works. While they were completing, the enemy opened new embrasures, from  which their fire was far more effective than at first. Two redoubts  flanked this second parallel and desperately annoyed the men in the  trenches. It was determined to carry them by assault, and the American  light infantry and De Viomenil's grenadiers and chasseurs were ordered  to hold themselves in readiness for the attack. Laurens, with eighty  men, was to turn the redoubt in order to intercept the retreat of the  garrison, but Hamilton, for the moment, saw his long-coveted  opportunity glide by him. Washington had determined to give it to our  hero's old Elizabethtown tutor, Colonel Barber, conceiving that the  light infantry which had made the Virginia campaign was entitled to  precedence. Hamilton was standing with Major Fish when the news of this  arrangement was brought to him. He reached the General's tent in three  bounds, and poured forth the most impetuous appeal he had ever permitted  himself to launch at Washington. But he was terribly in earnest, and the  prospect of losing this magnificent opportunity tore down the barriers  of his self-possession. "It is my right to attack, sir!" he concluded  passionately, "I am the officer on duty!" Washington had watched his  flushed nervous face and flashing eyes, which had far more command in  their glances than appeal, and he never made great mistakes: he knew  that if he refused this request, Hamilton never would forgive him.    
"Very well," he said. "Take it."    
Hamilton ran back to Fish, crying: "We have it. We have it;" and  immediately began to form his troops. The order was issued to advance in  two columns, and after dark the march began, Hamilton leading the  advance corps. The French were to attack the redoubt on the right.    
The signal was a shell from the American batteries, followed by one from  the French. The instant the French shell ascended, Hamilton gave the  order to advance at the point of the bayonet; then his impatience, too  long gnawing at its curb, dominated him, and he ran ahead of his men and  leaped to the abatis. For a half moment he stood alone on the parapet,  then Fish reached him, and together they encouraged the rest to come on.  Hamilton turned and sprang into the ditch, Fish following. The infantry  was close behind, and surmounting the abatis, ditch, and palisades,  leaped into the work. Hamilton had disappeared, and they feared he had  fallen, but he was investigating; he suddenly reappeared, and formed the  troops in the redoubt. It surrendered almost immediately. The attack  took but nine minutes, so irresistible was the impetuosity of the  onslaught. Hamilton gave orders at once to spare every man who had  ceased to fight. When Colonel Campbell advanced to surrender, one of the  American captains seized a bayonet and drew back to plunge it into the  Englishman's breast. Hamilton thrust it aside, and Campbell was made  prisoner by Laurens. Washington was delighted. "Few cases," he said,  "have exhibited greater proofs of intrepidity, coolness, and firmness  than were shown on this occasion." On the 17th, when Washington received  the proposition for surrender from Cornwallis, he sent for Hamilton and  asked his opinion of the terms. To Laurens was given the honour of  representing the American army at the conference before the surrender.  Tilghman rode, express haste, to Philadelphia with the first news of the  surrender of Cornwallis and his army.    
Hamilton's description of his part in the conquest that virtually put an  end to the war is characteristic.    <blockquote>
 Two nights ago, my Eliza [he wrote], my duty and my honour obliged   me to take a step in which your happiness was too much risked. I   commanded an attack upon one of the enemy's redoubts; we carried it   in an instant and with little loss. You will see the particulars in   the Philadelphia papers. There will be, certainly, nothing more of   this kind; all the rest will be by approach; and if there should be   another occasion, it would not fall to my turn to execute it.</blockquote>    
"It is to be hoped so," she said plaintively to her mother. "Else shall  I no longer need to wear a wig."
