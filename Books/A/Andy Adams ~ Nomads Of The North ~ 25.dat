  To Miki and Neewa, especially Neewa, there seemed nothing   extraordinary in the fact that they were together again, and that   their comradeship was resumed. Although during his months of   hibernation Neewa's body had grown, his mind had not changed its   memories or its pictures. It had not passed through a mess of   stirring events such as had made the winter a thrilling one for  Miki,  and so it was Neewa who accepted the new situation most  casually. He  went on feeding as if nothing at all unusual had  happened during the  past four months, and after the edge had gone  from his first hunger he  fell into his old habit of looking to  Miki for leadership. And Miki  fell into the old ways as though  only a day or a week and not four  months had lapsed in their  brotherhood. It is possible that he tried  mightily to tell Neewa  what had happened. At least he must have had  that desire&#8212;to let  him know in what a strange way he had found his  old master,  Challoner, and how he had lost him again. And also how he  found  the woman, Nanette, and the little baby Nanette, and how for a   long time he had lived with them and loved them as he had never  loved  anything else on earth. 
  It was the old cabin, far to the north and east, that drew him   now&#8212;the cabin in which Nanette and the baby had lived; and it was   toward this cabin that he lured Neewa during the first two weeks  of  their hunting. They did not travel quickly, largely because of  Neewa's  voracious spring appetite and the fact that it consumed  nine tenths of  his waking hours to keep full on such provender as  roots and swelling  buds and grass. During the first week Miki grew  either hopeless or  disgusted in his hunting. One day he killed  five rabbits and Neewa ate  four of them and grunted piggishly for  more. 
  If Miki had stood amazed and appalled at Neewa's appetite in the   days of their cubhood and puppyhood a year ago, he was more than   astounded now, for in the matter of food Neewa was a bottomless  pit.  On the other hand he was jollier than ever, and in their  wrestling  matches he was almost more than a match for Miki, being  nearly again  as heavy. He very soon acquired the habit of taking  advantage of this  superiority of weight, and at unexpected moments  he would hop on Miki  and pin him to the ground, his fat body  smothering him like a huge  soft cushion, and his arms holding him  until at times Miki could  scarcely squirm. Now and then, hugging  him in this embrace, he would  roll over and over, both of them  snarling and growling as though in  deadly combat. This play,  though he was literally the under dog,  delighted Miki until one  day they rolled over the edge of a deep  ravine and crashed in a  dog-and-bear avalanche to the bottom. After  that, for a long time,  Neewa did not roll with his victim. Whenever  Miki wanted to end a  bout, however, all he had to do was to give Neewa  a sharp nip with  his long fangs and the bear would uncoil himself and  hop to his  feet like a spring. He had a most serious respect for  Miki's  teeth. 
  But Miki's greatest moments of joy were where Neewa stood up man-   fashion. Then was a real tussle. And his greatest hours of disgust   were when Neewa stretched himself out in a tree for a nap. 
  It was the beginning of the third week before they came one day to   the cabin. There was no change in it, and Miki's body sagged   disconsolately as he and Neewa looked at it from the edge of the   clearing. No smoke, no sign of life, and the window was broken   now&#8212;probably by an inquisitive bear or a wolverine. Miki went to  the  window and stood up to it, sniffing inside. The SMELL was  still  there&#8212;so faint that he could only just detect it. But that  was all.  The big room was empty except for the stove, a table and  a few bits of  rude furniture. All else was gone. Three or four  times during the next  half hour Miki stood up at the window, and  at last Neewa&#8212;urged by his  curiosity&#8212;did likewise. He also  detected the faint odour that was  left in the cabin. He sniffed at  it for a long time. It was like the  smell he had caught the day he  came out of his den&#8212;and yet different.  It was fainter, more  elusive, and not so unpleasant. 
  For a month thereafter Miki insisted on hunting in the vicinity of   the cabin, held there by the &quot;pull&quot; of the thing which he could   neither analyze nor quite understand. Neewa accepted the situation   good-naturedly for a time. Then he lost patience and surrendered   himself to a grouch for three whole days during which he wandered  at  his own sweet will. To preserve the alliance Miki was compelled  to  follow him. Berry time&#8212;early July&#8212;found them sixty miles  north and  west of the cabin, in the edge of the country where  Neewa was born. 
  But there were few berries that summer of bebe nak um geda (the   summer of drought and fire). As early as the middle of July a  thin,  gray film began to hover in palpitating waves over the  forests. For  three weeks there had been no rain. Even the nights  were hot and dry.  Each day the factors at their posts looked out  with anxious eyes over  their domains, and by the first of August  every post had a score of  halfbreeds and Indians patrolling the  trails on the watch for fire. In  their cabins and teepees the  forest dwellers who had not gone to pass  the summer at the posts  waited and watched; each morning and noon and  night they climbed  tall trees and peered through that palpitating gray  film for a  sign of smoke. For weeks the wind came steadily from the  south and  west, parched as though swept over the burning sands of a  desert.  Berries dried up on the bushes; the fruit of the mountain ash   shriveled on its stems; creeks ran dry; swamps turned into baked   peat, and the poplar leaves hung wilted and lifeless, too limp to   rustle in the breeze. Only once or twice in a lifetime does the   forest dweller see poplar leaves curl up and die like that, baked  to  death in the summer sun. It is Kiskewahoon (the Danger Signal).  Not  only the warning of possible death in a holocaust of fire, but  the  omen of poor hunting and trapping in the winter to come. 
  Miki and Neewa were in a swamp country when the fifth of August   came. In the lowland it was sweltering. Neewa's tongue hung from  his  mouth, and Miki was panting as they made their way along a  black and  sluggish stream that was like a great ditch and as dead  as the day  itself. There was no visible sun, but a red and lurid  glow filled the  sky&#8212;the sun struggling to fight its way through  the smothering film  that had grown thicker over the earth. Because  they were in a  &quot;pocket&quot;&#8212;a sweep of tangled country lower than the  surrounding  country&#8212;Neewa and Miki were not caught in this  blackening cloud. Five  miles away they might have heard the  thunder of cloven hoofs and the  crash of heavy bodies in their  flight before the deadly menace of  fire. As it was they made their  way slowly through the parched swamp,  so that it was midday when  they came out of the edge of it and up  through a green fringe of  timber to the top of a ridge. Before this  hour neither had passed  through the horror of a forest fire. But it  seized upon them now.  It needed no past experience. The cumulative  instinct of a  thousand generations leapt through their brains and  bodies. Their  world was in the grip of Iskootao (the Fire Devil). To  the south  and the east and the west it was buried in a pall like the   darkness of night, and out of the far edge of the swamp through  which  they had come they caught the first livid spurts of flame.  From that  direction, now that they were out of the &quot;pocket,&quot; they  felt a hot  wind, and with that wind came a dull and rumbling roar  that was like  the distant moaning of a cataract. They waited, and  watched,  struggling to get their bearings, their minds fighting  for a few  moments in the gigantic process of changing instinct  into reasoning  and understanding. Neewa, being a bear, was  afflicted with the  near-sightedness of his breed, and he could see  neither the black  tornado of smoke bearing down upon them nor the  flames leaping out of  the swamp. But he could SMELL, and his nose  was twisted into a hundred  wrinkles, and even ahead of Miki he was  ready for flight. But Miki,  whose vision was like a hawk's, stood  as if fascinated. 
  The roaring grew more distinct. It seemed on all sides of them.   But it was from the south that there came the first storm of ash   rushing noiselessly ahead of the fire, and after that the smoke.  It  was then that Miki turned with a strange whine but it was Neewa  now  who took the lead&#8212;Neewa, whose forebears had ten thousand  times run  this same wild race with death in the centuries since  their world was  born. He did not need the keenness of far vision  now. He KNEW. He knew  what was behind, and what was on either  side, and where the one trail  to safety lay; and in the air he  felt and smelled the thing that was  death. Twice Miki made efforts  to swing their course into the east,  but Neewa would have none of  it. With flattened ears he went on NORTH.  Three times Miki stopped  to turn and face the galloping menace behind  them, but never for  an instant did Neewa pause. Straight on&#8212;NORTH,  NORTH, NORTH&#8212;  north to the higher lands, the big waters, the open  plains. 
  They were not alone. A caribou sped past them with the swiftness   of the wind itself. &quot;FAST, FAST, FAST!&quot;&#8212;Neewa's instinct cried;   &quot;but&#8212;ENDURE! For the caribou, speeding even faster than the fire,   will fall of exhaustion shortly and be eaten up by the flames.   FAST&#8212;but ENDURE!&quot; 
  And steadily, stoically, at his loping gait Neewa led on. 
  A bull moose swung half across their trail from the west, wind-   gone and panting as though his throat were cut. He was badly  burned,  and running blindly into the eastern wall of fire. 
  Behind and on either side, where the flames were rushing on with   the pitiless ferocity of hunnish regiments, the harvest of death  was  a vast and shuddering reality. In hollow logs, under  windfalls, in the  thick tree-tops, and in the earth itself, the  smaller things of the  wilderness sought their refuge&#8212;and died.  Rabbits became leaping balls  of flame, then lay shrivelled and  black; the marten were baked in  their trees; fishers and mink and  ermine crawled into the deepest  corners of the windfalls and died  there by inches; owls fluttered out  of their tree-tops, staggered  for a few moments in the fiery air, and  fell down into the heart  of the flame. No creature made a  sound&#8212;except the porcupines; and  as they died they cried like little  children. 
  In the green spruce and cedar timber, heavy with the pitch that   made their thick tops spurt into flame like a sea of explosive,  the  fire rushed on with a tremendous roar. From it&#8212;in a straight   race&#8212;there was no escape for man or beast. Out of that world of   conflagration there might have risen one great, yearning cry to   heaven: WATER&#8212;WATER&#8212;WATER! Wherever there was water there was  also  hope&#8212;and life. Breed and blood and wilderness feuds were  forgotten in  the great hour of peril. Every lake became a haven of  refuge. 
  To such a lake came Neewa, guided by an unerring instinct and   sense of smell sharpened by the rumble and roar of the storm of  fire  behind him. Miki had &quot;lost&quot; himself; his senses were dulled;  his  nostrils caught no scent but that of a world in flames&#8212;so,  blindly,  he followed his comrade. The fire was enveloping the lake  along its  western shore, and its water was already thickly  tenanted. It was not  a large lake, and almost round. Its diameter  was not more than two  hundred yards. Farther out&#8212;a few of them  swimming, but most of them  standing on bottom with only their  heads out of water&#8212;were a score of  caribou and moose. Many other  shorter-legged creatures were swimming  aimlessly, turning this way  and that, paddling their feet only enough  to keep afloat. On the  shore where Neewa and Miki paused was a huge  porcupine, chattering  and chuckling foolishly, as if scolding all  things in general for  having disturbed him at dinner. Then he took to  the water. A  little farther up the shore a fisher-cat and a fox hugged  close to  the water line, hesitating to wet their precious fur until  death  itself snapped at their heels; and as if to bring fresh news of   this death a second fox dragged himself wearily out on the shore,  as  limp as a wet rag after his swim from the opposite shore, where  the  fire was already leaping in a wall of flame. And as this fox  swam in,  hoping to find safety, an old bear twice as big as Neewa,  crashed  panting from the undergrowth, plunged into the water, and  swam OUT.  Smaller things were creeping and crawling and slinking  along the  shore; little red-eyed ermine, marten, and mink,  rabbits, squirrels,  and squeaking gophers, and a horde of mice.  And at last, with these  things which he would have devoured so  greedily running about him,  Neewa waded slowly out into the water.  Miki followed until he was  submerged to his shoulders. Then he  stopped. The fire was close now,  advancing like a race-horse. Over  the protecting barrier of thick  timber drove the clouds of smoke  and ash. Swiftly the lake became  obliterated, and now out of that  awful chaos of blackness and smoke  and heat there rose strange and  thrilling cries; the bleating of a  moose calf that was doomed to  die and the bellowing, terror-filled  response of its mother; the  agonized howling of a wolf; the terrified  barking of a fox, and  over all else the horrible screaming of a pair  of loons whose home  had been transformed into a sea of flame. 
  Through the thickening smoke and increasing heat Neewa gave his   call to Miki as he began to swim, and with an answering whine Miki   plunged after him, swimming so close to his big black brother that   his muzzle touched the other's flank. In mid-lake Neewa did as the   other swimming creatures were doing&#8212;paddled only enough to keep   himself afloat; but for Miki, big of bone and unassisted by a   life-preserver of fat, the struggle was not so easy. He was forced  to  swim to keep afloat. A dozen times he circled around Neewa, and  then,  with something of the situation driven upon him, he came up  close to  the bear and rested his forepaws on his shoulders. 
  The lake was now encircled by a solid wall of fire. Blasts of   flame shot up the pitch-laden trees and leapt for fifty feet into  the  blistering air. The roar of the conflagration was deafening.  It  drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made. And  its  heat was terrific. For a few terrible minutes the air which  Miki drew  into his lungs was like fire itself. Neewa plunged his  head under  water every few seconds, but it was not Miki's instinct  to do this.  Like the wolf and the fox and the fisher-cat and the  lynx it was his  nature to die before completely submerging  himself. 
  Swift as it had come the fire passed; and the walls of timber that   had been green a few moments before were black and shrivelled and   dead; and sound swept on with the flame until it became once more   only a low and rumbling murmur. 
  To the black and smouldering shores the live things slowly made   their way. Of all the creatures that had taken refuge in the lake   many had died. Chief of those were the porcupines. All had  drowned. 
  Close to the shore the heat was still intense, and for hours the   earth was hot with smouldering fire. All the rest of that day and  the  night that followed no living thing moved out of the shallow  water.  And yet no living thing thought to prey upon its neighbour.  The great  peril had made of all beasts kin. 
  A little before dawn of the day following the fire relief came. A   deluge of rain fell, and when day broke and the sun shone through  a  murky heaven there was left no sign of what the lake had been,  except  for the dead bodies that floated on its surface or lined  its shores.  The living things had returned into their desolated  wilderness&#8212;and  among them Neewa and Miki.
