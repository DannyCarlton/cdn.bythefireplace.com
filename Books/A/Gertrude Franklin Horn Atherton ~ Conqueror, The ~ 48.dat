In February he went to the Assembly to fight Clinton's opposition to the  harassing need of conferring a permanent revenue upon Congress. He had  already written a memorial, distributed over the State, setting forth  the dangerous position of the country. But Clinton was lord of the  masses, and their representatives in the Legislature had been trained to  think as he thought. They honoured him because he had made New York the  greatest State in the Union, not yet realizing that he had brought her  into disrepute at home and abroad, and that his selfish policy was now  hastening her to her ruin. To increase the power of Congress was to  encourage the spirit of Nationalism, and that meant the sure decline of  the States and of himself. The fight was hot and bitter. Clinton won;  but the thinking men present took Hamilton's words home and pondered  upon them, and in time they bore fruit.    
After many delays the Convention was summoned to meet at Philadelphia on  the 14th of May. History calls it the Constitutional Convention, but its  promoters were careful to give the States-right people no such guide to  contravention. The violent oppositionists of all change slumbered  peacefully, while the representatives of the more enlightened were  appointed to the Convention under moderately worded and somewhat vague  resolutions; and some of them went as vaguely. Congress, after a  characteristic and selfish hesitation, and a thorough fright induced by  the Massachusetts rebellion, was finally persuaded to give her official  sanction to the proposed Convention. Hamilton secured his appointment as  a delegate,--after a hard fight to have New York represented at  all,--and found himself saddled with two Clintonians, Robert Yates and  John Lansing, Jr. But the first great step for which he had struggled,  since his Morristown letter to the Financier of the Revolution seven  years before, was assured at last.    
Shortly before the Convention opened, Gouverneur Morris and James  Madison, Jr. met by appointment at Hamilton's house to discuss the plan  of campaign and make sure of their leader's wishes. General Schuyler  and Robert Troup were also present.    
Morris was a delegate from Pennsylvania, but was about to return to New  York, having bought the family estate at Morrisania from his brother,  Staats Long Morris, and was involved in business enterprises which  resulted in a large fortune. He awaited the settlement of the country's  affairs before sailing for Europe in his private interests. Troup, now a  successful lawyer at the New York bar, was an able politician and  devoted to Hamilton's interests. Philip Schuyler was entirely in his  son-in-law's confidence, working for and with him always, occupying the  double position of adviser and follower. Madison, who had forced the  Convention at Annapolis, had had his breath taken away by Hamilton's  coup, but now was delighted that he had been the instrument which made  it possible. He had composed his somewhat halting mind to the  determination to concentrate his energies upon wringing from the  Convention a national scheme of government after Hamilton's model,  provided that model were not too extreme: he was no monarchist, and knew  the people very thoroughly. But he was deeply anxious to have Hamilton's  views and plans for his guidance, even if modification were necessary.  He knew Hamilton's complete mastery of the science of government, and  that his broad structure was bound to be right, no matter what its  frills.    
The company assembled in the library, whose open windows overhung a  garden full of lilacs, dogwood, and maples. There was a long table in  the room, about which the guests mechanically seated themselves, so  accustomed were they to the council table. Hamilton had greeted them in  the hall, and sent them on to the library, while he went to fetch some  papers his wife had promised to copy for him.    
"So this is the room in which the government of the United States is to  be born," said Troup, glancing about at the familiar books and at the  desk stuffed with papers. "I shall always smell lilacs in the new  Constitution."    
"If we get one," observed Morris. "'Conceive' would be a better word  than 'born,' Twelve states,--for my part I am glad the refusal of Rhode  Island to send delegates makes one less,--each wanting its own way, and  the North inevitably pitted against the South: I confess that  'still-born' strikes me as a better word than any."    
"We'll have a Constitution," said Madison, doggedly, "I've made up my  mind to that. There are a sufficient number of able and public-spirited  men on their way to Philadelphia to agree upon a wise scheme of  government and force it through--besides Hamilton and ourselves there  are Washington, Governor Randolph, William Livingston, Rufus King, Roger  Sherman, Dr. Franklin, James Wilson, George Wythe, the Pinckneys, Hugh  Williamson--to mention but a few."    
"They are not a bad lot," admitted Morris, "if they had all seen more of  the world and less of their native or adopted State--all this State  patriotism makes me sick. Half were not born in the State they  vociferate about, are not certain of ending their days in it, nor of  which their children may adopt as intemperately."    
"Travel is not the only cure for provincialism," said General Schuyler.  "Dr. Franklin, I happen to know, is bent upon a form of government  little firmer than the one now existing; and Hamilton, whose travels are  limited to campaigning in the different States, has a comprehensive  grasp of European political machinery, and the breadth of vision such  knowledge involves, which could gain nothing by personal contact."    
"Dr. Franklin was too long a mendicant at foreign courts not to be  besottedly in love with their antithesis, and Hamilton has a brain power  and an intellectual grasp which quite remove him from the odiums of  comparison," said Morris. "I think myself he is fortunate in never  having visited Europe, deeply as he may regret it; for with his faculty  of divination he goes straight for what is best only--or most essential.  Had he lived there, the details and disappointments might have blocked  his vision and upset the fine balance of his mind. There she is!"    
He was at the window as quickly as he could have flung a book to the  lilacs, despite his wooden leg; and he was followed by Troup and  General Schuyler, demanding "Who?"    
"Mrs. Croix--there. Did anything so lovely ever dawn upon a distracted  American's vision? 'Tis said she is an unregistered daughter of the  house of Capet, and I vow she looks every inch a princess. I stared at  her so long last night in Vauxhall that she was embarrassed; and I never  saw such poise, such royal command of homage. How has she developed it  at the age of eighteen? I half believe this tale of royal birth;  although there are those who assert that she is nothing less than the  daughter of our highest in honour."    
"'Tis said that she had an opportunity to acquire her aplomb in the  village of Rutland, Massachusetts, where for some years she enlivened  the exile and soothed the domestic yearnings of many British officers,"  said Troup. "One told me that he would vow she was none other than the  famous vagrant 'Betsey.'"    
"But I am told that she comes of a respectable Rhode Island family named  Bowen," observed General Schuyler, who was not romantic. "That she was  wayward and ran off with Colonel Croix, of whose other wife there is no  proof, but that none of these fancy stories are true."    
"Then wherein lies her claim to the name of Capet?" demanded Morris.  "'Twould be nothing remarkable were she a daughter of Louis V., and I'm  told she signs her name Eliza Capet Croix."    
"I don't know," said Schuyler, meekly. "'Tis easy enough to assume a  name, if you have it not. I am told that Lady Sterling is assured of her  respectability. She certainly shines upon us like a star at this moment.  I did not know that women had such hair."    
"Is this what we came here to discuss?" asked a voice, dropped to the  register of profound contempt. They turned about with a laugh and faced  Madison's ascetic countenance, pale with disgust. "We have the most  important work to do for which men ever met together, and we stand at  the window and talk scandal about a silly woman and her hair."    
"You did not, my dear James," said Morris, lightly; "and thereby you  have missed the truly divine stimulus for the day's work. Don't you  realize, my friend, that no matter how hard a man may labour, some woman  is always in the background of his mind? She is the one reward of  virtue."    
"I know nothing of the sort," replied Madison, contemptuously. "I can  flatter myself that I at least am independent of what appears to men  like you to be the only motive for living."    
"Right, my boy, but great as you are, you don't know what you might have  been."    
The door opened, and Hamilton entered the room, his hands full of  papers, his face as gay and eager as if he were about to read to his  audience a poem or a lively tale. Perhaps one secret of his ascendency  over those who knew him best was that he never appeared to take himself  seriously, even when his whole being radiated power and imperious  determination. When he descended to the depths of seriousness and his  individuality was most overwhelming, his unsleeping sense of humour  saved him from a hint of the demagogue.    
"While my wife was finishing, I heard you gossiping from the window  above," he said, "but I had by far the best view. The lilac bushes--"    
"Do you know her?" asked Morris, eagerly.    
"Alas, I do not. It is incalculable months since I have had time to look  so long at a woman. What is the matter, Madison?"    
"I am nauseated. I had thought that <i>you</i>--"    
Here even General Schuyler laughed, and Hamilton hurriedly arranged his  papers.    
He sat down when he began to talk, but was quickly on his feet and  shaking his papers over the table. To him, also, the council table was  the most familiar article of furniture in his world, but he was usually  addressing those it stood for, and he was too ardent a speaker, even  when without the incentive of debate, to keep to his chair.    
"I know what you are wondering," he said. "No, it is not the British  Constitution. What I have done so distempered as to impress people with  the belief that I am blind to the spirit of this country, I am at a loss  to conjecture. The British Constitution is the best form which the world  has yet produced; in the words of Necker, it is the only government  'which unites public strength with individual security,' Nevertheless,  no one is more fully convinced than I that none but a republican  government can be attempted in this country, or would be adapted to our  situation. Therefore, I propose to look to the British Constitution for  nothing but those elements of stability and permanency which a  republican system requires, and which may be incorporated into it  without changing its characteristic principles. There never has been,  and there never will be, anything in my acts or principles inconsistent  with the spirit of republican liberty. Whatever my private  predilections, it would be impossible for me, understanding the people  of this country as I do, to fail to recognize the authority of that  people as the source of all political power. Therefore you will find  many departures from the British Constitution in the rough draft I am  about to read. I have neither the patience nor the temper to dogmatize  upon abstract theories of liberty, and our success will lie in adapting  to our particular needs such principles of government as have been tried  and not found wanting, our failure in visionary experiments. The best  and wisest effort we can make will be a sufficient experiment, for whose  result we must all tremble.    
"It is going to be difficult to persuade this Convention to unite upon  any constitution very much stronger than the one Dr. Franklin will  propose, or to accomplish its ratification afterward. Nevertheless, I  have prepared a draft of the strongest constitution short of monarchy  which it is possible to conceive, and which I shall propose to the  Convention for reasons I will explain after I have read it to you. Do  you care to listen?"    
"Hurry up!" exclaimed Morris. The audience leaned forward. Madison shook  his head all through the reading; Morris jerked his with emphatic  approval.    
The radical points in which Hamilton's constitution differed from that  under which we live, was in the demand for a President, to be elected by  property holders, and who should hold office during good behaviour;  senators possessing certain property qualifications and elected on the  same principle; and governors of States appointed and removable by the  President. Practically the author of the dual government, he believed  emphatically in subserving the lesser to the greater, although endowing  the States with sufficient power for self-protection. The Executive was  to be held personally responsible for official misconduct, both he and  the senators subject to impeachment and to removal from office. The  whole scheme was wrought out with the mathematical complexity and  precision characteristic of Hamilton's mind.    
"Would that it were possible," exclaimed Morris, when Hamilton had  finished. "But as well expect the Almighty to drive the quill. You will  weaken your influence, Hamilton, and to no effect."    
"Ah, but I have calculated upon two distinct points, and I believe I  shall achieve them. I have not the most distant hope that this paper  will be acceptable to five men in the Convention,--three, perhaps, would  round the number,--Washington, yourself, myself. Nevertheless, I shall  introduce it and speak in its favour with all the passion of which I am  master, for these reasons: I believe in it; its energy is bound to give  a tone that might be lacking otherwise; and--this is the principal  point--<i>there must be something to work back from</i>. If I alarm with the  mere chance of so perilous a menace to their democratic ideals, they  will go to work in earnest at <i>something</i> in order to defeat me, and  they will not go back so far in the line of vigour as if I had suggested  a more moderate plan; for, mark my words, they would infallibly incline  to weaker measures than <i>any</i> firm government which should first be  proposed. In the management of men one of the most important things to  bear in mind is their proneness to work forward from the weak, and  backward from the strong. On the quality of the strength depends its  magnetism over the weak. All reformers are ridiculed or outlawed, and  their measures are never wholly successful; but they awaken men's minds  to something of approximate worth, and to a desire for a divorce from  the old order of things. So, while I expect to be called a monarchist, I  hope to instil subtly the idea of the absolute necessity of a strong  government, and implant in their minds a distrust of one too weak."    
"Good," said Morris. "And it is always a delight to see your revelation  of yourself in a new light. I perceive that to your other  accomplishments you add the cunning of the fox."    
"You are right to call it an accomplishment," retorted Hamilton. "We  cannot go through life successfully with the bare gifts of the Almighty,  generous though He may have been. If I find that I have need of cunning,  or brutality,--than which nothing is farther from my nature,--or even  nagging, I do not hesitate to borrow and use them."    
"Let us call this sagacity," said Troup. "'Tis a prettier word. Or the  canniness of the Scot. But there is one thing I fear," he added  anxiously. "You may injure your chances of future preferment. Your  ambition will be thought too vaulting, particularly for so young a man,  and, besides, you may be thought a menace to the commonwealth."    
"That is a point to be considered, Hamilton," said General Schuyler.    
"I have an end to gain, sir, and I mean to gain it. Moreover, this is no  time to be considering private interests. If this be not the day for  patriotism to stifle every personal ambition, then there is little hope  for human nature. I believe the result of this paper will be a  constitution of respectable strength, and I shall use all the influence  I wield to make the people accept it. So, if you worry, consider if the  later effort will not outweigh the first."    
"Hamilton," said Madison, solemnly, "you are a greater man even than I  thought you. You have given me a most welcome hint, and I shall take  upon myself to engineer the recession from your constitution. I shall  study its effect with the closest attention and be guided accordingly, I  am heart and soul in this matter, and would give my life to it if  necessary. I never should have thought of anything so astute," he added,  with some envy, "but perhaps if I had, no one else would be so  peculiarly fitted as myself to work upon its manifold suggestions. I  hope I do not strike you as conceited," he said, looking around  anxiously, "but I <i>feel</i> that it is in me to render efficient service in  the present crisis."    
Before Morris could launch his ready fling, Hamilton hastened to assure  Madison of his belief that no man living could render services so great.  He underrated neither Madison's great abilities nor the danger of  rankling arrows in that sensitive and not too courageous spirit. They  then discussed a general plan of campaign and the best methods of  managing certain members of the Convention. Morris was the first to  rise.    
"Adieu," he said. "I go to ruminate upon our Captain's diplomacy, and to  pursue the ankle of Mrs. Croix. Be sure that the one will not interfere  with the other, but will mutually stimulate."    
The other gentlemen adjourned to the dining room.
