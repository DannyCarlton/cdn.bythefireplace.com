THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,<br> with God's wrath laden, Grendel came.<br> The monster was minded of mankind now<br> sundry to seize in the stately house.<br> Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace there,<br> gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,<br> flashing with fretwork. Not first time, this,<br> that he the home of Hrothgar sought, --<br> yet ne'er in his life-day, late or early,<br> such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!<br> To the house the warrior walked apace,<br> parted from peace;[1] the portal opended,<br> though with forged bolts fast, when his fists had<br> struck it,<br> and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,<br> the house's mouth. All hastily, then,<br> o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod on,<br> ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes<br> fearful flashes, like flame to see. 
He spied in hall the hero-band,<br> kin and clansmen clustered asleep,<br> hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;<br> for the monster was minded, ere morn should dawn,<br> savage, to sever the soul of each,<br> life from body, since lusty banquet<br> waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him<br> to seize any more of men on earth<br> after that evening. Eagerly watched<br> Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,<br> how he would fare in fell attack.<br> Not that the monster was minded to pause!<br> Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior<br> for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,<br> the bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,<br> swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus<br> the lifeless corse was clear devoured,<br> e'en feet and hands. Then farther he hied;<br> for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,<br> felt for the foe with fiendish claw,<br> for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it boldly,<br> prompt to answer, propped on his arm.<br> Soon then saw that shepherd-of-evils<br> that never he met in this middle-world,<br> in the ways of earth, another wight<br> with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he feared,<br> sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!<br> Fain would he flee, his fastness seek,<br> the den of devils: no doings now<br> such as oft he had done in days of old!<br> Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane<br> of his boast at evening: up he bounded,<br> grasped firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.<br> The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.<br> The monster meant -- if he might at all --<br> to fling himself free, and far away<br> fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power<br> in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march<br> to Heorot this monster of harm had made!<br> Din filled the room; the Danes were bereft,<br> castle-dwellers and clansmen all,<br> earls, of their ale. Angry were both<br> those savage hall-guards: the house resounded.<br> Wonder it was the wine-hall firm<br> in the strain of their struggle stood, to earth<br> the fair house fell not; too fast it was<br> within and without by its iron bands<br> craftily clamped; though there crashed from sill<br> many a mead-bench -- men have told me --<br> gay with gold, where the grim foes wrestled.<br> So well had weened the wisest Scyldings<br> that not ever at all might any man<br> that bone-decked, brave house break asunder,<br> crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire<br> in smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose<br> din redoubled. Danes of the North<br> with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,<br> who from the wall that wailing heard,<br> God's foe sounding his grisly song,<br> cry of the conquered, clamorous pain<br> from captive of hell. Too closely held him<br> he who of men in might was strongest<br> in that same day of this our life. 
[1] That is, he was a "lost soul," doomed to hell. 
<b>XII</b> 
NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence[1]<br> suffer that slaughterous stranger to live,<br> useless deeming his days and years<br> to men on earth. Now many an earl<br> of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,<br> fain the life of their lord to shield,<br> their praised prince, if power were theirs;<br> never they knew, -- as they neared the foe,<br> hardy-hearted heroes of war,<br> aiming their swords on every side<br> the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,<br> no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,<br> could harm or hurt that hideous fiend!<br> He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,<br> from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting<br> on that same day of this our life<br> woful should be, and his wandering soul<br> far off flit to the fiends' domain.<br> Soon he found, who in former days,<br> harmful in heart and hated of God,<br> on many a man such murder wrought,<br> that the frame of his body failed him now.<br> For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac<br> held in hand; hateful alive<br> was each to other. The outlaw dire<br> took mortal hurt; a mighty wound<br> showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,<br> and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now<br> the glory was given, and Grendel thence<br> death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,<br> noisome abode: he knew too well<br> that here was the last of life, an end<br> of his days on earth. -- To all the Danes<br> by that bloody battle the boon had come.<br> From ravage had rescued the roving stranger<br> Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise one<br> had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,<br> his deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes<br> had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,<br> all their sorrow and ills assuaged,<br> their bale of battle borne so long,<br> and all the dole they erst endured<br> pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of this,<br> when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,<br> arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,<br> of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof.

MANY at morning, as men have told me,<br> warriors gathered the gift-hall round,<br> folk-leaders faring from far and near,<br> o'er wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,<br> trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed<br> the enemy's end to any man<br> who saw by the gait of the graceless foe<br> how the weary-hearted, away from thence,<br> baffled in battle and banned, his steps<br> death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.<br> Bloody the billows were boiling there,<br> turbid the tide of tumbling waves<br> horribly seething, with sword-blood hot,<br> by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor<br> laid forlorn his life adown,<br> his heathen soul, and hell received it.<br> Home then rode the hoary clansmen<br> from that merry journey, and many a youth,<br> on horses white, the hardy warriors,<br> back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory<br> eager they echoed, and all averred<br> that from sea to sea, or south or north,<br> there was no other in earth's domain,<br> under vault of heaven, more valiant found,<br> of warriors none more worthy to rule!<br> (On their lord beloved they laid no slight,<br> gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!)<br> From time to time, the tried-in-battle<br> their gray steeds set to gallop amain,<br> and ran a race when the road seemed fair.<br> From time to time, a thane of the king,<br> who had made many vaunts, and was mindful of verses,<br> stored with sagas and songs of old,<br> bound word to word in well-knit rime,<br> welded his lay; this warrior soon<br> of Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,<br> and artfully added an excellent tale,<br> in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds<br> he had heard in saga of Sigemund.<br> Strange the story: he said it all, --<br> the Waelsing's wanderings wide, his struggles,<br> which never were told to tribes of men,<br> the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,<br> when of these doings he deigned to speak,<br> uncle to nephew; as ever the twain<br> stood side by side in stress of war,<br> and multitude of the monster kind<br> they had felled with their swords. Of Sigemund grew,<br> when he passed from life, no little praise;<br> for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed<br> that herded the hoard:[1] under hoary rock<br> the atheling dared the deed alone<br> fearful quest, nor was Fitela there.<br> Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced<br> that wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,<br> best blade; the dragon died in its blood.<br> Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved<br> over the ring-hoard to rule at will,<br> himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,<br> and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,<br> son of Waels; the worm was consumed.<br> He had of all heroes the highest renown<br> among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,<br> for deeds of daring that decked his name<br> since the hand and heart of Heremod<br> grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished<br> to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,<br> to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow<br> had lamed him too long; a load of care<br> to earls and athelings all he proved.<br> Oft indeed, in earlier days,<br> for the warrior's wayfaring wise men mourned,<br> who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,<br> and had thought their sovran's son would thrive,<br> follow his father, his folk protect,<br> the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,<br> home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,<br> the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed<br> to all: the other[2] was urged to crime!<br> And afresh to the race,[3] the fallow roads<br> by swift steeds measured! The morning sun<br> was climbing higher. Clansmen hastened<br> to the high-built hall, those hardy-minded,<br> the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,<br> crowned with glory, the king himself,<br> with stately band from the bride-bower strode;<br> and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens<br> measured the path to the mead-house fair.

[3] The singer has<br> sung his lays, and the epic resumes its story. The time-relations are not altogether good in this long passage which describes the rejoicings of "the day after"; but the present shift from the riders on the road to the folk at the hall is not very violent, and is of a piece with the general style.

HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,<br> stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,<br> garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand: --<br> "For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler<br> be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows<br> I have borne from Grendel; but God still works<br> wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.<br> It was but now that I never more<br> for woes that weighed on me waited help<br> long as I lived, when, laved in blood,<br> stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --<br> widespread woe for wise men all,<br> who had no hope to hinder ever<br> foes infernal and fiendish sprites<br> from havoc in hall. This hero now,<br> by the Wielder's might, a work has done<br> that not all of us erst could ever do<br> by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say<br> whoso of women this warrior bore<br> among sons of men, if still she liveth,<br> that the God of the ages was good to her<br> in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,<br> of heroes best, I shall heartily love<br> as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever<br> this kinship new: thou shalt never lack<br> wealth of the world that I wield as mine!<br> Full oft for less have I largess showered,<br> my precious hoard, on a punier man,<br> less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now<br> fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure<br> through all the ages. As ever he did,<br> well may the Wielder reward thee still!"<br> Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "This work of war most willingly<br> we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared<br> force of the foe. Fain, too, were I<br> hadst thou but seen himself, what time<br> the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!<br> Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe<br> on his bed of death to bind him down,<br> that he in the hent of this hand of mine<br> should breathe his last: but he broke away.<br> Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --<br> hinder from flight, and firm enough hold<br> the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,<br> the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,<br> he left behind him his hand in pledge,<br> arm and shoulder; nor aught of help<br> could the cursed one thus procure at all.<br> None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,<br> sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him<br> tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,<br> in baleful bonds, where bide he must,<br> evil outlaw, such awful doom<br> as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out." 
More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf[1]<br> in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,<br> since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,<br> beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,<br> foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each<br> of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --<br> heathen's "hand-spear," hostile warrior's<br> claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,<br> that him no blade of the brave could touch,<br> how keen soever, or cut away<br> that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.

THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now<br> for hands to bedeck it, and dense was the throng<br> of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,<br> the guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings<br> that were wove on the wall, and wonders many<br> to delight each mortal that looks upon them.<br> Though braced within by iron bands,<br> that building bright was broken sorely;[1]<br> rent were its hinges; the roof alone<br> held safe and sound, when, seared with crime,<br> the fiendish foe his flight essayed,<br> of life despairing. -- No light thing that,<br> the flight for safety, -- essay it who will!<br> Forced of fate, he shall find his way<br> to the refuge ready for race of man,<br> for soul-possessors, and sons of earth;<br> and there his body on bed of death<br> shall rest after revel.<br> Arrived was the hour<br> when to hall proceeded Healfdene's son:<br> the king himself would sit to banquet.<br> Ne'er heard I of host in haughtier throng<br> more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!<br> Bowed then to bench those bearers-of-glory,<br> fain of the feasting. Featly received<br> many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,<br> kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall,<br> Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now<br> was filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings<br> ne'er yet had tried the traitor's deed.<br> To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene<br> a gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,<br> broidered battle-flag, breastplate and helmet;<br> and a splendid sword was seen of many<br> borne to the brave one. Beowulf took<br> cup in hall:[2] for such costly gifts<br> he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.<br> For I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,<br> with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,<br> on the ale-bench honoring others thus!<br> O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,<br> wound with wires, kept ward o'er the head,<br> lest the relict-of-files[3] should fierce invade,<br> sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero<br> should go to grapple against his foes.<br> Then the earls'-defence[4] on the floor[5] bade lead<br> coursers eight, with carven head-gear,<br> adown the hall: one horse was decked<br> with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;<br> 'twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,<br> when to play of swords the son of Healfdene<br> was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor<br> in the crush of combat when corpses fell.<br> To Beowulf over them both then gave<br> the refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,<br> o'er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.<br> Manfully thus the mighty prince,<br> hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight repaid<br> with steeds and treasures contemned by none<br> who is willing to say the sooth aright. 
[1] There is no horrible inconsistency here such as the critics strive and cry about. In spite of the ruin that Grendel and Beowulf had made within the hall, the framework and roof held firm, and swift repairs made the interior habitable. Tapestries were hung on the walls, and willing hands prepared the banquet. 
[2] From its formal use in other places, this phrase, to take cup in hall, or "on the floor," would seem to mean that Beowulf stood up to receive his gifts, drink to the donor, and say thanks.

AND the lord of earls, to each that came<br> with Beowulf over the briny ways,<br> an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,<br> precious gift; and the price[1] bade pay<br> in gold for him whom Grendel erst<br> murdered, -- and fain of them more had killed,<br> had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,<br> and the man's[2] brave mood. The Maker then<br> ruled human kind, as here and now.<br> Therefore is insight always best,<br> and forethought of mind. How much awaits him<br> of lief and of loath, who long time here,<br> through days of warfare this world endures! 
Then song and music mingled sounds<br> in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies[3]<br> and harping was heard with the hero-lay<br> as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke<br> along the mead-seats, making his song<br> of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.[4]<br> Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,<br> was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.[5]<br> Hildeburh needed not hold in value<br> her enemies' honor![6] Innocent both<br> were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,<br> bairn and brother, they bowed to fate,<br> stricken by spears; 'twas a sorrowful woman!<br> None doubted why the daughter of Hoc<br> bewailed her doom when dawning came,<br> and under the sky she saw them lying,<br> kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned<br> of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too,<br> Finn's own liegemen, and few were left;<br> in the parleying-place[7] he could ply no longer<br> weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,<br> and rescue his remnant by right of arms<br> from the prince's thane. A pact he offered:<br> another dwelling the Danes should have,<br> hall and high-seat, and half the power<br> should fall to them in Frisian land;<br> and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son<br> day by day the Danes should honor,<br> the folk of Hengest favor with rings,<br> even as truly, with treasure and jewels,<br> with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin<br> he meant to honor in ale-hall there.<br> Pact of peace they plighted further<br> on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest<br> with oath, upon honor, openly promised<br> that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid,<br> nobly to govern, so none of the guests<br> by word or work should warp the treaty,[8]<br> or with malice of mind bemoan themselves<br> as forced to follow their fee-giver's slayer,<br> lordless men, as their lot ordained.<br> Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman's taunt,<br> that murderous hatred to mind recall,<br> then edge of the sword must seal his doom. 
Oaths were given, and ancient gold<br> heaped from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding,<br> battle-thane best,[9] on his balefire lay.<br> All on the pyre were plain to see<br> the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,<br> boar of hard iron, and athelings many<br> slain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell.<br> It was Hildeburh's hest, at Hnaef's own pyre<br> the bairn of her body on brands to lay,<br> his bones to burn, on the balefire placed,<br> at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges<br> bewept them the woman: great wailing ascended.<br> Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires,<br> roared o'er the hillock:[10] heads all were melted,<br> gashes burst, and blood gushed out<br> from bites[11] of the body. Balefire devoured,<br> greediest spirit, those spared not by war<br> out of either folk: their flower was gone.

[4] There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms. As before about Sigemund and Heremod, so now, though at greater length, about Finn and his feud, a lay is chanted or recited; and the epic poet, counting on his readers' familiarity with the story, -- a fragment of it still exists, -- simply gives the headings. 
[5] The exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not to be determined, but the following account of it is reasonable and has good support among scholars. Finn, a Frisian chieftain, who nevertheless has a "castle" outside the Frisian border, marries Hildeburh, a Danish princess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations between the two peoples have been strained before. Something starts the old feud anew; and the visitors are attacked in their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on both sides. Peace is patched up; a stately funeral is held; and the surviving visitors become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back with him to Frisia. So matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the Danes; but he is set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is killed in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their home a force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm Finn's stronghold, kill him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh. 
[6] The "enemies" must be the Frisians. 
[7] Battlefield. -- Hengest is the "prince's thane," companion of Hnaef. "Folcwald's son" is Finn. 
[8] That is, Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish warriors who were left, provided, of course, that none of them tried to renew the quarrel or avenge Hnaef their fallen lord. If, again, one of Finn's Frisians began a quarrel, he should die by the sword.

THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,<br> friendless, to find the Frisian land,<br> houses and high burg. Hengest still<br> through the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,<br> holding pact, yet of home he minded,<br> though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive<br> over the waters, now waves rolled fierce<br> lashed by the winds, or winter locked them<br> in icy fetters. Then fared another<br> year to men's dwellings, as yet they do,<br> the sunbright skies, that their season ever<br> duly await. Far off winter was driven;<br> fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover,<br> the guest, to depart, though more gladly he pondered<br> on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,<br> and how to hasten the hot encounter<br> where sons of the Frisians were sure to be.<br> So he escaped not the common doom,<br> when Hun with "Lafing," the light-of-battle,<br> best of blades, his bosom pierced:<br> its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.<br> On fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,<br> on himself at home, the horrid sword-death;<br> for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack<br> had sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,<br> mourning their woes.[1] Finn's wavering spirit<br> bode not in breast. The burg was reddened<br> with blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,<br> king amid clansmen; the queen was taken.<br> To their ship the Scylding warriors bore<br> all the chattels the chieftain owned,<br> whatever they found in Finn's domain<br> of gems and jewels. The gentle wife<br> o'er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,<br> led to her land.<br> The lay was finished,<br> the gleeman's song. Then glad rose the revel;<br> bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw<br> from their "wonder-vats" wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,<br> under gold-crown goes where the good pair sit,<br> uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,<br> kindred in amity. Unferth the spokesman<br> at the Scylding lord's feet sat: men had faith in his spirit,<br> his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found him<br> unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:<br> "Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,<br> breaker of rings, and blithe be thou,<br> gold-friend of men; to the Geats here speak<br> such words of mildness as man should use.<br> Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,<br> or near or far, which now thou hast. 
Men say to me, as son thou wishest<br> yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot purged,<br> jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,<br> with many a largess; and leave to thy kin<br> folk and realm when forth thou goest<br> to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem<br> my Hrothulf,[2] willing to hold and rule<br> nobly our youths, if thou yield up first,<br> prince of Scyldings, thy part in the world.<br> I ween with good he will well requite<br> offspring of ours, when all he minds<br> that for him we did in his helpless days<br> of gift and grace to gain him honor!"<br> Then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced,<br> Hrethric and Hrothmund, with heroes' bairns,<br> young men together: the Geat, too, sat there,<br> Beowulf brave, the brothers between. 
[1] That is, these two Danes, escaping home, had told the story of the attack on Hnaef, the slaying of Hengest, and all the Danish woes. Collecting a force, they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his home. 
[2] Nephew to Hrothgar, with whom he subsequently quarrels, and elder cousin to the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow, -- their natural guardian in the event of the king's death. There is something finely feminine in this speech of Wealhtheow's, apart from its somewhat irregular and irrelevant sequence of topics. Both she and her lord probably distrust Hrothulf; but she bids the king to be of good cheer, and, turning to the suspect, heaps affectionate assurances on his probity. "My own Hrothulf" will surely not forget these favors and benefits of the past, but will repay them to the orphaned boy.

A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting<br> and winsome words. Of wounden gold,<br> she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,<br> corselet and rings, and of collars the noblest<br> that ever I knew the earth around.<br> Ne'er heard I so mighty, 'neath heaven's dome,<br> a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore<br> to his bright-built burg the Brisings' necklace,<br> jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy fled he,<br> Eormenric's hate: chose help eternal.<br> Hygelac Geat, grandson of Swerting,<br> on the last of his raids this ring bore with him,<br> under his banner the booty defending,<br> the war-spoil warding; but Wyrd o'erwhelmed him<br> what time, in his daring, dangers he sought,<br> feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems<br> he bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,<br> sovran strong: under shield he died.<br> Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,<br> gear of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;<br> weaker warriors won the spoil,<br> after gripe of battle, from Geatland's lord,<br> and held the death-field.<br> Din rose in hall.<br> Wealhtheow spake amid warriors, and said: --<br> "This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,<br> Beowulf lov'd, these battle-weeds wear,<br> a royal treasure, and richly thrive!<br> Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here<br> counsel in kindness: requital be mine.<br> Hast done such deeds, that for days to come<br> thou art famed among folk both far and near,<br> so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean<br> his windy walls. Through the ways of life<br> prosper, O prince! I pray for thee<br> rich possessions. To son of mine<br> be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!<br> Here every earl to the other is true,<br> mild of mood, to the master loyal!<br> Thanes are friendly, the throng obedient,<br> liegemen are revelling: list and obey!"<br> Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of feasts;<br> flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,<br> destiny dire, and the doom to be seen<br> by many an earl when eve should come,<br> and Hrothgar homeward hasten away,<br> royal, to rest. The room was guarded<br> by an army of earls, as erst was done.<br> They bared the bench-boards; abroad they spread<br> beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser<br> in danger of doom lay down in the hall. -- 
At their heads they set their shields of war,<br> bucklers bright; on the bench were there<br> over each atheling, easy to see,<br> the high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,<br> the corselet of rings. 'Twas their custom so<br> ever to be for battle prepared,<br> at home, or harrying, which it were,<br> even as oft as evil threatened<br> their sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.

THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought<br> his rest of the evening, -- as ofttime had happened<br> when Grendel guarded that golden hall,<br> evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,<br> slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told<br> how an avenger survived the fiend,<br> as was learned afar. The livelong time<br> after that grim fight, Grendel's mother,<br> monster of women, mourned her woe.<br> She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,<br> cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down<br> with edge of the sword his only brother,<br> his father's offspring: outlawed he fled,<br> marked with murder, from men's delights<br> warded the wilds. -- There woke from him<br> such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,<br> war-wolf horrid, at Heorot found<br> a warrior watching and waiting the fray,<br> with whom the grisly one grappled amain.<br> But the man remembered his mighty power,<br> the glorious gift that God had sent him,<br> in his Maker's mercy put his trust<br> for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe,<br> felled the fiend, who fled abject,<br> reft of joy, to the realms of death,<br> mankind's foe. And his mother now,<br> gloomy and grim, would go that quest<br> of sorrow, the death of her son to avenge.<br> To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes<br> slept in the hall. Too soon came back<br> old ills of the earls, when in she burst,<br> the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,<br> e'en as terror of woman in war is less,<br> might of maid, than of men in arms<br> when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,<br> sword gore-stained, through swine of the helm,<br> crested, with keen blade carves amain.<br> Then was in hall the hard-edge drawn,<br> the swords on the settles,[1] and shields a-many<br> firm held in hand: nor helmet minded<br> nor harness of mail, whom that horror seized.<br> Haste was hers; she would hie afar<br> and save her life when the liegemen saw her.<br> Yet a single atheling up she seized<br> fast and firm, as she fled to the moor.<br> He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,<br> of trusty vassals betwixt the seas,<br> whom she killed on his couch, a clansman famous,<br> in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;<br> another house had been held apart,<br> after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned. --<br> Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,<br> blood-flecked, she bore with her; bale was returned,<br> dole in the dwellings: 'twas dire exchange<br> where Dane and Geat were doomed to give<br> the lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,<br> the hoary hero, at heart was sad<br> when he knew his noble no more lived,<br> and dead indeed was his dearest thane.<br> To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,<br> dauntless victor. As daylight broke,<br> along with his earls the atheling lord,<br> with his clansmen, came where the king abode<br> waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All<br> would turn this tale of trouble and woe.<br> Strode o'er floor the famed-in-strife,<br> with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded, --<br> wishing to greet the wise old king,<br> Ingwines' lord; he asked if the night<br> had passed in peace to the prince's mind.

HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings: --<br> "Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed<br> to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,<br> of Yrmenlaf the elder brother,<br> my sage adviser and stay in council,<br> shoulder-comrade in stress of fight<br> when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,<br> hewed the helm-boars; hero famed<br> should be every earl as Aeschere was!<br> But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him<br> of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,[1]<br> proud of the prey, her path she took,<br> fain of her fill. The feud she avenged<br> that yesternight, unyieldingly,<br> Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, --<br> seeing how long these liegemen mine<br> he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,<br> in arms he fell. Now another comes,<br> keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,<br> faring far in feud of blood:<br> so that many a thane shall think, who e'er<br> sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,<br> this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low<br> that once was willing each wish to please.<br> Land-dwellers here[2] and liegemen mine,<br> who house by those parts, I have heard relate<br> that such a pair they have sometimes seen,<br> march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,<br> wandering spirits: one of them seemed,<br> so far as my folk could fairly judge,<br> of womankind; and one, accursed,<br> in man's guise trod the misery-track<br> of exile, though huger than human bulk.<br> Grendel in days long gone they named him,<br> folk of the land; his father they knew not,<br> nor any brood that was born to him<br> of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;<br> by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,<br> fenways fearful, where flows the stream<br> from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,<br> underground flood. Not far is it hence<br> in measure of miles that the mere expands,<br> and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging,<br> sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.<br> By night is a wonder weird to see,<br> fire on the waters. So wise lived none<br> of the sons of men, to search those depths!<br> Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,<br> the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,<br> long distance driven, his dear life first<br> on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge<br> to hide his head: 'tis no happy place!<br> Thence the welter of waters washes up<br> wan to welkin when winds bestir<br> evil storms, and air grows dusk,<br> and the heavens weep. Now is help once more<br> with thee alone! The land thou knowst not,<br> place of fear, where thou findest out<br> that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!<br> I will reward thee, for waging this fight,<br> with ancient treasure, as erst I did,<br> with winding gold, if thou winnest back." 
[1] He surmises presently where she is. 
[2] The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of acute grief, are said; and according to Germanic sequence of thought, inexorable here, the next and only topic is revenge. But is it possible? Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a skillful and often effective description of the horrors which surround the monster's home and await the attempt of an avenging foe.
