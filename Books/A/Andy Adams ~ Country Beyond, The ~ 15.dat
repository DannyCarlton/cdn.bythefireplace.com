  Through the blizzard Jolly Roger made his way a score of miles   southward from the big dune on the Barren. For a day and a night  he  made his camp in the scrub timber which edged the vast treeless   tundras reaching to the Arctic. He believed he was safe, for the   unceasing wind and the blasts of shot-like snow filled his tracks  a  few moments after they were made. He struck a straight line for  his  cabin after that first day and night in the scrub timber. The  storm  was still a thing of terrific force out on the barren, but  in the  timber he was fairly well sheltered. He was convinced the  police  patrol would find his cabin very soon after the storm had  worn itself  out. Porter and Tavish did not trouble him. But from  Breault he knew  there was no getting away. Breault would nose out  his cabin. And for  that reason he was determined to reach it  first. 
  The second night he did not sleep. His mind was a wild thing&#8212;wild   as a Loup-Garou seeking out its ghostly trails; it passed beyond  his  mastery, keeping sleep away from him though he was dead tired.  It  carried him back over all the steps of his outlawry, visioning  for him  the score of times he had escaped, as he was narrowly  escaping now;  and it pictured for him, like a creature of  inquisition, the  tightening net ahead of him, the final futility  of all his effort. And  at last, as if moved by pity to ease his  suffering a little, it  brought him back vividly to the green  valley, the flowers and the blue  skies of Cragg's Ridge&#8212;and Nada. 
  It was like a dream. At times he could scarcely assure himself   that he had actually lived those weeks and months of happiness  down  on the edge of civilization; it seemed impossible that Nada  had come  like an Angel into his life down there, and that she had  loved him,  even when he confessed himself a fugitive from the law  and had  entreated him to take her with him. He closed his eyes and  that last  roaring night of storm at Cragg's Ridge was about him  again. He was in  the little old Missioner's cabin, with thunder  and lightning rending  earth and sky outside and Nada was in his  arms, her lips against his,  the piteous heartbreak of despair in  her eyes. Then he saw her&#8212;a  moment later&#8212;a crumpled heap down  beside the chair, the disheveled  glory of her hair hiding her  white face from him as he hesitated for a  single instant before  opening the door and plunging out into the  night. 
  With a cry he sprang up, dashing the vision from him, and threw   fresh fuel on the fire. And he cried out the same old thought to   Peter. 
  &quot;It would have been murder for us to bring her, Pied-Bot. It would   have been murder!&quot; 
  He looked about him at the swirling chaos outside the rim of light   made by his fire and listened to the moaning of the wind over the   treetops. Beyond the circle of light the dry snow, which crunched   like sand under his feet, was lost in ghostly gloom. It was forty   degrees below zero. And he was glad, even with this sickness of   despair in his heart, that she was not a fugitive with him  tonight. 
  Yet he built up a little make-believe world for himself as he sat   with a blanket hugged close about him, staring into the fire. In a   hundred different ways he saw her face, a will-o-the-wisp thing  amid  the flames; an illusive, very girlish, almost childish face&#8212;  yet  always with the light of a woman's soul shining in it. That  was the  miracle which startled him at last. It seemed as if the  fiction he  built up in his despair transformed itself subtly into  fact and that  her soul had come to him from out of the southland  and was speaking to  him with eyes which never changed or faltered  in their adoration,  their faith and their courage. She seemed to  come to him, to creep  into his arms under the folds of the blanket  and he sensed the soft  crush of her hair, the touch of her lips,  the warm encircling of her  arms about his neck. Closer to him  pressed the mystery, until the  beating of her heart was a living  pulse against him; and  then&#8212;suddenly, as an irresistible impulse  closed his arms to hold the  spirit to him, his eyes were drawn to  the heart of the fire, and he  saw there for an instant, wide-eyed  and speaking to him, the face of  Yellow Bird the Indian sorceress.  The flames crept up the long braids  of her hair, her lips moved,  and then she was gone&#8212;but slowly, like a  ghost slipping upward  into the mist of smoke and night. 
  Peter heard his master's cry. And after that Jolly Roger rose up   and threw off the blanket and walked back and forth until his feet   trod a path in the snow. He told himself it was madness to  believe,  and yet he believed. Faith fought itself back into that  dark citadel  of his heart from which for a time it had been  driven. New courage  lighted up again the black chaos of his soul.  And at last he fell down  on his knees and gripped Peter's shaggy  head between his two hands. 
  &quot;Pied-Bot, she said everything would come out right in the end,&quot;   he cried, a new note in his voice. &quot;That's what Yellow Bird told  us,  wasn't it? Mebby they would have burned her as a witch a long  time ago  because she's a sorceress, and says she can send her soul  out of her  body and see what we can't see. BUT WE BELIEVE!&quot; His  voice choked up,  and he laughed. &quot;They were both here tonight,&quot; he  added. &quot;Nada&#8212;and  Yellow Bird. And I believe&#8212;I believe&#8212;I know  what it means!&quot; 
  He stood up again, and Peter saw the old smile on his master's   lips as Jolly Roger looked up into the swirling black canopy of  the  spruce-tops. And the wailing of the storm seemed no longer to  hold  menace and taunt, but in it he heard the whisper of fierce,  strong  voices urging upon him the conviction that had already  swept  indecision from his heart. 
  And then he said, holding out his arms as if encompassing   something which he could not see. 
  &quot;Peter, we're going back to Nada!&quot; 
  Dawn was a scarcely perceptible thing when it came. Darkness   seemed to fade a little, that was all. Frosty shapes took form in  the  gloom, and the spruce-tops became tangible in an abyss of  sepulchral  shadow overhead. 
  Through this beginning of the barren-land day Jolly Roger set out   in the direction of his cabin and in his blood was that new  singing  thing of fire and warmth that more than made up for the  hours of sleep  he had lost during the night. The storm was dying  out, he thought, and  it was growing warmer; yet the wind whistled  and raved in the open  spaces and his thermometer registered the  fortieth and a fraction  degree below zero. The air he breathed was  softer, he fancied, yet it  was still heavy with the stinging shot  of blizzard; and where  yesterday he had seen only the smothering  chaos of twisted spruce and  piled up snow, there was now&#8212;as the  pale day broadened&#8212;his old  wonderland of savage beauty, awaiting  only a flash of sunlight to  transform it into the pure glory of a  thing indescribable. But the sun  did not come and Jolly Roger did  not miss it over-much for his heart  was full of Nada, and a-thrill  with the inspiration of his home-going. 
  &quot;That's what it means, GOING HOME&quot; he said to Peter, who nosed   close in the path of his snowshoes. &quot;There's a thousand miles  between  us and Cragg's Ridge, a thousand miles of snow and ice&#8212;  and hell,  mebby. But we'll make it!&quot; 
  He was sure of himself now. It was as if he had come up from out   of the shadow of a great sickness. He had been unwise. He had not   reasoned as a man should reason. The hangman might be waiting for  him  at Cragg's Ridge, down on the rim of civilization, but that  same grim  executioner was also pursuing close at his heels. He  would always be  pursuing in the form of a Breault, a Cassidy, a  Tavish, or a Somebody  Else of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police.  It would be that way until  the end came. And when the end did  come, when they finally got him,  the blow would be easier at  Cragg's Ridge than up here on the edge of  the Barren Land. 
  And again there was hope, a wild, almost unbelievable hope that   with Nada he might find that place which Yellow Bird, the  sorceress,  had promised for them&#8212;that mystery-place of safety and  of happiness  which she had called The Country Beyond, where &quot;all  would end well.&quot;  He had not the faith of Yellow Bird's people; he  was not superstitious  enough to believe fully in her sorcery,  except that he seized upon it  as a drowning man might grip at a  floating sea-weed. Yet was the  under-current of hope so persistent  that at times it was near faith.  Up to this hour Yellow Bird's  sorcery had brought him nothing but the  truth. For him she had  conjured the spirits of her people, and these  spirits, speaking  through Yellow Bird's lips, had saved him from  Cassidy at the  fishing camp and had performed the miracle on the shore  of  Wollaston and had predicted the salvation that had come to him out   on the Barren. And so&#8212;was it not conceivable that the other would   also come true? 
  But these visions came to him only in flashes. As he traveled   through the hours the one vital desire of his being was to bring   himself physically into the presence of Nada, to feel the wild joy  of  her in his arms once more, the crush of her lips to his, the  caress of  her hands in their old sweet way at his face&#8212;and to  hear her voice,  the girl's voice with the woman's soul behind it,  crying out its  undying love, as he had last heard it that night in  the Missioner's  cabin many months ago. After this had happened,  then&#8212;if fate decreed  it so&#8212;all other things might end. Breault,  the Ferret, might come. Or  Porter. Or that Somebody Else who was  always on his trail. If the game  finished thus, he would be  satisfied. 
  When he stopped to make a pot of black tea and warm a snack to eat   Jolly Roger tried to explain this new meaning of life to Peter. 
  &quot;The big thing we must do is to get there&#8212;safely,&quot; he said,   already beginning to make plans in the back of his head. And then  he  went on, building up his fabric of new hope before Peter, while  he  crunched his luncheon of toasted bannock and fat bacon. There  was  something joyous and definite in his voice which entered into  Peter's  blood and body. There was even a note of excitement in it,  and Peter's  whiskers bristled with fresh courage and his eyes  gleamed and his tail  thumped the snow comprehendingly. It was like  having a master come  back to him from the dead. 
  And Jolly Roger even laughed, softly, under his breath. 
  &quot;This is February,&quot; he said. &quot;We ought to make it late in March. I   mean Cragg's Ridge, Pied-Bot.&quot; 
  After that they went on, traveling hard to reach their cabin   before the darkness of night, which would drop upon them like a  thick  blanket at four o'clock. In these last hours there pressed  even more  heavily upon Jolly Roger that growing realization of the  vastness and  emptiness of the world. It was as if blindness had  dropped from his  eyes and he saw the naked truth at last. Out of  this world everything  had emptied itself until it held only Nada.  Only she counted. Only she  held out her arms to him, entreating  him to keep for her that life in  his body which meant so little in  all other ways. He thought of one of  the little worn books which  he carried in his shoulder-pack&#8212;Jeanne  D'Arc. As she had fought,  with the guidance of God, so he believed the  blue-eyed girl down  at Cragg's Ridge was fighting for him, and had  sent her spirit out  in quest of him. And he was going back to her.  GOING! 
  The last word, as it came from his lips, meant that nothing would   stop them. He almost shouted it. And Peter answered. 
  In spite of their effort, darkness closed in on them. With the   first dusk of this night there came sudden lulls in which the   blizzard seemed to have exhausted itself. Jolly Roger read the  signs.  By tomorrow there would be no storm and Breault the Ferret  would be on  the trail again, along with Porter and Tavish. 
  It was his old craft, his old cunning, that urged him to go on.   Strangely, he prayed for the blizzard not to give up the ghost.   Something must be accomplished before its fury was spent; and he  was  glad when after each lull he heard again the moaning and  screeching of  it over the open spaces, and the slashing together  of spruce tops  where there was cover. In a chaos of gloom they  came to the low ridge  which reached across an open sweep of tundra  to the finger of shelter  where the cabin was built. An hour later  they were at its door. Jolly  Roger opened it and staggered in. For  a space he stood leaning against  the wall while his lungs drank in  the warmer air. The intake of his  breath made a whistling sound  and he was surprised to find himself so  near exhaustion. He heard  the thud of Peter's body as it collapsed to  the floor. 
  &quot;Tired, Pied-Bot?&quot; 
  It was difficult for his storm-beaten lips to speak the words. 
  Peter thumped his tail. The rat-tap-tap of it came in one of those   lulls of the storm which Jolly Roger had begun to dread. 
  &quot;I hope it keeps up another two hours,&quot; he said, wetting his lips   to take the stiffness out of them. &quot;If it doesn't&#8212;&quot; 
  He was thinking of Breault as he drew off his mittens and fumbled   for a match. It was Breault he feared. The Ferret would find his   cabin and his trail if the storm died out too soon. 
  He lighted the tin lamp on his table and after that, assured that   wastefulness would cost him nothing now, he set two bear-drip  candles  going, one at each end of the cabin. The illumination  filled the  single room. There was little for it to reveal&#8212;the  table he had made,  a chair, a battered little sheet-iron stove,  and the humped up blanket  in his bunk, under which he had stored  the remainder of his  possessions. Back of the stove was a pile of  dry wood, and in another  five minutes the roar of flames in the  chimney mingled with a fresh  bluster of the wind outside. 
  Defying the exhaustion of limbs and body, Jolly Roger kept   steadily at work. He threw off his heavier garments as the  freezing  atmosphere of the room became warmer, and prepared for a  feast. 
  &quot;We'll call it Christmas, and have everything we've got, Pied-Bot.   We'll cook a quart of prunes instead of six. No use stinting   ourselves&#8212;tonight!&quot; 
  Even Peter was amazed at the prodigality of his master. An hour   later they ate, and McKay drank a quart of hot coffee before he  was  done. Half of his fatigue was gone and he sat back for a few  minutes  to finish off with the luxury of his pipe. Peter, gorged  with caribou  meat, stretched himself out to sleep. But his eyes  did not close. His  master puzzled him. For after a little Jolly  Roger put on his heavy  coat and parkee and pocketed his pipe.  After that he slipped the  straps of his pack over head and  shoulders and then, even more to  Peter's bewilderment, emptied a  quart bottle of kerosene over the pile  of dry wood behind the hot  stove. To this he touched a lighted match.  His next movement drew  from Peter a startled yelp. With a single  thrust of his foot he  sent the stove crashing into the middle of the  floor. 
  Half an hour later, when Peter and Jolly Roger looked back from   the crest of the ridge, a red pillar of flame lighted up the  gloomy  chaos of the unpeopled world they were leaving behind them.  The wind  was driving fiercely from the Barren and with it came  stinging volleys  of the fine drift-snow. In the teeth of it Roger  McKay stared back. 
  &quot;It's a good fire,&quot; he mumbled in his hood. &quot;Half an hour and it   will be out. There'll be nothing for Breault to find if this wind   keeps up another two hours&#8212;nothing but drift-snow, with no sign  of  trail or cabin.&quot; 
  He struck out, leaving the shelter of the ridge. Straight south he   went, keeping always in the open spaces where the wind-swept drift   covered his snowshoe trail almost as soon as it was made. Darkness   did not trouble him now. The open barren was ahead, miles of it,   while only a little to the westward was the shelter of timber.  Twice  he blundered to the edge of this timber, but quickly set his  course  again in the open, with the wind always quartering at his  back. He  could only guess how long he kept on. The time came when  he began to  count the swing of his snowshoes, measuring off half a  mile, or a  mile, and then beginning over again until at last the  achievement of  five hundred steps seemed to take an immeasurable  length of time and  great effort. Like the ache of a tooth came the  first warning of  snowshoe cramp in his legs. In the black night he  grinned. He knew  what it meant&#8212;a warning as deadly as swimmer's  cramp in deep water.  If he continued much longer he would be  crawling on his hands and  knees. 
  Quickly he turned in the direction of the timber. He had traveled   three hours, he thought, since abandoning his cabin to the flames.   Another half hour, with the caution of slower, shorter steps,  brought  him to the timber. Luck was with him and he cried aloud to  Peter as he  felt himself in the darkness of a dense cover of  spruce and balsam. He  freed himself from his entangled snowshoes  and went on deeper into the  shelter. It became warmer and they  could feel no longer a breath of  the wind. 
  He unloaded his pack and drew from it a jackpine torch, dried in   his cabin and heavy with pitch. Shortly the flare of this torch   lighted up their refuge for a dozen paces about them. In the   illumination of it, moving it from place to place, he gathered dry   fire wood and with his axe cut down green spruce for the  smouldering  back-fire that would last until morning. By the time  the torch had  consumed itself the fire was burning, and where  Jolly Roger had  scraped away the snow from the thick carpet of  spruce needles  underfoot he piled a thick mass of balsam boughs,  and in the center of  the bed he buried himself, wrapped warmly in  his blankets, and with  Peter snuggled close at his side. 
  Through dark hours the green spruce fire burned slowly and   steadily. For a long time there was wailing of wind out in the  open.  But at last it died away, and utter stillness filled the  world. No  life moved in these hours which followed the giving up  of the big  storm's last gasping breath. Slowly the sky cleared.  Here and there a  star burned through. But Jolly Roger and Peter,  deep in the sleep of  exhaustion, knew nothing of the change.
