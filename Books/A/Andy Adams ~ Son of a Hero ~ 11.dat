  On board the ships which ply the Inland Seas life is usually a very   humdrum, routine thing. A sailor sleeps, arises, eats, works and   sleeps again&#8212;the same unvarying programme day after day from March   until December, except when in port for the shortest possible time to   load and unload. Then the soul-breaking monotony ceases and there is   feverish activity, every one on duty, or subject to instant call   thereto, the entire twenty-four hours. Many sailors are but workmen   during their whole lives. Ordinarily, romance and adventure are far   removed from the existence of both the officers and their men, and   there is no probable explanation available for the fact that Jim   Falkner found so much of adventure and came so close to romance during   his short career on the lakes before he became a reporter. As a   newspaper man of course he had had a few exceptional opportunities. 
  But now three very ordinary years were to speed by after the young  man  resigned his reportorial position and undertook again&#8212;albeit   unwittingly&#8212;to follow in the footsteps of his heroic father, late   master of the Bannockburn. Jim Falkner was of the lake breed, and life   elsewhere than on the bosom of America's fresh-water oceans just   couldn't exist for him. 
  During the last of those three uneventful years he was in the   Waverley&#8212;a ten-thousand-ton ore carrier&#8212;as second mate under Captain   Ben Leonhard. Even such apparently promising youngsters as Jim Falkner   had to make haste slowly, for it is both the written and unwritten law   of the lakes that there is no worth-while substitute for actual   experience on shipboard. 
  About the master of the Waverly there hung an aura of romance,   mystery, and adventure which greatly attracted young Jim Falkner. It   was the tale of Captain Leonhard's first command that first drew   Falkner to him. All over the lakes&#8212;wherever officers or men chanced   to assemble&#8212;the old story of the Christopher Duggan was known. At the   club in Duluth, old Captain Matthew Haynes had told it to Jim Falkner. 
  &quot;'Father is dead!'&quot; 
  &quot;Above the cracking and snapping of the icebound timber outside,  and  the thunder of the sea as it packed the little ice-devils closer  about  the sinking vessel, rose the voice of the girl&#8212;firm, almost   triumphant, in the ears of the haggard, white-faced men who stood   gripping their axes and ice-hooks under the glow of the swinging cabin   light. Their watery eyes caught the indistinct white of the sheet   under which the captain lay. Beside it stood Duggan's girl. Her fallen   hair glistened in frozen strands. Her face was death-like, with a red   spot on each cheek where the ice had bitten it. But her eyes were big,   beautiful and fearless, as she scanned the faces of the men. 
  &quot;Instinctively old Ramsay put a half-frozen hand to his grey head  and  pulled off his stiffened cap. Even in this last moment he  cherished  the old custom of the lakes. 
  &quot;'I'm glad, Jean, girl,' he said. 'It's easier for a dead man to go   down than for a live un!' 
  &quot;Outside there was a terrific crash, as another dozen tons of ice-   bound cedar loosened its hold of the Christopher Duggan. One by one   the members of the crew bared their heads with Ramsay, until only the   youngest of them, the boy from Ontanagon, who had never shipped before   in his life, stood there with his head covered, staring straight into   the eyes of the girl. Big tears rolled down his cheeks, his purple   lips seemed to form a word; then he dropped his head with the others. 
  &quot;'Father's gone!' cried Duggan's girl, her voice half drowned in  the  thundering rush of water and ice outside. 'But he didn't know he  was  going down, an' he said for me to take the ship,&#8212;me 'n' Ramsay.   There's nothing to keep us from the boats now, if the cedars don't   hold.' 
  &quot;'If they do hold, Jean, all the devils from 'ere to the Soo can't   pull us down! But they won't, girl&#8212;'ear that?' shouted Ramsay. 
  &quot;A rumbling shudder passed through the Christopher Duggan, and a  roar  as of distant thunder came to the ears of the men as another  avalanche  of cedar posts pitched over her side. 
  &quot;'Keep them as long as you can, and me 'n' Ben'll fix the boats!'   commanded the girl. 
  &quot;The men who were daring one last trip across Superior at double  pay  gripped their axes. As they hurled themselves out into the  blackness  of the bitter storm, with grey-headed Ramsay leading them,  the boy  from Ontanagon caught one of Jean's slim hands for a moment  between  both his own big bony ones. &quot;'You dassen't do it&#8212;I mean you  mustn't,  Jean!' he said. 'You stay here. I'll fix the boats, an'  then&#8212;then  I'll come back for you!' 
  &quot;'Ben, you do as I tell you!' retorted the girl, high above the  tumult  of the crunching ice and tumbling cedar. 'I'm cap'n now, an'  you're  too much afraid to do it alone. I ain't forgot you was a coward   yesterday!' 
  &quot;'I warn't a coward, Jean&#8212;' 
  &quot;The boy's expostulation died away in a sudden furious gust that  sent  the cabin door crashing inward. The girl steadied herself against  the  gale, her long hair whipping back for an instant into the young  man's  face. Then she forged ahead into the darkness, out of which came  the  stentorian voice of Ramsay, who saw her figure swaying onward  between  him and the light in the cabin. 
  &quot;'One of the boats is gone, Jean&#8212;other's clear!' he shouted. 
  &quot;'Then keep to the ice!' returned the girl. 
  &quot;The barge rode smoothly now. She seemed to cut the waves like ah  iron  wedge, and the way she hung in the seas, a dead weight without a   tremor, put a thrill of hope into the heart of the green boy from the   northern Michigan port. But Duggan's girl knew what that steadiness   meant. 
  &quot;Ordinarily a dying man is quiet in his last moments. A schooner   always is when the little ice-devils have almost got it down. For   sixteen hours they had been freezing to the sides of the Christopher   Duggan. They hung in solid tons from her deckhouses and rudder. They   had crept up her sides until they smothered her outlines of wood, and   when now and then a part of the cedar cargo pitched over into the sea,   it was like a mass of broken ice that went. Everywhere the ice-devils   had got their hold, and the Christopher Duggan continued to settle   inch by inch. Above the regular swish of the waves came the sounds of   hacking axes, like the beats of a death-watch at one's bed-head. 
  &quot;The girl joined the men. One of them slipped and fell at her feet,   but it was too late to turn Samaritan now. The frozen sailor struggled   to his feet again and gripped his axe, but his blows were weak and   ineffectual. In the glimmer of the lanterns tied to the deck Jean saw   Ramsay fall helplessly down from the cedars, a coil of rope tangled   about his arm. His grey head was bare, his beard and hair frozen   stiff, and his face filled with an awful agony. His fingers refused to   respond as he tried to grip the girl's arm. 
  &quot;'I can't tie 'em any more!' he cried. 'We ain't goin' to hold the   cedars much longer!' 
  &quot;'How long?' The girl had dropped her axe. Her voice was almost   metallic in its firmness. 
  &quot;'Ten minutes; mebby less,' said Ramsay. 
  &quot;'Then hustle the men into the cabin, and thaw 'em out. We've  drifted  close into the Michigan shore, an' we'll make it in the boat!' 
  &quot;Duggan's girl came in last. Never had the lad from Ontanagon seen  her  eyes so big and dark; never had he seen her face so white. Somehow  he  did not feel afraid at all when near Jean. If the boat went  down&#8212;and  he knew that it would go soon&#8212;he had determined to do a  desperate  thing. Duggan's girl should go down in his arms. It would be  better  lying down there in one of the deep pits of Superior's bottom  if Jean  were near him. 
  &quot;He found himself wondering in that moment if all the women of the   lakes were as splendid as she; and then his dream was interrupted by   that same cold, passionless voice telling Ramsay that it was time to   go to the boat. At that moment it was a disappointment. He would   rather have met his end there, with Jean, than out in the cold and   alone. Looking straight at Duggan's girl, he said: 'I'd rather stay   here, Jean!' 
  &quot;'Are you afraid to go, or is it because you ain't afraid to stay?'   There was something in Jean's voice that sounded queer. Just a flash   of softness came into her eyes, and quickly disappeared again. Then   she pushed old Ramsay through the door, and followed. Two of the   sailors had axes, and the girl brought another. 
  &quot;Under the broad stern of the barge the waves beat mercilessly  against  the ice-hung rudder. Now and then there was a lull; and in one  of  these the boat swung down, and two sailors were in it before  another  of the heavier waves came to beat its ribs against the ice.  Then  Ramsay seized Jean's arm, this time firmly. 
  &quot;'You next, Jean, girl!' 
  &quot;'Not now, Ramsay!' she cried, jerking her arm free. 'Have you   forgotten that father's in there? Ain't it my right to be the last to   leave the boat?' 
  &quot;'You'd better go, Jean,' urged the boy, close up to her ear. 'I'll  be  the last.' 
  &quot;'You won't!' almost shrieked the girl. 'Ben, git into that  boat,&#8212;and  you, too, Ramsay. Ain't this my boat now, and ain't it my  right to  leave father last?' Without a word old Ramsay clambered over  the side,  and the boy followed. 
  &quot;'You ready?' called down the girl. 
  &quot;'Only a second, Jean. There&#8212;now&#8212;' 
  &quot;In the light of the lanterns Jean's axe flashed above her head.  Once,  twice, it rose and fell, and the crew of the Christopher Duggan   disappeared in the blackness of the sea. 
  &quot;'Jean! Jean!' came a despairing cry. 
  &quot;'I'm goin' to stay with father!' shouted the girl through the  trumpet  of her hands. 'Good-bye!' 
  &quot;The crash of another mass of cedar as it slipped off the barge   drowned the voices from the small boat. Fearing that the end was very   near, Duggan's girl hurried back and sat down beside the white-sheeted   cot in the cabin. Her eyes were softer now, and with her chin in her   hands she listened unfearingly for that last gurgling swish of waters   which would tell her that the nose of the Christopher Duggan was going   under. 
  &quot;The water dripped from her long beautiful hair, and once or twice  a  phantom smile seemed to soften her lips as she thought of the clumsy   deck-hand from Ontanagon. The seconds passed&#8212;they seemed like minutes   to the waiting girl&#8212;and only the recurring sounds of slipping cedar   posts came where there should have been that last triumphant gurgle of   the little ice-devils. Then there came another sound&#8212;a great human   cry of 'Jean, Jean!' as the door burst open and in it stood the boy,   dripping with ice and water, his face white as death itself would ever   make it. 
  &quot;'Jean, Jean!' he cried again. 'I've come back!' 
  &quot;With a wild cry the girl sprang to her feet and held out her arms   blindly. 'Ben, you went out in the boat&#8212;' 
  &quot;'An' I jumped back, Jean!' 
  &quot;Through the open door there came an awful sound. It was a  soothing,  rustling sound, like that made by the swish of crunched ice  against  the sides of a copper vessel, only long-continued. The girl  stood as  if transfixed, and unconsciously she lifted her eyes upward. 
  &quot;'Jean, is it coming?' asked the boy in a low, thrilling voice. The   girl nodded. 'Then listen Jean! I came back to die with you; for I'd   rather die with you here than live out there! But I want you to go   down in my arms, Jean&#8212;will you?' 
  &quot;A soft light came again into Jean's beautiful eyes as she put her   arms around the boy's shoulders. 'I couldn't die in braver ones, Ben,'   she said. 
  &quot;The boy from Ontanagon held her closely. He could feel her heart   beating against his own, and a little fearfully he brought his rough   cheek down until it pressed against the girl's. Somehow he forgot to   listen to the ominous sound outside, and he kissed her very gently. 
  &quot;One, two, three minutes passed, and the girl lifted her head.  There  was a pink glow in either cheek now, as she gently pushed the  boy  back. 'Ben, I guess I was wrong. The time ain't come yet!' 
  &quot;As if to argue for the young lover, there came a tremendous shock   that seemed to rend the barge from end to end. For a minute the   Christopher Duggan tossed in the seas as if a charge of dynamite had   lifted her out of the water. Her stern shot up with a suddenness that   pitched Jean and her companion violently against the wall of the   cabin. Then the vessel settled again, and rolled violently, as if   caught in another and fiercer gale. 
  &quot;'Ben, Ben!' shrieked the girl. 'The ice has broke!' 
  &quot;The landsman caught the meaning of the words. In a flash he was  out  at the door and on the deck. The wind blew fiercely over his head.  He  could hear the cedars slipping, but it was only a thick spray of  the  wave-crests that dashed into his face now. He found difficulty in   keeping his feet, and out of his throat came a yell of joy. With the   cabin lantern in her hand, Jean stumbled out to him, and together they   held it over the ice-smothered rail of the barge. The CHRISTOPHER   DUGGAN was up four feet out of the water. 
  &quot;No word came from the lips of the girl. She seemed limp and  helpless  now, and caught hold of her companion for support. In turn  the lad  from Ontanagon put an arm about her, and half carried her back  into  the cabin. Then he took the arm away, and Duggan's girl fell upon  her  knees beside the dead man. 
  &quot;After that Ben went out and chopped and chopped. Then he tied the   cedars down and hung lights as high up the slippery masts as he could   climb. When he came back a sickly grey was climbing up into the sky,   and by straining his eyes he could make out the white crests of the   waves a few fathoms out. The girl still knelt beside the cot&#8212;asleep,   the boy thought&#8212;so he went out again, and watched the coining of the   day from the sheltered side of the cedars. His vision grew wider and   wider, until half a mile away, deep down, and pounding steadily toward   the Soo, he caught the outlines of a huge steel freighter. 
  &quot;When Jean awoke, the landsman was seated near her, calmly smoking  a  pipe. There was a good fire in the stove, and the room was warm and   exceedingly comfortable. Moreover, the Christopher Duggan seemed to be   riding squarely in the sea. As the girl jumped to her feet, and   brushed the thick hair back from her face, the boy dropped his pipe to   the floor and caught her gently by the arm. 
  &quot;'Come here, Jean!' He led her to the door, and opened it. A  hundred  fathoms ahead the steel freighter was hurrying on her last  trip to the  Soo. 'We're in tow,' he explained. 
  &quot;The wind caught Jean's hair and whipped it about his face. The boy   from Ontanagon half put his hands up to it, hesitated, then caught   Duggan's girl in his arms.&quot;
