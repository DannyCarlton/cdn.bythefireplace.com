  For a few moments Jan stood with his back to M&eacute;lisse and his eyes  upon  the carnival about the great fire. As he looked, the third  caribou was  pulled down from its spit, and the multitude of dogs  rushed in upon  the abandoned carcasses of the other two. 
  He caught his breath quickly as a loud shout and the wailing yelp  of a  hurt dog rose for an instant above all other sounds. Only one  thing  was wanting to complete another picture in his brain&#8212;a scene  which  had burned itself into his life for ever, and which he strove to  fight  back as he stood staring from the doorway. He half expected it  to  come&#8212;the shrill scream of a boyish voice, an instant's sullen  quiet,  then the low-throated thunder of impending vengeance&#8212;and the  fight! 
  With marvelous quickness his excited mind reconstructed the scene   before him into the scene that had been. He heard the scream again,   which had been HIS voice; saw, as if in a dream, the frenzied rush of   men and the flash of knives; and then, from where he lay trampled and   bleeding in the snow, the long, lean team of swift huskies that had   carried in mad flight the one whose life those knives sought. 
  Williams had been there; he had seen the fight&#8212;his knife had  flashed  with the others in its demand for life. And yet he&#8212;Jan  Thoreau&#8212;had  not been recognized by the factor out there beside the  caribou roast! 
  He hurried toward the fire. Half-way across the open he stopped.  From  out of the forest opposite Cummins' cabin there trailed slowly a  team  of dogs. In the shadows of the spruce, hidden from the revelers,  the  team halted. Jan heard the low voices of men, and a figure  detached  itself from the gloom, walking slowly and in the manner of  one near to  exhaustion in the direction of the carnival. 
  It was a new team. It had come from the trails to the east, and  Jan's  heart gave a sudden jump as he thought of the missionary who was   expected with the overdue mail. At first he had a mind to intercept   the figure laboring across the open, but without apparent reason he   changed his course and approached the sledge. 
  As he came nearer, he observed a second figure, which rose from  behind  the dogs and advanced to meet him. A dozen paces ahead of the  team it  stopped and waited. 
  &quot;Our dogs are so near exhaustion that we're afraid to take them any   nearer,&quot; said a voice. &quot;They'd die like puppies under those packs!&quot; 
  The voice thrilled Jan. He advanced with his back to the fire, so  that  he could see the stranger. 
  &quot;You come from Churchill?&quot; he asked. 
  His words were hardly a question. They were more of an excuse for  him  to draw nearer, and he turned a little, so that for an instant the   glowing fire flashed in his eyes. 
  &quot;Yes, we started from the Etawney just a week ago to-day.&quot; 
  Jan had come very near. The stranger interrupted himself to stare  into  the thin, fierce face that had grown like a white cameo almost  within  reach of him. With a startled cry, he drew a step back, and  Jan's  violin dropped to the snow. 
  For no longer than a breath there was silence. The man wormed  himself  back into the shadows inch by inch, followed by the white face  of the  boy. Then there came shrilly from Jan's lips the mad shrieking  of a  name, and his knife flashed as he leaped at the other's breast. 
  The stranger was quicker than he. With a sudden movement he cleared   himself of the blow; and as Jan's arm went past him, the point of the   knife ripping his coat-sleeve, he shot out a powerful fist and sent   the boy reeling to the ground. 
  Stunned and bleeding, Jan dragged himself to his knees. He saw the   dogs turning, heard a low voice urging them to the trail, and saw the   sledge disappear into the forest. He staggered from his knees to his   feet, and stood swaying in his weakness. Then he followed. 
  He forgot that he was leaving his knife in the snow, forgot that  back  there about the fire there were other dogs and other men. He only  knew  that once before he had seen a sledge slip off into the  wilderness;  that its going had left him a life of hatred and  bitterness and desire  for vengeance; and that this was the same man  who was slipping away  from him in the same way again. 
  He followed, sickened by the blow, but gaining strength as he  pursued.  Ahead of him he could hear the sound of the toboggan and the  cautious  lashing of a whip over the backs of the tired huskies. The  sounds  filled him with fierce strength. He wiped away the warm trickle  of  blood that ran over his cheek, and began to run, slowly at first,   swinging in the easy wolf-lope of the forest runner, with his elbows   close to his sides. 
  At that pace he could have followed for hours, losing when the pack   took a spurt, gaining when they lagged, an insistent Nemesis just   behind when the weighted dogs lay down in their traces. But there was   neither the coolness of Mukee nor the cleverness of Jean de Gravois in   the manner of Jan's running. When he heard the cracking of the whip   growing fainter, he dropped his arms straight to his sides and ran   more swiftly, his brain reeling with the madness of his desire to   reach the sledge&#8212;to drag from it the man who had struck him, to choke   life from the face that haunted that mental picture of his, grinning   at him and gloating always from the shadow world, just beyond the   pale, sweet loveliness of the woman who lived in it. 
  That picture came to him now as he ran, more and more vividly, and   from out of it the woman urged him on to the vengeance which she   demanded of him, her great eyes glowing like fire, her beautiful face   torn with the agony which he had last seen in it in life. 
  To Jan Thoreau there seemed almost to come from that face a living   voice, crying to him its prayer for retribution, pleading with him to   fasten his lithe, brown hands about the throat of the monster upon the   sledge ahead, and choke from it all life. It drove reason from him,   leaving him with the one thought that the monster was almost within   reach; and he replied to the prayer with the breath that came in   moaning exhaustion from between his lips. 
  He did not feel the soft, sun-packed snow under the beat of his  feet.  He received the lash of low-hanging bushes without experiencing  the  sensation of their sting. Only he knew that he wanted air&#8212;more  and  more air; and to get it he ran with open mouth, struggling and  gasping  for it, and yet not knowing that Jean de Gravois would have  called him  a fool for the manner in which he sought it. 
  He heard more and more faintly the run of the sledge. Then he heard  it  no longer, and even the cracking of the whip died away. His heart   swelled in a final bursting effort, and he plunged on, until at last   his legs crumpled under him and he pitched face downward in the snow,   like a thing stung by sudden death. 
  It was then, with his scratched and bleeding face lying in the  snow,  that reason began to return to him. After a little while he  dragged  himself weakly to his knees, still panting from the mad effort  he had  made to overtake the sledge. From a great distance he heard  faintly  the noise of shouting, the whispering echo of half a hundred  voices,  and he knew that the sound came from the revelers at the post.  It was  proof to him that there had been no interruption to the  carnival, and  that the scene at the edge of the forest had been  witnessed by none.  Quickly his mental faculties readjusted themselves.  He rose to his  feet, and for a few moments stood hesitatingly. He had  no weapon; but  as his hand rested upon the empty knife-sheath at his  belt, there came  to him a thought of the way in which Mukee had  avenged Cummins' wife,  and he turned again upon the trail. He no  longer touched the low-  hanging bushes. He was no more than a shadow,  appearing and  disappearing without warning, trailing as the white  ermine follows its  prey, noiseless, alert, his body responding  sinuously and without  apparent effort to the working commands of his  brain. 
  Where the forest broke into an open, lighted by the stars, he found   blood in the footprints of the leading dog. Half-way across the open,   he saw where the leader had swung out from the trail and the others of   the pack had crowded about him, to be urged on by the lashings of the   man's whip. Other signs of the pack's growing exhaustion followed   close. 
  The man now traveled beside the sledge where the trail was rough,  and  rode where it was smooth and hard. The deep imprints of his heeled   boots in the soft snow showed that he ran for only a short distance at   a time&#8212;a hundred yards or less&#8212;and that after each running spell he   brought the pack to a walk. He was heavy and lacked endurance, and   this discovery brought a low cry of exultation to Jan's lips. 
  He fell into a dog-trot. Mile after mile dropped behind him; other   miles were ahead of him, an endless wilderness of miles, and through   them the tired pack persisted, keeping always beyond sound and vision. 
  The stars began fading out of the skies. The shadows of the forest   grew deeper and blacker, and where the aurora had lightened the   heavens there crept the somber gray film that preceded dawn by three   hours. 
  Jan followed more and more slowly. There was hard-breathing effort  now  in his running&#8212;effort that caused him physical pain and  discomfort.  His feet stumbled occasionally in the snow; his legs, from  thigh to  knee, began to ache with the gnawing torment that centers in  the  marrowbone; and with this beginning of the &quot;runner's cramp&quot; he was   filled with a new and poignant terror. 
  Would the dogs beat him out? Sloughing in the trail, bleeding at  every  foot, would they still drag their burden beyond the reach of his   vengeance? The fear fastened itself upon him, urging him to greater   effort, and he called upon the last of his strength in a spurt that   carried him to where the thick spruce gave place to thin bush, and the   bush to the barren and rocky side of a huge ridge, up which the trail   climbed strong and well defined. For a few paces he followed it, then   slipped and rolled back as the fatal paralysis deadened all power of   movement in his limbs. He lay where he fell, moaning out his grief   with his wide-staring eyes turned straight up into the cold gray of   the starless sky. 
  For a long time he was motionless. From the top of the ridge, where   the trail cut over the mountain, he looked like a bit of fire-   blackened wood half buried in the snow. Half-way up the ridge a wolf,   slinking hungrily, sniffed first up the trail and then down, and broke   the stillness of the gray night-end with a mournful howl. It did not   stir Jan Thoreau. 
  Long after the wolf had passed on, he moved a little, twisting  himself  so that his eyes could follow the tracks made by the sledge  and dogs.  When he came to where the snow-covered backbone of the ridge  cut  itself in faint outline against the desolate coldness of the sky,   there fell from him the first sound of returning life. Up there he was   sure that he had seen something move&#8212;an object which at first he had   taken for a bush, and which he knew was not the wolf. 
  He watched for its reappearance, until all sorts of gray dawn  shadows  danced before his eyes. Then he began slowly to crawl up the  trail.  Some of the dull, paralytic ache was gone from his limbs, and  as he  worked his blood began to warm them into new strength, until he  stood  up and sniffed like an animal in the wind that was coming over  the  ridge from the south. 
  There was something in that wind that thrilled him. It stung his   nostrils to a quick sensing of the nearness of something that was   human. He smelled smoke. In it there was the pungent odor of green   balsam, mixed with a faint perfume of pitch pine; and because the odor   of pitch grew stronger as he ascended, he knew that it was a small   fire that was making the smoke, with none of the fierce, dry woods to   burn up the smell. It was a fire hidden among the rocks, a tiny fire,   over which the fleeing missioner was cooking his breakfast. 
  Jan almost moaned aloud in his gladness, and the old mad strength   returned to his body. Near the summit of the ridge he picked up a   club. It was a short, thick club, with the heavy end knotted and   twisted. 
  Cautiously he lifted his face over the rocks, and looked out upon a   plateau, still deep in snow, swept bare by the winter's winds, and   covered with rocks and bushes. His face was so white that at a little   distance it might have been taken for a snow hare. It went whiter   when, a few yards away, he saw the fire, the man, and the dogs. 
  The man was close to the little blaze, his broad shoulders hunched   over, steadying a small pot over the flame. Beyond him were the dogs   huddled about the sledge, inanimate as death. 
  Jan drew himself over the rocks. Once he had seen a big-footed lynx   creep upon a wide-awake fox, and like that lynx he crept upon the man   beside the fire. One of the tired dogs moved, and his pointed nostrils   quivered in the air. Jan lay flat in the snow. Then the dog's muzzle   dropped between his paws, and the boy moved on. 
  Inch by inch he advanced. The inches multiplied themselves into a   foot, the foot lengthened into yards, and still the man remained   hunched over his simmering pot. 
  Jan rose gently from his hands and knees to his feet, a furnace of   madness blazing in his eyes. The restless dog raised his head again.   He sniffed danger&#8212;near, menacing danger&#8212;and sprang up with a   snarling cry that brought the man over the fire to quick attention. In   a flash Jan took the last leap, and his club crashed down upon the   missioner's head. The man pitched over like a log, and with a shrill   cry the boy was at his throat. 
  &quot;I am Jan Thoreau!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;I am Jan Thoreau&#8212;Jan  Thoreau&#8212;come  to keel you!&quot; He dropped his club, and was upon the  man's chest, his  slender fingers tightening like steel wire about the  thick throat of  his enemy. &quot;I keel you slow&#8212;slow!&quot; he cried, as the  missioner  struggled weakly. 
  The great thick body heaved under him, and he put all his strength   into his hands. Something struck him in the face. Something struck him   again and again, but he felt neither the pain nor the force of it, and   his voice sobbed out his triumph as he choked. The man's hands reached   up and tore at his hair; but Jan saw only the missioner's mottled face   growing more mottled, and his eyes staring in greater agony up into   his own. 
  &quot;I am Jan Thoreau,&quot; he panted again and again. &quot;I am Jan Thoreau,  an'  I keel you&#8212;keel you!&quot; 
  The blood poured from his face. It blinded him until he could no   longer see the one from which he was choking life. He bent down his   head to escape the blows. The man's body heaved more and more; it   turned until he was half under it; but still he hung to the thick   throat, as the weasel hangs in tenacious death to the jugular of its   prey. 
  The missioner's weight was upon him in crushing force now. His huge   hands struck and tore at the boy's head and face, and then they had   fastened themselves at his neck. Jan was conscious of a terrible   effort to take in breath, but he was not conscious of pain. The clutch   did not frighten him. It did not make him loosen his grip. His fingers   dug deeper. He strove to cry out still his words of triumph; but he   could make no sound, except a gasping like that which came from   between the gaping jaws of the man whose life his body and soul were   fighting to smother. 
  There was death in each of the two grips; but the man's was the   stronger, and his neck was larger and tougher, so that after a time he   staggered to his knees and then to his feet, while Jan lay upon his   back, his face and hair red with blood, his eyes wide open and with a   lifeless glare in them. The missioner looked down upon his victim in   horror. As the life that had nearly ebbed out of him poured back into   his body, he staggered among the dogs, fastened them to the sledge,   and urged them down the mountain into the plain. There was soon no   sound of the sledge. 
  From a bush a dozen yards away a wondering moose-bird had watched  the  terrible struggle. Now he hopped boldly upon Jan's motionless  body,  and perked his head inquisitively as he examined the strange  face,  covered with blood and twisted in torture. 
  The gray film of dawn dissolved itself into the white beginning of   day. Far to the south, a bit of the red sunrise was creeping into the   northern world.
