  Jan had not played upon his violin since the coming of Jean de   Gravois; but one evening he tuned his strings, and said to M&eacute;lisse: 
  &quot;They have been good to you, my M&eacute;lisse. I will give them ze museek  of  ze violon.&quot; 
  It was the big night at the post&#8212;the night that is known from   Athabasca to Hudson's Bay as the night of the caribou roast. A week   had passed, and there were no more furs to be disposed of. In the   company's ledger each man had received his credit, and in the   company's store the furs were piled high and safe. Three caribou had   been killed by Per-ee and his hunters; and on this night, when Jan   took down his violin from its peg on the wall, a huge fire blazed in   the open, and on spits six inches in diameter the caribou were   roasting. 
  The air was filled with the sound and odor of the carnival. Above  the  fighting and snarling of dogs, the forest people lifted their  voices  in wild celebration, forgetting, in this one holiday of the  year, the  silence that they would carry back into the solitudes with  them.  Numbers gave them courage of voice, and in its manifestation  there was  the savagery of the forests that hemmed them in. Shrill  voices rose in  meaningless cries above the roaring of the fire.  Caribou whips snapped  fiercely. Chippewayans, Crees, Eskimos, and  breeds crowded in the red  glare. The factor's men shouted and sang  like mad, for this was the  company's annual &quot;good time&quot;&#8212;the show that  would lure many of these  same men back again at the end of another  trapping season. 
  Huge boxes of white bread were placed near to the fire. A tub of  real  butter, brought five thousand miles from across the sea for the   occasion, was set on a gun-case thrown where the heat played upon it   in yellow glory. In a giant copper kettle, over a smaller fire,   bubbled and steamed half a barrel of coffee. 
  The richness of the odors that drifted in the air set the dogs   gathering upon their haunches beyond the waiting circle of masters,   their lips dripping, their fangs snapping in an eagerness that was not   for the flesh of battle. And above it all there gleamed down a billion   stars from out of the skies, the aurora flung its banners through the   pale night, and softly the smoke rose straight up and then floated   into the North, carried there by the gentle breath that spring was   luring from out of the South. 
  Jan picked his way through the cordon of dogs and the inner circle  of  men until he stood with the firelight flashing in his glossy hair  and  black eyes, and there, seated upon the edge of one of the  bread-boxes,  he began to play. 
  It was not the low, sweet music of Cummins and the little M&eacute;lisse  that  he played now, but a wild, wailing song that he had found in the   autumn winds. It burst above the crackling fire and the tumult of man   and dog in a weird and savage beauty that hushed all sound; and life   about him became like life struck suddenly dead. With his head bowed   Jan saw nothing&#8212;saw nothing of the wonder in the faces of the half-   cringing little black men who were squatted in a group a dozen feet   away, nothing of the staring amazement in the eyes that were looking   upon this miracle he was performing. He knew only that about him there   was a deep hush, and after a while his violin sang a lower song, and   sweeter; and still softer it became, and more sweet, until he was   playing that which he loved most of all&#8212;the music that had filled the   little cabin when Cummins' wife died. 
  As he continued to play there came an interruption to the  silence&#8212;a  low refrain that was almost like that of the moaning wind.  It grew  beyond the tense circle of men, until a song of infinite  sadness rose  from the throats of a hundred dogs in response to Jan  Thoreau's  violin. To Jan, it was like the song of life. The unending  loneliness  and grief of it stirred him to the quick of his soul, and   unconsciously his voice rose and fell softly with the wailing of the   brute chorus. But to the others it was a thing that rose portentous   above their understanding, a miracle of mystery that smote them with   awe even as they surrendered themselves to the wonderful sweetness of   the music. 
  Cummins saw the change in his people, and understood what it meant.  He  saw the surrounding cordon become thinner as man crushed closer to   man, and he saw strained faces turned from the player to where the   dogs sat full-throated upon their haunches, with their heads pointed   straight to the stars in the sky. 
  Suddenly he burst into a volume of wild song, and made his way  through  the crouching Eskimos to Jan. 
  &quot;For the love of Heaven, play no more of that!&quot; he cried in the  boy's  ear. &quot;Play something fast!&quot; 
  Jan lifted his head as if from a dream. In an instant he perceived  the  strange effect of his music, and his bow raced across the strings  of  his violin in a rhythm swift and buoyant, his voice rising shrill  and  clear in words familiar to them all: 
  &quot;Oh, ze cariboo-oo-oo, ze cariboo-oo-oo, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roas' on high, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jes' under ze sky, <BR> &nbsp;Ze beeg white cariboo-oo-oo!&quot; 
  With a yell Cummins joined in, waving his arms and leaping in the   firelight. The spell was broken. Williams and Mukee and the rest of   the company's men burst forth in song; Jan's violin leaped in   crescendos of stirring sound; and where before there had been a silent   circle of awestruck men there was now a yelling din of voices. 
  The dogs lowered their heads again, and licked their chops at the   odors in the air. With a yell Mukee and three Crees dashed toward the   fire, long-hooked poles in their hands; and as the caribou carcasses   were turned upon their huge spits, and their dripping fat fell   sizzling into the flames, the wild chorus of men and dogs and Jan's   violin rose higher, until Cummins' great voice became only a whisper   in the tumult. 
  The third caribou had been twice turned upon its spit, and Mukee  and  his Crees paused in waiting silence, their hooked poles gripping  the  long bar that rested horizontally across the arms of two stout  posts  driven into the earth close to the fire. At this signal there  was a  final outburst from the waiting horde, and then a momentary  silence  fell as Cummins sprang upon one of the bread-boxes and waved  his arms  frantically above his head. &quot;Now!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Now! 'Ze  cariboo-oo-  oo&#8212;'&quot; 
  With eyes flashing with excitement, Jan stood before Cummins, and  his  violin shrieked out the wild tune to a still wilder response of   untamed voices. 
  &quot;Now!&quot; yelled Cummins again. 
  The wilderness song, that was known from Athabasca to Hudson's Bay,   burst forth in a savage enthusiasm that reached to the skies: 
  &quot;Oh, ze cariboo-oo-oo, ze cariboo-oo-oo, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roas' on high, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jes' under ze sky, <BR> &nbsp;Ze beeg white cariboo-oo-oo!&quot; 
  Cummins drew his revolver and blazed fiercely into the air. 
  &quot;Now!&quot; he shrieked. 
  &quot;Oh, ze cariboo-oo-oo, ze cariboo-oo-oo, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brown 'n' juice 'n' sweet! <BR> &nbsp;Ze cariboo-oo-oo, he ver' polite&#8212; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roas' on high, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jes' under ze sky, <BR> &nbsp;He ready now to come 'n' eat!&quot; 
  With yells that rose above the last words of the song, Mukee and  his  Crees tugged at their poles, and the roasted caribou fell upon the   snow. Jan drew back, and with his violin hugged under one arm, watched   the wild revelers as, with bared knives flashing in the firelight,   they crowded to the feast. Williams, the factor, who was puffing from   his vocal exertions, joined him. 
  &quot;Looks like a fight, doesn't it, Jan? Once I saw a fight at a  caribou  roast.&quot; 
  &quot;So did I,&quot; said Jan, who had not taken his eyes from the jostling   crowd. 
  &quot;It was far to the west and north,&quot; continued Williams; &quot;beyond the   Great Slave country.&quot; 
  &quot;Far beyond,&quot; said Jan, lifting his eyes quietly. &quot;It was ver' near  to  ze Great Bear.&quot; 
  The factor stared at him in amazement. 
  &quot;You saw it?&quot; he exclaimed. 
  But Jan turned away, as if he had heard nothing, and passed beyond  the  packs of waiting dogs to restore his precious violin to its peg on  the  cabin wall. The factor's words had stirred deep memories within  him,  and for the first time since he had come to the post he spoke no  word  to M&eacute;lisse when he found her wakeful and friendly in her cot. 
  Neither was it the old Jan Thoreau who returned to the excitement   about the great fire. With his long hunting-knife flashing above his   head, he plunged into the throng around the caribou, crowding and   jostling with the others, his voice rising in shrill cries as he   forced himself through to the edge of the fire. Cummins was there,   kneeling with turned-up sleeves and greasy hands beside the huge   roast, and when he saw Jan he stared at him in wonder. There was   neither laughter nor song in Jan Thoreau's voice. It was vibrant with   a strange savageness which was more savage than the wildest yells of   the half-breed Crees, and his great eyes burned fiercely as they   rested for an instant upon Cummins' face. 
  Close behind Cummins stood Williams. Jan saw him, and his knife   dropped to his side. Then, so quickly that the startled factor drew   back a step, Jan sprang to him. 
  &quot;Ze fight at ze Great Bear!&quot; he cried in swift eagerness. &quot;For who  you  fight at ze Great Bear?&quot; 
  The factor was silent, and the muscles of his arms grew like steel  as  he saw the madness in Jan's face. Suddenly he reached out and  gripped  the boy's wrists. Jan made no effort to evade the clutch. 
  &quot;For who you fight?&quot; he cried again. &quot;For who you fight at ze Great   Bear?&quot; 
  &quot;We tried to kill a man, but he got away,&quot; said Williams, speaking  so  low that only Jan heard. &quot;He was&#8212;&quot; The factor stopped. 
  &quot;Ze missioner!&quot; panted Jan. 
  The wild light went out of his eyes as he stared up at Williams,  and  the softer glow which came into them loosened at once the factor's   grip on the boy's wrists. 
  &quot;Yes, the missioner!&quot; 
  Jan drew back. He evaded meeting the eyes of Cummins as he made his   way among the men. There was a new burst of song as Mukee and his   Crees pulled down a second caribou, but the boy paid no attention to   the fresh excitement. He thrust his knife into its sheath and ran&#8212;ran   swiftly through the packs of dogs fighting and snarling over the   scraps that had beep thrown to them; past Maballa who was watching the   savage banquet around the big fire, and into the little cabin, to   M&eacute;lisse. 
  Here he flung himself upon his knees, and for the first time he  caught  the baby in his arms, holding her close to him, and rocking her  to and  fro, as he cried out sobbingly the words which she did not  understand. 
  &quot;An' when I fin' heem an' kill heem, I will come back to you, my  angel  M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he whispered. &quot;And then you will luf Jan Thoreau for  letting  out the blood of a missioner!&quot; 
  He put her back into the little bed, kissed her again, took down  his  violin from its peg in the wall, and turned to the door.
