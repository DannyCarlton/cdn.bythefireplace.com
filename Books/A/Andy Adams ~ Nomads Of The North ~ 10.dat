  A quarter of a mile away Miki had heard the clamour of the crows.   But he was in no humour to turn back, even had he guessed that  Neewa  was in need of his help. He was hungry from long fasting  and, for the  present, his disposition had taken a decided turn. He  was in a mood to  tackle anything in the eating line, no matter how  big, but he was a  good mile from the dip in the side of the ridge  before he found even a  crawfish. He crunched this down, shell and  all. It helped to take the  bad taste out of his mouth. 
  The day was destined to hold for him still another unforgettable   event in his life. Now that he was alone the memory of his master  was  not so vague as it had been yesterday, and the days before.   Brain-pictures came back to him more vividly as the morning   lengthened into afternoon, bridging slowly but surely the gulf  that  Neewa's comradeship had wrought. For a time the exciting  thrill of his  adventure was gone. Half a dozen times he hesitated  on the point of  turning back to Neewa. It was hunger that always  drove him on a little  farther. He found two more crawfish. Then  the creek deepened and its  water ran slowly, and was darker. Twice  he chased old rabbits, that  got away from him easily. Once he came  within an ace of catching a  young one. Frequently a partridge rose  with a thunder of wings. He saw  moose-birds, and jays, and many  squirrels. All about him was meat  which it was impossible for him  to catch. Then fortune turned his way.  Poking his head into the  end of a hollow log he cornered a rabbit so  completely that there  was no escape. During the next few minutes he  indulged in the  first square meal he had eaten for three days. 
  So absorbed was he in his feast that he was unconscious of a new   arrival on the scene. He did not hear the coming of Oochak, the   fisher-cat; nor, for a few moments, did he smell him. It was not  in  Oochak's nature to make a disturbance. He was by birth and  instinct a  valiant hunter and a gentleman, and when he saw Miki  (whom he took to  be a young wolf) feeding on a fresh kill, he made  no move to demand a  share for himself. Nor did he run away. He  would undoubtedly have  continued on his way very soon if Miki had  not finally sensed his  presence, and faced him. 
  Oochak had come from the other side of the log, and stood not more   than six feet distant. To one who knew as little of his history as   Miki there was nothing at all ferocious about him. He was shaped  like  his cousins, the weazel, the mink, and the skunk. He was  about half as  high as Miki, and fully as long, so that his two  pairs of short legs  seemed somewhat out of place, as on a  dachshund. He probably weighed  between eight and ten pounds, had a  bullet head, almost no ears, and  atrocious whiskers. Also he had a  bushy tail and snapping little eyes  that seemed to bore clean  through whatever he looked at. To Miki his  accidental presence was  a threat and a challenge. Besides, Oochak  looked like an easy  victim if it came to a fight. So he pulled back  his lips and  snarled. 
  Oochak accepted this as an invitation for him to move on, and   being a gentleman who respected other people's preserves he made  his  apologies by beginning a velvet-footed exit. This was too much  for  Miki, who had yet to learn the etiquette of the forest trails.  Oochak  was afraid of him. He was running away! With a triumphant  yelp Miki  took after him. After all, it was simply a mistake in  judgment. (Many  two-footed animals with bigger brains than Miki's  had made similar  mistakes.) For Oochak, attending always to his  own business, was, for  his size and weight, the greatest little  fighter in North America. 
  Just what happened in the one minute that followed his assault   Miki would never be able quite to understand. It was not in  reality a  fight; it was a one-sided immolation, a massacre. His  first impression  was that he had tackled a dozen Oochaks instead  of one. Beyond that  first impression his mind did not work, nor  did his eyes visualize. He  was whipped as he would never be  whipped again in his life. He was cut  and bruised and bitten; he  was strangled and stabbed; he was so  utterly mauled that for a  space after Oochak had gone he continued to  rake the air with his  paws, unconscious of the fact that the affair  was over. When he  opened his eyes, and found himself alone, he slunk  into the hollow  log where he had cornered the rabbit. 
  In there he lay a good half hour, trying hard to comprehend just   what had happened. The sun was setting when he dragged himself  out.  He limped. His one good ear was bitten clean through. There  were bare  spots on his hide where Oochak had scraped the hair off.  His bones  ached, his throat was sore, and there was a lump over  one eye. He  looked longingly back over the &quot;home&quot; trail. Up there  was Neewa. With  the lengthening shadows of the day's end a great  loneliness crept upon  him and a desire to turn back to his  comrade. But Oochak had gone that  way&#8212;and he did not want to meet  Oochak again. 
  He wandered a little farther south and east, perhaps a quarter of   a mile, before the sun disappeared entirely. In the thickening  gloom  of twilight he struck the Big Rock portage between the  Beaver and the  Loon. 
  It was not a trail. Only at rare intervals did wandering voyageurs   coming down from the north make use of it in their passage from  one  waterway to the other. Three or four times a year at the most  would a  wolf have caught the scent of man in it. It was there  tonight, so  fresh that Miki stopped when he came to it as if  another Oochak had  risen before him. For a space he was turned  into the rigidity of rock  by a single overwhelming emotion. All  other things were forgotten in  the fact that he had struck the  trail of a man&#8212;AND, THEREFORE, THE  TRAIL OF CHALLONER, HIS  MASTER. He began to follow it&#8212;slowly at  first, as if fearing that  it might get away from him. Darkness came,  and he was still  following it. In the light of the stars he persisted,  all else  crowded from him but the homing instinct of the dog and the  desire  for a master. 
  At last he came almost to the shore of the Loon, and there he saw   the campfire of Makoki and the white man. 
  He did not rush in. He did not bark or yelp; the hard schooling of   the wilderness had already set its mark upon him. He slunk in   cautiously&#8212;then stopped, flat on his belly, just outside the rim  of  firelight. Then he saw that neither of the men was Challoner.  But both  were smoking, as Challoner had smoked. He could hear  their voices, and  they were like Challoner's voice. And the camp  was the same&#8212;a fire, a  pot hanging over it, a tent, and in the  air the odours of recently  cooked things. 
  Another moment or two and he would have gone into the firelight.   But the white man rose to his feet, stretched himself as he had  often  seen Challoner stretch, and picked up a stick of wood as big  as his  arm. He came within ten feet of Miki, and Miki wormed  himself just a  little toward him, and stood up on his feet. It  brought him into a  half light. His eyes were aglow with the  reflection of the fire. And  the man saw him. 
  In a flash the club he held was over his head; it swung through   the air with the power of a giant arm behind it and was launched   straight at Miki. Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.   The big end of it missed him; the smaller end landed against his  neck  and shoulder, driving him back into the gloom with such force  and  suddenness that the man thought he had done for him. He called  out  loudly to Makoki that he had killed a young wolf or a fox, and  dashed  out into the darkness. 
  The club had knocked Miki fairly into the heart of a thick ground   spruce. There he lay, making no sound, with a terrible pain in his   shoulder. Between himself and the fire he saw the man bend over  and  pick up the club. He saw Makoki hurrying toward him with  ANOTHER club,  and under his shelter he made himself as small as he  could. He was  filled with a great dread, for now he understood the  truth. THESE men  were not Challoner. They were hunting for him&#8212;  with clubs in their  hands. He knew what the clubs meant. His  shoulder was almost broken. 
  He lay very still while the men searched about him. The Indian   even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce. The white man  kept  saying that he was sure he had made a hit, and once he stood  so near  that Miki's nose almost touched his boot. He went back and  added fresh  birch to the fire, so that the light of it illumined a  greater space  about them. Miki's heart stood still. But the men  searched farther on,  and at last went back to the fire. 
  For an hour Miki did not move. The fire burned itself low. The old   Cree wrapped himself in a blanket, and the white man went into his   tent. Not until then did Miki dare to crawl out from under the   spruce. With his bruised shoulder making him limp at every step he   hurried back over the trail which he had followed so hopefully a   little while before. The man-scent no longer made his heart beat   swiftly with joy. It was a menace now. A warning. A thing from  which  he wanted to get away. He would sooner have faced Oochak  again, or the  owls, than the white man with his club. With the  owls he could fight,  but in the club he sensed an overwhelming  superiority. 
  The night was very still when he dragged himself back to the   hollow log in which he had killed the rabbit. He crawled into it,  and  nursed his wounds through all the rest of the hours of  darkness. In  the early morning he came out and ate the rest of the  rabbit. 
  After that he faced the north and west&#8212;where Neewa was. There was   no hesitation now. He wanted Neewa again. He wanted to muzzle him   with his nose and lick his face even though he did smell to  heaven.  He wanted to hear him grunt and squeal in his funny,  companionable  way; he wanted to hunt with him again, and play with  him, and lie down  beside him in a sunny spot and sleep. Neewa, at  last, was a necessary  part of his world. 
  He set out. 
  And Neewa, far up the creek, still followed hopefully and   yearningly over the trail of Miki. 
  Half way to the dip, in a small open meadow that was a glory of   sun, they met. There was no very great demonstration. They stopped   and looked at each other for a moment, as if to make sure that  there  was no mistake. Neewa grunted. Miki wagged his tail. They  smelled  noses. Neewa responded with a little squeal, and Miki  whined. It was  as if they had said, 
  &quot;Hello, Miki!&quot; 
  &quot;Hello, Neewa!&quot; 
  And then Neewa lay down in the sun and Miki sprawled himself out   beside him. After all, it was a funny world. It went to pieces now   and then, but it always came together again. And to-day their  world  had thoroughly adjusted itself. Once more they were chums&#8212;  and they  were happy.
