  With the going of Black Roger also went the oppressive loneliness   which had gripped Carrigan, and as he stood listening to the low   voices outside, the undeniable truth came to him that he did not  hate  this man as he wanted to hate him. He was a murderer, and a  scoundrel  in another way, but he felt irresistibly the impulse to  like him and  to feel sorry for him. He made an effort to shake off  the feeling, but  a small voice which he could not quiet persisted  in telling him that  more than one good man had committed what the  law called murder, and  that perhaps he didn't fully understand  what he had seen through the  cabin window on the raft. And yet,  when unstirred by this impulse, he  knew the evidence was damning. 
  But his loneliness was gone. With Audemard's visit had come an   unexpected thrill, the revival of an almost feverish anticipation,   the promise of impending things that stirred his blood as he  thought  of them. &quot;You will understand strange things then,&quot; Roger  Audemard had  said, and something in his voice had been like a key  unlocking  mysterious doors for the first time. And then, &quot;Wait, as  patiently as  you can!&quot; Out of the basket on the table seemed to  come to him a  whispering echo of that same word&#8212;wait! He laid his  hands upon it,  and a pulse of life came with the imagined  whispering. It was from  Marie-Anne. It seemed as though the warmth  of her hands were still  there, and as he removed the cloth the  sweet breath of her came to  him. And then, in the next instant, he  was trying to laugh at himself  and trying equally hard to call  himself a fool, for it was the breath  of newly-baked things which  her fingers had made. 
  Yet never had he felt the warmth of her presence more strangely in   his heart. He did not try to explain to himself why Roger  Audemard's  visit had broken down things which had seemed  insurmountable an hour  ago. Analysis was impossible, because he  knew the transformation  within himself was without a shred of  reason. But it had come, and  with it his imprisonment took on  another form. Where before there had  been thought of escape and a  scheming to jail Black Roger, there  filled him now an intense  desire to reach the Yellowknife and the  Chateau Boulain. 
  It was after midnight when he went to bed, and he was up with the   early dawn. With the first break of day the bateau men were  preparing  their breakfast. David was glad. He was eager for the  day's work to  begin, and in that eagerness he pounded on the door  and called out to  Joe Clamart that he was ready for his breakfast  with the rest of them,  but that he wanted only hot coffee to go  with what Black Roger had  brought to him in the basket. 
  That afternoon the bateau passed Fort McMurray, and before the sun   was well down in the west Carrigan saw the green slopes of  Thickwood  Hills and the rising peaks of Birch Mountains. He  laughed outright as  he thought of Corporal Anderson and Constable  Frazer at Fort McMurray,  whose chief duty was to watch the big  waterway. How their eyes would  pop if they could see through the  padlocked door of his prison! But he  had no inclination to be  discovered now. He wanted to go on, and with  a growing exultation  he saw there was no intention on the part of the  bateau's crew to  loiter on the way. There was no stop at noon, and the  tie-up did  not come until the last glow of day was darkening into the  gloom  of night in the sky. For sixteen hours the bateau had traveled   steadily, and it could not have made less than sixty miles as the   river ran. The raft, David figured, had not traveled a third of  the  distance. 
  The fact that the bateau's progress would bring him to Chateau   Boulain many days, and perhaps weeks, before Black Roger and   Marie-Anne could arrive on the raft did not check his enthusiasm.  It  was this interval between their arrivals which held a great   speculative promise for him. In that time, if his efficiency had  not  entirely deserted him, he would surely make discoveries of  importance. 
  Day after day the journey continued without rest. On the fourth   day after leaving Fort McMurray it was Joe Clamart who brought in   David's supper, and he grunted a protest at his long hours of   muscle-breaking labor at the sweeps. When David questioned him he   shrugged his shoulders, and his mouth closed tight as a clam. On  the  fifth, the bateau crossed the narrow western neck of Lake  Athabasca,  slipping past Chipewyan in the night, and on the sixth  it entered the  Slave River. It was the fourteenth day when the  bateau entered Great  Slave Lake, and the second night after that,  as dusk gathered thickly  between the forest walls of the  Yellowknife, David knew that at last  they had reached the mouth of  the dark and mysterious stream which led  to the still more  mysterious domain of Black Roger Audemard. 
  That night the rejoicing of the bateau men ashore was that of men   who had come out from under a strain and were throwing off its   tension for the first time in many days. A great fire was built,  and  the men sang and laughed and shouted as they piled wood upon  it. In  the flare of this fire a smaller one was built, and kettles  and pans  were soon bubbling and sizzling over it, and a great  coffee pot that  held two gallons sent out its steam laden with an  aroma that mingled  joyously with the balsam and cedar smells in  the air. David could see  the whole thing from his window, and when  Joe Clamart came in with  supper, he found the meat they were  cooking over the fire was fresh  moose steak. As there had been no  trading or firing of guns coming  down, he was puzzled and when he  asked where the meat had come from  Joe Clamart only shrugged his  shoulders and winked an eye, and went  out singing about the  allouette bird that had everything plucked from  it, one by one.  But David noticed there were never more than four men  ashore at  the same time. At least one was always aboard the bateau,  watching  his door and windows. 
  And he, too, felt the thrill of an excitement working subtly   within him, and this thrill pounded in swifter running blood when  he  saw the men about the fire jump to their feet suddenly and go  to meet  new and shadowy figures that came up indistinctly just in  the edge of  the forest gloom. There they mingled and were lost in.  identity for a  long time, and David wondered if the newcomers were  of the people of  Chateau Boulain. After that, Bateese and Joe  Clamart and two others  stamped out the fires and came over the  plank to the bateau to sleep.  David followed their example and  went to bed. 
  The cook fires were burning again before the gray dawn was broken   by a tint of the sun, and when the voices of many men roused  David,  he went to his window and saw a dozen figures where last  night there  had been only four. When it grew lighter he recognized  none of them.  All were strangers. Then he realized the  significance of their  presence. The bateau had been traveling  north, but downstream. Now it  would still travel north, but the  water of the Yellow-knife flowed  south into Great Slave Lake, and  the bateau must be towed. He caught a  glimpse of the two big York  boats a little later, and six rowers to a  boat, and after that the  bateau set out slowly but steadily upstream. 
  For hours David was at one window or the other, with something of   awe working inside him as he saw what they were passing through&#8212;  and  between. He fancied the water trail was like an entrance into  a  forbidden land, a region of vast and unbroken mystery, a country  of  enchantment, possibly of death, shut out from the world he had  known.  For the stream narrowed, and the forest along the shores  was so dense  he could not see into it. The tree-tops hung in a  tangled canopy  overhead, and a gloom of twilight filled the  channel below, so that  where the sun shot through, it was like  filtered moonlight shining on  black oil. There was no sound except  the dull, steady beat of the  rowers' oars, and the ripple of water  along the sides of the bateau.  The men did not sing or laugh, and  if they talked it must have been in  whispers. There was no cry of  birds from ashore. And once David saw  Joe Clamart's face as he  passed the window, and it was set and hard  and filled with the  superstition of a man who was passing through a  devil-country. 
  And then suddenly the end of it came. A flood of sunlight burst in   at the windows, and all at once voices came from ahead, a laugh, a   shout, and a yell of rejoicing from the bateau, and Joe Clamart   started again the everlasting song of the allouette bird that was   plucked of everything it had. Carrigan found himself grinning.  They  were a queer people, these bred-in-the-blood northerners&#8212;  still moved  by the superstitions of children. Yet he conceded that  the awesome  deadness of the forest passage had put strange  thoughts into his own  heart. 
  Before nightfall Bateese and Joe Clamart came in and tied his arms   behind him, and he was taken ashore with the rumble of a waterfall  in  his ears. For two hours he watched the labors of the men as  they  beached the bateau on long rollers of smooth birch and rolled  it foot  by foot over a cleared trail until it was launched again  above the  waterfall. Then he was led back into the cabin and his  arms freed.  That night he went to sleep with the music of the  waterfall in his  ears. 
  The second day the Yellowknife seemed to be no longer a river, but   a narrow lake, and the third day the rowers came into the Nine  Lake  country at noon, and until another dusk the bateau threaded  its way  through twisting channels and impenetrable forests, and  beached at  last at the edge of a great open where the timber had  been cut. There  was more excitement here, but it was too dark for  David to understand  the meaning of it. There were many voices;  dogs barked. Then voices  were at his door, a key rattled in the  lock, and it opened. David saw  Bateese and Joe Clamart first. And  then, to his amazement, Black Roger  Audemard stood there, smiling  at him and nodding good-evening. 
  It was impossible for David to repress his astonishment. 
  &quot;Welcome to Chateau Boulain,&quot; greeted Black Roger. &quot;You are   surprised? Well, I beat you out by half a dozen hours&#8212;in a canoe,   m'sieu. It is only courtesy that I should be here to give you   welcome!&quot; 
  Behind him Bateese and Joe Clamart were grinning widely, and then   both came in, and Joe Clamart picked up his dunnage-sack and threw  it  over his shoulder. 
  &quot;If you will come with us, m'sieu&#8212;&quot; 
  David followed, and when he stepped ashore there were Bateese, and   Joe Clamart and one other behind him, and three or four shadowy   figures ahead, with Black Roger walking at his side. There were no   more voices, and the dog had ceased barking. Ahead was a wall of   darkness, which was the deep black forest beyond the clearing, and   into it led a trail which they followed. It was a path worn smooth  by  the travel of many feet, and for a mile not a star broke  through the  tree-tops overhead, nor did a flash of light break the  utter chaos of  the way but once, when Joe Clamart lighted his  pipe. No one spoke.  Even Black Roger was silent, and David found  no word to say. 
  At the end of the mile the trees began to open above their heads,   and they soon came to the edge of the timber. In the darkness  David  caught his breath. Dead ahead, not a rifle shot away, was  the Chateau  Boulain. He knew it before Black Roger had said a  word. He guessed it  by the lighted windows, full a score of them,  without a curtain drawn  to shut out their illumination from the  night. He could see nothing  but these lights, yet they measured  off a mighty place to be built of  logs in the heart of a  wilderness, and at his side he heard Black  Roger chuckling in low  exultation. 
  &quot;Our home, m'sieu,&quot; he said. &quot;Tomorrow, when you see it in the   light of day, you will say it is the finest chateau in the north&#8212;   all built of sweet cedar where birch is not used, so that even in  the  deep snows it gives us the perfume of springtime and flowers.&quot; 
  David did not answer, and in a moment Audemard said: 
  &quot;Only on Christmas and New Year and at birthdays and wedding   feasts is it lighted up like that. Tonight it is in your honor,   M'sieu David.&quot; Again he laughed softly, and under his breath he   added, &quot;And there is some one waiting for you there whom you will  be  surprised to see!&quot; 
  David's heart gave a jump. There was meaning in Black Roger's   words and no double twist to what he meant. Marie-Anne had come  ahead  with her husband! 
  Now, as they passed on to the brilliantly lighted chateau, David   made out the indistinct outlines of other buildings almost hidden  in  the out-creeping shadows of the forest-edges, with now and then  a ray  of light to show people were in them. But there was a  brooding silence  over it all which made him wonder, for there was  no voice, no bark of  dog, not even the opening or closing of a  door. As they drew nearer,  he saw a great veranda reaching the  length of the chateau, with  screening to keep out the summer pests  of mosquitoes and flies and the  night prowling insects attracted  by light. Into this they went, up  wide birch steps, and ahead of  them was a door so heavy it looked like  the postern gate of a  castle. Black Roger opened it, and in a moment  David stood beside  him in a dimly lighted hall where the mounted heads  of wild beasts  looked down like startled things from the gloom of the  walls. And  then David heard the low, sweet notes of a piano coming to  them  very faintly. 
  He looked at Black Roger. A smile was on the lips of the chateau   master; his head was up, and his eyes glowed with pride and joy as   the music came to him. He spoke no word, but laid a hand on  David's  arm and led him toward it, while Bateese and Joe Clamart  remained  standing at the entrance to the hall. David's feet trod  in thick rugs  of fur; he saw the dim luster of polished birch and  cedar in the  walls, and over his head the ceiling was rich and  matched, as in the  bateau cabin. They drew nearer to the music and  came to a closed door.  This Black Roger opened very quietly, as if  anxious not to disturb the  one who was playing. 
  They entered, and David held his breath. It was a great room he   stood in, thirty feet or more from end to end, and scarcely less  in  width&#8212;a room brilliant with light, sumptuous in its comfort,  sweet  with the perfume of wild-flowers, and with a great black  fireplace at  the end of it, from over which there stared at him  the glass eyes of a  monster moose. Then he saw the figure at the  piano, and something rose  up quickly and choked him when his eyes  told him it was not  Marie-Anne. It was a slim, beautiful figure in  a soft and shimmering  white gown, and its head was glowing gold in  the lamplight. 
  Roger Audemard spoke, &quot;Carmin!&quot; 
  The woman at the piano turned about, a little startled at the   unexpectedness of the voice, and then rose quickly to her feet&#8212;  and  David Carrigan found himself looking into the eyes of Carmin  Fanchet! 
  Never had he seen her more beautiful than in this moment, like an   angel in her shimmering dress of white, her hair a radiant glory,  her  eyes wide and glowing&#8212;and, as she looked at him, a smile  coming to  her red lips. Yes, SHE WAS SMILING AT HIM&#8212;this woman  whose brother he  had brought to the hangman, this woman who had  stolen Black Roger from  another! She knew him&#8212;he was sure of  that; she knew him as the man  who had believed her a criminal  along with her brother, and who had  fought to the last against her  freedom. Yet from her lips and her eyes  and her face the old  hatred was gone. She was coming toward him  slowly; she was  reaching out her hand, and half blindly his own went  out, and he  felt the warmth of her fingers for a moment, and he heard  her  voice saying softly, 
  &quot;Welcome to Chateau Boulain, M'sieu Carrigan.&quot; 
  He bowed and mumbled something, and Black Roger gently pressed his   arm, drawing him back to the door. As he went he saw again that   Carmin Fanchet was very beautiful as she stood there, and that her   lips were very red&#8212;but her face was white, whiter than he had  ever  seen the face of a woman before. 
  As they went up a winding stair to the second floor, Roger   Audemard said, &quot;I am proud of my Carmin, M'sieu David. Would any   other woman in the world have given her hand like that to the man  who  had helped to kill her brother?&quot; 
  They stopped at another door. Black Roger opened it. There were   lights within, and David knew it was to be his room. Audemard did  not  follow him inside, but there was a flashing humor in his eyes. 
  &quot;I say, is there another woman like her in the world, m'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;What have you done to Marie-Anne&#8212;your wife?&quot; asked David. 
  It was hard for him to get the words out. A terrible thing was   gripping at his throat, and the clutch of it grew tighter as he  saw  the wild light in Black Roger's eyes. 
  &quot;Tomorrow you will know, m'sieu. But not to-night. You must wait   until tomorrow,&quot; 
  He nodded and stepped back, and the door closed&#8212;and in the same   instant came the harsh grating of a key in the lock.
