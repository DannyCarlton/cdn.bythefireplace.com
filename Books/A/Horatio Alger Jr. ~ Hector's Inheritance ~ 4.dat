    Hector walked out of the house in a state of mental bewilderment  not  easily described. Was he not Hector Roscoe, after all? Had he been   all his life under a mistake? If this story were true, who was he,   who were his parents, what was his name? Why had the man whom he had   supposed to be his father not imparted to him this secret? He had   always been kind and indulgent; he had never appeared to regard the   boy as an alien in blood, but as a dearly loved son. Yet, if he had,   after all, left him unprovided for, he had certainly treated Hector   with great cruelty. 
  &quot;I won't believe it,&quot; said Hector, to himself. 
  &quot;I won't so wrong my dear father's memory at the bidding of this   man, whose interest it is to trump up this story, since he and his   son become the owners of a great estate in my place.&quot; 
  Just then Guy advanced toward Hector with a malicious smile upon  his  face. He knew very well what a blow poor Hector had received, for  he  was in his father's confidence, and he was mean enough, and   malicious enough, to rejoice at it. 
  &quot;What's the matter with you, Hector?&quot; he asked, with a grin. &quot;You   look as if you had lost your last friend.&quot; 
  Hector stopped short and regarded Guy fixedly. 
  &quot;Do you know what your father has been saying to me?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Well, I can guess,&quot; answered Guy. &quot;Ho! ho! It's a great joke that   you have all the time fancied yourself the heir of Castle Roscoe,   when you have no claim to it at all. I am the heir!&quot; he added,   drawing himself up proudly; &quot;and you are a poor dependent, and a   nobody. It's funny!&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps you won't think it so funny after this!&quot; said Hector,   coolly, exasperated beyond endurance. As he spoke he drew off, and  in  an instant Guy measured his length upon the greensward. 
  Guy rose, his face livid with passion, in a frame of mind far from   funny. He clinched his fists and looked at Hector as if he wished to   annihilate him. &quot;You'll pay for this,&quot; he screamed. &quot;You'll repent   it, bitterly, you poor, nameless dependent, low-born, very likely&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Hold, there!&quot; said Hector, advancing resolutely, and sternly  facing  the angry boy. &quot;Be careful what you say. If this story of your   father's is true, which I don't believe, you might have the decency   to let me alone, even if you don't sympathize with me. If you dare  to  say or hint anything against my birth, I'll treat you worse than  I  have yet.&quot; 
  &quot;You'll suffer for this!&quot; almost shrieked Guy. 
  &quot;I am ready to suffer now, if you are able to make me,&quot; said  Hector.  &quot;Come on, and we'll settle it now.&quot; 
  But Guy had no desire for the contest to which he was invited. He   had a wholesome fear of Hector's strong, muscular arms, aided, as   they were, by some knowledge of boxing. Hector had never taken   regular lessons, but a private tutor, whom his father had employed,  a  graduate of Yale, had instructed him in the rudiments of the  &quot;manly  art of self-defense,&quot; and Hector was very well able to take  care of  himself against any boy of his own size and strength. In  size, Guy was  his equal, but in strength he was quite inferior. This  Guy knew full  well, and, angry as he was, he by no means lost sight  of prudence. 
  &quot;I don't choose to dirty my hands with you,&quot; he said. &quot;I shall tell   my father, and it would serve you right if he sent you adrift.&quot; 
  In Hector's present mood, he would not, perhaps, have cared much if   this threat had been carried into execution, but he was not   altogether reckless, and he felt that it was best to remain under  Mr.  Roscoe's protection until he had had time to investigate the   remarkable story which he suspected his reputed uncle had trumped up   to serve his own interests. 
  &quot;Tell your father, if you like,&quot; said Hector, quietly. &quot;I don't  know  whether he will sustain you or not in your insults, but if he  does,  then I shall have two opponents instead of one.&quot; 
  &quot;Does that mean that you will attack my father?&quot; demanded Guy,   hoping for an affirmative answer, as it would help him to prejudice   his father against our hero. 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered Hector, smiling, &quot;I don't apprehend there will be  any  necessity, for he won't insult me as you have done.&quot; 
  Guy lost notime in seeking his father, and laying the matter before   him, inveighing against Hector with great bitterness. 
  &quot;So he knocked you down, did he, Guy?&quot; asked Allan Roscoe,   thoughtfully. 
  &quot;Yes; he took me unawares, or he couldn't have done it,&quot; answered   Guy, a little ashamed at the avowal. 
  &quot;What did you do?&quot; 
  &quot;I&#8212;I told him he should suffer for it.&quot; 
  &quot;Why did he attack you?&quot; 
  &quot;It was on account of something I said.&quot; 
  &quot;What was it?&quot; 
  Guy reluctantly answered this question, and with correctness. 
  &quot;It was your fault for speaking to him wrhen he was feeling sore at   making a painful discovery.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you justify him in pitching into me like a big brute?&quot; asked   Guy, hastily. 
  &quot;No; but still, I think it, was natural, under the circumstances.   You should have kept out of his way, and let him alone.&quot; 
  &quot;Won't you punish him for attacking me?&quot; demanded Guy, indignantly. 
  &quot;I will speak to him on the subject,&quot; said Allan Roscoe; &quot;and will   tell him my opinion of his act.&quot; 
  &quot;Then shan't I be revenged upon him?&quot; asked Guy, disappointed. 
  &quot;Listen, Guy,&quot; said his father. &quot;Is it no punishment that the boy  is  stripped of all his possessions, while you step into his place?   Henceforth he will be dependent upon me, and later, upon you. He has   been hurled down from his proud place as owner of Castle Roscoe, and   I have taken his place, as you will hereafter do.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Guy, gleefully; &quot;it will be a proud day when I become   master of the estate.&quot; 
  Allan Roscoe was not a specially sensitive man, but this remark of   his son jarred upon him. 
  &quot;You seem to forget, Guy, that you do not succeed till I am dead!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I suppose so,&quot; answered Guy, slowly. 
  &quot;It almost seems as if you were in a hurry for me to die.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't mean that, but it's natural to suppose that I shall live   longer than you do, isn't it?&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose so,&quot; returned Allan Roscoe, shortly. 
  &quot;Of course that's what I mean.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, since you are so much better off than Hector, you had better   be more considerate, and leave him to get over his disappointment as   well as he can.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall I send in Hector to see you?&quot; asked Guy, as he at length   turned to leave the room. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;You're to go in to my father,&quot; said Guy, reappearing on the lawn;   &quot;he's going to give it to you.&quot; 
  Hector anticipated some such summons, and he had remained in the   same spot, too proud to have it supposed that he shrank from the   interview. 
  With a firm, resolute step, he entered the presence of Allan  Roscoe. 
  &quot;I hear you wish to see me, Mr. Roscoe,&quot; he said, manfully. 
  &quot;Yes, Hector; Guy has come to me with complaints of you.&quot; 
  &quot;If he says I knocked him down for insulting me, he has told you  the  truth,&quot; said Hector, sturdily. 
  &quot;That was the substance of what he said, though he did not admit  the  insult.&quot; 
  &quot;But for that I should not have attacked him.&quot; 
  &quot;I do not care to interfere in boys' quarrels, except in extreme   cases,&quot; said Mr. Roscoe. &quot;I am afraid Guy was aggravatiag, and you   were unnecessarily violent.&quot; 
  &quot;It doesn't seem to me so,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;So I regard it. I have warned him not to add by taunts to the   poignancy of your disappointment. I request you to remember that Guy   is my son, and that I am disposed to follow my brother's directions,   and provide for and educate you.&quot; 
  Hector bowed and retired. He went out with a more favorable opinion   of Allan Roscoe, who had treated the difficulty in a reasonable   manner. 
  Allan Roscoe looked after him as he went out. 
  &quot;I hate that boy,&quot; he said, to himself; &quot;I temporize from motives  of  policy, but I mean to tame his haughty spirit yet.&quot;
