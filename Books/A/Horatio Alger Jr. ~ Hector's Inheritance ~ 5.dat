    Allan Roscoe's remonstrance with the two boys had the effect of   keeping the peace between them for the remainder of the week. Guy  did  not think it prudent to taunt Hector, unless backed up by his  father,  and he felt that the change in their relative positions was   satisfaction enough at present. Besides, his father, in a subsequent   conversation, had told Guy that it was his purpose to place Hector  in  a boarding school, where the discipline would be strict, and  where he  would be thrashed if he proved rebellious. 
  &quot;I shall tell Mr. Smith,&quot; he added, &quot;that the boy needs a strong   hand, and that I am not only perfectly willing that he should be   punished whenever occasion may call for it, but really desire it.&quot; 
  &quot;Good, good!&quot; commended Guy, gleefully. &quot;I hope old Smith'll lay it   on good.&quot; 
  &quot;I presume he will,&quot; said Allan Roscoe, smiling in sympathy with  his  son's exuberance. &quot;I am told by a man who knows him that he is a   tall man, strong enough to keep order, and determined to do it.&quot; 
  &quot;I should like to be there to see Hector's first flogging,&quot;  remarked  the amiable Guy. &quot;I'd rather see it than go to the theater  any  time.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see how you can, unless you also enter the school.&quot; 
  &quot;No, thank you,&quot; answered Guy. &quot;No boarding school for me. That   isn't my idea of enjoyment. I'd rather stay at home with you. Hector   won't be here to interfere with my using his horse and buggy.&quot; 
  &quot;They are his no longer. I give them to you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, father,&quot; said Guy, very much gratified. 
  &quot;But I would rather you would not use them till after Hector is   gone. It might disturb him.&quot; 
  &quot;That's just why I want to do it.&quot; 
  &quot;But it might make trouble. He might refuse to go to school.&quot; 
  &quot;You'd make him go, wouldn't you, father?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; but I wish to avoid forcible measures, if possible. Come,  Guy,  it's only till Monday; then Hector will be out of the way, and  you  can do as you please without fear of interference.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, father. I'll postpone my fun till he is out of the way.   You'll go with him, won't you?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Guy.&quot; 
  &quot;Just tell old Smith how to treat him. Tell him to show him no   mercy, if he doesn't behave himself.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem to dislike Hector very much. You shouldn't feel so. It   isn't Christian.&quot; 
  Guy looked at his father queerly out of the corner of his eye. He   understood him better than Allan Roscoe supposed. 
  &quot;I hope you won't insist on my loving him, father,&quot; he said. &quot;I   leave that to you.&quot; 
  &quot;I only wish you to avoid coming into collision with him. As for   love, that is something not within our power.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you be ready to go with me to boarding school on Monday   morning, Hector?&quot; asked Allan Roscoe, on Saturday afternoon. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  Indeed, Hector felt that it would be a relief to get away from the   house which he had been taught to look upon as his&#8212;first by right  of  inheritance, and later as actual owner. As long as he remained he  was  unpleasantly reminded of the great loss he had experienced.  Again, his  relations with Guy were unfriendly, and he knew that if  they were  permanently together it wouldn't be long before there  would be another  collision. Though in such a case he was sure to  come off victorious,  he did not care to contend, especially as no  advantage could come of  it in the end. 
  Of the boarding school kept by Mr. Socrates Smith he had never   heard, but felt that he would, at any rate, prefer to find himself   amid new scenes. If the school were a good one, he meant to derive   benefit from it, for he was fond of books and study, and thought   school duties no task. 
  &quot;I have carefully selected a school for you,&quot; continued Allan   Roscoe, &quot;because I wish to follow out my poor brother's wishes to  the  letter. A good education will fit you to maintain yourself, and  attain  a creditable station in life, which is very important, since  you will  have to carve your own future.&quot; 
  There was no objection to make to all this. Still, it did grate  upon  Hector's feelings, to be so often reminded of his penniless   position, when till recently he had regarded himself, and had been   regarded by others, as a boy of large property. 
  Smithville was accessible by railroad, being on the same line as  the  town of Plympton in which Roscoe Castle was situated. There was a   train starting at seven o'dock, which reached Smithville at   half-past, eight. This was felt to be the proper train to take, as  it  would enable Hector to reach school before the morning session  began.  Allan Roscoe, who was not an early riser, made an effort to  rise in  time, and succeeded. In truth, he was anxious to get Hector  out of the  house. It might be that the boy's presence was a tacit  reproach, it  might be that he had contracted a dislike for him. At  any rate, when  Hector descended to the breakfast room, he found Mr.  Roscoe already  there. 
  &quot;You are in time, Hector,&quot; said Mr. Roscoe. &quot;I don't know how early   they will get up at school, but I hope it won't be earlier than   this.&quot; 
  &quot;I have no objection to early rising,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;I have,&quot; said Allan Roscoe, gaping. 
  &quot;I am sorry to have inconvenienced you,&quot;  said Hector, politely. &quot;I  could have gone to school alone.&quot; 
  &quot;No doubt; but I wished an interview with Mr. Socrates Smith  myself.  I look upon myself in the light of your guardian, though you  are not  my nephew, as was originally supposed.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd give a good deal to know whether this is true,&quot; thought  Hector,  fixing his eyes attentively upon his uncle's face. 
  I have written &quot;uncle&quot; inadvertently, that being the character in   which Mr. Roscoe appeared to the world. 
  &quot;By the way, Hector,&quot; said Allan Roscoe, &quot;there is one matter which   we have not yet settled.&quot; 
  &quot;What is that, sir?&quot; 
  &quot;About your name.&quot; 
  &quot;My name is Hector Roscoe.&quot; 
  &quot;I beg your pardon. Assuming by brother's communication to be true,   and I think you will not question his word, you have no claim to the   name.&quot; 
  &quot;To what name have I a claim, then?&quot; asked Hector, pointedly. 
  &quot;To the name of your father&#8212;the last name, I mean. I have no   objection to your retaining the name of Hector.&quot; 
  &quot;What was the name of my, father?&quot; asked the boy. 
  &quot;Ahem! My brother did not mention that in his letter. Quite an   omission, I must observe.&quot; 
  &quot;Then it is clear that he meant to have me retain his own name,&quot;   said Hector, decisively. 
  &quot;That does not follow.&quot; 
  &quot;As I know no other name to which I have a claim, I shall certainly   keep the name of the kindest friend I ever had, whether he was my   father or not,&quot; said Hector, firmly. 
  Allan Roscoe looked annoyed. 
  &quot;Really,&quot; he said, &quot;I think this ill-judged, very ill-judged. It   will lead to misapprehension. It will deceive people into the belief   that you are a real Roscoe.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know but I am,&quot; answered Hector, with a calm look of   defiance, which aggravated Allan Roscoe. 
  &quot;Have I not told you you are not?&quot; he said, frowning. 
  &quot;You have; but you have not proved it,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;I am surprised that you should cling to a foolish delusion. You  are  only preparing trouble for yourself. If my word is not  sufficient&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You are an interested party. This story, if true, gives you my   property.&quot; 
  &quot;At any rate, you may take your father's&#8212;I mean my brother's&#8212;word   for it.&quot; 
  &quot;If he had told me so, I would believe it,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;You have it in black and white, in the paper I showed you. What   more do you want?&quot; 
  &quot;I want to be sure that that document is genuine. However, I won't   argue the question now. I have only been giving you my reasons for   keeping the name I have always regarded as mine.&quot; 
  Allan Roscoe thought it best to drop the subject; but the boy's   persistency disturbed him.
