  If it had not been for Langdon, this day of the fight between the  two bears would have held still greater excitement and another and  deadlier peril for Thor and Muskwa. Three minutes after the hunters had  arrived breathless and sweating upon the scene of the sanguinary  conflict Bruce was ready and anxious to continue the pursuit of Thor.  He knew the big grizzly could not be far away; he was certain that Thor  had gone up the mountain. He found signs of the grizzly's feet in the  gravel of the coulee at just about the time Thor and the tan-faced cub  struck the Bighorn Highway.
  His arguments failed to move Langdon. Stirred to the depth of his  soul by what he had seen, and what he saw about him now, the  hunter-naturalist refused to leave the blood-stained and torn-up arena  in which the grizzly and the black had fought their duel.
  &#8220;If I knew that I was not going to fire a single shot, I would  travel five thousand miles to see this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's worth thinking  about, and looking over, Bruce. The grizzly won't spoil. This will&#8212;in  a few hours. If there's a story here we can dig out I want it.&#8221;
  Again and again Langdon went over the battlefield, noting the  ripped-up ground, the big spots of dark-red stain, the strips of flayed  skin, and the terrible wounds on the body of the dead black. For half  an hour Bruce paid less attention to these things than he did to the  carcass of the caribou. At the end of that time he called Langdon to  the edge of the clump of balsams.
  &#8220;You wanted the story,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an' I've got it for you, Jimmy.&#8221;
  He entered the balsams and Langdon followed him. A few steps under  the cover Bruce halted and pointed to the hollow in which Thor had  cached his meat. The hollow was stained with blood.
  &#8220;You was right in your guess, Jimmy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our grizzly is a  meat-eater. Last night he killed a caribou out there in the meadow. I  know it was the grizzly that killed 'im an' not the black, because the  tracks along the edge of the timber are grizzly tracks. Come on. I'll  show you where 'e jumped the caribou!&#8221;
  He led the way back into the meadow, and pointed out where Thor had  dragged down the young bull. There were bits of flesh and a great deal  of stain where he and Muskwa had feasted.
  &#8220;He hid the carcass in the balsams after he had filled himself,&#8221;  went on Bruce. &#8220;This morning the black came along, smelled the meat,  an' robbed the cache. Then back come the grizzly after his morning  feed, an' that's what happened! There's yo'r story, Jimmy.&#8221;
  &#8220;And&#8212;he may come back again?&#8221; asked Langdon.
  &#8220;Not on your life, he won't!&#8221; cried Bruce. &#8220;He wouldn't touch that  carcass ag'in if he was starving. Just now this place is like poison to  him.&#8221;
  After that Bruce left Langdon to meditate alone on the field of  battle while he began trailing Thor. In the shade of the balsams  Langdon wrote for a steady hour, frequently rising to establish new  facts or verify others already discovered. Meanwhile the mountaineer  made his way foot by foot up the coulee. Thor had left no blood, but  where others would have seen nothing Bruce detected the signs of his  passing. When he returned to where Langdon was completing his notes,  his face wore a look of satisfaction.
  &#8220;He went over the mount'in,&#8221; he said briefly.
  It was noon before they climbed over the volcanic quarry of rock and  followed the Bighorn Highway to the point where Thor and Muskwa had  watched the eagle and the sheep. They ate their lunch here, and scanned  the valley through their glasses. Bruce was silent for a long time.  Then he lowered his telescope, and turned to Langdon.
  &#8220;I guess I've got his range pretty well figgered out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He  runs these two valleys, an' we've got our camp too far south. See that  timber down there? That's where our camp should be. What do you say to  goin' back over the divide with our horses an' moving up here?&#8221;
  &#8220;And leave our grizzly until to-morrow?&#8221;
  Bruce nodded.
  &#8220;We can't go after 'im and leave our horses tied up in the  creek-bottom back there.&#8221;
  Langdon boxed his glasses and rose to his feet. Suddenly he grew  rigid.
  &#8220;What was that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't hear anything,&#8221; said Bruce.
  For a moment they stood side by side, listening. A gust of wind  whistled about their ears. It died away.
  &#8220;Hear it!&#8221; whispered Langdon, and his voice was filled with a sudden  excitement.
  &#8220;The dogs!&#8221; cried Bruce.
  &#8220;Yes, the dogs!&#8221;
  They leaned forward, their ears turned to the south, and faintly  there came to them the distant, thrilling tongue of the Airedales!
  Metoosin had come, and he was seeking them in the valley!
