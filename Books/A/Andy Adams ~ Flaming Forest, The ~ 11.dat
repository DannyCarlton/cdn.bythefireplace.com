  For a space there was silence between Carrigan and St. Pierre's   wife. He knew what she was thinking as she stood with her back to  the  door, waiting half defiantly, her cheeks still flushed, her  eyes  bright with the anticipation of battle. She was ready to  fight for the  broken creature on the other side of the door. She  expected him to  give no quarter in his questioning of her, to  corner her if he could,  to demand of her why the deformed giant  had spoken the name of the man  he was after, Black Roger Audemard.  The truth hammered in David's  brain. It had not been a delusion of  his fevered mind after all; it  was not a possible deception of the  half-breed's, as he had thought  last night. Chance had brought him  face to face with the mystery of  Black Roger. St. Pierre's wife,  waiting for him to speak, was in some  way associated with that  mystery, and the cripple was asking for the  man McVane had told  him to bring in dead or alive! Yet he did not  question her. He  turned to the window and looked out from where  Marie-Anne had  stood a few moments before. 
  The day was glorious. On the far shore he saw life where last   night's camp had been. Men were moving about close to the water,  and  a York boat was putting out slowly into the stream. Close  under the  window moved a canoe with a single occupant. It was  Andre, the Broken  Man. With powerful strokes he was paddling  across the river. His  deformity was scarcely noticeable in the  canoe. His bare head and  black beard shone in the sun, and between  his great shoulders his head  looked more than ever to Carrigan  like the head of a carven god. And  this man, like a mighty tree  stricken by lightning, his mind gone, was  yet a thing that was  more than mere flesh and blood to Marie-Anne  Boulain! 
  David turned toward her. Her attitude was changed. It was no   longer one of proud defiance. She had expected to defend herself  from  something, and he had given her no occasion for defense. She  did not  try to hide the fact from him, and he nodded toward the  window. 
  &quot;He is going away in a canoe. I am afraid you didn't want me to   see him, and I am sorry I happened to be here when he came.&quot; 
  &quot;I made no effort to keep him away, M'sieu David. Perhaps I wanted   you to see him. And I thought, when you did&#8212;&quot; She hesitated. 
  &quot;You expected me to crucify you, if necessary, to learn the truth   of what he knows about Roger Audemard,&quot; he said. &quot;And you were  ready  to fight back. But I am not going to question you unless you  give me  permission.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad,&quot; she said in a low voice. &quot;I am beginning to have   faith in you, M'sieu David. You have promised not to try to  escape,  and I believe you. Will you also promise not to ask me  questions,  which I can not answer&#8212;until St. Pierre comes?&quot; 
  &quot;I will try.&quot; 
  She came up to him slowly and stood facing him, so near that she   could have reached out and put her hands on his shoulders. 
  &quot;St. Pierre has told me a great deal about the Scarlet Police,&quot;   she said, looking at him quietly and steadily. &quot;He says that the  men  who wear the red jackets never play low tricks, and that they  come  after a man squarely and openly. He says they are men, and  many times  he has told me wonderful stories of the things they  have done. He  calls it 'playing the game.' And I'm going to ask  you, M'sieu David,  will you play square with me? If I give you the  freedom of the bateau,  of the boats, even of the shore, will you  wait for St. Pierre and play  the rest of the game out with him,  man to man?&quot; 
  Carrigan bowed his head slightly. &quot;Yes, I will wait and finish the   game with St. Pierre.&quot; 
  He saw a quick throb come and go in her white throat, and with a   sudden, impulsive movement she held out her hand to him. For a  moment  he held it close. Her little fingers tightened about his  own, and the  warm thrill of them set his blood leaping with the  thing he was  fighting down. She was so near that he could feel the  throb of her  body. For an instant she bowed her head, and the  sweet perfume of her  hair was in his nostrils, the lustrous beauty  of it close under his  lips. 
  Gently she withdrew her hand and stood back from him. To Carrigan   she was like a young girl now. It was the loveliness of girlhood  he  saw in the flush of her face and in the gladness that was  flaming  unashamed in her eyes. 
  &quot;I am not frightened any more,&quot; she exclaimed, her voice trembling   a bit. &quot;When St. Pierre comes, I shall tell him everything. And  then  you may ask the questions, and he will answer. And he will  not cheat!  He will play square. You will love St. Pierre, and you  will forgive me  for what happened behind the rock!&quot; 
  She made a little gesture toward the door. &quot;Everything is free to   you out there now,&quot; she added. &quot;I shall tell Bateese and the  others.  When we are tied up, you may go ashore. And we will forget  all that  has happened, M'sieu David. We will forget until St.  Pierre comes.&quot; 
  &quot;St. Pierre!&quot; he groaned. &quot;If there were no St. Pierre!&quot; 
  &quot;I should be lost,&quot; she broke in quickly. &quot;I should want to die!&quot; 
  Through the open window came the sound of a voice. It was the   weird monotone of Andre, the Broken Man. Marie-Anne went to the   window. And David, following her, looked over her head, again so  near  that his lips almost touched her hair. Andre had come back.  He was  watching two York boats that were heading for the bateau. 
  &quot;You heard him asking for Black Roger Audemard,&quot; she said. &quot;It is   strange. I know how it must have shocked you when he stood like  that  in the door. His mind, like his body, is a wreck, M'sieu  David. Years  ago, after a great storm, St. Pierre found him in the  forest. A tree  had fallen on him. St. Pierre carried him in on his  shoulders. He  lived, but he has always been like that. St. Pierre  loves him, and  poor Andre worships St. Pierre and follows him  about like a dog. His  brain is gone. He does not know what his  name is, and we call him  Andre. And always, day and night, he is  asking that same question,  'Has any one seen Black Roger  Audemard?' Sometime&#8212;if you will, M'sieu  David&#8212;I should like to  have you tell me what it is so terrible that  you know about Roger  Audemard.&quot; 
  The York boats were half-way across the river, and from them came   a sudden burst of wild song. David could make out six men in each   boat, their oars flashing in the morning sun to the rhythm of  their  chant. Marie-Anne looked up at him suddenly, and in her face  and eyes  he saw what the starry gloom of evening had half hidden  from him in  those thrilling moments when they shot through the  rapids of the Holy  Ghost. She was girl now. He did not think of  her as woman. He did not  think of her as St. Pierre's wife. In  that upward glance of her eyes  was something that thrilled him to  the depth of his soul. She seemed,  for a moment, to have dropped a  curtain from between herself and him. 
  Her red lips trembled, she smiled at him, and then she faced the   river again, and he leaned a little forward, so that a breath of  wind  floated a shimmering tress of her hair against his cheek. An   irresistible impulse seized upon him. He leaned still nearer to  her,  holding his breath, until his lips softly touched one of the  velvety  coils of her hair. And then he stepped back. Shame swept  over him. His  heart rose and choked him, and his fists were  clenched at his side.  She had not noticed what he had done, and  she seemed to him like a  bird yearning to fly out through the  window, throbbing with the desire  to answer the chanting song that  came over the water. And then she was  smiling up again into his  face hardened with the struggle which he was  making with himself. 
  &quot;My people are happy,&quot; she cried. &quot;Even in storm they laugh and   sing. Listen, m'sieu. They are singing La Derniere Domaine. That  is  our song. It is what we call our home, away up there in the  lost  wilderness where people never come&#8212;the Last Domain. Their  wives and  sweethearts and families are up there, and they are  happy in knowing  that today we shall travel a few miles nearer to  them. They are not  like your people in Montreal and Ottawa and  Quebec, M'sieu David. They  are like children. And yet they are  glorious children!&quot; 
  She ran to the wall and took down the banner of St. Pierre   Boulain. &quot;St. Pierre is behind us,&quot; she explained. &quot;He is coming  down  with a raft of timber such as we can not get in our country,  and we  are waiting for him. But each day we must float down with  the stream a  few miles nearer the homes of my people. It makes  them happier, even  though it is but a few miles. They are coming  now for my bateau. We  shall travel slowly, and it will be  wonderful on a day like this. It  will do you good to come outside,  M'sieu David&#8212;with me. Would you  care for that? Or would you  rather be alone?&quot; 
  In her face there was no longer the old restraint. On her lips was   the witchery of a half-smile; in her eyes a glow that flamed the   blood in his veins. It was not a flash of coquetry. It was  something  deeper and warmer than that, something real&#8212;a new  Marie-Anne Boulain  telling him plainly that she wanted him to  come. He did not know that  his hands were still clenched at his  side. Perhaps she knew. But her  eyes did not leave his face, eyes  that were repeating the invitation  of her lips, openly asking him  not to refuse. 
  &quot;I shall be happy to come,&quot; he said. 
  The words fell out of him numbly. He scarcely heard them or knew   what he was saying, yet he was conscious of the unnatural note in  his  voice. He did not know he was betraying himself beyond that,  did not  see the deepening of the wild-rose flush in the cheeks of  St. Pierre's  wife. He picked up his pipe from the table and moved  to accompany her. 
  &quot;You must wait a little while,&quot; she said, and her hand rested for   an instant upon his arm. Its touch was as light as the touch of  his  lips had been against her shining hair, but he felt it in  every nerve  of his body. &quot;Nepapinas is making a special lotion for  your hurt. I  will send him in, and then you may come.&quot; 
  The wild chant of the rivermen was near as she turned to the door.   From it she looked back at him swiftly. 
  &quot;They are happy, M'sieu David,&quot; she repeated softly. &quot;And I, too,   am happy. I am no longer afraid. And the world is beautiful again.   Can you guess why? It is because you have given me your promise,   M'sieu David, and because I believe you!&quot; 
  And then she was gone. 
  For many minutes he did not move. The chanting of the rivermen, a   sudden wilder shout, the voices of men, and after that the grating  of  something alongside the bateau came to him like sounds from  another  world. Within himself there was a crash greater than that  of physical  things. It was the truth breaking upon him, truth  surging over him  like the waves of a sea, breaking down the  barriers he had set up,  inundating him with a force that was  mightier than his own will. A  voice in his soul was crying out the  truth&#8212;that above all else in the  world he wanted to reach out his  arms to this glorious creature who  was the wife of St. Pierre,  this woman who had tried to kill him and  was sorry. He knew that  it was not desire for beauty. It was the  worship which St. Pierre  himself must have for this woman who was his  wife. And the shock  of it was like a conflagration sweeping through  him, leaving him  dead and shriven, like the crucified trees standing  in the wake of  a fire. A breath that was almost a cry came from him,  and his  fists knotted until they were purple. She was St. Pierre's  wife!  And he, David Carrigan, proud of his honor, proud of the  strength  that made him man, had dared covet her in this hour when her   husband was gone! He stared at the closed door, beginning to cry  out  against himself, and over him there swept slowly and terribly  another  thing&#8212;the shame of his weakness, the hopelessness of the  thing that  for a space had eaten into him and consumed him. 
  And as he stared, the door opened, and Nepapinas came in.
