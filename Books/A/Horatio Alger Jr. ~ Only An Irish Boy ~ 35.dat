  Dr. Townley thought it best to consult with the town authorities as  to the course to be pursued, since, as it appeared, the town was  interested in the will. It was decided that the doctor and Mr. Graves,  who was the Chairman of the Selectmen, should go to Boston the next day  and inform Mrs. Preston of the discovery of the will. Until after this  interview it was deemed best not to mention the matter to Andy or his  mother.
  Mrs. Preston was established in a showy house at the South End. At  last she was living as she desired to do. She went to the theater and  the opera, and was thinking whether she could afford to set up a  carriage. Godfrey she had placed at a private school, and was anxious  to have him prepare for admission to Harvard College, but in this hope  she seemed destined to be disappointed. Godfrey wanted to see life and  enjoy himself, and had no intention of submitting to the drudgery of  hard study.
  &#8220;Godfrey,&#8221; said his mother one morning, &#8220;I have received a letter  from your teacher, complaining that you don't work.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not going to work myself to death,&#8221; answered Godfrey.
  &#8220;I don't expect you to hurt yourself with work, but I want you to go  to college.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, well, I'll get in somehow.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you want to stand well as a scholar?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;I leave that to the poor fellows that have got to work for a  living. I am rich.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may lose your money.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't mean to.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you do?&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will go to work.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should like to have you graduate well at college and then study  law. You might get into Congress,&#8221; said his mother.
  &#8220;I guess I'll know enough for that,&#8221; said Godfrey, carelessly. &#8220;I  want to have a good time.&#8221;
  That was not the worst of it, however. He extorted from his mother a  large allowance, which he spent at bars and billiard saloons, and one  day was brought home drunk by a schoolfellow.
  &#8220;Oh, Godfrey, how can you do so?&#8221; exclaimed the selfish woman, for  once fairly alarmed on another's account.
  &#8220;Hush up, old woman!&#8221; hiccoughed Godfrey.
  Mrs. Preston was mortified to think this should be said to her  before Godfrey's schoolmate.
  &#8220;He does not know what he is saying,&#8221; she said, apologetically.
  &#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; persisted Godfrey. &#8220;I'm a&#8212;a gen'leman's son. I don't  want you to interfere with gen'leman's son.&#8221;
  He was put to bed, and awoke the next morning with a splitting  headache. It was the morning of the day which the doctor and Mr. Graves  had chosen to call on Mrs. Preston. She was preparing to go out, when a  servant came upstairs to announce that two gentlemen were in the  parlor, and wanted to see her.
  &#8220;Two gentlemen! What do they look like, Nancy?&#8221;
  &#8220;One of 'em looks like he was from the country, mum.&#8221;
  This referred to Mr. Graves, who did have a rustic look. The doctor  would readily have passed for a Bostonian.
  &#8220;Did they give their names?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, mum.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will go down directly. I suppose they won't stay long.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston sailed into the parlor with the air of a city lady, as  she proudly imagined, but stopped short in some surprise when she  recognized her visitors. Of course, she did not suspect the nature of  their business.
  Dr. Townley arose as she entered.
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mrs. Preston,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope I find you well?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am quite well,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, coldly, for she had never  liked the doctor. She had an unpleasant feeling that he understood her,  and was not among her admirers. &#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Graves. You come to  the city occasionally?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't often get time to come up, but the doctor thought I ought  to come.&#8221;
  &#8220;Indeed! I am sorry to say that I am just going out.&#8221;
  &#8220;I must ask you to defer going till we have communicated our  business,&#8221; said the doctor.
  &#8220;Business?&#8221; repeated Mrs. Preston, seating herself in some surprise.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;business of importance. In short, your husband's will has come  to light.&#8221;
  &#8220;My husband's will!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Preston. &#8220;I thought&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  She checked herself suddenly. She was about to say, &#8220;I thought I had  destroyed it,&#8221; and that would have let the cat out of the bag with a  vengeance.
  &#8220;You thought that he left no will,&#8221; said the doctor, finishing the  sentence for her. &#8220;He really left two&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Two!&#8221;
  &#8220;That's it&#8212;he executed two&#8212;exactly alike. One he left in my  hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is a likely story!&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, excitedly. &#8220;If that is  the case, why, I ask, have we heard nothing of this before?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because it was contained in an envelope, which I was requested not  to open for six months after his decease. The time having expired&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;May I ask what are the provisions of this pretended will?&#8221; demanded  Mrs. Preston, in visible excitement.
  &#8220;Mrs. Preston,&#8221; said the doctor, with dignity, &#8220;you appear to forget  that you are addressing a gentleman. I am above fabricating a will, as  you seem to insinuate. As to the provisions, it leaves five thousand  dollars to the town for the establishment of a public library, and five  thousand dollars to Andy Burke, besides the small house in which she  used to live to the widow Burke.&#8221;
  The worst had come. In spite of her criminal act, she must lose the  ten thousand dollars; and, worst of all, those whom she hated and  despised were to profit by her loss.
  &#8220;This is simply outrageous, Dr. Townley,&#8221; she said.
  &#8220;You are speaking of your husband's will, Mrs. Preston.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't believe he made it.&#8221;
  &#8220;There can be no doubt of it. Mr. Graves has examined it, and he and  myself are so familiar with the handwriting of your husband that we  have no hesitation in pronouncing the will genuine.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston must have been insane if he really made such a  will.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was his medical adviser,&#8221; said Dr. Townley, quietly, &#8220;and I never  detected the least sign of an unsound mind.&#8221;
  &#8220;The fact of robbing his wife and child to enrich an Irishwoman and  her son is proof enough of his insanity.&#8221;
  &#8220;Pardon me, madam, but such bequests are made every day. Outside of  their legacies your husband left ample fortune, and there is no danger  of your being impoverished.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you bring the will with you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. I did not feel like incurring the risk.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall contest the will,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, passionately.
  &#8220;I would not advise you to. The proof of its genuineness is  overwhelming. I suppose you never saw the other will?&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston, at this unexpected question, in spite of her strong  nerves, turned pale, and faltered:
  &#8220;Of course not,&#8221; she said, after a slight pause.
  &#8220;Your husband asserts positively in a note to me that he made one,&#8221;  said the doctor, bending his eyes searchingly upon her, for he  suspected the truth, and that it was distrust of his wife that led  Colonel Preston to take the precaution he had done. &#8220;Its disappearance  is mysterious.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; cried Mrs. Preston, sharply, and not altogether  without alarm.
  &#8220;I meant only to express my surprise.&#8221;
  &#8220;If your business is over, I will go out.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have only this to say, that, being named in the will as executor,  I shall take immediate measures to have the will admitted to probate.  Should you make up your mind to contest it, you can give me due notice  through your legal adviser. In that case,&#8221; he added, significantly,  &#8220;the question of the disappearance of the other will will come up.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will consult my lawyer,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston.
  Though she said this, her determination was already made.  &#8220;Conscience makes cowards of us all,&#8221; and the doctor's last hint  alarmed her so much that she decided to make no opposition to the  setting up of the will. But it was a bitter pill to swallow.
  &#8220;Graves,&#8221; said Dr. Townley, as he left the house, &#8220;that woman  destroyed the other will.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; asked Mr. Graves, startled.
  &#8220;I feel sure of it. Let me predict also that she will not contest  this will. She is afraid to.&#8221;
  And the doctor was right.
