Next afternoon, about two o'clock, Alan called with a tremulous  heart at the cottage. Herminia had heard not a little of him  meanwhile from her friend Mrs. Dewsbury. "He's a charming young  man, my dear," the woman of the world observed with confidence.  "I felt quite sure you'd attract one another. He's so clever and  advanced, and everything that's dreadful,--just like yourself,  Herminia. But then he's also very well connected. That's always  something, especially when one's an oddity. You wouldn't go down  one bit yourself, dear, if you weren't a dean's daughter. The  shadow of a cathedral steeple covers a multitude of sins. Mr.  Merrick's the son of the famous London gout doctor,--you <i>must</i> know  his name,--all the royal dukes flock to him. He's a barrister  himself, and in excellent practice. You might do worse, do you  know, than to go in for Alan Merrick."    
Herminia's lip curled an almost imperceptible curl as she answered  gravely, "I don't think you quite understand my plans in life, Mrs.  Dewsbury. It isn't my present intention to <i>go in</i> for anybody."    
But Mrs. Dewsbury shook her head. She knew the world she lived in.  "Ah, I've heard a great many girls talk like that beforehand," she  answered at once with her society glibness; "but when the right man  turned up, they soon forgot their protestations. It makes a lot of  difference, dear, when a man really asks you!"    
Herminia bent her head. "You misunderstand me," she replied. "I  don't mean to say I will never fall in love. I expect to do that.  I look forward to it frankly,--it is a woman's place in life. I  only mean to say, I don't think anything will ever induce me to  marry,--that is to say, legally."    
Mrs. Dewsbury gave a start of surprise and horror. She really  didn't know what girls were coming to nowadays,--which, considering  her first principles, was certainly natural. But if only she had  seen the conscious flush with which Herminia received her visitor  that afternoon, she would have been confirmed in her belief that  Herminia, after all, in spite of her learning, was much like other  girls. In which conclusion Mrs. Dewsbury would not in the end have  been fully justified.    
When Alan arrived, Herminia sat at the window by the quaintly  clipped box-tree, a volume of verse held half closed in her hand,  though she was a great deal too honest and transparent to pretend  she was reading it. She expected Alan to call, in accordance with  his promise, for she had seen at Mrs. Dewsbury's how great an  impression she produced upon him; and, having taught herself that  it was every true woman's duty to avoid the affectations and  self-deceptions which the rule of man has begotten in women, she  didn't try to conceal from herself the fact that she on her side  was by no means without interest in the question how soon he would  pay her his promised visit. As he appeared at the rustic gate in  the privet hedge, Herminia looked out, and changed color with  pleasure when she saw him push it open.    
"Oh, how nice of you to look me up so soon!" she cried, jumping  from her seat (with just a glance at the glass) and strolling out  bareheaded into the cottage garden. "Isn't this a charming place?  Only look at our hollyhocks! Consider what an oasis after six  months of London!"    
She seemed even prettier than last night, in her simple white  morning dress, a mere ordinary English gown, without affectation of  any sort, yet touched with some faint reminiscence of a flowing  Greek chiton. Its half-classical drapery exactly suited the severe  regularity of her pensive features and her graceful figure. Alan  thought as he looked at her he had never before seen anybody who  appeared at all points so nearly to approach his ideal of  womanhood. She was at once so high in type, so serene, so  tranquil, and yet so purely womanly.    
"Yes, it <i>is</i> a lovely place," he answered, looking around at the  clematis that drooped from the gable-ends. "I'm staying myself  with the Watertons at the Park, but I'd rather have this pretty  little rose-bowered garden than all their balustrades and Italian  terraces. The cottagers have chosen the better part. What  gillyflowers and what columbines! And here you look out so  directly on the common. I love the gorse and the bracken, I love  the stagnant pond, I love the very geese that tug hard at the  silverweed, they make it all seem so deliciously English."    
"Shall we walk to the ridge?" Herminia asked with a sudden burst of  suggestion. "It's too rare a day to waste a minute of it indoors.  I was waiting till you came. We can talk all the freer for the  fresh air on the hill-top."    
Nothing could have suited Alan Merrick better, and he said so at  once. Herminia disappeared for a moment to get her hat. Alan  observed almost without observing it that she was gone but for a  second. She asked none of that long interval that most women  require for the simplest matter of toilet. She was back again  almost instantly, bright and fresh and smiling, in the most modest  of hats, set so artlessly on her head that it became her better  than all art could have made it. Then they started for a long  stroll across the breezy common, yellow in places with upright  spikes of small summer furze, and pink with wild pea-blossom. Bees  buzzed, broom crackled, the chirp of the field cricket rang shrill  from the sand-banks. Herminia's light foot tripped over the spongy  turf. By the top of the furthest ridge, looking down on North  Holmwood church, they sat side by side for a while on the close  short grass, brocaded with daisies, and gazed across at the cropped  sward of Denbies and the long line of the North Downs stretching  away towards Reigate. Tender grays and greens melted into one  another on the larches hard by; Betchworth chalk-pit gleamed dreamy  white in the middle distance. They had been talking earnestly all  the way, like two old friends together; for they were both of them  young, and they felt at once that nameless bond which often draws  one closer to a new acquaintance at first sight than years of  converse. "How seriously you look at life," Alan cried at last, in  answer to one of Herminias graver thoughts. "I wonder what makes  you take it so much more earnestly than all other women?"    
"It came to me all at once when I was about sixteen," Herminia  answered with quiet composure, like one who remarks upon some  objective fact of exernal nature. "It came to me in listening to a  sermon of my father's,--which I always look upon as one more  instance of the force of heredity. He was preaching on the text,  'The Truth shall make you Free,' and all that he said about it  seemed to me strangely alive, to be heard from a pulpit. He said  we ought to seek the Truth before all things, and never to rest  till we felt sure we had found it. We should not suffer our souls  to be beguiled into believing a falsehood merely because we  wouldn't take the trouble to find out the Truth for ourselves by  searching. We must dig for it; we must grope after it. And as he  spoke, I made up my mind, in a flash of resolution, to find out the  Truth for myself about everything, and never to be deterred from  seeking it, and embracing it, and ensuing it when found, by any  convention or preconception. Then he went on to say how the Truth  would make us Free, and I felt he was right. It would open our  eyes, and emancipate us from social and moral slaveries. So I made  up my mind, at the same time, that whenever I found the Truth I  would not scruple to follow it to its logical conclusions, but  would practise it in my life, and let it make me Free with perfect  freedom. Then, in search of Truth, I got my father to send me to  Girton; and when I had lighted on it there half by accident, and it  had made me Free indeed, I went away from Girton again, because I  saw if I stopped there I could never achieve and guard my freedom.  From that day forth I have aimed at nothing but to know the Truth,  and to act upon it freely; for, as Tennyson says,--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>'To live by law <br>Acting the law we live by without fear, <br>And because right is right to follow right, <br>Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'"</small></i></blockquote><br>
She broke off suddenly, and looking up, let her eye rest for a  second on the dark thread of clambering pines that crest the down  just above Brockham. "This is dreadfully egotistical," she cried,  with a sharp little start. "I ought to apologize for talking so  much to you about my own feelings."    
Alan gazed at her and smiled. "Why apologize," he asked, "for  managing to be interesting? You, are not egotistical at all. What  you are telling me is history,--the history of a soul, which is  always the one thing on earth worth hearing. I take it as a  compliment that you should hold me worthy to hear it. It is a  proof of confidence. Besides," he went on, after a second's pause,  "I am a man; you are a woman. Under those circumstances, what  would otherwise be egotism becomes common and mutual. When two  people sympathize with one another, all they can say about  themselves loses its personal tinge and merges into pure human and  abstract interest."    
Herminia brought back her eyes from infinity to his face. "That's  true," she said frankly. "The magic link of sex that severs and  unites us makes all the difference. And, indeed, I confess I  wouldn't so have spoken of my inmost feelings to another woman."
