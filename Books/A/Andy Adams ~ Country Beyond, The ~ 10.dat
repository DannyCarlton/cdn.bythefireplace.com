  North and west, in the direction of Yellow Bird's people, went   Jolly Roger and Peter after that night. They traveled slowly and   cautiously, and with each day Peter came to understand more  clearly  there was some reason why they must be constantly on their  guard. His  master, he noticed, was thrillingly attentive whenever  a sound came to  their ears&#8212;perhaps the cracking of a twig, a  mysterious movement of  brush, or the tread of a cloven hoof. And  instinctively he came to  know they were evading Man. He remembered  vividly their escape from  Cassidy and their quiet hiding for many  days in the mass of sun-baked  rocks which Jolly Roger had called  the Stew-Kettle. The same vigilance  seemed to be a part of his  master's movements now. He did not laugh,  or sing, or whistle, or  talk loudly. He built fires so small that at  first Peter was  absorbed in an almost scientific analysis of them; and  instead of  shooting game which could have been easily secured he set  little  snares in the evening, and caught fish in the streams. At night   they always slept half a mile or more from the place where they  had  built their tiny supper-fire. And during these hours of sleep  Peter  was ready to rouse himself at the slightest sound of  movement near  them. Scarcely a night passed that his low growl of  warning did not  bring Jolly Roger out of his slumber, a hand on  his gun, and his eyes  and ears wide open. 
  Whether he would have used the gun had the red-coated police   suddenly appeared, McKay had not quite assured himself. Day after  day  the same old fight went on within him. He analyzed his  situation from  every point of view, and always&#8212;no matter how he  went about  it&#8212;eventually found himself face to face with the same  definite fact.  If the law succeeded in catching Him it would not  trouble itself to  punish him for stealing back the Treaty Money,  or for holding up  Government mails, or for any of his other  misdemeanors. It would hang  him for the murder of Jed Hawkins. And  the minions of the law would  laugh at the truth, even if he told  it&#8212;which he never would. More  than once his imaginative genius  had drawn up a picture of that  impossible happening. For it was a  truth so inconceivable that he  found the absurdity of it a grimly  humorous thing. Even Nada believed  he had killed her scoundrelly  foster-father. Yet it was  she&#8212;herself&#8212;who had killed him! And it  was Nada whom the law would  hang, if the truth was known&#8212;and  believed. 
  Frequently he went back over the scenes of that tragic night at   Cragg's Ridge when all the happiness in the world seemed to be   offering itself to him&#8212;the night when Nada was to go with him to  the  Missioner's, to become his wife, And then&#8212;the dark trail&#8212;  the  disheveled girl staggering to him through the starlight, and  her  sobbing story of how Jed Hawkins had tried to drag her through  the  forest to Mooney's cabin, and how&#8212;at last&#8212;she had saved  herself by  striking him down with a stick which she had caught up  out of the  darkness. Would the police believe HIM&#8212;an outlaw&#8212;if  he told the rest  of the story?&#8212;how he had gone back to give Jed  Hawkins the beating of  his life, and had found him dead in the  trail, where Nada had struck  him down? Would they believe him if,  in a moment of cowardice, he told  them that to protect the girl he  loved he had fastened the  responsibility of the crime upon  himself? No, they would not. He had  made the evidence too  complete. The world would call him a lying  yellow-back if he  betrayed what had actually happened on the trail  between Cragg's  Ridge and Mooney's cabin. 
  And this, after all, was the one remaining bit of happiness in   Jolly Roger's heart, the knowledge that he had made the evidence   utterly complete, and that Nada would never know, and the world  would  never know&#8212;the truth. His love for the blue-eyed girl-woman  who had  given her heart and her soul into his keeping, even when  she knew he  was an outlaw, was an undying thing, like his love for  the mother of  years ago. &quot;It will be easy to die for her,&quot; he told  Peter, and this,  in the end, was what he knew he was going to do.  Thought of the  inevitable did not make him afraid. He was  determined to keep his  freedom and his life as long as he could,  but he was fatalistic  enough, and sufficiently acquainted with the  Royal Northwest Mounted  Police, to know what the ultimate of the  thing would be. And yet, with  tragedy behind him, and a still  grimmer tragedy ahead, the soul of  Jolly Roger was not dead or in  utter darkness. In it, waking and  sleeping, he enshrined the girl  who had been willing to give up all  other things in the world for  him, who had pleaded with him in the  last hour of storm down on  the edge of civilization that she be given  the privilege of  accompanying him wherever his fate might lead. That  he was an  outlaw had not destroyed her faith in him. That he had  killed a  man&#8212;a man unfit to live&#8212;had only drawn her arms more  closely  about him, and had made her more completely a part of him. And  a  thousand times the maddening thought possessed Jolly Roger&#8212;was he   wrong, and not right, in refusing to accept the love and   companionship which she had begged him to accept, in spite of all   that had happened and all that might happen? 
  Day by day he slowly won for himself, and at last, as they   traveled in the direction of Yellow Bird's country, he crushed the   final doubt that oppressed him, and knew that he was right. In his   selfishness he had not shackled her to an outlaw. He had left her   free. Life and hope and other happiness were ahead of her. He had  not  destroyed her, and this thought would strengthen him and leave   something of gladness in his heart, even in that gray dawn when  the  law would compel him to make his final sacrifice. 
  It is a strange peace which follows grief, a secret happiness no   other soul but one can understand. Out of it excitement and  passion  have been burned, and it is then the Great God of things  comes more  closely into the possession of his own. And now, as  they went westward  and north toward the Wollaston Lake country,  this peace possessed  Jolly Roger. It mellowed his world. It was  half an ache, half a steady  and undying pain, but it drew Life  nearer to him than he had ever  known it before. His love for the  sun and the sky, for the trees and  flowers and all growing things  of the earth was more worship of the  divine than a love for  physical things, and each day he felt it  drawing more closely  about him in its comradeship, whispering to him  of its might, and  of its power to care for him in the darkest hours of  stress that  might come. 
  He did not travel fast after he had reached the decision to go to   Yellow Bird's people. And he tried to imagine, a great deal of the   time, that Nada was with him. He succeeded in a way that  bewildered  Peter, for quite frequently the man talked to someone  who was not  there. 
  The slowness and caution with which they traveled developed   Peter's mental faculties with marvelous swiftness. His master,  free  of egoism and prejudice, had placed him on a plane of  intimate  equality, and Peter struggled each day to live up a  little more to the  responsibility of this intimacy and confidence.  Instinct, together  with human training, taught him woodcraft until  in many ways he was  more clever than his master. And along with  this Jolly Roger slowly  but surely impressed upon him the  difference between wanton slaughter  and necessary killing. 
  &quot;Everything that's got a breath of life must kill&#8212;up to a certain   point,&quot; Jolly Roger explained to him, repeating the lesson over  and  over. &quot;And that isn't wrong, Peter. The sin is in killing when  you  don't have to. See that tree over there, with a vine as big as  my  wrist winding around it, like a snake? Well, that vine is  choking the  life out of the tree, and in time the tree will die.  But the vine is  doing just what God A'mighty meant it to do. It  needs a tree to live  on. But I'm going to cut the vine, because I  think more of the tree  than I do the vine. That's MY privilege&#8212;  following my conscience. And  we're eating young partridges  tonight, because we had to have  something to keep us alive. It's  the necessity of the thing that  counts, Peter. Think you can  understand that?&quot; 
  It was pretty hard for Peter at first, but he was observant, and   his mind worked quickly. The crime of destroying birdlings in  their  nest, or on the ground, was impressed upon him. He began to  understand  there was a certain humiliating shame attached to an  attack upon a  creature weaker than himself, unless there was a  reason for it. He  looked chiefly to his master for decisions in  the matter. Snowshoe  rabbits, young and half grown, were very tame  in this month of August,  and ordinarily he would have destroyed  many of them in a day's travel.  But unless Jolly Roger gave him a  signal, or he was hungry, he would  pass a snowshoe unconcernedly.  This phase of Peter's development  interested Jolly Roger greatly.  The outlaw's philosophy had not been  punctured by the egotistical  &quot;I am the only reasoning being&quot; arguments  of narrow-gauged nature  scientists. He believed that Peter possessed  not only a brain and  super-instinct, but also a very positive  reasoning power which he  was helping to develop. And the process was  one that fascinated  him. When he was not sleeping, or traveling, or  teaching Peter he  was usually reading the wonderful little red volumes  of history  which he had purloined from the mail sledge up near the  Barren  Lands. He knew their contents nearly by heart. His favorites  were  the life-stories of Napoleon, Margaret of Anjou, and Peter the   Great, and always when he compared his own troubles with the   difficulties and tragedies over which these people had triumphed  he  felt a new courage and inspiration, and faced the world with  better  cheer. If Nature was his God and Bible, and Nada his Angel,  these  finger-worn little books written by a man half a century  dead were  voices out of the past urging him on to his best. Their  pages were  filled with the vivid lessons of sacrifice, of courage  and  achievement, of loyalty, honor and dishonor&#8212;and of the  crashing  tragedy which comes always with the last supreme egoism  and arrogance  of man. He marked the dividing lines, and applied  them to himself. And  he told Peter of his conclusions. He felt a  consuming tenderness for  the glorious Margaret of Anjou, and his  heart thrilled one day when a  voice seemed to whisper to him out  of the printed page that Nada was  another Margaret&#8212;only more  wonderful because she was not a princess  and a queen. 
  &quot;The only difference,&quot; he explained to Peter, &quot;is that Margaret   sacrificed and fought and died for a king, and our Nada is willing  to  do all that for a poor beggar of an outlaw. Which makes  Margaret a  second-rater compared with Nada,&quot; he added. &quot;For  Margaret wanted a  kingdom along with her husband, and Nada would  take&#8212;just you and me.  And that's where we're pulling some Peter  the Great stuff,&quot; he tried  to laugh. &quot;We won't let her do it!&quot; 
  And so they went on, day after day, toward the Wollaston   waterways&#8212;the country of Yellow Bird and her people. 
  It was early September when they crossed the Geikie and struck up   the western shore of Wollaston Lake. The first golden tints were   ripening in the canoe-birch leaves, and the tremulous whisper of   autumn was in the rustle of the aspen trees. The poplars were   yellowing, the ash were blood red with fruit, and in cool, dank   thickets wild currants were glossy black and lusciously ripe. It  was  the season which Jolly Roger loved most of all, and it was the   beginning of Peter's first September. The days were still hot, but  at  night there was a bracing something in the air that stirred the  blood,  and Peter found a sharp, new note in the voices of the  wild. The wolf  howled again in the middle of the night. The loon  forgot his  love-sickness, and screamed raucous defiance at the  moon. The big  snowshoes were no longer tame, but wary and alert,  and the owls seemed  to slink deeper into darkness and watch with  more cunning. And Jolly  Roger knew the human masters of the  wilderness were returning from the  Posts to their cabins and trap-  lines, and he advanced with still  greater caution. And as he went,  watching for smoke and listening for  sound, he began to reflect  upon the many changes which five years  might have produced among  Yellow Bird's people. Possibly other  misfortunes had come, other  winters of hunger and pestilence,  scattering and destroying the  tribe. It might even be that Yellow Bird  was dead. 
  For three days he followed slowly the ragged shore of Wollaston   Lake, and foreboding of evil was oppressing him when he came upon  the  fish-racks of the Indians. They had been abandoned for many  days, for  black bear tracks fairly inundated the place, and Peter  saw two of the  bears&#8212;fat and unafraid&#8212;nosing along the shore  where the fish offal  had been thrown. 
  It was the next day, in the hour before sunset, that Jolly Roger   and Peter came out on the edge of a shelving beach where Indian   children were playing in the white sand. Among these children,   playing and laughing with them, was a woman. She was tall and  slim,  with a skirt of soft buckskin that came only a little below  her knees,  and two shining black braids which tossed like velvety  ropes when she  ran. And she was running when they first saw her&#8212;  running away from  them, pursued by the children; and then she  twisted suddenly, and came  toward them, until with a startled cry  she stopped almost within the  reach of Jolly Roger's hands. Peter  was watching. He saw the half  frightened look in her face, then  the slow widening of her dark eyes,  and the quick intake of her  breath. And in that moment Jolly Roger  cried out a name. 
  &quot;Yellow Bird!&quot; 
  He went to her slowly, wondering if it could be possible the years   had touched Yellow Bird so lightly; and Yellow Bird reached out  her  hands to him, her face flaming up with sudden happiness, and  Peter  wondered what it was all about as he cautiously eyed the  half dozen  brown-faced little Indian children who had now gathered  quietly about  them. In another moment there was an interruption. A  girl came through  the fringe of willows behind them. It was as if  another Yellow Bird  had come to puzzle Peter&#8212;the same slim,  graceful little body, the  same shining eyes, and yet she was half  a dozen years younger than  Nada. For the first time Peter was  looking at Sun Cloud, the daughter  of Yellow Bird. And in that  moment he loved her, just as something  gave him confidence and  faith in the starry-eyed woman whose hands  were in his master's.  Then Yellow Bird called, and the girl went to  her mother, and  Jolly Roger hugged her in his arms and kissed her on  the scarlet  mouth she turned up to him. Then they hurried along the  shore  toward the fishing camp, the children racing ahead to tell the   news, led by Sun Cloud&#8212;with Peter running at her heels. 
  Never had Peter heard anything from a man's throat like the two   yells that came from Slim Buck, Yellow Bird's husband and chief of   the tribe, after he had greeted Jolly Roger McKay. It was a note   harking back to the old war trails of the Crees, and what followed  it  that night was most exciting to Peter. Big fires were built of  white  driftwood, and there was singing and dancing, and a great  deal of  laughter and eating, and the interminable howling of half  a hundred  Siwash dogs. Peter did not like the dogs, but he did no  fighting  because his love for Sun Cloud kept him close to the  touch of her  little brown hand. 
  That night, in the glow of the big fire outside of Slim Buck's   tepee, Jolly Roger's heart thrilled with a pleasure which it had  not  known for a long time. He loved to look at Yellow Bird. Five  years had  not changed her. Her eyes were starry bright. Her teeth  were like  milk. The color still came and went in her brown cheeks,  even as it  did in Sun Cloud's. All of which, in this heart of a  wilderness, meant  that she had been happy and prosperous. And he  also loved to look at  Sun Cloud, who possessed all of that rare  wildflower beauty sometimes  given to the northern Crees. And it  did him good to look at Slim Buck.  He was a splendid mate, and a  royal father, and Jolly Roger found  himself strangely happy in  their happiness. In the eyes of men and  women and little children  he saw that happiness all about him. For  three winters there had  been splendid trapping, Slim Buck told him,  and this season they  had caught and dried enough fish to carry them  through the  following winter, even if black days should come. His  people were  rich. They had many warm blankets, and good clothes, and  the best  of tepees and guns and sledges, and several treasures  besides. Two  of these Yellow Bird and her husband disclosed to Jolly  Roger this  first night. One of them was a sewing machine, and the  other&#8212;a  phonograph! And Jolly Roger listened to &quot;Mother Machree&quot; and  &quot;The  Rosary&quot; that night as he sat by Wollaston Lake with six hundred   miles of wilderness between him and Cragg's Ridge. 
  Later, when the camp slept, Yellow Bird and Slim Buck and Jolly   Roger still sat beside the red embers of their fire, and Jolly  Roger  told of what had happened down at the edge of civilization.  It was  what his heart needed, and he left out none of the details.  Slim Buck  was listening, but Jolly Roger knew he was talking  straight at Yellow  Bird, and that her warm heart was full of  understanding. Softly, in  that low Cree voice which is the  sweetest of all voices, she asked him  many questions about Nada,  and gently her slim fingers caressed the  tress of Nada's hair  which he let her take in her hands. And after a  long time, she  said. 
  &quot;I have given her a name. She is Oo-Mee, the Pigeon.&quot; 
  Slim Buck started at the strange note in her voice. 
  &quot;The Pigeon,&quot; he repeated, 
  &quot;Yes, Oo-Mee, the Pigeon,&quot; Yellow Bird nodded. She was not looking   at them. In the firelight her eyes were glowing pools. Her body  had  grown a little tense. Without asking Jolly Roger's permission  she  placed the tress of Nada's hair in her bosom. &quot;Oo-Mee, the  Pigeon,&quot;  she said again, looking far away. &quot;That is her name,  because the  Pigeon flies fast and straight and true. Over forests  and lakes and  worlds the Pigeon flies. It is tireless. It is  swift. It always&#8212;flies  home.&quot; 
  Slim Buck rose quietly to his feet. 
  &quot;Come,&quot; he whispered, looking at Jolly Roger, 
  Yellow Bird did not look at them or speak to them, and Slim Buck&#8212;   with his hand on Jolly Roger's arm&#8212;pulled him gently away. In his   eyes was a little something of fear, and yet along with it a  sublime  faith. 
  &quot;Her spirit will be with Oo-Mee, the Pigeon, tonight,&quot; he said in   a voice struck with awe. &quot;It will go to this place which you have   described, and it will live in the body of the girl, and through   Yellow Bird it will tell you tomorrow what has happened, and what  is  going to happen.&quot; 
  In the edge of the shore-willows Jolly Roger stood for a time   watching Yellow Bird as she sat under the stars, motionless as a   figure graven out of stone. He felt a curious tingling at his  heart,  something stirring uneasily in his breast, and he stood  alone even  after Slim Buck had stretched himself out in the soft  sand to sleep.  He was not superstitious. Yet it was equally a part  of his philosophy  and his creed to believe in the overwhelming  power of the mind. &quot;If  you have faith enough, and think hard  enough, you can think anything  until it comes true,&quot; he had told  himself more than once. And he knew  Yellow Bird possessed that  illimitable faith, and that behind her  divination lay generations  and centuries of an unbreakable certainty  in the power of mind  over matter. He realized his own limitations, but  a mysterious  voice in the still night seemed whispering to him that in  the  crude wisdom of Yellow Bird's brain lay the secret to strange   achievement, and that on this night her mind might perform for him   what he, in his greater wisdom, would call a miracle. He had seen   things like that happen. And he sat down in the sand, sleepless,  and  with Peter at his feet waited for Yellow Bird to stir. 
  He could see the dull shimmer of starlight in her hair, but the   rest of her was a shadow that gave no sign of life. The camp was   asleep. Even the dogs were buried in their wallows of sand, and  the  last red spark of the fires had died out. The hour passed, and  another  hour followed, and the lids of Jolly Roger's eyes grew  heavier as the  fading stars seemed to be sinking deeper into  infinity. At last he  slept, with his back leaning against a sand-  dune the children had  made. He dreamed, and was flying through the  air with Yellow Bird. She  was traveling swift and straight, like  an arrow, and he had difficulty  in keeping up with her, and at  last he cried out for her to wait&#8212;that  he could go no farther.  The cry roused him. He opened his eyes, and  found cool, gray dawn  in the sky. Peter, alert, was muzzling his hand.  Slim Buck lay in  the sand, still asleep. There was no stir in the  camp. And then,  with a sudden catch in his breath, he looked toward  Yellow Bird's  tepee. 
  Yellow Bird still sat in the sand. Through the hours of fading   starlight and coming dawn she had not moved. Slowly McKay rose to  his  feet. When he came to her, making no sound, she looked up. The  shimmer  of glistening dew was in her hair. Her long lashes were  wet with it.  Her face was very pale, and her eyes so large and  dark that for a  moment they startled him. She was tired.  Exhaustion was in her slim,  limp body. 
  A sigh came from her lips, and her shoulders swayed a little. 
  &quot;Sit down, Neekewa,&quot; she whispered, drawing the ropes of her hair   about her as if she were cold. 
  Then she drew a slim hand over her eyes, and shivered. 
  &quot;It is well, Neekewa,&quot; she spoke softly. &quot;I have gone through the   clouds to where lives Oo-Mee, the Pigeon. I found her crying in a   trail. I whispered to her and happiness came, and that happiness  is  going to live&#8212;for Neekewa and The Pigeon. It cannot die. It  cannot be  killed. The Red Coated men of the Great White Father  will never  destroy it. You will live. She will live. You will meet  again&#8212;in  happiness. And happiness will follow ever after. That  much I learned,  Neekewa. In happiness&#8212;you will meet again.&quot; 
  &quot;Where? When?&quot; whispered Jolly Roger, his heart beating with   sudden swiftness. 
  Again Yellow Bird passed her hand over her eyes, and as she held   it there for a moment she bowed her head until Jolly Roger could  see  only her dew-wet hair and she said, 
  &quot;In the Country Beyond, Neekewa.&quot; 
  Her eyes were looking at him again, big, dark and filled with   mystery. 
  &quot;And where is this country, Yellow Bird?&quot; he asked, a strange   chill driving the warmth out of his heart. &quot;You mean&#8212;up there?&quot;  And  he pointed to the gray sky above them. 
  &quot;No, it is happiness to come in life, not in death,&quot; said Yellow   Bird slowly. &quot;It is not beyond the stars. It is&#8212;&quot; 
  He waited, leaning toward her. 
  &quot;In the Country Beyond,&quot; she repeated with a tired little droop of   her head. &quot;And where that is I do not know, Neekewa. I could not  pass  beyond the great white cloud that shut me out. But it is&#8212;  somewhere,  I will find it. And then I will tell you&#8212;and The  Pigeon.&quot; 
  She stood up, and swayed in the gray light, like one worn out by   hard travel. Then she passed into the tepee, and Jolly Roger heard   her fall on her blanket-bed. 
  And still stranger whisperings filled his heart as he faced the   east, where the first red blush of day drove back the star-mists  of  dawn. He heard a step in the soft sand, and Slim Buck stood  beside  him. And he asked. 
  &quot;Did you ever hear of the Country Beyond?&quot; Slim Buck shook his   head, and both looked in silence toward the rising sun. 
  Peter was glad when the camp roused itself out of sleep with   waking voices, and laughter, and the building of fires. He waited   eagerly for Sun Cloud. At last she came out of Yellow Bird's  tepee,  rubbing her eyes in the face of the glow in the east, and  then her  white teeth flashed a smile of welcome at him. Together  they ran down  to the edge of the lake, and Peter wagged his tail  while Sun Cloud  went out knee-deep and scrubbed her pretty face  with handfuls of the  cool water. It was a happy day for him. He  was different from the  Indian dogs, and Sun Cloud and her  playmates made much of him. But  never, even in their most exciting  play, did he entirely lose track of  his master. 
  Jolly Roger, to an extent, forgot Peter. He tried to deaden within   him the impulses which Yellow Bird's conjuring had roused. He  tried  to see in them a menace and a danger, and he repeated to  himself the  folly of placing credence in Yellow Bird's &quot;medicine.&quot;  But his efforts  were futile, and he was honest enough to admit it.  The uneasiness was  in his breast. A new hope was rising up. And  with that hope were fear  and suspense, for deep in him was growing  stronger the conviction that  what Yellow Bird would tell him would  be true. He noted the calm and  dignified stiffness with which Slim  Buck greeted the day. The young  chief passed quietly among his  people. A word traveled in whispers,  voices and footsteps were  muffled and before the sun was an hour high  there was no tepee  standing but one on that white strip of beach. And  the one tepee  was Yellow Bird's, 
  Not until the camp was gone, leaving her alone, did Yellow Bird   come out into the day. She saw the food placed at her tepee door.  She  saw the empty places where the homes of her people had stood,  and in  the wet sand of the beach the marks of their missing  canoes. Then she  turned her pale face and tired eyes to the sun,  and unbraided her hair  so that it streamed glistening all about  her and covered the white  sand when she sat down again in front of  the smoke-darkened canvas  that had become her conjurer's house. 
  Two miles up the beach Slim Buck's people made another camp. But   Slim Buck and Jolly Roger remained in the cover of a wooded  headland  only half a mile from Yellow Bird. They saw her when she  came out.  They watched for an hour after she sat down in the sand.  And then Slim  Buck grunted, and with a gesture of his hands said  they would go.  Jolly Roger protested. It was not safe for Yellow  Bird to remain  entirely beyond their protection. There were bears  prowling about. And  human beasts occasionally found their way  through the wilderness. But  Slim Buck's face was like a bronze  carving in its faith and pride. 
  &quot;Yellow Bird only goes with the good spirits,&quot; he assured Jolly   Roger. &quot;She does not do witchcraft with the bad. And no harm can  come  while the good spirits are with her. It is thus she has  brought us  happiness and prosperity since the days of the famine,  Neekewa!&quot; 
  He spoke these words in Cree, and McKay answered him in Cree as   they turned in the direction of the camp. Half way, Sun Cloud came  to  meet them, with Peter at her side. She put a brown little hand  in  Jolly Roger's. It was quite new and pleasant to be kissed as  Jolly  Roger had kissed her, and she held up her mouth to him  again. Then she  ran ahead, with Peter yipping foolishly and  happily at her moccasined  heels. 
  And Jolly Roger said, 
  &quot;I wish I was your brother, Slim Buck, and Nada was Yellow Bird's   sister&#8212;and that I had many like her,&quot; and his eyes followed Sun   Cloud with hungry yearning. 
  And as he said these words, Yellow Bird sat with bowed head and   closed eyes, with the soft tress of Nada's hair in her hands. It  was  the physical union between them, and all that day, and the  night that  followed, Yellow Bird held it in her hand or against  her breast as she  struggled to send out the soul that was in her  on its mission to  Oo-Mee the Pigeon. In darkness she buried the  food that was left her,  and stamped on it with her feet. The  sacrifice of her body had begun,  and for two days thereafter Jolly  Roger and Slim Buck saw no movement  of life about the lone tepee  in the sand. 
  But the third morning they saw the smoke of a little greenwood   fire rising straight up from in front of it. 
  Slim Buck drew in a deep breath. It was the signal fire. 
  &quot;She knows,&quot; he said, pointing for Jolly Roger to go. &quot;She is   calling you!&quot; 
  The tenseness was gone from the bronze muscles of his face. He was   lonely without Yellow Bird, and the signal fire meant she would be   with him again soon. Jolly Roger walked swiftly over the white  beach.  Again he tried to tell himself what folly it all was, and  that he was  answering the signal-fire only to humor Yellow Bird  and Slim Buck. But  words, even spoken half aloud, did not quiet  the eager beating of his  heart. 
  Not until he was very near did Yellow Bird come out of the tepee.   And it was then Jolly Roger stopped short, a gasp on his lips. She   was changed. Her radiant hair was still down, polished smooth; but   her face was whiter than he had ever seen it, and drawn and  pinched  almost as in the days of the famine. For two days and two  nights she  had taken no food, and for two days and two nights she  had not slept.  But there was triumph in her big, wide-open eyes,  and Jolly Roger felt  something strange rising up in his breast. 
  Yellow Bird held out her hands toward him. 
  &quot;We have been together, The Pigeon and I,&quot; she said. &quot;We have   slept in each other's arms, and the warmth of her head has lain   against my breast. I have learned the secrets, Neekewa&#8212;all but  one.  The spirits will not tell me where lies the Country Beyond.  But it is  not up there&#8212;beyond the stars. It is not in death, but  in life you  will find it. That they have told me. And you must not  go back to  where The Pigeon lives, for you will find black  desolation there&#8212;but  always you must keep on and on, seeking for  the Country Beyond. You  will find it. And there also you will find  The Pigeon&#8212;and happiness.  You cannot fail, Neekewa, yet my heart  stings me that I cannot tell  you where that strange country is.  But when I came to it gold and  silver clouds shut it in, and I  could see nothing, and yet out of it  came the singing of birds and  the promise of sweet voices that it  shall be found&#8212;if you seek  faithfully, Neekewa.

  &quot;I'll find it, Yellow Bird,&quot; he cried. &quot;I'll find this place you   call the Country Beyond! And when I do&#8212;&quot; 
  He turned and took one of Yellow Bird's slim hands in both his   own. 
  &quot;And when I do, we'll come back to you, Yellow Bird,&quot; he said. 
  And like a cavalier of old he touched his lips gently to the palm   of Yellow Bird's little brown hand.
