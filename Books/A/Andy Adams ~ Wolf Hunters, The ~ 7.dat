  For one long breath Rod and Wabi stared at their companion, only  half believing, yet startled by the strange look in the old warrior's  face.
  &#8220;Twent' t'ousand dead men!&#8221; he repeated. As he raised his hand,  partly to give emphasis and partly to brush the cobwebs from his face,  the boys saw it trembling in a way that even Wabi had never witnessed  before.
  &#8220;Ugh!&#8221;
  In another instant Wabi was at the window, head and shoulders in, as  Mukoki had been before him. After a little he pulled himself back and  as he glanced at Rod he laughed in an odd thrilling way, as though he  had been startled, but not so much so as Mukoki, who had prepared him  for the sight which had struck his own vision with the unexpectedness  of a shot in the back.
  &#8220;Take a look, Rod!&#8221;
  With his breath coming in little uneasy jerks Rod approached the  black aperture. A queer sensation seized upon him&#8212;a palpitation, not  of fear, but of something; a very unpleasant feeling that seemed to  choke his breath, and made him wish that he had not been asked to peer  into that mysterious darkness. Slowly he thrust his head through the  hole. It was as black as night inside. But gradually the darkness  seemed to be dispelled. He saw, in a little while, the opposite wall of  the cabin. A table outlined itself in deep shadows, and near the table  there was a pile of something that he could not name; and tumbled over  that was a chair, with an object that might have been an old rag half  covering it.
  His eyes traveled nearer. Outside Wabi and Mukoki heard a startled,  partly suppressed cry. The boy's hands gripped the sides of the window.  Fascinated, he stared down upon an object almost within arm's reach of  him.
  There, leaning against the cabin wall, was what half a century or  more ago had been a living man! Now it was a mere skeleton, a  grotesque, terrible-looking object, its empty eye-sockets gleaming  dully with the light from the window, its grinning mouth, distorted  into ghostly life by the pallid mixture of light and gloom, turned full  up at him!
  Rod fell back, trembling and white.
  &#8220;I only saw one,&#8221; he gasped, remembering Mukoki's excited estimate.
  Wabi, who had regained his composure, laughed as he struck him two  or three playful blows on the back. Mukoki only grunted.
  &#8220;You didn't look long enough, Rod!&#8221; he cried banteringly. &#8220;He got on  your nerves too quick. I don't blame you, though. By George, I'll bet  the shivers went up Muky's back when he first saw 'em! I'm going in to  open the door.&#8221;
  Without trepidation the young Indian crawled through the window.  Rod, whose nervousness was quickly dispelled, made haste to follow him,  while Mukoki again threw his weight against the door. A few blows of  Wabi's belt-ax and the door shot inward so suddenly that the old Indian  went sprawling after it upon all fours.
  A flood of light filled the interior of the cabin. Instinctively  Rod's eyes sought the skeleton against the wall. It was leaning as if,  many years before, a man had died there in a posture of sleep. Quite  near this ghastly tenant of the cabin, stretched at full length upon  the log floor, was a second skeleton, and near the overturned chair was  a small cluttered heap of bones which were evidently those of some  animal. Rod and Wabi drew nearer the skeleton against the wall and were  bent upon making a closer examination when an exclamation from Mukoki  attracted their attention to the old pathfinder. He was upon his knees  beside the second skeleton, and as the boys approached he lifted eyes  to them that were filled with unbounded amazement, at the same time  pointing a long forefinger to come object among the bones.
  &#8220;Knife&#8212;fight&#8212;heem killed!&#8221;
  Plunged to the hilt in what had once been the breast of a living  being, the boys saw a long, heavy-bladed knife, its handle rotting with  age, its edges eaten by rust&#8212;but still erect, held there by the  murderous road its owner had cleft for it through the flesh and bone of  his victim.
  Rod, who had fallen upon his knees, gazed up blankly; his jaw  dropped, and he asked the first question that popped into his head.
  &#8220;Who&#8212;did it?&#8221;
  Mukoki chuckled, almost gleefully, and nodded toward the gruesome  thing reclining against the wall.
  &#8220;Heem!&#8221;
  Moved by a common instinct the three drew near the other skeleton.  One of its long arms was resting across what had once been a pail, but  which, long since, had sunk into total collapse between its hoops. The  finger-bones of this arm were still tightly shut, clutching between  them a roll of something that looked like birch-bark. The remaining arm  had fallen close to the skeleton's side, and it was on this side that  Mukoki's critical eyes searched most carefully, his curiosity being  almost immediately satisfied by the discovery of a short, slant-wise  cut in one of the ribs.
  &#8220;This un die here!&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Git um stuck knife in ribs. Bad  way die! Much hurt&#8212;no die quick, sometime. Ver' bad way git stuck!&#8221;
  &#8220;Ugh!&#8221; shuddered Rod. &#8220;This cabin hasn't had any fresh air in it for  a century, I'll bet. Let's get out!&#8221;
  Mukoki, in passing, picked up a skull from the heap of bones near  the chair.
  &#8220;Dog!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;Door lock'&#8212;window shut&#8212;men fight&#8212;both kill.  Dog starve!&#8221;
  As the three retraced their steps to the spot where Wolf was  guarding the toboggan, Rod's imaginative mind quickly painted a picture  of the terrible tragedy that had occurred long ago in the old cabin. To  Mukoki and Wabigoon the discovery of the skeletons was simply an  incident in a long life of wilderness adventure&#8212;something of passing  interest, but of small importance. To Rod it was the most tragic event  that had ever come into his city-bound existence, with the exception of  the thrilling conflict at Wabinosh House. He reconstructed that deadly  hour in the cabin; saw the men in fierce altercation, saw them  struggling, and almost heard the fatal blows as they were struck&#8212;the  blows that slew one with the suddenness of a lightning bolt and sent  the other, triumphant but dying, to breathe his last moments with his  back propped against the wall. And the dog! What part had he taken? And  after that&#8212;long days of maddening loneliness, days of starvation and  of thirst, until he, too, doubled himself up on the floor and died. It  was a terrible, a thrilling picture that burned in Roderick's brain.  But why had they quarreled? What cause had there been for that  sanguinary night duel? Instinctively Rod accepted it as having occurred  at night, for the door had been locked, the window barred. Just then he  would have given a good deal to have had the mystery solved.
  At the top of the hill Rod awoke to present realities. Wabi, who had  harnessed himself to the toboggan, was in high spirits.
  &#8220;That cabin is a dandy!&#8221; he exclaimed as Rod joined him. &#8220;It would  have taken us at least two weeks to build as good a one. Isn't it  luck?&#8221;
  &#8220;We're going to live in it?&#8221; inquired his companion.
  &#8220;Live in it! I should say we were. It is three times as big as the  shack we had planned to build. I can't understand why two men like  those fellows should have put up such a large cabin. What do you think,  Mukoki?&#8221;
  Mukoki shook his head. Evidently the mystery of the whole thing,  beyond the fact that the tenants of the cabin had killed themselves in  battle, was beyond his comprehension.
  The winter outfit was soon in a heap beside the cabin door.
  &#8220;Now for cleaning up,&#8221; announced Wabi cheerfully. &#8220;Muky, you lend me  a hand with the bones, will you? Rod can nose around and fetch out  anything he likes.&#8221;
  This assignment just suited Rod's curiosity. He was now worked up to  a feverish pitch of expectancy. Might he not discover some clue that  would lead to a solution of the mystery?
  One question alone seemed to ring incessantly in his head. Why had  they fought?<I> Why had they fought?</I>
  He even found himself repeating this under his breath as he began  rummaging about. He kicked over the old chair, which was made of  saplings nailed together, scrutinized a heap of rubbish that crumbled  to dust under his touch, and gave a little cry of exultation when he  found two guns leaning in a corner of the cabin. Their stocks were  decaying; their locks were encased with rust, their barrels, too, were  thick with the accumulated rust of years. Carefully, almost tenderly,  he took one of these relics of a past age in his hands. It was of  ancient pattern, almost as long as he was tall.
  &#8220;Hudson Bay gun&#8212;the kind they had before my father was born!&#8221; said  Wabi.
  With bated breath and eagerly beating heart Rod pursued his search.  On one of the walls he found the remains of what had once been  garments&#8212;part of a hat, that fell in a thousand pieces when he touched  it; the dust-rags of a coat and other things that he could not name. On  the table there were rusty pans, a tin pail, an iron kettle, and the  remains of old knives, forks and spoons. On one end of this table there  was an unusual-looking object, and he touched it. Unlike the other rags  it did not crumble, and when he lifted it he found that it was a small  bag, made of buckskin, tied at the end&#8212;and heavy! With trembling  fingers he tore away the rotted string and out upon the table there  rattled a handful of greenish-black, pebbly looking objects.
  Rod gave a sharp quick cry for the others.
  Wabi and Mukoki had just come through the door after bearing out one  of their gruesome loads, and the young Indian hurried to his side. He  weighed one of the pieces in the palm of his hand.
  &#8220;It's lead, or&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Gold!&#8221; breathed Rod.
  He could hear his own heart thumping as Wabi jumped back to the  light of the door, his sheath-knife in his hand. For an instant the  keen blade sank into the age-discolored object, and before Rod could  see into the crease that it made Wabi's voice rose in an excited cry.
  &#8220;It's a gold nugget!&#8221;
  &#8220;And<I> that's</I> why they fought!&#8221; exclaimed Rod exultantly.
  He had hoped&#8212;and he had discovered the reason. For a few moments  this was of more importance to him than the fact that he had found  gold. Wabi and Mukoki were now in a panic of excitement. The buckskin  bag was turned inside out; the table was cleared of every other object;  every nook and cranny was searched with new enthusiasm. The searchers  hardly spoke. Each was intent upon finding&#8212;finding&#8212;finding. Thus does  gold&#8212;virgin gold&#8212;stir up the sparks of that latent, feverish fire  which is in every man's soul. Again Rod joined in the search. Every  rag, every pile of dust, every bit of unrecognizable debris was torn,  sifted and scattered. At the end of an hour the three paused,  hopelessly baffled, even keenly disappointed for the time.
  &#8220;I guess that's all there is,&#8221; said Wabi.
  It was the longest sentence that he had spoken for half an hour.
  &#8220;There is only one thing to do, boys. We'll clean out everything  there is in the cabin, and to-morrow we'll tear up the floor. You can't  tell what there might be under it, and we've got to have a new floor  anyway. It is getting dusk, and if we have this place fit to sleep in  to-night we have got to hustle.&#8221;
  No time was lost in getting the debris of the cabin outside, and by  the time darkness had fallen a mass of balsam boughs had been spread  upon the log floor just inside the door, blankets were out, packs and  supplies stowed away in one corner, and everything &#8220;comfortable and  shipshape,&#8221; as Rod expressed it. A huge fire was built a few feet away  from the open door and the light and heat from this made the interior  of the cabin quite light and warm, and, with the assistance of a couple  of candles, more home-like than any camp they had slept in thus far.  Mukoki's supper was a veritable feast&#8212;broiled caribou, cold beans that  the old Indian had cooked at their last camp, meal cakes and hot  coffee. The three happy hunters ate of it as though they had not tasted  food for a week.
  The day, though a hard one, had been fraught with too much  excitement for them to retire to their blankets immediately after this  meal, as they had usually done in other camps. They realized, too, that  they had reached the end of their journey and that their hardest work  was over. There was no long jaunt ahead of them to-morrow. Their new  life&#8212;the happiest life in the world to them&#8212;had already begun. Their  camp was established, they were ready for their winter's sport, and  from this moment on they felt that their evenings were their own to do  with as they pleased.
  So for many hours that night Rod, Mukoki and Wabigoon sat up and  talked and kept the fire roaring before the door. Twenty times they  went over the tragedy of the old cabin; twenty times they weighed the  half-pound of precious little lumps in the palms of their hands, and  bit by bit they built up that life romance of the days of long ago,  when all this wilderness was still an unopened book to the white man.  And that story seemed very clear to them now. These men had been  prospectors. They had discovered gold. Afterward they had quarreled,  probably over some division of it&#8212;perhaps over the ownership of the  very nuggets they had found; and then, in the heat of their anger, had  followed the knife battle.
  But where had they discovered the gold? That was the question of  supreme interest to the hunters, and they debated it until midnight.  There were no mining tools in the camp; no pick, shovel or pan. Then it  occurred to them that the builders of the cabin had been hunters, had  discovered gold by accident and had collected that in the buckskin bag  without the use of a pan.
  There was little sleep in the camp that night, and with the first  light of day the three were at work again. Immediately after breakfast  the task of tearing up the old and decayed floor began. One by one the  split saplings were pried up and carried out for firewood, until the  earth floor lay bare. Every foot of it was now eagerly turned over with  a shovel which had been brought in the equipment; the base-logs were  undermined, and filled in again; the moss that had been packed in the  chinks between the cabin timbers was dug out, and by noon there was not  a square inch of the interior of the camp that had not been searched.
  There was no more gold.
  In a way this fact brought relief with it. Both Wabi and Rod  gradually recovered from their nervous excitement. The thought of gold  gradually faded from their minds; the joy and exhilaration of the &#8220;hunt  life&#8221; filled them more and more. Mukoki set to work cutting fresh  cedars for the floor; the two boys scoured every log with water from  the lake and afterward gathered several bushels of moss for refilling  the chinks. That evening supper was cooked on the sheet-iron &#8220;section  stove&#8221; which they had brought on the toboggan, and which was set up  where the ancient stove of flat stones had tumbled into ruin. By  candle-light the work of &#8220;rechinking&#8221; with moss progressed rapidly.  Wabi was constantly bursting into snatches of wild Indian song, Rod  whistled until his throat was sore and Mukoki chuckled and grunted and  talked with constantly increasing volubility. A score of times they  congratulated one another upon their good luck. Eight wolf-scalps, a  fine lynx and nearly two hundred dollars in gold&#8212;all within their  first week! It was enough to fill them with enthusiasm and they made  little effort to repress their joy.
  During this evening Mukoki boiled up a large pot of caribou fat and  bones, and when Rod asked what kind of soup he was making he responded  by picking up a handful of steel traps and dropping them into the  mixture.
  &#8220;Make traps smell good for fox&#8212;wolf&#8212;fisher, an' marten, too; heem  come&#8212;all come&#8212;like smell,&#8221; he explained.
  &#8220;If you don't dip the traps,&#8221; added Wabi, &#8220;nine fur animals out of  ten, and wolves most of all, will fight shy of the bait. They can smell  the human odor you leave on the steel when you handle it. But the  grease 'draws' them.&#8221;
  When the hunters wrapped themselves in their blankets that night  their wilderness home was complete. All that remained to be done was  the building of three bunks against the ends of the cabin, and this  work it was agreed could be accomplished at odd hours by any one who  happened to be in camp. In the morning, laden with traps, they would  strike out their first hunting-trails, keeping their eyes especially  open for signs of wolves; for Mukoki was the greatest wolf hunter in  all the Hudson Bay region.
