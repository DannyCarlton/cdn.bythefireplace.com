  To the cabin Kent groped his way, and knocked, and it was Marette   who opened the door for him and stepped back for him to enter.  Like a  great wet dog he came in, doubling until his hands almost  touched the  floor. He sensed the incongruity of it, the  misplacement of his  overgrown body in this playhouse thing, and he  grinned through the  trickles of wet that ran down his face, and  tried to see. Marette had  taken off her turban and rain-coat, and  she, too, stooped low in the  four-feet space of the cabin&#8212;but not  so ridiculously low as Kent. He  dropped on his knees again. And  then he saw that in the tiny stove a  fire was burning. The crackle  of it rose above the beat of the rain on  the roof, and the air was  already mellowing with the warmth of it. He  looked at Marette. Her  wet hair was still clinging to her face, her  feet and arms and  part of her body were wet; but her eyes were  shining, and she was  smiling at him. She seemed to him, in this  moment, like a child  that was glad it had found refuge. He had thought  that the terror  of the night would show in her face, but it was gone.  She was not  thinking of the thunder and the lightning, the black  trail, or of  Kedsty lying dead in his bungalow. She was thinking of  him. 
  He laughed outright. It was a joyous, thrilling thing, this black   night with the storm over their heads and the roll of the great  river  under them&#8212;they two&#8212;alone&#8212;in this cockleshell cabin that  was not  high enough to stand in and scarcely big enough in any  direction to  turn round in. The snug cheer of it, the warmth of  the fire beginning  to reach their chilled bodies, and the  inspiring crackle of the birch  in the little stove filled Kent,  for a space, with other thoughts than  those of the world they were  leaving. And Marette, whose eyes and lips  were smiling at him  softly in the candle-glow, seemed also to have  forgotten. It was  the little window that brought them back to the  tragedy of their  flight. Kent visioned it as it must look from the  shore&#8212;a  telltale blotch of light traveling through the darkness.  There  were occasional cabins for several miles below the Landing, and   eyes turned riverward in the storm might see it. He made his way  to  the window and fastened his slicker over it. 
  &quot;We're off, Gray Goose,&quot; he said then, rubbing his hands. &quot;Would   it seem more homelike if I smoked?&quot; 
  She nodded, her eyes on the slicker at the window. 
  &quot;It's pretty safe,&quot; said Kent, fishing out his pipe, and beginning   to fill it. &quot;Everybody asleep, probably. But we won't take any   chances.&quot; The scow was swinging sideways in the current. Kent felt   the change in its movement, and added: &quot;No danger of being  wrecked,  either. There isn't a rock or rapids for thirty miles.  River clear as  a floor. If we bump ashore, don't get frightened.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm not afraid&#8212;of the river,&quot; she said. Then, with rather   startling unexpectedness, she asked him, &quot;Where will they look for  us  tomorrow?&quot; 
  Kent lighted his pipe, eyeing her a bit speculatively as she   seated herself on the stool, leaning toward him as she waited for  an  answer to her question. 
  &quot;The woods, the river, everywhere,&quot; he said. &quot;They'll look for a   missing boat, of course. We've simply got to watch behind us and  take  advantage of a good start.&quot; 
  &quot;Will the rain wipe out our footprints, Jeems?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. Everything in the open.&quot; 
  &quot;But&#8212;perhaps&#8212;in a sheltered place&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;We were in no sheltered place,&quot; he assured her. &quot;Can you remember   that we were, Gray Goose?&quot; 
  She shook her head slowly. &quot;No. But there was Mooie, under the   window.&quot; 
  &quot;His footprints will be wiped out.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad. I would not have him, or M'sieu Fingers, or any of our   friends brought into this trouble.&quot; 
  She made no effort to hide the relief his words brought her. He   was a little amazed that she should worry over Fingers and the old   Indian in this hour of their own peril. That danger he had decided  to  keep as far from her mind as possible. But she could not help   realizing the impending menace of it. She must know that within a  few  hours Kedsty would be found, and the long arm of the  wilderness police  would begin its work. And if it caught them&#8212; 
  She had thrust her feet toward him and was wriggling them inside   her boots, so that he heard the slushing sound of water. &quot;Ugh, but   they are wet!&quot; she shivered. &quot;Will you unlace them and pull them  off  for me, Jeems?&quot; 
  He laid his pipe aside and knelt close to her. It took him five   minutes to get the boots off. Then he held one of her sodden  little  feet close between his two big hands. 
  &quot;Cold&#8212;cold as ice,&quot; he said. &quot;You must take off your stockings,   Marette. Please.&quot; 
  He arranged a pile of wood in front of the stove and covered it   with a blanket which he pulled from one of the bunks. Then, still  on  his knees, he drew the cane chair close to the fire and covered  it  with a second blanket. A few moments later Marette was tucked   comfortably in this chair, with her bare feet on the blanketed  pile  of wood. Kent opened the stove door. Then he extinguished one  of the  smoking candles, and after that, the other. The flaming  birch  illumined the little cabin with a mellower light. It gave a  subdued  flush to the girl's face. Her eyes seemed to Kent  wonderfully soft and  beautiful in that changed light. And when he  had finished, she reached  out a hand, and for an instant it  touched his face and his wet hair so  lightly that he sensed the  thrilling caress of it without feeling its  weight. 
  &quot;You are so good to me, Jeems,&quot; she said, and he thought there was   a little choking note in her throat. 
  He had seated himself on the floor, close to her chair, with his   back to the wall. &quot;It is because I love you, Gray Goose,&quot; he  replied  quietly, looking straight into the fire. 
  She was silent. She, too, was looking into the fire. Close over   their heads they heard the beating of the rain, like a thousand  soft  little fists pounding the top of the cabin. Under them they  could feel  the slow swinging of the scow as it responded to the  twists and  vagaries of the current that was carrying them on. And  Kent, unseen by  the girl who was looking away from him, raised his  eyes. The birch  light was glowing in her hair; it trembled on her  white throat; her  long lashes were caught in the shimmer of it.  And, looking at her,  Kent thought of Kedsty lying back in his  bungalow room, choked to  death by a tress of that glorious hair,  so near to him now that, by  leaning a little forward, he might  have touched it with his lips. The  thought brought him no horror.  For even as he looked, one of her hands  crept up to her cheek&#8212;the  small, soft hand that had touched his face  and hair as lightly as  a bit of thistle-down&#8212;and he knew that two  hands like that could  not have killed a man who was fighting for life  when he died. 
  And Kent reached up, and took the hand, and held it close in his   own, as he said, &quot;Little Gray Goose, please tell me now&#8212;what   happened in Kedsty's room?&quot; 
  His voice thrilled with an immeasurable faith. He wanted her to   know, no matter what had happened, that this faith and his love  for  her could not be shaken. He believed in her, and would always  believe  in her. 
  Already he was sure that he knew how Kedsty had died. The picture   of the tragedy had pieced itself together in his mind, bit by bit.   While he slept, Marette and a man were down in the big room with  the  Inspector of Police. The climax had come, and Kedsty was  struck a  blow&#8212;in some unaccountable way&#8212;with his own gun. Then,  just as  Kedsty was recovering sufficiently from the shock of the  blow to  fight, Marette's companion had killed him. Horrified,  dazed by what  had already happened, perhaps unconscious, she had  been powerless to  prevent the use of a tress of her hair in the  murderer's final work.  Kent, in this picture, eliminated the boot-  laces and the curtain  cords. He knew that the unusual and the  least expected happened  frequently in crime. And Marette's long  hair was flowing loose about  her. To use it had simply been the  first inspiration of the murderer.  And Kent believed, as he waited  for her answer now, that Marette would  tell him this. 
  And as he waited, he felt her fingers tighten in his hand. 
  &quot;Tell me, Gray Goose&#8212;what happened?&quot; 
  &quot;I&#8212;don't&#8212;know&#8212;Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  His eyes went to her suddenly from the fire, as if he was not   quite sure he had heard what she had said. She did not move her  head,  but continued to gaze unseeingly into the flames. Inside his  palm her  fingers worked to his thumb and held it tightly again, as  they had  clung to it when she was frightened by the thunder and  lightning. 
  &quot;I don't know what happened, Jeems.&quot; 
  This time he did not feel the clinging thrill of her little   fingers and soft palm. Deep within him he experienced something  that  was like a sudden and unexpected blow. He was ready to fight  for her  until his last breath was gone. He was ready to believe  anything she  told him&#8212;anything except this impossible thing which  she had just  spoken. For she did know what had happened in  Kedsty's room. She  knew&#8212;unless&#8212; 
  Suddenly his heart leaped with joyous hope. &quot;You mean&#8212;you were   unconscious?&quot; he cried in a low voice that trembled with his   eagerness. &quot;You fainted&#8212;and it happened then?&quot; 
  She shook her head. &quot;No. I was asleep in my room. I didn't intend   to sleep, but&#8212;I did. Something awakened me. I thought I had been   dreaming. But something kept pulling me, pulling me downstairs.  And  when I went, I found Kedsty like that. He was dead. I was  paralyzed,  standing there, when you came.&quot; 
  She drew her, hand away from him, gently, but significantly. &quot;I   know you can't believe me, Jeems. It is impossible for you to  believe  me.&quot; 
  &quot;And you don't want me to believe you, Marette.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;I do. You must believe me.&quot; 
  &quot;But the tress of hair&#8212;your hair&#8212;round Kedsty's neck&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped. His words, spoken gently as they were, seemed brutal   to him. Yet he could not see that they affected her. She did not   flinch. He saw no tremor of horror. Steadily she continued to look   into the fire. And his brain grew confused. Never in all his   experience had he seen such absolute and unaffected self-control.  And  somehow, it chilled him. It chilled him even as he wanted to  reach out  and gather her close in his arms, and pour his love into  her ears,  entreating her to tell him everything, to keep nothing  back from him  that might help in the fight he was going to make. 
  And then she said, &quot;Jeems, if we should be caught by the Police&#8212;   it would probably be quite soon, wouldn't it?&quot; 
  &quot;They won't catch us.&quot; 
  &quot;But our greatest danger of being caught is right now, isn't it?&quot;   she insisted. 
  Kent took out his watch and leaned over to look at it in the   fireglow. &quot;It is three o'clock,&quot; he said. &quot;Give me another day and   night, Gray Goose, and the Police will never find us.&quot; 
  For a moment or two more she was silent. Then her hand reached   out, and her fingers twined softly round his thumb again. &quot;Jeems&#8212;   when we are safe&#8212;when we are sure the Police won't find us&#8212;I  will  tell you all that I know&#8212;about what happened in Kedsty's  room. And I  will tell you&#8212;about&#8212;the hair. I will tell you&#8212;  everything.&quot; Her  fingers tightened almost fiercely. &quot;Everything,&quot;  she repeated. &quot;I will  tell you about that in Kedsty's room&#8212;and I  will tell you about  myself&#8212;and after that&#8212;I am afraid&#8212;you won't  like me.&quot; 
  &quot;I love you,&quot; he said, making no movement to touch her. &quot;No matter   what you tell me, Gray Goose, I shall love you.&quot; 
  She gave a little cry, scarcely more than a broken note in her   throat, and Kent&#8212;had her face been turned toward him then&#8212;would   have seen the glory that came into it, and into her eyes, like a   swift flash of light&#8212;and passed as swiftly away. 
  What he did see, when she turned her head, were eyes caught   suddenly by something at the cabin door. He looked. Water was   trickling in slowly over the sill. 
  &quot;I expected that,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;Our scow is turning into a   rain-barrel, Marette. Unless I bail out, we'll soon be flooded.&quot; 
  He reached for his slicker and put it on. &quot;It won't take me long   to throw the water overboard,&quot; he added. &quot;And while I'm doing that  I  want you to take OFF your wet things and tuck yourself into bed.  Will  you, Gray Goose?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm not tired, but if you think it is best&#8212;&quot; Her hand touched   his arm. 
  &quot;It is best,&quot; he said, and for a moment he bent over her until his   lips touched her hair. 
  Then he seized a pail, and went out into the rain.
