  Beyond the door Howland heard Jean pause. There followed a few  moments silence, as though the other were listening for sound within.  Then there came a fumbling at the bar and the door swung inward.
  &#8220;<I>Bon jour</I>, M'seur,&#8221; called Jean's cheerful voice as he  stepped inside. &#8220;Is it possible you are not up, with all this  dog-barking and&#8212;&#8221;
  His eyes had gone to the empty bunk. Despite his cheerful greeting  Howland saw that the Frenchman's face was haggard and pale as he turned  quickly toward him. He observed no further than that, but flung his  whole weight on the unprepared Croisset, and together they crashed to  the floor. There was scarce a struggle and Jean lay still. He was flat  on his back, his arms pinioned to his sides, and bringing himself  astride the Frenchman's body so that each knee imprisoned an arm  Howland coolly began looping the babeesh thongs that he had snatched  from the table as he sprang to the door. Behind Howland's back Jean's  legs shot suddenly upward. In a quick choking clutch of steel-like  muscle they gripped about his neck like powerful arms and in another  instant he was twisted backward with a force that sent him half  neck-broken to the opposite wall. He staggered to his feet, dazed for a  moment, and Jean Croisset stood in the middle of the floor, his caribou  skin coat thrown off, his hands clenched, his eyes darkening with a  dangerous fire. As quickly as it had come, the fire died away, and as  he advanced slowly, his shoulders punched over, his white teeth gleamed  in a smile. Howland smiled back, and advanced to meet him. There was no  humor, no friendliness in the smiles. Both had seen that flash of teeth  and deadly scintillation of eyes at other times, both knew what it  meant.
  &#8220;I believe that I will kill you, M'seur,&#8221; said Jean softly. There  was no excitement, no tremble of passion in his voice. &#8220;I have been  thinking that I ought to kill you. I had almost made up my mind to kill  you when I came back to this<I> Maison de Mort Rouge</I>. It is the  justice of God that I kill you!&#8221;
  The two men circled, like beasts in a pit, Howland in the attitude  of a boxer, Jean with his shoulders bent, his arms slightly curved at  his side, the toes of his moccasined feet bearing his weight. Suddenly  he launched himself at the other's throat.
  In a flash Howland stepped a little to one side and shot out a  crashing blow that caught Jean on the side of the head and sent him  flat on his back. Half-stunned Croisset came to his feet. It was the  first time that he had ever come into contact with science. He was  puzzled. His head rang, and for a few moments he was dizzy. He darted  in again, in his old, quick, cat-like way, and received a blow that  dazed him. This time he kept his feet.
  &#8220;I am sure now that I am going to kill you, M'seur,&#8221; he said, as  coolly as before.
  There was something terribly calm and decisive in his voice. He was  not excited. He was not afraid. His fingers did not go near the weapons  in his belt, and slowly the smile faded from Howland's lips as Jean  circled about him. He had never fought a man of this kind; never had he  looked on the appalling confidence that was in his antagonist's eyes.  From those eyes, rather than from the man, he found himself slowly  retreating. They followed him, never taking themselves from his face.  In them the fire returned and grew deeper. Two dull red spots began to  glow in Croisset's cheeks, and he laughed softly when he suddenly  leaped in so that Howland struck at him&#8212;and missed. He knew what to  expect now. And Howland knew what to expect.
  It was the science of one world pitted against that of another&#8212;the  science of civilization against that of the wilderness. Howland was  trained in his art. For sport Jean had played with wounded lynx; his  was the quickness of sight, of instinct&#8212;the quickness of the great  north loon that had often played this same game with his rifle-fire, of  the sledge-dog whose ripping fangs carried death so quickly that eyes  could not follow. A third and a fourth time he came within distance and  Howland struck and missed.
  &#8220;I am going to kill you,&#8221; he said again.
  To this point Howland had remained cool. Self-possession in his  science he knew to be half the battle. But he felt in him now a slow,  swelling anger. The smiling flash in Jean's eyes began to irritate him;  the fearless, taunting gleam of his teeth, his audacious confidence,  put him on edge. Twice again he struck out swiftly, but Jean had come  and gone like a dart. His lithe body, fifty pounds lighter than  Howland's, seemed to be that of a boy dodging him in some tantalizing  sport. The Frenchman made no effort at attack; his were the tactics of  the wolf at the heels of the bull moose, of the lynx before the prongs  of a cornered buck&#8212;tiring, worrying, ceaseless.
  Howland's striking muscles began to ache and his breath was growing  shorter with the exertions which seemed to have no effect on Croisset.  For a few moments he took the aggressive, rushing Jean to the stove,  behind the table, twice around the room&#8212;striving vainly to drive him  into a corner, to reach him with one of the sweeping blows which  Croisset evaded with the lightning quickness of a hell-diver. When he  stopped, his breath came in wind-broken gasps. Jean drew nearer,  smiling, ferociously cool.
  &#8220;I am going to kill you, M'seur,&#8221; he repeated again.
  Howland dropped his arms, his fingers relaxed, and he forced his  breath between his lips as if he were on the point of exhaustion. There  were still a few tricks in his science, and these, he knew, were about  his last cards. He backed into a corner, and Jean followed, his eyes  flashing a steely light, his body growing more and more tense.
  &#8220;Now, M'seur, I am going to kill you,&#8221; he said in the same low  voice. &#8220;I am going to break your neck.&#8221;
  Howland backed against the wall, partly turned as if fearing the  other's attack, and yet without strength to repel it. There was a  contemptuous smile on Croisset's lips as he poised himself for an  instant. Then he leaped in, and as his fingers gripped at the other's  throat Howland's right arm shot upward in a deadly short-arm punch that  caught his antagonist under the jaw. Without a sound Jean staggered  back, tottered for a moment on his feet, and fell to the floor. Fifty  seconds later he opened his eyes to find his hands bound behind his  back and Howland standing at his feet.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, but that was a good one!&#8221; he gasped, after he had  taken a long breath or two. &#8220;Will you teach it to me, M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;Get up!&#8221; commanded Howland. &#8220;I have no time to waste, Croisset.&#8221; He  caught the Frenchman by the shoulders and helped him to a chair near  the table. Then he took possession of the other's weapons, including  the revolver which Jean had taken from him, and began to dress. He  spoke no word until he was done.
  &#8220;Do you understand what is going to happen Croisset?&#8221; he cried then,  his eyes blazing hotly. &#8220;Do you understand that what you have done will  put you behind prison bars for ten years or more? Does it dawn on you  that I'm going to take you back to the authorities, and that as soon as  we reach the Wekusko I'll have twenty men back on the trail of these  friends of yours?&#8221;
  A gray pallor spread itself over Jean's thin face.
  &#8220;The great God, M'seur, you can not do that!&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Can not!</I>&#8221; Howland's fingers dug into the edge of the table.  &#8220;By this great God of yours, Croisset, but I will! And why not? Is it  because Meleese is among this gang of cut-throats and murderers? Pish,  my dear Jean, you must be a fool. They tried to kill me on the trail,  tried it again in the coyote, and you came back here determined to kill  me. You've held the whip-hand from the first. Now it's mine. I swear  that if I take you back to the Wekusko we'll get you all.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>If</I>, M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;<I>if</I>.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that 'if'&#8212;&#8221; Jean was straining against the table.
  &#8220;It rests with you, Croisset. I will bargain with you. Either I  shall take you back to the Wekusko, hand you over to the authorities  and send a force after the others&#8212;or you shall take me to Meleese.  Which shall it be?&#8221;
  &#8220;And if I take you to Meleese, M'seur?&#8221;
  Howland straightened, his voice trembling a little with excitement.
  &#8220;If you take me to Meleese, and swear to do as I say, I shall bring  no harm to you or your friends.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Meleese&#8212;&#8221; Jean's eyes darkened again, &#8220;You will not harm her,  M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;Harm<I> her</I>!&#8221; There was a laughing tremor in Howland's voice.  &#8220;Good God, man, are you so blind that you can't see that I am doing  this because of her? I tell you that I love her, and that I am willing  to die in fighting for her. Until now I haven't had the chance. You and  your friends have played a cowardly underhand game, Croisset. You have  taken me from behind at every move, and now it's up to you to square  yourself a little or there's going to be hell to pay. Understand? You  take me to Meleese or there'll be a clean-up that will put you and the  whole bunch out of business.<I> Harm her</I>&#8212;&#8221; Again Howland laughed,  leaning his white face toward Jean. &#8220;Come, which shall it be,  Croisset?&#8221;
  A cold glitter, like the snap of sparks from striking steels, shot  from the Frenchman's eyes. The grayish pallor went from his face. His  teeth gleamed in the enigmatic smile that had half undone Howland in  the fight.
  &#8220;You are mistaken in some things, M'seur,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Until  to-day I have fought for you and not against you. But now you have left  me but one choice. I will take you to Meleese, and that means&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Howland.
  &#8220;La, la, M'seur&#8212;not so good as you think. It means that as surely  as the dogs carry us there you will never come back.<I> Mon Dieu,</I>  your death is certain!&#8221;
  Howland turned briskly to the stove.
  &#8220;Hungry, Jean?&#8221; he asked more companionably. &#8220;Let's not quarrel,  man. You've had your fun, and now I'm going to have mine. Have you had  breakfast?&#8221;
  &#8220;I was anticipating that pleasure with you, M'seur,&#8221; replied Jean  with grim humor.
  &#8220;And then&#8212;after I had fed you&#8212;you were going to kill me, my dear  Jean,&#8221; laughed Howland, flopping a huge caribou steak on the naked top  of the sheet-iron stove. &#8220;Real nice fellow you are, eh?&#8221;
  &#8220;You ought to be killed, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;So you've said before. When I see Meleese I'm going to know the  reason why, or&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Or what, M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;Kill you, Jean. I've just about made up my mind that you ought to  be killed. If any one dies up where we're going, Croisset, it will be  you first of all.&#8221;
  Jean remained silent. A few minutes later Howland brought the  caribou steak, a dish of flour cakes and a big pot of coffee to the  table. Then he went behind Jean and untied his hands. When he sat down  at his own side of the table he cocked his revolver and placed it  beside his tin plate. Jean grimaced and shrugged his shoulders.
  &#8220;It means business,&#8221; said his captor warningly. &#8220;If at any time I  think you deserve it I shall shoot you in your tracks, Croisset, so  don't arouse my suspicions.&#8221;
  &#8220;I took your word of honor,&#8221; said Jean sarcastically.
  &#8220;And I will take yours to an extent,&#8221; replied Howland, pouring the  coffee. Suddenly he picked up the revolver. &#8220;You never saw me shoot,  did you? See that cup over there?&#8221; He pointed to a small tin pack-cup  hanging to a nail on the wall a dozen paces from them. Three times  without missing he drove bullets through it, and smiled across at  Croisset.
  &#8220;I am going to give you the use of your arms and legs, except at  night,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, it is safe,&#8221; grunted Jean. &#8220;I give you my word  that I will be good, M'seur.&#8221;
  The sun was up when Croisset led the way outside. His dogs and  sledge were a hundred yards from the building, and Howland's first move  was to take possession of the Frenchman's rifle and eject the  cartridges while Jean tossed chunks of caribou flesh to the huskies.  When they were ready to start Jean turned slowly and half reached out a  mittened hand to the engineer.
  &#8220;M'seur,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;I can not help liking you, though I know  that I should have killed you long ago. I tell you again that if you go  into the North there is only one chance in a hundred that you will come  back alive. Great God, M'seur, up where you wish to go the very trees  will fall on you and the carrion ravens pick, out your eyes! And that  chance&#8212;that one chance in a hundred, M'seur&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I will take,&#8221; interrupted Howland decisively.
  &#8220;I was going to say, M'seur,&#8221; finished Jean quietly, &#8220;that unless  accident has befallen those who left Wekusko yesterday that one chance  is gone. If you go South you are safe. If you go into the North you are  no better than a dead man.&#8221;
  &#8220;There will at least be a little fun at the finish,&#8221; laughed the  young engineer. &#8220;Come, Jean, hit up the dogs!&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, I say you are a fool&#8212;and a brave man,&#8221; said  Croisset, and his whip twisted sinuously in mid-air and cracked in  sharp command over the yellow backs of the huskies.
