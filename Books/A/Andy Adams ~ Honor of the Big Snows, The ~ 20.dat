  During the week that followed, Jean's little black eyes were never  far  distant from Cummins' cabin. Without being observed, he watched   M&eacute;lisse and Dixon, and not even to Iowaka did he give hint of his   growing suspicions. Dixon was a man whom most other men liked. There   were a fascinating frankness in his voice and manner, strength in his   broad shoulders, and a general air of comradeship about him which won   all but Jean. 
  The trap-line runners began leaving the post at the end of the  second  week, and after this M&eacute;lisse and the young Englishman were more   together than ever. Dixon showed no inclination to accompany the   sledges, and when they were gone he and M&eacute;lisse began taking walks in   the forest, when the sun was high and warm. 
  It was on one of these days that Jean had gone along the edge of  the  caribou swamp that lay between the barrens and the higher forest.  As  he stopped to examine a fresh lynx trail that cut across the path   beaten down by dog and sledge, he heard the sound of voices ahead of   him; and a moment later he recognized them as those of M&eacute;lisse and   Dixon. His face clouded, and his eyes snapped fire. 
  &quot;Ah, if I was only Jan Thoreau&#8212;a Jan Thoreau with the heart of  Jean  de Gravois&#8212;what a surprise I'd give that foreigner!&quot; he said to   himself, leaping quickly from the trail into the thicket. 
  He peered forth from the bushes, his loyal heart beating a wrathful   tattoo when he saw that Dixon dared put his hand on M&eacute;lisse's arm.   They were coming very slowly, the Englishman bending low over the   girl's bowed head, talking to her with strange earnestness. Suddenly   he stopped, and before Jean could comprehend what had happened he had   bent down and kissed her. 
  With a low cry, M&eacute;lisse tore herself free. For an instant she faced   Dixon, who stood laughing into her blazing eyes. Then she turned and   ran swiftly down the trail. 
  A second cry fell from her startled lips when she found herself  face  to face with Jean de Gravois. The little Frenchman was smiling.  His  eyes glittered like black diamonds. 
  &quot;Jean, Jean!&quot; she sobbed, running to him. 
  &quot;He has insulted you,&quot; he said softly, smiling into her white face.   &quot;Run along to the post, ma belle M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  He watched her, half turned from the astonished Englishman, until  she  disappeared in a twist of the trail a hundred yards away. Then he   faced Dixon. 
  &quot;It is the first time that our M&eacute;lisse has ever suffered insult,&quot;  he  said, speaking as coolly as if to a child. &quot;If Jan Thoreau were  here,  he would kill you. He is gone, and I will kill you in his  place!&quot; 
  He advanced, his white teeth still gleaming in a smile, and not  until  he launched himself like a cat at Dixon's throat was the  Englishman  convinced that he meant attack. In a flash Dixon stepped a  little to  one side, and sent out a crashing blow that caught Jean on  the side of  the head and sent him flat upon his back in the trail. 
  Half stunned, Gravois came to his feet. He did not hear the shrill  cry  of terror from the twist in the trail. He did not look back to see   M&eacute;lisse standing there. But Dixon both saw and heard, and he laughed   tauntingly over Jean's head as the little Frenchman came toward him   again, more cautiously than before. 
  It was the first time that Jean had ever come into contact with   science. He darted in again, in his quick, cat-like way, and received   a blow that dazed him. This time he held to his feet. 
  &quot;Bah, this is like striking a baby!&quot; exclaimed Dixon. &quot;What are you   fighting about, Gravois? Is it a crime up here to kiss a pretty girl?&quot; 
  &quot;I am going to kill you!&quot; said Jean as coolly as before. 
  There was something terribly calm and decisive in his voice. He was   not excited. He was not afraid. His fingers did not go near the long   knife in his belt. Slowly the laugh faded from Dixon's face, and tense   lines gathered around his mouth as Jean circled about him. 
  &quot;Come, we don't want trouble like this,&quot; he urged. &quot;I'm sorry&#8212;if   M&eacute;lisse didn't like it.&quot; 
  &quot;I am going to kill you!&quot; repeated Jean. 
  There was an appalling confidence in his eyes. From those eyes  Dixon  found himself retreating rather than from the man. They followed  him,  never taking themselves from his face. The fire in them grew  deeper.  Two dull red spots began to glow in Jean's cheeks, and he  laughed  softly when he suddenly leaped in so that the Englishman  struck at  him&#8212;and missed. 
  It was the science of the forest man pitted against that of another   world. For sport Jean had played with wounded lynx; his was the   quickness of sight, of instinct&#8212;without the other's science; the   quickness of the great loon that had often played this same game with   his rifle-fire, of the sledge-dog whose ripping fangs carried death so   quickly that eyes could not follow. 
  A third and a fourth time he came within striking distance, and   escaped. He half drew his knife, and at the movement Dixon sprang back   until his shoulders touched the brush. Smilingly Gravois unsheathed   the blade and tossed it behind him in the trail. His eyes were like a   serpent's in their steadiness, and the muscles of his body were drawn   as tight as steel springs, ready to loose themselves when the chance   came. 
  There were tricks in his fighting as well as in the other's, and a   dawning of it began to grow upon Dixon. He dropped his arms to his   side, inviting Jean within reach. Suddenly the little Frenchman   straightened. His glittering eyes shot from the Englishman's face to   the brush behind him, and a piercing yell burst from his lips.   Involuntarily Dixon started, half turning his face, and before he had   come to his guard Gravois flung himself under his arms, striking with   the full force of his body against his antagonist's knees. 
  Together they went down in the trail. There was only one science  now&#8212;  that of the forest man. The lithe, brown fingers, that could  have  crushed the life of a lynx, fastened themselves around the   Englishman's man's throat, and there came one gasping, quickly   throttled cry as they tightened in their neck-breaking grip. 
  &quot;I will kill you!&quot; said Jean again. 
  Dixon's arms fell limply to his side. His eyes bulged from their   sockets, his mouth was agape, but Jean did not see. His face was   buried on the other's shoulder, the whole life of him in the grip. He   would not have raised his head for a full minute longer had there not   come a sudden interruption&#8212;the terrified voice of M&eacute;lisse, the   frantic tearing of her hands at his hands. 
  &quot;He is dead!&quot; she shrieked. &quot;You have killed him, Jean!&quot; 
  He loosed his fingers and sat up. M&eacute;lisse staggered back, clutching   with her hands at her breast, her face as white as the snow. 
  &quot;You have killed him!&quot; 
  Jean looked into Dixon's eyes. 
  &quot;He is not dead,&quot; he said, rising and going to her side. &quot;Come, ma   ch&egrave;re, run home to Iowaka. I will not kill him.&quot; Her slender form   shook with agonized sobs as he led her to the turn in the trail. &quot;Run   home to Iowaka,&quot; he repeated gently. &quot;I will not kill him, M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  He went back to Dixon and rubbed snow over the man's face. 
  &quot;Mon Dieu, but it was near to it!&quot; he exclaimed, as there came a   flicker of life into the eyes. &quot;A little more, and he would have been   with the missioner!&quot; 
  He dragged the Englishman to the side of the trail, and set his  back  to a tree. When he saw that fallen foeman's breath was coming  more  strongly, he followed slowly after M&eacute;lisse. 
  Unobserved, he went into the store and washed the blood from his  face,  chuckling with huge satisfaction when he looked at himself in  the  little glass which hung over the wash-basin. 
  &quot;Ah, my sweet Iowaka, but would you guess now that Jean de Gravois  had  received two clouts on the side of the head that almost sent him  into  the blessed hereafter? I would not have had you see it for all  the  gold in this world!&quot; 
  A little later he went to the cabin. Iowaka and the children were  at  Croisset's, and he sat down to smoke a pipe. Scarce had he begun   sending up blue clouds of smoke when the door opened and M&eacute;lisse came   in. 
  &quot;Hello, ma ch&egrave;re,&quot; he cried gaily, laughing at her with a wave of  his  pipe. 
  In an instant she had flung the shawl from her head and was upon  her  knees at his feet, her white face turned up to him pleadingly, her   breath falling upon him in panting, sobbing excitement. 
  &quot;Jean, Jean!&quot; she whispered, stretching up her hands to his face.   &quot;Please tell me that you will never tell Jan&#8212;please tell me that you   never will, Jean&#8212;never, never, never!&quot; 
  &quot;I will say nothing, M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  &quot;Never, Jean?&quot; 
  &quot;Never.&quot; 
  For a sobbing breath she dropped her head upon his knees. Then,   suddenly, she drew down his face and kissed him. 
  &quot;Thank you, Jean, for what you have done!&quot; 
  &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; gasped Jean when she had gone. &quot;What if Iowaka had been   here then?&quot;
