  At the summit of the hill Walter's captors came to a halt. 
  &quot;Young man,&quot; said the leader sternly, &quot;your hours are numbered.  Have  you anything to say?&quot; 
  &quot;I have a good deal to say,&quot; answered Walter, finding his voice and   speaking indignantly. &quot;Even if I were guilty, which I am not, you have   no right to condemn me to death untried.&quot; 
  One of the masked men, who had hitherto stood in the background,  came  forward, and in clear, ringing accents spoke: 
  &quot;The lad says right. He has not been proved guilty, and I for one   believe him innocent.&quot; 
  &quot;I thank God,&quot; said Walter, &quot;that there is one among you whose  heart  is not wholly hardened. I stand here a boy&#8212;barely eighteen  years old.  Is there no one among you who has a son of my age?&quot; 
  &quot;The boy is right,&quot; said another in a deep voice. &quot;Men, we are  acting  like cowards and brutes.&quot; 
  &quot;So say I!&quot; a third man broke in, and he ranged himself beside the   other two. 
  &quot;This is all folly!&quot; exclaimed the leader angrily. &quot;You men are   milksops and chicken-hearted.&quot; Walter's face flamed. 
  &quot;Will you allow this?&quot; he exclaimed, as the leader seized him by  the  collar and drew him to a tree. 
  &quot;I won't!&quot; said the first man to pronounce in his favor. &quot;Seth   Pendleton, let go your hold!&quot; 
  &quot;Look out!&quot; cried Pendleton fiercely, &quot;or you may swing, too!&quot; 
  &quot;You hear what he says,&quot; said Walter's friend. &quot;Why are you so hard  on  the boy?&quot; 
  &quot;Why am I so hard on horse thieves? I'll tell you. Ten years ago I  had  a horse that was as dear to me as a brother. One morning I found  the  stable door open and the horse gone. I followed him, but I never   recovered him.&quot; 
  &quot;Who stole him?&quot; 
  &quot;A man named Dick Ranney, who has since become a noted highwayman.&quot; 
  This was astonishing news to Walter. 
  &quot;Do you know where Dick Ranney is now?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;I heard that he had been captured.&quot; 
  &quot;I am the one who captured him, and for this I received a reward of  a  thousand dollars!&quot; answered Walter.
