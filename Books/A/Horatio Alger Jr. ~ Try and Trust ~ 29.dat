  Notwithstanding he was receiving a salary larger than is usually  paid  boys of his age, Herbert felt cramped for the want of money. Six  dollars  a week would have paid his expenses comfortably, if he had  been well  provided to begin with. But all the clothing he had, besides  what he  wore, he had brought with him in a small bundle, the greatest  part  having been left in his trunk at the house of Abner Holden. He  often  wished that he could have them with him, but, of course, this  wish was  vain. Indeed, Mr. Holden, when the conviction was forced upon  him that  there was no chance of recovering his bound boy, quietly  confiscated the  trunk and its contents; and this, to some extent,  consoled him for the  departure of the owner. 
  Herbert found himself sadly in need of underclothing; and, of  course,  his only suit, from constant wear, was likely to deteriorate  rapidly. He  saved all the money he could from his weekly wages toward  purchasing a  new one, but his savings were inconsiderable. Besides, he  needed a  trunk, or would need one, when he had anything to put in it. 
  &quot;If I only had that money Greenleaf stole from me, I should be all   right,&quot; he said to himself, after long and anxious thought on the  great  question of ways and means. &quot;I don't see how I can save up more  than two  dollars a week out of my wages, and it will take a long time  for that to  amount to much.&quot; 
  There certainly did not appear to be much chance of saving more.  His  boarding place was as cheap as he could obtain, or, if there were   cheaper anywhere, they would probably be also poorer, and our hero  felt  that Mrs. Morgan's was as poor as he should be able to endure. 
  He was rather mortified, too, at the poverty of his wardrobe. Mrs.   Morgan asked him one day, &quot;When is your trunk coming?&quot; and Herbert was   obliged to own, with some shame, that he had none. The landlady looked   surprised, but he had no explanation to offer. 
  &quot;I suppose I shall have to wait till my wages are raised,&quot; thought   Herbert, with a little sigh. This, he reflected, would not be very  soon,  as he had started with a salary greater than he was likely to  earn, as  Mr. Godfrey had said. 
  But relief was nearer than he anticipated. 
  One day, as he was walking up the Bowery, he saw, at a little  distance  in front of him, a figure which he well remembered. The  careless, jaunty  step and well-satisfied air were familiar to him. In  short, it was Peter  Greenleaf, who had played so mean a trick upon him  at the hotel. 
  Herbert's heart beat quick with excitement, mingled with pleasure.  He  felt a natural indignation against this young man, who had cheated  him  so remorselessly, and left him, indifferent to his fate, alone and   almost penniless in a strange city. 
  What should he do? 
  Close behind him was a policeman slowly pacing his regular round.   Herbert went up to him, and, pointing to Greenleaf, rapidly recounted   his grievances. 
  &quot;It was a mean trick,&quot; said the policeman, who was a favorable  specimen  of his class. &quot;Is this the first time you have seen him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Tell me what you want to do.&quot; 
  &quot;I want to get my money back.&quot; 
  &quot;Probably he has spent it. How long since he robbed you?&quot; 
  &quot;Three weeks.&quot; 
  &quot;Not much chance, then. Probably his pocket's empty, unless he's  fleeced  somebody else in the meantime. However, it's as well to see  what can be  done. Now, I'll tell you how to act. Go up to him boldly,  and demand  your money. If he bluffs you off, call me.&quot; 
  &quot;All right,&quot; said Herbert. 
  He hastened his step, and, advancing, tapped Greenleaf on the  shoulder. 
  Greenleaf turned. When he recognized Herbert, he looked surprised  and  disconcerted. But he had plenty of assurance, and quickly  determined  upon his course. Assuming a stolid look, he said: &quot;Well, my  lad, who are  you; and what do you want?&quot; 
  &quot;You know who I am, well enough,&quot; said Herbert, angrily. 
  &quot;Do I? Then I'm uncommonly forgetful. I haven't any recollection of  your  interesting countenance,&quot; he said, with a sneer. 
  &quot;I suppose you don't want to remember me, Mr. Greenleaf,&quot; said  Herbert. 
  &quot;Greenleaf! You are thinking of somebody else. My name's Thompson.&quot; 
  &quot;Your name was Greenleaf when you stopped with me at French's  Hotel,&quot;  said Herbert, sturdily. 
  &quot;You're crazy, I fancy,&quot; said Greenleaf, shrugging his shoulders.  &quot;I  never stopped at the hotel you mention, in my life.&quot; 
  &quot;Where's the money you took from me?&quot; demanded Herbert, who felt   convinced of Greenleaf's identity, in spite of his denial. 
  &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; said Greenleaf, assuming a look of   surprise. 
  &quot;You went off before I was awake, with more than fifty dollars of  mine.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you mean to insult me?&quot; said Greenleaf, drawing himself up.  &quot;I've a  great mind to knock you over!&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Greenleaf,&quot; said Herbert, firmly, &quot;either return my money, or  as  much as you have got left, or I will call a policeman.&quot; 
  &quot;Just what I shall do, myself, unless you stop this nonsense,&quot; said   Greenleaf, angrily; but not without a sensation of uneasiness, as it   struck his mind that Herbert might really intend to do what he had  said. 
  &quot;Once more, will you give up that money?&quot; said Herbert, firmly. 
  &quot;Stand out of the way,&quot; said Greenleaf, &quot;if you know what is best  for  yourself!&quot; 
  He was about to push by, thrusting Herbert roughly out of the way,  when  our hero turned, and his look summoned the policeman, who  hastened to  the spot. 
  &quot;Give this boy his money,&quot; he said, authoritatively. &quot;I know all  about  your little game. It's up now. Unless you hand over your  plunder, you  must go with me.&quot; 
  Greenleaf changed color, and was evidently alarmed. 
  &quot;I've got nobody's money, except my own,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Come along, then,&quot; said the officer, taking him by the arm. 
  &quot;Stop a minute,&quot; said he, hurriedly, finding that matters had come  to a  crisis. &quot;If I give up what I have, will you let me go?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, that depends on how much you have.&quot; 
  &quot;I've got twenty dollars.&quot; 
  Herbert was about to say that this would do, but the policeman  shook his  head. 
  &quot;Won't do,&quot; said he. &quot;Come along.&quot; 
  After a little haggling, Greenleaf produced forty dollars, which  Herbert  pocketed, with much satisfaction. 
  &quot;Now go along, and mind you don't try any more such games.&quot; 
  Greenleaf needed no second permission to be gone. He feared that  the  officer might change his mind, and he might, after all, be  consigned to  the station house. 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Herbert, gratefully. &quot;I needed the money badly. I   shouldn't have recovered it but for you.&quot; 
  &quot;Take better care of it next time,&quot; said the officer, not unkindly.   &quot;Take care not to trust a stranger too easily. Better take my advice,   and put it in a savings bank.&quot; &quot;I shall be obliged to use most of it,&quot;   said Herbert. &quot;What I don't need, I will put in the bank.&quot; 
  The recovery of so much of his lost money seemed to Herbert quite a   lucky windfall. He went at once to a trunk store, and, for five  dollars,  purchased a good, durable trunk, which he ordered sent home  to his  lodgings. Fifteen dollars more he invested in necessary  underclothing,  and this left him one-half of the money for future use.  Besides this he  had six dollars, which, in three weeks, he had saved  from his wages.  With this sum, and the articles he had purchased, he  felt quite rich,  and returned to the counting-room&#8212;this happened  during the hour given  him for dinner&#8212;in unusually good spirits. He  had other reasons for  encouragement. He was getting accustomed to his  duties at the counting-  room. Mr. Godfrey always treated him kindly,  and had called upon him  again that very morning to assist him in  translating a French letter,  complimenting him, at the same time, upon  his scholarship. 
  &quot;I'll do my best,&quot; thought Herbert. &quot;'Try and Trust,' that's my  motto. I  think it will bring me success.&quot; 
  But even while he spoke, an unforeseen danger menaced him.
