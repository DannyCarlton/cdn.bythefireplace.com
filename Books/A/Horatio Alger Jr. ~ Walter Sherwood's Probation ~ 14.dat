  To understand the scene in which Walter became an actor a brief   explanation is necessary. 
  The occupant of the house was a woman of perhaps thirty-five. Her   husband, Ephraim Gregory, was employed in Chicago, and went to and   from the city every day. It was somewhat inconvenient to live at Elm   Bank, but both he and his wife were fond of the country, and were   willing to submit to some inconvenience for the sake of the sweet,   pure air and rural surroundings. They had one child, a little girl of   five. 
  Twenty minutes previous Mrs. Gregory had been sitting at her  sewing,  with little Rosa on the floor beside her, when, without the  ceremony  of a knock, the outer door was opened and a tall, powerful  man, whose  garb and general appearance indicated that he was a tramp,  entered the  room. 
  &quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Mrs. Gregory, rising in alarm. 
  &quot;I'm hungry,&quot; answered the tramp, in a hoarse voice. 
  He might be hungry, but his breath indicated that he had been   drinking. Mrs. Gregory would gladly have dismissed him, but she was   afraid to do so. If only her husband had been at home! 
  &quot;Sit down,&quot; she said, &quot;and I will find you something.&quot; 
  She went to the pantry and returned with some bread and cold meat,   which she set before her uncouth visitor. 
  &quot;If you will wait five minutes I will make you some tea,&quot; she said. 
  &quot;I don't want any slops,&quot; said her visitor, scornfully. &quot;Give me   brandy.&quot; 
  &quot;I have none.&quot; 
  &quot;Then whisky, gin&#8212;anything!&quot; 
  &quot;We don't keep liquors in the house. My husband and I never drink   them.&quot; 
  At this he swore in a manner that terrified his unwilling hostess,  and  anathematized her for a temperance crank. This aroused her spirit. 
  &quot;If you want liquor,&quot; she said, &quot;you may go where it is sold. I  won't  supply it to you or anybody else. If you want hot tea you can  have  it.&quot; 
  &quot;Give it to me, then.&quot; 
  Mrs. Gregory hastened to steep some tea&#8212;she had hot water all  ready&#8212;  and set it before the ruffian. He ate and drank eagerly,  voraciously,  and did not leave a crumb behind him. He had certainly  spoken the  truth when he said he was hungry. Then he arose, and she  hoped he  would go. But he turned to her with a significant look. 
  &quot;I want money,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;I can give you none,&quot; she answered, her heart sinking. 
  &quot;Oh, yes, you can.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you a thief?&quot; she demanded, with a flash of spirit. 
  &quot;You can call me that if you like.&quot; 
  There was little hope of shaming him, she saw. 
  &quot;Look here, missis,&quot; he went on roughly, &quot;you've got money in the   house, and I must have it.&quot; 
  &quot;How do you know that I have money in the house?&quot; 
  &quot;Your husband brought some home last night. It is here now.&quot; 
  This was true, and she was startled to find how much this man knew. 
  &quot;Do you know my husband?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;Yes, I know him. His name is Ephraim Gregory. He had some money  paid  him yesterday and it is here. I don't know where it is, but you  do.  Get it, and be quick about it!&quot; 
  Mrs. Gregory saw by this time that her visitor was a desperate  villain  and that she was in a critical position. He might, since he  knew so  much, know the amount of money which her husband had entrusted  to her  for safekeeping. If she could buy him off for five dollars she  would  do so. 
  &quot;Will you go if I give you five dollars?&quot; she asked. 
  He laughed. 
  &quot;No, I won't. Why should I take five dollars when you have a  hundred  here?&quot; 
  She turned pale. The worst was true, then. This man had in some   mysterious manner discovered the exact sum which she had in charge.   Why had not her husband kept it in his own possession? It would have   been more prudent. 
  &quot;I can't give you the money,&quot; she said, pale but resolute. 
  &quot;Oh, yes, you will!&quot; he answered mockingly. 
  &quot;Go away, please,&quot; she said in a pleading tone. &quot;I have given you a   meal, though you had no claim on me. Let that be sufficient.&quot; 
  &quot;You can't fool me!&quot; he replied roughly. &quot;Bring me the money, or it   will be the worse for you.&quot; 
  &quot;I cannot!&quot; she gasped. 
  &quot;Then, by Heaven, I'll brain you!&quot; 
  As he spoke he raised the chair on which he had been sitting and  held  it in position above his head, ready to bring it down upon the   helpless woman. 
  Then it was that she uttered the piercing scream which brought  Walter  into the house. 
  His astonished glance rested on the terrified woman, with her  little  girl clinging in alarm to her dress, cowering beneath the chair  which  seemed ready to descend upon her. 
  Walter did not hesitate a moment. Though the tramp was possessed of   twice his strength, he darted forward and grasped him by the arm. 
  &quot;What are you about?&quot; he demanded sternly. 
  The tramp turned at the unexpected interference and partially  lowered  the chair. 
  &quot;What business is it of yours, you impudent young jackanapes?&quot; he   growled. 
  &quot;I will make it my business,&quot; said Walter, bravely. &quot;I won't see a   lady struck down by a ruffian!&quot; 
  &quot;Take care how you talk. I can twist you round my finger, you   manikin!&quot; &quot;What does this man want?&quot; asked Walter, turning to Mrs.   Gregory. 
  &quot;He demands money,&quot; was her answer. 
  &quot;So he is a thief!&quot; exclaimed Walter, contemptuously. 
  &quot;I'll fix you for that!&quot; growled the tramp, with a frown. 
  Walter quickly explored the room in search of a weapon, for he saw   that he would have to defend himself. 
  There was a fireplace in the apartment, and resting beside it was a   poker of large size. Walter sprang for this, and, grasping it firmly,   brandished it in a threatening manner. 
  &quot;Go upstairs, madam,&quot; he said, &quot;and lock yourself in. I will attend  to  this man.&quot; 
  The tramp burst into a contemptuous laugh. 
  &quot;Why, you young whippersnapper!&quot; he said, &quot;I could handle half a  dozen  boys like you.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't like to leave you in the power of this man,&quot; said Mrs.   Gregory. &quot;He will kill you.&quot; 
  &quot;Right you are, ma'am!&quot;' growled the giant. &quot;That's just what I am   going to do.&quot; 
  The lady turned pale. She was frightened, but her concern for  Walter's  safety overcame her fear for herself. 
  &quot;I shall stay here,&quot; she said, &quot;It would be cowardly to leave you.&quot; 
  &quot;Take my advice, boy,&quot; growled the tramp, &quot;and clear out of here.  It  is no concern of yours.&quot; 
  Walter did not answer, but, keen, alert, vigilant, he fixed his eye   warily on his formidable opponent. 
  &quot;Well, youngster,&quot; said the tramp impatiently, &quot;did you hear me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I heard you.&quot; 
  &quot;Leave this room, or I'll smash you!&quot; 
  &quot;Smash away!&quot; retorted Walter. 
  Though he was barely five feet six inches in height, while the  tramp  was fully six feet, his muscles had been toughened by exercise  in the  college gymnasium and by rowing in the college crew, and he was   wonderfully quick in his motions. 
  Feeling that the time for forbearance was over, and irritated  beyond  measure by Walter's audacity, the tramp prepared to carry out  his  threat. He raised the chair and with a downward sweep aimed at   Walter's head. 
  Had the blow taken effect, this story would never have been  written.  But Walter's quick eye foresaw the movement, and, springing  aside, he  dodged the blow and brought down the poker on the muscular  part of the  giant's arm with what force he could command. There was a  howl of  pain, and the tramp's arm hung limp and lifeless at his side,  while  with the other he clasped it in evident suffering. 
  &quot;You murderous young villain!&quot; he shrieked. &quot;I'll kill you for  that!&quot; 
  Walter felt that he was in a dangerous position. 
  &quot;Leave the room, please!&quot; he said to Mrs. Gregory. &quot;You will be in  my  way.&quot; She obeyed, for her champion had shown himself worthy to   command, and Walter sprang to the other side of the table, placing it   between him and his foe. 
  By this time the tramp had got ready for an attack. He dashed round   the table after Walter, and finally succeeded, in spite of the boy's   activity, in grasping him by the shoulder. 
  &quot;Ah!&quot; he said, with a deep sigh of content, &quot;I've got you now. I'll   pay you for that blow!&quot; 
  Walter felt that he had never been in such a tight place before.
