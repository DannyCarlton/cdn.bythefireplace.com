 "What have you there, Luke?" asked Mrs. Larkin, as Luke entered the little sitting-room with the tin box under his arm.  
  "I met a man on my way home, who asked me to keep it for him."  
  "Do you know the man?" asked his mother, in surprise.  
  "No," answered Luke.  
  "It seems very singular.  What did he say?"  
  "He said that he was obliged to leave the neighborhood at once, and could not conveniently carry the box."  
  "Do you think it contains anything of value?"  
  "Yes, mother.  It is like the boxes rich men have to hold their stocks and bonds.  I was at the bank one day, and saw a gentleman bring in one to deposit in the safe."  
  "I can't understand that at all, Luke.  You say you did not know this man?"  
  "I never met him before."  
  "And, of course, he does not know you?"  
  "No, for he asked my name."  
  "Yet he put what may be valuable property in your possession."  
  "I think," said Luke, shrewdly, "he had no one else to trust it to.  Besides, a country boy wouldn't be very likely to make use of stocks and bonds."  
  "No, that is true.  I suppose the tin box is locked?"  
  "Yes, mother.  The owner--he says his name is Roland Reed--wishes it put under lock and key."  
  "I can lock it up in my trunk, Luke."  
  "I think that will be a good idea."  
  "I hope he will pay you for your trouble when he takes away the tin box."  
  "He has already.  I forgot to mention it," and Luke drew from his vest pocket, the bank-note he had thrust in as soon as received.  "Why, it's a ten-dollar bill!" he exclaimed.  "I wonder whether he knew he was giving me as much?"  
  "I presume so, Luke," said his mother, brightening up.  "You are in luck!"  
  "Take it, mother.  You will find a use for it."  
  "But, Luke, this money is yours."  
  "No, it is yours, for you are going to take care of the box."  
  It was, indeed, quite a windfall, and both mother and son retired to rest in a cheerful frame of mind, in spite of Luke's failure in the race.  
  "I have been thinking, Luke," said his mother, at the breakfast-table, "that I should like to have you buy a Waterbury watch out of this money.  It will only cost three dollars and a half, and that is only one-third."  
  "Thank you, mother, but I can get along without the watch.  I cared for it chiefly because it was to be a prize given to the best skater.  All the boys know that I would have won but for the accident, and that satisfies me."  
  "I should like you to have a watch, Luke."  
  "There is another objection, mother.  I don't want any one to know about the box or the money.  If it were known that we had so much property in the house, some attempt might be made to rob us."  
  "That is true, Luke.  But I hope it won't be long before you have a watch of your own."  
  When Luke was walking, after breakfast, he met Randolph Duncan, with a chain attached to the prize watch ostentatiously displayed on the outside of his vest.  He smiled complacently, and rather triumphantly, when he met Luke.  But Luke looked neither depressed nor angry.  
  "I hope your watch keeps good time, Randolph," he said.  
  "Yes; it hasn't varied a minute so far.  I think it will keep as good time as my silver watch."  
  "You are fortunate to have two watches."  
  "My father has promised me a gold watch when I am eighteen," said Randolph, pompously.  
  "I don't know if I shall have any watch at all when I am eighteen."  
  "Oh, well, you are a poor boy.  It doesn't matter to you."  
  "I don't know about that, Randolph.  Time is likely to be of as much importance to a poor boy as to a rich boy."  
  "Oh, ah! yes, of course, but a poor boy isn't expected to wear a watch."  
  Here the conversation ended.  Luke walked on with an amused smile on his face.  
  "I wonder how it would seem to be as complacent and self- satisfied as Randolph?" he thought.  "On the whole, I would rather be as I am."  
  "Good morning, Luke!"  
  It was a girl's voice that addressed him.  Looking up, he met the pleasant glance of Florence Grant, considered by many the prettiest girl in Groveton.  Her mother was a widow in easy circumstances, who had removed from Chicago three years before, and occupied a handsome cottage nearly opposite Mr. Duncan's residence.  She was a general favorite, not only for her good looks, but on account of her pleasant manner and sweet disposition.  
  "Good morning, Florence," said Luke, with an answering smile.  
  "What a pity you lost the race yesterday!"  
  "Randolph doesn't think so."  
  "No; he is a very selfish boy, I am afraid."  
  "Did you see the race?" asked Luke.  
  "No, but I heard all about it.  If it hadn't been for Tom Harper you would have won, wouldn't you?"  
  "I think so."  
  "All the boys say so.  What could have induced Tom to get in the way?"  
  "I don't know.  It was very foolish, however.  He got badly hurt."  
  "Tom is a friend of Randolph," said Florence significantly.  
  "Yes," answered Luke; "but I don't think Randolph would stoop to such a trick as that."  
  "You wouldn't, Luke, but Randolph is a different boy.  Besides, I hear he was trying for something else."  
  "I know; his father offered him ten dollars besides."  
  "I don't see why it is that some fare so much better than others," remarked Florence, thoughtfully.  "The watch and the money would have done you more good."  
  "So they would, Florence, but I don't complain.  I may be better off some day than I am now."  
  "I hope you will, Luke," said Florence, cordially.  
  "I am very much obliged to you for your good wishes," said Luke, warmly.  
  "That reminds me, Luke, next week, Thursday, is my birthday, and I am to have a little party in the evening.  Will you come?"  
  Luke's face flushed with pleasure.  Though he knew Florence very well from their being schoolfellows, he had never visited the house.  He properly regarded the invitation as a compliment, and as a mark of friendship from one whose good opinion he highly valued.  
  "Thank you, Florence," he said.  "You are very kind, and I shall have great pleasure in being present.  Shall you have many?"  
  "About twenty.  Your friend Randolph will be there."  
  "I think there will be room for both of us," said Luke, with a smile.  
  The young lady bade him good morning and went on her way.  
  Two days later Luke met Randolph at the dry-goods store in the village.  
  "What are you buying?" asked Randolph, condescendingly.  
  "Only a spool of thread for my mother."  
  "I am buying a new necktie to wear to Florence Grant's birthday party," said Randolph, pompously.  
  "I think I shall have to do the same," said Luke, enjoying the surprise he saw expressed on Randolph's face.  
  "Are you going?" demanded Randolph, abruptly.  
  "Yes."  
  "Have you been invited?"  
  "That is a strange question," answered Luke, indignantly.  "Do you think I would go without an invitation?"  
  "Really, it will be quite a mixed affair," said Randolph, shrugging his shoulders.  
  "If you think so, why do you go?"  
  "I don't want to disappoint Florence."  
  Luke smiled.  He was privately of the opinion that the disappointment wouldn't be intense.
