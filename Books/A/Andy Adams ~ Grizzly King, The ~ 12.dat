  Thor was on what the Indians call a<I> pimootao</I>. His brute mind  had all at once added two and two together, and while perhaps he did  not make four of it, his mental arithmetic was accurate enough to  convince him that straight north was the road to travel.
  By the time Langdon and Bruce had reached the summit of the Bighorn  Highway, and were listening to the distant tongueing of the dogs,  little Muskwa was in abject despair. Following Thor had been like a  game of tag with never a moment's rest.
  An hour after they left the sheep trail they came to the rise in the  valley where the waters separated. From this point one creek flowed  southward into the Tacla Lake country and the other northward into the  Babine, which was a tributary of the Skeena. They descended very  quickly into a much lower country, and for the first time Muskwa  encountered marshland, and travelled at times through grass so rank and  thick that he could not see but could only hear Thor forging on ahead  of him.
  The stream grew wider and deeper, and in places they skirted the  edges of dark, quiet pools that Muskwa thought must have been of  immeasurable depth. These pools gave Muskwa his first breathing-spells.  Now and then Thor would stop and sniff over the edge of them. He was  hunting for something, and yet he never seemed to find it; and each  time that he started on afresh Muskwa was so much nearer to the end of  his endurance.
  They were fully seven miles north of the point from which Bruce and  Langdon were scanning the valley through their glasses when they came  to a lake. It was a dark and unfriendly looking lake to Muskwa, who had  never seen anything but sunlit pools in the dips. The forest grew close  down to its shore. In places it was almost black. Queer birds squawked  in the thick reeds. It was heavy with a strange odour&#8212;a fragrance of  something that made the cub lick his little chops, and filled him with  hunger.
  For a minute or two Thor stood sniffing this scent that filled the  air. It was the smell of fish.
  Slowly the big grizzly began picking his way along the edge of the  lake. He soon came to the mouth of a small creek. It was not more than  twenty feet wide, but it was dark and quiet and deep, like the lake  itself. For a hundred yards Thor made his way up this creek, until he  came to where a number of trees had fallen across it, forming a jam.  Close to this jam the water was covered with a green scum. Thor knew  what lay under that scum, and very quietly he crept out on the logs.
  Midway in the stream he paused, and with his right paw gently  brushed back the scum so that an open pool of clear water lay directly  under him.
  Muskwa's bright little eyes watched him from the shore. He knew that  Thor was after something to eat, but how he was going to get it out of  that pool of water puzzled and interested him in spite of his  weariness.
  Thor stretched himself out on his belly, his head and right paw well  over the jam. He now put his paw a foot into the water and held it  there very quietly. He could see clearly to the bottom of the stream.  For a few moments he saw only this bottom, a few sticks, and the  protruding end of a limb. Then a long slim shadow moved slowly under  him&#8212;a fifteen-inch trout. It was too deep for him, and Thor did not  make an excited plunge.
  Patiently he waited, and very soon this patience was rewarded. A  beautiful red-spotted trout floated out from under the scum, and so  suddenly that Muskwa gave a yelp of terror, Thor's huge paw sent a  shower of water a dozen feet into the air, and the fish landed with a  thump within three feet of the cub. Instantly Muskwa was upon it. His  sharp teeth dug into it as it flopped and struggled.
  Thor rose on the logs, but when he saw that Muskwa had taken  possession of the fish, he resumed his former position. Muskwa was just  finishing his first real kill when a second spout of water shot upward  and another trout pirouetted shoreward through the air. This time Thor  followed quickly, for he was hungry.
  It was a glorious feast they had that early afternoon beside the  shaded creek. Five times Thor knocked fish out from under the scum, but  for the life of him Muskwa could not eat more than his first trout.
  For several hours after their dinner they lay in a cool, hidden spot  close to the log-jam. Muskwa did not sleep soundly. He was beginning to  understand that life was now largely a matter of personal  responsibility with him, and his ears had begun to attune themselves to  sound. Whenever Thor moved or heaved a deep sigh, Muskwa knew it. After  that day's Marathon with the grizzly he was filled with uneasiness&#8212;a  fear that he might lose his big friend and food-killer, and he was  determined that the parent he had adopted should have no opportunity of  slipping away from him unheard and unseen. But Thor had no intention of  deserting his little comrade. In fact, he was becoming quite fond of  Muskwa.
  It was not alone his hunger for fish or fear of his enemies that was  bringing Thor into the lower country of the Babine waterways. For a  week past there had been in him a steadily growing unrest, and it had  reached its climax in these last two or three days of battle and  flight. He was filled with a strange and unsatisfied yearning, and as  Muskwa napped in his little bed among the bushes Thor's ears were  keenly alert for certain sounds and his nose frequently sniffed the  air. He wanted a mate. It was<I> puskoowepesim</I>&#8212;the &#8220;moulting  moon&#8221;&#8212;and always in this moon, or the end of the &#8220;egg-laying moon,&#8221;  which was June, he hunted for the female that came to him from the  western ranges. He was almost entirely a creature of habit, and always  he made this particular detour, entering the other valley again far  down toward the Babine. He never failed to feed on fish along the way,  and the more fish he ate the stronger was the odour of him. It is  barely possible Thor had discovered that this perfume of golden-spotted  trout made him more attractive to his lady-love. Anyway, he ate fish,  and he smelled abundantly.
  Thor rose and stretched himself two hours before sunset, and he  knocked three more fish out of the water. Muskwa ate the head of one  and Thor finished the rest. Then they continued their pilgrimage.
  It was a new world that Muskwa entered now. In it there were none of  the old familiar sounds. The purring drone of the upper valley was  gone. There were no whistlers, and no ptarmigan, and no fat little  gophers running about. The water of the lake lay still, and dark, and  deep, with black and sunless pools hiding themselves under the roots of  trees, so close did the forest cling to it. There were no rocks to  climb over, but dank, soft logs, thick windfalls, and litters of brush.  The air was different, too. It was very still. Under their feet at  times was a wonderful carpet of soft moss in which Thor sank nearly to  his armpits. And the forest was filled with a strange gloom and many  mysterious shadows, and there hung heavily in it the pungent smells of  decaying vegetation.
  Thor did not travel so swiftly here. The silence and the gloom and  the oppressively scented air seemed to rouse his caution. He stepped  quietly; frequently he stopped and looked about him, and listened; he  smelled at the edges of pools hidden under the roots; every new sound  brought him to a stop, his head hung low and his ears alert.
  Several times Muskwa saw shadowy things floating through the gloom.  They were the big gray owls that turned snow white in winter. And once,  when it was almost dark, they came upon a pop-eyed, loose-jointed,  fierce-looking creature in the trail who scurried away like a ball at  sight of Thor. It was a lynx.
  It was not yet quite dark when Thor came out very quietly into a  clearing, and Muskwa found himself first on the shore of a creek, and  then close to a big pond. The air was full of the breath and warmth of  a new kind of life. It was not fish, and yet it seemed to come from the  pond, in the centre of which were three or four circular masses that  looked like great brush-heaps plastered with a coating of mud.
  Whenever he came into this end of the valley Thor always paid a  visit to the beaver colony, and occasionally he helped himself to a fat  young beaver for supper or breakfast. This evening he was not hungry,  and he was in a hurry. In spite of these two facts he stood for some  minutes in the shadows near the pond.
  The beavers had already begun their night's work. Muskwa soon  understood the significance of the shimmering streaks that ran swiftly  over the surface of the water. At the end of each streak was always a  dark, flat head, and now he saw that most of these streaks began at the  farther edge of the pond and made directly for a long, low barrier that  shut in the water a hundred yards to the east.
  This particular barrier was strange to Thor, and with his maturer  knowledge of beaver ways he knew that his engineering friends&#8212;whom he  ate only occasionally&#8212;were broadening their domain by building a new  dam. As they watched, two fat workmen shoved a four-foot length of log  into the pond with a big splash, and one of them began piloting it  toward the scene of building operations, while his companion returned  to other work. A little later there was a crash in the timber on the  opposite side of the pond, where another workman had succeeded in  felling a tree. Then Thor made his way toward the dam.
  Almost instantly there was a terrific crack out in the middle of the  pond, followed by a tremendous splash. An old beaver had seen Thor and  with the flat side of his broad tail had given the surface of the water  a warning slap that cut the still air like a rifle-shot. All at once  there were splashings and divings in every direction, and a moment  later the pond was ruffled and heaving as a score of interrupted  workers dove excitedly under the surface to the safety of their  brush-ribbed and mud-plastered strongholds, and Muskwa was so absorbed  in the general excitement that he almost forgot to follow Thor.
  He overtook the grizzly at the dam. For a few moments Thor inspected  the new work, and then tested it with his weight. It was solid, and  over this bridge ready built for them they crossed to the higher ground  on the opposite side. A few hundred yards farther on Thor struck a  fairly well-beaten caribou trail which in the course of half an hour  led them around the end of the lake to the outlet stream flowing north.
  Every minute Muskwa was hoping that Thor would stop. His afternoon's  nap had not taken the lameness out of his legs nor the soreness from  the tender pads of his feet. He had had enough, and more than enough,  of travel, and could he have regulated the world according to his own  wishes he would not have walked another mile for a whole month. Mere  walking would not have been so bad, but to keep up with Thor's ambling  gait he was compelled to trot, like a stubby four-year-old child  hanging desperately to the thumb of a big and fast-walking man. Muskwa  had not even a thumb to hang to. The bottoms of his feet were like  boils; his tender nose was raw from contact with brush and the  knife-edged marsh grass, and his little back felt all caved in. Still  he hung on desperately, until the creek-bottom was again sand and  gravel, and travelling was easier.
  The stars were up now, millions of them, clear and brilliant; and it  was quite evident that Thor had set his mind on an &#8220;all-night hike,&#8221; a<I>  kuppatipsk pimootao</I> as a Cree tracker would have called it. Just  how it would have ended for Muskwa is a matter of conjecture had not  the spirits of thunder and rain and lightning put their heads together  to give him a rest.
  For perhaps an hour the stars were undimmed, and Thor kept on like a  heathen without a soul, while Muskwa limped on all four feet. Then a  low rumbling gathered in the west. It grew louder and louder, and  approached swiftly&#8212;straight from the warm Pacific. Thor grew uneasy,  and sniffed in the face of it. Livid streaks began to criss-cross a  huge pall of black that was closing in on them like a vast curtain. The  stars began to go out. A moaning wind came. And then the rain.
  Thor had found a huge rock that shelved inward, like a lean-to, and  he crept back under this with Muskwa before the deluge descended. For  many minutes it was more like a flood than a rain. It seemed as though  a part of the Pacific Ocean had been scooped up and dropped on them,  and in half an hour the creek was a swollen torrent.
  The lightning and the crash of thunder terrified Muskwa. Now he  could see Thor in great blinding flashes of fire, and the next instant  it was as black as pitch; the tops of the mountains seemed falling down  into the valley; the earth trembled and shook&#8212;and he snuggled closer  and closer to Thor until at last he lay between his two forearms, half  buried in the long hair of the big grizzly's shaggy chest. Thor himself  was not much concerned in these noisy convulsions of nature, except to  keep himself dry. When he took a bath he wanted the sun to be shining  and a nice warm rock close at hand on which to stretch himself.
  For a long time after its first fierce outbreak the rain continued  to fall in a gentle shower. Muskwa liked this, and under the sheltering  rock, snuggled against Thor, he felt very comfortable and easily fell  asleep. Through long hours Thor kept his vigil alone, drowsing now and  then, but kept from sound slumber by the restlessness that was in him.
  It stopped raining soon after midnight, but it was very dark, the  stream was flooding over its bars, and Thor remained under the rock.  Muskwa had a splendid sleep.
  Day had come when Thor's stirring roused Muskwa. He followed the  grizzly out into the open, feeling tremendously better than last night,  though his feet were still sore and his body was stiff.
  Thor began to follow the creek again. Along this stream there were  low flats and many small bayous where grew luxuriantly the tender grass  and roots, and especially the slim long-stemmed lilies on which Thor  was fond of feeding. But for a thousand-pound grizzly to fill up on  such vegetarian dainties as these consumed many hours, if not one's  whole time, and Thor considered that he had no time to lose. Thor was a  most ardent lover when he loved at all, which was only a few days out  of the year; and during these days he twisted his mode of living around  so that while the spirit possessed him he no longer existed for the  sole purpose of eating and growing fat. For a short time he put aside  his habit of living to eat, and ate to live; and poor Muskwa was almost  famished before another dinner was forthcoming.
  But at last, early in the afternoon, Thor came to a pool which he  could not pass. It was not a dozen feet in width, and it was alive with  trout. The fish had not been able to reach the lake above, and they had  waited too long after the flood-season to descend into the deeper  waters of the Babine and the Skeena. They had taken refuge in this  pool, which was now about to become a death-trap.
  At one end the water was two feet deep; at the other end only a few  inches. After pondering over this fact for a few moments, the grizzly  waded openly into the deepest part, and from the bank above Muskwa saw  the shimmering trout darting into the shallower water. Thor advanced  slowly, and now, when he stood in less than eight inches of water, the  panic-stricken fish one after another tried to escape back into the  deeper part of the pool.
  Again and again Thor's big right paw swept up great showers of  water. The first inundation knocked Muskwa off his feet. But with it  came a two-pound trout which the cub quickly dragged out of range and  began eating. So agitated became the pool because of the mighty strokes  of Thor's paw that the trout completely lost their heads, and no sooner  did they reach one end than they turned about and darted for the other.  They kept this up until the grizzly had thrown fully a dozen of their  number ashore.
  So absorbed was Muskwa in his fish, and Thor in his fishing, that  neither had noticed a visitor. Both saw him at about the same time, and  for fully thirty seconds they stood and stared, Thor in his pool and  the cub over his fish, utter amazement robbing them of the power of  movement. The visitor was another grizzly, and as coolly as though he  had done the fishing himself he began eating the fish which Thor had  thrown out! A worse insult or a deadlier challenge could not have been  known in the land of Beardom. Even Muskwa sensed that fact. He looked  expectantly at Thor. There was going to be another fight, and he licked  his little chops in anticipation.
  Thor came up out of the pool slowly. On the bank he paused. The  grizzlies gazed at each other, the newcomer crunching a fish as he  looked. Neither growled. Muskwa perceived no signs of enmity, and then  to his increased astonishment Thor began eating a fish within three  feet of the interloper!
  Perhaps man is the finest of all God's creations, but when it comes  to his respect for old age he is no better, and sometimes not as good,  as a grizzly bear; for Thor would not rob an old bear, he would not  fight an old bear, and he would not drive an old bear from his own  meat&#8212;which is more than can be said of some humans. And the visitor  was an old bear, and a sick bear as well. He stood almost as high as  Thor, but he was so old that he was only half as broad across the  chest, and his neck and head were grotesquely thin. The Indians have a  name for him.<I> Kuyas Wapusk</I> they call him&#8212;the bear so old he is  about to die. They let him go unharmed; other bears tolerate him and  let him eat their meat if he chances along; the white man kills him.
  This old bear was famished. His claws were gone; his hair was thin,  and in some places his skin was naked, and he had barely more than red,  hard gums to chew with. If he lived until autumn he would den up&#8212;for  the last time. Perhaps death would come even sooner than that. If so,<I>  Kuyas Wapusk</I> would know in time, and he would crawl off into some  hidden cave or deep crevice in the rocks to breathe his last. For in  all the Rocky Mountains, so far as Bruce or Langdon knew, there was not  a man who had found the bones or body of a grizzly that had died a  natural death!
  And big, hunted Thor, torn by wound and pursued by man, seemed to  understand that this would be the last real feast on earth for<I> Kuyas  Wapusk</I>&#8212;too old to fish for himself, too old to hunt, too old even  to dig out the tender lily roots; and so he let him eat until the last  fish was gone, and then went on, with Muskwa tagging at his heels.
