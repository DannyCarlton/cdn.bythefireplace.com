There are six sorts of movement: generation, destruction,  increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place.    
It is evident in all but one case that all these sorts of  movement are distinct each from each. Generation is distinct from  destruction, increase and change of place from diminution, and so  on. But in the case of alteration it may be argued that the  process necessarily implies one or other of the other five sorts  of motion. This is not true, for we may say that all affections,  or nearly all, produce in us an alteration which is distinct from  all other sorts of motion, for that which is affected need not  suffer either increase or diminution or any of the other sorts of  motion. Thus alteration is a distinct sort of motion; for, if it  were not, the thing altered would not only be altered, but would  forthwith necessarily suffer increase or diminution or some one  of the other sorts of motion in addition; which as a matter of  fact is not the case. Similarly that which was undergoing the  process of increase or was subject to some other sort of motion  would, if alteration were not a distinct form of motion,  necessarily be subject to alteration also. But there are some  things which undergo increase but yet not alteration. The square,  for instance, if a gnomon is applied to it, undergoes increase  but not alteration, and so it is with all other figures of this  sort. Alteration and increase, therefore, are distinct.    
Speaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion. But the  different forms of motion have their own contraries in other  forms; thus destruction is the contrary of generation, diminution  of increase, rest in a place, of change of place. As for this  last, change in the reverse direction would seem to be most truly  its contrary; thus motion upwards is the contrary of motion  downwards and vice versa.    
In the case of that sort of motion which yet remains, of those  that have been enumerated, it is not easy to state what is its  contrary. It appears to have no contrary, unless one should  define the contrary here also either as 'rest in its quality' or  as 'change in the direction of the contrary quality', just as we  defined the contrary of change of place either as rest in a place  or as change in the reverse direction. For a thing is altered  when change of quality takes place; therefore either rest in its  quality or change in the direction of the contrary may be called  the contrary of this qualitative form of motion. In this way  becoming white is the contrary of becoming black; there is  alteration in the contrary direction, since a change of a  qualitative nature takes place.
