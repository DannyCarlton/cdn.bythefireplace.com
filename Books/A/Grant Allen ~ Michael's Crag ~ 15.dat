The wedding breakfast went off pleasantly, without a hitch of any  sort. Trevennack, always dignified and always a grand seigneur, rose  to the occasion with his happiest spirit. The silver-haired wife,  gazing up at him, felt proud of him as of old, and was for once quite  at her ease. For all was over now, thank heaven, and dear Cleer was  married!    
That same afternoon the bride and bridegroom started off for their  honeymoon to the Tyrol and Italy. When Mrs. Trevennack was left alone  with her husband it was with a thankful heart. She turned to him,  flowing over in soul with joy. "Oh, Michael," she cried, melting, "I'm  so happy, so happy, so happy."    
Trevennack stooped down and kissed her forehead tenderly. He had  always been a good husband, and he loved her with all his heart.  "That's well, Lucy," he answered. "Thank God, it's all over. For I  can't hold out much longer. The strain's too much for me." He paused a  moment, and looked at her. "Lucy," he said, once more, clasping his  forehead with one hand, "I've fought against it hard. I'm fighting  against it still. But at times it almost gets the better of me. Do you  know who I saw in the church this morning, skulking behind a pillar?--  that man Walter Tyrrel."    
Mrs. Trevennack gazed at him all aghast. This was surely a delusion, a  fixed idea, an insane hallucination. "Oh, no, dear," she cried, prying  deep into his eyes. "It couldn't be he, it couldn't. You must be  mistaken, Michael. I'm sure he's not in London."    
"No more mistaken than I am this minute," Trevennack answered, rushing  over to the window, and pointing with one hand eagerly. "See, see!  there he is, Lucy--the man that killed our poor, dear Michael!"    
Mrs. Trevennack uttered a little cry, half sob, half wail, as she  looked out of the window and, under the gas-lamps opposite, recognized  through the mist the form of Walter Tyrrel.    
But Trevennack didn't rush out at him as she feared and believed he  would. He only stood still in his place and glared at his enemy. "Not  now," he said, slowly; "not now, on Cleer's wedding day. But some  other time--more suitable. I hear it in my ears; I hear the voice  still ringing: 'Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince!' I can't  disobey. I shall go in due time. I shall fight the enemy."    
And he sank back in his chair, with his eyes staring wildly.    
For the next week or two, while Cleer wrote home happy letters from  Paris, Innsbruck, Milan, Venice, Florence, poor Mrs. Trevennack was  tortured inwardly with another terrible doubt; had Michael's state  become so dangerous at last that he must be put under restraint as a  measure of public security? For Walter Tyrrel's sake, ought she to  make his condition known to the world at large--and spoil Cleer's  honeymoon? She shrank from that final necessity with a deadly  shrinking. Day after day she put the discovery off, and solaced her  soul with the best intentions--as what true woman would not?    
But we know where good intentions go. On the morning of the twenty-  ninth, which is Michaelmas Day, the poor mother rose in fear and  trembling. Michael, to all outward appearance, was as sane as usual.  He breakfasted and went down to the office, as was his wont.    
When he arrived there, however, he found letters from Falmouth  awaiting him with bad news. His presence was needed at once. He must  miss his projected visit to St. Michael's, Cornhill. He must go down  to Cornwall.    
Hailing a cab at the door he hastened back to Paddington just in time  for the Cornish express. This was surely a call. The words rang in his  ears louder and clearer than ever, "Go, Michael, of celestial armies  prince!" He would go and obey them. He would trample under foot this  foul fiend that masqueraded in human shape as his dear boy's murderer.  He would wield once more that huge two-handed sword, brandished aloft,  wide-wasting, in unearthly warfare. He would come out in his true  shape before heaven and earth as the chief of the archangels.    
Stepping into a first-class compartment he found himself, unluckily  for his present mood, alone. All the way down to Exeter the fit was on  him. He stood up in the carriage, swaying his unseen blade, celestial  temper fine, and rolling forth in a loud voice Miltonic verses of his  old encounters in heaven with the powers of darkness.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air <br>  Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields <br>  Blazed opposite, while expectation stood <br>  In horror."</small></i></blockquote><br>
He mouthed out the lines in a perfect ecstasy of madness. It was  delightful to be alone. He could give his soul full vent. He knew he  was mad. He knew he was an archangel.    
And all the way down he repeated to himself, many times over, that he  would trample under foot that base fiend Walter Tyrrel. Satan has many  disguises; squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, he sat in  Paradise; for    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "...spirits as they please <br> Can limb themselves, and color, or size assume <br> As likes them best, condense or rare."</small></i></blockquote><br>
If he himself, Michael, prince of celestial hosts, could fit his  angelic majesty to the likeness of a man, Trevennack--could not Satan  meet him on his own ground, and try to thwart him as of old in the  likeness of a man, Walter Tyrrel--his dear boy's murderer.    
As far as Exeter this was his one train of thought. But from there to  Plymouth new passengers got in. They turned the current. Trevennack  changed his mind rapidly. Another mood came over him. His wife's words  struck him vaguely in some tenderer place. "Fight the devil <i>within</i>  you, Michael. Fight him there, and conquer him." That surely was  fitter far for an angelic nature. That foeman was worthier his  celestial steel. "Turn homeward, angel, now, and melt with ruth!" Not  his to do vengeance on the man Walter Tyrrel. Not his to play the  divine part of vindicator. In his madness even Trevennack was  magnanimous. Leave the creature to the torment of his own guilty soul.  Do angels care for thrusts of such as he? Tantaene animis coelestibus  irae?    
At Ivybridge station the train slowed, and then stopped. Trevennack,  accustomed to the Cornish express, noted the stoppage with surprise.  "We're not down to pull up here!" he said, quickly, to the guard.    
"No sir," the guard answered, touching his hat with marked respect,  for he knew the Admiralty official well. "Signals are against us.  Line's blocked as far as Plymouth."    
"I'll get out here, then," Trevennack said, in haste; and the guard  opened the door. A new idea had rushed suddenly into the madman's  head. This was St. Michael's Day--his own day; and there was St.  Michael's Tor--his own tor--full in sight before him. He would go up  there this very evening, and before the eyes of all the world, in his  celestial armor, taking Lucy's advice, do battle with and quell this  fierce devil within him.    
No sooner thought than done. Fiery hot within, he turned out of the  gate, and as the shades of autumn evening began to fall, walked  swiftly up the moor toward the tor and the uplands.    
As he walked his heart beat to a lilting rhythm within him. "Go,  Michael, of celestial armies prince!--Go, Michael!--Go, Michael! Go,  Michael, of celestial armies prince--Go, Michael!--Go, Michael!"    
The moor was draped in fog. It was a still, damp evening. Swirling  clouds rose slowly up, and lifted at times and disclosed the peaty  hollows, the high tors, the dusky heather. But Trevennack stumbled on,  o'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, as chance  might lead him, clambering ever toward his goal, now seen, now  invisible--the great stack of wild rock that crowned the gray  undulating moor to northward. Often he missed his way; often he  floundered for awhile in deep ochreous bottoms, up to his knees in  soft slush, but with some strange mad instinct he wandered on  nevertheless, and slowly drew near the high point he was aiming at.    
By this time it was pitch dark. The sun had set and fog obscured the  starlight. But Trevennack, all on fire, wandered madly forward and  scaled the rocky tor by the well-known path, guided not by sight, but  by pure instinctive groping. In his present exalted state, indeed, he  had no need of eyes. What matters earthly darkness to angelic feet? He  could pick his own way through the gloom, though all the fiends from  hell in serried phalanx broke loose to thwart him. He would reach the  top at last; reach the top; reach the top, and there fight that old  serpent who lay in wait to destroy him. At last he gained the peak,  and stood with feet firmly planted on the little rocky platform. Now,  Satan, come on! Ha, traitor, come, if you dare! Your antagonist is  ready for you!    
Cr'r'r'k! as he stood there, waiting, a terrible shock brought him to  himself all at once with startling suddenness. Trevennack drew back  aghast and appalled. Even in his mad exaltation this strange assault  astonished him. He had expected a struggle, indeed; he had expected a  conflict, but with a spiritual foe; to meet his adversary in so bodily  a form as this, wholly startled and surprised him. For it was a fierce  earthly shock he received upon his right leg as he mounted the rocky  platform. Satan had been lying in wait for him then, expecting him,  waylaying him, and in corporeal presence too. For this was a spear of  good steel! This was a solid Thing that assaulted him as he rose--  assaulted him with frantic rage and uncontrollable fury!    
For a moment Trevennack was stunned--the sharpness of the pain and the  suddenness of the attack took both breath and sense away from him. He  stood there one instant, irresolute, before he knew how to comport  himself. But before he could make up his mind--cr'r'k, a second time--  the Presence had assailed him again, fighting with deadly force, and  in a white heat of frenzy. Trevennack had no leisure to think what  this portent might mean. Man or fiend, it was a life-and-death  struggle now between them. He stood face to face at last in mortal  conflict with his materialized enemy. What form the Evil Thing had  assumed to suit his present purpose Trevennack knew not, nor did he  even care. Stung with pain and terror he rushed forward blindly upon  his enraged assailant, and closed with him at once, tooth and nail, in  a deadly grapple.    
A more terrible battle man and brute never fought. Trevennack had no  sword, no celestial panoply. But he could wrestle like a Cornishman.  He must trample his foe under foot, then, in this final struggle, by  sheer force of strong thews and strained muscles alone. He fought the  Creature as it stood, flinging his arms round it wildly. The Thing  seemed to rear itself as if on cloven hoofs. Trevennack seized it  round the waist, and grasping it hard in an iron grip, clung to it  with all the wild energy of madness. Yield, Satan, yield! But still  the Creature eluded him. Once more it drew back a pace--he felt its  hot breath, he smelt its hateful smell--and prepared to rush again at  him. Trevennack bent down to receive its attack, crouching. The  Creature burst full tilt on him--it almost threw him over. Trevennack  caught it in his horror and awe--caught it bodily by the horns--for  horned it seemed to be, as well as cloven-footed--and by sheer force  of arm held it off from him an elbow's length one minute. The Thing  struggled and reared again. Yes, yes, it was Satan--he felt him all  over now--a devil undisguised--but Satan rather in medieval than in  Miltonic fashion. His skin was rough and hairy as a satyr's; his odor  was foul; his feet were cleft; his horns sharp and terrible. He flung  him from him horrified.    
Quick as lightning the demon rose again, and tilted fiercely at him  once more. It was a death fight between those two for that rocky  platform. Should Satan thus usurp St. Michael's Tor? Ten thousand  times, no! Yield, yield! No surrender! Each knew the ground well, and  even in the dark and in the mad heat of the conflict, each carefully  avoided the steep edge of the precipice. But the fiend knew it best,  apparently. He had been lying in a snug nook, under lee of a big rock,  sharpening his sword on its side, before Trevennack came up there.  Against this rock he took his stand, firm as a rock himself, and  seemed to defy his enemy's arms to dislodge him from his position.    
Trevennack's hands and legs were streaming now with blood. His left  arm was sorely wounded. His thumb hung useless. But with the strange  energy of madness he continued the desperate conflict against his  unseen foe. Never should Michael turn and yield to the deadly assaults  of the Evil One! He rushed on blindly once more, and the Adversary  stooped to oppose him. Again, a terrible shock, it almost broke both  his knees; but by sheer strength of nerve he withstood it, still  struggling. Then they closed in a final grapple. It was a tooth-and-  nail conflict. They fought one another with every weapon they  possessed; each hugged each in their fury; they tilted, and tore, and  wrestled, and bit, and butted.    
Trevennack's coat was in ribbons, his arm was ripped and bleeding; but  he grasped the Adversary still, he fought blindly to the end. Down,  Satan, I defy thee!    
It was a long, fierce fight! At last, bit by bit, the Enemy began to  yield. Trevennack had dashed him against the crag time after time like  a log, till he too was torn and hurt and bleeding. His flesh was like  pulp. He could endure the unequal fight no longer. He staggered and  gave way. A great joy rose up tremulous in Trevennack's heart. Even  without his celestial sword, then, he had vanquished his enemy. He  seized the Creature round the middle, dragged it, a dead weight, in  his weary arms, to the edge of the precipice, and dropped it, feebly  resisting, on to the bare rock beneath him.    
Victory! Victory! Once more, a great victory!    
He stood on the brink of the tor, and poised himself, as if for  flight, in his accustomed attitude. But he was faint from loss of  blood, and his limbs shook under him.    
A light seemed to break before his blinded eyes. Victory! Victory! It  was the light from heaven! He stared forward to welcome it. The brink  of the precipice? What was <i>that</i> to such as he? He would spread his  wings--for once--at last--thus! thus! and fly forward on full pinions  to his expected triumph!    
He raised both arms above his head, and spread them out as if for  flight. His knees trembled fearfully. His fingers quivered. Then he  launched himself on the air and fell. His eyes closed half-way. He  lost consciousness. He fainted. Before he had reached the bottom he  was wholly insensible.    
Next day it was known before noon in London that a strange and  inexplicable accident had befallen Mr. Michael Trevennack C.M.G., the  well-known Admiralty official, on the moor near Ivybridge. Mr.  Trevennack, it seemed, had started by the Cornish express for  Falmouth, on official business; but the line being blocked between  Ivybridge and Plymouth, he had changed his plans and set out to walk,  as was conjectured, by a devious path across the moor to Tavistock.  Deceased knew the neighborhood well, and was an enthusiastic admirer  of its tors and uplands. But fog coming on, the unfortunate gentleman,  it was believed, had lost his way, and tried to shelter himself for a  time behind a tall peak of rock which he used frequently to visit  during his summer holidays. There he was apparently attacked by a  savage moorland ram--one of that wild breed of mountain sheep peculiar  to Dartmoor, and famous for the strength and ferocity often displayed  by the fathers of the flock. Mr. Trevennack was unarmed, and a  terrible fight appeared to have taken place between these ill-matched  antagonists on the summit of the rocks, full details of which, the  Telegram said in its curt business-like way, were too ghastly for  publication. After a long and exhausting struggle, however, the  combatants must either have slipped on the wet surface and tumbled  over the edge of the rocks together in a deadly grapple, or else, as  seemed more probable from the positions in which the bodies were  found, the unhappy gentleman had just succeeded in flinging his  assailant over, and then, faint from loss of blood, had missed his  footing and fallen beside his dead antagonist. At any rate, when the  corpse was discovered life had been extinct for several hours; and it  was the opinion of the medical authorities who conducted the post-  mortem that death was due not so much to the injuries themselves as to  asphyxiation in the act of falling.    
* * *    
The jury found it "Death from accidental circumstances." Cleer never  knew more than that her father had met his end by walking over the  edge of a cliff on Dartmoor.    
* * *    
But when the body came home for burial, Dr. Yate-Westbury looked in by  Mrs. Trevennack's special request, and performed an informal and  private examination of the brain and nervous system. At the close of  the autopsy he came down to the drawing-room where the silver-haired  lady sat pale and tearful, but courageous. "It is just as I thought,"  he said; "a clot of blood, due to external injury, has pressed for  years above the left frontal region, causing hallucinations and  irregularities of a functional character only. You needn't have the  slightest fear of its proving hereditary. It's as purely accidental as  a sprain or a wound. Your daughter, Mrs. Le Neve, couldn't possibly  suffer for it."    
And neither Cleer nor Le Neve nor anyone else ever shared that secret  of Trevennack's delusions with his wife and the doctor.
