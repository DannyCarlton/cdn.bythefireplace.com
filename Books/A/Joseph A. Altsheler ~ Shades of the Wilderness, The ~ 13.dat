  The little dinner ended. Despite his disapproval of General Early's  swearing, General Lee laughed heartily at further details of the  strange Yankee spy's exploits. But it was well known that in this  particular General Early was the champion of the East. Harry did not  know that in the person of Colonel Charles Woodville, his cousin, Dick  Mason, had encountered one of equal ability in the Southwest.
  Presently General Lee and his two young aides mounted their horses  for the return. The commander-in-chief seemed gayer than usual. He was  always very fond of Stuart, whose high spirits pleased him, and before  his departure he thanked him for his thoughtfulness.
  &#8220;Whenever we get any particularly choice shipments from the North I  shall always be pleased to notify you, General, and send you your  share,&#8221; said Stuart, sweeping the air in front of him again with his  great plumed hat. With his fine, heroic face and his gorgeous uniform  he had never looked more a knight of the Middle Ages.
  General Lee smiled and thanked him again, and then rode soberly  back, followed at a short distance by his two young aides. Although the  view of hills and mountains and valleys and river and brooks was now  magnificent, the sumach burning in red and the leaves vivid in many  colors, Lee, deeply sensitive, like all his rural forbears, to rural  beauty, nevertheless seemed not to notice it, and soon sank into deep  thought.
  It is believed by many that Lee knew then that the Confederacy had  already received a mortal blow. It was not alone sufficient for the  South to win victories. She must keep on winning them, and the failure  at Gettysburg and the defeat at Vicksburg had put her on the defensive  everywhere. Fewer blockade runners were getting through. Above all,  there was less human material upon which to draw. But he roused himself  presently and said to Harry:
  &#8220;There was something humorous in the exploits of the man who held up  General Early's messengers, but the fellow is dangerous, exceedingly  dangerous at such a time.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've an idea who he is, sir,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;Indeed! What do you know?&#8221;
  Then Harry told nearly all that he knew about Shepard, but not all&#8212;  that struggle in the river, and his sparing of the spy and the filching  of the map at the Curtis house, for instance&#8212;and the  commander-in-chief listened with great attention.
  &#8220;A bold man, uncommonly bold, and it appears uncommonly skilled,  too. We must send out a general alarm, that is, we must have all our  own scouts and spies watching for him.&#8221;
  Harry said nothing, but he did not believe that anybody would catch  Shepard. The man's achievements had been so startling that they had  created the spell of invincibility. His old belief that he was worth  ten thousand men on the Northern battle line returned. No movement of  the Army of Northern Virginia could escape him, and no lone messenger  could ever be safe from him.
  Lee returned to his camp on Clarke's Mountain, and, a great revival  meeting being in progress, he joined it, sitting with a group of  officers. Fitzhugh Lee, W. H. F. Lee, Jones, Rosser, Wickham, Munford,  Young, Wade Hampton and a dozen others were there. Taylor and Marshall  and Peyton of his staff were also in the company.
  The preacher was a man of singular power and earnestness, and after  the sermon he led the singing himself, in which often thirty or forty  thousand voices joined. It was a moving sight to Harry, all these men,  lads, mostly, but veterans of many fields, united in a chorus mightier  than any other that he had ever heard. It would have pleased Stonewall  Jackson to his inmost soul, and once more, as always, a tear rose to  his eye as he thought of his lost hero.
  Harry and Dalton left their horses with an orderly and came back to  the edge of the great grove, in which the meeting was being held. They  had expected to find St. Clair and Happy Tom there, but not seeing  them, wandered on and finally drifted apart. Harry stood alone for a  while on the outskirts of the throng. They were all singing again, and  the mighty volume of sound rolled through the wood. It was not only a  singular, it was a majestic scene also to Harry. How like unto little  children young soldiers were! and how varied and perplexing were the  problems of human nature! They were singing with the utmost fervor of  Him who had preached continuously of peace, who was willing to turn one  cheek when the other was smitten, and because of their religious zeal  they would rush the very next day into battle, if need be, with  increased fire and zeal.
  He saw a heavily built, powerful man on the outskirts, but some  distance away, singing in a deep rolling voice, but something vaguely  familiar in the figure drew his glance again. He looked long and well  and then began to edge quietly toward the singer, who was clothed in  the faded butternut uniform that so many of the Confederate soldiers  wore.
  The fervor of the singer did not decrease, but Harry noticed that he  too was moving, moving slowly toward the eastern end of the grove, the  same direction that Harry was pursuing. Now he was sure. He would have  called out, but his voice would not have been heard above the vast  volume of sound. He might have pointed out the singer to others, but,  although he felt sure, he did not wish to be laughed at in case of  mistake. But strongest of all was the feeling that it had become a duel  between Shepard and himself.
  He walked slowly on, keeping the man in view, but Shepard, although  he never ceased singing, moved away at about the same pace. Harry  inferred at once that Shepard had seen him and was taking precautions.  The temptation to cry out at the top of his voice that the most  dangerous of all spies was among them was almost irresistible, but it  would only create an uproar in which Shepard could escape easily,  leaving to him a load of ridicule.
  He continued his singular pursuit. Shepard was about a hundred yards  away, and they had made half the circuit of this huge congregation.  Then the spy passed into a narrow belt of pines, and when Harry moved  forward to see him emerge on the other side he failed to reappear. He  hastened to the pines, which led some distance down a little gully, and  he was sure that Shepard had gone that way. He followed fast, but he  could discover no sign. He had vanished utterly, like thin smoke swept  away by a breeze.
  He returned deeply stirred by the appearance and  disappearance&#8212;easy, alike&#8212;of Shepard. His sense of the man's uncanny  powers and of his danger to the Confederacy was increased. He seemed to  come and go absolutely as he pleased. It was true that in the American  Civil War the opportunities for spies were great. All men spoke the  same language, and all looked very much alike. It was not such a hard  task to enter the opposing lines, but Shepard had shown a daring and  success beyond all comparison. He seemed to have both the seven league  boots and the invisible cloak of very young childhood. He came as he  pleased, and when pursuit came he vanished in thin air.
  Harry bit his lips in chagrin. He felt that Shepard had scored on  him again. It was true that he had been victorious in that fight in the  river, when victory meant so much, but since then Shepard had  triumphed, and it was bitter. He hardened his determination, and  resolved that he would always be on the watch for him. He even felt a  certain glow, because he was one of two in such a conflict of skill and  courage.
  The meeting having been finished, he went down one of the streets of  tents to the camp of the Invincibles. Colonel Leonidas Talbot and  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire were not playing chess. Instead  they were sitting on a pine log with Happy Tom and St. Clair and other  officers, listening to young Julien de Langeais, who sat on another  log, playing a violin with surpassing skill. Lieutenant-Colonel St.  Hilaire, knowing his prowess as a violinist, had asked him to come and  play for the Invincibles. Now he was playing for them and for several  thousand more who were gathered in the pine woods.
  Young de Langeais sat on a low stump, and the great crowd made a  solid mass around him. But he did not see them, nor the pine woods nor  the heavy cannon sitting on the ridges. He looked instead into a region  of fancy, where the colors were brilliant or gay or tender as he  imagined them. Harry, with no technical knowledge of music but with a  great love of it, recognized at once the touch of a master, and what  was more, the soul of one.
  To him the violin was not great, unless the player was great, but  when the player was great it was the greatest musical instrument of  all. He watched de Langeais' wrapt face, and for him too the thousands  of soldiers, the pines and the cannon on the ridges melted away. He did  not know what the young musician was playing, probably some old French  air or a great lyric outburst of the fiery Verdi, whose music had  already spread through America.
  &#8220;A great artist,&#8221; whispered Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire in his  ear. &#8220;He studied at the schools in New Orleans and then for two years  in Paris. But he came back to fight. Nothing could keep Julien from the  army, but he brought his violin with him. We Latins, or at least we who  are called Latins, steep our souls in music. It's not merely  intellectual with us. It's passion, fire, abandonment, triumph and all  the great primitive emotions of the human race.&#8221;
  Harry's feelings differed somewhat from those of Lieutenant-Colonel  St. Hilaire&#8212;in character but not in power&#8212;and as young de Langeais  played on he began to think what a loss a stray bullet could make. Why  should a great artist be allowed to come on the battle line? There were  hundreds of thousands of common men. One could replace another, but  nobody could replace the genius, a genius in which the whole world  shared. It was not possible for either drill or training to do it, and  yet a little bullet might take away his life as easily as it would that  of a plowboy. They were all alike to the bullets and the shells.
  De Langeais finished, and a great shout of applause arose. The  cheering became so insistent that he was compelled to play again.
  &#8220;His family is well-to-do,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire just  before he began playing once more, &#8220;and they'll see that he goes back  to Paris for study as soon as the war is over. If they didn't I would.&#8221;
  It did not seem to occur to Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire that  young de Langeais could be killed, and Harry began to share his  confidence. De Langeais now played the simple songs of the old South,  and there was many a tear in the eyes of war-hardened youth. The sun  was setting in a sea of fire, and the pine forests turned red in its  blaze. In the distance the waters of the Rapidan were crimson, too, and  a light wind out of the west sighed among the pines, forming a subdued  chorus to the violin.
  De Langeais began to play a famous old song of home, and Harry's  mind traveled back on its lingering note to his father's beautiful  house and grounds, close by Pendleton, and all the fine country about  it, in which he and Dick Mason and the boys of their age had roamed. He  remembered all the brooks and ponds and the groves that produced the  best hickory nuts. When should he see them again and would his father  be there, and Dick, and all the other boys of their age! Not all!  Certainly not all, because some were gone already. And yet this  plaintive note of the homes they had left behind, while it brought a  tear to many an eye, made no decrease in martial determination. It  merely hardened their resolution to win the victory all the sooner, and  bring the homecoming march nearer.
  De Langeais ended on a wailing note that died like a faint sigh in  the pine forest. Then he came back to earth, sprang up, and put his  violin in its case. Applause spread out and swelled in a low,  thunderous note, but de Langeais, who was as modest as he was talented,  quickly hid himself among his friends.
  The sun sank behind the blue mountains, and twilight came readily  over the pine and cedar forests. Colonel Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel  St. Hilaire, who had a large tent together, invited the youths to stay  awhile with them as their guests and talk. All the soldiers dispersed  to their own portions of the great camp, and there would be an hour of  quiet and rest, until the camp cooks served supper.
  It had been a lively day for Harry, his emotions had been much  stirred, and now he was glad to sit in the peace of the evening on a  stone near the entrance of the tent, and listen to his friends. War  drew comrades together in closer bonds than those of peace. He was  quite sure that St. Clair, Dalton and Happy Tom were his friends for  life, as he was theirs, and the two colonels seemed to have the same  quality of youth. Simple men, of high faith and honor, they were often  childlike in the ways of the world, their horizons sometimes not so  wide as those of the lads who now sat with them.
  &#8220;As I told Harry,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire to Julien,  &#8220;you shall have that talent of yours cultivated further after the war.  Two years more of study and you will be among the greatest. You must  know, lads, that for us who are of French descent, Paris is the world's  capital in the arts.&#8221;
  &#8220;And for many of English blood, too,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot.
  Then they talked of more immediate things, of the war, the armies  and the prospect of the campaigns. Harry, after an hour or so, returned  to headquarters and he found soldiers making a bed for the  commander-in- chief under the largest of the pines. Lee in his  campaigns always preferred to sleep in the open air, when he could, and  it required severe weather to drive him to a tent. Meanwhile he sat by  a small fire&#8212; the October nights were growing cold&#8212;and talked with  Peyton and other members of his staff.
  Harry and Dalton decided to imitate his example and sleep between  the blankets under the pines. Harry found a soft place, spread his  blankets and in a few minutes slept soundly. In fact, the whole Army of  Northern Virginia was a great family that retired early, slept well and  rose early.
  The next morning there was frost on the grass, but the lads were so  hardy that they took no harm. The autumn deepened. The leaves blazed  for a while in their most vivid colors and then began to fall under the  strong west winds. Brown and wrinkled, they often whirled past in  clouds. The air had a bite in it, and the soldiers built more and  larger fires.
  The Army of Northern Virginia never before had been quiescent so  long. The Army of the Potomac was not such a tremendous distance away,  but it seemed that neither side was willing to attack, and as the  autumn advanced and began to merge into winter the minds of all turned  toward the Southwest.
  For the valiant soldiers encamped on the Virginia hills the news was  not good. Grant, grim and inflexible, was deserving the great name that  was gradually coming to him. He had gathered together all the broken  parts of the army defeated at Chickamauga and was turning Union defeat  into Union victory.
  Winter closed in with the knowledge that Grant had defeated the  South disastrously on Lookout Mountain and all around Chattanooga.  Chickamauga had gone for nothing, the whole flank of the Confederacy  was turned and the Army of Northern Virginia remained the one great  barrier against the invading legions of the North. Yet the confidence  of the men in that army remained undimmed. They felt that on their own  ground, and under such a man as Lee, they were invincible.
  In the course of these months Harry, as a messenger and often as a  secretary, was very close to Lee. He wrote a swift and clear hand, and  took many dispatches. Almost daily messages were sent in one direction  or another and Harry read from them the thoughts of his leader, which  he kept locked in his breast. He knew perhaps better than many an older  officer the precarious condition of the Confederacy. These letters,  which he took from dictation, and the letters from Richmond that he  read to his chief, told him too plainly that the limits of the  Confederacy were shrinking. Its money declined steadily. Happy Tom said  that he had to &#8220;swap it pound for pound now to the sutlers for  groceries.&#8221; Yet it is the historical truth that the heart of the Army  of Northern Virginia never beat with more fearless pride, as the famous  and &#8220;bloody&#8221; year of '63 was drawing to its close.
  The news arrived that Grant, the Sledge Hammer of the West, had been  put by Lincoln in command of all the armies of the Union, and would  come east to lead the Army of the Potomac in person, with Meade still  as its nominal chief, but subject, like all the others, to his command.
  Harry heard the report with a thrill. He knew now that decisive  action would come soon enough. He had always felt that Meade in front  of them was a wavering foe, and perhaps too cautious. But Grant was of  another kind. He was a pounder. Defeats did not daunt him. He would  attack and then attack again and again, and the diminishing forces of  the Confederacy were ill fitted to stand up against the continued blows  of the hammer. Harry's thrill was partly of apprehension, but whenever  he looked at the steadfast face of his chief his confidence returned.
  Winter passed without much activity and spring began to show its  first buds. The earth was drying, after melting snows and icy rains,  and Harry knew that action would not be delayed much longer. Grant was  in the East now. He had gone in January to St. Louis to visit his  daughter, who lay there very ill, and then, after military delays, he  had reached Washington.
  Harry afterward heard the circumstances of his arrival, so  characteristic of plain and republican America. He came into Washington  by train as a simple passenger, accompanied only by his son, who was  but fourteen years of age. They were not recognized, and arriving at a  hotel, valise in hand, with a crowd of passengers, he registered in his  turn: &#8220;U. S. Grant and son, Galena, Ill.&#8221; The clerk, not noticing the  name, assigned the modest arrival and his boy to a small room on the  fifth floor. Then they moved away, a porter carrying the valise. But  the clerk happened to look again at the register, and when he saw more  clearly he rushed after them with a thousand apologies. He did not  expect the victor of great battles, the lieutenant-general commanding  all the armies of the Union, a battle front of more than a million men,  to come so modestly.
  When Harry heard the story he liked it. It seemed to him to be the  same simple and manly quality that he found in Lee, both worthy of  republican institutions. But he did not have time to think about it  long. The signs were multiplying that the advance would soon come. The  North had never ceased to resound with preparations, and Grant would  march with veterans. All the spies and scouts brought in the same  report. Butler would move up from Fortress Monroe toward Richmond with  thirty thousand men and Grant with a hundred and fifty thousand would  cross the Rapidan, moving by the right flank of Lee until they could  unite and destroy the Confederacy. Such was the plan, said the scouts  and spies in gray.
  Longstreet with his corps had returned from the West and Lee  gathered his force of about sixty thousand men to meet the mighty  onslaught&#8212;he alone perhaps divined how mighty it would be&#8212;and when he  was faced by the greatest of his adversaries his genius perhaps never  shone more brightly.
  May and the full spring came. It was the third day of the month, and  the camp of the Army of Northern Virginia was as usual. Many of the  young soldiers played games among the trees. Here and there they lay in  groups on the new grass, singing their favorite songs. The cooks were  preparing their suppers over the big fires. Several bands were playing.  Had it not been for the presence of so many weapons the whole might  have been taken for one vast picnic, but Harry, who sat in the tent of  the commander-in-chief, was writing as fast as he could dispatch after  dispatch that the Southern leader was dictating to him. He knew  perfectly well, of course, that the commander-in-chief was gathering  his forces and that they would move quickly for battle. He knew, too,  how inadequate was the equipment of the army. Only a short time before  he had taken from the dictation of his chief a letter to the President  of the Confederacy a part of which ran:
  My anxiety on the subject of provisions for the army is so great  that I cannot refrain from expressing it to your Excellency. I cannot  see how we can operate with our present supplies. Any derangement in  their arrival or disaster to the railroad would render it impossible  for me to keep the army together and might force a retreat into North  Carolina. There is nothing to be had in this section for men or  animals. We have rations for the troops to-day and to-morrow. I hope a  new supply arrived last night, but I have not yet had a report.
  Harry had thought long over this letter and he knew from his own  observation its absolute truth. The depleted South was no longer able  to feed its troops well. The abundance of the preceding autumn had  quickly passed, and in winter they were mostly on half rations.
  Lee, better than any other man in the whole South, had understood  what lay before them, and his foes both of the battlefield and of the  spirit have long since done him justice. Less than a week before this  eve of mighty events he had written to a young woman in Virginia, a  relative:
  I dislike to send letters within reach of the enemy, as they might  serve, if captured, to bring distress on others. But you must sometimes  cast your thoughts on the Army of Northern Virginia, and never forget  it in your prayers. It is preparing for a great struggle, but I pray  and trust that the great God, mighty to deliver, will spread over it  His Almighty arms and drive its enemies before it.
  Harry had seen this letter before its sending, and he was not  surprised now when Lee was sending messengers to all parts of his army.  With all the hero-worshiping quality of youth he was once more deeply  grateful that he should have served on the staffs and been brought into  close personal relations with two men, Stonewall Jackson and Lee, who  seemed to him so great. As he saw it, it was not alone military  greatness but greatness of the soul, which was greater. Both were  deeply religious&#8212; Lee, the Episcopalian, and Jackson, the  Presbyterian, and it was a piety that contained no trace of cant.
  Harry felt that the crisis of the great Civil War was at hand. It  had been in the air all that day, and news had come that Grant had  broken up his camps and was crossing the Rapidan with a huge force. He  knew how small in comparison was the army that Lee could bring against  him, and yet he had supreme confidence in the military genius of his  chief.
  He had written a letter with which an aide had galloped away, and  then he sat at the little table in the great tent, pen in hand and ink  and paper before him, but Lee was silent. He was dressed as usual with  great neatness and care, though without ostentation. His face had its  usual serious cast, but tinged now with melancholy. Harry knew that he  no longer saw the tent and those around him. His mind dwelled for a few  moments upon his own family and the ancient home that he had loved so  well.
  The interval was very brief. He was back in the present, and the  principal generals for whom he had sent were entering the tent. Hill,  Longstreet, Ewell, Stuart and others came, but they did not stay long.  They talked earnestly with their leader for a little while, and then  every one departed to lead his brigades.
  The secretaries put away pen, ink and paper. Twilight was advancing  in the east and night suddenly fell outside. The songs ceased, the  bands played no more, and there was only the deep rumble of marching  men and moving cannon.
  &#8220;We'll ride now, gentlemen,&#8221; said Lee to his staff.
  Traveller, saddled and bridled, was waiting and the  commander-in-chief sprang into the saddle with all the agility of a  young man. The others mounted, too, Harry and Dalton as usual taking  their places modestly in the rear.
  A regiment, small in numbers but famous throughout the army for  valor, was just passing, and its colonel and its lieutenant-colonel,  erect men, riding splendidly, but gray like Lee, drew their swords and  gave the proud and flashing salute of the saber as they went by. Lee  and his staff almost with involuntary impulse returned the salute in  like fashion. Then the Invincibles passed on, and were lost from view  in the depths of the forest.
  Harry felt a sudden constriction of the heart. He knew that he might  never see Colonel Leonidas Talbot nor Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire again, nor St. Clair, nor Happy Tom either.
  But his friends could not remain long in his mind at such a time.  They were marching, marching swiftly, the presence of the man on the  great white horse seeming to urge them on to greater speed. As the  stars came out Lee's brow, which had been seamed by thought, cleared.  His plan which he had formed in the day was moving well. His three  corps were bearing away toward the old battlefield of Chancellorsville.  Grant would be drawn into the thickets of the Wilderness as Hooker had  been the year before, although a greater than Hooker was now leading  the Army of the Potomac.
  Harry, who foresaw it all, thrilled and shuddered at the  remembrance. It was in there that the great Jackson had fallen in the  hour of supreme triumph. Not far away were the heights of  Fredericksburg, where Burnside had led the bravest of the brave to  unavailing slaughter. As Belgium had been for centuries the cockpit of  Europe, so the wild and sterile region in Virginia that men call the  Wilderness became the cockpit of North America.
  While Lee and his army were turning into the Wilderness Grant and  the greatest force that the Union had yet assembled were seeking him.  It was composed of men who had tasted alike of victory and defeat,  veterans skilled in all the wiles and stratagems of war, and with  hearts to endure anything. In this host was a veteran regiment that had  come East to serve under Grant as it had served under him so valiantly  in the West. Colonel Winchester rode at its head and beside him rode  his favorite aide, young Richard Mason. Not far away was Colonel  Hertford, with a numerous troop of splendid cavalry.
  Grant, alert and resolved to win, carried in his pocket a letter  which he had received from Lincoln, saying:
  Not expecting to see you before the spring campaign opens, I wish to  express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up  to this time, so far as I understand it. The particulars of your plans  I neither know nor seek to know. You are vigilant and self-reliant,  and, pleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any constraints or  restraints upon you. While I am very anxious that any great disaster or  the capture of our men in great numbers should be avoided, I know these  points are less likely to escape your attention than they would mine.  If there is anything wanting which is within my power to give, do not  fail to let me know it. And now, with a brave army and a just cause,  may God sustain you.
  A noble letter, breathing the loftiest spirit, and showing that  moral grandeur which has been so characteristic of America's greatest  men. He had put all in Grant's hands and he had given to him an army,  the like of which had never been seen until now on the American  continent. Never before had the North poured forth its wealth and  energy in such abundance.
  Four thousand wagons loaded with food and ammunition followed the  army, and there was a perfect system by which a wagon emptied of its  contents was sent back to a depot to be refilled, while a loaded wagon  took its place at the front. Complete telegram equipments, poles,  wires, instruments and all were carried with every division. The wires  could be strung easily and the lieutenant-general could talk to every  part of his army. There were, also, staffs of signalmen, in case the  wires should fail at any time. Grant held in his hand all the resources  of the North, and if he could not win no one could.
  All through the night the hostile armies marched, and before them  went the spies and scouts.
