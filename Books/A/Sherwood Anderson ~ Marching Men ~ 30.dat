All through the early months of that year in Chicago, rumours of a new  and not understandable movement among labourers ran about among men of  affairs. In a way the labourers understood the undercurrent of terror  their marching together had inspired and like the advertising man  dancing on the sidewalk before the grocery were made happy by it. Grim  satisfaction dwelt in their hearts. Remembering their boyhoods and the  creeping terror that invaded their fathers' houses in times of  depression they were glad to spread terror among the homes of the rich  and the well-to-do. For years they had been going through life  blindly, striving to forget age and poverty. Now they felt that life  had a purpose, that they were marching toward some end. When in the  past they had been told that power dwelt in them they had not  believed. "He is not to be trusted," thought the man at the machine  looking at the man at work at the next machine. "I have heard him talk  and at bottom he is a fool."    
Now the man at the machine did not think of his brother at the next  machine. In his dreams at night he was beginning to have a new vision.  Power had breathed its message into his brain. Of a sudden he saw  himself as a part of a giant walking in the world. "I am like a drop  of blood running through the veins of labour," he whispered to  himself. "In my own way I am adding strength to the heart and the  brain of labour. I have become a part of this thing that has begun to  move. I will not talk but will wait. If this marching is the thing  then I will march. Though I am weary at the end of the day that shall  not stop me. Many times I have been weary and was alone. Now I am a  part of something vast. This I know, that a consciousness of power has  crept into my brain and although I be persecuted I shall not surrender  what I have gained."    
In the offices of the plough trust a meeting of men of affairs was  called. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the movement going  on among the workers. At the plough works it had broken out. No more  at evening did the men shuffle along, like a disorderly mob but  marched in companies along the brick-paved street that ran by the  factory door.    
At the meeting David Ormsby had been as always quiet and self-  possessed. A halo of kindly intent hung over him and when a banker,  one of the directors of the company, had finished a speech he arose  and walked up and down, his hands thrust into his trousers pockets.  The banker was a fat man with thin brown hair and delicate hands. As  he talked he held a pair of yellow gloves and beat with them on a long  table at the centre of the room. The soft thump of the gloves upon the  table made a chorus to the things he had to say. David motioned for  him to be seated. "I will myself go to see this McGregor," he said,  walking across the room and putting an arm about the shoulder of the  banker. "Perhaps there is as you say a new and terrible danger here  but I do not think so. For thousands, no doubt for millions of years,  the world has gone on its way and I do not think it is to be stopped  now.    
"It has been my fortune to see and to know this McGregor," added David  smiling at the others in the room. "He is a man and not a Joshua to  make the sun stand still."    
In the office in Van Buren Street, David, the grey and confident,  stood before the desk at which sat McGregor. "We will get out of here  if you do not mind," he said. "I want to talk to you and I would not  like being interrupted. I have a fancy that we talk out of doors."    
The two men went in a street car to Jackson Park and, forgetting to  dine, walked for an hour along the paths under the trees. The wind  from the lake had chilled the air and the park was deserted.    
They went to stand on a pier that ran out into the lake. On the pier  David tried to begin the talk that was the object of their being  together but felt that the wind and the water that beat against the  piling of the pier made talk too difficult. Although he could not have  told why, he was relieved by the necessity of delay. Into the park  they went again and found a seat upon a bench facing a lagoon.    
In the presence of the silent McGregor David felt suddenly embarrassed  and awkward. "By what right do I question him?" he asked himself and  in his mind could find no answer. A half dozen times he started to say  what he had come to say but stopped and his talk ran off into  trivialities. "There are men in the world you have not taken into  consideration," he said finally, forcing himself to begin. With a  laugh he went on, relieved that the silence had been broken. "You see  the very inner secret of strong men has been missed by you and  others."    
David Ormsby looked sharply at McGregor. "I do not believe that you  believe we are after money, we men of affairs. I trust you see beyond  that. We have our purpose and we keep to our purpose quietly and  doggedly."    
Again David looked at the silent figure sitting in the dim light and  again his mind ran out, striving to penetrate the silence. "I am not a  fool and perhaps I know that the movement you have started among the  workers is something new. There is power in it as in all great ideas.  Perhaps I think there is power in you. Why else should I be here?"    
Again David laughed uncertainly. "In a way I am in sympathy with you,"  he said. "Although all through my life I have served money I have not  been owned by it. You are not to suppose that men like me have not  something beyond money in mind."    
The old plough maker looked away over McGregor's shoulder to where the  leaves of the trees shook in the wind from the lake. "There have been  men and great leaders who have understood the silent competent  servants of wealth," he said half petulantly. "I want you to  understand these men. I should like to see you become such a one  yourself--not for the wealth it would bring but because in the end you  would thus serve all men. You would get at truth thus. The power that  is in you would be conserved and used more intelligently."    
"To be sure, history has taken little or no account of the men of whom  I speak. They have passed through life unnoticed, doing great work  quietly."    
The plough maker paused. Although McGregor had said nothing the older  man felt that the interview was not going as it should. "I should like  to know what you have in mind, what in the end you hope to gain for  yourself or for these men," he said somewhat sharply. "There is after  all no point to our beating about the bush."    
McGregor said nothing. Arising from the bench he began again to walk  along the path with Ormsby at his side.    
"The really strong men of the world have had no place in history,"  declared Ormsby bitterly. "They have not asked that. They were in Rome  and in Germany in the time of Martin Luther but nothing is said of  them. Although they do not mind the silence of history they would like  other strong men to understand. The march of the world is a greater  thing than the dust raised by the heels of some few workers walking  through the streets and these men are responsible for the march of the  world. You are making a mistake. I invite you to become one of us. If  you plan to upset things you may get yourself into history but you  will not really count. What you are trying to do will not work. You  will come to a bad end."    
When the two men emerged from the park the older man had again the  feeling that the interview had not been a success. He was sorry. The  evening he felt had marked for him a failure and he was not accustomed  to failures. "There is a wall here that I cannot penetrate," he  thought.    
Along the front of the park beneath a grove of trees they walked in  silence. McGregor seemed not to have heard the words addressed to him.  When they came to where a long row of vacant lots faced the park he  stopped and stood leaning against a tree to look away into the park,  lost in thought.    
David Ormsby also became silent. He thought of his youth in the little  village plough factory, of his efforts to get on in the world, of the  long evenings spent reading books and trying to understand the  movements of men.    
"Is there an element in nature and in youth that we do not understand  or that we lose sight of?" he asked. "Are the efforts of the patient  workers of the world always to be abortive? Can some new phase of life  arise suddenly upsetting all of our plans? Do you, can you, think of  men like me as but part of a vast whole? Do you deny to us  individuality, the right to stand forth, the right to work things out  and to control?"    
The ploughmaker looked at the huge figure standing beside the tree.  Again he was irritated and kept lighting cigars which after two or  three puffs he threw away. In the bushes at the back of the bench  insects began to sing. The wind coming now in gentle gusts swayed  slowly the branches of the trees overhead.    
"Is there an eternal youth in the world, a state out of which men pass  unknowingly, a youth that forever destroys, tearing down what has been  built?" he asked. "Are the mature lives of strong men of so little  account? Have you like the empty fields that bask in the sun in the  summer the right to remain silent in the presence of men who have had  thoughts and have tried to put their thoughts into deeds?"    
Still saying nothing McGregor pointed with his finger along the road  that faced the park. From a side street a body of men swung about a  corner, coming with long strides toward the two. As they passed  beneath a street lamp that swung gently in the wind their faces  flashing in and out of the light seemed to be mocking David Ormsby.  For a moment anger burned in him and then something, perhaps the  rhythm of the moving mass of men, brought a gentler mood. The men  swinging past turned another corner and disappeared beneath the  structure of an elevated railroad.    
The ploughmaker walked away from McGregor. Something in the interview,  terminating thus with, the presence of the marching figures had he  felt unmanned him. "After all there is youth and the hope of youth.  What he has in mind may work," he thought as he climbed aboard a  street car.    
In the car David put his head out at the window and looked at the long  line of apartment buildings that lined the streets. He thought again  of his own youth and of the evenings in the Wisconsin village when,  himself a youth, he went with other young men singing and marching in  the moonlight.    
In a vacant lot he again saw a body of the Marching Men moving back  and forth and responding quickly to the commands given by a slender  young man who stood on the sidewalk beneath a street lamp and held a  stick in his hand.    
In the car the grey-haired man of affairs put his head down upon the  back of the seat in front. Half unconscious of his own thoughts his  mind began to dwell upon the figure of his daughter. "Had I been  Margaret I should not have let him go. No matter what the cost I  should have clung to the man," he muttered.
