  For a moment the two men stood in silence, listening to the sullen   beat of surf beyond the black edge of forest. Then Philip led the  way  back into the cabin. 
  Gregson followed. In the light of the big oil-lamp which hung   suspended from the ceiling he noticed something in Whittemore's  face  he had not observed before, a tenseness about the muscles of  his  mouth, a restlessness in his eyes, rigidity of jaw, an air of   suppressed emotion which puzzled him. He was keenly observant of   details, and knew that these things had been missing a short time   before. The pleasure of their meeting that afternoon, after a   separation of nearly two years, had dispelled for a time the  trouble  which he now saw revealing itself in his companion's face  and  attitude, and the lightness of Whittemore's manner in  beginning his  explanation for inducing him to come into the north  had helped to  complete the mask. There occurred to him, for an  instant, a picture  which he had once drawn of Whittemore as he had  known him in certain  stirring times still fresh in the memory of  each&#8212;a picture of the  old, cool, irresistible Whittemore, smiling  in the face of danger,  laughing outright at perplexities, always  ready to fight with a  good-natured word on his lips. He had drawn  that picture for Burke's,  and had called it &quot;The Fighter.&quot; Burke  himself had criticized it  because of the smile. But Gregson knew  his man. It was Whittemore. 
  There was a change now. He had grown older, surprisingly older.   There were deeper lines about his eyes. His face was thinner. He  saw,  now, that Philip's lightness had been but a passing flash of  his old  buoyancy, that the old life and sparkle had gone from him.  Two years,  he judged, had woven things into Philip's life which he  could not  understand, and he wondered if this was why in all that  time he had  received no word from his old college chum. 
  They had seated themselves at opposite sides of the table, and   from an inside pocket Philip produced a small bundle of papers.  From  these he drew forth a map, which he smoothed out under his  hands. 
  &quot;Yes, there are possibilities&#8212;and more, Greggy,&quot; he said. &quot;I   didn't ask you up here to help me fight air and moonshine. And  I've  promised you a fight. Have you ever seen a rat in a trap with  a  blood-thirsty terrier guarding the little door that is about to  be  opened? Thrilling sport for the prisoner, isn't it? But when  the rat  happens to be human&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I thought it was a fish,&quot; protested Gregson, mildly. &quot;Pretty soon   you'll be having it a girl in a trap&#8212;or at the end of a fish-   line&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And if I should?&quot; interrupted Philip, looking steadily at him.   &quot;What if I should say there is a girl&#8212;a woman&#8212;in this trap&#8212;not   only one, but a score, a hundred of them? What then, Greggy?&quot; 
  &quot;I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.&quot; 
  &quot;And so there is, the biggest and most unusual scrap of its kind   you ever heard of, Greggy. It's going to be a queer kind of fight   &#8212;and queer fighting. And it's possible&#8212;very probable&#8212;that you  and  I will get lost in the shuffle somewhere. We're two, no more.  And  we're going up against forces which would make a dozen South  American  revolutions look like thirty cents. More than that, it's  likely we'll  be in the wrong locality when certain people rise in  a wrath which a  Helen of Troy aroused in another people some  centuries ago. See  here&#8212;&quot; 
  He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger. 
  &quot;See that red line? That's the new railroad to Hudson's Bay. It is   well above Le Pas now, and its builders plan to complete it by  next  spring. It is the most wonderful piece of railroad building  on the  American continent, Greggy&#8212;wonderful because it has been  neglected so  long. Something like a hundred million people have  been asleep to its  enormous value, and they're just waking up now.  That road, cutting  across four hundred miles of wilderness, is  opening up a country half  as big as the United States, in which  more mineral wealth will be dug  during the next fifty years than  will ever be taken from Yukon or  Alaska. It is shortening the  route from Montreal, Duluth, Chicago, and  the Middle West to  Liverpool and other European ports by a thousand  miles. It means  the making of a navigable sea out of Hudson's Bay,  cities on its  shores, and great steel-foundries close to the Arctic  Circle&#8212;  where there is coal and iron enough to supply the world for   hundreds of years. That's only a small part of what this road  means,  Greggy. Two years ago&#8212;you remember I asked you to join me  in the  adventure&#8212;I came up seeking opportunity. I didn't dream  then&#8212;&quot; 
  Whittemore paused, and a flash of his old smile passed over his   face. 
  &quot;I didn't dream that fate had decreed me to stir up what I'm going   to tell you about, Greggy. I followed the line of the proposed   railroad, looking for chances. All Canada was asleep, or too much   interested in its west, and gave me no competition. I was alone  west  of the surveyed line; east of it steel-corporation men had  optioned  mountains of iron and another interest had a grip on  coal-fields. Six  months I spent among the Indians, French, and  half-breeds. I lived  with them, trapped and hunted with them, and  picked up a little Cree  and French. The life suited me. I became a  northerner in heart and  soul, if not quite yet in full experience.  Clubs and balls and cities  grew to be only memories. You know how  I have always hated that  hothouse sort of existence, and you know  that same world of clubs and  balls and cities has gripped at my  throat, downing me again and again,  as though it returned my  sentiment with interest. Up here I learned to  hate it more than  ever. I was completely happy. And then&#8212;&quot; 
  He had refolded the map, and drew another from the bundle of   papers. It was drawn in pencil. 
  &quot;And then, Greggy,&quot; he went on, smoothing out this map where the   other had been, &quot;I struck my chance. It fairly clubbed me into   recognizing it. It came in the middle of the night, and I sat up  with  a camp-fire laughing at me through the flap in my tent,  stunned by the  knockout it had given me. It seemed, at first, as  though a gold-mine  had walked up and laid itself down at my feet,  and I wondered how  there could be so many silly fools in this  world of ours. Take a look  at that map, Greggy. What do you see?&quot; 
  Gregson had listened like one under a spell. It was one of his   careless boasts that situations could not faze him, that he was   immune to outward betrayals of sensation. This seeming   indifference&#8212;his light-toned attitude in the face of most serious   affairs would have made a failure of him in many things. But his   tense interest did not hide itself now. A cigarette remained   unlighted between his fingers. His eyes never took themselves for  an  instant from his companion's face. Something that Whittemore  had not  yet said thrilled him. He looked at the map. 
  &quot;There's not much to see,&quot; he said, &quot;but lakes and rivers.&quot; 
  &quot;You're right,&quot; exclaimed Philip, jumping suddenly from his chair   and beginning to walk back and forth across the cabin. &quot;Lakes and   rivers&#8212;hundreds of them&#8212;thousands of them! Greggy, there are  more  than three thousand lakes between here and civilization and  within  forty miles of the new railroad. And nine out of ten of  those lakes  are so full of fish that the bears along 'em smell  fishy. Whitefish,  Gregson&#8212;whitefish and trout. There is a fresh-  water area represented  on that map three times as large as the  whole of the five Great Lakes,  and yet the Canadians and the  government have never wakened up to what  it means. There's a fish  supply in this northland large enough to feed  the world, and that  little rim of lakes that I've mapped out along the  edge of the  coming railroad represents a money value of millions. That  was the  idea that came to me in the middle of the night, and then I   thought&#8212;if I could get a corner on a few of these lakes, secure   fishing privileges before the road came&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You'd be a millionaire,&quot; said Gregson. 
  &quot;Not only that,&quot; replied Philip, pausing for a moment in his   restless pacing. &quot;I didn't think of money, at first; at least, it  was  a secondary consideration after that night beside the camp-  fire. I  saw how this big vacant north could be made to strike a  mighty blow at  those interests which make a profession of  cornering meatstuffs on the  other side, how it could be made to  fight the fight of the people by  sending down an unlimited supply  of fish that could be sold at a  profit in New York, Boston, or  Chicago for a half of what the trust  demands. My scheme wasn't  aroused entirely by philanthropy, mind you.  I saw in it a chance  to get back at the very people who brought about  my father's ruin,  and who kept pounding him after he was in a corner  until he broke  down and died. They killed him. They robbed me a few  years later.  They made me hate what I was once, a moving, joyous part  of&#8212;life  down there. I went from the north, first to Ottawa, then to   Toronto and Winnipeg. After that I went to Brokaw, my father's old   partner, with the scheme. I've told you of Brokaw&#8212;one of the   deepest, shrewdest old fighters in the Middle West. It was only a   year after my father's death that he was on his feet again, as  strong  as ever. Brokaw drew in two or three others as strong as  himself, and  we went after the privileges. It was a fight from the  beginning.  Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by  powerful  opposition. A combination of Canadian capital quickly  organized and  petitioned for the same privileges. Old Brokaw knew  what it meant. It  was the hand of the trust&#8212;disguised under a  veneer of Canadian  promoters. They called us 'aliens'&#8212;American  'money-grabbers' robbing  Canadians of what justly belonged to  them. They aroused two-thirds of  the press against us, and yet&#8212;&quot; 
  The lines in Whittemore's face softened. He chuckled as he pulled   out his pipe and began filling it. 
  &quot;They had to go some to beat the old man, Greggy. I don't know   just how Brokaw pulled the thing off, but I do know that when we  won  out three members of parliament and half a dozen other  politicians  were honorary members of our organization, and that it  cost Brokaw a  hundred thousand dollars! Our opponents had raised  such a howl,  calling upon the patriotism of the country and  pointing out that the  people of the north would resent this  invasion of foreigners, that we  succeeded in getting only a  provisional license, subject to withdrawal  by the government at  any time conditions seemed to warrant it. I saw  in this no blow to  my scheme, for I was certain that we could carry  the thing along  on such a square basis that within a year the whole  country would  be in sympathy with us. I expressed my views with  enthusiasm at  our final meeting, when the seven of us met to complete  our plans.  Brokaw and the other five were to direct matters in the  south; I  was to have full command of affairs in the north. A month  later I  was at work. Over here&quot;&#8212;he leaned over Gregson's shoulder and   placed a forefinger on the map&#8212;&quot;I established our headquarters,  with  MacDougall, a Scotch engineer, to help me. Within six months  we had a  hundred and fifty men at Blind Indian Lake, fifty  canoemen bringing in  supplies, and another gang putting in  stations over a stretch of more  than a hundred miles of lake  country. Everything was working smoothly,  better than I had  expected. At Blind Indian Lake we had a shipyard,  two warehouses,  ice-houses, a company store, and a population of three  hundred,  and had nearly completed a ten-mile roadbed for narrow-gauge   steel, which would connect us with the main line when it came up  to  us. I was completely lost in my work. At times I almost forgot  Brokaw  and the others. I was particularly careful of the funds  sent up to me,  and had accomplished my work at a cost of a little  under a hundred  thousand. At the end of the six months, when I was  about to make a  visit into the south, one of our warehouses and  ten thousand dollars'  worth of supplies went up in smoke. It was  our first misfortune, and  it was a big one. It was about the first  matter that I brought up  after I had shaken hands with Brokaw.&quot; 
  Philip's face was set and white as he stood in the middle of the   room looking at Gregson. 
  &quot;And what do you think was his reply, Greggy? He looked at me for   a moment, a peculiar twitching around the corners of his mouth,  and  then said, 'Don't allow a trivial matter like that to worry  you,  Philip. Why&#8212;we've already cleaned up a million on this  little fish  deal!'&quot; 
  Gregson sat up with a jerk. 
  &quot;A million! Great Scott&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, a million, Greggy,&quot; said Philip, softly, with his old   fighting smile. &quot;There was a hundred thousand dollars to my credit  in  a First National Bank. Pleasant surprise, eh?&quot; 
  Gregson had dropped his cigarette. His slim hands gripped the   edges of the table. He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore  to  continue.
