While Montague Nevitt was thus congenially engaged in pulling off  his treble coup of settling his own share in the Rio Negro deficit,  pocketing three thousand pounds, pro tem, for incidental expenses,  and getting Guy Waring thoroughly into his power by his knowledge  of a forgery, two other events were taking place elsewhere, which  were destined to prove of no small importance to the future of  the twins and their immediate surroundings. Things generally were  converging towards a crisis in their affairs. Colonel Kelmscott's  wrong-doing was bearing first-fruit abundantly.    
For as soon as Granville Kelmscott received that strangely-worded  note from Gwendoline Gildersleeve, he proceeded, as was natural,  straight down, in his doubt, to his father's library. There, bursting  into the room, with Gwendoline's letter still crushed in his hand  in the side pocket of his coat, and a face like thunder, he stood  in the attitude of avenging fate before his father's chair, and  gazed down upon him angrily.    
"What does <i>this</i> mean?" he asked, in a low but fuming voice, brandishing  the note before his eyes as he spoke. "Is every one in the county  to be told it but I? Is everybody else to hear my business before  you tell me a word of it? A letter comes to me this morning--no  matter from whom--and here's what it says: 'I know you're not the  eldest son, and that somebody else is the heir of Tilgate.' Surely,  if anybody was to know, <i>I</i> should have known it first. Surely,  if I'm to be turned adrift on the world, after being brought up to  think myself a man of means so long, I should, at least, be turned  adrift with my eyes open."    
Colonel Kelmscott gazed at him open-mouthed with horror.    
"Did Gwendoline Gildersleeve write that to you?" he cried, overpowered  at once by remorse and awe. "Did Gwendoline Gildersleeve write  that to you? Well, if Gwendoline Gildersleeve knows it, it's all  up with the scheme! That rascally lawyer, her father, has found  out everything. These two young men must have put their case in  the fellow's hands. He must be hunting up the facts. He must be  preparing to contest it. My boy, my boy, we're ruined! we're ruined!"    
"These two young men," Granville repeated, with a puzzled air of  surprise. "<i>What</i> two young men? I don't know them. I never heard  of them." Then suddenly one of those flashes of intuition burst in  upon him that burst in upon us all at moments of critical importance  to our lives. "Father, father," he cried, loaning forward in his  anguish and clutching the oak chair, "you don't mean to tell me  those fellows, the Warings, that we met at Chetwood Court, are your  lawful sons--and that <i>that</i> was why you bought the landscape with  the snake in it?"    
Kelmscott, of Tilgate, bent his proud head down to the table  unchecked. "My son, my son," he cried, in his despair, "you have  said it yourself. Your own mouth has suggested it. What use my  trying to keep it from you any longer? These lads--are Kelmscotts."    
"And--my mother?" Granville Kelmscott burst out, in a very tremulous  voice. The question was almost more than a man dare ask. But he  asked it in the first bitterness of a terrible awakening.    
"Your mother," Colonel Kelmscott answered, lifting his head once  more, with a terrible effort, and looking his son point-blank in  the face--"your mother is just what I have always called her--my  lawful wife--Lady Emily Kelmscott. The mother of these lads, to  whom I was also once duly married, died before my marriage with my  present wife--thank God I can say so. I may have acted foolishly,  cruelly, criminally; but at least I never acted quite so basely  and so ill as you impute to me, Granville."    
"Thank Heaven for that," his son answered fervently, with one hand  on his breast, drawing a deep sigh as he spoke. "You're my father,  sir, and it isn't for me to reproach you; but if you had only done  <i>that</i>--oh, my mother! my mother! I don't know, sir, I'm sure, how  I could ever have forgiven you; I don't know how I could ever have  kept my hands off you."    
Colonel Kelmscott straightened himself up, and looked hard at his  son. A terrible pathos gleamed in his proud brown eyes. His white  moustache had more dignity than ever.    
"Granville," he said slowly, like a broken man, "I don't ask you to  forgive me; you can never forgive me; I don't ask you to sympathise  with me; a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a son;  but I do ask you to bear with me while I try to explain myself."    
He braced himself up, and with many long pauses, and many inarticulate  attempts to set forth the facts in the least unfavourable aspect,  told his story all through, in minute detail, to that hardest of  all critics, his own dispossessed and disinherited boy.    
"If you're hard upon me, Granville," he cried at last as he finished,  looking wistfully for pity into his son's face, "you should remember,  at least, it was for your sake I did it, my boy; it was for your  sake I did it--yours, yours, and your mother's."    
Granville let him relate his whole story in full to the bitter  end, though it was with difficulty at times that that proud and  grey-haired man nerved himself up to tell it. Then, as soon as  all was told, he looked in his father's face once more, and said  slowly, with the pitilessness of sons in general towards the faults  and failings of their erring parents--    
"It's not my place to blame you, I know. You did it, I suppose, as  you say so, for me and my mother. But it <i>is</i> my place to tell you  plainly, father, that I, for one, will have nothing at all to do  with the fruits of your deception. I was no party to the fraud; I  will be no party either to its results or its clearing up. I, too,  have to think, as you say, of my mother. For her sake, I won't  urge you to break her heart at once by disinheriting her son, now  and here, too openly. You can make what arrangements you like with  these blood-sucking Warings. You can do as you will in providing  them with hush-money. Let them take their black-mail! You've handed  them over half the sum you got for Dowlands already, I suppose.  You can buy them off for awhile by handing them over the remainder.  Twelve thousand will do. Leeches as they are, that will surely  content them, at least for the present."    
Colonel Kelmscott raised one hand and tried hard to interrupt him;  but Granville would not be interrupted.    
"No, no," he went on sternly, shaking his head and frowning. "I'll  have my say for once, and then for ever keep silence. This is the  first and last time as long as we both live I will speak with you  on the subject. So we may as well understand one another, once and  for ever. For my mother's sake, as I said, there need be just at  present no open disclosure. You have years to live yet; and as long  as you live, these Waring people have no claim upon the estate in  any way. You've given them as much as they've any right to expect.  Let them wait for the rest till, in the course of nature, they  come into possession. As for me, I will go to carve out for myself  a place in the world elsewhere by my own exertions. Perhaps, before  my mother need know her son was left a beggar by the father who  brought him up like the heir to a large estate, I may have been  able to carve out that place for myself so well that she need  never really feel the difference. I'm a Kelmscott, and can fight  the world on my own account. But, in any case, I must go. Tilgate's  no longer a fit home for me. I leave it to those who have a better  right to it."    
He rose as if to depart, with the air of a man who sets forth upon  the world to seek his fortune. Colonel Kelmscott rose too, and  faced him, all broken.    
"Granville," he said, in a voice scarcely audible through the  stifled sobs he was too proud to give vent to, "you're not going  like this. You're not going without at least shaking hands with your  father! You're not going without saying good-bye to your mother!"    
Granville turned, with hot tears standing dim in his eyes--like his  father, he was too proud to let them trickle down his cheek--and  taking the Colonel's weather-beaten hand in his, wrung it silently  for some minutes with profound emotion.    
Then he looked at the white moustache, the grizzled hair, the  bright brown eyes suffused with answering dimness, and said, almost  remorsefully, "Father, good-bye. You meant me well, no doubt. You  thought you were befriending me. But I wish to Heaven in my soul  you had meant me worse. It would have been easier for me to bear  in the end. If you'd brought me up as a nobody--as a younger son's  accustomed--" He paused and drew back, for he could see his words  were too cruel for that proud man's heart. Then he broke off  suddenly.    
"But I <i>can't</i> say good-bye to my mother," he went on, with a piteous  look. "If I tried to say good-bye to her, I must tell her all. I'd  break down in the attempt. I'll write to her from the Cape. It'll  be easier so. She won't feel it so much then."    
"From the Cape!" Colonel Kelmscott exclaimed, drawing back in horror.  "Oh, Granville, don't tell me you're going away from us to Africa!"    
"Where else?" his son asked, looking him back in the face steadily.  "Africa it is! That's the only opening left nowadays for a man  of spirit. There, I may be able to hew out a place for myself at  last, worthy of Lady Emily Kelmscott's son. I won't come back till  I come back able to hold my own in the world with the best of them.  These Warings shan't crow over the younger son. Good-bye, once  more, father." He wrung his hand hard. "Think kindly of me when  I'm gone; and don't forget altogether I once loved Tilgate."    
He opened the door and went up to his own room again. His mind was  resolved. He wouldn't even say good-bye to Gwendoline Gildersleeve.  He'd pack a few belongings in a portmanteau in haste, and go forth  upon the world to seek his fortune in the South African diamond  fields.    
But Colonel Kelmscott sat still in the library, bowed down in his  chair, with his head between his hands, in abject misery. A strange  feeling seemed to throb through his weary brain; he had a sensation  as though his skull were opening and shutting. Great veins on his  forehead beat black and swollen. The pressure was almost more than  the vessels would stand. He held his temples between his two palms  as if to keep them from bursting. All ahead looked dark as night;  the ground was cut from under him. The punishment of his sin was  too heavy for him to bear. How could he ever tell Emily now that  Granville was gone? A horrible numbness oppressed his brain. Oh,  mercy! mercy! his head was flooded.
