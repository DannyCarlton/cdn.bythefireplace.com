  From the window, the glorious day outside, and the vision he had   made for himself of Marette Radisson, Kent turned at the sound of  a  hand at his door and saw it slowly open. He was expecting it. He  had  read young Mercer like a book. Mercer's nervousness and the  increased  tightening of the thing in his chest had given him  warning. The thing  was going to happen soon, and Father Layonne  had come. He tried to  smile, that he might greet his wilderness  friend cheerfully and  unafraid. But the smile froze when the door  opened and he saw the  missioner standing there. 
  More than once he had accompanied Father Layonne over the   threshold of life into the presence of death, but he had never  before  seen in his face what he saw there now. He stared. The  missioner  remained in the doorway, hesitating, as if at the last  moment a great  fear held him back. For an interval the eyes of the  two men rested  upon each other in a silence that was like the grip  of a living thing.  Then Father Layonne came quietly into the room  and closed the door  behind him. 
  Kent drew a deep breath and tried to grin. &quot;You woke me out of a   dream,&quot; he said, &quot;a day-dream. I've had a very pleasant experience   this morning, mon pere.&quot; 
  &quot;So some one was trying to tell me, Jimmy,&quot; replied the little   missioner with an effort to smile back. 
  &quot;Mercer?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. He told me about it confidentially. The poor boy must have   fallen in love with the young lady.&quot; 
  &quot;So have I, mon pere. I don't mind confessing it to you. I'm   rather glad. And if Cardigan hadn't scheduled me to die&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Jimmy,&quot; interrupted the missioner quickly, but a bit huskily,   &quot;has it ever occurred to you that Doctor Cardigan may be  mistaken?&quot; 
  He had taken one of Kent's hands. His grip tightened. It began to   hurt. And Kent, looking into his eyes, found his brain all at once   like a black room suddenly illuminated by a flash of fire. Drop by   drop the blood went out of his face until it was whiter than  Father  Layonne's. 
  &quot;You&#8212;you don't&#8212;mean&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, yes, boy, I mean just that,&quot; said the missioner, in a voice   so strange that it did not seem to be his own. &quot;You are not going  to  die, Jimmy. You are going to live!&quot; 
  &quot;Live!&quot; Kent dropped back against his pillows. &quot;LIVE!&quot; His lips   gasped the one word. 
  He closed his eyes for an instant, and it seemed to him that the   world was aflame. And he repeated the word again, but only his  lips  formed it, and there came no sound. His senses, strained to  the  breaking-point to meet the ordeal of death, gave way slowly to  the  mighty reaction. He felt in those moments like a reeling man.  He  opened his eyes, and there was a meaningless green haze through  the  window where the world should have been. But he heard Father  Layonne's  voice. It seemed a great distance off, but it was very  clear. Doctor  Cardigan had made an error, it was saying. And  Doctor Cardigan,  because of that error, was like a man whose heart  had been taken out  of him. But it was an excusable error. 
  If there had been an X-ray&#8212;But there had been none. And Doctor   Cardigan had made the diagnosis that nine out of ten good surgeons   would probably have made. What he had taken to be the aneurismal   blood-rush was an exaggerated heart murmur, and the increased   thickening in his chest was a simple complication brought about by   too much night air. It was too bad the error had happened. But he   must not blame Cardigan! 
  HE MUST NOT BLAME CARDIGAN! Those last words pounded like an   endless series of little waves in Kent's brain. He must not blame   Cardigan! He laughed, laughed before his dazed senses readjusted   themselves, before the world through the window pieced itself into   shape again. At least he thought he was laughing. He must&#8212;not&#8212;   blame&#8212;Cardigan! What an amazingly stupid thing for Father Layonne  to  say! Blame Cardigan for giving him back his life? Blame him for  the  glorious knowledge that he was not going to die? Blame him  for&#8212; 
  Things were coming clearer. Like a bolt slipping into its groove   his brain found itself. He saw Father Layonne again, with his  white,  tense face and eyes in which were still seated the fear and  the horror  he had seen in the doorway. It was not until then that  he gripped  fully at the truth. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;You and Cardigan think it would have been   better if I had died!&quot; 
  The missioner was still holding his hand. &quot;I don't know, Jimmy, I   don't know. What has happened is terrible.&quot; 
  &quot;But not so terrible as death,&quot; cried Kent, suddenly growing rigid   against his pillows. &quot;Great God, mon pere, I want to live! Oh&#8212;&quot; 
  He snatched his hand free and stretched forth both arms to the   open window. &quot;Look at it out there! My world again! MY WORLD! I  want  to go back to it. It's ten times more precious to me now than  it was.  Why should I blame Cardigan? Mon pere&#8212;mon pere&#8212;listen to  me. I can  say it now, because I've got a right to say it. I LIED.  I didn't kill  John Barkley!&quot; 
  A strange cry fell from Father Layonne's lips. It was a choking   cry, a cry, not of rejoicing, but of a grief-stung thing. &quot;Jimmy!&quot; 
  &quot;I swear it! Great heaven, mon pere, don't you believe me?&quot; 
  The missioner had risen. In his eyes and face was another look. It   was as if in all his life he had never seen James Kent before. It  was  a look born suddenly of shock, the shock of amazement, of  incredulity,  of a new kind of horror. Then swiftly again his  countenance changed,  and he put a hand on Kent's head. 
  &quot;God forgive you, Jimmy,&quot; he said. &quot;And God help you, too!&quot; 
  Where a moment before Kent had felt the hot throb of an inundating   joy, his heart was chilled now by the thing he sensed in Father   Layonne's voice and saw in his face and eyes. It was not entirely   disbelief. It was a more hopeless thing than that. 
  &quot;You do not believe me!&quot; he said. 
  &quot;It is my religion to believe, Jimmy,&quot; replied Father Layonne in a   gentle voice into which the old calmness had returned. &quot;I must   believe, for your sake. But it is not a matter of human sentiment   now, lad. It is the Law! Whatever my heart feels toward you can do   you no good. You are&#8212;&quot; He hesitated to speak the words. 
  Then it was that Kent saw fully and clearly the whole monstrous   situation. It had taken time for it to fasten itself upon him. In  a  general way it had been clear to him a few moments before; now,  detail  by detail, it closed in upon him, and his muscles  tightened, and  Father Layonne saw his jaw set hard and his hands  clench. Death was  gone. But the mockery of it, the grim exultation  of the thing over the  colossal trick it had played, seemed to din  an infernal laughter in  his ears. But&#8212;he was going to live! That  was the one fact that rose  above all others. No matter what  happened to him a month or six months  from now, he was not going  to die today. He would live to receive  Mercer's report. He would  live to stand on his feet again and to fight  for the life which he  had thrown away. He was, above everything else,  a fighting man. It  was born in him to fight, not so much against his  fellow men as  against the overwhelming odds of adventure as they came  to him.  And now he was up against the deadliest game of all. He saw  it. He  felt it. The thing gripped him. In the eyes of that Law of  which  he had so recently been a part he was a murderer. And in the   province of Alberta the penalty for killing a man was hanging.   Because horror and fear did not seize upon him, he wondered if he   still realized the situation. He believed that he did. It was  merely  a matter of human nature. Death, he had supposed, was a  fixed and  foregone thing. He had believed that only a few hours of  life were  left for him. And now it was given back to him, for  months at least.  It was a glorious reprieve, and&#8212; 
  Suddenly his heart stood still in the thrill of the thought that   came to him. Marette Radisson had known that he was not going to  die!  She had hinted the fact, and he, like a blundering idiot, had  failed  to catch the significance of it. She had given him no  sympathy, had  laughed at him, had almost made fun of him, simply  because she knew  that he was going to live! 
  He turned suddenly on Father Layonne. 
  &quot;They shall believe me!&quot; he cried. &quot;I shall make them believe me!   Mon pere, I lied! I lied to save Sandy McTrigger, and I shall tell   them why. If Doctor Cardigan has not made another mistake, I want   them all here again. Will you arrange it?&quot; 
  &quot;Inspector Kedsty is waiting outside,&quot; said Father Layonne   quietly, &quot;but I should not act in haste, Jimmy. I should wait. I   should think&#8212;think.&quot; 
  &quot;You mean take time to think up a story that will hold water, mon   pere? I have that. I have the story. And yet&#8212;&quot; He smiled a bit   dismally. &quot;I did make one pretty thorough confession, didn't I,   Father?&quot; 
  &quot;It was very convincing, Jimmy. It went so particularly into the   details, and those details, coupled with the facts that you were  seen  at John Barkley's earlier in the evening, and that it was you  who  found him dead a number of hours later&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;All make a strong case against me,&quot; agreed Kent. &quot;As a matter of   fact, I was up at Barkley's to look over an old map he had made of   the Porcupine country twenty years ago. He couldn't find it. Later  he  sent word he had run across it. I returned and found him dead.&quot; 
  The little missioner nodded, but did not speak. 
  &quot;It is embarrassing,&quot; Kent went on. &quot;It almost seems as though I   ought to go through with it, like a sport. When a man loses, it  isn't  good taste to set up a howl. It makes him sort of yellow-  backed, you  know. To play the game according to rules, I suppose I  ought to keep  quiet and allow myself to be hung without making any  disturbance. Die  game, and all that, you know. Then there is the  other way of looking  at it. This poor neck of mine depends on me.  It has given me a lot of  good service. It has been mighty loyal.  It has even swallowed eggs on  the day it thought it was going to  die. And I'd be a poor specimen of  humanity to go back on it now.  I want to do that neck a good turn. I  want to save it. And I'm  going to&#8212;if I can!&quot; 
  In spite of the unpleasant tension of the moment, it cheered   Father Layonne to see this old humor returning into the heart of  his  friend. With him love was an enduring thing. He might grieve  for James  Kent, he might pray for the salvation of his soul, he  might believe  him guilty, yet he still bore for him the affection  which was too  deeply rooted in his heart to be uptorn by physical  things or the  happenings of chance. So the old cheer of his smile  came back, and he  said: 
  &quot;To fight for his life is a privilege which God gives to every   man, Jimmy. I was terrified when I came to you. I believed it  would  have been better if you had died. I can see my error. It  will be a  terrible fight. If you win, I shall be glad. If you  lose, I know that  you will lose bravely. Perhaps you are right. It  may be best to see  Inspector Kedsty before you have had time to  think. That point will  have its psychological effect. Shall I tell  him you are prepared to  see him?&quot; 
  Kent nodded. &quot;Yes. Now.&quot; 
  Father Layonne went to the door. Even there he seemed to hesitate   an instant, as if again to call upon Kent to reconsider. Then he   opened it and went out. 
  Kent waited impatiently. His hand, fumbling at his bedclothes,   seized upon the cloth with which he had wiped his lips, and it   suddenly occurred to him that it had been a long time since it had   shown a fresh stain of blood. Now that he knew it was not a deadly   thing, the tightening in his chest was less uncomfortable. He felt   like getting up and meeting his visitors on his feet. Every nerve  in  his body wanted action, and the minutes of silence which  followed the  closing of the door after the missioner were drawn  out and tedious to  him. A quarter of an hour passed before he  heard returning footsteps,  and by the sound of them he knew Kedsty  was not coming alone. Probably  le pere would return with him. And  possibly Cardigan. 
  What happened in the next few seconds was somewhat of a shock to   him. Father Layonne entered first, and then came Inspector Kedsty.   Kent's eyes shot to the face of the commander of N Division. There   was scarcely recognition in it. A mere inclination of the head,  not  enough to call a greeting, was the reply to Kent's nod and  salute.  Never had he seen Kedsty's face more like the face of an  emotionless  sphinx. But what disturbed him most was the presence  of people he had  not expected. Close behind Kedsty was McDougal,  the magistrate, and  behind McDougal entered Constables Felly and  Brant, stiffly erect and  clearly under orders. Cardigan, pale and  uneasy, came in last, with  the stenographer. Scarcely had they  entered the room when Constable  Pelly pronounced the formal  warning of the Criminal Code of the Royal  Northwest Mounted  Police, and Kent was legally under arrest. 
  He had not looked for this. He knew, of course, that the process   of the Law would take its course, but he had not anticipated this   bloodthirsty suddenness. He had expected, first of all, to talk  with  Kedsty as man to man. And yet&#8212;it was the Law. He realized  this as his  eyes traveled from Kedsty's rock-like face to the  expressionless  immobility of his old friends, Constables Pelly and  Brant. If there  was sympathy, it was hidden except in the faces of  Cardigan and Father  Layonne. And Kent, exultantly hopeful a little  while before, felt his  heart grow heavy within him as he waited  for the moment when he would  begin the fight to repossess himself  of the life and freed which he  had lost.
