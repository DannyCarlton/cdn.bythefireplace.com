  When Robert and Tayoga returned to the camp and told Willet what  they had done the hunter laughed a little.
  &#8220;Garay doesn't want to face St. Luc,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but he will do it  anyhow. He won't dare to come back on the trail in face of bullets, and  now we're sure to deliver his letter in ample time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Should we go direct to Albany?&#8221; asked Robert.
  The hunter cupped his chin in his hand and meditated.
  &#8220;I'm all for Colonel Johnson,&#8221; he replied at last. &#8220;He understands  the French and Indians and has more vigor than the authorities at  Albany. It seems likely to me that he will still be at the head of Lake  George where we left him, perhaps building the fort of which they were  talking before we left there.&#8221;
  &#8220;His wound did not give promise of getting well so very early,&#8221; said  Robert, &#8220;and he would not move while he was in a weakened condition.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then it's almost sure that he's at the head of the lake and we'll  turn our course toward that point. What do you say, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Waraiyageh is the man to have the letter, Great Bear. If it becomes  necessary for him to march to the defense of Albany he will do it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then the three of us are in unanimity and Lake George it is instead  of Albany.&#8221;
  They started in an hour, and changing their course somewhat, began a  journey across the maze of mountains toward Andiatarocte, the lake that  men now call George, and Robert's heart throbbed at the thought that he  would soon see it again in all its splendor and beauty. He had passed  so much of his life near them that his fortunes seemed to him to be  interwoven inseparably with George and Champlain.
  They thought they would reach the lake in a few days, but in a  wilderness and in war the plans of men often come to naught. Before the  close of the day they came upon traces of a numerous band traveling on  the great trail between east and west, and they also found among them  footprints that turned out. These Willet and Tayoga examined with the  greatest care and interest and they lingered longest over a pair  uncommonly long and slender.
  &#8220;I think they're his,&#8221; the hunter finally said.
  &#8220;So do I,&#8221; said the Onondaga.
  &#8220;Those long, slim feet could belong to nobody but the Owl.&#8221;
  &#8220;It can be only the Owl.&#8221;
  &#8220;Now, who under the sun is the Owl?&#8221; asked Robert, mystified.
  &#8220;The Owl is, in truth, a most dangerous man,&#8221; replied the hunter.  &#8220;His name, which the Indians have given him, indicates he works by  night, though he's no sloth in the day, either. But he has another  name, also, the one by which he was christened. It's Charles Langlade,  a young Frenchman who was a trader before the war. I've seen him more  than once. He's mighty shrewd and alert, uncommon popular among the  western Indians, who consider him as one of them because he married a  good looking young Indian woman at Green Bay, and a great forester and  wilderness fighter. It's wonderful how the French adapt themselves to  the ways of the Indians and how they take wives among them. I suppose  the marriage tie is one of their greatest sources of strength with the  tribes. Now, Tayoga, why do you think the Owl is here so far to the  eastward of his usual range?&#8221;
  &#8220;He and his warriors are looking for scalps, Great Bear, and it may  be that they have seen St. Luc. They were traveling fast and they are  now between us and Andiatarocte. I like it but little.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not any less than I do. It upsets our plans. We must leave the  trail, or like as not we'll run squarely into a big band. What a pity  our troops didn't press on after the victory at the lake. Instead of  driving the French and Indians out of the whole northern wilderness  we've left it entirely to them.&#8221;
  They turned from the trail with reluctance, because, strong and  enduring as they were, incessant hardships, long traveling and battle  were beginning to tell upon all three, and they were unwilling to be  climbing again among the high mountains. But there was no choice and  night found them on a lofty ridge in a dense thicket. The hunter and  the Onondaga were disturbed visibly over the advent of Langlade, and  their uneasiness was soon communicated to the sympathetic mind of  Robert.
  The night being very clear, sown with shining stars, they saw rings  of smoke rising toward the east, and outlined sharply against the dusky  blue.
  &#8220;That's Langlade sending up signals,&#8221; said the hunter, anxiously,  &#8220;and he wouldn't do it unless he had something to talk about.&#8221;
  &#8220;When one man speaks another man answers,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;Now from  what point will come the reply?&#8221;
  Robert felt excitement. These rings of smoke in the blue were full  of significance for them, and the reply to the first signal would be  vital. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he exclaimed suddenly. The answer came from the west,  directly behind them.
  &#8220;I think they've discovered our trail,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;They didn't  learn it from Garay, because Langlade passed before we sent him back,  but they might have heard from St. Luc or Tandakora that we were  somewhere in the forest. It's bad. If it weren't for the letter we  could turn sharply to the north and stay in the woods till Christmas,  if need be.&#8221;
  &#8220;We may have to do so, whether we wish it or not,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;The  shortest way is not always the best.&#8221;
  Before morning they saw other smoke signals in the south, and it  became quite evident then that the passage could not be tried, except  at a risk perhaps too great to take.
  &#8220;There's nothing for it but the north,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;and we'll  trust to luck to get the letter to Waraiyageh in time. Perhaps we can  find Rogers. He must be roaming with his rangers somewhere near  Champlain.&#8221;
  At dawn they were up and away, but all through the forenoon they saw  rings of smoke rising from the peaks and ridges, and the last lingering  hope that they were not followed disappeared. It became quite evident  to their trained observation and the powers of inference from  circumstances which had become almost a sixth sense with them that  there was a vigorous pursuit, closing in from three points of the  compass, south, east and west. They slept again the next night in the  forest without fire and arose the following morning cold, stiff and out  of temper. While they eased their muscles and prepared for the day's  flight they resolved upon a desperate expedient.
  It was vital now to carry the letter to Johnson and then to Albany,  which they considered more important than their own escape, and they  could not afford to be driven farther and farther into the recesses of  the north, while St. Luc might be marching with a formidable force on  Albany itself.
  &#8220;With us it's unite to fight and divide for flight,&#8221; said Robert,  divining what was in the mind of the others.
  &#8220;The decision is forced upon us,&#8221; said Willet, regretfully.
  Tayoga nodded.
  &#8220;We'll read the letter again several times, until all of us know it  by heart,&#8221; said the hunter.
  The precious document was produced, and they went over it until each  could repeat it from memory. Then Willet said:
  &#8220;I'm the oldest and I'll take the letter and go south past their  bands. One can slip through where three can't.&#8221;
  He spoke with such decision that the others, although Tayoga wanted  the task of risk and honor, said nothing.
  &#8220;And do you, Robert and Tayoga,&#8221; resumed the hunter, &#8220;continue your  flight to the northward. You can keep ahead of these bands, and, when  you discover the chase has stopped, curve back for Lake George. If by  any chance I should fall by the way, though it's not likely, you can  repeat the letter to Colonel Johnson, and let's hope you'll be in time.  Now good-by, and God bless you both.&#8221;
  Willet never displayed emotion, but his feeling was very deep as he  wrung the outstretched hand of each. Then he turned at an angle to the  east and south and disappeared in the undergrowth.
  &#8220;He has been more than a father to me,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;The Great Bear is a man, a man who is pleasing to Areskoui  himself,&#8221; said Tayoga with emphasis.
  &#8220;Do you think he will get safely through?&#8221;
  &#8220;There is no warrior, not even of the Clan of the Bear, of the  Nation Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, who can  surpass the Great Bear in forest skill and cunning. In the night he  will creep by Tandakora himself, with such stealth, that not a leaf  will stir, and there will be not the slightest whisper in the grass.  His step, too, will be so light that his trail will be no more than a  bird's in the air.&#8221;
  Robert laughed and felt better.
  &#8220;You don't stint the praise of a friend, Tayoga,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I  know that at least three-fourths of what you say is true. Now, I take  it that you and I are to play the hare to Langlade's hounds, and that  in doing so we'll be of great help to Dave.&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye,&#8221; agreed the Onondaga, and they swung into their gait. Robert  had received Garay's pistol which, being of the same bore as his own,  was now loaded with bullet and powder, instead of bullet and paper, and  it swung at his belt, while Tayoga carried the intermediary's rifle, a  fine piece. It made an extra burden, but they had been unwilling to  throw it away&#8212;a rifle was far too valuable on the border to be  abandoned.
  They maintained a good pace until noon, and, as they heard no sound  behind them, less experienced foresters than they might have thought  the pursuit had ceased, but they knew better. It had merely settled  into that tenacious kind which was a characteristic of the Indian mind,  and unless they could hide their trail it would continue in the same  determined manner for days. At noon, they paused a half hour in a dense  grove and ate bear and deer meat, sauced with some fine, black wild  grapes, the vines hanging thick on one of the trees.
  &#8220;Think of those splendid banquets we enjoyed when Garay was sitting  looking at us, though not sharing with us,&#8221; said Robert.
  Tayoga smiled at the memory and said:
  &#8220;If he had been able to hold out a little longer he would have had  plenty of food, and we would not have had the letter. The Great Bear  would never have starved him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know that now, Tayoga, and I learn from it that we're to hold out  too, long after we think we're lost, if we're to be the victors.&#8221;
  They came in the afternoon to a creek, flowing in their chosen  course, and despite the coldness of its waters, which rose almost to  their knees, they waded a long time in its bed. When they went out on  the bank they took off their leggings and moccasins, wrung or beat out  of them as much of the water as they could, and then let them dry for a  space in the sun, while they rubbed vigorously their ankles and feet to  create warmth. They knew that Langlade's men would follow on either  side of the creek until they picked up the trail again, but their  maneuver would create a long delay, and give them a rest needed badly.
  &#8220;Have you anything in mind, Tayoga?&#8221; asked Robert. &#8220;You know that  the farther north and higher we go the colder it will become, and our  flight may take us again into the very heart of a great snow storm.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so, Dagaeoga, but it is also so that I do have a plan. I  think I know the country into which we are coming, and that tells me  what to do. The people of my race, living from the beginning of the  world in the great forest, have not been too proud to learn from the  animals, and of all the animals we know perhaps the wisest is the  bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;The bear is scarcely an animal, Tayoga. He is almost a human being.  He has as good a sense of humor as we have, and he is more careful  about minding his own business, and letting alone that of other  people.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dagaeoga is not without wisdom. We will even learn from the bear. A  hundred miles to the north of us there is a vast rocky region  containing many caves, where the bears go in great numbers to sleep the  long winters through. It is not much disturbed, because it is a  dangerous country, lying between the Hodenosaunee and the Indian  nations to the north, with which we have been at war for centuries.  There we will go.&#8221;
  &#8220;And hole up until our peril passes! Your plan appeals to me,  Tayoga! I will imitate the bear! I will even be a bear!&#8221;
  &#8220;We will take the home of one of them before he comes for it  himself, and we will do him no injustice, because the wise bear can  always find another somewhere else.&#8221;
  &#8220;They're fine caves, of course!&#8221; exclaimed Robert, buoyantly, his  imagination, which was such a powerful asset with him, flaming up as  usual. &#8220;Dry and clean, with plenty of leaves for beds, and with nice  little natural shelves for food, and a pleasant little brook just  outside the door. It will be pleasant to lie in our own cave, the best  one of course, and hear the snow and sleet storms whistle by, while  we're warm and comfortable. If we only had complete assurance that Dave  was through with the letter I'd be willing to stay there until spring.&#8221;
  Tayoga smiled indulgently.
  &#8220;Dagaeoga is always dreaming,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but bright dreams hurt  nobody.&#8221;
  When night came, they were many more miles on their way, but it was  a very cold darkness that fell upon them and they shivered in their  blankets. Robert made no complaint, but he longed for the caves, of  which he was making such splendid pictures. Shortly before morning, a  light snow fell and the dawn was chill and discouraging, so much so  that Tayoga risked a fire for the sake of brightness and warmth.
  &#8220;Langlade's men will come upon the coals we leave,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but  since we have not shaken them off it will make no difference. How much  food have we left, Dagaeoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not more than enough for three days.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then it is for us to find more soon. It is another risk that we  must take. I wish I had with me now my bow and arrows which I left at  the lake, instead of Garay's rifle. But Areskoui will provide.&#8221;
  The day turned much colder, and the streams to which they came were  frozen over. By night, the ice was thick enough to sustain their weight  and they traveled on it for a long time, their thick moosehide  moccasins keeping their feet warm, and saving them from falling. Before  they returned to the land it began to snow again, and Tayoga rejoiced  openly.
  &#8220;Now a white blanket will lie over the trail we have left on the  ice,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hiding it from the keenest eyes that ever were in a  man's head.&#8221;
  Then they crossed a ridge and came upon a lake, by the side of which  they saw through the snow and darkness a large fire burning. Creeping  nearer, they discerned dusky forms before the flames and made out a  band of at least twenty warriors, many of them sound asleep, wrapped to  the eyes in their blankets.
  &#8220;Have they passed ahead of us and are they here meaning to guard the  way against us?&#8221; whispered Robert.
  &#8220;No, it is not one of the bands that has been following us,&#8221; replied  the Onondaga. &#8220;This is a war party going south, and not much stained as  yet by time and travel. They are Montagnais, come from Montreal. They  seek scalps, but not ours, because they do not know of us.&#8221;
  Robert shuddered. These savages, like as not, would fall at midnight  upon some lone settlement, and his intense imagination depicted the  hideous scenes to follow.
  &#8220;Come away,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Since they don't know anything about us  we'll keep them in ignorance. I'm longing more than ever for my warm  bear cave.&#8221;
  They disappeared in the falling snow, which would soon hide their  trail here, as it had hidden it elsewhere, and left the lake behind  them, not stopping until they came to a deep and narrow gorge in the  mountains, so well sheltered by overhanging bushes that no snow fell  there. They raked up great quantities of dry leaves, after the usual  fashion, and spread their blankets upon them, poor enough quarters save  for the hardiest, but made endurable for them by custom and intense  weariness. Both fell asleep almost at once, and both awoke about the  same time far after dawn.
  Robert moved his stiff fingers in his blanket and sat up, feeling  cold and dismal. Tayoga was sitting up also, and the two looked at each  other.
  &#8220;In very truth those bear caves never seemed more inviting to me,&#8221;  said young Lennox, solemnly, &#8220;and yet I only see them from afar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dagaeoga has fallen in love with bear caves,&#8221; said the Onondaga, in  a whimsical tone. &#8220;The time is not so far back when he never talked  about them at all, and now words in their praise fall from his lips in  a stream.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's because I've experienced enlightenment, Tayoga. It is only in  the last two or three days that I've learned the vast superiority of a  cave to any other form of human habitation. Our remote ancestors lived  in them two or three hundred thousand years, and we've been living in  houses of wood or brick or stone only six or seven thousand years, I  suppose, and so the cave, if you judge by the length of time, is our  true home. Hence I'm filled with a just enthusiasm at the thought of  going back speedily to the good old ways and the good old days. It's  possible, Tayoga, that our remote grandfathers knew best.&#8221;
  &#8220;When Dagaeoga comes to his death bed, seventy or eighty years from  now, and the medicine man tells him but little more breath is left in  his body, what then do you think he will do?&#8221;
  &#8220;What will I do, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;You will say to the medicine man, 'Tell me exactly how long I have  to live,' and the medicine man will reply: 'Ten minutes, O Dagaeoga,  venerable chief and great orator.' Then you will say: 'Let all the  people be summoned and let them crowd into the wigwam in which I lie,'  and when they have all come and stand thick about your bed, you will  say, 'Now raise me into a sitting position and put the pillows thick  behind my back and head that I may lean against them.' Then you will  speak to the people. The words will flow from your lips in a continuous  and golden stream. It will be the finest speech of your life. It will  be filled with magnificent words, many of them, eight or ten syllables  long. It will be mellow like the call of a trumpet. It will be armed  with force, and it will be beautiful with imagery; it will be suffused  and charged with color, it will be the very essence of poetry and  power, and as the aged Dagaeoga draws his very last breath so he will  speak his very last word, and thus, in a golden cloud, his soul will go  away into infinite space, to dwell forever in the bosom of Manitou,  with the immortal sachems, Tododaho and Hayowentha!&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you know, Tayoga, I think that would be a happy death,&#8221; said  Robert earnestly.
  The Onondaga laughed heartily.
  &#8220;Thus does Dagaeoga show his true nature,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was born  with the spirit and soul of the orator, and the fact is disclosed  often. It is well. The orator, be he white or red, will lose himself  sometimes in his own words, but he is a gift from the gods, sent to  lift up the souls, and cheer the rest of us. He is the bugle that calls  us to the chase and we must not forget that his value is great.&#8221;
  &#8220;And having said a whole cargo of words yourself Tayoga, now what do  you propose that we do?&#8221;
  &#8220;Push on with all our strength for the caves. I know now we are on  the right path, because I recall the country through which we are  passing. At noon we will reach a small lake, in which the fish are so  numerous that there is not room for them all at the same time in the  water. They have to take turns in getting the air above the surface on  top of the others. For that reason the fish of this lake are different  from all other fish. They will live a full hour on the bank after they  are caught.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, in very truth, you've learned our ways well. You've become  a prince of romancers yourself.&#8221;
  At the appointed time they reached the lake. There were no fish  above its surface, but the Onondaga claimed it was due to the fact that  the lake was covered with ice which of course kept them down, and which  crowded them excessively, and very uncomfortably. They broke two big  holes in the ice, let down the lines which they always carried, the  hooks baited with fragments of meat, and were soon rewarded with  splendid fish, as much as they needed.
  Tayoga with his usual skill lighted a fire, despite the driving  snow, and they had a banquet, taking with them afterward a supply of  the cooked fish, though they knew they could not rely upon fish alone  in the winter days that were coming. But fortune was with them. Before  dark, Robert shot a deer, a great buck, fine and fat. They had so  little fear of pursuit now that they cut up the body, saving the skin  whole for tanning, and hung the pieces in the trees, there to freeze.  Although it would make quite a burden they intended to carry  practically all of it with them.
  Many mountain wolves were drawn that night by the odor of the  spoils, but they lay between twin fires and had no fear of an attack.  Yet the time might come when they would be assailed by fierce wild  animals, and now they were glad that Tayoga had kept Garay's rifle, and  also his ammunition, a good supply of powder and bullets. It was  possible that the question of ammunition might become vital with them,  but they did not yet talk of it.
  On the second day thereafter, bearing their burdens of what had been  the deer, they reached the stony valley Tayoga had in mind, and Robert  saw at once that its formation indicated many caves.
  &#8220;Now, I wonder if the bears have come,&#8221; he said, putting down his  pack and resting. &#8220;The cold has been premature and perhaps they're  still roaming through the forest. I shouldn't want to put an interloper  out of my own particular cave, but, if I have to do it, I will.&#8221;
  &#8220;The bears haven't arrived yet,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and we can choose. I  do not know, but I do not think a bear always occupies the same winter  home, so we will not have to fight over our place.&#8221;
  It was a really wonderful valley, where the decaying stone had made  a rich assortment of small caves, many of them showing signs of former  occupancy by large wild animals, and, after long searching, they found  one that they could make habitable for themselves. Its entrance was  several feet above the floor of the valley, so that neither storm nor  winter flood could send water into it, and its own floor was fairly  smooth, with a roof eight or ten feet high. It could be easily defended  with their three rifles, the aperture being narrow, and they expected,  with skins and pelts, to make it warm.
  It was but a cold and bleak refuge for all save the hardiest, and  for a little while Robert had to use his last ounce of will to save  himself from discouragement. But vigorous exertion and keen interest in  the future brought back his optimism. The hide of the deer they had  slain was spread at once upon the cave floor and made a serviceable  rug. They spoke hopefully of soon adding to it.
  A brook flowed less than a hundred yards away, and they would have  no trouble about their water supply, while the country about seemed  highly favorable for game. But on their first day there they did not do  any hunting. They rolled several large stones before the door of their  new home, making it secure against any prying wild animals, and then,  after a hearty meal, they wrapped themselves in their blankets and  slept prodigiously.
  Tayoga went into the forest the next day and set traps and snares,  while Robert worked in the valley, breaking up fallen wood to be used  for fires, and doing other chores. The Onondaga in the next three or  four days shot a large panther, a little bear, and caught in the traps  and snares a quantity of small game. The big pelts and the little  pelts, after proper treatment, were spread upon the floor or hung  against the walls of the cave, which now began to assume a much more  inviting aspect, and the flesh of the animals that were eatable, cured  after the primitive but effective processes, was stored there also.
  Providence granted them a period of good weather, days and nights  alike being clear and cold. The game, evidently not molested for a long  time, fairly walked into their traps, and they were compelled to draw  but little upon their precious supply of ammunition. Food for the  future accumulated rapidly, and the floor and walls of the cave were  soon covered entirely with furs.
  Not one of the numerous caves and hollows about them contained an  occupant and Robert wondered if their presence would frighten away the  wild animals, so many of which had hibernated there so often. Yet he  had a belief that the bears would come. His present mode of life and  his isolation from the world gave him a feeling almost of kinship with  them, and in some strange way, and through some medium unknown to him,  they might reciprocate. He and Tayoga had killed several bears, it was  true, but far from the cave, and they made up their minds to molest  nothing in the valley or just about it.
  It was a land of many waters and they caught with ease numerous  fish, drying all the surplus and storing it with the other food in the  cave. They also made soft beds for themselves of the little branches of  the evergreen, over which they spread their blankets, and when they  rolled the stone before the doorway at night they never failed to sleep  soundly.
  They did their cooking in front of the cave door, but it was always  a smothered fire. While they felt safe from wandering bands in that  lofty and remote region, they took no unnecessary risks. The valley  itself, though deep, was much broken up into separate little valleys,  and most of the caves were hidden from their own. It was this fact that  made Robert still think the bears would come, despite coals and flame.  In the evenings they would talk of Willet, and both were firm in the  opinion that the hunter had got through to Lake George and that Johnson  and Albany had been warned in time. Each was confirmed in his opinion  by the other and in a few days it became certainty.
  &#8220;I think Tododaho on his star whispered in my ear while I slept that  Great Bear has passed the hostile lines,&#8221; said Tayoga with conviction,  &#8220;because I know it, just as if the Great Bear himself had told it to  me, though I do not know how I know it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's some sort of mysterious information,&#8221; said Robert in the same  tone of absolute belief, &#8220;and I don't worry any more about Dave and the  letter. The men of the Hodenosaunee seem to have a special gift. You  know the old chief, Hendrik, foretold that he would die on the shores  of Andiatarocte, and it came to pass just as he had said.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was a glorious death, Dagaeoga, and it was, perhaps, he who  saved our army, and made the victory possible.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it was. There's not a doubt of it, but, here, I don't feel much  like taking part in a war. The great struggle seems to have passed  around us for a while, at least. I appear to myself as a man of peace,  occupied wholly with the struggle for existence and with preparations  for a hard winter. I don't want to harm anything.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps it's because nothing we know of wants to harm us. But,  Dagaeoga, if the bears come at all they will come quickly, because in a  few days winter will be roaring down upon us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Tayoga, we must hurry our labors, and since the mysterious  message brought in some manner through the air has told us that Dave  has reached the lake, I'm rather anxious for it to rush down. While it  keeps us here it will also hold back the forces of St. Luc.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true, Dagaeoga. It's a poor snow that doesn't help somebody.  Now, I will make a bow and arrow to take the place of my great bow and  quiver, which await me elsewhere, because we must draw but little upon  our powder and bullets.&#8221;
  The Onondaga had hatchet and knife and he worked with great rapidity  and skill, cutting and bending a bow in two or three days, and making a  string of strong sinews, after which he fashioned many arrows and  tipped them with sharp bone. Then he contemplated his handiwork with  pride.
  &#8220;Hasty work is never the best of work,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and these are not  as good as those I left behind me, but I know they will serve. The game  here, hunted but little, is not very wary and I can approach near.&#8221;
  His skill both in construction and use was soon proved, as he slew  with his new weapons a great moose, two ordinary deer, and much smaller  game, while the traps caught beaver, otter, fox, wolf and other  animals, with fine pelts. Many splendid furs were soon drying in the  air and were taken later into the cave, while they accumulated dried  and jerked game enough to last them until the next spring.
  Both worked night and day with such application and intensity that  their hands became stiff and sore, and every bone in them ached.  Nevertheless Robert took time now and then to examine the little caves  in the other sections of the valley, only to find them still empty. He  thought, for a while, that the presence of Tayoga and himself and their  operations with the game might have frightened the bears away, but the  feeling that they would come returned and was strong upon him. As for  Tayoga he never doubted. It had been decreed by Tododaho.
  &#8220;The animals have souls,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Often when great warriors die or  fall in battle their souls go into the bodies of bear, or deer, or  wolf, but oftenest into that of bear. For that reason the bear, saving  only the dog which lives with us, is nearest to man, and now and then,  because of the warrior soul in him, he is a man himself, although he  walks on four legs&#8212;and he does not always walk on four legs, sometimes  he stands on two. Doubt not, Dagaeoga, that when the stormy winter  sweeps down the bears will come to their ancient homes, whether or not  we be here.&#8221;
  The winds grew increasingly chill, coming from the vast lakes beyond  the Great Lakes, those that lay in the far Canadian north, and the  skies were invariably leaden in hue and gloomy. But in the cave it was  cozy and warm. Furs and skins were so numerous that there was no longer  room on the floor and walls for them all, many being stored in glossy  heaps in the corners.
  &#8220;Some day these will bring a good price from the Dutch traders at  Albany,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;and it may be, Tayoga, that you and I will need  the money. I've been a scout and warrior for a long time, and now I've  suddenly turned fur hunter. Well, that spirit of peace and of a  friendly feeling toward all mankind grows upon me. Why shouldn't I be  full of brotherly love when your patron saint, Tododaho, has been so  kind to us?&#8221;
  He swept the cave once more with a glance of approval. It furnished  shelter, warmth, food in abundance, and with its furs even a certain  velvety richness for the eye, and Tayoga nodded assent. Meanwhile they  waited for the fierce blasts of the mountain winter.
