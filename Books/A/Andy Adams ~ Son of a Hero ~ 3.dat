  A decade is not a long time&#8212;when it has passed. 
  The sun was sinking like a blood-red ball in a field of fire&#8212;as  the  sun should set on the eve of a sanguinary struggle at sea. So  thought  Jim Falkner, captain of the Lady Gwendolyn and her  pirate-crew. The  pirate-ship rested heavily in an almost motionless  waste of water, but  there was breeze enough partly to fill her sail  and to flaunt, at the  peak of the single mast, the half of a  table-cloth, on which was  painted bold and clear the skull and  cross-bones which proclaimed her  calling. Edging up across Lake Erie  an eighth of a mile away was a  small full-rigged schooner, looming  picturesquely against the western  sky under a dirt-grey cloud of  canvas. The pirate-crew had watched her  slow approach, and for a  quarter of an hour Captain Jim had stood on  the sloop's cabin roof; a  twisted glass which distorted shapes  amazingly screwed to his right  eye. About his shock of uncombed hair  he had tightly bound a red  bandanna, and from under this his thin  freckle-strewn face shone  flushed and dirty. In the belt about his  middle he carried a  carving-knife, and in the leg of one of his boots,  which were big  enough for two pirates of his size, were concealed a  pistol, a box of  cartridges, a case-knife, and other things which were  prized. The  others of the Lady Gwendolyn, four in number, were the  raggedest,  dirtiest urchins that had ever sailed a ship, and for three  minutes  one of these had kept his eyes levelled along a piece of gas-  pipe  which had been fitted over the bow of the pirate-ship. At last  the  gunner turned about and called out in shrill disgust: 
  &quot;Ain't yer ever goin' t' tell me t' shoot?&quot; 
  &quot;Fi-yer-r-r-r-r-r!&quot; yelled the captain. 
  With a spasmodic jerk the gunner lighted a match and touched the  flame  to a short fuse in the end of the improvised cannon. Then the  crew of  the Lady Gwendolyn ducked. A moment later there came a  deafening  explosion, and half a pound of pebbles sang on their way to  the  schooner. 
  &quot;Load 'er up!&quot; shrieked the pirate captain, coming from cover and   swinging his arms joyously. &quot;Load 'er up!&quot; 
  Two or three men ran to the rail of the passing schooner, and the   pirates heard a warning voice. The gas-pipe roared in response. Never   in his life had James Falkner been more in his element than at this   moment. But suddenly in the middle of a yell which seemed as though it   would split his throat, he choked himself off with a gasp of   astonishment. There had come an unexpected tremble in the great white   wings of the schooner, and while the pirate-crew stared in silent   stupefaction the canvas crumbled down like melting banks of snow, and   from the vessel's side a boat shot out, filled with four of the   biggest, most determined-looking men that the Lady Gwendolyn's crew   had ever seen. 
  &quot;Holy Gee!&quot; ejaculated the gunner. He looked up at the captain, but   his face was blank. A few minutes later the four seamen towed the Lady   Gwendolyn astern of the schooner, where they tied her as a prize, and   one after another the captured pirates scrambled, in all of their   warlike toggery, over the side of the ship. All of this had happened   almost too quickly for comprehension. Nipped in the bud was the bloody   and picturesque career which the pirate-captain had mapped out for   himself. He was stunned, ashamed, and as he toppled over the   schooner's rail, hoisted with good-natured force by a seaman behind,   he saw that he was being laughed at by half a dozen men and women   gathered on the after-deck. As he scrambled to his feet and the other   pirates came pouring over, a girl ran out from the little group and   levelled a box-like thing. 
  &quot;Oh, keep quiet, keep quiet&#8212;please do!&quot; she cried. &quot;There! One,  two,  three&#8212;the light is so poor&#8212;four, five, six&#8212;&quot; and so she  counted up  to a dozen, and the pirate commander, knowing that his  picture was  being taken, straightened proudly with his right hand on  his hip,  threw out his chest, and stood without a quiver. When the  girl had  done, she looked straight into his eyes, and laughed. 
  &quot;Thank you!&quot; she said. 
  Even in this moment of sore defeat Jim Falkner's fertile mind  reverted  to his favourite pirate-hero, who had met the beautiful  heroine in  just this way, and he straightway fell in love with Miss  Virginia  Cloud, who, in company with her parents and a young man whom  the boy  had not yet seen, was making a cruise of the lakes in one of  her  brother's ships. The pirate-captain and his crew were given  quarters  under an awning back of the cook's house, and there they  discussed  their misfortune until the cook took them into his kitchen  and filled  them with a supper such as they had not seen in many days.  The cook  was a negro, and after the meal was over he came in, grinning  broadly,  and carrying a basket heaped with oranges. 
  &quot;Miss Virgin'y sent you these, an' sed she'd lak t' see you,&quot; he   announced, nodding to Jim. 
  The youthful pirate's heart thumped wildly inside his jacket. He   distributed the oranges, thrust his own in one of his pockets, and   rose from the table. He felt that something momentous was about to   happen. 
  &quot;Youse fellers go back an' lay low,&quot; he whispered as the cook  turned  to his work. &quot;Don't say nothin', but be ready!&quot; 
  As he went on deck he paused for a moment in the growing shadow of  the  caboose, fished out a cigarette from deep down in his boot-leg,   lighted it, and then walked forward, where he found the girl watching   the rippling sea under the bow of the slowly moving schooner. As she   heard him thumping up in his heavy boots she turned, and once more she   laughed merrily. 
  &quot;My goodness, how fierce you look!&quot; she cried. She held out one of  her  pretty white hands, and shaking as if with the ague, Jim thrust  one of  his own dirty ones into it. He saw now that the girl was very  pretty.  But there was something about her eyes which troubled him.  They were  red, as though she had been crying, and he saw a tear  half-way down  her cheek. 
  &quot;What's the matter?&quot; he asked guilelessly. Something strange inside   him seemed urging him to drop his cigarette, which he did. The girl   saw the act, and almost hugged him up beside her. 
  &quot;Nothing,&quot; she replied, yet Jim knew that there was a tremble in  her  voice. &quot;I just wanted to talk with you. Will you tell me your  name?&quot; 
  &quot;I ain't got none.&quot; 
  &quot;What! No name?&quot; The girl tilted up his freckled face and gazed   squarely down into it. 
  &quot;Nothin' but Jim,&quot; he answered. He could not help looking into the   girl's eyes, and he noticed that a sudden change came into them. At   times he had dreamed that away back in the misty past he had known   such eyes as those, filled with that same gentle softness. 
  &quot;No name!&quot; repeated the girl. &quot;And haven't you a home or&#8212;or&#8212;&quot; she   did not finish. 
  &quot;Guess I had one once, but I don't know where,&quot; informed Jim. &quot;They   had me in a orphan asyloom once, and there they called me James   Falkner; but that ain't really my name.&quot; He grinned, as though this   fact was unusually amusing; but the girl turned her face out toward   the lake and slipped an arm around his shoulders. For several minutes   there was silence. In Jim Falkner's little soul things were happening   which he had never experienced before. For the time he forgot that he   was a pirate. He could not remember ever having had a woman's arm   around him like this, and unconsciously he snuggled closer to the   girl. 
  &quot;James,&quot; she said suddenly, &quot;would you like to escape?&quot; 
  The question almost took the boy's breath away; it brought him back  to  the realization of being a captured pirate. In a flood his old   ambitions returned to him, but they were almost immediately replaced   by the desire to remain with the girl. He wanted to tell her this, and   was just beginning when she interrupted him. 
  &quot;Would you like to escape, to-night, and take me with you?&quot; 
  Filled with joy, the prisoner replied that he would. Then, with her   head bent down very near to his, Miss Virginia described her plans.   When she had done, the pirate-captain straightened, almost bursting   with the great secret she had confided to him. At that moment a man   came and stood within a few feet of them. He was a young man, and he   held his hat in his hand. But the girl had turned. Her chin was high   in the air, her lips were closed very tightly, and Jim wondered what   was the matter. In a moment the young man turned and slowly walked   away. 
  &quot;Who's dat guy?&quot; 
  &quot;He? Oh, just a man,&quot; replied the girl. Under a sudden impulse she   faced the young pirate and put both her arms around him. &quot;I want you   to promise me one thing, James. You won't go near him, will you?&quot; 
  &quot;You bet I won't, if you don't want me to!&quot; said the boy. 
  Miss Virginia bent down and pressed her warm lips upon one of Jim   Falkner's dirty cheeks and for an hour after that the pirate-captain   could think of nothing much beyond this soft caress. He went back to   his crew under the canvas awning, but not until the evening was well   advanced did he tell them of the venturesome work in store for them   that night. For a time the pirates amused themselves by playing cards   in the light of a deck-lantern, Then they doubled up back in the   shadows, and still later Captain Jim crept out cautiously and going to   the girl's cabin knocked lightly on the door. A moment later it was   partly opened, and the pirate-captain slipped in. 
  &quot;You're a little early, James.&quot; The girl had been writing and held  a  pen in her hand. The boy's enthusiasm was subdued by the whiteness  of  her face. 
  &quot;Sit down,&quot; she said, with a little smile that made Jim fear she  was  losing courage. &quot;I'll be ready in a minute.&quot; After a few moments  she  turned to him again. &quot;Hadn't you better get your men in the boat?&quot;  she  asked. &quot;I'll be there by that time.&quot; 
  After Captain Jim had gone she slowly read over the pages she had   written: 
  &quot;Dear Mama: Please don't be frightened when you read this. To-night  I  am helping the boys to escape, and I am going with them. You know  why,  but I want you to tell Father and Captain Marks that I did it  just for  a little fun. You'll do this, won't you? Mr. Brown is our  guest, and  it would embarrass him if the others knew about the affair.  It is  almost unnecessary to say that he came to me again this  afternoon. I  was perfectly fair with him, but he was too stubborn for  anything. In  other words, he said point-blank that I would have to  give up my idea  of studying operatic music, that he did not want a  wife whose  interests were divided between home and the stage. At that  I slipped  off my engagement ring, and then&#8212;well, he took it and  walked away. I  never want to see him again, and I want you to please  tell him so. The  boys will put me ashore, and I will take a train for  the Soo, where I  will rejoin you. He, of course, will have sense  enough to leave the  boat at Detroit.  Now please don't worry, Mama. In  haste, Virginia. 
  P.S. Of course, you know I intended to do as Dick wished. But when  he  said I must I said I wouldn't, and now I never will!&quot; 
  The girl sealed the letter, addressed it to her mother, and placed  it  on her dresser where it would be seen in the morning. Then she put  on  a hat and a light coat, and with a dressing-bag in her hand slipped   quietly out of her cabin into the gloomy stern of the ship. By their   united strength Jim Falkner and his pirates had worked the Lady   Gwendolyn in until her stub of a bowsprit rubbed against the   schooner's rudder, but even then the passage down seemed a perilous   one to the girl. The pirate-chief was waiting for her with a length of   rope in his hands. 
  &quot;We'll git y' down in a jiffy!&quot; he said encouragingly. &quot;I'll tie  this  rope under yer arms and ease y' down that way. See?&quot; He showed  her how  the trick was to be done, and was so eager in his work that he  did not  notice a dark form stealing toward him in the shadow of the  bulwark.  As Miss Virginia was lowered into the sloop this figure  paused, as if  undecided whether to approach nearer or to retreat. 
  &quot;Ahoy, down there!&quot; hissed Captain Jim, when he knew that his   passenger was safely aboard. &quot;Lay to 'n' be ready! I'll be back in a   minit!&quot; 
  Into his head had come a daring thought. Piratical blood was  surging  through his veins again, and now, as he turned and crept  stealthily  back, his eyes were open wide for plunder. James Falkner  was not a  thief. If a boy ashore had accused him of being such he  would have  fought, and fought hard. But he was a pirate, and to a  pirate all  things of value are legitimate plunder. Near the cook's  cabin was a  big coil of rope, and very cautiously Jim dragged this  across the  deck. Suddenly he heard a noise behind him, and, turning,  he saw a  figure between him and the stern. The spirit of a man came  into the  escaping prisoner. He saw that the situation demanded action,  and  reaching down into his boot-leg he pulled out his revolver,  sneaked up  as quietly as a cat, and shoved the weapon close up under  the nose of  the young man against whom the girl had warned him that  evening. 
  &quot;Hands up, mister!&quot; 
  The man obeyed. In the darkness Jim could not see that he was  laughing  silently, despite the fact that the revolver was within a few  inches  of his face. &quot;Don't shoot!&quot; he begged. &quot;Don't shoot! I'll go  with  you.&quot; 
  Captain Jim's heart throbbed with delight. Here was a prisoner,   perhaps a valuable one, instead of a coil of rope. Visions of a ransom   filled his brain. In a shrill voice that trembled with excitement he   commanded the prisoner to walk into the stern and climb down into the   sloop. He was even more delighted with the alacrity with which the man   obeyed. It was so dark that the pirates below could not see who was   coming down, and Jim did not inform them until he was among them   himself. After he had cut the towline he whispered the story of his   capture. Without a word the prisoner had seated himself. The girl was   the bow, a dozen feet away, concealed in darkness and unconscious of   what had occurred. 
  &quot;Is that you, James?&quot; she called in a low voice. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the captain. &quot;Don't anybody make a move until the   schooner's out of hearin',&quot; he added warningly, and for a few minutes   there was a deep silence aboard the sloop. Slowly the schooner's   lights grew more and more distant, and at last Captain Jim ordered the   Lady Gwendolyn's sail hoisted, and a lantern brought from the little   cabin. He was eager for the girl and his prisoner to see him as a   captain in active command. While still enveloped in darkness he   transferred his weapons from his bootleg to the belt about his waist.   Then he stood up square and stiff on the cabin roof just above his   prisoner's head, and as one of the pirates came up behind him with the   light he placed a hand over his eyes and stared tragically out into   the blackness of the night. In a moment the sloop was dimly   illuminated. Then the pirate heard a sharp, sudden little scream, then   a man's voice calling a name&#8212;just once. After that there was silence.   Still the pirate-captain stared out over the lake. It delighted him to   think that his attitude had startled the girl and the prisoner; he   tilted himself perilously over the edge of the boat, one hand   surreptitiously sought his revolver as if he detected approaching   danger, then&#8212; 
  &quot;Brute!&quot; 
  Surely that name had not been applied to him! He regained his  proper  equilibrium with a jerk. The man had partly risen with his  hands  stretched out toward the bow. Up there sat the girl. The pirate-   chieftain wondered what she was looking at. She seemed staring at   least six feet above his head, her lips set tightly, her hands   clenched in her lap. He looked up, but saw nothing of interest. Then   he looked at the man again. It occurred to him now that the girl had   warned him against this man. She feared him; possibly he had done some   great wrong, or was planning to hurt her. Determinedly he drew a bead   on the back of the prisoner's head. 
  &quot;Set down 'r I'll blow yer head off!&quot; he yelled. 
  The man turned, smiled up at Jim, and sat down. Still holding his   cocked revolver menacingly, the commander of the pirate-ship   approached the girl. She looked at him sternly with a peculiar gleam   in her eyes that he had not seen before. 
  &quot;Didn't I ask you not to tell him?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't,&quot; replied the pirate-captain in a whisper. &quot;'E was goin'  to  squeal on us, an' I bagged 'im! 'E's a prisoner!&quot; He pronounced the   last words with a tragic emphasis. 
  Despite herself, the girl smiled. But Jim was a barrier between   herself and the man. 
  &quot;I wish you could get rid of him in some way,&quot; she murmured. There  was  an appealing look in her eyes, and the boy's face became very  sober.  He walked back and whispered among his men. After a little they   approached the prisoner and coolly proceeded to tie his hands and   feet. The man looked at the girl and laughed, but this time she had   turned her back toward him. Soon she heard a noise which grew   suspiciously louder until out of curiosity she glanced over her   shoulder. The five pirates had dragged their helplessly bound prisoner   to the edge of the sloop, and he was already half-way over when she   shrieked out the commander's name. 
  &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she cried. 
  &quot;Gettin' rid of 'im!&quot; shouted Captain Jim. &quot;Now, men, one, two&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Stop!&quot; she screamed. &quot;James, you're a&#8212;you're a&#8212;&quot; she stopped,  and  the pirate-chief knew that he was in disgrace. 
  &quot;A clever joke!&quot; growled the man, &quot;a blamed clever joke!&quot; Jim  Falkner  knew that there was some good reason why he should free his  prisoner,  and he did so. For a long time after that he kept very  quiet. Two or  three times the man spoke to the girl but she deigned no  reply. At  last she called to Jim, and the boy crept up to her, feeling  that he  had lost all favour in her eyes; but she reached out and put  an arm  around him, and the pirate-captain felt as though he would  burst with  joy. 
  &quot;James, where are we going?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;I dunno,&quot; he replied. &quot;We're just sailin'. We might hit land any   time.&quot; 
  &quot;I know, but what land may we hit?&quot; 
  Captain Jim became nervous. He clawed at the rotten rail of the  sloop  and wondered if he had better guess something at random. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I ain't sure,&quot; he said truthfully. &quot;Mebby we're goin' t'ward   Canada, mebby we're goin' t'ward&#8212;what's that United States state off   there?&quot; He pointed, and the girl told him that it was Ohio. 
  &quot;Well, mebby we'll hit that,&quot; he concluded hopefully. 
  For a long time after that Miss Virginia sat very still, her face   turned out to the darkness of the lake ahead, and Jim tried hard to   picture in his mind the things she might be thinking about. Her arm   was still around him, and gave him some comfort. 
  &quot;You&#8212;you're mad?&quot; he dared to whisper at last. 
  &quot;Just a little, James,&quot; she replied. &quot;But not at you,&quot; she quickly   added, with a reassuring pressure of her arm. Captain Jim felt that   she was going to say something more to him soon, and he waited   patiently, peering up into her face now and then. 
  &quot;You wouldn't shoot, ever, would you, James?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;No-oo-oo-oo,&quot; replied the pirate-chief doubtfully. 
  Miss Virginia gave a relieved sigh. &quot;I'm so glad,&quot; she said. &quot;I   wouldn't have you hurt him, but&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;But what?&quot; urged the pirate-chief. 
  &quot;When we reach land I want you to get him away from me. I don't  want  him to be near me or know where I go. Will you?&quot; 
  Captain Jim said that he would, and during the next hour he  invented a  scheme so big that he could hardly hold it. Once, filled  with a  knowledge of his power, he came up close to his prisoner and  grinned  sardonically in his face. The night passed tediously after  this&#8212;at  least to the girl and the man. The girl especially was  becoming more  and more miserable. She begged the boy to find out from  his prisoner  what time it was, and inwardly prayed that something  would happen soon  to relieve the situation. A little before dawn her  prayer was  answered. Warning first came in a slight jar and a scraping  under the  Lady Gwendolyn as though she were passing over drifting  brush. Then  came a jolt which flung the girl to the bottom of the  sloop, and above  her cry of alarm there sounded a shrill yell of  terror from one of the  pirates as he was hurled head foremost into the  lake. The man had half  gathered the girl in his arms when the boy who  had been flung  overboard stuck his head over the edge of the boat. 
  &quot;Land ho!&quot; he yelled lustily. 
  &quot;Where 'way?&quot; cried Captain Jim. 
  &quot;We're on it!&quot; informed the partly submerged pirate. &quot;I'm standin'  on  bottom now.&quot; 
  Jim saw the girl struggling with his prisoner, but before he could   lend her assistance she had freed herself. The man said something   which he could not understand, then turned and jumped into the lake.   The pirate-captain could hear him splashing on his way to the shore. 
  &quot;He's gone!&quot; said he. There was a note of disappointment in his  voice  as he saw the end of the great achievement which he had planned. 
  &quot;I'm glad, James,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;Now, how am I going to get   ashore?&quot; 
  &quot;Wade,&quot; advised the pirate promptly. &quot;It ain't over yer head!&quot; 
  To prove his assertion he dropped over the side, and found the  water  only up to his arm-pits. &quot;You afraid?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Noo-o-o-o-o,&quot; said the girl hesitatingly, &quot;but&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You needn't undress,&quot; comforted Captain Jim. 
  Miss Virginia laughed, and the man ashore, hearing her merriment,   swore to himself as he strode up from the beach. 
  &quot;I'll have to change my clothes afterward, James. If you'll be very   careful, and will carry this bag without getting it wet, I'll follow   you.&quot; 
  Captain Jim reached up for the bag and waded ashore with it.   Immediately after him came the girl, and after her trailed all of the   pirates but one, who remained behind to care for the Lady Gwendolyn.   Then the pirate-chief and his men went a dozen rods up the beach and   built a big fire out of driftwood. By the time it was burning well the   girl rejoined them wearing a beautiful, clinging, creamy dress that   made them all stare in open-mouthed admiration. She went straight up   to the chief and gave him a hug. 
  &quot;Dear Jim,&quot; she cried,  &quot;you're a&#8212;you're a brick! And every one of   your men is a brick!&quot; She knew that word expressed worlds to the   chief. Then she went from pirate to pirate and kissed each of them,   and thanked them so beautifully for all that they had done for her   that they were ready to get down and eat sand for her if she requested   it. After a while, one of the pirates went out into the dim dawn and   returned not many minutes afterward with the information that they   were wrecked &quot;on an island no bigger'n Grand Circus Park,&quot; which meant   that there were about half a dozen acres in it. 
  In the firelight the girl's face showed her alarm. &quot;I know! It must  be  Middle Sister Island!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Oh, James!&quot; there was a sob  in  her voice. &quot;There isn't a soul on it, and nobody ever comes here!  Oh,  dear&#8212;dear&#8212;dear!&quot; Captain Jim knew that she was really crying  now,  with her face buried in her arms, and he gulped hard two or three   times and silently beckoned his men away. He knew what was the matter,   too. She was afraid of the man. He told his men this, and he revealed   other things to them. Then he signalled the other pirate from the Lady   Gwendolyn, and all of them went out silently as shadows in a search   for the escaped prisoner. In Captain Jim's great scheme force was not   to play a large part, for he had reasoned that the man would be more   than their equal, unless he shot him, and that he had promised the   girl not to do. He would lie to him. He would tell him that the girl   wished to talk with him, but that he and his men would allow him to go   near the girl only as a prisoner, with his hands tied behind his back.   After the man's arms were helpless Jim was sure that he would be an   easy prey. Then he would inform him that the girl never wanted to see   him again, and that he and his crew were therefore doing their duty. 
  The girl had raised her tear-stained face just in time to see  Captain  Falkner and his men disappear. She knew that they were not  deserting  her, so she sat beside the fire and cried and shivered and  laughed by  turns, until the day came in a ribbon of red over the lake.  Then the  pirates returned. One of them was limping grievously, and his  dirty  face had been cleansed in streaks by many tears. Shamefacedly  Captain  Jim showed one closed and swollen eye and an upper lip that  bulged.  But there was something in his manner which spoke of triumph. 
  &quot;We had a scrap,&quot; he explained, his articulation a little thick   because of the condition of his lip. He did not know that the girl   misunderstood him. She looked from the limping, tear-stained pirate to   Captain Jim's battered countenance, and mentally concluded that the   two had engaged in combat. 
  &quot;You shouldn't fight,&quot; she reproved, trying to keep a sober face.  But  the humour of the situation overcame her, and she smiled. Jim  Falkner  was delighted. He could see that she was already greatly  relieved at  being freed of the man. 
  &quot;We done 'im good and plenty this time!&quot; he further elucidated,  edging  up to her confidentially. 
  &quot;We!&quot; exclaimed the girl, looking pityingly at the other injured   pirate, who was standing almost entirely upon one leg and grinning   cheerfully. &quot;We, did you say? How many of you attacked him?&quot; 
  &quot;The hull of us!&quot; said the pirate-chief. He could not account for  the  girl's silence. He expected some words of approbation, and not   receiving them soon turned his attention to the stranded sloop. Some   weeks previously the pirates had resurrected the Lady Gwendolyn from a   mud-bar where for several years she had been allowed to rot and warp.   There was not a sound board in her, and in the collision with the   shore she had crushed in a half of her bottom. Undismayed by the loss   of their craft, the pirates whistled and shouted in the joy of their   adventure as they brought their stores ashore and piled them near the   dying fire. Captain Falkner's provisions began with a peck of potatoes   and ended with an emaciated strip of bacon. 
  For a time the girl watched the pirates' operations with interest.   Then she strolled slowly along the beach, looking sharply to guard   against an encounter with the man, whom she still desired to evade.   She wondered where he had gone. From a point which she soon gained she   could see down both sides of the island, but he was not in sight. Her   curiosity became acute. She continued her walk until she had entirely   encompassed the island. Captain Jim had roasted a few potatoes and   fried some bacon, and the choicest of the fare he had placed on a tin   plate for the girl. 
  &quot;We're goin' to build a raft,&quot; he informed her soon after. &quot;When we   get it built we'll go out there 'n' be picked up.&quot; 
  He pointed out over the lake where, two or three miles away, a  trail  of smoke marked the ships' highway. All that morning the pirates   worked like beavers. By noon the raft was completed. With ropes and   wire taken from the sloop, pieces of wreckage and driftwood had been   fastened together, and in the centre of the crude craft had been   erected a short mast bearing a part of the Lady Gwendolyn's sail. All   of this the chief proudly pointed out to Miss Virginia. 
  &quot;And do you expect me to ride on that?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;Sure not!&quot; replied the pirate-captain. &quot;We're going out there 'n'   stop a ship. Then we'll come back 'n' resky you.&quot; He spoke with   confidence, and in watching their embarkation the girl forgot that she   was being left alone with the man. Not until the pirates were well out   did she think of this, and then she screamed to them and waved   frantically for Captain Jim to return. The chief seemed to comprehend,   for his voice came back in a faint but cheerful shout: 
  &quot;He won't hurt y', Miss Virgin'y, we've settled for him!&quot; 
  The girl wondered what he meant. She was not alarmed at first  because  she knew that the man was big enough to care for himself. But  as the  afternoon passed and the raft became only a speck out in the  lake, a  fear that something had really happened to her lover began to  possess  her. If the man had suddenly appeared and had held out his  arms to her  she would have gone into them promptly. Her pique had  partly  disappeared at breakfast that morning. It was entirely gone  now. She  longed for her adventure to come to an end, and with only the   lonesomeness of the lake about her and that silent, mysterious bit of   wilderness behind her, fear came quickly where before there had been   anger and defiance. And soon after the sky darkened until it was   almost as gloomy as at evening. An occasional lightning flash streaked   the sky. Up out of the south came the distant rumbling of thunder. The   girl wanted to cry aloud, but something seemed to command her not to   break the heavy silence, that preceded the storm, so she only sobbed   as she hurried around the island again. She thought of the pirates,   and prayed that some ship would pick them up before the wind came.   Then she looked up fearfully at the black growth of trees in the   centre of the island, in which handfuls of wind flung out by the   approaching tempest made mournful, thrilling sounds. Up there was her   lover. Perhaps he was dead. She drew nearer until she stared wide-eyed   into a thickness that was fast growing black. 
  &quot;Dick!&quot; she called softly. &quot;Dick! Dick!&quot; She parted a mass of  bushes.  One step, two, three, and she was enveloped in the gloom.  Almost above  her head the sky opened in a panel of fire, and there  came after it a  rumble of thunder that seemed to jar the earth under  her feet. For a  time there was so absolute that she could hear her  heart. 
  &quot;Dick! Dick! Where are you?&quot; 
  She went in deeper. Foot by foot she penetrated, trembling,  listening,  until she could not tell from which direction she had come.  She  stumbled between rocks, she scratched her face and hands on thorn-   covered vines, and then she came to an open spot. In the edge of that   opening was the man. He was sitting with his back against a sapling,   behind which his hands were tied. In front of him was a swaying bush,   and suspended from the bush by means of a string was a chunk of bacon,   at which the man was pecking like a bird. He was manoeuvring for a   nibble when the girl saw him. She stood for an instant as silent as   the rocks about her. Then she ran to him. 
  &quot;Dick! I've found you! Thank God, I've found you!&quot; And her arms  were  around him. 
  The next afternoon the girl and the man came close down to where  the  remnants of the Lady Gwendolyn lay scattered upon the beach. A  quarter  of a mile out a sail was bearing down upon the island. It was  a trim  little yacht, with canvas as white as snow; brass glittered  along her  gunwale, a long pennant fluttered at her peak, and suddenly,  as she  luffed under a gust of wind, a large square flag filled out  below it.  Boldly designed upon this was the skull and cross-bones. 
  &quot;I told you we could depend upon Captain Jim,&quot; said the girl. 
  The pirate-chief was first ashore. He was very sober when he saw  the  man, but the girl met him with open arms. 
  &quot;It's all right, James,&quot; she said, hugging him to her. &quot;There's  been  an awful big mistake, dear, and when you take us ashore I'm going  to  marry him! And, Jim&quot;&#8212;she hugged the astonished little fellow  tighter  &#8212;&quot;you're going to be our boy now, for ever and for ever!&quot; 
  &quot;And we'll get you a bigger and better ship than any you ever had,   James Falkner,&quot; the man added. &quot;But, tell me, boy, where did you get   that boat?&quot; 
  The last spark of piracy in Captain Jim Falkner rose for a moment   triumphant. He straightened with a bit of his old pride. 
  &quot;We cut 'er out!&quot; he said briefly.
