  Professor Robinson slumbered on, blissfully unconscious of the  events  that had made the night an exciting one. When he came  downstairs early  in the morning he strayed accidentally into the room  where Dick Ranney  was confined under guard. Being short-sighted, he  did not see the  captive until Ranney hailed him. 
  &quot;Good morning, professor!&quot; 
  The professor skipped nimbly back and gazed at the prisoner in  alarm. 
  &quot;You here?&quot; he exclaimed. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Dick, grimly. 
  &quot;But how did it happen?&quot; 
  &quot;I came to the hotel a little after midnight to make you a call,  but  went first to the room of your assistant.&quot; 
  &quot;What, after midnight?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. It is hardly necessary to explain what happened. Here I am!&quot; 
  &quot;Ah, my friend,&quot; said the professor, &quot;this may be fortunate for  you,  if it leads you to consider and reflect upon the errors of your  life.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, stow that!&quot; exclaimed Ranney, in disgust. &quot;I'm not that kind  of a  man. I follow my own course and take the consequences.&quot; 
  The professor shook his head sadly and went out. Later, when he  heard  what had happened, he said to Walter: &quot;If that man had come into  my  room at midnight I should have died of fright.&quot; 
  &quot;There was no occasion to be alarmed,&quot; returned Walter, &quot;We were   prepared for him.&quot; 
  &quot;I&#8212;I am afraid I was never cut out for a hero,&quot; said the  professor.  &quot;My nervous system is easily upset.&quot; 
  The plain truth was that Professor Robinson was a born coward,  though  he was stronger and more muscular, probably, than Grant,  Sherman or  Sheridan. But it is not brawn and muscle that make a hero,  but the  spirit that animates the man, and of this spirit the professor  had  very little. Yet in after years when he had retired from business  and  was at leisure to live over again his past life, he used to tell  with  thrilling effect how he and Walter had trapped and captured the  daring  outlaw, Dick Ranney, and received admiring compliments upon his   courage and prowess, which he complacently accepted, though he knew   how little he deserved them. 
  It so chanced that Stilwell was the county seat and court was in   session at that time, and nearly ready to wind up its business. It was   owing to this circumstance that the trial of Dick Ranney was held at   once. By request Walter and the professor remained to bear testimony   against the prisoner, and Manning also strengthened the case against   him. Within less than a week the trial was concluded, a verdict of   guilty was brought in, and the prisoner sentenced to a ten years' term   of imprisonment. 
  Dick Ranney heard the sentence with philosophical calmness. 
  &quot;My good friend,&quot; said the professor, &quot;I trust that in your long  years  of confinement you will reflect upon&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Don't worry about that,&quot; interrupted Dick. &quot;I sha'n't be in prison   three months.&quot; 
  &quot;But I thought&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Bolts and bars can be broken, professor. When I do get out I will   inquire what part of the country you are in and will make you a   visit.&quot; 
  This promise, so far from cheering Professor Robinson, seemed to   disconcert him extremely, and he shortened his talk with his road   acquaintance. 
  After the trial was over Walter was waited upon by an official, who   tendered him the reward of one thousand dollars offered for the   capture of Dick Ranney. 
  &quot;Mr. Manning has waived his claim in your favor,&quot; explained the   official, &quot;and therefore there is no question that to you belongs the   reward.&quot; 
  &quot;There are two others whose services deserve recognition,&quot; said   Walter; &quot;the two constables who made the arrest.&quot; 
  &quot;There is no additional sum at our command,&quot; explained the  official. 
  &quot;None is needed,&quot; returned Walter. &quot;I shall pay each a hundred  dollars  out of the reward which has been awarded to me.&quot; 
  It is needless to say that the two constables, both of whom were  poor  men with large families, were very grateful for this substantial   recognition of their services.
