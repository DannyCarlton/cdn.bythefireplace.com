Peter (flourish-in-red) Quick (flourish-in-green) Banta (period-in-blue)  is the style whereby he is known to Our Square.    
Summertimes he is a prop and ornament of Coney, that isle of the blest,  whose sands he models into gracious forms and noble sentiments, in  anticipation of the casual dime or the munificent quarter, wherewith, if  you have low, Philistine tastes or a kind heart, you have perhaps  aforetime rewarded him. In the off-season the thwarted passion of color  possesses him; and upon the flagstones before Thornsen's Elite  Restaurant, which constitutes his canvas, he will limn you a full-rigged  ship in two colors, a portrait of the heavyweight champion in three, or,  if financially encouraged, the Statue of Liberty in four. These be,  however, concessions to popular taste. His own predilection is for  chaste floral designs of a symbolic character borne out and expounded by  appropriate legends. Peter Quick Banta is a devotee of his art.    
Giving full run to his loftier aspirations, he was engaged, one April  day, upon a carefully represented lilac with a butterfly about to light  on it, when he became cognizant of a ragged rogue of an urchin regarding  him with a grin. Peter Quick Banta misinterpreted this sign of interest.    
"What d'ye think of <i>that</i>?" he said triumphantly, as he sketched in a  set of side-whiskers (presumably intended for antennae) upon the  butterfly.    
"Rotten," was the prompt response.    
"<i>What</i>!" said the astounded artist, rising from his knees.    
"Punk."    
Peter Quick Banta applied the higher criticism to the urchin's nearest  ear. It was now that connoisseur's turn to be affronted. Picking himself  out of the gutter, he placed his thumb to his nose, and wiggled his  finger in active and reprehensible symbolism, whilst enlarging upon his  original critique, in a series of shrill roars:    
"Rotten! Punk! No good! Swash! Flubdub! Sacre tas de--de--piffle!"  Already his vocabulary was rich and plenteous, though, in those days,  tainted by his French origin.    
He then, I regret to say, spat upon the purple whiskers of the butterfly  and took refuge in flight. The long stride of Peter Quick Banta soon  overtook him. Silently struggling he was haled back to the profaned  temple of Art.    
"Now, young feller," said Peter Quick Banta. "Maybe you think you could  do it better." The world-old retort of the creative artist to  his critic!    
"Any fool could," retorted the boy, which, in various forms, is almost  as time-honored as the challenge.    
Suspecting that only tactful intervention would forestall possible  murder, I sauntered over from my bench. But the decorator of sidewalks  had himself under control.    
"Try it," he said grimly.    
The boy avidly seized the crayons extended to him.    
"You want me to draw a picture? There?"    
"If you don't, I'll break every bone in your body."    
The threat left its object quite unmoved. He pointed a crayon at Peter  Quick Banta's creation.    
"What is that? A bool-rush?"    
"It's a laylock; that's what it is."    
"And the little bird that goes to light--"    
"That ain't a bird and you know it." Peter Quick Banta breathed hard.  "That's a butterfly."    
"I see. But the lie-lawc, it drop--so!" The gesture was inimitable. "And  the butterfly, she do not come down, plop! She float--so!" The grimy  hands fluttered and sank.    
"They do, do they? Well, you put it down on the sidewalk."    
From that moment the outside world ceased to exist for the urchin. He  fell to with concentrated fervor, while Peter Quick Banta and I diverted  the traffic. Only once did he speak:    
"Yellow," he said, reaching, but not looking up.    
Silently the elder artist put the desired crayon in his hand. When the  last touches were done, the boy looked up at us, not boastfully, but  with supreme confidence.    
"There!" said he.    
It was crude. It was ill-proportioned. The colors were raw. The  arrangements were false.    
<i>But</i>--the lilac bloomed. <i>And</i>--the butterfly hovered. The artist had  spoken through his ordained medium and the presentment of life stood  forth. I hardly dared look at Peter Quick Banta. But beneath his uncouth  exterior there lay a great and magnanimous soul.    
"Son," said he, "you're a wonder. Wanta keep them crayons?"    
Unable to speak for the moment, the boy took off his ragged cap in one  of the most gracious gestures I have ever witnessed, raising dog-like  eyes of gratitude to his benefactor. Tactfully, Peter Quick Banta  proceeded to expound for my benefit the technique of the drawing, giving  the youngster time to recover before the inevitable questioning began.    
"Where did you learn that?"    
"Nowhere. Had a few drawing lessons at No. 19."    
"Would you like to work for me?"    
"How?"    
Peter Quick Banta pointed to the sidewalk.    
"That?" The boy laughed happily. "That ain't work. That's fun."    
So the partnership was begun, the boy, whose name was Julien Tennier  (soon simplified into Tenney for local use), sharing Peter Quick Banta's  roomy garret. Success, modest but unfailing, attended it from the first  appearance of the junior member of the firm at Coney Island, where, as  the local cognoscenti still maintain, he revolutionized the art and  practice of the "sand-dabs." Out of the joint takings grew a bank  account. Eventually Peter Quick Banta came to me about the boy's  education.    
"He's a swell," said Peter Quick Banta. "Look at that face! I don't care  if he did crawl outa the gutter. I'm an artist and I reco'nize  aristocracy when I see it. And I want him brung up accordin'."    
So I inducted the youngster into such modest groves of learning as an  old, half-shelved pedagogue has access to, and when the Bonnie Lassie  came to Our Square to make herself and us famous with her tiny bronzes  (this was before she had captured, reformed, and married Cyrus the  Gaunt), I took him to her and he fell boyishly and violently in love  with her beauty and her genius alike, all of which was good for his  developing soul. She arranged for his art training.    
"But you know, Dominie," she used to say, wagging her head like a  profound and thoughtful bird; "this is all very foolish and shortsighted  on my part. Five years from now that gutter-godling of yours will be  doing work that will make people forget poor little me and my poor  little figurines."    
To which I replied that even if it were true, instead of the veriest  nonsense, about Julien Tenney or any one else ever eclipsing her, she  would help him just the same!    
But five years from then Julien had gone over to the Philistines.    
<b>II</b>    
Justly catalogued, Roberta Holland belonged to the idle rich. She would  have objected to the latter classification, averring that, with the  rising cost of furs and automobile upkeep, she had barely enough to keep  her head above the high tide of Fifth Avenue prices. As to idleness, she  scorned the charge. Had she not, throughout the war, performed  prodigious feats of committee work, all of it meritorious and some of it  useful? She had. It had left her with a dangerous and destructive  appetite for doing good to people. Aside from this, Miss Roberta was a  distracting young person. Few looked at her once without wanting to look  again, and not a few looked again to their undoing.    
Being-done-good-to is, I understand, much in vogue in the purlieus of  Fifth Avenue where it is practiced with skill and persistence by a large  and needy cult of grateful recipients. Our Square doesn't take to it. As  recipients we are, I fear, grudgingly grateful. So when Miss Holland  transferred her enthusiasms and activities to our far-away corner of the  world she met with a lack of response which might have discouraged one  with a less new and superior sense of duty to the lower orders. She came  to us through the Bonnie Lassie, guardian of the gateway from the upper  strata to our humbler domain, who--Pagan that she is!--indiscriminately  accepts all things beautiful simply for their beauty. Having arrived,  Miss Holland proceeded to organize us with all the energy of  high-blooded sweet-and-twenty and all the imperiousness of confident  wealth and beauty. She organized an evening sewing-circle for women  whose eyelids would not stay open after their long day's work. She  formed cultural improvement classes for such as Leon Coventry, the  printer, who knows half the literatures of the world, and MacLachan, the  tailor, to whom Carlyle is by way of being light reading. She delivered  some edifying exhortations upon the subject of Americanism to Polyglot  Elsa, of the Elite Restaurant (who had taken upon her sturdy young  shoulders the support of an old mother and a paralytic sister, so that  her two brothers might enlist for the war--a detail of patriotism which  the dispenser of platitudes might have learned by judicious inquiry).  And so forth and so on. Miss Roberta Holland meant well, but she had  many things to learn and no master to teach her.    
Yet when the flu epidemic returned upon us, she stood by, efficient,  deft, and gallant, though still imperious, until the day when she  clashed her lath-and-tinsel sword of theory against the tempered steel  of the Little Red Doctor's experience. Said the Little Red Doctor (who  was pressed for time at the moment): "Take orders. Or get out. Which?"    
She straightened like a soldier. "Tell me what you want done."    
At the end of the onset, when he gave her her release from volunteer  service, she turned shining eyes upon him. "I've never been so treated  in my life! You're a bully and a brute."    
"You're a brick," retorted the Little Red Doctor. "I'll send for you  next time Our Square needs help."    
"I'll come," said she, and they shook hands solemnly.    
Thereafter Our Square felt a little more lenient toward her  ministrations, and even those of us who least approved her activities  felt the stir of radiance and color which she brought with her.    
On a day when the local philanthropy market was slack, and Miss Holland,  seated in the Bonnie Lassie's front window, was maturing some new and  benign outrage upon our sensibilities, she called out to the sculptress  at work on a group:    
"There's a queer man making queer marks on your sidewalk."    
"That's Peter Quick Banta. He's a fellow artist."    
"And another man, young, with a big, maney head like an amiable lion;  quite a beautiful lion. He's making more marks."    
"Let him make all he wants."    
"They're waving their arms at each other. At least the queer man is. I  think they're going to fight."    
"They won't. It's only an academic discussion on technique."    
"Who is the young one?"    
"He's the ruin of what might have been a big artist."    
"No! Is he? What did it? Drink?"    
"Does he look it?"    
The window-gazer peered more intently at the debaters below. "It's a  peculiar face. Awfully interesting, though. He's quite poorly dressed.  Does he need money? Is that what's wrong?"    
"That's it, Bobbie," returned the Bonnie Lassie with a half-smile. "He  needs the money."    
The rampant philanthropist stirred within Miss Roberta Holland's fatally  well-meaning soul. "Would it be a case where I could help? I'd love to  put a real artist back on his feet. Are you sure he's real?"    
On the subject of Art, the Bonnie Lassie is never anything but sincere  and direct, however much she may play her trickeries with lesser  interests, such as life and love and human fate.    
"No; I'm not. If he were, I doubt whether he'd have let himself go so  wrong."    
"Perhaps it isn't too late," said the amateur missionary hopefully. "Is  he a man to whom one could offer money?"    
The Bonnie Lassie's smile broadened without change in its subtle  quality. "Julien Tenney isn't exactly a pauper. He just thinks he can't  afford to do the kind of thing he wants and ought to."    
"What ought he to do?"    
"Paint--paint--paint!" said the Bonnie Lassie vehemently. "Five years  ago I believe he had the makings of a great painter in him. And now look  what he's doing!"    
"Making marks on sidewalks, you mean?"    
"Worse. Commercial art."    
"Designs and that sort of thing?"    
"Do you ever look at the unearthly beautiful, graceful and gloriously  dressed young super-Americans who appear in the advertisements, riding  in super-cars or wearing super-clothes or brushing super-teeth with  super-toothbrushes?"    
"I suppose so," said the girl vaguely.    
"He draws those."    
"Is that what you call pot-boiling?"    
"One kind."    
"And I suppose it pays just a pittance."    
"Well," replied the Bonnie Lassie evasively, "he sticks to it, so it  must support him."    
"Then I'm going to help him."    
"'To fulfill his destiny,' is the accepted phrase," said the Bonnie  Lassie wickedly. "I'll call him in for you to look over. But you'd best  leave the arrangements for a later meeting."    
Being summoned, Julien Tenney entered the house as one quite at home  despite his smeary garb of the working artist. His presentation to Miss  Holland was as brief as it was formal, for she took her departure  at once.    
"Who is she?" asked Julien, staring after her.    
"Bobbie Holland, a gilded butterfly from uptown."    
"What's she doing here?"    
"Good."    
"O Lord!" said he in pained tones. "Has she got a Cause?"    
"Naturally."    
"Philanthropist?"    
"Worse."    
"There ain't no sich a animile."    
"There is. She's a patron of art."    
"Wow!"    
"Yes. She's going to patronize you."    
"Not if I see her first. How do <i>I</i> qualify as a subject?"    
"She considered you a wasted life."    
"Where does she get that idea?"    
The Bonnie Lassie removed a small, sharp implement from the left eye of  a stoical figurine and pointed it at herself.    
"Do you think that's fair?" demanded the indignant youth.    
The Bonnie Lassie reversed the implement and pointed it at him. "Do you  or do you not," she challenged, "invade our humble precincts in a  five-thousand-dollar automobile?"    
"It's my only extravagance."    
"Do you or do you not maintain a luxurious apartment in Gramercy Park,  when you are not down here posing in your attic as an honest  working-man?"    
"Oh, see here, Mrs. Staten, I won't stand for that!" he expostulated.  "You know perfectly well I keep my room here because it's the only place  I can work in quietly--"    
"And because Peter Quick Banta would break his foolish old heart if you  left him entirely," supplemented the sculptress.    
Julien flushed and stood looking like an awkward child. "Did you tell  all this stuff to Miss Holland?" he asked.    
"Oh, no! She thinks that your pot-boiling is a desperate and barely  sufficient expedient to keep the wolf from the door. So she is planning  to help you realize your destiny."    
"Which is?" he queried with lifted brows.    
"To be a great painter."    
The other winced. "As you know, I've meant all along, as soon as I've  saved enough--"    
"Oh, yes; <i>I</i> know," broke in the Bonnie Lassie, who can be quite  ruthless where Art is concerned, "and <i>you</i> know; but time flies and  hell is paved with good intentions, and if you want to be that kind of a  pavement artist--well, I think Peter Quick Banta is a better."    
"Do you suppose she'd let me paint her?" he asked abruptly.    
If statuettes could blink, the one upon which the Bonnie Lassie was  busied would certainly have shrouded its vision against the dazzling  radiance of her smile, for this was coming about as she had planned it  from the moment when she had caught the flash of startled surprise and  wonder in his eyes, as they first rested on Bobbie Holland. Here, she  had guessed, might be the agency to bring Julien Tenney to his artistic  senses; and even so it was now working out. But all she said was--and  she said it with a sort of venomous blandness--"My dear boy, you  can't paint."    
"Can't I! Just because I'm a little out of practice--"    
"Two years, isn't it, since you've touched a palette?"    
"Give me a chance at such a model as she is! That's all I ask."    
"Do you think her so pretty?" inquired the sculptress disparagingly.    
"Pretty? She's the loveliest thing that--" Catching his hostess's smile  he broke off. "You'll admit it's a well-modeled face," he said  professionally; "and--and--well, unusual."    
"Pooh! 'Dangerous' is the word. Remember it," warned the Bonnie Lassie.  "She's a devastating whirlwind, that child, and she comes down here  partly to get away from the wreckage. Now, if you play your part  cleverly--"    
"I'm not going to play any part."    
"Then it's all up. How is a patroness of Art going to patronize you,  unless you're a poor and struggling young artist, living from hand to  mouth by arduous pot-boiling? You won't have to play a part as far as  the pot-boiling goes," added his monitress viciously. "Only, don't let  her know that the rewards of your shame run to high-powered cars and  high-class apartments. Remember, you're poor but honest. Perhaps she'll  give you money."    
"Perhaps she won't," retorted the youth explosively.    
"Oh, it will be done tactfully; never fear. I'll bring her around to see  you and you'll have to work the sittings yourself."    
As a setting for the abode of a struggling beginner, Julien's attic  needed no change. It was a whim of his to keep it bare and simple. He  worked out his pictorial schemes of elegance best in an environment  where there was nothing to distract the eye. One could see that Miss  Roberta Holland, upon her initial visit, approved its stark and cleanly  poverty. (Yes, I was there to see; the Bonnie Lassie had taken me along  to make up that first party.) Having done the honors, Julien dropped  into the background, and presently was curled up over a drawing-board,  sketching eagerly while the Bonnie Lassie and I held the doer of good  deeds in talk. Now the shrewd and able tribe of advertising managers do  not pay to any but a master-draughtsman the prices which "J.T."--with  an arrow transfixing the initials--gets; and Julien was as deft and  rapid as he was skillful. Soon appreciating what was in progress, the  visitor graciously sat quite still. At the conclusion she held out her  hand for the cardboard.    
To be a patroness of Art does not necessarily imply that one is an  adequate critic. Miss Holland contemplated what was a veritable little  gem in black-and-white with cool approbation.    
"Quite clever," she was pleased to say. "Would you care to sell it?"    
"I don't think it would be exactly--" A stern glance from the Bonnie  Lassie cut short the refusal. He swallowed the rest of the sentence.    
"Would ten dollars be too little?" asked the visitor with bright  beneficence.    
"Too much," he murmured. (The Bonnie Lassie says that with a little  crayoning and retouching he could have sold it for at least fifty  times that.)    
The patroness delicately dropped a bill on the table.    
"Could you some day find time to let me try you in oils?" he asked.    
"Does that take long?" she said doubtfully. "I'm very busy."    
"You really should try it, Bobbie," put in the crafty Bonnie Lassie. "It  might give him the start he needs."    
What arguments she added later is a secret between the two women, but  she had her way. The Bonnie Lassie always does. So the bare studio was  from time to time irradiated with Bobbie Holland's youthful loveliness  and laughter. For there was much laughter between those two. Shrewdly  foreseeing that this bird of paradise would return to the bare cage only  if it were made amusing for her, Julien exerted himself to the utmost to  keep her mind at play, and, as I can vouch who helped train him, there  are few men of his age who can be as absorbing a companion as Julien  when he chooses to exert his charm. All the time, he was working with a  passionate intensity on the portrait; letting everything else go;  tossing aside the most remunerative offers; leaving his mail unopened;  throwing himself intensely, recklessly, into this one single enterprise.  The fact is, he had long been starved for color and was now satiating  his soul with it. Probably it was largely impersonal with him at first.  The Bonnie Lassie, wise of heart that she is, thinks so. But that could  not last. Men who are not otherwise safeguarded do not long retain a  neutral attitude toward such creatures of grace and splendor as  Bobbie Holland.    
Between them developed a curious relation. It was hardly to be called  friendship; he was not, to Bobbie's recognition, a habitant of her  world. Nor, certainly, was it anything more. Julien would as soon have  renounced easel and canvas as have taken advantage of her coming to make  love to her. In this waif of our gutters and ward of our sidewalk artist  inhered a spirit of the most punctilious and rigid honor, the gift,  perhaps, of some forgotten ancestry. More and more, as the intimacy  grew, he deserted his uptown haunts and stuck to the attic studio above  the rooms where, in the dawning days of prosperity, he had installed  Peter Quick Banta in the effete and scandalous luxury of two rooms, a  bath, and a gas stove. Yet the picture advanced slowly which is the more  surprising in that the exotic Bobbie seemed to find plenty of time for  sittings now. Between visits she took to going to the Metropolitan  Museum and conscientiously studying pictures and catalogues with a view  to helping her protege form sound artistic tastes. (When the Bonnie  Lassie heard that, she all but choked.) As for Julien!    
"This is all very well," he said, one day in the sculptress's studio;  "but sooner or later she's going to catch me at it."    
"What then?" asked the Bonnie Lassie, not looking up from her work.    
"She'll go away."    
"Let her go. Your portrait will be finished meantime, won't it?"    
"Oh, yes. That'll be finished."    
This time the Bonnie Lassie did look up. Immediately she looked back  again.    
"In any case she'll have to go away some day--won't she?"    
"I suppose so," returned he in a gloomy growl.    
"I warned you at the outset, 'Dangerous,'" she pointed out.    
They let it drop there. As for the effect upon the girl of Julien  Tenny's brilliant and unsettling personality, I could judge only as I  saw them occasionally together, she lustrous and exotic as a budding  orchid, he in the non-descript motley of his studio garb, serenely  unconscious of any incongruity.    
"Do you think," I asked the Bonnie Lassie, who was sharing my bench one  afternoon as Julien was taking the patroness of Art over to where her  car waited, "that she is doing him as much good as she thinks she is, or  ought to?"    
"Malice ill becomes one of your age, Dominie," said the Bonnie Lassie  with dignity.    
"I'm quite serious," I protested.    
"And very unjust. Bobbie is an adorable little person, when you know  her."    
"Does Julien know her well enough to have discovered a self-evident  fact?"    
"Only," pursued my companion, ignoring the question, "she is bored and a  little spoiled."    
"So she comes down here to escape being bored and to get more spoiled."    
"Julien won't spoil her."    
"He certainly doesn't appear to bore her."    
"She's having the tables turned on her without knowing it. Julien is  doing her a lot of good. Already she's far less beneficent and bountiful  and all that sort of stuff."    
"Lassie," said I, "what, if I may so express myself, is the big idea?"    
"Slang is an execrable thing from a professed scholar," she reproved.  "However, the big idea is that Julien is really painting. And it's  <i>mine</i>, that big idea."    
"Mightn't it be accompanied by a little idea to the effect that the  experience is likely to cost him pretty dear? What will be left when  Bobbie Holland goes?"    
"Pooh! Don't be an oracular sphinx," was all that I got for my pains.    
Nor did Miss Bobbie show any immediate symptoms of going. If the  painting seemed at times in danger of stagnation, the same could not be  said of the fellowship between painter and paintee. That nourished  along, and one day a vagrant wind brought in the dangerous element of  historical personalities. The wind, entering at the end of a session,  displaced a hanging above the studio door, revealing in bold script upon  the plastering Beranger's famous line:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Dans un grenier qu'on est bien a vingt ans!"</small></i></blockquote><br>
"Did you write that there?" asked the girl.    
"Seven long years ago. And meant it, every word."    
"How did you come to know Beranger?"    
"I'm French born."    
"'In a garret how good is life at twenty,'" she translated freely. "I  wouldn't have thought"--she turned her softly brilliant regard upon  him--"that life had been so good to you."    
"It has," was the rejoinder. "But never so good as now."    
"I've often wondered--you seem to know so many things--where you got  your education?"    
"Here and there and everywhere. It's only a patchwork sort of thing."  (Ungrateful young scoundrel, so to describe my two-hours-a-day of  brain-hammering, and the free run of my library.)    
"You're a very puzzling person," said she And when a woman says that to  a man, deep has begun to call to deep. (The Bonnie Lassie, who knows  everything, is my authority for the statement.)    
To her went the patroness of Art, on leaving Julien's "grenier" that  day.    
"Cecily," she said, in the most casual manner she could contrive, "who  <i>is</i> Julien Tenney?"    
"Nobody."    
"You know what I mean," pleaded the girl. "<i>What</i> is he?"    
"A brand snatched from the pot-boiling," returned the Bonnie Lassie,  quite pleased with her next turn, which was more than her companion was.    
"Please don't be clever. Be nice and tell me--"    
"'Be nice, sweet maid, and let who will be clever,'" declaimed the  Bonnie Lassie, who was feeling perverse that day. "You want me to define  his social status for you and tell you whether you'd better invite him  to dinner. You'd better not. He might swallow his knife."    
"You know he wouldn't!" denied the girl in resentful tones. "I've never  known any one with more instinctive good manners. He seems to go right  naturally."    
"All due to my influence and training," bragged the Bonnie Lassie. "I  helped bring him up."    
"Then you must know something of his antecedents."    
"Ask the Dominie. He says that Julien crawled out of a gutter with the  manners of a <i>preux chevalier</i>. Anyway, he never swallowed any of <i>my</i>  knives. Though he's had plenty of opportunity."    
"It's very puzzling," lamented Bobbie.    
"Why let it prey like a worm i' the bud of your mind? You're not going  to adopt him, perhaps?"    
For the moment Bobbie Holland's eyes were dreamy and her tongue  unguarded. "I don't know what I'm going to do with him," said she with a  gesture as of one who despairingly gives over an insoluble problem.    
"Umph!" said the Bonnie Lassie.    
And continued sculpting.    
<b>III</b>    
As Julien had prophesied, it was only a question of time when he would  be surprised by his patroness in his true garb and estate. The event  occurred as he was stepping from his touring-car to get his golf-clubs  from the hallway of his Gramercy Park apartment at the very moment when  Bobbie Holland emerged from the house next door. Both her hands flew  involuntarily to her cheeks, as she took in and wholly misinterpreted  his costume, which is not to be wondered at when one considers the  similarity of a golfing outfit to a chauffeur's livery.    
"Oh!" she cried out, as if something had hurt her.    
Julien, for once startled out of his accustomed poise, uncovered and  looked at her apprehensively.    
Her voice quivered a little as she asked, very low, "Do you <i>have</i> to do  that?"    
"Why--er--no," began the puzzled Julien, who failed for the moment to  perceive what of tragic portent inhered in a prospective afternoon of  golf. Her next words enlightened him.    
"I should think you might have let me help before taking a--servant's  position."    
"It's an honest occupation," he averred.    
"Do you do this--regularly?" she pursued with an effort.    
"Off and on. There's good money in it."    
"Oh!" she mourned again. Then: "You're doing this so that you can afford  to buy paints and canvas and--and things to paint me," she accused. "It  isn't fair!"    
"I'd do worse than this for that," he declared valiantly.    
Less than a fortnight later she caught him doing worse. She had ceased  to speak to him of his chauffeurdom because it seemed to cause him  painful embarrassment. (It did, and should have!) There had been a big  theater party, important enough to get itself detailed in the valuable  columns which the papers devote to such matters, and afterward supper at  the most expensive uptown restaurant, Miss Roberta Holland being one of  the listed guests. As she took her place at the table, she caught a  glimpse of an unmistakable figure disappearing through the waiter's  exit. And Julien Tenney, who had risen from his little supper party of  four (stag) hastily but just too late, on catching sight of her, saw  that he was recognized. Flight, instant and permanent, had been his  original intent. Now it would not do. Bolder measures must be devised.  He appealed to the head-waiter to help him carry out a joke, and that  functionary, developing a sense of humor under the stimulus of a  twenty-dollar bill, procured him on the spot an ill-fitting coat and a  black string tie, and gave him certain simple directions. When the  patroness of Art next observed the object of her patronage, he was  performing the humble but useful duties of an omnibus.    
Miss Holland suddenly lost a perfectly good and hitherto reliable  appetite.    
Nor was she the only member of the supper party to develop symptoms of  shock. The gilded and stalwart youth on her left, following her glance,  stared at the amateur servitor with protruding eyes, ceased to eat or  drink, and fell into a state of semi-coma, muttering at intervals an  expressive monosyllable.    
"Why not swear out loud, Caspar?" asked Bobbie presently. "It'll do you  less harm."    
"D'you see that chap over yonder? The big, fine-looking one fixing the  forks?"    
"Yes," said Bobbie faintly.    
"Well, that's--No, by thunder, it can't be!--Yes, by the red-hot hinges,  it <i>is!</i>"    
"Do you think you know him?"    
"Know him! I <i>know</i> him? He bunked in with me for two weeks at Grandpre.  He was captain of a machine-gun outfit sent down to help us clean out  that little wasp's nest. His name's Tenney, and if ever there was a  hellion in a fight! And see--what he's come to! My God!"    
"Well, don't cry about it," advised the girl, serenely, though it was  hard for her to keep her voice steady. "There's nothing to do about it,  is there?"    
"Isn't there!" retorted the youth, rising purposefully. "I'm going to  get him and find him a job that's fit for him if I have to take him into  partnership. Of all the dash-blanked-dod-blizzened--"    
"Caspar! What are you going to do? Don't. You'll embarrass him  frightfully."    
But he was already heading off his prey at the exit. Bobbie saw her  painter's face flame into welcome, then stiffen into dismay. The pair  vanished beyond the watcher's ken. On his return the gilded youth  behaved strangely. From time to time he shook his head. From time to  time he chuckled. And, while Bobbie was talking to her other neighbor,  he shot curious and amused glances at her. He told her nothing. But his  interest in his supper returned. Bobbie's didn't.    
To discuss the social aspects of menial service with a practitioner of  it who has been admitted to a certain implicit equality is a difficult  and delicate matter for a girl brought up in Roberta Holland's school.  Several times after the restaurant encounter she essayed it; trying both  the indirect approach and the method of extreme frankness. Neither  answered. Julien responded to her advances by alternate moods of extreme  gloom and slyly inexplicable amusement. Bobbie gave it up, concluding  that he was in a very queer mood, anyway. She was right. He was.    
The next episode of their progress took the form of a veritable  unmasking which, perversely enough, only fixed the mask tighter upon  Julien Tenney. By way of loosening up his wrist for the open season,  Peter Quick Banta had taken advantage of an amiable day to sketch out a  composite floral and faunal scheme on the flagging in front of  Thornsen's Elite Restaurant, when Miss Holland, in passing, paused to  observe and wonder. At the same moment, Julien hurrying around the  corner, all but ran her down. She nodded toward the decorator of  sidewalks.    
"Isn't he the funny man that you were with the first time I saw you?"    
"The very same," responded Julien with twinkling eyes.    
"What is he doing?"    
"He's one of the few remaining examples of the sidewalk or public-view  school of art."    
"Yes, but what does he do it for?"    
"His living."    
"Do people give him money for it? Do you think I might give him  something?" she asked, looking uncertainly at the artist, who, on hands  and knees and with tongue protruding, was putting a green head on a red  bird, too absorbed even to notice the onlookers.    
"I think he'd be tickled pink."    
She took a quarter from her purse, hesitated, then slipped it into her  companion's hand.    
"<i>You</i> give it to him. I think he'd like it better."    
"Oh, no; I don't think he'd like it at all. In fact, I doubt if he'd  take it from me."    
"Why not?"    
"Well, you see," explained Julien blandly, "we're rather intimately  connected." He raised his voice. "Hello, Dad!"    
The decorator furled his tongue, lifted his head, changed his crayon,  replied, "Hello, Lad," and continued his work. "What d' you think of  <i>that</i>?" he added, after a moment, triumphantly pointing a yellow crayon  at the green-headed red-bird.    
"Some parrot!" enthused Julien.    
"'T ain't a parrot. It's a nightingale," retorted the artist  indignantly. "You black-and-white fellows never do understand color."    
"It's a corker, anyway," said Julien. "Dad here's a--an art patron who  wants to contribute to the cause."    
The girl, whose face had become flushed and almost frightened, held out  her quarter.    
"I--I--don't know," she began. "I was interested in your picture and I  thought--Mr. Tenney said--"    
Peter Quick Banta took the coin with perfect dignity. "Thank you," said  he. "There ain't much appreciation of art just at this season. But if  you'll come down to Coney about June, I'll show you some sand-modeling  that <i>is</i> sand-modeling--'s much as five dollars a day I've taken  in there."    
Miss Holland recovered her social poise.    
"I'd like to very much," she said cheerfully.    
She and Julien walked on in silence. Suddenly he laughed, a little  jarringly. "Well," he said, "does that help you to place me?"    
"I'm not trying to place you," she answered.    
"Is that quite true?" he mocked.    
"No; it isn't. It's a downright lie," said Bobbie finding courage to  raise her eyes to his.    
"And now, I suppose, I shall be 'my good man' or something like that, to  you."    
"Do you think it likely?"    
"You called MacLachan that, you know," he reminded her.    
"Long ago. When I was--when I didn't understand Our Square."    
"And now, of course, our every feeling and thought is an open book to  your penetrating vision."    
Her lip quivered. "I don't know why you should want to be so hateful to  me."    
For a flashing second his eyes answered that appeal with a look that  thrilled and daunted her. "To keep from being something else that I've  no right to be," he muttered.    
"How many more sittings do you think it will take to finish the  picture?" she asked, striving to get on safer ground.    
"Only one or two, I suppose," he answered morosely.    
Such was Julien's condition of mind after the last sitting that he  actually left the precious portrait unguarded by neglecting to lock the  door of the studio on going out, and the Bonnie Lassie and I, happening  in, beheld it in its fulfillment. A slow flush burned its way upward in  the Bonnie Lassie's face as she studied it.    
"He's done it!" she exclaimed. "Flower and flame! Why did I ever take to  sculpture? One can't get that in the metal."    
"He's done it," I echoed.    
"Of course, technically, it's rather a sloppy picture."    
"It's a glorious picture!" I cried.    
"Naturally that," returned the exasperating critic. "It always will  be--when you paint with your heart's blood."    
"Do you think your friend Bobbie appreciates the medium in which she's  presented?"    
"If she doesn't--which she probably does," said the Bonnie Lassie, "she  will find out something to her advantage when she sees me to-morrow. I'm  going home to 'phone her."    
In answer to the summons, Bobbie came. She looked, I thought, as I saw  her from my bench, troubled and perplexed and softened, and glowingly  lovely. At the door of the Bonnie Lassie's house she was met with the  challenge direct.    
"What have you been doing to my artistic ward?"    
"Nothing," replied Bobbie with unwonted meekness, and to prove it  related the incidents of the touring-car, the supper at the Taverne  Splendide, and the encounter with the paternal colorist.    
"That isn't Julien's father," said the sculptress. "He's only an  adoptive father. But Julien adores him, as he ought to. The real father,  so I've heard, was a French gentleman--"    
"I don't care who his father was!" cried Bobbie. (The Bonnie Lassie's  face took on the expression of an exclamation point.) "I can't bear to  think of his having to do servant's work. And I told him so yesterday."    
"Did you look like that while you were telling him?"    
"Like what? I suppose so."    
"And what did he do?"    
"Do? He didn't do anything."    
"Then," pronounced the Bonnie Lassie, "he's a stick of  wood--hardwood--with a knot-hole for a heart."    
"He isn't! Well, perhaps he is. He was very horrid at the last."    
"About what?"    
"About taking money."    
"I'm a prophetess! And you're a patroness. Born in us, I suppose. You  <i>did</i> try to give him money."    
"Just to loan it. Enough so that he could go away to study and paint. He  wouldn't even let me do that; so I--I--I offered to buy the picture of  me, and he said--he said--Cecily, do you think he's sometimes a little  queer in his head?"    
"Not in the head, necessarily. <i>What</i> did he say?"    
"He said he'd bought it himself at the highest price ever paid. And he  said it so obstinately that I saw it was no use, so I just told him that  I hoped I'd see him when I came back--"    
"Back from where? Are you going away?"    
"Yes; didn't I tell you? On a three months' cruise."    
"Had you told him that?"    
"Of course. That's when I tried to get him to take the money. Cecily--"  The girl's voice shook a little. "You'll tell him, won't you, that he  <i>must</i> keep on painting?"    
"Why? Doesn't he intend to?"    
"He said he'd painted himself out and he didn't think he'd ever <i>look</i>  at color again."    
"He will," said the Bonnie Lassie wisely and comfortably. "Grief is just  as driving a taskmaster as lo--as other emotions."    
"Grief!" The girl's color ebbed. "Cecily! You don't think I've hurt  him?"    
The Bonnie Lassie caught her in a sudden hug.    
"Bobbie, do you know what I'd do in your place?"    
"No. What?"    
"I'd go right--straight--back to Julien Tenney's studio." She paused  impressively.    
"Yes?" said the other faintly.    
"And I'd walk right--straight--up to Julien Tenney--" Another pause,  even more impressive.    
"I d-d-don't think I'd--he'd--"    
"And I'd say to him: 'Julien, will you marry me?' Like that."    
"Oh!" said Bobbie in outraged amazement.    
"And maybe--" continued the Bonnie Lassie judicially: "maybe I'd kiss  him. Yes. I think I would."    
Suddenly all the bright softness of Bobbie's large eyes dissolved in  tears. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," she sobbed.    
"You won't be ashamed of <i>yourself</i>," prophesied the other, "if you do  just as I say, quickly and naturally."    
"Oh, naturally," retorted the girl in an indignant whimper. "I suppose  you think that's natural. Anyway, he probably doesn't care about me at  all that way."    
"Roberta," said the sculptress sternly, "did you <i>see</i> his portrait of  you?"    
"Y-y-yes."    
"And you have the presumption to say that he doesn't care? Why, that  picture doesn't simply tell his secret. It <i>yells</i> it!"    
"I don't care," said the hard-pressed Bobbie. "It hasn't yelled it to  me. <i>Nobody's</i> yelled it to me. And I c-c-can't ask a m-m-man to--to--"    
"Perhaps you can't," allowed her adviser magnanimously. "On second  thought, it won't be necessary. You just go back--after powdering your  nose a little--and say that you've come to see the picture once more, or  that it's a fine day, or that competition is the life of trade, or  that--oh, anything! And, if he doesn't do the rest, I'll kill and  eat him."    
"But, Cecily--"    
"You <i>would</i> be a patroness of Art. Now I've given you something real to  patronize. Don't you dare fail me." Suddenly the speaker gave herself  over to an access of mirth. "Heaven help that young man when he comes  to own up."    
"Own up to what?"    
"Never mind."    
Having consumed a vain and repetitious half-hour in variations upon her  query, Bobbie gave it up and decided to find out for herself. It was  curiosity and curiosity alone (so she assured herself) that impelled her  to return for the last time (she assured herself of that, also) to  the attic.    
A voice raised in vehement protest, echoing through the open door of the  studio, checked her on the landing below as she mounted.    
"And you're actually going to let thirty-five thousand a year slip  through your fingers, just to pursue a fad?"    
To which Julien's equable accents replied:    
"That's it, Merrill. I'm going to paint."    
The unseen Merrill left a blessing (of a sort) behind, slammed the door  upon it, and materialized to the vision of the girl on the landing as an  energetic and spruce-looking man of forty-odd, with a harassed  expression. At need, Miss Holland could summon considerable decisiveness  to her aid.    
"Would you think me inexcusably rude," she said softly, "if I asked who  you are?"    
The descending man snatched off his hat, stared, seemed on the point of  whistling, then, recovering himself, said courteously: "I'm George  Merrill, advertising manager for the Criterion Clothing Company."    
"And Mr. Tenney has been doing drawings for you?"    
"He has. For several years."    
"So that," said the girl, half to herself, "is his pot-boiling."    
"Not a very complimentary term," commented Mr. Merrill, "for the best  black-and-white work being done in New York to-day. Between my concern  and two others he makes a railroad president's income out of it."    
"Yes, I overheard what you said to him. Thank you so much."    
"In return, may I ask you something?"    
"Certainly."    
"Will you not, for his own good, dissuade Mr. Tenney from throwing away  his career?"    
"Why should you suppose me to have any influence with Mr. Tenney?"    
Mr. Merrill's face was grave, as befitted the issue, but a twinkle  appeared at the corner of his glasses. "I've seen the portrait," he  replied, and with a bow, went on his way.    
Julien opened the door to her knock. She stepped inside, facing him with  bright, inscrutable eyes.    
"Why have you been fooling me about your circumstances?" she demanded.    
"D---n Merrill!" said Julien with fervor.    
"It's true that your 'pot-boiling' brings you a big income?"    
"Yes."    
"Then why do you take employment as a chauffeur?"    
"I don't. That car belongs to me."    
"And your being a waiter? I don't suppose the Taverne Splendide belongs  to you?"    
"An impromptu bit of acting," confessed the abashed Julien.    
"And this attic? Was that hired for the same comedy?"    
"No. This is mine, really."    
"I don't understand. Why have you done it all?"    
"If you want to know the truth," he said defiantly, "so that I could  keep on seeing you."    
"That's a very poor excuse," she retorted.    
"The best in the world. As a successful commercial artist, what possible  interest would you have taken in me? You took me for a struggling young  painter--that was the Bonnie Lassie's fault, for I never lied to you  about it--and after we'd started on that track I didn't--well, I didn't  have the courage to risk losing you by quitting the masquerade."    
"How you must have laughed at me all the time!"    
He flushed to his angry eyes. "Do you think that is fair?" he retorted.  "Or kind? Or true?"    
"I--I don't know," she faltered. "You let me offer you money. And you've  probably got as much as I have."    
"I won't have from now on, then. I'm going to paint. I thought, when you  told me you were going away, that I couldn't look at a canvas again. But  now I know I was wrong. I've got to paint. You'll have left me that,  at least."    
"Mr. Merrill thinks you're ruining your career. And if you do, it'll be  my fault. I'll never, never, never," said the patroness of Art  desolately, "try to do any one good again!"    
She turned toward the door.    
"At least," said Julien in a voice which threatened to get out of  control, "you'll know that it wasn't all masquerade. You'll know why  I'll always keep the picture, even if I never paint another."    
She stole a look at him over her shoulder and, with a thrill, saw the  passion in his eyes and the pride that withheld him from speaking.    
"Suppose," she said, "I asked you to give it up."    
"You wouldn't," he retorted quickly.    
"No, I wouldn't. But--but--" Her glance, wandering away from him, fell  on the joyous line of Beranger bold above the door.    
"'How good is life in an attic at twenty,'" she murmured. Then, turning  to him, she held out her hands.    
"I could find it good," she said with a soft little falter in her voice,  "even at twenty-two."    
Everything passes in review before my bench, sooner or later. The two,  going by with transfigured faces, stopped.    
"Let's tell Dominie," said Julien.    
I waved a jaunty hand. "I know already," said I, "even if it hadn't been  announced to a waiting world."    
"Wh-wh-why," stammered Bobbie with a blush worth a man's waiting a  lifetime to see, "it--it only just happened."    
"Bless your dear, innocent hearts, both of you! It's been happening for  weeks. Come with me."    
I lead them to the sidewalk fronting Thornsen's Elite Restaurant. There  stood Peter Quick Banta, admiring his latest masterpiece of imaginative  symbolism. It represented a love-bird of eagle size holding in its  powerful beak a scroll with a wreath of forget-me-nots on one end and of  orange-blossoms on the other, encircling respectively the initials.  "J.T." and "R.H." Below, in no less than four colors, ran the legend,  "Cupid's Token."    
"O Lord! Dad!" cried the horrified Julien, scuffing it out with frantic  feet. "How long has this been there?"    
"What're you doing? Leave it be!" cried the anguished artist. "It's been  there since noon."    
"Never mind," put in Bobbie softly; "it's very pretty and tasteful even  though it is a little precipitate. But how"--she turned the lovely and  puzzled inquiry of her eyes upon the symbolist--"how did you know?"    
"Artistic intuition," said Peter Quick Banta with profound complacency.  "<i>I'm</i> an artist."
