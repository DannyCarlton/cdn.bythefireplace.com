On the August evening as Rosalind sat on the porch before her father's  house in Willow Springs, Walter Sayers came home from the factory by  the river and to his wife's suburban garden. When the family had dined  he came out to walk in the paths with the two children, boys, but they  soon tired of his silence and went to join their mother. The young  negro came along a path by the kitchen door and joined the party.  Walter went to sit on a garden seat that was concealed behind bushes.  He lighted a cigarette but did not smoke. The smoke curled quietly up  through his fingers as it burned itself out.    
Closing his eyes Walter sat perfectly still and tried not to think. The  soft evening shadows began presently to close down and around him. For  a long time he sat thus motionless, like a carved figure placed on the  garden bench. He rested. He lived and did not live. The intense body,  usually so active and alert, had become a passive thing. It was thrown  aside, on to the bench, under the bush, to sit there, waiting to be  reinhabited.    
This hanging suspended between consciousness and unconsciousness was a  thing that did not happen often. There was something to be settled  between himself and a woman and the woman had gone away. His whole plan  of life had been disturbed. Now he wanted to rest. The details of his  life were forgotten. As for the woman he did not think of her, did not  want to think of her. It was ridiculous that he needed her so much. He  wondered if he had ever felt that way about Cora, his wife. Perhaps he  had. Now she was near him, but a few yards away. It was almost dark but  she with the negro remained at work, digging in the ground--somewhere  near--caressing the soil, making things grow.    
When his mind was undisturbed by thoughts and lay like a lake in the  hills on a quiet summer evening little thoughts did come. "I want you  as a lover--far away. Keep yourself far away." The words trailed  through his mind as the smoke from the cigarette trailed slowly upwards  through his fingers. Did the words refer to Rosalind Wescott? She had  been gone from him three days. Did he hope she would never come back or  did the words refer to his wife?    
His wife's voice spoke sharply. One of the children in playing about,  had stepped on a plant. "If you are not careful I shall have to make  you stay out of the garden altogether." She raised her voice and  called, "Marian!" A maid came from the house and took the children  away. They went along the path toward the house protesting. Then they  ran back to kiss their mother. There was a struggle and then  acceptance. The kiss was acceptance of their fate--to obey. "O,  Walter," the mother's voice called, but the man on the bench did not  answer. Tree toads began to cry. "The kiss is acceptance. Any physical  contact with another is acceptance," he reflected.    
The little voices within Walter Sayers were talking away at a great  rate. Suddenly he wanted to sing. He had been told that his voice was  small, not of much account, that he would never be a singer. It was  quite true no doubt but here, in the garden on the quiet summer night,  was a place and a time for a small voice. It would be like the voice  within himself that whispered sometimes when he was quiet, relaxed. One  evening when he had been with the woman, Rosalind, when he had taken  her into the country in his car, he had suddenly felt as he did now.  They sat together in the car that he had run into a field. For a long  time they had remained silent. Some cattle came and stood nearby, their  figures soft in the night. Suddenly he had felt like a new man in a new  world and had begun to sing. He sang one song over and over, then sat  in silence for a time and after that drove out of the field and through  a gate into the road. He took the woman back to her place in the city.    
In the quiet of the garden on the summer evening he opened his lips to  sing the same song. He would sing with the tree toad hidden away in the  fork of a tree somewhere. He would lift his voice up from the earth, up  into the branches, of trees, away from the ground in which people were  digging, his wife and the young negro.    
The song did not come. His wife began speaking and the sound of her  voice took away the desire to sing. Why had she not, like the other  woman, remained silent?    
He began playing a game. Sometimes, when he was alone the thing  happened to him that had now happened. His body became like a tree or a  plant. Life ran through it unobstructed. He had dreamed of being a  singer but at such a moment he wanted also to be a dancer. That would  have been sweetest of all things--to sway like the tops of young trees  when a wind blew, to give himself as grey weeds in a sunburned field  gave themself to the influence of passing shadows, changing color  constantly, becoming every moment something new, to live in life and in  death too, always to live, to be unafraid of life, to let it flow  through his body, to let the blood flow through his body, not to  struggle, to offer no resistance, to dance.    
Walter Sayers' children had gone into the house with the nurse girl  Marian. It had become too dark for his wife to dig in the garden. It  was August and the fruitful time of the year for farms and gardens had  come, but his wife had forgotten fruitfulness. She was making plans for  another year. She came along the garden path followed by the negro. "We  will set out strawberry plants there," she was saying. The soft voice  of the young negro murmured his assent. It was evident the young man  lived in her conception of the garden. His mind sought out her desire  and gave itself.    
The children Walter Sayers had brought into life through the body of  his wife Cora had gone into the house and to bed. They bound him to  life, to his wife, to the garden where he sat, to the office by the  riverside in the city.    
They were not his children. Suddenly he knew that quite clearly. His  own children were quite different things. "Men have children just as  women do. The children come out of their bodies. They play about," he  thought. It seemed to him that children, born of his fancy, were at  that very moment playing about the bench where he sat. Living things  that dwelt within him and that had at the same time the power to depart  out of him were now running along paths, swinging from the branches of  trees, dancing in the soft light.    
His mind sought out the figure of Rosalind Wescott. She had gone away,  to her own people in Iowa. There had been a note at the office saying  she might be gone for several days. Between himself and Rosalind the  conventional relationship of employer and employee had long since been  swept quite away. It needed something in a man he did not possess to  maintain that relationship with either men or women.    
At the moment he wanted to forget Rosalind. In her there was a struggle  going on. The two people had wanted to be lovers and he had fought  against that. They had talked about it. "Well," he said, "it will not  work out. We will bring unnecessary unhappiness upon ourselves."    
He had been honest enough in fighting off the intensification of their  relationship. "If she were here now, in this garden with me, it  wouldn't matter. We could be lovers and then forget about being  lovers," he told himself.    
His wife came along the path and stopped nearby. She continued talking  in a low voice, making plans for another year of gardening. The negro  stood near her, his figure making a dark wavering mass against the  foliage of a low growing bush. His wife wore a white dress. He could  see her figure quite plainly. In the uncertain light it looked girlish  and young. She put her hand up and took hold of the body of a young  tree. The hand became detached from her body. The pressure of her  leaning body made the young tree sway a little. The white hand moved  slowly back and forth in space.    
Rosalind Wescott had gone home to tell her mother of her love. In her  note she had said nothing of that but Walter Sayers knew that was the  object of her visit to the Iowa town. It was on odd sort of thing to  try to do--to tell people of love, to try to explain it to others.    
The night was a thing apart from Walter Sayers, the male being sitting  in silence in the garden. Only the children of his fancy understood it.  The night was a living thing. It advanced upon him, enfolded him.  "Night is the sweet little brother of Death," he thought.    
His wife stood very near. Her voice was soft and low and the voice of  the negro when he answered her comments on the future of the garden was  soft and low. There was music in the negro's voice, perhaps a dance in  it. Walter remembered about him.    
The young negro had been in trouble before he came to the Sayers. He  had been an ambitious young black and had listened to the voices of  people, to the voices that filled the air of America, rang through the  houses of America. He had wanted to get on in life and had tried to  educate himself. The black had wanted to be a lawyer.    
How far away he had got from his own people, from the blacks of the  African forests! He had wanted to be a lawyer in a city in America.  What a notion!    
Well he had got into trouble. He had managed to get through college and  had opened a law office. Then one evening he went out to walk and  chance led him into a street where a woman, a white woman, had been  murdered an hour before. The body of the woman was found and then he  was found walking in the street. Mrs. Sayers' brother, a lawyer, had  saved him from being punished as a murderer and after the trial, and  the young negro's acquittal, had induced his sister to take him as  gardener. His chances as a professional man in the city were no good.  "He has had a terrible experience and has just escaped by a fluke" the  brother had said. Cora Sayers had taken the young man. She had bound  him to herself, to her garden.    
It was evident the two people were bound together. One cannot bind  another without being bound. His wife had no more to say to the negro  who went away along the path that led to the kitchen door. He had a  room in a little house at the foot of the garden. In the room he had  books and a piano. Sometimes in the evening he sang. He was going now  to his place. By educating himself he had cut himself off from his own  people.    
Cora Sayers went into the house and Walter sat alone. After a time the  young negro came silently down the path. He stopped by the tree where a  moment before the white woman had stood talking to him. He put his hand  on the trunk of the young tree where her hand had been and then went  softly away. His feet made no sound on the garden path.    
An hour passed. In his little house at the foot of the garden the negro  began to sing softly. He did that sometimes in the middle of the night.  What a life he had led too! He had come away from his black people,  from the warm brown girls with the golden colors playing through the  blue black of their skins and had worked his way through a Northern  college, had accepted the patronage of impertinent people who wanted to  uplift the black race, had listened to them, had bound himself to them,  had tried to follow the way of life they had suggested.    
Now he was in the little house at the foot of the Sayers' garden.  Walter remembered little things his wife had told him about the man.  The experience in the court room had frightened him horribly and he did  not want to go off the Sayers' place. Education, books had done  something to him. He could not go back to his own people. In Chicago,  for the most part, the blacks lived crowded into a few streets on the  South Side. "I want to be a slave," he had said to Cora Sayers. "You  may pay me money if it makes you feel better but I shall have no use  for it. I want to be your slave. I would be happy if I knew I would  never have to go off your place."    
The black sang a low voiced song. It ran like a little wind on the  surface of a pond. It had no words. He had remembered the song from his  father who had got it from his father. In the South, in Alabama and  Mississippi the blacks sang it when they rolled cotton bales onto the  steamers in the rivers. They had got it from other rollers of cotton  bales long since dead. Long before there were any cotton bales to roll  black men in boats on rivers in Africa had sung it. Young blacks in  boats floated down rivers and came to a town they intended to attack at  dawn. There was bravado in singing the song then. It was addressed to  the women in the town to be attacked and contained both a caress and a  threat. "In the morning your husbands and brothers and sweethearts we  shall kill. Then we shall come into your town to you. We shall hold you  close. We shall make you forget. With our hot love and our strength we  shall make you forget." That was the old significance of the song.    
Walter Sayers remembered many things. On other nights when the negro  sang and when he lay in his room upstairs in the house, his wife came  to him. There were two beds in their room. She sat upright in her bed.  "Do you hear, Walter?" she asked. She came to sit on his bed, sometimes  she crept into his arms. In the African villages long ago when the song  floated up from the river men arose and prepared for battle. The song  was a defiance, a taunt. That was all gone now. The young negro's house  was at the foot of the garden and Walter with his wife lay upstairs in  the larger house situated on high ground. It was a sad song, filled  with race sadness. There was something in the ground that wanted to  grow, buried deep in the ground. Cora Sayers understood that. It  touched something instinctive in her. Her hand went out and touched,  caressed her husband's face, his body. The song made her want to hold  him tight, possess him.    
The night was advancing and it grew a little cold in the garden. The  negro stopped singing. Walter Sayers arose and went along the path  toward the house but did not enter. Instead he went through a gate into  the road and along the suburban streets until he got into the open  country. There was no moon but the stars shone brightly. For a time he  hurried along looking back as though afraid of being followed, but when  he got out into a broad flat meadow he went more slowly. For an hour he  walked and then stopped and sat on a tuft of dry grass. For some reason  he knew he could not return to his house in the suburb that night. In  the morning he would go to the office and wait there until Rosalind  came. Then? He did not know what he would do then. "I shall have to  make up some story. In the morning I shall have to telephone Cora and  make up some silly story," he thought. It was an absurd thing that he,  a grown man, could not spend a night abroad, in the fields without the  necessity of explanations. The thought irritated him and he arose and  walked again. Under the stars in the soft night and on the wide flat  plains the irritation soon went away and he began to sing softly, but  the song he sang was not the one he had repeated over and over on that  other night when he sat with Rosalind in the car and the cattle came.  It was the song the negro sang, the river song of the young black  warriors that slavery had softened and colored with sadness. On the  lips of Walter Sayers the song had lost much of its sadness. He walked  almost gaily along and in the song that flowed from his lips there was  a taunt, a kind of challenge.
