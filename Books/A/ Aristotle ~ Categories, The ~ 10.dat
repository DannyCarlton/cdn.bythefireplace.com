The proposed categories have, then, been adequately dealt with.  We must next explain the various senses in which the term  'opposite' is used. Things are said to be opposed in four senses:  (i) as correlatives to one another, (ii) as contraries to one  another, (iii) as privatives to positives, (iv) as affirmatives  to negatives.    
Let me sketch my meaning in outline. An instance of the use of  the word 'opposite' with reference to correlatives is afforded by  the expressions 'double' and 'half'; with reference to contraries  by 'bad' and 'good'. Opposites in the sense of 'privatives' and  'positives' are' blindness' and 'sight'; in the sense of  affirmatives and negatives, the propositions 'he sits', 'he does  not sit'.    
(i) Pairs of opposites which fall under the category of relation  are explained by a reference of the one to the other, the  reference being indicated by the preposition 'of' or by some  other preposition. Thus, double is a relative term, for that  which is double is explained as the double of something.  Knowledge, again, is the opposite of the thing known, in the same  sense; and the thing known also is explained by its relation to  its opposite, knowledge. For the thing known is explained as that  which is known by something, that is, by knowledge. Such things,  then, as are opposite the one to the other in the sense of being  correlatives are explained by a reference of the one to the  other.    
(ii) Pairs of opposites which are contraries are not in any way  interdependent, but are contrary the one to the other. The good  is not spoken of as the good of the bad, but as the contrary of  the bad, nor is white spoken of as the white of the black, but as  the contrary of the black. These two types of opposition are  therefore distinct. Those contraries which are such that the  subjects in which they are naturally present, or of which they  are predicated, must necessarily contain either the one or the  other of them, have no intermediate, but those in the case of  which no such necessity obtains, always have an intermediate.  Thus disease and health are naturally present in the body of an  animal, and it is necessary that either the one or the other  should be present in the body of an animal. Odd and even, again,  are predicated of number, and it is necessary that the one or the  other should be present in numbers. Now there is no intermediate  between the terms of either of these two pairs. On the other  hand, in those contraries with regard to which no such necessity  obtains, we find an intermediate. Blackness and whiteness are  naturally present in the body, but it is not necessary that  either the one or the other should be present in the body,  inasmuch as it is not true to say that everybody must be white or  black. Badness and goodness, again, are predicated of man, and of  many other things, but it is not necessary that either the one  quality or the other should be present in that of which they are  predicated: it is not true to say that everything that may be  good or bad must be either good or bad. These pairs of contraries  have intermediates: the intermediates between white and black are  grey, sallow, and all the other colours that come between; the  intermediate between good and bad is that which is neither the  one nor the other.    
Some intermediate qualities have names, such as grey and sallow  and all the other colours that come between white and black; in  other cases, however, it is not easy to name the intermediate,  but we must define it as that which is not either extreme, as in  the case of that which is neither good nor bad, neither just nor  unjust.    
(iii) 'privatives' and 'Positives' have reference to the same  subject. Thus, sight and blindness have reference to the eye. It  is a universal rule that each of a pair of opposites of this type  has reference to that to which the particular 'positive' is  natural. We say that that is capable of some particular faculty  or possession has suffered privation when the faculty or  possession in question is in no way present in that in which, and  at the time at which, it should naturally be present. We do not  call that toothless which has not teeth, or that blind which has  not sight, but rather that which has not teeth or sight at the  time when by nature it should. For there are some creatures which  from birth are without sight, or without teeth, but these are not  called toothless or blind.    
To be without some faculty or to possess it is not the same as  the corresponding 'privative' or 'positive'. 'Sight' is a  'positive', 'blindness' a 'privative', but 'to possess sight' is  not equivalent to 'sight', 'to be blind' is not equivalent to  'blindness'. Blindness is a 'privative', to be blind is to be in  a state of privation, but is not a 'privative'. Moreover, if  'blindness' were equivalent to 'being blind', both would be  predicated of the same subject; but though a man is said to be  blind, he is by no means said to be blindness.    
To be in a state of 'possession' is, it appears, the opposite of  being in a state of 'privation', just as 'positives' and  'privatives' themselves are opposite. There is the same type of  antithesis in both cases; for just as blindness is opposed to  sight, so is being blind opposed to having sight.    
That which is affirmed or denied is not itself affirmation or  denial. By 'affirmation' we mean an affirmative proposition, by  'denial' a negative. Now, those facts which form the matter of  the affirmation or denial are not propositions; yet these two are  said to be opposed in the same sense as the affirmation and  denial, for in this case also the type of antithesis is the same.  For as the affirmation is opposed to the denial, as in the two  propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit', so also the fact which  constitutes the matter of the proposition in one case is opposed  to that in the other, his sitting, that is to say, to his not  sitting.    
It is evident that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed  each to each in the same sense as relatives. The one is not  explained by reference to the other; sight is not sight of  blindness, nor is any other preposition used to indicate the  relation. Similarly blindness is not said to be blindness of  sight, but rather, privation of sight. Relatives, moreover,  reciprocate; if blindness, therefore, were a relative, there  would be a reciprocity of relation between it and that with which  it was correlative. But this is not the case. Sight is not called  the sight of blindness.    
That those terms which fall under the heads of 'positives' and  'privatives' are not opposed each to each as contraries, either,  is plain from the following facts: Of a pair of contraries such  that they have no intermediate, one or the other must needs be  present in the subject in which they naturally subsist, or of  which they are predicated; for it is those, as we proved,' in the  case of which this necessity obtains, that have no intermediate.  Moreover, we cited health and disease, odd and even, as  instances. But those contraries which have an intermediate are  not subject to any such necessity. It is not necessary that every  substance, receptive of such qualities, should be either black or  white, cold or hot, for something intermediate between these  contraries may very well be present in the subject. We proved,  moreover, that those contraries have an intermediate in the case  of which the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the  two contraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it  is a constitutive property of fire to be hot, of snow to be  white, it is necessary determinately that one of the two  contraries, not one or the other, should be present in the  subject; for fire cannot be cold, or snow black. Thus, it is not  the case here that one of the two must needs be present in every  subject receptive of these qualities, but only in that subject of  which the one forms a constitutive property. Moreover, in such  cases it is one member of the pair determinately, and not either  the one or the other, which must be present.    
In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', on the other hand,  neither of the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is not  necessary that a subject receptive of the qualities should always  have either the one or the other; that which has not yet advanced  to the state when sight is natural is not said either to be blind  or to see. Thus 'positives' and 'privatives' do not belong to  that class of contraries which consists of those which have no  intermediate. On the other hand, they do not belong either to  that class which consists of contraries which have an  intermediate. For under certain conditions it is necessary that  either the one or the other should form part of the constitution  of every appropriate subject. For when a thing has reached the  stage when it is by nature capable of sight, it will be said  either to see or to be blind, and that in an indeterminate sense,  signifying that the capacity may be either present or absent; for  it is not necessary either that it should see or that it should  be blind, but that it should be either in the one state or in the  other. Yet in the case of those contraries which have an  intermediate we found that it was never necessary that either the  one or the other should be present in every appropriate subject,  but only that in certain subjects one of the pair should be  present, and that in a determinate sense. It is, therefore, plain  that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to each in  either of the senses in which contraries are opposed.    
Again, in the case of contraries, it is possible that there  should be changes from either into the other, while the subject  retains its identity, unless indeed one of the contraries is a  constitutive property of that subject, as heat is of fire. For it  is possible that that that which is healthy should become  diseased, that which is white, black, that which is cold, hot,  that which is good, bad, that which is bad, good. The bad man, if  he is being brought into a better way of life and thought, may  make some advance, however slight, and if he should once improve,  even ever so little, it is plain that he might change completely,  or at any rate make very great progress; for a man becomes more  and more easily moved to virtue, however small the improvement  was at first. It is, therefore, natural to suppose that he will  make yet greater progress than he has made in the past; and as  this process goes on, it will change him completely and establish  him in the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by lack of  time. In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however,  change in both directions is impossible. There may be a change  from possession to privation, but not from privation to  possession. The man who has become blind does not regain his  sight; the man who has become bald does not regain his hair; the  man who has lost his teeth does not grow a new set. (iv)  Statements opposed as affirmation and negation belong manifestly  to a class which is distinct, for in this case, and in this case  only, it is necessary for the one opposite to be true and the  other false.    
Neither in the case of contraries, nor in the case of  correlatives, nor in the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', is  it necessary for one to be true and the other false. Health and  disease are contraries: neither of them is true or false.  'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each other as correlatives:  neither of them is true or false. The case is the same, of  course, with regard to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as  'sight' and 'blindness'. In short, where there is no sort of  combination of words, truth and falsity have no place, and all  the opposites we have mentioned so far consist of simple words.    
At the same time, when the words which enter into opposed  statements are contraries, these, more than any other set of  opposites, would seem to claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is  ill' is the contrary of 'Socrates is well', but not even of such  composite expressions is it true to say that one of the pair must  always be true and the other false. For if Socrates exists, one  will be true and the other false, but if he does not exist, both  will be false; for neither 'Socrates is ill' nor 'Socrates is  well' is true, if Socrates does not exist at all.    
In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', if the subject does  not exist at all, neither proposition is true, but even if the  subject exists, it is not always the fact that one is true and  the other false. For 'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of  'Socrates is blind' in the sense of the word 'opposite' which  applies to possession and privation. Now if Socrates exists, it  is not necessary that one should be true and the other false, for  when he is not yet able to acquire the power of vision, both are  false, as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent.    
But in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject  exists or not, one is always false and the other true. For  manifestly, if Socrates exists, one of the two propositions  'Socrates is ill', 'Socrates is not ill', is true, and the other  false. This is likewise the case if he does not exist; for if he  does not exist, to say that he is ill is false, to say that he is  not ill is true. Thus it is in the case of those opposites only,  which are opposite in the sense in which the term is used with  reference to affirmation and negation, that the rule holds good,  that one of the pair must be true and the other false.
