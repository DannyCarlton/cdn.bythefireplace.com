Down at Tilgate, meanwhile, Elma Clifford had met more than once  with Cyril Waring at friends' houses around, for ever since the  accident, Society had made up its mind that Elma ought to marry her  companion in the tunnel; and, when Society once makes up its mind  on a question of this sort, why, it does its level best in the long  run to insure the fulfilment of its own prediction.    
Wherever Elma had met her painter, however, during those few short  weeks, she had seen him only before the quizzing eyes of all the  world; and though she admitted to herself that she liked him very  much, she was nevertheless so thoroughly frightened by her own  performance after the Holkers' party that she almost avoided him,  in spite of officious friends--partly, it is true, from a pure  feeling of maidenly shame, but partly also from a deeper-seated  and profoundly moral belief that with this fierce mad taint upon  her as she naturally thought, it would be nothing short of wrong  in her even to marry. She couldn't meet Cyril now without thinking  at once of that irresistible impulse which had seized her by the  throat, as it were, and bent her to its wild will in her own room  after their interview at the Holkers'; and the thought did far  more than bring a deep blush into her rich brown cheek--it made her  feel most acutely she must never dream of burdening him with that  terrible uncertainty and all it might enclose in it of sinister  import.    
For Elma felt sure she was mad that night. And, if so, oh, how could  she poison Cyril Waring's life with so unspeakable an inheritance  for himself and his children?    
She didn't know, what any psychologist might at once have told  her, that no one with the fatal taint of madness in her blood could  ever even have thought of that righteous self-denial. Such scruples  have no place in the selfish insane temperament; they belong only  to the highest and purest types of moral nature.    
One morning, however, a few weeks later, Elma had strolled off  by herself into Chetwood Forest, without any intention of going  anywhere in particular, save for a solitary walk, when suddenly,  a turn round the corner of a devious path brought her face to face  all at once with a piece of white canvas, stretched opposite her  on an easel; at the other side of which, to her profound dismay,  an artist in a grey tweed suit was busily working.    
The artist, as it happened, didn't see her at once, for the canvas  stretched between them, shutting her out from his eyes, and Elma's  light footstep on the mossy ground hadn't aroused his attention.  So the girl's first impulse was to retrace her way unobtrusively  without exchanging a word, and retire round the corner again, before  Cyril could recognise her. But somehow, when she came to try, she  couldn't. Her feet refused point blank to obey her will. And this  time, in her own heart, she knew very well why. For there in the  background, coiled up against the dense wall of rock and fern,  Sardanapalus lay knotted in sleepy folds, with his great ringed  back shining blue in the sunlight that struggled in round patches  through the shimmering foliage. More consciously now than even in  the train, the beautiful deadly creature seemed to fascinate Elma  and bind her to the spot. For a moment she hesitated, unable to  resist the strange, inexplicable attraction that ran in her blood.  That brief interval settled it. Even as she paused, Cyril glanced  round at the snake to note the passing effect of a gleam of light  that fell slantwise through the leaves to dapple his spotty back--and  caught sight of Elma. The poor girl gave a start. It was too late  now to retreat. She stood there rooted.    
Cyril moved forward to meet her with a frankly outstretched hand.  "Good morning, Miss Clifford," he said, in his cheery manly voice.  "So you've dropped down by accident upon my lair here, have you?  Well, I'm glad you've happened to pass by to-day, for this, do you  know, is my very last morning. I'm putting the finishing touches upon  my picture now before I take it back to town. I go away to-morrow,  perhaps to North Wales, perhaps to Scotland."    
Elma trembled a little at those words, in spite of resolution;  for though she could never, never, never marry him, it was nice,  of course, to feel he was near at hand, and to have the chance of  seeing him, and avoiding him as far as possible, on other people's  lawns at garden parties. She trembled and turned pale. She could  never <i>marry</i> him, to be sure; but then she could never marry any  one else either; and that being so, she liked to <i>see</i> him now and  again, on neutral ground, as it were, and to know he was somewhere  that she could meet him occasionally. Wales and Scotland are  so distant from Surrey. Elma showed in her face at once that she  thought them both unpleasantly remote from Craighton, Tilgate.    
With timid and shrinking steps, she came in front of the picture,  and gazed at it in detail long and attentively. Never before did  she know how fond she was of art.    
"It's beautiful," she said, after a pause; "I like it immensely.  That moss is so soft, and the ferns are so delicate. And how lovely  that patch of rich golden light is on Sardanapalus's shoulder."    
The painter stepped back a pace or two and examined his own handicraft,  with his head on one side, in a very critical attitude. "I don't  know that I'm quite satisfied after all with the colour-scheme,"  he said, glancing askance at Elma. "I fancy it's, perhaps, just a  trifle too green. It looks all right, of course, out here in the  open; but the question is, when it's hung in the Academy, surrounded  by warm reds, and purples, and blues, won't it look by comparison  much too cabbagey and too grassy?"    
Elma drew a deep breath.    
"Oh, Mr. Waring," she cried, in a deprecating tone, holding her  breath for awe.    
It pained her that anybody--even Cyril himself--should speak so  lightly about so beautiful a picture.    
"Then you like it?" Cyril asked, turning round to her full face  and fronting her as she stood there, all beautiful blushes through  her creamy white skin.    
"Like it? I love it," Elma answered enthusiastically. "Apart from  its being yours, I think it simply beautiful."    
"And you like <i>me</i>, too, then?" the painter asked, once more, making  a sudden dash at the question that was nearest to both their hearts,  after all, that moment. He was going away to-morrow, and this was  a last opportunity. Who could tell how soon somebody might come up  through the woods and interrupt their interview? He must make the  best use of his time. He must make haste to ask her.    
Elma let her eyes drop, and her heart beat hard. She laid her hand  upon the easel to steady herself as she answered slowly, "You know  I like you, Mr. Waring; I like you very, very much indeed. You  were so kind to me in the tunnel. And I felt your kindness. You  could see that day I was--very, very grateful to you."    
"When I asked you if you liked my picture, Elma," the young man said  reproachfully, taking her other hand in his, and looking straight  into her eyes, "you said, 'Like it? I love it.' But when I ask you  if you like me--ask you if you will take me--you only say you're  very, very grateful."    
Elma let him take her hand, all trembling, in his. She let him  call her by her name. She let him lean forward and gaze at her,  lover-like. Her heart throbbed high. She couldn't refuse him.  She knew she loved him. But to marry him--oh no. That was quite  another thing. There duty interposed. It would be cruel, unworthy,  disgraceful, wicked.    
She drew herself back a little with maidenly dignity, as she answered  low, "Mr. Waring, we two saw into one another's hearts so deep in  the tunnel that day we spent together, that it would be foolish for  us now to make false barriers between us. I'll tell you the plain  truth." She trembled like an aspen-leaf. "I love you, I think; but  I can never marry you."    
She said it so simply, yet with such an earnestness of despair,  that Cyril knew with a pang she really meant it.    
"Why not?" he cried eagerly, raising her hand to his lips, and  kissing it with fervour. "If you tell me you love me, Elma, all the  rest must come. Say that, and you say all. So long as I've gained  your heart, I don't care for anything."    
Elma drew her hand away with stately reserve. "I mean it, Mr.  Waring," she said slowly, sitting down on the bank, and gasping a  little for air, just as she had done in the tunnel. "I really mean  it. I <i>liked</i> you in the train that day; I was <i>grateful</i> to you in the  accident; I knew I <i>loved</i> you the afternoon we met at the Holkers'.  There, I've told you that plainly--more plainly than I thought I ever  could tell it to any man on earth--because we knew one another so  well when we thought we were dying side by side, and because--because  I can see you really love me.... Well, it can never be. I can never  marry you."    
She gazed at him wistfully. Cyril sat down by her side, and talked  it all over with her from a hundred points of view. He pressed his  suit hard, till Elma felt, if words could win, her painter would have  won her. But she couldn't yield, she said for <i>his</i> sake a thousand  times more than for her own, she must never marry. As the man grew  more earnest the girl in turn grew more frank and confiding. She  could never marry <i>him</i>, to be sure, she said fervently, but then  she could never, never, never marry any one else. If she married  at all she would marry Cyril. He took her hand again. Without one  shadow of resistance she let him take it and hold it. Yes, yes, he  might love her, if he liked, no harm at all in that; and <i>she</i>, she  would always, always love him. All her life through, she cried,  letting her passionate southern nature get the better of her at  last, she would love him every hour of every day in the year, and  love him only. But she could never marry him. Why, she must never  say. It was no use his trying to read her secret. He must never  find it out; never, never, never. But she, for her part, could  never forget it.    
So Cyril, eagerly pressing his suit with every art he knew, was  forced in the end to content himself with that scanty measure. She  would love him, she would write to him, even; but she would never  marry him.    
At last the time came when they must really part, or she would be  late for lunch, and mamma would know all; mamma would read everything.  He looked her wistfully in the face. Elma held out her lips, obedient  to that mute demand, with remorseful blush of maidenly shame on  her cheek. "Only once," she murmured. "Just to seal our compact.  For the first and last time. You go away to-morrow."    
"That was <i>before</i> you said you loved me," Cyril cried with delight,  emboldened by success. "Mayn't I stay on now, just one little week  longer?"    
At the proposal, Elma drew back her face in haste before he had  time to kiss it, and answered, in a very serious voice--    
"Oh no, don't ask me. After this, I daren't stand the strain of  seeing you again--at least not just now--not so very, very soon.  Please, please, don't ask me. Go to-morrow, as you said. If you  don't, I can't let you," she blushed, and held out her blushing  face once more. "Only if you promise me to go to-morrow, mind,"  she said, with a half-coquettish, half-tearful smile at him.    
Cyril hesitated for a second. He was inclined to temporize. "Those  are very hard terms," he said. Then impulse proved too much for him.  He bent forward, and pressed his lips just once on that olive-brown  cheek. "But I may come back again very soon," he murmured, pushing  home his advantage.    
Elma seized his hand in hers, wrung it hard and tremulously, and  then turned and ran like a frightened fawn, without pausing to look  back, down the path homeward. Yet she whispered one broken sentence  through her tears, for all that, before she went.    
"I shall love you always; but spare me, spare me."    
And Cyril was left behind by himself in the wood, completely  mystified.
