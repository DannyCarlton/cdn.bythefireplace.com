  Every one liked &quot;Miss Virginia,&quot; the beautiful wife of Dick Brown,  and  most every one&#8212;as a matter of course&#8212;liked those whom it was  evident  she liked. Among those fortunate individuals was James  Falkner, and to  a greater degree than even he realized she had been  the guiding force  in the shaping of his life. 
  Still she exerted her influence upon the young man's career from a   distance. To him she was almost of another world than that in which he   lived&#8212;as, in fact, she actually was, some one worthy of worship, but   not ever to be a comrade. There could be little in common between the   rich cultured lady who graced the palatial home of Richard Brown,   Esq., Barrister at Law, Solicitor in Chancery and Proctor in   Admiralty, General Counsel for the great corporation whose myriad   ships ploughed the Inland Seas from early spring until winter storms   drove them to their harbours, and the orphan boy, obviously of the   lake breed, sole survivor of the Bannockburn and lately master of the   pirate-craft Lady Gwendolyn, even though he walked erect&#8212;his   shoulders squared and his eyes piercing and fearless&#8212;knew more facts   concerning more subjects, spoke more correctly, and was more active   and energetic than any of his fellows. 
  The truth is that Jim Falkner adored his lovely sponsor, to whom  even  the passing years had been kind, but was strangely and  unaccountably  shy in her presence; and she was as ignorant of what was  passing in  the young man's mind as she had been the Lady Gwendolyn was  captured  and its master returned to school and the ways of civilized,  law-  abiding folks. 
  Dick was as much interested in the shaping of Jim Falkner's career  as  his wife. With the passing of the years, his memories of the  eventful  cruise of the amateur pirates faded and the obliterating  mantle of  Time obscured the unpleasant incidents of that trip. So, by  the time  the boy had graduated from High School, Richard Brown had  become his  sincere champion&#8212;yet one who fully realized that the only  career  worth while for a young man is the career which he carves out  for  himself, following his own inclinations, with but a modicum of  advice  and control from the elders who have his welfare at heart. 
  Due to the influence of Dick Brown, Jim Falkner was permitted to  carve  out his own fortune during the summer which followed his  completion of  his High School course; but Miss Virginia quite failed  to understand  the value to him of his experiences on the Pauline  Spreckles, the  Ventura, and on that thrice-cursed schooner where the  Law of the Lakes  missed its victim by reason of the fact that a  courageous and true-  hearted woman cared less for her reputation than  for the safety of her  husband. Because Dick's wife did not and could  not so understand, Jim  Falkner spent the next four years of his We at  the University where  Dick and Virginia had once been classmates. Few  people&#8212;least of all  Richard Brown&#8212;found it in their hearts to oppose  Miss Virginia long,  once her determination had become known. 
  Jin Falkner was but an indifferent student on the great campus,  though  it must be admitted that he did sincerely try. Each summer the  lure of  the Inland Seas had its way with him, however, adding to the  young  man's rich store of worth-while experiences; and eventually,  with much  of solemn ceremony, James Falkner, A.B.&#8212;who would rather  have been  Jim Falkner, able-bodied seaman&#8212;joined the reportorial  staff of the  best daily in the best city on the Great Lakes. At least,  the young  man chose so to regard the ten-dollar-a-week job which  Dick's  influence had enabled him to obtain. 
  The managing editor was studying a map when Falkner came in the  third  afternoon. He looked up, nodded, and asked sharply: &quot;Have you  seen  this Jim?&quot; 
  The young man picked up the afternoon edition of a rather  sensational  rival and noted the big headlines running across the first  three  columns. The preceding night an American fishing-tug had been  fired  upon by a Canadian revenue cutter, and the story had been  &quot;played-up&quot;  in graphic detail. 
  &quot;What do you think of it?&quot; asked the editor, who had been told of  his  new cub's interest in the lakes and their people. 
  Jim Falkner shrugged his shoulders. He had already learned that  this  was a golden way of expressing himself until he had fathomed the   managing editor's mind. &quot;Interesting,&quot; he said. &quot;Mighty interesting!&quot; 
  &quot;I'll wager a hat that it will end in something more than a little   excitement, Falkner!&quot; exclaimed the managing editor. &quot;Our lake   correspondents say that the fishermen along the Erie shore are   desperate. They're not catching fish on our side, and a great many of   the tug captains have turned pirates and are running their nets over   the international boundary. Our Dunkirk man says the town is hot with   threats against the Canadians; while in Erie they're ready to fight,   and I've got a tip that a number of captains are fitted out with  guns&#8212;  and there's a strong sentiment that if they're fired upon  they'll use  'em. The Canadian revenue cutters are confiscating nets by  the  wholesale; they've captured three tugs, which have been taken as   prizes into Canadian ports; and two boats have been fired upon when   they refused to haul to. That's the situation in a nutshell, Jim. If   the Dunkirk and Erie men don't back down there's going to be a fish-   pirate war; anyway, there's stacks of fun brewing, and I want you to   hustle over there and take the thing in hand. Everything is up to you.   Get the best special stuff you can. Our regular correspondents will   attend to the routine. Here&#8212;wait a minute&#8212;I'll give you an order for   transportation and funds.&quot; 
  Jim Falkner was instantly on his feet, ready to go. &quot;I can make the   three-twenty train,&quot; he said, glancing at his watch. &quot;That will get me   into Erie to-night.&quot; 
  It was already three o'clock, and the managing editor nodded in   appreciation of the young man's readiness. &quot;Then we won't waste time   in getting transportation. Here's an order on the cashier. If you want   more money wire for it. Get in with the pirates, if you can, and take   a trip with one of them. That's what we want. Good luck to you!&quot; 
  Fifteen minutes later Jim Falkner was aboard his train. He had   purchased a magazine at the depot news-stand, but did not read.   Lounging back comfortably in his seat, he closed his eyes and began   formulating a plan of action. At the outset he realized that he would   have difficulty in successfully filling his assignment. This was not   the first time that the dark clouds of a fishermen's war had gathered   over Erie. And it was not the first time that a newspaper man had gone   down among the pirates. 
  He remembered that MacIlvie had almost succeeded. MacIlvie's story  was  a bit of cherished history in the Herald office. He had smuggled   himself aboard a Dunkirk fish-pirate's boat, and had reached the   poaching grounds before he was discovered. After that he was marooned   upon a sand-bar which was not much larger than the tug which put him   there. He had almost starved. Falkner chuckled as he recalled the   Scotchman's adventure. Then there was Briggs, the best marine man that   ever struck the Herald beat. Briggs came back with one arm in a sling,   and so badly used-up that he was unrecognizable for a month. 
  Falkner himself had been among the pirates two years before, in a   desultory, friendly sort of way, while writing up the fish industry   during a summer vacation. He knew them for men of strong courage,   toughened by storm and inured to wreck and hardship, and with a   thousand fancied wrongs to right&#8212;men who talked with fox-like caution   in the companionship of strangers, and who thought it no sin to seek   their livelihood across a line they could neither feel nor see, and   would not understand. 
  The young reporter admired their courage. He liked the men. He  wanted  to join them, and be friends, and write them up as heroes  instead of  outlaws. He knew that this would please the managing  editor. Everybody  liked the fish pirates, except the Canadians.  MacIlvie and Briggs had  liked them&#8212;a mental picture of MacIlvie upon  his sand-bar, and Briggs  in his hospital cot, flashed upon Falkner,  and the humour of it  tickled him. 
  &quot;If that's the reward of friendship in Erie, what the deuce will  they  do with me?&quot; he thought. 
  Unconsciously he spoke the words quite audibly. The next instant he   was looking into a pair of dark, tear-filled eyes turned upon him from   the seat ahead. He saw a troubled face and a mouth trembling as if   upon the point of speech. Then the face was turned away. 
  Falkner straightened himself. He had noticed the girl when he came  in,  and had looked at her hair because it had struck him as being   exquisitely pretty. After that he had not thought of her again. But   now he watched her closely, hoping that she would give him an   opportunity to speak to her. But the opportunity did not come, and   gradually his thoughts slipped back into their old channel. 
  By the time his train reached Toledo he had devised a scheme by  which  he hoped to make good among the pirates. He would get employment  in  one of the fish-houses, make the acquaintance of poachers, and  watch  for a chance to join one of their crews. It would take time, but  he  believed the managing editor would stand for it. 
  As the train pulled into the Toledo yards the girl of him rose from   her seat, and Falkner was enabled to get another view of her face.   Something in it&#8212;a look of tense anxiety, almost fear&#8212;urged him to   speak. &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said. &quot;I change here&#8212;may I help you   with your grip?&quot; 
  A bit of colour mounted into the girl's pale cheeks. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I&#8212;hardly know,&quot; she faltered. The young man saw unutterable   wretchedness in her eyes. &quot;You are-going to Erie?&quot; she asked. &quot;I   overheard you&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I'm going to Erie,&quot; Jim Falkner interrupted. He wanted the  girl  to understand that he knew she was in trouble, and there was  gentle  friendliness in his voice. &quot;Won't you please tell me how I can  help  you?&quot; 
  &quot;You can carry my grip.&quot; 
  She looked up into his face, and there came a little tremble round  her  mouth, and her eyes were soft in the lamp-glow, as though she  wanted  to cry. It was a pretty face, and the young man felt his heart   pounding with sympathy. 
  &quot;I want to do more than that!&quot; he said. Suddenly he reached out and   caught one of her hands. &quot;See here, little girl, something's troubling   you! Won't you tell me what it is?&quot; 
  The girl was crying in earnest now. The passengers had filed out of   the car, but Falkner continued to hold the hand he had taken. 
  &quot;Tell me!&quot; he pleaded. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I&#8212;want you to take me to a pawn-shop,&quot; sobbed the girl from   behind her handkerchief. 
  &quot;A pawn-shop!&quot; cried Falkner. &quot;What the devil&#8212;-Oh, I beg your   pardon.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, a pawn-shop!&quot; repeated the girl, with-drawing her hand and   meeting his eyes squarely. &quot;I want to go to a pawn-shop right away.   I've lost my purse, and I haven't a ticket to Erie, and I'm&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Hungry, I'll bet a dollar!&quot; cried the young man. &quot;We're bound this   instant for a place where they set up square meals, and do it in a   hurry. We've got just thirty-five minutes. Come on!&quot; 
  He caught up their grips and hurried down the aisle. There was not   much beauty about Jim Falkner, but there was something unusually   attractive in the boyish frankness of his face, and, as he looked back   over his shoulder, his strong white teeth shining at her, the girl   laughed. 
  &quot;I'm a beggar!&quot; she cried. 
  &quot;The prettiest I ever met!&quot; he flung back; and their eyes met   laughingly as he reached up to help her down the car steps. 
  &quot;A pawn-shop&#8212;you!&quot; He laughed aloud. 
  Relief from her anxiety and the excitement of her rescue had  flushed  the girl's cheeks with colour. Suddenly the young man halted  under a  depot light. 
  &quot;My name is Falkner,&quot; he announced, fishing a card from his pocket.   &quot;J. Augustus Falkner, of Detroit. It's a rummy name, but I've got to   keep it. I don't put on that 'J.' for style, but to make the thing   passable. Altogether it's James Augustus Falkner.&quot; 
  &quot;And mine is Burton,&quot; replied the girl, smiling up into his jolly   face. &quot;Josephine Burton, of Erie.&quot; 
  &quot;Jo-for short?&quot; said Falkner. 
  &quot;Ye-e-e-e-s, if you want to. You're a newspaper man?&quot; 
  &quot;Bound for Erie, to get up a few special stories about the fish   pirates,&quot; he answered. He led her into the depot cafe and gave their   orders. &quot;Do you know any fish pirates?&quot; he asked, after he had done   so. 
  He noticed that she was looking at him with unusual interest. 
  &quot;What are you going to say about them?&quot; she questioned. &quot;You're not   going to&#8212;say anything&#8212;bad?&quot; She spoke with intense seriousness, and   Falkner detected a note of alarm in her voice. 
  &quot;I want to make friends with them,&quot; he assured her. &quot;I want to turn   pirate myself. And I will&#8212;if they'll let me.&quot; Then he told her about   MacIlvie and Briggs. Afterward, when they were seated in their train   he described to her his plan for getting among the poachers. 
  &quot;And you think that will succeed?&quot; she asked, with a suggestive   curving of her lips. &quot;Well, it won't!&quot; 
  Falkner stared at her in astonishment. &quot;How do you know!&quot; he  retorted. 
  &quot;I'd be ashamed of them if it did,&quot; continued the girl, her eyes   shining with enthusiasm. &quot;Those men whom you call pirates are old   hands. They've known one another for years, and would no more think of   stringing a gang over the line with a new hand aboard&#8212;&quot; She caught   herself in confusion. 
  &quot;You're a pirate!&quot; whispered Falkner. His eyes burned with  admiration.  &quot;You're a pirate, Miss Jo-and so am I!&quot; 
  It was late when they reached Erie. A single cab was waiting at the   depot, and James Augustus Falkner, A.B., led Miss Burton to it. &quot;I am   coming to see you soon,&quot; he said. &quot;To-morrow, or the day after&#8212;may   I?&quot; 
  &quot;The day after,&quot; she invited. &quot;I shall sleep to-morrow.&quot; 
  The young man opened the cab door for her. After she had entered  she  stretched out a hand to him and said: &quot;I will get you acquainted  with  a pirate, Mr. Falkner. To-morrow afternoon call at 520 Water  Street  and ask for Captain Town. He will help you. Good night&#8212;and a  million  thanks!&quot; 
  It was midnight by the time Jim Falkner had registered for a room  at a  hotel. But for some time after that he did not go to bed. He  lighted  his pipe and went over the afternoon's adventure. Who was this  Captain  Town? For some reason which he did not attempt to analyse the  question  bothered him, and he imagined half a dozen things which might  account  for Miss Burton's apparent influence with him. He was quite  positive  that he must be a pirate, however; and a picturesque one at  that, if  his name stood for anything at all. Altogether, he counted  himself  immensely fortunate in having met the girl and in having been  thus  placed in line, as he was convinced, with a Lake Erie poacher. 
  The following morning, when the young man went down to breakfast,  he  stopped to chat for a few moments with the clerk, and asked him if  he  knew Captain Town. The clerk had never heard of him. 
  Until noon Falkner hung about the fish-houses. There he discovered   that Captain Town was master and owner of the only &quot;compounder&quot; in the   port. 
  What's a 'compounder'?&quot; asked the young reporter. 
  &quot;A compounder,&quot; said his informant, who was a dock lounger, &quot;is a  tug  wot you can only 'ear the riffles of&#8212;if y' listen 'ard!&quot; 
  At a little before two o'clock Jim Falkner walked slowly along  Water  Street. Before Number 520 he stopped in astonishment. It was a  big  stone front. 
  &quot;Great Scott!&quot; he gasped; but he walked up to it and rang the door-   bell. 
  &quot;Rooms here, I suppose,&quot; he mentally concluded. 
  A moment later the door was opened by a little white-haired old  lady,  who stared at him with ardent curiosity. &quot;Does Captain Town live   here?&quot; asked Falkner. 
  &quot;You bet he does, my boy!&quot; came a jovial voice from back in the  hall.  &quot;Step in, will you? I suppose you're the fellow Burton's girl  sent  over?&quot; 
  One of the oddest individuals he had ever seen confronted the young   man. He was unusually tall, and unusually thin, and his long lean face   shone like red tanned leather. But there was something immediately   likeable about him. His smile was friendly, and his grip so convincing   that his visitor's hand ached for some time after he had shaken it. 
  &quot;Been expecting you for some time, Falkner,&quot; he said familiarly.  &quot;Come  this way, will you?&quot; 
  He led him into a little room shut off from the hall, in which two  men  were busily engaged in smoking pipes. They were broad-built,  weather-  toughened men, wearing heavy seamen's jackets, and as Captain  Town  came in they shuffled to their feet and stood with their pipes in   their hands. Falkner had previously learned that this was a custom of   old lakemen when they wished to show unusual regard for a stranger. 
  &quot;This is the fellow Burton's girl sent over,&quot; announced the  captain.  &quot;Mr. Falkner, shake hands with the boys, will you? This is  Teddy&#8212;  Teddy Roosevelt, we call him, though his name is Jones; and  this is  Sandy&#8212;Sandy MacGunn. Both of 'em old-timers and rattling good  men, as  Burton's girl may have told you.&quot; 
  Falkner shook hands. 
  &quot;We're going out to-night,&quot; continued Captain Town, relighting his   pipe. &quot;We've got our gang stretched two miles over the line, and   there's a straight tip come that the Vigilant is going to drag there   to-morrow. If she does we lose our nets&#8212;unless we get 'em out before   morning. Burton's girl says you want to go, so&#8212;&quot; He puffed hard on   his pipe. &quot;So&#8212;I guess we'll have to take you!&quot; 
  For an hour Jim Falkner talked and smoked with the men. It did not   take him long to see that for some reason the two fishermen, MacGunn   and Jones, treated him with especial deference. Even the captain was   puzzlingly attentive. At the door, as he was leaving, the master of   the compounder gave him a letter. 
  &quot;Burton's girl asked me to give this to you,&quot; he explained. &quot;It's  the  money, I guess.&quot; 
  Suddenly he placed his two great hands upon the young man's  shoulders  and looked him squarely in the eyes. &quot;See here, mate,&quot; he  spoke in a  low voice, &quot;you did the square thing by Burton's girl. She  thinks  you're a brick. But if you lied to her&#8212;if you came down here  to&#8212;&quot; he  stopped. Jim Falkner thought of Briggs and the Scotchman, and   understood. 
  &quot;I swear that I won't betray her confidence,&quot; he replied. His voice   vibrated with truth. &quot;I'd turn back now if I thought there was a   chance of it!&quot; he finished. 
  &quot;You'd be willing to die first if you knew Burton's girl as well as  I  do!&quot; declared the captain. &quot;You would, s'elp me God, you would,   Falkner!&quot; He took his hands from his visitor's shoulders and opened   the door. &quot;I don't suppose Burton's girl told you anything about   herself?&quot; he asked. &quot;Not a word!&quot; cried the young man; and his eyes   shone with eager interest. 
  &quot;Well, mebby I'll tell you something to-night,&quot; laughed the fish   pirate. &quot;Remember, we leave at ten sharp. You're sure you can find   us?&quot; 
  &quot;Perfectly!&quot; said Jim Falkner. 
  He walked away as if in a dream. Twice he looked back at the  handsome  stone house, and more than once during the next half-hour he  asked  himself if it were possible that a fish pirate lived there; an  outlaw,  a man who staked a fortune and imperiled himself on the  strength of  his own cunning, and who was willing to accept the risks  of the  poorest fisherman for the chance of a successful haul from over  the  line. He had expected to meet pirates, but not of this kind. He  had  not associated stone fronts and pretty girls with his pictures of  the  poachers. He realized that, perhaps unwittingly, he was now  turning  traitor to his assignment. 
  He knew that he had already gathered material which would have  created  a sensation in the Herald office; but he had given his word  not to  divulge its secrets, and he had deliberately pledged himself  not to  use those details which his managing editor would demand. All  this&#8212;he  acknowledged it with a peculiar thrill of  satisfaction&#8212;because he had  become strangely interested in a girl! 
  Jim Falkner whistled as he thought, and walked without seeking any   particular direction. If he had made a fool of himself he was not in a   mood to confess it. He still might follow out his original scheme,   ingratiate himself into the confidence of some other pirate not   associated with the girl, and write his sensation in the manner he had   planned. He wondered how far Captain Town's friendship for the girl   went. Perhaps they were relatives. He tried to make himself believe   it. 
  Not until he had reached his hotel did he think to open the letter   which had been given to him by the fish pirate. He was elated to find   that it contained a note from Miss Burton, as well as the money which   he had expended for her ticket the previous evening. 
  &quot;Dear Mr. Falkner,&quot; he read. &quot;In this I am returning what you  kindly  lent me last night. I hope you liked Captain Town. Please do  not  forget your promise to come and see me to-morrow afternoon.  JOSEPHINE  BURTON.&quot; 
  It was not much, but it filled the young man with pleasure. Since  his  interview with Captain Town he had feared that perhaps Miss Burton  did  not care to continue their acquaintance, and that the captain  himself  might not regard further attentions on his Part in a friendly  light. 
  He read the note again, and, instead of destroying it afterward, as   was his custom with unimportant epistles, he placed it in his pocket.   Miss Burton had become a young woman of mystery to him. He realized   that she possessed unusual influence with the fish pirates,&#8212;or, at   least, with Captain Town,&#8212;and each hour added to the eagerness with   which he anticipated that night's adventure, in which he was confident   he would learn more about her. 
  An hour before the appointed time he was at the slip in which the   fish-pirate tug was secured. With the approach of evening a high wind   had sprung up out of the north-east&#8212;although the night was clear&#8212;and   from the disturbance in the bay he knew that heavy seas were running   outside. The compounder lay black and silent. Not a spark of light   could he discern aboard her, and he began to fear that the gale had   driven Captain Town and his men from their determination to leave   port. He was confident that they would at least send him word,   however, so he seated himself in the shelter of a fish-box and waited. 
  A few minutes before ten two men hurried down from the blackness of   the fish-houses and jumped aboard the tug. Falkner called to them, and   found that one was MacGunn. The other was the tug's engineer, whom he   had not met before. 
  &quot;Going out, MacGunn?&quot; he asked as he followed them aboard. 
  &quot;Sure! Didn't the cap'n say so&#8212;at ten?&quot; 
  MacGunn flung open the engine-room door and a rush of hot air  poured  into the young man's face. He lighted a couple of lanterns, and  saw  the puzzled look in his companion's face. &quot;Had steam up for half  an  hour,&quot; he grinned. Then he added, with a suggestive shrug and  another  grin: &quot;Hard coal!&quot; 
  He flung an oil-coat over one of the lanterns and carried it into  the  pilot-house, where Falkner and he sat down in silence. A few  minutes  later they were joined by Captain Town and Teddy. 
  When the captain spoke it was in a voice but little louder than a   whisper, and Falkner accepted the hint by maintaining silence while   the compounder was got under way. Only by the gentle throbbing of her   engine and the pitching of the boat in the seas could he tell when she   had left her mooring. 
  A quarter of an hour had passed when MacGunn uncovered the lantern.  He  handed it to the captain. &quot;We're off the point,&quot; he said. &quot;You   remember&#8212;&quot; 
  Captain Town pressed his face close up to one of the port windows.   After a moment he turned and motioned Falkner to him. &quot;That's Presque   Isle,&quot; he said. &quot;Can you make out a light?&quot; 
  The young man stared hard. A long distance away, it seemed to him,  he  could see what he thought to be the glow of a lamp in a window. 
  &quot;That's where Burton's girl lives,&quot; said the captain softly, &quot;I  told  her that if we took you to-night we'd show a light. She must see  us  soon. There&#8212;look!&quot; 
  Falkner's heart gave a sudden throb of pleasure. For an instant the   distant light vanished, then reappeared; and in a dozen flashes of   light, followed by intervals of gloom, came the signs of recognition   from the watching girl. There was almost a break in the young man's   voice when he spoke to Captain Town. &quot;She's&#8212;a trump!&quot; he breathed. 
  He looked again, but now the light remained steadily in the window.  He  watched it until the tops of the heaving seas shut it out from his   vision. Never in his life had he felt the blood pulsing through his   veins as it did now, and when he seated, himself, facing Sandy, and   the master of the compounder, he found the men eyeing him with keen   interest. 
  &quot;She is a trump!&quot; replied MacGunn. &quot;She's a&#8212;&quot; 
  A sweeping run of the sea caught the compounder with the booming  force  of a ten-ton sledge-hammer, and at this first signal that she  had come  into the open lake Teddy swung the tug's nose squarely out  from the  point, three-quarters in the teeth of the wind and on a line  for the  international boundary. Falkner shivered. 
  &quot;She's an angel!&quot; finished MacGunn, when the compounder had   straightened herself. 
  Jim Falkner passed around a box of cigars. The fish pirates seemed   indifferent to the roughness of the night, and the fact gave him   courage. But Captain Town had discovered his nervousness. 
  &quot;We've gone out in worse seas than this,&quot; he said, lighting his  cigar.  &quot;It was twice as bad that night Burton went out; wasn't it,  Teddy?&quot; he  asked, turning to the wheelman. &quot;It ain't customary to go  out nights&#8212;  unless you've got a couple o' thousand dollars' worth of  nets at  stake, as we've got right now. That's what took Burton out, in   November three years ago. He had a fifteen-hundred-dollar gang&#8212;which   is a string o' gill-nets&#8212;dropped three miles over the line in a heavy   herring-run, which ground was scheduled to be dragged the next day by   Canadian gunboat Petrel. It was that damned boat that settled for   Burton!&quot; he growled. 
  MacGunn had pulled a piece of paper from one of his pockets. 
  &quot;Look here!&quot; he cried, bringing a doubled fist forcefully upon his   knee. &quot;Look here what this feeds. I cut it from a fish paper. 'Cap'n   Chayter,' it says,' of the United States revenue cutter Morrell, on   Lake Erie, states that all the fish this year are on the Canadian   side.' And that's right! Nine out of ten of 'em are over there. Now,   look here, Mr. Falkner,&quot; he continued in a voice that shook the little   cabin, &quot;fish is fish, ain't they? And they ain't got no nationality,   'ave they? And everybody ought to be allowed to ketch 'em, 'adn't   they? But the law says not. The law says fish is CITIZENS! The fish   this side of that damned line out there it says is Americans. The fish   t'other side is Canadians. If an American pike 'appens to cross that   line he immediately turns Canuck&#8212;accordin' to law&#8212;and we can't ketch   'im, no matter if 'e was born 'n' bred right in Erie harbour! Think of   that! An Erie man can't go over there and bring back a runaway Erie   fish! That ain't a decent law-it's a damned outrage. And that's the   law which killed Burton.&quot; 
  &quot;You see, Burton went out in a bad night to save his nets and was   washed overboard,&quot; elucidated Captain Town. &quot;The lights of the cutter   hove in Slight, and it was in the hurry of trying to save a part of   the gang that he was lost. The tug got away&#8212;but that was all&#8212;and it   left Burton's girl and her mother in pretty bad shape.&quot; 
  The wheelman spoke. 
  &quot;Then she went to work as a&#8212;as a&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Shut up!&quot; commanded Captain Town. &quot;I won't have it said, Teddy&#8212;   darned if I will!&quot; 
  Jim Falkner reached over and gripped the fish pirate's hand. 
  &quot;I believe I understand,&quot; he said, his eyes glowing. &quot;She was a  brick,  old man!&quot; 
  &quot;But it wasn't long,&quot; interrupted the other. &quot;We rented Burton's  boat  to a Dunkirk man, and got her a position in one of the fish-house   offices. That was just before the strike.&quot; 
  &quot;Remember the big strike a couple of years ago?&quot; asked Teddy,  looking  over his shoulder. &quot;Lord&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Them as owned boats was all right,&quot; spoke MacGunn. &quot;But for them  that  didn't it was&#8212;hell! Half of us was reduced to soup bones,  sir&#8212;soup  bones, by thunder!&quot; 
  &quot;And atop of that came an epidemic of diphtheria,&quot; said the  captain.  &quot;It was a desperate rub for some of the poorer fellows. That  was when  Burton's girl showed her colours.&quot; 
  A deep breath came from Teddy. 
  &quot;I lost my little Nell then,&quot; he said hoarsely. &quot;I'd lost the  others&#8212;  three of them&#8212;and the wife, too, if it hadn't been for her.  She  nursed 'em through it, and fed 'em, God bless her&#8212;s'elp me, she  did;  she FED 'em!&quot; 
  &quot;There are others, Teddy,&quot; said MacGunn, a peculiar softness in his   rough voice. &quot;There was the Stimsons, the Rogerses, 'Pig' Walcott's   family, and a dozen others. We didn't know what she had done for 'em   until&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped, and for a time there was silence. 
  Falkner listened to the wash of the seas, and waited. Teddy, the   wheelman, was staring straight ahead into the gloom of the night.   MacGunn was enveloping himself in clouds of smoke. After a little   Captain Town finished what the other had begun. 
  &quot;We didn't know until we found she had sold Burton's boat,&quot; he  said.  &quot;The Dunkirk man had bought it at a half what it was worth, and  by the  time we discovered what she had done the girl had spent it all  on poor  devils of the fishing fleet. That's her, Falkner&#8212;that's  Burton's  girl!&quot; 
  &quot;We paid her back&#8212;afterward,&quot; came Terry's muffled voice. &quot;But she   wouldn't take a cent more than she had spent, not a cent.&quot; 
  &quot;And at Walcott's she took diphthery herself,&quot; rejoined MacGunn.  &quot;God,  how we prayed! And in the critical days some of us didn't work,  but  just hung around waitin' f'r her to live.&quot; 
  &quot;That was two years ago,&quot; said Falkner, after a silence. &quot;What does   she do now?&quot; 
  &quot;Nurses sick folks!&quot; jerked MacGunn. 
  Teddy drew the tug a step into the wind and glanced at Captain  Town.  The master of the compounder thrust his head and shoulders out  of the  pilot-house, and, after peering for a few minutes into the  darkness of  the sea ahead, went forward. 
  Jim Falkner followed. The wind had shifted into the north, and was   colder, but less violent. A mile over the starboard bow two or three   steady, star-like lights were slipping swiftly up the lake. 
  After a little MacGunn's voice came from behind. &quot;What is it,  Cap'n?&quot;  he cried. 
  &quot;It isn't her,&quot; shouted Town over his shoulder. 
  &quot;Lights are too high for the Vigilant. We'll cut a quarter of a  mile  astern. Better douse the glims.&quot; He made room for Falkner beside  him  in the bow. 
  &quot;The Canucks are in port to-night,&quot; he said to him. &quot;They're pretty   sure they wouldn't catch anything in a sea like this. I'd be tied up   myself if I didn't have a couple of thousand dollars' worth of nets   layin' out there!&quot; 
  Captain Town kept a ceaseless vigil to the north. Once or twice Jim   Falkner spoke to him, but received only monosyllabic replies. After a   while he rejoined Teddy and MacGunn in the pilot-house. 
  &quot;D'ye remember the Laughing Lass?&quot; greeted Teddy. The incident of  the  Laughing Lass had caused talk of war, and the young man nodded. 
  &quot;Well, right here is where the Petrel tried to shoot hell out of  her,  back in 1903. She was poaching on the other side and wouldn't  stop&#8212;&quot; 
  Captain Town interrupted him from the pilot-house door. 
  &quot;Tell the engineer to ease her down, Teddy,&quot; he called. &quot;We're   sighting the point buoy. Sandy, give us a lift with the drag.&quot; 
  Falkner followed the two aft. A few days before he knew that he  would  have taken a keen interest in what was about to happen, but now  his  enthusiasm was lamentably lacking. He saw the international buoy  come  and go in the gloom. He heard the creaking of the net-lifter,  watched  Captain Town as he slowly paid out the drag-line, and was  conscious of  the suspense which followed. 
  He knew that the compounder was now in forbidden waters&#8212;that they   were pirates, with certain prices upon their heads, and that at any   moment a gunboat might bear down upon them. But these things did not   thrill him as he had imagined they would. More than anything else they   produced in his mind the picture of another night, when the father of   the girl back at Presque Isle had gone to his death, perhaps very near   to where he stood at this moment. After a little he noticed that the   tug was moving at a snail-like speed. She seemed to be feeling her way   through the seas foot by foot. 
  Then came a shout from the captain, a triumphant cry from  MacGunn&#8212;and  the throbbing of the compounder's engine ceased. He knew  that the drag  had caught. For a few moments he watched the line as the  creaking  windlass drew it in. He saw the first of a mile of net slip  over the  stern, and then, unobserved by the fish pirates, went back  into the  still darkness of the pilot-house. 
  Half an hour later Captain Town came in to get his pipe. As he  lighted  a match he caught sight of the young man doubled up in one of  the  cushioned seats. &quot;Hello, mate!&#8212;Seasick?&quot; he cried. 
  &quot;A little uneasy,&quot; replied Falkner. As the fish pirate turned to  go,  Jim Falkner jumped to his feet and caught him by the arm.  &quot;Captain,  can you tell me on what date Burton was lost?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;On the day before the season closed&#8212;November fourteenth.&quot; 
  &quot;And to-morrow is the thirteenth,&quot; mused the young man as the other   left the pilot-house. &quot;Lord deliver us, Jerry, there's no time to   lose!&quot; He whistled softly and happily, in the way of a man who is far   from seasick. 
  In the early dawn the compounder came back into Erie. There were  two  tons of herring in her boxes. Her nets were wet and tangled. But   Captain Town did not remain to see the unloading of his catch or to   the reeling of his gang. With Jim Falkner he hurried ashore, the two   almost running in their haste. A few moments later, divested of his   oil-coat and sou'wester, Teddy disappeared upon a run behind the fish-   houses. 
  When they reached Water Street, Jim Falkner and the captain halted.   &quot;You are sure you've got time?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;I'll have twenty boats and a hundred men by noon!&quot; declared the  fish  pirate. &quot;We'll raise hell&#8212;if you can work your end of it,  Falkner!&quot; 
  The Herald man thrust out a hand. &quot;I'll never look Burton's girl in   the face again if I don't!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Remember&#8212;I promise upon my   word of honour!&quot; 
  He hurried townward. A block away he glanced over his shoulder and  saw  Captain Town going up Water Street at a trot. It was six o'clock  when  he reached the Western Union telegraph office. 
  &quot;I don't suppose the manager is in,&quot; he inquired of the clerk. 
  &quot;He won't be in until eight.&quot; 
  The young man reached for a pad and began writing. Five minutes  later  he handed the message through the window. 
  &quot;This is a matter of great importance,&quot; he explained to the clerk,   &quot;and I don't want to spare expense in getting it to the right party. I   want it sent to Port Stanley, Port Burwell and Port Rowan, Ontario. If   Captain Fitzgerald is not in any of these three places have a tug sent   out in search of him from each port, and I will stand the expense. He   must get that message before noon at all costs.&quot; 
  As the clerk read he gave a low whistle of astonishment. This was  the  message which Falkner had written: 
  &quot;CAPTAIN FITZGERALD, Commander Revenue Cutter Vigilant,&#8212;Ontario.  This  afternoon a powerful fleet of tugs will leave Erie for Port  Dover,  where it is their intention to recapture the three American  fishing-  boats recently caught in Canadian waters and now held in that  port. It  is probable that the boats will approach from the direction  of  Stromness. For assurance of responsibility of writer, wire managing   editor, the Herald, Detroit, or W.P. Samson, M.P., Windsor. J.A.   FALKNER.&quot; 
  Half an hour later the most sensational story of the year was being   received over the Herald wire. It described in minute detail the   daring plot of a hundred men to consummate one of the most thrilling   exploits in lake history. After a column of it had gone the young man   sat down and waited. Exhausted by forty-eight hours of sleepless   exertion, he soon fell into a slumber, from which he was aroused by   the clerk an hour and a half later. The Vigilant had been found by a   Port Rowan tug near Long Point, and the message had been delivered to   Captain Fitzgerald. 
  After breakfast at his hotel Falkner went to his room, but not to   sleep. He had made up his mind. to call upon Miss Burton as soon as   possible, although he knew that she did not expect him until   afternoon. He changed his clothes, shaved himself, and a little before   ten o'clock appeared on Presque Isle. A small boy directed him to the   Burton home. It was a comfortable-looking cottage, set well back in a   group of maples. A gravel path, with flower-beds on either side, led   to the big porch, and as he walked up this Falkner caught a   magnificent view of the lake beyond. As he approached he heard   whistling, unusually clear and musical. 
  &quot;A man, by jove!&quot; he thought. &quot;I hope not&#8212;-&quot; 
  Suddenly he caught the whisk of a skirt around the edge of the   cottage. He followed the path, and a moment later stopped dead still,   while a flush of pleasure and embarrassment gathered in his face.   Perched half-way up a ladder, a dozen feet away, was a young woman in   a man's coat, a man's hat, and with a big brown shining braid of hair   falling down her back. She was wielding a paint-brush upon the side of   the cottage, and whistling while she worked. 
  As she partly turned to dip her brush into a can suspended to the   ladder she saw her chance acquaintance of the other day. The whistle   died on her rounded mouth. For an instant she stared in astonished   confusion&#8212;and then she laughed, the merriest, sweetest laugh the   young man had ever heard. 
  &quot;There! I was afraid you'd go and do it!&quot; she cried. &quot;I told mama  that  just as surely as I came out to paint this morning you would show  up&#8212;  and you have! How do you do?&quot; She reached down a hand, laughing,  and  Falkner climbed up the ladder to reach it. 
  &quot;I wouldn't have missed this for anything,&quot; he said, looking up  into  her face. &quot;You&#8212;you're beautiful up there! Besides, I'm here just  in  time to help you. I can mix paint&#8212;-&quot; 
  &quot;I buy mine ready mixed,&quot; cried the girl. &quot;See, it comes in cans.&quot;  She  turned to show him, and in doing so dislodged the paint  receptacle,  which dashed its contents down the ladder, discolouring  the tip of one  of his shoes. She looked at him with mock dismay. 
  &quot;I'm glad of it,&quot; he said, descending. &quot;Now you must stop work!&quot; 
  &quot;I've got a dozen more cans in the kitchen,&quot; she flung down at him.   &quot;And another brush&#8212;and a ladder! If you will help me paint this side   I'll let you stay to dinner.&quot; 
  Jim's heart fairly jumped with joy. The girl came down and surveyed   her work with critical eyes. Her hat had fallen off, and Falkner stood   a few steps behind to look at her unobserved. 
  &quot;Isn't it fine?&quot; she asked, turning upon him. &quot;I'm painting it  copper-  brown&#8212;because&#8212;well&#8212;-&quot; Her eyes danced with fun. &quot;That's the   prevailing style in ladies' dress-goods this year, you know,&quot; she   added. &quot;I painted the fence to begin with. Mr. Tubbs, our neighbour,   gave me some home-made paint for that, and it was&#8212;it was like paste.   Please don't look at the fence!&quot; 
  Falkner turned and looked. 
  &quot;I'll do it all over for you, and paint your whole cottage, too&#8212;if   you'll have an early dinner,&quot; he replied, 
  &quot;Why an early dinner?&quot; The girl pouted her red lips. &quot;Are you  hungry,  or are you in a hurry to get away?&quot; 
  &quot;I came over this morning, Miss Jo, because I couldn't come this   afternoon,&quot; said the young man. &quot;I've got a very important engagement,   which begins at one o'clock, and&#8212;-&quot; 
  &quot;Then we won't paint,&quot; she interrupted. 
  &quot;But I'll come over and help you every day for a week after to-day,  if  you'll let me. I'll paint it copper-brown, or red, or&#8212;no, it must  be  copper-brown, for that's the colour of your hair&#8212;and your hair is   beautiful. Will you let me come, Miss Jo?&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Please!&quot; 
  &quot;I'll have to ask mama about that,&quot; said the girl, laughing softly  at  him with her eyes. &quot;I think&#8212;perhaps&#8212;-Well, let's go in and see  her.  Do you mind going through the kitchen?&quot; 
  &nbsp;When he rejoined Captain Town at one o'clock in the Water Street   stone front he spoke his feelings. &quot;I've been over to see Miss   Burton,&quot; he said. &quot;I never met a girl like her before.&quot; 
  &quot;And you never will,&quot; declared the fish pirate. &quot;Next to  Laura&#8212;that's  Mrs. Town&#8212;she's the finest girl that lives.&quot; 
  He led the way to the little room into which the young man was   admitted the day before. &quot;Well, I've got twenty-seven boats and a   hundred and sixteen men. The tugs you want have steam up and are ready   to leave at any time. You didn't let Burton's girl know?&quot; 
  &quot;Only told her part of the scheme,&quot; said Falkner. &quot;She fairly  begged  me to let her go with us&#8212;said she knew Mrs. Town would go if  you'd  let her.&quot; 
  &quot;Lord, Falkner, how Miss Jo will fight us when she discovers just  why  we're doing this!&quot; laughed the captain. &quot;If it wasn't for the  mother&#8212;&quot;  He shrugged his shoulders and blew a huge cloud of smoke  from his pipe. 
  &quot;Have you mapped out the course, Captain?&quot; 
  &quot;This is it.&quot; The master of the compounder thumbed a much-worn map   hanging on the wall. &quot;We strike due north to the international line;   follow that on the American side until we're opposite Dunkirk, then   cut a point midway between Stromness and Port Dover. The Canadian   boats can't help from sighting us somewhere along that course.&quot; 
  &quot;And we start?&quot; 
  &quot;It's sixty-five miles. We should leave within an hour.&quot; 
  &quot;That will give me just about time to run up-town and wire a few   paragraphs to my paper,&quot; said Falkner. &quot;I'll meet you at the boats.&quot; 
  He hurried to the telegraph office again and found a message  awaiting  him. It was from W.P. Samson, member of Parliament, Windsor,  and read: 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What the devil! Captain Fitzgerald, the Vigilant, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asks who you are, and if responsible. Told him <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes. Are you in trouble? SAMSON.&quot; 
  &quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried Jim Falkner. 
  The clerk turned a surprised face upon him from the window. &quot;Good   news?&quot; he asked. &quot;Money from father, perhaps?&quot; 
  &quot;Bully!&quot; he exclaimed. 
  He scribbled a note of thanks to Sarnson, M.P., and then hurried  half  a column additional matter off to the Herald. When he came down  to the  docks he saw Captain Town advancing to meet him. &quot;The Vigilant  is  taking the bait,&quot; he greeted, as the fish pirate came up. &quot;Read  this!&quot; 
  He gave him Samson's telegram, and when they reached the foot of  the  ship Captain Town read it aloud to the little group of men  assembled  there. Broad grins overspread their strong faces, and each  gave Jim  Falkner a hearty grip of the hands. 
  A quarter of an hour later six of the largest and fleetest tugs in   Erie trailed out of the harbour. As they passed Presque Isle Falkner   stood high up on the engine-house of the compounder and gazed toward   the Burton home. Soon he saw a figure run down to the edge of the   beach, and with a joyful shout he waved his hat above his head. Then   something rose in the air above the distant girl. For an instant it   fluttered, only partly visible; then a gust of wind caught it, and   every eye in the little fleet recognized the American flag. 
  From the pilot-house Captain Town shouted to his engineer, and a   screeching blast from the compounder answered the salute of Burton's   girl. In an instant it had been taken up by the other tugs, until a   mist of steam floated out and hid the distant shore from Falkner's   eyes. When he rejoined the fish-pirate captain in the pilot-house   there was tense whiteness in his face which he did not know was there. 
  It was a strange fleet that passed along the international boundary   that afternoon. According to Jim Falkner's plans, the six tugs   followed one after another, in battleship line, and the blackest smoke   that bituminous coal could be forced to make trailed over the sea   behind them. Late in the afternoon a slim low craft, which was made   out to be the auxiliary Canadian cruiser, was sighted in the offing.   For an hour she remained parallel with them, running eastward; when   darkness fell her lights showed that she was gathering great speed,   and was making in the direction of Port Dover. 
  Opposite Dunkirk the compounder swung her course to a point between   Stromness and Port Dover. At nine o'clock, with the sky faultlessly   clear above them, they were in the edge of Outer Long Point Bay. In   the distance the lights of Port Dover shone dimly. 
  Half an hour later the compounder, under low pressure, left the  line  and steamed silently in the direction of Stromness. Both vessels  edged  shoreward. It was nearly midnight when they returned to the  fleet. 
  The compounder reported that the auxiliary cruiser was lying with   steam up between Port Rowan and Normandale; the Vigilant had been   found two miles beyond Port Dover. Both cruisers were on the watch,   and ready to sweep down upon the little fleet the moment it entered   the harbour. 
  For two hours more the tugs lay silently in the Outer Bay. Then the   reconnaissance was made again. The cruisers had not changed their   positions. A little after three o'clock the compounder led a course   straight for Port Dover, and simultaneously with their movement the   auxiliary cruiser slipped down from Port Rowan. Mile after mile,   steaming slowly, the fleet of tugs approached the port in which the   captured American boats were held. At dawn they had come to within   half a mile of the town Then the compounder darted eastward. In their   battleship line they steamed boldly past the Vigilant gave a   simultaneous blast of their whistles, and with their crews shouting   themselves hoarse with joy struck a course for the town of Dunkirk. 
  Meanwhile, in the unguarded Canadian fishing-grounds, forty miles   away, twenty-one Erie fish-tugs were making the biggest catch of the   season. When they came into port they brought fifty-two tons of   Canadian herring, and that afternoon a check for six thousand dollars   was handed to Captain Town by the manager of one of the big fish   companies. 
  That evening a deputation of fish pirates, headed by Captain Town,   called upon Mrs. William Burton. Jim Falkner accompanied them until he   could see the lights of Josephine's home. Then he stopped. For a few   moments he and the fish-pirate captain stood alone, and their hands   met in a firm grip. &quot;Falkner,&quot; said the master of the compounder,   &quot;this was your scheme. I want to tell them so. I want to let Miss Jo   know that the biggest thing that ever happened in Erie came from an   idea of yours. I want&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;She would never forgive me, Captain,&quot; interrupted the young man.  &quot;I  don't believe she would ever let me see her again. She will regard  the  whole thing as a piece of charity, and she will fight it&#8212;hard!   Remember, it's for the mother. It's a six-thousand-dollar ransom taken   from the Canadians for Burton's death&#8212;and it comes from the fishermen   of Erie. Please leave me out!&quot; 
  Captain Town returned to the waiting men and Falkner watched them   until they disappeared into the cottage, but he stood in the deep   shadow of a tree and waited. An almost overmastering desire came upon   him to enter the cottage and ask the girl to share her life with him.   The sound of voices from a near-by shrub brought him out of his   reverie. Several minutes passed before he noticed two forms coming   toward him, and as they approached he recognized Burton's girl. 
  Her companion was a tall, good-looking athletic man in his early   thirties. They seemed very happy and obviously in love. When they   reached a few yards from where Falkner stood the man drew the girl   toward him and said in anxious tones, &quot;I love you, Jo. Won't you give   me your answer to-night? I imagine you have changed since you met this   Jim Falkner and I'm afraid. Do you care for him?&quot; 
  Though eavesdropping was not one of the young reporter's   accomplishments, there seemed to be no place to which he might go; and   after what he had already heard, disclosure of his presence in the   near-by shadows was unthinkable. 
  The girl hesitated a moment and then said, &quot;No, dear, I like  him&#8212;but  I do not love him. I'll marry you whenever you are ready!&quot; 
  They moved on slowly, but Jim Falkner remained where he had hidden   himself without realizing how rapidly the moments were slipping away.   An hour later the cottage door reopened and the men filed out As they   came out at the gate he joined them. 
  &quot;It was a hard rub, Falkner,&quot; said Captain Town &quot;but we made the   little widow take it!&quot; Then glancing at the young man's face, the   captain continued, &quot;Why, what&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I'm glad, Captain, very glad indeed. It will make it&#8212;easier for   her.&quot;
