When Dolly was seventeen, a pink wild rose just unrolling its  petals, a very great event occurred in her history. She received  an invitation to go and stop with some friends in the country.    
The poor child's life had been in a sense so uneventful that the  bare prospect of this visit filled her soul beforehand with  tremulous anticipation. To be sure, Dolly Barton had always lived  in the midmost centre of the Movement in London; she had known  authors, artists, socialists, the cream of our race; she had been  brought up in close intercourse with the men and women who are  engaged in revolutionizing and remodelling humanity. But this very  fact that she had always lived in the Thick of Things made a change  to the Thin of Things only by so much the more delicious and  enchanting. Not that Dolores had not seen a great deal, too, of  the country. Poor as they were, her mother had taken her to cheap  little seaside nooks for a week or two of each summer; she had made  pilgrimages almost every Sunday in spring or autumn to Leith Hill  or Mapledurham; she had even strained her scanty resources to the  utmost to afford Dolly an occasional outing in the Ardennes or in  Normandy. But what gave supreme importance to this coming visit  was the special fact that Dolly was now for the first time in her  life to find herself "in society."    
Among the friends she had picked up at her Marylebone day-school  were two west-country girls, private boarders of the  head-mistress's, who came from the neighborhood of Combe Neville in  Dorset. Their name was Compson, and their father was rector of their  native village, Upcombe. Dolly liked them very much, and was proud  of their acquaintance, because they were reckoned about the most  distinguished pupils in the school, their mother being the niece of  a local viscount. Among girls in middle-class London sets, even so  remote a connection with the title-bearing classes is counted for a  distinction. So when Winnie Compson asked Dolly to go and stop with  her at her father's rectory during three whole weeks of the summer  holidays, Dolly felt that now at last by pure force of native worth  she was rising to her natural position in society. It flattered her  that Winnie should select her for such an honor.    
The preparations for that visit cost Dolly some weeks of thought  and effort. The occasion demanded it. She was afraid she had no  frocks good enough for such a grand house as the Compsons.  "Grand" was indeed a favorite epithet of Dolly's; she applied it  impartially to everything which had to do, as she conceived, with  the life of the propertied and privileged classes. It was a word  at once of cherished and revered meaning--the shibboleth of  her religion. It implied to her mind something remote and  unapproachable, yet to be earnestly striven after with all the  forces at her disposal. Even Herminia herself stretched a point in  favor of an occasion which she could plainly see Dolly regarded as  so important; she managed to indulge her darling in a couple of  dainty new afternoon dresses, which touched for her soul the very  utmost verge of allowable luxury. The materials were oriental; the  cut was the dressmaker's--not home-built, as usual. Dolly looked  so brave in them, with her rich chestnut hair and her creamy  complexion,--a touch, Herminia thought, of her Italian birthplace,--  that the mother's full heart leapt up to look at her. It almost  made Herminia wish she was rich--and anti-social, like the rich  people--in order that she might be able to do ample justice to the  exquisite grace of Dolly's unfolding figure. Tall, lissome,  supple, clear of limb and light of footstep, she was indeed a girl  any mother might have been proud of.    
On the day she left London, Herminia thought to herself she had  never seen her child look so absolutely lovely. The unwonted union  of blue eyes with that olive-gray skin gave a tinge of wayward  shyness to her girlish beauty. The golden locks had ripened to  nut-brown, but still caught stray gleams of nestling sunlight.  'Twas with a foreboding regret that Herminia kissed Dolly on both  peach-bloom cheeks at parting. She almost fancied her child must  be slipping from her motherly grasp when she went off so blithely  to visit these unknown friends, away down in Dorsetshire. Yet  Dolly had so few amusements of the sort young girls require that  Herminia was overjoyed this opportunity should have come to her.  She reproached herself not a little in her sensitive heart for even  feeling sad at Dolly's joyous departure. Yet to Dolly it was a  delight to escape from the atmosphere of Herminia's lodgings.  Those calm heights chilled her.    
The Compsons' house was quite as "grand" in the reality as Dolly  had imagined it. There was a man-servant in a white tie to wait at  table, and the family dressed every evening for dinner. Yet, much  to her surprise, Dolly found from the first the grandeur did not in  the least incommode her. On the contrary, she enjoyed it. She  felt forthwith she was to the manner born. This was clearly the  life she was intended by nature to live, and might actually have  been living--she, the granddaughter of so grand a man as the late  Dean of Dunwich--had it not been for poor Mamma's ridiculous  fancies. Mamma was so faddy! Before Dolly had spent three whole  days at the rectory, she talked just as the Compsons did; she  picked up by pure instinct the territorial slang of the county  families. One would have thought, to hear her discourse, she had  dressed for dinner every night of her life, and passed her days in  the society of the beneficed clergy.    
But even that did not exhaust the charm of Upcombe for Dolly. For  the first time in her life, she saw something of men,--real men,  with horses and dogs and guns,--men who went out partridge shooting  in the season and rode to hounds across country, not the pale  abstractions of cultured humanity who attended the Fabian Society  meetings or wrote things called articles in the London papers. Her  mother's friends wore soft felt hats and limp woollen collars; these  real men were richly clad in tweed suits and fine linen. Dolly was  charmed with them all, but especially with one handsome and manly  young fellow named Walter Brydges, the stepson and ward of a  neighboring parson. "How you talked with him at tennis to-day!"  Winnie Compson said to her friend, as they sat on the edge of  Dolly's bed one evening. "He seemed quite taken with you."    
A pink spot of pleasure glowed on Dolly's round cheek to think that  a real young man, in good society, whom she met at so grand a house  as the Compsons', should seem to be quite taken with her.    
"Who is he, Winnie?" she asked, trying to look less self-conscious.  "He's extremely good-looking."    
"Oh, he's Mr. Hawkshaw's stepson, over at Combe Mary," Winnie  answered with a nod. "Mr. Hawkshaw's the vicar there till Mamma's  nephew is ready to take the living--what they call a warming-pan.  But Walter Brydges is Mrs. Hawkshaw's son by her first husband.  Old Mr. Brydges was the squire of Combe Mary, and Walter's his only  child. He's very well off. You might do worse, dear. He's  considered quite a catch down in this part of the country."    
"How old is he?" Dolly asked, innocently enough, standing up by the  bedside in her dainty white nightgown. But Winnie caught at her  meaning with the preternatural sharpness of the girl brought up in  immediate contact with the landed interest. "Oh, he's of age," she  answered quickly, with a knowing nod. "He's come into the  property; he has nobody on earth but himself to consult about his  domestic arrangements."    
Dolly was young; Dolly was pretty; Dolly's smile won the world;  Dolly was still at the sweetest and most susceptible of ages.  Walter Brydges was well off; Walter Brydges was handsome; Walter  Brydges had all the glamour of a landed estate, and an Oxford  education. He was a young Greek god in a Norfolk shooting-jacket.  Moreover, he was a really good and pleasant young fellow. What  wonder, therefore, if before a week was out, Dolly was very really  and seriously in love with him? And what wonder if Walter Brydges  in turn, caught by that maiden glance, was in love with Dolly? He  had every excuse, for she was lithe, and beautiful, and a joyous  companion; besides being, as the lady's maid justly remarked, a  perfect lady.    
One day, after Dolly had been a fortnight at Upcombe, the Compsons  gave a picnic in the wild Combe undercliff. 'Tis a broken wall of  chalk, tumbled picturesquely about in huge shattered masses, and  deliciously overgrown with ferns and blackthorn and golden clusters  of close-creeping rock-rose. Mazy paths thread tangled labyrinths of  fallen rock, or wind round tall clumps of holly-bush and bramble.  They lighted their fire under the lee of one such buttress of broken  cliff, whose summit was festooned with long sprays of clematis, or  "old man's beard," as the common west-country name expressively  phrases it. Thistledown hovered on the basking air. There they sat  and drank their tea, couched on beds of fern or propped firm against  the rock; and when tea was over, they wandered off, two and two,  ostensibly for nothing, but really for the true business of the  picnic--to afford the young men and maidens of the group some chance  of enjoying, unspied, one another's society.    
Dolly and Walter Brydges strolled off by themselves toward the  rocky shore. There Walter showed her where a brook bubbled clear  from the fountain-head; by its brink, blue veronicas grew, and tall  yellow loosestrife, and tasselled purple heads of great English  eupatory. Bending down to the stream he picked a little bunch of  forget-me-nots, and handed them to her. Dolly pretended  unconsciously to pull the dainty blossoms to pieces, as she sat on  the clay bank hard by and talked with him. "Is that how you treat  my poor flowers?" Walter asked, looking askance at her.    
Dolly glanced down, and drew back suddenly. "Oh, poor little  things!" she cried, with a quick droop of her long lashes. "I  wasn't thinking what I did." And she darted a shy glance at him.  "If I'd remembered they were forget-me-nots, I don't think I could  have done it."    
She looked so sweet and pure in her budding innocence, like a  half-blown water-lily, that the young man, already more than  two-thirds in love, was instantly captivated. "Because they were  forget-me-nots, or because they were <i>mine</i>, Miss Barton?" he asked  softly, all timorousness.    
"Perhaps a little of both," the girl answered, gazing down, and  blushing at each word a still deeper crimson.    
The blush showed sweet on that translucent skin. Walter turned to  her with a sudden impulse. "And what are you going to do with them  <i>now</i>?" he enquired, holding his breath for joy and half-suppressed  eagerness.    
Dolly hesitated a moment with genuine modesty. Then her liking for  the well-knit young man overcame her. With a frightened smile her  hand stole to her bodice; she fixed them in her bosom. "Will that  do?" she asked timidly.    
"Yes, that <i>will</i> do," the young man answered, bending forward and  seizing her soft fingers in his own. "That will do very well.  And, Miss Barton--Dolores--I take it as a sign you don't wholly  dislike me."    
"I like you very much," Dolly answered in a low voice, pulling a  rock-rose from a cleft and tearing it nervously to pieces.    
"Do you <i>love</i> me, Dolly?" the young man insisted.    
Dolly turned her glance to him tenderly, then withdrew it in haste.  "I think I <i>might</i>, in time," she answered very slowly.    
"Then you will be mine, mine, mine?" Walter cried in an ecstasy.    
Dolly bent her pretty head in reluctant assent, with a torrent of  inner joy. The sun flashed in her chestnut hair. The triumph of  that moment was to her inexpressible.    
But as for Walter Brydges, he seized the blushing face boldly in  his two brown hands, and imprinted upon it at once three respectful  kisses. Then he drew back, half-terrified at his own temerity.
