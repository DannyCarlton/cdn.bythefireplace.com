 Luke's return to Groveton was received with delight by his mother and his true friend Linton.  Naturally Randolph displayed the same feelings toward him as ever.  It so chanced that he met Luke only an hour after his arrival.  He would have passed him by unnoticed but for the curiosity he felt to know where he had been, and what he was intending to do.  
  "Humph! so you're back again!" he remarked.  
  "Yes," answered Luke, with a smile.  "I hope you haven't missed me much, Randolph."  
  "Oh, I've managed to live through it," returned Randolph, with what he thought to be cutting sarcasm.  
  "I am glad of that."  
  "Where were you?" asked Randolph, abruptly.  
  "I was in New York a part of the time," said Luke.  
  "Where were you the rest of the time?"  
  "I was traveling."  
  "That sounds large.  Perhaps you were traveling with a hand-organ."  
  "Perhaps I was."  
  "Well, what are you going to do now?"  
  "Thank you for your kind interest in me, Randolph.  I will tell you as soon as I know."  
  "Oh, you needn't think I feel interest in you."  
  "Then I won't."  
  "You are impertinent," said Randolph, scowling.  It dawned upon him that Luke was chaffing him.  
  "I don't mean to be.  If I have been, I apologize.  If you know of any situation which will pay me a fair sum, I wish you would mention me."  
  "I'll see about it," said Randolph, in an important tone.  He was pleased at Luke's change of tone.  "I don't think you can get back as janitor, for my father doesn't like you."  
  "Couldn't you intercede for me, Randolph?"  
  "Why, the fact is, you put on so many airs, for a poor boy, that I shouldn't feel justified in recommending you.  It is your own fault."  
  "Well, perhaps it is," said Luke.  
  "I am glad you acknowledge it.  I don't know but my father will give you a chance to work round our house, make fires, and run errands."  
  "What would he pay?" asked Luke, in a businesslike tone.  
  "He might pay a dollar and a half a week."  
  "I'm afraid I couldn't support myself on that."  
  "Oh, well, that's your lookout.  It's better than loafing round doing nothing."  
  "You're right there, Randolph."  
  "I'll just mention it to father, then."  
  "No, thank you.  I shouldn't wonder if Mr. Reed might find something for me to do."  
  "Oh, the man that robbed the bank?" said Randolph, turning up his nose.  
  "It may soon be discovered that some one else robbed the bank."  
  "I don't believe it."  
  Here the two boys parted.  
  "Luke," said Linton, the same day, "have you decided what you are going to do?"  
  "Not yet; but I have friends who, I think, will look out for me."  
  "Because my father says he will find you a place if you fail to get one elsewhere."  
  "Tell your father that I think he is very kind.  There is no one to whom I would more willingly be indebted for a favor.  If I should find myself unemployed, I will come to him."  
  "All right!  I am going to drive over to Coleraine"--the next town--"this afternoon.  Will you go with me?"  
  "I should like nothing better."  
  "What a difference there is between Randolph and Linton!" thought Luke.
