  Had the young hunters the power of looking into the future, their  camp-fire that night on the frozen Ombabika might have been one of  their last, and a few days later would have seen them back on the edges  of civilization. Possibly, could they have foreseen the happy  culmination of the adventures that lay before them, they would still  have gone on, for the love of excitement is strong in the heart of  robust youth. But this power of discernment was denied them, and only  in after years, with the loved ones of their own firesides close about  them, was the whole picture revealed. And in those days, when they  would gather with their families about the roaring logs of winter and  live over again their early youth, they knew that all the gold in the  world would not induce them to part with their memories of the life  that had gone before.
  A little less than thirty years previous to the time of which we  write, a young man named John Newsome left the great city of London for  the New World. Fate had played a hard game with young Newsome&#8212;had  first robbed him of both parents, and then in a single fitful turn of  her wheel deprived him of what little property he had inherited. A  little later he came to Montreal, and being a youth of good education  and considerable ambition, he easily secured a position and worked  himself into the confidence of his employers, obtaining an appointment  as factor at Wabinosh House, a Post deep in the wilderness of Lake  Nipigon.
  In the second year of his reign at Wabinosh&#8212;a factor is virtually  king in his domain&#8212;there came to the Post an Indian chief named  Wabigoon, and with him his daughter, Minnetaki, in honor of whose  beauty and virtue a town was named in after years. Minnetaki was just  budding into the early womanhood of her race, and possessed a beauty  seldom seen among Indian maidens. If there is such a thing as love at  first sight, it sprang into existence the moment John Newsome's eyes  fell upon this lovely princess. Thereafter his visits to Wabigoon's  village, thirty miles deeper in the wilderness, were of frequent  occurrence. From the beginning Minnetaki returned the young factor's  affections, but a most potent reason prevented their marriage. For a  long time Minnetaki had been ardently wooed by a powerful young chief  named Woonga, whom she cordially detested, but upon whose favor and  friendship depended the existence of her father's sway over his  hunting-grounds.
  With the advent of the young factor the bitterest rivalry sprang up  between the two suitors, which resulted in two attempts upon Newsome's  life, and an ultimatum sent by Woonga to Minnetaki's father. Minnetaki  herself replied to this ultimatum. It was a reply that stirred the  fires of hatred and revenge to fever heat in Woonga's breast. One dark  night, at the head of a score of his tribe, he fell upon Wabigoon's  camp, his object being the abduction of the princess. While the attack  was successful in a way, its main purpose failed. Wabigoon and a dozen  of his tribesmen were slain, but in the end Woonga was driven off.
  A swift messenger brought news of the attack and of the old chief's  death to Wabinosh House, and with a dozen men Newsome hastened to the  assistance of his betrothed and her people. A counter attack was made  upon Woonga and he was driven deep into the wilderness with great loss.  Three days later Minnetaki became Newsome's wife at the Hudson Bay  Post.
  From that hour dated one of the most sanguinary feuds in the history  of the great trading company; a feud which, as we shall see, was  destined to live even unto the second generation.
  Woonga and his tribe now became no better than outlaws, and preyed  so effectively upon the remnants of the dead Wabigoon's people that the  latter were almost exterminated. Those who were left moved to the  vicinity of the Post. Hunters from Wabinosh House were ambushed and  slain. Indians who came to the Post to trade were regarded as enemies,  and the passing of years seemed to make but little difference. The feud  still existed. The outlaws came to be spoken of as &#8220;Woongas,&#8221; and a  Woonga was regarded as a fair target for any man's rifle.
  Meanwhile two children came to bless the happy union of Newsome and  his lovely Indian wife. One of these, the eldest, was a boy, and in  honor of the old chief he was named Wabigoon, and called Wabi for  short. The other was a girl, three years younger, and Newsome insisted  that she be called Minnetaki. Curiously enough, the blood of Wabi ran  almost pure to his Indian forefathers, while Minnetaki, as she became  older, developed less of the wild beauty of her mother and more of the  softer loveliness of the white race, her wealth of soft, jet black hair  and her great dark eyes contrasting with the lighter skin of her  father's blood. Wabi, on the other hand, was an Indian in appearance  from his moccasins to the crown of his head, swarthy, sinewy, as agile  as a lynx, and with every instinct in him crying for the life of the  wild. Yet born in him was a Caucasian shrewdness and intelligence that  reached beyond the factor himself.
  One of Newsome's chief pleasures in life had been the educating of  his woodland bride, and it was the ambition of both that the little  Minnetaki and her brother be reared in the ways of white children.  Consequently both mother and father began their education at the Post;  they were sent to the factor's school and two winters were passed in  Port Arthur that they might have the advantage of thoroughly equipped  schools. The children proved themselves unusually bright pupils, and by  the time Wabi was sixteen and Minnetaki twelve one would not have known  from their manner of speech that Indian blood ran in their veins. Yet  both, by the common desire of their parents, were familiar with the  life of the Indian and could talk fluently the tongue of their mother's  people.
  It was at about this time in their lives that the Woongas became  especially daring in their depredations. These outlaws no longer  pretended to earn their livelihood by honest means, but preyed upon  trappers and other Indians without discrimination, robbing and killing  whenever safe opportunities offered themselves. The hatred for the  people of Wabinosh House became hereditary, and the Woonga children  grew up with it in their hearts. The real cause of the feud had been  forgotten by many, though not by Woonga himself. At last so daring did  he become that the provincial government placed a price upon his head  and upon those of a number of his most notorious followers. For a time  the outlaws were driven from the country, but the bloodthirsty chief  himself could not be captured.
  When Wabi was seventeen years of age it was decided that he should  be sent to some big school in the States for a year. Against this plan  the young Indian&#8212;nearly all people regarded him as an Indian, and Wabi  was proud of the fact&#8212;fought with all of the arguments at his command.  He loved the wilds with the passion of his mother's race. His nature  revolted at the thoughts of a great city with its crowded streets, its  noise, and bustle, and dirt. It was then that Minnetaki pleaded with  him, begged him to go for just one year, and to come back and tell her  of all he had seen and teach her what he had learned. Wabi loved his  beautiful little sister beyond anything else on earth, and it was she  more than his parents who finally induced him to go.
  For three months Wabi devoted himself faithfully to his studies in  Detroit. But each week added to his loneliness and his longings for  Minnetaki and his forests. The passing of each day became a painful  task to him. To Minnetaki he wrote three times each week, and three  times each week the little maiden at Wabinosh House wrote long,  cheering letters to her brother&#8212;though they came to Wabi only about  twice a month, because only so often did the mail-carrier go out from  the Post.
  It was at this time in his lonely school life that Wabigoon became  acquainted with Roderick Drew. Roderick, even as Wabi fancied himself  to be just at this time, was a child of misfortune. His father had died  before he could remember, and the property he had left had dwindled  slowly away during the passing of years. Rod was spending his last week  in school when he met Wabigoon. Necessity had become his grim master,  and the following week he was going to work. As the boy described the  situation to his Indian friend, his mother &#8220;had fought to the last  ditch to keep him in school, but now his time was up.&#8221; Wabi seized upon  the white youth as an oasis in a vast desert. After a little the two  became almost inseparable, and their friendship culminated in Wabi's  going to live in the Drew home. Mrs. Drew was a woman of education and  refinement, and her interest in Wabigoon was almost that of a mother.  In this environment the ragged edges were smoothed away from the Indian  boy's deportment, and his letters to Minnetaki were more and more  filled with enthusiastic descriptions of his new friends. After a  little Mrs. Drew received a grateful letter of thanks from the princess  mother at Wabinosh House, and thus a pleasant correspondence sprang up  between the two.
  There were now few lonely hours for the two boys. During the long  winter evenings, when Roderick was through with his day's work and Wabi  had completed his studies, they would sit before the fire and the  Indian youth would describe the glorious life of the vast northern  wilderness; and day by day, and week by week, there steadily developed  within Rod's breast a desire to see and live that life. A thousand  plans were made, a thousand adventures pictured, and the mother would  smile and laugh and plan with them.
  But in time the end of it all came, and Wabi went back to the  princess mother, to Minnetaki, and to his forests. There were tears in  the boys' eyes when they parted, and the mother cried for the Indian  boy who was returning to his people. Many of the days that followed  were painful to Roderick Drew. Eight months had bred a new nature in  him, and when Wabi left it was as if a part of his own life had gone  with him. Spring came and passed, and then summer. Every mail from  Wabinosh House brought letters for the Drews, and never did an Indian  courier drop a pack at the Post that did not carry a bundle of letters  for Wabigoon.
  Then in the early autumn, when September frosts were turning the  leaves of the North to red and gold, there came the long letter from  Wabi which brought joy, excitement and misgiving into the little home  of the mother and her son. It was accompanied by one from the factor  himself, another from the princess mother, and by a tiny note from  Minnetaki, who pleaded with the others that Roderick and Mrs. Drew  might spend the winter with them at Wabinosh House.
  &#8220;You need not fear about losing your position.&#8221; wrote Wabigoon. &#8220;We  shall make more money up here this winter than you could earn in  Detroit in three years. We will hunt wolves. The country is alive with  them, and the government gives a bounty of fifteen dollars for every  scalp taken. Two winters ago I killed forty and I did not make a  business of it at that. I have a tame wolf which we use as a decoy.  Don't bother about a gun or anything like that. We have everything  here.&#8221;
  For several days Mrs. Drew and her son deliberated upon the  situation before a reply was sent to the Newsomes. Roderick pleaded,  pictured the glorious times they would have, the health that it would  give them, and marshaled in a dozen different ways his arguments in  favor of accepting the invitation. On the other hand, his mother was  filled with doubt. Their finances were alarmingly low, and Rod would be  giving up a sure though small income, which was now supporting them  comfortably. His future was bright, and that winter would see him  promoted to ten dollars a week in the mercantile house where he was  employed. In the end they came to an understanding. Mrs. Drew would not  go to Wabinosh House, but she would allow Roderick to spend the winter  there&#8212;and word to this effect was sent off into the wilderness.
  Three weeks later came Wabigoon's reply. On the tenth of October he  would meet Rod at Sprucewood, on the Black Sturgeon River. Thence they  would travel by canoe up the Sturgeon River to Sturgeon Lake, take  portage to Lake Nipigon, and arrive at Wabinosh House before the ice of  early winter shut them in. There was little time to lose in making  preparations, and the fourth day following the receipt of Wabi's letter  found Rod and his mother waiting for the train which was to whirl the  boy into his new life. Not until the eleventh did he arrive at  Sprucewood. Wabi was there to meet him, accompanied by an Indian from  the Post; and that same afternoon the journey up Black Sturgeon River  was begun.
