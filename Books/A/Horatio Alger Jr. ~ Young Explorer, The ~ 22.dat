    One morning about eleven o'clock they came in sight of Murphy's. It   was only a mining-settlement of the most primitive description. A  few  tents and cabins, with rough, bearded men scattered here and  there,  intent upon working their claims, gave it a picturesque  appearance,  which it has lost now. It was then a more important  place than at  present, however, for the surface diggings are  exhausted, and it is  best known-to-day by its vicinity to the famous  Calaveras grove of big  trees. 
  &quot;So this is Murphy's?&quot; said Ben, rather disappointed. &quot;It doesn't   seem to be much of a place.&quot; 
  &quot;You didn't expect to see a regular town, did you?&quot; asked Bradley. 
  &quot;I don't know. I hardly knew what to expect. It seems a rough   place.&quot; 
  &quot;And I suppose the people seem rough, too?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;So they are in appearance; but you can't tell what a man has been,   by his looks here. Why, the man that worked the next claim to me was   a college graduate, and not far away was another who had been mayor   of a Western city.&quot; 
  &quot;And were they dressed like these men here?&quot; asked Ben. 
  &quot;Quite as roughly. It won't do to wear store-clothes at the mines.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I suppose not; but these men look like immigrants just come   over.&quot; 
  Bradley laughed. 
  &quot;Wait till we have been at work a little while, and we shall look  no  better,&quot; he said, laughing. 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; asked Ben suddenly, stopping short while an   expression of horror came over his face. 
  Bradley followed the direction of his finger, and saw suspended  from  a tree the inanimate body of a man, the features livid and   distorted, and wearing an expression of terror and dismay, as if his   fate had come upon him without time for preparation. 
  &quot;I reckon that's a thief,&quot; answered Bradley unconcernedly. 
  &quot;A thief! Do they hang people for stealing out here?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, they have to. You see, my lad, there ain't any laws here, nor   courts. If a man steals, the miners just take the matter into their   own hands, and if there ain't a doubt of it, they hang him as soon  as  they catch him.&quot; 
  &quot;It's horrible!&quot; said Ben, who had never before seen the victim of  a  violent death. 
  &quot;Maybe it is, but what can we do?&quot; 
  &quot;Put him in prison,&quot; suggested Ben. 
  &quot;There ain't any prisons, and, if there were, there would be nobody   to keep them.&quot; 
  Just then Bradley was hailed by a rough-looking man, whom at home   Ben would have taken for a tramp. 
  &quot;What, Bradley, back again? I didn't expect to see you here?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't expect to come, Hunter, but I fooled away my money in   'Frisco, and have come back for more.&quot; 
  &quot;And who's this boy-your son, or nephew?&quot; 
  &quot;No; he's no kin to me. I ran across him down to 'Frisco. Ben, let   me make you acquainted with my old chum, Frank Hunter. He isn't much   to look at, but-&quot; 
  &quot;I have seen better days,&quot; interrupted Hunter, smiling. &quot;I was   rather a dandy in my college days at old Yale, though I don't look   like it now.&quot; 
  Ben regarded him with surprise. He had not dreamed that this   sun-brown, bearded man, in the roughest of mining-garbs, had ever   seen the inside of a college. 
  Hunter smiled at the boy's evident surprise. 
  &quot;I don't look like a college graduate, do I? But I assure you I am   not the worst-dressed man in camp. My friend, the mayor, is   rougher-looking than I. Some time I hope to return to the haunts of   civilization, and then I will try to conform to habits which I have   almost forgotten.&quot; 
  &quot;How are you making out, Hunter?&quot; asked Bradley. 
  &quot;Pretty well. I have made more here in six months than I did by   three years' practise of law before I came out here.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you like it as well, Mr. Hunter?&quot; Ben could not help asking   curiously. 
  &quot;No, I don't; but then, it's only for a time, as I say to myself   when I get tired of the rough life I am leading. When I've made a   respectable pile I shall start for 'Frisco, and take passage home,   put up my shingle again, and wait for clients with money enough to   pay my board while I'm waiting. A young lawyer needs that always.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps you'll be Judge Hunter, in time,&quot; said Bradley. 
  &quot;I've served in that capacity already,&quot; said Hunter unexpectedly,   &quot;and that not longer ago than yesterday. Do you see that poor wretch   up there?&quot; and he pointed to the suspended body already referred to. 
  &quot;Yes; what did he do?&quot; 
  &quot;He was a notorious thief-served a term in the penitentiary East  for  stealing, and came out here to practise his profession. But this   climate is unhealthy for gentlemen in that line of business.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he rob anybody here?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; you remember Johnson?&quot; 
  &quot;Is he still here?&quot; 
  &quot;He is about ready to go home, with money enough to lift the   mortgage from his farm. We all knew it, for Johnson was so happy  that  he took everybody into his confidence. He had all his money  tied up in  a bag which he kept in his tent. 
  &quot;Imprudent, of course, but we haven't any banks or safes here,&quot;   added Hunter, meeting the question in Ben's eyes. &quot;Well, this  rascal,  Ross, wormed himself into his confidence, found out exactly  where the  bag was kept, and night before last, in the middle of the  night, he  crept to the tent, and was in the act of carrying off the  bag, when,  as luck would have it, my friend, the mayor, who was  taking a night  walk in the hope of curing a severe headache, came  upon him. 
  &quot;Ross showed fight, but was overpowered, and tied securely till   morning. When morning came we tried him, I being judge. He was found   guilty, and sentenced to be hung. The sentence was carried into   effect in the afternoon. He won't steal any more, I reckon.&quot; 
  Ben took another hasty look at the dangling criminal whose end had   been so sudden and horrible, and he shuddered. 
  &quot;Why don't you take him down?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;It was ordered that he hang for twenty-four hours, as a warning to   any others in camp who might be tempted to steal. The time isn't up   yet. 
  &quot;You are a young gold-hunter,&quot; said Hunter, scanning over hero's   youthful face. 
  &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Ben confessed; &quot;but I had to earn a living, and I   thought I could do it better here than at home.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you from the East?&quot; 
  &quot;I am from Hampton, in New York State.&quot; 
  &quot;I know something of Hampton,&quot; said Hunter. &quot;I have never been   there; but I have a distant relative living there.&quot; 
  &quot;Who is it?&quot; asked Ben, with interest. &quot;I know everybody there.&quot; 
  &quot;I dare say you know my relative, for I am given to understand that   he is the great man of Hampton.&quot; 
  &quot;Mayor Sturgis?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, that is his name. He married a cousin of my mother, so the   relationship is not very close. He is rich, isn't he?&quot; 
  &quot;He is the richest man in Hampton.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose he is aware of that fact,&quot; said Hunter, laughing. 
  &quot;If he isn't, his son, Sam, is,&quot; replied Ben. &quot;Sam wanted to engage   me as his servant before I came away. He wanted me to black his   boots.&quot; 
  &quot;And you objected, I suppose?&quot; 
  &quot;I wouldn't work for Sam Sturgis for a hundred dollars a month!&quot;   said Ben emphatically. 
  &quot;Then you don't like him?&quot; 
  &quot;He is very big-feeling,&quot; said Ben, using a boy's word, &quot;and likes   to boss all the rest of the boys. He thinks he is far above us all.&quot; 
  &quot;He ought to come out here. California takes the airs out of a man   if he has any. We are all on an equality here, and the best man   wins-I mean the man of the most pluck-for success doesn't depend on   moral excellence exactly. Well, old friend, are you going to settle   down among us again?&quot; 
  It was to Bradley this question was addressed. 
  &quot;I don't know. I'm here on a little matter of business, along of   this boy. Is Richard Dewey here now?&quot; 
  &quot;Dewey? No. He had poor luck, and he dusted a month ago.&quot; 
  Ben and his companion exchanged glances of disappointment. 
  &quot;Where did he go?&quot; asked Bradley, who was evidently getting   discouraged. 
  &quot;He was going to the mountains,&quot; he said. &quot;He had been studying up   something about minerals, and he had an idea that he'd find a rich   ledge among the Sierras that would pay better than this   surface-mining.&quot; 
  &quot;Is there anybody that knows what direction he took?&quot; 
  &quot;My friend, the mayor, knows as well as any man. Dewey was his next   neighbor, and often talked over his plans with him.&quot; 
  &quot;Then we will go and see the mayor.&quot; 
  &quot;No need of going, here he comes.&quot;
