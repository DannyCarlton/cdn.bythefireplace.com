  Kent had not forgotten that he was an outlaw, but he was not   afraid. Now that he had something new and thrilling to fight for,  he  fell back again upon what he called &quot;the finesse of the game.&quot;  He  approached Chippewyan cautiously, although he was sure that  even his  old friends at the Landing would fail to recognize him  now. His beard  was four or five inches long, and his hair was  shaggy and uncut.  Picard had made him a coat, that winter, of  young caribou skin, and it  was fringed like an Indian's. Kent  chose his time and entered  Chippewyan just before dusk. 
  Oil lamps were burning in the Hudson's Bay Company's store when he   went in with his furs. The place was empty, except for the  factor's  clerk, and for an hour he bartered. He bought a new  outfit, a  Winchester rifle, and all the supplies he could carry.  He did not  forget a razor and a pair of shears, and when he was  done he still had  the value of two silver fox skins in cash. He  left Chippewyan that  same night, and by the light of a Winter moon  made his camp half a  dozen miles northward toward Smith Landing. 
  He was on the Slave River now and for weeks traveled slowly but   steadily northward on snowshoes. He avoided Fort Smith and Smith   Landing and struck westward before he came to Fort Resolution. It  was  in April that he struck Hay River Post, where the Hay River  empties  into Great Slave Lake. Until the ice broke up, Kent worked  at Hay  River. When it was safe, he started down the Mackenzie in a  canoe. It  was late in June when he turned up the Liard to the  South Nahani. 
  &quot;You go straight through between the sources of the North and the   South Nahani,&quot; Marette had told him. &quot;It is there you find the   Sulphur Country, and beyond the Sulphur Country is the Valley of   Silent Men.&quot; 
  At last he came to the edge of this country. He camped with the   stink of it in his nostrils. The moon rose, and he saw that  desolate  world as through the fumes of a yellow smoke. With dawn  he went on. 
  He passed through broad, low morasses out of which rose sulphurous   fogs. Mile after mile he buried himself deeper in it, and it  became  more and more a dead country, a lost hell. There were berry  bushes on  which there grew no berries. There were forests and  swamps, but  without a living creature to inhabit them. 
  It was a country of water in which there were no fish, of air in   which there were no birds, of plants without flowers&#8212;a reeking,   stinking country still with the stillness of death. He began to  turn  yellow. His clothing, his canoe, his hands, face&#8212;everything  turned  yellow. He could not get the filthy taste of sulphur out of  his mouth.  Yet he kept on, straight west by the compass Gowen had  given him at  Hay River. Even this compass became yellow in his  pocket. It was  impossible for him to eat. Only twice that day did  he drink from his  flask of water. 
  And Marette had made this journey! He kept telling himself that.   It was the secret way in and out of their hidden world, a region   accursed by devils, a forbidden country to both Indian and white  man.  It was hard for him to believe that she had come this way,  that she  had drunk in the air that was filling his own lungs,  nauseating him a  dozen times to the point of sickness. He worked  desperately. He felt  neither fatigue nor the heat of the warm  water about him. 
  Night came, and the moon rose, lighting up with a sickly glow the   diseased world that had swallowed him. He lay in the bottom of his   canoe, covering his face with his caribou coat, and tried to  sleep.  But sleep would not come. Before dawn he struck on,  watching his  compass by the light of matches. All that day he made  no effort to  swallow food. But with the coming of the second night  he found the air  easier to breathe. He fought his way on by the  light of the moon which  was clearer now. And at last, in a resting  spell, he heard far ahead  of him the howl of a wolf. 
  In his joy he cried out. A western breeze brought him air that he   drank in as a desert-stricken man drinks water. He did not look at   his compass again, but worked steadily in the face of that fresh  air.  An hour later he found that he was paddling again a slow  current, and  when he tasted the water it was only slightly tainted  with sulphur. By  midnight the water was cool and clean. He landed  on a shore of sand  and pebbles, stripped to the skin, and gave  himself such a scouring as  he had never before experienced. He had  worn his old trapping shirt  and trousers, and after his bath he  changed to the outfit which he had  kept clean in his pack. Then he  built a fire and ate his first meal in  two days. 
  The next morning he climbed a tall spruce and surveyed the country   about him. Westward there was a broad low country shut in fifteen  or  twenty miles away by the foothills. Beyond these foothills rose  the  snow-capped peaks of the Rockies. He shaved himself, cut his  hair, and  went on. That night he camped only when he could drive  his canoe no  farther. The waterway had narrowed to a creek, and he  was among the  first green shoulders of the hills when he stopped.  With another dawn  he concealed his canoe in a sheltered place and  went on with his pack. 
  For a week he picked his way slowly westward. It was a splendid   country into which he had come, and yet he found no sign of human   life. The foothills changed to mountains, and he believed he was  in  the Campbell Range. Also he knew that he had followed the  logical  trail from the sulphur country. Yet it was the eighth day  before he  came upon a sign which told him that another living  being had at some  time passed that way. What he found were the  charred remnants of an  old camp-fire. It had been a white man's  fire. He knew that by the  size of it. It had been an all-night  fire of green logs cut with an  axe. 
  On the tenth day he came to the westward slope of the first range   and looked down upon one of the most wonderful valleys his eyes  had  ever beheld. It was more than a valley. It was a broad plain.  Fifty  miles across it rose the towering majesty of the mightiest  of all the  Yukon mountains. 
  And now, though he saw a paradise about him, his heart began to   sink within him. It seemed to him inconceivable that in a country  so  vast he could find the spot for which he was seeking. His one  hope lay  in finding white men or Indians, some one who might guide  him. 
  He traveled slowly over the fifty-mile plain rich with a verdure   of green, covered with flowers, a game paradise. Few hunters had  come  so far out of the Yukon mountains, he told himself. And none  had come  from out of the sulphur country. It was a new and  undiscovered world.  On his map it was a blank space. And there  were no signs of people.  Ahead of him the Yukon mountains rose in  an impenetrable wall, peak  after peak, crested with snow, towering  like mighty watchdogs above  the clouds. He knew what lay beyond  them&#8212;the great rivers of the  Western slope, Dawson City, the gold  country and its civilization. But  those things were on the other  side of the mountains. On his side  there was only the vast and  undisputed silence of a paradise as yet  unclaimed by man. 
  As he went on into this valley there grew upon him a strange and   comforting peace. Yet with it there was a steadily increasing  belief  that he would not find that for which he had come in  search. He did  not attempt to analyze this belief. It became a  part of him, just as  his mental tranquillity had grown upon him.  His one hope of success  was that nearer the mountains he might  find white men or Indians. 
  He no longer used his compass, but guided himself by a cluster of   three gigantic peaks. One of these was taller than the other two.  As  he journeyed, his eyes were always returning to it. It  fascinated him,  impinged itself upon him as the watcher of a  million years, guarding  the valley. He began to think of it as the  Watcher. Each hour of his  progress seemed to bring it a little  more intimately to his vision.  From his first night's camp in the  valley he saw the moon sink behind  it. Within him a voice that  never died kept whispering to him that  this mountain, greater than  all the others, had been Marette's  guardian. Ten thousand times  she must have looked at it, as he had  looked at it that day&#8212;if  her home was anywhere this side of the  Campbell Range. A hundred  miles away she could have seen the Watcher  on a clear day. 
  On the second day the mountain continued to grow upon Kent. By   mid-afternoon it began to take on a new character. The peak of it  was  in the form of a mighty castle that changed as he advanced.  And the  two lesser peaks were forming into definite contours.  Before the haze  of twilight dimmed his vision, he knew that what  he had seen was not a  whimsical invention of his imagination. The  Watcher had grown into the  shape of a mighty human head facing  south. A restless excitement  possessed him, and he traveled on  long after dusk. At dawn he was on  the trail again. Westward the  sky cleared, and suddenly he stopped,  and a cry came from him. 
  The Watcher's head was there, as if chiseled by the hands of   giants. The two smaller peaks had unveiled their mystery.  Startling  and weird, their crests had taken on the form of human  heads. One of  them was looking north. The other faced the valley.  And Kent, his  heart pounding, cried to himself, 
  &quot;The Silent Men!&quot; 
  He did not hear himself, but the thought itself was a tumultuous   thing within him. It came upon him like an inundation, a sudden  and  thrilling inspiration backed by the forces of a visual truth.  THE  VALLEY OF SILENT MEN. He repeated the words, staring at the  three  colossal heads in the sky. Somewhere near them, under them,  &#8212;one side  or the other&#8212;was Marette's hidden valley! 
  He went on. A strange joy consumed him. In it, at times, his grief   was obliterated, and it seemed to him in these moments that  Marette  must surely be at the valley to greet him when he came to  it. But  always the tragedy of the Death Chute came back to him,  and with it  the thought that the three giant heads were watching&#8212;  and would  always watch&#8212;for a beloved lost one who would never  return. As the  sun went down that day, the face bowed to the  valley seemed alive with  the fire of a living question sent  directly to Kent. 
  &quot;Where is she?&quot; it asked. &quot;Where is she? Where is she?&quot; 
  That night Kent did not sleep. 
  The next day there lay ahead of him a low and broken range, the   first of the deeper mountains. He climbed this steadily, and at  noon  had reached the crest. And he knew that at last he was  looking down  into the Valley of Silent Men. It was not a wide  valley, like the  other. On the far side of it, three or four miles  away, rose the huge  mountain whose face was looking down upon the  green meadows at its  foot. Southward Kent could see for a long  distance, and in the vivid  sunlight he saw the shimmer of creeks  and little lakes, and the rich  glow of thick patches of cedar and  spruce and balsam, scattered like  great rugs of velvety luster  amid the flowering green of the valley.  Northward, three or four  miles away the range which he had climbed  made a sharp twist to  the east, and that part of the valley&#8212;following  the swing of the  range&#8212;was lost to him. He turned in this direction  after he had  rested. It was four o'clock when he came to the elbow in  the  valley, and could look down into the hidden part of it. 
  What he saw at first was a giant cup hollowed out of the   surrounding mountains, a cup two miles from brim to brim, the end  of  the valley itself. It took him a few moments to focus his  vision so  that it would pick up the smaller and more intimate  things half a mile  under him, and yet, before he had done this, a  sound came up to him  that set aquiver every nerve in his body. It  was the far-down,  hollow-sounding barking of a dog. 
  The warm, golden haze that precedes sunset in the mountains, was   gathering between him and the valley, but through this he made out   after a time evidences of human habitation almost straight under  him.  There was a small lake out of which ran a shimmering creek,  and close  to this lake, yet equally near to the base of the  mountain on which he  was standing, were a number of buildings and  a stockade which looked  like a toy. He could see no animals, no  movement of any kind. 
  Without seeking for a downward trail he began to descend. Again he   did not question himself. An overwhelming certainty possessed him.  Of  all places in the world this must be the Valley of Silent Men. 
  And below him, flooded and half-hidden in the illusive sun-mist,   was Marette's old home. It seemed to him now that it belonged to  him,  that he was a part of it, that in going to it he was  achieving his  last great resting place, his final refuge, his own  home. And the  thought became strangely a part of him that a  welcome must be waiting  for him there. He hurried until his breath  came pantingly between his  lips and he was forced to rest. And at  last he found himself where his  progress was made a foot at a  time, and again and again he was forced  to climb back and detour  around treacherous slides and precipitous  breaks which left sheer  falls at his feet. The mist thickened in the  valley. The sun sank  behind the western peaks, and swiftly after that  the gloom of  twilight deepened. It was seven o'clock when he came to  the edge  of the plain, at least a mile below the elbow which shut out  the  cup in the valley. He was exhausted. His hands were bruised and   bleeding. Darkness shut him in when he went on. 
  When he rounded the elbow of the mountain, he did not try to keep   back the joyous cry that came to his lips. Ahead of him there were   lights. A few of them were scattered, but nearest to him he saw a   cluster of them, like the glow that comes from a number of  illumined  windows. He quickened his pace as he drew nearer to  them, and at last  he wanted to run. And then something stopped  him, and it seemed to him  that his heart had risen into his throat  and was choking him until he  could not breathe. 
  It was a man's voice he heard, calling through the twilight gloom   a name. &quot;Marette&#8212;Marette&#8212;Marette&#8212;&quot; 
  Kent tried to cry out, but his breath came only in a gasp. He felt   himself trembling. He reached out his arms, and a strange madness   rushed like fire into his brain. 
  Again the voice called, &quot;Marette&#8212;Marette&#8212;Marette&#8212;&quot; 
  The cup in the valley echoed the name. It rolled softly up the   mountainside. The air trembled with it, whispered it, passed it   on&#8212;and suddenly the madness in Kent found voice, and he shouted, 
  &quot;Marette&#8212;Marette&#8212;&quot; 
  He ran on. His knees felt weak. He shouted the name again, and the   other voice was silent. Things loomed up out of the mist ahead of   him, between him and the glowing windows. Some one&#8212;two people&#8212;  were  advancing to meet him, doubtfully, wonderingly. Kent was  staggering,  but he cried the name again, and this time it was a  woman's cry that  answered, and one of the two came toward him  swift as a flash of  light. 
  Three paces apart they stood, and in that gloom of the after-   twilight their burning eyes looked at each other, while for a  space  their bodies remained stricken in the face of this miracle  of a great  and merciful God. 
  The dead had risen. By a mighty effort Kent reached out his arms,   and Marette swayed to him. When the other man came up, he found  them  crumpled to their knees on the earth, clasped like children  in each  other's arms. And as Kent raised his face, he saw that it  was Sandy  McTrigger who was looking down at him, the man whose  life he had saved  at Athabasca Landing.
