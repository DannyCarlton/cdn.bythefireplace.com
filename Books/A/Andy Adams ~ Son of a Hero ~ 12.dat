  Jim Falkner, guided ever by a destiny he did not understand, sailed  as  second mate on the Winona&#8212;a much larger vessel than the Waverly&#8212;   during the season of 1906; and when that ended, he went up for his   papers as first mate and obtained them easily. 
  During the weeks that passed before he knew what vessel he would  have  the next season, he lived quietly in the little city on the Erie  shore  that had been &quot;home&quot; to him ever since that short but eventful  cruise  as master of the Lady Gwendolyn&#8212;pirate-craft of his youth.  Here he  became a member in good standing of the Master Mariners'  Society; and  on a Thursday evening&#8212;while the wind whistled menacingly  about the  cornices&#8212;he told his assembled friends why he had chosen a  berth  under Captain Bartholomew Holmes in the Winona. 
  &quot;Holmes had become known since the death of his young wife as a  grim  slave-driver,&quot; said Jim Falkner. &quot;I wanted some experience under  such  a master, but I found him merely a rigid disciplinarian&#8212;hard, to  be  sure, but always fair&#8212;a man who expected always the best his crew   could do and who never was satisfied with less. I dare say that had   anyone here passed from mate to master under similar circumstances&#8212;   and then, within the year, lost what he thought most precious in the   whole world&#8212;he would scarcely have stood it as well. 
  &quot;Captain Wiggs' girl arrived in Buffalo on the eight-fifteen train.   Ten minutes later the excited captain was hurrying her down to the   thick, coal-grimed darkness of the river, where the din of loading and   emptying vessels, the glare of tug lights, and the signals of the   incoming and outbound ships filled the night with the light and life   of the dirtiest and busiest port on the lakes. 
  &quot;Captain Wiggs was overflowing with joy. Above the rattle of wheels  on  cobblestone pavements, the wheezing of innumerable exhaust pipes,  and  a hundred other noises, his voice rumbled cheerfully, while his   daughter, panting and laughing, ran at times to keep pace with him.   The skipper of the JENNIE CULLOM was short and thick; he stood five   feet seven and weighed two hundred and eighty pounds. When he paused   at last where a vista of ships' lights hung low, like a thousand   varicoloured stars, he was wheezing like a stranded fish, but still   talking. 
  &quot;'There she is!' he announced, catching his breath in a staccato of   gasps.&quot; She's lit up&#8212;ready f'r you&#8212;ever'thing nach'r'l!' 
  &quot;He pointed to a rim of lights hung along the gangway of a  freighter  which, in the lantern-lit gloom, looked like its master,  short and  fat; then he whisked his girl over the plank and released  the last  volume of breath in him in a bellow for the mate. 
  &quot;'Bart&#8212;Bart, m'lad, where are y'?' 
  &quot;Bartholomew Holmes had purposely lost himself in a group of men   working about the windlass. For hours he had been preparing himself   for the ordeal of meeting the captain's daughter. As he came slowly   out into the light, responsive to Captain Wiggs' summons, he was   struggling to control the uncomfortable bigness that welled up into   his throat, his heart beat like a drum and his face was red with hot   blood. The girl saw him almost before he had detached himself from the   darkness. She hurried to meet him. 
  &quot;'You don't seem a bit anxious to see me,' she cried, an inflection  of  disappointment in her voice. 'Aren't you glad, Bart?' She held out  her  two bands and the mate took them in his big trembling fists. 
  &quot;'I'm glad,' he said. 'I&#8212;I've been wanting to see you for a long   time, Jean, ever since you&#8212;' he swallowed hard, and added: 'I've been   wanting to see you damned bad, Jean!' 
  &quot;The girl was laughing before he realized what he had said. Then  she  became very sober. As the captain came puffing up over the deck  she  drew her hands from the mate's grasp and said, with a touch of  piquant  naivete: 'You're the same old Bart, always bashful&#8212;dreadfully   bashful!' Then she turned away with a laughing good night and Bart   Holmes went back among the men, dully wondering if he knew what she   had meant, and with a new and growing happiness in him. 
  &quot;'Heave up, boys!' he cried. 'Let's get under weigh before that big   fellow signalling out there comes in and blocks us. Ho, there, Cap'n   Stevens! He shouted down into the blackness alongside, where for half   an hour a tug had been lying. We're ready, Cap'n Stevens. Pay out your   line!' This trip was to be his last one before he went up for his own   papers as master. 
  &quot;He walked slowly forward, lighted his pipe, and watched the dock   lights as the old freighter slipped out silently and elbowed her way   between giant steel ships into the thousand-mile highway that led to   Duluth. When the thin white breakwaters were left behind, like ghost-   lines edging the city, the tug dropped off and drifted back, and with   the cheerful good-byes of the crews the JENNIE CULLOM began pounding   her way into the Upper Lakes. 
  &quot;A mile or more over the starboard rail occasional lights shone   faintly along the New York shore. The mate always watched these when   going out. He knew that where the edge of the city's night-glow melted   away into gloom there were two little cottages, side by side, hidden   behind a great apple orchard that was there before he was born. 
  &quot;In those cottages, years before, he and the captain's girl had  lived;  in the orchard and along the beach they had passed their  childhood  days together, he the son of a fisherman's widow, she the  daughter of  a schooner's master. Every time the JENNIE CULLOM left  Buffalo his  retrospection ended with the scene of a summer morning  when little  Jean, crying as though her heart would break, had joined  him in the  old orchard with the terrible news that her father was  going to send  her away. He remembered how he had blubbered then, and  how he had gone  to Captain Wiggs and begged of him not to make the  girl go. But it had  long been the skipper's dream to make a lady of  his motherless child,  so she was sent to an aunt in Boston, and for  many months the boy was  alone and miserable. 
  &quot;To-night he went over those days again in his memory. He smiled,  and  his heart warmed throbbingly, as he thought of the letters they  wrote  &#8212;letters in which Jean called him 'Dearest Bart,' and in which  they  both said things which made him flush now as he recalled them.  Jean  came home once or twice during the first year, but after that her   visits were few. The letters became more and more infrequent until at   last the boy was ashamed of the scrawls he wrote. Then he went to sea,   and while he matured among the rough breed of the lakes, Captain   Wiggs' girl became a lady. The Jean he had known seven years before   had returned, more beautiful than he had ever dreamed she would be,   and he began to fear that their chumship lay only in the old memories   of the orchard. 
  &quot;Bart Holmes watched the fading shores until a mist came into his   eyes. Jean was with him again, but it was not the Jean of his boyhood,   the little girl of the old cottage and the big orchard. He stood   thinking of these things until there was nothing but darkness of the   lake about him, except where a glow hovered over the receding city.   Then he went to his cabin and lay awake until midnight, thinking of   Jean, 
  &quot;The JENNIE CULLOM was a wooden freighter, and slow. A thousand  times  the mate had regretted this fact, but during the following three  days  and nights he wished that she sailed under canvas instead of  steam.  They were the happiest days he had ever lived, and most of his  time,  even when he was on watch, was spent in Jean's company. 
  &quot;The first morning out from Buffalo she appeared on deck with her  hair  in a long braid, and Bart smiled in honest joy. In the afternoon  she  discarded her yachting suit for an old dress belonging to the  cook,  and began to take a keen interest in the running parts of the  ship.  She made friends with the stokers, ate supper with the hands  aft, won  the heart of old Robbins, the wheelman, by raising blisters  on her  pretty hands at the wheel, and lifted the mate into a seventh  heaven  by insisting that he should accompany her in all of her  explorations  and assist her in her experiments. 
  &quot;Once, when Jean smiled up into his face, her eyes filled with   sparkling happiness, he caught one of her hands in his own and held it   for a full half-minute while his clumsy tongue struggled to say what   was burning in his soul. But the words failed to come. 
  &quot;At another time, during a blow off Saginaw Bay, when the girl was   leaning over to see the rush of waves under the vessel's bow, he dared   to put a supporting arm partly around her waist. Jean turned her   tempting face up to him and laughed, and the mate felt himself   blushing so furiously that he was glad when she looked into the sea   again. He knew that he was a coward in her presence. At times he   cursed himself roundly for it, at others he reasoned that it was his   better sense which had prevailed. 
  &quot;As the days and evenings passed, days and evenings when he was  almost  constantly in Jean's company, Bart Holmes found that in spite  of his  battle against it the spark of hope was beginning to burn in  his  breast. He could not but see that Jean was sometimes more than  kind to  him. Her smiles, the little pressures she gave his arm, and  the  occasional touches of her soft hands against his own consumed him  with  the thought that he might still be something to her. He imagined  at  times that her voice was almost tender as she talked of the days  they  had spent together in the little cottages back of the old  orchard; and  once, when they were sitting in the soft moonlight, he  could have  sworn that there were tears in her eyes as she recalled  memories of  the old home. He had taken her hand for a moment then, but  in his  nervousness and his fear he had remained silent. 
  &quot;That was the evening they were approaching the Soo. Jean had gone  to  her cabin early, with the promise that she would come on deck again   before retiring for the night. The mate took advantage of this   interval by reviewing the events of the past three days. As he went   over them one by one, from the day Jean had chided him for not   greeting her more warmly, he became more and more convinced that she   had encouraged him to speak. For the time, what he considered to be   his own unworthiness was forgotten, and Jean's actions, her smiles,   and her gently spoken memories of the past bore a new and potent   meaning for him. He was filled with a throbbing, overmastering hope,   and when at last he saw Jean come out of the cabin and walk to the   side of the ship he came quietly up behind her, his love burning on   his lips. The girl heard him and turned, and the words he was about to   speak were interrupted by her own. 
  &quot;'I was thinking of you, Bart,' she said softly. 'I've wanted to  tell  you something all day, but&#8212;I haven't. Will you do something for  me?' 
  &quot;'Anything, Jean!' 
  &quot;'Well&#8212;' The girl slipped a hand through his arm.' Well&#8212;you see,'   she continued, 'I've got a friend coming aboard at the Soo.' She shot   a glance into her companion's face, then gazed demurely at a schooner   fading away in the moonlight. 'It's a man.' She felt a sudden tremor   in the arm she held 'A young man from Boston,' she added, 'who has   come almost two thousand miles to take this trip across Superior in my   company. He's rather foolish don't you think?' She did not wait for a   reply. 'I want you to help make it pleasant for him. Will you, Bart?' 
  &quot;As the apparent meaning of Jean's words came to him the young mate   straightened. Through him went a shudder which the girl did not feel,   for he had dropped her hand. It was like an electric shock, something   fatal to all that had risen in him, something which destroyed in an   instant every vestige of those things which had lifted him for a brief   time above his own level. When it had passed away it left behind the   ugly truth that he was his old clumsy self again, an uncultured,   cross-grained specimen of the lakes. Once more Jean was the lady. But   the revulsion had come with more than ordinary force. In his own   respect it left him little more than a wreck of what he had been when   the girl came aboard at Buffalo. He had made a fool of himself&#8212;the   biggest fool in the whole world, so far as he knew. A moment more and   he would have brought upon himself Jean's pity, or her contempt. 
  &quot;He realized the narrowness of his escape. But with the knowledge  of  his own stupidity came the thought that Jean&#8212;not the old Jean, but   the new Jean from Boston, the Jean who had been made into a lady, and   in whom he would have placed his honest confidence beyond all others&#8212;   had been playing with him. She had allowed him to place his arm around   her, she had let him hold her hand; he knew that he might have kissed   her, if he had dared. Yet she had known that her lover from the East   would be with her within a few hours. 
  &quot;To Bart Holmes, strong in the honour of a simple lake mother and   ignorant of the ways of women, such a thing was unbelievable.   Unseeing, unhearing, he gazed steadily for a few moments out into the   darkness, then turned without a word and walked away. Though he heard   Jean call him and knew that she followed him a few steps across the   deck, he did not pause. Loving her, yet despising what she had done;   crushed but cured, he went among the men aft, while Jean, her heart   beating with sudden tumult, her face flushing hotly, hurried into her   cabin. 
  &quot;For a long time she sat quietly near the partly opened door of her   room, listening for footsteps which might be those of the mate. She   realized, slowly at first, the significance of Bart's actions, and   knew that she had wounded him bitterly, though unintentionally. 
  &quot;In the silent darkness of her room she condemned herself for what  she  had said. Why had she hinted that the man from Boston was her  lover?  Why, instead of playing the hypocrite with Bart, had she not  told him  the truth&#8212;that the man at the Soo was a brother of her  dearest girl  chum, doomed by a malady which it was hoped a lake trip  might retard?  She had pitied the man, and, for her chum's sake as well  as for her  own, had invited him to the hospitality of her father's  ship. Why had  she not told all this? If she could see him  now&#8212;to-night&#8212;she would  explain, she would tell him that she had  lied&#8212;yes, lied&#8212;and that she  was sorry. 
  &quot;For more than an hour she watched for the mate but he did not go  to  his cabin. She walked forward and aft. If Bart was on either deck,  he  kept out of her sight. This was like a touch of fire to the girl's   spirit. She regretted what she had done, but if the mate was not   inclined to be even courteous she would postpone the explanation she   had intended to make. And why should she explain to him, after all? He   had been disagreeable, he did not return when she called to him;   anyway, morning would do. So she went to bed, uneasy, a trifle angry. 
  &quot;Early the following morning the Jennie Cullom entered the Soo  locks.  At dawn, two hours before the watch was up, Bart Holmes aroused  the  second mate and went to his cabin without waiting for breakfast.  He  knew that, according to the precedent she had established, Jean  would  come on deck with the break of day, and he did not care to meet  her,  much less his rival from the East, who would probably come aboard   before the freighter started on her lifts into Superior. 
  &quot;Smoking incessantly, he counted the hours in his cabin. He figured  by  the position of the ship that the man from Boston came aboard  between  eight o'clock and eight-thirty. He tried to work himself into  the  belief that now he cared nothing about his presence, or that of  the  girl, but failed dismally, and finally fell asleep fighting  against  his jealousy and his love&#8212;the best thing that could have  happened to  a man who had slept less than an hour out of ten in a  period of three  days and four nights. From his slumber he was aroused  by a knocking at  the door which called him to dinner. 
  &quot;The first persons the mate encountered as he came from his cabin  were  Jean and the man from Boston. In a single glance Bart measured  his  rival, a thin, pale young man, stoop-shouldered and with eyes that  had  the light of a fever in them. He was not good-looking; but there  was  something likeable about him, something that unconsciously and   instantly appealed to one, even to the mate, who was prepared to hate   him. But the knowledge that he was Jean's lover and that he was taking   Jean from him kept back the greeting that the sailor would otherwise   have given. As the girl smiled Bart touched his hat stiffly; as she   advanced a step to meet him, her eyes questioning, her lips framed to   words, he bowed slightly and passed within a dozen feet of her on his   way to the mess-room. 
  &quot;During the remainder of the day he managed to keep out of Jean's   presence. Several times in the afternoon the girl sought a   reconciliation. Twice she waved her hand at the mate and smilingly   beckoned. Once she left the Boston man's side and approached him, but   the sailor went among the men aft as though he had not seen her. At   this the girl tossed her head and deigned no more glances or smiles or   friendly beckoning's in Bart's direction. This was what the mate   desired. He felt relieved, for he was still buried deep in his   conviction of Jean's hypocrisy and was determined not to lend himself   again to her amusement. He was even more relieved when later in the   afternoon a light gale sprang up and Jean and the stranger sought the   shelter of their cabins. 
  &quot;As the afternoon advanced the gale increased When the second mate   came to relieve Bart at six o'clock the waves were beginning to roll   against the JENNIE CULLOM with thundering force and the sky was filled   with the peculiar slate-grey thickness that presages a riotous storm   on Lake Superior. Bart knew the signs and smiled grimly as he went   down among the men to eat at mess. He wondered if the man from Boston   was accustomed to the sea. If not&#8212;he chuckled inwardly as he pictured   results, and when he came out of the dining-room, where dishes were   beginning to slide about a little, he steadied himself in the sweeping   wind and regarded with pleasure the thousand choppy billows that   plunged up as black as ink on all sides of the JENNIE CULLOM. 
  &quot;After a little he went to his cabin, divested himself of his  clothing  and crawled into his bunk, comfortably satisfied that a  beautiful  storm was brewing, that the Boston man had already  collapsed, and that  Jean would be compelled to amuse herself alone  during the remainder of  the trip. Then he fell asleep and dreamed of  hoisting the Boston man  to the top of a mainmast, whence he dropped  him to the deck. 
  &quot;When his rival struck there came a concussion that sounded like  the  explosion of a cannon. There followed a dull, rending crash, and  the  vessel shuddered. From his dream the mate was hurled into  wakefulness  &#8212;a wakefulness that brought him into the great dread of  all men, the  dread of death. 
  &quot;In the first seconds of consciousness he realized what had  happened,  and, with a shout of warning to those who might hear him on  the other  side of the cabin walls, he hurried into a part of his  clothing and  dashed out upon the freighter's deck, where the loud  cries of men  forward and aft mingled with the terrifying clanging of  the great gong  which called upon every man aboard ship to fight for  his life. 
  &quot;A hundred tons of water were running off the decks of the Jennie   Cullom. Most of her deck-lights were shattered, and she pitched in the   heavy seas with reverberating booms that told she was driving   broadside in their troughs. As Bart Holmes ran forward the second   officer met him. &quot;'We're stove in!' he shouted. He waved his hand   around the blackness of the sea. 'God knows what&#8212;mebby a derelict&#8212;a   rock&#8212;and we're taking in a lot of water under the for'ard chains!' 
  &quot;From the bridge Bart could hear the booming of the captain's  voice.  Down in the engine-room tinkling bells set the pumps at work  and men's  faces went pallid under their coats of grime. Cassidy, the  engineer,  stood with courage mapped in his face, a heavy wrench  gripped in his  hand as he shouted curses at his assistant, who had  bolted for the  stairway. From the lower landing the mate came and  roared down words  of courage. 
  &quot;'Give 'er all she'll take, Cassidy!' he shouted. 'Don't let the  old  tub rest for a minute, or we'll sink. We'll let you know if it  comes  to the worst!' 
  &quot;He shot back and slammed the door behind him. The jarring of the   pumps sucking on vacuum sounded beneath his feet, and he turned back   to listen. Then came the heavy, choking run of water, and his heart   sank. He hurried on deck, and a moment later the second officer came   out of the forward way and coolly informed him that the ship was   sinking. 'Little need of sounding or pumping,' he said. 'We're filling   like a tin can with the bottom out!' 
  &quot;The mate repeated the words to the captain and ran down to verify.  He  could hear water pouring into the hold with the noise of a small   cataract. After he returned, the signal-call to boats was sent down   into the engine-room and stoke-hole. Captain Wiggs descended the   pilot-house stair to the first and second officers, who stood close as   he shouted his commands. 
  &quot;'Firemen an' deck-hands into the starboard boat, Wilkins!' he  boomed  into the second officer's ears. 'Head south by a little east!  Bart,  you'll take charge of Jean!' The captain almost screamed the  last  words at his first officer, then rushed amidships among the  gathering  men. 
  &quot;Bart Holmes hurried toward the girl's cabin. He did not think of  the  Boston man until he reached Jean's door, and then it flashed into  his  head that perhaps he, too, had come for her. But Jean was alone.  As  the mate came in, naked to the waist and breathing deeply, she  stood  holding to the cabin table, her beautiful hair loose about her   shoulders, her face white but filled with courage. She was waiting   bravely, and as Bart burst through the door she smiled her gladness   and held out her hands. Even then she wanted to tell him&#8212;to close the   breach between them, but in this hour of danger there was still a   coldness in his manner. Without speaking, he fastened a couple of   lifebelts around her and then slipped one over his own shoulders. He   knew that Jean understood, that there was no need of explanation. 
  &quot;'I've been waiting for you, Bart.' said the girl as the mate  hurried  her to the door. 'I knew you'd come&#8212;you or&#8212;' She meant to  say her  father, but the sentence was not completed. As she passed out  of the  cabin the wind smothered what she would have said, and the mate  heard  only that which reminded him of the man from the East. 
  &quot;He made no reply, but half dragged her along the deck to where the   lanterns were flitting around the boat davits. As they came amidships   a faint cheer sounded above the noise of the sea, which was battling   less noisily now against the sinking vessel, and Bart knew that the   second officer's boat was launched. In an instant the cheers gave   place to curses as two men rushed across from the starboard davits,   one of them shrieking maledictions. 
  &quot;'He slipped the fall!' the latter shouted, pointing at his  companion.  Then he turned upon the other like a beast: 'You slipped  the fall,  curse you!' He struck out fiercely and the sailor staggered  under the  blow. 'He slipped the fall!' shrieked the man again.  'They've gone 'n'  left us.' A cry of anger and despair went up from  the men, and Jean,  trembling with fear and horror, clung tightly to  the mate. &quot;'Ten of  us!' boomed the captain. 'Make the best of it,  men&#8212;make the best of  it&#8212;one at a time!' He crowded among them, a  great fist raised  threateningly, and the mate sprang to his side. 
  &quot;'One at a time!' Bart shouted after the captain. 
  &quot;'One at a time&#8212;and to name!' 
  &quot;Those of the men who had gone into a panic at the thought of  crowding  ten men into a boat that should hold but eight began to  recover their  reason. One after another Captain Wiggs called out their  names and  they lowered themselves into the blackness of the sea. When  four had  gone below the captain turned to his daughter. 
  &quot;'Jean,' he shouted, 'Jean, girl, you next!' 
  &quot;The mate led her to the side. 'I'll hold you,' he cried in her  ear.'  I'll hold you&#8212;safe!' He took her in his strong arms and lifted  her  over the rail, and for a single moment in that passage his lips  were  pressed against those of the girl. 'Jean, I love you&#8212;I love  you&#8212;' 
  &quot;The girl heard him, and in the darkness she put up her hands, but   other hands reached up and pulled her down. Bart fell back just in   time to see another figure, reeling as if drunk, stagger up among the   men. It was the Boston man, his thin face deathly white in the light   of the lanterns, a deep sickness showing in his bloodshot eyes. The   fifth and the sixth men were climbing over, and did not see; the   seventh, who stood with the captain and the mate, was Cassidy, and   though despair came into his face he did not speak. 
  &quot;'Eleven!' groaned the captain in his beard. 'My God!' He motioned  to  the engineer, but Cassidy remained at the fall, with the boat's  rope  wound tightly around his waist. 'Somebody's got to stay!' he  growled.  'I ain't afraid!' 
  &quot;Bart sprang to the Boston man's side and caught him under the  arms.  'You're next!' he shouted. 'Quick&#8212;' He dragged his rival to the  side  of the ship and almost threw him over. Cassidy had kicked off his   shoes and was tightening his lifebelt with one hand while he held the   fall with the other. 
  &quot;'Cassidy!' thundered the captain. The engineer hunched his naked   shoulders with dogged determination. 'There ain't room f'r all,' he   growled. 'I'm going to stay!' 
  &quot;Bart Holmes caught the engineer by the shoulders. 'Quick,  Cassidy,'  he urged. 'We're all going!' He caught the fall in his own  hand and  pulled the engineer to the rail. 'For God's sake, go down' he  cried in  his ear. 'Go down and shout up there's plenty of room, or  Cap'n  Wiggs'll never leave the ship. Roar it out, Cassidy, roar it  out!' 
  &quot;The engineer climbed over, and Bart, leaning far out, looked down   into the boat. He could see by the light of the lanterns in it that it   was already dangerously overloaded. Jean was in the bottom amidships,   and the others had pulled the Boston man over beside her. Soon   Cassidy's voice came up in a trumpet-like roar. 
  &quot;'Plenty o' room, Cap'n Wiggs, plenty o' room!' he shouted. 'We'll   ride five hundred pounds more!' 
  &quot;'Hear that?' yelled the mate cheerfully. 'Over the side with you,   Cap'n Wiggs! I know you want to go last&#8212;but you can't. You're too   heavy. I've got to give you a powerful lift or you'll swamp the boat!' 
  &quot;He pulled the captain to the side, as he had urged Cassidy, and   crowded him over the rail. As the master of the ship slipped heavily   down among his men the engineer stood erect and stretched up one great   arm imploringly, but instead of reaching for it the mate tossed the   loose rope in Cassidy's face and the small boat shot away from the   sinking vessel. 
  &quot;For an instant Bart caught a glimpse of ten white, horror-filled   faces looking up at him. Then, above the first outburst of men's   voices there came a piercing cry from Jean, and as the boat was swept   out into the night he saw her standing with outstretched arms. But he   made no response. Silently he leaned over the rail and watched the   flashes of the lanterns in the small boat as it was lifted on the   crests of the waves. He knew that Captain Wiggs would attempt to   return for him, and he knew, too, how futile his efforts would be in   the heavy roll of the sea. At first he heard men's shouts, more and   more indistinct with growing distance, but after a little these last   human sounds failed to reach him. 
  &quot;During the few moments that followed, moments which he realized  were  probably closely preceding death, there came contentment into his   heart. He did not fear the end which he knew was fast approaching; he   had told Jean of his love and had taken her in his arms and kissed   her, and he was now giving up his life for her. After this Jean could   never forget him. 
  &quot;Soon there came from beneath him a barely perceptible shock. It  was  followed by another, a shuddering, noiseless throb, as if a charge  of  dynamite had exploded in the hold without making a noise. Where two  or  three lights were burning aft the mate could see the black tops of  the  seas coming higher and higher until they broke in a roar over the   Jennie Cullom's deck. Sullenly they crowded forward, and like a thing   fighting inch by inch against her doom the wooden ship was submerged   until only her lighted peaks stood for a moment triumphant in the   centre of a whirling maelstrom. In another moment they, too, had   disappeared. 
  &quot;Where for a brief spell a hundred different currents shot up  bursting  tons of water the mate was tossed like a piece of  water-logged wood.  He was twisted this way and that, now entirely  submerged, now buoyed  to the surface of the buffeting seas by the cork  belt under his arms.  Instinctively he husbanded the breath that was in  him; and when at  last the place where the freighter had sunk ran once  more in the  regular sweep of the waves, he floated with his head above  them,  exhausted, almost dead, but still possessed of that  unconquerable last  spark which calls upon every man to struggle for  his own preservation.  Slowly his limbs responded, until strongly and  regularly they obeyed  the instance of the man into whom at the last  moment had come the  great love of life. 
  &quot;In the first half-hour of his fight in the sea Bart figured out  his  chances. Unfortunately he did not know at what hour the Jennie  Cullom  had struck. If he had possessed this knowledge he might have  estimated  pretty accurately his distance from the Michigan shore. It  could not  be more than thirty miles; possibly it was less than ten.  The mate had  never heard of a man who had lived to swim thirty miles,  or even  twenty, in the chilling water of Superior. But ten&#8212;he might  do that.  Already he began to feel the chills, the bites of the summer  ice-  devils of Kitchi Gummi, as sailors call them, and he worked  doubly  hard to keep the warmth in his body. 
  &quot;All would have ended soon if the shore had not been very near. But  in  the early dawn two teamsters from a lumber-camp came down to the  edge  of the lake, and there they found Bart Holmes, crumpled up in the   sand, with that glorious last spark still alive in him, but burning   feebly&#8212;so feebly that they thought him dead at first. He was taken up   and carried to the big cabins back in the woods, and for days only   unintelligible mutterings fell from his lips. 
  &quot;On the tenth day something like reason fought its way back into  his  head, and, as the facts came to him one at a time, he revealed   disjointedly the story of the JENNIE CULLOM. After a time the spark   that was burning brighter each day brought him out into good,   wholesome life again; and after that, still too weak to leave his   bunk, he would pass wearisome hours wondering what had become of Jean   and the JENNIE CULLOM'S crew. The thought that they had drowned began   working upon his mind. Horrible pictures would come to him even in his   sleep. 
  &quot;He prayed for the day when he could regain his feet and start  through  the woods for the nearest town, which was twenty miles away,  but his  worry brought back the fever, and so when the camp-supply  wagon left  on its monthly trip to the station he could only sit up and  watch it  as it rattled off over the logging trail. But in the driver's  care was  a slip of paper upon which he had scribbled a few words,  addressed to  Captain Edward Wiggs, Buffalo, and which were to be sent  by telegraph.  In the message he did not speak of Jean, nor did he say  that he was  sick. 
  &quot;Two days and nights passed. Early in the morning of the third day,   while the camp was still asleep, Bart knew that he heard the distant,   hailing cry of the returning driver. Like a shadow he slipped from his   bunk and stole half-naked out into the greyness of the dawn. When four   tired and dripping horses came out into the edge of the clearing, they   stopped suddenly as the man stumbled up to them, almost falling under   their feet in his weakness. His words came hysterically, sobbingly, as   he stretched up his naked arms. 
  &quot;'Anything for me&#8212;for me&#8212;?' 
  &quot;The driver fumbled for a moment under his seat as he recognized  the  sailor, then gave him a little yellow envelope, and lowered his   lantern. The mate snatched the light from him and crouched beside it   upon the ground, with the precious little envelope. 
  &quot;There was not much to read, but when he was done the light of  reason  was almost gone from Bart Holmes' feverish eyes, and he fell  face  downward in the road with a cry that brought the driver to his  side.  As the lumberman raised the mate in his arms his eyes fell upon  the  little slip of paper and he reached out for it. He could see  nothing  in it that should cause a man to act as the sailor had done.  He  spelled it out twice, but he was not enlightened, for he saw only   those plain simple words, not knowing that they would change the whole   course of a man's career: 
  &quot;'My life went out when I thought that my Bart had died. In the  little  old cottage behind the orchard I am waiting for you, praying,  as I  have prayed each night and day, that my beloved will come to me  soon.  JEAN.' 
  &quot;And even as the lumberman read, Bart Holmes, in his delirious  half-  consciousness, was seeing a picture of the old orchard, a  picture of  Jean in it&#8212;the old Jean&#8212;his Jean, for ever and for ever.&quot;
