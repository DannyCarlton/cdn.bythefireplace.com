  For many minutes David stood at the bateau window and watched the   canoe that carried St. Pierre Boulain and the Broken Man back to  the  raft. It moved slowly, as if St. Pierre was loitering with a  purpose  and was thinking deeply of what had passed. Carrigan's  fingers  tightened, and his face grew tense, as he gazed out into  the glow of  the western sun. Now that the stress of nerve-breaking  moments in the  cabin was over, he no longer made an effort to  preserve the veneer of  coolness and decision with which he had  encountered the chief of the  Boulains. Deep in his soul he was  crushed and humiliated. Every nerve  in his body was bleeding. 
  He had heard St. Pierre's big laugh a moment before, but it must   have been the laugh of a man who was stabbed to the heart. And he  was  going back to Marie-Anne like that&#8212;drifting scarcely faster  than the  current that he might steal time to strengthen himself  before he  looked into her eyes again. David could see him,  motionless, his giant  shoulders hunched forward a little, his head  bowed, and in the stern  the Broken Man paddled listlessly, his  eyes on the face of his master.  Without voice David cursed  himself. In his egoism he had told himself  that he had made a  splendid fight in resisting the temptation of a  great love for the  wife of St. Pierre. But what was his own struggle  compared with  this tragedy which St. Pierre was now facing? 
  He turned from the window and looked about the cabin room again&#8212;   the woman's room and St. Pierre's&#8212;and his face burned in its  silent  accusation. Like a living thing it painted another picture  for him.  For a space he lost his own identity. He saw himself in  the place of  St. Pierre. He was the husband of Marie-Anne,  worshipping her even as  St. Pierre must worship her, and he came,  as St. Pierre had come, to  find a stranger in his home, a stranger  who had lain in his bed, a  stranger whom his wife had nursed back  to life, a stranger who had  fallen in love with his most  inviolable possession, who had told her  of his love, who had  kissed her, who had held her close, in his arms,  whose presence  had brought a warmer flush and a brighter glow into  eyes and  cheeks that until this stranger's coming had belonged only to  him.  And he heard her, as St. Pierre had heard her, pleading with him   to keep this man from harm; he heard her soft voice, telling of  the  things that had passed between them, and he saw in her eyes&#8212; 
  With almost a cry he swept the thought and the picture from him.   It was an atrocious thing to conceive, impossible of reality. And  yet  the truth would not go. What would he have done in St.  Pierre's place? 
  He went to the window again. Yes, St. Pierre was a bigger man than   he. For St. Pierre had come quietly and calmly, offering a hand of   friendship, generous, smiling, keeping his hurt to himself, while  he,  Dave Carrigan, would have come with the murder of man in his  heart. 
  His eyes passed from the canoe to the raft, and from the big raft   to the hazy billows of green and golden forest that melted off  into  interminable miles of distance beyond the river. He knew that  on the  other side of him lay that same distance, north, east,  south, and  west, vast spaces in an unpeopled world, the same green  and golden  forests, ten thousand plains and rivers and lakes, a  million  hiding-places where romance and tragedy might remain  forever  undisturbed. The thought came to him that it would not be  difficult to  slip out into that world and disappear. He almost  owed it to St.  Pierre. It was the voice of Bateese in a snatch of  wild and discordant  song that brought him back into grim reality.  There was, after all,  that embarrassing matter of justice&#8212;and the  accursed Law! 
  After a little he observed that the canoe was moving faster, and   that Andre's paddle was working steadily and with force. St.  Pierre  no longer sat hunched in the bow. His head was erect, and  he was  waving a hand in the direction of the raft. A figure had  come from the  cabin on the huge mass of floating timber. David  caught the shimmer of  a woman's dress, something white fluttering  over her head, waving back  at St. Pierre. It was Marie-Anne, and  he moved away from the window. 
  He wondered what was passing between St. Pierre and his wife in   the hour that followed. The bateau kept abreast of the raft,  moving  neither faster nor slower than it did, and twice he  surrendered to the  desire to scan the deck of the floating timbers  through his  binoculars. But the cabin held St. Pierre and Marie-  Anne, and he saw  neither of them again until the sun was setting.  Then St. Pierre came  out&#8212;alone. 
  Even at that distance over the broad river he heard the booming   voice of the chief of the Boulains. Life sprang up where there had   been the drowse of inactivity aboard the raft. A dozen more of the   great sweeps were swiftly manned by men who appeared suddenly from   the shaded places of canvas shelters and striped tents. A murmur  of  voices rose over the water, and then the murmur was broken by  howls  and shouts as the rivermen ran to their places at the  command of St.  Pierre's voice, and as the sweeps began to flash in  the setting sun,  it gave way entirely to the evening chant of the  Paddling Song. 
  David gripped himself as he listened and watched the slowly   drifting glory of the world that came down to the shores of the   river. He could see St. Pierre clearly, for the bateau had worked  its  way nearer. He could see the bare heads and naked arms of the  rivermen  at the sweeps. The sweet breath of the forests filled his  lungs, as  that picture lay before him, and there came into his  soul a  covetousness and a yearning where before there had been  humiliation  and the grim urge of duty. He could breathe the air of  that world, he  could look at its beauty, he could worship it&#8212;and  yet he knew that he  was not a part of it as those others were a  part of it. He envied the  men at the sweeps; he felt his heart  swelling at the exultation and  joy in their song. They were going  home&#8212;home down the big rivers,  home to the heart of God's  Country, where wives and sweethearts and  happiness were waiting  for them, and their visions were his visions as  he stared wide-  eyed and motionless over the river. And yet he was  irrevocably an  alien. He was more than that&#8212;an enemy, a man-hound  sent out on a  trail to destroy, an agent of a powerful and merciless  force that  carried with it punishment and death. 
  The crew of the bateau had joined in the evening song of the   rivermen on the raft, and over the ridges and hollows of the  forest  tops, red and green and gold in the last warm glory of the  sun, echoed  that chanting voice of men. David understood now what  St. Pierre's  command had been. The huge raft with its tented city  of life was  preparing to tie up for the night. A quarter of a mile  ahead the river  widened, so that on the far side was a low, clean  shore toward which  the efforts of the men at the sweeps were  slowly edging the raft. York  boats shot out on the shore side and  dropped anchors that helped drag  the big craft in. Two others  tugged at tow-lines fastened to the  shoreside bow, and within  twenty minutes the first men were plunging  up out of the water on  the white strip of beach and were whipping the  tie-lines about the  nearest trees. David unconsciously was smiling in  the thrill and  triumph of these last moments, and not until they were  over did he  sense the fact that Bateese and his crew were bringing the  bateau  in to the opposite shore. Before the sun was quite down, both  raft  and house-boat were anchored for the night. 
  As the shadows of the distant forests deepened, Carrigan felt   impending about him an oppression of emptiness and loneliness  which  he had not experienced before. He was disappointed that the  bateau had  not tied up with the raft. Already he could see men  building fires.  Spirals of smoke began to rise from the shore, and  he knew that the  riverman's happiest of all hours, supper time,  was close at hand. He  looked at his watch. It was after seven  o'clock. Then he watched the  fading away of the sun until only the  red glow of it remained in the  west, and against the still thicker  shadows the fires of the rivermen  threw up yellow flames. On his  own side, Bateese and the bateau crew  were preparing their meal.  It was eight o'clock when a man he had not  seen before brought in  his supper. He ate, scarcely sensing the taste  of his food, and  half an hour later the man reappeared for the dishes. 
  It was not quite dark when he returned to his window, but the far   shore was only an indistinct blur of gloom. The fires were  brighter.  One of them, built solely because of the rivermen's  inherent love of  light and cheer, threw the blaze of its flaming  logs twenty feet into  the air. 
  He wondered what Marie-Anne was doing in this hour. Last night   they had been together. He had marveled at the witchery of the   moonlight in her hair and eyes, he had told her of the beauty of  it,  she had smiled, she had laughed softly with him&#8212;for hours  they had  sat in the spell of the golden night and the glory of the  river. And  tonight&#8212;now&#8212;was she with St. Pierre, waiting as they  had waited last  night for the rising of the moon? Had she  forgotten? COULD she forget?  Or was she, as he thought St. Pierre  had painfully tried to make him  believe, innocent of all the  thoughts and desires that had come to  him, as he sat worshipping  her in their stolen hours? He could think  of them only as stolen,  for he did not believe Marie-Anne had revealed  to her husband all  she might have told him. 
  He was sure he would never see her again as he had seen her then,   and something of bitterness rose in him as he thought of that. St.   Pierre, could he have seen her face and eyes when he told her that   her hair in the moonlight was lovelier than anything he had ever   seen, would have throttled him with his naked hands in that  meeting  in the cabin. For St. Pierre's code would not have had her  eyes droop  under their long lashes or her cheeks flush so warmly  at the words of  another man&#8212;and he could not take vengeance on  the woman herself. No,  she had not told St. Pierre all she might  have told! There were things  which she must have kept to herself,  which she dared not reveal even  to this great-hearted man who was  her husband. Shame, if nothing more,  had kept her silent. 
  Did she feel that shame as he was feeling it? It was inconceivable   to think otherwise. And for that reason, more than all others, he   knew that she would not meet him face to face again&#8212;unless he  forced  that meeting. And there was little chance of that, for his  pledge with  St. Pierre had eliminated her from the aftermath of  tomorrow's drama,  his fight with Bateese. Only when St. Pierre  might stand in a court of  law would there be a possibility of her  eyes meeting his own again,  and then they would flame with the  hatred that at another time had  been in the eyes of Carmin  Fanchet. 
  With the dull stab of a thing that of late had been growing inside   him, he wondered what had happened to Carmin Fanchet in the years   that had gone since he had brought about the hanging of her  brother.  Last night and the night before, strange dreams of her  had come to him  in restless slumber. It was disturbing to him that  he should wake up  in the middle of the night dreaming of her, when  he had gone to his  bed with a mind filled to overflowing with the  sweet presence of  Marie-Anne Boulain. And now his mind reached out  poignantly into  mysterious darkness and doubt, even as the  darkness of night spread  itself in a thickening canopy over the  river. 
  Gray clouds had followed the sun of a faultless day, and the stars   were veiled overhead. When David turned from the window, it was so   dark in the cabin that he could not see. He did not light the  lamps,  but made his way to St. Pierre's couch and sat down in the  silence and  gloom. 
  Through the open windows came to him the cadence of the river and   the forests. There was silence of human voice ashore, but under  him  he heard the lapping murmur of water as it rustled under the  stern and  side of the bateau, and from the deep timber came the  never-ceasing  whisper of the spruce and cedar tops, and the  subdued voice of  creatures whose hours of activity had come with  the dying out of the  sun. 
  For a long time he sat in this darkness. And then there came to   him a sound that was different than the other sounds&#8212;a low  monotone  of voices, the dipping of a paddle&#8212;and a canoe passed  close under his  windows and up the shore. He paid small attention  to it until, a  little later, the canoe returned, and its occupants  boarded the  bateau. It would have roused little interest in him  then had he not  heard a voice that was thrillingly like the voice  of a woman. 
  He drew his hunched shoulders erect and stared through the   darkness toward the door. A moment more and there was no doubt. It   was almost shock that sent the blood leaping suddenly through his   veins. The inconceivable had happened. It was Marie-Anne out  there,  talking in a low voice to Bateese! 
  Then there came a heavy knock at his door, and he heard the door   open. Through it he saw the grayer gloom of the outside night  partly  shut out a heavy shadow. 
  &quot;M'sieu!&quot; called the voice of Bateese. 
  &quot;I am here,&quot; said David. 
  &quot;You have not gone to bed, m'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  The heavy shadow seemed to fade away, and yet there still remained   a shadow there. David's heart thumped as he noted the slenderness  of  it. For a space there was silence. And then, 
  &quot;Will you light the lamps, M'sieu David?&quot; a soft voice came to   him. &quot;I want to come in, and I am afraid of this terrible  darkness!&quot; 
  He rose to his feet, fumbling in his pocket for matches.
