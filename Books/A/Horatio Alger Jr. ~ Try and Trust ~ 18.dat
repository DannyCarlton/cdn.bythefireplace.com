  Herbert stopped overnight at Columbus. 
  The first train eastward left Columbus at seven o'clock in the  morning.  It was Herbert's intention to take this train, but  unfortunately, as he  thought at the time, the clock at the hotel by  which his movements were  guided was ten minutes too slow. The  consequence was, that before he had  quite reached the depot he saw the  cars going out at the other end. He  ran as fast as possible, hoping  still to make up for lost time, but it  was in vain. 
  &quot;You're too late, youngster,&quot; said a porter, who had been assisting  to  stow away baggage. &quot;You'll have to wait till the next train.&quot; 
  &quot;When does the next train start?&quot; asked our hero. 
  &quot;Twelve o'clock.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I shall have to wait till that time,&quot; Herbert concluded, with   regret. 
  Yet, as he directly afterwards thought, it could make no particular   difference, since he had no stated engagement to meet, and this   consideration enabled him to bear the inevitable delay with a better   grace. 
  &quot;I suppose,&quot; he reflected, &quot;I might as well go back to the hotel.&quot; 
  He turned to leave the building when a carriage drove hastily up to  the  station. It was drawn by two horses, and driven by a negro in  livery. A  lady put her head out of the window and inquired anxiously  if the train  had started. She addressed this question to Herbert, who  happened to be  nearest. 
  &quot;Yes, madam,&quot; he answered, respectfully. 
  &quot;I am so sorry,&quot; said the lady, in a tone of vexation and  perplexity.  &quot;It was very important that my father should take that  train.&quot; 
  &quot;There is another train that starts at twelve,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;It  will  make a difference of a few hours only.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the lady, &quot;but you do not understand my difficulty. The  few  hours' difference in time would be of small importance, but my  father is  blind, and is, of course, for that reason, dependent upon  the kindness  of others. A gentleman of our acquaintance was going by  this train, who  would have taken charge of him and seen him safe to  his destination. By  losing the train we lose his services.&quot; 
  &quot;My dear,&quot; said an elderly gentleman, sitting on the opposite seat,  &quot;if  I can get somebody to see me on board, I think I can manage very  well.&quot; 
  &quot;On no account, father,&quot; was the hasty reply, &quot;particularly under   present circumstances.&quot; 
  &quot;Where is the gentleman going?&quot; asked Herbert, with interest. 
  &quot;To Philadelphia.&quot; 
  &quot;I am going on to New York,&quot; said our hero. &quot;I have been  disappointed  like you. I expected to take the early train.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you intend to go by the next train, then?&quot; asked the lady. 
  &quot;Yes, madam.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, perhaps&#8212;I have a great mind to ask you to take charge of my   father.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be very glad to be of service to you,&quot; said Herbert.  &quot;There is  only one objection,&quot; he added, with some embarrassment. 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; 
  &quot;Why,&quot; said Herbert, frankly, &quot;I am obliged to be economical, and I  was  thinking of buying a second-class ticket.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh,&quot; said the lady, promptly, &quot;there need be no difficulty about  that.  If you will take the trouble to look after my father, we will  gladly pay  for your ticket.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid my services will not be worth so much,&quot; said Herbert,   modestly. 
  &quot;You must leave us to estimate them. If you do what you have  undertaken,  we shall consider the expense well incurred.&quot; 
  Herbert made no further objection. He felt, indeed, that it would  be  quite a lift to him, in the present state of his finances, and  besides  would be a very easy way of earning the money. He therefore  signified  his thanks and his acceptance of the offer. 
  &quot;When did you say the train starts?&quot; asked the lady. 
  &quot;At twelve.&quot; 
  &quot;Nearly five hours. That will be too long to wait. I think, father,  we  will go home.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, my dear, I think that will be best.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you obliged to go home before starting?&quot; the lady inquired,   addressing Herbert. 
  &quot;No, madam, I have no home in Columbus. I passed last night at a  hotel.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you any particular plan for spending the next few hours?&quot; 
  Herbert answered in the negative. 
  &quot;Then will you not ride home with us? You will then be ready to  start  with my father.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be happy to do so.&quot; 
  &quot;I think that will be much the best plan. Pompey, open the carriage  door  for the young gentleman.&quot; 
  Our hero was about to say that he could just as well open the door  for  himself, but he reflected that it was best to adapt himself to the   customs of those he was with. He bowed, therefore, and waited till the   coachman had opened the door for him, and stepped into the carriage.  The  lady signed to him to take a seat beside her, and the door was  closed. 
  &quot;Home, Pompey,&quot; said she, briefly. 
  The coachman ascended to his seat, and the spirited grays were soon   whirling the party rapidly homeward. 
  It was a new position for our hero, and he felt it to be so. His  parents  had never been rich, and latterly had been very poor. Living  in a small  country village, he had never even seen so elegant a  carriage as that in  which he was now riding He sank back upon the  luxuriously cushioned  seat, and he could not help thinking how  pleasant it would be if he  could command so comfortable a conveyance  whenever he wanted to ride  out. But another thought succeeded this. If  he were blind, like the  gentleman whom he was to take charge of, it  would be a very poor  compensation to ride in a luxurious carriage.  After all, things were not  so unequal as they seemed at first sight. 
  &quot;Since you are to be my father's traveling companion,&quot; said the  lady,  &quot;perhaps you will not object to telling us your name.&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly,&quot; said our hero, &quot;my name is Herbert Mason.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you going from home for the first time?&quot; inquired the lady. 
  &quot;I have no home,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;My father and mother are both  dead.&quot; 
  &quot;Excuse me,&quot; said the lady, gently. &quot;I am sorry to have touched  upon a  subject which must awaken sorrowful recollections. My father's  name is  Carroll. Father, you have heard that your young escort is Mr.  Herbert  Mason.&quot; 
  The old gentleman extended his hand, which Herbert took  respectfully. 
  &quot;I am afraid you will find me a troublesome charge,&quot; he said.  &quot;Since I  have become blind I have been compelled to tax the kindness  of others.&quot; 
  &quot;The journey will be pleasanter to me,&quot; said Herbert, politely,  &quot;than if  I were alone.&quot; 
  Mr. Carroll was evidently pleased with this remark, for he turned  toward  Herbert with increased interest. 
  &quot;You can imagine how much more so it will be to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I  have  not your resources for beguiling the tedium of the way. I would  give all  my possessions gladly, for your young eyes. All journeys are  alike to me  now, since, however interesting the scenery, it is a blank  to me.&quot; 
  &quot;That is indeed a privation, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Especially in the journey we are about to take. The Baltimore Ohio   Railroad, as it is called, runs through a romantic and charming  country,  and affords views at once bold and beautiful. Have you ever  traveled  over the road?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you will have all the pleasure of a first discovery. Before I   became blind, before, indeed, the railway was located, I became, as a   young man, familiar with this whole section of country, so that I  have,  at least, the remembrance of it. I am obliged now to live upon  my  memory.&quot; 
  &quot;You say you have never been over this railroad,&quot; said the lady.  &quot;Have  you ever been to the East?&quot; 
  &quot;No, madam, I have always lived in the State of Ohio.&quot; 
  &quot;And you are now going to Philadelphia?&quot; she inquired. 
  &quot;I am going to New York,&quot; said Herbert. 
  &quot;Indeed! Is it on a visit?&quot; 
  &quot;No, madam, I am expecting to live there; that is, if I can make a   living.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you dependent, then, upon your own exertions for support?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, madam.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem very young for such a responsibility.&quot; 
  &quot;I am fourteen.&quot; 
  &quot;I thought you a year older. My Oscar is fourteen, and I am afraid  he  would make a poor hand at supporting himself. What do you think,   father?&quot; 
  &quot;I think you are right, my dear. Oscar has not been placed in   circumstances to develop his self-reliance.&quot; 
  &quot;No; that probably has something to do with it. But, Herbert, if  you  will permit me to call you so, do you not look forward to the  future  with apprehension?&quot; 
  &quot;No, madam,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I am not afraid but that I shall be  able to  get along somehow. I think I shall find friends, and I am  willing to  work.&quot; 
  &quot;That is the spirit that leads to success,&quot; said the old gentleman,   approvingly. &quot;Work comes to willing hands. I think you will succeed.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope so, sir.&quot; 
  Our hero was gratified to meet with so much sympathy from those  whose  wealth placed them far above him in the social scale. But it was  not  surprising, for Herbert had a fine appearance and gentlemanly  manners,  marked, too, by a natural politeness which enabled him to  appear better  than most boys of his age.
