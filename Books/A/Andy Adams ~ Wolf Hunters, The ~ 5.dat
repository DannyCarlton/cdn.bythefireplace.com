  As the Indian youth sped over the trail in the direction of the  rifle-shots he flung his usual caution to the winds. His blood thrilled  with the knowledge that there was not a moment to lose&#8212;that even now,  in all probability, he would be too late to assist his friends. This  fear was emphasized by the absolute silence which followed the five  shots. Eagerly, almost prayerfully, he listened as he ran for other  sounds of battle&#8212;for the report of Mukoki's revolver, or the whoops of  the victors. If there had been an ambush it was all over now. Each  moment added to his conviction, and as he thrust the muzzle of his gun  ahead of him, his finger hovering near the trigger and his snow-blinded  eyes staring ahead into the storm, something like a sob escaped his  lips.
  Ahead of him the stream narrowed until it almost buried itself under  a mass of towering cedars. The closeness of the forest walls now added  to the general gloom, intensified by the first gray pallor of the  Northern dusk, which begins to fall in these regions early in the  afternoon of November days. For a moment, just before plunging into the  gloomy trail between the cedars, Wabi stopped and listened. He heard  nothing but the beating of his own heart, which worked like a  trip-hammer within his breast. The stillness was oppressive. And the  longer he listened the more some invisible power seemed to hold him  back. It was not fear, it was not lack of courage, but&#8212;
  What was there just beyond those cedars, lurking cautiously in the  snow gloom?
  With instinct that was almost animal in its unreasonableness Wabi  sank upon his knees. He had seen nothing, he had heard nothing; but he  crouched close, until he was no larger than a waiting wolf, and there  was a deadly earnestness in the manner in which he turned his rifle  into the deeper gloom of those close-knit walls of forest. Something  was approaching, cautiously, stealthily, and with extreme slowness. The  Indian boy felt that this was so, and yet if his life had depended upon  it he could not have told why. He huddled himself lower in the snow.  His eyes gleamed with excitement. Minute after minute passed, and still  there came no sound. Then, from far up that dusky avenue of cedars,  there came the sudden startled chatter of a moose-bird. It was a  warning which years of experience had taught Wabi always to respect.  Perhaps a roving fox had frightened it, perhaps the bird had taken to  noisy flight at the near tread of a moose, a caribou, or a deer. But&#8212;
  To Wabi the soft, quick notes of the moose-bird spelled man! In an  instant he was upon his feet, darting quickly into the sheltering  cedars of the shore. Through these he now made his way with extreme  caution, keeping close to the bank of the frozen stream. After a little  he paused again and concealed himself behind the end of a fallen log.  Ahead of him he could look into the snow gloom between the cedars, and  whatever was coming through that gloom would have to pass within a  dozen yards of him. Each moment added to his excitement. He heard the  chatter of a red squirrel, much nearer than the moose-bird. Once he  fancied that he heard the striking of two objects, as though a rifle  barrel had accidentally come into contact with the dead limb of a tree.
  Suddenly the Indian youth imagined that he saw something&#8212;an  indistinct shadow that came in the snow gloom, then disappeared, and  came again. He brushed the water and snow from his eyes with one of his  mittened hands and stared hard and steadily. Once more the shadow  disappeared, then came again, larger and more distinct than before.  There was no doubt now. Whatever had startled the moose-bird was coming  slowly, noiselessly.
  Wabi brought his rifle to his shoulder. Life and death hovered with  his anxious, naked finger over the gun trigger. But he was too well  trained in the ways of the wilderness to fire just yet. Yard by yard  the shadow approached, and divided itself into two shadows. Wabi could  now see that they were men. They were advancing in a cautious,  crouching attitude, as though they expected to meet enemies somewhere  ahead of them. Wabi's heart thumped with joy. There could be no surer  sign that Mukoki and Rod were still among the living, for why should  the Woongas employ this caution if they had already successfully  ambushed the hunters? With the chill of a cold hand at his throat the  answer flashed into Wabigoon's brain. His friends had been ambushed,  and these two Woongas were stealing back over the trail to slay him!
  Very slowly, very gently, the young Indian's finger pressed against  the trigger of his rifle. A dozen feet more, and then&#8212;
  The shadows had stopped, and now drew together as if in  consultation. They were not more than twenty yards away, and for a  moment Wabi lowered his rifle and listened hard. He could hear the low  unintelligible mutterings of their conversation. Then there came to him  a single incautious reply from one of the shadows.
  &#8220;All right!&#8221;
  Surely that was not the English of a Woonga! It sounded like&#8212;
  In a flash Wabi had called softly.
  &#8220;Ho, Muky&#8212;Muky&#8212;Rod!&#8221;
  In another moment the three wolf hunters were together, silently  wringing one another's hands, the death-like pallor of Rod's face and  the tense lines in the bronzed countenances of Mukoki and Wabigoon  plainly showing the tremendous strain they had been under.
  &#8220;You shoot?&#8221; whispered Mukoki.
  &#8220;No!&#8221; replied Wabi, his eyes widening in surprise. &#8220;Didn't<I> you</I>  shoot?&#8221;
  &#8220;No!&#8221;
  Only the one word fell from the old Indian, but it was filled with a  new warning. Who had fired the five shots? The hunters gazed blankly at  one another, mute questioning in their eyes. Without speaking, Mukoki  pointed suggestively to the clearer channel of the river beyond the  cedars. Evidently he thought the shots had come from there. Wabi shook  his head.
  &#8220;There was no trail,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Nobody has crossed the river.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought they were there!&#8221; breathed Rod. He pointed into the  forest. &#8220;But Mukoki said no.&#8221;
  For a long time the three stood and listened. Half a mile back in  the forest they heard the howl of a single wolf, and Wabi flashed a  curious glance into the eyes of the old Indian.
  &#8220;That's a man's cry,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;The wolf has struck a human  trail. It isn't mine!&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor ours,&#8221; replied Rod.
  This one long howl of the wolf was the only sound that broke the  stillness of approaching night. Mukoki turned, and the others followed  in his trail. A quarter of a mile farther on the stream became still  narrower and plunged between great masses of rock which rose into wild  and precipitous hills that were almost mountains a little way back. No  longer could the hunters now follow the channel of the rushing torrent.  Through a break in a gigantic wall of rock and huge boulders led the  trail of Rod and Mukoki. Ten minutes more and the three had clambered  to the top of the ridge where, in the lee of a great rock, the remains  of a fire were still burning. Here the old Indian and his companion had  struck camp and were waiting for Wabigoon when they heard the shots  which they, too, believed were those of an ambush.
  A comfortable shelter of balsam had already been erected against the  rock, and close beside the fire, where Mukoki had dropped it at the  sound of the shots, was a large piece of spitted venison. The situation  was ideal for a camp and after the hard day's tramp through the snow  the young wolf hunters regarded it with expressions of pleasure, in  spite of the enemies whom they knew might be lurking near them. Both  Wabi and Rod had accepted the place as their night's home, and were  stirring up the fire, when their attention was drawn to the singular  attitude of Mukoki. The old warrior stood leaning on his rifle,  speechless and motionless, his eyes regarding the process of rekindling  the fire with mute disapprobation. Wabi, poised on one knee, looked at  him questioningly.
  &#8220;No make more fire,&#8221; said the old Indian, shaking his head. &#8220;No dare  stay here. Go on&#8212;beyond mountain!&#8221;
  Mukoki straightened himself and stretched a long arm toward the  north.
  &#8220;River go like much devil 'long edge of mountain,&#8221; he continued.  &#8220;Make heap noise through rock, then make swamp thick for cow  moose&#8212;then run through mountain and make wide, smooth river once more.  We go over mountain. Snow all night. Morning come&#8212;no trail for Woonga.  We stay here&#8212;make big trail in morning. Woonga follow like devil, ver'  plain to see!&#8221;
  Wabi rose to his feet, his face showing the keenness of his  disappointment. Since early morning he had been traveling, even running  at times, and he was tired enough to risk willingly a few dangers for  the sake of sleep and supper. Rod was in even worse condition, though  his trail had been much shorter. For a few moments the two boys looked  at each other in silence, neither attempting to conceal the lack of  favor with which Mukoki's suggestion was received. But Wabi was too  wise openly to oppose the old pathfinder. If Mukoki said that it was  dangerous for them to remain where they were during the night&#8212;well, it  was dangerous, and it would be foolish of him to dispute it. He knew  Mukoki to be the greatest hunter of his tribe, a human bloodhound on  the trail, and what he said was law. So with a cheerful grin at Rod,  who needed all the encouragement that could be given to him, Wabi began  the readjustment of the pack which he had flung from his shoulders a  few minutes before.
  &#8220;Mountain not ver' far. Two&#8212;t'ree mile, then camp,&#8221; encouraged  Mukoki. &#8220;Walk slow&#8212;have big supper.&#8221;
  Only a few articles had been taken from the toboggan-sled on which  the hunters were dragging the greater part of their equipment into the  wilderness, and Mukoki soon had these packed again. The three  adventurers now took up the new trail along the top of one of those  wild and picturesque ridges which both the Indians and white hunters of  this great Northland call mountains. Wabigoon led, weighted under his  pack, selecting the clearest road for the toboggan and clipping down  obstructing saplings with his keen-edged belt-ax. A dozen feet behind  him followed Mukoki, dragging the sled; and behind the sled, securely  tied with a thong of babeesh, or moose-skin rope, slunk the wolf. Rod,  less experienced in making a trail and burdened with a lighter pack,  formed the rear of the little cavalcade.
  Darkness was now falling rapidly. Though Wabigoon was not more than  a dozen yards ahead, Rod could only now and then catch a fleeting  vision of him through the gloom. Mukoki, doubled over in his harness,  was hardly more than a blotch in the early night. Only the wolf was  near enough to offer companionship to the tired and down-spirited  youth. Rod's enthusiasm was not easily cooled, but just now he mentally  wished that, for this one night at least, he was back at the Post, with  the lovely little Minnetaki relating to him some legend of bird or  beast they had encountered that day. How much pleasanter that would be!  The vision of the bewitching little maiden was suddenly knocked out of  his head in a most unexpected and startling way. Mukoki had paused for  a moment and Rod, unconscious of the fact, continued on his journey  until he tumbled in a sprawling heap over the sled, knocking Mukoki's  legs completely from under him in his fall. When Wabi ran back he found  Rod flattened out, face downward, and Mukoki entangled in his site  harness on top of him.
  In a way this accident was fortunate. Wabi, who possessed a  Caucasian sense of humor, shook with merriment as he gave his  assistance, and Rod, after he had dug the snow from his eyes and ears  and had emptied a handful of it from his neck, joined with him.
  The ridge now became narrower as the trio advanced. On one side, far  down, could be heard the thunderous rush of the river, and from the  direction of the sound Rod knew they were near a precipice. Great beds  of boulders and broken rock, thrown there by some tumultuous upheaval  of past ages, now impeded their progress, and every step was taken with  extreme caution. The noise of the torrent became louder and louder as  they advanced and on one side of him Rod now thought that he could  distinguish a dim massive shadow towering above them, like the  precipitous side of a mountain. A few steps farther and Mukoki  exchanged places with Wabigoon.
  &#8220;Muky has been here before,&#8221; cried Wabi close up to Rod's ear. His  voice was almost drowned by the tumult below. &#8220;That's where the river  rushes through the mountain!&#8221;
  Rod forgot his fatigue in the new excitement. Never in his wildest  dreams of adventure had he foreseen an hour like this. Each step seemed  to bring them nearer the edge of the vast chasm through which the river  plunged, and yet not a sign of it could he see. He strained his eyes  and ears, each moment expecting to hear the warning voice of the old  warrior. With a suddenness that chilled him he saw the great shadow  close in upon them from the opposite side, and for the first time he  realized their position. On their left was the precipice&#8212;on their  right the sheer wall of the mountain! How wide was the ledge along  which they were traveling? His foot struck a stick under the snow.  Catching it up he flung it out into space. For a single instant he  paused to listen, but there came no sound of the falling object. The  precipice was very near&#8212;a little chill ran up his spine. It was a  sensation he had never experienced in walking the streets of a city!
  Though he could not see, he knew that the ledge was now leading them  up. He could hear Wabigoon straining ahead of the toboggan and he began  to assist by pushing on the rear of the loaded sled. For half an hour  this upward climb continued, until the sound of the river had entirely  died away. No longer was the mountain on the right. Five minutes later  Mukoki called a halt.
  &#8220;On top mountain,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;Camp here!&#8221;
  Rod could not repress an exclamation of joy, and Wabigoon, as he  threw off his harness, gave a suppressed whoop. Mukoki, who seemed  tireless, began an immediate search for a site for their camp and after  a short breathing-spell Rod and Wabi joined him. The spot chosen was in  the shelter of a huge rock, and while Mukoki cleaned away the snow the  young hunters set to work with their axes in a near growth of balsam,  cutting armful after armful of the soft odorous boughs. Inside of an  hour a comfortable camp was completed, with an exhilarating fire  throwing its crackling flames high up into the night before it.
  For the first time since leaving the abandoned camp at the other end  of the ridge the hunters fully realized how famished they were, and  Mukoki was at once delegated to prepare supper while Wabi and Rod  searched in the darkness for their night's supply of wood. Fortunately  quite near at hand they discovered several dead poplars, the best fuel  in the world for a camp-fire, and by the time the venison and coffee  were ready they had collected a huge pile of this, together with  several good-sized backlogs.
  Mukoki had spread the feast in the opening of the shelter where the  heat of the fire, reflected from the face of the rock, fell upon them  in genial warmth, suffusing their faces with a most comfortable glow.  The heat, together with the feast, were almost overpowering in their  effects, and hardly was his supper completed when Rod felt creeping  over him a drowsiness which he attempted in vain to fight off a little  longer. Dragging himself back in the shelter he wrapped himself in his  blanket, burrowed into the mass of balsam boughs, and passed quickly  into oblivion. His last intelligible vision was Mukoki piling logs upon  the fire, while the flames shot up a dozen feet into the air,  illumining to his drowsy eyes for an instant a wild chaos of rock,  beyond which lay the mysterious and impenetrable blackness of the  wilderness.
