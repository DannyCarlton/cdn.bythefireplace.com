The darkness had come early with the high rolling fog that shut out the  stars. The fog horn and the bells were silent but the wind had a thin  anxious note as if lost, and the long creaking eucalyptus trees angrily  repelled it as if irritated beyond endurance by its eternal visitations.    
Alexina, who had been reading in her bedroom, realized that it must be  quite half an hour since she had turned a page. She lifted her shoulders  impatiently. She was in no humor for reading.    
It was only eight o'clock. Far too early for bed. Mortimer had gone to Los  Angeles on business. He had been gone a week, and she admitted to herself  with the new frankness she had determined to cultivate--that she might  meet, with the clearest possible vision, whatever three-cornered deals  Life might have in store for her--that she had not missed him at all. His  absence had been a heavenly interlude. She and Aileen had gone to the  moving pictures unescorted every night (a performance of which he would  have disapproved profoundly), and they had lunched downtown every day until  Alexina had suddenly discovered that she had no more money in her purse;  and, knowing nothing whatever even of minor finance, was under the  impression that having given Mortimer her power of attorney she would not  be able to draw from the bank.    
Aileen had gone down to Burlingame to visit Sibyl Bascom for a few days.  Alexina had declined to go, although it was a quiet party; it would be  embarrassing not to tip the servants.    
The wind gave a long angry shriek as it flew round the corner of the house  and fastened its teeth in its enemies, the eucalyptus trees; who shook  it off with a loud furious rattle of their leaves and slapped the window  severely for good measure.    
Alexina was used to San Francisco in all her many moods, but to-night, the  wind and the high gray fog shutting out the stars, the silent house--silent  that is but for the mice playing innocently between the walls--her complete  solitude, made her restless and a little nervous.    
What could she do?    
She knew quite well that she had wanted to go to see Gora for a week. She  had not indulged in any silly dreams about Gathbroke but she was curious to  see his photograph. She remembered that it had crossed her mind that April  day under the oak tree that if he had been older, if he had outgrown his  hopelessly youthful curve of cheek, his fresh color, and the inability to  conceal the asinine condition to which she had immediately reduced him, she  might have given him an equal chance with Morty.    
Aileen had said that he looked older. She had a quite natural curiosity to  decide for herself if, had he been born several years earlier, he would  have proved the successful rival in that foundational period of their  youth....Or perhaps she was the reason of his rather sudden maturity.  After all there was no great chasm between twenty-three and twenty-six and  three-quarters. She looked little if any older. Neither did Morty, nor any  one she knew.    
This idea thrilled her, and, grimly determined upon no compromise or  evasion, she admitted it.    
Moreover, she wanted to sound out Gora.    
Somehow she had no real belief that he had transferred his affections to  her dissimilar sister-in-law, but her interest in Gora was growing. She  wanted to know her better.    
Besides, although she had often invited her to tea on her free afternoons,  and to dinner whenever possible, and had occasionally dropped in to see her  while she was still in the hospital, she had never called on her in her  home. As Gora only slept there after a killing day's or night's work,  visitors were anything but welcome; nevertheless she felt that she had been  negligent, rude--three years!--and as Gora was not on a case for a day or  two, now was the time to atone.    
Moreover, she had never been out quite alone at night, except to run down  the avenue and across the street to Aileen's. It was a long way down to  Geary Street, and Fillmore Street at night was "tough." Mortimer would be  furious.    
She hastily changed her dinner gown to a plain walking suit of black tweed  and pinned on a close hat firmly, prepared to defy the wind and thoroughly  to enjoy her little adventure. Not since she had stolen out to go to  forbidden parties with Aileen had she felt such a sense of altogether  reprehensible elation.
