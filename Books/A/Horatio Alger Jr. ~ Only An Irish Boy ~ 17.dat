  Colonel Preston, as I have already said, was a rich man. He owned no  real estate in the town of Crampton, except the house in which he  lived. His property was chiefly in stocks of different kinds. Included  in these was a considerable amount of stock in a woolen manufacturing  establishment, situated in Melville, some twelve miles distant.  Dividends upon these were paid semi-annually, on the first of April and  October. It was the custom of Colonel Preston at these dates to drive  over to Melville, receive his dividends, and then drive back again.
  Now, unfortunately for the welfare of the community, there are some  persons who, unwilling to make a living by honest industry, prefer to  possess themselves unlawfully of means to maintain their unprofitable  lives. Among them was a certain black-whiskered individual, who,  finding himself too well known in New York, had sought the country,  ready for any stroke of business which might offer in his particular  line. Chance led his steps to Melville, where he put up at the village  inn. He began at once to institute inquiries, the answers to which  might serve his purpose, and to avert suspicion, casually mentioned  that he was a capitalist, and thought of settling down in the town. As  he was well dressed, and had a plausible manner, this statement was not  doubted.
  Among other things, he made inquiries in regard to the manufactory,  what dividends it paid, and when. Expressing himself desirous of  purchasing some stock, he inquired the names of the principal owners of  the stock. First among them was mentioned Colonel Preston.
  &#8220;Perhaps he might sell some stocks,&#8221; suggested the landlord.
  &#8220;Where can I see him?&#8221; asked James Fairfax, for this was the name  assumed by the adventurer.
  &#8220;You can see him here,&#8221; answered the landlord, &#8220;in a day or two. He  will be here the first of the month to receive his dividends.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will he stop with you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably. He generally dines with me when he comes over.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you introduce me?&#8221;
  &#8220;With pleasure.&#8221;
  Mr. Fairfax appeared to hear this with satisfaction, and said that  he would make Colonel Preston an offer for a part of his stock.
  &#8220;Most of my property is invested in real estate in New York,&#8221; he  said; &#8220;but I should like to have some manufacturing stock; and, from  what you tell me, I think favorably of the Melville Mills.&#8221;
  &#8220;We should be glad to have you settle down among us,&#8221; said the  landlord.
  &#8220;I shall probably do so,&#8221; said Fairfax. &#8220;I am very much pleased with  your town and people.&#8221;
  In due time Colonel Preston drove over. As usual, he put up at the  hotel.
  &#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said the landlord, &#8220;there's a gentleman stopping with me  who desires an introduction to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Indeed! What is his name?&#8221;
  &#8220;James Fairfax.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is he from this neighborhood?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; from the city of New York.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be happy to make his acquaintance,&#8221; said the colonel,  courteously; &#8220;but it must be after I return from the mills. I shall be  there a couple of hours, probably. We are to have a directorial  meeting.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will tell him.&#8221;
  Colonel Preston attended the directors' meeting, and also collected  his dividend, amounting to eight hundred dollars. These, in eight  one-hundred-dollar bills, he put in his pocketbook, and returned to the  hotel for dinner.
  &#8220;Dinner is not quite ready, colonel,&#8221; said the landlord. &#8220;It will be  ready in fifteen minutes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where is the gentleman who wished to be introduced to me?&#8221; asked  Colonel Preston, who thought it would save time to be introduced now.
  &#8220;I will speak to him.&#8221;
  He went directly to a dark-complexioned man with black whiskers, and  eyes that were rather sinister in appearance. The eyes oftenest betray  the real character of a man, where all other signs fail. But Colonel  Preston was not a keen observer, nor was he skilled in physiognomy,  and, judging of Mr. Fairfax by his manner merely, was rather pleased  with him.
  &#8220;You will pardon my obtruding myself upon you, Colonel Preston,&#8221;  said the stranger, with great ease of manner.
  &#8220;I am happy to make your acquaintance, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am a stranger in this neighborhood. The city of New York is my  home. I have been led here by the recommendations of friends who knew  that I desired to locate myself in the country.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you like Melville?&#8221;
  &#8220;Very much&#8212;so much, that I may settle down here. But, Colonel  Preston, I am a man of business, and if I am to be here, I want some  local interest&#8212;some stake in the town itself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Quite natural, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are a business man yourself, and will understand me. Now, to  come to the point, I find you have a manufactory here&#8212;a woolen  manufactory, which I am given to understand is prosperous and  profitable.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are correctly informed, Mr. Fairfax. It is paying twelve per  cent. dividends, and has done so for several years.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is excellent. It is a better rate than I get for most of my  city investments.&#8221;
  &#8220;I also have city investments&#8212;bank stocks, and horse-railroad  stocks, but, as you say, my mill stock pays me better than the majority  of these.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are a large owner of the mill stock; are you not, Colonel  Preston?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir; the largest, I believe.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I am informed. Would you be willing to part with any of it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have never thought of doing so. I am afraid I could not replace  it with any other that would be satisfactory.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't blame you, of course, but it occurred to me that, having a  considerable amount, you might be willing to sell.&#8221;
  &#8220;I generally hold on to good stock when I get possession of it.  Indeed, I would buy more, if there were any in the market.&#8221;
  &#8220;He must have surplus funds,&#8221; thought the adventurer. &#8220;I must see if  I can't manage to get some into my possession.&#8221;
  Here the landlord appeared, and announced that dinner was ready.
  &#8220;You dine here, then?&#8221; said Fairfax.
  &#8220;Yes; it will take me two hours to reach home, so I am obliged to  dine here.&#8221;
  &#8220;We shall dine together, it seems. I am glad of it, as at present I  happen to be the only permanent guest at the hotel. May I ask where you  live?&#8221;
  &#8220;In Crampton.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have heard favorably of it, and have been intending to come over  and see the place, but the fact is, I am used only to the city, and  your country roads are so blind, that I have been afraid of losing my  way.&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't you ride over with me this afternoon, Mr. Fairfax? I can't  bring you back, but you are quite welcome to a seat in my chaise one  way.&#8221;
  The eyes of the adventurer sparkled at the invitation. Colonel  Preston had fallen into the trap he had laid for him, but he thought it  best not to accept too eagerly.
  &#8220;You are certainly very kind, Colonel Preston,&#8221; he answered, with  affected hesitation, &#8220;but I am afraid I shall be troubling you too  much.&#8221;
  &#8220;No trouble whatever,&#8221; said Colonel Preston, heartily. &#8220;It is a  lonely ride, and I shall be glad of a companion.&#8221;
  &#8220;A lonely ride, is it?&#8221; thought Fairfax. &#8220;All the better for my  purpose. It shall not be my fault if I do not come back with my pockets  well lined. The dividends you have just collected will be better in my  pockets than in yours.&#8221;
  This was what he thought, but he said:
  &#8220;Then I will accept with pleasure. I suppose I can easily engage  someone to bring me back to Melville?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes; we have a livery stable, where you can easily obtain a  horse and driver.&#8221;
  The dinner proceeded, and Fairfax made himself unusually social and  agreeable, so that Colonel Preston congratulated himself on the  prospect of beguiling the loneliness of the way in such pleasant  company. Fairfax spoke of stocks with such apparent knowledge that the  colonel imagined him to be a gentleman of large property. It is not  surprising that he was deceived, for the adventurer really understood  the subject of which he spoke, having been for several years a clerk in  a broker's counting-room in Wall Street. The loss of his situation was  occasioned by his abstraction of some securities, part of which he had  disposed of before he was detected. He was, in consequence, tried and  sentenced to three years' imprisonment. At the end of this period he  was released, with no further taste for an honest life, and had since  allied himself to the class who thrive by preying upon the community.
  This was the man whom Colonel Preston proposed to take as his  companion on his otherwise lonely ride home.
