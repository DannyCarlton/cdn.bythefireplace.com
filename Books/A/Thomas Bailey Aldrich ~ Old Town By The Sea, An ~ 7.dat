I doubt if any New England town ever turned out so many eccentric  characters as Portsmouth. From 1640 down to about 1848 there must  have been something in the air of the place that generated  eccentricity. In another chapter I shall explain why the  conditions have not been favorable to the development of  individual singularity during the latter half of the present  century. It is easier to do that than fully to account for the  numerous queer human types which have existed from time to time  previous to that period.    
In recently turning over the pages of Mr. Brewster's entertaining  collection of Portsmouth sketches, I have been struck by the  number and variety of the odd men and women who appear  incidentally on the scene. They are, in the author's intention,  secondary figures in the background of his landscape, but they  stand very much in the foreground of one's memory after the book  is laid aside. One finds one's self thinking quite as often of  that squalid old hut-dweller up by Sagamore Creek as of General  Washington, who visited the town in 1789. Conservatism and  respectability have their values, certainly; but has not the  unconventional its values also? If we render unto that old  hut-dweller the things which are that old hut-dweller's, we must  concede him his picturesqueness. He was dirty, and he was not  respectable; but he is picturesque--now that he is dead.    
If the reader has five or ten minutes to waste, I invite him to  glance at a few old profiles of persons who, however substantial  they once were, are now leading a life of mere outlines. I would  like to give them a less faded expression, but the past is very  chary of yielding up anything more than its shadows.    
The first who presents himself is the ruminative hermit already  mentioned--a species of uninspired Thoreau. His name was Benjamin  Lear. So far as his craziness went, he might have been a lineal  descendant of that ancient king of Britain who figures on  Shakespeare's page. Family dissensions made a recluse of King  Lear; but in the case of Benjamin there were no mitigating  circumstances. He had no family to trouble him, and his realm  remained undivided. He owned an excellent farm on the south side  of Sagamore Creek, a little to the west of the bridge, and might  have lived at ease, if personal comfort had not been distasteful  to him. Personal comfort entered into no part of Lear's. To be  alone filled the little pint-measure of his desire. He ensconced  himself in a wretched shanty, and barred the door, figuratively,  against all the world. Wealth--what would have been wealth to  him--lay within his reach, but he thrust it aside; he disdained  luxury as he disdained idleness, and made no compromise with  convention. When a man cuts himself absolutely adrift from  custom, what an astonishingly light spar floats him! How few his  wants are, after all! Lear was of a cheerful disposition, and  seems to have been wholly inoffensive--at a distance. He  fabricated his own clothes, and subsisted chiefly on milk and  potatoes, the product of his realm. He needed nothing but an  island to be a Robinson Crusoe. At rare intervals he flitted like  a frost-bitten apparition through the main street of Portsmouth,  which he always designated as "the Bank," a name that had become  obsolete fifty or a hundred years before. Thus, for nearly a  quarter of a century, Benjamin Lear stood aloof from human  intercourse. In his old age some of the neighbors offered him  shelter during the tempestuous winter months; but he would have  none of it--he defied wind and weather. There he lay in his  dilapidated hovel in his last illness, refusing to allow any one  to remain with him overnight--and the mercury four degrees below  zero. Lear was born in 1720, and vegetated eighty-two years.    
I take it that Timothy Winn, of whom we have only a glimpse,  would like to have more, was a person better worth knowing. His  name reads like the title of some old-fashioned novel--"Timothy  Winn, or the Memoirs of a Bashful Gentleman." He came to  Portsmouth from Woburn at the close of the last century, and set  up in the old museum-building on Mulberry Street what was called  "a piece goods store." He was the third Timothy in his monotonous  family, and in order to differentiate himself he inscribed on the  sign over his shop door, "Timothy Winn, 3d," and was ever after  called "Three-Penny Winn." That he enjoyed the pleasantry, and  clung to his sign, goes to show that he was a person who would  ripen on further acquaintance, were further acquaintance now  practicable. His next-door neighbor, Mr. Leonard Serat, who kept  a modest tailoring establishment, also tantalizes us a little  with a dim intimation of originality. He plainly was without  literary prejudices, for on one face of his swinging sign was  painted the word Taylor, and on the other Tailor. This may have  been a delicate concession to that part of the community--the  greater part, probably--which would have spelled it with a y.    
The building in which Messrs. Winn and Serat had their shops was  the property of Nicholas Rousselet, a French gentleman of  Demerara, the story of whose unconventional courtship of Miss  Catherine Moffatt is pretty enough to bear retelling, and  entitles him to a place in our limited collection of etchings. M.  Rousselet had doubtless already mad excursions into the pays de  tendre, and given Miss Catherine previous notice of the state of  his heart, but it was not until one day during the hour of  service at the Episcopal church that he brought matters to a  crisis by handing to Miss Moffatt a small Bible, on the fly-leaf  of which he had penciled the fifth verse of the Second Epistle of  John--    <blockquote>
 "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I   wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that   which we had from the beginning, that we love one another."</blockquote>    
This was not to be resisted, at lease not by Miss Catherine, who  demurely handed the volume back to him with a page turned down at  the sixteenth verse in the first chapter of Ruth--    <blockquote>
 "Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I  will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the  Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and  me."</blockquote>    
Aside from this quaint touch of romance, what attaches me to the  happy pair--for the marriage was a fortunate one--is the fact  that the Rousselets made their home in the old Atkinson mansion,  which stood directly opposite my grandfather's house on Court  Street and was torn down in my childhood, to my great  consternation. The building had been unoccupied for a quarter of  a century, and was fast falling into decay with all its rich  wood-carvings at cornice and lintel; but was it not full of  ghosts, and if the old barracks were demolished, would not these  ghosts, or some of them at least, take refuge in my grandfather's  house just across the way? Where else could they bestow  themselves so conveniently? While the ancient mansion was in  process of destruction, I used to peep round the corner of our  barn at the workmen, and watch the indignant phantoms go soaring  upward in spiral clouds of colonial dust.    
A lady differing in many ways from Catherine Moffatt was the Mary  Atkinson (once an inmate of this same manor house) who fell to  the lot of the Rev. William Shurtleff, pastor of the South Church  between 1733 and 1747. From the worldly standpoint, it was a fine  match for the Newcastle clergyman--beauty, of the eagle-beaked  kind; wealth, her share of the family plate; high birth, a sister  to the Hon. Theodore Atkinson. But if the exemplary man had cast  his eyes lower, peradventure he had found more happiness, though  ill-bred persons without family plate are not necessarily  amiable. Like Socrates, this long-suffering divine had always  with him an object on which to cultivate heavenly patience, and  patience, says the Eastern proverb, is the key to content. The  spirit of Xantippe seems to have taken possession of Mrs.  Shurtleff immediately after her marriage. The freakish disrespect  with which she used her meek consort was a heavy cross to bear at  a period in New England when clerical dignity was at its highest  sensitive point. Her devices for torturing the poor gentleman  were inexhaustible. Now she lets his Sabbath ruffs go unstarched;  now she scandalizes him by some unseemly and frivolous color in  her attire; now she leaves him to cook his own dinner at the  kitchen coals; and now she locks him in his study, whither he has  retired for a moment or two of prayer, previous to setting forth  to perform the morning service. The congregation has assembled;  the sexton has tolled the bell twice as long as is custom, and is  beginning a third carillon, full of wonder that his reverence  does not appear; and there sits Mistress Shurtleff in the family  pew with a face as complacent as that of the cat that has eaten  the canary. Presently the deacons appeal to her for information  touching the good doctor. Mistress Shurtleff sweetly tells them  that the good doctor was in his study when she left home. There  he is found, indeed, and released from durance, begging the  deacons to keep his mortification secret, to "give it an  understanding, but no tongue." Such was the discipline undergone  by the worthy Dr. Shurtleff on his earthly pilgrimage. A portrait  of this patient man--now a saint somewhere--hangs in the rooms of  the New England Historical and Genealogical Society in Boston.  There he can be seen in surplice and bands, with his lamblike,  apostolic face looking down upon the heavy antiquarian labors of  his busy descendants.    
Whether or not a man is to be classed as eccentric who vanishes  without rhyme or reason on his wedding-night is a query left to  the reader's decision. We seem to have struck a matrimonial vein,  and must work it out. In 1768, Mr. James McDonough was one of the  wealthiest men in Portsmouth, and the fortunate suitor for the  hand of a daughter of Jacob Sheafe, a town magnate. The home of  the bride was decked and lighted for the nuptials, the  banquet-table was spread, and the guests were gathered. The  minister in his robe stood by the carven mantelpiece, book in  hand, and waited. Then followed an awkward interval--there was a  hitch somewhere. A strange silence fell upon the laughing groups;  the air grew tense with expectation; in the pantry, Amos Boggs,  the butler, in his agitation split a bottle of port over his new  cinnamon-colored small-clothes. Then a whisper--a whisper  suppressed these twenty minutes--ran through the  apartments,--"The bridegroom has not come!". He never came. The  mystery of that night remains a mystery after the lapse of a  century and a quarter.    
What had become of James McDonough? The assassination of so  notable a person in a community where every strange face was  challenged, where every man's antecedents were known, could not  have been accomplished without leaving some slight traces. Not a  shadow of foul play was discovered. That McDonough had been  murdered or had committed suicide were theories accepted at first  by a few, and then by no one. On the other hand, he was in love  with his fiancee, he had wealth, power, position--why had he  fled? He was seen a moment on the public street, and then never  seen again. It was as if he turned into air. Meanwhile the  bewilderment of the bride was dramatically painful. If McDonough  had been waylaid and killed, she could mourn for him. If he had  deserted her, she could wrap herself in her pride. But neither  course lay open to her, then or afterward. In one of the Twice  Told Tales Hawthorne deals with a man named Wakefield, who  disappears with like suddenness, and lives unrecognized for  twenty years in a street not far from his abandoned hearthside.  Such expunging of one's self was not possible in Portsmouth; but  I never think of McDonough without recalling Wakefield. I have an  inexplicable conviction that for many a year James McDonough, in  some snug ambush, studied and analyzed the effect of his own  startling disappearance.    
Some time in the year 1758, there dawned upon Portsmouth a  personage bearing the ponderous title of King's Attorney, and  carrying much gold lace about him. This gilded gentleman was Mr.  Wyseman Clagett, of Bristol, England, where his father dwelt on  the manor of Broad Oaks, in a mansion with twelve chimneys, and  kept a coach and eight or ten servants. Up to the moment of his  advent in the colonies, Mr. Wyseman Clagett had evidently not  been able to keep anything but himself. His wealth consisted of  his personal decorations, the golden frogs on his lapels, and the  tinsel at his throat; other charms he had none. Yet with these he  contrived to dazzle the eyes of Lettice Mitchel, one of the young  beauties of the province, and to cause her to forget that she had  plighted troth with a Mr. Warner, then in Europe, and destined to  return home with a disturbed heart. Mr. Clagett was a man of  violent temper and ingenious vindictiveness, and proved more than  a sufficient punishment for Lettice's infidelity. The trifling  fact that Warner was dead--he died shortly after his return--did  not interfere with the course of Mr. Clagett's jealousy; he was  haunted by the suspicion that Lettice regretted her first love,  having left nothing undone to make her do so. "This is to pay  Warner's debts," remarked Mr. Clagett, as he twitched off the  table-cloth and wrecked the tea-things.    
In his official capacity he was a relentless prosecutor. The noun  Clagett speedily turned itself into a verb; "to Clagett" meant  "to prosecute;" they were convertible terms. In spite of his  industrious severity, and his royal emoluments, if such existed,  the exchequer of the King's Attorney showed a perpetual deficit.  The stratagems to which he resorted from time to time in order to  raise unimportant sums reminded one of certain scenes in  Moliere's comedies.    
Mr. Clagett had for his ame damnee a constable of the town. They  were made for each other; they were two flowers with but a single  stem, and this was their method of procedure: Mr. Clagett  dispatched one of his servants to pick a quarrel with some  countryman on the street, or some sailor drinking at an inn: the  constable arrested the sailor or the countryman, as the case  might be, and hauled the culprit before Mr. Clagett; Mr. Clagett  read the culprit a moral lesson, and fined him five dollars and  costs. The plunder was then divided between the conspirators--two  hearts that beat as one--Clagett, of course, getting the lion's  share. Justice was never administered in a simpler manner in any  country. This eminent legal light was extinguished in 1784, and  the wick laid away in the little churchyard in Litchfield, New  Hampshire. It is a satisfaction, even after such a lapse of time,  to know that Lettice survived the King's Attorney sufficiently  long to be very happy with somebody else. Lettice Mitchel was  scarcely eighteen when she married Wyseman Clagett.    
About eighty years ago, a witless fellow named Tilton seems to  have been a familiar figure on the streets of the old town. Mr.  Brewster speaks of him as "the well-known idiot, Johnny Tilton,"  as if one should say, "the well-known statesman, Daniel Webster."  It is curious to observe how any sort of individuality gets  magnified in this parochial atmosphere, where everything lacks  perspective, and nothing is trivial. Johnny Tilton does not  appear to have had much individuality to start with; it was only  after his head was cracked that he showed any shrewdness  whatever. That happened early in his unobtrusive boyhood. He had  frequently watched the hens flying out of the loft window in his  father's stable, which stood in the rear of the Old Bell Tavern.  It occurred to Johnny, one day, that though he might not be as  bright as other lads, he certainly was in no respect inferior to  a hen. So he placed himself on the sill of the window in the  loft, flapped his arms, and took flight. The New England Icarus  alighted head downward, lay insensible for a while, and was  henceforth looked upon as a mortal who had lost his wits. Yet at  odd moments his cloudiness was illumined by a gleam of  intelligence such as had not been detected in him previous to his  mischance. As Polonius said of Hamlet--another unstrung  mortal--Tilton's replies had "a happiness that often madness hits  on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be  delivered of." One morning, he appeared at the flour-mill with a  sack of corn to be ground for the almshouse, and was asked what  he knew. "Some things I know," replied poor Tilton, "and some  things I don't know. I know the miller's hogs grow fat, but I  don't know whose corn they fat on." To borrow another word from  Polonius, though this be madness, yet there was method in it.  Tilton finally brought up in the almshouse, where he was allowed  the liberty of roaming at will through the town. He loved the  water-side as if he had had all his senses. Often he was seen to  stand for hours with a sunny, torpid smile on his lips, gazing  out upon the river where its azure ruffles itself into silver  against the islands. He always wore stuck in his hat a few hen's  feathers, perhaps with some vague idea of still associating  himself with the birds of the air, if hens can come into that  category.    
George Jaffrey, third of the name, was a character of another  complexion, a gentleman born, a graduate of Harvard in 1730, and  one of His Majesty's Council in 1766--a man with the blood of the  lion and the unicorn in every vein. He remained to the bitter  end, and beyond, a devout royalist, prizing his shoe-buckles, not  because they were of chased silver, but because they bore the  tower mark and crown stamp. He stoutly objected to oral prayer,  on the ground that it gave rogues and hypocrites an opportunity  to impose on honest folk. He was punctilious in his attendance at  church, and unfailing in his responses, though not of a  particularly devotional temperament. On one occasion, at least,  his sincerity is not to be questioned. He had been deeply  irritated by some encroachments on the boundaries of certain  estates, and had gone to church that forenoon with his mind full  of the matter. When the minister in the course of reading the  service came to the apostrophe, "Cursed be he who removeth his  neighbor's landmark," Mr. Jeffrey's feelings were too many for  him, and he cried out "Amen!" in a tone of voice that brought  smiles to the adjoining pews.    
Mr. Jaffrey's last will and testament was a whimsical document,  in spite of the Hon. Jeremiah Mason, who drew up the paper. It  had originally been Mr. Jaffrey's plan to leave his possessions  to his beloved friend, Colonel Joshua Wentworth; but the colonel  by some maladroitness managed to turn the current of Pactolus in  another direction. The vast property was bequeathed to George  Jaffrey Jeffries, the testator's grandnephew, on condition that  the heir, then a lad of thirteen, should drop the name of  Jeffries, reside permanently in Portsmouth, and adopt no  profession excepting that of gentleman. There is an immense  amount of Portsmouth as well as George Jaffrey in that final  clause. George the fourth handsomely complied with the  requirements, and dying at the age of sixty-six, without issue or  assets, was the last of that particular line of Georges. I say  that he handsomely complied with the requirements of the will;  but my statement appears to be subject to qualification, for on  the day of his obsequies it was remarked of him by a caustic  contemporary: "Well, yes, Mr. Jaffrey was a gentleman by  profession, but not eminent in his profession."    
This modest exhibition of profiles, in which I have attempted to  preserve no chronological sequence, ends with the silhouette of  Dr. Joseph Moses.    
If Boston in the colonial days had her Mather Byles, Portsmouth  had her Dr. Joseph Moses. In their quality as humorists, the  outlines of both these gentlemen have become rather broken and  indistinct. "A jest's prosperity lies in the ear that hears it."  Decanted wit inevitably loses its bouquet. A clever repartee  belongs to the precious moment in which it is broached, and is of  a vintage that does not usually bear transportation. Dr.  Moses--he received his diploma not from the College of  Physicians, but from the circumstance of his having once drugged  his private demijohn of rum, and so nailed an inquisitive negro  named Sambo--Dr. Moses, as he was always called, had been handed  down to us by tradition as a fellow of infinite jest and of most  excellent fancy; but I must confess that I find his high spirits  very much evaporated. His humor expended itself, for the greater  part, in practical pleasantries--like that practiced on the  minion Sambo--but these diversions, however facetious to the  parties concerned, lack magnetism for outsiders. I discover  nothing about him so amusing as the fact that he lived in a  tan-colored little tenement, which was neither clapboarded nor  shingled, and finally got an epidermis from the discarded  shingles of the Old South Church when the roof of that edifice  was repaired.    
Dr. Moses, like many persons of his time and class, was a man of  protean employment--joiner, barber, and what not. No doubt he had  much pithy and fluent conversation, all of which escapes us. He  certainly impressed the Hon. Theodore Atkinson as a person of  uncommon parts, for the Honorable Secretary of the Province, like  a second Haroun Al Raschid, often summoned the barber to  entertain him with his company. One evening--and this is the only  reproducible instance of the doctor's readiness--Mr. Atkinson  regaled his guest with a diminutive glass of choice Madeira. The  doctor regarded it against the light with the half-closed eye of  the connoisseur, and after sipping the molten topaz with  satisfaction, inquired how old it was. "Of the vintage of about  sixty years ago," was the answer. "Well," said the doctor  reflectively, "I never in my life saw so small a thing of such an  age." There are other mots of his on record, but their faces are  suspiciously familiar. In fact, all the witty things were said  aeons ago. If one nowadays perpetrates an original joke, one  immediately afterward finds it in the Sanskirt. I am afraid that  Dr. Joseph Moses has no very solid claims on us. I have given him  place here because he has long had the reputation of a wit, which  is almost as good as to be one.
