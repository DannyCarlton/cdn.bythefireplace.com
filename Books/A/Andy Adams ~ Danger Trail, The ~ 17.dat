  For many minutes Howland stood waiting as if life had left him. His  eyes were on the door, but unseeing. He made no sound, no movement  again toward the aperture in the wall. Fate had dealt him the final  blow, and when at last he roused himself from its first terrible effect  there remained no glimmering of hope in his breast, no thought of the  battle he had been making for freedom a short time before. The note  fluttered from his fingers and he drew his watch from his pocket and  placed it on the table. It was a quarter after five. There still  remained forty-five minutes.
  Three-quarters of an hour and then&#8212;death. There was no doubt in his  mind this time. Ever in the coyote, with eternity staring him in the  face, he had hoped and fought for life. But here there was no hope,  there was to be no fighting. Through one of the black holes in the wall  he was to be shot down, with no chance to defend himself, to prove  himself innocent. And Meleese&#8212;did she, too, believe him guilty of that  crime?
  He groaned aloud, and picked up the note again. Softly he repeated  her last words to him: &#8220;If God fails to answer my prayers I will still  do as I have promised, and follow you.&#8221; Those words seemed to cry aloud  his doom. Even Meleese had given up hope. And yet, was there not a  deeper significance in her words? He started as if some one had struck  him, his eyes agleam.
  &#8220;'I will follow you.'&#8220;
  He almost sobbed the words this time. His hands trembled and he  dropped the paper again on the table and turned his eyes in staring  horror toward the door. What did she mean? Would Meleese kill herself  if he was murdered by her brothers? He could see no other meaning in  her last message to him, and for a time after the chilling significance  of her words struck his heart he scarce restrained himself from calling  aloud for Jean. If he could but send a word back to her, tell her once  more of his great love&#8212;that the winning of that love was ample reward  for all that he had lost and was about to lose, and that it gave him  such happiness as he had never known even in this last hour of his  torture!
  Twice he shouted for Croisset, but there came no response save the  hollow echoings of his own voice in the subterranean chambers. After  that he began to think more sanely. If Meleese was a prisoner in her  room it was probable that Croisset, who was now fully recognized as a  traitor at the post, could no longer gain access to her. In some secret  way Meleese had contrived to give him the note, and he had performed  his last mission for her.
  In Howland's breast there grew slowly a feeling of sympathy for the  Frenchman. Much that he had not understood was clear to him now. He  understood why Meleese had not revealed the names of his assailants at  Prince Albert and Wekusko, he understood why she had fled from him  after his abduction, and why Jean had so faithfully kept secrecy for  her sake. She had fought to save him from her own flesh and blood, and  Jean had fought to save him, and in these last minutes of his life he  would liked to have had Croisset with him that he might have taken has  hand and thanked him for what he had done. And because he had fought  for him and Meleese the Frenchman's fate was to be almost as terrible  as his own. It was he who would fire the fatal shot at six o'clock. Not  the brothers, but Jean Croisset, would be his executioner and murderer.
  The minutes passed swiftly, and as they went Howland was astonished  to find how coolly he awaited the end. He even began to debate with  himself as to through which hole the fatal shot would be fired. No  matter where he stood he was in the light of the big hanging lamp.  There was no obscure or shadowy corner in which for a few moments he  might elude his executioner. He even smiled when the thought occurred  to him that it was possible to extinguish the light and crawl under the  table, thus gaining a momentary delay. But what would that delay avail  him? He was anxious for the fatal minute to arrive, and be over.
  There were moments of happiness when in the damp horror of his  death-chamber there came before him visions of Meleese, grown even  sweeter and more lovable, now that he knew how she had sacrificed  herself between two great loves&#8212;the love of her own people and the  love of himself. And at last she had surrendered to him. Was it  possible that she could have made that surrender if she, like her  brothers, believed him to be the murderer of her father&#8212;the son of the  man-fiend who had robbed her of a mother? It was impossible, he told  himself. She did not believe him guilty. And yet&#8212;why had she not given  him some such word in her last message to him?
  His eyes traveled to the note on the table and he began searching in  his coat pockets. In one of them he found the worn stub of a pencil,  and for many minutes after that he was oblivious to the passing of time  as he wrote his last words to Meleese. When he had finished he folded  the paper and placed it under his watch. At the final moment, before  the shot was fired, he would ask Jean to take it. His eyes fell on his  watch dial and a cry burst from his lips.
  It lacked but ten minutes of the final hour!
  Above him he heard faintly the sharp barking of dogs, the hollow  sound of men's voices. A moment later there came to him an echo as of  swiftly tramping feet, and after that silence.
  &#8220;Jean,&#8221; he called tensely. &#8220;Ho, Jean&#8212;Jean Croisset&#8212;&#8221;
  He caught up the paper and ran from one black opening to another,  calling the Frenchman's name.
  &#8220;As you love your God, Jean, as you have a hope of Heaven, take this  note to Meleese!&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Jean&#8212;Jean Croisset&#8212;&#8221;
  There came no answer, no movement outside, and Howland stilled the  beating of his heart to listen. Surely Croisset was there! He looked  again at the watch he held in his hand. In four minutes the shot would  be fired. A cold sweat bathed his face. He tried to cry out again, but  something rose in his throat and choked him until his voice was only a  gasp. He sprang back to the table and placed the note once more under  the watch. Two minutes! One and a half! One!
  With a sudden fearless cry he sprang into the very center of his  prison, and flung out his arms with his face to the hole next the door.  This time his voice was almost a shout.
  &#8220;Jean Croisset, there is a note under my watch on the table. After  you have killed me take it to Meleese. If you fail I shall haunt you to  your grave!&#8221;
  Still no sound&#8212;no gleam of steel pointing at aim through the black  aperture. Would the shot come from behind?
  Tick&#8212;tick&#8212;tick&#8212;tick&#8212;
  He counted the beating of his watch up to twenty. A sound stopped  him then, and he closed his eyes, and a great shiver passed through his  body.
  It was the tiny bell of his watch tinkling off the hour of six!
  Scarcely had that sound ceased to ring in his brain when from far  through the darkness beyond the wall of his prison there came a  creaking noise, as if a heavy door had been swung slowly on its hinges,  or a trap opened&#8212;then voices, low, quick, excited voices, the hurrying  tread of feet, a flash of light shooting through the gloom. They were  coming! After all it was not to be a private affair, and Jean was to do  his killing as the hangman's job is done in civilization&#8212;before a  crowd. Howland's arms dropped to his side. This was more terrible than  the other&#8212;this seeing and hearing of preparation, in which he fancied  that he heard the click of Croisset's gun as he lifted the hammer.
  Instead it was a hand fumbling at the door. There were no voices  now, only a strange moaning sound that he could not account for. In  another moment it was made clear to him. The door swung open, and the  white-robed figure of Meleese sprang toward him with a cry that echoed  through the dungeon chambers. What happened then&#8212;the passing of white  faces beyond the doorway, the subdued murmur of voices, were all lost  to Howland in the knowledge that at the last moment they had let her  come to him, that he held her in his arms, and that she was crushing  her face to his breast and sobbing things to him which he could not  understand. Once or twice in his life he had wondered if realities  might not be dreams, and the thought came to him now when he felt the  warmth of her hands, her face, her hair, and then the passionate  pressure of her lips on his own. He lifted his eyes, and in the doorway  he saw Jean Croisset, and behind him a wild, bearded face&#8212;the face  that had been over him when life was almost choked from him on the  Great North Trail. And beyond these two he saw still others, shining  ghostly and indistinct in the deeper gloom of the outer darkness. He  strained Meleese to him, and when he looked down into her face he saw  her beautiful eyes flooded with tears, and yet shining with a great  joy. Her lips trembled as she struggled to speak. Then suddenly she  broke from his arms and ran to the door, and Jean Croisset came between  them, with the wild bearded man still staring over his shoulder.
  &#8220;M'seur, will you come with us?&#8221; said Jean.
  The bearded man dropped back into the thick gloom, and without  speaking Howland followed Croisset, his eyes on the shadowy form of  Meleese. The ghostly faces turned from the light, and the tread of  their retreating feet marked the passage through the blackness. Jean  fell back beside Howland, the huge bulk of the bearded man three paces  ahead. A dozen steps more and they came to a stair down which a light  shone. The Frenchman's hand fell detainingly on Howland's arm, and when  a moment later they reached the top of the stairs all had disappeared  but Jean and the bearded man. Dawn was breaking, and a pale light fell  through the two windows of the room they had entered. On a table burned  a lamp, and near the table were several chairs. To one of these  Croisset motioned the engineer, and as Howland sat down the bearded man  turned slowly and passed through a door. Jean shrugged his shoulders as  the other disappeared.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, that means that he leaves it all to me,&#8221; he  exclaimed. &#8220;I don't wonder that it is hard for him to talk, M'seur.  Perhaps you have begun to understand!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, a little,&#8221; replied Howland. His heart was throbbing as if he  had just finished climbing a long hill. &#8220;That was the man who tried to  kill me. But Meleese&#8212;the&#8212;&#8221; He could go no further. Scarce breathing,  he waited for Jean to speak.
  &#8220;It is Pierre Thoreau,&#8221; he said, &#8220;eldest brother to Meleese. It is  he who should say what I am about to tell you, M'seur. But he is too  full of grief to speak. You wonder at that? And yet I tell you that a  man with a better soul than Pierre Thoreau never lived, though three  times he has tried to kill you. Do you remember what you asked me a  short time ago, M'seur&#8212;if I thought that<I> you</I> were the John  Howland who murdered the father of Meleese sixteen years ago? God's  saints, and I did until hardly more than half an hour ago, when some  one came from the South and exploded a mine under our feet. It was the  youngest of the three brothers. M'seur we have made a great mistake,  and we ask your forgiveness.&#8221;
  In the silence the eyes of the two men met across the table. To  Howland it was not the thought that his life was saved that came with  the greatest force, but the thought of Meleese, the knowledge that in  that hour when all seemed to be lost she was nearer to him than ever.  He leaned half over the table, his hands clenched, his eyes blazing.  Jean did not understand, for he went on quickly.
  &#8220;I know it is hard, M'seur. Perhaps it will be impossible for you to  forgive a thing like this. We have tried to kill you&#8212;kill you by a  slow torture, as we thought you deserved. But think for a moment,  M'seur, of what happened up here sixteen years ago this winter. I have  told you how I choked life from the man-fiend. So I would have choked  life from you if it had not been for Meleese. I, too, am guilty. Only  six years ago we knew that the right John Howland&#8212;the son of the man I  slew&#8212;was in Montreal, and we sent to seek him this youngest brother,  for he had been a long time at school with Meleese and knew the ways of  the South better than the others. But he failed to find him at that  time, and it was only a short while ago that this brother located you.
  &#8220;As Our Blessed Lady is my witness, M'seur, it is not strange that  he should have taken you for the man we sought, for it is singular that  you bear him out like a brother in looks, as I remember the boy. It is  true that Francois made a great error when he sent word to his brothers  suggesting that if either Gregson or Thorne was put out of the way you  would probably be sent into the North. I swear by the Virgin that  Meleese knew nothing of this, M'seur. She knew nothing of the schemes  by which her brothers drove Gregson and Thorne back into the South.  They did not wish to kill them, and yet it was necessary to do  something that you might replace one of them, M'seur. They did not make  a move alone but that something happened. Gregson lost a finger. Thorne  was badly hurt&#8212;as you know. Bullets came through their window at  night. With Jackpine in their employ it was easy to work on them, and  it was not long before they sent down asking for another man to replace  them.&#8221;
  For the first time a surge of anger swept through Howland.
  &#8220;The cowards!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;A pretty pair, Croisset&#8212;to crawl out  from under a trap to let another in at the top!&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps not so bad as that,&#8221; said Jean. &#8220;They were given to  understand that they&#8212;and they alone&#8212;were not wanted in the country.  It may be that they did not think harm would come to you, and so kept  quiet about what had happened. It may be, too, that they did not like  to have it known that they were running away from danger. Is not that  human, M'seur? Anyway, you were detailed to come, and not until then  did Meleese know of all that had occurred.&#8221;
  The Frenchman stopped for a moment. The glare had faded from  Howland's eyes. The tense lines in his face relaxed.
  &#8220;I&#8212;I&#8212;believe I understand everything now, Jean,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You  traced the wrong John Howland, that's all. I love Meleese, Jean. I  would kill John Howland for her. I want to meet her brothers and shake  their hands. I don't blame them. They're men. But, somehow, it hurts to  think of her&#8212;of Meleese&#8212;as&#8212;as almost a murderer.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, M'seur, has she not saved your life! Listen to  this! It was then&#8212;when she knew what had happened&#8212;that Meleese came  to me&#8212;whom she had made the happiest man in the world because it was  she who brought my Mariane over from Churchill on a visit especially  that I might see her and fall in love with her, M'seur&#8212;which I did.  Meleese came to me&#8212;to Jean Croisset&#8212;and instead of planning your  murder, M'seur, she schemed to save your life&#8212;with me&#8212;who would have  cut you into bits no larger than my finger and fed you to the carrion  ravens, who would have choked the life out of you until your eyes  bulged in death, as I choked that one up on the Great Slave! Do you  understand, M'seur? It was Meleese who came and pleaded with me to save  your life&#8212;before you had left Chicago, before she had heard more of  you than your name, before&#8212;&#8221;
  Croisset hesitated, and stopped.
  &#8220;Before what, Jean?&#8221;
  &#8220;Before she had learned to love you, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;God bless her!&#8221; exclaimed Howland.
  &#8220;You believe this, M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;As I believe in a God.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will tell you what she did, M'seur,&#8221; he continued in a low  voice. &#8220;The plan of the brothers was to make you a prisoner near Prince  Albert and bring you north. I knew what was to happen then. It was to  be a beautiful vengeance, M'seur&#8212;a slow torturing death on the spot  where the crime was committed sixteen years ago. But Meleese knew  nothing of this. She was made to believe that up here, where the mother  and father died, you would be given over to the proper law&#8212;to the  mounted police who come this way now and then. She is only a girl,  M'seur, easily made to believe strange things in such matters as these,  else she would have wondered why you were not given to the officers in  Prince Albert. It was the eldest brother who thought of her as a lure  to bring you out of the town into their hands, and not until the last  moment, when they were ready to leave for the South, did she overhear  words that aroused her suspicions that they were about to kill you. It  was then, M'seur, that she came to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you, Jean?&#8221;
  &#8220;On the day that Mariane promised to become my wife, M'seur, I  promised in Our Blessed Lady's name to repay my debt to Meleese, and  the manner of payment came in this fashion. Jackpine, too, was her  slave, and so we worked together. Two hours after Meleese and her  brothers had left for the South I was following them, shaven of beard  and so changed that I was not recognized in the fight on the Great  North Trail. Meleese thought that her brothers would make you a  prisoner that night without harming you. Her brothers told her how to  bring you to their camp. She knew nothing of the ambush until they  leaped on you from cover. Not until after the fight, when in their rage  at your escape the brothers told her that they had intended to kill  you, did she realize fully what she had done. That is all, M'seur. You  know what happened after that. She dared not tell you at Wekusko who  your enemies were, for those enemies were of her own flesh and blood,  and dearer to her than life. She was between two great loves,  M'seur&#8212;the love for her brothers and&#8212;&#8221;
  Again Jean hesitated.
  &#8220;And her love for me,&#8221; finished Howland.
  &#8220;Yes, her love for you, M'seur.&#8221;
  The two men rose from the table, and for a moment stood with clasped  hands in the smoky light of lamp and dawn. In that moment neither heard  a tap at the door leading to the room beyond, nor saw the door move  gently inward, and Meleese, hesitating, framed in the opening.
  It was Howland who spoke first.
  &#8220;I thank God that all these things have happened, Jean,&#8221; he said  earnestly. &#8220;I am glad that for a time you took me for that other John  Howland, and that Pierre Thoreau and his brothers schemed to kill me at  Prince Albert and Wekusko, for if these things had not occurred as they  have I would never have seen Meleese. And now, Jean&#8212;&#8221;
  His ears caught sound of movement, and he turned in time to see  Meleese slipping quietly out.
  &#8220;Meleese!&#8221; he called softly. &#8220;Meleese!&#8221;
  In an instant he had darted after her, leaving Jean beside the  table. Beyond the door there was only the breaking gloom of the gray  mornings but it was enough for him to see faintly the figure of the  girl he loved, half turned, half waiting for him. With a cry of joy he  sprang forward and gathered her close in his arms.
  &#8220;Meleese&#8212;my Meleese&#8212;&#8221; he whispered.
  After that there came no sound from the dawn-lit room beyond, but  Jean Croisset, still standing by the table, murmured softly to himself:  &#8220;Our Blessed Lady be praised, for it is all as Jean Croisset would have  it&#8212;and now I can go to my Mariane!&#8221;
