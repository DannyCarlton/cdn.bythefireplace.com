  Herbert worked steadily every forenoon on his farm. Cameron then   proposed that they should take the forenoon for their studies and walk   out or exercise in some other way in the afternoon. 
  One afternoon Cameron said: &#8220;Let us take a walk to Prospect Pond; I   think I should enjoy a little rowing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I will accompany you with pleasure, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said Herbert,  &#8220;but  don't ask me to go out in the boat with you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why not? Are you afraid I will upset you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No,&#8221; answered Herbert; &#8220;I have confidence in your skill. Besides,  I  can swim.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is your objection, then?&#8221; &#8220;If the boat belonged to anyone but   James Leech I would not mind.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why should you mind that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I met him last evening and he told me not to get into his boat  again.  He said he was perfectly willing you should use it, but he  didn't  choose to have me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It appears that I am a greater favorite with James Leech than you   are,&#8221; said Cameron, smiling. 
  &#8220;He looks down upon me as a poor boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, I suppose James is entitled to his prejudice; but if you  can't  use the boat, I won't.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't let that interfere with your pleasure, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said   Herbert, eagerly. &#8220;I don't trouble myself in the least about the way   James treats me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Let us go down to the pond, at any rate. We can sit down on the  bank,  if nothing better.&#8221; &#8220;All right.&#8221; 
  An easy walk brought them to the edge of the pond. Herbert  naturally  looked for James Leech's boat. He thought something was the  matter  with his eyes, for where there should be but one boat there  were now  two. 
  &#8220;Why, there's another boat!&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  &#8220;Is there?&#8221; asked Cameron, indifferently. 
  &#8220;Yes, don't you see it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, it does look like a boat, I admit. I should say it was nicer   than the other.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should say it was. Isn't she a regular beauty?&#8221; exclaimed  Herbert,  enthusiastically. &#8220;I wonder whose it is? James wouldn't want  two.&#8221; 
  There was a smile on Cameron's face that attracted Herbert's   attention. 
  &#8220;Is it yours?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;No; I know who owns it, though.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It isn't the landlord, is it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then I can't imagine whose it is,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Can't you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Will you tell me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is yours!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mine!&#8221; exclaimed our hero, in the utmost surprise, 
  &#8220;Yes; I intended at first not to give it to you till I went away;  but  I may as well give it now, on one condition&#8212;that you let me use  it  whenever I please.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How kind you are!&#8221; said Herbert, gratefully. &#8220;I never received  such a  splendid present in my life. I have done nothing to deserve  it,&#8221; 
  &#8220;Let me be the judge of that. Now, with your consent, we will try   her.&#8221; 
  With the utmost alacrity Herbert followed Cameron aboard the new   craft, and took the oars. Smoothly and easily the boat glided off on   the surface of the pond. 
  &#8220;I like it much better than James',&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;It's a better model. His is rather clumsy. Besides, this is new  and  he must have had his for some time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He has had it three years.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It needs painting.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Even if it were painted it wouldn't come up to this.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; said Cameron. &#8220;I am afraid James will be  stirred  with envy when he sees your boat.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am afraid so, too. He won't believe it is mine.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It may be your duty, out of a delicate regard to his feelings, to   give it up, or exchange,&#8221; suggested Cameron. 
  &#8220;That's a little further than I carry my delicate regard to his   feelings,&#8221; responded Herbert. 
  After half an hour's rowing, Cameron said, suddenly: &#8220;I must go  back  to the hotel. I came near forgetting an important letter, which  must  be sent off by this afternoon's mail.&#8221; 
  Herbert was a little disappointed, still he said, cheerfully: &#8220;All   right, Mr. Cameron.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't you cease your rowing,&#8221; said the collegian. 
  &#8220;I thought you might not like to walk back alone.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't mind that. I shall hurry back, and should be poor company.  We  will meet to-morrow morning.&#8221; 
  Cameron set out on his return home. He had gone less than quarter  of a  mile when he met James Leech. 
  &#8220;Good afternoon, Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said James, who was always polite to   the rich manufacturer's son. 
  &#8220;Good afternoon, James.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Won't you go out in my boat, Mr. Cameron?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you, I have just returned from the pond. I am obliged to go   back to the hotel to write a letter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should have been glad of your company.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You won't be alone,&#8221; said Cameron, mischievously. &#8220;I left Herbert   Carter at the pond.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Was he out in the boat?&#8221; asked James, hastily. 
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; 
  Without a word James walked abruptly away. He was very angry with   Herbert, who, he naturally concluded, was out in his boat. 
  &#8220;He's the most impudent and cheeky boy I ever met!&#8221; he said to   himself. &#8220;Last evening, I positively forbade his getting into my boat   and he don't take the slightest notice of it. He needn't think he can   take such liberties.&#8221; 
  Cameron smiled, as he read James' feelings in his face. 
  Just before reaching the pond there was rising ground, from which   James could take a general survey of the lake. Herbert was cruising   about and had not yet seen James. 
  &#8220;He don't think I'm so near,&#8221; thought James. &#8220;He thinks I won't  know  anything about his impudence. I'll soon make him draw in his  horns.&#8221; 
  In his excitement, James did not notice the boat particularly. If  he  had he would have seen that it was not his boat. But, so far as he   knew, there was no other boat on the pond. Indeed, there was no boy   whose father could afford to buy him one, and James had come to think   himself sole proprietor of the pond, as well as of the only craft that   plied on its surface. 
  &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;whether I couldn't have Herbert fined for   taking my property without leave, especially after I have expressly   forbidden him to do it. I must ask my father this evening. It would   bring down his pride a little to be taken before a justice.&#8221; 
  Herbert had got tired of cruising, and made a vigorous stroke, as  if  to cross the pond. James put up his hand to his mouth and shouted  at  the top of his voice: &#8220;Come right back, Herbert Carter!&#8221;
