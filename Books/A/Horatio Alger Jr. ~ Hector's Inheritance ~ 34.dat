    Hector was seasick for the first twenty-four hours, but at the end   of that time he had become accustomed to the rise and fall of the   billows, and was prepared to enjoy himself as well as he could in  the  confined quarters of an ocean steamer. 
  Of course, he made acquaintances. Among them was a clergyman, of   middle age, who was attracted by our hero's frank countenance. They   met on deck, and took together the &quot;constitutional&quot; which travelers   on shipboard find essential for their health. 
  &quot;You seem to be alone?&quot; said the clergyman. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Pardon me, but it is uncommon to meet one so young as yourself who   is making so long a journey. I suppose, however, you have friends or   relatives in California.&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir; I know no one, to my knowledge, in the Golden State.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, perhaps, you go out in search of employment?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir; I go out on business.&quot; 
  &quot;You are a young business man,&quot; said the clergyman, smiling. 
  &quot;Perhaps I should rather say, on a mission. I am sent out, by a New   York merchant, in search of his nephew, who is somewhere in San   Francisco.&quot; 
  Hector explained himself further. The minister, Mr. Richards,   listened with attention. 
  &quot;Certainly,&quot; he said, &quot;a great responsibility rests upon you. Mr.   Newman must have great confidence in you.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope he will not find it misplaced,&quot; answered Hector, modestly. 
  &quot;It is certainly a compliment to you that a shrewd business man   should consider you worthy of such confidence. The presumption is   that he has good reason for his confidence. I think, my young  friend,  that you will enjoy your visit to our State.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you reside there, sir?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes. I went out twenty years since; in fact, just after I   graduated from the theological school. I spent a year at the mines;   but, at the end of that time, finding an opening in my profession, I   accepted the charge of a church in Sacramento.&quot; 
  &quot;In Sacramento?&quot; exclaimed Hector, eagerly. 
  &quot;Yes. Have you any associations with that city?&quot; 
  &quot;It is my birthplace, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you are not a stranger to California?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; I came away so early that I have no recollection of the   place.&quot; 
  &quot;What is your name?&quot; asked the clergyman. 
  &quot;Hector Roscoe.&quot; 
  &quot;Roscoe? The name sounds familiar to me,&quot; said the minister,   thoughtfully. 
  &quot;How long since you went to Sacramento, Mr. Richards?&quot; 
  &quot;I went there in 1855.&quot; 
  &quot;And I was born there in 1856. My father and mother lived there for   some time afterwards.&quot; 
  &quot;It is probable that I met them, for Sacramento was a small place   then. Shall you go there?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir. I have a special reason for going&#8212;a reason most   important to me.&quot; 
  As Mr. Richards naturally looked inquisitive, Hector confided in  him  further. 
  &quot;You see, sir,&quot; he concluded, &quot;that it is most important to me to   ascertain whether I am really the son of the man whom I have always   regarded as my father. If so, I am heir to a large fortune. If not,   my uncle is the heir, and I certainly should not wish to disturb him   in the enjoyment of what the law awards him.&quot; 
  &quot;That is quite proper,&quot; said Mr. Richards. &quot;In your investigation,   it is quite possible that I may be able to help you materially,   through my long residence and extensive acquaintance in Sacramento.   When you come there, lose no time in calling upon me. Whatever help  I  can render you shall cheerfully be given.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall you be much disappointed if you find that you are only the   adopted, instead of the real, son of Mr. Roscoe?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; but it won't be chiefly on account of the property. I   shall feel alone in the world, without relations or family   connections, with no one to sympathize with me in my successes, or   feel for me in my disappointments.&quot; 
  &quot;I understand you, and I can enter into your feelings.&quot; 
  Arrived in San Francisco, Hector took lodgings at a comfortable   hotel on Kearney Street. He didn't go to the Palace Hotel, or   Baldwin's, though Mr. Newman had supplied him with ample funds, and   instructed him to spend whatever he thought might be necessary. 
  &quot;I mean to show myself worthy of his confidence,&quot; said Hector to   himself. 
  He arrived in the evening, and was glad to remain quietly at the   hotel the first evening, and sleep off the effects of his voyage.   After the contracted stateroom, in which he had passed over twenty   days, he enjoyed the comfort and luxury of a bed on shore and a   good-sized bedroom. But, in the morning, he took a long walk, which   was full of interest. Less than five minutes' walk from his hotel  was  the noted Chinese quarter. Curiously enough, it is located in  the  central part of the business portion of San Francisco. Set a  stranger  down in this portion of the city, and the traveler finds it  easy to  imagine himself in some Chinese city. All around him,  thronging the  sidewalks, he will see almond-eyed men, wearing long  queues, and clad  in the comfortable, but certainly not elegant,  flowing garments which  we meet only occasionally in our Eastern  cities, on the person of some  laundryman. Then the houses, too, with  the curious names on the signs,  speak of a far-off land. On every  side, also, is heard the uncouth  jargon of the Chinese tongue. 
  There is a part of San Francisco that is known as the Barbary  Coast.  It is that part which strangers will do well to avoid, for it  is the  haunt of the worst portion of the population. Here floats many  a  hopeless wreck, in the shape of a young man, who has yielded to the   seductions of drink and the gaming table&#8212;who has lost all hope and   ambition, and is fast nearing destruction. 
  If Hector allowed himself to explore this quarter, it was not   because he found anything to attract him, for his tastes were   healthy, but he thought, from the description of Gregory Newman,  that  he would stand a better chance of meeting him here than in a  more  respectable quarter. 
  Hector halted in front of a building, which he judged to be a   gambling house. He did not care to enter, but he watched, with   curiosity, those who entered and those who came out. 
  As he was standing there, a man of forty touched him on the   shoulder. 
  Hector turned, and was by no means attracted by the man's   countenance. He was evidently a confirmed inebriate, though not at   that time under the influence of liquor. There was an expression of   cunning, which repelled Hector, and he drew back. 
  &quot;I say, boy,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;do you want to go in?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;If you do, I know the ropes, and I'll introduce you and take care   of you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Hector, &quot;but I don't care to go in.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you afraid?&quot; asked the man, with a slight sneer. 
  &quot;Yes. Haven't I a reason?&quot; 
  &quot;Come, sonny, don't be foolish. Have you any money?&quot; 
  &quot;A little.&quot; 
  &quot;Give it to me and I'll play for you. I'll double it in ten  minutes,  and I'll only ask you five dollars for my services.&quot; 
  &quot;Suppose you lose?&quot; 
  &quot;I won't lose,&quot; said the man, confidently. &quot;Come,&quot; he said, in a   wheedling tone, &quot;let me make some money for you.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, but I would rather not. I don't want to make money in   any such way.&quot; 
  &quot;You're a fool!&quot; said the man, roughly, and with an air of disgust   he left the spot, much to Hector's relief. 
  Still Hector lingered, expecting he hardly knew what, but it  chanced  that fortune favored him. He was just about to turn away, when  a  youth, two or three years older than himself in appearance, came out   of the gambling house. He was pale, and looked as if he had kept  late  hours. He had the appearance, also, of one who indulges in  drink. 
  When Hector's glance fell upon the face of the youth, he started in   great excitement. 
  &quot;Surely,&quot; he thought, &quot;that must be Gregory Newman!&quot;
