"The Guns of Shiloh," a complete story in itself, is the complement of "The Guns of Bull Run." In "The Guns of Bull Run" the Civil War and its beginnings are seen through the eyes of Harry Kenton, who is on the Southern side. In "The Guns of Shiloh" the mighty struggle takes its color from the view of Dick Mason, who fights for the North and who is with Grant in his first great campaign.
