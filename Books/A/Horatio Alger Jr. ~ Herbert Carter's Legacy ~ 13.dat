  &#8220;Good morning, Squire Leech,&#8221; said Herbert, politely. 
  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said the squire, jumping to the conclusion that the   Carters had made up their minds to sell their place. &#8220;Do you wish to   see me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir; I hope I don't interrupt you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Go on,&#8221; said the squire, waving his hand. &#8220;I am busy, to be sure,  but  I can give you a few minutes.&#8221; 
  He resolved to take advantage of Mrs. Carter's necessities, and  make a  smaller offer for the place. In this way he would make her  suffer for  her former obstinate refusal to entertain his proposition. 
  His face fell when Herbert said: &#8220;I came to ask you if you could  give  me employment on one of your farms. My mother has been sick, and  I  feel that I ought to be doing something to earn money.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; said the squire, &#8220;I leave all such matters to Mr. Banks.  Was  that all you wished to say to me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I believe so,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Will there be any use in applying to   Mr. Banks?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know whether he has got help enough or not. Your mother  has  been sick, hasn't she?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir; all winter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I heard of it. I suppose you found it expensive, eh?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir. Neither of us could earn anything.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are in debt, then?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, sir. My uncle left us some money last year. That kept us  along.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's pretty much used up now, I suppose?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not quite.&#8221; 
  Herbert was inclined to be surprised at the squire's apparent  interest  in their affairs, but the motive soon became apparent. 
  &#8220;Well, you have made up your mind to sell the house now, I  suppose?&#8221;  said the squire. 
  &#8220;No, we hadn't thought of it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But you'll have to.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not if I can get employment,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Our expenses are very   small, and we can live on a little.&#8221; 
  The great man frowned. &#8220;That is all nonsense,&#8221; he said,  impatiently.  &#8220;It is quite impossible for you to hold on to the house.  I am willing  to give you cash down three hundred dollars over and  above the  mortgage for it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That isn't as much as you offered last year,&#8221; said Herbert,  shrewdly. 
  &#8220;I believe I did offer three hundred and fifty then.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Your last offer was fifty dollars more than that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It may be so, but I told your mother that it wasn't a standing  offer.  She must accept it then or not at all.&#8221; &#8220;We don't ask you to   purchase,&#8221; said Herbert, independently. &#8220;I had no idea of such a thing   when I came here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That makes no difference. You will have to sell, of course, and I   have made up my mind to offer you three hundred and fifty. If you had   taken me up at the time, I would have given you fifty more. You can't   expect that now, however.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We don't expect anything. The house is not for sale.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then, why are you taking up my valuable time?&#8221; demanded the  squire,  frowning with displeasure. 
  &#8220;I beg your pardon, sir. I only came in to ask for employment.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That I might have given you, if you hadn't been so unreasonable.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think we are unreasonable, Squire Leech. Even if we were   willing to sell, we should ask, at least, fourteen hundred dollars for   the place.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Fourteen hundred! Are you crazy? I never heard of such a thing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The place, land and all, cost my father fifteen hundred.&#8221; 
  &nbsp;&#8220;I don't believe it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We've got his papers to show that it is so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It isn't worth near that now.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is certainly worth more than eleven hundred, which is all you   offer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Look here, Carter,&#8221; said the squire, &#8220;I don't mind telling you  that I  want the place for one of my men&#8212;Brown. That is my only object  in  making you an offer at all. He is the cousin of Mr. Banks, my   superintendent, and I rather think Banks will find you something to   do, if you will induce your mother to sell the place.&#8221; &#8220;I can't do   that,&#8221; said Herbert, slowly. &#8220;I can't consent to my mother making such   a sacrifice. She might as well give you three or four hundred dollars   as sell the place so much under price.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are a boy, and know nothing about business. You think property   must necessarily bring its first cost, though, mind you, I don't admit   that yours cost anything like fifteen hundred dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am inexperienced,&#8221; Herbert admitted, &#8220;but I am sure it would be   foolish to sell for eleven hundred dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You may have to sell for less.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How is that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you are not prepared with the interest when the time comes, I   shall foreclose.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You wouldn't be so hard on us as that, Squire Leech,&#8221; said  Herbert,  anxiously. 
  &#8220;I don't call it hard, it is only just and legal. When that time   comes, I don't promise to pay as much as I offer to-day.&#8221; 
  Herbert looked serious. He saw that the squire meant just what he   said; that, in fact, he was lying in wait their need should put them   in his power. 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the squire, triumphantly, &#8220;you see how the matter  stands  now?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I do,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Then you will cease your foolish opposition to what is best for  you.&#8221;  &#8220;I will speak to my mother about it,&#8221; said Herbert, rising. &#8220;The  place  is hers, not mine, and she must decide.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Without your offering any foolish advice, I hope.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can't say as to that, Squire Leech. I will bid you good  morning.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Good morning. If you change your mind, call again, and we will see   about the employment.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said James, as Herbert came out, &#8220;did you get work?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not yet; your father is not sure whether he will find any for me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;When I am a man,&#8221; said James, pompously, &#8220;I do say I may be able  to  throw something in your way.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Herbert, tempted to smile in spite of his serious   thoughts. 
  &#8220;I shall be richer than my father,&#8221; added James, &#8220;his property is   increasing every year.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You have an excellent prospect before you,&#8221; said Herbert, half   enviously. 
  &#8220;That's so. Wouldn't you like to change places with me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am not sure about that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are not sure about that?&#8221; repeated James, incredulously. 
  &#8220;No.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why, I am a rich man's son.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know that; but I have an excellent mother.&#8221; 
  &#8220;She has got no money.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should not value her more if she were worth a million,&#8221; said   Herbert, warmly. 
  &#8220;Of course,&#8221; said James; &#8220;but that won't save you from being a day   laborer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is my great ambition just at present to become a day laborer,&#8221;   said Herbert, smiling. 
  &#8220;Of course, there's a great difference between us. But I say,  Carter,  can you help me with this kite? There's something wrong about  it. It  won't fly.&#8221; 
  Herbert looked at it critically. 
  &#8220;The trouble is with the frame,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's too heavy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish you'd help me about it.&#8221; 
  Very good-naturedly our hero set to work, and in the course of  twenty  minutes or so the difficulty was obviated. The kite would fly. 
  &#8220;You may stay and help me fly it,&#8221; said James, condescendingly. 
  &#8220;Thank you; I shall be needed at home.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, I forgot. Your time is valuable. Here, take this.&#8221; 
  James, with extraordinary liberality, held out five cents to  Herbert. 
  &#8220;What is that for?&#8221; asked Herbert, puzzled, and not offering to  take  the money. 
  &#8220;For your help about the kite.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, I wouldn't think of charging anything for that,&#8221; said Herbert,   amused. 
  &#8220;Why not? You are poor, and I am rich.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know it, but I don't want money for a trifle like that.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Just as you say,&#8221; said James, returning the money to his pocket, a   little relieved, if the truth must be told, that the coin was not   accepted, for he was naturally fond of money. 
  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said Herbert, turning to go. &#8220;If the kite gets out  of  order, you can call upon me any time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wonder why he didn't take the money,&#8221; thought James. &#8220;He may be   poor and proud; I've heard of such cases; but of course it would be   absurd for a boy in his position to be proud.&#8221; 
  Herbert kept on his way with a very serious face. It seemed as if  they  must lose their home, after all.
