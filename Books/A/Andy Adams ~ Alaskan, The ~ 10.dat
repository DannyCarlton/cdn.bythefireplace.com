  The wind had died away, but the rain continued, torrential in its  downpour, and the mountains grumbled with dying thunder. The town was  blotted out, and fifty feet ahead of the hissing nose of the launch  Alan could see only a gray wall. Water ran in streams from his rubber  slicker, and Olaf's great beard was dripping like a wet rag. He was  like a huge gargoyle at the wheel, and in the face of impenetrable  gloom he opened speed until the<I> Norden</I> was shooting with the  swiftness of a torpedo through the sea.
  In Olaf's cabin Alan had listened to the folly of expecting to find  Mary Standish. Between Eyak River and Katalla was a mainland of  battered reefs and rocks and an archipelago of islands in which a  pirate fleet might have found a hundred hiding-places. In his  experience of twenty years Ericksen had never known of the finding of a  body washed ashore, and he stated firmly his belief that the girl was  at the bottom of the sea. But the impulse to go on grew no less in  Alan. It quickened with the straining eagerness of the<I> Norden</I> as  the slim craft leaped through the water.
  Even the drone of thunder and the beat of rain urged him on. To him  there was nothing absurd in the quest he was about to make. It was the  least he could do, and the only honest thing he could do, he kept  telling himself. And there was a chance that he would find her. All  through his life had run that element of chance; usually it was against  odds he had won, and there rode with him in the gray dawn a conviction  he was going to win now&#8212;that he would find Mary Standish somewhere in  the sea or along the coast between Eyak River and the first of the  islands against which the shoreward current drifted. And when he found  her&#8212;
  He had not gone beyond that. But it pressed upon him now, and in  moments it overcame him, and he saw her in a way which he was fighting  to keep out of his mind. Death had given a vivid clearness to his  mental pictures of her. A strip of white beach persisted in his mind,  and waiting for him on this beach was the slim body of the girl, her  pale face turned up to the morning sun, her long hair streaming over  the sand. It was a vision that choked him, and he struggled to keep  away from it. If he found her like that, he knew, at last, what he  would do. It was the final crumbling away of something inside him, the  breaking down of that other Alan Holt whose negative laws and  self-imposed blindness had sent Mary Standish to her death.
  Truth seemed to mock at him, flaying him for that invulnerable poise  in which he had taken such an egotistical pride. For she had come to<I>  him</I> in her hour of trouble, and there were five hundred others  aboard the<I> Nome</I>. She had believed in him, had given him her  friendship and her confidence, and at the last had placed her life in  his hands. And when he had failed her, she had not gone to another. She  had kept her word, proving to him she was not a liar and a fraud, and  he knew at last the courage of womanhood and the truth of her words,  &#8220;You will understand&#8212;tomorrow.&#8221;
  He kept the fight within himself. Olaf did not see it as the dawn  lightened swiftly into the beginning of day. There was no change in the  tense lines of his face and the grim resolution in his eyes. And Olaf  did not press his folly upon him, but kept the<I> Norden</I> pointed  seaward, adding still greater speed as the huge shadow of the headland  loomed up in the direction of Hinchinbrook Island. With increasing day  the rain subsided; it fell in a drizzle for a time and then stopped.  Alan threw off his slicker and wiped the water from his eyes and hair.  White mists began to rise, and through them shot faint rose-gleams of  light. Olaf grunted approbation as he wrung water from his beard. The  sun was breaking through over the mountain tops, and straight above, as  the mist dissolved, was radiant blue sky.
  The miracle of change came swiftly in the next half-hour. Storm had  washed the air until it was like tonic; a salty perfume rose from the  sea; and Olaf stood up and stretched himself and shook the wet from his  body as he drank the sweetness into his lungs. Shoreward Alan saw the  mountains taking form, and one after another they rose up like living  things, their crests catching the fire of the sun. Dark inundations of  forest took up the shimmering gleam, green slopes rolled out from  behind veils of smoking vapor, and suddenly&#8212;in a final triumph of the  sun&#8212;the Alaskan coast lay before him in all its glory.
  The Swede made a great gesture of exultation with his free arm,  grinning at his companion, pride and the joy of living in his bearded  face. But in Alan's there was no change. Dully he sensed the wonder of  day and of sunlight breaking over the mighty ranges to the sea, but  something was missing. The soul of it was gone, and the old thrill was  dead. He felt the tragedy of it, and his lips tightened even as he met  the other's smile, for he no longer made an effort to blind himself to  the truth.
  Olaf began to guess deeply at that truth, now that he could see  Alan's face in the pitiless light of the day, and after a little the  thing lay naked in his mind. The quest was not a matter of duty, nor  was it inspired by the captain of the<I> Nome</I>, as Alan had given  him reason to believe. There was more than grimness in the other's  face, and a strange sort of sickness lay in his eyes. A little later he  observed the straining eagerness with which those eyes scanned the  softly undulating surface of the sea.
  At last he said, &#8220;If Captain Rifle was right, the girl went  overboard<I> out there</I>,&#8221; and he pointed.
  Alan stood up.
  &#8220;But she wouldn't be there now,&#8221; Olaf added.
  In his heart he believed she was, straight down&#8212;at the bottom. He  turned his boat shoreward. Creeping out from the shadow of the  mountains was the white sand of the beach three or four miles away. A  quarter of an hour later a spiral of smoke detached itself from the  rocks and timber that came down close to the sea.
  &#8220;That's McCormick's,&#8221; he said.
  Alan made no answer. Through Olaf's binoculars he picked out the  Scotchman's cabin. It was Sandy McCormick, Olaf had assured him, who  knew every eddy and drift in fifty miles of coast, and with his eyes  shut could find Mary Standish if she came ashore. And it was Sandy who  came down to greet them when Ericksen dropped his anchor in shallow  water.
  They leaped out, thigh-deep, and waded to the beach, and in the door  of the cabin beyond Alan saw a woman looking down at them wonderingly.  Sandy himself was young and ruddy-faced, more like a boy than a man.  They shook hands. Then Alan told of the tragedy aboard the<I> Nome</I>  and what his mission was. He made a great effort to speak calmly, and  believed that he succeeded. Certainly there was no break of emotion in  his cold, even voice, and at the same time no possibility of evading  its deadly earnestness. McCormick, whose means of livelihood were  frequently more unsubstantial than real, listened to the offer of  pecuniary reward for his services with something like shock. Fifty  dollars a day for his time, and an additional five thousand dollars if  he found the girl's body.
  To Alan the sums meant nothing. He was not measuring dollars, and if  he had said ten thousand or twenty thousand, the detail of price would  not have impressed him as important. He possessed as much money as that  in the Nome banks, and a little more, and had the thing been  practicable he would as willingly have offered his reindeer herds could  they have guaranteed him the possession of what he sought. In Olaf's  face McCormick caught a look which explained the situation a little.  Alan Holt was not mad. He was as any other man might be who had lost  the most precious thing in the world. And unconsciously, as he pledged  his services in acceptance of the offer, he glanced in the direction of  the little woman standing in the doorway of the cabin.
  Alan met her. She was a quiet, sweet-looking girl-woman. She smiled  gravely at Olaf, gave her hand to Alan, and her blue eyes dilated when  she heard what had happened aboard the<I> Nome</I>. Alan left the three  together and returned to the beach, while between the loading and the  lighting of his pipe the Swede told what he had guessed&#8212;that this girl  whose body would never be washed ashore was the beginning and the end  of the world to Alan Holt.
  For many miles they searched the beach that day, while Sandy  McCormick skirmished among the islands south and eastward in a light  shore-launch. He was, in a way, a Paul Revere spreading intelligence,  and with Scotch canniness made a good bargain for himself. In a dozen  cabins he left details of the drowning and offered a reward of five  hundred dollars for the finding of the body, so that twenty men and  boys and half as many women were seeking before nightfall.
  &#8220;And remember,&#8221; Sandy told each of them, &#8220;the chances are she'll  wash ashore sometime between tomorrow and three days later, if she  comes ashore at all.&#8221;
  In the dusk of that first day Alan found himself ten miles up the  coast. He was alone, for Olaf Ericksen had gone in the opposite  direction. It was a different Alan who watched the setting sun dipping  into the western sea, with the golden slopes of the mountains  reflecting its glory behind him. It was as if he had passed through a  great sickness, and up from the earth of his own beloved land had crept  slowly into his body and soul a new understanding of life. There was  despair in his face, but it was a gentler thing now. The harsh lines of  an obstinate will were gone from about his mouth, his eyes no longer  concealed their grief, and there was something in his attitude of a man  chastened by a consuming fire. He retraced his steps through deepening  twilight, and with each mile of his questing return there grew in him  that something which had come to him out of death, and which he knew  would never leave him. And with this change the droning softness of the  night itself seemed to whisper that the sea would not give up its dead.
  Olaf and Sandy McCormick and Sandy's wife were in the cabin when he  returned at midnight. He was exhausted. Seven months in the States had  softened him, he explained. He did not inquire how successful the  others had been. He knew. The woman's eyes told him, the almost  mothering eagerness in them when he came through the door. She had  coffee and food ready for him, and he forced himself to eat. Sandy gave  a report of what he had done, and Olaf smoked his pipe and tried to  speak cheerfully of the splendid weather that was coming tomorrow. Not  one of them spoke of Mary Standish.
  Alan felt the strain they were under and knew his presence was the  cause of it, so he lighted his own pipe after eating and talked to  Ellen McCormick about the splendor of the mountains back of Eyak River,  and how fortunate she was to have her home in this little corner of  paradise. He caught a flash of something unspoken in her eyes. It was a  lonely place for a woman, alone, without children, and he spoke about  children to Sandy, smiling. They should have children&#8212;a lot of them.  Sandy blushed, and Olaf let out a boom of laughter. But the woman's  face was unflushed and serious; only her eyes betrayed her, something  wistful and appealing in them as she looked at Sandy.
  &#8220;We're building a new cabin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there's two rooms in it  specially for kids.&#8221;
  There was pride in his voice as he made pretense to light a pipe  that was already lighted, and pride in the look he gave his young wife.  A moment later Ellen McCormick deftly covered with her apron something  which lay on a little table near the door through which Alan had to  pass to enter his sleeping-room. Olaf's eyes twinkled. But Alan did not  see. Only he knew there should be children here, where there was surely  love. It did not occur to him as being strange that he, Alan Holt,  should think of such a matter at all.
  The next morning the search was resumed. Sandy drew a crude map of  certain hidden places up the east coast where drifts and cross-currents  tossed the flotsam of the sea, and Alan set out for these shores with  Olaf at the wheel of the<I> Norden</I>. It was sunset when they  returned, and in the calm of a wonderful evening, with the comforting  peace of the mountains smiling down at them, Olaf believed the time had  come to speak what was in his mind. He spoke first of the weird tricks  of the Alaskan waters, and of strange forces deep down under the  surface which he had never had explained to him, and of how he had lost  a cask once upon a time, and a week later had run upon it well upon its  way to Japan. He emphasized the hide-and-seek playfulness of the  undertows and the treachery of them.
  Then he came bluntly to the point of the matter. It would be better  if Mary Standish never did come ashore. It would be days&#8212;probably  weeks&#8212;if it ever happened at all, and there would be nothing about her  for Alan to recognize. Better a peaceful resting-place at the bottom of  the sea. That was what he called it&#8212;&#8220;a peaceful resting-place&#8221;&#8212;and in  his earnestness to soothe another's grief he blundered still more  deeply into the horror of it all, describing certain details of what  flesh and bone could and could not stand, until Alan felt like clubbing  him beyond the power of speech. He was glad when he saw the McCormick  cabin.
  Sandy was waiting for them when they waded ashore. Something unusual  was in his face, Alan thought, and for a moment his heart waited in  suspense. But the Scotchman shook his head negatively and went close to  Olaf Ericksen. Alan did not see the look that passed between them. He  went to the cabin, and Ellen McCormick put a hand on his arm when he  entered. It was an unusual thing for her to do. And there was a glow in  her eyes which had not been there last night, and a flush in her  cheeks, and a new, strange note in her voice when she spoke to him. It  was almost exultation, something she was trying to keep back.
  &#8220;You&#8212;you didn't find her?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;No.&#8221; His voice was tired and a little old. &#8220;Do you think I shall  ever find her?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not as you have expected,&#8221; she answered quietly. &#8220;She will never  come like that.&#8221; She seemed to be making an effort. &#8220;You&#8212;you would  give a great deal to have her back, Mr. Holt?&#8221;
  Her question was childish in its absurdity, and she was like a child  looking at him as she did in this moment. He forced a smile to his lips  and nodded.
  &#8220;Of course. Everything I possess.&#8221;
  &#8220;You&#8212;you&#8212;loved her&#8212;&#8221;
  Her voice trembled. It was odd she should ask these questions. But  the probing did not sting him; it was not a woman's curiosity that  inspired them, and the comforting softness in her voice did him good.  He had not realized before how much he wanted to answer that question,  not only for himself, but for someone else&#8212;aloud.
  &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221;
  The confession almost startled him. It seemed an amazing confidence  to be making under any circumstances, and especially upon such brief  acquaintance. But he said no more, though in Ellen McCormick's face and  eyes was a tremulous expectancy. He stepped into the little room which  had been his sleeping place, and returned with his dunnage-sack. Out of  this he took the bag in which were Mary Standish's belongings, and gave  it to Sandy's wife. It was a matter of business now, and he tried to  speak in a businesslike way.
  &#8220;Her things are inside. I got them in her cabin. If you find her,  after I am gone, you will need them. You understand, of course. And if  you don't find her, keep them for me. I shall return some day.&#8221; It  seemed hard for him to give his simple instructions. He went on: &#8220;I  don't think I shall stay any longer, but I will leave a certified check  at Cordova, and it will be turned over to your husband when she is  found. And if you do find her, you will look after her yourself, won't  you, Mrs. McCormick?&#8221;
  Ellen McCormick choked a little as she answered him, promising to do  what he asked. He would always remember her as a sympathetic little  thing, and half an hour later, after he had explained everything to  Sandy, he wished her happiness when he took her hand in saying good-by.  Her hand was trembling. He wondered at it and said something to Sandy  about the priceless value of a happiness such as his, as they went down  to the beach.
  The velvety darkness of the sky was athrob with the heart-beat of  stars, when the<I> Norden's</I> shimmering trail led once more out to  sea. Alan looked up at them, and his mind groped strangely in the  infinity that lay above him. He had never measured it before. Life had  been too full. But now it seemed so vast, and his range in the tundras  so far away, that a great loneliness seized upon him as he turned his  eyes to look back at the dimly white shore-line dissolving swiftly in  the gloom that lay beneath the mountains.
