As you leave the river front behind you, and pass "up town," the  streets grow wider, and the architecture becomes more  ambitious--streets fringed with beautiful old trees and lined  with commodious private dwellings, mostly square white houses,  with spacious halls running through the centre. Previous to the  Revolution, white paint was seldom used on houses, and the  diamond-shaped window pane was almost universal. Many of the  residences stand back from the brick or flagstone sidewalk, and  have pretty gardens at the side or in the rear, made bright with  dahlias and sweet with cinnamon roses. If you chance to live in a  town where the authorities cannot rest until they have destroyed  every precious tree within their blighting reach, you will be  especially charmed by the beauty of the streets of Portsmouth.  In some parts of the town, when the chestnuts are in blossom, you  would fancy yourself in a garden in fairyland. In spring,  summer, and autumn the foliage is the glory of the fair town--her  luxuriant green and golden treeses! Nothing could seem more like  the work of enchantment than the spectacle which certain streets  in Portsmouth present in the midwinter after a heavy snowstorm.  You may walk for miles under wonderful silvery arches formed by  the overhanging and interlaced boughs of the trees, festooned  with a drapery even more graceful and dazzling than springtime  gives them. The numerous elms and maples which shade the  principal thoroughfares are not the result of chance, but the  ample reward of the loving care that is taken to preserve the  trees. There is a society in Portsmouth devoted to  arboriculture. It is not unusual there for persons to leave  legacies to be expended in setting out shade and ornamental trees  along some favorite walk. Richards Avenue, a long, unbuilt  thoroughfare leading from Middle Street to the South  Burying-Ground, perpetuates the name of a citizen who gave the  labor of his own hands to the beautifying of that windswept and  barren road the cemetery. This fondness and care for trees seems  to be a matter of heredity. So far back as 1660 the selectmen  instituted a fine of five shillings for the cutting of timber or  any other wood from off the town common, excepting under special  conditions.    
In the business section of the town trees are few. The chief  business streets are Congress and Market. Market Street is the  stronghold of the dry-goods shops. There are seasons, I suppose,  when these shops are crowded, but I have never happened to be in  Portsmouth at the time. I seldom pass through the narrow  cobble-paved street without wondering where the customers are  that must keep all these flourishing little establishments going.  Congress Street--a more elegant thoroughfare than Market--is the  Nevski Prospekt of Portsmouth. Among the prominent buildings is  the Athenaeum, containing a reading-room and library. From the  high roof of this building the stroller will do well to take a  glance at the surrounding country. He will naturally turn  seaward for the more picturesque aspects. If the day is clear, he  will see the famous Isle of Shoals, lying nine miles  away--Appledore, Smutty-Nose, Star Island, White Island, etc.;  there are nine of them in all. On Appledore is Laighton's Hotel,  and near it the summer cottage of Celia Thaxter, the poet of the  Isles. On the northern end of Star Island is the quaint town of  Gosport, with a tiny stone church perched like a sea-gull on its  highest rock. A mile southwest form Star Island lies White  Island, on which is a lighthouse. Mrs. Thaxter calls this the  most picturesque of the group. Perilous neighbors, O mariner! in  any but the serenest weather, these wrinkled, scarred, are  storm-smitten rocks, flanked by wicked sunken ledges that grow  white at the lip with rage when the great winds blow!    
How peaceful it all looks off there, on the smooth emerald sea!  and how softly the waves seem to break on yonder point where the  unfinished fort is! That is the ancient town of Newcastle, to  reach which from Portsmouth you have to cross three bridges with  the most enchanting scenery in New Hampshire lying on either  hand. At Newcastle the poet Stedman has built for his summerings  an enviable little stone chateau--a seashell into which I fancy  the sirens creep to warm themselves during the winter months. So  it is never without its singer.    
Opposite Newcastle is Kittery Point, a romantic spot, where Sir  William Pepperell, the first American baronet, once lived, and  where his tomb now is, in his orchard across the road, a few  hundred yards from the "goodly mansion" he built. The knight's  tomb and the old Pepperell House, which has been somewhat  curtailed of it fair proportions, are the objects of frequent  pilgrimages to Kittery Point.    
From the elevation (the roof of the Athenaeun) the navy yard, the  river with its bridges and islands, the clustered gables of  Kittery and Newcastle, the illimitable ocean beyond make a  picture worth climbing four or five flights of stairs to gaze  upon. Glancing down on the town nestled in the foliage, it seems  like a town dropped by chance in the midst of a forest. Among the  prominent objects which lift themselves above the tree tops are  the belfries of the various churches, the white fa?ade of the  custom house, and the mansard and chimneys of the Rockingham, the  principal hotel. The pilgrim will be surprised to find in  Portsmouth one of the most completely appointed hotels in the  United States. The antiquarian may lament the demolition of the  old Bell Tavern, and think regretfully of the good cheer once  furnished the wayfarer by Master Stavers at the sign of the Earl  of Halifax, and by Master Stoodley at his inn on Daniel Street;  but the ordinary traveler will thank his stars, and confess that  his lines have fallen in pleasant places, when he finds himself  among the frescoes of the Rockingham.    
Obliquely opposite the doorstep of the Athenaeum--we are supposed  to be on terra firma again--stands the Old North Church, a  substantial wooden building, handsomely set on what is called The  Parade, a large open space formed by the junction of Congress,  Market, Daniel, and Pleasant streets. Here in days innocent of  water-works stood the town pump, which on more than one occasion  served as whipping-post.    
The churches of Portsmouth are more remarkable for their number  than their architecture. With the exception of the Stone Church  they are constructed of wood or plain brick in the simplest  style. St. John's Church is the only one likely to attract the  eye of a stranger. It is finely situated on the crest of Church  Hill, overlooking the ever-beautiful river. The present edifice  was built in 1808 on the site of what was known as Queen's  Chapel, erected in 1732, and destroyed by fire December 24, 1806.  The chapel was named in honor of Queen Caroline, who furnished  the books for the altar and pulpit, the plate, and two solid  mahogany chairs, which are still in use in St. John's. Within  the chancel rail is a curious font of porphyry, taken by Colonel  John Tufton Mason at the capture of Senegal from the French in  1758, and presented to the Episcopal Society on 1761. The  peculiarly sweet-toned bell which calls the parishioners of St.  John's together every Sabbath is, I believe, the same that  formerly hung in the belfry of the old Queen's Chapel. If so, the  bell has a history of its own. It was brought from Louisburg at  the time of the reduction of that place in 1745, and given to the  church by the officers of the New Hampshire troops.    
The Old South Meeting-House is not to be passed without mention.  It is among the most aged survivals of pre-revolutionary days.  Neither its architecture not its age, however, is its chief  warrant for our notice. The absurd number of windows in this  battered old structure is what strikes the passer-by. The church  was erected by subscription, and these closely set large windows  are due to Henry Sherburne, one of the wealthiest citizens of the  period, who agreed to pay for whatever glass was used. If the  building could have been composed entirely of glass it would have  been done by the thrifty parishioners.    
Portsmouth is rich in graveyards--they seem to be a New England  specialty--ancient and modern. Among the old burial-places the  one attached to St. John's Church is perhaps the most  interesting. It has not been permitted to fall into ruin, like  the old cemetery at the Point of Graves. When a headstone here  topples over it is kindly lifted up and set on its pins again,  and encouraged to do its duty. If it utterly refuses, and is not  shamming decrepitude, it has its face sponged, and is allowed to  rest and sun itself against the wall of the church with a row of  other exempts. The trees are kept pruned, the grass trimmed, and  here and there is a rosebush drooping with a weight of pensive  pale roses, as becomes a rosebush in a churchyard.    
The place has about it an indescribable soothing atmosphere of  respectability and comfort. Here rest the remains of the  principal and loftiest in rank in their generation of the  citizens of Portsmouth prior to the Revolution--stanch,  royalty-loving governors, counselors, and secretaries of the  Providence of New Hampshire, all snugly gathered under the  motherly wing of the Church of England. It is almost impossible  to walk anywhere without stepping on a governor. You grow haughty  in spirit after a while, and scorn to tread on anything less than  one of His Majesty's colonels or secretary under the Crown. Here  are the tombs of the Atkinsons, the Jaffreys, the Sherburnes, the  Sheafes, the Marshes, the Mannings, the Gardners, and others of  the quality. All around you underfoot are tumbled-in coffins,  with here and there a rusty sword atop, and faded escutcheons,  and crumbling armorial devices. You are moving in the very best  society.    
This, however, is not the earliest cemetery in Portsmouth. An  hour's walk from the Episcopal yard will bring you to the spot,  already mentioned, where the first house was built and the first  grave made, at Odiorne's Point. The exact site of the Manor is  not known, but it is supposed to be a few rods north of an old  well of still-flowing water, at which the Tomsons and the Hiltons  and their comrades slaked their thirst more than two hundred and  sixty years ago. Oriorne's Point is owned by Mr. Eben L. Odiorne,  a lineal descendant of the worthy who held the property in 1657.  Not far from the old spring is the resting-place of the earliest  pioneers.    
"This first cemetery of the white man in New Hampshire," writes  Mr. Brewster, (1. Mr. Charles W. Brewster, for nearly fifty years  the editor of the Portsmouth Journal, and the author of two  volumes of local sketches to which the writer of these pages here  acknowledges his indebtedness.) "occupies a space of perhaps one  hundred feet by ninety, and is well walled in. The western side  is now used as a burial-place for the family, but two thirds of  it is filled with perhaps forty graves, indicated by rough head  and foot stones. Who there rest no one now living knows. But the  same care is taken of their quiet beds as if they were of the  proprietor's own family. In 1631 Mason sent over about eighty  emigrants many of whom died in a few years, and here they were  probably buried. Here too, doubtless, rest the remains of  several of those whose names stand conspicuous in our early state  records."
