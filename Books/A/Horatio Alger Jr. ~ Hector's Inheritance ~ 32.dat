    It is needless to say that Hector was very much surprised, not to   say startled, at this sudden proposal. What could Mr. Newman  possibly  want him to go to California for? If on business, how did  it happen  that he trusted a mere boy with so responsible a mission? 
  The explanation came soon. 
  &quot;No doubt, you are surprised,&quot; said the merchant, &quot;at the proposal  I  have made you. I am not prepared myself to say that I am acting with   good judgment. In making it, I have obeyed a sudden impulse, which  is  not always prudent. Yet, in more than one instance, I have found   advantage in obeying such an impulse. But to my explanation. By the   way, let me first ask you two or three questions. Have you any taste   for any kind of liquor?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered Hector, promptly. 
  &quot;Even if you had, do you think you would have self-control enough  to  avoid entering saloons and gratifying your tastes?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;That is well. Do you play pool?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered Hector, wondering whither all these questions   tended. 
  &quot;I ask because playing pool in public rooms paves the way for   intemperance, as bars are generally connected with such   establishments.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't even know how to play pool, sir,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;Do you ever bet or gamble?&quot; continued the merchant. 
  &quot;No, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;You will understand why I ask all these questions when I tell you   that I have a nephew now nineteen years of age, who does all these   things. He is not only my nephew, but my ward. I have a moderate sum   of money in my charge which belongs to him&#8212;enough, if he were a   young man of correct habits, to buy him an interest in a respectable   business. That use I had proposed to make of it when he reached   twenty-one, or rather, to recommend to him, but for his yielding to   temptation in more than one form, and, finally, running away from my   protection.&quot; 
  &quot;Where is he now, sir?&quot; 
  &quot;In California. Three months since he disappeared, and it was some   weeks before I learned where he had gone. As I do not intend to   conceal anything from you, I must tell you that he carried with him   five hundred dollars purloined from my desk. This grieved me most of   all. I wrote out to a mercantile friend in San Francisco, who knows   the boy by sight, to hunt him up, and see if he could do anything  for  him. He writes me&#8212;this is the letter I hold in my hand&#8212;that he  has  seen Gregory, and expostulated with him, but apparently without   effect. The boy has pretty much run through his money, and will soon   be in need. I do not intend, however, to send him money, for he  would  misuse it. I don't think it will do him any harm to suffer a  little  privation, as a fitting punishment for his wayward courses. I  would  not wish him to suffer too much, and I am anxious lest he  should go  further astray. I now come to the explanation of my  proposal to you. I  wish you to go to California, to seek out  Gregory, obtain his  confidence, and then persuade him to give up his  bad course, and come  home with you, prepared to lead a worthier  life. Are you willing to  undertake it?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered Hector. &quot;I will undertake it, since you are   willing to place such a responsibility upon me. I will do my best to   accomplish what you desire, but I may fail.&quot; 
  &quot;In that case I will not blame you,&quot; answered the merchant. 
  &quot;What sort of a boy is Gregory? Shall I find it difficult to gain   his confidence?&quot; 
  &quot;No; he is a youth of very amiable disposition&#8212;indeed, he was   generally popular among his companions and associates, but he is   morally weak, and finds it difficult to cope with temptation. I   believe that a boy like you will stand a better chance of  influencing  him than a man of mature age.&quot; 
  &quot;I will do my best, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;One thing more. You may assure Gregory that I forgive him the  theft  of my money, though it gave me great pain to find him capable of   such an act, and that I am prepared to receive him back into my  favor  if he will show himself worthy of it. I will give you a letter  to that  effect. Now, when will you be ready to start?&quot; 
  &quot;By the next steamer.&quot; 
  &quot;That is well.&quot;
