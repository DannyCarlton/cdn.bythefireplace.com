  Where a bit of the big river curved inward like the tongue of a   friendly dog, lapping the shore at Athabasca Landing, there still   remained Fingers' Row&#8212;nine dilapidated, weather-worn, and   crazily-built shacks put there by the eccentric genius who had   foreseen a boom ten years ahead of its time. And the fifth of  these  nine, counting from either one end or the other, was named  by its  owner, Dirty Fingers himself, the Good Old Queen Bess. It  was a shack  covered with black tar paper, with two windows, like  square eyes,  fronting the river as if always on the watch for  something. Across the  front of this shack Dirty Fingers had built  a porch to protect himself  from the rain in springtime, from the  sun in Summer time, and from the  snow in the months of Winter. For  it was here that Dirty Fingers sat  out all of that part of his  life which was not spent in bed. 
  Up and down two thousand miles of the Three Rivers was Dirty   Fingers known, and there were superstitious ones who believed that   little gods and devils came to sit and commune with him in the  front  of the tar-papered shack. No one was so wise along those  rivers, no  one was so satisfied with himself, that he would not  have given much  to possess the many things that were hidden away  in Dirty Fingers'  brain. One would not have suspected the workings  of that brain by a  look at Dirty Fingers on the porch of his Good  Old Queen Bess. He was  a great soft lump of a man, a giant of  flabbiness. Sitting in his  smooth-worn, wooden armchair, he was  almost formless. His head was  huge, his hair uncut and scraggy,  his face smooth as a baby's, fat as  a cherub's, and as  expressionless as an apple. His folded arms always  rested on a  huge stomach, whose conspicuousness was increased by an  enormous  watch-chain made from beaten nuggets of Klondike gold, and  Dirty  Fingers' thumb and forefinger were always twiddling at this  chain.  How he had come by the name of Dirty Fingers, when his right  name  was Alexander Toppet Fingers, no one could definitely say, unless   it was that he always bore an unkempt and unwashed appearance. 
  Whatever the quality of the two hundred and forty-odd pounds of   flesh in Dirty Fingers' body, it was the quality of his brain that   made people hold him in a sort of awe. For Dirty Fingers was a   lawyer, a wilderness lawyer, a forest bencher, a legal strategist  of  the trail, of the river, of the great timber-lands. 
  Stored away in his brain was every rule of equity and common law   of the great North country. For his knowledge he went back two   hundred years. He knew that a law did not die of age, that it must  be  legislated to death, and out of the moldering past he had dug  up every  trick and trap of his trade. He had no law-books. His  library was in  his head, and his facts were marshaled in pile  after pile of  closely-written, dust-covered papers in his shack.  He did not go to  court as other lawyers; and there were barristers  in Edmonton who  blessed him for that. 
  His shack was his tabernacle of justice. There he sat, hands   folded, and gave out his decisions, his advice, his sentences. He  sat  until other men would have gone mad. From morning until night,  moving  only for his meals or to get out of heat or storm, he was a  fixture on  the porch of the Good Old Queen Bess. For hours he  would stare at the  river, his pale eyes never seeming to blink.  For hours he would remain  without a move or a word. One constant  companion he had, a dog, fat,  emotionless, lazy, like his master.  Always this dog was sleeping at  his feet or dragging himself  wearily at his heels when Dirty Fingers  elected to make a journey  to the little store where he bartered for  food and necessities. 
  It was Father Layonne who came first to see Kent in his cell the   morning after Kent's unsuccessful attempt at flight. An hour later  it  was Father Layonne who traveled the beaten path to the door of  Dirty  Fingers' shack. If a visible emotion of pleasure ever  entered into  Dirty Fingers' face, it was when the little missioner  came  occasionally to see him. It was then that his tongue let  itself loose,  and until late at night they talked of many things  of which other men  knew but little. This morning Father Layonne  did not come casually,  but determinedly on business, and when  Dirty Fingers learned what that  business was, he shook his head  disconsolately, folded his fat arms  more tightly over his stomach,  and stated the sheer impossibility of  his going to see Kent. It  was not his custom. People must come to him.  And he did not like  to walk. It was fully a third of a mile from his  shack to  barracks, possibly half a mile. And it was mostly upgrade! If  Kent  could be brought to him&#8212; 
  In his cell Kent waited. It was not difficult for him to hear   voices in Kedsty's office when the door was open, and he knew that   the Inspector did not come in until after the missioner had gone  on  his mission to Dirty Fingers. Usually he was at the barracks an  hour  or so earlier. Kent made no effort to figure out a reason for  Kedsty's  lateness, but he did observe that after his arrival there  was more  than the usual movement between the office door and the  outside of the  barracks. Once he was positive that he heard  Cardigan's voice, and  then he was equally sure that he heard  Mercer's. He grinned at that.  He must be wrong, for Mercer would  be in no condition to talk for  several days. He was glad that a  turn in the hall hid the door of the  detachment office from him,  and that the three cells were in an  alcove, safely out of sight of  the curious eyes of visitors. He was  also glad that he had no  other prisoner for company. His situation was  one in which he  wanted to be alone. To the plan that was forming  itself in his  mind, solitude was as vital as the cooperation of  Alexander Toppet  Fingers. 
  Just how far he could win that cooperation was the problem which   confronted him now, and he waited anxiously for the return of  Father  Layonne, listening for the sound of his footsteps in the  outer hall.  If, after all, that inspirational thought of last  night came to  nothing, if Fingers should fail him&#8212; 
  He shrugged his shoulders. If that happened, he could see no other   chance. He would have to go on and take his medicine at the hands  of  a jury. But if Fingers played up to the game&#8212; 
  He looked out on the river again, and again it was the river that   seemed to answer him. If Fingers played with him, they would beat   Kedsty and the whole of N Division! And in winning he would prove  out  the greatest psychological experiment he had ever dared to  make. The  magnitude of the thing, when he stopped to think of it,  was a little  appalling, but his faith was equally large. He did  not consider his  philosophy at all supernatural. He had brought it  down to the level of  the average man and woman. 
  He believed that every man and woman possessed a subliminal   consciousness which it was possible to rouse to tremendous heights  if  the right psychological key was found to fit its particular  lock, and  he believed he possessed the key which fitted the  deeply-buried and  long-hidden thing in Dirty Fingers' remarkable  brain. Because he  believed in this metaphysics which he had not  read out of Aristotle,  he had faith that Fingers would prove his  salvation. He felt growing  in him stronger than ever a strange  kind of elation. He felt better  physically than last night. The  few minutes of strenuous action in  which he had half killed Mercer  had been a pretty good test, he told  himself. It had left no bad  effect, and he need no longer fear the  reopening of his wound. 
  A dozen times he had heard a far door open and close. Now he heard   it again, and a few moments later it was followed by a sound which   drew a low cry of satisfaction from him. Dirty Fingers, because of   overweight and lack of exercise, had what he called an &quot;asthmatic   wind,&quot; and it was this strenuous working of his lungs that  announced  his approach to Kent. His dog was also afflicted and for  the same  reasons, so that when they traveled together there was  some rivalry  between them. 
  &quot;We're both bad put out for wind, thank God,&quot; Dirty Fingers would   say sometimes. &quot;It's a good thing, for if we had more of it, we'd   walk farther, and we don't like walking.&quot; 
  The dog was with Fingers now, also Father Layonne, and Pelly.   Pelly unlocked the cell, then relocked it again after Fingers and  the  dog entered. With a nod and a hopeful look the missioner  returned with  Pelly to the detachment office. Fingers wiped his  red face with a big  handkerchief, gasping deeply for breath. Togs,  his dog, was panting as  if he had just finished the race of his  life. 
  &quot;A difficult climb,&quot; wheezed Fingers. &quot;A most difficult climb.&quot; 
  He sat down, rolling out like a great bag of jelly in the one   chair in the cell, and began to fan himself with his hat. Kent had   already taken stock of the situation. In Fingers' florid  countenance  and in his almost colorless eyes he detected a bit of  excitement which  Fingers was trying to hide. Kent knew what it  meant. Father Layonne  had found it necessary to play his full hand  to lure Fingers up the  hill, and had given him a hint of what it  was that Kent had in store  for him. Already the psychological key  had begun to work. 
  Kent sat down on the edge of his cot and grinned sympathetically.   &quot;It hasn't always been like this, has it, Fingers?&quot; he said then,   leaning a bit forward and speaking with a sudden, low-voiced   seriousness. &quot;There was a time, twenty years ago, when you didn't   puff after climbing a hill. Twenty years make a big difference,   sometimes.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sometimes,&quot; agreed Fingers in a wheezy whisper. 
  &quot;Twenty years ago you were&#8212;a fighter.&quot; 
  It seemed to Kent that a deeper color came into Dirty Fingers'   pale eyes in the few seconds that followed these words. 
  &quot;A fighter,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Most men were fighters in those days of   the gold rushes, weren't they, Fingers? I've heard a lot of the  old  stories about them in my wanderings, and some of them have  made me  thrill. They weren't afraid to die. And most of them were  pretty white  when it came to a show-down. You were one of them,  Fingers. I heard  the story one Winter far north. I've kept it to  myself, because I've  sort of had the idea that you didn't want  people to know or you would  have told it yourself. That's why I  wanted you to come to see me,  Fingers. You know the situation.  It's either the noose or iron bars  for me. Naturally one would  seek for assistance among those who have  been his friends. But I  do not, with the exception of Father Layonne.  Just friendship  won't save me, not the sort of friendship we have  today. That's  why I sent for you. Don't think that I am prying into  secrets that  are sacred to you, Fingers. God knows I don't mean it  that way.  But I've got to tell you of a thing that happened a long  time ago,  before you can understand. You haven't forgotten&#8212;you will  never  forget&#8212;Ben Tatman?&quot; 
  As Kent spoke the name, a name which Dirty Fingers had heard no   lips but his own speak aloud in nearly a quarter of a century, a   strange and potent force seemed suddenly to take possession of the   forest bencher's huge and flabby body. It rippled over and through   him like an electrical voltaism, making his body rigid, stiffening   what had seemed to be fat into muscle, tensing his hands until  they  knotted themselves slowly into fists. The wheeze went out of  his  breath, and it was the voice of another man who answered Kent. 
  &quot;You have heard&#8212;about&#8212;Ben Tatman?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. I heard it away up in the Porcupine country. They say it   happened twenty years ago or more. This Tatman, so I was told, was  a  young fellow green from San Francisco&#8212;a bank clerk, I think&#8212;  who  came into the gold country and brought his wife with him. They  were  both chuck-full of courage, and the story was that each  worshiped the  ground the other walked on, and that the girl had  insisted on being  her husband's comrade in adventure. Of course  neither guessed the sort  of thing that was ahead of them. 
  &quot;Then came that death Winter in Lost City. You know better than I   what the laws were in those days, Fingers. Food failed to come up.   Snow came early, the thermometer never rose over fifty below zero  for  three straight months, and Lost City was an inferno of  starvation and  death. You could go out and kill a man, then, and  perhaps get away  with it, Fingers. But if you stole so much as a  crust of bread or a  single bean, you were taken to the edge of the  camp and told to go!  And that meant certain death&#8212;death from  hunger and cold, more  terrible than shooting or hanging, and for  that reason it was the  penalty for theft. 
  &quot;Tatman wasn't a thief. It was seeing his young wife slowly dying   of hunger, and his horror at the thought of seeing her fall, as   others were falling, a victim to scurvy, that made him steal. He   broke into a cabin in the dead of night and stole two cans of  beans  and a pan of potatoes, more precious than a thousand times  their  weight in gold. And he was caught. Of course, there was the  wife. But  those were the days when a woman couldn't save a man, no  matter how  lovely she was. Tatman was taken to the edge of camp  and given his  pack and his gun&#8212;but no food. And the girl, hooded  and booted, was at  his side, for she was determined to die with  him. For her sake Tatman  had lied up to the last minute,  protesting his innocence. 
  &quot;But the beans and the potatoes were found in his cabin, and that   was evidence enough. And then, just as they were about to go  straight  out into the blizzard that meant death within a few  hours, then&#8212;&quot; 
  Kent rose to his feet, and walked to the little window, and stood   there, looking out. &quot;Fingers, now and then a superman is born on   earth. And a superman was there in that crowd of hunger-stricken  and  embittered men. At the last moment he stepped out and in a  loud voice  declared that Tatman was innocent and that he was  guilty. Unafraid, he  made a remarkable confession. He had stolen  the beans and the potatoes  and had slipped them into the Tatman  cabin when they were asleep. Why?  Because he wanted to save the  woman from hunger! Yes, he lied,  Fingers. He lied because he loved  the wife that belonged to another  man&#8212;lied because in him there  was a heart as true as any heart God  ever made. He lied! And his  lie was a splendid thing. He went out into  that blizzard,  strengthened by a love that was greater than his fear  of death,  and the camp never heard of him again. Tatman and his wife   returned to their cabin and lived. Fingers&#8212;&quot; Kent whirled  suddenly  from the window. &quot;Fingers&#8212;&quot; 
  And Fingers, like a sphynx, sat and stared at Kent. 
  &quot;You were that man,&quot; Kent went on, coming nearer to him. &quot;You   lied, because you loved a woman, and you went out to face death   because of that woman. The men at Lost City didn't know it,  Fingers.  The husband didn't know it. And the girl, that girl-wife  you worshiped  in secret, didn't dream of it! But that was the  truth, and you know it  deep down in your soul. You fought your way  out. You lived! And all  these years, down here on your porch,  you've been dreaming of a woman,  of the girl you were willing to  die for a long time ago. Fingers, am I  right? And if I am, will  you shake hands?&quot; 
  Slowly Fingers had risen from his chair. No longer were his eyes   dull and lifeless, but flaming with a fire that Kent had lighted   again after many years. And he reached out a hand and gripped  Kent's,  still staring at him as though something had come back to  him from the  dead. 
  &quot;I thank you, Kent, for your opinion of that man,&quot; he said.   &quot;Somehow, you haven't made me&#8212;ashamed. But it was only the shell  of  a man that won out after that day when I took Tatman's place.   Something happened. I don't know what. But&#8212;you see me now. I  never  went back into the diggings. I degenerated. I became what I  am.&quot; 
  &quot;And you are today just what you were when you went out to die for   Mary Tatman,&quot; cried Kent. &quot;The same heart and the same soul are in   you. Wouldn't you fight again today for her?&quot; 
  A stifled cry came from Fingers' lips. &quot;My God, yes, Kent&#8212;I   would!&quot; 
  &quot;And that's why I wanted you, of all men, to come to me, Fingers,&quot;   Kent went on swiftly. &quot;To you, of all the men on earth, I wanted  to  tell my story. And now, will you listen to it? Will you forgive  me for  bringing up this memory that must be precious to you, only  that you  might more fully understand what I am going to say? I  don't want you  to think of it as a subterfuge on my part. It is  more than that. It  is&#8212;Fingers, is it inspiration? Listen, and  tell me.&quot; 
  And for a long time after that James Kent talked, and Fingers   listened, the soul within him writhing and dragging itself back  into  fierce life, demanding for the first time in many years the  something  which it had once possessed, but which it had lost. It  was not the  lazy, mysterious, silent Dirty Fingers who sat in the  cell with Kent.  In him the spirit of twenty years ago had roused  itself from long  slumber, and the thrill of it pounded in his  blood. Two-Fisted Fingers  they had called him then, and he was  Two-Fisted Fingers in this hour  with Kent. Twice Father Layonne  came to the head of the cell alcove,  but turned back when he heard  the low and steady murmur of Kent's  voice. Nothing did Kent keep  hidden, and when he had finished,  something that was like the fire  of a revelation had come into  Fingers' face. 
  &quot;My God!&quot; he breathed deeply. &quot;Kent, I've been sitting down there   on my porch a long time, and a good many strange things have come  to  me, but never anything like this. Oh, if it wasn't for this  accursed  flesh of mine!&quot; 
  He jumped from his chair more quickly than he had moved in ten   years, and he laughed as he had not laughed in all that time. He   thrust out a great arm and doubled it up, like a prizefighter  testing  his muscle. &quot;Old? I'm not old! I was only twenty-eight  when that  happened up there, and I'm forty-eight now. That isn't  old. It's what  is in me that's grown old. I'll do it, Kent! I'll  do it, if I hang for  it!&quot; 
  Kent fairly leaped upon him. &quot;God bless you!&quot; he cried huskily.   &quot;God bless you, Fingers! Look! Look at that!&quot; He pulled Fingers to   the little window, and together they looked out upon the river,   shimmering gloriously under a sun-filled sky of blue. &quot;Two  thousand  miles of it,&quot; he breathed. &quot;Two thousand miles of it,  running straight  through the heart of that world we both have  known! No, you're not  old, Fingers. The things you used to know  are calling you again, as  they are calling me, for somewhere off  there are the ghosts of Lost  City, ghosts&#8212;and realities!&quot; 
  &quot;Ghosts&#8212;and hopes,&quot; said Fingers. 
  &quot;Hopes make life,&quot; softly whispered Kent, as if to himself. And   then, without turning from the window, his hand found Fingers' and   clasped it tight. &quot;It may be that mine, like yours, will never  come  true. But they're fine to think about, Fingers. Funny, isn't  it, that  their names should be so strangely alike&#8212;Mary and  Marette? I say,  Fingers&#8212;&quot; 
  Heavy footsteps sounded in the hall. Both turned from the window   as Constable Pelly came to the door of the cell. They recognized  this  intimation that their time was up, and with his foot Fingers  roused  his sleeping dog. 
  It was a new Fingers who walked back to the river five minutes   later, and it was an amazed and discomfited dog who followed at  his  heels, for at times the misshapen and flesh-ridden Togs was  compelled  to trot for a few steps to keep up. And Fingers did not  sink into the  chair on the shady porch when he reached his shack.  He threw off his  coat and waistcoat and rolled up his sleeves, and  for hours after that  he was buried deep in the accumulated masses  of dust-covered legal  treasures stored away in hidden corners of  the Good Old Queen Bess.
