  Sheer amazement made Aldous hold his fire in that first moment.  Marie had said that two men were after MacDonald. He had heard three  shots nearly a mile away, and she was still sobbing that DeBar was  dead. That accounted for<I> three</I>. He had expected to see only  Quade, and FitzHugh, and one other behind the tepee. And there were  six! He counted them as they came swiftly out from the shelter of the  rocks to the level of the plain. He was about to fire when he thought  of Joanne and Marie. They were still behind him, crouching upon the  ground. To fire from where he stood would draw a fusillade of bullets  in their direction, and with another warning cry to Joanne, he sped  twenty paces to one side so that they would not be within range. Not  until then did the attacking party see him.
  At a hundred and fifty yards he had no time to pick out Quade or  Mortimer FitzHugh. He fired first at a group of three, and one of the  three crumpled down as though his skull had been crushed from above. A  rifle spat back at him and the bullet sang like a ripping cloth close  over his head. He dropped to his knees before he fired again, and a  bullet clove the air where he had stood. The crack of rifles did not  hurry him. He knew that he had six cartridges, and only six, and he  aimed deliberately. At his second shot the man he had fired at ran  forward three or four steps, and then pitched flat on his face. For a  flash Aldous thought that it was Mortimer FitzHugh. Then, along his gun  barrel, he saw FitzHugh&#8212;and pulled the trigger. It was a miss.
  Two men had dropped upon their knees and were aiming more carefully.  He swung his sight to the foremost, and drove a bullet straight through  his chest. The next moment something seemed to have fallen upon him  with crushing weight. A red sea rose before his eyes. In it he was  submerged; the roar of it filled his ears; it blinded him; and in the  suffocating embrace of it he tried to cry out. He fought himself out of  it, his eyes cleared, and he could see again. His rifle was no longer  in his hands, and he was standing. Twenty feet away men were rushing  upon him. His brain recovered itself with the swiftness of lightning. A  bullet had stunned him, but he was not badly hurt. He jerked out his  automatic, but before he could raise it, or even fire from his hip, the  first of his assailants was upon him with a force that drove it from  his hand. They went down together, and as they struggled on the bare  rock Aldous caught for a fraction of a second a scene that burned  itself like fire in his brain. He saw Mortimer FitzHugh with a revolver  in his hand. He had stopped; he was staring like one looking upon the  ghost of the dead, and as he stared there rose above the rumbling roar  of the chasm a wild and terrible shriek from Joanne.
  Aldous saw no more then. He was not fighting for his life, but for  her, and he fought with the mad ferocity of a tiger. As he struck, and  choked, and beat the head of his assailant on the rock, he heard shriek  after shriek come from Joanne's lips; and then for a flash he saw them  again, and Joanne was struggling in the arms of Quade!
  He struggled to his knees, and the man he was fighting struggled to  his knees; and then they came to their feet, locked in a death-grip on  the edge of the chasm. From Quade's clutch he saw Joanne staring at  Mortimer FitzHugh; then her eyes shot to him, and with another shriek  she fought to free herself.
  For thirty seconds of that terrible drama Mortimer FitzHugh stood as  if hewn out of rock. Then he sprang toward the fighters.
  In the arms of John Aldous was the strength of ten men. He twisted  the head of his antagonist under his arm; he braced his feet&#8212;in  another moment he would have flung him bodily into the roaring  maelstrom below. Even as his muscles gathered themselves for the final  effort he knew that all was lost. Mortimer FitzHugh's face leered over  his shoulder, his demoniac intention was in his eyes before he acted.  With a cry of hatred and of triumph he shoved them both over the edge,  and as Aldous plunged to the depths below, still holding to his enemy,  he heard a last piercing scream from Joanne.
  As the rock slid away from under his feet his first thought was that  the end had come, and that no living creature could live in the roaring  maelstrom of rock and, flood into which he was plunging. But quicker  than he dashed through space his mind worked. Instinctively, without  time for reasoning, he gripped at the fact that his one chance lay in  the close embrace of his enemy. He hung to him. It seemed to him that  they turned over and over a hundred times in that distance of fifty  feet. Then a mass of twisting foam broke under him, and up out of it  shot the head of one of the roaring monsters of rock that he and Joanne  had looked upon. They struck it fairly, and Aldous was uppermost. He  felt the terrific impact of the other's body. The foam boiled upward  again, and they slipped off into the flood.
  Still Aldous held to his enemy. He could feel that he was limp now;  he no longer felt the touch of the hands that had choked him, or the  embrace of the arms that had struggled with him. He believed that his  antagonist was dead. The fifty-foot fall, with the rock splitting his  back, had killed him. For a moment Aldous still clung to him as they  sank together under the surface, torn and twisted by the whirling  eddies and whirlpools. It seemed to him that they would never cease  going down, that they were sinking a vast distance.
  Dully he felt the beat of rocks. Then it flashed upon him that the  dead man was sinking like a weighted thing. He freed himself. Fiercely  he struggled to bring himself to the surface. It seemed an eternity  before he rose to the top. He opened his mouth and drew a great gulp of  air into his lungs. The next instant a great rock reared like a living  thing in his face; he plunged against it, was beaten over it, and again  he was going down&#8212;down&#8212;in that deadly clutch of maelstrom and  undertow. Again he fought, and again he came to the surface. He saw a  black, slippery wall gliding past him with the speed of an express  train. And now it seemed as though a thousand clubs were beating him.  Ahead of him were rocks&#8212;nothing but rocks.
  He shot through them like a piece of driftwood. The roaring in his  ears grew less, and he felt the touch of something under his feet.  Sunlight burst upon him. He caught at a rock, and hung to it. His eyes  cleared a little. He was within ten feet of a shore covered with sand  and gravel. The water was smooth and running with a musical ripple.  Waist-deep he waded through it to the shore, and fell down upon his  knees, with his face buried in his arms. He had been ten minutes in the  death-grip of the chasm. It was another ten minutes before he staggered  to his feet and looked about him.
  His face was beaten until he was almost blind. His shirt had been  torn from his shoulders and his flesh was bleeding. He advanced a few  steps. He raised one arm and then the other. He limped. One arm hurt  him when he moved it, but the bone was sound. He was terribly mauled,  but he knew that no bones were broken, and a gasp of thankfulness fell  from his lips. All this time his mind had been suffering even more than  his body. Not for an instant, even as he fought for life between the  chasm walls, and as he lay half unconscious on the rock, had he  forgotten Joanne. His one thought was of her now. He had no weapon, but  as he stumbled in the direction of the camp in the little plain he  picked up a club that lay in his path.
  That MacDonald was dead, Aldous was certain. There would be four  against him&#8212;Quade and Mortimer FitzHugh and the two men who had gone  to the mountain. His brain cleared swiftly as a part of his strength  returned, and it occurred to him that if he lost no time he might come  upon Joanne and her captors before the two men came from killing old  Donald. He tried to run. Not until then did he fully realize the  condition he was in. Twice in the first hundred yards his legs doubled  under him and he fell down among the rocks. He grew steadily stronger,  though each time he tried to run or spring a distance of a few feet his  legs doubled under him like that. It took him twenty minutes to get  back to the edge of the plain, and when he got there it was empty.  There was no sign of Quade or FitzHugh, or of Joanne and Marie; and  there was no one coming from the direction of the mountain.
  He tried to run again, and he found that over the level floor of the  valley he could make faster time than among the rocks. He went to where  he had dropped his rifle. It was gone. He searched for his automatic.  That, too, was gone. There was one weapon left&#8212;a long skinning-knife  in one of the panniers near the tepee. As he went for this, he passed  two of the men whom he had shot. Quade and FitzHugh had taken their  weapons, and had turned them over to see if they were alive or dead.  They were dead. He secured the knife, and behind the tepee he passed  the third body, its face as still and white as the others. He shuddered  as he recognized it. It was Slim Barker. His rifle was gone.
  More swiftly now he made his way into the break out of which his  assailants had come a short time before. The thought came to him again  that he had been right, and that Donald MacDonald, in spite of all his  years in the mountains, had been fatally wrong. Their enemies had come  down from the north, and this break led to their hiding-place. Through  it Joanne must have been taken by her captors. As he made his way over  the rocks, gaining a little more of his strength with each step, his  mind tried to picture the situation that had now arisen between Quade  and Mortimer FitzHugh. How would Quade, who was mad for possession of  Joanne, accept FitzHugh's claim of ownership? Would he believe his  partner? Would he even believe Joanne if, to save herself from him, she  told him FitzHugh was her husband? Even if he believed them,<I> would  he give her up?</I> Would Quade allow Mortimer FitzHugh to stand  between him and the object for which he was willing to sacrifice  everything?
  As Aldous asked himself these questions his blood ran hot and cold  by turns. And the answer to them drew a deep breath of fear and of  anguish from him as he tried again to run among the rocks. There could  be but one answer: Quade would fight. He would fight like a madman, and  if this fight had happened and FitzHugh had been killed Joanne had  already gone utterly and helplessly into his power. He believed that  FitzHugh had not revealed to Quade his relationship to Joanne while  they were on the plain, and the thought still more terrible came to him  that he might not reveal it at all, that he might repudiate Joanne even  as she begged upon her knees for him to save her. What a revenge it  would be to see her helpless and broken in the arms of Quade! And then,  both being beasts&#8212;&#8212;
  He could think no farther. The sweat broke out on his face as he  hobbled faster over a level space. The sound of the water between the  chasm walls was now a thunder in his ears. He could not have heard a  rifle-shot or a scream a hundred yards away. The trail he was following  had continually grown narrower. It seemed to end a little ahead of him,  and the fear that he had come the wrong way after all filled him with  dread. He came to the face of the mountain wall, and then, to his left,  he saw a crack that was no wider than a man's body. In it there was  sand, and the, sand was beaten by footprints! He wormed his way  through, and a moment later stood at the edge of the chasm. Fifty feet  above him a natural bridge of rock spanned the huge cleft through which  the stream was rushing. He crossed this, exposing himself openly to a  shot if it was guarded. But it was not guarded. This fact convinced him  that MacDonald had been killed, and that his enemies believed he was  dead. If MacDonald had escaped, and they had feared a possible pursuit,  some one would have watched the bridge.
  The trail was easy to follow now. Sand and grassy earth had replaced  rock and shale; he could make out the imprints of feet&#8212;many of  them&#8212;and they led in the direction of a piece of timber that  apparently edged a valley running to the east and west. The rumble of  the torrent in the chasm grew fainter as he advanced. A couple of  hundred yards farther on the trail swung to the left again; it took him  around the end of a huge rock, and as he appeared from behind this, his  knife clutched in his hand, he dropped suddenly flat on his face, and  his heart rose like a lump in his throat. Scarcely fifty yards above  him was the camp of his enemies! There were two tepees and piles of  saddles and panniers and blankets about them, but not a soul that he  could see. And then, suddenly, there rose a voice bellowing with rage,  and he recognized it as Quade's. It came from beyond the tepee, and he  rose quickly from where he had thrown himself and ran forward, with the  tepee between him and those on the other side. Close to the canvas he  dropped on his knees and crawled out behind a pile of saddles and  panniers. From here he could see.
  So near that he could almost have touched them were Joanne and  Marie, seated on the ground, with their backs toward him. Their hands  were tied behind them. Their feet were bound with pannier ropes. A  dozen paces beyond them were Quade and Mortimer FitzHugh.
  The two men were facing each other, a yard apart. Mortimer  FitzHugh's face was white, a deadly white, and he was smiling. His  right hand rested carelessly in his hunting-coat pocket. There was a  sneering challenge on his lips; in his eyes was a look that Aldous knew  meant death if Quade moved. And Quade was like a great red beast ready  to spring. His eyes seemed bulging out on his cheeks; his great hands  were knotted; his shoulders were hunched forward, and his mottled face  was ablaze with passion. In that moment's dramatic tableau Aldous  glanced about swiftly. The men from the mountain had not returned. He  was alone with Quade and Mortimer FitzHugh.
  Then FitzHugh spoke, very quietly, a little laughingly; but his  voice trembled, and Aldous knew what the hand was doing in the  hunting-coat pocket.
  &#8220;You're excited, Billy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'm not a liar, as you've very  impolitely told me. And I'm not playing you dirt, and I haven't fallen  in love with the lady myself, as you seem to think. But she belongs to  me, body and soul. If you don't believe me&#8212;why, ask the lady herself,  Billy!&#8221;
  As he spoke, he turned his sneering eyes for the fraction of a  second toward Joanne. The movement was fatal. Quade was upon him. The  hand in the coat pocket flung itself upward, there followed a muffled  report, but the bullet flew wide. In all his life Aldous had never  heard a sound like the roar that came from Quade's throat then. He saw  Mortimer FitzHugh's hand appear with a pistol in it, and then the  pistol was gone. He did not see where it went to. He gripped his knife  and waited, his heart beating with what seemed like smothered  explosions as he watched for the opportunity which he knew would soon  come. He expected to see FitzHugh go down under Quade's huge bulk.  Instead of that, a small, iron fist shot upward and Quade's head went  back as if broken from his neck.
  FitzHugh sprang a step backward, and in the movement his heel caught  the edge of a pack-saddle. He stumbled, almost fell, and before he  could recover himself Quade was at him again. This time there was  something in the red brute's hand. It rose and fell once&#8212;and Mortimer  FitzHugh reeled backward with a moaning cry, swayed for a second or two  on his feet, and fell to the ground. Quade turned. In his hand was a  bloody knife. Madness and passion and the triumphant joy of a demon  were in his face as he glared at his helpless prey. As Aldous crouched  lower his shoulder touched one of the saddles. It slipped from the  pile, one of the panniers followed it, and Quade saw him. There was no  longer reason for concealment, and as Quade stood paralyzed for a  moment Aldous sprang forth into the space between him and Joanne. He  heard the cry that broke strangely from her lips but he did not turn  his head. He advanced upon Quade, his head lowered, the long  skinning-knife gleaming in his hand.
  John Aldous knew that words would avail nothing in these last few  minutes between him and Quade. The latter had already hunched himself  forward, the red knife in his hand poised at his waistline. He was  terrible. His huge bulk, his red face and bull neck, his eyes popping  from behind their fleshy lids, and the dripping blade in the shapeless  hulk of his hand gave him the appearance as he stood there of some  monstrous gargoyle instead of a thing of flesh and blood. And Aldous  was terrible to look at, but in a way that wrung a moaning cry from  Joanne. His face was livid from the beat of the rocks; it was crusted  with blood; his eyes were partly closed, and what remained of his shirt  was drenched with blood that still ran from the deep cuts in his arms  and shoulders. But it was he who advanced, and Quade who stood and  waited.
  Aldous knew little or nothing of knife-fighting; and he realized,  also, that there was a strange weakness in his arms and body caused by  his battle with the maelstroms in the chasm. But he had wrestled a  great deal with the Indians of the north, who fought as their half-wolf  sledgedogs fought, and he employed their methods now. Slowly and  deliberately he began to circle around Quade, so that Quade became the  pivot of that circle, and as he circled he drew nearer and nearer to  his enemy, but never in a frontal advance. He edged inward, with his  knife-arm on the outside. His deadly deliberateness and the steady  glare of his eyes discomfited Quade, who suddenly took a step backward.
  It was always when the Indian made this step that his opponent  darted in; and Aldous, with this in mind, sprang to the attack. Their  knives clashed in midair. As they met, hilt to hilt, Aldous threw his  whole weight against Quade, darted sidewise, and with a terrific lunge  brought the blade of his knife down between Quade's shoulders. A  straight blade would have gone from back to chest through muscle and  sinew, but the knife which Aldous held scarcely pierced the other's  clothes.
  Not until then did he fully realize the tremendous odds against him.  The curved blade of his skinning-knife would not penetrate! His one  hope was to cut with it. He flung out his arm before Quade had fully  recovered, and blind luck carried the keen edge of the knife across his  enemy's pouchy cheek. The blood came in a spurt, and with a terrible  cry Quade leaped back toward the pile of saddles and panniers. Before  Aldous could follow his advantage the other had dropped his knife and  had snatched up a four-foot length of a tepee pole. For a moment he  hesitated while the blood ran in a hot flood down his thick neck. Then  with a bellow of rage he rushed upon Aldous.
  It was no time for knife-work now. As the avalanche of brute  strength descended upon him Aldous gathered himself for the shock. He  had already measured his own weakness. Those ten minutes among the  rocks of the chasm had broken and beaten him until his strength was  gone. He was panting from his first onset with Quade, but his brain was  working. And he knew that Quade was no longer a reasoning thing. He had  ceased to think. He was blind with the passion of the brute, and his  one thought was to crush his enemy down under the weight of the club in  his huge hands. Aldous waited. He heard Joanne's terrified scream when  Quade was almost upon him&#8212;when less than five feet separated them. The  club was descending when he flung himself forward, straight for the  other's feet. The club crashed over him, and with what strength he had  he gripped Quade at the knees. With a tremendous thud Quade came to  earth. The club broke from the grip of his hands. For a moment he was  stunned, and in that moment Aldous was at his throat.
  He would have sold the best of his life for the skinning-knife. But  he had lost it in gripping Quade. And now he choked&#8212;with every ounce  of strength in him he choked at the thick red neck of his enemy.  Quade's hands reached for his own throat. They found it. And both  choked, lying there gasping and covered with blood! while Joanne  struggled vainly to free herself, and scream after scream rang from her  lips. And John Aldous knew that at last the end had come. For there was  no longer strength in his arms, and there was something that was like a  strange cramp in his fingers, while the clutch at his own throat was  turning the world black. His grip relaxed. His hands fell limp. The  last that he realized was that Quade was over him, and that he must be  dying.
  Then it was, as he lay within a final second or two of death, no  longer conscious of physical attack or of Joanne's terrible cries, that  a strange and unforeseen thing occurred. Beyond the tepee a man had  risen from the earth. He staggered toward them, and it was from Marie  that the wildest and strangest cry of all came now. For the man was Joe  DeBar! In his hand he held a knife. Swaying and stumbling he came to  the fighters&#8212;from behind. Quade did not see him, and over Quade's huge  back he poised himself. The knife rose; for the fraction of a second it  trembled in midair. Then it descended, and eight inches of steel went  to the heart of Quade.
  And as DeBar turned and staggered toward Joanne and Marie, John  Aldous was sinking deeper and deeper into a black and abysmal night.
