  Upon Jan now fell a great responsibility. M&eacute;lisse was his own. Days   passed before he could realize the fullness of his possession. He had   meant to go by the Athabasca water route to see Jean de Gravois,   leaving M&eacute;lisse to Cummins for a fortnight or so. Now he gave this up.   Day and night he guarded the child; and to Jan's great joy it soon   came to pass that whenever he was compelled to leave her for a short   time, M&eacute;lisse would cry for him. At least Maballa assured him that   this was so, and M&eacute;lisse gave evidence of it by her ecstatic joy when   he returned. 
  When Cummins came back from Fort Churchill in the autumn, he  brought  with him a pack full of things for M&eacute;lisse, including new  books and  papers, for which he had spent a share of his season's  earnings. As he  was freeing these treasures from their wrapping of  soft caribou skin,  with Jan and M&eacute;lisse both looking on, he stopped  suddenly and glanced  from his knees up at the boy. 
  &quot;They're wondering over at Churchill what became of the missionary  who  left with the mail, Jan. They say he was last seen at the  Etawney.&quot; 
  &quot;And not here?&quot; replied Jan quickly. 
  &quot;Not that they know of,&quot; said Cummins, still keeping his eyes on  the  boy. &quot;The man who drove him never got back to Churchill. They're   wondering where the driver went, too. A company officer has gone up to   the Etawney, and it is possible he may come over to Lac Bain. I don't   believe he'll find the missionary.&quot; 
  &quot;Neither do I,&quot; said Jan quite coolly. &quot;He is probably dead, and  the  wolves and foxes have eaten him before this&#8212;or mebby ze feesh!&quot; 
  Cummins resumed his task of unpacking, and among the books which he   brought forth there were two which he gave to Jan. 
  &quot;The supply ship from London came in while I was at Churchill, and   those came with it,&quot; he explained. &quot;They're school-books. There's   going to be a school at Churchill next winter, and the winter after   that it will be at York Factory, down on the Hayes.&quot; He settled back   on his heels and looked at Jan. &quot;It's the first school that has ever   come nearer than four hundred miles of us. That's at Prince Albert.&quot; 
  For many succeeding days Jan took long walks alone in the forest   trails, and silently thrashed out the two problems which Cummins had   brought back from Churchill for him. Should he warn Jean de Gravois   that a company officer was investigating the disappearance of the   missionary? 
  At first his impulse was to go at once into Jean's haunts beyond  the  Fond du Lac, and give him the news. But even if the officer did  come  to Post Lac Bain, how would he know that the missionary was at  the  bottom of the lake, and that Jean de Gravois was accountable for  it?  So in the end Jan decided that it would be folly to stir up the  little  hunter's fears, and he thought no more of the company's  investigator  who had gone up to the Etawney. 
  But the second problem was one whose perplexities troubled him.   Cummins' word of the school at Churchill had put a new and thrilling   thought into his head, and always with that thought he coupled visions   of the growing M&eacute;lisse. This year the school would be at Churchill,   and the next at York Factory, and after that it might be gone for   ever, so that when M&eacute;lisse grew up there would be none nearer than   what Jan looked upon as the other end of the world. Why could not he   go to school for M&eacute;lisse, and store up treasures which in time he   might turn over to her? 
  The scheme was a colossal one, by all odds the largest that had  ever  entered into his dreams of what life held for him&#8212;that he, Jan   Thoreau, should learn to read and write, and do other things like the   people of the far South, so that he might help to make the little   creature in the cabin like her who slept under the watchful spruce. He   was stirred to the depths of his soul, now with fear, again with hope   and desire and ambition; and it was not until the first cold chills of   approaching winter crept down from the north and east that the   ultimate test came, and he told Cummins of his intention. 
  Once his mind was settled, Jan lost no time in putting his plans  into  action. Mukee knew the trail to Churchill, and agreed to leave  with  him on the third day&#8212;which gave Williams' wife time to make him  a new  coat of caribou skin. 
  On the second evening he played for the last time in the little  cabin;  and after M&eacute;lisse had fallen asleep he took her up gently in  his arms  and held her there for a long time, while Cummins looked on  in  silence. When he replaced her in the little bed against the wall,   Cummins put one of his long arms about the boy's shoulders and led him   to the door, where they stood looking out upon the grim desolation of   the forest that rose black and silent against the starlit background   of the sky. High above the thick tops of the spruce rose the lone tree   over the grave, like a dark finger pointing up into the night, and   Cummins' eyes rested there. 
  &quot;She heard you first that night, Jan,&quot; he spoke softly. &quot;She knew  that  you were coming long before I could hear anything but the  crackling in  the skies. I believe&#8212;she knows&#8212;now&#8212;&quot; 
  The arm about Jan's shoulder tightened, and Cummins' head dropped   until his rough cheek rested upon the boy's hair. There was something   of the gentleness of love in what he did, and in response to it Jan   caught the hand that was hanging over his shoulder in both his own. 
  &quot;Boy, won't you tell me who you are, and why you came that night?&quot; 
  &quot;I will tell you, now, that I come from ze Great Bear,&quot; whispered  Jan.  &quot;I am only Jan Thoreau, an' ze great God made me come that night   because&quot;&#8212;his heart throbbed with sudden inspiration as he looked up   into his companion's face&#8212;&quot;because ze leetle M&eacute;lisse was here,&quot; he   finished. 
  For a time Cummins made no move or sound; then he drew the boy back   into the cabin, and from the little gingham-covered box in the corner   he took a buckskin bag. 
  &quot;You are going to Churchill for M&eacute;lisse and for HER&quot; he said in a   voice pitched low that it might not awaken the baby. &quot;Take this.&quot; 
  Jan drew a step back. 
  &quot;No, I fin' work with ze compan-ee at Churchill. That is ze gold  for  M&eacute;lisse when she grow up. Jan Thoreau is no&#8212;what you call heem?&quot; 
  His teeth gleamed in a smile, but it lasted only for an instant.   Cummins' face darkened, and he caught him firmly, almost roughly, by   the arm. 
  &quot;Then Jan Thoreau will never come back to M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he exclaimed  with  finality. &quot;You are going to Churchill to be at school, and not to  work  with your hands. THEY are sending you. Do you understand, boy?  THEY!&quot;  There was a fierce tremor in his voice. &quot;Which will it be? Will  you  take the bag, or will you never again come back to Lac Bain?&quot; 
  Dumbly Jan reached out and took the buckskin pouch. A dull flush   burned in his cheeks. Cummins looked in wonder upon the strange look   that came into his eyes. 
  &quot;I pay back this gold to you and M&eacute;lisse a hundred times!&quot; he cried   tensely. &quot;I swear it, an' I swear that Jan Thoreau mak' no lie!&quot; 
  Unconsciously, with the buckskin bag clutched in one hand, he had   stretched out his other arm to the violin hanging against the wall.   Cummins turned to look. When he faced him again the boy's arm had   fallen to his side and his cheeks were white. 
  The next day he left. No one heard his last words to M&eacute;lisse, or   witnessed his final leave-taking of her, for Cummins sympathized with   the boy's grief and went out of the cabin an hour before Mukee was   ready with his pack. The last that he heard was Jan's violin playing   low, sweet music to the child. Three weeks later, when Mukee returned   to Lac Bain, he said that Jan had traveled to Churchill like one who   had lost his tongue, and that far into the nights he had played lonely   dirges upon his violin.
