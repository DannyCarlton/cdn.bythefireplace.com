  It was utterly dark in the cabin, when the stillness was broken by   low voices outside. The door opened, and some one came in. A  moment  later a match flared up, and in the shifting glow of it  Carrigan saw  the dark face of Bateese, the half-breed. One after  another he lighted  the four lamps. Not until he had finished did  he turn toward the bed.  It was then that David had his first good  impression of the man. He  was not tall, but built with the  strength of a giant. His arms were  long. His shoulders were  stooped. His head was like the head of a  stone gargoyle come to  life. Wide-eyed, heavy-lipped, with the high  cheek-bones of an  Indian and uncut black hair bound with the knotted  red MOUCHOIR,  he looked more than ever like a pirate and a cutthroat  to David.  Such a man, he thought, might make play out of the business  of  murder. And yet, in spite of his ugliness, David felt again the   mysterious inclination to like the man. 
  Bateese grinned. It was a huge grin, for his mouth was big. &quot;You   ver' lucky fellow,&quot; he announced. &quot;You sleep lak that in nice sof  bed  an' not back on san'-bar, dead lak ze feesh I bring you,  m'sieu. That  ees wan beeg mistake. Bateese say, 'Tie ze stone  roun' hees neck an'  mak' heem wan ANGE DE MER. Chuck heem in ze  river, MA BELLE Jeanne!'  An' she say no, mak heem well, an' feed  heem feesh. So I bring ze  feesh which she promise, an' when you  have eat, I tell you somet'ing!&quot; 
  He returned to the door and brought back with him a wicker basket.   Then he drew up the table beside Carrigan and proceeded to lay out   before him the boiled fish which St. Pierre's wife had promised  him.  With it was bread and an earthen pot of hot tea. 
  &quot;She say that ees all you have because of ze fever. Bateese say,   'Stuff heem wit' much so that he die queek!'&quot; 
  &quot;You want to see me dead. Is that it, Bateese?&quot; 
  &quot;OUI. You mak' wan ver' good dead man, m'sieu!&quot; Bateese was no   longer grinning. He stood back and pointed at the food. &quot;You eat&#8212;   queek. An' when you have finish' I tell you somet'ing!&quot; 
  Now that he saw the luscious bit of whitefish before him, Carrigan   was possessed of the hungering emptiness of three days and nights.  As  he ate, he observed that Bateese was performing curious duties.  He  straightened a couple of rugs, ran fresh water into the flower  vases,  picked up half a dozen scattered magazines, and then, to  David's  increasing interest, produced a dust-cloth from somewhere  and began to  dust. David finished his fish, the one slice of  bread, and his cup of  tea. He felt tremendously good. The hot tea  was like a trickle of new  life through every vein in his body, and  he had the desire to get up  and try out his legs. Suddenly Bateese  discovered that his patient was  laughing at him. 
  &quot;QUE DIABLE!&quot; he demanded, coming up ferociously with the cloth in   his great hand. &quot;You see somet'ing ver' fonny, m'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;No, nothing funny, Bateese,&quot; grinned Carrigan. &quot;I was just   thinking what a handsome chambermaid you make. You are so gentle,  so  nice to look at, so&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;DIABLE!&quot; exploded Bateese, dropping his dust cloth and bringing   his huge hands down upon the table with a smash that almost  wrecked  the dishes. &quot;You have eat, an' now you lissen. You have  never hear'  before of Concombre Bateese. An' zat ees me. See! Wit'  these two hands  I have choke' ze polar bear to deat'. I am  strongest man w'at ees in  all nort' countree. I pack four hundre'  pound ovair portage. I crack  ze caribou bones wit' my teeth, lak a  dog. I run sixt' or hundre'  miles wit'out stop for rest. I pull  down trees w'at oder man cut wit'  axe. I am not 'fraid of not'ing.  You lissen? You hear w'at I say?&quot; 
  &quot;I hear you.&quot; 
  &quot;BIEN! Then I tell you w'at Concombre Bateese ees goin' do wit'   you, M'sieu Sergent de Police! MA BELLE Jeanne she mak' wan gran'   meestake. She too much leetle bird heart, too much pity for want  you  to die. Bateese say, 'Keel him, so no wan know w'at happen  t'ree day  ago behin' ze rock.' But MA BELLE Jeanne, she say, 'No,  Bateese, he  ees meestake for oder man, an' we mus' let heem live.'  An' then she  tell me to come an' bring you feesh, an' tell you  w'at is goin' happen  if you try go away from thees bateau. You  COMPREN'? If you try run  away, Bateese ees goin' keel you! See&#8212;  wit' thees han's I br'ak your  neck an' t'row you in river. MA  BELLE Jeanne say do zat, an' she tell  oder mans-twent', thirt',  almos' hundre' GARCONS&#8212;to keel you if you  try run away. She tell  me bring zat word to you wit' ze feesh. You  listen hard w'at I  say?&quot; 
  If ever a worker of iniquity lived on earth, Carrigan might have   judged Bateese as that man in these moments. The half-breed had   worked himself up to a ferocious pitch. His eyes rolled. His wide   mouth snarled in the virulence of its speech. His thick neck grew   corded, and his huge hands clenched menacingly upon the table. Yet   David had no fear. He wanted to laugh, but he knew laughter would  be  the deadliest of insults to Bateese just now. He remembered  that the  half-breed, fierce as a pirate, had a touch as gentle as  a woman's.  This man, who could choke an ox with his monstrous  hands, had a moment  before petted a cat, straightened out rugs,  watered the woman's  flowers, and had dusted. He was harmless&#8212;now.  And yet in the same  breath David sensed the fact that a single  word from St. Pierre's wife  would be sufficient to fire his brute  strength into a blazing volcano  of action. Such a henchman was  priceless&#8212;under certain conditions!  And he had brought a warning  straight from the woman. 
  &quot;I think I understand what you mean, Bateese,&quot; he said. &quot;She says   that I am to make no effort to leave this bateau&#8212;that I am to be   killed if I try to escape? Are you sure she said that?&quot; 
  &quot;PAR LES MILLE CORNES DU DIABLE, you t'ink Bateese lie, m'sieu?   Concombre Bateese, who choke ze w'ite bear wit' hees two ban', who   pull down ze tree&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;No, no, I don't think you lie. But I am wondering why she didn't   tell me that when she was here.&quot; 
  &quot;Becaus' she have too much leetle bird heart, zat ees w'y. She   say: 'Bateese, you tell heem he mus' wait for St. Pierre. An' you   tell heem good an' hard, lak you choke ze w'ite bear an' lak you  pull  down ze tree, so he mak' no meestake an' try get away.' An'  she tell  zat before all ze BATELIERS&#8212;all ze St. Pierre mans  gathered 'bout a  beeg fire&#8212;an' they shout up lak wan gargon that  they watch an' keel  you if you try get away.&quot; 
  Carrigan reached out a hand. &quot;Let's shake, Bateese. I'll give you   my word that I won't try to escape&#8212;not until you and I have a  good  stand-up fight with the earth under our feet, and I've  whipped you. Is  it a go?&quot; 
  Bateese stared for a moment, and then his face broke into a wide   grin. &quot;You lak ze fight, m'sieu?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. I love a scrap with a good man like you.&quot; 
  One of Bateese's huge hands crawled slowly over the table and   engulfed David's. Joy shone on his face. 
  &quot;An' you promise give me zat fight, w'en you are strong?&quot; 
  &quot;If I don't, I'll let you tie a stone around my neck and drop me   into the river.&quot; 
  &quot;You are brave GARCON,&quot; cried the delighted Bateese. &quot;Up an' down   ze rivers ees no man w'at can whip Concombre Bateese!&quot; Suddenly  his  face grew clouded. &quot;But ze head, m'sieu?&quot; he added anxiously. 
  &quot;It will get well quickly if you will help me, Bateese. Right now   I want to get up. I want to stretch my legs. Was my head bad?&quot; 
  &quot;NON. Ze bullet scrape ze ha'r off&#8212;so&#8212;so&#8212;an' turn ze brain   seek. I t'ink you be good fighting man in week!&quot; 
  &quot;And you will help me up?&quot; 
  Bateese was a changed man. Again David felt that mighty but gentle   strength of his arms as he helped him to his feet. He was a trifle   unsteady for a moment. Then, with the half-breed close at his  side,  ready to catch him if his legs gave way, he walked to one of  the  windows and looked out. Across the river, fully half a mile  away, he  saw the glow of fires. 
  &quot;Her camp?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;OUI, m'sieu.&quot; 
  &quot;We have moved from the tar-sands?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, two days down ze river.&quot; 
  &quot;Why are they not camping over here with us?&quot; 
  Bateese gave a disgusted grunt. &quot;Becaus' MA BELLE Jeanne have such   leetle bird heart, m'sieu. She say you mus' not have noise near,  lak  ze talk an' laugh an' ZE CHANSONS. She say it disturb, an' zat  it rnak  you worse wit' ze fever. She ees mak you lak de baby,  Bateese say to  her. But she on'y laugh at zat an' snap her leetle  w'ite finger. Wait  St. Pierre come! He brak yo'r head wit' hees  two fists. I hope we have  ze fight before then, m'sieu!&quot; 
  &quot;We'll have it anyway, Bateese. Where is St. Pierre, and when   shall we see him?&quot; 
  Bateese shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Mebby week, mebby more. He long   way off.&quot; 
  &quot;Is he an old man?&quot; 
  Slowly Bateese turned David about until he was facing him. &quot;You   ask not'ing more about St. Pierre,&quot; he warned. &quot;No mans talk 'bout   St. Pierre. Only wan&#8212;MA BELLE Jeanne. You ask her, an' she tell  you  shut up. W'en you don't shut up she call Bateese to brak your  head.&quot; 
  &quot;You're a&#8212;a sort of all-round head-breaker, as I understand it,&quot;   grunted David, walking slowly back to his bed. &quot;Will you bring me  my  pack and clothes in the morning? I want to shave and dress.&quot; 
  Bateese was ahead of him, smoothing the pillows and straightening   out the rumpled bed-clothes. His huge hands were quick and capable  as  a woman's, and David could not keep himself from chuckling at  this  feminine ingeniousness of the powerful half-breed. Once in  the crush  of those gorilla-like arms that were working over his  bed now, he  thought, and it would be all over with the strongest  man in &quot;N&quot;  Division. Bateese heard the chuckle and looked up. 
  &quot;Somet'ing ver' funny once more, is eet&#8212;w'at?&quot; he demanded. 
  &quot;I was thinking, Bateese&#8212;what will happen to me if you get me in   those arms when we fight? But it isn't going to happen. I fight  with  my fists, and I'm going to batter you up so badly that nobody  will  recognize you for a long time.&quot; 
  &quot;You wait!&quot; exploded Bateese, making a horrible grimace. &quot;I choke   you lak w'ite bear, I t'row you ovair my should'r, I mash you lak   leetle strawberr', I&#8212;&quot; He paused in his task to advance with a   formidable gesture. 
  &quot;Not now,&quot; warned Carrigan. &quot;I'm still a bit groggy, Bateese.&quot; He   pointed down at the bed. &quot;I'm driving HER from that,&quot; he said. &quot;I   don't like it. Is she sleepin' over there&#8212;in the camp?&quot; 
  &quot;Mebby&#8212;an' mebby not, m'sieu,&quot; growled Bateese. &quot;You mak' guess,   eh?&quot; 
  He began extinguishing the lights, until only the one nearest the   door was left burning. He did not turn toward Carrigan or speak to   him again. When he Went out, David heard the click of a lock in  the  door. Bateese had not exaggerated. It was the intention of St.   Pierre's wife that he should consider himself a prisoner&#8212;at least   for tonight. 
  He had no desire to lie down again. There was an unsteadiness in   his legs, but outside of that the evil of his sickness no longer   oppressed him. The staff doctor at the Landing would probably have   called him a fool for not convalescing in the usual prescribed  way,  but Carrigan was already beginning to feel the demand for  action. In  spite of what physical effort he had made, his head did  not hurt him,  and his mind was keenly alive. He returned to the  window through which  he could see the fires on the western shore,  and found no difficulty  in opening it. A strong screen netting  kept him from thrusting out his  head and shoulders. Through it  came the cool night breeze of the  river. It seemed good to fill  his lungs with it again and smell the  fresh aroma of the forest.  It was very dark, and the fires across the  river were brighter  because of the deep gloom. There was no promise of  the moon in the  sky. He could not see a star. From far in the west he  caught the  low intonation of thunder. 
  Carrigan turned from the window to the end of the cabin in which   the piano stood. Here, too, was the second divan, and he saw the   meaning now of two close-tied curtains, one at each side of the   cabin. Drawn together on a taut wire stretched two inches under  the  ceiling, they shut off this end of the bateau and turned at  least a  third of the cabin into the privacy of the woman's  bedroom. With  growing uneasiness David saw the evidences that this  had been her  sleeping apartment. At each side of the piano was a  small door, and he  opened one of these just enough to discover  that it was a wardrobe  closet. A third door opened on the shore  side of the bateau, but this  was locked. Shut out from the view of  the lower end of the cabin by a  Japanese screen were a small  dresser and a mirror. In the dim  illumination that came from the  distant lamp David bent over the open  sheet of music on the piano.  It was Mascagni's AVE MARIA. 
  His blood tingled. His brain was stirred by a new emotion, a   growing thing that made him uneasy and filled him with a strange   restlessness. He felt as though he had come suddenly to the edge  of a  great danger; somewhere within him an intelligence seized  upon it and  understood. Yet it was not physical enough for him to  fight. It was a  danger which crept up and about him, something  which he could not see  or touch and yet which made his heart beat  faster and the blood come  into his face. It drew him, triumphed  over him, dragged his hand forth  until his fingers closed upon a  lacy, crumpled bit of a handkerchief  that lay on the edge of the  piano keys. It was the woman's  handkerchief, and like a thief he  raised it slowly. It smelled faintly  of crushed violets; it was as  if she were bending over him in his  sickness again, and it was her  breath that came to him. He was not  thinking of her as St.  Pierre's wife. And then sharply he caught  himself and placed the  handkerchief back on the piano keys. He tried  to laugh at himself,  but there was an emptiness where a moment before  there had been  that thrill of which he was now ashamed. 
  He turned back to the window. The thunder had come nearer. It was   coming up fast out of the west, and with it a darkness that was  like  the blackness of a pit. A dead stillness was preceding it  now, and in  that stillness it seemed to Carrigan that he could  hear the soapy,  slitting sound of the streaming flashes of  electrical fire that  blazoned the advance of the storm. The camp-  fires across the river  were dying down. One of them went out as he  looked at it, and he  stared into the darkness as if trying to  pierce distance and gloom to  see what sort of a shelter it was  that St. Pierre's wife had over  there. And there came over him in  these moments a desire that was  almost cowardly. It was the desire  to escape, to leave behind him the  memory of the rock and of St.  Pierre's wife, and to pursue once more  his own great adventure,  the quest of Black Roger Audemard. 
  He heard the rain coming. At first the sound of it was like the   pattering of ten million tiny feet in dry leaves; then, suddenly,  it  was like the roar of an avalanche. It was an inundation, and  with it  came crash after crash of thunder, and the black skies  were illumined  by an almost uninterrupted glare of lightning. It  had been a long time  since Carrigan had felt the shock of such a  storm. He closed the  window to keep the rain out, and after that  stood with his face  flattened against the glass, staring over the  river. The camp-fires  were all gone now, blotted out like so many  candles snuffed between  thumb and forefinger, and he shuddered. No  canvas ever made would keep  that deluge out. And now there was  growing up a wind with it. The  tents on the other side would be  beaten down like pegged sheets of  paper, ripped up and torn to  pieces. He imagined St. Pierre's wife in  that tumult and distress  &#8212;the breath blown out of her, half drowned,  blinded by deluge and  lightning, broken and beaten because of him.  Thought of her  companions did not ease his mind. Human hands were  entirely  inadequate to cope with a storm like this that was rocking  the  earth about him. 
  Suddenly he went to the door, determined that if Bateese was   outside he would get some satisfaction out of him or challenge him  to  a fight right there. He beat against it, first with one fist  and then  with both. He shouted. There was no response. Then he  exerted his  strength and his weight against the door. It was  solid. 
  He was half turned when his eyes discovered, in a corner where the   lamplight struck dimly, his pack and clothes. In thirty seconds he   had his pipe and tobacco. After that for half an hour he paced up  and  down the cabin, while the storm crashed and thundered sif  bent upon  destroying all life off the face of the earth. 
  Comforted by the company of his pipe, Carrigan did not beat at the   door again. He waited, and at the end of another half-hour the  storm  had softened down into a steady patter of rain. The thunder  had  traveled east, and the lightning had gone with it. David  opened the  window again. The air that came in was rain-sweet,  soft, and warm. He  puffed out a cloud of smoke and smiled. His  pipe always brought his  good humor to the surface, even in the  worst places. St. Pierre's wife  had certainly had a good soaking.  And in a way the whole thing was a  bit funny. He was thinking now  of a poor little golden-plumaged  partridge, soaked to the skin,  with its tail-feathers dragging  pathetically. Grinning, he told  himself that it was an insult to think  of her and a half-drowned  partridge in the same breath. But the simile  still remained, and  he chuckled. Probably she was wringing out her  clothes now, and  the men were cursing under their breath while trying  to light a  fire. He watched for the fire. It failed to appear.  Probably she  was hating him for bringing all this discomfort and  humiliation  upon her. It was not impossible that tomorrow she would  give  Bateese permission to brain him. And St. Pierre? What would this   man, her husband, think and do if he knew that his wife had given  up  her bedroom to this stranger? What complications might arise IF  HE  KNEW! 
  It was late&#8212;past midnight&#8212;when Carrigan went to bed. Even then   he did not sleep for a long time. The patter of the rain grew less   and less on the roof of the bateau, and as the sound of it droned   itself off into nothingness, slumber came. David was conscious of  the  moment when the rain ceased entirely. Then he slept. At least  he must  have been very close to sleep, or had been asleep and was  returning  for a moment close to consciousness, when he heard a  voice. It came  several times before he was roused enough to  realize that it was a  voice. And then, suddenly, piercing his  slowly wakening brain almost  with the shock of one of the thunder  crashes, it came to him so  distinctly that he found himself  sitting up straight, his hands  clenched, eyes staring in the  darkness, waiting for it to come again. 
  Somewhere very near him, in his room, within the reach of his   hands, a strange and indescribable voice had cried out in the   darkness the words which twice before had beat themselves   mysteriously into David Carrigan's brain&#8212;&quot;HAS ANY ONE SEEN BLACK   ROGER AUDEMARD? HAS ANY ONE SEEN BLACK ROGER AUDEMARD?&quot; 
  And David, holding his breath, listened for the sound of another   breath which he knew was in that room.
