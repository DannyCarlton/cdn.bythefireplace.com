  That same morning two big canoes set out across Lake Nipigon for  Wabigoon and John Ball. Mukoki returned with the canoes, but Rod  remained at the Post, and not a moment's rest did he have during the  whole of that day from the eager questions of those whom he had so  completely surprised by his unexpected return. Few stories could have  been more thrilling than his, though he told it in the simplest manner  possible. Rod's appearance more than his words was evidence of the  trials he and his companions had passed through. His face was emaciated  to startling thinness by desperate exertion and lack of sleep, and both  his face and his hands were covered with scratches and bruises. Not  until late in the afternoon did he go to bed, and it was noon the  following day when he awoke from his heavy slumber.
  The canoes had returned, and John Ball was in the doctor's care. At  dinner Rod and Wabi were made to go over their adventures again, and  even Mukoki, who had joined them in this reunion, was not allowed to  escape the endless questioning of Minnetaki, the factor's wife, and  Rod's mother. Rod was seated at the table between Mrs. Drew and  Minnetaki. Several times during the conversation he felt the young  girl's hand touch his arm. Once, when the factor spoke about their  return to the gold in the cavern, this mysterious signaling of  Minnetaki's took the form of a pinch that made him squirm. Not until  after dinner, and the two were alone, did he begin to comprehend.
  &#8220;I'm ashamed of you, Roderick Drew!&#8221; said the girl, standing before  him in mock displeasure. &#8220;You and Wabi were the stupidest things I ever  saw at dinner! Have you all forgotten your promise to me?&#8212;your promise  that I should go with you on your next trip? I wanted you to speak  about it right there at dinner!&#8221;
  &#8220;But I&#8212;I&#8212;couldn't!&#8221; stammered Rod awkwardly.
  &#8220;But I'm going!&#8221; said Minnetaki decisively. &#8220;I'm going with you boys  on this next trip&#8212;if I have to run away! It's not fair for Wabi and  Mukoki and you to leave me alone all of the time. And, besides, I've  been making all the arrangements while you were gone. I've won over  mamma and your mother, and Maballa, mamma's Indian woman, will go with  me. There's just one who says&#8212;'No!'&#8220; And Minnetaki clasped her hands  pathetically.
  &#8220;And that's papa,&#8221; completed Rod, laughing.
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, if he is the only one against us we stand a good chance of  winning.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm going to have mamma and Wabigoon get him by themselves  to-night,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Papa will do anything on earth for her, and  he thinks Wabi is the best boy on earth. Mamma says she will lock the  door and won't let him out until he has given his promise. Oh, what a  glorious time we'll have!&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps he would go with us,&#8221; suggested Rod.
  &#8220;No, he couldn't leave the Post. If he went Wabi would have to  stay.&#8221;
  Rod was counting on his fingers.
  &#8220;That means six in our next expedition,&#8212;Wabi, Mukoki, John Ball and  myself, and you and Maballa. Why, it'll be a regular picnic party!&#8221;
  Minnetaki's eyes were brimming with fun.
  &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that Maballa thinks Mukoki is just about  the nicest Indian that ever lived? Oh, I'd be so glad if&#8212;if&#8212;&#8221;
  She puckered her mouth into a round, red O, and left Rod to guess  the rest. It was not difficult for him to understand.
  &#8220;So would I,&#8221; he cried. Then he added,
  &#8220;Muky is the best fellow on earth.&#8221;
  &#8220;And Maballa is just as good,&#8221; said the girl loyally.
  The boy held out his hand.
  &#8220;Let's shake on that, Minnetaki! I'll handle Mukoki, you take care  of Maballa. What a picnic this next trip will be!&#8221;
  &#8220;And there'll be lots and lots of adventures, won't there?&#8221; asked  the girl a little anxiously.
  &#8220;Plenty of them.&#8221; Rod became immediately serious. &#8220;This will be the  most important of all our trips, Minnetaki, that is, if John Ball  lives. I haven't told the others, but I believe that great cavern holds  something for us besides gold!&#8221;
  The smile left the girl's face. Her eyes were soft and eager.
  &#8220;You believe that&#8212;Dolores&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know what to believe. But&#8212;we'll find something there!&#8221;
  For an hour Rod and Minnetaki talked of John Ball and of the strange  things he said in his delirium. Then the girl rejoined Mrs. Drew and  the princess mother, while Rod went in search of Mukoki and Wabigoon.  That night the big event happened. George Newsome, the factor, gave a  reluctant consent which meant that Wabi's sister and Maballa would  accompany the adventurers on their next journey into the untraveled  solitudes of Hudson Bay.
  For a week John Ball hovered between life and death. After that his  improvement was slow but sure, and each day added strength to his  emaciated body and a new light to his eyes. At the end of the second  week there was no question but that he was slowly returning to sanity.  Gradually he came to know those who sat beside his bed, and whenever  Rod visited him he insisted on holding the youth's hand. At first the  sight of Minnetaki or her mother, or of Mrs. Drew, had a startling  effect on him and in their presence he would moan ceaselessly the name  Rod first heard in the cavern. A little at a time the language of those  about him came back to the old man, and bit by bit those who waited and  listened and watched learned the story of John Ball. Midsummer came  before he could gather the scattered threads of his life in his memory,  and even then there were breaks in this story which seemed but trivial  things to John Ball, but which to the others meant the passing of  forgotten years.
  In fact, years played but a small part in the strange story that  fell from the old man's lips. &#8220;In time,&#8221; said the Post physician, &#8220;he  will remember everything. Now only the most important happenings in his  life have returned to him.&#8221;
  John Ball could not remember the date when, as a young boy, he left  York Factory, on Hudson Bay, to come a thousand miles down to  civilization in company with the two Frenchmen who killed themselves in  the old cabin. But the slip of paper which Rod had discovered filled  that gap. He was the son of the factor at York Factory, and was to  spend a year at school in Montreal. On their trip down it was the boy  who found gold in the chasm. John Ball could remember none of the  details. He only knew that they remained to gather the treasure, and  that he, as its discoverer and the son of one of the lords of the  Hudson Bay Company, was to receive twice the share of the others, and  that in the autumn they were to return to York Factory instead of going  on to Montreal. He remembered indistinctly a quarrel over the gold, and  after that of writing some sort of agreement, and then, early one  morning, he awoke to find the two Frenchmen standing over him, and  after that, for a long time, everything seemed to pass as in a dream.
  When he awoke into life he was no longer in the chasm, but among a  strange people who were so small that they reached barely to his  shoulders, and who dressed in fur, and carried spears, and though the  sick man said no more about these people those who listened to him knew  that he had wandered far north among the Eskimos. They treated him  kindly, and he lived among them for a long time, hunting and fishing  with them, and sleeping in houses built of ice and snow.
  The next that John Ball remembered was of white people. In some way  he returned to York Factory, and he knew that when this happened many  years had passed, for his father and mother were dead, and there were  strangers at the Post. At this time John Ball must have returned fully  to his reason again. He remembered, faintly, leading several  unsuccessful expeditions in search of the gold which he and the  Frenchmen had discovered, and that once he went to a great city, which  must have been Montreal, and that he stayed there a long time doing  something for the Hudson Bay Company, and met a girl whom he married.  When he spoke of the girl John Ball's eyes would glow feverishly and  her name would fall from him in a moaning sob. For as yet returning  reason had not placed the hand of age upon him. It was as if he was  awakening from a deep sleep, and Dolores, his young wife, had been with  him but a few hours before.
  There came another break in John Ball's life after this. He could  not remember how, long they lived in Montreal, but he knew that after a  time he returned with his wife into the far North, and that they were  very happy, and one summer set off in a canoe to search for the lost  chasm together. They found it. How or when he could not remember. After  this John Ball's story was filled with wild visions of a great black  world where there was neither sun nor moon nor stars, and they found  gold and dug it by the light of fires. And one day the woman went a  little way back in this world and never came back.
  It was then that the old madness returned. In his search for his  lost wife John Ball never found the end of the great cavern. He saw  strange people, he fought great beasts in this black world that were  larger than the biggest moose in the forests, and he told of rushing  torrents and thundering cataracts in the bowels of the earth. Even in  his returning sanity the old man told these things as true.
  George Newsome, the factor, lost no time in writing to the Company  at Montreal, inquiring about John Ball, and a month later he received  word that a man by that name had worked as an inspector of raw furs  during the years 1877 and 1878. He had left Montreal for the North  thirty years before. In all probability he soon after went in search of  the lost gold, and for more than a quarter of a century had lived as a  wild man in the solitudes.
  It was at this time in the convalescence of the doctor's patient  that Roderick's mother made a suggestion which took the Post by storm.  It was that the factor and his family accompany her and Rod back to  civilization for a few weeks' visit. To the astonishment of all, and  especially to Minnetaki and the princess mother, the factor fell in  heartily with the scheme, with the stipulation that the Drews return  with them early in the autumn. An agent from the head office of the  Company had come up for a month's fishing and he cheerfully expressed  his willingness to take charge of affairs at the Post during their  absence.
  The happiness of Rod and Wabi was complete when Mukoki was compelled  to give his promise to go with them. For several days the old warrior  withstood their combined assaults, but at last he surrendered when  Minnetaki put her arms around his neck and nestled her soft cheek  against his leathery face, with the avowal that she would not move a  step unless he went with her.
  So it happened, one beautiful summer morning, that three big canoes  put out into the lake from Wabinosh House and headed into the South,  and only Mukoki, of all the seven who were going down into  civilization, felt something that was not joy as the forests slipped  behind them. For Mukoki was to get a glimpse of a new world, a world  far from the land of his fathers, and the loyal heart inside his  caribou-skin coat quickened its pulse a little as he thought of the  wonderful journey.
  Thus began the journey to civilization.
 
  THE END
