We went to Meran. The place was practically decided for us by  Amelia's French maid, who really acts on such occasions as our  guide and courier.    
She is <i>such</i> a clever girl, is Amelia's French maid. Whenever we  are going anywhere, Amelia generally asks (and accepts) her advice  as to choice of hotels and furnished villas. Cesarine has been all  over the Continent in her time; and, being Alsatian by birth, she of  course speaks German as well as she speaks French, while her long  residence with Amelia has made her at last almost equally at home  in our native English. She is a treasure, that girl; so neat and  dexterous, and not above dabbling in anything on earth she may be  asked to turn her hand to. She walks the world with a needle-case  in one hand and an etna in the other. She can cook an omelette on  occasion, or drive a Norwegian cariole; she can sew, and knit, and  make dresses, and cure a cold, and do anything else on earth you ask  her. Her salads are the most savoury I ever tasted; while as for her  coffee (which she prepares for us in the train on long journeys),  there isn't a chef de cuisine at a West-end club to be named in the  same day with her.    
So, when Amelia said, in her imperious way, "Cesarine, we want to go  to the Tyrol--now--at once--in mid-October; where do you advise us  to put up?"--Cesarine answered, like a shot, "The Erzherzog Johann,  of course, at Meran, for the autumn, madame."    
"Is he ... an archduke?" Amelia asked, a little staggered at such  apparent familiarity with Imperial personages.    
"Ma foi! no, madame. He is an hotel--as you would say in England,  the 'Victoria' or the 'Prince of Wales's'--the most comfortable  hotel in all South Tyrol; and at this time of year, naturally, you  must go beyond the Alps; it begins already to be cold at Innsbruck."    
So to Meran we went; and a prettier or more picturesque place, I  confess, I have seldom set eyes on. A rushing torrent; high hills  and mountain peaks; terraced vineyard slopes; old walls and towers;  quaint, arcaded streets; a craggy waterfall; a promenade after  the fashion of a German Spa; and when you lift your eyes from the  ground, jagged summits of Dolomites: it was a combination such as  I had never before beheld; a Rhine town plumped down among green  Alpine heights, and threaded by the cool colonnades of Italy.    
I approved Cesarine's choice; and I was particularly glad she  had pronounced for an hotel, where all is plain sailing, instead  of advising a furnished villa, the arrangements for which would  naturally have fallen in large part upon the shoulders of the  wretched secretary. As in any case I have to do three hours' work  a day, I feel that such additions to my normal burden may well  be spared me. I tipped Cesarine half a sovereign, in fact, for  her judicious choice. Cesarine glanced at it on her palm in her  mysterious, curious, half-smiling way, and pocketed it at once with  a "Merci, monsieur!" that had a touch of contempt in it. I always  fancy Cesarine has large ideas of her own on the subject of tipping,  and thinks very small beer of the modest sums a mere secretary can  alone afford to bestow upon her.    
The great peculiarity of Meran is the number of schlosses (I believe  my plural is strictly irregular, but very convenient to English  ears) which you can see in every direction from its outskirts. A  statistical eye, it is supposed, can count no fewer than forty of  these picturesque, ramshackled old castles from a point on the  Kuchelberg. For myself, I hate statistics (except as an element in  financial prospectuses), and I really don't know how many ruinous  piles Isabel and Amelia counted under Cesarine's guidance; but I  remember that most of them were quaint and beautiful, and that their  variety of architecture seemed positively bewildering. One would be  square, with funny little turrets stuck out at each angle; while  another would rejoice in a big round keep, and spread on either side  long, ivy-clad walls and delightful bastions. Charles was immensely  taken with them. He loves the picturesque, and has a poet hidden  in that financial soul of his. (Very effectually hidden, though, I  am ready to grant you.) From the moment he came he felt at once  he would love to possess a castle of his own among these romantic  mountains. "Seldon!" he exclaimed contemptuously. "They call Seldon  a castle! But you and I know very well, Sey, it was built in 1860,  with sham antique stones, for Macpherson of Seldon, at market rates,  by Cubitt and Co., worshipful contractors of London. Macpherson  charged me for that sham antiquity a preposterous price, at  which one ought to procure a real ancestral mansion. Now, <i>these</i>  castles are real. They are hoary with antiquity. Schloss Tyrol is  Romanesque--tenth or eleventh century." (He had been reading it up  in Baedeker.) "That's the sort of place for <i>me</i>!--tenth or eleventh  century. I could live here, remote from stocks and shares, for ever;  and in these sequestered glens, recollect, Sey, my boy, there are  no Colonel Clays, and no arch Madame Picardets!"    
As a matter of fact, he could have lived there six weeks, and then  tired for Park Lane, Monte Carlo, Brighton.    
As for Amelia, strange to say, she was equally taken with this new  fad of Charles's. As a rule she hates everywhere on earth save  London, except during the time when no respectable person can be  seen in town, and when modest blinds shade the scandalised face of  Mayfair and Belgravia. She bores herself to death even at Seldon  Castle, Ross-shire, and yawns all day long in Paris or Vienna. She  is a confirmed Cockney. Yet, for some occult reason, my amiable  sister-in-law fell in love with South Tyrol. She wanted to vegetate  in that lush vegetation. The grapes were being picked; pumpkins hung  over the walls; Virginia creeper draped the quaint gray schlosses  with crimson cloaks; and everything was as beautiful as a dream of  Burne-Jones's. (I know I am quite right in mentioning Burne-Jones,  especially in connection with Romanesque architecture, because I  heard him highly praised on that very ground by our friend and  enemy, Dr. Edward Polperro.) So perhaps it was excusable that  Amelia should fall in love with it all, under the circumstances;  besides, she is largely influenced by what Cesarine says, and  Cesarine declares there is no climate in Europe like Meran in  winter. I do not agree with her. The sun sets behind the hills at  three in the afternoon, and a nasty warm wind blows moist over  the snow in January and February.    
However, Amelia set Cesarine to inquire of the people at the hotel  about the market price of tumbledown ruins, and the number of such  eligible family mausoleums just then for sale in the immediate  neighbourhood. Cesarine returned with a full, true, and particular  list, adorned with flowers of rhetoric which would have delighted  the soul of good old John Robins. They were all picturesque, all  Romanesque, all richly ivy-clad, all commodious, all historical,  and all the property of high well-born Grafs and very honourable  Freiherrs. Most of them had been the scene of celebrated tournaments;  several of them had witnessed the gorgeous marriages of Holy Roman  Emperors; and every one of them was provided with some choice and  selected first-class murders. Ghosts could be arranged for or not,  as desired; and armorial bearings could be thrown in with the moat  for a moderate extra remuneration.    
The two we liked best of all these tempting piles were Schloss  Planta and Schloss Lebenstein. We drove past both, and even I  myself, I confess, was distinctly taken with them. (Besides, when  a big purchase like this is on the stocks, a poor beggar of a  secretary has always a chance of exerting his influence and earning  for himself some modest commission.) Schloss Planta was the most  striking externally, I should say, with its Rhine-like towers, and  its great gnarled ivy-stems, that looked as if they antedated the  House of Hapsburg; but Lebenstein was said to be better preserved  within, and more fitted in every way for modern occupation. Its  staircase has been photographed by 7000 amateurs.    
We got tickets to view. The invaluable Cesarine procured them for  us. Armed with these, we drove off one fine afternoon, meaning to  go to Planta, by Cesarine's recommendation. Half-way there, however,  we changed our minds, as it was such a lovely day, and went on up  the long, slow hill to Lebenstein. I must say the drive through the  grounds was simply charming. The castle stands perched (say rather  poised, like St. Michael the archangel in Italian pictures) on a  solitary stack or crag of rock, looking down on every side upon  its own rich vineyards. Chestnuts line the glens; the valley of  the Etsch spreads below like a picture.    
The vineyards alone make a splendid estate, by the way; they produce  a delicious red wine, which is exported to Bordeaux, and there  bottled and sold as a vintage claret under the name of Chateau  Monnivet. Charles revelled in the idea of growing his own wines.    
"Here we could sit," he cried to Amelia, "in the most literal sense,  under our own vine and fig-tree. Delicious retirement! For my part,  I'm sick and tired of the hubbub of Threadneedle Street."    
We knocked at the door--for there was really no bell, but a  ponderous, old-fashioned, wrought-iron knocker. So deliciously  mediaeval! The late Graf von Lebenstein had recently died, we  knew; and his son, the present Count, a young man of means, having  inherited from his mother's family a still more ancient and  splendid schloss in the Salzburg district, desired to sell this  outlying estate in order to afford himself a yacht, after the manner  that is now becoming increasingly fashionable with the noblemen and  gentlemen in Germany and Austria.    
The door was opened for us by a high well-born menial, attired in  a very ancient and honourable livery. Nice antique hall; suits of  ancestral armour, trophies of Tyrolese hunters, coats of arms of  ancient counts--the very thing to take Amelia's aristocratic and  romantic fancy. The whole to be sold exactly as it stood; ancestors  to be included at a valuation.    
We went through the reception-rooms. They were lofty, charming, and  with glorious views, all the more glorious for being framed by those  graceful Romanesque windows, with their slender pillars and quaint,  round-topped arches. Sir Charles had made his mind up. "I must and  will have it!" he cried. "This is the place for me. Seldon! Pah,  Seldon is a modern abomination."    
Could we see the high well-born Count? The liveried servant  (somewhat haughtily) would inquire of his Serenity. Sir Charles  sent up his card, and also Lady Vandrift's. These foreigners know  title spells money in England.    
He was right in his surmise. Two minutes later the Count entered  with our cards in his hands. A good-looking young man, with the  characteristic Tyrolese long black moustache, dressed in a  gentlemanly variant on the costume of the country. His air was a  jager's; the usual blackcock's plume stuck jauntily in the side of  the conical hat (which he held in his hand), after the universal  Austrian fashion.    
He waved us to seats. We sat down. He spoke to us in French; his  English, he remarked, with a pleasant smile, being a negligeable  quantity. We might speak it, he went on; he could understand pretty  well; but he preferred to answer, if we would allow him, in French  or German.    
"French," Charles replied, and the negotiation continued thenceforth  in that language. It is the only one, save English and his ancestral  Dutch, with which my brother-in-law possesses even a nodding  acquaintance.    
We praised the beautiful scene. The Count's face lighted up with  patriotic pride. Yes; it was beautiful, beautiful, his own green  Tyrol. He was proud of it and attached to it. But he could endure  to sell this place, the home of his fathers, because he had a finer  in the Salzkammergut, and a pied-a-terre near Innsbruck. For Tyrol  lacked just one joy--the sea. He was a passionate yachtsman. For  that he had resolved to sell this estate; after all, three country  houses, a ship, and a mansion in Vienna, are more than one man can  comfortably inhabit.    
"Exactly," Charles answered. "If I can come to terms with you about  this charming estate I shall sell my own castle in the Scotch  Highlands." And he tried to look like a proud Scotch chief who  harangues his clansmen.    
Then they got to business. The Count was a delightful man to do  business with. His manners were perfect. While we were talking to  him, a surly person, a steward or bailiff, or something of the sort,  came into the room unexpectedly and addressed him in German, which  none of us understand. We were impressed by the singular urbanity  and benignity of the nobleman's demeanour towards this sullen  dependant. He evidently explained to the fellow what sort of  people we were, and remonstrated with him in a very gentle way for  interrupting us. The steward understood, and clearly regretted his  insolent air; for after a few sentences he went out, and as he did  so he bowed and made protestations of polite regard in his own  language. The Count turned to us and smiled. "Our people," he said,  "are like your own Scotch peasants--kind-hearted, picturesque, free,  musical, poetic, but wanting, helas, in polish to strangers." He  was certainly an exception, if he described them aright; for he made  us feel at home from the moment we entered.    
He named his price in frank terms. His lawyers at Meran held the  needful documents, and would arrange the negotiations in detail with  us. It was a stiff sum, I must say--an extremely stiff sum; but no  doubt he was charging us a fancy price for a fancy castle. "He will  come down in time," Charles said. "The sum first named in all these  transactions is invariably a feeler. They know I'm a millionaire;  and people always imagine millionaires are positively made of  money."    
I may add that people always imagine it must be easier to squeeze  money out of millionaires than out of other people--which is the  reverse of the truth, or how could they ever have amassed their  millions? Instead of oozing gold as a tree oozes gum, they mop it  up like blotting-paper, and seldom give it out again.    
We drove back from this first interview none the less very well  satisfied. The price was too high; but preliminaries were arranged,  and for the rest, the Count desired us to discuss all details with  his lawyers in the chief street, Unter den Lauben. We inquired about  these lawyers, and found they were most respectable and respected  men; they had done the family business on either side for seven  generations.    
They showed us plans and title-deeds. Everything quite en regle.  Till we came to the price there was no hitch of any sort.    
As to price, however, the lawyers were obdurate. They stuck out for  the Count's first sum to the uttermost florin. It was a very big  estimate. We talked and shilly-shallied till Sir Charles grew angry.  He lost his temper at last.    
"They know I'm a millionaire, Sey," he said, "and they're playing  the old game of trying to diddle me. But I won't be diddled. Except  Colonel Clay, no man has ever yet succeeded in bleeding me. And  shall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these  innocent mountains? Perish the thought!" Then he reflected a little  in silence. "Sey," he mused on, at last, "the question is, <i>are</i>  they innocent? Do you know, I begin to believe there is no such  thing left as pristine innocence anywhere. This Tyrolese Count knows  the value of a pound as distinctly as if he hung out in Capel Court  or Kimberley."    
Things dragged on in this way, inconclusively, for a week or two.  <i>We</i> bid down; the lawyers stuck to it. Sir Charles grew half sick  of the whole silly business. For my own part, I felt sure if the  high well-born Count didn't quicken his pace, my respected relative  would shortly have had enough of the Tyrol altogether, and be proof  against the most lovely of crag-crowning castles. But the Count  didn't see it. He came to call on us at our hotel--a rare honour for  a stranger with these haughty and exclusive Tyrolese nobles--and  even entered unannounced in the most friendly manner. But when it  came to L. s. d., he was absolute adamant. Not one kreutzer would  he abate from his original proposal.    
"You misunderstand," he said, with pride. "We Tyrolese gentlemen are  not shopkeepers or merchants. We do not higgle. If we say a thing we  stick to it. Were you an Austrian, I should feel insulted by your  ill-advised attempt to beat down my price. But as you belong to a  great commercial nation--" he broke off with a snort and shrugged  his shoulders compassionately.    
We saw him several times driving in and out of the schloss, and  every time he waved his hand at us gracefully. But when we tried to  bargain, it was always the same thing: he retired behind the shelter  of his Tyrolese nobility. We might take it or leave it. 'Twas still  Schloss Lebenstein.    
The lawyers were as bad. We tried all we knew, and got no forrarder.    
At last Charles gave up the attempt in disgust. He was tiring, as I  expected. "It's the prettiest place I ever saw in my life," he said;  "but, hang it all, Sey, I <i>won't</i> be imposed upon."    
So he made up his mind, it being now December, to return to London.  We met the Count next day, and stopped his carriage, and told him  so. Charles thought this would have the immediate effect of bringing  the man to reason. But he only lifted his hat, with the blackcock's  feather, and smiled a bland smile. "The Archduke Karl is inquiring  about it," he answered, and drove on without parley.    
Charles used some strong words, which I will not transcribe (I am a  family man), and returned to England.    
For the next two months we heard little from Amelia save her regret  that the Count wouldn't sell us Schloss Lebenstein. Its pinnacles  had fairly pierced her heart. Strange to say, she was absolutely  infatuated about the castle. She rather wanted the place while  she was there, and thought she could get it; now she thought  she couldn't, her soul (if she has one) was wildly set upon it.  Moreover, Cesarine further inflamed her desire by gently hinting  a fact which she had picked up at the courier's table d'hote at  the hotel--that the Count had been far from anxious to sell his  ancestral and historical estate to a South African diamond king.  He thought the honour of the family demanded, at least, that he  should secure a wealthy buyer of good ancient lineage.    
One morning in February, however, Amelia returned from the Row all  smiles and tremors. (She had been ordered horse-exercise to correct  the increasing excessiveness of her figure.)    
"Who do you think I saw riding in the Park?" she inquired. "Why,  the Count of Lebenstein."    
"No!" Charles exclaimed, incredulous.    
"Yes," Amelia answered.    
"Must be mistaken," Charles cried.    
But Amelia stuck to it. More than that, she sent out emissaries to  inquire diligently from the London lawyers, whose name had been  mentioned to us by the ancestral firm in Unter den Lauben as  their English agents, as to the whereabouts of our friend; and  her emissaries learned in effect that the Count was in town and  stopping at Morley's.    
"I see through it," Charles exclaimed. "He finds he's made a  mistake; and now he's come over here to reopen negotiations."    
I was all for waiting prudently till the Count made the first move.  "Don't let him see your eagerness," I said. But Amelia's ardour  could not now be restrained. She insisted that Charles should  call on the Graf as a mere return of his politeness in the Tyrol.    
He was as charming as ever. He talked to us with delight about the  quaintness of London. He would be ravished to dine next evening with  Sir Charles. He desired his respectful salutations meanwhile to  Miladi Vandrift and Madame Ventvorth.    
He dined with us, almost en famille. Amelia's cook did wonders. In  the billiard-room, about midnight, Charles reopened the subject.  The Count was really touched. It pleased him that still, amid the  distractions of the City of Five Million Souls, we should remember  with affection his beloved Lebenstein.    
"Come to my lawyers," he said, "to-morrow, and I will talk it all  over with you."    
We went--a most respectable firm in Southampton Row; old family  solicitors. They had done business for years for the late Count, who  had inherited from his grandmother estates in Ireland; and they were  glad to be honoured with the confidence of his successor. Glad, too,  to make the acquaintance of a prince of finance like Sir Charles  Vandrift. Anxious (rubbing their hands) to arrange matters  satisfactorily all round for everybody. (Two capital families with  which to be mixed up, you see.)    
Sir Charles named a price, and referred them to his solicitors.  The Count named a higher, but still a little come-down, and left  the matter to be settled between the lawyers. He was a soldier and  a gentleman, he said, with a Tyrolese toss of his high-born head;  he would abandon details to men of business.    
As I was really anxious to oblige Amelia, I met the Count  accidentally next day on the steps of Morley's. (Accidentally,  that is to say, so far as he was concerned, though I had been  hanging about in Trafalgar Square for half an hour to see him.)  I explained, in guarded terms, that I had a great deal of influence  in my way with Sir Charles; and that a word from me-- I broke  off. He stared at me blankly.    
"Commission?" he inquired, at last, with a queer little smile.    
"Well, not exactly commission," I answered, wincing. "Still, a  friendly word, you know. One good turn deserves another."    
He looked at me from head to foot with a curious scrutiny. For one  moment I feared the Tyrolese nobleman in him was going to raise its  foot and take active measures. But the next, I saw that Sir Charles  was right after all, and that pristine innocence has removed from  this planet to other quarters.    
He named his lowest price. "M. Ventvorth," he said, "I am a Tyrolese  seigneur; I do not dabble, myself, in commissions and percentages.  But if your influence with Sir Charles--we understand each other, do  we not?--as between gentlemen--a little friendly present--no money,  of course--but the equivalent of say 5 per cent in jewellery, on  whatever sum above his bid to-day you induce him to  offer--eh?--c'est convenu?"    
"Ten per cent is more usual," I murmured.    
He was the Austrian hussar again. "Five, monsieur--or nothing!"    
I bowed and withdrew. "Well, five then," I answered, "just to oblige  your Serenity."    
A secretary, after all, can do a great deal. When it came to the  scratch, I had but little difficulty in persuading Sir Charles, with  Amelia's aid, backed up on either side by Isabel and Cesarine, to  accede to the Count's more reasonable proposal. The Southampton Row  people had possession of certain facts as to the value of the wines  in the Bordeaux market which clinched the matter. In a week or two  all was settled; Charles and I met the Count by appointment in  Southampton Row, and saw him sign, seal, and deliver the title-deeds  of Schloss Lebenstein. My brother-in-law paid the purchase-money  into the Count's own hands, by cheque, crossed on a first-class  London firm where the Count kept an account to his high well-born  order. Then he went away with the proud knowledge that he was owner  of Schloss Lebenstein. And what to me was more important still,  I received next morning by post a cheque for the five per cent,  unfortunately drawn, by some misapprehension, to my order on the  self-same bankers, and with the Count's signature. He explained in  the accompanying note that the matter being now quite satisfactorily  concluded, he saw no reason of delicacy why the amount he had  promised should not be paid to me forthwith direct in money.    
I cashed the cheque at once, and said nothing about the affair, not  even to Isabel. My experience is that women are not to be trusted  with intricate matters of commission and brokerage.    
Though it was now late in March, and the House was sitting, Charles  insisted that we must all run over at once to take possession of our  magnificent Tyrolese castle. Amelia was almost equally burning with  eagerness. She gave herself the airs of a Countess already. We took  the Orient Express as far as Munich; then the Brenner to Meran,  and put up for the night at the Erzherzog Johann. Though we had  telegraphed our arrival, and expected some fuss, there was no  demonstration. Next morning we drove out in state to the schloss,  to enter into enjoyment of our vines and fig-trees.    
We were met at the door by the surly steward. "I shall dismiss  that man," Charles muttered, as Lord of Lebenstein. "He's too  sour-looking for my taste. Never saw such a brute. Not a smile  of welcome!"    
He mounted the steps. The surly man stepped forward and murmured a  few morose words in German. Charles brushed him aside and strode on.  Then there followed a curious scene of mutual misunderstanding. The  surly man called lustily for his servants to eject us. It was some  time before we began to catch at the truth. The surly man was the  <i>real</i> Graf von Lebenstein.    
And the Count with the moustache? It dawned upon us now. Colonel  Clay again! More audacious than ever!    
Bit by bit it all came out. He had ridden behind us the first day  we viewed the place, and, giving himself out to the servants as  one of our party, had joined us in the reception-room. We asked  the real Count why he had spoken to the intruder. The Count  explained in French that the man with the moustache had introduced  my brother-in-law as the great South African millionaire, while he  described himself as our courier and interpreter. As such he had  had frequent interviews with the real Graf and his lawyers in  Meran, and had driven almost daily across to the castle. The owner  of the estate had named one price from the first, and had stuck to  it manfully. He stuck to it still; and if Sir Charles chose to buy  Schloss Lebenstein over again he was welcome to have it. How the  London lawyers had been duped the Count had not really the slightest  idea. He regretted the incident, and (coldly) wished us a very good  morning.    
There was nothing for it but to return as best we might to the  Erzherzog Johann, crestfallen, and telegraph particulars to the  police in London.    
Charles and I ran across post-haste to England to track down the  villain. At Southampton Row we found the legal firm by no means  penitent; on the contrary, they were indignant at the way we had  deceived them. An impostor had written to them on Lebenstein  paper from Meran to say that he was coming to London to negotiate  the sale of the schloss and surrounding property with the  famous millionaire, Sir Charles Vandrift; and Sir Charles had  demonstratively recognised him at sight as the real Count von  Lebenstein. The firm had never seen the present Graf at all, and  had swallowed the impostor whole, so to speak, on the strength of  Sir Charles's obvious recognition. He had brought over as documents  some most excellent forgeries--facsimiles of the originals--which,  as our courier and interpreter, he had every opportunity of  examining and inspecting at the Meran lawyers'. It was a deeply-laid  plot, and it had succeeded to a marvel. Yet, all of it depended  upon the one small fact that we had accepted the man with the long  moustache in the hall of the schloss as the Count von Lebenstein on  his own representation.    
He held our cards in his hands when he came in; and the servant had  <i>not</i> given them to him, but to the genuine Count. That was the one  unsolved mystery in the whole adventure.    
By the evening's post two letters arrived for us at Sir Charles's  house: one for myself, and one for my employer. Sir Charles's ran  thus:--    
"HIGH WELL-BORN INCOMPETENCE,--    
"I only just pulled through! A very small slip nearly lost me  everything. I believed you were going to Schloss Planta that day,  not to Schloss Lebenstein. You changed your mind en route. That  might have spoiled all. Happily I perceived it, rode up by the short  cut, and arrived somewhat hurriedly and hotly at the gate before  you. Then I introduced myself. I had one more bad moment when the  rival claimant to my name and title intruded into the room. But  fortune favours the brave: your utter ignorance of German saved me.  The rest was pap. It went by itself almost.    
"Allow me, now, as some small return for your various welcome  cheques, to offer you a useful and valuable present--a German  dictionary, grammar, and phrase-book!    
"I kiss your hand.    
"No longer    
"VON LEBENSTEIN."    
The other note was to me. It was as follows:--    
"DEAR GOOD MR. VENTVORTH,--    
"Ha, ha, ha; just a W misplaced sufficed to take you in, then! And  I risked the TH, though anybody with a head on his shoulders would  surely have known our TH is by far more difficult than our W for  foreigners! However, all's well that ends well; and now I've got  you. The Lord has delivered you into my hands, dear friend--on your  own initiative. I hold my cheque, endorsed by you, and cashed at my  banker's, as a hostage, so to speak, for your future good behaviour.  If ever you recognise me, and betray me to that solemn old ass, your  employer, remember, I expose it, and you with it to him. So now we  understand each other. I had not thought of this little dodge; it  was you who suggested it. However, I jumped at it. Was it not well  worth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a  guarantee of your future silence? Your mouth is now closed. And  cheap too at the price.--Yours, dear Comrade, in the great  confraternity of rogues,    
"CUTHBERT CLAY, Colonel."    
Charles laid his note down, and grizzled. "What's yours, Sey?"  he asked.    
"From a lady," I answered.    
He gazed at me suspiciously. "Oh, I thought it was the same hand,"  he said. His eye looked through me.    
"No," I answered. "Mrs. Mortimer's." But I confess I trembled.    
He paused a moment. "You made all inquiries at this fellow's bank?"  he went on, after a deep sigh.    
"Oh, yes," I put in quickly. (I had taken good care about that,  you may be sure, lest he should spot the commission.) "They say  the self-styled Count von Lebenstein was introduced to them by  the Southampton Row folks, and drew, as usual, on the Lebenstein  account: so they were quite unsuspicious. A rascal who goes about  the world on that scale, you know, and arrives with such credentials  as theirs and yours, naturally imposes on anybody. The bank didn't  even require to have him formally identified. The firm was enough.  He came to pay money in, not to draw it out. And he withdrew his  balance just two days later, saying he was in a hurry to get back  to Vienna."    
Would he ask for items? I confess I felt it was an awkward moment.  Charles, however, was too full of regrets to bother about the  account. He leaned back in his easy chair, stuck his hands in his  pockets, held his legs straight out on the fender before him, and  looked the very picture of hopeless despondency.    
"Sey," he began, after a minute or two, poking the fire,  reflectively, "what a genius that man has! 'Pon my soul, I  admire him. I sometimes wish--" He broke off and hesitated.    
"Yes, Charles?" I answered.    
"I sometimes wish ... we had got him on the Board of the Cloetedorp  Golcondas. Mag--nificent combinations he would make in the City!"    
I rose from my seat and stared solemnly at my misguided  brother-in-law.    
"Charles," I said, "you are beside yourself. Too much Colonel Clay  has told upon your clear and splendid intellect. There are certain  remarks which, however true they may be, no self-respecting  financier should permit himself to make, even in the privacy of  his own room, to his most intimate friend and trusted adviser."    
Charles fairly broke down. "You are right, Sey," he sobbed out.  "Quite right. Forgive this outburst. At moments of emotion the  truth will sometimes out, in spite of everything."    
I respected his feebleness. I did not even make it a fitting  occasion to ask for a trifling increase of salary.
