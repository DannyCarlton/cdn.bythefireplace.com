It is not supposable that the early settlers selected the site of  their plantation on account of its picturesqueness. They were  influenced entirely by the lay of the land, its nearness and easy  access to the sea, and the secure harbor it offered to their  fishing-vessels; yet they could not have chosen a more beautiful  spot had beauty been the sole consideration. The first settlement  was made at Odiorne's Point--the Pilgrims' Rock of New Hampshire;  there the Manor, or Mason's Hall, was built by the Laconia  Company in 1623. It was not until 1631 that the Great House was  erected by Humphrey Chadborn on Strawberry Bank. Mr. Chadborn,  consciously or unconsciously, sowed a seed from which a city has  sprung.    
The town of Portsmouth stretches along the south bank of the  Piscataqua, about two miles from the sea as the crow flies--three  miles following the serpentine course of the river. The stream  broadens suddenly at this point, and at flood tide, lying without  a ripple in a basin formed by the interlocked islands and the  mainland, it looks more like an island lake than a river. To the  unaccustomed eye there is no visible outlet. Standing on one of  the wharves at the foot of State Street or Court Street, a  stranger would at first scarcely suspect the contiguity of the  ocean. A little observation, however, would show him that he was  in a seaport. The rich red rust on the gables and roofs of  ancient buildings looking seaward would tell him that. There is  a fitful saline flavor in the air, and if while he gazed a dense  white fog should come rolling in, like a line of phantom  breakers, he would no longer have any doubts.    
It is of course the oldest part of the town that skirts the  river, though few of the notable houses that remain are to be  found there. Like all New England settlements, Portsmouth was  built of wood, and has been subjected to extensive  conflagrations. You rarely come across a brick building that is  not shockingly modern. The first house of the kind was erected  by Richard Wibird towards the close of the seventeenth century.    
Though many of the old landmarks have been swept away by the  fateful hand of time and fire, the town impresses you as a very  old town, especially as you saunter along the streets down by the  river. The worm-eaten wharves, some of them covered by a sparse,  unhealthy beard of grass, and the weather-stained, unoccupied  warehouses are sufficient to satisfy a moderate appetite for  antiquity. These deserted piers and these long rows of empty  barracks, with their sarcastic cranes projecting from the eaves,  rather puzzle the stranger. Why this great preparation for a  commercial activity that does not exist, and evidently had not  for years existed? There are no ships lying at the pier-heads;  there are no gangs of stevedores staggering under the heavy cases  of merchandise; here and there is a barge laden down to the  bulwarks with coal, and here and there a square-rigged schooner  from Maine smothered with fragrant planks and clapboards; an  imported citizen is fishing at the end of the wharf, a ruminative  freckled son of Drogheda, in perfect sympathy with the indolent  sunshine that seems to be sole proprietor of these crumbling  piles and ridiculous warehouses, from which even the ghost of  prosperity has flown.    
Once upon a time, however, Portsmouth carried on an extensive  trade with the West Indies, threatening as a maritime port to  eclipse both Boston and New York. At the windows of these musty  counting-rooms which overlook the river near Spring Market used  to stand portly merchants, in knee breeches and silver  shoe-buckles and plum-colored coats with ruffles at the wrist,  waiting for their ships to come up the Narrows; the cries of  stevedores and the chants of sailors at the windlass used to echo  along the shore where all is silence now. For reasons not worth  setting forth, the trade with the Indies abruptly closed, having  ruined as well as enriched many a Portsmouth adventurer. This  explains the empty warehouses and the unused wharves. Portsmouth  remains the interesting widow of a once very lively commerce. I  fancy that few fortunes are either made or lost in Portsmouth  nowadays. Formerly it turned out the best ships, as it did the  ablest ship captains, in the world. There were families in which  the love for blue water was in immemorial trait. The boys were  always sailors; "a grey-headed shipmaster, in each generation,  retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of  fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting  the salt spray and the gale, which had blasted against his sire  and grandsire." (1. Hawthorne in his introduction to The Scarlet  Letter.) With thousands of miles of sea-line and a score or two  of the finest harbors on the globe, we have adroitly turned over  our carrying trade to foreign nations.    
In other days, as I have said, a high maritime spirit was  characteristic of Portsmouth. The town did a profitable business  in the war of 1812, sending out a large fleet of the sauciest  small craft on record. A pleasant story is told of one of these  little privateers--the Harlequin, owned and commanded by Captain  Elihu Brown. The Harlequin one day gave chase to a large ship,  which did not seem to have much fight aboard, and had got it into  close quarters, when suddenly the shy stranger threw open her  ports, and proved to be His Majesty's Ship-of-War Bulwark,  seventy-four guns. Poor Captain Brown!    
Portsmouth has several large cotton factories and one or two  corpulent breweries; it is a wealthy old town, with a liking for  first mortgage bonds; but its warmest lover will not claim for it  the distinction of being a great mercantile centre. The majority  of her young men are forced to seek other fields to reap, and  almost every city in the Union, and many a city across the sea,  can point to some eminent merchant, lawyer, or what not, as "a  Portsmouth boy." Portsmouth even furnished the late king of the  Sandwich Islands, Kekuanaoa, with a prime minister, and his  nankeen Majesty never had a better. The affection which all these  exiles cherish for their birthplace is worthy of remark. On two  occasions--in 1852 and 1873, the two hundred and fiftieth  anniversary of the settlement of Strawberry Bank--the  transplanted sons of Portsmouth were seized with an impulse to  return home. Simultaneously and almost without concerted action,  the lines of pilgrims took up their march from every quarter of  the globe, and swept down with music and banners on the motherly  old town.    
To come back to the wharves. I do not know of any spot with such  a fascinating air of dreams and idleness about it as the old  wharf at the end of Court Street. The very fact that it was once  a noisy, busy place, crowded with sailors and soldiers--in the  war of 1812--gives an emphasis to the quiet that broods over it  to-day. The lounger who sits of a summer afternoon on a rusty  anchor fluke in the shadow of one of the silent warehouses, and  look on the lonely river as it goes murmuring past the town,  cannot be too grateful to the India trade for having taken itself  off elsewhere.    
What a slumberous, delightful, lazy place it is! The sunshine  seems to lie a foot deep on the planks of the dusty wharf, which  yields up to the warmth a vague perfume of the cargoes of rum,  molasses, and spice that used to be piled upon it. The river is  as blue as the inside of a harebell. The opposite shore, in the  strangely shifting magic lights of sky and water, stretches along  like the silvery coast of fairyland. Directly opposite you is  the navy yard, and its neat officers' quarters and workshops and  arsenals, and its vast shiphouses, in which the keel of many a  famous frigate has been laid. Those monster buildings on the  water's edge, with their roofs pierced with innumerable little  windows, which blink like eyes in the sunlight, and the  shiphouses. On your right lies a cluster of small islands,--there  are a dozen or more in the harbor--on the most extensive of which  you see the fading-away remains of some earthworks thrown up in  1812. Between this--Trefethren's Island--and Peirce's Island lie  the Narrows. Perhaps a bark or a sloop-of-war is making up to  town; the hulk is hidden amoung the islands, and the topmasts  have the effect of sweeping across the dry land. On your left is  a long bridge, more than a quarter of a mile in length, set upon  piles where the water is twenty or thirty feet deep, leading to  the navy yard and Kittery--the Kittery so often the theme of  Whittier's verse.    
This is a mere outline of the landscape that spreads before you.  Its changeful beauty of form and color, with the summer clouds  floating over it, is not to be painted in words. I know of many a  place where the scenery is more varied and striking; but there is  a mandragora quality in the atmosphere here that holds you to the  spot, and makes the half-hours seem like minutes. I could fancy a  man sitting on the end of that old wharf very contentedly for two  or three years, provided it could be always in June.    
Perhaps, too, one would desire it to be always high water. The  tide falls from eight to twelve feet, and when the water makes  out between the wharves some of the picturesqueness makes out  also. A corroded section of stovepipe mailed in barnacles, or the  skeleton of a hoopskirt protruding from the tide mud like the  remains of some old-time wreck, is apt to break the enchantment.    
I fear I have given the reader an exaggerated idea of the  solitude that reigns along the river-side. Sometimes there is  society here of an unconventional kind, if you care to seek it.  Aside from the foreign gentleman before mentioned, you are likely  to encounter, farther down the shore toward the Point of Graves  (a burial-place of the colonial period), a battered and aged  native fisherman boiling lobsters on a little gravelly bench,  where the river whispers and lisps among the pebbles as the tide  creeps in. It is a weather-beaten ex-skipper or ex-pilot, with  strands of coarse hair, like seaweed, falling about a face that  has the expression of a half-open clam. He is always ready to  talk with you, this amphibious person; and if he is not the most  entertaining of gossips--more weather-wise that Old  Probabilities, and as full of moving incident as Othello  himself--then he is not the wintery-haired shipman I used to see  a few years ago on the strip of beach just beyond Liberty Bridge,  building his drift-wood fire under a great tin boiler, and making  it lively for a lot of reluctant lobsters.    
I imagine that very little change has taken place in this  immediate locality, known prosaically as Puddle Dock, during the  past fifty or sixty years. The view you get looking across  Liberty Bridge, Water Street, is probably the same in every  respect that presented itself to the eyes of the town folk a  century ago. The flagstaff, on the right, is the representative  of the old "standard of liberty" which the Sons planted on this  spot in January, 1766, signalizing their opposition to the  enforcement of the Stamp Act. On the same occasion the patriots  called at the house of Mr. George Meserve, the agent for  distributing the stamps in New Hampshire, and relieved him of his  stamp-master's commission, which document they carried on the  point of a sword through the town to Liberty Bridge (the Swing  Bridge), where they erected the staff, with the motto, "Liberty,  Property, and no Stamp!"    
The Stamp Act was to go into operation on the first day of  November. On the previous morning the "New Hampshire Gazette"  appeared with a deep black border and all the typographical  emblems of affliction, for was not Liberty dead? At all events,  the "Gazette" itself was as good as dead, since the printer could  no longer publish it if he were to be handicapped by a heavy tax.  "The day was ushered in by the tolling of all the bells in town,  the vessels in the harbor had their colors hoisted half-mast  high; about three o'clock a funeral procession was formed, having  a coffin with this inscription, LIBERTY, AGED 145, STAMPT. It  moved from the state house, with two unbraced drums, through the  principal streets. As it passed the Parade, minute-guns were  fired; at the place of interment a speech was delivered on the  occasion, stating the many advantages we had received and the  melancholy prospect before us, at the seeming departure of our  invaluable liberties. But some sign of life appearing, Liberty  was not deposited in the grave; it was rescued by a number of her  sons, the motto changed to Liberty revived, and carried off in  triumph. The detestable Act was buried in its stead, and the  clods of the valley were laid upon it; the bells changed their  melancholy sound to a more joyful tone." (1. Annals of  Portsmouth, by Nathaniel Adams, 1825.)    
With this side glance at one of the curious humors of the time,  we resume our peregrinations.    
Turning down a lane on your left, a few rods beyond Liberty  Bridge, you reach a spot known as the Point of Graves, chiefly  interesting as showing what a graveyard may come to if it last  long enough. In 1671 one Captain John Pickering, of whom we  shall have more to say, ceded to the town a piece of ground on  this neck for burial purposes. It is an odd-shaped lot,  comprising about half an acre, inclosed by a crumbling red brick  wall two or three feet high, with wood capping. The place is  overgrown with thistles, rank grass, and fungi; the black slate  headstones have mostly fallen over; those that still make a  pretense of standing slant to every point of the compass, and  look as if they were being blown this way and that by a  mysterious gale which leaves everything else untouched; the  mounds have sunk to the common level, and the old underground  tombs have collapsed. Here and there the moss and weeds you can  pick out some name that shines in the history of the early  settlement; hundreds of the flower of the colony lie here, but  the known and the unknown, gentle and simple, mingle their dust  on a perfect equality now. The marble that once bore a haughty  coat of arms is as smooth as the humblest slate stone guiltless  of heraldry. The lion and the unicorn, wherever they appear on  some cracked slab, are very much tamed by time. The once  fat-faced cherubs, with wing at either cheek, are the merest  skeletons now. Pride, pomp, grief, and remembrance are all at  end. No reverent feet come here, no tears fall here; the old  graveyard itself is dead! A more dismal, uncanny spot than this  at twilight would be hard to find. It is noticed that when the  boys pass it after nightfall, they always go by whistling with a  gayety that is perfectly hollow.    
Let us get into some cheerfuler neighborhood!
