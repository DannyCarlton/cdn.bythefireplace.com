General Kearney and Lieutenant Beale walked rapidly up and down before  the tents of the wretched remnant of United States troops with which the  former had arrived overland in California. It was bitterly cold in spite  of the fine drizzling rain. Lonely buttes studded the desert, whose  palms and cacti seemed to spring from the rocks; high on one of them was  the American camp. On the other side of a river flowing at the foot of  the butte, the white tents of the Californians were scattered among the  dark huts of the little pueblo of San Pasqual.    
"Let me implore you, General," said Beale, "not to think of meeting  Andres Pico. Why, your men are half starved; your few horses are  broken-winded; your mules are no match for the fresh trained mustangs of  the enemy. I am afraid you do not appreciate the Californians. They are  numerous, brave, and desperate. If you avoid them now, as Commodore  Stockton wishes, and join him at San Diego, we stand a fair chance  of defeating them. But now Pico's cavalry and foot are fresh and  enthusiastic--in painful contrast to yours. And, moreover, they know  every inch of the ground."    
Kearney impatiently knocked the ashes out of his pipe. He had little  regard for Stockton, and no intention of being dictated to by a  truculent young lieutenant who spoke his mind upon all occasions.    
"I shall attack them at daybreak," he said curtly. "I have one hundred  and thirty good men; and has not Captain Gillespie joined me with his  battalion? Never shall it be said that I turned aside to avoid a handful  of boasting Californians. Now go and get an hour's sleep before we  start."    
The young officer shrugged his shoulders, saluted, and walked down  the line of tents. A man emerged from one of them, and he recognized  Russell.    
"Hello, Ned," he said. "How's the arm?"    
"'Twas only a scratch. Is Altimira down there with Pico, do you know? He  is a brave fellow! I respect that man; but we have an account to settle,  and I hope it will be done on the battle-field."    
"He is with Pico, and he has done some good fighting. Most of the  Californians have. They know how to fight and they are perfectly  fearless. Kearney will find it out to-morrow. He is mad to attack them.  Why, his men are actually cadaverous. Bueno! as they say here; Stockton  sent me to guide him to San Diego. If he prefers to go through the  enemy's lines, there is nothing for me to do but take him."    
"Yes, but we may surprise them. I wish to God this imitation war were  over!"    
"It will be real enough before you get through. Don't worry. Well, good  night. Luck to your skin."    
At daybreak the little army marched down the butte, shivering with cold,  wet to the skin. Those on horseback naturally proceeded more rapidly  than those mounted upon the clumsy stubborn mules; and Captain Johnson,  who led the advance guard of twelve dragoons, found himself, when he  came in sight of the enemy's camp, some distance ahead of the main body  of Kearney's small army. To his surprise he saw that the Californians  were not only awake, but horsed and apparently awaiting him. Whether he  was fired by valour or desperation at the sight is a disputed point;  but he made a sudden dash down the hill and across the river, almost  flinging himself upon the lances of the Californians.    
Captain Moore, who was ambling down the hill on an old white horse at  the head of fifty dragoons mounted on mules, spurred his beast as he  witnessed the foolish charge of the advance, and arrived upon the field  in time to see Johnson fall dead and to take his place. Pico, seeing  that reenforcements were coming, began to retreat, followed hotly by  Moore and the horsed dragoons. Suddenly, however, Fernando Altimira  raised himself in his stirrups, looked back, laughed and galloped across  the field to General Pico.    
"Look!" he said. "Only a few men on horses are after us. The mules are  stumbling half a mile behind."    
Pico wheeled about, gave the word of command, and bore down upon the  Americans. Then followed a hand-to-hand conflict, the Californians  lancing and using their pistols with great dexterity, the Americans  doing the best they could with their rusty sabres and clubbed guns.    
They were soon reenforced by Moore's dragoons and Gillespie's battalion,  despite the unwilling mules; but the brutes kicked and bucked at every  pistol shot and fresh cloud of smoke. The poor old horses wheezed and  panted, but stood their ground when not flung out of position by the  frantic mules. The officers and soldiers of the United States army were  a sorry sight, and in pointed contrast to the graceful Californians on  their groomed steeds, handsomely trapped, curvetting and rearing and  prancing as lightly as if on the floor of a circus. Kearney cursed his  own stupidity, and Pico laughed in his face. Beale felt satisfaction and  compunction in saturating the silk and silver of one fine saddle with  the blood of its owner. The point of the dying man's lance pierced his  face, but he noted the bleaching of Kearney's, as one dragoon after  another was flung upon the sharp rocks over which his bewildered brute  stumbled, or was caught and held aloft in the torturing arms of the  cacti.    
On the edge of the battle two men had forgotten the Aztec Eagle and the  Stars and Stripes; they fought for love of a woman. Neither had had time  to draw his pistol; they fought with lance and sabre, thrusting and  parrying. Both were skilful swordsmen, but Altimira's horse was far  superior to Russell's, and he had the advantage of weapons.    
"One or the other die on the rocks," said the Californian, "and si I  kill you, I marry Benicia."    
Russell made no reply. He struck aside the man's lance and wounded his  wrist. But Altimira was too excited to feel pain. His face was quivering  with passion.    
It is not easy to parry a lance with a sabre, and still more difficult  to get close enough to wound the man who wields it. Russell rose  suddenly in his stirrups, described a rapid half-circle with his weapon,  brought it down midway upon the longer blade, and snapped the latter in  two. Altimira gave a cry of rage, and spurring his horse sought to ride  his opponent down; but Russell wheeled, and the two men simultaneously  snatched their pistols from the holsters. Altimira fired first, but his  hand was unsteady and his ball went through a cactus. Russell raised  his pistol with firm wrist, and discharged it full in the face of the  Californian.    
Then he looked over the field. Moore, fatally lanced, lay under a palm,  and many of his men were about him. Gillespie was wounded, Kearney had  received an ugly thrust. The Californians, upon the arrival of the main  body of the enemy's troops, had retreated unpursued; the mules attached  to one of the American howitzers were scampering over to the opposite  ranks, much to the consternation of Kearney. The sun, looking over the  mountain, dissipated the gray smoke, and cast a theatrical light on the  faces of the dead. Russell bent over Altimira. His head was shattered,  but his death was avenged. Never had an American troop suffered a more  humiliating defeat. Only six Californians lay on the field; and when  the American surgeon, after attending to his own wounded, offered his  services to Pico's, that indomitable general haughtily replied that he  had none.    
"By Jove!" said Russell to Beale that night, "you know your  Californians! I am prouder than ever of having married one! That army is  of the stuff of which my mother-in-law is made!"
