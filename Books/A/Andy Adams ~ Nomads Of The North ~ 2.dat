  That night Neewa had a hard attack of Mistu-puyew, or stomach-   ache. Imagine a nursing baby going direct from its mother's breast  to  a beefsteak! That was what Neewa had done. Ordinarily he would  not  have begun nibbling at solid foods for at least another month,  but  nature seemed deliberately at work in a process of intensive  education  preparing him for the mighty and unequal struggle which  he would have  to put up a little later. For hours Neewa moaned and  wailed, and  Noozak muzzled his bulging little belly with her nose,  until finally  he vomited and was better. 
  After that he slept. When he awoke he was startled by opening his   eyes full into the glare of a great blaze of fire. Yesterday he  had  seen the sun, golden and shimmering and far away. But this was  the  first time he had seen it come up over the edge of the world  on a  spring morning in the Northland. It was as red as blood, and  as he  stared it rose steadily and swiftly until the flat side of  it rounded  out and it was a huge ball of SOMETHING. At first he  thought it was  Life&#8212;some monstrous creature sailing up over the  forest toward  them&#8212;and he turned with a whine of enquiry to his  mother. Whatever it  was, Noozak was unafraid. Her big head was  turned toward it, and she  was blinking her eyes in solemn comfort.  It was then that Neewa began  to feel the pleasing warmth of the  red thing, and in spite of his  nervousness he began to purr in the  glow of it. From red the sun  turned swiftly to gold, and the whole  valley was transformed once more  into a warm and pulsating glory  of life. 
  For two weeks after this first sunrise in Neewa's life Noozak   remained near the ridge and the slough. Then came the day, when  Neewa  was eleven weeks old, that she turned her nose toward the  distant  black forests and began the summer's peregrination.  Neewa's feet had  lost their tenderness, and he weighed a good six  pounds. This was  pretty good considering that he had only weighed  twelve ounces at  birth. 
  From the day when Noozak set off on her wandering TREK Neewa's   real adventures began. In the dark and mysterious caverns of the   forests there were places where the snow still lay unsoftened by  the  sun, and for two days Neewa yearned and whined for the sunlit  valley.  They passed the waterfall, where Neewa looked for the  first tune on a  rushing torrent of water. Deeper and darker and  gloomier grew the  forest Noozak was penetrating. In this forest  Neewa received his first  lessons in hunting. Noozak was now well  in the &quot;bottoms&quot; between the  Jackson's Knee and Shamattawa  waterway divides, a great hunting ground  for bears in the early  spring. When awake she was tireless in her  quest for food, and was  constantly digging in the earth, or turning  over stones and  tearing rotting logs and stumps into pieces. The  little gray wood-  mice were her piece de resistance, small as they  were, and it  amazed Neewa to see how quick his clumsy old mother could  be when  one of these little creatures was revealed. There were times  when  Noozak captured a whole family before they could escape. And to   these were added frogs and toads, still partly somnambulent; many   ants, curled up as if dead, in the heart of rotting logs; and   occasional bumble-bees, wasps, and hornets. Now and then Neewa  took a  nibble at these things. On the third day Noozak uncovered a  solid mass  of hibernating vinegar ants as large as a man's two  fists, and frozen  solid. Neewa ate a quantity of these, and the  sweet, vinegary flavour  of them was delicious to his palate. 
  As the days progressed, and living things began to crawl out from   under logs and rocks, Neewa discovered the thrill and excitement  of  hunting on his own account. He encountered a second beetle, and  killed  it. He killed his first wood-mouse. Swiftly there were  developing in  him the instincts of Soominitik, his scrap-loving  old father, who  lived three or four valleys to the north of their  own, and who never  missed an opportunity to get into a fight. At  four months of age,  which was late in May, Neewa was eating many  things that would have  killed most cubs of his age, and there  wasn't a yellow streak in him  from the tip of his saucy little  nose to the end of his stubby tail.  He weighed nine pounds at this  date and was as black as a tar-baby. 
  It was early in June that the exciting event occurred which   brought about the beginning of the big change in Neewa's life, and  it  was on a day so warm and mellow with sunshine that Noozak  started in  right after dinner to take her afternoon nap. They were  out of the  lower timber country now, and were in a valley through  which a shallow  stream wriggled and twisted around white sand-bars  and between pebbly  shores. Neewa was sleepless. He had less desire  than ever to waste a  glorious afternoon in napping. With his  little round eyes he looked  out on a wonderful world, and found it  calling to him. He looked at  his mother, and whined. Experience  told him that she was dead to the  world for hours to come, unless  he tickled her foot or nipped her ear,  and then she would only  rouse herself enough to growl at him. He was  tired of that. He  yearned for something more exciting, and with his  mind suddenly  made up he set off in quest of adventure. 
  In that big world of green and golden colours he was a little   black ball nearly as wide as he was long. He went down to the  creek,  and looked back. He could still see his mother. Then his  feet paddled  in the soft white sand of a long bar that edged the  shore, and he  forgot Noozak. He went to the end of the bar, and  turned up on the  green shore where the young grass was like velvet  under his paws. Here  he began turning over small stones for ants.  He chased a chipmunk that  ran a close and furious race with him  for twenty seconds. A little  later a huge snow-shoe rabbit got up  almost under his nose, and he  chased that until in a dozen long  leaps Wapoos disappeared in a  thicket. Neewa wrinkled up his nose  and emitted a squeaky snarl. Never  had Soominitik's blood run so  riotously within him. He wanted to get  hold of something. For the  first time in his life he was yearning for  a scrap. He was like a  small boy who the day after Christmas has a  pair of boxing gloves  and no opponent. He sat down and looked about  him querulously,  still wrinkling his nose and snarling defiantly. He  had the whole  world beaten. He knew that. Everything was afraid of his  mother.  Everything was afraid of HIM. It was disgusting&#8212;this lack of   something alive for an ambitious young fellow to fight. After all,   the world was rather tame. 
  He set off at a new angle, came around the edge of a huge rock,   and suddenly stopped. 
  From behind the other end of the rock protruded a huge hind paw.   For a few moments Neewa sat still, eyeing it with a growing   anticipation. This time he would give his mother a nip that would   waken her for good! He would rouse her to the beauty and the   opportunities of this day if there was any rouse in him! So he   advanced slowly and cautiously, picked out a nice bare spot on the   paw, and sank his little teeth in it to the gums. 
  There followed a roar that shook the earth. Now it happened that   the paw did not belong to Noozak, but was the personal property of   Makoos, an old he-bear of unlovely disposition and malevolent  temper.  But in him age had produced a grouchiness that was not at  all like the  grandmotherly peculiarities of old Noozak. Makoos was  on his feet  fairly before Neewa realized that he had made a  mistake. He was not  only an old bear and a grouchy bear, but he  was also a hater of cubs.  More than once in his day he had  committed the crime of cannibalism.  He was what the Indian hunter  calls uchan&#8212;a bad bear, an eater of his  own kind, and the instant  his enraged eyes caught sight of Neewa he  let out another roar. 
  At that Neewa gathered his fat little legs under his belly and was   off like a shot. Never before in his life had he run as he ran  now.  Instinct told him that at last he had met something which was  not  afraid of him, and that he was in deadly peril. He made no  choice of  direction, for now that he had made this mistake he had  no idea where  he would find his mother. He could hear Makoos  coming after him, and  as he ran he set up a bawling that was  filled with a wild and  agonizing prayer for help. That cry reached  the faithful old Noozak.  In an instant she was on her feet&#8212;and  just in time. Like a round  black ball shot out of a gun Neewa sped  past the rock where she had  been sleeping, and ten jumps behind  him came Makoos. Out of the corner  of his eye he saw his mother,  but his momentum carried him past her.  In that moment Noozak leapt  into action. As a football player makes a  tackle she rushed out  just in time to catch old Makoos with all her  weight full  broadside in the ribs, and the two old bears rolled over  and over  in what to Neewa was an exciting and glorious mix-up. 
  He had stopped, and his eyes bulged out like shining little onions   as he took in the scene of battle. He had longed for a fight but  what  he saw now fairly paralyzed him. The two bears were at it,  roaring and  tearing each other's hides and throwing up showers of  gravel and earth  in their deadly clinch. In this first round  Noozak had the best of it.  She had butted the wind out of Makoos  in her first dynamic assault,  and now with her dulled and broken  teeth at his throat she was lashing  him with her sharp hind claws  until the blood streamed from the old  barbarian's sides and he  bellowed like a choking bull. Neewa knew that  it was his pursuer  who was getting the worst of it, and with a squeaky  cry for his  mother to lambast the very devil out of Makoos he ran back  to the  edge of the arena, his nose crinkled and his teeth gleaming in  a  ferocious snarl. He danced about excitedly a dozen feet from the   fighters, Soominitik's blood filling him with a yearning for the  fray  and yet he was afraid. 
  Then something happened that suddenly and totally upset the   maddening joy of his mother's triumph. Makoos, being a he-bear,  was  of necessity skilled in fighting, and all at once he freed  himself  from Noozak's jaws, wallowed her under him, and in turn  began ripping  the hide off old Noozak's carcass in such quantities  that she let out  an agonized bawling that turned Neewa's little  heart into stone. 
  It is a matter of most exciting conjecture what a small boy will   do when he sees his father getting licked. If there is an axe  handy  he is liable to use it. The most cataclysmic catastrophe  that cam come  into his is to have a father whom some other boy's  father has given a  walloping. Next to being President of the  United States the average  small boy treasures the desire to  possess a parent who can whip any  other two-legged creature that  wears trousers. And there were a lot of  human things about Neewa.  The louder his mother bawled the more  distinctly he felt the shock  of his world falling about him. If Noozak  had lost a part of her  strength in her old age her voice, at least,  was still unimpaired,  and such a spasm of outcry as she emitted could  have been heard at  least half a mile away. 
  Neewa could stand no more. Blind with rage, he darted in. It was   chance that closed his vicious little jaws on a toe that belonged  to  Makoos, and his teeth sank into the flesh like two rows of  ivory  needles. Makoos gave a tug, but Neewa held on, and bit  deeper. Then  Makoos drew up his leg and sent it out like a  catapault, and in spite  of his determination to hang on Neewa  found himself sailing wildly  through the air. He landed against a  rock twenty feet from the  fighters with a force that knocked the  wind out of him, and for a  matter of eight or ten seconds after  that he wobbled dizzily in his  efforts to stand up. Then his  vision and his senses returned and he  gazed on a scene that  brought all the blood pounding back into his  body again. 
  Makoos was no longer fighting, but was RUNNING AWAY&#8212;and there was   a decided limp in his gait! 
  Poor old Noozak was standing on her feet, facing the retreating   enemy. She was panting like a winded calf. Her jaws were agape.  Her  tongue lolled out, and blood was dripping in little trickles  from her  body to the ground. She had been thoroughly and  efficiently mauled.  She was beyond the shadow of a doubt a whipped  bear. Yet in that  glorious flight of the enemy Neewa saw nothing  of Noozak's defeat.  Their enemy was RUNNING AWAY! Therefore, he  was whipped. And with  excited little squeaks of joy Neewa ran to  his mother.
