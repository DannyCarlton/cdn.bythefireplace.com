  A chilling loneliness now crept over the young adventurer. Even as  he ate he tried to peer out into the mysterious darkness. A sound from  up the chasm, made by some wild prowler of the night, sent a nervous  tremor through him. He was not afraid; he would not have confessed to  that. But still, the absolute, almost gruesome silence between the two  mountains, the mere knowledge that he was alone in a place where the  foot of man had not trod for more than half a century, was not  altogether quieting to his nerves. What mysteries might not these grim  walls hold? What might not happen here, where everything was so  strange, so weird, and so different from the wilderness world just over  the range?
  Rod tried to laugh away his nervousness, but the very sound of his  own voice was distressing. It rose in unnatural shivering echoes&#8212;a  low, hollow mockery of a laugh beating itself against the walls; a  ghost of a laugh, Rod thought, and that very thought made him hunch  closer to the fire. The young hunter was not superstitious, or at least  he was not unnaturally so; but what man or boy is there in this whole  wide world of ours who does not, at some time, inwardly cringe from  something in the air&#8212;something that does not exist and never did  exist, but which holds a peculiar and nameless fear for the soul of a  human being?
  And Rod, as he piled his fire high with wood and shrank in the  warmth of his cedar shelter, felt that nameless dread; and there came  to him no thought of sleep, no feeling of fatigue, but only that he was  alone, absolutely alone, in the mystery and almost unending silence of  the chasm. Try as he would he could not keep from his mind the vision  of the skeletons as he had first seen them in the old cabin.
  Many, many years ago, even before his own mother was born, those  skeletons had trod this very chasm. They had drunk from the same creek  as he, they had clambered over the same rocks, they had camped perhaps  where he was camping now! They, too, in flesh and life, had strained  their ears in the grim silence, they had watched the flickering light  of their camp-fire on the walls of rock&#8212;and they had found gold!
  Just now, if Rod could have moved himself by magic, he would have  been safely back in camp. He listened. From far back over the trail he  had followed there came a lonely, plaintive, almost pleading cry.
  &#8220;'Ello&#8212;'ello&#8212;'ello!&#8221;
  It sounded like a distant human greeting, but Rod knew that it was  the awakening night cry of what Wabi called the &#8220;man owl.&#8221; It was  weirdly human-like; and the echoes came softly, and more softly, until  ghostly voices seemed to be whispering in the blackness about him.
  &#8220;'Ello&#8212;'ello&#8212;'ello!&#8221;
  The boy shivered and laid his rifle across his knees. There was  tremendous comfort in the rifle. Rod fondled it with his fingers, and  two or three times he felt as though he would almost like to talk to  it. Only those who have gone far into the silence and desolation of the  unblazed wilderness know just how human a good rifle becomes to its  owner. It is a friend every hour of the night and day, faithful to its  master's desires, keeping starvation at bay and holding death for his  enemies; a guaranty of safety at his bedside by night, a sharp-fanged  watch-dog by day, never treacherous and never found wanting by the one  who bestows upon it the care of a comrade and friend. Thus had Rod come  to look upon his rifle. He rubbed the barrel now with his mittens; he  polished the stock as he sat in his loneliness, and long afterward,  though he had determined to remain awake during the night, he fell  asleep with it clasped tightly in his hands.
  It was an uneasy, troubled slumber in which the young adventurer's  visions and fears took a more realistic form. He half sat, half lay,  upon his cedar boughs; his head fell forward upon his breast, his feet  were stretched out to the fire. Now and then unintelligible sounds fell  from his lips, and he would start suddenly as if about to awaken, but  each time would sink back into his restless sleep, still clutching the  gun.
  The visions in his head began to take a more definite form. Once  more he was on the trail, and had come to the old cabin. But this time  he was alone. The window of the cabin was wide open, but the door was  tightly closed, just as the hunters had found it when they first came  down into the dip. He approached cautiously. When very near the window  he heard sounds&#8212;strange sounds&#8212;like the clicking of bones!
  Step by step in his dream he approached the window and looked in.  And there he beheld a sight that froze him to the marrow. Two huge  skeletons were struggling in deadly embrace. He could hear no sound but  the click-click-click of their bones. He saw the gleam of knives held  between fleshless fingers, and he saw now that both were struggling for  the possession of something that was upon the table. Now one almost  reached it, now the other, but neither gained possession.
  The clicking of the bones became louder, the struggle fiercer, the  knives of the skeleton combatants rose and fell. Then one staggered  back and sank in a heap on the floor.
  For a moment the victor swayed, tottered to the table, and gripped  the mysterious object in its bony fingers.
  As it stumbled weakly against the cabin wall the gruesome creature  held the object up, and Rod saw that it was a roll of birch-bark!
  An ember in the dying fire snapped with a sound like the report of a  small pistol and Rod sat bolt upright, awake, staring, trembling. What  a horrible dream! He drew in his cramped legs and approached the fire  on his knees, holding his rifle in one hand while he piled on wood with  the other.
  What a horrible dream!
  He shuddered and ran his eyes around the impenetrable wall of  blackness that shut him in, the thought constantly flashing through his  mind, what a horrible dream&#8212;what a horrible dream!
  He sat down again and watched the flames of his fire as they climbed  higher and higher. The light and the heat cheered him, and after a  little he allowed his mind to dwell upon the adventure of his slumber.  It had made him sweat. He took off his cap and found that the hair  about his forehead was damp.
  All the different phases of a dream return to one singly when awake,  and it was with the suddenness of a shot that there came to Rod a  remembrance of the skeleton hand held aloft, clutching between its  gleaming fleshless fingers the roll of birch-bark. And with that memory  of his dream there came another&#8212;the skeleton in the cabin was  clutching a piece of birch-bark when they had buried it!
  Could that crumpled bit of bark hold the secret of the lost mine?
  Was it for the possession of that bark instead of the buckskin bag  that the men had fought and died?
  As the minutes passed Rod forgot his loneliness, forgot his  nervousness and only thought of the possibilities of the new clue that  had come to him in a dream. Wabi and Mukoki had seen the bark clutched  in the skeleton fingers, but they as well as he had given it no special  significance, believing that it had been caught up in some terrible  part of the struggle when both combatants were upon the floor, or  perhaps in the dying agonies of the wounded man against the wall. Rod  remembered now that they had found no more birch-bark upon the floor,  which they would have done if a supply had been kept there for kindling  fires. Step by step he went over the search they had made in the old  cabin, and more and more satisfied did he become that the skeleton hand  held something of importance for them.
  He replenished his fire and waited impatiently for dawn. At four  o'clock, before day had begun to dispel the gloom of night, he cooked  his breakfast and prepared his pack for the homeward journey. Soon  afterward a narrow rim of light broke through the rift in the chasm.  Slowly it crept downward, until the young hunter could make out objects  near him and the walls of the mountains.
  Thick shadows still defied his vision when he began retracing his  steps over the trail he had made the day before. He returned with the  same caution that he had used in his advance. Even more carefully, if  possible, did he scrutinize the rocks and the creek ahead. He had  already found life in the chasm, and he might find more.
  The full light of day came quickly now, and with it the youth's  progress became more rapid. He figured that if he lost no time in  further investigation of the creek he would arrive at camp by noon, and  they would dig up the skeleton without delay. There was little snow in  the chasm, in spite of the lateness of the season, and if the roll of  bark held the secret of the lost gold it would be possible for them to  locate the treasure before other snows came to baffle them.
  At the spot where he had killed the silver fox Rod paused for a  moment. He wondered if foxes ever traveled in pairs, and regretted that  he had not asked Wabi or Mukoki that question. He could see where the  fox had come straight from the black wall of the mountain. Curiosity  led him over the trail. He had not followed it more than two hundred  yards when he stopped in sudden astonishment. Plainly marked in the  snow before him was the trail of a pair of snow-shoes! Whoever had been  there had passed since he shot the fox, for the imprints of the  animal's feet were buried under those of the snow-shoes.
  Who was the other person in the chasm?
  Was it Wabi?
  Had Mukoki or he come to join him? Or&#8212;
  He looked again at the snow-shoe trail. It was a peculiar trail,  unlike the one made by his own shoes. The imprints were a foot longer  than his own, and narrower. Neither Wabi nor Mukoki wore shoes that  would make that trail!
  At this point the strange trail had turned and disappeared among the  rocks along the wall of the mountain, and it occurred to Rod that  perhaps the stranger had not discovered his presence in the chasm.  There was some consolation in this thought, but it was doomed to quick  disappointment. Very cautiously the youth advanced, his rifle held in  readiness and his eyes searching every place of concealment ahead of  him. A hundred yards farther on the stranger had stopped, and from the  way in which the snow was packed Rod knew that he had stood in a  listening and watchful attitude for some time. From this point the  trail took another turn and came down until, from behind a huge rock,  the stranger had cautiously peered out upon the path made by the white  youth.
  It was evident that he was extremely anxious to prevent the  discovery of his own trail, for now the mysterious spy threaded his way  behind rocks until he had again come to the shelter of the mountain  wall.
  Rod was perplexed. He realized the peril of his dilemma, and yet he  knew not what course to take to evade it. He had little doubt that the  trail was made by one of the treacherous Woongas, and that the Indian  not only knew of his presence, but was somewhere in the rocks ahead of  him, perhaps even now waiting behind some ambuscade to shoot him.  Should he follow the trail, or would it be safer to steal along among  the rocks of the opposite wall of the chasm?
  He had decided upon the latter course when his eyes caught a narrow  horizontal slit cleaving the face of the mountain on his left, toward  which the snow-shoe tracks seemed to lead. With his rifle ready for  instant use the youth slowly approached the fissure, and was surprised  to find that it was a complete break in the wall of rock, not more than  four feet wide, and continuing on a steady incline to the summit of the  ridge. At the mouth of this fissure his mysterious watcher had taken  off his snow-shoes and Rod could see where he had climbed up the narrow  exit from the chasm.
  With a profound sense of relief the young hunter hurried along the  base of the mountain, keeping well within its shelter so that eyes that  might be spying from above could not see his movements. He now felt no  fear of danger. The stranger's flight up the cleft in the chasm wall  and his careful attempts to conceal his trail among the rocks assured  Rod that he had no designs upon his life. His chief purpose had seemed  to be to keep secret his own presence in the gorge, and this fact in  itself added to the mystification of the white youth. For a long time  he had been secretly puzzled, and had evolved certain ideas of his own  because of the movements of the Woongas. Contrary to the opinions of  Mukoki and Wabigoon, he believed that the red outlaws were perfectly  conscious of their presence in the dip. From the first their actions  had been unaccountable, but not once had one of their snow-shoe trails  crossed their trap-lines.
  Was this fact in itself not significant? Rod was of a contemplative  theoretical turn of mind, one of those wide-awake, interesting young  fellows who find food for conjecture in almost every incident that  occurs, and his suspicions were now aroused to an unusual pitch. A  chief fault, however, was that he kept most of his suspicions to  himself, for he believed that Mukoki and Wabigoon, born and taught in  the life of the wilderness, were infallible in their knowledge of the  ways and the laws and the perils of the world they were in.
