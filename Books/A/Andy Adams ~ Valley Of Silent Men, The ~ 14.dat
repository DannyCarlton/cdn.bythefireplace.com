  The manner in which Kent stared at Marette Radisson after her   announcement that it was Dirty Fingers who had planned his escape   must have been, he thought afterward, little less than imbecile.  He  had wronged Fingers, he believed. He had called him a coward  and a  backslider. In his mind he had reviled him for helping to  raise his  hopes to the highest pitch, only to smash them in the  end. And all the  time Dirty Fingers had been planning this! Kent  began to grin. The  thing was clear in a moment&#8212;that is, the  immediate situation was  clear&#8212;or he thought it was. But there  were questions&#8212;one, ten, a  hundred of them. They wanted to pile  over the end of his tongue,  questions that had little or nothing  to do with Kedsty. He saw nothing  now but Marette. 
  She had begun to take down her hair. It fell about her in wet,   shining masses. Kent had never seen anything like it. It clung to  her  face, her neck, her shoulders and arms, and shrouded her  slender body  to her hips, lovely in its confusion. Little drops of  water glistened  in it like diamonds in the lamp glow, trickling  down and dropping to  the floor. It was like a glowing coat of  velvety sable beaten by  storm. Marette ran her arms up through it,  shaking it out in clouds,  and a mist of rain leaped out from it,  some of it striking Kent in the  face. He forgot Fingers. He forgot  Kedsty. His brain flamed only with  the electrifying nearness of  her. It was the thought of her that had  inspired the greatest hope  in him. It was his dreams of her, somewhere  on the Big River, that  had given him his great courage to believe in  the ultimate of  things. And now time and space had taken a leap  backward. She was  not four or five hundred miles north. There was no  long quest  ahead of him. She was here, within a few feet of him,  tossing the  wet from that glorious hair he had yearned to touch,  brushing it  out now, with her back toward him, in front of her mirror. 
  And as he sat there, uttering no word, looking at her, the demands   of the immense responsibility that had fallen upon him and of the   great fight that lay ahead pounded within him with naked fists.   Fingers had planned. She had executed. It was up to him to finish. 
  He saw her, not as a creature to win, but as a priceless   possession. Her fight had now become his fight. The rain was  beating  against the window near him. Out there was blackness, the  river, the  big world. His blood leaped with the old fighting fire.  They were  going tonight; they must be going tonight! Why should  they wait? Why  should they waste time under Kedsty's roof when  freedom lay out there  for the taking? He watched the swift  movements of her hand, listened  to the silken rustle of the brush  as it smoothed out her long hair.  Bewilderment, reason, desire for  action fought inside him. 
  Suddenly she faced him again. &quot;It has just this moment occurred to   me,&quot; she said, &quot;that you haven't said 'Thank you.'&quot; 
  So suddenly that he startled her he was at her side. He did not   hesitate this time, as he had hesitated in his room at Cardigan's   place. He caught her two hands in his, and with them he felt the   soft, damp crush of her hair between his fingers. Words tumbled  from  his lips. He could not remember afterward all that he said.  Her eyes  widened, and they never for an instant left his own.  Thank her! He  told her what had happened to him&#8212;in the heart and  soul of him&#8212;from  the hour she had come to him at Cardigan's. He  told her of dreams and  plans, of his determination to find her  again after he had escaped, if  it took him all his life. He told  her of Mercer, of his discovery of  her visit to Kim's Bayou, of  his scheme to follow her down the Three  Rivers, to seek for her at  Fort Simpson, to follow her to the Valley  of Silent Men, wherever  it was. Thank her! He held her hands so tight  they hurt, and his  voice trembled. Under the cloud of her hair a slow  fire burned in  Marette Radisson's cheeks. But it did not show in her  eyes. They  looked at him so steadily, so unfalteringly, that his own  face  burned before he had finished what was in his mind to say, and he   freed her hands and stepped back from her again. 
  &quot;Forgive me for saying all that,&quot; he entreated. &quot;But it's true.   You came to me there, at Cardigan's place, like something I'd  always  dreamed about, but never expected to find. And you came to  me again,  at the cell, like&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I know how I came,&quot; she interrupted him. &quot;Through the mud   and the rain, Mr. Kent. And it was so black I lost my way and was   terrified to think that I might not find barracks. I was half an  hour  behind Mr. Fingers' schedule. For that reason I think  Inspector Kedsty  may return at any moment, and you must not talk  so loud&#8212;or so much.&quot; 
  &quot;Lord!&quot; he breathed in a whisper. &quot;I have said a lot in a short   time, haven't I? But it isn't a hundredth part of what I want to  get  out of my system. I won't ask the million questions that want  to be  asked. But I must know why we are here. Why have we come to  Kedsty's?  Why didn't we make for the river? There couldn't be a  better night to  get away.&quot; 
  &quot;But it is not so good as the fifth night from now will be,&quot; she   said, resuming the task of drying her hair. &quot;On that night you may  go  to the river. Our plans were a little upset, you know, by  Inspector  Kedsty's change in the date on which you were to leave  for Edmonton.  Arrangements have been made so that on the fifth  night you may leave  safely.&quot; 
  &quot;And you?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall remain here.&quot; And then she added in a low voice that   struck his heart cold, &quot;I shall remain to pay Kedsty the price  which  he will ask for what has happened tonight.&quot; 
  &quot;Good God!&quot; he cried. &quot;Marette!&quot; 
  She turned on him swiftly. &quot;No, no, I don't mean that he will hurt   me,&quot; she cried, a fierce little note in her voice. &quot;I would kill  him  before that! I'm sorry I told you. But you must not question  me. You  shall not!&quot; 
  She was trembling. He had never seen her excited like that before,   and as she stood there before him, he knew that he was not afraid  for  her in the way that had flashed into his mind. She had not  spoken  empty words. She would fight. She would kill, if it was  necessary to  kill. And he saw her, all at once, as he had not seen  her before. He  remembered a painting which he had seen a long time  ago in Montreal.  It was L'Esprit de la Solitude&#8212;The Spirit of the  Wild&#8212;painted by  Conne, the picturesque French-Canadian friend of  Lord Strathcona and  Mount Royal, and a genius of the far backwoods  who had drawn his  inspiration from the heart of the wilderness  itself. And that painting  stood before him now in flesh and blood,  its crudeness gone, but the  marvelous spirit it had breathed  remaining. Shrouded in her tumbled  hair, her lips a little parted,  every line of her slender body vibrant  with an emotion which  seemed consuming her, her beautiful eyes aglow  with its fire, he  saw in her, as Conne must have seen at another time,  the soul of  the great North itself. She seemed to him to breathe of  the God's  country far down the Three Rivers; of its almost savage   fearlessness; its beauty, its sunshine, and its storm; its  tragedy,  its pathos, and its song. In her was the courage and the  glory of that  North. He had seen; and now he felt these things,  and the thrill of  them swept over him like an inundation. 
  He had heard her soft laugh, she had made fun of him when he   thought he was dying; she had kissed him, she had fought for him,  she  had clung in terror to his hand when the lightning flashed;  and now  she stood with her little hands clenched in her hair, like  a storm  about to break. A moment ago she was so near that he had  almost taken  her in his arms. Now, in an instant, she had placed  something so vast  between them that he would not have dared to  touch her hand or her  hair. Like sun and cloud and wind she  changed, and for him each change  added to the wonder of her. And  now it was storm. He saw it in her  eyes, her hands, her body. He  felt the electrical nearness of it in  those low-spoken, trembling  words, &quot;YOU SHALL NOT!&quot; The room seemed  surcharged for a moment  with impending shock. And then his physical  eyes took in again the  slimness of her, seized upon the alluring  smallness of her and the  fact that he could have tossed her to the  ceiling without great  effort. And yet he saw her as one sees a  goddess. 
  &quot;No, I won't ask you questions, when you look at me like that,&quot; he   said, finding his tongue. &quot;I won't ask you what this price is that   Kedsty may demand, because you're not going to pay it. If you  won't  go with me, I won't go. I'd rather stay here and be hung.  I'm not  asking you questions, so please don't shoot, but if you  told me the  truth, and you belong in the North, you're going back  with me&#8212;or I'm  not going. I'll not budge an inch.&quot; 
  She drew a deep breath, as if something had greatly relieved her.   Again her violet eyes came out from the shadow into sunlight, and  her  trembling mouth suddenly broke into a smile. It was not  apologetic.  There was about it a quick and spontaneous gladness  which she made no  effort at all to conceal. 
  &quot;That is nice of you,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm glad to hear you say it. I   never knew how pleasant it was to have some one who was willing to  be  hung for me. But you will go. And I will not go. There isn't  time to  explain all about it just now, for Inspector Kedsty will  be here very  soon, and I must dry my hair and show you your  hiding-place&#8212;if you  have to hide.&quot; 
  She began to brush her hair again. In the mirror Kent caught a   glimpse of the smile still trembling on her lips. 
  &quot;I'm not questioning you,&quot; he guarded himself again, &quot;but if you   could only understand how anxious I am to know where Kedsty is,  how  Fingers found you, why you made us believe you were leaving  the  Landing and then returned&#8212;and&#8212;how badly I want to know  something  about you&#8212;I almost believe you'd talk a little while  you are drying  your hair.&quot; 
  &quot;It was Mooie, the old Indian,&quot; she said. &quot;It was he who found out   in some way that I was here, and then M'sieu Fingers came himself  one  night when the Inspector was away&#8212;got in through a window and  simply  said that you had sent him, when I was just about to shoot  him. You  see, I knew you weren't going to die. Kedsty had told me  that. I was  going to help you in another way, if M'sieu Fingers  hadn't come.  Inspector Kedsty was over there tonight, at his  cabin, when the thing  happened down there. It was a part of  Fingers' scheme&#8212;to keep him out  of the way.&quot; 
  Suddenly she grew rigid. The brush remained poised in her hair.   Kent, too, heard the sound that she had heard. It was a loud  tapping  at one of the curtained windows, the tapping of some  metallic object.  And that window was fifteen feet above the  ground! 
  With a little cry the girl threw down her brush, ran to the   window, and raised and lowered the curtain once. Then she turned  to  Kent, swiftly dividing her hair into thick strands and weaving  them  into a braid. 
  &quot;It is Mooie,&quot; she cried. &quot;Kedsty is coming!&quot; 
  She caught his hand and hurried him toward the head of the bed,   where two long curtains were strung on a wire. She drew these  apart.  Behind them were what seemed to Kent an innumerable number  of feminine  garments. 
  &quot;You must hide in them, if you have to,&quot; she said, the excited   little tremble in her voice again. &quot;I don't think it will come to   that, but if it does, you must! Bury yourself way back in them,  and  keep quiet. If Kedsty finds you are here&#8212;&quot; 
  She looked into his eyes, and it seemed to Kent that there was   something which was very near to fear in them now. 
  &quot;If he should find you here, it would mean something terrible for   me,&quot; she went on, her hands creeping to his arms. &quot;I can not tell  you  what it is now, but it would be worse than death. Will you  promise to  stay here, no matter what happens down there, no matter  what you may  hear? Will you&#8212;Mr. Kent?&quot; 
  &quot;Not if you call me Mr. Kent,&quot; he said, something thickening in   his throat. 
  &quot;Will you&#8212;Jeems? Will you&#8212;no matter what happens&#8212;if I promise&#8212;   when I come back&#8212;to kiss you?&quot; 
  Her hands slipped almost caressingly from his arms, and then she   had turned swiftly and was gone through the partly open door,  closing  it after her, before he could give his promise.
