John Van Moore a young Chicago advertising man went one afternoon to  the offices of the Wheelright Bicycle Company. The company had both  its factory and offices far out on the west side. The factory was a  huge brick affair fronted by a broad cement sidewalk and a narrow  green lawn spotted with flower beds. The building used for offices was  smaller and had a veranda facing the street. Up the sides of the  office building vines grew.    
Like the reporter who had watched the Marching Men in the field by the  factory wall John Van Moore was a dapper young man with a moustache.  In his leisure hours he played a clarinet. "It gives a man something  to cling to," he explained to his friends. "One sees life going past  and feels that he is not a mere drifting log in the stream of things.  Although as a musician I amount to nothing, it at least makes me  dream."    
Among the men in the advertising office where he worked Van Moore was  known as something of a fool, redeemed by his ability to string words  together. He wore a heavy black braided watch chain and carried a cane  and he had a wife who after marriage had studied medicine and with  whom he did not live. Sometimes on a Saturday evening the two met at  some restaurant and sat for hours drinking and laughing. When the wife  had gone to her own place the advertising man continued the fun, going  from saloon to saloon and making long speeches setting forth his  philosophy of life. "I am an individualist," he declared, strutting up  and down and swinging the cane about. "I am a dabbler, an experimenter  if you will. Before I die it is my dream that I will discover a new  quality in existence."    
For the bicycle company the advertising man was to write a booklet  telling in romantic and readable form the history of the company. When  finished the booklet would be sent out to those who had answered  advertisements put into magazines and newspapers. The company had a  process of manufacture peculiar to Wheelright bicycles and in the  booklet this was to be much emphasised.    
The manufacturing process in regard to which John Van Moore was to wax  eloquent had been conceived in the brain of a workman and was  responsible for the company's success. Now the workman was dead and  the president of the company had decided that he would take credit for  the idea. He had thought a good deal of the matter and had decided  that in truth the notion must have been more than a little his own.  "It must have been so," he told himself, "otherwise it would not have  worked out so well."    
In the offices of the bicycle company the president, a grey gross man  with tiny eyes, walked up and down a long room heavily carpeted. In  reply to questions asked by the advertising man, who sat at a table  with a pad of paper before him, he raised himself on his toes, put a  thumb in the armhole of his vest and told a long rambling tale of  which he was the hero.    
The tale concerned a purely imaginary young workman who spent all of  the earlier years of his life labouring terribly. At evening he ran  quickly from the shop where he was employed and going without sleep  toiled for long hours in a little garret. When the workman had  discovered the secret that made successful the Wheelright bicycle he  opened a shop and began to reap the reward of his efforts.    
"That was me. I was that fellow," cried the fat man who in reality had  bought his interest in the bicycle company after the age of forty.  Tapping himself on the breast he paused as though overcome with  feeling. Tears came into his eyes. The young workman had become a  reality to him. "All day I ran about the little shop crying 'Quality!  Quality!' I do that now. It is a fetish with me. I do not make  bicycles for money but because I am a workman with pride in my work.  You may put that in the book. You may quote me as saying that. A big  point should be made of my pride in my work." The advertising man  nodded his head and scribbled upon the pad of paper. Almost he could  have written the story without the visit to the factory. When the fat  man was not looking he turned his face to one side and listened  attentively. With a whole heart he wished the president would go away  and leave him alone to wander in the factory.    
On the evening before, John Van Moore had taken part in an adventure.  With a companion, a fellow who drew cartoons for the daily papers, he  had gone into a saloon and there had met another man of the  newspapers.    
In the saloon the three men had sat until late into the night drinking  and talking. The second newspaper man--that same dapper fellow who had  watched the marchers by the factory wall--had told over and over the  story of McGregor and his Marchers. "I tell you there is something  growing up here," he had said. "I have seen this McGregor and I know.  You may believe me or not but the fact is that he has found out  something. There is an element in men that up to now has not been  understood--there is a thought hidden away within the breast of  labour, a big unspoken thought--it is a part of men's bodies as well  as their minds. Suppose this fellow has figured that out and  understands it, eh!"    
Becoming more and more excited as he continued to drink the newspaper  man had been half wild in his conjectures as to what was to happen in  the world. Thumping with his fist upon a table wet with beer he had  addressed the writer of advertisements. "There are things that animals  know that have not been understood by men," he cried. "Consider the  bees. Have you thought that man has not tried to work out a collective  intellect? Why should man not try to work that out?"    
The newspaper man's voice became low and tense. "When you go into a  factory I want you to keep your eyes and your ears open," he said. "Go  into one of the great rooms where many men are at work. Stand  perfectly still. Don't try to think. Wait."    
Jumping out of his seat the excited man had walked up and down before  his companions. A group of men standing before the bar listened, their  glasses held half way to their lips.    
"I tell you there is already a song of labour. It has not got itself  expressed and understood but it is in every shop, in every field where  men work. In a dim way the men who work are conscious of the song  although if you talk of the matter they only laugh. The song is low  harsh rhythmical. I tell you it comes out of the very soul of labour.  It is akin to the thing that artists understand and that is called  form. This McGregor understands something of that. He is the first  leader of labour that has understood. The world shall hear from him.  One of these days the world shall ring with his name."    
In the bicycle factory John Van Moore looked at the pad of paper  before him and thought of the words of the half drunken man in the  saloon. In the great shop at his back there was the steady grinding  roar of many machines. The fat man, hypnotised by his own words,  continued to walk up and down telling of the hardship that had once  confronted the imaginary young workman and above which he had risen  triumphant. "We hear much of the power of labour but there has been a  mistake made," he said. "Such men as myself--we are the power. Do you  see we have come out of the mass? We stand forth."    
Stopping before the advertising man and looking down the fat man  winked. "You do not need to say that in the book. There is no need of  quoting me there. Our bicycles are being bought by workingmen and it  would be foolish to offend them but what I say is nevertheless true.  Do not such men as I, with our cunning brains and our power of  patience build these great modern organisations?"    
The fat man waved his arm toward the shops from which the roar of  machinery came. The advertising man absentmindedly nodded his head. He  was trying to hear the song of labour talked of by the drunken man. It  was quitting time and there was the sound of many feet moving about  the floor of the factory. The roar of the machinery stopped.    
Again the fat man walked up and down talking of the career of the  labourer who had come forth from the ranks of labour. From the factory  the men began filing out into the open. There was the sound of feet  scuffling along the wide cement sidewalk past the flowerbeds.    
Of a sudden the fat man stopped. The advertising man sat with pencil  suspended above the paper. From the walk below sharp commands rang  out. Again the sound of men moving about came in through the windows.    
The president of the bicycle company and the advertising man ran to  the window. There on the cement sidewalk stood the men of the company  formed into columns of fours and separated into companies. At the head  of each company stood a captain. The captains swung the men about.  "Forward! March!" they shouted.    
The fat man stood with his mouth open and looked at the men. "What's  going on down there? What do you mean? Quit that!" he bawled.    
A derisive laugh floated up through the window.    
"Attention! Forward, guide right!" shouted a captain.    
The men went swinging down the broad cement sidewalk past the window  and the advertising man. In their faces was something determined and  grim. A sickly smile flitted across the face of the grey-haired man  and then faded. The advertising man, without knowing just what was  going on felt that the older man was afraid. He sensed the terror in  his face. In his heart he was glad to see it.    
The manufacturer began to talk excitedly. "Now what's this?" he  demanded. "What's going on? What kind of a volcano are we men of  affairs walking over? Haven't we had enough trouble with labour? What  are they doing now?" Again he walked up and down past the table where  the advertising man sat looking at him. "We'll let the book go," he  said. "Come to-morrow. Come any time. I want to look into this. I want  to find out what's going on."    
Leaving the office of the bicycle company John Van Moore ran along the  street past stores and houses. He did not try to follow the Marching  Men but ran forward blindly, filled with excitement. He remembered the  words of the newspaper man about the song of labour, and was drunk  with the thought that he had caught the swing of it. A hundred times  he had seen men pouring out of factory doors at the end of the day.  Always before they had been just a mass of individuals. Each had been  thinking of his own affairs and each man had shuffled off into his own  street and had been lost in the dim alleyways between the tall grimy  buildings. Now all of this was changed. The men did not shuffle off  alone but marched along the street shoulder to shoulder.    
A lump came also into the throat of this man and he like that other by  the factory wall began to say words. "The song of labour is here. It  has begun to get itself sung!" he cried.    
John Van Moore was beside himself. The face of the fat man pale with  terror came back into his mind. On the sidewalk before a grocery store  he stopped and shouted with delight. Then he began dancing wildly  about, startling a group of children who with fingers in their mouths  stood with staring eyes watching.
