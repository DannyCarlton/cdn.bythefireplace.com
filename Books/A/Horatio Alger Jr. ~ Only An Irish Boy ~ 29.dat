  Sometimes, the mere presence of a person in the room is sufficient  to interrupt even sound repose. At all events, whether it was the  entrance of Fairfax, acting in some mysterious way upon Andy, or the  light that streamed into the room, his slumber was disturbed, and his  eyes opened just as the adventurer was retiring, with his supposed  booty.
  Our hero did not immediately take in the situation. He was naturally  a little bewildered, being just aroused from sleep, but in a short time  the real state of the case dawned upon him.
  &#8220;By the powers!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;it's that man that went to the  museum with me! He saw my money, and he came in for it! I'll get up and  see.&#8221;
  Quietly and noiselessly he got out of bed, and, going to the chair,  felt in his pockets, and so discovered the loss of the stuffed  pocketbook.
  Andy wanted to laugh, but forbore, lest the sound should be heard in  the next room.
  &#8220;It's a good joke on the dirty thafe!&#8221; said Andy, to himself. &#8220;He's  welcome to all the money, he's got&#8212;it won't carry him far, I'm  thinkin'.&#8221;
  Prudence suggested another thought. When Fairfax found out the  worthlessness of his booty, would he not come back and search for the  real treasure?
  &#8220;If he does, I'll fight him,&#8221; thought Andy.
  Still, he knew the conflict would be unequal, since the other was  considerably his superior in strength. However, Andy determined that,  come what might, he would defend his trust, &#8220;or perish in the attempt.&#8221;  But, while he was coming to this determination, he heard the door of  the adjoining chamber open softly, and then he could hear steps along  the corridor. Evidently, the thief had not found out the actual  character of his booty, but was going off under the impression that it  was valuable.
  &#8220;Maybe he'll come back,&#8221; thought Andy. &#8220;I guess I'd better go down  and give notice at the desk. Then, if he comes back, he'll get into hot  water.&#8221;
  He hastily dressed himself, and, locking his door, went downstairs.  First, however, he removed the money from under his pillow, and put it  into his pocket. He found the clerk at the desk.
  &#8220;Has the man that came in with me gone out?&#8221; asked Andy.
  &#8220;Mr. Marvin?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;He went out about five minutes ago.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did he say anything about coming back?&#8221;
  &#8220;He said it would be late when he returned. He asked me if we kept  open after twelve. Did you want to find him?&#8221;
  &#8220;I should like to have the police find him,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;How is that?&#8221; asked the clerk, surprised.
  &#8220;He has robbed me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you leave your door unlocked?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; but there was a door between our rooms. He opened it, and stole  a pocketbook from the pocket of my coat.&#8221;
  &#8220;While you were asleep?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; but I awoke just in time to see him go through the door.&#8221;
  &#8220;How much money was there in it?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the joke of it,&#8221; said Andy, laughing; &#8220;there was no money at  all, only some folds of paper. He got hold of the wrong pocketbook.&#8221;
  Thereupon, he told the story of the &#8220;drop game,&#8221; of which he came  near being a victim, and what a useful turn the bogus treasure had done  him.
  &#8220;There's the right pocketbook,&#8221; he said, in conclusion. &#8220;I wish you  would take care of it for me till to-morrow. The money isn't mine, and  I don't want to run any more risk with it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll lock it up in the safe for you,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;Is there  much?&#8221;
  &#8220;Several hundred dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;You were very fortunate in escaping as you did,&#8221; said the clerk.
  &#8220;True for you,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;He may come back when he finds out how  he has been fooled.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he does, I'll call a policeman. We'll make short work with him.&#8221;
  The reader has already heard how Fairfax (or Marvin) did return, and  how he met with a reception he had not calculated upon. Andy was  informed in the morning that it would be necessary for him to appear as  a witness against him in order to secure his conviction. This he did  the next day, but the judge delayed sentence, on being informed that  the accused was charged with a more serious offense, that of stopping a  traveler on the highway. His trial on this count must come before a  higher court, and he was remanded to prison till his case was called in  the calendar. Andy was informed that he would be summoned as a witness  in that case also, as well as Colonel Preston, and answered that he  would be ready when called upon.
  We will so far anticipate events as to say that the testimony of  Andy and the colonel was considered conclusive by the court, and, on  the strength of it, Mr. Fairfax, alias Marvin, was sentenced to several  years' imprisonment at hard labor.
  Andy met with no further adventures in his present visit, but had  the satisfaction of delivering the money he had been sent to collect to  Miss Priscilla Grant.
  Now, advancing our story some three months, we come to an afternoon  when Miss Sophia Grant, returning from a walk, with visible marks of  excitement, rushed, breathless and panting, into her sister's presence.
  &#8220;What's the matter, Sophia?&#8221; asked Priscilla.
  &#8220;Such an awful thing!&#8221; she gasped.
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't believe it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tell me at once what it is!&#8221;
  &#8220;It seems so sudden!&#8221;
  &#8220;Good heavens! Sophia, why do you tantalize me so?&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so!&#8221; gasped Sophia.
  &#8220;If you don't tell me, I'll shake you!&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston's dead&#8212;dropped dead in the store ten minutes ago.  I was there, and saw him.&#8221;
  This startling intelligence was only too true. Suddenly, without an  instant's warning, the colonel had been summoned from life&#8212;succumbing  to a fit of apoplexy. This event, of course, made a great sensation in  the village, but it is of most interest to us as it affects the  fortunes of our young hero.
