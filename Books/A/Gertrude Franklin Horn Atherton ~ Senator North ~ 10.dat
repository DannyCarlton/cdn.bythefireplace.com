Betty rose suddenly from the breakfast-table and went into the  library, carrying a half-read letter. She had felt her face flush and  her hand tremble, and escaped from the servants into a room where she  could think alone for hours, if she wished.    
The letter ran as follows:--    
THE PARSONAGE, ST. ANDREW, VIRGINIA.<br>  To MISS ELIZABETH MADISON:    
DEAR MADAM,--I have a communication of a somewhat trying nature to  make, and believe me; I would not make it were not my end very near.  Your father, dear madam, the late Harold Carter Madison, left an  illegitimate daughter by a woman whom he loved for many years, an  octaroon named Cassandra Lee. Before his death he gave poor Cassie a  certain sum of money, and made her promise to leave Washington and  never return. She came here and devoted the few remaining years  of her life to the care of her child. I and my wife were the only  persons who knew her story, and when she was dying we willingly  promised to take the little one. For the last ten years Harriet has  lived here in the parsonage and has been the only child I have ever  known,--a dearly beloved child. She has been carefully educated and is  a lady in every sense of the word. I had until the last two years a  little school, and she was my chief assistant. But the public school  proved more attractive--and doubtless is more thorough--and this  passed from me. Last year my wife died. Now I am going, and very  rapidly. I have only just learned the nature of my illness, and I may  be dead before you receive this letter. I write to beg you to receive  your sister. There is no argument I can use, dear lady, which your own  conscience will not dictate. You will not be ashamed of her. She shows  not a trace of the taint in her blood. The money your father gave  Cassie has gone long since, but Harriet asks no alms of you, only  that you will help her to go somewhere far from those who know that  she is not as white as she looks, and to give her a chance to earn her  living. She is well fitted to be a governess or companion, and no  doubt you could easily place her. But she is lonely and frightened and  miserable. Be merciful and receive her into your home for a time.    
"I dare not write this to your mother. She has no cause to feel warmly  to Harriet. But you are young, and wealthy in your own right. Her  future rests with you. Here in this village she can do absolutely  nothing, and after I am buried she will not have enough to keep her  for a month. Answer to her--she bears my name."    <p align="right">  I am, dear lady,<br>     Your humble and obd't servant,<br>     ABRAHAM WALKER.    
P. S. Harriet is twenty-three. She has letters in her possession which  prove her parentage.    
Betty's first impulse was to take the next train for St. Andrew. Her  heart went out to the lonely girl, deprived of her only protector,  wretched under the triple load of poverty, friendlessness, and the  curse of race. She remembered vividly those two men in the church  whose bearing expressed more forcibly than any words the canker that  had blighted their manhood. And this girl bore no visible mark of the  wrong that had been done her, and only needed the opportunity to be  happy and respected. Could duty be more plain? And was she a chosen  instrument to right one at least of the great wrongs perpetrated by  the brilliant, warm-hearted, reckless men of her race?    
But in a moment she shuddered and dropped the letter, a wave of horror  and disgust rising within her. This girl was her half-sister, and was,  light or dark, a negress. Betty had seen too much of the world in her  twenty-seven years to weep at the discovery of her father's weakness,  or to shrink from a woman so unhappy as to be born out of wedlock; but  she was Southern to her finger-tips: the blacks were a despised, an  unspeakably inferior race, and they had been slaves for hundreds of  years to the white man. To be sure, she loved the old family servants,  and rarely said a harsh word to them, and it was a matter of  indifference to her that they had been freed, as she had plenty of  money to pay their wages. But that the negro should vote had always  seemed to her incredible and monstrous, and she laughed to herself  when she met on the streets the smartly dressed coloured folk out for  a walk. They seemed farcically unreal, travesties on the people to  whom a discriminating Almighty had given the world. To her the entire  race were first slaves, then servants, entitled to all kindness so  long as they kept their place, but to be stepped on the moment they  presumed. She recoiled in growing disgust from this girl with the  hidden drop of black in her body.    
But her reasoning faculty was accustomed to work independently of her  brain's inherited impressions. She stamped her foot and anathematized  herself for a narrow-minded creature whose will was weaker than her  prejudices. The girl was blameless, helpless. She might have a mind as  good as her own, be as well fitted to enjoy the higher pleasures of  life. And she might have a beauty and a temperament which would be her  ruin did her natural protectors tell her that she was a pariah, an  outcast, that they could have none of her. Betty conjured her up, a  charming and pathetic vision; but in vain. The repulsion was physical,  inherited from generations of proud and intolerant women, and she  could not control it.    
She longed desperately for a confidant and adviser. Her mother she  could not speak to until she had made up her mind. Emory and Sally  Carter would tell her to give the creature an allowance and think no  more about her; and the matter went deeper than that. The girl had  heart and an educated mind; her demands were subtle and complex.  Senator Burleigh? He would laugh impatiently at her prejudices, and  tell her that she ought to go out and live in the free fresh air  of the West. They probably would quarrel irremediably. Mary Montgomery  would only stare. Betty could hear her exclaim: "But why? What? And  you say she is quite white? I do not think that negroes are as nice as  white people, of course; but I cannot understand your really tragic  aversion."    
There was only one person to whom it would be a luxury to talk,  Senator North. She knew that he would not only understand but  sympathize with her, and she was sure he would give her wise counsel.  She regretted bitterly that she had not been able to make a friend of  him, as she had of several of his colleagues. She would have sent for  him without hesitation.    
She glanced at the clock; it pointed to ten minutes past ten. He was  doubtless at that moment in his Committee Room looking over his  correspondence. She knew that Senators received letters at the rate of  a hundred a day, and were early risers in consequence. If only she  dared to go to him, if only he were not so desperately busy. But he  had intimated that he had leisure moments, had taken the trouble to  say that it would give him pleasure to serve her. Why should he not?  What if he were a Senator? Was she not a Woman? Why should she of all  women hesitate to demand a half-hour's time of any man? She needed  advice, must have it: a decision should be reached in the next twenty-  four hours. Not for a second did she admit that she was building up an  excuse for the long-desired interview with Senator North. She was a  woman confronted with a solemn problem. Her coupe was at the door; she  had planned a morning's shopping. She ran upstairs and dressed herself  for the street, wondering what order she would give the footman. She  changed her mind hurriedly twenty times, but was careful to select the  most becoming street-frock she possessed, a gentian blue cloth trimmed  with sable. There were three hats to match it, and she tried on each,  to the surprise of her maid, who usually found her easy to please. She  finally decided upon a small toque which was made to set well back  from her face into the heavy waves of her hair. She was too wise to  wear a veil, for her complexion was flawless, her forehead low and  full, and her hair arranged loosely about it; she wore no fringe.    
As the footman closed the door of the coupe and she said curtly, "The  Capitol," she knew that her mind had made itself up in the moment that  it had conceived the possibility of a call upon Senator North.    
That point settled, she was calm until she reached the familiar  entrance to the Senate wing, and rehearsed the coming interview.    
But her cheeks were hot and her knees were trembling as she left the  elevator and hurried down the corridor to the Committee Room which  Burleigh, when showing her over the building one morning, had pointed  out as Senator North's. She never had felt so nervous. She wondered if  women felt this sudden terror of the outraged proprieties when  hastening to a tryst of which the world must know nothing. And she was  overwhelmed with the vivid consciousness that she was actually about  to demand the time and attention of one of the busiest and most  eminent men in the country. If it had not been for a stubborn and  long-tried will, she would have turned and run.    
A mulatto was sitting before the door. When she asked, with a  successful attempt at composure, for Senator North, he demanded her  card. She happened to have one in her purse, and he went into the room  and closed the door, leaving her to be stared at by the strolling  sight-seers.    
The mulatto reopened the door and invited her to enter a large room  with a long table, a bookcase, and a number of leather chairs. Before  he had led her far, Senator North appeared within the doorway of an  inner room.    
"I am glad to see you," he said. "I know that you are in trouble or  you would not have done me this honour. It is an honour, and as I told  you before I shall feel it a privilege to serve you in any way. Sit  here, by the fire."    
Betty felt so grateful for his effort to put her at her ease, so  delighted that he was all her imagination had pictured, and had not  snubbed her in what she conceived to be the superior senatorial  manner, that she flung herself into the easy-chair and burst into  tears.    
Senator North knew women as well as a man can. He let the storm pass,  poked the already glowing fire, and lowered two of the window-shades.    
"I feel so stupid," said Betty, calming herself abruptly. "I have no  right to take up your time, and I shall say what I have to say and  go."    
"I have practically nothing to do for the next hour. Please consider  it yours."    
Betty stole a glance at him. He was leaning back in his chair  regarding her intently. It was impossible to say whether his eyes had  softened or not, but he looked kind and interested.    
"I never have told you that your father was a great friend of mine,"  he said. "You really have a claim on me." In spite of the fact that  the Congressional Directory gave him sixty years, he looked anything  but fatherly. Although there never was the slightest affectation of  youth in his dress or manner, he suggested threescore years as little.  So strong was his individuality that Betty could not imagine him  having been at any time other than he was now. He was Senator North,  that was the rounded fact; years had nothing to do with him.    
"Well, I'm glad you knew papa; it will help you to understand. I--But  perhaps you had better read this."    
She took the clergyman's letter from her muff, and Senator North put  on a pair of steel-rimmed eyeglasses and read it. When he had finished  he put the eyeglasses in his pocket, folded the letter, and handed it  to her. He had read the contents with equal deliberation. It seemed  impossible that he would act otherwise in any circumstance.    
"Well?" he said, looking keenly at her. "What are you going to do  about it?"    
"I am ashamed to tell you how I have felt. But we Southerners feel so  strongly on--on--that subject--it is difficult to explain!"    
"We Northerners know exactly how you feel," he said dryly. "We should  be singularly obtuse if we did not. However, do not for a moment  imagine that I am unsympathetic. We all have our prejudices, and the  strongest one is a part of us. And for the matter of that, the average  American is no more anxious to marry a woman with negro blood in her  than the Southerner is, and looks down upon the Black from almost as  lofty a height. Only our prejudice is passive, for he is not the  constant source of annoyance and anxiety with us that he is with you."    
"Then you understand how repulsive it is to me to have a sister who is  white by accident only, and how torn I am between pity for her and a  physical antipathy that I cannot overcome?"    
"I understand perfectly."    
"That is why I have come to you--to ask you what I <i>must</i> do. This is  the first time I have been confronted by a real problem; my life has  been so smooth and my trials so petty. It is too great a problem for  me to solve by myself, and I could not think of anybody's advice but  yours that--that I would take," she finished, with her first flash of  humour.    
"I fully expect you to take the advice I am going to give you. Your  duty is plain; you must do all you can for this girl. But by no means  receive her into your house until you have made her acquaintance. Take  the ten o'clock B. & O. to-morrow morning and go to St. Andrew; it is  about four hours' journey and on the line of the railroad. Spend  several hours with the girl, and, if she is worth the trouble, bring  her back with you and do all you can for her: it would be cruel and  heartless to refuse her consolation if she is all this old man  describes--and you are not cruel and heartless. And if this drop of  black blood is abhorrent to you, think what it must be to her. It is  enough to torment a high-strung woman into insanity or suicide. On the  other hand, if she is common, or looks as if she had a violent temper,  or is conceited and self-sufficient like so many of that hybrid race,  settle an income on her and send her to Europe: in placing her above  temptation you will have done your duty."    
"But that is the whole point--to be sure that <i>you</i> do the right  thing."    
"I almost hope she will be impossible, so that I can wipe her off the  slate at once. Otherwise it will be a terrible problem."    
"It is no problem at all. There is no problem in plain duty. Problems  exist principally in works of fiction and in the minds of unoccupied  women. If you meet each development of every question in the most  natural and reasonable manner,--presupposing that you possess that  highest attribute of civilization, common-sense,--no question will  ever resolve itself into a problem. And difficulties usually disappear  as the range of vision contracts. If your house takes fire, you save  what you can, not what you have elaborately planned to save in case of  fire. Train your common-sense and let the windy analysis pertaining  to problems alone."    
"But how can I ever get over the horror of the thing, Mr. North?"    
"You will forget all about it when she has been your daily companion  for a few weeks. If she lacked a nose, you would as soon cease to  remember it. If this girl is worth liking, you will like her, and soon  cease to feel tragic. Leave that to her!"    
"I know that you are right, and of course I shall take your advice. I  did not come here to trouble you for nothing. But if I liked her at  first and not afterward--"    
"Pack her off to Europe. Europe will console an American woman for  every ill in life. If you take the right attitude in the beginning, it  all rests with her after that. You will have but one duty further. If  she wishes to marry, you must tell the man the truth, if she will not.  Don't hesitate on that point a moment. Her children are liable to be  coal-black. That African blood seems to have a curse on it, and the  curse is usually visited on the unoffending."    
"I will, I will," said Betty. She rose, and he rose also and took her  hand in both of his. She felt an almost irresistible desire to put her  head on his shoulder, for she was tired and depressed.    
"Your attitude in the matter is the important thing to me," he said.  "That is why I have spoken so emphatically. You are a child yet, in  spite of your twenty-seven years and your admirable intelligence. This  is practically your first trial, the first time you have been called  upon to make a decision which, either way, is bound to have a strong  effect on your character, and to affect still greater decisions you  may be called upon to make in the future. You have only one defect;  you are not quite serious enough--yet."    
"I feel very serious just now," said Betty, with a sigh; and in truth  she did, and her new-found sister was not the only thing that  perplexed her.    
"One of these days you will be a singularly perfect woman," he added,  and then he dropped her hand and walked to the door. As he was about  to open it, she touched his arm timidly.    
"Will you come and see me on Sunday?" she asked. "I shall have been  through a good deal between now and then, and I shall want--I shall  want to talk to you."    
"I will come," he said.    
"Not before half-past four. My mother will be asleep then, and my  cousin, Jack Emory, have gone home--there will be so many things I  shall want to talk to you about."    
"I shall be there at half-past four," he said. "Good-bye. Good-bye."
