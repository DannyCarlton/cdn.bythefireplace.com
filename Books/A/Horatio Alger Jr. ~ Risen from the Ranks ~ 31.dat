  The vacation was over all too soon, yet, brief as it was, Harry  looked back upon it with great satisfaction. He had been kindly  received in the family of a man who stood high in the profession which  he was ambitious to enter; he had gratified his curiosity to see the  chief city of New England; and, by no means least, he had secured a  position as paid contributor for the &#8220;Standard.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose you will be writing another story soon,&#8221; said Oscar.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I have got the plan of one already.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you should write more than you can get into the 'Standard,' you  had better send something to the 'Weekly Argus.'&#8220;
  &#8220;I will; but I will wait till the 'Standard' prints my first sketch,  so that I can refer to that in writing to the 'Argus.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Perhaps you are right. There's one advantage to not presenting  yourself. They won't know you're only a boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Unless they judge so from my style.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think they would infer it from that. By the way, Harry,  suppose my father could find an opening for you as a reporter on his  paper,&#8212;would you be willing to accept it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not sure whether it would be best for me,&#8221; said Harry, slowly,  &#8220;even if I were qualified.&#8221;
  &#8220;There is more chance to rise on a city paper.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know. If I stay here I may before many years control a  paper of my own. Then, if I want to go into politics, there would be  more chance in the country than in the city.&#8221;
  &#8220;Would you like to go into politics?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am rather too young to decide about that; but if I could be of  service in that way, I don't see why I should not desire it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, Harry, I think you are going the right way to work.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope so. I don't want to be promoted till I am fit for it. I am  going to work hard for the next two or three years.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I were as industrious as you are, Harry.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I wish I knew as much as you do, Oscar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Say no more, or we shall be forming a Mutual Admiration Society,&#8221;  said Oscar, laughing.
  Harry received a cordial welcome back to the printing office. Mr.  Anderson asked him many questions about Mr. Vincent; and our hero felt  that his employer regarded him with increased consideration, on account  of his acquaintance with the great city editor. This consideration was  still farther increased when Mr. Anderson learned our hero's engagement  by the &#8220;Weekly Standard.&#8221;
  Three weeks later, the &#8220;Standard&#8221; published Harry's sketch, and  accepted another, at the same price. Before this latter was printed,  Harry wrote a third sketch, which he called &#8220;Phineas Popkin's  Engagement.&#8221; This he inclosed to the &#8220;Weekly Argus,&#8221; with a letter in  which he referred to his engagement by the &#8220;Standard.&#8221; In reply he  received the following letter:&#8212;
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;BOSTON, Jan., 18&#8212;,
  &#8220;MR. FRANK LYNN,&#8212;Dear Sir: We enclose three dollars for your  sketch,&#8212;'Phineas Popkin's Engagement.' We shall be glad to receive  other sketches, of similar character and length, and, if accepted, we  will pay the same price therefor.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I. B. FITCH &amp;Co.&#8221;
  This was highly satisfactory to Harry. He was now an accepted  contributor to two weekly papers, and the addition to his income would  be likely to reach a hundred dollars a year. All this he would be able  to lay up, and as much or more from his salary on the &#8220;Gazette.&#8221; He  felt on the high road to success. Seeing that his young compositor was  meeting with success and appreciation abroad, Mr. Anderson called upon  him more frequently to write paragraphs for the &#8220;Gazette.&#8221; Though this  work was gratuitous, Harry willingly undertook it. He felt that in this  way he was preparing himself for the career to which he steadily looked  forward. Present compensation, he justly reasoned, was of small  importance, compared with the chance of improvement. In this view,  Ferguson, who proved to be a very judicious friend, fully concurred.  Indeed Harry and he became more intimate than before, if that were  possible, and they felt that Clapp's departure was by no means to be  regretted. They were remarking this one day, when Mr. Anderson, who had  been examining his mail, looked up suddenly, and said, &#8220;What do you  think, Mr. Ferguson? I've got a letter from Clapp.&#8221;
  &#8220;A letter from Clapp? Where is he?&#8221; inquired Ferguson, with  interest.
  &#8220;This letter is dated at St. Louis. He doesn't appear to be doing  very well.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought he was going to California.&#8221;
  &#8220;So he represented. But here is the letter.&#8221; Ferguson took it, and,  after reading, handed it to Harry.
  It ran thus:&#8212;
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;ST. LOUIS, April 4, 18&#8212;.
  &#8220;JOTHAM ANDERSON, ESQ.,&#8212;Dear Sir: Perhaps you will be surprised to  hear from me, but I feel as if I would like to hear from Centreville,  where I worked so long. The man that induced me and Harrison to come  out here left us in the lurch three days after we reached St. Louis. He  said he was going on to San Francisco, and he had only money enough to  pay his own expenses. As Luke and I were not provided with money, we  had a pretty hard time at first, and had to pawn some of our clothes,  or we should have starved. Finally I got a job in the 'Democrat'  office, and a week after, Luke got something to do, though it didn't  pay very well. So we scratched along as well as we could. Part of the  time since we have been out of work, and we haven't found 'coming West'  all that it was cracked up to be.
  &#8220;Are Ferguson and Harry Walton still working for you? I should like  to come back to the 'Gazette' office, and take my old place; but I  haven't got five dollars ahead to pay my travelling expenses. If you  will send me out thirty dollars, I will come right on, and work it out  after I come back. Hoping for an early reply, I am,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Yours respectfully, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;HENRY CLAPP.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you going to send out the money, Mr. Anderson?&#8221; asked Ferguson.
  &#8220;Not I. Now that Walton has got well learnt, I don't need another  workman. I shall respectfully decline his offer.&#8221;
  Both Harry and Ferguson were glad to hear this, for they felt that  Clapp's presence would be far from making the office more agreeable.
  &#8220;Here's a letter for you, Walton, also post-marked St. Louis,&#8221; said  Mr. Anderson, just afterward.
  Harry took it with surprise, and opened it at once.
  &#8220;It's from Luke Harrison,&#8221; he said, looking at the signature.
  &#8220;Does he want you to send him thirty dollars?&#8221; asked Ferguson.
  &#8220;Listen and I will read the letter.&#8221;
  &#8220;DEAR HARRY,&#8221; it commenced, &#8220;you will perhaps think it strange that  I have written to you; but we used to be good friends. I write to tell  you that I don't like this place. I haven't got along well, and I want  to get back. Now I am going to ask of you a favor. Will you lend me  thirty or forty dollars, to pay my fare home? I will pay you back in a  month or two months sure, after I get to work. I will also pay you the  few dollars which I borrowed some time ago. I ought to have done it  before, but I was thoughtless, and I kept putting it off. Now, Harry, I  know you have the money, and you can lend it to me just as well as not,  and I'll be sure to pay it back before you need it. Just get a  post-office order, and send it to Luke Harrison, 17 R&#8212;&#8212;Street, St.  Louis, and I'll be sure to get it. Give my respects to Mr. Anderson,  and also to Mr. Ferguson.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Your friend, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;LUKE HARRISON.&#8221;
  &#8220;There is a chance for a first-class investment, Harry,&#8221; said  Ferguson.
  &#8220;Do you want to join me in it?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I would rather pay the money to have 'your friend' keep away.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want to be unkind or disobliging,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but I don't  feel like giving Luke this money. I know he would never pay me back.&#8221;
  &#8220;Say no, then.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will. Luke will be mad, but I can't help it.&#8221;
  So both Mr. Anderson and Harry wrote declining to lend. The latter,  in return, received a letter from Luke, denouncing him as a &#8220;mean,  miserly hunks;&#8221; but even this did not cause him to regret his decision.
