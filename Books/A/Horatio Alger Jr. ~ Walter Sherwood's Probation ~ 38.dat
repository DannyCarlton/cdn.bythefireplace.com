  At length they reached Shelby. Colonel Owen lived in a large and   handsome mansion with ample grounds. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I have a comfortable home, but my boys are away,  and  my wife and I feel lonely in this large house. It will brighten us   both to have a young face at the table.&quot; 
  How could Walter feel otherwise than pleased. He was charmed with  Mrs.  Owen. 
  &quot;I am glad to see you,&quot; she said. &quot;May I call you Walter?&quot; 
  &quot;I wish you would, Mrs. Owen,&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;Did you find your horse, Richard?&quot; she added. 
  &quot;Yes, my dear.&quot; 
  &quot;Did you see the man that stole it?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; with a quiet wink at Walter. 
  &quot;I invited the horse thief to come and make us a visit.&quot; 
  Mrs. Owen certainly was amazed. 
  &quot;You did!&quot; she ejaculated. &quot;When is he coming?&quot; 
  &quot;He is here already.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't understand you at all, Richard. You seem to be joking.&quot; 
  &quot;Not at all! There he stands!&quot; and the colonel pointed to Walter. 
  &quot;What, Walter?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I had better go to the hotel,&quot; suggested Walter. 
  &quot;No, no! I can't believe anything evil of a young man with your  face,&quot;  said Mrs. Owen. &quot;I am glad my husband brought you home with  him.&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure you will both be kind to me,&quot; said Walter earnestly,  &quot;and I  shall appreciate it the more because I have neither father nor   mother.&quot; 
  One afternoon Colonel Owen came in radiant. 
  &quot;Well, Walter,&quot; he said, &quot;I've got some work for you to do.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Hayward, the teacher of our classical school, is summoned to  his  home. The question is, Who shall take his place till the end of  the  school year? 
  &quot;I have mentioned your name to the trustees, who are ready to  accept  you on my recommendation.&quot; 
  &quot;There is nothing I should like better,&quot; he said, &quot;but do you think  I  am competent?&quot; 
  &quot;You ought to be able to teach any of the classes that will come  under  your charge. How are you in mathematics?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I shall have any difficulty there, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you're better off than I am.&quot; 
  &quot;How much salary shall I receive?&quot; asked Walter, who was beginning  to  grow interested. 
  &quot;Twenty-five dollars a week. That's what the trustees authorize me  to  offer you.&quot; 
  &quot;That will be quite satisfactory. How my old chums will stare when  I  tell them I am getting twenty-five dollars a week for teaching a   classical school. I suppose,&quot; added Walter, hesitating, &quot;I ought to   look out for a boarding-place.&quot; 
  &quot;What, and leave us?&quot; asked the old lady reproachfully. 
  &quot;But, Colonel Owen, remember that I shall be earning a good  salary.&quot; 
  &quot;You can find a use for it. It will help make up for some of the   losses you have incurred. Shall I say you will accept the post?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir. I will try it, and hope to succeed.&quot;
