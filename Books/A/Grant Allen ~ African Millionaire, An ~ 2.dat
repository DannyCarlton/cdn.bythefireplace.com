"Let us take a trip to Switzerland," said Lady Vandrift. And any one  who knows Amelia will not be surprised to learn that we <i>did</i> take a  trip to Switzerland accordingly. Nobody can drive Sir Charles, except  his wife. And nobody at all can drive Amelia.    
There were difficulties at the outset, because we had not ordered  rooms at the hotels beforehand, and it was well on in the season;  but they were overcome at last by the usual application of a golden  key; and we found ourselves in due time pleasantly quartered in  Lucerne, at that most comfortable of European hostelries, the  Schweitzerhof.    
We were a square party of four--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and  Isabel. We had nice big rooms, on the first floor, overlooking the  lake; and as none of us was possessed with the faintest symptom of  that incipient mania which shows itself in the form of an insane  desire to climb mountain heights of disagreeable steepness and  unnecessary snowiness, I will venture to assert we all enjoyed  ourselves. We spent most of our time sensibly in lounging about the  lake on the jolly little steamers; and when we did a mountain climb,  it was on the Rigi or Pilatus--where an engine undertook all the  muscular work for us.    
As usual, at the hotel, a great many miscellaneous people showed a  burning desire to be specially nice to us. If you wish to see how  friendly and charming humanity is, just try being a well-known  millionaire for a week, and you'll learn a thing or two. Wherever  Sir Charles goes he is surrounded by charming and disinterested  people, all eager to make his distinguished acquaintance, and all  familiar with several excellent investments, or several deserving  objects of Christian charity. It is my business in life, as his  brother-in-law and secretary, to decline with thanks the excellent  investments, and to throw judicious cold water on the objects of  charity. Even I myself, as the great man's almoner, am very much  sought after. People casually allude before me to artless stories  of "poor curates in Cumberland, you know, Mr. Wentworth," or widows  in Cornwall, penniless poets with epics in their desks, and young  painters who need but the breath of a patron to open to them the  doors of an admiring Academy. I smile and look wise, while I  administer cold water in minute doses; but I never report one of  these cases to Sir Charles, except in the rare or almost unheard-of  event where I think there is really something in them.    
Ever since our little adventure with the Seer at Nice, Sir Charles,  who is constitutionally cautious, had been even more careful than  usual about possible sharpers. And, as chance would have it, there  sat just opposite us at table d'hote at the Schweitzerhof--'tis  a fad of Amelia's to dine at table d'hote; she says she can't bear  to be boxed up all day in private rooms with "too much family"--a  sinister-looking man with dark hair and eyes, conspicuous by his  bushy overhanging eyebrows. My attention was first called to the  eyebrows in question by a nice little parson who sat at our side,  and who observed that they were made up of certain large and bristly  hairs, which (he told us) had been traced by Darwin to our monkey  ancestors. Very pleasant little fellow, this fresh-faced young  parson, on his honeymoon tour with a nice wee wife, a bonnie Scotch  lassie with a charming accent.    
I looked at the eyebrows close. Then a sudden thought struck me. "Do  you believe they're his own?" I asked of the curate; "or are they  only stuck on--a make-up disguise? They really almost look like it."    
"You don't suppose--" Charles began, and checked himself suddenly.    
"Yes, I do," I answered; "the Seer!" Then I recollected my blunder,  and looked down sheepishly. For, to say the truth, Vandrift had  straightly enjoined on me long before to say nothing of our painful  little episode at Nice to Amelia; he was afraid if <i>she</i> once heard  of it, <i>he</i> would hear of it for ever after.    
"What Seer?" the little parson inquired, with parsonical curiosity.    
I noticed the man with the overhanging eyebrows give a queer sort  of start. Charles's glance was fixed upon me. I hardly knew what  to answer.    
"Oh, a man who was at Nice with us last year," I stammered out,  trying hard to look unconcerned. "A fellow they talked about,  that's all." And I turned the subject.    
But the curate, like a donkey, wouldn't let me turn it.    
"Had he eyebrows like that?" he inquired, in an undertone. I was  really angry. If this <i>was</i> Colonel Clay, the curate was obviously  giving him the cue, and making it much more difficult for us to  catch him, now we might possibly have lighted on the chance of  doing so.    
"No, he hadn't," I answered testily; "it was a passing expression.  But this is not the man. I was mistaken, no doubt." And I nudged  him gently.    
The little curate was too innocent for anything. "Oh, I see," he  replied, nodding hard and looking wise. Then he turned to his wife  and made an obvious face, which the man with the eyebrows couldn't  fail to notice.    
Fortunately, a political discussion going on a few places farther  down the table spread up to us and diverted attention for a moment.  The magical name of Gladstone saved us. Sir Charles flared up. I  was truly pleased, for I could see Amelia was boiling over with  curiosity by this time.    
After dinner, in the billiard-room, however, the man with the big  eyebrows sidled up and began to talk to me. If he <i>was</i> Colonel  Clay, it was evident he bore us no grudge at all for the five  thousand pounds he had done us out of. On the contrary, he seemed  quite prepared to do us out of five thousand more when opportunity  offered; for he introduced himself at once as Dr. Hector Macpherson,  the exclusive grantee of extensive concessions from the Brazilian  Government on the Upper Amazons. He dived into conversation with  me at once as to the splendid mineral resources of his Brazilian  estate--the silver, the platinum, the actual rubies, the possible  diamonds. I listened and smiled; I knew what was coming. All he  needed to develop this magnificent concession was a little more  capital. It was sad to see thousands of pounds' worth of platinum  and car-loads of rubies just crumbling in the soil or carried away  by the river, for want of a few hundreds to work them with properly.  If he knew of anybody, now, with money to invest, he could recommend  him--nay, offer him--a unique opportunity of earning, say, 40 per  cent on his capital, on unimpeachable security.    
"I wouldn't do it for every man," Dr. Hector Macpherson remarked,  drawing himself up; "but if I took a fancy to a fellow who had  command of ready cash, I might choose to put him in the way of  feathering his nest with unexampled rapidity."    
"Exceedingly disinterested of you," I answered drily, fixing my  eyes on his eyebrows.    
The little curate, meanwhile, was playing billiards with Sir  Charles. His glance followed mine as it rested for a moment on  the monkey-like hairs.    
"False, obviously false," he remarked with his lips; and I'm bound  to confess I never saw any man speak so well by movement alone;  you could follow every word though not a sound escaped him.    
During the rest of that evening Dr. Hector Macpherson stuck to me  as close as a mustard-plaster. And he was almost as irritating. I  got heartily sick of the Upper Amazons. I have positively waded in  my time through ruby mines (in prospectuses, I mean) till the mere  sight of a ruby absolutely sickens me. When Charles, in an unwonted  fit of generosity, once gave his sister Isabel (whom I had the  honour to marry) a ruby necklet (inferior stones), I made Isabel  change it for sapphires and amethysts, on the judicious plea that  they suited her complexion better. (I scored one, incidentally, for  having considered Isabel's complexion.) By the time I went to bed  I was prepared to sink the Upper Amazons in the sea, and to stab,  shoot, poison, or otherwise seriously damage the man with the  concession and the false eyebrows.    
For the next three days, at intervals, he returned to the charge. He  bored me to death with his platinum and his rubies. He didn't want a  capitalist who would personally exploit the thing; he would prefer  to do it all on his own account, giving the capitalist preference  debentures of his bogus company, and a lien on the concession. I  listened and smiled; I listened and yawned; I listened and was rude;  I ceased to listen at all; but still he droned on with it. I fell  asleep on the steamer one day, and woke up in ten minutes to hear  him droning yet, "And the yield of platinum per ton was certified  to be--" I forget how many pounds, or ounces, or pennyweights.  These details of assays have ceased to interest me: like the man  who "didn't believe in ghosts," I have seen too many of them.    
The fresh-faced little curate and his wife, however, were quite  different people. He was a cricketing Oxford man; she was a breezy  Scotch lass, with a wholesome breath of the Highlands about her. I  called her "White Heather." Their name was Brabazon. Millionaires  are so accustomed to being beset by harpies of every description,  that when they come across a young couple who are simple and  natural, they delight in the purely human relation. We picnicked  and went excursions a great deal with the honeymooners. They were  so frank in their young love, and so proof against chaff, that we  all really liked them. But whenever I called the pretty girl "White  Heather," she looked so shocked, and cried: "Oh, Mr. Wentworth!"  Still, we were the best of friends. The curate offered to row us in  a boat on the lake one day, while the Scotch lassie assured us she  could take an oar almost as well as he did. However, we did not  accept their offer, as row-boats exert an unfavourable influence  upon Amelia's digestive organs.    
"Nice young fellow, that man Brabazon," Sir Charles said to me one  day, as we lounged together along the quay; "never talks about  advowsons or next presentations. Doesn't seem to me to care two pins  about promotion. Says he's quite content in his country curacy;  enough to live upon, and needs no more; and his wife has a little, a  very little, money. I asked him about his poor to-day, on purpose to  test him: these parsons are always trying to screw something out of  one for their poor; men in my position know the truth of the saying  that we have that class of the population always with us. Would  you believe it, he says he hasn't any poor at all in his parish!  They're all well-to-do farmers or else able-bodied labourers, and  his one terror is that somebody will come and try to pauperise them.  'If a philanthropist were to give me fifty pounds to-day for use at  Empingham,' he said, 'I assure you, Sir Charles, I shouldn't know  what to do with it. I think I should buy new dresses for Jessie, who  wants them about as much as anybody else in the village--that is to  say, not at all.' There's a parson for you, Sey, my boy. Only wish  we had one of his sort at Seldon."    
"He certainly doesn't want to get anything out of you," I answered.    
That evening at dinner a queer little episode happened. The man  with the eyebrows began talking to me across the table in his usual  fashion, full of his wearisome concession on the Upper Amazons. I  was trying to squash him as politely as possible, when I caught  Amelia's eye. Her look amused me. She was engaged in making signals  to Charles at her side to observe the little curate's curious  sleeve-links. I glanced at them, and saw at once they were a  singular possession for so unobtrusive a person. They consisted  each of a short gold bar for one arm of the link, fastened by a  tiny chain of the same material to what seemed to my tolerably  experienced eye--a first-rate diamond. Pretty big diamonds, too,  and of remarkable shape, brilliancy, and cutting. In a moment I  knew what Amelia meant. She owned a diamond riviere, said to be  of Indian origin, but short by two stones for the circumference  of her tolerably ample neck. Now, she had long been wanting two  diamonds like these to match her set; but owing to the unusual  shape and antiquated cutting of her own gems, she had never  been able to complete the necklet, at least without removing an  extravagant amount from a much larger stone of the first water.    
The Scotch lassie's eyes caught Amelia's at the same time, and she  broke into a pretty smile of good-humoured amusement. "Taken in  another person, Dick, dear!" she exclaimed, in her breezy way,  turning to her husband. "Lady Vandrift is observing your diamond  sleeve-links."    
"They're very fine gems," Amelia observed incautiously. (A most  unwise admission if she desired to buy them.)    
But the pleasant little curate was too transparently simple a soul  to take advantage of her slip of judgment. "They <i>are</i> good stones,"  he replied; "very good stones--considering. They're not diamonds  at all, to tell you the truth. They're best old-fashioned Oriental  paste. My great-grandfather bought them, after the siege of  Seringapatam, for a few rupees, from a Sepoy who had looted them  from Tippoo Sultan's palace. He thought, like you, he had got a good  thing. But it turned out, when they came to be examined by experts,  they were only paste--very wonderful paste; it is supposed they had  even imposed upon Tippoo himself, so fine is the imitation. But they  are worth--well, say, fifty shillings at the utmost."    
While he spoke Charles looked at Amelia, and Amelia looked at  Charles. Their eyes spoke volumes. The riviere was also supposed to  have come from Tippoo's collection. Both drew at once an identical  conclusion. These were two of the same stones, very likely torn  apart and disengaged from the rest in the melee at the capture of  the Indian palace.    
"Can you take them off?" Sir Charles asked blandly. He spoke in  the tone that indicates business.    
"Certainly," the little curate answered, smiling. "I'm accustomed to  taking them off. They're always noticed. They've been kept in the  family ever since the siege, as a sort of valueless heirloom, for  the sake of the picturesqueness of the story, you know; and nobody  ever sees them without asking, as you do, to examine them closely.  They deceive even experts at first. But they're paste, all the same;  unmitigated Oriental paste, for all that."    
He took them both off, and handed them to Charles. No man in England  is a finer judge of gems than my brother-in-law. I watched him  narrowly. He examined them close, first with the naked eye, then  with the little pocket-lens which he always carries. "Admirable  imitation," he muttered, passing them on to Amelia. "I'm not  surprised they should impose upon inexperienced observers."    
But from the tone in which he said it, I could see at once he had  satisfied himself they were real gems of unusual value. I know  Charles's way of doing business so well. His glance to Amelia meant,  "These are the very stones you have so long been in search of."    
The Scotch lassie laughed a merry laugh. "He sees through them  now, Dick," she cried. "I felt sure Sir Charles would be a judge  of diamonds."    
Amelia turned them over. I know Amelia, too; and I knew from the  way Amelia looked at them that she meant to have them. And when  Amelia means to have anything, people who stand in the way may just  as well spare themselves the trouble of opposing her.    
They were beautiful diamonds. We found out afterwards the little  curate's account was quite correct: these stones <i>had</i> come from  the same necklet as Amelia's riviere, made for a favourite wife of  Tippoo's, who had presumably as expansive personal charms as our  beloved sister-in-law's. More perfect diamonds have seldom been  seen. They have excited the universal admiration of thieves and  connoisseurs. Amelia told me afterwards that, according to legend,  a Sepoy stole the necklet at the sack of the palace, and then fought  with another for it. It was believed that two stones got spilt  in the scuffle, and were picked up and sold by a third person--a  looker-on--who had no idea of the value of his booty. Amelia had  been hunting for them for several years to complete her necklet.    
"They are excellent paste," Sir Charles observed, handing them back.  "It takes a first-rate judge to detect them from the reality. Lady  Vandrift has a necklet much the same in character, but composed  of genuine stones; and as these are so much like them, and would  complete her set, to all outer appearance, I wouldn't mind giving  you, say, 10 pounds for the pair of them."    
Mrs. Brabazon looked delighted. "Oh, sell them to him, Dick," she  cried, "and buy me a brooch with the money! A pair of common  links would do for you just as well. Ten pounds for two paste  stones! It's quite a lot of money."    
She said it so sweetly, with her pretty Scotch accent, that I  couldn't imagine how Dick had the heart to refuse her. But he  did, all the same.    
"No, Jess, darling," he answered. "They're worthless, I know; but  they have for me a certain sentimental value, as I've often told  you. My dear mother wore them, while she lived, as ear-rings; and  as soon as she died I had them set as links in order that I might  always keep them about me. Besides, they have historical and family  interest. Even a worthless heirloom, after all, <i>is</i> an heirloom."    
Dr. Hector Macpherson looked across and intervened. "There is a  part of my concession," he said, "where we have reason to believe a  perfect new Kimberley will soon be discovered. If at any time you  would care, Sir Charles, to look at my diamonds--when I get them--it  would afford me the greatest pleasure in life to submit them to your  consideration."    
Sir Charles could stand it no longer. "Sir," he said, gazing across  at him with his sternest air, "if your concession were as full of  diamonds as Sindbad the Sailor's valley, I would not care to turn my  head to look at them. I am acquainted with the nature and practice  of salting." And he glared at the man with the overhanging eyebrows  as if he would devour him raw. Poor Dr. Hector Macpherson subsided  instantly. We learnt a little later that he was a harmless lunatic,  who went about the world with successive concessions for ruby mines  and platinum reefs, because he had been ruined and driven mad by  speculations in the two, and now recouped himself by imaginary  grants in Burmah and Brazil, or anywhere else that turned up handy.  And his eyebrows, after all, were of Nature's handicraft. We were  sorry for the incident; but a man in Sir Charles's position is such  a mark for rogues that, if he did not take means to protect himself  promptly, he would be for ever overrun by them.    
When we went up to our salon that evening, Amelia flung herself on  the sofa. "Charles," she broke out in the voice of a tragedy queen,  "those are real diamonds, and I shall never be happy again till I  get them."    
"They are real diamonds," Charles echoed. "And you shall have them,  Amelia. They're worth not less than three thousand pounds. But I  shall bid them up gently."    
So, next day, Charles set to work to higgle with the curate.  Brabazon, however, didn't care to part with them. He was no  money-grubber, he said. He cared more for his mother's gift and a  family tradition than for a hundred pounds, if Sir Charles were to  offer it. Charles's eye gleamed. "But if I give you <i>two</i> hundred!"  he said insinuatingly. "What opportunities for good! You could  build a new wing to your village school-house!"    
"We have ample accommodation," the curate answered. "No, I don't  think I'll sell them."    
Still, his voice faltered somewhat, and he looked down at them  inquiringly.    
Charles was too precipitate.    
"A hundred pounds more or less matters little to me," he said; "and  my wife has set her heart on them. It's every man's duty to please  his wife--isn't it, Mrs. Brabazon?--I offer you three hundred."    
The little Scotch girl clasped her hands.    
"Three hundred pounds! Oh, Dick, just think what fun we could have,  and what good we could do with it! Do let him have them."    
Her accent was irresistible. But the curate shook his head.    
"Impossible," he answered. "My dear mother's ear-rings! Uncle  Aubrey would be so angry if he knew I'd sold them. I daren't face  Uncle Aubrey."    
"Has he expectations from Uncle Aubrey?" Sir Charles asked of  White Heather.    
Mrs. Brabazon laughed. "Uncle Aubrey! Oh, dear, no. Poor dear old  Uncle Aubrey! Why, the darling old soul hasn't a penny to bless  himself with, except his pension. He's a retired post captain."  And she laughed melodiously. She was a charming woman.    
"Then I should disregard Uncle Aubrey's feelings," Sir Charles  said decisively.    
"No, no," the curate answered. "Poor dear old Uncle Aubrey! I  wouldn't do anything for the world to annoy him. And he'd be sure  to notice it."    
We went back to Amelia. "Well, have you got them?" she asked.    
"No," Sir Charles answered. "Not yet. But he's coming round, I  think. He's hesitating now. Would rather like to sell them himself,  but is afraid what 'Uncle Aubrey' would say about the matter. His  wife will talk him out of his needless consideration for Uncle  Aubrey's feelings; and to-morrow we'll finally clench the bargain."    
Next morning we stayed late in our salon, where we always  breakfasted, and did not come down to the public rooms till just  before dejeuner, Sir Charles being busy with me over arrears of  correspondence. When we <i>did</i> come down the concierge stepped  forward with a twisted little feminine note for Amelia. She took  it and read it. Her countenance fell. "There, Charles," she cried,  handing it to him, "you've let the chance slip. I shall <i>never</i> be  happy now! They've gone off with the diamonds."    
Charles seized the note and read it. Then he passed it on to me.  It was short, but final:--    
"Thursday, 6 a.m.    
"DEAR LADY VANDRIFT--<i>Will</i> you kindly excuse our having gone off  hurriedly without bidding you good-bye? We have just had a horrid  telegram to say that Dick's favourite sister is <i>dangerously</i> ill of  fever in Paris. I wanted to shake hands with you before we left--you  have all been so sweet to us--but we go by the morning train,  absurdly early, and I wouldn't for worlds disturb you. Perhaps some  day we may meet again--though, buried as we are in a North-country  village, it isn't likely; but in any case, you have secured the  grateful recollection of Yours very cordially, JESSIE BRABAZON.    
"P.S.--Kindest regards to Sir Charles and those <i>dear</i> Wentworths,  and a kiss for yourself, if I may venture to send you one."    
"She doesn't even mention where they've gone," Amelia exclaimed,  in a very bad humour.    
"The concierge may know," Isabel suggested, looking over my  shoulder.    
We asked at his office.    
Yes, the gentleman's address was the Rev. Richard Peploe Brabazon,  Holme Bush Cottage, Empingham, Northumberland.    
Any address where letters might be sent at once, in Paris?    
For the next ten days, or till further notice, Hotel des Deux  Mondes, Avenue de l'Opera.    
Amelia's mind was made up at once.    
"Strike while the iron's hot," she cried. "This sudden illness,  coming at the end of their honeymoon, and involving ten days' more  stay at an expensive hotel, will probably upset the curate's budget.  He'll be glad to sell now. You'll get them for three hundred. It  was absurd of Charles to offer so much at first; but offered once,  of course we must stick to it."    
"What do you propose to do?" Charles asked. "Write, or telegraph?"    
"Oh, how silly men are!" Amelia cried. "Is this the sort of business  to be arranged by letter, still less by telegram? No. Seymour must  start off at once, taking the night train to Paris; and the moment  he gets there, he must interview the curate or Mrs. Brabazon. Mrs.  Brabazon's the best. She has none of this stupid, sentimental  nonsense about Uncle Aubrey."    
It is no part of a secretary's duties to act as a diamond broker.  But when Amelia puts her foot down, she puts her foot down--a fact  which she is unnecessarily fond of emphasising in that identical  proposition. So the self-same evening saw me safe in the train on  my way to Paris; and next morning I turned out of my comfortable  sleeping-car at the Gare de Strasbourg. My orders were to bring back  those diamonds, alive or dead, so to speak, in my pocket to Lucerne;  and to offer any needful sum, up to two thousand five hundred  pounds, for their immediate purchase.    
When I arrived at the Deux Mondes I found the poor little curate  and his wife both greatly agitated. They had sat up all night, they  said, with their invalid sister; and the sleeplessness and suspense  had certainly told upon them after their long railway journey. They  were pale and tired, Mrs. Brabazon, in particular, looking ill and  worried--too much like White Heather. I was more than half ashamed  of bothering them about the diamonds at such a moment, but it  occurred to me that Amelia was probably right--they would now have  reached the end of the sum set apart for their Continental trip,  and a little ready cash might be far from unwelcome.    
I broached the subject delicately. It was a fad of Lady Vandrift's,  I said. She had set her heart upon those useless trinkets. And she  wouldn't go without them. She must and would have them. But the  curate was obdurate. He threw Uncle Aubrey still in my teeth. Three  hundred?--no, never! A mother's present; impossible, dear Jessie!  Jessie begged and prayed; she had grown really attached to Lady  Vandrift, she said; but the curate wouldn't hear of it. I went up  tentatively to four hundred. He shook his head gloomily. It wasn't  a question of money, he said. It was a question of affection. I saw  it was no use trying that tack any longer. I struck out a new line.  "These stones," I said, "I think I ought to inform you, are really  diamonds. Sir Charles is certain of it. Now, is it right for a man  of your profession and position to be wearing a pair of big gems  like those, worth several hundred pounds, as ordinary sleeve-links?  A woman?--yes, I grant you. But for a man, is it manly? And you a  cricketer!"    
He looked at me and laughed. "Will nothing convince you?" he cried.  "They have been examined and tested by half a dozen jewellers, and  we know them to be paste. It wouldn't be right of me to sell them  to you under false pretences, however unwilling on my side. I  <i>couldn't</i> do it."    
"Well, then," I said, going up a bit in my bids to meet him,  "I'll put it like this. These gems are paste. But Lady Vandrift  has an unconquerable and unaccountable desire to possess them.  Money doesn't matter to her. She is a friend of your wife's. As a  personal favour, won't you sell them to her for a thousand?"    
He shook his head. "It would be wrong," he said,--"I might even add,  criminal."    
"But we take all risk," I cried.    
He was absolute adamant. "As a clergyman," he answered, "I feel  I cannot do it."    
"Will <i>you</i> try, Mrs. Brabazon?" I asked.    
The pretty little Scotchwoman leant over and whispered. She coaxed  and cajoled him. Her ways were winsome. I couldn't hear what she  said, but he seemed to give way at last. "I should love Lady  Vandrift to have them," she murmured, turning to me. "She <i>is</i> such  a dear!" And she took out the links from her husband's cuffs and  handed them across to me.    
"How much?" I asked.    
"Two thousand?" she answered, interrogatively. It was a big rise,  all at once; but such are the ways of women.    
"Done!" I replied. "Do you consent?"    
The curate looked up as if ashamed of himself.    
"I consent," he said slowly, "since Jessie wishes it. But as a  clergyman, and to prevent any future misunderstanding, I should  like you to give me a statement in writing that you buy them on my  distinct and positive declaration that they are made of paste--old  Oriental paste--not genuine stones, and that I do not claim any  other qualities for them."    
I popped the gems into my purse, well pleased.    
"Certainly," I said, pulling out a paper. Charles, with his  unerring business instinct, had anticipated the request, and given  me a signed agreement to that effect.    
"You will take a cheque?" I inquired.    
He hesitated.    
"Notes of the Bank of France would suit me better," he answered.    
"Very well," I replied. "I will go out and get them."    
How very unsuspicious some people are! He allowed me to go off--with  the stones in my pocket!    
Sir Charles had given me a blank cheque, not exceeding two thousand  five hundred pounds. I took it to our agents and cashed it for notes  of the Bank of France. The curate clasped them with pleasure. And  right glad I was to go back to Lucerne that night, feeling that I  had got those diamonds into my hands for about a thousand pounds  under their real value!    
At Lucerne railway station Amelia met me. She was positively  agitated.    
"Have you bought them, Seymour?" she asked.    
"Yes," I answered, producing my spoils in triumph.    
"Oh, how dreadful!" she cried, drawing back. "Do you think they're  real? Are you sure he hasn't cheated you?"    
"Certain of it," I replied, examining them. "No one can take me in,  in the matter of diamonds. Why on earth should you doubt them?"    
"Because I've been talking to Mrs. O'Hagan, at the hotel, and she  says there's a well-known trick just like that--she's read of it in  a book. A swindler has two sets--one real, one false; and he makes  you buy the false ones by showing you the real, and pretending he  sells them as a special favour."    
"You needn't be alarmed," I answered. "I am a judge of diamonds."    
"I shan't be satisfied," Amelia murmured, "till Charles has seen  them."    
We went up to the hotel. For the first time in her life I saw Amelia  really nervous as I handed the stones to Charles to examine. Her  doubt was contagious. I half feared, myself, he might break out into  a deep monosyllabic interjection, losing his temper in haste, as he  often does when things go wrong. But he looked at them with a smile,  while I told him the price.    
"Eight hundred pounds less than their value," he answered, well  satisfied.    
"You have no doubt of their reality?" I asked.    
"Not the slightest," he replied, gazing at them. "They are genuine  stones, precisely the same in quality and type as Amelia's necklet."    
Amelia drew a sigh of relief. "I'll go upstairs," she said slowly,  "and bring down my own for you both to compare with them."    
One minute later she rushed down again, breathless. Amelia is far  from slim, and I never before knew her exert herself so actively.    
"Charles, Charles!" she cried, "do you know what dreadful thing  has happened? Two of my own stones are gone. He's stolen a couple  of diamonds from my necklet, and sold them back to me."    
She held out the riviere. It was all too true. Two gems were  missing--and these two just fitted the empty places!    
A light broke in upon me. I clapped my hand to my head. "By Jove,"  I exclaimed, "the little curate is--Colonel Clay!"    
Charles clapped his own hand to his brow in turn. "And Jessie," he  cried, "White Heather--that innocent little Scotchwoman! I often  detected a familiar ring in her voice, in spite of the charming  Highland accent. Jessie is--Madame Picardet!"    
We had absolutely no evidence; but, like the Commissary at Nice,  we felt instinctively sure of it.    
Sir Charles was determined to catch the rogue. This second deception  put him on his mettle. "The worst of the man is," he said, "he has a  method. He doesn't go out of his way to cheat us; he makes us go out  of ours to be cheated. He lays a trap, and we tumble headlong into  it. To-morrow, Sey, we must follow him on to Paris."    
Amelia explained to him what Mrs. O'Hagan had said. Charles took it  all in at once, with his usual sagacity. "That explains," he said,  "why the rascal used this particular trick to draw us on by. If we  had suspected him he could have shown the diamonds were real, and  so escaped detection. It was a blind to draw us off from the fact  of the robbery. He went to Paris to be out of the way when the  discovery was made, and to get a clear day's start of us. What a  consummate rogue! And to do me twice running!"    
"How did he get at my jewel-case, though?" Amelia exclaimed.    
"That's the question," Charles answered. "You <i>do</i> leave it about so!"    
"And why didn't he steal the whole riviere at once, and sell the  gems?" I inquired.    
"Too cunning," Charles replied. "This was much better business. It  isn't easy to dispose of a big thing like that. In the first place,  the stones are large and valuable; in the second place, they're  well known--every dealer has heard of the Vandrift riviere, and seen  pictures of the shape of them. They're marked gems, so to speak. No,  he played a better game--took a couple of them off, and offered them  to the only one person on earth who was likely to buy them without  suspicion. He came here, meaning to work this very trick; he had  the links made right to the shape beforehand, and then he stole the  stones and slipped them into their places. It's a wonderfully clever  trick. Upon my soul, I almost admire the fellow."    
For Charles is a business man himself, and can appreciate business  capacity in others.    
How Colonel Clay came to know about that necklet, and to appropriate  two of the stones, we only discovered much later. I will not here  anticipate that disclosure. One thing at a time is a good rule in  life. For the moment he succeeded in baffling us altogether.    
However, we followed him on to Paris, telegraphing beforehand to the  Bank of France to stop the notes. It was all in vain. They had been  cashed within half an hour of my paying them. The curate and his  wife, we found, quitted the Hotel des Deux Mondes for parts unknown  that same afternoon. And, as usual with Colonel Clay, they vanished  into space, leaving no clue behind them. In other words, they  changed their disguise, no doubt, and reappeared somewhere else that  night in altered characters. At any rate, no such person as the  Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon was ever afterwards heard of--and,  for the matter of that, no such village exists as Empingham,  Northumberland.    
We communicated the matter to the Parisian police. They were <i>most</i>  unsympathetic. "It is no doubt Colonel Clay," said the official  whom we saw; "but you seem to have little just ground of complaint  against him. As far as I can see, messieurs, there is not much to  choose between you. You, Monsieur le Chevalier, desired to buy  diamonds at the price of paste. You, madame, feared you had bought  paste at the price of diamonds. You, monsieur the secretary, tried  to get the stones from an unsuspecting person for half their value.  He took you all in, that brave Colonel Caoutchouc--it was diamond  cut diamond."    
Which was true, no doubt, but by no means consoling.    
We returned to the Grand Hotel. Charles was fuming with indignation.  "This is really too much," he exclaimed. "What an audacious rascal!  But he will never again take me in, my dear Sey. I only hope he'll  try it on. I should love to catch him. I'd know him another time,  I'm sure, in spite of his disguises. It's absurd my being tricked  twice running like this. But never again while I live! Never again,  I declare to you!"    
"Jamais de la vie!" a courier in the hall close by murmured  responsive. We stood under the verandah of the Grand Hotel, in the  big glass courtyard. And I verily believe that courier was really  Colonel Clay himself in one of his disguises.    
But perhaps we were beginning to suspect him everywhere.
