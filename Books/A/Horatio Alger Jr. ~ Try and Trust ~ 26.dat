  The next morning Herbert reported himself at his new boarding  place. He  found the fare very far from first-class, while his  fellow-boarders  appeared at the table mostly in shirt-sleeves, and  were evidently  workingmen. Our hero would have preferred a greater  degree of neatness  both in the table and in the guests, but he felt  that he would be lucky,  if he should find himself able to pay his  expenses even here. He was not  to be daunted by little annoyances, but  looked for compensation in the  future. 
  He waited impatiently for the next day, when Mr. Godfrey would  return.  Upon the success of the interview with him much depended. 
  At length it came, and Herbert once more set out for the warehouse  on  Pearl Street. He entered without question, and made his way to the   counting-room. Looking through the glass door, he saw his cousin&#8212;whom   he surveyed with new interest now that he knew the relationship&#8212;and  the  bookkeeper. But, besides these, there was an elderly gentleman,  rather  stout, with a pleasant face, the expression of which reassured  him. 
  &quot;Is Mr. Godfrey in?&quot; he asked, on entering, with a look of inquiry  at  the gentleman just described. 
  &quot;That is my name. What can I do for you?&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, turning   towards him. 
  &quot;I have a letter for you, sir,&quot; said Herbert, producing it from his   pocket. 
  Mr. Godfrey held out his hand for it, and ran his eye rapidly over  its  contents. 
  &quot;So your name is Herbert Mason?&quot; he said, raising his eyes after   finishing it. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  At the mention of this name, Tom Stanton, whose curiosity had led  him to  listen to the conversation, wheeled rapidly round on his stool  and  surveyed our hero with intense curiosity. He knew that Herbert  Mason was  the name of his cousin. Could it be possible that this boy  was the  cousin whom he had never seen? A little later, and he was  convinced of  it. 
  &quot;You have just come from Ohio, I suppose?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;My friend, Mr. Carroll, writes me that you were instrumental in  saving  him from being robbed while acting as his escort to  Philadelphia.&quot; 
  &quot;It wasn't worth mentioning,&quot; said Herbert modestly. 
  Mr. Godfrey noticed his modest tone, and it pleased him&#8212;modesty  not  being an unvarying characteristic of young America. 
  &quot;My friend refers to it as an important service. I should like to  know  the particulars. Mr. Carroll is a connection of mine, and I am  naturally  interested in all that relates to him.&quot; 
  In reply Herbert gave a brief, but clear and intelligent account of  the  attempted burglary, passing over his own achievement as lightly as   possible. But it was easy to infer, even from the little he said, that   he had acted with bravery and self-possession, 
  &quot;You behaved in a very creditable manner,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey,   approvingly. &quot;Many boys would have lost their self-possession. You  have  come to New York in search of employment, Mr. Carroll writes me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't, of course, know how you were situated in Ohio,&quot; said the   merchant, &quot;but as a general rule I think boys make a mistake in  leaving  the country for the city. Here the competition for work is  sharp, and  there is a surplus of laborers in every department of  labor. Still,&quot; he  proceeded, scanning Herbert's earnest face, &quot;you  look like a boy capable  of making his way if an opportunity offers.  You have but little money,  Mr. Carroll writes.&quot; 
  &quot;I have lost nearly all I had,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;so that now I have  very  little left.&quot; 
  &quot;You have met with a loss? Tell me about it. Indeed, I should be  glad if  you would confide to me freely your situation and hopes, and  then I  shall be better able to help you.&quot; 
  &quot;I am almost ashamed to tell you how I was taken in,&quot; said our  hero. &quot;I  suppose I ought to have been more prudent.&quot; 
  He recounted the manner in which Greenleaf had robbed him. Mr.  Godfrey  listened with interest, and so did Tom Stanton, who burst into  a laugh  when the narrative was concluded. 
  &quot;What are you laughing at, Thomas?&quot; asked the merchant, rather  sharply. 
  &quot;I was thinking how neatly he was taken in,&quot; said Tom, a little  abashed. 
  &quot;I should apply a different word to it,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey. &quot;It  appears  to me the height, or rather the depth of meanness, to take  advantage of  a boy's confidence, and defraud him so scandalously. How  much money have  you left, Herbert?&quot; 
  &quot;Forty cents, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Only forty cents to begin life with in a great city!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; I have paid my board in advance for a week.&quot; 
  &quot;Where do you board?&quot; 
  &quot;In Stanton Street.&quot; 
  Tom turned up his nose at the name of this street, which he knew  was  very far from fashionable, but this demonstration our hero did not   observe. 
  &quot;What board do you pay?&quot; 
  &quot;Three dollars a week, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;A poor place, probably.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir, but I could afford no better.&quot; 
  &quot;You are sensible to accommodate yourself to circumstances. Well,  my  young friend, it appears that you can't wait long for employment.  Mr.  Carroll has asked me to do something for you, and I am disposed to   oblige him, not wholly for his sake, but partly for your own, for you   seem to me a very modest and sensible boy. Mr. Pratt, do we need  another  boy?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir, I don't think we do.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, business will be brisker by and by. I think you can find a  little  for this young man to do in the meantime. He can go to the post  office,  and I believe I have a little extra writing to be done. Pass  him a pen,  and let him give us a specimen of his handwriting.&quot; 
  Fortunately, Herbert was a handsome writer, and this went a  considerable  way in his favor. 
  &quot;Very neat,&quot; said the merchant. &quot;By the way, Herbert, I suppose, of   course, you know nothing of French?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir, I can read it pretty well.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed!&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, surprised. &quot;Then you can be of service  to  me, that is, if you know it well enough. I received, this morning,  a  letter from a silk house at Lyons, a part of which I don't quite   understand. The fact is, my French is rather poor. Do you think you   could help me translate it?&quot; 
  &quot;If you will show me the letter, I will try, sir.&quot; 
  The merchant took a letter from the table before him and handed it  to  Herbert. 
  Our hero ran his eye rapidly over it, and then rendered it into  English  in a clear and grammatical way. 
  &quot;Bless me, you're quite a scholar,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey. &quot;I understand  now.  You've made it all plain. Where did you learn so much French?&quot; 
  &quot;My father taught me, sir. He also taught me Latin.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed, I congratulate you on possessing so good an education.  Latin,  however, isn't so much in my way. I haven't many Latin  correspondents.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose not, sir,&quot; said Herbert, laughing. 
  &quot;Still, it does no harm to know something of it.&quot; 
  Tom Stanton had listened with considerable surprise, mingled with   mortification, to what had passed. It appeared then, that his country   cousin, whom he had looked upon as a country boor, was his superior in   education, and, as Tom secretly knew, in courage. And now he was going   to be his fellow-clerk. He felt jealous and angry, fearing that  Herbert,  who appeared to be high in favor already, would eclipse him  in the  office. 
  &quot;How much can you live upon economically?&quot; asked the merchant. 
  &quot;I know little of the city,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;You can judge better  than I,  sir.&quot; 
  &quot;You pay three dollars a week board. You'll need double that  amount. Mr.  Pratt, you may pay him six dollars a week. He will come to  work to-  morrow morning, and you may pay him Saturday, as if it was a  whole  week.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Herbert, gratefully. &quot;You are very kind.&quot; 
  &quot;Do your duty, my young friend, and I shall be satisfied.&quot; 
  Tom Stanton listened in indignant surprise. He only got four  dollars a  week, and here was a country boy placed over his head. He  was imprudent  enough to give expression to his feelings. 
  &quot;Won't you give me six dollars a week, also?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Why should I?&quot; 
  &quot;Don't I deserve as much as he?&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps you do. But I don't give it to Herbert because he earns  it, for  it is not likely that he will do so at present. But he has no  other  resources. You have a comfortable home, and are not obliged to  pay for  your board out of your wages.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I hope not,&quot; said Tom. 
  &quot;Therefore you do not need as much as he does. You are not entitled  to  this explanation, but I give it, nevertheless, that you may know my   motives.&quot; 
  Tom did not reply, feeling that it would be imprudent to do so, but  he  bent sullenly to his work, by no mans satisfied with the  explanation. He  began to feel a dislike for his cousin, and determined  to injure him, if  he could, in the estimation of the firm. It would  have been satisfactory  if he could have looked down upon him as an  inferior, but that was not  easy. 
  &quot;I hope the fellow won't find out the relationship between us,&quot; he  said  to himself. &quot;He'd be calling me Cousin Tom all the time, and I  don't  care about owning a cousin that lives in Stanton Street.&quot; 
  Tom need not have troubled himself. Herbert had no idea of claiming   relationship, though, as we know, he was fully aware of its existence.
