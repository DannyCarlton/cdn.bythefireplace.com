On the day of the great demonstration, when McGregor's power over the  minds and the bodies of the men of labour sent hundreds of thousands  marching and singing in the streets, there was one man who was  untouched by the song of labour expressed in the threshing of feet.  David Ormsby had in his quiet way thought things out. He expected that  the new impetus given to solidity in the ranks of labour would make  trouble for him and his kind, that it would express itself finally in  strikes and in wide-spread industrial disturbance. He was not worried.  In the end he thought that the silent patient power of money would  bring his people the victory. On that day he did not go to his office  but in the morning stayed in his own room thinking of McGregor and of  his daughter. Laura Ormsby was out of the city but Margaret was at  home. David believed he had measured accurately the power of McGregor  over her mind but occasional doubts came to him. "Well the time has  come to have it out with her," he decided. "I must reassert my  ascendency over her mind. The thing that is going on here is really a  struggle of minds. McGregor differs from other leaders of labour as I  differ from most leaders of the forces of money. He has brains. Very  well. I shall meet him on that level. Then, when I have made Margaret  think as I think, she will return to me."

When he was still a small manufacturer in the Wisconsin town David had  been in the habit of driving out in the evening with his daughter.  During the drives he had been almost a lover in his attentions to the  child and now when he thought of the forces at work within her he was  convinced that she was still a child. Early in the afternoon he had a  carriage brought to the door and drove off with her to the city. "She  will want to see the man in the height of his power. If I am right in  thinking that she is still under the influence of his personality  there will be a romantic desire for that.    
"I will give her the chance," he thought proudly. "In this struggle I  ask no quarter from him and shall not make the common mistake of  parents in such cases. She is fascinated by the figure he has made of  himself. Showy men who stand out from the crowd have that power. She  is still under his influence. Why else her constant distraction and  her want of interest in other things? Now I will be with her when the  man is most powerful, when he shows to the greatest advantage, and  then I will make my fight for her. I will point out to her another  road, the road along which the real victors in life must learn to  travel."    
Together David the quiet efficient representative of wealth and his  woman child sat in the carriage on the day of McGregor's triumph. For  the moment an impassable gulf seemed to separate them and with intense  eyes each watched the hordes of men who massed themselves about the  labour leader. At the moment McGregor seemed to have caught all men in  the sweep of his movement. Business men had closed their desks, labour  was exultant, writers and men given to speculation in thought walked  about dreaming of the realisation of the brotherhood of man. In the  long narrow treeless park the music made by the steady never-ending  thresh of feet arose to something vast and rhythmical. It was like a  mighty chorus come up out of the hearts of men. David was unmoved.  Occasionally he spoke to the horses and looked from the faces of the  men massed about him to his daughter's face. In the coarse faces of  the men he thought he saw only a crude sort of intoxication, the  result of a new kind of emotionalism. "It will not outlast thirty days  of ordinary living in their squalid surroundings," he thought grimly.  "It is not the kind of exaltation for Margaret. I can sing her a more  wonderful song. I must get myself ready for that."    
When McGregor arose to speak Margaret was overcome with emotions.  Dropping to her knees in the carriage she put her head down upon her  father's arm. For days she had been telling herself that in the future  of the man she loved there was no place for failure. Now again she  whispered to herself that this great sturdy figure must not be denied  the fulfilment of its purpose. When in the hush that followed the  massing of the labourers about him the harsh booming voice floated  over the heads of the people her body shook as with a chill.  Extravagant fancies invaded her mind and she wished it were possible  for her to do something heroic, something that would make her live  again in the mind of McGregor. She wanted to serve him, to give him  something out of herself, and thought wildly that there might yet come  a time and a way by which the beauty of her body could be laid like a  gift before him. The half mythical figure of Mary the lover of Jesus  came into her mind and she aspired to be such another. With her body  shaken with emotions she pulled at the sleeve of her father's coat.  "Listen! It is going to come now," she murmured. "The brain of labour  is going to express the dream of labour. An impulse sweet and lasting  is going to come into the world."

David Ormsby said nothing. When McGregor had begun to speak he touched  the horses with the whip and drove slowly along Van Buren Street past  the silent attentive ranks of men. When he had got into one of the  streets near the river a vast cheer arose. It seemed to shake the city  and the horses reared and leaped forward over the rough cobblestones.  With one hand David quieted them while with the other he gripped the  hand of his daughter. They drove over a bridge and into the West Side  and as they went the marching song of the workers rising up out of  thousands of throats rang in their ears. For a time the air seemed to  pulsate with it but as they went westward it grew continually less and  less distinct. At last when they had turned into a street lined by  tall factories it died out altogether. "That is the end of him for me  and mine," thought David and again set himself for the task he had to  perform.    
Through street after street David let the horses wander while he clung  to his daughter's hand and thought of what he wanted to say. Not all  of the streets were lined with factories. Some, and these in the  evening light were the most hideous, were bordered by the homes of  workers. The houses of the workers, jammed closely together and black  with grime, were filled with noisy life. Women sat in the doorways and  children ran screaming and shouting in the road. Dogs barked and  howled. Everywhere was dirt and disorder, the terrible evidence of  men's failure in the difficult and delicate art of living. In one of  the streets a little girl child who sat on the post of a fence made a  ludicrous figure. As David and Margaret drove past she beat with her  heels against the sides of the post and screamed. Tears ran down her  cheeks and her dishevelled hair was black with dirt. "I want a banana!  I want a banana!" she howled, staring at the blank walls of one of the  houses. In spite of herself Margaret was touched and her mind left the  figure of McGregor. By an odd chance the child on the post was the  daughter of that socialist orator who one night on the North Side had  climbed upon a platform to confront McGregor with the propaganda of  the Socialist Party.    
David turned the horses into a wide boulevard that ran south through  the factory district of the west. As they came out into the boulevard  they saw sitting on the sidewalk before a saloon a drunkard with a  drum in his hand. The drunkard beat upon the drum and tried to sing  the marching song of the workers but succeeded only in making a queer  grunting noise like a distressed animal. The sight brought a smile to  David's lips. "Already it has begun to disintegrate," he muttered. "I  brought you into this part of town on purpose," he said to Margaret.  "I wanted you to see with your own eyes how much the world needs the  thing he is trying to do. The man is terribly right about the need for  discipline and order. He is a big man doing a big thing and I admire  his courage. He would be a really big man had he the greater courage."    
On the boulevard into which they had turned all was quiet. The summer  sun was setting and over the roofs of buildings the west was ablaze  with light. They passed a factory surrounded by little patches of  garden. Some employer of labour had tried thus feebly to bring beauty  into the neighbourhood of the place where his men worked. David  pointed with the whip. "Life is a husk," he said, "and we men of  affairs who take ourselves so seriously because the fates have been  good to us have odd silly little fancies. See what this fellow has  been at, patching away, striving to create beauty on the shell of  things. He is like McGregor you see. I wonder if the man has made  himself beautiful, if either he or McGregor has seen to it that there  is something lovely inside the husk he wears around and that he calls  his body, if he has seen through life to the spirit of life. I do not  believe in patching nor do I believe in disturbing the shell of things  as McGregor has dared to do. I have my own beliefs and they are the  beliefs of my kind. This man here, this maker of little gardens, is  like McGregor. He might better let men find their own beauty. That is  my way. I have, I want to think, kept myself for the sweeter and more  daring effort."    
David turned and looked hard at Margaret who had begun to be  influenced by his mood. She waited, looking with averted face at the  sky over the roofs of buildings. David began to talk of himself in  relation to her and her mother. A note of impatience came into his  voice.    
"How far you have been carried away, haven't you?" he said sharply.  "Listen. I am not talking to you now as your father nor as Laura's  daughter. Let us be clear about that I love you and am in a contest to  win your love. I am McGregor's rival. I accept the handicap of  fatherhood. I love you. You see I have let something within myself  alight upon you. McGregor has not done that. He refused what you had  to offer but I do not. I have centred my life upon you and have done  it quite knowingly and after much thought. The feeling I have is  something quite special. I am an individualist but believe in the  oneness of man and woman. I would dare venture into but one other life  beyond my own and that the life of a woman. I have chosen to ask you  to let me venture so into your life. We will talk of it."    
Margaret turned and looked at her father. Later she thought that some  strange phenomena must have happened at the moment Something like a  film was torn from her eyes and she saw the man David, not as a shrewd  and calculating man of affairs, but as something magnificently young.  Not only was he strong and solid but in his face there was at the  moment the deep lines of thought and suffering she had seen on the  countenance of McGregor. "It is strange," she thought. "They are so  unlike and yet the two men are both beautiful."    
"I married your mother when I was a child as you are a child now,"  David went on. "To be sure I had a passion for her and she had one for  me. It passed but it was beautiful enough while it lasted. It did not  have depth or meaning. I want to tell you why. Then I am going to make  you understand McGregor so that you may take your measure of the man.  I am coming to that. I have to begin at the beginning.    
"My factory began to grow and as an employer of labour I became  concerned in the lives of a good many men."    
His voice again became sharp. "I have been impatient with you," he  said. "Do you think this McGregor is the only man who has seen and  thought of other men in the mass? I have done that and have been  tempted. I also might have become sentimental and destroyed myself. I  did not. Loving a woman saved me. Laura did that for me although when  it came to the real test of our love, understanding, she failed. I am  nevertheless grateful to her that she was once the object of my love.  I believe in the beauty of that."    
Again David paused and began to tell his story in a new way. The  figure of McGregor came back into Margaret's mind and her father began  to feel that to take it entirely away would be an accomplishment full  of significance. "If I can take her from him, I and my kind can take  the world from him also," he thought. "It will be another victory for  the aristocracy in the never-ending battle with the mob."    
"I came to a turning point," he said aloud. "All men come to that  point. To be sure the great mass of people drift quite stupidly but we  are not now talking of people in general. There is you and me and  there is the thing McGregor might be. We are each in our way something  special. We come, people like us, to a place where there are two roads  to take. I took one and McGregor has taken another. I know why and  perhaps he knows why. I concede to him knowledge of what he has done.  But now it is time for you to decide which road you will take. You  have seen the crowds moving along the broad way he has chosen and now  you will set out on your own way. I want you to look down my road with  me."    
They came to a bridge over a canal and David stopped the horses. A  body of McGregor's marchers passed and Margaret's pulse began to beat  high again. When she looked at her father however he was unmoved and  she was a little ashamed of her emotions. For a moment David waited,  as though for inspiration, and when the horses started on again he  began to talk. "A labour leader came to my factory, a miniature  McGregor with a crooked twist to him. He was a rascal but the things  he said to my men were all true enough. I was making money for my  investors, a lot of it. They might have won in a fight with me. One  evening I went out into the country to walk alone under the trees and  think it over."    
David's voice became harsh and Margaret thought it had become  strangely like the voice of McGregor talking to workingmen. "I bought  the man off," David said. "I used the cruel weapon men like me have to  use. I gave him money and told him to get out, to let me alone. I did  it because I had to win. My kind of men always have to win. During the  walk I took alone I got hold of my dream, my belief. I have the same  dream now. It means more to me than the welfare of a million men. For  it I would crush whatever opposed me. I am going to tell you of the  dream.    
"It is too bad one has to talk. Talk kills dreams and talk will also  kill all such men as McGregor. Now that he has begun to talk we will  get the best of him. I do not worry about McGregor. Time and talk will  bring about his destruction."    
David's mind ran off in a new direction. "I do not think a man's life  is of much importance," he said. "No man is big enough to grasp all of  life. That is the foolish fancy of children. The grown man knows he  cannot see life at one great sweep. It cannot be comprehended so. One  has to realise that he lives in a patchwork of many lives and many  impulses.    
"The man must strike at beauty. That is the realisation maturity  brings and that is where the woman conies in. That is what McGregor  was not wise enough to understand. He is a child you see in a land of  excitable children."    
The quality of David's voice changed. Putting his arm about his  daughter he drew her face down beside his own. Night descended upon  them. The woman who was tired from much thinking began to feel  grateful for the touch of the strong hand on her shoulder. David had  accomplished his purpose. He had for the moment made his daughter  forget that she was his daughter. There was something hypnotic in the  quiet strength of his mood.    
"I come now to women, to your part," he said. "We will talk of the  thing I want to make you understand. Laura failed as the woman. She  never saw the point. As I grew she did not grow with me. Because I did  not talk of love she did not understand me as a lover, did not know  what I wanted, what I demanded of her.    
"I wanted to fit my love down upon her figure as one puts a glove on  his hand. You see I was the adventurer, the man mussed and moiled by  life and its problems. The struggle to exist, to get money, could not  be avoided. I had to make that struggle. She did not. Why could she  not understand that I did not want to come into her presence to rest  or to say empty words. I wanted her to help me create beauty. We  should have been partners in that. Together we should have undertaken  the most delicate and difficult of all struggles, the struggle for  living beauty in our everyday affairs."    
Bitterness swept over the old ploughmaker and he used strong words.  "The whole point is in what I am now saying. That was my cry to the  woman. It came out of my soul. It was the only cry to another I have  ever made. Laura was a little fool. Her mind flitted away to little  things. I do not know what she wanted me to be and now I do not care.  Perhaps she wanted me to be a poet, a stringer together of words, one  to write shrill little songs about her eyes and lips. It does not  matter now what she wanted.    
"But you matter."    
David's voice cut through the fog of new thoughts that were confusing  his daughter's mind and she could feel his body stiffen. A thrill ran  through her own body and she forgot McGregor. With all the strength of  her spirit she was absorbed in what David was saying. In the challenge  that was coming from the lips of her father she began to feel there  would be born in her own life a definite purpose.    
"Women want to push out into life, to share with men the disorder and  mussiness of little things. What a desire! Let them try it if they  wish. They will sicken of the attempt. They lose sight of something  bigger they might undertake. They have forgotten the old things, Ruth  in the corn and Mary with the jar of precious ointment, they have  forgotten the beauty they were meant to help men create.    
"Let them share only in man's attempt to create beauty. That is the  big, the delicate task to which they should consecrate themselves. Why  attempt instead the cheaper, the secondary task? They are like this  McGregor."    
The ploughmaker became silent. Taking up the whip he drove the horses  rapidly along. He thought that his point was made and was satisfied to  let the imagination of his daughter do the rest. They turned off the  boulevard and passed through a street of small stores. Before a saloon  a troop of street urchins led by a drunken man without a hat gave a  grotesque imitation of McGregor's Marchers before a crowd of laughing  idlers. With a sinking heart Margaret realised that even at the height  of his power the forces that would eventually destroy the impulses  back of McGregor's Marchers were at work. She crept closer to David.  "I love you," she said. "Some day I may have a lover but always I  shall love you. I shall try to be what you want of me."    
It was past two o'clock that night when David arose from the chair  where he had been for several hours quietly reading. With a smile on  his face he went to a window facing north toward the city. All through  the evening groups of men had been passing the house. Some had gone  scuffling along, a mere disorderly mob, some had gone shoulder to  shoulder chanting the marching song of the workers and a few, under  the influence of drink, had stopped before the house to roar out  threats. Now all was quiet. David lighted a cigar and stood for a long  time looking out over the city. He was thinking of McGregor and  wondering what excited dream of power the day had brought into the  man's head. Then he thought of his daughter and of her escape. A soft  light came into his eyes. He was happy but when he had partially  undressed a new mood came and he turned out the lights in the room and  went again to the window. In the room above Margaret had been unable  to sleep and had also crept to the window. She was thinking again of  McGregor and was ashamed of her thoughts. By chance both father and  daughter began at the same moment to doubt the truth of what David had  said during the drive along the boulevard. Margaret could not express  her doubts in words but tears came into her eyes.    
As for David, he put his hand on the sill of the window and for just a  moment his body trembled as with age and weariness. "I wonder," he  muttered--"if I had youth--perhaps McGregor knew he would fail and yet  had the courage of failure, I wonder if both Margaret and myself lack  the greater courage, if that evening long ago when I walked under the  trees I made a mistake? What if after all this McGregor and his woman  knew both roads. What if they, after looking deliberately along the  road toward success in life, went without regret along the road to  failure? What if McGregor and not myself knew the road to beauty?"
