For a day or two more, Granville remained seriously ill in the  dirty hut. At the end of that time, weak and wasted as he was, he  insisted upon getting up and setting out alone on his long march  seaward.    
It was a wild resolve. He was utterly unfit for it. The hospitable  Namaqua, whose wives had nursed him well through that almost hopeless  illness, did his best to persuade the rash Englishman from so mad  a course, by gestures and entreaties, in his own mute language.  But Granville was obstinate. He would <i>not</i> sit down quietly and  be robbed like this of the fruit of his labours. He would not be  despoiled. He would not be trampled upon. He would make for the  coast, if he staggered in like a skeleton, and would confront the  robber with his own vile crime, be it at Angra Pequena, or Cape  Town, or London, or Tilgate.    
In short, he would do much as Guy himself had done when he discovered  Montague Nevitt's theft of the six thousand. He would follow the  villain till he ran him to earth, and would tax him at last to  his face with the open proofs of his consummate treachery. What's  bred in the bone will out in the blood. The Kelmscott strain worked  alike its own way in each of them.    
The Namaqua, to be sure, tried in vain to explain to Granville by  elaborate signs that the other white man had given orders to the  contrary. The other white man had strictly enjoined upon him not to  let the invalid escape from his hut on any pretext whatever. The  other white man had promised him a reward, a very large reward--money,  guns, ammunition--if he kept him safely and didn't allow him to  escape. Granville Kelmscott smiled to himself a bitter, cynical,  smile. Poor confiding savage! He didn't know Guy as well as he,  his brother, did.    
And yet, in the midst of it all, in spite of the revulsion, Granville  was conscious now and then of some little ingratitude somewhere to  his half-brother's memory. After all, Guy had shown him time and  again no small kindness. Some excuse should be made for a man who  saves his own life first in very dire extremities. But none, no,  none for one who has the incredible and inhuman meanness to rob his  own brother of his hard-earned gams, in a strange wild land, when  he thinks him dying.    
For it was the robbery, not the desertion, Granville could never  forgive. The man who was capable of doing that basest of acts was  capable also of murder or any crime in the decalogue.    
So the fevered white man rose at last one morning on his shrunken  limbs, and staggered, as best he might, from his protector's hut  in a wild impulse of resolution, on his mad journey seaward. When  the Namaqua saw nothing on earth would induce him to remain, he  shouldered his arms and went out beside him, fully equipped for  fight with matchlock and assegai. Not that the savage made any  undue pretence to a purely personal devotion to the belated white  man. On the contrary, he signified to Granville with many ingenious  signs that he was afraid of losing the great reward he had been  promised, if once he let the invalid get out of his sight unattended.    
Granville smiled once more that bitter smile of new-born cynicism.  Well, let the fellow follow him if he liked! He would reward  him himself if ever they reached the coast in safety. And in any  case, it was better to go attended by a native. An interpreter who  can communicate in their own tongue with the people through whose  territory you are going to pass is always, useful in a savage  country.    
How Granville got over that terrible journey seaward he could never  tell. He crawled on and on, supported by the faithful Namaqua with  unfailing good-humour, over that endless veldt, for three long days  of wretched footsore marching. And for three long nights he slept,  or lay awake, under the clear desert stars, on the open ground of  barren Namaqua land. It was a terrible time. Worn and weary with  the fever, Granville was wholly unfit for any kind of travelling.  Nothing but the iron constitution of the Kelmscotts could ever  have stood so severe an ordeal. But the son of six generations of  soldiers, who had commanded in the fever-stricken flats of Walcheren,  or followed Wellesley through the jungles of tropical India, or  forced their way with Napier into the depths of Abyssinia, was not  to be daunted even by the nameless horrors of that South African  desert. Granville still endured, for three days and nights, and  was ready to march, or crawl on, once more, upon the fourth morning.    
Here, however, his Namaqua, guide, with every appearance of terror,  made strong warnings of danger. The country beyond, he signified  by strange gestures, lay in the hands of a hostile tribe, hereditarily  at war with his fellow-clansmen. He didn't even know whether the  other white man, with the diamonds round his waist, had got safely  through, or whether the hostile tribe beyond the frontier had  assegaied him and "eaten him up," as the picturesque native phrase  goes. It was difficult enough for even a strong warrior to force  his way through that district with a good company of followers;  impossible for a single weak invalid like Granville, attended only  by one poor, ill-armed Namaqua.    
So the savage seemed to say in his ingenious pantomime. If they  went on, they'd be killed and eaten up resistlessly. If they stopped  they might pull through. They must wait and camp there. For what  they were to wait, Granville hadn't the faintest conception. But  the Namaqua insisted upon it, and Granville was helpless as a child  in his hands. The man was alarmed, apparently, for his promised  reward. If Granville insisted, he showed in very frank dumb show,  why--a thrust with the assegai explained the rest most persuasively.  Granville still had his revolver, to be sure, and a few rounds  of ball cartridge. But he was too weak to show fight; the savage  overmastered him.    
They were seated on a stony ridge or sharp hog's back, overlooking  the valley of a dry summer stream. The watershed on which they sat  separated, with its chine of rugged rocks, the territory of the  two rival tribes. But the Namaqua was evidently very little afraid  that the enemy might transgress the boundaries of his fellow-tribesmen.  He dared not himself go beyond the jagged crest of the ridge; but  he seemed to think it pretty certain the people of the other tribe  wouldn't, for their part, in turn come across to molest him. He sat  down there doggedly, as if expecting something or other to turn up  in the course of time; and more than once he made signs to Granville  which the Englishman interpreted to mean that after so many days  and nights from some previous event unspecified, somebody would  arrive on the track from the coast at the point of junction between  the hostile races.    
Granville was gazing at the Namaqua in the vain attempt to interpret  these signs more fully to himself, when, all of a sudden, an  unexpected noise in the valley below attracted his attention. He  pricked up his ears, Impossible! Incredible! It couldn't be--yes,  it was--the sharp hiss of firearms!    
At the very same moment the Namaqua leapt to his feet in sudden  alarm, and, shading his eyes with his dusky hand, gazed intently  in front of him. For a minute or so he stood still, with brows knit  and neck craning. Then he called out something in an excited tone  two or three times over in his own tongue to Granville. The Englishman  stared in the same direction, but could make out nothing definite  just at first, in the full glare of the sunlight. But the Namaqua,  with a cry of joy, held up his two fingers as before, to symbolize  the two white men, and pointed with one of them to his guest, while  with the other he indicated some object in the valley, nodding  many times over. Granville seized his meaning at once. Could it be  true, what he said in this strange mute language? Could relief be  at hand? Could the firing beneath show that Guy was returning?    
As he looked and strained his eyes, peering down upon the red plain,  under the shadow of his open palm, the objects by the water-course  grew gradually clearer. Granville could make out now that a party  of natives, armed with spears and matchlocks, was attacking some  little encampment on the bank of the dry torrent. The small force  in the encampment was returning the fire with great vigour and  spirit, though apparently over-powered by the superior numbers of  their swarming assailants. Even as Granville looked, their case grew  more desperate. A whole horde of black men seemed to be making an  onset on some small white object, most jealously guarded, round  which the defenders of the camp rallied with infinite energy. At the  head of the little band of strangers, a European in a pith helmet  was directing the fire, and fighting hard himself for the precious  white object. The rest were blacks, he thought, in half-civilized  costume. Granville's heart gave a bound as the leader sprang forth  upon one approaching savage. His action, as he leapt, stamped the  man at once. There was Kelmscott in the leap. Granville knew in a  second it was indeed Guy Waring.    
The Namaqua recognised him too, and pointed enthusiastically  forward. Granville saw what he meant. To the front! To the front!  If there was fighting to be done, let them help their friends. Let  them go forward and claim the great reward offered.    
Next moment, with a painful thrill of shame and remorse,  the Englishman saw what was the nature of the object they were so  jealously guarding. His heart stood still within him. It was a sort  of sedan chair, or invalid litter, borne on poles by four native  porters. Talk about coals of fire! Granville Kelmscott hardly knew  how to forgive himself for his unworthy distrust. Then Guy must  have reached the coast in safety, after leaving him in charge of  the Namaqua and fighting his way through, and now he was on his  way back to the interior again, with a sufficient escort and a  palanquin to fetch him.    
Even as he looked, the assailants closed in more fiercely than  ever on the faltering little band. One of them thrust out with an  assegai at Guy. In an agony of horror, Granville cried aloud where  he stood. Surely, surely, they must be crushed to earth. No arms of  precision could ever avail them against such a swarm of assailants,  poured forth over their camp as if from some human ant-hill.    
"Let us run!" the sick man cried to the Namaqua, pointing to the  fight below; and the Namaqua, comprehending the gesture, if not the  words, set forward to run with him down the slope into the valley.    
At about a hundred yards off from the crowd, Granville, crouched  behind a clump of thorny acacia, and, signalling to the Namaqua to  hide at the same time, drew his revolver and fired point-blank at  the hindmost natives.    
The effect was electrical. In a moment the savages turned and gazed  around them astonished. One of their number was hit and wounded  in the leg. Granville had aimed so purposely, to maim and terrify  them. The natives faltered and fell back. As they did so, Granville  emerged from the shelter of the acacia bush, and fired a second  shot from another point at them. At the same instant the Namaqua  raised a loud native battle-cry, and brandished his assegai. The  effect was electrical. The hostile tribe broke up in wild panic at  once. They cried in their own tongue that the Namaquas were down  upon them, under English guidance: and, quick as lightning, they  dispersed as if by magic, to hide themselves about in the thick  bush jungle.    
Two seconds later, Guy was wringing Granville's hand in a fervour  of gratitude. Each man had saved the other's life. In the rapid  interchange of question and answer that followed, one point alone  puzzled them both for a minute or two.    
"But why on earth didn't you leave a line to explain what you'd  done?" Granville cried, now thoroughly ashamed of his unbelief, "If  only I'd known, you were coming back to the village it would have  saved me so much distress, so much sleepless misery."    
"Why, so I did," Guy answered, still thoroughly out of breath, and  stained with blood and powder. "I tore a leaf from my note-book and  gave it to the Namaqua, explaining to him by signs that he was to  let you have it at once, the moment you were conscious. Here, you,  sir," he went on, turning round to their faithful black ally, and  holding up the note-book before his eyes to refresh his memory,  "why didn't you give it to the gentleman as I told you?"    
The Namaqua, catching hastily at the meaning from the mere tone  of the question, as well as from Guy's instinctive and graphic  imitation of the act of writing, pulled out from his waistband the  last relics of a very brown and tattered fragment of paper, on which  were still legible in pencil the half-obliterated words: "My dear  Granville,--I find there is no chance of conveying you to the coast  through the territory of the next tribe in your present condition,  unless---"    
The rest was torn off. Guy looked at it dubiously. But the Namaqua,  anxious to show he had followed out all instructions to the very  letter, tore off the next scrap before their eyes, rolled it up  between his palms into a nice greasy pill, and proceeded to offer  it for Granville's acceptance. The misapprehension was too absurd.  Guy went off into a hearty peal of laughter at once. The Namaqua  had taken the mysterious signs for "a very great medicine," and  had administered the magical paper accordingly, as he understood  himself to be instructed, at fixed intervals to his unfortunate  patient. That was the medicine Granville remembered having forced  down his throat at the moment when he first learned, as he thought,  his half-brother's treachery.
