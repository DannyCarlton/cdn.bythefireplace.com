"If you have this war," said Lady Mary Montgomery to Betty, who had  come to receive with her on one of her Tuesdays, "it will be strictly  constitutional if you look at it in the right way. This is a  government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and as  the people are practically a unit in their howl for war, they have a  right to it, and the responsibility is on their shoulders, not on your  few statesmen."    
"That is a real gem of feminine logic, but not only is one wise man of  more account than ten thousand fools, but a unit is a unit and has no  comparative state. The serious men from one end of the country to the  other are doing all they can to quell the excitement; so are the few  decent newspapers that we possess. But they are dealing with a mob; an  excited mob is always mad, and in this case the keepers are not  numerous enough for the lunatics. But no one will question that the  intelligent keepers are right and the mob wrong. The average  intelligence is always shallow, and in electric climates very  excitable. We are dealing to-day no less with a huge mob, even if it  is not massed and marching, than were the few sane men of the French  Revolution. An exciting idea is like a venomous microbe; it bites into  the brain, and if circumstances do not occur to expel it, it produces  a form of mania. That is the only way I can account for Burleigh's  attitude; he is one of the few exceptions. There are thousands of men  in the United States whose brains could stand any strain, but there  are hundreds of thousands who were born to swell a mob. As for  'government by the people,' that phrase should be translated to-day  into 'tyranny of the people.' England under a constitutional monarchy  is far freer than we are."    
"Well, I am suppressed and will say no more. I suppose I shall have a  mob to-day. If anything, people are paying more calls than ever, for  they can't stay indoors for twenty-five minutes with no one to talk  to. It is getting monotonous. I wish that the President and the Senate  would begin to play, but they look as impassive as the statues in the  parks."    
The rooms filled quickly. By five o'clock the usual crowd was there,  and if it had its dowdy battalion as ever, there was no evidence that  the more fortunate had lost their interest in dress, despite the  warlike state of their nerves. Not that all were for war, by any  means. Many were clinging to a forlorn hope, but they could talk of  nothing else.    
Betty had just listened to the twenty-eighth theory of the cause of  the Maine's destruction when she turned in response to a familiar  drawl.    
"Why, howdy, Miss Madison, I'm real glad to run across you at last."    
Betty was so taken aback that she mechanically surrendered her hand to  the limp pressure of her former housekeeper. But she was not long  recovering herself.    
"Miss Trumbull, is it not? I was not aware that you were an  acquaintance of Lady Mary Montgomery's."    
"Well, I can't say as I know her real intimate yet, but I guess I  shall in time, as we're both wives of Congressmen."    
"Ah? You are married?" Betty experienced a fleeting desire to see the  man who had been captivated by Miss Trumbull.    
"Ye--as. I went out West to visit my sister after I left you and was  married before I knew it--to Mr. George Washington Mudd. He's real  nice, and smart--My! I expect to be in the White House before I die."    
"It is among the possibilities, of course. I hope you are happy, and  that meanwhile he is able to take care of you comfortably." Mrs. Mudd  glistened with black silk and jet, but the cut of her gown was of the  Middle West.    
"Well, I guess! He's a lawyer and can make two hundred dollars a month  any day. Of course I can't set up a house in Washington, but I live at  the Ellsmere, and three or four of us Congressional ladies receive  together and share carriages. I'll be happy to have you call--the  first and third Tuesdays; but we always put it in the Post."    
"I have little time for calling. I am very busy in many ways."    
"Well, I'm sorry. You don't look as well as you did up in the  mountains; you look real tired, come to examine you. But your dresses  are always so swell one sees those first. I always did think you had  just the prettiest dresses I ever saw."    
Betty did not turn her back upon the woman; it was a relief to talk on  any subject that stood aloof from war. Mrs. Mudd rambled on.    
"I suppose you're engaged to Senator Burleigh by this time? He's our  Senator, you know, but I don't know as he's likely to be, long. We  want silver, and I guess we've got to have it."    
"I suppose you take quite an interest in politics now," said Betty,  looking at the woman's large self-satisfied face. So far, matrimony  had not been a chastening influence. Mrs. Mudd looked more conceited  than ever.    
"Well, I guess I always knew as much about them as anybody; and now  I'm in politics, I guess the President couldn't give me many points.  If he don't declare war soon, I'll go up to the White House and tell  him what I think of him."    
"Suppose you make a speech from the House Gallery. It is Congress that  declares war, not the President."    
Mrs. Mudd's face turned the dull red which Betty well remembered. "I  guess I know what I'm talking' about. It's the President--"    
But Betty's back was upon her, and Betty was listening to the agitated  comments of one of the year's debutantes upon the destruction of the  Maine.    
"Was night ever so welcome before?" thought Betty, as she settled  herself between the four posts of her great-aunt's bed, a few hours  later. "Here, at least, not an echo of war can penetrate, and if I  think of other things that scald my pillow, it is almost a relief."
