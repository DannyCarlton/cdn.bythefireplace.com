When she returned, Robert Monteith sat asleep over his paper in  his easy-chair. It was his wont at night when he returned from  business. Frida cast one contemptuous glance as she passed at his  burly, unintelligent form, and went up to her bedroom.    
But all that night long she never slept. Her head was too full of  Bertram Ingledew.    
Yet, strange to say, she felt not one qualm of conscience for their  stolen meeting. No feminine terror, no fluttering fear, disturbed  her equanimity. It almost seemed to her as if Bertram's kiss had  released her by magic, at once and for ever, from the taboos of her  nation. She had slipped out from home unperceived, that night, in  fear and trembling, with many sinkings of heart and dire misgivings,  while Robert and Phil were downstairs in the smoking-room; she had  slunk round, crouching low, to Miss Blake's lodgings: and she had  terrified her soul on the way with a good woman's doubts and a good  woman's fears as to the wrongfulness of her attempt to say good-bye  to the friend she might now no longer mix with. But from the moment  her lips and Bertram's touched, all fear and doubt seemed utterly to  have vanished; she lay there all night in a fierce ecstasy of love,  hugging herself for strange delight, thinking only of Bertram, and  wondering what manner of thing was this promised freedom whereof her  lover had spoken to her so confidently. She trusted him now; she  knew he would do right, and right alone: whatever he advised, she  would be safe in following.    
Next day, Robert went up to town to business as usual. He was  immersed in palm-oil. By a quarter to two, Frida found herself in  the fields. But, early as she went to fulfil her tryst, Bertram was  there before her. He took her hand in his with a gentle pressure,  and Frida felt a quick thrill she had never before experienced  course suddenly through her. She looked around to right and left,  to see if they were observed. Bertram noticed the instinctive  movement. "My darling," he said in a low voice, "this is  intolerable, unendurable. It's an insult not to be borne that you  and I can't walk together in the fields of England without being  subjected thus to such a many-headed espionage. I shall have to  arrange something before long so as to see you at leisure. I can't  be so bound by all the taboos of your country."    
She looked up at him trustfully. "As you will, Bertram," she  answered, without a moment's hesitation. "I know I'm yours now.  Let it be what it may, I can do what you tell me."    
He looked at her and smiled. He saw she was pure woman. He had  met at last with a sister soul. There was a long, deep silence.    
Frida was the first to break it with words. "Why do you always  call them taboos, Bertram?" she asked at last, sighing.    
"Why, Frida, don't you see?" he said, walking on through the deep  grass. "Because they <i>are</i> taboos; that's the only reason. Why not  give them their true name? We call them nothing else among my own  people. All taboos are the same in origin and spirit, whether  savage or civilised, eastern or western. You must see that now: for  I know you are emancipated. They begin with belief in some fetich  or bogey or other non-existent supernatural being; and they mostly  go on to regard certain absolutely harmless--nay, sometimes even  praiseworthy or morally obligatory--acts as proscribed by him and  sure to be visited with his condign displeasure. So South Sea  Islanders think, if they eat some particular luscious fruit tabooed  for the chiefs, they'll be instantly struck dead by the mere power  of the taboo in it; and English people think, if they go out in the  country for a picnic on a tabooed day, or use certain harmless  tabooed names and words, or inquire into the historical validity of  certain incredible ancient documents, accounted sacred, or even  dare to think certain things that no reasonable man can prevent  himself from thinking, they'll be burned for ever in eternal fire  for it. The common element is the dread of an unreal sanction. So  in Japan and West Africa the people believe the whole existence of  the world and the universe is bound up with the health of their own  particular king or the safety of their own particular royal family;  and therefore they won't allow their Mikado or their chief to go  outside his palace, lest he should knock his royal foot against a  stone, and so prevent the sun from shining and the rain from  falling. In other places, it's a tree or a shrub with which the  stability and persistence of the world is bound up; whenever that  tree or shrub begins to droop or wither, the whole population  rushes out in bodily fear and awe, bearing water to pour upon it,  and crying aloud with wild cries as if their lives were in danger.  If any man were to injure the tree, which of course is no more  valuable than any other bush of its sort, they'd tear him to pieces  on the spot, and kill or torture every member of his family. And so  too, in England, most people believe, without a shadow of reason,  that if men and women were allowed to manage their own personal  relations, free from tribal interference, all life and order would  go to rack and ruin; the world would become one vast, horrible  orgy; and society would dissolve in some incredible fashion. To  prevent this imaginary and impossible result, they insist upon  regulating one another's lives from outside with the strictest  taboos, like those which hem round the West African kings, and  punish with cruel and relentless heartlessness every man, and still  more every woman, who dares to transgress them."    
"I think I see what you mean," Frida answered, blushing.    
"And I mean it in the very simplest and most literal sense,"  Bertram went on quite seriously. "I'd been among you some time  before it began to dawn on me that you English didn't regard your  own taboos as essentially identical with other people's. To me,  from the very first, they seemed absolutely the same as the similar  taboos of Central Africans and South Sea Islanders. All of them  spring alike from a common origin, the queer savage belief that  various harmless or actually beneficial things may become at times  in some mysterious way harmful and dangerous. The essence of them  all lies in the erroneous idea that if certain contingencies occur,  such as breaking an image or deserting a faith, some terrible evil  will follow to one man or to the world, which evil, as a matter of  fact, there's no reason at all to dread in any way. Sometimes, as  in ancient Rome, Egypt, Central Africa, and England, the whole of  life gets enveloped at last in a perfect mist and labyrinth of  taboos, a cobweb of conventions. The Flamen Dialis at Rome, you  know, mightn't ride or even touch a horse; he mightn't see an army  under arms; nor wear a ring that wasn't broken; nor have a knot in  any part of his clothing. He mightn't eat wheaten flour or leavened  bread; he mightn't look at or even mention by name such unlucky  things as a goat, a dog, raw meat, haricot beans, or common ivy.  He mightn't walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed  with mud; his hair could only be cut by a free man, and with a  bronze knife; he was encased and surrounded, as it were, by endless  petty restrictions and regulations and taboos--just like those that  now surround so many men, and especially so many young women, here  in England."    
"And you think they arise from the same causes?" Frida said, half-  hesitating: for she hardly knew whether it was not wicked to say  so.    
"Why, of course they do," Bertram answered confidently. "That's not  matter of opinion now; it's matter of demonstration. The worst of  them all in their present complicated state are the ones that  concern marriage and the other hideous sex-taboos. They seem to  have been among the earliest human abuses; for marriage arises from  the stone-age practice of felling a woman of another tribe with a  blow of one's club, and dragging her off by the hair of her head to  one's own cave as a slave and drudge; and they are still the most  persistent and cruel of any--so much so, that your own people, as  you know, taboo even the fair and free discussion of this the most  important and serious question of life and morals. They make it, as  we would say at home, a refuge for enforced ignorance. For it's  well known that early tribes hold the most superstitious ideas  about the relation of men to women, and dread the most ridiculous  and impossible evils resulting from it; and these absurd terrors of  theirs seem to have been handed on intact to civilised races, so  that for fear of I know not what ridiculous bogey of their own  imaginations, or dread of some unnatural restraining deity, men  won't even discuss a matter of so much importance to them all, but,  rather than let the taboo of silence be broken, will allow such  horrible things to take place in their midst as I have seen with my  eyes for these last six or seven weeks in your cities. O Frida, you  can't imagine what things--for I know they hide them from you:  cruelties of lust and neglect and shame such as you couldn't even  dream of; women dying of foul disease, in want and dirt deliberately  forced upon them by the will of your society; destined beforehand  for death, a hateful lingering death--a death more disgusting than  aught you can conceive--in order that the rest of you may be safely  tabooed, each a maid intact, for the man who weds her. It's the  hatefullest taboo of all the hateful taboos I've ever seen on my  wanderings, the unworthiest of a pure or moral community."    
He shut his eyes as if to forget the horrors of which he spoke.  They were fresh and real to him. Frida did not like to question him  further. She knew to what he referred, and in a dim, vague way (for  she was less wise than he, she knew) she thought she could imagine  why he found it all so terrible.    
They walked on in silence a while through the deep, lush grass of  the July meadow. At last Bertram spoke again: "Frida," he said,  with a trembling quiver, "I didn't sleep last night. I was thinking  this thing over--this question of our relations."    
"Nor did I," Frida answered, thrilling through, responsive. "I was  thinking the same thing. . . . And, Bertram, 'twas the happiest  night I ever remember."    
Bertram's face flushed rosy red, that native colour of triumphant  love; but he answered nothing. He only looked at her with a look  more eloquent by far than a thousand speeches.    
"Frida," he went on at last, "I've been thinking it all over; and  I feel, if only you can come away with me for just seven days, I  could arrange at the end of that time--to take you home with me."    
Frida's face in turn waxed rosy red; but she answered only in a  very low voice: "Thank you, Bertram."    
"Would you go with me?" Bertram cried, his face aglow with  pleasure. "You know, it's a very, very long way off; and I can't  even tell you where it is or how you get there. But can you trust  me enough to try? Are you not afraid to come with me?"    
Frida's voice trembled slightly.    
"I'm not afraid, if that's all," she answered in a very firm tone.  "I love you, and I trust you, and I could follow you to the world's  end--or, if needful, out of it. But there's one other question.  Bertram, ought I to?"    
She asked it, more to see what answer Bertram would make to her  than from any real doubt; for ever since that kiss last night, she  felt sure in her own mind with a woman's certainty whatever Bertram  told her was the thing she ought to do; but she wanted to know in  what light he regarded it.    
Bertram gazed at her hard.    
"Why, Frida," he said, "it's right, of course, to go. The thing  that's <i>wrong</i> is to stop with that man one minute longer than's  absolutely necessary. You don't love him--you never loved him; or,  if you ever did, you've long since ceased to do so. Well, then,  it's a dishonour to yourself to spend one more day with him. How  can you submit to the hateful endearments of a man you don't love  or care for? How wrong to yourself, how infinitely more wrong to  your still unborn and unbegotten children! Would you consent to  become the mother of sons and daughters by a man whose whole  character is utterly repugnant to you? Nature has given us this  divine instinct of love within, to tell us with what persons we  should spontaneously unite: will you fly in her face and unite with  a man whom you feel and know to be wholly unworthy of you? With us,  such conduct would be considered disgraceful. We think every man  and woman should be free to do as they will with their own persons;  for that is the very basis and foundation of personal liberty. But  if any man or woman were openly to confess they yielded their  persons to another for any other reason than because the strongest  sympathy and love compelled them, we should silently despise them.  If you don't love Monteith, it's your duty to him, and still more  your duty to yourself and your unborn children, at once to leave  him; if you <i>do</i> love me, it's your duty to me, and still more your  duty to yourself and our unborn children, at once to cleave to me.  Don't let any sophisms of taboo-mongers come in to obscure that  plain natural duty. Do right first; let all else go. For one of  yourselves, a poet of your own, has said truly:    
'Because right is right, to follow right  Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'"    
Frida looked up at him with admiration in her big black eyes. She  had found the truth, and the truth had made her free.    
"O Bertram," she cried with a tremor, "it's good to be like you. I  felt from the very first how infinitely you differed from the men  about me. You seemed so much greater and higher and nobler. How  grateful I ought to be to Robert Monteith for having spoken to me  yesterday and forbidden me to see you! for if he hadn't, you might  never have kissed me last night, and then I might never have seen  things as I see them at present."    
There was another long pause; for the best things we each say to  the other are said in the pauses. Then Frida relapsed once more  into speech: "But what about the children?" she asked rather  timidly.    
Bertram looked puzzled. "Why, what about the children?" he repeated  in a curious way. "What difference on earth could that make to the  children?"    
"Can I bring them with me, I mean?" Frida asked, a little tremulous  for the reply. "I couldn't bear to leave them. Even for you, dear  Bertram, I could never desert them."    
Bertram gazed at her dismayed. "Leave them!" he cried. "Why, Frida,  of course you could never leave them. Do you mean to say anybody  would be so utterly unnatural, even in England, as to separate a  mother from her own children?"    
"I don't think Robert would let me keep them," Frida faltered, with  tears in her eyes; "and if he didn't, the law, of course, would  take his side against me."    
"Of course!" Bertram answered, with grim sarcasm in his face, "of  course! I might have guessed it. If there <i>is</i> an injustice or a  barbarity possible, I might have been sure the law of England would  make haste to perpetrate it. But you needn't fear, Frida. Long  before the law of England could be put in motion, I'll have  completed my arrangements for taking you--and them too--with me.  There are advantages sometimes even in the barbaric delay of what  your lawyers are facetiously pleased to call justice."    
"Then I may bring them with me?" Frida cried, flushing red.    
Bertram nodded assent. "Yes," he said, with grave gentleness. "You  may bring them with you. And as soon as you like, too. Remember,  dearest, every night you pass under that creature's roof, you  commit the vilest crime a woman can commit against her own purity."
