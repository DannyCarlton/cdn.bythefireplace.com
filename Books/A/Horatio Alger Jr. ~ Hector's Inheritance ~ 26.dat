    Mr. Crabb and Hector were sitting side by side in a railroad car,   speeding away from Smith Institute. In the heart of each was a   feeling of relief, which increased as each minute carried them   farther away from the school. 
  &quot;Hector,&quot; said the usher, looking younger and happier than his  pupil  had ever known him, &quot;I feel like a free man now. It is a feeling   that I have not had since I first set foot in Smith Institute.&quot; 
  &quot;I think you will lead a happier life in New York, Mr. Crabb.&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure of it. Thanks to your considerate kindness, I shall for   the first time earn an ample salary, and even be able to lay up   money. Is my future pupil about your age?&quot; 
  &quot;He is a year younger.&quot; 
  &quot;Where did you make his acquaintance?&quot; 
  &quot;At Saratoga, My father and I spent two months at Congress Hall two   summers ago, and as Walter's family were also there, we naturally  got  to be friends. He is a capital fellow, and you will be sure to  like  him.&quot; 
  &quot;I am ready to like him after reading that letter he wrote you. Is   he fond of study?&quot; 
  &quot;That is his weak point,&quot; said Hector, laughing. &quot;Walter was never   cut out for a scholar. I don't mean, of course, that he hasn't fair   capacity, but his taste doesn't lie that way. However, he won't give   you any trouble, only you won't succeed as well as you may wish in   pushing him on.&quot; 
  &quot;All boys are not cut out for scholars,&quot; said the usher. &quot;Now you,   Hector, would do excellently, and might hope to make a very   successful professional man.&quot; 
  Hector shook his head. 
  &quot;I must look to a different career,&quot; he said. &quot;I am to be the   architect of my own fortune, you know.&quot; 
  &quot;What are your plans, Hector?&quot; asked the usher. 
  &quot;I will consult with Mr. Boss, Walter's father. By the way, he  knows  nothing of the change in my circumstances. He supposes me to be  the  heir to the Roscoe estate.&quot; 
  &quot;Trouble has come upon you early, Hector. Should you need help   hereafter, you must remember that I am earning a good salary and&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Crabb,&quot; gratefully, &quot;but you will need all you  earn.  I don't look upon my loss of fortune as a trouble. I think it  will  make me more manly and self-reliant, and stimulate me to  exertion. I  have a fair education, and I am sure I can earn my living  in some  honest way.&quot; 
  &quot;If that is your spirit, Hector, I am sure you will succeed. You  are  young and hopeful. I am too much inclined to despond. I have  always  been timid about the future. It is a matter of temperament.&quot; 
  It was early in the afternoon when they reached New York. As they   emerged from the depot a bright-faced boy came up eagerly and  greeted  them. 
  &quot;How are you, Hector?&quot; he said. &quot;You see, I came to meet you. I  have  been longing to have you come.&quot; 
  &quot;I am just as glad to see you, Walter,&quot; said Hector, heartily. &quot;Mr.   Crabb, here is your future pupil, Walter Boss.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope we may soon be friends, Walter,&quot; said the usher, attracted   by the bright, sunny face of the boy. 
  Walter gave the usher his hand. 
  &quot;I hope so, too,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;I'll try not to worry you any   more than I can help.&quot; 
  &quot;I have no misgivings,&quot; said Mr. Crabb, as he mentally contrasted   his new pupil with Jim Smith, and two or three others at the   institute, who had been a frequent source of trouble and annoyance. 
  &quot;Here is the carriage,&quot; said Walter, pointing out a plain but   handsome carriage waiting outside. &quot;Bundle in, both of you! I beg   your pardon, Mr. Crabb, for my familiarity. That was intended for   Hector.&quot; 
  &quot;I am ready to be classed with Hector,&quot; said Mr. Crabb. 
  &quot;I am glad to hear you say so. I was afraid you would be stiff and   dignified.&quot; 
  &quot;I think I shall take my cue from you.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, my rule is, go as you please. Edward, drive home!&quot; 
  The house occupied by Mr. Boss was a fine brown-stone dwelling on   Forty-second Street. Arrived there, Mr. Crabb was shown into a   spacious chamber, on the third floor, furnished with a luxury to   which the poor usher was quite unaccustomed. 
  &quot;Now, Hector, you can have a room to yourself, or you may share my   den,&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;I would rather share the den,&quot; said Hector. 
  &quot;That's what I hoped. You see, we shall have ever so much to say to   each other. We haven't seen each other for over a year.&quot; 
  A slight shade of gravity overspread Hector's face. Since he had  met  his friend, his father had died, and he had been reduced from the   heir of wealth to a penniless orphan. Of this last change Walter  knew  nothing, but Hector did not mean long to leave him in  ignorance. 
  At dinner the two newcomers saw Mr. Ross, from whom they received a   friendly welcome. The usher was put at his ease at once. 
  &quot;I hope you'll get along with my boy,&quot; said the bluff city  merchant.  &quot;Of one thing you may be assured, your scholarship won't be  severely  taxed in educating him. Walter is a pretty good boy, but he  isn't a  prodigy of learning.&quot; 
  &quot;I may be some day, father,&quot; said Walter, &quot;with Mr. Crabb's help.&quot; 
  &quot;I take it Mr. Crabb isn't able to perform miracles,&quot; said Mr.  Ross,  good-humoredly. &quot;No, Mr. Crabb, I shan't expect too much of you.  Get  your pupil on moderately fast, and I shall be satisfied. I am  glad,  Hector, that you were able to pay Walter a visit at this time.&quot; 
  &quot;So am I, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;I thought you might not be able to leave your studies.&quot; 
  &quot;I have given up study, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;I am surprised at that, Hector. I thought you contemplated going  to  college.&quot; 
  &quot;So I did, sir, but circumstances have changed my plans.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; I will explain after dinner, and will ask your advice.&quot; 
  Mr. Ross dropped the subject, and after dinner led the way to the   library, where he sank into an armchair, and, breathing a sigh of   satisfaction, said: &quot;This, Mr. Crabb, is the most enjoyable part of   the twenty-four hours for me. I dismiss business cares and   perplexities, and read my evening paper, or some new book, in   comfort.&quot; 
  As the usher looked about him and saw costly books, engravings,   furniture and pictures, he could well understand that in such   surroundings the merchant could take solid comfort. It was a most   agreeable contrast to the plain and poverty-stricken room at Smith   Institute, where the boys pursued their evening studies under his   superintendence. 
  &quot;Well, Hector, so you don't propose to go back to school,&quot; said the   merchant. &quot;Isn't that rather a sudden resolution?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir; but, as I said, circumstances have changed.&quot; 
  &quot;What circumstances? Because you are rich, you don't think you  ought  to be idle, I hope?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, no, sir. It is because I have discovered that I am not rich.&quot; 
  &quot;Not rich! I always understood that your father left a large   estate,&quot; said Mr. Ross, in surprise. 
  &quot;So he did, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Didn't it descend to you?&quot; 
  &quot;I thought so till recently.&quot; 
  &quot;Why don't you think so now?&quot; 
  In answer, Hector told the story of the revelation made to him by   Allan Roscoe, after his father's death. 
  &quot;You see, therefore,&quot; he concluded, &quot;that I am penniless, and a   dependent upon Mr. Allan Roscoe's generosity.&quot; 
  &quot;This is a most extraordinary story!&quot; said the merchant, after a   pause. 
  &quot;Yes, sir; it changes my whole future.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose Mr. Allan Roscoe is the beneficiary, and the estate goes   to him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Did your father&#8212;the late Mr. Roscoe&#8212;ever hint to you anything   which could lead you to suspect that you were not his own, but an   adopted son?&quot; 
  &quot;Never, Mr. Ross,&quot; answered Hector, with emphasis. 
  &quot;Did he continue to treat you with affection.&quot; 
  &quot;Always. Nothing in his manner ever would have led me to imagine   that I was not his own son.&quot; 
  &quot;He left no will?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;What are your plans?&quot; 
  &quot;I do not wish to remain dependent upon Allan Roscoe. I should like   to obtain a situation of some kind in the city, if I can.&quot; 
  &quot;I can probably serve you, then, after a while. For the present,   stay here as Walter's companion.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir; I should like nothing better.&quot;
