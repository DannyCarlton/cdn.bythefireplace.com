  For a Space they stood apart, and in the radiant loveliness of Mary  Standish's face and in Alan's quiet and unimpassioned attitude were  neither shame nor regret. In a moment they had swept aside the barrier  which convention had raised against them, and now they felt the  inevitable thrill of joy and triumph, and not the humiliating  embarrassment of dishonor. They made no effort to draw a curtain upon  their happiness, or to hide the swift heart-beat of it from each other.  It had happened, and they were glad. Yet they stood apart, and  something pressed upon Alan the inviolableness of the little freedom of  space between them, of its sacredness to Mary Standish, and darker and  deeper grew the glory of pride and faith that lay with the love in her  eyes when he did not cross it. He reached out his hand, and freely she  gave him her own. Lips blushing with his kisses trembled in a smile,  and she bowed her head a little, so that he was looking at her smooth  hair, soft and sweet where he had caressed it a few moments before.
  &#8220;I thank God!&#8221; he said.
  He did not finish the surge of gratitude that was in his heart.  Speech seemed trivial, even futile. But she understood. He was not  thanking God for that moment, but for a lifetime of something that at  last had come to him. This, it seemed to him, was the end, the end of a  world as he had known it, the beginning of a new. He stepped back, and  his hands trembled. For something to do he set up the overturned table,  and Mary Standish watched him with a quiet, satisfied wonder. She loved  him, and she had come into his arms. She had given him her lips to  kiss. And he laughed softly as he came to her side again, and looked  over the tundra where Rossland had gone.
  &#8220;How long before you can prepare for the journey?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;You mean&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;That we must start tonight or in the morning. I think we shall go  through the cottonwoods over the old trail to Nome. Unless Rossland  lied, Graham is somewhere out there on the Tanana trail.&#8221;
  Her hand pressed his arm. &#8220;We are going&#8212;<I>back?</I> Is that it,  Alan?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, to Seattle. It is the one thing to do. You are not afraid?&#8221;
  &#8220;With you there&#8212;no.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you will return with me&#8212;when it is over?&#8221;
  He was looking steadily ahead over the tundra. But he felt her cheek  touch his shoulder, lightly as a feather.
  &#8220;Yes, I will come back with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you will be ready?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am ready now.&#8221;
  The sun-fire of the plains danced in his eyes; a cob-web of golden  mist rising out of the earth, beckoning wraiths and undulating  visions&#8212;the breath of life, of warmth, of growing things&#8212;all between  him and the hidden cottonwoods; a joyous sea into which he wanted to  plunge without another minute of waiting, as he felt the gentle touch  of her cheek against his shoulder, and the weight of her hand on his  arm. That she had come to him utterly was in the low surrender of her  voice. She had ceased to fight&#8212;she had given to him the precious right  to fight for her.
  It was this sense of her need and of her glorious faith in him, and  of the obligation pressing with it that drove slowly back into him the  grimmer realities of the day. Its horror surged upon him again, and the  significance of what Rossland had said seemed fresher, clearer, even  more terrible now that he was gone. Unconsciously the old lines of  hatred crept into his face again as he looked steadily in the direction  which the other man had taken, and he wondered how much of that same  horror&#8212;of the unbelievable menace stealing upon her&#8212;Rossland had  divulged to the girl who stood so quietly now at his side. Had he done  right to let him go? Should he not have killed him, as he would have  exterminated a serpent? For Rossland had exulted; he was of Graham's  flesh and desires, a part of his foul soul, a defiler of womanhood and  the one who had bargained to make possible the opportunity for an  indescribable crime. It was not too late. He could still overtake him,  out there in the hollows of the tundra&#8212;
  The pressure on his arm tightened. He looked down. Mary Standish had  seen what was in his face, and there was something in her calmness that  brought him to himself. He knew, in that moment, that Rossland had told  her a great deal. Yet she was not afraid, unless it was fear of what  had been in his mind.
  &#8220;I am ready,&#8221; she reminded him.
  &#8220;We must wait for Stampede,&#8221; he said, reason returning to him. &#8220;He  should be here sometime tonight, or in the morning. Now that Rossland  is off my nerves, I can see how necessary it is to have someone like  Stampede between us and&#8212;&#8221;
  He did not finish, but what he had intended to say was quite clear  to her. She stood in the doorway, and he felt an almost uncontrollable  desire to take her in his arms again.
  &#8220;He is between here and Tanana,&#8221; she said with a little gesture of  her head.
  &#8220;Rossland told you that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. And there are others with him, so many that he was amused when  I told him you would not let them take me away.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you were not afraid that I&#8212;I might let them have you?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have always been sure of what you would do since I opened that  second letter at Ellen McCormick's, Alan!&#8221;
  He caught the flash of her eyes, the gladness in them, and she was  gone before he could find another word to say. Keok and Nawadlook were  approaching hesitatingly, but now they hurried to meet her, Keok still  grimly clutching the long knife; and beyond them, at the little window  under the roof, he saw the ghostly face of old Sokwenna, like a  death's-head on guard. His blood ran a little faster. The emptiness of  the tundras, the illimitable spaces without sign of human life, the  vast stage waiting for its impending drama, with its sunshine, its song  of birds, its whisper and breath of growing flowers, struck a new note  in him, and he looked again at the little window where Sokwenna sat  like a spirit from another world, warning him in his silent and  lifeless stare of something menacing and deadly creeping upon them out  of that space which seemed so free of all evil. He beckoned to him and  then entered his cabin, waiting while Sokwenna crawled down from his  post and came hobbling over the open, a crooked figure, bent like a  baboon, witch-like in his great age, yet with sunken eyes that gleamed  like little points of flame, and a quickness of movement that made Alan  shiver as he watched him through the window.
  In a moment the old man entered. He was mumbling. He was saying, in  that jumble of sound which it was difficult for even Alan to  understand&#8212;and which Sokwenna had never given up for the missionaries'  teachings&#8212;that he could hear feet and smell blood; and that the feet  were many, and the blood was near, and that both smell and footfall  were coming from the old kloof where yellow skulls still lay, dripping  with the water that had once run red. Alan was one of the few who, by  reason of much effort, had learned the story of the kloof from old  Sokwenna; how, so long ago that Sokwenna was a young man, a hostile  tribe had descended upon his people, killing the men and stealing the  women; and how at last Sokwenna and a handful of his tribesmen fled  south with what women were left and made a final stand in the kloof,  and there, on a day that was golden and filled with the beauty of  bird-song and flowers, had ambushed their enemies and killed them to a  man. All were dead now, all but Sokwenna.
  For a space Alan was sorry he had called Sokwenna to his cabin. He  was no longer the cheerful and gentle &#8220;old man&#8221; of his people; the old  man who chortled with joy at the prettiness and play of Keok and  Nawadlook, who loved birds and flowers and little children, and who had  retained an impish boyhood along with his great age. He was changed. He  stood before Alan an embodiment of fatalism, mumbling incoherent things  in his breath, a spirit of evil omen lurking in his sunken eyes, and  his thin hands gripping like bird-claws to his rifle. Alan threw off  the uncomfortable feeling that had gripped him for a moment, and set  him to an appointed task&#8212;the watching of the southward plain from the  crest of a tall ridge two miles back on the Tanana trail. He was to  return when the sun reached its horizon.
  Alan was inspired now by a great caution, a growing premonition  which stirred him with uneasiness, and he began his own preparations as  soon as Sokwenna had started on his mission. The desire to leave at  once, without the delay of an hour, pulled strong in him, but he forced  himself to see the folly of such haste. He would be away many months,  possibly a year this time. There was much to do, a mass of detail to  attend to, a volume of instructions and advice to leave behind him. He  must at least see Stampede, and it was necessary to write down certain  laws for Tautuk and Amuk Toolik. As this work of preparation  progressed, and the premonition persisted in remaining with him, he  fell into a habit of repeating to himself the absurdity of fears and  the impossibility of danger. He tried to make himself feel  uncomfortably foolish at the thought of having ordered the herdsmen in.  In all probability Graham would not appear at all, he told himself, or  at least not for many days&#8212;or weeks; and if he did come, it would be  to war in a legal way, and not with murder.
  Yet his uneasiness did not leave him. As the hours passed and the  afternoon lengthened, the invisible something urged him more strongly  to take the trail beyond the cottonwoods, with Mary Standish at his  side. Twice he saw her between noon and five o'clock, and by that time  his writing was done. He looked at his guns carefully. He saw that his  favorite rifle and automatic were working smoothly, and he called  himself a fool for filling his ammunition vest with an extravagant  number of cartridges. He even carried an amount of this ammunition and  two of his extra guns to Sokwenna's cabin, with the thought that it was  this cabin on the edge of the ravine which was best fitted for defense  in the event of necessity. Possibly Stampede might have use for it, and  for the guns, if Graham should come after he and Mary were well on  their way to Nome.
  After supper, when the sun was throwing long shadows from the edge  of the horizon, Alan came from a final survey of his cabin and the food  which Wegaruk had prepared for his pack, and found Mary at the edge of  the ravine, watching the twilight gathering where the coulee ran  narrower and deeper between the distant breasts of the tundra.
  &#8220;I am going to leave you for a little while,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But Sokwenna  has returned, and you will not be alone.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;
  &#8220;As far as the cottonwoods, I think.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I am going with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I expect to walk very fast.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not faster than I, Alan.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I want to make sure the country is clear in that direction  before twilight shuts out the distances.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will help you.&#8221; Her hand crept into his. &#8220;I am going with you,  Alan,&#8221; she repeated.
  &#8220;Yes, I&#8212;think you are,&#8221; he laughed joyously, and suddenly he bent  his head and pressed her hand to his lips, and in that way, with her  hand in his, they set out over the trail which they had not traveled  together since the day he had come from Nome.
  There was a warm glow in her face, and something beautifully soft  and sweet in her eyes which she did not try to keep away from him. It  made him forget the cottonwoods and the plains beyond, and his caution,  and Sokwenna's advice to guard carefully against the hiding-places of  Ghost Kloof and the country beyond.
  &#8220;I have been thinking a great deal today,&#8221; she was saying, &#8220;because  you have left me so much alone. I have been thinking of<I> you</I>.  And&#8212;my thoughts have given me a wonderful happiness.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I have been&#8212;in paradise,&#8221; he replied.
  &#8220;You do not think that I am wicked?&#8221;
  &#8220;I could sooner believe the sun would never come up again.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor that I have been unwomanly?&#8221;
  &#8220;You are my dream of all that is glorious in womanhood.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yet I have followed you&#8212;have thrust myself at you, fairly at your  head, Alan.&#8221;
  &#8220;For which I thank God,&#8221; He breathed devoutly.
  &#8220;And I have told you that I love you, and you have taken me in your  arms, and have kissed me&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I am walking now with my hand in yours&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;And will continue to do so, if I can hold it.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I am another man's wife,&#8221; she shuddered.
  &#8220;You are mine,&#8221; he declared doggedly. &#8220;You know it, and the Almighty  God knows it. It is blasphemy to speak of yourself as Graham's wife.  You are legally entangled with him, and that is all. Heart and soul and  body you are free.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I am not free.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you are!&#8221;
  And then, after a moment, she whispered at his shoulder: &#8220;Alan,  because you are the finest gentleman in all the world, I will tell you  why I am not. It is because&#8212;heart and soul&#8212;I belong to you.&#8221;
  He dared not look at her, and feeling the struggle within him Mary  Standish looked straight ahead with a wonderful smile on her lips and  repeated softly, &#8220;Yes, the very finest gentleman in all the world!&#8221;
  Over the breasts of the tundra and the hollows between they went,  still hand in hand, and found themselves talking of the colorings in  the sky, and the birds, and flowers, and the twilight creeping in about  them, while Alan scanned the shortening horizons for a sign of human  life. One mile, and then another, and after that a third, and they were  looking into gray gloom far ahead, where lay the kloof.
  It was strange that he should think of the letter now&#8212;the letter he  had written to Ellen McCormick&#8212;but think of it he did, and said what  was in his mind to Mary Standish, who was also looking with him into  the wall of gloom that lay between them and the distant cottonwoods.
  &#8220;It seemed to me that I was not writing it to her, but to<I> you</I> &#8220; he said. &#8220;And I think that if you hadn't come back to me I would have  gone mad.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have the letter. It is here&#8221;&#8212;and she placed a hand upon her  breast. &#8220;Do you remember what you wrote, Alan?&#8221;
  &#8220;That you meant more to me than life.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that&#8212;particularly&#8212;you wanted Ellen McCormick to keep a tress  of my hair for you if they found me.&#8221;
  He nodded. &#8220;When I sat across the table from you aboard the<I> Nome</I>, I worshiped it and didn't know it. And since then&#8212;since I've had you  here&#8212;every time. I've looked at you&#8212;&#8221; He stopped, choking the words  back in his throat.
  &#8220;Say it, Alan.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've wanted to see it down,&#8221; he finished desperately. &#8220;Silly  notion, isn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why is it?&#8221; she asked, her eyes widening a little. &#8220;If you love it,  why is it a silly notion to want to see it down?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, I though possibly you might think it so,&#8221; he added lamely.
  Never had he heard anything sweeter than her laughter as she turned  suddenly from him, so that the glow of the fallen sun was at her back,  and with deft, swift fingers began loosening the coils of her hair  until its radiant masses tumbled about her, streaming down her back in  a silken glory that awed him with its beauty and drew from his lips a  cry of gladness.
  She faced him, and in her eyes was the shining softness that glowed  in her hair. &#8220;Do you think it is nice, Alan?&#8221;
  He went to her and filled his hands with the heavy tresses and  pressed them to his lips and face.
  Thus he stood when he felt the sudden shiver that ran through her.  It was like a little shock. He heard the catch of her breath, and the  hand which she had placed gently on his bowed head fell suddenly away.  When he raised his head to look at her, she was staring past him into  the deepening twilight of the tundra, and it seemed as if something had  stricken her so that for a space she was powerless to speak or move.
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried, and whirled about, straining his eyes to see  what had alarmed her; and as he looked, a deep, swift shadow sped over  the earth, darkening the mellow twilight until it was somber gloom of  night&#8212;and the midnight sun went out like a great, luminous lamp as a  dense wall of purple cloud rolled up in an impenetrable curtain between  it and the arctic world. Often he had seen this happen in the approach  of summer storm on the tundras, but never had the change seemed so  swift as now. Where there had been golden light, he saw his companion's  face now pale in a sea of dusk. It was this miracle of arctic night,  its suddenness and unexpectedness, that had startled her, he thought,  and he laughed softly.
  But her hand clutched his arm. &#8220;I saw them,&#8221; she cried, her voice  breaking. &#8220;I saw them&#8212;out there against the sun&#8212;before the cloud  came&#8212;and some of them were running, like animals&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Shadows!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;The long shadows of foxes running against  the sun, or of the big gray rabbits, or of a wolf and her half-grown  sneaking away&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;No, no, they were not that,&#8221; she breathed tensely, and her fingers  clung more fiercely to his arm. &#8220;They were not shadows.<I> They were  men</I>!&#8221;
