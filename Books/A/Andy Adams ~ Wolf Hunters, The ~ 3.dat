  Rod was now plunged for the first time in his life into the heart of  the Wilderness. Seated in the bow of the birch-bark canoe which was  carrying them up the Sturgeon, with Wabi close behind him, he drank in  the wild beauties of the forests and swamps through which they slipped  almost as noiselessly as shadows, his heart thumping in joyous  excitement, his eyes constantly on the alert for signs of the big game  which Wabi told him was on all sides of them. Across his knees, ready  for instant use, was Wabi's repeating rifle. The air was keen with the  freshness left by night frosts. At times deep masses of gold and  crimson forests shut them in, at others, black forests of spruce came  down to the river's edge; again they would pass silently through great  swamps of tamaracks. In this vast desolation there was a mysterious  quiet, except for the occasional sounds of wild life. Partridges  drummed back in the woods, flocks of ducks got up with a great rush of  wings at almost every turn, and once, late in the morning of the first  day out, Rod was thrilled by a crashing in the undergrowth scarcely a  stone's throw from the canoe. He could see saplings twisting and  bending, and heard Wabi whisper behind him:
  &#8220;A moose!&#8221;
  They were words to set his hands trembling and his whole body  quivering with anticipation. There was in him now none of the old  hunter's coolness, none of the almost stoical indifference with which  the men of the big North hear these sounds of the wild things about  them. Rod had yet to see his first big game.
  That moment came in the afternoon. The canoe had skimmed lightly  around a bend in the river. Beyond this bend a mass of dead driftwood  had wedged against the shore, and this driftwood, as the late sun sank  behind the forests, was bathed in a warm yellow glow. And basking in  this glow, as he loves to do at the approach of winter nights, was an  animal, the sight of which drew a sharp, excited cry from between Rod's  lips. In an instant he had recognized it as a bear. The animal was  taken completely by surprise and was less than half a dozen rods away.  Quick as a flash, and hardly realizing what he was doing, the boy drew  his rifle to his shoulder, took quick aim and fired. The bear was  already clambering up the driftwood, but stopped suddenly at the  report, slipped as if about to fall back&#8212;then continued his retreat.
  &#8220;You hit 'im!&#8221; shouted Wabi. &#8220;Quick-try 'im again!&#8221;
  Rod's second shot seemed to have no effect In his excitement he  jumped to his feet, forgetting that he was in a frail canoe, and took a  last shot at the big black beast that was just about to disappear over  the edge of the driftwood. Both Wabi and his Indian companion flung  themselves on the shore side of their birch and dug their paddles deep  into the water, but their efforts were unavailing to save their  reckless comrade. Unbalanced by the concussion of his gun, Rod plunged  backward into the river, but before he had time to sink, Wabi reached  over and grabbed him by the arm.
  &#8220;Don't make a move&#8212;and hang on to the gun!&#8221; he warned. &#8220;If we try  to get you in here we'll all go over!&#8221; He made a sign to the Indian,  who swung the canoe slowly inshore. Then he grinned down into Rod's  dripping, unhappy face.
  &#8220;By George, that last shot was a dandy for a tenderfoot! You got  your bear!&#8221;
  Despite his uncomfortable position, Rod gave a whoop of joy, and no  sooner did his feet touch solid bottom than he loosened himself from  Wabi's grip and plunged toward the driftwood. On its very top he found  the bear, as dead as a bullet through its side and another through its  head could make it. Standing there beside his first big game, dripping  and shivering, he looked down upon the two who were pulling their canoe  ashore and gave, a series of triumphant whoops that could have been  heard half a mile away.
  &#8220;It's camp and a fire for you,&#8221; laughed Wabi, hurrying up to him.  &#8220;This is better luck than I thought you'd have, Rod. We'll have a  glorious feast to-night, and a fire of this driftwood that will show  you what makes life worth the living up here in the North. Ho, Muky,&#8221;  he called to the old Indian, &#8220;cut this fellow up, will you? I'll make  camp.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can we keep the skin?&#8221; asked Rod. &#8220;It's my first, you know, and&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course we can. Give us a hand with the fire, Rod; it will keep  you from catching cold.&#8221;
  In the excitement of making their first camp, Rod almost forgot that  he was soaked to the skin, and that night was falling about them. The  first step was the building of a fire, and soon a great, crackling,  almost smokeless blaze was throwing its light and heat for thirty feet  around. Wabi now brought blankets from the canoe, stripped off a part  of his own clothes, made Rod undress, and soon had that youth swathed  in dry togs, while his wet ones were hung close up to the fire. For the  first time Rod saw the making of a wilderness shelter. Whistling  cheerily, Wabi got an ax from the canoe, went into the edge of the  cedars and cut armful after armful of saplings and boughs. Tying his  blankets about himself, Rod helped to carry these, a laughable and  grotesque figure as he stumbled about clumsily in his efforts. Within  half an hour the cedar shelter was taking form. Two crotched saplings  were driven into the ground eight feet apart, and from one to the  other, resting in the crotches, was placed another sapling, which  formed the ridge-pole; and from this pole there ran slantwise to the  earth half a dozen others, making a framework upon which the cedar  boughs were piled. By the time the old Indian had finished his bear the  home was completed, and with its beds of sweet-smelling boughs, the  great camp-fire in front and the dense wilderness about them growing  black with the approach of night, Rod thought that nothing in  picture-book or story could quite equal the reality of that moment. And  when, a few moments later, great bear-steaks were broiling over a mass  of coals, and the odor of coffee mingled with that of meal-cakes  sizzling on a heated stone, he knew that his dearest dreams had come  true.
  That night in the glow of the camp-fire Rod listened to the  thrilling stories of Wabi and the old Indian, and lay awake until  nearly dawn, listening to the occasional howl of a wolf, mysterious  splashings in the river and the shrill notes of the night birds. There  were varied experiences in the following three days: one frosty morning  before the others were awake he stole out from the camp with Wabi's  rifle and shot twice at a red deer&#8212;which he missed both times; there  was an exciting but fruitless race with a swimming caribou in Sturgeon  Lake, at which Wabi himself took three long-range shots without effect.
  It was on a glorious autumn afternoon that Wabi's keen eyes first  descried the log buildings of the Post snuggled in the edge of the  seemingly unending forest. As they approached he joyfully pointed out  the different buildings to Rod&#8212;the Company store, the little cluster  of employees' homes and the factor's house, where Rod was to meet his  welcome. At least Roderick himself had thought it would be there. But  as they came nearer a single canoe shot out suddenly from the shore and  the young hunters could see a white handkerchief waving them greeting.  Wabi replied with a whoop of pleasure and fired his gun into the air.
  &#8220;It's Minnetaki!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;She said she would watch for us and  come out to meet us!&#8221;
  Minnetaki! A little nervous thrill shot through Rod. Wabi had  described her to him a thousand times in those winter evenings at home;  with a brother's love and pride he had always brought her into their  talks and plans, and somehow, little by little, Rod had grown to like  her very much without ever having seen her.
  The two canoes swiftly approached each other, and in a few minutes  more were alongside. With a glad laughing cry Minnetaki leaned over and  kissed her brother, while at the same time her dark eyes shot a curious  glance at the youth of whom she had read and heard so much.
  At this time Minnetaki was fifteen. Like her mother's race she was  slender, of almost woman's height, and unconsciously as graceful as a  fawn in her movements. A slightly waving wealth of raven hair framed  what Rod thought to be one of the prettiest faces he had ever seen, and  entwined in the heavy silken braid that fell over her shoulder were a  number of red autumn leaves. As she straightened herself in her canoe  she looked at Rod and smiled, and he in making a polite effort to lift  his cap in civilized style, lost that article of apparel in a sudden  gust of wind. In an instant there was a general laugh of merriment in  which even the old Indian joined. The little incident did more toward  making comradeship than anything else that might have happened, and  laughing again into Rod's face Minnetaki urged her canoe toward the  floating cap.
  &#8220;You shouldn't wear such things until it gets cold,&#8221; she said, after  retrieving the cap and handing it to him. &#8220;Wabi does&#8212;but I don't!&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I won't,&#8221; replied Rod gallantly, and at Wabi's burst of  laughter both blushed.
  That first night at the Post Rod found that Wabi had already made  all plans for the winter's hunting, and the white youth's complete  equipment was awaiting him in the room assigned to him in the factor's  house&#8212;a deadly looking five-shot Remington, similar to Wabi's, a  long-barreled, heavy-caliber revolver, snow-shoes, and a dozen other  articles necessary to one about to set out upon a long expedition in  the wilderness. Wabi had also mapped out their hunting-grounds. Wolves  in the immediate neighborhood of the Post, where they were being  constantly sought by the Indians and the factor's men, had become  exceedingly cautious and were not numerous, but in the almost  untraveled wilderness a hundred miles to the north and east they were  literally overrunning the country, killing moose, caribou and deer in  great numbers.
  In this region Wabi planned to make their winter quarters. And no  time was to be lost in taking up the trail, for the log house in which  they would pass the bitterly cold months should be built before the  heavy snows set in. It was therefore decided that the young hunters  should start within a week, accompanied by Mukoki, the old Indian, a  cousin of the slain Wabigoon, whom Wabi had given the nickname of Muky  and who had been a faithful comrade to him from his earliest childhood.
  Rod made the most of the six days which were allotted to him at the  Post, and while Wabi helped to handle the affairs of the Company's  store during a short absence of his father at Port Arthur, the lovely  little Minnetaki gave our hero his first lessons in woodcraft. In  canoe, with the rifle, and in reading the signs of forest life Wabi's  sister awakened constantly increasing admiration in Rod. To see her  bending over some freshly made trail, her cheeks flushed, her eyes  sparkling with excitement, her rich hair filled with the warmth of the  sun, was a picture to arouse enthusiasm even in the heart of a  youngster of eighteen, and a hundred times the boy mentally vowed that  &#8220;she was a brick&#8221; from the tips of her pretty moccasined feet to the  top of her prettier head. Half a dozen times at least he voiced this  sentiment to Wabi, and Wabi agreed with great enthusiasm. In fact, by  the time the week was almost gone Minnetaki and Rod had become great  chums, and it was not without some feeling of regret that the young  wolf hunter greeted the dawn of the day that was to see them begin  their journey deeper into the wilds.
  Minnetaki was one of the earliest risers at the Post. Rod was seldom  behind her. But on this particular morning he was late and heard the  girl whistling outside half an hour before he was dressed&#8212;for  Minnetaki could whistle in a manner that often filled him with envy. By  the time he came down she had disappeared in the edge of the forest,  and Wabi, who was also ahead of him, was busy with Mukoki tying up  their equipment in packs. It was a glorious morning, clear and frosty,  and Rod noticed that a thin shell of ice had formed on the lake during  the night. Once or twice Wabi turned toward the forest and gave his  signal whoop, but received no reply.
  &#8220;I don't see why Minnetaki doesn't come back,&#8221; he remarked  carelessly, as he fastened a shoulder-strap about a bundle. &#8220;Breakfast  will be ready in a jiffy. Hunt her up, will you, Rod?&#8221;
  Nothing loath, Rod started out on a brisk run along the path which  he knew to be a favorite with Minnetaki and shortly it brought him down  to a pebbly stretch of the beach where she frequently left her canoe.  That she had been here a few minutes before he could tell by the fact  that the ice about the birch-bark was broken, as though the girl had  tested its thickness by shoving the light craft out into it for a few  feet. Her footsteps led plainly up the shelving shore and into the  forest.
  &#8220;O Minnetaki&#8212;Minnetaki!&#8221;
  Rod called loudly and listened. There was no response. As if  impelled by some presentiment which he himself could not explain, the  boy hurried deeper into the forest along the narrow path which  Minnetaki must have taken. Five minutes&#8212;ten minutes&#8212;and he called  again. Still there was no answer. Possibly the girl had not gone so  far, or she might have left the path for the thick woods. A little  farther on there was a soft spot in the path where a great tree-trunk  had rotted half a century before, leaving a rich black soil. Clearly  traced in this were the imprints of Minnetaki's moccasins. For a full  minute Rod stopped and listened, making not a sound. Why he maintained  silence he could not have explained. But he knew that he was half a  mile from the Post, and that Wabi's sister should not be here at  breakfast time. In this minute's quiet he unconsciously studied the  tracks in the ground. How small the pretty Indian maiden's feet were!  And he noticed, too, that her moccasins, unlike most moccasins, had a  slight heel.
  But in a moment more his inspection was cut short. Was that a cry he  heard far ahead? His heart seemed to stop beating, his blood  thrilled&#8212;and in another instant he was running down the path like a  deer. Twenty rods beyond this point the path entered an opening in the  forest made by a great fire, and half-way across this opening the youth  saw a sight which chilled him to the marrow. There was Minnetaki, her  long hair tumbling loosely down her back, a cloth tied around her  head&#8212;and on either side an Indian dragging her swiftly toward the  opposite forest!
  For as long as he might have drawn three breaths Rod stood  transfixed with horror. Then his senses returned to him, and every  muscle in his body seemed to bound with action. For days he had been  practising with his revolver and it was now in the holster at his side.  Should he use it? Or might he hit Minnetaki? At his feet he saw a club  and snatching this up he sped across the opening, the soft earth  holding the sound of his steps. When he was a dozen feet behind the  Indians Minnetaki stumbled in a sudden effort to free herself, and as  one of her captors half turned to drag her to her feet he saw the  enraged youth, club uplifted, bearing down upon them like a demon. A  terrific yell from Rod, a warning cry from the Indian, and the fray  began. With crushing force, the boy's club fell upon the shoulder of  the second Indian, and before he could recover from the delivery of  this blow the youth was caught in a choking, deadly grip by the other  from behind.
  Freed by the sudden attack, Minnetaki tore away the cloth that bound  her eyes and mouth. As quick as a flash she took in the situation. At  her feet the wounded Indian was half rising, and upon the ground near  him, struggling in close embrace, were Rod and the other. She saw the  Indian's fatal grip upon her preserver's throat, the whitening face and  wide-open eyes, and with a great, sobbing cry she caught up the fallen  club and brought it down with all her strength upon the redskin's head.  Twice, three times the club rose and fell, and the grip on Rod's throat  relaxed. A fourth time it rose, but this time was caught from behind,  and a huge hand clutched the brave girl's throat so that the cry on her  lips died in a gasp. But the relief gave Rod his opportunity. With a  tremendous effort he reached his pistol holster, drew out the gun, and  pressed it close up against his assailant's body. There was a muffled  report and with a shriek of agony the Indian pitched backward. Hearing  the shot and seeing the effect upon his comrade, the second Indian  released his hold on Minnetaki and ran for the forest. Rod, seeing  Minnetaki fall in a sobbing, frightened heap, forgot all else but to  run to her, smooth back her hair and comfort her with all of the  assurances at his boyish command.
  It was here that Wabi and the old Indian guide found them five  minutes later. Hearing Rod's first piercing yell of attack, they had  raced into the forest, afterward guided by the two or three shrill  screams which Minnetaki had unconsciously emitted during the struggle.  Close behind them, smelling trouble, followed two of the Post  employees.
  The attempted abduction of Wabi's sister, Rod's heroic rescue and  the death of one of the captors, who was recognized as one of Woonga's  men, caused a seven-day sensation at the Post.
  There was now no thought of leaving on the part of the young wolf  hunters. It was evident that Woonga was again in the neighborhood, and  Wabi and Rod, together with a score of Indians and hunters, spent days  in scouring the forests and swamps. But the Woongas disappeared as  suddenly as they came. Not until Wabi had secured a promise from  Minnetaki that she would no longer go into the forests unaccompanied  did the Indian youth again allow himself to take up their interrupted  plans.
  Minnetaki had been within easy calling distance of help when the  Woongas, without warning, sprang upon her, smothered her attempted  cries and dragged her away, compelling her to walk alone over the soft  earth where Rod had seen her footsteps, so that any person who followed  might suppose she was alone and safe. This fact stirred the dozen white  families at the Post into aggressive action, and four of the most  skillful Indian track-hunters in the service were detailed to devote  themselves exclusively to hunting down the outlaws, their operations  not to include a territory extending more than twenty miles from  Wabinosh House in any direction. With these precautions it was believed  that no harm could come to Minnetaki or other young girls of the Post.
  It was, therefore, on a Monday, the fourth day of November, that  Rod, Wabi and Mukoki turned their faces at last to the adventures that  awaited them in the great North.
