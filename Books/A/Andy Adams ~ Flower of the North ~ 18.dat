  Philip stood where Jeanne had left him, his arms half reaching out   to the vacant door through which she had fled, his lips parted as  if  to call her name, and yet motionless, dumb. A moment before he  was  intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness. He had held  Jeanne in  his arms; he had looked into her eyes, filled with  surrender under his  caresses and his avowal of love. For a moment  he had possessed her,  and now he was alone. The cry that had wrung  itself from her lips,  breaking in upon his happiness like a blow,  still rang in his ears,  and there was something in the exquisite  pain of it that left him in  torment. Heart and soul, every drop of  blood in him, had leaped in the  joy of that glorious moment, when  Jeanne's eyes and sweet lips had  accepted his love, and her arms  had clung about his shoulders. Now  these things had been struck  dead within him. He felt again the fierce  pressure of Jeanne's  arms as she had thrust him away, he saw the  fright and torture  that had leaped into her eyes as she sprang from  him, as though  his touch had suddenly become a sacrilege. He lowered  his arms  slowly, and went to the hall. It was empty. He heard no  sound, and  closed the door. 
  It was so still that he could hear the excited throbbing of his   own heart. He looked at the picture again, and a strange fancy   impressed him with the idea that it was no longer smiling at him,  but  that its eyes were turned to the door through which Jeanne had   disappeared. He moved his position, and the illusion was gone. It  was  Jeanne looking down upon him again, an older and happier  Jeanne than  the one whom he loved. For the first time he examined  it closely. In  one corner of the canvas he found the artist's  name, Bourret, and  after it the date, 1888. Could it be the  picture of Jeanne's mother?  He told himself that it was  impossible, for Jeanne's mother had been  found dead in the snow,  five years later than the date of the canvas,  and Pierre, the  half-breed, had buried her somewhere out on the  barren, so that  she was a mystery to all but him. Even the master of  Fort o' God,  to whom he had brought the child, had never seen the  woman upon  whose cold breast Pierre had found the little Jeanne. 
  With nervous hands he replaced the picture with its face to the   wall, and began to pace up and down the room, wondering if  D'Arcambal  would send for him. He had hope of seeing Jeanne again  that night. He  felt sure that she had gone to her room, and that  even D'Arcambal  might not know that he was alone. In that event he  had a long night  ahead of him, filled with hours of sleeplessness  and torment. He  waited for three-quarters of an hour, and then the  idea came to him  that he might discover some plausible excuse for  seeking out his host.  He was about to act upon this mental  suggestion when he heard a low  rustling in the hall, followed by a  distinct and yet timid knock. It  was not a man's knock, and filled  with the hope that Jeanne had  returned, Philip hastened to the  door and opened it. 
  He heard soft footsteps retreating rapidly down the hall, but the   lights were out, and he could see nothing. Something had fallen at   his feet, and he bent down to pick it up. The object was a small,   square envelope; and re-entering his room he saw his own name  written  across it in Jeanne's delicate hand. His heart beat with  hope as he  opened the note. What he read brought a gray pallor  into his face: 
  MONSIEUR PHILIP,&#8212;If you cannot forget what I have done, please at   least try to forgive me. No woman in the world could value your  love  more than I, for circumstances have proven to me the strength  and  honor of the man who gives it. And yet it is as impossible for  me to  accept it as it would be for me to give up Fort o' God, my  father, or  my life, though I cannot tell you why. And this, I  know, you will not  ask. After what has happened to-night it will  be impossible for me to  see you again, and I must ask you, as one  who values your friendship  among the highest things in my life, to  leave Fort o' God. No one must  know what has passed between us.  You will go&#8212;in the morning. And with  you there will always be my  prayers. 
  JEANNE. 
  The paper dropped from between Philip's fingers and fell to the   floor. Three or four times in his life Philip had received blows  that  had made him sick&#8212;physical blows. He felt now as though one  of these  blows had descended upon him, turning things black before  his eyes. He  staggered to the big chair and dropped into it,  staring at the bit of  white paper on the floor. If one had spoken  to him he would not have  heard. Gregson, in these moments, might  have laughed a little  nervously, smoked innumerable cigarettes,  and laid plans for a  continuance of the battle to-morrow. But  Philip was a fighter of men,  and not of women. He had declared his  love, he had laid open his soul  to Jeanne, and to a heart like his  own, simple in its language,  boundless in its sincerity, this was  all that could be done. Jeanne's  refusal of his love was the end&#8212;  for him. He accepted his fate  without argument. In an instant he  would have fought ten men&#8212;a  hundred, naked-handed, if such a  fight would have given him a chance  of winning Jeanne; he would  have died, laughing, happy, if it had been  in a struggle for her.  But Jeanne herself had dealt him the blow. 
  For a long time he sat motionless in the chair facing the picture   on the wall. Then he rose to his feet, picked up the note, and  went  to one of the little square windows that looked out into the  night.  The moon had risen, and the sky was full of stars. He knew  that he was  looking into the north, for the pale shimmer of the  aurora was in his  face. He saw the black edge of the spruce  forest; the barren stretched  out, pale and ghostly, into the night  shadows. 
  He made an effort to open the window, but it was wedged tightly in   its heavy sill. He crossed the room, opened the door, and went   silently down the hall to the door through which Pierre had led  him a  few hours before. It was not locked, and he passed out into  the night.  The fresh air was like a tonic, and he walked swiftly  out into the  moonlit spaces, until he found himself in the deep  shadow of the Sun  Rock that towered like a sentinel giant above  his head. He made his  way around its huge base, and then stopped,  close to where they had  landed in the canoe. There was another  canoe drawn up beside Pierre's,  and two figures stood out clear in  the moonlight. 
  One of these was a man, the other a woman, and as Philip stopped,   wondering at the scene, the man advanced to the woman and caught  her  in his embrace. He heard a voice, low and expostulating, which  sounded  like Otille's, and in spite of his own misery Philip  smiled at this  other love which had found its way to Fort o' God.  He turned back  softly, leaving the lovers as he had found them;  but he had scarce  taken half a dozen steps when he heard other  steps, and saw that the  girl had left her companion and was  hurrying toward him. He drew back  close into the shadow of the  rock to avoid possible discovery, and the  girl passed through the  moonlight almost within arm's reach of him. At  that moment his  heart ceased to beat. He choked back the groaning cry  that rose to  his lips. It was not Otille who passed him. It was  Jeanne. 
  In another moment she was gone. The man had shoved his canoe into   the narrow stream, and was already lost in the gloom. Then, and  not  until then, did the cry of torture fall from Philip. And as if  in echo  to it he heard the sobbing break of another voice, and  stepping out  into the moonlight he stood face to face with Pierre  Couchee. 
  It was Pierre who spoke first. 
  &quot;I am sorry, M'sieur,&quot; he whispered, hoarsely. &quot;I know that it has   broken your heart. And mine, too, is crushed.&quot; 
  Something in the half-breed's face, in the choking utterance of   his voice, struck Philip as new and strange. He had seen the eyes  of  dying animals filled with the wild pain that glowed in  Pierre's, and  suddenly he reached out and gripped the other's  hand, and they stood  staring into each other's face. In that look,  the cold grip of their  hands, the strife in their eyes, the bare  truth revealed itself. 
  &quot;And you, too&#8212;you love her, Pierre,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;Yes, I love her, M'sieur,&quot; replied Pierre, softly. &quot;I love her,   not as a brother, but as a man whose heart is broken.&quot; 
  &quot;Now&#8212;I understand,&quot; said Philip. 
  He dropped Pierre's hand, and his voice was cold and lifeless. 
  &quot;I received a note&#8212;from her, asking me to leave Fort o' God in   the morning,&quot; he went on, looking from Pierre out beyond the rock   into the white barren. &quot;I will go to-night.&quot; 
  &quot;It is best,&quot; said Pierre. 
  &quot;I have left nothing in Fort o' God, so there is no need of even   returning to my room,&quot; continued Philip. &quot;Jeanne will understand,  but  you must tell her father that a messenger came suddenly from  Blind  Indian Lake, and that I thought it best to leave without  awakening  him. &quot;Will you guide me for a part of the distance,  Pierre?&quot; 
  &quot;I will go with you the whole way, M'sieur. It is only twenty   miles, ten by canoe, ten by land.&quot; 
  They said no more, but both went to the canoe, and were quickly   lost in the gloom into which the other canoe had disappeared a few   minutes ahead of them. They saw nothing of this canoe, and when  they  came to the Churchill Pierre headed the birch-bark down-  stream. For  two hours not a word passed between them. At the end  of that time the  half-breed turned in to shore. 
  &quot;We take the trail here, M'sieur,&quot; he explained. 
  He went on ahead, walking swiftly, and now and then when Philip   caught a glimpse of his face he saw in it a despair as great as  his  own. The trail led along the backbone of a huge ridge, and  then  twisted down into a broad plain; and across this they  traveled, one  after the other, two moving, silent shadows in a  desolation that  seemed without end. Beyond the plain there rose  another ridge, and  half an hour after they had struck the top of  it Pierre halted, and  pointed off into the ghostly world of light  and shadow that lay at  their feet. 
  &quot;Your camp is on the other side of this plain, M'sieur,&quot; he said.   &quot;Do you recognize the country?&quot; 
  &quot;I have hunted along this ridge,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;It is only   three miles from here, and I will strike a beaten trail half a  mile  out yonder. A thousand thanks, Pierre.&quot; 
  He held out his hand. 
  &quot;Good-by, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;Good-by, Pierre.&quot; 
  Their voices trembled. Their hands gripped hard. A choking lump   rose in Philip's throat, and Pierre turned away. He disappeared   slowly in the gray gloom, and Philip went down the side of the   mountain. From the plain below he looked back. For an instant he  saw  Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky. 
  &quot;Good-by, Pierre,&quot; he shouted. 
  &quot;Good-by, M'sieur&quot; came back faintly. 
  Light and silence dropped about them.
