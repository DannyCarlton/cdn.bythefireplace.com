  In the slowly breaking gloom of the cabin, with Marette's arms   round his neck, her soft lips given him to kiss, Kent for many   minutes was conscious of nothing but the thrill of his one great  hope  on earth come true. What he had prayed for was no longer a  prayer, and  what he had dreamed of was no longer a dream; yet for  a space the  reality of it seemed unreal. What he said in those  first moments of  his exaltation he would probably never remember. 
  His own physical existence seemed a thing trivial and almost lost,   a thing submerged and swallowed up by the warm beat and throb of  that  other life, a thousand times more precious than his own,  which he held  in his arms. Yet with the mad thrill that possessed  him, in the  embrace of his arms, there was an infinite tenderness,  a gentleness,  that drew from Marette's lips a low, glad whispering  of his name. She  drew his head down and kissed him, and Kent fell  upon his knees at her  side and crushed his face close down to her  &#8212;while outside the patter  of rain on the roof had ceased, and the  fog-like darkness was breaking  with gray dawn. 
  In that dawn of the new day Kent came at last out of the cabin and   looked upon a splendid world. In his breast was the glory of a  thing  new-born, and the world, like himself, was changed. Storm  had passed.  The gray river lay under his eyes. Shoreward he made  out the dark  outlines of the deep spruce and cedar and balsam  forests. About him  there was a great stillness, broken only by the  murmur of the river  and the ripple of water under the scow. Wind  had gone with the black  rainclouds, and Kent, as he looked about  him, saw the swift  dissolution of the last shadows of night, and  the breaking in the East  of a new paradise. In the East, as the  minutes passed, there came a  soft and luminous gray, and after  that, swiftly, with the miracle of  far Northern dawn, a vast, low-  burning fire seemed to start far  beyond the forests, tinting the  sky with a delicate pink that crept  higher and higher as Kent  watched it. The river, all at once, came out  of its last drifting  haze of fog and night. The scow was about in the  middle of the  channel. Two hundred yards on either side were thick  green walls  of forest glistening fresh and cool with the wet of storm  and  breathing forth the perfume which Kent was drawing deep into his   lungs. 
  In the cabin he heard sound. Marette was up, and he was eager to   have her come out and stand with him in this glory of their first   day. He watched the smoke of the fire he had built, hardwood smoke   that drifted up white and clean into the rain-washed air. 
  The smell of it, like the smell of balsam and cedar, was to Kent   the aroma of life. And then he began to clean out what was left of   the water in the bottom of the scow, and as he worked he whistled.  He  wanted Marette to hear that whistle. He wanted her to know that  day  had brought with it no doubt for him. A great and glorious  world was  about them and ahead of them. And they were safe. 
  As he worked, his mind became more than ever set upon the   resolution to take no chances. He paused in his whistling for a   moment to laugh softly and exultantly as he thought of the years  of  experience which were his surest safeguard now. He had become  almost  uncannily expert in all the finesse and trickery of his  craft of  hunting human game, and he knew what the man-hunters  would do and what  they would not do. He had them checkmated at the  start. And,  besides&#8212;with Kedsty, O'Connor, and himself gone&#8212;the  Landing was  short-handed just at present. There was an enormous  satisfaction in  that. But even with a score of men behind him Kent  knew that he would  beat them. His hazard, if there was peril at  all, lay in this first  day. Only the Police gasoline launch could  possibly overtake them. And  with the start they had, he was sure  they would pass the Death Chute,  conceal the scow, and take to the  untracked forests north and west  before the launch could menace  them. After that he would keep always  west and north, deeper and  deeper into that wild and untraveled  country which would be the  last place in which the Law would seek for  them. He straightened  himself and looked at the smoke again, drifting  like gray-white  lace between him and the blue of the sky, and in that  moment the  sun capped the tall green tops of the highest cedars, and  day  broke gloriously over the earth. 
  For a quarter of an hour longer Kent mopped at the floor of the   scow, and then&#8212;with a suddenness that drew him up as if a whip-  lash  had snapped behind him&#8212;he caught another aroma in the clean,   forest-scented air. It was bacon and coffee! He had believed that   Marette was taking her time in putting on dry footwear and making   some sort of morning toilet. Instead of that, she was getting   breakfast. It was not an extraordinary thing to do. To fry bacon  and  make coffee was not, in any sense, a remarkable achievement.  But at  the present moment it was the crowning touch to Kent's  paradise. She  was getting HIS breakfast! And&#8212;coffee and bacon&#8212;To  Kent those two  things had always stood for home. They were  intimate and  companionable. Where there were coffee and bacon, he  had known  children who laughed, women who sang, and men with  happy, welcoming  faces. They were home-builders. 
  &quot;Whenever you smell coffee and bacon at a cabin,&quot; O'Connor had   always said, &quot;they'll ask you in to breakfast if you knock at the   door.&quot; 
  But Kent was not recalling his old trail mate's words. In the   present moment all other thoughts were lost in the discovery that   Marette was getting breakfast&#8212;for him. 
  He went to the door and listened. Then he opened it and looked in.   Marette was on her knees before the open door of the stove,  toasting  bread on two forks. Her face was flushed pink. She had  not taken time  to brush her hair, but had woven it carelessly into  a thick braid that  fell down her back. She gave a little  exclamation of mock  disappointment when she saw Kent. 
  &quot;Why didn't you wait?&quot; she remonstrated. &quot;I wanted to surprise   you.&quot; 
  &quot;You have,&quot; he said. &quot;And I couldn't wait. I had to come in and   help.&quot; 
  He was inside the door and on his knees beside her. As he reached   for the two forks, his lips pressed against her hair. The pink   deepened in Marette's face, and the soft little note that was like   laughter came into her throat. Her hand caressed his cheek as she   rose to her feet, and Kent laughed back. And after that, as she   arranged things on the shelf table, her hand now and then touched  his  shoulder, or his hair, and two or three times he heard that  wonderful  little throat-note that sent through him a wild pulse of  happiness.  And then, he sitting in the low chair and she on the  stool, they drew  close together before the board that answered as  a table, and ate  their breakfast. Marette poured his coffee and  stirred sugar and  condensed milk in it, and so happy was Kent that  he did not tell her  he used neither milk nor sugar in his coffee.  The morning sun burst  through the little window, and through the  open door Kent pointed to  the glory of it on the river and in the  shimmering green of the  forests slipping away behind. When they  had finished, Marette went  outside with him. 
  For a space she stood silent and without movement, looking upon   the marvelous world that encompassed them. It seemed to Kent that  for  a few moments she did not breathe. With her head thrown back  and her  white throat bare to the soft, balsam-laden air she faced  the forests.  Her eyes became suddenly filled with the luminous  glow of stars. Her  face reflected the radiance of the rising sun,  and Kent, looking at  her, knew that he had never seen her so  beautiful as in these  wonderful moments. He held his own breath,  for he also knew that  Niska, his goddess, was looking upon her own  world again after a long  time away. 
  Her world&#8212;and his. Different from all the other worlds God had   ever made; different, even, from the world only a few miles behind   them at the Landing. For here was no sound or whisper of  destroying  human life. They were in the embrace of the Great  North, and it was  drawing them closer, and with each minute nearer  to the mighty,  pulsing heart of it. 
  The forests hung heavy and green and glistening with the wet of   storm; out of them came the tremulous breath of life and the glory  of  living; they hugged the shores like watchful hosts guarding the  river  from civilization&#8212;and suddenly the girl held out her arms,  and Kent  heard the low, thrilling cry that came to her lips. 
  She had forgotten him. She had forgotten everything but the river,   the forests, and the untrod worlds beyond them, and he was glad.  For  this world that she was welcoming, that her soul was crying  out to,  was his world, for ever and ever. It held his dreams, his  hopes, all  the desires that he had in life. And when at last  Marette turned  toward him slowly, his arms were reaching out to  her, and in his face  she saw that same glory which filled her own. 
  &quot;I'm glad&#8212;glad,&quot; she cried softly. &quot;Oh, Jeems&#8212;I'm glad!&quot; 
  She came into his arms without hesitation; her hands stroked his   face; and then she stood with her head against his shoulder,  looking  ahead, breathing deeply now of the sweet, clear air filled  with the  elixir of the hovering forests. She did not speak, or  move, and Kent  remained quiet. The scow drifted around a bend.  Shoreward a great  moose splashed up out of the water, and they  could hear him afterward,  crashing through the forest. Her body  tensed, but she did not speak.  After a little he heard her  whisper, 
  &quot;It has been a long time, Jeems. I have been away four years.&quot; 
  &quot;And now we are going home, little Gray Goose. You will not be   lonely?&quot; 
  &quot;No. I was lonely down there. There were so many people, and so   many things, that I was homesick for the woods and mountains. I   believe I would have died soon. There were only two things I  loved,  Jeems&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Pretty dresses&#8212;and shoes.&quot; 
  His arms closed about her a little more tightly. &quot;I&#8212;I   understand,&quot; he laughed softly. &quot;That is why you came, that first   time, with pretty high-heeled pumps.&quot; 
  He bowed his head, and she turned her face to him. On her upturned   mouth he kissed her. 
  &quot;More than any other man ever loved a woman I love you, Niska,   little goddess,&quot; he cried. 
  The minutes and the hours of that day stood out ever afterward in   Kent's life as unforgettable memories. There were times when they   seemed illusory and unreal, as though he lived and breathed in an   insubstantial world made up of gossamer things which must be the   fabric of dream. These were moments when the black shadow of the   tragedy from which they were fleeing pressed upon him, when the   thought came to him that they were criminals racing with the law;   that they were not on enchanted ground, but in deadly peril; that  it  was all a fools' paradise from which some terrible shock would  shortly  awaken him. But these periods of apprehension were, in  themselves,  mere shadows thrown for a moment upon his happiness.  Again and again  the subconscious force within him pounded home to  his physical brain  the great truth, that it was all  extraordinarily real. 
  It was Marette who made him doubt himself at times. He could not,   quite yet, comprehend the fulness of that love which she had given   him. More than ever, in the glory of this love that had come to  them  she was like a child to him. It seemed to him in the first  hours of  the morning that she had forgotten yesterday, and the day  before, and  ill the days before that. She was going home. She  whispered that to  him so often that it became a little song in his  brain. Yet she told  him nothing of that home, and he waited,  knowing that the fulfilment  of her promise was not far away. And  there was no embarrassment in the  manner of her surrender when he  held her in his arms, and she held her  face up, so that he could  kiss her mouth and look into her glowing,  lovely eyes. What he saw  was the flush of a great happiness, the  almost childish confession  of it along with the woman's joy of  possession. And he thought of  Kedsty, and of the Law that was rousing  itself into life back at  Athabasca Landing. 
  And then she ran her fingers through his own and told him to wait,   and ran into the cabin and came out a moment later with her brush;   and after that she seated herself at the fulcrum of the big sweep  and  began to brush out her hair in the sun. 
  &quot;I'm glad you love it, Jeems,&quot; she said. 
  She unbound the thick braid and let the silken strands of it run   caressingly between her fingers. She smoothed it out, brushed it   until it was more beautiful than he had ever seen it, in that glow  of  the sun. She held it up so that it rippled out in shimmering  cascades  about her&#8212;and then, suddenly, Kent saw the short tress  from which had  been clipped the rope of hair that he had taken  from Kedsty's neck.  And as his lips tightened, crushing fiercely  the exclamation of his  horror, there came a trembling happiness  from Marette's lips, scarcely  more than the whisper of a song, the  low, thrilling melody of Le  Chaudiere. 
  Her arms reached up, and she drew his head down to her, so that   for a time his visions were blinded in that sweet smother of her   hair. 
  The intimacy of that day was in itself like a dream. Hour after   hour they drifted deeper into the great North. The sun shone. The   forest-walled shores of the river grew mightier in their stillness   and their grandeur, and the vast silence of unpeopled places  brooded  over the world. To Kent it was as if they were drifting  through  Paradise. Occasionally he found it necessary to work the  big sweep,  for still water was gradually giving way to a swifter  current. 
  Beyond that there was no labor for him to perform. It seemed to   him that with each of these wonderful hours danger was being left   farther and still farther behind them. Watching the shores,  looking  ahead, listening for sound that might come from behind&#8212;at  times  possessed of the exquisite thrills of children in their   happiness&#8212;Kent and Marette found the gulf of strangeness passing   swiftly away from between them. 
  They did not speak of Kedsty, or the tragedy, or again of the   death of John Barkley. But Kent told of his days in the North, of  his  aloneness, of the wild, weird love in his soul for the deepest   wildernesses. And from that he went away back into dim and distant   yesterdays, alive with mellowed memories of boyhood days spent on  a  farm. To all these things Marette listened with glowing eyes,  with low  laughter, or with breath that rose or fell with his own  emotions. 
  She told of her own days down at school and of their appalling   loneliness; of childhood spent in the forests; of the desire to  live  there always. But she did not speak intimately of herself or  her life  in its more vital aspects; she said nothing of the home  in the Valley  of Silent Men, nothing of father or mother, sisters  or brothers. There  was no embarrassment in her omissions. And Kent  did not question. He  knew that those were among the things she  would tell him when that  promised hour came, the hour when he  would tell her they were safe. 
  There began to possess him now a growing eagerness for this hour,   when they should leave the river and take to the forests. He   explained to Marette why they could not float on indefinitely. The   river was the one great artery through which ran the blood of all   traffic to the far North. It was patrolled. Sooner or later they   would be discovered. In the forests, with a thousand untrod trails  to  choose, they would be safe. He had only one reason for keeping  to the  river until they passed through the Death Chute. It would  carry them  beyond a great swampy region to the westward through  which it would be  impossible for them to make their way at this  season of the year.  Otherwise he would have gone ashore now. He  loved the river, had faith  in it, but he knew that not until the  deep forests swallowed them, as  a vast ocean swallows a ship,  would they be beyond the peril that  threatened them from the  Landing. 
  Three or four times between sunrise and noon they saw life ashore   and on the stream; once a scow tied to a tree, then an Indian  camp,  and twice trappers' shacks built in the edge of little  clearings. With  the beginning of afternoon Kent felt growing  within him something that  was not altogether eagerness. It was, at  times, a disturbing emotion,  a foreshadowing of evil, a warning  for him to be on his guard. He used  the sweep more, to help their  progress in the current, and he began to  measure time and distance  with painstaking care. He recognized many  landmarks. 
  By four o'clock, or five at the latest, they would strike the head   of the Chute. Ten minutes of its thrilling passage and he would  work  the scow into the concealment he had in mind ashore, and no  longer  would he fear the arm of the law that reached out from the  Landing. As  he planned, he listened. From noon on he never ceased  to listen for  that distant putt, putt, putt, that would give them  a mile's warning  of the approach of the patrol launch. 
  He did not keep his plans to himself. Marette sensed his growing   uneasiness, and he made her a partner of his thoughts. 
  &quot;If we hear the patrol before we reach the Chute, we'll still have   time to run ashore,&quot; he assured her. &quot;And they won't catch us.  We'll  be harder to find than two needles in a haystack. But it's  best to be  prepared.&quot; 
  So he brought out his pack and Marette's smaller bundle, and laid   his rifle and pistol holster across them. 
  It was three o'clock when the character of the river began to   change, and Kent smiled happily. They were entering upon swifter   waters. There were places where the channel narrowed, and they  sped  through rapids. Only where unbroken straight waters stretched  out  ahead of them did Kent give his arms a rest at the sweep. And  through  most of the straight water he added to the speed of the  scow. Marette  helped him. In him the exquisite thrill of watching  her slender,  glorious body as it worked with his own never grew  old. She laughed at  him over the big oar between them. The wind  and sun played riot in her  hair. Her parted lips were rose-red,  her cheeks flushed, her eyes like  sun-warmed rock violets. More  than once, in the thrill of that  afternoon flight, as he looked at  the marvelous beauty of her, he  asked himself if it could be  anything but a dream. And more than once  he laughed joyously, and  paused in his swinging of the sweep, and  proved that it was real  and true. And Kent thanked God, and worked  harder. 
  Once, a long time ago, Marette told him, she had been through the   Chute. It had horrified her then. She remembered it as a sort of   death monster, roaring for its victims. As they drew nearer to it,   Kent told her more about it. Only now and then was a life lost  there  now, he said. At the mouth of the Chute there was a great,  knife-like  rock, like a dragon's tooth, that cut the Chute into  two roaring  channels. If a scow kept to the left-hand channel it  was safe. There  would be a mighty roaring and thundering as it  swept on its passage,  but that roaring of the Chute, he told her,  was like the barking of a  harmless dog. 
  Only when a scow became unmanageable, or hit the Dragon's Tooth,   or made the right-hand channel instead of the left, was there   tragedy. There was that delightful little note of laughter in   Marette's throat when Kent told her that. 
  &quot;You mean, Jeems, that if one of three possible things doesn't   happen, we'll get through safely?&quot; 
  &quot;None of them is possible&#8212;with us,&quot; he corrected himself quickly.   &quot;We've a tight little scow, we're not going to hit the rock, and   we'll make the left-hand channel so smoothly you won't know when  it  happens.&quot; He smiled at her with splendid confidence. &quot;I've been   through it a hundred times,&quot; he said. 
  He listened. Then, suddenly, he drew out his watch. It was a   quarter of four. Marette's ears caught what he heard. In the air  was  a low, trembling murmur. It was growing slowly but steadily.  He nodded  when she looked at him, the question in her eyes. 
  &quot;The rapids at the head of the Chute!&quot; he cried, his voice vibrant   with joy. &quot;We've beat them out. WE'RE SAFE!&quot; 
  They swung around a bend, and the white spume of the rapids lay   half a mile ahead of them. The current began to race with them  now.  Kent put his whole weight on the sweep to keep the scow in   mid-channel. 
  &quot;We're safe,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Do you understand, Marette? WE'RE   SAFE!&quot; 
  He was speaking the words for which she had waited, was telling   her that at last the hour had come when she could keep her promise  to  him. The words, as he gave them voice, thrilled him. He felt  like  shouting them. And then all at once he saw the change that  had come  into her face. Her wide, startled eyes were not looking  at him, but  beyond. She was looking back in the direction from  which they had  come, and even as he stared her face grew white. 
  &quot;LISTEN!&quot; 
  She was tense, rigid. He turned his head. And in that moment it   came to him above the growing murmur of the river&#8212;the PUTT, PUTT,   PUTT of the Police patrol boat from Athabasca Landing! 
  A deep breath came from between his lips. When Marette took her   eyes from the river and looked at him, his face was like carven  rock.  He was staring dead ahead. 
  &quot;We can't make the Chute,&quot; he said, his voice sounding hard and   unreal to her. &quot;If we do, they'll be up with us before we can land  at  the other end. We must let this current drive us ashore&#8212;NOW.&quot; 
  As he made his decision, he put the strength of his body into   action. He knew there was not the hundredth part of a second to  lose.  The outreaching suction of the rapids was already gripping  the scow,  and with mighty strokes he fought to work the head of  his craft toward  the westward shore. With swift understanding  Marette saw the priceless  value of a few seconds of time. If they  were caught in the stronger  swirl of the rapids before the shore  was reached, they would be forced  to run the Chute, and in that  event the launch would be upon them  before they could make a  landing farther on. She sprang to Kent's side  and added her own  strength in the working of the sweep. Foot by foot  and yard by  yard the scow made precious westing, and Kent's face  lighted up  with triumph as he nodded ahead to a timbered point that  thrust  itself out like a stubby thumb into the river. Beyond that  point  the rapids were frothing white, and they could see the first  black  walls of rock that marked the beginning of the Chute. 
  &quot;We'll make it,&quot; he smiled confidently. &quot;We'll hit that timbered   point close inshore. I don't see where the launch can make a  landing  anywhere within a mile of the Chute. And once ashore we'll  make trail  about five times as fast they can follow it.&quot; Marette's  face was no  longer pale, but flushed with excitement. He caught  the white gleam of  teeth between her parted lips. Her eyes shone  gloriously, and he  laughed. 
  &quot;You beautiful little fighter,&quot; he cried exultantly. &quot;You&#8212;you&#8212;&quot; 
  His words were cut short by a snap that was like the report of a   pistol close to his ears. He pitched forward and crashed to the   bottom of the scow, Marette's slim body clutched in his arms as he   fell. In a flash they were up, and mutely they stared where the  sweep  had been. The blade of it was gone. Kent was conscious of  hearing a  little cry from the girl at his side, and then her  fingers were  gripping tightly again about his thumb. No longer  possessed of the  power of guidance, the scow swung sideways. It  swept past the wooded  point. The white maelstrom of the lower  rapids seized upon it. And  Kent, looking ahead to the black maw of  the death-trap that was  waiting for them, drew Marette close in  his arms and held her tight.
