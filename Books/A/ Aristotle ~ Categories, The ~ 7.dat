Those things are called relative, which, being either said to be  of something else or related to something else, are explained by  reference to that other thing. For instance, the word 'superior'  is explained by reference to something else, for it is  superiority over something else that is meant. Similarly, the  expression 'double' has this external reference, for it is the  double of something else that is meant. So it is with everything  else of this kind. There are, moreover, other relatives, e.g.  habit, disposition, perception, knowledge, and attitude. The  significance of all these is explained by a reference to  something else and in no other way. Thus, a habit is a habit of  something, knowledge is knowledge of something, attitude is the  attitude of something. So it is with all other relatives that  have been mentioned. Those terms, then, are called relative, the  nature of which is explained by reference to something else, the  preposition 'of' or some other preposition being used to indicate  the relation. Thus, one mountain is called great in comparison  with son with another; for the mountain claims this attribute by  comparison with something. Again, that which is called similar  must be similar to something else, and all other such attributes  have this external reference. It is to be noted that lying and  standing and sitting are particular attitudes, but attitude is  itself a relative term. To lie, to stand, to be seated, are not  themselves attitudes, but take their name from the aforesaid  attitudes.    
It is possible for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has  a contrary, vice, these both being relatives; knowledge, too, has  a contrary, ignorance. But this is not the mark of all relatives;  'double' and 'triple' have no contrary, nor indeed has any such  term.    
It also appears that relatives can admit of variation of degree.  For 'like' and 'unlike', 'equal' and 'unequal', have the  modifications 'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of  these is relative in character: for the terms 'like' and  'unequal' bear 'unequal' bear a reference to something external.  Yet, again, it is not every relative term that admits of  variation of degree. No term such as 'double' admits of this  modification. All relatives have correlatives: by the term  'slave' we mean the slave of a master, by the term 'master', the  master of a slave; by 'double', the double of its hall; by  'half', the half of its double; by 'greater', greater than that  which is less; by 'less,' less than that which is greater.    
So it is with every other relative term; but the case we use to  express the correlation differs in some instances. Thus, by  knowledge we mean knowledge the knowable; by the knowable, that  which is to be apprehended by knowledge; by perception,  perception of the perceptible; by the perceptible, that which is  apprehended by perception.    
Sometimes, however, reciprocity of correlation does not appear to  exist. This comes about when a blunder is made, and that to which  the relative is related is not accurately stated. If a man states  that a wing is necessarily relative to a bird, the connexion  between these two will not be reciprocal, for it will not be  possible to say that a bird is a bird by reason of its wings. The  reason is that the original statement was inaccurate, for the  wing is not said to be relative to the bird qua bird, since many  creatures besides birds have wings, but qua winged creature. If,  then, the statement is made accurate, the connexion will be  reciprocal, for we can speak of a wing, having reference  necessarily to a winged creature, and of a winged creature as  being such because of its wings.    
Occasionally, perhaps, it is necessary to coin words, if no word  exists by which a correlation can adequately be explained. If we  define a rudder as necessarily having reference to a boat, our  definition will not be appropriate, for the rudder does not have  this reference to a boat qua boat, as there are boats which have  no rudders. Thus we cannot use the terms reciprocally, for the  word 'boat' cannot be said to find its explanation in the word  'rudder'. As there is no existing word, our definition would  perhaps be more accurate if we coined some word like 'ruddered'  as the correlative of 'rudder'. If we express ourselves thus  accurately, at any rate the terms are reciprocally connected, for  the 'ruddered' thing is 'ruddered' in virtue of its rudder. So it  is in all other cases. A head will be more accurately defined as  the correlative of that which is 'headed', than as that of an  animal, for the animal does not have a head qua animal, since  many animals have no head.    
Thus we may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a thing  is related, when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a  name, we derive a new name, and apply it to that with which the  first is reciprocally connected, as in the aforesaid instances,  when we derived the word 'winged' from 'wing' and from 'rudder'.    
All relatives, then, if properly defined, have a correlative. I  add this condition because, if that to which they are related is  stated as haphazard and not accurately, the two are not found to  be interdependent. Let me state what I mean more clearly. Even in  the case of acknowledged correlatives, and where names exist for  each, there will be no interdependence if one of the two is  denoted, not by that name which expresses the correlative notion,  but by one of irrelevant significance. The term 'slave,' if  defined as related, not to a master, but to a man, or a biped, or  anything of that sort, is not reciprocally connected with that in  relation to which it is defined, for the statement is not exact.  Further, if one thing is said to be correlative with another, and  the terminology used is correct, then, though all irrelevant  attributes should be removed, and only that one attribute left in  virtue of which it was correctly stated to be correlative with  that other, the stated correlation will still exist. If the  correlative of 'the slave' is said to be 'the master', then,  though all irrelevant attributes of the said 'master', such as  'biped', 'receptive of knowledge', 'human', should be removed,  and the attribute 'master' alone left, the stated correlation  existing between him and the slave will remain the same, for it  is of a master that a slave is said to be the slave. On the other  hand, if, of two correlatives, one is not correctly termed, then,  when all other attributes are removed and that alone is left in  virtue of which it was stated to be correlative, the stated  correlation will be found to have disappeared.    
For suppose the correlative of 'the slave' should be said to be  'the man', or the correlative of 'the wing"the bird'; if the  attribute 'master' be withdrawn from' the man', the correlation  between 'the man' and 'the slave' will cease to exist, for if the  man is not a master, the slave is not a slave. Similarly, if the  attribute 'winged' be withdrawn from 'the bird', 'the wing' will  no longer be relative; for if the so-called correlative is not  winged, it follows that 'the wing' has no correlative.    
Thus it is essential that the correlated terms should be exactly  designated; if there is a name existing, the statement will be  easy; if not, it is doubtless our duty to construct names. When  the terminology is thus correct, it is evident that all  correlatives are interdependent.    
Correlatives are thought to come into existence simultaneously.  This is for the most part true, as in the case of the double and  the half. The existence of the half necessitates the existence of  that of which it is a half. Similarly the existence of a master  necessitates the existence of a slave, and that of a slave  implies that of a master; these are merely instances of a general  rule. Moreover, they cancel one another; for if there is no  double it follows that there is no half, and vice versa; this  rule also applies to all such correlatives. Yet it does not  appear to be true in all cases that correlatives come into  existence simultaneously. The object of knowledge would appear to  exist before knowledge itself, for it is usually the case that we  acquire knowledge of objects already existing; it would be  difficult, if not impossible, to find a branch of knowledge the  beginning of the existence of which was contemporaneous with that  of its object.    
Again, while the object of knowledge, if it ceases to exist,  cancels at the same time the knowledge which was its correlative,  the converse of this is not true. It is true that if the object  of knowledge does not exist there can be no knowledge: for there  will no longer be anything to know. Yet it is equally true that,  if knowledge of a certain object does not exist, the object may  nevertheless quite well exist. Thus, in the case of the squaring  of the circle, if indeed that process is an object of knowledge,  though it itself exists as an object of knowledge, yet the  knowledge of it has not yet come into existence. Again, if all  animals ceased to exist, there would be no knowledge, but there  might yet be many objects of knowledge.    
This is likewise the case with regard to perception: for the  object of perception is, it appears, prior to the act of  perception. If the perceptible is annihilated, perception also  will cease to exist; but the annihilation of perception does not  cancel the existence of the perceptible. For perception implies a  body perceived and a body in which perception takes place. Now if  that which is perceptible is annihilated, it follows that the  body is annihilated, for the body is a perceptible thing; and if  the body does not exist, it follows that perception also ceases  to exist. Thus the annihilation of the perceptible involves that  of perception.    
But the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the  perceptible. For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that  perception also is annihilated, but perceptibles such as body,  heat, sweetness, bitterness, and so on, will remain.    
Again, perception is generated at the same time as the perceiving  subject, for it comes into existence at the same time as the  animal. But the perceptible surely exists before perception; for  fire and water and such elements, out of which the animal is  itself composed, exist before the animal is an animal at all, and  before perception. Thus it would seem that the perceptible exists  before perception.    
It may be questioned whether it is true that no substance is  relative, as seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be  made in the case of certain secondary substances. With regard to  primary substances, it is quite true that there is no such  possibility, for neither wholes nor parts of primary substances  are relative. The individual man or ox is not defined with  reference to something external. Similarly with the parts: a  particular hand or head is not defined as a particular hand or  head of a particular person, but as the hand or head of a  particular person. It is true also, for the most part at least,  in the case of secondary substances; the species 'man' and the  species 'ox' are not defined with reference to anything outside  themselves. Wood, again, is only relative in so far as it is some  one's property, not in so far as it is wood. It is plain, then,  that in the cases mentioned substance is not relative. But with  regard to some secondary substances there is a difference of  opinion; thus, such terms as 'head' and 'hand' are defined with  reference to that of which the things indicated are a part, and  so it comes about that these appear to have a relative character.  Indeed, if our definition of that which is relative was complete,  it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove that no  substance is relative. If, however, our definition was not  complete, if those things only are properly called relative in  the case of which relation to an external object is a necessary  condition of existence, perhaps some explanation of the dilemma  may be found.    
The former definition does indeed apply to all relatives, but the  fact that a thing is explained with reference to something else  does not make it essentially relative.    
From this it is plain that, if a man definitely apprehends a  relative thing, he will also definitely apprehend that to which  it is relative. Indeed this is self-evident: for if a man knows  that some particular thing is relative, assuming that we call  that a relative in the case of which relation to something is a  necessary condition of existence, he knows that also to which it  is related. For if he does not know at all that to which it is  related, he will not know whether or not it is relative. This is  clear, moreover, in particular instances. If a man knows  definitely that such and such a thing is 'double', he will also  forthwith know definitely that of which it is the double. For if  there is nothing definite of which he knows it to be the double,  he does not know at all that it is double. Again, if he knows  that a thing is more beautiful, it follows necessarily that he  will forthwith definitely know that also than which it is more  beautiful. He will not merely know indefinitely that it is more  beautiful than something which is less beautiful, for this would  be supposition, not knowledge. For if he does not know definitely  that than which it is more beautiful, he can no longer claim to  know definitely that it is more beautiful than something else  which is less beautiful: for it might be that nothing was less  beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man apprehends  some relative thing definitely, he necessarily knows that also  definitely to which it is related.    
Now the head, the hand, and such things are substances, and it is  possible to know their essential character definitely, but it  does not necessarily follow that we should know that to which  they are related. It is not possible to know forthwith whose head  or hand is meant. Thus these are not relatives, and, this being  the case, it would be true to say that no substance is relative  in character. It is perhaps a difficult matter, in such cases, to  make a positive statement without more exhaustive examination,  but to have raised questions with regard to details is not  without advantage.
