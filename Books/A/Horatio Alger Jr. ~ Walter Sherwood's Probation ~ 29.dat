  &quot;You can look at the pistol as I hold it,&quot; said Walter, in response  to  the request recorded at the close of the preceding chapter. 
  &quot;I say,&quot; remarked the stranger suddenly, &quot;don't you want to buy a   horse?&quot; 
  &quot;How much do you ask for the horse?&quot; he inquired. 
  &quot;I want to get her off my hands. Give me fifty dollars, and she's   yours.&quot; 
  Walter had a pad in his satchel and a fountain pen in his pocket.  He  hastily wrote out the following form: 
  &quot;In consideration of fifty dollars by me received, I give and  transfer  to Walter Sherwood my roan horse.&quot; Here followed a brief  description  of the animal. 
  &quot;Now put your name there, and I will hand you the money,&quot; said  Walter. 
  &quot;Thank you, stranger! You've got a good bargain.&quot; 
  &quot;I agree to that,&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;I suppose the horse is sound?&quot; he said inquiringly. 
  &quot;Sound as a die! Don't you take no trouble about that. It goes to  my  heart to give her up. Good-by, old gal!&quot; 
  Walter touched the horse lightly with his whip, and she bounded   forward. After a few miles he reached a town of good size. Riding   along the main street his attention was drawn to a printed notice in   front of a store. It read thus: 
  &quot;HORSE STOLEN! 
  &quot;Stolen from the subscriber, on the evening of the twenty-fifth, a   roan mare, eight years old and sixteen hands high, with a white mark   between the eyes. Answers to the name of Bess. Whoever will return her   to the subscriber, or give information that will lead to her recovery,   will receive a suitable reward. 
  &quot;COLONEL RICHARD OWEN, Shelby.&quot; 
  A terrible suspicion entered Walter's mind. He recognized the white   mark. Then he called &quot;Bess.&quot; The mare half turned her head and   whinnied.
