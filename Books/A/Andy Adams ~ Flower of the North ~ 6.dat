  Scarce had he spoken when he would have given much to have   recalled his words, wrung from his lips by that sobbing note of   loneliness, of defiance, of half pain in the girl's voice. It was  the  same note, the same spirit crying out against his world that  he had  listened to in the moaning of the surf as it labored to  carry away the  dead, and in the wind that sighed in the spruce-  tops below the  mountain, only now it was the spirit speaking  through a human voice.  Every fiber in his body vibrated in  response to it, and he stood with  bared head, filled with a wild  desire to make these people understand,  and yet startled at the  effect which his appearance had produced. 
  The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear. Quicker   than her own was the movement of the half-breed. In a flash he was   upon his feet, his dark face tense with action, his right hand   gripping at something in his belt as he bent toward the figure in  the  center of the rock. His posture was that of an animal ready to  spring.  Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.  The girl  leaned over and twisted her fingers in the tawny hair  that bristled on  the dog's neck. Philip heard her speak, but she  did not move her eyes  from his face. It was the tableau of a  moment, tense, breathless. The  only thing that moved was the  shimmer of steel. Philip caught the  gleam of it under the half-  breed's hand. 
  &quot;Don't do that, M'sieur,&quot; he said, pointing at the other's belt.   &quot;I am sorry that I disturbed you. Sometimes I come up here&#8212;alone   &#8212;to smoke my pipe and listen to the sea down there. I heard you  say  that you hate Churchill, and I hate it. That is why I spoke.&quot; 
  He turned to the girl. 
  &quot;I am sorry. I beg your pardon.&quot; 
  He looked at her with new wonderment. She had tossed back her   loose hair, and stood tall and straight in the moonlight, her dark   eyes gazing at him now calmly and without affright. She was  dressed  in rich yellow buckskin, as soft as chamois. Her throat  was bare. A  deep collar of lace fell over her shoulders. One hand,  raised to her  breast, revealed a wide gauntlet cuff of red or  purple plush, of a  fashion two centuries old. Her lips were  parted, and he saw the  faintest gleam of her white teeth, the  quick rising and falling of her  bosom. He had spoken directly to  her, yet she gave no sign of having  heard him. 
  &quot;You startled us, that is all, M'sieur,&quot; said Pierre, quietly. His   English was excellent, and as he spoke he bowed low to Philip. &quot;It  is  I whom you must pardon, M'sieur&#8212;for betraying so much  caution.&quot; 
  Philip held out his hand. 
  &quot;My name is Whittemore&#8212;Philip Whittemore,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm staying   at Churchill until the ship comes in and&#8212;and I hope you'll let me   sit here on the rock.&quot; 
  For an instant Pierre's fingers gripped his hand, and he bowed low   again like a courtier. Philip saw that he, too, wore the same big,   old-fashioned cuffs, and that it was not a knife that hung at his   belt, but a short rapier. 
  &quot;And I am Pierre&#8212;Pierre Couchee,&quot; he said. &quot;And this&#8212;is my   sister&#8212;Jeanne. We do not belong to Fort Churchill, but come from   Fort o' God. Good night, M'sieur!&quot; 
  The girl had taken a step back, and now she swept him a courtesy   so low that her fallen hair streamed over her shoulders. She spoke  no  word, but passed quickly with Pierre up the rock, and while  Philip  stood stunned and speechless they disappeared swiftly into  the white  gloom of the night. 
  Mutely he gazed after them. For a long time he stood staring   beyond the rocks, marveling at the strangeness of this thing that  had  happened. An hour before he had stood with bared head over the  ancient  dead at Churchill, and now, on the rock, he had seen the  resurrection  of what he had dreamed those dead to be in life. He  had never seen  people like Pierre and Jeanne. Their strange dress,  the rapier at  Pierre's side, his courtly bow, the low, graceful  courtesy that the  girl had made him, all carried him back to the  days of the old  pictures that hung in the factor's room at  Churchill, when  high-blooded gallants came into the wilderness  with their swords at  their sides, wearing the favors of court  ladies next their hearts.  Pierre, standing there on the rock, with  his hand on his rapier, might  have been Grosellier himself, the  prince's favorite, and Jeanne&#8212; 
  Something white on the rock near where the girl had been sitting   caught Philip's eyes. In a moment he held in his fingers a small   handkerchief and a broad ribbon of finely knit lace. In her haste  to  get away she had forgotten these things. He was about to run to  the  crest of the cliff and call loudly for Pierre Couchee when he  held the  handkerchief and the lace close to his face and the  delicate perfume  of heliotrope stopped him. There was something  familiar about it,  something that held him wondering and  mystified, until he knew that he  had lost the opportunity to  recall Pierre and his companion. He looked  at the handkerchief  more, closely. It was a dainty fabric, so soft  that it gave barely  the sensation of touch when he crushed it in the  palm of his hand.  For a few moments he was puzzled to account for the  filmy strip of  lace. Then the truth came to him. Jeanne had used it to  bind her  hair! 
  He laughed softly, joyously, as he wound the bit of fabric about   his fingers and retraced his steps toward Churchill. Again and  again  he pressed the tiny handkerchief to his face, breathing of  its  sweetness; and the action suddenly stirred his memory to the  solution  of its mystery. It was this same sweetness that had come  to him on the  night that he had looked down into the beautiful  face of Eileen Brokaw  at the Brokaw ball. He remembered now that  Eileen Brokaw loved  heliotrope, and that she always wore a purple  heliotrope at her white  throat or in the gold of her hair. For a  moment it struck him as  singular that so many things had happened  this day to remind him of  Brokaw's daughter. The thought hastened  his steps. He was anxious to  look at the picture again, to  convince himself that he had been  mistaken. Gregson was asleep  when he re-entered the cabin. The light  was burning low, and  Philip turned up the wick. On the table was the  picture as Gregson  had left it. This time there was no doubt. He had  drawn the face  of Eileen Brokaw. In a spirit of jest he had written  under it,  &quot;The Wife of Lord Fitzhugh.&quot; 
  In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.   Was it possible that Miss Brokaw had reached Fort Churchill in  some  other way than by ship? And, if not, was it possible that in  this  remote corner of the earth there was another woman who  resembled her  so closely? Philip took a step toward Gregson, half  determined to  awaken him. And yet, on second thought, he knew that  Gregson could not  explain. Even if the artist had learned of his  affair with Miss Brokaw  and had secured a picture of her in some  way, he would not presume to  go this far. He was convinced that  Gregson had drawn the picture of a  face that he had seen that day.  Again he read the words at the bottom  of the sketch, and once more  he experienced their curious effect upon  him&#8212;an effect which it  was impossible for him to analyze even in his  own mind. 
  He replaced the picture upon the table and drew the handkerchief   and bit of lace from his pocket. In the light of the lamp he saw  that  both were as unusual as had been the picturesque dress of the  girl and  her companion. Even to his inexperienced eyes and touch  they gave  evidence of a richness that puzzled him, of a fashion  that he had  never seen. They were of exquisite workmanship. The  lace was of a  delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.  The handkerchief was  in the shape of a heart, and in one corner of  it, so finely wrought  that he could barely make out the silken  letters, was the word  &quot;Camille.&quot; 
  The scent of heliotrope rose more strongly in the closed room, and   from the handkerchief Philip's eyes turned to the face of Eileen   Brokaw looking at him from out of Gregson's sketch. It was a  curious  coincidence. He reached over and placed the picture face  down. Then he  loaded his pipe, and sat smoking, his vision  traveling beyond the  table, beyond the closed door to the lonely  black rock where he had  come upon Jeanne and Pierre. Clouds of  smoke rose about him, and he  half closed his eyes. He saw the girl  again, as she stood there; he  saw the moonlight shining in her  hair, the dark, startled beauty of  her eyes as she turned upon  him; he heard again the low sobbing note  in her voice as she cried  out her hatred against Churchill. He forgot  Eileen Brokaw now,  forgot in these moments all that he and Gregson had  talked of that  day. His schemes, his fears, his feverish eagerness to  begin the  fight against his enemies died away in thoughts of the  beautiful  girl who had come into his life this night. It seemed to him  now  that he had known her for a long time, that she had been a part of   him always, and that it was her spirit that he had been groping  and  searching for, and could never find. For the space of those  few  moments on the cliff she had driven out the emptiness and the   loneliness from his heart, and there filled him a wild desire to  make  her understand, to talk with her, to stand shoulder to  shoulder with  Pierre out there in the night, a comrade. 
  Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief. He   turned and looked steadily at Gregson. His friend was sleeping,  with  his face to the wall. 
  Would not Pierre return to the rock in search of these articles   which his sister had left behind? The thought set his blood  tingling.  He would go back&#8212;and wait for Pierre. But if Pierre did  not  return&#8212;until to-morrow? 
  He laughed softly to himself as he drew paper toward him and   picked up the pencil which Gregson had used. For many minutes he   wrote steadily. When he had done, he folded what he had written  and  tied it in the handkerchief. The strip of lace with which  Jeanne had  bound her hair he folded gently and placed in his  breast pocket. There  was a guilty flush in his face as he stole  silently to the door. What  would Gregson say if he knew that he&#8212;  Phil Whittemore, the man whom  he had once idealized as &quot;The  Fighter,&quot; and whom he believed to be  proof against all love of  woman&#8212;was doing this thing? He opened and  closed the door softly. 
  At least he would send his message to these strange people of the   wilderness. They would know that he was not a part of that  Churchill  which they hated, that in his heart he had ceased to be  a thing of its  breed. He apologized again for his sudden  appearance on the rock, but  the apology was only an excuse for  other things which he wrote, in  which for a few brief moments he  bared himself to those whom he knew  would understand, and asked  that their acquaintance might be  continued. He felt that there was  something almost boyish in what he  was doing; and yet, as he  hurried over the ridge and down into  Churchill again, he was  thrilled as no other adventure had ever  thrilled him before. As he  approached the cliff he began to fear that  the half-breed would  not return for the things which Jeanne had left,  or that he had  already re-visited the rock. The latter thought urged  him on until  he was half running. The crest of the cliff was bare when  he  reached it. He looked at his watch. He had been gone an hour. 
  Where the moonlight seemed to fall brightest he dropped the   handkerchief, and then slipped back into the rocky trail that led  to  the edge of the Bay. He had scarcely reached the strip of level  beach  that lay between him and Churchill when from far behind him  there came  the long howl of a dog. It was the wolf-dog. He knew it  by the slow,  dismal rising of the cry and the infinite sadness  with which it as  slowly died away until lost in the whisperings of  the forest and the  gentle wash of the sea. Pierre was returning.  He was coming back  through the forest. Perhaps Jeanne would be  with him. 
  For the third time Philip climbed back to the great moonlit rock   at the top of the cliff. Eagerly he faced the north, whence the   wailing cry of the wolf-dog had come. Then he turned to the spot   where he had dropped the handkerchief, and his heart gave a sudden   jump. 
  There was nothing on the rock. The handkerchief was gone!
