  Fairfax paused at Andy's threat. He was only a boy, it is true, but  he looked cool and resolute, and the gun, which was pointed at him,  looked positively dangerous. But was he to be thwarted in the very  moment of his triumph, by a boy? He could not endure it.
  &#8220;Young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is dangerous business for you. If you  don't make yourself scarce, you won't be likely to return at all.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll take the risk,&#8221; said Andy, coolly.
  &#8220;Confound him! I thought he'd be frightened,&#8221; said Fairfax to  himself.
  &#8220;I don't want to kill you,&#8221; he said, with a further attempt to  intimidate Andy.
  &#8220;I don't mean to let you,&#8221; said our hero, quietly.
  &#8220;You are no match for me.&#8221;
  &#8220;With a gun I am.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't believe it is loaded.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you try to pick up that pistol, I'll convince you; by the  powers, I will,&#8221; said Andy, energetically.
  &#8220;What is to prevent my taking away the gun from you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Faith,&#8221; returned Andy, quaintly, &#8220;you'll take the powder and ball  first, I'm thinkin'.&#8221;
  Fairfax thought so, too, and that was one reason why he concluded  not to try it.
  It was certainly a provoking position for him.
  There lay the pistol on the ground, just at his feet; yet, if he  tried to pick it up, the boy would put a bullet through him. It was  furthermore provoking to reflect that, had he not stopped to parley  with Colonel Preston, he might have secured the money, which he so much  desired, before Andy had come up. There was one other resource. He had  tried bullying, and without success. He would try cajoling and  temptation.
  &#8220;Look here, boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am a desperate man. I would as leave  murder you as not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;But I'd rather not have it done.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want to hurt you, as I said before, but you mustn't  interfere with me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you mustn't interfere with the colonel.&#8221;
  &#8220;I must have the money in his pocketbook.&#8221;
  &#8220;Must you? Maybe, I'll have something to say, to that.&#8221;
  &#8220;He has eight hundred dollars with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did he tell you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No matter; I know. If you won't interfere with me, I'll give you  two hundred of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you for nothing, then,&#8221; said Andy, independently. &#8220;I'm only a  poor Irish boy, but I ain't a thafe, and never mane to be.&#8221;
  &#8220;Bravo, Andy!&#8221; said Colonel Preston, who had awaited with a little  anxiety the result of the offer.
  Fairfax stooped suddenly, but before he could get hold of the  pistol, Andy struck him on the head with the gun-barrel, causing him to  roll over, while, in a quick and adroit movement, he himself got hold  of the pistol before Fairfax had recovered from the crack on his head.
  &#8220;Now,&#8221; said Andy, triumphantly, with the gun over his shoulder, and  presenting the pistol, &#8220;lave here mighty quick, or I'll shoot ye.&#8221;
  &#8220;Give me back the pistol, then,&#8221; said the discomfited ruffian.
  &#8220;I guess not,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;It's my property.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know that. Maybe you took it from some thraveler.&#8221;
  &#8220;Give it to me, and I'll go off peaceably.&#8221;
  &#8220;I won't take no robber's word,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;Are you goin'?&#8221;
  &#8220;Give me the pistol. Fire it off, if you like.&#8221;
  &#8220;That you may load it again. You don't catch a weasel asleep,&#8221;  answered Andy, shrewdly. &#8220;I've a great mind to make you march into the  village, and give you up to the perlice.&#8221;
  This suggestion was by no means pleasant for the highwayman,  particularly as he reflected that Andy had shown himself a resolute  boy, and doubly armed as he now was, it was quite within his power to  carry out his threat.
  &#8220;Don't fire after me,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I never attack an inimy in the rare,&#8221; said Andy, who always  indulged in the brogue more than usual under exciting circumstances.
  I make this explanation, as the reader may have noticed a difference  in his dialect at different times.
  &#8220;We shall meet again, boy!&#8221; said Fairfax, menacingly, turning at the  distance of a few feet.
  &#8220;Thank you, sir. You needn't thrubble yourself,&#8221; said Andy, &#8220;I ain't  anxious to mate you.&#8221;
  &#8220;When we do meet, you'll know it,&#8221; said the other.
  &#8220;Maybe I will. Go along wid ye!&#8221; said Andy, pointing the pistol at  him.
  &#8220;Don't shoot,&#8221; said Fairfax, hastily, and he quickened his pace to  get out of the way of a dangerous companion.
  Andy laughed as the highwayman disappeared in the distance.
  &#8220;I thought he wouldn't wait long,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Andy,&#8221; said Colonel Preston, warmly, &#8220;you have behaved like a  hero.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm only an Irish boy,&#8221; said Andy, laughing. &#8220;Shure, they don't  make heroes of such as I.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't care whether you are Irish or Dutch. You are a hero for all  that.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shure, sir, it's lucky I was round whin that spalpeen wanted to rob  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;How did you happen to be out with a gun this afternoon?&#8221;
  &#8220;I got my work all done, and Miss Grant said I might go out shootin'  if I wanted. Shure, I didn't expect it 'ud been robbers I would be  afther shootin'.&#8221;
  &#8220;You came up just in the nick of time. Weren't you afraid?&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't stop to think of that when I saw that big blackguard  p'intin' his pistol at you. I thought I'd have a hand in it myself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Jump into the chaise, Andy, and ride home with me.&#8221;
  &#8220;What, wid the gun?&#8221;
  &#8220;To be sure. We won't leave the gun. That has done us too good  service already to-day.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've made something out of it, anyway,&#8221; said Andy, displaying the  pistol, which was silver-mounted, and altogether a very pretty weapon.  &#8220;It's a regular beauty,&#8221; he said, with admiration.
  &#8220;It will be better in your hands than in the real owner's,&#8221; said  Colonel Preston.
  By this time Andy was in the chaise, rapidly nearing the village.
  &#8220;If you hadn't come up just as you did, Andy, I should have been  poorer by eight hundred dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a big pile of money,&#8221; said Andy, who, as we know, was not in  the habit of having large sums of money in his own possession.
  &#8220;It is considerably more than I would like to lose,&#8221; said Colonel  Preston, to whom it was of less importance than to Andy.
  &#8220;I wonder will I ever have so much money?&#8221; thought Andy.
  &#8220;Now, I'll tell you what I think it only right to do, Andy,&#8221; pursued  the colonel.
  Andy listened attentively.
  &#8220;I am going to make you a present of some money, as an  acknowledgment of the service you have done me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want anything, Colonel Preston,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;I didn't help  you for the money.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know you didn't, my lad,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;but I mean to give  it to you all the same.&#8221;
  He took out his pocketbook, but Andy made one more remonstrance.
  &#8220;I don't think I ought to take it, sir, thankin' you all the same.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will give you one hundred dollars for your mother. You can't  refuse it for her.&#8221;
  Andy's eyes danced with delight. He knew how much good this money  would do his mother, and relieve her from the necessity of working so  hard as she was now compelled to do.
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It'll make my mother's heart glad, and  save her from the hard work.&#8221;
  &#8220;Here is the money, Andy,&#8221; said the colonel, handing his young  companion a roll of bills.
  Again Andy poured out warm protestations of gratitude for the  munificent gift, with which Colonel Preston was well pleased.
  &#8220;I believe you are a good boy, Andy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a good sign  when a boy thinks so much of his mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd be ashamed not to, sir,&#8221; said Andy.
  They soon reached the village. Andy got down at the Misses Grant's  gate, and was soon astonishing the simple ladies by a narrative of his  encounter with the highwayman.
  &#8220;Do you think he'll come here?&#8221; asked Sophia, in alarm. &#8220;If he  should come when Andy was away&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;You could fire the gun yourself, Sophia.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should be frightened to death.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then he couldn't kill you afterward.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so,&#8221; answered Sophia, a little bewildered.
  &#8220;Were you shot, Andrew?&#8221; she asked, a minute afterward.
  &#8220;If I was, I didn't feel it,&#8221; said Andy, jocosely.
  Andy's heroic achievement made him still more valued by the Misses  Grant, and they rejoiced in the handsome gift he had received from the  colonel, and readily gave him permission to carry it to his mother  after supper.
