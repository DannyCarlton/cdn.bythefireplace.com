   &#8220;You have the keenest eyes in the troop. Can you see anything  ahead?&#8221; asked Colonel Winchester.
  &#8220;Nothing living, sir,&#8221; replied Dick Mason, as he swept his powerful  glasses in a half-curve. &#8220;There are hills on the right and in the  center, covered with thick, green forest, and on the left, where the  land lies low, the forest is thick and green too, although I think I  catch a flash of water in it.&#8221;
  &#8220;That should be the little river of which our map tells. And you,  Warner, what do your eyes tell you?&#8221;
  &#8220;The same tale they tell to Dick, sir. It looks to me like a  wilderness.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so it is. It's a low-lying region of vast forests and thickets,  of slow deep rivers and creeks, and of lagoons and bayous. If Northern  troops want to be ambushed they couldn't come to a finer place for it.  Forrest and five thousand of his wild riders might hide within rifle  shot of us in this endless mass of vegetation. And so, my lads, it  behooves us to be cautious with a very great caution. You will recall  how we got cut up by Forrest in the Shiloh time.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do, sir,&#8221; said Dick and he shuddered as he recalled those  terrible moments. &#8220;This is Mississippi, isn't it?&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester took a small map from his pocket, and, unfolding  it, examined it with minute care.
  &#8220;If this is right, and I'm sure it is,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;we're far down  in Mississippi in the sunken regions that border the sluggish  tributaries of the Father of Waters. The vegetation is magnificent, but  for a home give me higher ground, Dick.&#8221;
  &#8220;Me too, sir,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;The finest state in this Union is  Vermont. I like to live on firm soil, even if it isn't so fertile, and  I like to see the clear, pure water running everywhere, brooks and  rivers.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll admit that Vermont is a good state for two months in the  year,&#8221; said Dick.
  &#8220;Why not the other ten?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because then it's frozen up, solid and hard, so I've heard.&#8221;
  The other boys laughed and kept up their chaff, but Colonel  Winchester rode soberly ahead. Behind him trailed the Winchester  regiment, now reorganized and mounted. Fresh troops had come from  Kentucky, and fragments of old regiments practically destroyed at  Perryville and Stone River had been joined to it.
  It was a splendid body of men, but of those who had gone to Shiloh  only about two hundred remained. The great conflicts of the West, and  the minor battles had accounted for the others. But it was perhaps one  of the reliefs of the Civil War that it gave the lads who fought it  little time to think of those who fell. Four years crowded with  battles, great and small, sieges and marches absorbed their whole  attention.
  Now two men, the dreaded Forrest and fierce little Joe Wheeler,  occupied the minds of Winchester and his officers. It was impossible to  keep track of these wild horsemen here in their own section. They had a  habit of appearing two or three hundred miles from the place at which  they were expected.
  But the young lieutenants while they watched too for their  redoubtable foes had an eye also for the country. It was a new kind of  region for all of them. The feet of their horses sank deep in the soft  black soil, and there was often a sound of many splashings as the  regiment rode across a wide, muddy brook.
  Dick noted with interest the magnolias and the live oaks, and the  great stalks of the sunflower. Here in this Southern state, which  bathed its feet in the warm waters of the Gulf, spring was already far  along, although snows still lingered in the North.
  The vegetation was extravagant in its luxuriance and splendor. The  enormous forest was broken by openings like prairies, and in every one  of them the grass grew thick and tall, interspersed with sunflowers and  blossoming wild plants. Through the woods ran vast networks of vines,  and birds of brilliant plumage chattered in the trees. Twice, deer  sprang up before them and raced away in the forest. It was the  wilderness almost as De Soto had traversed it nearly four centuries  before, and it had a majesty which in its wildness was not without its  sinister note.
  They approached a creek, deeper and wider than usual, flowing in  slow, yellow coils, and, as they descended into the marsh that enclosed  its waters, there was a sharp crackling sound, followed quickly by  another and then by many others. The reports did not cease, and,  although blood was shed freely, no man fell from his horse, nor was any  wounded mortally. But the assault was vicious and it was pushed home  with the utmost courage and tenacity, although many of the assailants  fell never to rise again. Cries of pain and anger, and imprecations  arose from the stricken regiment.
  &#8220;Slap! Slap!&#8221;
  &#8220;Bang! Bang!&#8221;
  &#8220;Ouch! He's got his bayonet in my cheek!&#8221;
  &#8220;Heavens, that struck me like a minie ball! And it came, whistling  and shrieking, too, just like one!&#8221;
  &#8220;Phew, how they sting! and my neck is bleeding in three places!&#8221;
  &#8220;By thunder, Bill, I hit that fellow, fair and square! He'll never  trouble an honest Yankee soldier again!&#8221;
  The fierce buzzing increased all around them and Colonel Winchester  shouted to his trumpeter:
  &#8220;Blow the charge at once!&#8221;
  The man, full willing, put the trumpet to his lips and blew loud and  long. The whole regiment went across the creek at a gallop&#8212;the water  flying in yellow showers&#8212;and did not stop until, emerging from the  marsh, they reached the crest of a low hill a mile beyond. Here, stung,  bleeding and completely defeated by the enemy they stopped for repairs.  An occasional angry buzz showed that they were not yet safe from the  skirmishers, but their attack seemed a light matter after the full  assault of the determined foe.
  &#8220;I suppose we're all wounded,&#8221; said Dick as he wiped a bleeding  cheek. &#8220;At least as far as I can see they're hurt. The last fellow who  got his bayonet in my face turned his weapon around and around and sang  merrily at every revolution.&#8221;
  &#8220;We were afraid of being ambushed by Forrest,&#8221; said Warner, speaking  from a swollen countenance. &#8220;Instead we struck something worse; we rode  straight into an ambush of ten billion high-powered mosquitoes, every  one tipped with fire. Have we got enemies like these to fight all the  way down here?&#8221;
  &#8220;They sting the rebels, too,&#8221; said Pennington.
  &#8220;Yes, but they like newcomers best, the unacclimated. When we rode  down into that swamp I could hear them shouting, to one another: 'That  fat fellow is mine, I saw him first! I've marked the rosy-cheeked boy  for mine. Keep away the rest of you fellows!' I feel as if I'd been  through a battle. No more marshes for me.&#8221;
  Some of the provident produced bottles of oil of pennyroyal.  Sergeant Daniel Whitley, who rode a giant bay horse, was one of the  most foreseeing in this respect, and, after the boys had used his  soothing liniment freely, the fiery torment left by the mosquito's  sting passed away.
  The sergeant seemed to have grown bigger and broader than ever. His  shoulders were about to swell through his faded blue coat, and the hand  resting easily on the rein had the grip and power of a bear's paw. His  rugged face had been tanned by the sun of the far south to the color of  an Indian's. He was formidable to a foe, and yet no gentler heart beat  than that under his old blue uniform. Secretly he regarded the young  lieutenants, his superiors in military rank and education, as brave  children, and often he cared for them where his knowledge and skill  were greater than theirs or even than that of colonels and generals.
  &#8220;God bless you, Sergeant,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;you don't look like an angel,  but you are one&#8212;that is, of the double-fisted, fighting type.&#8221;
  The sergeant merely smiled and replaced the bottle carefully in his  pocket, knowing that they would have good use for it again.
  The regiment after salving its wounds resumed its watchful march.
  &#8220;Do you know where we're going?&#8221; Pennington asked Dick.
  &#8220;I think we're likely if we live long enough to land in the end  before Vicksburg, the great Southern fortress, but as I gather it we  mean to curve and curl and twist about a lot before then. Grant, they  say, intends to close in on Vicksburg, while Rosecrans farther north is  watching Bragg at Chattanooga. We're a flying column, gathering up  information, and ready for anything.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's funny,&#8221; said Warner thoughtfully, &#8220;that we've already got so  far south in the western field. We can't be more than two or three  hundred miles from the Gulf. Besides, we've already taken New Orleans,  the biggest city of the South, and our fleet is coming up the river to  meet us. Yet in the East we don't seem to make any progress at all. We  lose great battles there and Fredericksburg they say was just a  slaughter of our men. How do you make it out, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've thought of several reasons for it. Our generals in the West  are better than our generals in the East, or their generals in the East  are better than their generals in the West. And then there are the  rivers. In the East they mostly run eastward between the two armies,  and they are no help to us, but a hindrance rather. Here in the West  the rivers, and they are many and great, mostly run southward, the way  we want to go, and they bring our gunboats on their bosoms. Excuse my  poetry, but it's what I mean.&#8221;
  &#8220;You must be right. I think that all the reasons you give apply  together. But our command of the water has surely been a tremendous  help. And then we've got to remember, Dick, that there was never a navy  like ours. It goes everywhere and it does everything. Why, if Admiral  Farragut should tell one of those gunboats to steam across the  Mississippi bottoms it would turn its saucy nose, steer right out of  the water into the mud, and blow up with all hands aboard before it  quit trying.&#8221;
  &#8220;You two fellows talk too much,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;You won't let  President Lincoln and Grant and Halleck manage the war, but you want to  run it yourselves.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want to run anything just now, Frank,&#8221; rejoined Dick. &#8220;What  I'm thinking about most is rest and something to eat. I'd like to get  rid, too, of about ten pounds of Mississippi mud that I'm carrying.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, I can catch a glint of white pillars through those trees. It  means the 'big house' of a plantation, and you'll probably find  somewhere back of it the long rows of cabins, inhabited by the dark  people, whom we've come to raise to the level of their masters, if not  above them. I can see right now the joyous welcome we'll receive from  the owners of the big house. They'll be standing on the great piazza,  waving Union flags and shouting to us that they have ready cooling  drinks and luxurious food for us all.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's hardly a joke to me. Whatever the cause of the war, it's the  bitterness of death for these people to be overrun. Besides, I remember  the words of that old fellow in the blacksmith shop before we fought  the battle of Stone River. He said that even if they were beaten they'd  still be there holding the land and running things.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;I've been wondering how this war would  end, and now I'm wondering what will happen after it does end. But here  we are at the gate. What big grounds! These great planters certainly  had space!&#8221;
  &#8220;And what silence!&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;It's uncanny, George. A place like  this must have had a thousand slaves, and I don't see any of them  rushing forward to welcome their liberators.&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably contraband, gone long ago to Ben Butler at New Orleans. I  don't believe there's a soul here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Remember that lone house in Tennessee where a slip of a girl  brought Forrest down on us and had us cut pretty nearly to pieces.&#8221;
  &#8220;I couldn't forget it.&#8221;
  Nor could Colonel Winchester. The house, large and low, stood in  grounds covering an area of several acres, enclosed by a paling fence,  now sagging in many places. Great stone posts stood on either side of  the gateway, but the gate was opened, and it, too, sagged.
  The grounds had evidently been magnificent, both with flowers and  forest trees. Already many of the flowers were blooming in great  luxuriance and brilliancy, but the walks and borders were untrimmed.  The house was of wood, painted white with green shutters, and as they  drew nearer they appreciated its great size, although it was only two  stories in height. A hundred persons could have slept there, and twice  as many could have found shade in the wide piazzas which stretched the  full length of the four sides.
  But all the doors and shutters were closed and no smoke rose from  any chimney. They caught a glimpse of the cabins for the slaves, on  lower ground some distance behind the great house. The whole regiment  reined up as they approached the carriage entrance, and, although they  were eight hundred strong, there was plenty of room without putting a  single hoof upon a flower.
  It was a great place. That leaped to the eye, but it was not marked  upon Colonel Winchester's map, nor had he heard of it.
  &#8220;It's a grand house,&#8221; he said to his aides, &#8220;and it's a pity that it  should go to ruin after the slaves are freed, as they certainly will  be.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it was built upon slave labor,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;So it was, and so were many of the most famous buildings in the  world. But here, I'm not going to get into an argument about such  questions with young men under my command. Besides, I'm fighting to  destroy slavery, not to study its history. Sergeant Whitley, you're an  experienced trailer: do you see any signs that troops have passed  here?&#8221;
  &#8220;None at all, sir. Down near the gate where the drive is out of  repair I noticed wheel tracks, but they were several days old. The  freshest of them were light, as if made by buggies. I judge, sir, that  it was the family, the last to leave.&#8221;
  &#8220;And the wagons containing their valuables had gone on ahead?&#8221;
  &#8220;It would seem so, sir.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester sighed.
  &#8220;An invader is always feared and hated,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;But we do come as enemies,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;and this feeling toward us  can't be helped.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true. No matter what we do we'll never make any friends here  in one of the Gulf states, the very core of Southern feeling. Dick,  take a squad of men and enter the house. Pennington, you and Warner go  with him.&#8221;
  Dick sprang down instantly, chose Sergeant Whitley first and with  the others entered the great portico. The front door was locked but it  was easy enough to force it with a gun butt, and they went in, but not  before Dick had noticed over the door in large letters the name,  &#8220;Bellevue.&#8221; So this was Bellevue, one of the great cotton plantations  of Mississippi. He now vaguely remembered that he had once heard his  uncle, Colonel Kenton, speak of having stopped a week here. But he  could not recall the name of the owner. Strong for the Union as he was  Dick was glad that the family had gone before the Northern cavalry  came.
  The house was on a splendid scale inside also, but all the rugs and  curtains were gone. As they entered the great parlor Dick saw a large  piece of paper, and he flushed as he read written upon it in tall  letters:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO THE YANKEE RAIDERS: <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU NEED NOT LOOK FOR THE SILVER. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO VICKSBURG.
  &#8220;Look at that!&#8221; he said indignantly to Warner. &#8220;See how they taunt  us!&#8221;
  But Warner laughed.
  &#8220;Maybe some of our men at New Orleans have laid us open to such a  stab,&#8221; he said. Then he added whimsically:
  &#8220;We'll go to Vicksburg with Grant, Dick, and get that silver yet.&#8221;
  &#8220;The writing's fresh,&#8221; said Sergeant Whitley, who also looked at the  notification. &#8220;The paper hasn't begun to twist and curl yet. It's not  been posted up there many hours.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester entered at that moment and the notice was handed  to him. He, too, flushed a little when he read it, but the next instant  he laughed. Dick then called his attention to the apparent fact that it  had been put there recently.
  &#8220;May I speak a word, Colonel,&#8221; said Warner, who had been thinking so  hard that there was a line the full length of his forehead.
  &#8220;Yes, George, a dozen if you like. Go ahead. What is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;The sergeant, who has had much experience as a trailer, told us  that the tracks made by the buggy wheels were several days old. The  slaves probably had been sent southward before that time. Now some one  who saw our advance has come back, and, whoever it was, he was  thoroughly familiar with the house. He couldn't have been a servant.  Servants don't leave taunts of that kind. It must have been somebody  who felt our coming deeply, and if it had been an elderly man he would  have waited for action, he wouldn't have used saucy words. So, sir, I  think it must have been a boy. Just like Pennington there, for  instance.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good, George, go on with your reasonings.&#8221;
  &#8220;As surely, sir, as z plus y equals the total of the two, the one  who put up the placard was a son of the owner. He alone would feel  deeply enough to take so great a risk. The conditions absolutely demand  that the owner has such a son and that he has done it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very good, George. I think you're right, and this youth in giving  way to a natural burst of anger, although he did not mean to do so, has  posted up for us a warning. A lad of his spirit would go in search of  Forrest, and we cannot forget our experience with that general in  Tennessee. Now, boys, we'll make ready for the night, which is not far  away.&#8221;
  The house was built for a Southern climate, although Dick had  learned that it could be cold enough in Central Mississippi in  midwinter. But it was spring now and they opened all the doors and  windows, letting the pleasant air rush through the musty house.
  &#8220;It may rain,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, &#8220;and the officers will sleep  inside. The men will spread their blankets on the piazzas, and the  horses will be tethered in the grounds. I hate to see the flowers and  grass trodden down, but nature will restore them.&#8221;
  Some of the soldiers gathered wood from heaps nearby and fires were  kindled in the kitchen, and also on the hearths in the slave quarters.  Colonel Winchester had been truly called the father of his regiment. He  was invariably particular about its health and comfort, and, as he  always led it in person in battle, there was no finer body of men in  the Union service.
  Now he meant for his men to have coffee, and warm food after this  long and trying ride and soon savory odors arose, although the cooking  was not begun until after dark, lest the smoke carry a signal to a  lurking enemy. The cavalrymen cut the thick grass which grew  everywhere, and fed it to their horses, eight hundred massive jaws  munching in content. The beasts stirred but little after their long  ride and now and then one uttered a satisfied groan.
  The officers drank their coffee and ate their food on the eastern  piazza, which overlooked a sharp dip toward a creek three or four  hundred yards away. The night had rushed down suddenly after the  fashion of the far South, and from the creek they heard faintly the  hoarse frogs calling. Beyond the grounds a close ring of sentinels  watched, because Colonel Winchester had no mind to be surprised again  by Forrest or by Fighting Joe Wheeler or anybody else.
  The night was thick and dark and moist with clouds. Dick, despite  the peace that seemed to hang over everything, was oppressed. The  desolate house, even more than the sight of the field after the battle  was over, brought home to him the meaning of war. It was not alone the  death of men but the uprooting of a country for their children and  their children's children as well. Then his mind traveled back to his  uncle, Colonel Kenton, and suddenly he smote his knee.
  &#8220;What is it, Dick,&#8221; asked Colonel Winchester, who sat only two or  three yards away.
  &#8220;Now I remember, sir. When I was only seven or eight years old I  heard my uncle tell of stopping, as I told you, at a great plantation  in Mississippi called Bellevue, but I couldn't recall the name of its  owner. I know him now.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is the name, Dick?&#8221;
  &#8220;Woodville, John Woodville. He was a member of the Mississippi  Senate, and he was probably the richest man in the State.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I have heard the name. He is a Confederate colonel now,  with Pemberton's army. No doubt we'll have to fight him later on.&#8221;
  &#8220;Meanwhile, we're using his house.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fortune of war. But all war is in a sense unfair, because it's  usually a question of the greater force. At any rate, Dick, we won't  harm Colonel Woodville's home.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yet in the end, sir, a lot of these great old country places will  go, and what will take their place? You and I, coming from a border  state, know that the colored race is not made up of Uncle Toms.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, Dick, we haven't won yet, and until we do we won't bother  ourselves about the aftermath of war. I'm glad we found so large a  place as this. At the last moment I sent part of the men to the cabins,  but at least three or four hundred must lie here on the piazzas. And  most of them are already asleep. It's lucky they have roofs. Look how  the clouds are gathering!&#8221;
  As much more room had been made upon the piazzas by the assignment  of men to the cabins, Colonel Winchester and some of his officers also  rested there. Dick, lying between the two blankets which he always  carried in a roll tied to his saddle, was very comfortable now, with  his head on his knapsack. The night had turned cooler, and, save when  faint and far lightning quivered, it was heavy and dark with clouds.  But the young lieutenants, hardened by two years of war and life in the  open, felt snug and cosy on the broad, sheltered piazza. It was not  often they found such good quarters, and Dick, like Colonel Winchester,  was truly thankful that they had reached Bellevue before the coming  storm.
  It was evident now that the night was going to be wild. The  lightning grew brighter and came nearer, cutting fiercely across the  southern sky. The ominous rumble of thunder, which reminded Dick so  much of the mutter of distant battle, came from the horizon on which  the lightning was flashing.
  Colonel Winchester, Pennington and Warner had gone to sleep, but  Dick was wakeful. He had again that feeling of pity for the people who  had been compelled to flee from such a house, and who might lose it  forever. It seemed to him that all the men, save himself and the  sentinels, were asleep, sleeping with the soundness and indifference to  surroundings shown by men who took their sleep when they could.
  The horses stamped and moved uneasily beneath the threat of the  advancing storm, but the men slept heavily on.
  Dick knew that the sentinels were awake and watchful. They had a  wholesome dread of Forrest and Wheeler, those wild riders of the South.  Some of them had been present at that terrible surprise in Tennessee,  and they were not likely to be careless when they were sure that  Forrest might be near, but he remained uneasy nevertheless, and,  although he closed his eyes and sought a soft place for his head on the  saddle, sleep did not come.
  He was sure that his apprehension did not come from any fear of an  attack by Forrest or Wheeler. It was deeper-seated. The inherited sense  that belonged to his great grandfather, who had lived his life in the  wilderness, was warning him. It was not superstition. It seemed to Dick  merely the palpable result of an inheritance that had gone into the  blood. His famous great-grandfather, Paul Cotter, and his famous  friend, Henry Ware, had lived so much and so long among dangers that  the very air indicated to them when they were at hand.
  Dick looked down the long piazza, so long that the men at either end  of it were hidden by darkness. The tall trees in the grounds were  nodding before the wind, and the lightning flashed incessantly in the  southwest. The thunder was not loud, but it kept up a continuous  muttering and rumbling. The rain was coming in fitful gusts, but he  knew that it would soon drive hard and for a long time.
  Everybody within Dick's area of vision was sound asleep, except  himself. Colonel Winchester lay with his head on his arm and his  slumber was so deep that he was like one dead. Warner had not stirred a  particle in the last half-hour. Dick was angry at himself because he  could not sleep. Let the storm burst! It might drive on the wide roof  of the piazza and the steady beating sound would make his sleep all the  sounder and sweeter. He recalled, as millions of American lads have  done, the days when he lay in his bed just under the roof and heard  hail and sleet drive against it, merely to make him feel all the  snugger in the bed with his covers drawn around him.
  The fitful gusts of rain ceased, and then it came with a steady pour  and roar, driving directly down, thus leaving the men on the outer  edges of the piazzas untouched and dry. Still, Dick did not sleep, and  at last he arose and walked softly into the house. Here the sense of  danger grew stronger. He was reminded again of his early boyhood, when  some one blindfolded was told to find a given object, and the others  called &#8220;hot&#8221; when he was near or &#8220;cold&#8221; when he was away. He was  feeling hot now. That inherited sense, the magnetic feeling out of the  past, was warning him.
  Dick felt sure that some one not of their regiment was in the  building. He neither saw nor heard the least sign of a presence, but he  was absolutely certain that he was not alone within Bellevue. Since the  lightning had ceased it was pitchy dark inside. There was a wide hall  running through the building, with windows above the exits, but he saw  nothing through them save the driving rain and the dim outline of the  threshing trees.
  He turned into one of the side rooms, and then he paused and pushed  himself against the wall. He was sure now that he heard a soft  footstep. The darkness was so intense that it could be felt like a  mist. He waited but he did not hear it again, and then he began to make  his way around the wall, stepping as lightly as he could.
  He had gone through most of the rooms at their arrival and he still  retained a clear idea of the interior of the house. He knew that there  was another door on the far side of the chamber in which he stood, and  he meant to follow the wall until he reached it. Some one had been in  the room with him and Dick believed that he was leaving by the far  door.
  While he heard no further footsteps he felt a sudden light draught  on his face and he knew that the door had been opened and shut. He  might go to Colonel Winchester and tell him that a lurking spy or  somebody of that character was in the house, but what good would it do?  A spy at such a time and in such a place could not harm them, and the  whole regiment would be disturbed for nothing. He would follow the  chase alone.
  He found the door and passed into the next room. Its windows opened  upon the southern piazza and two or three shutters were thrown back. A  faint light entered and Dick saw that no one was there but himself. He  could discern the dim figures of the soldiers sleeping on the piazza  and beyond a cluster of the small pines grown on lawns.
  Dick felt that he had lost the trail for the time, but he did not  intend to give it up. Doubtless the intruder was some one who knew the  house and who was also aware of his presence inside. He also felt that  he would not be fired upon, because the stranger himself would not wish  to bring the soldiers down upon him. So, with a hand upon his pistol  butt, he opened the side door and followed once more into the darkness.
  The ghostly chase went on for a full half-hour, Dick having nothing  to serve him save an occasional light footfall. There was one period of  more than half an hour when he lost the fugitive entirely. He wandered  up to the second floor and then back again. There, in a room that had  been the library, he caught a glimpse of the man. But the figure was so  shadowy that he could tell nothing about him.
  &#8220;Halt!&#8221; cried Dick, snatching out his pistol. But when he leveled it  there was nothing to aim at. The figure had melted away, or rather it  had flitted through another door. Dick followed, chagrined. The  stranger seemed to be playing with him. Obviously, it was some one  thoroughly acquainted with the house, and that brought to Dick's mind  the thought that he himself, instead of the other man, was the stranger  there.
  He came at last to a passage which led to the kitchen, a great room,  because many people were often guests at Bellevue, and here he stopped  short, while his heart suddenly beat hard. A distinct odor coming from  different points suddenly assailed his nostrils. He had smelled it too  often in the last two years to be mistaken. It was smoke, and Bellevue  had been set on fire in several places.
  He inhaled it once or twice and then he saw again the shadowy figure  flitting down to the passage and to a small door that, unnoticed by the  soldiers, opened on the kitchen garden in the rear of the house.
  Dick never acted more promptly. Instantly he fired his pistol into  the ceiling, the report roaring in the confined spaces of the house,  and then shouting with all his might: &#8220;Fire! Fire! Fire!&#8221; as he dashed  down the passage he ran through the little door, which the intruder had  left open, and pursued him in the darkness and rain into the garden.  There was a flash ahead of him and a bullet whistled past his ear, but  he merely increased his speed and raced in the direction of the flash.  As he ran he heard behind him a tremendous uproar, the voices and tread  of hundreds of soldiers, awakened suddenly, and he knew that they would  rush through Bellevue in search of the fires.
  But it was Dick's impulse to capture the daring intruder who would  destroy the house over their heads. Built of wood, it would burn so  fast, once the torches were set, that the rain would have little effect  upon the leaping flames, unless measures were taken at once, which he  knew that the regiment would do, under such a capable man as Colonel  Winchester. Meanwhile he was hot in pursuit.
  The trail which was not that of footsteps, but of a shadowy figure,  ran between tall and close rows of grapevines so high on wooden  framework that they hid any one who passed. The suspicion that Dick had  held at first was confirmed. This was no stranger, no intruder. He knew  every inch of both house and grounds, and, after having set the house  on fire, he had selected the only line of retreat, but a safe one,  through the thick and lofty vegetation of the garden, which ran down to  the edge of the ravine in the rear, where he could slip quietly under  the fence, drop through the thick grass into the ravine unseen by the  pickets, and escape at his leisure in the darkness.
  Dick was so sure of his theory that he strained every effort to  overtake the figure which was flitting before him like a ghost. In his  eagerness he had forgotten to shout any alarm about the pickets, but it  would have been of no avail, as most of them, under the impulse of  alarm, had rushed forward to help extinguish the fires.
  He saw the fugitive reach the end of the garden, drop almost flat,  and then slip under a broken place in the palings. At an ordinary time  he would have stopped there, but all the instincts of the hunter were  aroused. It was still raining, and he was already soaked. Wet branches  and leaves struck him in the face as he passed, but his energy and  eagerness were undimmed.
  He, too, dropped at the hole under the broken palings and slid  forward face foremost. The wet grass was as slippery as ice, and after  he passed through the hole Dick kept going. Moreover, his speed  increased. He had not realized that the garden went to the very edge of  the ravine, and he was shooting down a steep slope to the depth of  thirty feet. He grasped instinctively at weeds and grass as he made his  downward plunge and fetched up easily at the bottom.
  He sprang to his feet and saw the shadowy fugitive running down the  ravine. In an instant he followed headlong, tripped once or twice on  the wet grass, but was up every time like lightning, and once more in  swift pursuit. The fugitive turned once, raised his pistol and pulled  the trigger again, evidently forgetful that it was empty. When the  hammer snapped on the trigger he uttered a low cry of anger and hurled  the useless weapon into the grass. Then he whirled around and faced  Dick, who was coming on, eager and panting.
  Dick's own pistol was empty and he did not carry his small sword. He  stopped abruptly when the other turned, and, in the dim light and rain,  he saw that his opponent was a young man or rather youth of about his  own size and age. When he saw the lad cast the pistol aside Dick, moved  by some chivalrous impulse, dropped his own in the grass.
  Then the two stared at each other. They were far beyond the line of  the pickets, and as they stood in the deep ravine there was no chance  that any one would either see or hear them. As Dick gazed intently, the  face and figure of his antagonist shaped themselves more distinctly in  the dim light. He beheld before him a tall youth, extremely well built,  fair of face, his brown hair slightly long. He wore rain-soaked  civilian's garb.
  He saw that the youth was panting like himself, but it was not  wholly the result of flight. His face expressed savage anger and  indignation.
  &#8220;You dirty Yankee!&#8221; he said.
  Dick started. No one had ever before addressed him with such venom.
  &#8220;If by Yankee you mean loyalty to the Union then I'm one,&#8221; he said,  &#8220;and I'm proud of it. What's more I'm willing to tell who I am. My name  is Richard Mason. I'm from Kentucky, and I'm a lieutenant in the  regiment of Colonel Arthur Winchester, which occupies the building  behind us.&#8221;
  &#8220;From Kentucky and consorting with Yankees! A lot of you are doing  it, and you ought to be on our side! We hate you for it more than we do  the real Yankees!&#8221;
  &#8220;It's our right to choose, and we've chosen. And now, since you're  talking so much about right and wrong, who may you be, Mr. Firebug?&#8221;
  Even in the dark Dick saw his opponent's face flush, and his eyes  flash with deadly hostility.
  &#8220;My name is Victor Woodville,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and my father is Colonel  John Woodville, C.S.A. He is the owner of the house in which your  infamous Yankee regiment is encamped.&#8221;
  &#8220;And which you have tried to burn?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd rather see it burn than shelter Yankees. You'd burn it anyway  later on. Grant's troops have already begun to use the torch.&#8221;
  &#8220;At any rate you'll go before our colonel. He'll want to ask you a  lot of questions.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not going before your colonel.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, you are.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who's going to take me?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then come on and do it.&#8221;
  Dick advanced warily. Both had regained their breath and strength  now. Dick with two years of active service in the army had the size and  muscles of a man. But so had his opponent. Each measured the other, and  they were formidable antagonists, well matched.
  Dick had learned boxing at the Pendleton Academy, and, as he  approached slowly, looking straight into the eyes of his enemy, he  suddenly shot his right straight for Woodville's chin. The  Mississippian, as light on his feet as a leopard, leaped away and  countered with his left, a blow so quick and hard that Dick, although  he threw his head to one side, caught a part of its force just above  his ear. But, guarding himself, he sprang back, while Woodville faced  him, laughing lightly.
  Dick shook his head a little and the singing departed. Just above  his ear he felt a great soreness, but he was cool now. Moreover, he was  losing his anger.
  &#8220;First blow for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see that you know how to use your  fists.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope to prove it.&#8221;
  Woodville, stepping lightly on his toes and feinting with his left,  caught Dick on his cheek bone with his right. Then he sought to spring  away, but Dick, although staggered, swung heavily and struck Woodville  on the forehead. The Mississippian went down full length on the  slippery grass but jumped to his feet in an instant. Blood was flowing  from his forehead, whence it ran down his nose and fell to the earth,  drop by drop. Dick himself was bleeding from the cut on his cheek bone.
  The two faced each other, cool, smiling, but resolute enemies.
  &#8220;First knockdown for you,&#8221; said Woodville, &#8220;but I mean that the  second shall be mine.&#8221;
  &#8220;Go in and try.&#8221;
  But Woodville drew back a little, and as Dick followed, looking for  an opening he was caught again a heavy clip on the side of the head. He  saw stars and was not able to return the blow, but he sprang back and  protected himself once more with his full guard, while he regained his  balance and strength.
  &#8220;Am I a firebug?&#8221; asked Woodville tauntingly.
  Dick considered. This youth interested him. There was no denying  that Woodville had great cause for anger, when he found his father's  house occupied by a regiment of the enemy. He considered it defilement.  The right or wrong of the war had nothing to do with it. It was to him  a matter of emotion.
  &#8220;I'll take back the epithet 'firebug,'&#8220; he said, &#8220;but I must stick  to my purpose of carrying you to Colonel Winchester.&#8221;
  &#8220;Always provided you can: Look out for yourself.&#8221;
  The Mississippian, who was wonderfully agile, suddenly danced in&#8212;on  his toes it seemed to Dick&#8212;and landed savagely on his opponent's left  ear. Then he was away so quickly and lightly that Dick's return merely  cut the air.
  The Kentuckian felt the blood dripping from another point. His ear,  moreover, was very sore and began to swell rapidly. One less enduring  would have given up, but he had a splendid frame, toughened by  incessant hardship. And, above all, enclosed within that frame was a  lion heart. He shook his head slightly, because a buzzing was going on  there, but in a moment or two it stopped.
  &#8220;Are you satisfied?&#8221; asked young Woodville.
  &#8220;You remember what Paul Jones said: 'I've just begun to fight.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Was it Paul Jones? Well, I suppose it was. Anyhow, if you feel that  way about it, so do I. Then come on again, Mr. Richard Mason.&#8221;
  Dick's blood was up. The half-minute or so of talk had enabled him  to regain his breath. Although he felt that incessant pain and swelling  in his left ear, his resolution to win was unshaken. Pride was now  added to his other motives.
  He took a step forward, feinted, parried skillfully, and then  stepped back. Woodville, always agile as a panther, followed him and  swung for the chin, but Dick, swerving slightly to one side, landed  with great force on Woodville's jaw. The young Mississippian fell, but,  while Dick stood looking at him, he sprang to his feet and faced his  foe defiantly. The blood was running down his cheek and dyeing the  whole side of his face. But Dick saw the spirit in his eye and knew  that he was far from conquered.
  Woodville smiled and threw back his long hair from his face.
  &#8220;A good one for you. You shook me up,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but I don't see  any sign of your ability to carry me to that Yankee colonel, as you  boasted you would do.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I'm going to do it.&#8221;
  The rain increased and washed the blood from both their faces. It  was dark within the ravine, but they had been face to face so long that  they could read the eyes of each other. Those of Woodville like those  of Dick ceased to express great anger. In the mind of each was growing  a respect for his antagonist. The will to conquer remained, but not the  desire to hate.
  &#8220;If you're going to do it, then why don't you?&#8221; said Woodville.
  Dick moved slowly forward, still watching the eyes of the  Mississippian. He believed now that Woodville, agile and alert though  he might be, had not fully recovered his strength. There was terrific  steam in that last punch and the head of the man who had received it  might well be buzzing yet.
  Dick then moved in with confidence, but a lightning blow crashed  through his guard, caught him on the chin and sent him to earth. He  rose, though still half-stunned, and saw that the confident, taunting  look had returned to Woodville's face. Fortunate now for Dick that the  pure blood of great woods rangers flowed in his veins, and that he had  inherited from them too an iron frame. His chin was cut and he had seen  a thousand stars. But his eyes cleared and steadily he faced his foe.
  &#8220;Do I go with you to your colonel?&#8221; asked Woodville, ironically.
  &#8220;You do,&#8221; replied Dick firmly.
  He looked his enemy steadily in the eye again, and he felt a great  sense of triumph. After such severe punishment he was stronger than  ever and he knew it.
  Therefore he must win. He struck heavily, straight for the angle of  Woodville's chin. The Mississippian evaded the blow and flashed in with  his left. But Dick, who was learning to be very wary, dodged it and  came back so swiftly that Woodville was caught and beaten to his knees.
  But the son of the house of Bellevue was still so agile that he was  able to recover his feet and spring away. Dick saw, however, that he  was panting heavily. The blow had taken a considerable part of his  remaining strength. He also saw that his antagonist was regarding him  with a curious eye.
  &#8220;You fight well, Yank,&#8221; said Woodville, &#8220;although I ought not to  call you Yank, but rather a traitor, as you're a Kentuckian. Still,  I've put my marks on you. You're bleeding a lot and you'd be a sight if  it weren't for this cleansing rain.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've been putting the map of Kentucky on your own face. You don't  look as much like Mississippi as you did. You'll take notice too that  you didn't burn the house. If you'll glance up the side of this ravine  you'll see just a little dying smoke. Eight hundred soldiers put it out  in short order.&#8221;
  Woodville's face flushed, and his eyes for the first time since the  beginning of the encounter shone with an angry gleam. But the wrathful  fire quickly died.
  &#8220;On the whole, I'm not sorry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was an impulse that made  me do it. Our army will come and drive you away, and our house will be  our own again.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's putting it fairly. What's the use of burning such a fine  place as Bellevue? Still, we want you. Our colonel has many questions  to ask you.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can't take me.&#8221;
  Dick judged that the crucial moment had now come. Woodville was  breathing much more heavily than he was, and seemed to be near  exhaustion. Dick darted boldly in, received a swinging right and left  on either jaw that cut his cheeks and made the blood flow. But he sent  his right to Woodville's chin and the young Mississippian without a  sound dropped to the ground, lying relaxed and flat upon his back, his  white face, streaked with red, upturned to the rain.
  He was so still that Dick was seized with fear lest he had killed  him. He liked this boy who had fought him so well and, grasping him by  both shoulders, he shook him hard. But when he loosed him Woodville  fell back flat and inert.
  Dick heard the waters of a brook trickling down the ravine, and,  snatching off his cap, he ran to it. He filled the cap and returned  just in time to see Woodville leap lightly to his feet and disappear  with the speed of a deer among the bushes.
