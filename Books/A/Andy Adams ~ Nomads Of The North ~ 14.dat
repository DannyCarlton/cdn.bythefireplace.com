  The next morning Miki set out again for the trapline of Jacques Le   Beau. It was not the thought of food easily secured that tempted  him.  There would have been a greater thrill in killing for  himself. It was  the trail, with its smell of the man-beast, that  drew him like a  magnet. Where that smell was very strong he wanted  to lie down, and  wait. Yet with his desire there was also fear,  and a steadily growing  caution. He did not tamper with the first  KEKEK, nor with the second.  At the third Le Beau had fumbled in  the placing of his bait, and for  that reason the little ball of  fat was strong with the scent of his  hands. A fox would have  turned away from it quickly. Miki, however,  drew it from the peg  and dropped it in the snow between his forefeet.  Then he looked  about him, and listened for a full minute. After that  he licked  the ball of fat with his tongue. The scent of Le Beau's  hands kept  him from swallowing it as he had swallowed the caribou  meat. A  little suspiciously he crushed it slowly between his jaws. The  fat  was sweet. He was about to gulp it down when he detected another   and less pleasant taste, and what remained in his mouth he spat  out  upon the snow. But the acrid bite of the poison remained upon  his  tongue and in his throat. It crept deeper&#8212;and he caught up a  mouthful  of snow and swallowed it to put out the burning sensation  that was  crawling nearer to his vitals. 
  Had he devoured the ball of fat as he had eaten the other baits he   would have been dead within a quarter of an hour, and Le Beau  would  not have gone far to find his body. As it was, he was  beginning to  turn sick at the end of the fifteen minutes. A  premonition of the evil  that was upon him drew him off the trail  and in the direction of the  windfall. He had gone only a short  distance when suddenly his legs  gave way under him, and he fell.  He began to shiver. Every muscle in  his body trembled. His teeth  clicked. His eyes grew wide, and it was  impossible for him to  move. And then, like a hand throttling him,  there came a strange  stiffness in the back of his neck, and his breath  hissed chokingly  out of his throat. The stiffness passed like a wave  of fire  through his body. Where his muscles had trembled and shivered  a  moment before they now became rigid and lifeless. The throttling   grip of the poison at the base of his brain drew his head back  until  his muzzle was pointed straight up to the sky. Still he made  no cry.  For a space every nerve in his body was at the point of  death. 
  Then came the change. As though a string had snapped, the horrible   grip left the back of his neck; the stiffness shot out of his body  in  a flood of shivering cold, and in another moment he was  twisting and  tearing up the snow in mad convulsions. The spasm  lasted for perhaps a  minute. When it was over Miki was panting.  Streams of saliva dripped  from his jaws into the snow. But he was  alive. Death had missed him by  a hair, and after a little he  staggered to his feet and continued on  his way to the windfall. 
  Thereafter Jacques Le Beau might place a million poison capsules   in his way and he would not touch them. Never again would he steal   the meat from a bait-peg. 
  Two days later Le Beau saw where Miki had fought his fight with   death in the snow and his heart was black with rage and   disappointment. He began to follow the footprints of the dog. It  was  noon when he came to the windfall and saw the beaten path  where Miki  entered it. On his knees he peered into the cavernous  depths&#8212;and saw  nothing. But Miki, lying watchfully, saw the man,  and he was like the  black, bearded monster who had almost killed  him with a club a long  time ago. And in his heart, too, there was  disappointment, for away  back in his memory of things there was  always the thought of  Challoner&#8212;the master he had lost; and it  was never Challoner whom he  found when he came upon the man smell. 
  Le Beau heard his growl, and the man's blood leapt excitedly as he   rose to his feet. He could not go in after the wild dog, and he  could  not lure him out. But there was another way. He would drive  him out  with fire! 
  Deep back in his fortress, Miki heard the crunch of Le Beau's feet   in the snow. A few minutes later he saw the man-beast again  peering  into his lair. 
  &quot;BETE, BETE,&quot; he called half tauntingly, and again Miki growled. 
  Jacques was satisfied. The windfall was not more than thirty or   forty feet in diameter, and about it the forest was open and clear  of  undergrowth. It would be impossible for the wild dog to get  away from  his rifle. 
  A second time he went around the piled-up mass of fallen timber.   On three sides it was completely smothered under the deep snow.  Only  where Miki's trail entered was it open. 
  Getting the wind behind him Le Beau made his ISKOO of birch-bark   and dry wood at the far end of the windfall. The seasoned logs and   tree-tops caught the fire like tinder, and within a few minutes  the  flames began to crackle and roar in a manner that made Miki  wonder  what was happening. For a space the smoke did not reach  him. Le Beau,  watching, with his rifle in his bare hands, did not  for an instant let  his eyes leave the spot where the wild dog must  come out. 
  Suddenly a pungent whiff of smoke filled Miki's nostrils, and a   thin white cloud crept in a ghostly veil between him and the  opening.  A crawling, snake-like rope of it began to pour between  two logs  within a yard of him, and with it the strange roaring  grew nearer and  more menacing. Then, for the first time, he saw  lightning flashes of  yellow flame through the tangled debris as  the fire ate into the heart  of a mass of pitch-filled spruce. In  another ten seconds the flames  leapt twenty feet into the air, and  Jacques Le Beau stood with his  rifle half to his shoulder, ready  to kill. 
  Appalled by the danger that was upon him, Miki did not forget Le   Beau. With an instinct sharpened to fox-like keenness his mind  leapt  instantly to the truth of the matter. It was the man-beast  who had set  this new enemy upon him; and out there, just beyond  the opening, the  man-beast was waiting. So, like the fox, he did  what Le Beau least  expected. He crawled back swiftly through the  tangled tops until he  came to the wall of snow that shut the  windfall in, and through this  he burrowed his way almost as  quickly as the fox himself would have  done it. With his jaws he  tore through the half-inch outer crust, and  a moment later stood  in the open, with the fire between him and Le  Beau. 
  The windfall was a blazing furnace, and suddenly Le Beau ran back   a dozen steps so that he could see on the farther side. A hundred   yards away he saw Miki making for the deeper forest. 
  It was a clear shot. At that distance Le Beau would have staked   his life that it was impossible for him to miss. He did not hurry.   One shot, and it would be over. He raised his rifle, and in that   instant a wisp of smoke came like the lash of a whip with the wind   and caught him fairly in the eyes, and his bullet passed three  inches  over Miki's head. The whining snarl of it was a new thing  to Miki. But  he recognized the thunder of the gun&#8212;and he knew  what a gun could do.  To Le Beau, still firing at him through the  merciful cloud of smoke,  he was like a gray streak flashing to the  thick timber. Three times  more Le Beau fired. From the edge of a  dense clump of spruce Miki  flung back a defiant howl. He  disappeared as Le Beau's last shot  shovelled up the snow at his  heels. 
  The narrowness of his escape from the man-beast did not frighten   Miki out of the Jackson's Knee country. If anything, it held him  more  closely to it. It gave him something to think about besides  Neewa and  his aloneness. As the fox returns to peer stealthily  upon the deadfall  that has almost caught him, so the trapline was  possessed now of a new  thrill for Miki. Heretofore the man-smell  had held for him only a  vague significance; now it marked the  presence of a real and concrete  danger. And he welcomed it. His  wits were sharpened. The fascination  of the trapline was deadlier  than before. 
  From the burned windfall he made a wide detour to a point where Le   Beau's snowshoe trail entered the edge of the swamp; and here,  hidden  in a thick clump of bushes, he watched him as he travelled  homeward  half an hour later. 
  From that day he hung like a grim, gray ghost to the trapline.   Silent-footed, cautious, always on the alert for the danger which   threatened him, he haunted Jacques Le Beau's thoughts and  footsteps  with the elusive persistence of a were-wolf&#8212;a loup-  garou of the  Black Forest. Twice in the next week Le Beau caught a  flash of him.  Three times he heard him howl. And twice he followed  his trail until,  in despair and exhaustion, he turned back. Never  was Miki caught  unaware. He ate no more baits in the trap-houses.  Even when Le Beau  lured him with the whole carcass of a rabbit he  would not touch it,  nor would he touch a rabbit frozen dead in a  snare. From Le Beau's  traps he took only the living things,  chiefly birds and squirrels and  the big web-footed snowshoe  rabbits. And because a mink jumped at him  once, and tore open his  nose, he destroyed a number of minks so  utterly that their pelts  were spoiled. He found himself another  windfall, but instinct  taught him now never to go to it directly, but  to approach it, and  leave it, in a roundabout way. 
  Day and night Le Beau, the man-brute, plotted against him. He set   many poison-baits. He killed a doe, and scattered strychnine in  its  entrails. He built deadfalls, and baited them with meat soaked  in  boiling fat. He made himself a &quot;blind&quot; of spruce and cedar  boughs, and  sat for long hours, watching with his rifle. And still  Miki was the  victor. 
  One day Miki found a huge fisher-cat in one of the traps. He had   not forgotten the battle of long ago with Oochak, the other   fisher-cat, or the whipping he had received. But there was no  thought  of vengeance in his heart on the early evening he became  acquainted  with Oochak the Second. Usually he was in his windfall  at dusk, but  this afternoon a great and devouring loneliness had  held him on the  trail. The spirit of Kuskayetum&#8212;the hand of the  mating-god&#8212;was  pressing heavily upon him; the consuming desire of  flesh and blood for  the companionship of other flesh and blood. It  burned in his veins  like a fever. It took away from him all  thought of hunger or of the  hunt. In his soul was a vast, unfilled  yearning. 
  It was then that he came upon Oochak. Perhaps it was the same   Oochak of months ago. If so, he had grown even as Miki had grown.  He  was splendid, with his long silken fur and his sleek body, and  he was  not struggling, but sat awaiting his fate without  excitement. To Miki  he looked warm and soft and comfortable. It  made him think of Neewa,  and the hundred and one nights they had  slept together. His desire  leapt out to Oochak. He whined softly  as he advanced. He would make  friends. Even with Oochak, his old  enemy, he would lie down in peace  and happiness, so great was the  gnawing emptiness in his heart. 
  Oochak made no response, nor did he move, but sat furred up like a   huge soft ball, watching Miki as he crept nearer on his belly.   Something of the old puppishness came back into the dog. He  wriggled  and thumped his tail, and as he whined again he seemed to  say. 
  &quot;Let's forget the old trouble, Oochak. Let's be friends. I've got   a fine windfall&#8212;and I'll kill you a rabbit.&quot; 
  And still Oochak did not move or make a sound. At last Miki could   almost reach out with his forepaws and touch him. He dragged  himself  still nearer, and his tail thumped harder. 
  &quot;And I'll get you out of the trap,&quot; he may have been saying. &quot;It's   the man-beast's trap&#8212;and I hate him.&quot; 
  And then, so suddenly that Miki had no chance to guard himself,   Oochak sprang the length of the trap-chain and was at him. With  teeth  and razor-edged claws he tore deep gashes in Miki's nose.  Even then  the blood of battle rose slowly in him, and he might  have retreated  had not Oochak's teeth got a hold in his shoulder.  With a roar he  tried to shake himself free, but Oochak held on.  Then his jaws snapped  at the back of the fisher-cat's neck. When  he was done Oochak was  dead. 
  He slunk away, but in him there was no more the thrill of the   victor. He had killed, but in killing he had found no joy. Upon   him&#8212;the four-footed beast&#8212;had fallen at last the oppression of  the  thing that drives men mad. He stood in the heart of a vast  world, and  for him that world was empty. He was an outcast. His  heart crying out  for comradeship, he found that all things feared  him or hated him. He  was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or  a home. He did not reason  these things but the gloom of them  settled upon him like black night. 
  He did not return to his windfall. In a little open he sat on his   haunches, listening to the night sounds, and watching the stars as   they came out. There was an early moon, and as it came up over the   forest, a great throbbing red disc that seemed filled with life,  he  howled mournfully in the face of it. He wandered out into a big  burn a  little later, and there the night was like day, so clear  that his  shadow followed him and all other things about him cast  shadows, And  then, all at once, he caught in the night wind a  sound which he had  heard many times before. 
  It came from far away, and it was like a whisper at first, an echo   of strange voices riding on the wind, A hundred times he had heard   that cry of the wolves. Since Maheegun, the she-wolf, had gashed  his  shoulder so fiercely away back in the days of his puppyhood  he had  evaded the path of that cry. He had learned, in a way, to  hate it. But  he could not wipe out entirely the thrill that came  with that call of  the blood. And to-night it rode over all his  fear and hatred. Out  there was COMPANY. Whence the cry came the  wild brethren were running  two by two, and three by three, and  there was COMRADESHIP. His body  quivered. An answering cry rose in  his throat, dying away in a whine,  and for an hour after that he  heard no more of the wolf-cry in the  wind. The pack had swung to  the west&#8212;so far away that their voices  were lost. And it passed&#8212;  with the moon straight over them&#8212;close to  the shack of Pierrot,  the halfbreed. 
  In Pierrot's cabin was a white man, on his way to Fort O' God. He   saw that Pierrot crossed himself, and muttered. 
  &quot;It is the mad pack,&quot; explained Pierrot then. &quot;M'sieu, they have   been KESKWAO since the beginning of the new moon. In them are the   spirits of devils.&quot; 
  He opened the cabin door a little, so that the mad cry of the   beasts came to them plainly. When he closed it there was in his  eyes  a look of strange fear. 
  &quot;Now and then wolves go like that&#8212;KESKWAO (stark mad)&#8212;in the   dead of winter,&quot; he shuddered. &quot;Three days ago there were twenty  of  them, m'sieu, for I saw them with my own eyes, and counted  their  tracks in the snow. Since then they been murdered and torn  into  strings by the others of the pack. Listen to them ravin'! Can  you tell  me why, m'sieu? Can you tell me why wolves sometimes go  mad in the  heart of winter when there is no heat or rotten meat to  turn them  sick? NON? But I can tell you. They are the loups-  garous; in their  bodies ride the spirits of devils, and there they  will ride until the  bodies die. For the wolves that go mad in the  deep snows always die,  m'sieu. That is the strange part of it.  THEY DIE!&quot; 
  And then it was, swinging eastward from the cabin of Pierrot, that   the mad wolves of Jackson's Knee came into the country of the big   swamp wherein trees bore the Double-X blaze of Jacques Le Beau's  axe.  There were fourteen of them running in the moonlight. What it  is that  now and then drives a wolf-pack mad in the dead of winter  no man yet  has wholly learned. Possibly it begins with a &quot;bad&quot;  wolf; just as a  &quot;bad&quot; sledge-dog, nipping and biting his fellows,  will spread his  distemper among them until the team becomes an  ugly, quarrelsome  horde. Such a dog the wise driver kills&#8212;or  turns loose. 
  The wolves that bore down upon Le Beau's country were red-eyed and   thin. Their bodies were covered with gashes, and the mouths of  some  frothed blood. They did not run as wolves run for meat. They  were a  sinister and suspicious lot, with a sneaking droop to their  haunches,  and their cry was not the deep-throated cry of the hunt-  pack but a  ravening clamour that seemed to have no leadership or  cause. Scarcely  was the sound of their tongues gone beyond the  hearing of Pierrot's  ears than one of the thin gray beasts rubbed  against the shoulder of  another, and the second turned with the  swiftness of a snake, like the  &quot;bad&quot; dog of the traces, and struck  his fangs deep into the first  wolf's flesh. Could Pierrot have  seen, he would have understood then  how the four he had found had  come to their end. 
  Swift as the snap of a whip-lash the fight between the two was on.   The other twelve of the pack stopped. They came back, circling in   cautiously and grimly silent about their fighting comrades. They   ranged themselves in a ring, as men gather about a fistic battle;  and  there they waited, their jaws drooling, their fangs clicking,  a low  and eager whining smothered in their throats. And then the  thing  happened. One of the fighting wolves went down. He was on  his  back&#8212;and the end came. The twelve wolves were upon him as  one, and,  like those Pierrot had seen, he was torn to pieces, and  his flesh  devoured. After that the thirteen went on deeper into Le  Beau's  country. 
  Miki heard them again, after that hour's interval of silence.   Farther and farther he had wandered from the forest. He had  crossed  the &quot;burn,&quot; and was in the open plain, with the rough  ridges cutting  through and the big river at the edge of it. It was  not so gloomy out  here, and his loneliness weighed upon him less  heavily than in the  deep timber. 
  And across this plain came the voice of the wolves. 
  He did not move away from it to-night. He waited, silhouetted   against the vivid starlight at the crest of a rocky knoll, and the   top of this knoll was so small that another could not have stood   beside him without their shoulders touching. On all sides of him  the  plain swept away in the white light of the stars and moon;  never had  the desire to respond to the wild brethren urged itself  upon him more  fiercely than now. He flung back his head, until his  black-tipped  muzzle pointed up to the stars, and the voice rolled  out of his  throat. But it was only half a howl. Even then,  oppressed by his great  loneliness, there gripped him that  something instinctive which warned  him against betrayal. After  that he remained quiet, and as the wolves  drew nearer his body  grew tense, his muscles hardened, and in his  throat there was the  low whispering of a snarl instead of a howl. He  sensed danger. He  had caught, in the voice of the wolves, the ravening  note that had  made Pierrot cross himself and mutter of the  loups-garous, and he  crouched down on his belly at the top of the  rocky mound. 
  Then he saw them. They were sweeping like dark and swiftly moving   shadows between him and the forest. Suddenly they stopped, and for  a  few moments no sound came from them as they packed themselves  closely  on the scent of his fresh trail in the snow. And then they  surged in  his direction; this time there was a still fiercer  madness in the wild  cry that rose from their throats. In a dozen  seconds they were at the  mound. They swept around it and past it,  all save one&#8212;a huge gray  brute who shot up the hillock straight  at the prey the others had not  yet seen. There was a snarl in  Miki's throat as he came. Once more he  was facing the thrill of a  great fight. Once more the blood ran  suddenly hot in his veins,  and fear was driven from him as the wind  drives smoke from a fire.  If Neewa were only there now, to fend at his  back while he fought  in front! He stood up on his feet. He met the  up-rushing pack-  brute head to head. Their jaws clashed, and the wild  wolf found  jaws at last that crunched through his own as if they had  been  whelp's bone, and he rolled and twisted back to the plain in a   dying agony. But not until another gray form had come to fill his   place. Into the throat of this second Miki drove his fangs as the   wolf came over the crest. It was the slashing, sabre-like stroke  of  the north-dog, and the throat of the wolf was torn open and the  blood  poured out as if emptied by the blade of a knife. Down he  plunged to  join the first, and in that instant the pack swept up  and over Miki,  and he was smothered under the mass of their  bodies. Had two or three  attacked him at once he would have died  as quickly as the first two of  his enemies had come to their end.  Numbers saved him in the first  rush. On the level of the plain he  would have been torn into pieces  like a bit of cloth, but on the  space at the top of the KOPJE, no  larger than the top of a table,  he was lost for a few seconds under  the snarling and rending horde  of his enemies. Fangs intended for him  sank into other wolf-flesh;  the madness of the pack became a blind  rage, and the assault upon  Miki turned into a slaughter of the wolves  themselves. On his  back, held down by the weight of bodies, Miki drove  his fangs  again and again into flesh. A pair of jaws seized him in the   groin, and a shock of agony swept through him. It was a death-  grip,  sinking steadily into his vitals. Just in time another pair  of jaws  seized the wolf who held him, and the hold in his groin  gave way. In  that moment Miki felt himself plunging down the steep  side of the  knoll, and after him came a half of what was left  alive of the pack. 
  The fighting devils in Miki's brain gave way all at once to that   cunning of the fox which had served him even more than claw and  fang  in times of great danger. Scarcely had he reached the plain  before he  was on his feet, and no sooner had he touched his feet  than he was off  like the wind in direction of the river. He had  gained a fifty-yard  start before the first of the wolves  discovered his flight. There were  only eight that followed him  now. Of the thirteen mad beasts five were  dead or dying at the  foot of the hillock. Of these Miki had slain two.  The others had  fallen at the fangs of their own brethren. 
  Half a mile away were the steep cliffs of the river, and at the   edge of these cliffs was a great cairn of rocks in which for one   night Miki had sought shelter. He had not forgotten the tunnel  into  the tumbled mass of rock debris, nor how easily it could be  defended  from within. Once in that tunnel he would turn in the  door of it and  slaughter his enemies one by one, for only one by  one could they  attack him. But he had not reckoned with that huge  gray form behind  him that might have been named Lightning, the  fiercest and swiftest of  all the mad wolves of the pack. He sped  ahead of his slower-footed  companions like a streak of light, and  Miki had made but half the  distance to the cairn when he heard the  panting breath of Lightning  behind him. Even Hela, his father,  could not have run more swiftly  than Miki, but great as was Miki's  speed, Lightning ran more swiftly.  Two thirds of the distance to  the cliff and the huge wolf's muzzle was  at Miki's flank. With a  burst of speed Miki gained a little. Then  steadily Lightning drew  abreast of him, a grim and merciless shadow of  doom. 
  A hundred yards farther on and a little to the right was the   cairn. But Miki could not run to the right without turning into   Lightning's jaws, and he realized now that if he reached the cairn   his enemy would be upon him before he could dive into the tunnel  and  face about. To stop and fight would be death, for behind he  could hear  the other wolves. Ten seconds more and the chasm of the  river yawned  ahead of them. 
  At its very brink Miki swung and struck at Lightning. He sensed   death now, and in the face of death all his hatred turned upon the   one beast that had run at his side. In an instant they were down.  Two  yards from the edge of the cliff, and Miki's jaws were at  Lightning's  throat when the pack rushed upon them. They were swept  onward. The  earth flew out from under their feet, and they were in  space. Grimly  Miki held to the throat of his foe. Over and over  they twisted in  mid-air, and then came a terrific shock. Lightning  was under. Yet so  great was the shock, that, even though the  wolf's huge body was under  him like a cushion, Miki was stunned  and dazed. A minute passed before  he staggered to his feet.  Lightning lay still, the life smashed out of  him. A little beyond  him lay the bodies of two other wolves that in  their wild rush had  swept over the cliff. 
  Miki looked up. Between him and the stars he could see the top of   the cliff, a vast distance above him. One after the other he  smelled  at the bodies of the three dead wolves. Then he limped  slowly along  the base of the cliff until he came to a fissure  between two huge  rocks. Into this he crept and lay down, licking  his wounds. After all  there were worse things in the world than Le  Beau's trapline. Perhaps  there were even worse things than men. 
  After a time he stretched his great head out between his fore-   paws, and slowly the starlight grew dimmer, and the snow less  white,  and he slept.
