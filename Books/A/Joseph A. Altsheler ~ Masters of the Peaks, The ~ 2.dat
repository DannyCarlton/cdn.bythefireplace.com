  Late in the afternoon Willet went to sleep and Robert and Tayoga  watched, although, as the hunter had done, they depended more upon ear  than eye. They too heard now and then the faint report of distant shots  from the hunt, and Robert's heart beat very fast, but, if the young  Onondaga felt emotion, he did not show it. At twilight, they ate a  frugal supper, and when the night had fully come they rose and walked  about a little to make their stiffened muscles elastic again.
  &#8220;The hunters have all gone back to the camp now,&#8221; said Tayoga,  &#8220;since it is not easy to pursue the game by dusk, and we need not keep  so close, like a bear in its den.&#8221;
  &#8220;And the danger of our being seen is reduced to almost nothing,&#8221;  said Robert.
  &#8220;It is so, Dagaeoga, but we will have another fight to make. We must  strive to keep ourselves from freezing. It turns very cold on the  mountains! The wind is now blowing from the north, and do you not feel  a keener edge to it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I do,&#8221; replied Robert, sensitive of body as well as mind, and he  shivered as he spoke. &#8220;It's a most unfortunate change for us. But now  that I think of it we've got to expect it up among the high mountains  toward Canada. Shall we light another fire?&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll talk of that later with the Great Bear when he comes out of  his sleep. But it fast grows colder and colder, Dagaeoga!&#8221;
  Weather was an enormous factor in the lives of the borderers.  Wilderness storms and bitter cold often defeated their best plans, and  shelterless men, they were in a continual struggle against them. And  here in the far north, among the high peaks and ridges, there was much  to be feared, even with official winter yet several weeks away.
  Robert began to rub his cold hands, and, unfolding his blanket, he  wrapped it about his body, drawing it well up over his neck and ears.  Tayoga imitated him and Willet, who was soon awakened by the cold  blast, protected himself in a similar manner.
  &#8220;What does the Great Bear think?&#8221; asked the Onondaga.
  The hunter, with his face to the wind, meditated a few moments  before replying.
  &#8220;I was testing that current of air on my face and eyes,&#8221; he said,  &#8220;and, speaking the truth, Tayoga, I don't like it. The wind seemed to  grow colder as I waited to answer you. Listen to the leaves falling  before it! Their rustle tells of a bitter night.&#8221;
  &#8220;And while we freeze in it,&#8221; said Robert, whose imagination was  already in full play, &#8220;the French and Indians build as many and big  fires as they please, and cook before them the juicy game they killed  today.&#8221;
  The hunter was again very thoughtful.
  &#8220;It looks as if we would have to kindle a fire,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and  tomorrow we shall have to hunt bear or deer for ourselves, because we  have food enough left for only one more meal.&#8221;
  &#8220;The face of Areskoui is turned from us,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;We have done  something to anger him, or we have failed to do what he wished, and now  he sends upon us a hard trial to test us and purify us! A great storm  with fierce cold comes!&#8221;
  The wind rose suddenly, and it began to make a sinister hissing  among all the passes and gorges. Robert felt something damp upon his  face, and he brushed away a melting flake of snow. But another and  another took its place and the air was soon filled with white. And the  flakes were most aggressive. Driven by the storm they whipped the  cheeks and eyes of the three, and sought to insert themselves, often  with success, under their collars, even under the edges of the  protecting blankets, and down their backs. Robert, despite himself,  shivered violently and even the hunter was forced to walk vigorously  back and forth in the effort to keep warm. It was evident that the  Onondaga had told the truth, and that the face of Areskoui was in very  fact turned from them.
  Robert awaited the word, looking now and then at Willet, but the  hunter hung on for a long time. The leaves fell in showers before the  storm, making a faint rustling like the last sigh of the departing, and  the snow, driven with so much force, stung his face like hail when it  struck. He was anxious for a fire, and its vital heat, but he was too  proud to speak. He would endure without complaint as much as his  comrades, and he knew that Tayoga, like himself, would wait for the  older man to speak.
  But he could not keep, meanwhile, from thinking of the French and  Indians beside their vast heaps of glowing coals, fed and warmed to  their hearts' content, while the three lay in the dark and bitter cold  of the wilderness. An hour dragged by, then two, then three, but the  storm showed no sign of abating. The sinister screaming of the wind did  not cease and the snow accumulated upon their bodies. At last Willet  said:
  &#8220;We must do it.&#8221;
  &#8220;We have no other choice,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;We have waited as long as  we could to see if Areskoui would turn a favoring face upon us, but his  anger holds. It will not avail, if in our endeavor to escape the  tomahawk of Tandakora, we freeze to death.&#8221;
  The fire decided upon, they took all risks and went about the task  with eagerness. Ordinary men could not have lighted it under such  circumstances, but the three had uncommon skill upon which to draw.  They took the bark from dead wood, and shaved off many splinters,  building up a little heap in the lee of a cliff, which they sheltered  on the windward side with their bodies. Then Willet, working a long  time with his flint and steel, set to it the sparks that grew into a  blaze.
  Robert did not stop with the fire. Noticing the vast amount of dead  wood lying about, as was often the case in the wilderness, he dragged  up many boughs and began to build a wall on the exposed side of the  flames. Willet and Tayoga approving of the idea soon helped him, and  three pairs of willing hands quickly raised the barrier of trunks and  brush to a height of at least a yard.
  &#8220;A happy idea of yours, Robert,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;Now we achieve  two ends at once. Our wall hides the glow of the fire and at the same  time protects us in large measure from the snow and wind.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have bright thoughts now and then,&#8221; said Robert, whose spirits  had returned in full tide. &#8220;You needn't believe you and Tayoga have all  of 'em. I don't believe either of you would have ever thought of this  fine wooden wall. In truth, Dave, I don't know what would become of you  and Tayoga if you didn't have me along with you most all the time! How  good the fire feels! The warmth touches my fingers and goes stealing up  my arms and into my body! It reaches my face too and goes stealing down  to meet the fine heat that makes a channel of my fingers! A glorious  fire, Tayoga! I tell you, a glorious fire, Dave! The finest fire that's  burning anywhere in the world!&#8221;
  &#8220;The quality of a fire depends on the service it gives,&#8221; said the  hunter.
  &#8220;Dagaeoga has many words when he is happy,&#8221; said the Onondaga. &#8220;His  tongue runs on like the pleasant murmur of a brook, but he does it  because Manitou made him that way. The world must have talkers as well  as doers, and it can be said for Lennox that he acts as well as talks.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks, I'm glad you put in the saving clause,&#8221; laughed Robert.  &#8220;But it's a mighty good thing we built our wooden wall. That wind would  cut to the bone if it could get at you.&#8221;
  &#8220;The wind at least will keep the warriors away,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;They  will all stay close in the camp on such a night.&#8221;
  &#8220;And no blame to them,&#8221; murmured the hunter. &#8220;If we weren't in the  Indian country I'd build our own fire five times as big. Now, Robert,  suppose you go to sleep.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't, Dave. You know I slept all the morning, but I'm not  suffering from dullness. I'm imagining things. I'm imagining how much  worse off we'd be if we didn't have flint and steel. I can always find  pleasure in making such contrasts.&#8221;
  But he crouched down lower against the cliff, drew his blanket  closer and spread both hands over the fire, which had now died down  into a glowing mass of coals. He was wondering what they would do on  the morrow, when their food was exhausted. They had not only the storm  to fight, but possible starvation in the days to come. He foresaw that  instead of discovering all the plans of the enemy they would have a  struggle merely to live.
  &#8220;Areskoui must truly be against us, Tayoga,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Who would  have predicted such a storm so early in the season?&#8221;
  &#8220;We are several thousand feet above the sea level,&#8221; said Willet,  &#8220;and that will account for the violent change. I think the wind and  snow will last all tonight, and probably all tomorrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;we'd better gather more wood, build our wall  higher and save ample fuel for the fire.&#8221;
  The other two found the suggestion good, and all three acted upon it  promptly, ranging through the forest about them in search of brushwood,  which they brought back in great quantities. Robert's blood began to  tingle with the activity, and his spirits rose. Now the snow, as it  drove against his face, instead of making him shiver, whipped his  blood. He was the most energetic of the three, and went the farthest,  in the hunt for fallen timber.
  One of his trips took him into the mouth of a little gorge, and, as  he bent down to seize the end of a big stick, he heard just ahead a  rustling that caused him with instinctive caution to straighten up and  spring back, his hand, at the same time, flying to the butt of the  pistol in his belt. A figure, tall and menacing, emerged from the  darkness, and he retreated two or three steps.
  It was his first thought that a warrior stood before him, but reason  told him quickly no Indian was likely to be there, and, then, through  the thick dusk and falling snow, he saw a huge black bear, erect on his  hind legs, and looking at him with little red eyes. The animal was so  near that the lad could see his expression, and it was not anger but  surprise and inquiry. He divined at once that this particular bear had  never seen a human being before, and, having been roused from some warm  den by Robert's advance, he was asking what manner of creature the  stranger and intruder might be.
  Robert's first impulse was one of friendliness. It did not occur to  him to shoot the bear, although the big fellow, fine and fat, would  furnish all the meat they needed for a long time. Instead his large  blue eyes gave back the curious gaze of the little red ones, and, for a  little space, the two stood there, face to face, with no thought of  danger or attack on the part of either.
  &#8220;If you'll let me alone I'll let you alone,&#8221; said the lad.
  The bear growled, but it was a kindly, reassuring growl.
  &#8220;I didn't mean to disturb you. I was looking for wood, not for  bear.&#8221;
  Another growl, but of a thoroughly placid nature.
  &#8220;Go wherever you please and I'll return to the camp with this fallen  sapling.&#8221;
  A third growl, now ingratiating.
  &#8220;It's a cold night, with fire and shelter the chief needs, and you  and I wouldn't think of fighting.&#8221;
  A fourth growl which clearly disclosed the note of friendship and  understanding.
  &#8220;We're in agreement, I see. Good night, I wish you well.&#8221;
  A fifth growl, which had the tone of benevolent farewell, and the  bear, dropping on all fours, disappeared in the brush. Robert, whose  fancy had been alive and leaping, returned to the camp rather pleased  with himself, despite the fact that about three hundred pounds of  excellent food had walked away undisturbed.
  &#8220;I ran upon a big bear,&#8221; he said to the hunter and the Onondaga.
  &#8220;I heard no shot,&#8221; said Willet.
  &#8220;No, I didn't fire. Neither my impulse nor my will told me to do so.  The bear looked at me in such brotherly fashion that I could never have  sent a bullet into him. I'd rather go hungry.&#8221;
  Neither Willet nor Tayoga had any rebuke for him.
  &#8220;Doubtless the soul of a good warrior had gone into the bear and  looked out at you,&#8221; said the Onondaga with perfect sincerity. &#8220;It is  sometimes so. It is well that you did not fire upon him or the face of  Areskoui would have remained turned from us too long.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's just the way I felt about it,&#8221; said Robert, who had great  tolerance for Iroquois beliefs. &#8220;His eyes seemed fully human to me,  and, although I had my pistol in my belt and my hand when I first saw  him flew to its butt, I made no attempt to draw it. I have no regrets  because I let him go.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor have we,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;Now I think we can afford to rest  again. We can build our wall six feet high if we want to and have wood  enough left over to feed a fire for several days.&#8221;
  The two lads, the white and the red, crouched once more in the lee  of the cliff, while the hunter put two fresh sticks on the coals. But  little of the snow reached them where they lay, wrapped well in their  blankets, and all care disappeared from Robert's mind. Inured to the  wilderness he ignored what would have been discomfort to others. The  trails they had left in the snow when they hunted wood would soon be  covered up by the continued fall, and for the night, at least, there  would be no danger from the warriors. He felt an immense comfort and  security, and by-and-by fell asleep again. Tayoga soon followed him to  slumberland, and Willet once more watched alone.
  Tayoga relieved Willet about two o'clock in the morning, but they  did not awaken Robert at all in the course of the night. They knew that  he would upbraid them for not summoning him to do his share, but there  would be abundant chance for him to serve later on as a sentinel.
  The Onondaga did not arouse his comrades until long past daylight,  and then they opened their eyes to a white world, clear and cold. The  snow had ceased falling, but it lay several inches deep on the ground,  and all the leaves had been stripped from the trees, on the high point  where they lay. The coals still glowed, and they heated over them the  last of their venison and bear meat, which they ate with keen appetite,  and then considered what they must do, concluding at last to descend  into the lower country and hunt game.
  &#8220;We can do nothing at present so far as the war is concerned,&#8221; said  Willet. &#8220;An army must eat before it can fight, but it's likely that the  snow and cold will stop the operations of the French and Indians also.  While we're saving our own lives other operations will be delayed, and  later on we may find Garay going back.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is best to go down the mountain and to the south,&#8221; said Tayoga,  in his precise school English. &#8220;It may be that the snow has fallen only  on the high peaks and ridges. Then we'll be sure to find game, and  perhaps other food which we can procure without bullets.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think we'd better move now?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;We must send out a scout first,&#8221; said Willet.
  It was agreed that Tayoga should go, and in about two hours he  returned with grave news. The warriors were out again, hunting in the  snow, and although unconscious of it themselves they formed an almost  complete ring about the three, a ring which they must undertake to  break through now in full daylight, and with the snow ready to leave a  broad trail of all who passed.
  &#8220;They would be sure to see our path,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;Even the short  trail I made when I went forth exposes us to danger, and we must trust  to luck that they will not see it. There is nothing for us to do, but  to remain hidden here, until the next night comes. It is quite certain  that the face of Areskoui is still turned from us. What have we done  that is displeasing to the Sun God?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't recall anything,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;Perhaps it is not what we have done but what we have failed to do,  though whatever it is Areskoui has willed that we lie close another  day.&#8221;
  &#8220;And starve,&#8221; said Robert ruefully.
  &#8220;And starve,&#8221; repeated the Onondaga.
  The three crouched once more under the lee of the cliff, but toward  noon they built their wooden wall another foot higher, driven to the  work by the threatening aspect of the sky, which turned to a somber  brown. The wind sprang up again, and it had an edge of damp.
  &#8220;Soon it will rain,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and it will be a bitter cold  rain. Much of the snow will melt and then freeze again, coating the  earth with ice. It will make it more difficult for us to travel and the  hunting that we need so much must be delayed. Then we'll grow hungrier  and hungrier.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stop it, Tayoga,&#8221; exclaimed Robert. &#8220;I believe you're torturing me  on purpose. I'm hungry now.&#8221;
  &#8220;But that is nothing to what Dagaeoga will be tonight, after he has  gone many hours without food. Then he will think of the juicy venison,  and of the tender steak of the young bear, and of the fine fish from  the mountain streams, and he will remember how he has enjoyed them in  the past, but it will be only a memory. The fish that he craves will be  swimming in the clear waters, and the deer and the bear will be far  away, safe from his bullet.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't know you had so much malice in your composition, Tayoga,  but there's one consolation; if I suffer you suffer also.&#8221;
  The Onondaga laughed.
  &#8220;It will give Dagaeoga a chance to test himself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know  already that he is brave in battle and skillful on the trail, and now  we will see how he can sit for days and nights without anything to eat,  and not complain. He will be a hero, he will draw in his belt notch by  notch, and never say a word.&#8221;
  &#8220;That will do, Tayoga,&#8221; interrupted the hunter. &#8220;While you play upon  Robert's nerves you play upon mine also, and they tell me you've said  enough. Actually I'm beginning to feel famished.&#8221;
  Tayoga laughed once more.
  &#8220;While I jest with you I jest also with myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now we'll  sleep, since there is nothing else to do.&#8221;
  He drew his blanket up to his eyes, leaned against the stony wall  and slept. Robert could not imitate him. As the long afternoon, one of  the longest he had ever known, trailed its slow length away, he studied  the forest in front of them, where the cold and mournful rain was still  falling, a rain that had at least one advantage, as it had long since  obliterated all traces of a trail left by Tayoga on his scouting  expedition, although search as he would he could find no other profit  in it.
  Night came, the rain ceased, and, as Tayoga had predicted, the  intense cold that arrived with the dark, froze it quickly, covering the  earth with a hard and polished glaze, smoother and more treacherous  than glass. It was impossible for the present to undertake flight over  such a surface, with a foe naturally vigilant at hand, and they made  themselves as comfortable as they could, while they awaited another  day. Now Robert began to draw in his belt, while a hunger that was  almost too fierce to be endured assailed him. His was a strong body,  demanding much nourishment, and it cried out to him for relief. He  tried to forget in sleep that he was famished, but he only dozed a  while to awaken to a hunger more poignant than ever.
  Yet he said never a word, but, as the night with its illimitable  hours passed, he grew defiant of difficulties and dangers, all of which  became but little things in presence of his hunger. It was his impulse  to storm the Indian camp itself and seize what he wanted of the  supplies there, but his reason told him the thought was folly. Then he  tried to forget about the steaks of bear and deer, and the delicate  little fish from the mountain stream that Tayoga had mentioned, but  they would return before his eyes with so much vividness that he almost  believed he saw them in reality.
  Dawn came again, and they had now been twenty-four hours without  food. The pangs of hunger were assailing all three fiercely, but they  did not yet dare go forth, as the morning was dark and gloomy, with a  resumption of the fierce, driving rain, mingled with hail, which  rattled now and then like bullets on their wooden wall.
  Robert shivered in his blanket, not so much from actual cold as from  the sinister aspect of the world, and his sensitive imagination, which  always pictured both good and bad in vivid colors, foresaw the enormous  difficulties that would confront them. Hunger tore at him, as with the  talons of a dragon, and he felt himself growing weak, although his  constitution was so strong that the time for a decline in vitality had  not yet really come. He was all for going forth in the storm and  seeking game in the slush and cold, ignoring the French and Indian  danger. But he knew the hunter and the Onondaga would not hear to it,  and so he waited in silence, hot anger swelling in his heart against  the foes who kept him there. Unable to do anything else, he finally  closed his eyes that he might shut from his view the gray and chilly  world that was so hostile.
  &#8220;Is Areskoui turning his face toward us, Tayoga?&#8221; he asked after a  long wait.
  &#8220;No, Dagaeoga. Our unknown sin is not yet expiated. The day grows  blacker, colder and wetter.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I grow hungrier and hungrier. If we kill deer or bear we must  kill three of each at the same time, because I intend to eat one all by  myself, and I demand that he be large and fat, too. I suppose we'll go  out of this place some time or other.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'd better make up our minds to do it before it's too late. I  feel my nerves and tissues decaying already.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's only your fancy, Dagaeoga. You can exist a week without food.&#8221;
  &#8220;A week, Tayoga! I don't want to exist a week without food! I  absolutely refuse to do so!&#8221;
  &#8220;The choice is not yours, now, O Dagaeoga. The greatest gift you can  have is patience. The warrior, Daatgadose, of the clan of the Bear, of  the nation Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee, even as I  am, hemmed in by enemies in the forest, and with his powder and bullets  gone, lay in hiding ten days without food once passing his lips, and  took no lasting hurt from it. You, O Dagaeoga, will surely do as well,  and I can give you many other examples for your emulation.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stop, Tayoga. Sometimes I'm sorry you speak such precise English.  If you didn't you couldn't have so much sport with a bad situation.&#8221;
  The Onondaga laughed deeply and with unction. He knew that Robert  was not complaining, that he merely talked to fill in the time, and he  went on with stories of illustrious warriors and chiefs among his  people who had literally defied hunger and thirst and who had lived  incredible periods without either food or water. Willet listened in  silence, but with approval. He knew that any kind of talk would cheer  them and strengthen them for the coming test which was bound to be  severe.
  Feeling that no warriors would be within sight at such a time they  built their fire anew and hovered over the flame and the coals, drawing  a sort of sustenance from the warmth. But when the day was nearly gone  and there was no change in the sodden skies Robert detected in himself  signs of weakness that he knew were not the product of fancy. Every  inch of his healthy young body cried out for food, and, not receiving  it, began to rebel and lose vigor.
  Again he was all for going forth and risking everything, and he  noticed with pleasure that the hunter began to shift about and to peer  into the forest as if some plan for action was turning in his mind. But  he said nothing, resolved to leave it all to Tayoga and Willet, and  by-and-by, in the dark, to which his eyes had grown accustomed, he saw  the two exchanging glances. He was able to read these looks. The hunter  said: &#8220;We must try it. The time has come.&#8221; The Onondaga replied: &#8220;Yes,  it is not wise to wait longer, lest we grow too feeble for a great  effort.&#8221; The hunter rejoined: &#8220;Then it is agreed,&#8221; and the Onondaga  said: &#8220;If our comrade thinks so too.&#8221; Both turned their eyes to young  Lennox who said aloud: &#8220;It's what I've been waiting for a long time.  The sooner we leave the better pleased I'll be.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;in an hour we'll start south, going down the  trail between the high cliffs, and we'll trust that either we've  expiated our sin, whatever it was, or that Areskoui has forgiven us. It  will be terrible traveling, but we can't wait any longer.&#8221;
  They wrapped their blankets about their bodies as additional  covering, and, at the time appointed, left their rude shelter. Yet when  they were away from its protection it did not seem so rude. When their  moccasins sank in the slush and the snow and rain beat upon their  faces, it was remembered as the finest little shelter in the world. The  bodies of all three regretted it, but their wills and dire necessity  sent them on.
  The hunter led, young Lennox followed and Tayoga came last, their  feet making a slight sighing sound as they sank in the half-melted snow  and ice now several inches deep. Robert wore fine high moccasins of  tanned mooseskin, much stronger and better than ordinary deerskin, but  before long he felt the water entering them and chilling him to the  bone. Nevertheless, keeping his resolution in mind, and, knowing that  the others were in the same plight, he made no complaint but trudged  steadily on, three or four feet behind Willet, who chose the way that  now led sharply downward. Once more he realized what an enormous factor  changes in temperature were in the lives of borderers and how they  could defeat supreme forethought and the greatest skill. Winter with  its snow and sleet was now the silent but none the less potent ally of  the French and Indians in preventing their escape.
  They toiled on two or three miles, not one of the three speaking.  The sleet and hail thickened. In spite of the blanket and the deerskin  tunic it made its way along his neck and then down his shoulders and  chest, the chill that went downward meeting the chill that came upward  from his feet, now almost frozen. He could not recall ever before  having been so miserable of both mind and body. He did not know it just  then, but the lack of nourishment made him peculiarly susceptible to  mental and physical depression. The fires of youth were not burning in  his veins, and his vitality had been reduced at least one half.
  Now, that terrible hunger, although he had striven to fight it,  assailed him once more, and his will weakened slowly. What were those  tales Tayoga had been telling about men going a week or ten days  without food? They were clearly incredible. He had been less than two  days without it, and his tortures were those of a man at the stake.
  Willet's eyes, from natural keenness and long training, were able to  pierce the dusk and he showed the way, steep and slippery though it  was, with infallible certainty. They were on a lower slope, where by  some freak of the weather there was snow instead of slush, when he bent  down and examined the path with critical and anxious eyes. Robert and  Tayoga waited in silence, until the hunter straightened up again. Then  he said:
  &#8220;A war party has gone down the pass ahead of us. There were about  twenty men in it, and it's not more than two hours beyond us. Whether  it's there to cut us off, or has moved by mere chance, I don't know,  but the effect is just the same. If we keep on we'll run into it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose we try the ascent and get out over the ridges,&#8221; said  Robert.
  Willet looked up at the steep and lofty slopes on either side.
  &#8220;It's tremendously bad footing,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;and will take heavy  toll of our strength, but I see no other way. It would be foolish for  us to go on and walk straight into the hands of our enemies. What say  you, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;There is but a single choice and that a desperate one. We must try  the summits.&#8221;
  They delayed no longer, and, Willet still leading, began the  frightful climb, choosing the westward cliff which towered above them a  full four hundred feet, and, like the one that faced it, almost  precipitous. Luckily many evergreens grew along the slope and using  them as supports they toiled slowly upward. Now and then, in spite of  every precaution, they sent down heaps of snow that rumbled as it fell  into the pass. Every time one of these miniature avalanches fell Robert  shivered. His fancy, so vitally alive, pictured savages in the pass,  attracted by the noise, and soon to fire at his helpless figure,  outlined against the slope.
  &#8220;Can't you go a little faster?&#8221; he said to Willet, who was just  ahead.
  &#8220;It wouldn't be wise,&#8221; replied the hunter. &#8220;We mustn't risk a fall.  But I know why you want to hurry on, Robert. It's the fear of being  shot in the back as you climb. I feel it too, but it's only fancy with  both of us.&#8221;
  Robert said no more, but, calling upon his will, bent his mind to  their task. Above him was the dusky sky and the summit seemed to tower  a mile away, but he knew that it was only sixty or seventy yards now,  and he took his luxurious imagination severely in hand. At such a time  he must deal only in realities and he subjected all that he saw to  mathematical calculation. Sixty or seventy yards must be sixty or  seventy yards only and not a mile.
  After a time that seemed interminable Willet's figure disappeared  over the cliff, and, with a gasp, Robert followed, Tayoga coming  swiftly after. The three were so tired, their vitality was so reduced  that they lay down in the snow, and drew long, painful breaths. When  some measure of strength was restored they stood up and surveyed the  place where they stood, a bleak summit over which the wind blew  sharply. Nothing grew there but low bushes, and they felt that, while  they may have escaped the war band, their own physical case was worse  instead of better. Both cold and wind were more severe and a bitter  hail beat upon them. It was obvious that Areskoui did not yet forgive,  although it must surely be a sin of ignorance, of omission and not of  commission, with the equal certainty that a sin of such type could not  be unforgivable for all time.
  &#8220;We seem to be on a ridge that runs for a great distance,&#8221; said  Tayoga. &#8220;Suppose we continue along the comb of it. At least we cannot  make ourselves any worse off than we are now.&#8221;
  They toiled on, now and then falling on the slippery trail, their  vitality sinking lower and lower. Occasionally they had glimpses of a  vast desolate region under a somber sky, peaks and ridges and slopes  over which clouds hovered, the whole seeming to resent the entry of man  and to offer to him every kind of resistance.
  Robert was now wet through and through. No part of his body had  escaped and he knew that his vitality was at such a low ebb that at  least seventy-five per cent, of it was gone. He wanted to stop, his  cold and aching limbs cried out for rest, and he craved heat at the  cost of every risk, but his will was still firm, and he would not be  the first to speak. It was Willet who suggested when they came to a  slight dip that they make an effort to build a fire.
  &#8220;The human body, no matter how strong it may be naturally, and how  much it may be toughened by experience, will stand only so much,&#8221; he  said.
  They were constantly building fires in the wilderness, but the fire  they built that morning was the hardest of them all to start. They  selected, as usual, the lee of a rocky uplift, and, then by the patient  use of flint and steel, and, after many failures, they kindled a blaze  that would last. But in their reduced state the labor exhausted them,  and it was some time before they drew any life from the warmth. When  the circulation had been restored somewhat they piled on more wood,  taking the chance of being seen. They even went so far as to build a  second fire, that they might sit between the two and dry themselves  more rapidly. Then they waited in silence the coming of the dawn.
