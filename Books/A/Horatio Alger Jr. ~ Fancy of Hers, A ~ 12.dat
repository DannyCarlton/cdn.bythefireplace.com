  The day of examination came, and the small schoolroom was thronged  with visitors. The exercises passed off in the most satisfactory  manner. Squire Hadley, as chairman of the School Committee, made the  first speech. It was not a model of eloquence, but he made it clear  that he considered the school a success and took credit to himself for  engaging so competent a teacher. Mr. Wilson followed. He too, expressed  hearty approval of the exercises, and tendered his cordial   congratulations to Miss Frost for remarkable success in inspiring the  scholars with a love of learning. 
  He hoped the town would be able to retain the services of so  accomplished an instructress. To him succeeded Adoniram Fry, who, in a  jocular way, lamented that as a boy it had not been in his power to be  a scholar under Miss Frost's instruction. All were complimentary, and  Mabel's cheeks were flushed with pleasure. 
  Randolph Chester was not present at the closing exercises. Neither  were the Raymonds. The engagement had leaked out, and therefore their  absence did not excite surprise. It was ascertained that they had  driven to a neighboring town. It was not discovered, however, till  later, what their errand was. They drove at once to the residence of a  clergyman, and when they returned Clementina was Mrs. Randolph Chester.  Clementina herself had artfully hinted how romantic it would be, and  how people would be taken by surprise. Mr. Chester cared nothing for  this; but it occurred to him that Mabel would be mortified on learning  how quickly he had been consoled for her loss. Poor Mr. Chester! In  after years he looked upon this as the most idiotic act of his life. 
  In the evening Allan Thorpe called and invited Mabel to go out for  a walk. It was a beautiful moonlight night. They walked slowly to the  pond, which was not far away, and sat down on a rustic seat beneath a  wide spreading oak. They had been talking on various things for some  time, when a sudden silence came upon both. It was at length broken by  the young artist. 
  &quot;I hope you will forgive me for bringing you here,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Why should you want forgiveness?&quot; she asked, very much surprised. 
  &quot;Because I brought you here with a special object in view. Rebuke  me if you will, but &#151; Mabel, I love you.&quot; 
  She did not seem much surprised. 
  &quot;How long has it been so?&quot; she asked in a low voice. 
  &quot;I began to love you,&quot; he answered, &quot;when I first saw you at the  artists' reception. But you were so far removed from me that I did not  dare to avow it, even to myself. You were a rich social queen, and I  was a poor man. I should never have dared to tell you all this if you  had not lost your wealth.&quot; 
  &quot;Does this make me any more worthy?&quot; asked Mabel smiling. 
  &quot;It has brought you nearer to me. When I saw how bravely you met  adverse fortune; when I saw a girl brought up to every luxury, as you  were, quietly devoting herself to teaching a village school, I  rejoiced. I admired you more than ever, and I resolved to win you if  possible. Can you give me a hope, Mabel? 
  He bent over her with a look of tender affection in his manly face. 
  &quot;I won't keep you in suspense, Allan,&quot; she said with an answering  look. &quot;I have not known you long but long enough to trust my future in  your hands.&quot; 
  After a while Allan Thorpe began to discuss his plans and hopes for  the future. 
  &quot;I am beginning to be successful,&quot; he said. &quot;I can, even now,  support you in a modest way, and with health I feel assured of a larger  &#151; I hope a much larger &#151; income in time. I can relieve you from  teaching at once.&quot; 
  Mabel smiled. 
  &quot;But suppose I do not consider it a burden. Suppose I like it.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you can teach me.&quot; 
  &quot;It might become monotonous to have only one pupil.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope not,&quot; said Allan earnestly. 
  When he pressed her to name an early day for their marriage, Mabel  said: &quot;Before we go any further, I have a confession to make. I hope it  won't be disagreeable to you.&quot; 
  He silently inclined his head to listen. 
  &quot;Who told you I had lost my property?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;No one. I inferred it from finding you here, teaching a village   school for seven dollars a week,&quot; replied Allan. 
  &quot;What! Have you inquired my income so exactly? I fear you are  mercenary.&quot; 
  &quot;I can remember the time &#151; not so long since, either &#151; when I  earned less than that by my art. But, Mabel, what do you mean by your  questions? Of course you have lost your property.&quot; 
  &quot;Then my banker has failed to inform me of it. No, Allan, I am no  poorer than I ever was.&quot; 
  &quot;Why, then, did you become a teacher?&quot; asked Allan Thorpe,  bewildered. 
  &quot;Because I wished to be of some service to my kind; because I was  tired of the hollow frivolity of the fashionable world. I don't regret  my experiment. I never expected to be so richly rewarded.&quot; 
  &quot;And you, as rich as ever, bestow your hand on a poor artist?&quot; he  exclaimed almost incredulously. 
  &quot;Unless the poor artist withdraws his offer,&quot; she answered with a  smile. 
  Of the conversation that followed it is needful only to report that  it was mutually decided that Mabel's secret was to be kept for the  present. She was still to be the poor school teacher in the eyes of  Granville. The marriage was to take place in October, Mabel being  reconciled to the briefness of the engagement by the representation  that October would be a favorable month for a voyage to Europe. They  had already decided to spend two years in Italy. Mabel had always  longed to see Italy, and it would no doubt be full of delightful  opportunities of improvement in his art for Allan Thorpe. 
  Mabel's engagement made a second sensation, Mr. Chester's elopement  being the first. Many were the congratulations offered, though these  were mingled with regret that so good a teacher should be lost to the  village. Mr. Chester heard the news in gloomy silence. His wife  remarked patronizingly that it was a very suitable match, for &quot;both are  as poor as poverty, goodness knows!&quot; 
  The wedding took place quietly in October, and in Granville. No one  as yet knew that Mabel was other than she seemed, though Mr. Wilson had  been informed of her real name. When, however, a check for five hundred  dollars was handed to him as his fee for celebrating the marriage, he  faltered in amazement, as he inquired, &quot;What does this mean, Allan?&quot; 
  &quot;It means, my dear uncle, that Mabel is not only rich in every  virtue and every accomplishment, but she is also burdened with a large  portion of this world's goods. This is my first opportunity for saying  what she authorized me to say, that we will gladly defray Ralph's  expenses through college whenever you are ready to send him.&quot; 
  &quot;God is indeed good to me and mine!&quot; said the minister, his face  beaming with happiness. &quot;My dear child&quot; &#151; this was to Mabel &#151; &quot;may  you always be as happy as you have made us.&quot; 
  &quot;You have made us all happy, dear Mabel,&quot; said her husband. &quot;It was  indeed a blessed day when you came to Granville to teach.&quot;
