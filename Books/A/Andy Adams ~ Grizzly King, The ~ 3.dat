  A mile down the valley Jim Langdon stopped his horse where the  spruce and balsam timber thinned out at the mouth of a coulee, looked  ahead of him for a breathless moment or two, and then with an audible  gasp of pleasure swung his right leg over so that his knee crooked  restfully about the horn of his saddle, and waited.
  Two or three hundred yards behind him, still buried in the timber,  Otto was having trouble with Dishpan, a contumacious pack-mare. Langdon  grinned happily as he listened to the other's vociferations, which  threatened Dishpan with every known form of torture and punishment,  from instant disembowelment to the more merciful end of losing her  brain through the medium of a club. He grinned because Otto's  vocabulary descriptive of terrible things always impending over the  heads of his sleek and utterly heedless pack-horses was one of his  chief joys. He knew that if Dishpan should elect to turn somersaults  while diamond-hitched under her pack, big, good-natured Bruce Otto  would do nothing more than make the welkin ring with his terrible,  blood-curdling protest.
  One after another the six horses of their outfit appeared out of the  timber, and last of all rode the mountain man. He was gathered like a  partly released spring in his saddle, an attitude born of years in the  mountains, and because of a certain difficulty he had in distributing  gracefully his six-foot-two-inch length of flesh and bone astride a  mountain cayuse.
  Upon his appearance Langdon dismounted, and turned his eyes again up  the valley. The stubbly blond beard on his face did not conceal the  deep tan painted there by weeks of exposure in the mountains; he had  opened his shirt at the throat, exposing a neck darkened by sun and  wind; his eyes were of a keen, searching blue-gray, and they quested  the country ahead of him now with the joyous intentness of the hunter  and the adventurer.
  Langdon was thirty-five. A part of his life he spent in the wild  places; the other part he spent in writing about the things he found  there. His companion was five years his junior in age, but had the  better of him by six inches in length of anatomy, if those additional  inches could be called an advantage. Bruce thought they were not. &#8220;The  devil of it is I ain't done growin' yet!&#8221; he often explained.
  He rode up now and unlimbered himself. Langdon pointed ahead.
  &#8220;Did you ever see anything to beat that?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Fine country,&#8221; agreed Bruce. &#8220;Mighty good place to camp, too, Jim.  There ought to be caribou in this range, an' bear. We need some fresh  meat. Gimme a match, will you?&#8221;
  It had come to be a habit with them to light both their pipes with  one match when possible. They performed this ceremony now while viewing  the situation. As he puffed the first luxurious cloud of smoke from his  bulldog, Langdon nodded toward the timber from which they had just  come.
  &#8220;Fine place for our tepee,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dry wood, running water, and  the first good balsam we've struck in a week for our beds. We can  hobble the horses in that little open plain we crossed a quarter of a  mile back. I saw plenty of buffalo grass and a lot of wild timothy.&#8221;
  He looked at his watch.
  &#8220;It's only three o'clock. We might go on. But&#8212;what do you say?  Shall we stick for a day or two, and see what this country looks like?&#8221;
  &#8220;Looks good to me,&#8221; said Bruce.
  He sat down as he spoke, with his back to a rock, and over his knee  he levelled a long brass telescope. From his saddle Langdon unslung a  binocular glass imported from Paris. The telescope was a relic of the  Civil War. Together, their shoulders touching as they steadied  themselves against the rock, they studied the rolling slopes and the  green sides of the mountains ahead of them.
  They were in the Big Game country, and what Langdon called the  Unknown. So far as he and Bruce Otto could discover, no other white man  had ever preceded them. It was a country shut in by tremendous ranges,  through which it had taken them twenty days of sweating toil to make a  hundred miles.
  That afternoon they had crossed the summit of the Great Divide that  split the skies north and south, and through their glasses they were  looking now upon the first green slopes and wonderful peaks of the  Firepan Mountains. To the northward&#8212;and they had been travelling  north&#8212;was the Skeena River; on the west and south were the Babine  range and waterways; eastward, over the Divide, was the Driftwood, and  still farther eastward the Ominica range and the tributaries of the  Finley. They had started from civilization on the tenth day of May and  this was the thirtieth of June.
  As Langdon looked through his glasses he believed that at last they  had reached the bourne of their desires. For nearly two months they had  worked to get beyond the trails of men, and they had succeeded. There  were no hunters here. There were no prospectors. The valley ahead of  them was filled with golden promise, and as he sought out the first of  its mystery and its wonder his heart was filled with the deep and  satisfying joy which only men like Langdon can fully understand. To his  friend and comrade, Bruce Otto, with whom he had gone five times into  the North country, all mountains and all valleys were very much alike;  he was born among them, he had lived among them all his life, and he  would probably die among them.
  It was Bruce who gave him a sudden sharp nudge with his elbow.
  &#8220;I see the heads of three caribou crossing a dip about a mile and a  half up the valley,&#8221; he said, without taking his eyes from the  telescope.
  &#8220;And I see a Nanny and her kid on the black shale of that first  mountain to the right,&#8221; replied Langdon. &#8220;And, by George, there's a Sky  Pilot looking down on her from a crag a thousand feet above the shale!  He's got a beard a foot long. Bruce, I'll bet we've struck a regular  Garden of Eden!&#8221;
  &#8220;Looks it,&#8221; vouchsafed Bruce, coiling up his long legs to get a  better rest for his telescope. &#8220;If this ain't a sheep an' bear country,  I've made the worst guess I ever made in my life.&#8221;
  For five minutes they looked, without a word passing between them.  Behind them their horses were nibbling hungrily in the thick, rich  grass. The sound of the many waters in the mountains droned in their  ears, and the valley seemed sleeping in a sea of sunshine. Langdon  could think of nothing more comparable than that&#8212;slumber. The valley  was like a great, comfortable, happy cat, and the sounds they heard,  all commingling in that pleasing drone, was its drowsy purring. He was  focussing his glass a little more closely on the goat standing  watchfully on its crag, when Otto spoke again.
  &#8220;I see a grizzly as big as a house!&#8221; he announced quietly.
  Bruce seldom allowed his equanimity to be disturbed, except by the  pack-horses. Thrilling news like this he always introduced as  unconcernedly as though speaking of a bunch of violets.
  Langdon sat up with a jerk.
  &#8220;Where?&#8221; he demanded.
  He leaned over to get the range of the other's telescope, every  nerve in his body suddenly aquiver.
  &#8220;See that slope on the second shoulder, just beyond the ravine over  there?&#8221; said Bruce, with one eye closed and the other still glued to  the telescope. &#8220;He's halfway up, digging out a gopher.&#8221;
  Langdon focussed his glass on the slope, and a moment later an  excited gasp came from him.
  &#8220;See 'im?&#8221; asked Bruce.
  &#8220;The glass has pulled him within four feet of my nose,&#8221; replied  Langdon. &#8220;Bruce, that's the biggest grizzly in the Rocky Mountains!&#8221;
  &#8220;If he ain't, he's his twin brother,&#8221; chuckled the packer, without  moving a muscle. &#8220;He beats your eight-footer by a dozen inches, Jimmy!  An'&#8221;&#8212;he paused at this psychological moment to pull a plug of black  MacDonald from his pocket and bite off a mouthful, without taking the  telescope from his eye&#8212;&#8220;an' the wind is in our favour an' he's as busy  as a flea!&#8221; he finished.
  Otto unwound himself and rose to his feet, and Langdon jumped up  briskly. In such situations as this there was a mutual understanding  between them which made words unnecessary. They led the eight horses  back into the edge of the timber and tied them there, took their rifles  from the leather holsters, and each was careful to put a sixth  cartridge in the chamber of his weapon. Then for a matter of two  minutes they both studied the slope and its approaches with their naked  eyes.
  &#8220;We can slip up the ravine,&#8221; suggested Langdon.
  Bruce nodded.
  &#8220;I reckon it's a three-hundred-yard shot from there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's  the best we can do. He'd get our wind if we went below 'im. If it was a  couple o' hours earlier&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;We'd climb over the mountain and come down on him from<I> above</I>!&#8221; exclaimed Langdon, laughing.
  &#8220;Bruce, you're the most senseless idiot on the face of the globe  when it comes to climbing mountains! You'd climb over Hardesty or  Geikie to shoot a goat from above, even though you could get him from  the valley without any work at all. I'm glad it isn't morning. We can  get that bear from the ravine!&#8221;
  &#8220;Mebbe,&#8221; said Bruce, and they started.
  They walked openly over the green, flower-carpeted meadows ahead of  them. Until they came within at least half a mile of the grizzly there  was no danger of him seeing them. The wind had shifted, and was almost  in their faces. Their swift walk changed to a dog-trot, and they swung  in nearer to the slope, so that for fifteen minutes a huge knoll  concealed the grizzly. In another ten minutes they came to the ravine,  a narrow, rock-littered and precipitous gully worn in the mountainside  by centuries of spring floods gushing down from the snow-peaks above.  Here they made cautious observation.
  The big grizzly was perhaps six hundred yards up the slope, and  pretty close to three hundred yards from the nearest point reached by  the gully.
  Bruce spoke in a whisper now.
  &#8220;You go up an' do the stalkin', Jimmy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That bear's goin'  to do one of two things if you miss or only wound 'im&#8212;one o' three,  mebbe: he's going to investigate<I> you</I>, or he's going up over the  break, or he's comin' down in the valley&#8212;this way. We can't keep 'im  from goin' over the break, an' if he tackles you&#8212;just summerset it  down the gully. You can beat 'im out. He's most apt to come this way if  you don't get 'im, so I'll wait here. Good luck to you, Jimmy!&#8221;
  With this he went out and crouched behind a rock, where he could  keep an eye on the grizzly, and Langdon began to climb quietly up the  boulder-strewn gully.
