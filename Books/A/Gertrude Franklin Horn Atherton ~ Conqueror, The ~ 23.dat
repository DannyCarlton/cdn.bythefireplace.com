Early in August, 1772, Mr. Cruger sent him on a business tour to several  of the neighbouring Islands, including the great <i>entrepot</i> of the West  Indies,--St. Thomas. Despite the season, the prospect of no wind for  days at a time, or winds in which no craft could live, Alexander  trembled with delight at the idea of visiting the bustling brilliant  versatile town of Charlotte Amalie, in whose harbour there were  sometimes one hundred and eighty ships, where one might meet in a day  men of every clime, and whose beauty was as famous as her wealth and  importance. How often Alexander had stared at the blue line of the hills  above her! Forty miles away, within the range of his vision, was a bit  of the great world, the very pivot of maritime trade, and one cause and  another had prevented him from so much as putting his foot on a sloop  whose sails were spread.    
As soon as the details of his tour were settled he rode out to the  plantations to take leave of his relatives. Mrs. Mitchell, who barred  the hurricane windows every time, the wind rose between July and  November, and sat with the barometer in her hand when the palms began to  bend, wept a torrent and implored him to abstain from the madness of  going to sea at that time of the year. Her distress was so acute and  real that Alexander, who loved her, forgot his exultation and would have  renounced the trip, had he not given his word to Mr. Cruger.    
"I'll be careful, and I'll ride out the day after I return," he said,  arranging his aunt on the sofa with her smelling-bottle, an office he  had performed many times. "You know the first wind of the hurricane is a  delight to the sailor, and we never shall be far from land. I'm in  command, and I'll promise you to make for shore at the first sign of  danger. Then I shall be as safe as here."    
His aunt sighed for fully a minute. "If I only could believe that you  would be careful about anything. But you are quite a big boy now, almost  sixteen, and ought to be old enough to take care of yourself."    
"If I could persuade you that I am not quite a failure at keeping the  breath in my body we both should be happier. However, I vow not to set  sail from any island if a hurricane is forming, and to make for port  every time the wind freshens."    
"Listen for that terrible roar in the southeast, and take my  barometer--Heaven knows what barometers are made for; there are not  three on the Island. I shall drive in to church every Sunday and besiege  Heaven with my supplications."    
"Well, spare me a breeze or I shall pray for a hurricane."    
He did not see Mrs. Lytton or James, but Mr. Lytton had scant  apprehension of hurricanes, and was only concerned lest his nephew roll  about in the trough of the sea under an August sun for weeks at a time.  "That's when a man doesn't repent of his sins; he knows there is nothing  worse to come," he said. "I'd rather have a hurricane," and Alexander  nodded. Mr. Lytton counted out a small bag of pieces of eight and told  the boy to buy his aunt a silk gown in Charlotte Amalie. "I've noticed  that if it's all one colour you're not so sure to have it accepted with  a sigh of resignation," he said. "But be careful of plaids and stripes."  And Alexander, with deeper misgivings than Mrs. Mitchell had inspired,  accepted the commission and rode away.    
He set sail on the following day, and made his tour of the lesser  islands under a fair breeze. Late in the month he entered the harbour of  St. Thomas, and was delighted to find at least fifty ships in port,  despite the season. It was an unusually busy year, and he had dared to  hope for crowded waters and streets; exquisite as Charlotte Amalie might  be to look upon, he wanted something more than a lovely casket.    
The town is set on three conical foot-hills, which bulge at equal  distances against an almost perpendicular mountain, the tip, it is said,  of a range whose foundations are four miles below. The three sections of  the town sweep from base to pointed apex with a symmetry so perfect,  their houses are so light and airy of architecture, so brilliant and  varied of colour, that they suggest having been called into being by the  stroke of a magician's wand to gratify the whim of an Eastern potentate.  Surely, they are a vast seraglio, a triple collection of pleasure houses  where captive maidens are content and nautch girls dance with feet like  larks. Business, commerce, one cannot associate with this enchanting  vista; nor cockroaches as long as one's foot, scorpions, tarantulas, and  rats.    
When Alexander was in the town he found that the houses were of stone,  and that one long street on the level connected the three divisions.  Flights of steps, hewn out of the solid rock of that black and barren  range, led to the little palaces that crowned the cones, and there were  palms, cocoanuts, and tamarind trees to soften the brilliancy of facade  and roof. Above the town was Blackbeard's Castle; and Bluebeard's so  high on the right that its guns could have levelled the city in an hour.  Although not a hundred years old, and built by the Danes, both these  frowning towers were museums of piratical tradition, and travellers  returned to Europe with imaginations expanded.    
The long street interested Alexander's practical mind more than legends  or architecture. Huge stone buildings--warehouses, stores, exchange- and  counting-houses--extended from the street to the edge of the water,  where ships were unloaded and loaded from doors at the rear. Men of  every nation and costume moved in that street; and for a day Mr.  Cruger's business was in abeyance, while the boy from the quiet Island  of St. Croix leaned against one of the heavy tamarind trees at the foot  of the first hill, and watched the restless crowd of Europeans,  Asiatics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, North and South Americans. There were  as many national costumes as there were rival flags in the harbour.  There was the British admiral in his regimentals and powdered queue, the  Chinaman in his blouse and pigtail, the Frenchman with his earrings,  villanous Malays, solemn merchants from Boston, and negroes trundling  barrows of Spanish dollars. But it was the extraordinary assortment of  faces and the violent contrasts of temperament and character they  revealed which interested Alexander more than aught else. With all his  reading he had not imagined so great a variety of types; his mental  pictures had been the unconscious reflection of British, Danish, or  African. Beyond these he had come in contact with nothing more striking  than sailors from the neighbouring Islands, who had suggested little  besides the advisability of placing an extra guard over the money boxes  whilst they were in port. Most of these men who surged before him were  merchants of the first rank or the representatives of others as  important,--captains of large ships and their mates. The last sauntered  and cursed the heat, which was infernal; but the merchants moved rapidly  from one business house to another, or talked in groups, under the  tamarind trees, of the great interests which brought them to the Indies.  Upon the inherent characteristics which their faces expressed were  superimposed the different seals of those acquired,--shrewdness,  suspicion, a hawk-like alertness, the greed of acquisition. Alexander,  with something like terror of the future, reflected that there was not  one of these men he cared to know. He knew there were far greater cities  than the busy little <i>entrepot</i> of the West Indies, but he rightly  doubted if he ever should see again so cosmopolitan a mob, a more picked  assortment of representative types. Not one looked as if he remembered  his wife and children, his creed, or the art and letters of his land.  They were a sweating, cursing, voluble, intriguing, greedy lot,  picturesque to look upon, profitable to study, calculated to rouse in a  boy of intellectual passions a fury of final resentment against the  meannesses of commercial life. Alexander jerked his shoulders with  disgust and moved slowly down the street. After he had reflected that  great countries involved great ideas, and that there was no place for  either political or moral ideals in an isolated and purely commercial  town like little Charlotte Amalie, he recovered his poise, and lent  himself to his surroundings again with considerable philosophy.    
He had almost crossed the foot of the third hill when he turned  abruptly into a large store, unlike any he had seen. It was full of  women, splendid creatures, who were bargaining with merchants' clerks  for the bales of fine stuffs which had been opened for the display of  samples to the wholesale buyers from other Islands. These women  purchased the exiled stuffs to sell to the ladies of the capital, and  this was the only retail trade known to the St. Thomas of that day.  Alexander bethought himself of his uncle's commission, and precipitately  bought from the open bale nearest the door, then, from the next, a  present for Mrs. Mitchell. Mrs. Lytton, who was an invalid and  fifty-eight, received, a fortnight later, a dress pattern of  rose-coloured silk, and Mrs. Mitchell, who aspired to be a leader of  fashion, one of elderly brown. But Alexander was more interested in the  sellers than in the possible dissatisfaction of his aunts. The women of  his acquaintance were fair and fragile, and the Africans of St. Croix  were particularly hideous, being still of parent stock. But these  creatures were tawny and magnificent, with the most superb figures, the  most remarkable swing, that ever a man had looked upon; and glorious  eyes, sparkling with deviltry. On their heads the white linen was wound  to a high point and surmounted by an immense hat, caught up at one side  with a flower. They wore for clothing a double skirt of coloured linen,  and a white fichu, open in a point to the waist and leaving their  gold-coloured arms quite bare. They moved constantly, if only from one  foot to the other. Occasionally their eyes flashed sparks, and they flew  at each other's throats, screeching like guinea fowl, but in a moment  they were laughing good-naturedly again, and chattering in voices of a  remarkable soft sweetness. Several of them noticed Alexander, for his  beauty had grown with his years. His eyes were large and gray and dark,  like his mother's, but sparkled with ardour and merriment. His mouth was  chiselled from a delicate fulness to a curving line; firm even then, but  always humorous, except when some fresh experience with the ingenuous  self-interest of man deepened the humour to cynicism. The nose was long,  sharply cut, hard, strong in the nostrils, the head massive, the brow  full above the eyes, and the whole of a boyish and sunburned fairness.  He could fetch a smile that gave his face a sweet and dazzling beauty.  His figure was so supple and well knit, so proud in its bearing, that no  woman then or later ever found fault with its inconsiderable inches; and  his hands and feet were beautiful. His adoring aunt attended to his  wardrobe, and he wore to-day, as usual, white linen knee-breeches, black  silk stockings, a lawn shirt much beruffled with lace. His appearance  pleased these gorgeous birds of plumage, and one of them snatched him  suddenly from the floor and gave him a resounding smack. Alexander, much  embarrassed, but not wholly displeased, retreated hurriedly, and asked  an Englishman who they were and whence they came.    
"They are literally the pick of Martinique, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the  other Islands celebrated for beautiful women. Of course they've all got  a touch of the tar brush in them, but the French or the Spanish blood  makes them glorious for a few years, and during those few they come here  and make hay. Some come at certain seasons only, others perch here till  they change in a night from houri to hag. This daylight trade gives them  a <i>raison d'etre</i>, but wait till after dark. God! this is a hell hole;  but by moonlight or torchlight this street is one of the sights of the  earth. The magnificent beauty of the women, enhanced by silken stuffs of  every colour, the varied and often picturesque attire of the men, all  half mad with drink--well, if you want to sleep, you'd better get a room  high up."    
"Mine is up one hundred and seventeen steps. I am but afraid I may not  see all there is to see."    
But before the week was half out he had tired of St. Thomas by day and  by night. The picture was too one-sided, too heavily daubed with colour.  It made a palette of the imagination, sticky and crude. He began to  desire the green plantations of St. Croix, and more than ever he longed  for the snow-fields of the north. Two days of hard work concluded Mr.  Cruger's business, and on the thirtieth of the month he weighed anchor,  in company with many others, and set sail for St. Croix. He started  under a fair breeze, but a mile out the wind dropped, and he was until  midnight making the harbour of Christianstadt When they were utterly  becalmed the sun seemed to focus his hell upon the little sloop. It  rolled sickeningly in the oily wrinkled waters, and Alexander put his  Pope in his pocket. The sea had a curious swell, and he wondered if an  earthquake were imminent. The sea was not quite herself when her  foundations were preparing to shake. Earth-quakes had never concerned  him, but as the boat drifted past the reef into the harbour of  Christianstadt at midnight, he was assailed by a fit of terror so sudden  and unaccountable that he could recall but one sensation in his life  that approached it: shortly after he arrived on the Island he had stolen  down to the lagoon one night, fascinated by the creeping mist, the  scowling manchineels, the talk of its sinister inhabitant, and was  enjoying mightily his new feeling of creeping terror, when the silence  was broken by a heavy swish, and he saw the white belly of the shark not  three feet from him. He had scampered up the hill to his mother's skirts  as fast as his legs could carry him, nor visited the lagoon again until  the shark was mouldering on its bed. To-night a mist, almost  imperceptible except on the dark line of coast, changed the beauty of  the moonbeams to a livid light that gave the bay the horrid pallor of a  corpse. The masses of coral rock in the shallow waters looked leprous,  the surface was so glassy that it fell in splinters from the oars of the  boat that towed them to shore. There was not a sound from the reef, not  a sound from the land. The slender lacing mangroves in the swamp looked  like upright serpents, black and petrified, and the Fort on the high  bluff might have been a sarcophagus full of dead men but for the  challenge of the sentry.    
Alexander began to whistle, then climbed down into the boat and took an  oar. When he had his feet on land he walked up King Street more hastily  than was his habit in the month of August. But here, although the town  might have been a necropolis, so quiet was it, it had not put on a death  mask. There was no mist here; the beautiful coral houses gleamed under  the moonbeams as if turned to marble, and Alexander forgot the horror of  the waters and paused to note, as he had done many times before, the  curious Alpine contrast of these pure white masses against the green and  burnished arches of tropic trees. Then he passed through the  swimming-bath to his bed, and a half-hour later slept as soundly as if  the terrible forces of the Caribbean world were safe in leash.
