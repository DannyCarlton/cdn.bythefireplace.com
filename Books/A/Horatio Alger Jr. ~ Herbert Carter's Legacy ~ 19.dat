  The squire was in very good spirits. All the way back from the post   office he had been congratulating himself on the elegant bargain he   was about to make. The widow and her son had been obliged to yield.   Squire Leech thought more of Herbert than of his mother, for he was   convinced that but for him he could have talked over Mrs. Carter six   months before. 
  &#8220;Serves the boy right,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It was preposterous in   him to oppose my wishes. He might have known I would advise what was   best.&#8221; 
  The squire meant what was best for him. He had not given much  thought  what would be best for Mrs. Carter. 
  &#8220;Some men would take advantage of their situation and reduce their   offer&#8221; thought the squire, virtuously, &#8220;but I won't be hard on them.   They shall have the three hundred and fifty dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said he cheerfully, as Herbert opened the door, &#8220;I believe  I  have given you the time I agreed upon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Please walk in.&#8221; 
  The squire expected to find him sober and depressed, but in spite  of  himself Herbert could not help looking in good spirits. This  puzzled  the squire a little, but he said to himself: &#8220;Probably they  have  decided that my offer wasn't so bad a one, after all.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said the village magnate, &#8220;well, Mrs. Carter, now that you   have had time to think over my proposal, you have probably seen its   advantages.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should not be willing to give up the house, sir. My husband  built  it, and&#8212;&#8221; 
  The squire's brow darkened. What a perverse, obstinate woman she  was! 
  &#8220;That ain't the question,&#8221; he exclaimed, pounding his cane on the   floor. &#8220;There are many things we don't want to do that we've got to   do. You stand in your own light, ma'am. I have my rights.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We don't deny that, sir,&#8221; said Herbert, who enjoyed the squire's   excitement, knowing how it must end. 
  &#8220;I am glad to hear it,&#8221; said the squire; &#8220;but it appears to me you   think you and your mother are the only persons to be considered in   this matter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think my mother is entitled to some consideration.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Haven't I considered her? Haven't I offered her a most liberal  price  for the place?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We don't call it liberal.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then you are unreasonable. Many men in my position would offer  less.  Indeed, I don't think I ought to offer more than three hundred   dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We would thank you, Squire Leech, if we could see any favor in   offering three or four hundred dollars less than the house is worth.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We have had enough of this nonsense,&#8221; said the squire, angrily.  &#8220;It  is not too late to withdraw my offer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You had better withdraw it,&#8221; said Herbert, composedly, &#8220;for mother   and I have decided to refuse it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Refuse it!&#8221; gasped the squire. &#8220;What do you mean by such  outrageous  impudence?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't see how it can be considered impudence. We are not obliged  to  accept every offer made us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are obliged to accept this,&#8221; cried Squire Leech, stamping his   cane upon the floor again. &#8220;You know there is no help for it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How do you make that out, sir?&#8221; inquired our hero. 
  &#8220;You can't pay the interest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I beg your pardon, sir; we are ready to pay.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I mean the whole of the interest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So do I.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It must be paid at once.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It shall be paid at once, Squire Leech. Please make out a  receipt.&#8221; 
  Squire Leech was never more astonished in his life. He was not   convinced till Herbert produced what he could distinguish as two ten-   dollar bills and one five. 
  &#8220;There will be two dollars and a half change,&#8221; said Herbert in a   business-like manner. 
  &#8220;What did you mean by telling me you could not pay the interest  when I  was here at twelve o'clock?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We could not, then, or thought we could not.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then how can you pay me now?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We received some money in a letter this morning. The letter had  not  been opened when you were here, so we didn't know we could meet  your  claims.&#8221; 
  Squire Leech was very angry. He felt that he had been defeated, and   that triumph had slipped over to the other side. But he resolved to   make one more attempt. 
  &#8220;I have the right to refuse this money,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It comes too  late.  It should have been paid at twelve.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I beg your pardon. Squire Leech; you yourself gave us time to  consult  what to do.&#8221; &#8220;Because,&#8221; said the squire, unguardedly, &#8220;I  thought you  could not pay the interest.&#8221; 
  Herbert could not help smiling. 
  &#8220;We have nothing to do with what you thought.&#8221; 
  The squire frowned and bit his lips with vexation. He tried to  think  of some way of getting over the difficulty but none presented  itself.  As he dashed off the signature and took the money, he said,  angrily:  &#8220;The time will come when I will have this place. Your  convenient  letters won't always come just in the nick of time.&#8221; &#8220;I  hope to be  prepared for you next time, without having to depend on  that.&#8221; 
  Still, the squire lingered. The fact was, that, though very angry,  he  was anxious to know from whom Mrs. Carter had received this  opportune  help. 
  &#8220;Who sent you this letter?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;I don't think we need to tell you that,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;I have no objection to tell,&#8221; said Mrs. Carter. &#8220;It was my aunt,   Nancy Carter, of Randolph, who so kindly remembered us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish she'd kept back her letter a day or two,&#8221; thought the  squire. 
  &#8220;Is she rich?&#8221; he asked, abruptly. 
  &#8220;No; she has a very modest income left by her brother; but her  wants  are few, and she thought we might need help. She has a good  heart.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, ma'am, as my business is over, I will leave you,&#8221; said the   squire, sulkily. &#8220;As for that boy of yours,&#8221; pointing his finger at   Herbert, &#8220;I advise you to teach him better manners. He won't gain   anything by his impertinence. If he had acted differently I would have   given him employment, or got my superintendent to do so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should have been unable to accept it. Squire Leech,&#8221; said  Herbert.  &#8220;I have made an engagement already.&#8221; 
  The squire had forgotten this, and it was mortifying to expect that   his patronage was of no importance to the boy whom he detested. 
  &#8220;Good morning!&#8221; he said abruptly and left the room 
  &#8220;I am afraid, Herbert, you treated the squire disrespectfully,&#8221;  said  Mrs. Carter. 
  &#8220;I don't think so, mother, unless to oppose his wishes is to be   disrespectful.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He spoke as if he thought you did.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know that, but he wouldn't if he hadn't been unreasonable. But  I've  got to go to the hotel in fifteen minutes. Just give me a bite,  for  I'm awful hungry.&#8221; 
  So the day which Herbert had so much dreaded in advance was marked  by  two pieces of good luck.
