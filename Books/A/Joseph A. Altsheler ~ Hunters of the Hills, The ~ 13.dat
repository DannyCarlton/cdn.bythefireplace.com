Robert looked back and saw the roofs and spires of Quebec sitting on its  mighty rock, and he remembered how much had happened during their short  stay there. He could recall the whole time, hour by hour, and he knew  that he would never forget any part of it. The town was intense,  glowing, vivid in the clear northern sunlight, and he had seen it, as he  so often had longed to do. A quality in his nature had responded to it,  but at the last his heart had turned against it. The splendor of that  city into which he had enjoyed such a remarkable introduction had in it  something hot and feverish.    
"You're thinking a farewell to Quebec, Robert," said the hunter. "It  looks grand and strong up there, but I've an idea there'll be a day when  we'll come again."    
"Americans and English have besieged it before," said Robert, "but  they've never taken it."    
"Which proves nothing, but we'll turn our minds now to our journey into  the south. It's good to breathe this clean air again, and the sooner we  reach the deep woods the better I'll like it. What say you, Tayoga?"    
The nostrils of the Onondaga expanded, as he inhaled the odors of leaf  and grass, borne on the gentle wind.    
"I have lived in the white man's house in Albany," he said, "and in our  own log house in the vale of Onondaga, and I know the English and the  French have many things that the nations of the Hodenosaunee have not,  but we can do without most of them. If the great chiefs were to drink  and dance all night as Bigot and his friends do, then indeed would we  cease to be the mighty League of the Hodenosaunee."    
They traveled all that day on foot, but at a great pace, showing their  safe conduct twice to French soldiers, and so thin was the line of  settlements along the St. Lawrence that when night came they were beyond  the cultivated fields and had entered the deep woods. The three, in  addition to their weapons, carried on their backs packs containing  blankets and food, and as Willet and Tayoga put them down they drew long  breaths of relief like those of prisoners escaped.    
"Home, Tayoga! Home!" said the hunter, joyfully. "I've nothing against  cities in general, but I breathed some pretty foul air in Quebec, and  it's sweet and clean here. There comes a time when you are glad no house  crosses your view and you are with the world as it was made in the  beginning. Don't these trees look splendid! Did you ever see a finer lot  of tender young leaves? And the night sky you see up there has been  washed and scrubbed until it's nothing but clean blue!"    
"Why, you're only a boy, Dave, the youngest of us three," laughed  Robert. "Here you are singing songs about leaves and trees just as if  you were not the most terrible swordsman in the world."    
A shadow crossed Willet's face, but it was quick in passing.    
"Let's not talk about Boucher, Robert," he said. "I don't regret what I  did, knowing that it saved the lives of others, but I won't recall it  any oftener than I can help. You're right when you term me a boy, and I  believe you're right, too, when you say I'm the youngest of the three.  I'm so glad to be here that just now I'm not more'n fifteen years old. I  could run, jump, laugh and sing. And I think the woods are a deal safer  and friendlier than Quebec. There's nobody, at least not here, lying  around seeking a chance to stick a rapier in your back."    
He unbuckled his sword and laid it upon the grass. Robert put his beside  it.    
"I don't think we'll need to use 'em again for a long time," said the  hunter, "but they're mighty fine as decorations, and sometimes a  decoration is worth while. It impresses. Now, Tayoga, you kindle the  fire, and Robert, you find a spring. It's pleasant to feel that you're  again on land that belongs to nobody, and can do as you please."    
Robert found a spring less than a hundred yards away, and Tayoga soon  kindled a fire near it with his flint and steel, on which the hunter  warmed their food. Each had a small tin cup from which he drank clear  water as they ate, and Robert, elastic of temperament, rejoiced with the  hunter.    
"You are right, Dave," he said. "These are splendid trees, and every  leaf on 'em is splendid, too, and the little spring I found is just  about as fine a spring as the forest holds. I slept in a good bed at the  Inn of the Eagle, but when I scrape up the dead leaves here, roll myself  in my blanket and lie on 'em I think I'll sleep better than I did  between four walls. What did you think of the Marquis Duquesne, Dave?"    
"A man of parts, Robert. He has more military authority than any of our  Governors have, and if war comes he'll be a dangerous opponent."    
"And it will come, Dave?"    
"Looks like a certainty. You see, Robert, the King of France and the  King of England sitting on their golden thrones, only three or four  hundred miles apart, but three or four thousand miles from us, have a  dyspeptic fit, make faces at each other, and here in the woods we must  fall to fighting. Even Tayoga's people--and the King of France and the  King of England are nothing to them--must be drawn into it."    
"Both Kings claim the Ohio country, which they will never see, and of  which they know nothing," said Tayoga, with a faint touch of sarcasm,  "but perhaps it belongs to the people who live in it."    
"Maybe so, Tayoga! Maybe!" said Willet briskly, "but we'll not look for  trouble or unpleasant thoughts now. We three are too glad to be in the  woods again. Tayoga, suppose you scout about and see that no enemy's  near. Then we'll build up the fire, till it's burning bright, and  rejoice."    
"It is well!" said Tayoga, as he slipped away among the trees, making  no sound as he went. Robert meanwhile gathered dead wood which lay  everywhere in abundance, and heaped it beside the fire ready for use.  But as Tayoga was gone some time he sat down again with his back to a  tree, taking long deep breaths of the cool fresh air, and feeling his  pulses leap. The hunter sat in a similar position, gazing meditatively  into the fire. Robert heard a rattling of bark over his head, but he  knew that it was a squirrel scuttling up the trunk of the tree, and  pausing now and then to examine the strange invaders of his forest.    
"Do you see the squirrel, Dave?" he asked.    
"Yes, he's about twenty feet above you now, sitting in a fork. He's a  fine big fellow with a bushy tail curved so far over his back that it  nearly touches his head. He has little red eyes and he's just burning up  with curiosity. The firelight falls on him in such a way that I can see.  Perhaps he has never seen a man before. Now he's looking at you, Robert,  trying to decide what kind of an animal you are, and forming an estimate  of your character and disposition."    
"You're developing your imagination, Dave, but since I saw what you said  and did in Quebec I'm not surprised."    
"Encouraged by your motionless state he's left the fork, and come a half  dozen feet down the trunk in order to get a better look at you. I think  he likes you, Robert. He lies flattened against the bark, and if I had  not seen him descending I would not notice him now, but the glow of the  coals still enables me to make out his blazing little red eyes like  sparks of fire. Now he is looking at me, and I don't think he has as  much confidence in my harmlessness as he has in yours. Perhaps it's  because he sees my eyes are upon him and he doesn't like to be watched.  He's a saucy little fellow. Sit still, Robert! I see a black shadow over  your head, and I think our little friend, the squirrel, should look out.  Ah, there he goes! Missed! And our handsome young friend, the gray  squirrel, is safe! He has scuttled into his hole higher up the tree!"    
Robert had heard a rush of wings and he had seen a long black shadow  pass.    
"What was it, Dave?" he asked.    
"A great horned owl. His iron beak missed our little squirrel friend  just about three inches. Those three inches were enough, but I don't  think that squirrel will very soon again stay out at night so late. The  woods are beautiful, Robert, but you see they're not always safe even  for those who can't live anywhere else."    
"I know, Dave, but I'm not going to think about it tonight, because I've  made up my mind to be happy. Here comes Tayoga. Is any enemy near,  Tayoga?"    
"None," replied the Onondaga, sitting down by the fire. "But the forest  is full of its own people, and they are all very curious about us."    
"That's true," said Willet, "a squirrel over Robert's head was so  inquisitive that he forgot his vigilance for a few moments and came near  losing his life as the price of his carelessness. I'm not surprised to  hear you say, Tayoga, they're all looking at us. I've felt for some time  that we're being watched, admired and perhaps a little feared. It's a  tribute to the enormously interesting qualities of us three."    
"That is, Dave, because we're human beings we're kings in the forest  among the animals."    
"You put it right, Robert. They look up to us. Is anything watching us  among the leaves near by, Tayoga?"    
"A huge bald-headed eagle, Great Bear, is sitting on a bough in the  center of a mass of green leaves. He is looking at us, and while he is  full of curiosity and some admiration he fears and hates us more."    
"What is he saying to himself, Tayoga?"    
"You can read his words to himself by the look in his eyes. He is saying  that he does not like our appearance, that we are too large, that we  have created here something hot and flaming, that we behave with too  much assurance, going about just as if the forest was ours, and paying  no attention to its rightful owners."    
"He has got a grievance, and perhaps it's a just one," laughed Robert.    
"No, it is not," said Tayoga, "because there is plenty of room in the  forest for him and for us, too. I can read his eyes quite well. There is  much malice and anger in his heart, and I will give him some cause for  rage."    
He picked up a live coal between the ends of two sticks, and holding it  firmly in that manner, walked a little distance among the trees. Then  swinging the sticks he hurled the coal far up among the boughs. There  was an angry screech and whirr and Robert saw a swift shadow passing  between his eyes and the sky.    
"His heart can burn more than ever now," laughed Tayoga, as he returned  to the fire.    
"You've hurt his dignity, Tayoga," said Robert.    
"So I have, but why should he not suffer a loss of pride? He is ruthless  and cruel and when he has his way he makes desolation about him."    
"What else is watching us, Tayoga?"    
"A beast upon the ground, and his heart is much like that of the eagle  in the air. He is crouched in a thicket about twenty yards away, and his  lips are drawn back from his sharp fangs. His nostrils twitch with the  odor of our food, and his yellow eyes are staring at us. Oh, he hates us  because he hates everything except his own kind and very often he hates  that. He wants our food because he's hungry--he's always hungry--and he  would try to eat us too if he were not so much afraid of us."    
"Tayoga, one needs only a single glance to tell that this animal you're  talking about is a wolf."    
"It is so, Dagaeoga. A very hungry and a very angry wolf. He is cunning,  but he does not know everything. He thinks we do not see him, that we do  not know he is there and that maybe, after awhile, when we go to sleep,  he can slip up and steal our food, or perhaps he can bring many of his  brothers, and they can eat us before we awake. Now, I will tell him in a  language he can understand that it's time for him to go away."    
He picked up a heavy stick and threw it with all his might into the  bushes on their right. It sped straighter to the target than he had  hoped, as there was a thud, a snarling yelp, and then the swift pad of  flying feet. Tayoga lay back and laughed.    
"The Spirit of Jest guided my hand," he said, "and the stick struck him  upon the nose. He will run far and his wrath and fear will grow as he  runs. Then he will lie down again in some thicket, and he will not dare  to come back. Now, we will wait a little."    
"Anything more looking at us?" asked Robert after awhile.    
"Yes, we have a new visitor," replied Tayoga in a low tone. "Speak only  in a whisper and do not move, because the animal that is looking at us  has no malice in its heart, and does not wish us harm. It has come very  softly and, while its eyes are larger, they are mild and have only  curiosity."    
"A deer, I should say, Tayoga."    
"Yes, a deer, Lennox, a very beautiful deer. It has been drawn by the  fire, and having come as near as it dares it stands there, shivering a  little, but wondering and admiring."    
"We won't trouble it, Tayoga. We'll need the meat of a deer before long,  but we'll spare our guest of tonight."    
"He is staring very straight at us," said Tayoga, "but something has  stirred in the brushwood--perhaps it's another wolf--and now he has  gone."    
"We seem to be an attraction," said Willet, "and so I suppose we'd  better give 'em as good a look as we can."    
He cast a great quantity of the dry wood on the fire, and it blazed up  gayly, throwing the red glow in a wide circle, and lighting up the  pleasant glade. The figures of the three, as they leaned in luxurious  attitudes, were outlined clearly and sharply, a view they would not have  allowed had not Tayoga been sure no enemy was near.    
"Now let the spectators come on," said Willet genially, "because we  won't be on display forever. After a while we'll get sleepy, and then it  will be best to put out the fire."    
The flames leaped higher and the glowing circle widened. Robert, leaning  against a tree, with his blanket wrapped around him and the cushion of  dead leaves beneath him, felt the grateful warmth upon his face, and it  rejoiced body and mind alike. Tayoga and the hunter were in a similar  state of content, and they were silent for a while. Then Robert said:    
"Who's looking at us now, Tayoga?"    
"Two creatures, Dagaeoga, that belong upon the ground, but that are not  now upon it."    
"Your answer sounds like a puzzle. If they're not now upon the ground  they're probably in the air, but they're not birds, because birds don't  belong on the ground. Then they're animals that have climbed trees."    
"Dagaeoga's mind is becoming wondrous wise. In time he may be a sachem  among his adopted people."    
"Don't you have sport with me, Tayoga, because bear in mind that if you  do I will pay you back some day. Have these creatures a mean, vicious  look?"    
"I could not claim, Dagaeoga, that they are as beautiful as the deer  that came to look at us but lately."    
"Then I make so bold as to say, Tayoga, that they have tufted ear tips,  spotted fur, and short tails, in brief a gentleman lynx and a lady lynx,  his wife. They are gazing at us with respect and fear as the wolf did,  and also with just as much malice and hate. They're wondering who and  what we are, and why we come into their woods, the pair of bloodthirsty  rabbit slayers."    
"Did I not say you would be a sachem some day, Dagaeoga? You have read  aright. An Onondaga warrior could not have done better. The two lynxes  are on a bough ten feet from the ground, and perhaps in their foolish  hearts they think because they are so high above the earth that we  cannot reach them."    
"You're not going to shoot at 'em, Tayoga? We don't want to waste good  bullets on a lynx."    
"Not I, Dagaeoga, but I will make them acquainted with something they  will dread as much as bullets. It's right that those who come to look at  us should be made to pay the price of it."    
"So you think that Monsieur and Madame Lynx have looked long enough at  the illustrious three?"    
"Yes, Dagaeoga. It is time for them to go. And since they do not go of  their own will I must make them go."    
He snatched a long brand from the fire, and whirling it around his head,  and shouting at the same time, he dashed toward an old dead tree some  distance away. Two stump-tailed, tuft-eared animals, uttering loud  ferocious screams, leaped from the boughs and tore away through the  thickets, terror stabbing at their hearts, as the circling flame of red  pursued them. Tayoga returned laughing.    
"They will run and they will run," he said, throwing down his brand.    
"You don't give 'em much chance to see us, Tayoga," said the hunter.  "Since we're on exhibition tonight you might have let 'em look and  admire a while longer."    
"So I could, Great Bear, but I do not like the lynx. Its habits are  unpleasant, and its scream is harsh. Hence, I drove the two of them  away."    
"I suppose you're right. I don't dare care much about 'em either. Now  we'll rest and see what other visitors come to admire."    
Tayoga sat down again. Their packs were put in a neat heap near the  three, Robert's and Willet's swords, and Tayoga's bow and arrows in  their case resting on the top. Robert threw more wood on the fire, and  contentedly watched the great, glowing circle of light extend its  circumference.    
"We knew we'd find peace and rest here," said Willet, "but we didn't  know we'd be watched and admired like people on the stage at a theater."    
"Have you seen many plays, Dave?" asked Robert.    
"A lot, especially in London at Drury Lane and other theaters."    
"And so you know London, as well as Paris?"    
"Well, yes, I've been there. Some day, Robert, I'll tell you more about  both Paris and London and why I happened to be in such great cities,  but not now. We'll keep our minds on the forest, which is worth our  attention. Don't you hear a tread approaching, Tayoga?"    
"Yes, Great Bear, and it's very heavy. A lord of the forest is coming."    
"A moose, think you, Tayoga?"    
"Yes, Great Bear, a mighty bull, one far beyond the common size. I can  tell by his tread, and I think he is angry, or he would not march so  boldly toward the fire."    
"Then," said the hunter, "we'd better stand up, and be ready with our  weapons. I've no wish to be trodden to death by a mad bull moose, just  when I'm feeling so happy and so contented with the world."    
"The Great Bear's advice is good," said Tayoga, and the three took it.  The approaching tread grew heavier, and the largest moose that Robert  had ever seen, pushing his way through the bushes, stood looking at the  fire, and those who had built it. He was a truly magnificent specimen,  and Tayoga had been right in calling him a lord of the forest, but his  eyes were red and inflamed and his look was menacing.    
"Mad! Quite mad!" whispered the hunter. "He sees us, but he doesn't  admire us. He hates us, and he isn't afraid of us."    
The three moved softly and discreetly into a place where both trees and  bushes were so dense that the moose could not get at them.    
"What troubles him?" asked Robert.    
"I don't know," said the hunter. "He may be suffering yet from a wound  by an Indian arrow, or he may have a spell of some kind. We can be  certain only that he's raging mad, every inch of him. Look at those  great sharp hoofs of his, Robert. I'd as soon be struck with an axe."    
The moose, after some hesitation, rushed into the glade, leaped toward  the fire, leaped back again, pawed and trampled the earth in a terrible  convulsion of rage, and then sprang away, crashing through the forest.  They heard the beat of his hoofs a long time, and when the sound ceased  they returned and resumed their seats by the fire.    
"That moose was a great animal," said Tayoga with irony, "but his mind  was the mind of a little child. He did nothing with his strength and  agility but tear the earth and tire himself. Now he runs away among the  trees, scratching his body with bushes and briars."    
"At any rate, he was an important visitor, Tayoga," said the hunter,  "and since we've had a good look at him we're glad he's gone away. I  think it likely now that all who wanted to look at us have had their  look, and we might go to sleep. How are your leaves, Robert?"    
"Fine and soft. They make a splendid bed, and I'm off to slumberland."    
He pushed up the leaves at one end of his couch high enough to form a  pillow, and stretched himself luxuriously. The night was turning cold,  but he had his blanket, and there was the fire. He felt as comfortable  as at the Inn of the Eagle in Quebec, and freer from plots and danger.    
They were allowing the fire to die now, but the coals would glow for a  long time, and Robert looked at them sleepily. His feeling of coziness  and content increased, and presently he slept. The hunter soon followed  him, but Tayoga slept not at all. His subtle Indian instinct warned him  not to do so. For the Onondaga the forest was not free now from danger,  and he would watch while his white friends slept.    
Tayoga arose, after a while, and taking a stick, scattered the coals of  the fire. But he did it in such a manner that he made no noise, the  hunter and young Lennox continuing to sleep soundly. Then he watched the  embers, having lost that union which is strength, die one by one. The  conquered darkness came back, recovering its lost ground, slowly  invading the glade, until it was one in the dusk with the rest of the  forest. Then Tayoga felt better satisfied, and he looked at the  sleepers, whose faces he could still discern, despite the absence of the  fire, a fair moonlight falling.    
Robert and the hunter slept peacefully, but their sleep was deep. The  youth was weary from the long march in the woods, but as he slept his  strong healthy tissues rapidly regained their vitality. The Onondaga  looked at the two longer than usual. These comrades of his were knitted  to him by innumerable labors and dangers shared. In him dwelled the soul  of a great Indian chief, the spirit that has animated Pontiac, and  Little Turtle, and Tecumseh and Red Cloud and other dauntless leaders of  his race, but it had been refined though not weakened by his white  education. Gratitude and truth were as frequent Indian traits as the  memory of injuries, and while he was surcharged with pride because he  was born a warrior of the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of  the great League of the Hodenosaunee, he felt as truly as any knight  ever felt that he must accept and fulfill all the duties of his place.    
Standing in a dusk made luminous by a silvery moonlight he was a fitting  son of the forest, one of its finest products. He belonged to it, and it  belonged to him, each being the perfect complement of the other. His  face cut in bronze was lofty, not without a spiritual cast, and his  black eyes flamed with his resolve. He looked up at the heavens, fleecy  with white vapors, and shot with a million stars, the same sky that had  bent over his race for generations no man could count, and his soul was  filled with admiration. Then he made his voiceless prayer:    
"O, Tododaho, first and greatest sachem of the Onondagas, greatest and  noblest sachem of the League, look down from your home on another star,  and watch over your people, for whom the storms gather! Let the serpents  in your hair whisper to you of wisdom that you in turn may whisper it to  us through the winds! Direct our footsteps in the great war that is  coming between the white nations and save to us our green forests, our  blue lakes and our silver rivers! Remember, O, Tododaho, that although  the centuries have passed since Manitou took you from us, your name  still stands among us for all that is great, noble and wise! I beseech  you that you give sparks of your own lofty and strong spirit to your  children, to the Hodenosaunee in this, their hour of need, and I ask  too, that you help one who is scarcely yet a warrior in years, one who  invokes thee humbly, even, Tayoga, of the clan of the Bear, of the  nation Onondaga, of thy own great League of the Hodenosaunee!"    
He bent his head a little to listen. All the legends and beliefs of his  race, passed from generation to generation, crowded upon him. Tododaho  leaning down from his star surely heard his prayer. Tayoga shivered a  little, not from cold or fear, but from emotion. The mystic spell was  upon him. Far above him in the limitless void little wreaths of vapor  united about a great shining star, taking the shape of a man, the shape  of a great chief, wise beyond all other chiefs that had ever lived, and  he distinctly saw the wise serpents, coil on coil, in Tododaho's hair.  They were whispering in his ear, and bending his head a little farther  he heard the words of the serpents which the rising wind brought,  repeated, from the lips of Tododaho:    
"Fear not, O young warrior of the Onondagas! Tododaho leaning down from  his star hears thy pious appeal! Tododaho, for more than four hundred  years, has watched over the great League, night and day! Let the fifty  sachems, old in years and wisdom, walk in the straight path of truth,  and let the warriors follow! Let them be keepers of the faith, friends  to those who have been their friends, sage in council, brave in battle,  and they shall hold their green forests, their blue lakes and their  silver rivers! And to thee, Tayoga, I say, thou shalt encounter many  dangers, but because thy soul is pure, thou shalt have great rewards!"    
Then the wind died suddenly. The leaves hung motionless. The vapors  about the great shining star dissolved, the face of Tododaho, with the  wise serpents, coil on coil in his hair, disappeared, and the luminous  heavens were without a sign. But they had spoken.    
Tayoga trembled, but again it was from emotion. Tododaho had sent his  words of promise on the wind, and they had been whispered in his ear.  Great would be his dangers but great would be his rewards. He was  uplifted. His heart exulted. His deeds would be all the mightier because  of the dangers, and he would never forget that he had the promise of  Tododaho, greatest, wisest and noblest of the chiefs of the  Hodenosaunee, who had gone to a shining star more than four hundred  years ago.    
He sat down under one of the trees and sleep remained far from him. He  still listened with all the power of his sensitive hearing for any sound  that might come in the forest, and after awhile he took his bow and  quiver from their case, putting his quiver over his shoulder. He covered  his rifle with the leaves, and holding the bow in his hand stole away  among the trees.    
The faintest of sounds had come to him, and Tayoga did not doubt its  nature. It was strange to the forest and it was hostile. The mystic  spell was still upon him, and it heightened his faculties to an  extraordinary degree. He had almost the power of divination. A hundred  yards, and he crouched low behind the trunk of a great oak. Then as the  moonlight fell upon a small opening just ahead he saw them, Tandakora  and two warriors.    
The Ojibway was in full war paint, and the luminous quality of the  moon's rays enlarged his huge form. He towered like Hanegoategeh, the  Evil Spirit, and the figures upon his shoulders and chest stood out like  carving. He and the two warriors also carried bows and arrows, and  Tayoga surmised that they had meant to slay in silence. His heart burned  with rage and he felt, too, an unlimited daring. Did he not have the  promise of Tododaho that he should pass through all dangers and receive  great rewards? He felt himself a match for the three, and he did not  need secrecy and silence. He raised his voice and cried:    
"Stand forth, Tandakora, and fight. I too have only <i>waano</i> (the bow)  and <i>gano</i> (the arrow), but I meet the three of you!"    
Tandakora and the two warriors sprang back and in an instant were hidden  by the trees, but Tayoga had expected them to do so, and he dropped  down, moving silently to another and hidden point, where he waited, an  arrow on the string. He knew that Tandakora had recognized his voice,  and would make every effort, his shoulder healed enough for use, to  secure such a prize. The Ojibway would believe, too, that three must  prevail against one, and he would push the attack. So the Onondaga  remained motionless, but confident.    
Nearly ten minutes of absolute silence followed, but his hearing was so  acute that he did not think any of the three could move without his  knowledge. Then a slight sliding sound came. One of the warriors was  passing to the right, and that, too, he had expected, as they would  surely try to flank him. He moved back a little, and with the end of his  bow shook gently a bush seven or eight feet away. In an instant, an  arrow, coming from the night, whistled through the bush. But Tayoga drew  back the bow quick as lightning, fitted an arrow to the string and shot  with all the power of his arm at a bronze body showing among the leaves  at the point whence the arrow had come.    
The shaft sang in the air, and so great was its speed and so short the  range that it passed entirely through the chest of the warrior, cutting  off his breath so quickly that he had no time to utter his death cry.  There was no sound but that of his fall as he crashed among the leaves.  Nor did Tayoga utter the usual shout of triumph. He sank back and fitted  another arrow to the string, turning his attention now to the left.    
It had been the Onondaga's belief that Tandakora would remain in front,  sending the warriors on either flank, and now he expected a movement on  the left. He did not have to make any feint of his own to draw the  second warrior, who must have been lacking somewhat in skill, as he  presently saw a dim figure in the bushes and his second arrow sped with  the same speed and deadly result that had marked the first. Fitting his  third arrow to the string, he called:    
"Stand forth, Tandakora, and show yourself like a man! Then we shall see  who shoots the better!"    
But being a knight of the woods, and to convince the Ojibway that it was  no trick, he showed himself first. Tandakora shot at once, but Tayoga  dropped back like a flash, and the arrow cut the air, where his  feathered head had been. Then all his Indian nature, the training and  habit of generations, leaped up in him and he began to taunt.    
"You shot quickly, Tandakora," he called, "and your arm was strong, but  the arrow struck not! You followed us all the way from Stadacona, and  you thought to have our scalps! The Great Bear and Lennox did not  suspect, but I did! The warriors who came with you are dead, and you and  I alone face each other! I have shown myself and I have risked your  arrow, now show yourself, Tandakora, and risk mine!"    
But the Ojibway, it seemed, had too much respect for the bow of Tayoga.  He remained close, and did not disclose an inch of his brown body. The  Onondaga did not show himself again, but crouched for a shot, in case  the opportunity came. He knew that Tandakora was a great bowman, but he  had supreme confidence in his own skill against anybody. Nothing stirred  where his enemy lay and no sound came from the little camp, which was  beyond the reach of the words they had uttered.    
A quarter of an hour, a half hour, an hour passed, and neither moved,  showing all the patience natural to the Indian on the war path. Then  Tayoga shook a bush a few feet from him, but Tandakora divined the  trick, and his arrow remained on the string. Another quarter of an hour,  and seeing some leaves quiver, Tayoga, at a chance, sent an arrow among  them. No sound came back, and he knew that it had been sped in vain.    
Then he began to move slowly and with infinite care toward the right,  resolved to bring the affair to a head. At the end of twenty feet he  rustled the bushes a little once more and lay flat. An arrow flew over  his head, but he did not reply, resuming his slow advance after his  enemy's shaft had sped. Another twenty feet and he made the bushes move  again. Tandakora shot, and in doing so he exposed a little of his right  arm. Tayoga sent a prompt arrow at the brown flesh. He heard a cry of  pain, wrenched in spite of his stoical self from the Ojibway, and then  as he sank down again and put his ear to the ground came the sound of  retreating footsteps.    
The affair, unfinished in a way, so far as the vital issue was  concerned, was concluded for the present, at least. Ear and mind told  Tayoga as clearly as if eye had seen. His arrow had ploughed its path  across Tandakora's arm near the shoulder, inflicting a wound that would  heal, but which was extremely painful and from which so much blood was  coming that a quick bandage was needed. Tandakora could no longer meet  Tayoga with the bow and arrow and so he must retreat. Nor was it likely  that his first wound was yet more than half healed.    
The Onondaga waited until he was sure his enemy was at least a half mile  away, when he rose boldly and approached the place where Tandakora had  last lain hidden. He detected at once drops of dark blood on the leaves  and grass, and he found his arrow, which Tandakora had snatched from  the wound and thrown upon the ground. He wiped the barb carefully and  replaced it in his quiver. Then he followed the trail at least three  miles, a trail marked here and there by ruddy spots.    
Tayoga did not feel sorry for his enemy. Tandakora was a savage and an  assassin, and he deserved this new hurt. He was a dangerous enemy, one  who had made up his mind to secure revenge upon the Onondaga and his  friends, but his fresh wound would keep him quiet for a while. One could  not have an arrow through his forearm and continue a hunt with great  vigor and zest.    
Tayoga marked twice the places where Tandakora had stopped to rest.  There the drops of blood were clustered, indicating a pause of some  duration, and a third stop showed where he had bound up his wound. Fresh  leaves had been stripped from a bush and a tiny fragment or two  indicated that the Ojibway had torn a piece from his deerskin waistcloth  to fasten over the leaves. After that the trail was free from the ruddy  spots, but Tayoga did not follow it much farther. He was sure that  Tandakora would not return, as he had lost much blood, and for a while,  despite his huge power and strength, exertion would make him weak and  dizzy. Evidently, the bullet in his shoulder, received when they were on  their way to Quebec, had merely shaken him, but the arrow had taken a  heavier toll.    
Tayoga returned to the camp of the three. All the fire had gone out, and  Willet and Robert, wrapped in their blankets, still slept peacefully.  The entire combat between the bowmen had passed without their knowledge,  and Tayoga, quietly returning the bow and quiver to their case, and  taking his rifle instead, sat down with his back against a tree, and his  weapon across his knees. He was on the whole satisfied. He had not  removed Tandakora, but he had inflicted another painful and mortifying  defeat upon him. The pride of the Indian had been touched in its most  sensitive place, and the Ojibway would burn with rage for a long time.  Tayoga's white education did not keep him from taking pleasure in the  thought.    
He had no intention of going to sleep. Although Tandakora would not  return, others might come, and for the night the care of the three was  his. It had grown a little darker, but the blue of the skies was merely  deeper and more luminous. There in the east was the great shining star,  on which Tododaho, mightiest of chiefs, lived with the wise serpents  coiled in his hair. He gazed and his heart leaped. The vapors about the  star were gathering again, and for a brief moment or two they formed the  face of Tododaho, a face that smiled upon him. His soul rejoiced.    
"O Tododaho," were his unspoken words. "Thou hast kept thy promise! Thou  hast watched over me in the fight with Tandakora, and thou hast given me  the victory! Thou hast sent all his arrows astray and thou hast sent  mine aright! I thank thee, O, Tododaho!"    
The vapors were dissolved, but Tayoga never doubted that he had seen for  a second time the face of the wise chief who had gone to his star more  than four hundred years ago. A great peace filled him. He had accepted  the white man's religion as he had learned it in the white man's school,  and at the same time he had kept his own. He did not see any real  difference between them. Manitou and God were the same, one was the name  in Iroquois and the other was the name in English. When he prayed to  either he prayed to both.    
The darkness that precedes the dawn came. The great star on which  Tododaho lived went away, and the whole host swam into the void that is  without ending. The deeper dusk crept up, but Tayoga still sat  motionless, his eyes wide open, his ecstatic state lasting. He heard the  little animals stirring once more in the forest as the dawn approached,  and he felt very friendly toward them. He would not harm the largest or  the least of them. It was their wilderness as well as his, and Manitou  had made them as well as him.    
The darkness presently began to thin away, and Tayoga saw the first  silver shoot of dawn in the east. The sun would soon rise over the great  wilderness that was his heritage and that he loved, clothing in fine,  spun gold the green forests, the blue lakes and the silver rivers. He  took a mighty breath. It was a beautiful world and he was glad that he  lived in it.    
He awoke Robert and Willet, and they stood up sleepily.    
"Did you have a good rest, Tayoga?" Robert asked.    
"I did not sleep," the Onondaga replied.    
"Didn't sleep? Why not, Tayoga?"    
"In the night, Tandakora and two more came."    
"What? Do you mean it, Tayoga?"    
"They were coming, seeking to slay us as we slept, but I heard them.  Lest the Great Bear and Dagaeoga be awakened and lose the sleep they  needed so much, I took my bow and arrows and went into the forest and  met them."    
Robert's breath came quickly. Tayoga's manner was quiet, but it was not  without a certain exultation, and the youth knew that he did not jest.  Yet it seemed incredible.    
"You met them, Tayoga?" he repeated.    
"Yes, Dagaeoga."    
"And what happened?"    
"The two warriors whom Tandakora brought with him lie still  in the forest. They will never move again. Tandakora escaped  with an arrow through his arm. He will not trouble us for a  week, but he will seek us later."    
"Why didn't you awake us, Tayoga, and take us with you?"    
"I wished to do this deed alone."    
"You've done it well, that's sure," said Willet, "and now that all  danger has been removed we'll light our fire and cook breakfast."    
After breakfast they shouldered their packs and plunged once more into  the greenwood, intending to reach as quickly as they could the hidden  canoe on the Richelieu, and then make an easy journey by water.
