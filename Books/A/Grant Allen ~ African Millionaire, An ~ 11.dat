We had a terrible passage home from New York. The Captain told us he  "knew every drop of water in the Atlantic personally"; and he had  never seen them so uniformly obstreperous. The ship rolled in the  trough; Charles rolled in his cabin, and would not be comforted. As  we approached the Irish coast, I scrambled up on deck in a violent  gale, and retired again somewhat precipitately to announce to my  brother-in-law that we had just come in sight of the Fastnet Rock  Lighthouse. Charles merely turned over in his berth and groaned.  "I don't believe it," he answered. "I expect it is probably Colonel  Clay in another of his manifold disguises!"    
At Liverpool, however, the Adelphi consoled him. We dined  luxuriously in the Louis Quinze restaurant, as only millionaires  can dine, and proceeded next day by Pullman car to London.    
We found Amelia dissolved in tears at a domestic cataclysm. It  seemed that Cesarine had given notice.    
Charles was scarcely home again when he began to bethink him of  the least among his investments. Like many other wealthy men, my  respected connection is troubled more or less, in the background of  his consciousness, by a pervading dread that he will die a beggar.  To guard against this misfortune--which I am bound to admit nobody  else fears for him--he invested, several years ago, a sum of two  hundred thousand pounds in Consols, to serve as a nest-egg in case  of the collapse of Golcondas and South Africa generally. It is  part of the same amiable mania, too, that he will not allow the  dividend-warrants on this sum to be sent to him by post, but  insists, after the fashion of old ladies and country parsons, upon  calling personally at the Bank of England four times a year to claim  his interest. He is well known by sight to not a few of the clerks;  and his appearance in Threadneedle Street is looked forward to with  great regularity within a few weeks of each lawful quarter-day.    
So, on the morning after our arrival in town, Charles observed to  me, cheerfully, "Sey, I must run into the City to-day to claim my  dividends. There are two quarters owing."    
I accompanied him in to the Bank. Even that mighty official, the  beadle at the door, unfastened the handle of the millionaire's  carriage. The clerk who received us smiled and nodded. "How much?"  he asked, after the stereotyped fashion.    
"Two hundred thousand," Charles answered, looking affable.    
The clerk turned up the books. "Paid!" he said, with  decision. "What's your game, sir, if I may ask you?"    
"Paid!" Charles echoed, drawing back.    
The clerk gazed across at him. "Yes, Sir Charles," he answered, in  a somewhat severe tone. "You must remember you drew a quarter's  dividend from myself--last week--at this very counter."    
Charles stared at him fixedly. "Show me the signature," he said at  last, in a slow, dazed fashion. I suspected mischief.    
The clerk pushed the book across to him. Charles examined the name  close.    
"Colonel Clay again!" he cried, turning to me with a despondent air.  "He must have dressed the part. I shall die in the workhouse, Sey!  That man has stolen away even my nest-egg from me."    
I saw it at a glance. "Mrs. Quackenboss!" I put in. "Those portraits  on the Etruria! It was to help him in his make-up! You recollect,  she sketched your face and figure at all possible angles."    
"And last quarter's?" Charles inquired, staggering.    
The clerk turned up the entry. "Drawn on the 10th of July,"  he answered, carelessly, as if it mattered nothing.    
Then I knew why the Colonel had run across to England.    
Charles positively reeled. "Take me home, Sey," he cried. "I am  ruined, ruined! He will leave me with not half a million in the  world. My poor, poor boys will beg their bread, unheeded, through  the streets of London!"    
(As Amelia has landed estate settled upon her worth a hundred and  fifty thousand pounds, this last contingency affected me less to  tears than Charles seemed to think necessary.)    
We made all needful inquiries, and put the police upon the quest at  once, as always. But no redress was forthcoming. The money, once  paid, could not be recovered. It is a playful little privilege of  Consols that the Government declines under any circumstances to pay  twice over. Charles drove back to Mayfair a crushed and broken man.  I think if Colonel Clay himself could have seen him just then, he  would have pitied that vast intellect in its grief and bewilderment.    
After lunch, however, my brother-in-law's natural buoyancy  reasserted itself by degrees. He rallied a little. "Seymour," he  said to me, "you've heard, of course, of the Bertillon system of  measuring and registering criminals."    
"I have," I answered. "And it's excellent as far as it goes. But,  like Mrs. Glasse's jugged hare, it all depends upon the initial  step. 'First catch your criminal.' Now, we have never caught  Colonel Clay--"    
"Or, rather," Charles interposed unkindly, "when you <i>did</i> catch him,  you didn't hold him."    
I ignored the unkindly suggestion, and continued in the same voice,  "We have never secured Colonel Clay; and until we secure him, we  cannot register him by the Bertillon method. Besides, even if we  had once caught him and duly noted the shape of his nose, his chin,  his ears, his forehead, of what use would that be against a man who  turns up with a fresh face each time, and can mould his features  into what form he likes, to deceive and foil us?"    
"Never mind, Sey," my brother-in-law said. "I was told in New York  that Dr. Frank Beddersley, of London, was the best exponent of the  Bertillon system now living in England; and to Beddersley I shall  go. Or, rather, I'll invite him here to lunch to-morrow."    
"Who told you of him?" I inquired. "<i>Not</i> Dr. Quackenboss, I hope;  nor yet Mr. Algernon Coleyard?"    
Charles paused and reflected. "No, neither of them," he answered,  after a short internal deliberation. "It was that magazine editor  chap we met at Wrengold's."    
"<i>He's</i> all right," I said; "or, at least, I think so."    
So we wrote a polite invitation to Dr. Beddersley, who pursued  the method professionally, asking him to come and lunch with us  at Mayfair at two next day.    
Dr. Beddersley came--a dapper little man, with pent-house eyebrows,  and keen, small eyes, whom I suspected at sight of being Colonel  Clay himself in another of his clever polymorphic embodiments. He  was clear and concise. His manner was scientific. He told us at once  that though the Bertillon method was of little use till the expert  had seen the criminal once, yet if we had consulted him earlier  he might probably have saved us some serious disasters. "A man  so ingenious as this," he said, "would no doubt have studied  Bertillon's principles himself, and would take every possible  means to prevent recognition by them. Therefore, you might almost  disregard the nose, the chin, the moustache, the hair, all of which  are capable of such easy alteration. But there remain some features  which are more likely to persist--height, shape of head, neck,  build, and fingers; the timbre of the voice, the colour of the iris.  Even these, again, may be partially disguised or concealed; the way  the hair is dressed, the amount of padding, a high collar round the  throat, a dark line about the eyelashes, may do more to alter the  appearance of a face than you could readily credit."    
"So we know," I answered.    
"The voice, again," Dr. Beddersley continued. "The voice itself may  be most fallacious. The man is no doubt a clever mimic. He could,  perhaps, compress or enlarge his larynx. And I judge from what you  tell me that he took characters each time which compelled him  largely to alter and modify his tone and accent."    
"Yes," I said. "As the Mexican Seer, he had of course a  Spanish intonation. As the little curate, he was a cultivated  North-countryman. As David Granton, he spoke gentlemanly Scotch.  As Von Lebenstein, naturally, he was a South-German, trying to  express himself in French. As Professor Schleiermacher, he was a  North-German speaking broken English. As Elihu Quackenboss, he  had a fine and pronounced Kentucky flavour. And as the poet, he  drawled after the fashion of the clubs, with lingering remnants  of a Devonshire ancestry."    
"Quite so," Dr. Beddersley answered. "That is just what I should  expect. Now, the question is, do you know him to be one man, or  is he really a gang? Is he a name for a syndicate? Have you any  photographs of Colonel Clay himself in any of his disguises?"    
"Not one," Charles answered. "He produced some himself, when he was  Medhurst the detective. But he pocketed them at once; and we never  recovered them."    
"Could you get any?" the doctor asked. "Did you note the name and  address of the photographer?"    
"Unfortunately, no," Charles replied. "But the police at Nice showed  us two. Perhaps we might borrow them."    
"Until we get them," Dr. Beddersley said, "I don't know that we can  do anything. But if you can once give me two distinct photographs of  the real man, no matter how much disguised, I could tell you whether  they were taken from one person; and, if so, I think I could point  out certain details in common which might aid us to go upon."    
All this was at lunch. Amelia's niece, Dolly Lingfield, was there,  as it happened; and I chanced to note a most guilty look stealing  over her face all the while we were talking. Suspicious as I had  learned to become by this time, however, I did not suspect Dolly of  being in league with Colonel Clay; but, I confess, I wondered what  her blush could indicate. After lunch, to my surprise, Dolly called  me away from the rest into the library. "Uncle Seymour," she said  to me--the dear child calls me Uncle Seymour, though of course I am  not in any way related to her--"<i>I</i> have some photographs of Colonel  Clay, if you want them."    
"<i>You</i>?" I cried, astonished. "Why, Dolly, how did you get them?"    
For a minute or two she showed some little hesitation in telling me.  At last she whispered, "You won't be angry if I confess?" (Dolly is  just nineteen, and remarkably pretty.)    
"My child," I said, "why <i>should</i> I be angry? You may confide in me  implicitly." (With a blush like that, who on earth could be angry  with her?)    
"And you won't tell Aunt Amelia or Aunt Isabel?" she inquired  somewhat anxiously.    
"Not for worlds," I answered. (As a matter of fact, Amelia and  Isabel are the last people in the world to whom I should dream  of confiding anything that Dolly might tell me.)    
"Well, I was stopping at Seldon, you know, when Mr. David Granton  was there," Dolly went on; "--or, rather, when that scamp pretended  he was David Granton; and--and--you won't be angry with me, will  you?--one day I took a snap-shot with my kodak at him and Aunt  Amelia!"    
"Why, what harm was there in that?" I asked, bewildered. The wildest  stretch of fancy could hardly conceive that the Honourable David had  been <i>flirting</i> with Amelia.    
Dolly coloured still more deeply. "Oh, you know Bertie Winslow?" she  said. "Well, he's interested in photography--and--and also in <i>me</i>.  And he's invented a process, which isn't of the slightest practical  use, he says; but its peculiarity is, that it reveals textures. At  least, that's what Bertie calls it. It makes things come out so. And  he gave me some plates of his own for my kodak--half-a-dozen or more,  and--I took Aunt Amelia with them."    
"I still fail to see," I murmured, looking at her comically.    
"Oh, Uncle Seymour," Dolly cried. "How blind you men are!  If Aunt Amelia knew she would never forgive me. Why, you <i>must</i>  understand. The--the rouge, you know, and the pearl powder!"    
"Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?" I inquired.    
"Comes out! I should <i>think</i> so! It's like little black spots all  over auntie's face. <i>such</i> a guy as she looks in it!"    
"And Colonel Clay is in them too?"    
"Yes; I took them when he and auntie were talking together, without  either of them noticing. And Bertie developed them. I've three of  David Granton. Three beauties; <i>most</i> successful."    
"Any other character?" I asked, seeing business ahead.    
Dolly hung back, still redder. "Well, the rest are with Aunt  Isabel," she answered, after a struggle.    
"My dear child," I replied, hiding my feelings as a husband, "I will  be brave. I will bear up even against that last misfortune!"    
Dolly looked up at me pleadingly. "It was here in London," she went  on; "--when I was last with auntie. Medhurst was stopping in the  house at the time; and I took him twice, tete-a-tete with Aunt  Isabel!"    
"Isabel does not paint," I murmured, stoutly.    
Dolly hung back again. "No, but--her hair!" she suggested, in a  faint voice.    
"Its colour," I admitted, "is in places assisted by a--well, you  know, a restorer."    
Dolly broke into a mischievous sly smile. "Yes, it is," she  continued. "And, oh, Uncle Sey, where the restorer has--er--restored  it, you know, it comes out in the photograph with a sort of  brilliant iridescent metallic sheen on it!"    
"Bring them down, my dear," I said, gently patting her head with my  hand. In the interests of justice, I thought it best not to frighten  her.    
Dolly brought them down. They seemed to me poor things, yet well  worth trying. We found it possible, on further confabulation, by  the simple aid of a pair of scissors, so to cut each in two that  all trace of Amelia and Isabel was obliterated. Even so, however,  I judged it best to call Charles and Dr. Beddersley to a private  consultation in the library with Dolly, and not to submit the  mutilated photographs to public inspection by their joint subjects.  Here, in fact, we had five patchy portraits of the redoubtable  Colonel, taken at various angles, and in characteristic unstudied  attitudes. A child had outwitted the cleverest sharper in Europe!    
The moment Beddersley's eye fell upon them, a curious look came over  his face. "Why, these," he said, "are taken on Herbert Winslow's  method, Miss Lingfield."    
"Yes," Dolly admitted timidly. "They are. He's--a friend of mine,  don't you know; and--he gave me some plates that just fitted my  camera."    
Beddersley gazed at them steadily. Then he turned to Charles.  "And this young lady," he said, "has quite unintentionally and  unconsciously succeeded in tracking Colonel Clay to earth at last.  They are genuine photographs of the man--as he is--<i>without</i> the  disguises!"    
"They look to me most blotchy," Charles murmured. "Great black lines  down the nose, and such spots on the cheek, too!"    
"Exactly," Beddersley put in. "Those are <i>differences in texture</i>.  They show just how much of the man's face is human flesh--"    
"And how much wax," I ventured.    
"Not wax," the expert answered, gazing close. "This is some harder  mixture. I should guess, a composition of gutta-percha and  india-rubber, which takes colour well, and hardens when applied,  so as to lie quite evenly, and resist heat or melting. Look here;  that's an artificial scar, filling up a real hollow; and <i>this</i> is  an added bit to the tip of the nose; and <i>those</i> are shadows, due  to inserted cheek-pieces, within the mouth, to make the man look  fatter!"    
"Why, of course," Charles cried. "India-rubber it must be. That's  why in France they call him le Colonel Caoutchouc!"    
"Can you reconstruct the real face from them?" I inquired anxiously.    
Dr. Beddersley gazed hard at them. "Give me an hour or two," he  said--"and a box of water-colours. I <i>think</i> by that time--putting  two and two together--I can eliminate the false and build up for you  a tolerably correct idea of what the actual man himself looks like."    
We turned him into the library for a couple of hours, with the  materials he needed; and by tea-time he had completed his first  rough sketch of the elements common to the two faces. He brought  it out to us in the drawing-room. I glanced at it first. It was  a curious countenance, slightly wanting in definiteness, and not  unlike those "composite photographs" which Mr. Galton produces by  exposing two negatives on the same sensitised paper for ten seconds  or so consecutively. Yet it struck me at once as containing  something of Colonel Clay in every one of his many representations.  The little curate, in real life, did not recall the Seer; nor  did Elihu Quackenboss suggest Count von Lebenstein or Professor  Schleiermacher. Yet in this compound face, produced only from  photographs of David Granton and Medhurst, I could distinctly trace  a certain underlying likeness to every one of the forms which the  impostor had assumed for us. In other words, though he could make  up so as to mask the likeness to his other characters, he could not  make up so as to mask the likeness to his own personality. He could  not wholly get rid of his native build and his genuine features.    
Besides these striking suggestions of the Seer and the curate,  however, I felt vaguely conscious of having seen and observed  <i>the man himself</i> whom the water-colour represented, at some time,  somewhere. It was not at Nice; it was not at Seldon; it was not at  Meran; it was not in America. I believed I had been in a room with  him somewhere in London.    
Charles was looking over my shoulder. He gave a sudden little start.  "Why, I know that fellow!" he cried. "You recollect him, Sey; he's  Finglemore's brother--the chap that didn't go out to China!"    
Then I remembered at once where it was that I had seen him--at the  broker's in the city, before we sailed for America.    
"What Christian name?" I asked.    
Charles reflected a moment. "The same as the one in the note we got  with the dust-coat," he answered, at last. "The man is Paul  Finglemore!"    
"You will arrest him?" I asked.    
"Can I, on this evidence?"    
"We might bring it home to him."    
Charles mused for a moment. "We shall have nothing against him,"  he said slowly, "except in so far as we can swear to his identity.  And that may be difficult."    
Just at that moment the footman brought in tea. Charles wondered  apparently whether the man, who had been with us at Seldon when  Colonel Clay was David Granton, would recollect the face or  recognise having seen it. "Look here, Dudley," he said, holding  up the water-colour, "do you know that person?"    
Dudley gazed at it a moment. "Certainly, sir," he answered briskly.    
"Who is it?" Amelia asked. We expected him to answer, "Count von  Lebenstein," or "Mr. Granton," or "Medhurst."    
Instead of that, he replied, to our utter surprise, "That's  Cesarine's young man, my lady."    
"Cesarine's young man?" Amelia repeated, taken aback. "Oh, Dudley,  surely, you <i>must</i> be mistaken!"    
"No, my lady," Dudley replied, in a tone of conviction. "He comes  to see her quite reg'lar; he have come to see her, off and on,  from time to time, ever since I've been in Sir Charles's service."    
"When will he be coming again?" Charles asked, breathless.    
"He's downstairs now, sir," Dudley answered, unaware of the  bombshell he was flinging into the midst of a respectable family.    
Charles rose excitedly, and put his back against the door. "Secure  that man," he said to me sharply, pointing with his finger.    
"<i>What</i> man?" I asked, amazed. "Colonel Clay? The young man who's  downstairs now with Cesarine?"    
"No," Charles answered, with decision; "Dudley!"    
I laid my hand on the footman's shoulder, not understanding what  Charles meant. Dudley, terrified, drew back, and would have rushed  from the room; but Charles, with his back against the door,  prevented him.    
"I--I've done nothing to be arrested, Sir Charles," Dudley cried,  in abject terror, looking appealingly at Amelia. "It--it wasn't me  as cheated you." And he certainly didn't look it.    
"I daresay not," Charles answered. "But you don't leave this room  till Colonel Clay is in custody. No, Amelia, no; it's no use your  speaking to me. What he says is true. I see it all now. This villain  and Cesarine have long been accomplices! The man's downstairs with  her now. If we let Dudley quit the room he'll go down and tell them;  and before we know where we are, that slippery eel will have  wriggled through our fingers, as he always wriggles. He <i>is</i> Paul  Finglemore; he <i>is</i> Cesarine's young man; and unless we arrest him  now, without one minute's delay, he'll be off to Madrid or St.  Petersburg by this evening!"    
"You are right," I answered. "It is now or never!"    
"Dudley," Charles said, in his most authoritative voice, "stop here  till we tell you you may leave the room. Amelia and Dolly, don't let  that man stir from where he's standing. If he does, restrain him.  Seymour and Dr. Beddersley, come down with me to the servants' hall.  I suppose that's where I shall find this person, Dudley?"    
"N--no, sir," Dudley stammered out, half beside himself with fright.  "He's in the housekeeper's room, sir!"    
We went down to the lower regions in a solid phalanx of three. On  the way we met Simpson, Sir Charles's valet, and also the butler,  whom we pressed into the service. At the door of the housekeeper's  room we paused, strategically. Voices came to us from within; one  was Cesarine's, the other had a ring that reminded me at once of  Medhurst and the Seer, of Elihu Quackenboss and Algernon Coleyard.  They were talking together in French; and now and then we caught  the sound of stifled laughter.    
We opened the door. "Est-il drole, donc, ce vieux?" the man's  voice was saying.    
"C'est a mourir de rire," Cesarine's voice responded.    
We burst in upon them, red-handed.    
Cesarine's young man rose, with his hat in his hand, in a respectful  attitude. It reminded me at once of Medhurst, as he stood talking  his first day at Marvillier's to Charles; and also of the little  curate, in his humblest moments as the disinterested pastor.    
With a sign to me to do likewise, Charles laid his hand firmly on  the young man's shoulder. I looked in the fellow's face: there could  be no denying it; Cesarine's young man was Paul Finglemore, our  broker's brother.    
"Paul Finglemore," Charles said severely, "otherwise Cuthbert Clay,  I arrest you on several charges of theft and conspiracy!"    
The young man glanced around him. He was surprised and perturbed;  but, even so, his inexhaustible coolness never once deserted him.  "What, five to one?" he said, counting us over. "Has law and order  come down to this? Five respectable rascals to arrest one poor  beggar of a chevalier d'industrie! Why, it's worse than New York.  <i>There</i>, it was only you and me, you know, old Ten per Cent!"    
"Hold his hands, Simpson!" Charles cried, trembling lest his enemy  should escape him.    
Paul Finglemore drew back even while we held his shoulders. "No,  not <i>you</i>, sir," he said to the man, haughtily. "Don't dare to lay  your hands upon me! Send for a constable if you wish, Sir Charles  Vandrift; but I decline to be taken into custody by a valet!"    
"Go for a policeman," Dr. Beddersley said to Simpson, standing  forward.    
The prisoner eyed him up and down. "Oh, Dr. Beddersley!" he said,  relieved. It was evident he knew him. "If <i>you've</i> tracked me  strictly in accordance with Bertillon's methods, I don't mind so  much. I will not yield to fools; I yield to science. I didn't think  this diamond king had sense enough to apply to you. He's the most  gullible old ass I ever met in my life. But if it's <i>you</i> who have  tracked me down, I can only submit to it."    
Charles held to him with a fierce grip. "Mind he doesn't break away,  Sey," he cried. "He's playing his old game! Distrust the man's  patter!"    
"Take care," the prisoner put in. "Remember Dr. Polperro! On what  charge do you arrest me?"    
Charles was bubbling with indignation. "You cheated me at Nice,"  he said; "at Meran; at New York; at Paris!"    
Paul Finglemore shook his head. "Won't do," he answered, calmly. "Be  sure of your ground. Outside the jurisdiction! You can only do that  on an extradition warrant."    
"Well, then, at Seldon, in London, in this house, and elsewhere,"  Charles cried out excitedly. "Hold hard to him, Sey; by law or  without it, blessed if he isn't going even now to wriggle away  from us!"    
At that moment Simpson returned with a convenient policeman, whom he  had happened to find loitering about near the area steps, and whom I  half suspected from his furtive smile of being a particular  acquaintance of the household.    
Charles gave the man in charge formally. Paul Finglemore insisted  that he should specify the nature of the particular accusation.  To my great chagrin, Charles selected from his rogueries, as best  within the jurisdiction of the English courts, the matter of the  payment for the Castle of Lebenstein--made in London, and through  a London banker. "I have a warrant on that ground," he said. I  trembled as he spoke. I felt at once that the episode of the  commission, the exposure of which I dreaded so much, must now  become public.    
The policeman took the man in charge. Charles still held to him,  grimly. As they were leaving the room the prisoner turned to  Cesarine, and muttered something rapidly under his breath, in  German. "Of which tongue," he said, turning to us blandly, "in spite  of my kind present of a dictionary and grammar, you still doubtless  remain in your pristine ignorance!"    
Cesarine flung herself upon him with wild devotion. "Oh, Paul,  darling," she cried, in English, "I will not, I will not! I  will never save myself at <i>your</i> expense. If they send you to  prison--Paul, Paul, I will go with you!"    
I remembered as she spoke what Mr. Algernon Coleyard had said to us  at the Senator's. "Even the worst of rogues have always some good  in them. I notice they often succeed to the end in retaining the  affection and fidelity of women."    
But the man, his hands still free, unwound her clasping arms with  gentle fingers. "My child," he answered, in a soft tone, "I am sorry  to say the law of England will not permit you to go with me. If it  did" (his voice was as the voice of the poet we had met), "'stone  walls would not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage.'" And bending  forward, he kissed her forehead tenderly.    
We led him out to the door. The policeman, in obedience to Charles's  orders, held him tight with his hand, but steadily refused, as the  prisoner was not violent, to handcuff him. We hailed a passing  hansom. "To Bow Street!" Charles cried, unceremoniously pushing in  policeman and prisoner. The driver nodded. We called a four-wheeler  ourselves, in which my brother-in-law, Dr. Beddersley and myself  took our seats. "Follow the hansom!" Charles cried out. "Don't let  him out of your sight. After him, close, to Bow Street!"    
I looked back, and saw Cesarine, half fainting, on the front door  steps, while Dolly, bathed in tears, stood supporting the  lady's-maid, and trying to comfort her. It was clear she had not  anticipated this end to the adventure.    
"Goodness gracious!" Charles screamed out, in a fresh fever of  alarm, as we turned the first corner; "where's that hansom gone to?  How do I know the fellow was a policeman at all? We should have  taken the man in here. We ought never to have let him get out of  our sight. For all we can tell to the contrary, the constable  himself--may only be one of Colonel Clay's confederates!"    
And we drove in trepidation all the way to Bow Street.
