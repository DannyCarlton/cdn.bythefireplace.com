<b>SENT TO A FRIEND WITH A VOLUME OF TENNYSON</b> 
Wouldst know the clash of knightly steel on steel?<br> Or list the throstle singing loud and clear?<br> Or walk at twilight by some haunted mere<br> In Surrey; or in throbbing London feel<br> Life's pulse at highest--hark, the minster's peal! . . .<br> Turn but the page, that various world is here!
