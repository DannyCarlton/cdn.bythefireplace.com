   &quot;Such hair! Such eyes! Such color! Laugh if you will, Whittemore,   but I swear that she was the handsomest girl I've ever laid my  eyes  upon!&quot; 
  There was an artist's enthusiasm in Gregson's girlishly sensitive   face as he looked across the table at Whittemore and lighted a   cigarette. 
  &quot;She wouldn't so much as give me a look when I stared,&quot; he added.   &quot;I couldn't help it. Gad, I'm going to make a full-page 'cover' of   her to-morrow for Burke's. Burke dotes on pretty women for the  cover  of his magazine. Why, demmit, man, what the deuce are you  laughing  at?&quot; 
  &quot;Not at this particular case, Tom,&quot; apologized Whittemore. &quot;But&#8212;   I'm wondering&#8212;&quot; 
  His eyes wandered ruminatively about the rough interior of the   little cabin, lighted by a single oil-lamp hanging from a cross-  beam  in the ceiling, and he whistled softly. 
  &quot;I'm wondering,&quot; he went on, &quot;if you'll ever strike a place where   you won't see 'one of the most beautiful things on earth.' The  last  one was at Rio Piedras, wasn't it, Tom? A Spanish girl, or  was she a  Creole? I believe I've got your letter yet, and I'll  read it to you  to-morrow. I wasn't surprised. There are pretty  women down in Porto  Rico. But I didn't think you'd have the nerve  to discover one up  here&#8212;in the wilderness.&quot; 
  &quot;She's got them all beat,&quot; retorted the artist, flecking the ash   from the tip of his cigarette. 
  &quot;Even the Valencia girl, eh?&quot; 
  There was a chuckling note of pleasure in Philip Whittemore's   voice as he leaned half across the table, his handsome face,  bronzed  by snow and wind, illumined in the lamp-glow. Gregson, in  strong  contrast, with his round, smooth cheeks, slim hands, and  build that  was almost womanish, leaned over his side to meet him.  For the  twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands. 
  &quot;Haven't forgotten Valencia, eh?&quot; chuckled the artist, gloatingly.   &quot;Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil. Seems like a century   since we were out raising the Old Ned together, and yet it's less   than three years since we came back from South America. Valencia!   Will we ever forget it? When Burke handed me his first turn-down a   month ago and said, 'Tom, your work begins to show you want a  rest,'  I thought of Valencia, and was so confoundedly homesick for  those old  days when you and I pretty nearly started a revolution,  and came  within an ace of getting our scalps lifted, that I moped  for a week.  Gad, do I remember it? You got out by fighting, and I  through a pretty  girl.&quot; 
  &quot;And your nerve,&quot; chuckled Whittemore, crushing the other's hand.   &quot;That was when I made up my mind you were the nerviest man alive,   Greggy. Did you ever learn what became of Donna Isobel?&quot; 
  &quot;She appeared twice in Burke's, once as the 'Goddess of the   Southern Republics' and again as 'The Girl of Valencia.' She  married  that reprobate of a Carabobo planter, and I believe  they're happy.&quot; 
  &quot;It seems to me there were others,&quot; continued Whittemore,   pondering for a moment in mock seriousness. &quot;There was one at Rio   whom you swore would make your fortune if you could get her to sit   for you, and whose husband was on the point of putting six inches  of  steel into you for telling her so, when I explained that you  were  young and harmless, and a little out of your head&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;With your fist,&quot; cried Gregson, joyously. &quot;Gad, but that was a   mighty blow! I can see that knife now. I was just beginning my   paternoster when&#8212;chug!&#8212;and down he went! And he deserved it. I  said  nothing wrong. In my very best Spanish I asked her if she  would sit  for me, and why the devil did he take that as an insult?  And she was  beautiful.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course,&quot; agreed Whittemore. &quot;If I remember, she was 'the   loveliest creature you had ever seen.' And after that there were   others&#8212;a score of them at least, each lovelier than the one  before.&quot; 
  &quot;They make up my life,&quot; said Gregson, more seriously than he had   yet spoken. &quot;They're the only thing I can draw and do well. I'd  think  an editor was mad if he asked me to do something without a  pretty  woman in it. God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them  forever.  When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.&quot; 
  &quot;And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.&quot; 
  &quot;I insist upon it. If she lacks something, as Donna Isobel wanted   color, I imagine that it is there, and she is perfect! But this  one  that I saw to-night is perfect! Now what I want to know is  this, Who  the deuce is she!&quot; 
  &#8212;&quot;where can she be found, and will she sit for a 'Burke,' two or   three miscellaneous, and a 'study' for the annual sale,&quot; struck in   Whittemore. &quot;Is that it?&quot; 
  &quot;Exactly. You've a natural ability for hitting the nail on the   head, Phil.&quot; 
  &quot;And Burke told you to take a rest.&quot; 
  Gregson offered his cigarettes. 
  &quot;Yes, Burke is a good-natured, poetic old soul who has a horror of   spiders, snakes, and sky-scrapers. He said to me: 'Greggy, go and   seek nature in some quiet, secluded place, and forget everything  for  a fortnight or two except your clothes and half a dozen cases  of  beer.' Rest! Nature! Beer! Think of those cheerful suggestions,  Phil,  while I was dreaming of Valencia, of Donna Isobels, and  places where  Nature cuts up as though she had been taking  champagne all her life.  Gad, your letter came just in time!&quot; 
  &quot;And I told you little enough in that,&quot; said Philip, quickly,   rising and pacing uneasily back and forth across the cabin floor.  &quot;I  gave you promise of excitement, and urged you to join me if you  could.  And why? Because&#8212;&quot; 
  He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table. 
  &quot;I wanted you to come because the thing that happened down in   Valencia, and that other at Rio, isn't a circumstance to the hell   that's going to cut loose pretty soon up here&#8212;and I'm in need of   help. Understand? It's not fun&#8212;this time. I'm playing a single  hand  in what looks like a losing game. If I ever needed a fighter  in my  life I need one now. That's why I sent for you.&quot; 
  Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet. He was a head   shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique. Yet there   was something in the cold gray-blue of his eyes, a peculiar  hardness  of his chin, that compelled one to look at him twice and  rendered  first judgment unsafe. His slim fingers closed like steel  about  Philip's. 
  &quot;Now you're coming down to business, Phil,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I've   been waiting with the patience of Job&#8212;or of little Bobby Tuckett,  if  you remember him, who began courting Minnie Sheldon seven years   ago&#8212;and married her the day after I got your letter. I was too  busy  figuring out what you hadn't written to go to the wedding. I  tried to  read between the lines, and fell down completely. I've  been thinking  all the way up from Le Pas, and I'm still at sea.  You called. I came.  What's up?&quot; 
  &quot;It's going to sound a little mad&#8212;at first, Greggy,&quot; chuckled   Whittemore, lighting his pipe. &quot;It's going to give your esthetic   tastes a jar. Look here!&quot; 
  He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door. 
  The cold northern sky was brilliant with stars. The cabin, its   logs half smothered in dying masses of verdure which had climbed   about it during the summer, was built on the summit of one of the   wind-cropped ridges which are called mountains in the far north.  Into  that north swept infinite wilderness, white and gray where  the starlit  tops of the spruce rose up at their feet, black in the  distance. From  somewhere out of it there came the low, weeping  monotone of surf  beating on a shore. Philip, with one hand on  Gregson's shoulder,  pointed with the other into the lonely  desolation which they were  facing. 
  &quot;There isn't much between us and the Arctic Ocean, Greggy,&quot; he   said. &quot;See that light off there, like a great fire that has half a   mind to die out one minute and flares up the next? Doesn't it  remind  you of the night we got away from Carabobo, when Donna  Isobel pointed  out our way to us, with the moon coming up over the  mountains as a  guide? That isn't the moon. It's the aurora  borealis. You can hear the  wash of the Bay down there, and if  you're keen you can catch the smell  of icebergs. There's Fort  Churchill&#8212;a rifle-shot beyond the ridge,  asleep. There's nothing  but Hudson's Bay Company's posts, Indian  camps, and trappers  between here and civilization, which is four  hundred miles down  there. Seems like a quiet and peaceful country,  doesn't it?  There's something about it that makes you thrill and  wonder if  this isn't the biggest part of the universe after all.  Listen!  Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill! That's the  primal  voice in this world, the voice of the wild. Even that beating  of  the surf is filled with the same thing, for it's rolling up   mystery instead of history. It is telling what man doesn't know,  and  in a language which he cannot understand. You're a beauty  scientist,  Greggy. This must sink deep.&quot; 
  &quot;It does,&quot; said Gregson. &quot;What the deuce are you getting at,   Phil?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm arriving gradually and without undue haste to the point,   Greggy. I'm about to tell you why I induced you to join me up  here. I  hesitate at the last word. It seems almost brutal, taking  into  consideration your philosophy of beauty, to drop from all  this&#8212;from  that blackness and mystery out there, from Donna  Isobels and pretty  eyes, down to&#8212;fish.&quot; 
  &quot;Fish!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, fish.&quot; 
  Gregson, lighting a fresh cigarette, held the match so that the   tiny flame lighted up his companion's face for a moment. 
  &quot;Look here,&quot; he expostulated, &quot;you haven't got me up here to go&#8212;   fishing?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;and no,&quot; said Philip. &quot;But even if I have&#8212;&quot; 
  He caught Gregson by the arm again, and there was a tightness in   the grip of his fingers which convinced the other that he was   speaking seriously now. 
  &quot;Do you remember what started the revolution down in Honduras the   second week after we struck Puerto Barrios, Greggy? It was a girl,   wasn't it?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, and she wasn't half pretty at that.&quot; 
  &quot;It was less than a girl,&quot; went on Philip. &quot;Scene: the palm plaza   at Ceiba. President Belize is drinking wine with his cousin, the   fiancee of General O'Kelly Bonilla, the half Irish, half Latin-   American leader of his forces, and his warmest friend. At a moment   when their corner of the plaza is empty Belize helps himself to a   cousinly kiss. O'Kelly, unperceived, arrives in time to witness  the  act. From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to  hatred and  jealousy. Within three weeks he has started a  revolution, beats the  government forces at Ceiba, chases Belize  from the capital, gets  Nicaragua mixed up in the trouble, and  draws three French, two German,  and two American war-ships to the  scene. Six weeks after the  wine-drinking he is President of the  Republic, en facto. And all of  this, Greggy, because of a kiss.  Now, if a kiss can start a  revolution, unseat a President, send a  government to smash, what must  be the possibilities of a fish?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm getting interested,&quot; said Gregson. &quot;If there's a climax, come   to it, Phil. I admit that there must be enormous possibilities in  &#8212;a  fish. Go on!&quot;
