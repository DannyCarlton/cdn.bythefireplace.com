  &#8220;Is that the latest style?&#8221; inquired James Leech, with a sneer,   pointing to a patch on the knee of Herbert Carter's pants. 
  Herbert's face flushed. He was not ashamed of the patch, for he  knew  that his mother's poverty made it a necessity. But he felt that  it was  mean and dishonorable in James Leech, whose father was one of  the rich  men of Wrayburn, to taunt him with what he could not help.  Some boys  might have slunk away abashed, but Herbert had pluck and  stood his  ground. 
  &#8220;It is my style,&#8221; he answered, firmly, looking James boldly in the   face. 
  &#8220;I admire your taste, then,&#8221; returned James, with a smooth sneer. 
  &#8220;Then, you had better imitate it,&#8221; retorted Herbert. 
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said James, in the same insulting tone. &#8220;Would you  lend  me your pants for a pattern? Excuse me, though; perhaps you have  no  other pair.&#8221; 
  &#8220;For shame, James!&#8221; exclaimed one or two boys who had listened to  the  colloquy, stirred to indignation by this heartless insult on the  part  of James Leech to a boy who was deservedly a favorite with them  all. 
  Herbert's fist involuntarily doubled, and James, though he did not   know it, ran a narrow chance of getting a good whipping. But our young   hero controlled himself, not without some difficulty, and said: &#8220;I   have one other pair, and these are at your service whenever you   require them.&#8221; 
  Then turning to the other boys, he said, in a changed tone: &#8220;Who's  in  for a game of ball?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I,&#8221; said one, promptly. 
  &#8220;And I,&#8221; said another. 
  Herbert walked away, accompanied by the other boys, leaving James   Leech alone. 
  James looked after him with a scowl. He was sharp enough to see  that  Herbert, in spite of his patched pants, was a better scholar and  a  greater favorite than himself. He had intended to humiliate him on  the  present occasion, but he was forced to acknowledge that he had  come  off second best from the encounter. He walked moodily away, and  took  what comfort he could in the thought that he was far superior to  a boy  who owned but two pairs of pants, and one of them patched. He  was  foolish enough to feel that a boy or man derived importance from  the  extent of his wardrobe; and exulted in the personal possession of   eight pairs of pants. 
  This scene occurred at recess. After school was over, Herbert  walked  home. He was a little thoughtful. There was no disgrace in a  patch, as  he was sensible enough to be aware. Still, he would have a  little  preferred not to wear one. That was only natural. In that  point, I  suppose, my readers will fully agree with him. But he knew  very well  that his mother, who had been left a widow, had hard work  enough to  get along as it was, and he had no idea of troubling her on  the  subject. Besides, he had a better suit for Sundays, neat though  plain,  and he felt that he ought not to be disturbed by James Leech's   insolence. 
  So thinking, he neared the small house which he called home. It was  a  small cottage, with something less than an acre of land attached,   enough upon which to raise a few vegetables. It belonged to his   mother, nominally, but was mortgaged for half its value to Squire   Leech, the father of James. The amount of the mortgage, precisely, was   seven hundred and fifty dollars. It had cost his father fifteen   hundred. When he built it, obtaining half this sum on mortgage, he   hoped to pay it up by degrees; but it turned out that, from sickness   and other causes, this proved impossible. When, five months before, he   had died suddenly, the house, which was all he left, was subject to   this incumbrance. Upon this, interest was payable semi-annually at the   rate of six per cent. Forty-five dollars a year is not a large sum,   but it seemed very large to Mrs. Carter, when added to their necessary   expenses for food, clothing and fuel. How it was to be paid she did   not exactly see. The same problem had perplexed Herbert, who, like a   good son as he was, shared his mother's cares and tried to lighten   them. But in a small village like Wrayburn there are not many ways of   getting money, at any rate for a boy. There were no manufactories, as   in some large villages, and money was a scarce commodity. 
  Herbert had, however, one source of income. Half a dozen families,   living at some distance from the post office, employed him to bring   any letters or papers that might come for them, and for this service   he received a regular tariff of two cents for each letter, and one   cent for each paper. He was not likely to grow rich on this income,   but he felt that, though small, it was welcome. 
  According to custom, Herbert called at the post office on his way   home. He found a letter for Deacon Crossleigh, one for Mr. Duncan, two   for Dr. Waffit, and papers for each of the two former. 
  &#8220;Ten cents!&#8221; he thought with satisfaction. &#8220;Well, that is better  than  nothing, though it won't buy me a new pair of pants.&#8221; 
  He was about to leave the office, when the postmaster called after   him: &#8220;Wait a minute, Herbert; I believe there's a letter for your   mother.&#8221; 
  Herbert returned, and received a letter bearing the following   superscription: &#8220;Mrs. Almira Carter, Wrayburn, New York.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope it isn't bad news,&#8221; said the postmaster. &#8220;I see it's edged   with black.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can't make out where it's from,&#8221; said Herbert, scanning the   postmark critically. 
  &#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said the postmaster, rubbing his glasses, and taking  another  look. &#8220;The postmark is very indistinct.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There's an n and a p,&#8221; said Herbert, after a little examination.  &#8220;I  think it must be Randolph.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Randolph? So it is, I declare. Have you got any friends or  relatives  living there?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, my mother's Uncle Herbert, for whom I was named, lives  there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then he must be dead.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The envelope is edged with black. You had better carry it home  before  you go round with the others.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Perhaps I had,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I'll run, so as not to keep the  others  waiting. Deacon Crossleigh is always in a hurry for his paper.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, the deacon's always in a fidget to know what's going on,   particularly when Congress is in session. He takes a wonderful   interest in politics.&#8221; 
  Herbert ran up the street with a quick step, pausing a minute at  his  humble home. 
  &#8220;You are out of breath, Herbert. Have you been running?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I've got a letter for you, and I wanted to bring it before I   went round with the rest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A letter! Where from?&#8221; asked the widow, with curiosity, for she  held  very little intercourse with the world outside of Wrayburn. 
  &#8220;It's postmarked Randolph, as well as I can make out. While you are   reading it, I'll run and leave my letters, and be back to hear the   news.&#8221; 
  In a hurry to do all his errands and get back, Herbert ran all the   way. While his eyes were fixed on one of the envelopes, he ran full   against James Leech, who was walking up the street with a pompous air. 
  In the encounter James's hat came off, and he was nearly thrown  down. 
  &#8220;What made you run into me?&#8221; he demanded, wrath-fully. 
  &#8220;Excuse me, James,&#8221; said Herbert, recovering himself. 
  &#8220;You did it on purpose,&#8221; said his enemy, glaring at him angrily. 
  &#8220;That isn't very likely,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I got hit as hard as you   did.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Your hat didn't get knocked off. Pick it up,&#8221; said James,   imperiously, pointing to it as it lay in the path. 
  &#8220;I will, because it is by my fault that it fell,&#8221; said Herbert,   stooping over and picking it up. &#8220;You needn't have ordered me to do   it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The next time take care how you run against a gentleman,&#8221; said  James,  arrogantly. 
  &#8220;Take care the next time to speak like a gentleman.&#8221; said Herbert.   &#8220;Good night! I must be off.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Insolent beggar!&#8221; muttered James. &#8220;He don't know his place. How  dare  he speak to me in that way?&#8221;
