  &#8220;Where are we, Tayoga?&#8221;
  Robert stirred from a doze and the words were involuntary. He looked  upon water, covered with mists and vapors, and the driving wind was  still behind them.
  &#8220;I know not, Dagaeoga,&#8221; replied the Onondaga in devout tones. &#8220;I too  have dozed for a while, and awoke to find nothing changed. All I know  is that we are yet on the bosom of Ganoatohale, and that the west wind  has borne us on. I have always loved the west wind, Dagaeoga. Its  breath is sweet on my face. It comes from the setting sun, from the  greatest of all seas that lies beyond our continent, it blows over the  vast unknown plains that are trodden by the buffalo in myriads, it  comes across the mighty forests of the great valley, it is loaded with  all the odors and perfumes of our immense land, and now it carries us,  too, to safety.&#8221;
  &#8220;You talk in hexameters, Tayoga, but I think your rhapsody is  justified. I also have plenty of cause now to love the west wind. How  long do you think it will be until we feel the dawn on our faces?&#8221;
  &#8220;Two hours, perhaps, but we may reach land before then. While I  cannot smell the dawn I seem to perceive the odor of the forest. Now it  grows stronger, and lo, Dagaeoga, there is another sign! Do you not  notice it?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, what is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;The west wind that has served us so well is dying.<I> Gaoh</I>,  which in our language of the Hodenosaunee is the spirit of the winds,  knows that we need it no more. Surely the land is near because<I> Gaoh</I>  after being a benevolent spirit to us so long would not desert us at  the last moment.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think you must be right, Tayoga, because now I also notice the  strong, keen perfume of the woods, and our west wind has sunk to almost  nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nay, Dagaeoga, it is more than that. It has died wholly.<I> Gaoh</I>  tells us that having brought us so near the land we can now fend for  ourselves.&#8221;
  The air became absolutely still, the swell ceased, the surface of  the lake became as smooth as glass, and, as if swept back by a mighty,  unseen hand, the mists and vapors suddenly floated away toward the  east. Tayoga and Robert uttered cries of admiration and gratitude, as a  high, green shore appeared, veiled but not hidden in the dusk.
  &#8220;So Tododaho has brought us safely across the waters of  Ganoatohale,&#8221; said the Onondaga.
  &#8220;Have you any idea of the point to which we have come?&#8221; asked  Robert.
  &#8220;No, but it is sufficient that we have come to the shore anywhere.  And see, Dagaeoga, the mists and vapors still hang heavily over the  western half of the lake, forming an impenetrable wall that shuts us  off from Tandakora and his warriors. Truly we are for the time the  favorites of the gods.&#8221;
  &#8220;Even so, Tayoga, you see, too, that we have come to land just where  a little river empties into the lake, and we can go on up it.&#8221;
  They paddled with vigorous arms into the mouth of the stream, and  did not stop until the day came. It was a beautiful little river, the  massed vegetation growing in walls of green to the very water's edge,  the songs of innumerable birds coming out of the cool gloom on either  side. Robert was enchanted. His spirits were still at the high key to  which they had been raised by the events of the night. Both he and  Tayoga had enjoyed many hours of rest in the canoe, and now they were  keen and strong for the day's work. So, it was long after dawn when  they stopped paddling, and pushed their prow into a little cove.
  &#8220;And now,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;I think we can land, dress, and cook some  of this precious deer, which we have brought with us in spite of  everything.&#8221;
  Their clothing had been dried by the sun, and they resumed it. Then,  taking all risks, they lighted a fire, broiled tender steaks and ate  like giants who had finished great labors.
  &#8220;I think,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;that when we proceed a few miles farther it  will be better to leave the canoe. It is likely that as we advance the  river will become narrower, and we would be an easy target for a shot  from the bank.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't like to abandon a canoe which has brought us safely across  the lake.&#8221;
  &#8220;We will put it away where it can await our coming another time. But  I think we can dare the river for some distance yet.&#8221;
  Robert had spoken for the sake of precaution, and he was easily  persuaded to continue in the river some miles, as traveling by canoe  was pleasant, and after their miraculous escape or rather rescue, as it  seemed to them, their spirits, already high, were steadily rising  higher. The lone little river of the north, on which they were  traveling, presented a spectacle of uncommon beauty. Its waters flowed  in a clear, silver stream down to the lake, deeper in tint on the still  reaches, and, flashing in the sunlight, where it rushed over the  shallows.
  All the time they moved between two lofty, green walls, the forest  growing so densely on either shore that they could not see back into it  more than fifty yards, while the green along its lower edges was dotted  with pink and blue and red, where the delicate wild flowers were  blooming. The birds in the odorous depths of the foliage sang  incessantly, and Robert had never before heard them sing so sweetly.
  &#8220;I don't think any of our foes can be in ambush along the river,&#8221; he  said. &#8220;It's too peaceful and the birds sing with too much enthusiasm.  You remember how they warned us of danger once by all going away?&#8221;
  &#8220;True, Dagaeoga, and at any time now they may leave. But, like you,  I am willing to take the risk for several hours more. Most of the  warriors must be far south of us unless the rangers are in this region,  and a special force has been sent to meet them.&#8221;
  They came by and by to a long stretch of rippling shallows, and they  were compelled to carry the canoe with its load through the woods and  around them, the task, owing to the density of the forest and thicket  and the weight of their burden, straining their muscles and drawing  perspiration from their faces. But they took consolation from the fact  that game was amazingly plentiful. Deer sprang up everywhere, and twice  they caught glimpses of bears shambling away. Squirrels chattered over  their heads and the little people of the forest rustled all about them.
  &#8220;It shows that no human being has been through here recently,&#8221; said  Tayoga, &#8220;else the game, big and little, would not have been stirring  abroad with so much confidence.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then as soon as we make the portage we can return to the river with  the canoe.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dagaeoga grows lazy. Does he not know that to do the hard thing  strengthens both mind and body? Has he forgotten what Mynheer Jacobus  Huysman told us so often in Albany? Now is a splendid opportunity for  Dagaeoga to harden himself a great deal.&#8221;
  &#8220;I realize it, Tayoga, but I don't want my mind and body to grow too  hard. When one is all steel one ceases to be receptive. Can you see the  river through the trees there?&#8221;
  &#8220;I catch the glitter of sunlight on the water.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope it looks like deep water.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is sufficient to float the canoe and the lazy Dagaeoga can take  to his paddle again.&#8221;
  They put their boat back into the stream, uttering great sighs of  relief, and resumed the far more pleasant travel by water, the day  remaining golden as if doing its best to please them. They had another  long stretch of good water, and they did not stop until they were well  into the afternoon. Then Tayoga proposed that they make a fire and cook  all of the deer.
  &#8220;It seems that the risk here is not great,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we may not  have the chance later on.&#8221;
  Robert, who still felt that they were protected and that for a day  or two no harm could come to them under any circumstances, was more  than willing, and they spent the remainder of the day in their culinary  task. After dark he slept three hours, to be followed by Tayoga for the  same length of time, and about midnight they started up the stream  again, with their food cooked and ready beside them.
  Although the Onondaga shared Robert's feeling that they were  protected for the time, both exercised all their usual caution,  believing thoroughly in the old saying that heaven helps those who help  themselves. It was this watchfulness, particularly of ear, that caused  them to hear the dip of paddles approaching up the stream. Softly and  in silence, they lifted the canoe out of water and hid with it in the  greenwood. Then they saw a fleet of eight large canoes go by, all  containing warriors, armed heavily and in full war paint.
  &#8220;Hurons,&#8221; whispered Tayoga. &#8220;They go south for a great taking of  scalps, doubtless to join Montcalm, who is surely meditating another  sudden and terrible blow.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he will strike at our forts by Andiatarocte,&#8221; rejoined Robert.  &#8220;I hope we can find Willet and Rogers soon and take the news. All the  woods must be full of warriors going south to Montcalm.&#8221;
  &#8220;They have French guns, and good ones too, and they are wrapped in  French blankets. Onontio does not forget the power of the warriors and  draws them to him.&#8221;
  The silent file of war canoes passed on and out of sight, and, for a  space, Robert's heart was heavy within him. He felt the call of battle,  he ought to be in the south, giving what he could to the defense  against the might of Montcalm, but to go now would be merely a dash in  the dark. They must continue to seek Willet and Rogers.
  When the last Indian canoe was far beyond hearing they relaunched  their own and paddled until nearly daybreak, coming to a place where  bushes and tall grass grew thick in the shallow water at the edge of  the river.
  &#8220;Here,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;we will leave the canoe. A good hiding place  offers itself, and with the dawn it will be time for us to take to the  woods.&#8221;
  They concealed with great art the little boat that had served them  so well, sinking it in the heart of the densest growth and then drawing  back the bushes and weeds so skillfully that the keenest Indian eye  would not have noticed that anyone had ever been there.
  &#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Robert sincerely, &#8220;that we'll have the chance to  return here some time or other and use it again.&#8221;
  &#8220;That rests in the keeping of Manitou,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;and now  we will take up our packs and go eastward toward Oneadatote.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we won't go fast, because my pack, with all this venison in it,  is by no means light.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is no heavier than mine, Dagaeoga, but, as you say, we will not  hasten, lest we pass the Great Bear and the Mountain Wolf in the forest  and not know it. But I think we are safe in going toward Oneadatote, as  Rogers and his rangers usually operate in the region of George and  Champlain.&#8221;
  They traveled two days and two nights and came once more among the  high ridges and peaks. They saw many Indian trails and always they  watched for another. On the third day Tayoga discovered traces in moss  and he said with great satisfaction to his comrade:
  &#8220;Lo, Dagaeoga, we, too, be wise in our time. The print here speaks  to me like the print on the page of a book. It says that the Great Bear  has passed this way.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can tell that the traces were made by the feet of a white man,&#8221;  said Robert, &#8220;but how do you know they are Dave's?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have noticed that the Great Bear's feet are more slender than the  average. Also he bears less upon the heel. He poises himself more upon  the toe, like the great swordsman we saw him to be that time in  Quebec.&#8221;
  &#8220;The distinctions are too fine for me, Tayoga, but I don't question  your own powers of observation. I accept your statement with gratitude  and joy, too, because now we know that Dave is alive, and somewhere in  the great northern forest of the Province of New York. I knew he could  not be dead, but it's a relief anyhow to have the proof. But as I see  no other traces, how is it, do you think, that he happens to be alone?&#8221;
  &#8220;The Great Bear may have been making a little scout by himself. I  still think that he is with Rogers and the rangers, and when we follow  his trail we are likely to find soon that he has rejoined them.&#8221;
  The traces led north and east until they came to rocky ground, where  they were lost, and Tayoga assumed from the fact that they were several  days old, otherwise he could have made them out even in the more  difficult region. But when the path, despite all his searching,  vanished in the air, he began to look higher than the earth. Soon he  smiled and said:
  &#8220;Ah, the Great Bear is as wise as the fox and the serpent combined.  He knows that a little chance may lead to great results, and so he  neglects none of the little chances.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't understand you,&#8221; said Robert, puzzled.
  The Onondaga bent over a bush and showed where a twig had been cut  off.
  &#8220;See the wound made by his knife,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and look! here is  another on a bush farther on. Both wounds are partly healed, showing  that the cut of the knife was made several days ago. It occurred to the  Great Bear that we might strike his trail some time or other, and when  he came to the stony uplift upon which his moccasins would leave no  sign, he made traces elsewhere. He knew the chance of our ever seeing  them was slight, and he may have made thousands of other traces that we  never will see, but the possibility that we would see some one of the  many became a probability.&#8221;
  &#8220;As you present it, it seems simple, Tayoga, but what an infinity of  pains he must have taken!&#8221;
  &#8220;The Great Bear is that kind of a man.&#8221;
  The hard, rocky ground extended several miles and their progress  over it was, of necessity, very slow, as Tayoga was compelled to look  with extreme care for the signs the hunter might have left. He found  the cut twigs five times and twice footprints where softer soil existed  between the rocks, making the proofs conclusive to both, and when they  emerged into a normal region beyond they picked up his defined and  clear trail once more.
  &#8220;I shall be glad to see the Great Bear,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;and I  think he will be as pleased to know certainly that we are alive as we  are to be assured that he is.&#8221;
  &#8220;He'd never desert us, and if you hadn't come to the Indian village  I think he'd have done so later on.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Great Bear is a man such as few men are. Now, his trail leads  on, straight and bold. He took no trouble to hide it, which proves that  he had friends in this region, and was not afraid to be followed. Here  he sat on a fallen log and rested a while.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you know that, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;See the prints in front of the log. They were made by the heels of  his moccasins only. He tilted his feet up until they rested merely on  the heels. The Great Bear could not have been in that attitude while  standing. Nay, there is more. The Great Bear sat down here not to rest  but to think.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's just supposition with you, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is not supposition at all, Dagaeoga, it is certainty. Look,  several little pieces of the bark on the dead log where the Great Bear  sat, are picked off. Here are the places from which they were taken,  and here are the fragments themselves lying on the ground. The Great  Bear must have been thinking very hard and he must have been in great  doubt to have had uneasy hands, because, as you and I know, Dagaeoga,  his mind and nerves are of the calmest.&#8221;
  &#8220;What, then, do you think was on his mind?&#8221;
  &#8220;He was undecided whether to go on towards Oneadatote or to turn  back and seek us anew. Here are three or four traces, a short and  detached trail leading in the direction from which we have come. Then  the traces suddenly turn. He sat down again and thought it over a  second time.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can't possibly know that he resumed his seat on the log!&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, I can, Dagaeoga. I wish all that we had to see was as  easy, because here is the second place on the log where he picked at  the bark. Mighty as the Great Bear is he cannot sit in two places at  once. Not Tododaho himself could do that.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's conclusive, and I find here at the end of the log his trail,  leading on toward the east.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he went fast, because the distance between his footprints  lengthens. But he did not do so long. He became very slow suddenly. The  space between the footprints shortens all at once. He turned aside,  too, from his course, and crept through the bushes toward the south.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you know that he crept?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because for many steps he rested his weight wholly on his toes. The  traces show it very clearly. The Great Bear was stalking something, and  it was not a foe.&#8221;
  &#8220;That, at least, is supposition, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not supposition, Dagaeoga, and while not absolute certainty it is a  great probability. The toeprints lead straight toward the tiny little  lake that you see shining through the foliage. It was game and not a  foe that the Great Bear was seeking. He wished to shoot a wild fowl.  Look, the edge of the lake here is low, and the tender water grasses  grow to a distance of several yards from the shore. It is just the  place where wild ducks or wild geese would be found, and the Great Bear  secured the one he wanted. If you will look closely, Dagaeoga, you will  see the faint trace of blood on the grass. Blood lasts a long time.  Manitou has willed that it should be so, because it is the life fluid  of his creatures. It was a wild goose that the Great Bear shot.&#8221;
  &#8220;And why not a wild duck?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because here are two of the feathers, and even Dagaeoga knows they  are the feathers of a goose and not of a duck. It was, too, the fattest  goose in the flock.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which you have no possible way of knowing, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I do, Dagaeoga. It was the fattest goose of the flock, because  the fattest goose of the flock was the one that so wise and skillful a  hunter as the Great Bear would, as a matter of course, select and kill.  Learn, O, Dagaeoga, to trail with your mind as well as with your eye,  and ear. The day may come when the white man will equal the red man in  intellect, but it is yet far off. The Great Bear was very, very hungry,  and we shall soon reach the place where he cleaned and cooked his  goose.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come, come, Tayoga! You may draw good conclusions from what you  see, but there are no prophets nowadays. You don't know anything about  the state of Dave's appetite, when he shot that goose, and you can't  predict with certainty that we'll soon come to the place where he made  it ready for the eating.&#8221;
  &#8220;I cannot, Dagaeoga! Why, I am doing it this very instant. Mind!  Mind! Did I not tell you to use your mind? O, Dagaeoga, when will you  learn the simpler things of life? The Great Bear would not have risked  a shot at a wild goose in enemy country, if he had not been very  hungry. Otherwise he would have waited until he rejoined the rangers to  obtain food. And, having risked his shot, and having obtained his  goose, which was the fattest in the flock, he became hungrier than  ever. And having risked so much he was willing to risk more in order to  complete the task he had undertaken, without which the other risks that  he had run would have been all in vain.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tayoga, I can almost believe that you have your dictionary with you  in your knapsack.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not in my knapsack, Dagaeoga, but in my head, where yours also  ought to be. Ah, here is where the Great Bear began to make  preparations to cook his goose! His trail wanders back and forth. He  was looking for fallen wood to build the fire. And there, in the little  sink between the hills, was where he built it. Even you, Dagaeoga, can  see the ashes and burnt ends of sticks. The Great Bear must have been  as hungry as a wolf to have eaten a whole goose, and the fattest goose  of the flock, too. How do I know he ate it all? Look in the grass and  leaves and you will find enough bones to make the complete frame of a  goose, and every bone is picked clean. Wild animals might have gleaned  on them, you say? No. Here is the trail of a wolf that came to the dip  after the Great Bear had gone, drawn by the savory odors, but he turned  back. He never really entered the dip. Why? When he stood at the edge  his acute and delicate senses told him no meat was left on the bones,  and a wolf neither makes idle exertion, nor takes foolish risk. He went  back at once. And if the wolf had not come, there is another reason why  I knew the Great Bear ate all the goose. He would not have thrown away  any of the bones with flesh still on them. He is too wise a man to  waste. He would have taken with him what was left of the goose. Having  finished his most excellent dinner, the Great Bear looked for a brook.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why a brook?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because he was thirsty. Everyone is thirsty after a heavy meal. He  turned to the right, as the ground slopes down in that direction. Even  you, Dagaeoga, know that one is more likely to find a brook in a valley  than on a hilltop. Here is the brook, a fine, clear little stream with  a sandy bottom, and here is where the Great Bear knelt and drank of the  cool water. The prints of his strong knees show like carving on a wall.  Finding that he was still thirsty he came back for another drink,  because the second prints are a little distance from the first.
  &#8220;Then, after rejoicing over the tender goose and his renewed  strength, he suddenly became very cautious. The danger from the  warriors, which he had forgotten or overlooked in his hunger, returned  in acute form to his mind. He came to the brook a third time, but not  to drink. He intended to wade in the stream that he might hide his  trail, which, as you well know, Dagaeoga, is the oldest and best of all  forest devices for such purposes. How many millions of times must the  people of the wilderness have used it!
  &#8220;Now the Great Bear had two ways to go in the water, up the stream  or down the stream, and you and I, Dagaeoga, think he went down the  stream, because the current leads on the whole eastward, which was the  way in which he wished to go. At least, we will choose that direction  and I will take one side of the bank and you the other.&#8221;
  They followed the brook more than a mile with questing eyes, and  Tayoga detected the point at which Willet had emerged, plunging anew  into the forest.
  &#8220;Warriors, if they had picked up his trail, could have followed the  brook as we did,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;but the object of the Great Bear was not  so much to hide his flight as to gain time. While we went slowly,  looking for the emergence of his trail, he went fast. Now I think he  meant to spend the night in the woods alone. The rangers must still  have been far away. If they had been near he would not have felt the  need of throwing off possible pursuit.&#8221;
  They followed the dim traces several hours, and then Tayoga  announced with certainty that the hunter had slept alone in the forest,  wrapped in his blanket.
  &#8220;He crept into this dense clump of bushes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and lay within  their heart, sheltered and hidden by them. You, Dagaeoga, can see where  his weight has pressed them down. Why, here is the outline of a human  body almost as clear and distinct as if it were drawn with black ink  upon white paper! And the Great Bear slept well, too. The bushes are  not broken or shoved aside except in the space merely wide enough to  contain his frame. Perhaps the goose was so very tender and his nerves  and tissues had craved it so much that they were supremely happy when  he gave it to them. That is why they rested so well.
  &#8220;In the morning the Great Bear resumed his journey toward the east.  He had no breakfast and doubtless he wished for another goose, but he  was refreshed and he was very strong. The traces are fainter than they  were, because the Great Bear was so vigorous that his feet almost  spurned the earth.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you think, Tayoga, that he'll soon turn aside again to hunt?  So strong a man as Dave won't go long without food, especially when the  forest is full of it. We've noticed everywhere that the war has caused  the game to increase greatly in numbers.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will depend upon the position of the force to which the Great  Bear belongs. If it is near he will not seek game, waiting for food  until he rejoins the rangers, but if they are distant he will look for  a deer or another goose, or maybe a duck. But by following we will see  what he did. It cannot be hidden from us. The forest has few secrets  from those who are born in it. Ah, what is this? The Great Bear hid in  a bush, and he leaped suddenly! Behold the distance between the  footprints! He saw something that alarmed him. It may have been a war  party passing, and of which he suddenly caught sight. If so we can soon  tell.&#8221;
  A hundred yards beyond the clump of bushes they found a broad trail,  indicating that at least twenty warriors had gone by, their line of  march leading toward the southeast.
  &#8220;They were in no hurry,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;as they had no fear of  enemies. Their steps are irregular, showing that sometimes they stopped  and talked. Doubtless they meant to join Montcalm, but as they can  travel much faster than an army they were taking their time about it.  We will now return to the bushes in which the Great Bear lay hidden  while he watched. The traces of his footsteps in the heart of the clump  are much deeper than usual, which proves that he stood there quite a  while. It is also another proof that the warriors stopped and talked  when they were near him, else he would not have remained in the clump  so long. It is likely, too, that the Great Bear followed them when they  resumed their journey. Yes, here is his trail leading from the bushes.  But it is faint, the Great Bear was stepping lightly and here is where  it merges with the trail of the warriors. He could not have been more  than three or four hundred yards behind them. The Great Bear was very  bold, or else they were very careless. He will not follow them long, as  he merely wishes to get a general idea of their course, it being his  main object to rejoin the rangers.&#8221;
  &#8220;And at this point he turned away from their trail,&#8221; said Robert,  after they had followed it about a mile. &#8220;He is now going due east, and  his traces lead on so straight that he must have known exactly where he  intended to go.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stated with much correctness,&#8221; said Tayoga in his precise school  English. &#8220;Dagaeoga is taking to heart my assertion that the mind is  intended for human use, and he is beginning to think a little. But we  shall have to stop soon for a while, because the night comes. We, too,  will sleep in the heart of the bushes as the Great Bear did.&#8221;
  &#8220;And glad am I to stop,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;My burden of buffalo robe and  deer and arms and ammunition is beginning to weigh on me. A buffalo  robe doesn't seem of much use on a warm, summer day, but it is such a  fine one and you took so much trouble to get it for me, Tayoga, that I  haven't had the heart to abandon it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is well that you have brought it, in spite of its weight,&#8221; said  the Onondaga, &#8220;as the night, at this height, is sure to be cold, and  the robe will envelop you in its warmth. See, the dark comes fast.&#8221;
  The sun sank behind the forest, and the twilight advanced, the  deeper dusk following in its trail, a cold wind began to blow out of  the north, and Robert, as Tayoga had predicted, was thankful now that  he had retained the buffalo robe, despite its weight. He wrapped it  around his body and sat on a blanket in a thicket. Tayoga, by his side,  used his two blankets in a similar manner, and they ate of the deer  which they had had the forethought to cook, and make ready for all  times.
  The dusk deepened into the thick dark, and the night grew colder,  but they were warm and at ease. Robert was full of courage and hope.  The elements and all things had served them so much that he was quite  sure they would succeed in everything they undertook. By and by, he  stretched himself on the blanket, and clothed from head to foot in the  great robe he slept the deep sleep of one who had toiled hard and well.  An hour later Tayoga also slept, but in another hour he awoke and sat  up, listening with all the marvelous powers of hearing that nature and  cultivation had given him.
  Something was stirring in the thicket, not any of the wild animals,  big or little, but a human being, and Tayoga knew the chances were a  hundred to one that it was a hostile human being. He put his ear to the  earth and the sound came more clearly. Now his wonderful gifts of  intuition and forest reasoning told him what it was. Slowly he rose  again, cleared himself of the blankets, and put his rifle upon them.  Then, loosening the pistol in his belt, but drawing his long hunting  knife, he crept from the thicket.
  Tayoga, despite his thorough white education and his constant  association with white comrades, was always an Indian first. Now, as he  stole from the thicket in the dark, knife in hand, he was the very  quintessence of a great warrior of the clan of the Bear, of the nation  Onondaga, of the great League of the Hodenosaunee. He was what his  ancestors had been for unnumbered generations, a primeval son of the  wilderness, seeking the life of the enemy who came seeking his.
  He kept to his hands and knees, and made no sound as he advanced,  but at intervals he dropped his ear to the ground, and heard the faint  rustling that was drawing nearer. He decided that it was a single  warrior who by some chance had struck their trail in the dusk, and who,  with minute pains and with slowness but certainty, was following it.
  His course took him about thirty yards among the bushes and then  through high grass growing luxuriantly in the open. In the grass his  eye also helped him, because at a point straight ahead the tall stems  were moving slightly in a direction opposed to the wind. He took the  knife in his teeth and went on, sure that bold means would be best.
  The stalking warrior who in his turn was stalked did not hear him  until he was near, and then, startled, he sprang to his feet, knife in  hand. Tayoga snatched his own from his teeth and stood erect facing  him. The warrior, a Huron, was the heavier though not the taller of the  two, and recognizing an enemy, a hated Iroquois, he stared fiercely  into the eyes that were so close to his. Then he struck, but, agile as  a panther, Tayoga leaped aside, and the next instant his own blade went  home. The Huron sank down without a sound, and the Onondaga stood over  him, the spirit of his ancestors swelling in fierce triumph.
  But the feeling soon died in the heart of Tayoga. His second nature,  which was that of his white training and association, prevailed. He was  sorry that he had been compelled to take life, and, dragging the heavy  body much farther away, he hid it in the bushes. Then, making a circle  through the forest to assure himself that no other enemies were near,  he went swiftly back to the thicket and lay down again between his  blankets. He had a curious feeling that he did not want Robert to know  what had happened.
  Tayoga remained awake the remainder of the night, and, although he  did not stir again from the thicket, he kept a vigilant watch. He would  hear any sound within a hundred yards and he would know what it was,  but there was none save the rustlings of the little animals, and dawn  came, peaceful and clear. Robert moved, threw off the buffalo robe and  stood up among the bushes.
  &#8220;A big sleep and a fine sleep, Tayoga,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;It was a good time for Dagaeoga to sleep,&#8221; said the Onondaga.
  &#8220;I was warm, and your Tododaho watched over me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, Dagaeoga, Tododaho was watching well last night.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you slept well, too, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;I slept as I should, Dagaeoga. No man can ask more.&#8221;
  &#8220;Philosophical and true. It's breakfast now, slices of deer, and  water of a brook. Deer is good, Tayoga, but I'm beginning to find I  could do without it for quite a long time. I envy Dave the fat goose he  had, and I don't wonder that he ate it all at one time. Maybe we could  find a juicy goose or duck this morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we have the deer and the Great Bear had nothing when he sought  the goose. We will even make the best of what we have, and take no  risk.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was merely a happy thought of mine, and I didn't expect it to be  accepted. My happiest thoughts are approved by myself alone, and so  I'll keep 'em to myself. My second-rate thoughts are for others, over  the heads of whom they will not pass.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dagaeoga is in a good humor this morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is because I slept so well last night. Now, having had a  sufficiency of the deer I shall seek a brook. I'm pretty sure to find  one in the low ground over there.&#8221;
  He started to the right, but Tayoga immediately suggested that he go  to the left&#8212;the hidden body of the warrior lay in the bushes on the  right&#8212;and Robert, never dreaming of the reason, tried the left where  he found plenty of good water. Tayoga also drank, and with some regret  they left the lair in the bushes.
  &#8220;It was a good house,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;It lacked only walls, a roof  and a floor, and it had an abundance of fresh air. I've known worse  homes for the night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Take up your buffalo robe again,&#8221; said the Onondaga, &#8220;because when  another night comes you will need it as before.&#8221;
  They shouldered their heavy burdens and resumed the trail of the  hunter, expecting that it would soon show a divergence from its  straight course.
  &#8220;The rangers seem to be farther away than we thought,&#8221; said Tayoga,  &#8220;and the Great Bear must eat. One goose, however pleasant the memory,  will not last forever. It is likely that he will turn aside again to  one of the little lakes or ponds that are so numerous in this region.&#8221;
  In two hours they found that he had done so, and this time his  victim was a duck, as the feathers showed. They saw the ashes where he  had cooked it, and as before only the bones were left. Evidently he had  lingered there some time, as Tayoga announced a distinctly fresher  trail, indicating that they were gaining upon him fast, and they  increased their own speed, hoping that they would soon overtake him.
  But the traces led on all day, and the next morning, after another  night spent in the thickets, Tayoga said that the Great Bear was still  far ahead, and it was possible they might not overtake him until they  approached the shores of Champlain.
  &#8220;But if necessary we'll follow him there, won't we, Tayoga?&#8221; said  Robert.
  &#8220;To Oneadatote and beyond, if need be,&#8221; said the Onondaga with  confidence.
