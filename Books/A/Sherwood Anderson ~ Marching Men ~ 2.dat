One Sunday afternoon three boys sat on a log on the side of the hill  that looked down into Coal Creek. From where they sat they could see  the workers of the night shift idling in the sun on Main Street. From  the coke ovens a thin line of smoke rose into the sky. A freight train  heavily loaded crept round the hill at the end of the valley. It was  spring and over even that hive of black industry hung a faint promise  of beauty. The boys talked of the life of people in their town and as  they talked thought each of himself.    
Although he had not been out of the valley and had grown strong and  big there, Beaut McGregor knew something of the outside world. It  isn't a time when men are shut off from their fellows. Newspapers and  magazines have done their work too well. They reached even into the  miner's cabin and the merchants along Main Street of Coal Creek stood  before their stores in the afternoon and talked of the doings of the  world. Beaut McGregor knew that life in his town was exceptional, that  not everywhere did men toil all day black and grimy underground, that  not all women were pale bloodless and bent. As he went about  delivering bread he whistled a song. "Take me back to Broadway," he  sang after the soubrette in a show that had once come to Coal Creek.    
Now as he sat on the hillside he talked earnestly while he  gesticulated with his hands. "I hate this town," he said. "The men  here think they are confoundedly funny. They don't care for anything  but making foolish jokes and getting drunk. I want to go away." His  voice rose and hatred flamed up in him. "You wait," he boasted. "I'll  make men stop being fools. I'll make children of them. I'll----"  Pausing he looked at his two companions.    
Beaut poked the ground with a stick. The boy sitting beside him  laughed. He was a short well--dressed black--haired boy with rings on  his fingers who worked in the town poolroom, racking the pool balls.  "I'd like to go where there are women with blood in them," he said.    
Three women came up the hill toward them, a tall pale brown-haired  woman of twenty-seven and two fairer young girls. The black-haired boy  straightened his tie and began thinking of a conversation he would  start when the women reached him. Beaut and the other boy, a fat  fellow, the son of a grocer, looked down the hill to the town over the  heads of the newcomers and continued in their minds the thoughts that  had made the conversation.    
"Hello girls, come and sit here," shouted the black-haired boy,  laughing and looking boldly into the eyes of the tall pale woman. They  stopped and the tall woman began stepping over the fallen logs, coming  to them. The two young girls followed, laughing. They sat down on the  log beside the boys, the tall pale woman at the end beside red-haired  McGregor. An embarrassed silence fell over the party. Both Beaut and  the fat boy were disconcerted by this turn to their afternoon's outing  and wondered how it would turn out.    
The pale woman began to talk in a low tone. "I want to get away from  here," she said, "I wish I could hear birds sing and see green things  grow."    
Beaut McGregor had an idea. "You come with me," he said. He got up and  climbed over the logs and the pale woman followed. The fat boy shouted  at them, relieving his own embarrassment by trying to embarrass them.  "Where're you going--you two?" he shouted.    
Beaut said nothing. He stepped over the logs to the road and began  climbing the hill. The tall woman walked beside him and held her  skirts out of the deep dust of the road. Even on this her Sunday gown  there was a faint black mark along the seams--the mark of Coal Creek.    
As McGregor walked his embarrassment left him. He thought it fine that  he should be thus alone with a woman. When she had tired from the  climb he sat with her on a log beside the road and talked of the  black-haired boy. "He has your ring on his finger," he said, looking  at her and laughing.    
She held her hand pressed tightly against her side and closed her  eyes. "The climbing hurts me," she said.    
Tenderness took hold of Beaut. When they went on again he walked  behind her, his hand upon her back pushing her up the hill. The desire  to tease her about the black-haired boy had passed and he wished he  had said nothing about the ring. He remembered the story the black-  haired boy had told him of his conquest of the woman. "More than  likely a mess of lies," he thought.    
Over the crest of the hill they stopped and rested, leaning against a  worn rail fence by the woods. Below them in a wagon a party of men  went down the hill. The men sat upon boards laid across the box of a  wagon and sang a song. One of them stood in the seat beside the driver  and waved a bottle. He seemed to be making a speech. The others  shouted and clapped their hands. The sounds came faint and sharp up  the hill.    
In the woods beside the fence rank grass grew. Hawks floated in the  sky over the valley below. A squirrel running along the fence stopped  and chattered at them. McGregor thought he had never had so delightful  a companion. He got a feeling of complete, good fellowship and  friendliness with this woman. Without knowing how the thing had been  done he felt a certain pride in it. "Don't mind what I said about the  ring," he urged, "I was only trying to tease you."    
The woman beside McGregor was the daughter of an undertaker who lived  upstairs over his shop near the bakery. He had seen her in the evening  standing in the stairway by the shop door. After the story told him by  the black-haired boy he had been embarrassed about her. When he passed  her standing in the stairway he went hurriedly along and looked into  the gutter.    
They went down the hill and sat on the log upon the hillside. A clump  of elders had grown about the log since his visits there with Cracked  McGregor so that the place was closed and shaded like a room. The  woman took off her hat and laid it beside her on the log. A faint  colour mounted to her pale cheeks and a flash of anger gleamed in her  eyes. "He probably lied to you about me," she said, "I didn't give him  that ring to wear. I don't know why I gave it to him. He wanted it. He  asked me for it time and again. He said he wanted to show it to his  mother. And now he has shown it to you and I suppose told lies about  me."    
Beaut was annoyed and wished he had not mentioned the ring. He felt  that an unnecessary fuss was being made about it. He did not believe  that the black-haired boy had lied but he did not think it mattered.    
He began talking of his father, boasting of him. His hatred of the  town blazed up. "They thought they knew him down there," he said,  "they laughed at him and called him 'Cracked.' They thought his  running into the mine just a crazy notion like a horse that runs into  a burning stable. He was the best man in town. He was braver than any  of them. He went in there and died when he had almost enough money  saved to buy a farm over here." He pointed down the valley.    
Beaut began to tell her of the visits to the hillside with his father  and described the effect of the scene on himself when he was a child.  "I thought it was paradise," he said.    
She put her hand on his arm and seemed to be soothing him like a  careful groom quieting an excitable horse. "Don't mind them," she  said, "you will go away after a time and make a place for yourself out  in the world."    
He wondered how she knew. A profound respect for her came over him.  "She is keen to guess that," he thought.    
He began to talk of himself, boasting and throwing out his chest. "I'd  like to have the chance to show what I can do," he declared. A thought  that had been in his mind on the winter day when Uncle Charlie Wheeler  put the name of Beaut upon him came back and he walked up and down  before the woman making grotesque motions with his hands as Cracked  McGregor had walked up and down before him.    
"I'll tell you what," he began and his voice was harsh. He had  forgotten the presence of the woman and half forgotten what had been  in his mind. He sputtered and glared over his shoulder up the hillside  as he struggled for words. "Oh to Hell with men!" he burst forth.  "They are cattle, stupid cattle." A fire blazed up in his eyes and a  confident ring came into his voice. "I'd like to get them together,  all of them," he said, "I'd like to make them----" Words failed him  and again he sat down on the log beside the woman. "Well I'd like to  lead them to an old mine shaft and push them in," he concluded  resentfully.

On the eminence Beaut and the tall woman sat and looked down into the  valley. "I wonder why we don't go there, mother and I," he said. "When  I see it I'm filled with the notion. I think I want to be a farmer and  work in the fields. Instead of that mother and I sit and plan of the  city. I'm going to be a lawyer. That's all we talk about. Then I come  up here and it seems as though this is the place for me."    
The tall woman laughed. "I can see you coming home at night from the  fields," she said. "It might be to that white house there with the  windmill, You would be a big man and would have dust in your red hair  and perhaps a red beard growing on your chin. And a woman with a baby  in her arms would come out of the kitchen door to stand leaning on the  fence waiting for you. When you came up she would put her arm around  your neck and kiss you on the lips. The beard would tickle her cheek.  You should have a beard when you grow older. Your mouth is so big."    
A strange new feeling shot through Beaut. He wondered why she had said  that and wanted to take hold of her hand and kiss her then and there.  He got up and looked at the sun going down behind the hill far away at  the other end of the valley. "We'd better be getting along back," he  said.    
The woman remained seated on the log. "Sit down," she said, "I'll tell  you something--something it's good for you to hear. You're so big and  red you tempt a girl to bother you. First though you tell me why you  go along the street looking into the gutter when I stand in the  stairway in the evening."    
Beaut sat down again upon the log, and thought of what the black-  haired boy had told him of her. "Then it was true--what he said about  you?" he asked.    
"No! No!" she cried, jumping up in her turn and beginning to pin on  her hat. "Let's be going."    
Beaut sat stolidly on the log. "What's the use bothering each other,"  he said. "Let's sit here until the sun goes down. We can get home  before dark."    
They sat down and she began talking, boasting of herself as he had  boasted of his father.    
"I'm too old for that boy," she said; "I'm older than you by a good  many years. I know what boys talk about and what they say about women.  I do pretty well. I don't have any one to talk to except father and he  sits all evening reading a paper and going to sleep in his chair. If I  let boys come and sit with me in the evening or stand talking with me  in the stairway it is because I'm lonesome. There isn't a man in town  I'd marry--not one."    
The speech sounded discordant and harsh to Beaut. He wished his father  were there rubbing his hands together and muttering rather than this  pale woman who stirred him up and then talked harshly like the women  at the back doors in Coal Creek. He thought again as he had thought  before that he preferred the black-faced miners drunk and silent to  their pale talking wives. On an impulse he told her that, saying it  crudely so that it hurt.    
Their companionship was spoiled. They got up and began to climb the  hill, going toward home. Again she put her hand to her side and again  he wished to put his hand at her back and push her up the hill.  Instead he walked beside her in silence, again hating the town.    
Halfway down the hill the tall woman stopped by the road-side.  Darkness was coming on and the glow of the coke ovens lighted the sky.  "One living up here and never going down there might think it rather  grand and big," he said. Again the hatred came. "They might think the  men who live down there knew something instead of being just a lot of  cattle."    
A smile came into the face of the tall woman and a gentler look stole  into her eyes. "We get at one another," she said, "we can't let one  another alone. I wish we hadn't quarrelled. We might be friends if we  tried. You have got something in you. You attract women. I've heard  others say that. Your father was that way. Most of the women here  would rather have been the wife of Cracked McGregor ugly as he was  than to have stayed with their own husbands. I heard my mother say  that to father when they lay quarrelling in bed at night and I lay  listening."    
The boy was overcome with the thought of a woman talking to him so  frankly. He looked at her and said what was in his mind. "I don't like  the women," he said, "but I liked you, seeing you standing in the  stairway and thinking you had been doing as you pleased. I thought  maybe you amounted to something. I don't know why you should be  bothered by what I think. I don't know why any woman should be  bothered by what any man thinks. I should think you would go right on  doing what you want to do like mother and me about my being a lawyer."    
He sat on a log beside the road near where he had met her and watched  her go down the hill. "I'm quite a fellow to have talked to her all  afternoon like that," he thought and pride in his growing manhood  crept over him.
