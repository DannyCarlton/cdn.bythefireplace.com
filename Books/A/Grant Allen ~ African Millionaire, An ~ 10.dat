"Seymour," my brother-in-law said, with a deep-drawn sigh, as we  left Lake George next day by the Rennselaer and Saratoga Railroad,  "no more Peter Porter for me, <i>if</i> you please! I'm sick of disguises.  Now that we know Colonel Clay is here in America, they serve no  good purpose; so I may as well receive the social consideration and  proper respect to which my rank and position naturally entitle me."    
"And which they secure for the most part (except from hotel clerks),  even in this republican land," I answered briskly.    
For in my humble opinion, for sound copper-bottomed snobbery,  registered A1 at Lloyd's, give <i>me</i> the free-born American citizen.    
We travelled through the States, accordingly, for the next four  months, from Maine to California, and from Oregon to Florida,  under our own true names, "Confirming the churches," as Charles  facetiously put it--or in other words, looking into the management  and control of railways, syndicates, mines, and cattle-ranches. We  inquired about everything. And the result of our investigations  appeared to be, as Charles further remarked, that the Sabeans who  so troubled the sons of Job seemed to have migrated in a body to  Kansas and Nebraska, and that several thousand head of cattle seemed  mysteriously to vanish, a la Colonel Clay, into the pure air of the  prairies just before each branding.    
However, we were fortunate in avoiding the incursions of the Colonel  himself, who must have migrated meanwhile on some enchanted carpet  to other happy hunting-grounds.    
It was chill October before we found ourselves safe back in New  York, en route for England. So long a term of freedom from the  Colonel's depredations (as Charles fondly imagined--but I will not  anticipate) had done my brother-in-law's health and spirits a world  of good; he was so lively and cheerful that he began to fancy his  tormentor must have succumbed to yellow fever, then raging in New  Orleans, or eaten himself ill, as we nearly did ourselves, on a  generous mixture of clam-chowder, terrapin, soft-shelled crabs,  Jersey peaches, canvas-backed ducks, Catawba wine, winter cherries,  brandy cocktails, strawberry-shortcake, ice-creams, corn-dodger,  and a judicious brew commonly known as a Colorado corpse-reviver.  However that may be, Charles returned to New York in excellent  trim; and, dreading in that great city the wiles of his antagonist,  he cheerfully accepted the invitation of his brother millionaire,  Senator Wrengold of Nevada, to spend a few days before sailing in  the Senator's magnificent and newly-finished palace at the upper  end of Fifth Avenue.    
"There, at least, I shall be safe, Sey," he said to me plaintively,  with a weary smile. "Wrengold, at any rate, won't try to take me  in--except, of course, in the regular way of business."    
Boss-Nugget Hall (as it is popularly christened) is perhaps the  handsomest brown stone mansion in the Richardsonian style on all  Fifth Avenue. We spent a delightful week there. The lines had fallen  to us in pleasant places. On the night we arrived Wrengold gave  a small bachelor party in our honour. He knew Sir Charles was  travelling without Lady Vandrift, and rightly judged he would prefer  on his first night an informal party, with cards and cigars, instead  of being bothered with the charming, but still somewhat hampering  addition of female society.    
The guests that evening were no more than seven, all told, ourselves  included--making up, Wrengold said, that perfect number, an octave.  He was a nouveau riche himself--the newest of the new--commonly  known in exclusive old-fashioned New York society as the Gilded  Squatter; for he "struck his reef" no more than ten years ago; and  he was therefore doubly anxious, after the American style, to be  "just dizzy with culture." In his capacity of Maecenas, he had  invited amongst others the latest of English literary arrivals in  New York--Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous poet, and leader of the  Briar-rose school of West-country fiction.    
"You know him in London, of course?" he observed to Charles, with  a smile, as we waited dinner for our guests.    
"No," Charles answered stolidly. "I have not had that honour.  We move, you see, in different circles."    
I observed by a curious shade which passed over Senator Wrengold's  face that he quite misapprehended my brother-in-law's meaning.  Charles wished to convey, of course, that Mr. Coleyard belonged to  a mere literary and Bohemian set in London, while he himself moved  on a more exalted plane of peers and politicians. But the Senator,  better accustomed to the new-rich point of view, understood Charles  to mean that <i>he</i> had not the entree of that distinguished coterie in  which Mr. Coleyard posed as a shining luminary. Which naturally  made him rate even higher than before his literary acquisition.    
At two minutes past the hour the poet entered. Even if we had not  been already familiar with his portrait at all ages in The Strand  Magazine, we should have recognised him at once for a genuine bard  by his impassioned eyes, his delicate mouth, the artistic twirl of  one gray lock upon his expansive brow, the grizzled moustache that  gave point and force to the genial smile, and the two white rows of  perfect teeth behind it. Most of our fellow-guests had met Coleyard  before at a reception given by the Lotus Club that afternoon, for  the bard had reached New York but the previous evening; so Charles  and I were the only visitors who remained to be introduced to him.  The lion of the hour was attired in ordinary evening dress, with  no foppery of any kind, but he wore in his buttonhole a dainty  blue flower whose name I do not know; and as he bowed distantly to  Charles, whom he surveyed through his eyeglass, the gleam of a big  diamond in the middle of his shirt-front betrayed the fact that the  Briar-rose school, as it was called (from his famous epic), had at  least succeeded in making money out of poetry. He explained to us a  little later, in fact, that he was over in New York to look after  his royalties. "The beggars," he said, "only gave me eight hundred  pounds on my last volume. I couldn't stand <i>that</i>, you know; for a  modern bard, moving with the age, can only sing when duly wound up;  so I've run across to investigate. Put a penny in the slot, don't  you see, and the poet will pipe for you."    
"Exactly like myself," Charles said, finding a point in common.  "<i>I'm</i> interested in mines; and I, too, have come over to look  after my royalties."    
The poet placed his eyeglass in his eye once more, and surveyed  Charles deliberately from head to foot. "Oh," he murmured slowly. He  said not a word more; but somehow, everybody felt that Charles was  demolished. I saw that Wrengold, when we went in to dinner, hastily  altered the cards that marked their places. He had evidently put  Charles at first to sit next the poet; he varied that arrangement  now, setting Algernon Coleyard between a railway king and a magazine  editor. I have seldom seen my respected brother-in-law so completely  silenced.    
The poet's conduct during dinner was most peculiar. He kept quoting  poetry at inopportune moments.    
"Roast lamb or boiled turkey, sir?" said the footman.    
"Mary had a little lamb," said the poet. "I shall imitate Mary."    
Charles and the Senator thought the remark undignified.    
After dinner, however, under the mellowing influence of some  excellent Roederer, Charles began to expand again, and grew lively  and anecdotal. The poet had made us all laugh not a little with  various capital stories of London literary society--at least two of  them, I think, new ones; and Charles was moved by generous emulation  to contribute his own share to the amusement of the company. He was  in excellent cue. He is not often brilliant; but when he chooses, he  has a certain dry vein of caustic humour which is decidedly funny,  though not perhaps strictly without being vulgar. On this particular  night, then, warmed with the admirable Wrengold champagne--the  best made in America--he launched out into a full and embroidered  description of the various ways in which Colonel Clay had deceived  him. I will not say that he narrated them in full with the same  frankness and accuracy that I have shown in these pages; he  suppressed not a few of the most amusing details--on no other  ground, apparently, than because they happened to tell against  himself; and he enlarged a good deal on the surprising cleverness  with which several times he had nearly secured his man; but still,  making all allowances for native vanity in concealment and addition,  he was distinctly funny--he represented the matter for once in its  ludicrous rather than in its disastrous aspect. He observed also,  looking around the table, that after all he had lost less by  Colonel Clay in four years of persecution than he often lost by  one injudicious move in a single day on the London Stock Exchange;  while he seemed to imply to the solid men of New York, that he  would cheerfully sacrifice such a fleabite as that, in return for  the amusement and excitement of the chase which the Colonel had  afforded him.    
The poet was pleased. "You are a man of spirit, Sir Charles," he  said. "I love to see this fine old English admiration of pluck and  adventure! The fellow must really have some good in him, after all.  I should like to take notes of a few of those stories; they would  supply nice material for basing a romance upon."    
"I hardly know whether I'm exactly the man to make the hero of a  novel," Charles murmured, with complacence. And he certainly didn't  look it.    
"<i>I</i> was thinking rather of Colonel Clay as the hero," the poet  responded coldly.    
"Ah, that's the way with you men of letters," Charles answered,  growing warm. "You always have a sneaking sympathy with the rascals."    
"That may be better," Coleyard retorted, in an icy voice, "than  sympathy with the worst forms of Stock Exchange speculation."    
The company smiled uneasily. The railway king wriggled. Wrengold  tried to change the subject hastily. But Charles would not be put  down.    
"You must hear the end, though," he said. "That's not quite the  worst. The meanest thing about the man is that he's also a  hypocrite. He wrote me <i>such</i> a letter at the end of his last  trick--here, positively here, in America." And he proceeded to give  his own version of the Quackenboss incident, enlivened with sundry  imaginative bursts of pure Vandrift fancy.    
When Charles spoke of Mrs. Quackenboss the poet smiled. "The worst  of married women," he said, "is--that you can't marry them; the  worst of unmarried women is--that they want to marry you." But when  it came to the letter, the poet's eye was upon my brother-in-law.  Charles, I must fain admit, garbled the document sadly. Still, even  so, some gleam of good feeling remained in its sentences. But  Charles ended all by saying, "So, to crown his misdemeanours, the  rascal shows himself a whining cur and a disgusting Pharisee."    
"Don't you think," the poet interposed, in his cultivated drawl, "he  may have really meant it? Why should not some grain of compunction  have stirred his soul still?--some remnant of conscience made him  shrink from betraying a man who confided in him? I have an idea,  myself, that even the worst of rogues have always some good in them.  I notice they often succeed to the end in retaining the affection  and fidelity of women."    
"Oh, I said so!" Charles sneered. "I told you you literary men have  always an underhand regard for a scoundrel."    
"Perhaps so," the poet answered. "For we are all of us human. Let  him that is without sin among us cast the first stone." And then he  relapsed into moody silence.    
We rose from table. Cigars went round. We adjourned to the  smoking-room. It was a Moorish marvel, with Oriental hangings.  There, Senator Wrengold and Charles exchanged reminiscences of  bonanzas and ranches and other exciting post-prandial topics; while  the magazine editor cut in now and again with a pertinent inquiry  or a quaint and sarcastic parallel instance. It was clear he had an  eye to future copy. Only Algernon Coleyard sat brooding and silent,  with his chin on one hand, and his brow intent, musing and gazing at  the embers in the fireplace. The hand, by the way, was remarkable  for a curious, antique-looking ring, apparently of Egyptian or  Etruscan workmanship, with a projecting gem of several large facets.  Once only, in the midst of a game of whist, he broke out with a  single comment.    
"Hawkins was made an earl," said Charles, speaking of some London  acquaintance.    
"What for?" asked the Senator.    
"Successful adulteration," said the poet tartly.    
"Honours are easy," the magazine editor put in.    
"And two by tricks to Sir Charles," the poet added.    
Towards the close of the evening, however--the poet still remaining  moody, not to say positively grumpy--Senator Wrengold proposed a  friendly game of Swedish poker. It was the latest fashionable  variant in Western society on the old gambling round, and few of us  knew it, save the omniscient poet and the magazine editor. It turned  out afterwards that Wrengold proposed that particular game because  he had heard Coleyard observe at the Lotus Club the same afternoon  that it was a favourite amusement of his. Now, however, for a while  he objected to playing. He was a poor man, he said, and the rest  were all rich; why should he throw away the value of a dozen golden  sonnets just to add one more pinnacle to the gilded roofs of a  millionaire's palace? Besides, he was half-way through with an ode  he was inditing to Republican simplicity. The pristine austerity  of a democratic senatorial cottage had naturally inspired him with  memories of Dentatus, the Fabii, Camillus. But Wrengold, dimly aware  he was being made fun of somehow, insisted that the poet must take  a hand with the financiers. "You can pass, you know," he said, "as  often as you like; and you can stake low, or go it blind, according  as you're inclined to. It's a democratic game; every man decides for  himself how high he will play, except the banker; and you needn't  take bank unless you want it."    
"Oh, if you insist upon it," Coleyard drawled out, with languid  reluctance, "I'll play, of course. I won't spoil your evening.  But remember, I'm a poet; I have strange inspirations."    
The cards were "squeezers"--that is to say, had the suit and the  number of pips in each printed small in the corner, as well as over  the face, for ease of reference. We played low at first. The poet  seldom staked; and when he did--a few pounds--he lost, with singular  persistence. He wanted to play for doubloons or sequins, and could  with difficulty be induced to condescend to dollars. Charles looked  across at him at last; the stakes by that time were fast rising  higher, and we played for ready money. Notes lay thick on the green  cloth. "Well," he murmured provokingly, "how about your inspiration?  Has Apollo deserted you?"    
It was an unwonted flight of classical allusion for Charles, and I  confess it astonished me. (I discovered afterwards he had cribbed  it from a review in that evening's Critic.) But the poet smiled.    
"No," he answered calmly, "I am waiting for one now. When it comes,  you may be sure you shall have the benefit of it."    
Next round, Charles dealing and banking, the poet staked on his  card, unseen as usual. He staked like a gentleman. To our immense  astonishment he pulled out a roll of notes, and remarked, in a quiet  tone, "I have an inspiration now. <i>Half-hearted</i> will do. I go five  thousand." That was dollars, of course; but it amounted to a  thousand pounds in English money--high play for an author.    
Charles smiled and turned his card. The poet turned his--and won  a thousand.    
"Good shot!" Charles murmured, pretending not to mind, though he  detests losing.    
"Inspiration!" the poet mused, and looked once more abstracted.    
Charles dealt again. The poet watched the deal with boiled-fishy  eyes. His thoughts were far away. His lips moved audibly. "Myrtle,  and kirtle, and hurtle," he muttered. "They'll do for three. Then  there's turtle, meaning dove; and that finishes the possible. Laurel  and coral make a very bad rhyme. Try myrtle; don't you think so?"    
"Do you stake?" Charles asked, severely, interrupting his reverie.    
The poet started. "No, pass," he replied, looking down at his card,  and subsided into muttering. We caught a tremor of his lips again,  and heard something like this: "Not less but more republican than  thou, Half-hearted watcher by the Western sea, After long years I  come to visit thee, And test thy fealty to that maiden vow, That  bound thee in thy budding prime For Freedom's bride--"    
"Stake?" Charles interrupted, inquiringly, again.    
"Yes, five thousand," the poet answered dreamily, pushing forward  his pile of notes, and never ceasing from his murmur: "For Freedom's  bride to all succeeding time. Succeeding; succeeding; weak word,  succeeding. Couldn't go five dollars on it."    
Charles turned his card once more. The poet had won again. Charles  passed over his notes. The poet raked them in with a far-away air,  as one who looks at infinity, and asked if he could borrow a pencil  and paper. He had a few priceless lines to set down which might  otherwise escape him.    
"This is play," Charles said pointedly. "<i>Will</i> you kindly attend to  one thing or the other?"    
The poet glanced at him with a compassionate smile. "I told you I  had inspirations," he said. "They always come together. I can't win  your money as fast as I would like, unless at the same time I am  making verses. Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck,  don't you see? I won a thousand on <i>half-hearted</i> and a thousand on  <i>budding</i>; if I were to back <i>succeeding</i>, I should lose, to a  certainty. You understand my system?"    
"I call it pure rubbish," Charles answered. "However, continue.  Systems were made for fools--and to suit wise men. Sooner or later  you <i>must</i> lose at such a stupid fancy."    
The poet continued. "For Freedom's bride to all <i>ensuing</i> time."    
"Stake!" Charles cried sharply. We each of us staked.    
"<i>Ensuing</i>," the poet murmured. "To all <i>ensuing</i> time. First-rate  epithet that. I go ten thousand, Sir Charles, on <i>ensuing</i>."    
We all turned up. Some of us lost, some won; but the poet had  secured his two thousand sterling.    
"I haven't that amount about me," Charles said, in that austerely  nettled voice which he always assumes when he loses at cards;  "but--I'll settle it with you to-morrow."    
"Another round?" the host asked, beaming.    
"No, thank you," Charles answered; "Mr. Coleyard's inspirations  come too pat for my taste. His luck beats mine. I retire from the  game, Senator."    
Just at that moment a servant entered, bearing a salver, with a  small note in an envelope. "For Mr. Coleyard," he observed; "and  the messenger said, <i>urgent</i>."    
Coleyard tore it open hurriedly. I could see he was agitated. His  face grew white at once.    
"I--I beg your pardon," he said. "I--I must go back instantly. My  wife is dangerously ill--quite a sudden attack. Forgive me, Senator.  Sir Charles, you shall have your revenge to-morrow."    
It was clear that his voice faltered. We felt at least he was a man  of feeling. He was obviously frightened. His coolness forsook him.  He shook hands as in a dream, and rushed downstairs for his  dust-coat. Almost as he closed the front door, a new guest entered,  just missing him in the vestibule.    
"Halloa, you men," he said, "we've been taken in, do you know? It's  all over the Lotus. The man we made an honorary member of the club  to-day is <i>not</i> Algernon Coleyard. He's a blatant impostor. There's  a telegram come in on the tape to-night saying Algernon Coleyard is  dangerously ill at his home in England."    
Charles gasped a violent gasp. "Colonel Clay!" he shouted, aloud.  "And once more he's done me. There's not a moment to lose. After  him, gentlemen! after him!"    
Never before in our lives had we had such a close shave of catching  and fixing the redoubtable swindler. We burst down the stairs in a  body, and rushed out into Fifth Avenue. The pretended poet had only  a hundred yards' start of us, and he saw he was discovered. But he  was an excellent runner. So was I, weight for age; and I dashed  wildly after him. He turned round a corner; it proved to lead  nowhere, and lost him time. He darted back again, madly. Delighted  with the idea that I was capturing so famous a criminal, I redoubled  my efforts--and came up with him, panting. He was wearing a light  dust-coat. I seized it in my hands. "I've got you at last!" I cried;  "Colonel Clay, I've got you!"    
He turned and looked at me. "Ha, old Ten Per Cent!" he called out,  struggling. "It's you, then, is it? Never, never to <i>you</i>, sir!" And  as he spoke, he somehow flung his arms straight out behind him, and  let the dust-coat slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being  new and smoothly silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw  me completely off my guard, and off my legs as well. I was clinging  to the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over  backward, in the mud of the street, and hurt my back seriously. As  for Colonel Clay, with a nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed  in his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.    
It was some seconds before I had sufficiently recovered my breath to  pick myself up again, and examine my bruises. By this time Charles  and the other pursuers had come up, and I explained my condition to  them. Instead of commending me for my zeal in his cause--which had  cost me a barked arm and a good evening suit--my brother-in-law  remarked, with an unfeeling sneer, that when I had so nearly caught  my man I might as well have held him.    
"I have his coat, at least," I said. "That may afford us a clue."  And I limped back with it in my hands, feeling horribly bruised and  a good deal shaken.    
When we came to examine the coat, however, it bore no maker's name;  the strap at the back, where the tailor proclaims with pride his  handicraft, had been carefully ripped off, and its place was taken  by a tag of plain black tape without inscription of any sort. We  searched the breast-pocket. A handkerchief, similarly nameless,  but of finest cambric. The side-pockets--ha, what was this? I drew  a piece of paper out in triumph. It was a note--a real find--the  one which the servant had handed to our friend just before at the  Senator's.    
We read it through breathlessly:--    
"DARLING PAUL,--I <i>told</i> you it was too dangerous. You should have  listened to me. You ought <i>never</i> to have imitated any real person. I  happened to glance at the hotel tape just now, to see the quotations  for Cloetedorps to-day, and what do you think I read as part of the  latest telegram from England? 'Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous  poet, is lying on his death-bed at his home in Devonshire.' By this  time all New York knows. Don't stop one minute. Say I'm dangerously  ill, and come away at once. Don't return to the hotel. I am removing  our things. Meet me at Mary's. Your devoted, MARGOT."    
"This is <i>very</i> important," Charles said. "This <i>does</i> give us a clue.  We know two things now: his real name is Paul--whatever else it may  be, and Madame Picardet's is Margot."    
I searched the pocket again, and pulled out a ring. Evidently he had  thrust these two things there when he saw me pursuing him, and had  forgotten or neglected them in the heat of the melee.    
I looked at it close. It was the very ring I had noticed on his  finger while he was playing Swedish poker. It had a large compound  gem in the centre, set with many facets, and rising like a pyramid  to a point in the middle. There were eight faces in all, some of  them composed of emerald, amethyst, or turquoise. But <i>one</i> face--the  one that turned at a direct angle towards the wearer's eye--was <i>not</i>  a gem at all, but an extremely tiny convex mirror. In a moment I  spotted the trick. He held this hand carelessly on the table while  my brother-in-law dealt; and when he saw that the suit and number of  his own card mirrored in it by means of the squeezers were better  than Charles's, he had "an inspiration," and backed his luck--or  rather his knowledge--with perfect confidence. I did not doubt,  either, that his odd-looking eyeglass was a powerful magnifier which  helped him in the trick. Still, we tried another deal, by way of  experiment--I wearing the ring; and even with the naked eye I was  able to distinguish in every case the suit and pips of the card that  was dealt me.    
"Why, that was almost dishonest," the Senator said, drawing back.  He wished to show us that even far-Western speculators drew a line  somewhere.    
"Yes," the magazine editor echoed. "To back your skill is legal;  to back your luck is foolish; to back your knowledge is--"    
"Immoral," I suggested.    
"Very good business," said the magazine editor.    
"It's a simple trick," Charles interposed. "I should have spotted  it if it had been done by any other fellow. But his patter about  inspiration put me clean off the track. That's the rascal's dodge.  He plays the regular conjurer's game of distracting your attention  from the real point at issue--so well that you never find out what  he's really about till he's sold you irretrievably."    
We set the New York police upon the trail of the Colonel; but of  course he had vanished at once, as usual, into the thin smoke of  Manhattan. Not a sign could we find of him. "Mary's," we found an  insufficient address.    
We waited on in New York for a whole fortnight. Nothing came of it.  We never found "Mary's." The only token of Colonel Clay's presence  vouchsafed us in the city was one of his customary insulting notes.  It was conceived as follows:--    
"O ETERNAL GULLIBLE!--Since I saw you on Lake George, I have run  back to London, and promptly come out again. I had business to  transact there, indeed, which I have now completed; the excessive  attentions of the English police sent me once more, like great  Orion, "sloping slowly to the west." I returned to America in order  to see whether or not you were still impenitent. On the day of my  arrival I happened to meet Senator Wrengold, and accepted his kind  invitation solely that I might see how far my last communication  had had a proper effect upon you. As I found you quite obdurate,  and as you furthermore persisted in misunderstanding my motives, I  determined to read you one more small lesson. It nearly failed; and  I confess the accident has affected my nerves a little. I am now  about to retire from business altogether, and settle down for life  at my place in Surrey. I mean to try just one more small coup; and,  when that is finished, Colonel Clay will hang up his sword, like  Cincinnatus, and take to farming. You need no longer fear me. I have  realised enough to secure me for life a modest competence; and as  I am not possessed like yourself with an immoderate greed of gain,  I recognise that good citizenship demands of me now an early  retirement in favour of some younger and more deserving rascal. I  shall always look back with pleasure upon our agreeable adventures  together; and as you hold my dust-coat, together with a ring and  letter to which I attach importance, I consider we are quits, and  I shall withdraw with dignity. Your sincere well-wisher, CUTHBERT  CLAY, Poet."    
"Just like him!" Charles said, "to hold this one last coup over my  head in terrorem. Though even when he has played it, why should I  trust his word? A scamp like that may say it, of course, on purpose  to disarm me."    
For my own part, I quite agreed with "Margot." When the Colonel was  reduced to dressing the part of a known personage I felt he had  reached almost his last card, and would be well advised to retire  into Surrey.    
But the magazine editor summed up all in a word. "Don't believe  that nonsense about fortunes being made by industry and ability,"  he said. "In life, as at cards, two things go to produce  success--the first is chance; the second is cheating."
