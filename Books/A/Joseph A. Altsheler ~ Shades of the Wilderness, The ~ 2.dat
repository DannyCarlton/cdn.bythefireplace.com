  But the night remained very quiet. Harry and Dalton, growing tired  of sitting, walked about the camp, and looked again to their horses,  which, saddled and bridled, were nevertheless allowed to nip the grass  as best they could at the end of their lariats. The last embers of the  fire went out, but the moon and stars remained bright, and they saw  dimly the sleeping forms of Lee and his generals. Harry, who had seen  nothing strange in Meade's lack of pursuit, now wondered at it. Surely  when the news of Vicksburg came the exultant Army of the Potomac would  follow, and try to deliver a crushing blow.
  It was revealed to him as he stood silent in the moonlight that a  gulf had suddenly yawned before the South. The slash of Grant's sword  in the West had been terrible, and the wound that it made could not be  cured easily. And the Army of Northern Virginia had not only failed in  its supreme attempt, but a great river now flowed between it and  Virginia. If the Northern leaders, gathering courage anew, should hurl  their masses upon Lee's retreating force, neither skill nor courage  might avail to save them. He suddenly beheld the situation in all its  desperation; he shivered from head to foot.
  Dalton saw the muscles of Harry's face quivering, and he noticed a  pallor that came for an instant.
  &#8220;I understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had thought of it already. If a Northern  general like Lee or Stonewall Jackson were behind us we might never get  back across the Potomac. It's somewhat the same position that we were  in after Antietam.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we've no Stonewall Jackson now to help us.&#8221;
  Again that lump rose in Harry's throat. The vision of the sober  figure on Little Sorrel, leading his brigades to victory, came before  him, but it was a vision only.
  &#8220;It's strange that we've not come in contact with their scouts or  cavalry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In that fight with Pleasanton we saw what horsemen  they've become, and a force of some kind must be hanging on our rear.&#8221;
  &#8220;If it's there, Sherburne and his troop will find it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I can detect signs of the enemy now,&#8221; said Harry, putting  his glasses to his eyes. &#8220;See that hill far behind us. Can't you catch  the gleam of lights on it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I can,&#8221; replied Dalton, also using glasses. &#8220;Four lights  are there, and they are winking, doubtless to lights on another hill  too far away for us to see.&#8221;
  &#8220;It shows that the enemy at least is watching, and that while we may  retreat unattacked it will not be unobserved. Hark! do you hear that,  George? It's rifle shots, isn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and a lot of 'em, but they're a long distance away. I don't  think we could hear 'em at all if it were not night time.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it means something! There they go again! I believe it's a heavy  skirmish and it's in the direction in which Sherburne rode.&#8221;
  &#8220;The general's up. It's likely that one of us will be sent to see  what it's all about.&#8221;
  General Lee and his whole staff had risen and were listening  attentively. The faint sound of many shots still came, and then a  sharper, more penetrating crash, as if light field guns were at work.  The commander beckoned to Harry.
  &#8220;Ride toward it,&#8221; he said briefly, &#8220;and return with a report as soon  as you can.&#8221;
  Harry touched his cap, sprang upon his horse and galloped away. He  knew that other messengers would be dispatched also, but, as he had  been sent first, he wished to arrive first. He found a path among the  trees along which he could make good speed, and, keeping his mind fixed  on the firing, he sped forward.
  Thousands of soldiers lay asleep in the woods and fields on either  side of him, but the thud of the horse's hoofs awakened few of them.  Nor did the firing disturb them. They had fought a great battle three  days long, and then after a tense day of waiting under arms, they had  marched hard. What to them was the noise made by an affair of outposts,  when they had heard so long the firing of a hundred and fifty thousand  rifles and three or four hundred big guns? Not one in a hundred stood  up to see.
  The country grew rougher, and Harry was compelled to draw his horse  down to a walk. But the firing, a half-mile or more ahead, maintained  its volume, and as he approached through thick underbrush, being able  to find no other way, he dismounted and led his horse. Presently he saw  beads of flame appearing among the bushes, seen a moment, then gone  like a firefly, and as he went further he heard voices. He had no doubt  that it was the Southern pickets in the undergrowth, and, calling  softly, he received confirmatory replies.
  A rifleman, a tall, slender fellow in ragged butternut, appeared  beside him, and, recognizing Harry's near-gray uniform as that of an  officer, said:
  &#8220;They're dismounted cavalry on the other side of a creek that runs  along over there among the bushes. I don't think they mean any real  attack. They expect to sting us a little an' find out what we're  about.&#8221;
  &#8220;Seems likely to me too. They aren't strong enough, of course, for  an attempt at rushing us. What troops are in here in the woods on our  side?&#8221;
  &#8220;Captain Sherburne's cavalry, sir. They're a bit to our right, an'  they're dismounted too. You'll find the captain himself on a little  knoll about a hundred yards away.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Harry, and leading his horse he reached the knoll, to  find the rifleman's statement correct. Sherburne was kneeling behind  some bushes, trying with the aid of glasses and moonlight to pick out  the enemy.
  &#8220;That you, Harry?&#8221; he said, glancing back.
  &#8220;Yes, Captain. The general has sent me to see what you and the rest  of you noisy fellows are doing.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shooting across a creek at an enemy who first shot at us. It's only  under provocation that we've roused the general and his staff from  sleep. Use your glasses and see what you can make out in those bushes  on the other side! Keep down, Harry! For Heaven's sake keep down! That  bullet didn't miss you more than three inches. You wouldn't be much  loss to the army, of course, but you're my personal friend.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks for your advice. I intend to stay so far down that I'll lie  almost flat.&#8221;
  He meant to keep his word, too. The warning had been a stern one.  Evidently the sharpshooters who lay in the thickets on the Union side  of the creek were of the first quality.
  &#8220;There's considerable moonlight,&#8221; whispered Sherburne, &#8220;and you  mustn't expose an inch of your face. I take it that we have Custer's  cavalry over there, mixed with a lot of scouts and skirmishers from the  Northwest, Michigan and Wisconsin, most likely. They're the boys who  can use the rifles in the woods. Had to do it before they came here,  and they're a bad lot to go up against.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a pretty heavy fire for a mere scouting party. If they want to  discover our location they can do it without wasting so much powder and  lead.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think it's more than a scout. They must have discovered long  since just where we are. I imagine they mean to shake our nerve by  constant buzzing and stinging. I fancy that Meade and his generals  after deciding not to pursue us have changed their minds, perhaps under  pressure from Washington, and mean to cut us off if they can.&#8221;
  &#8220;A little late.&#8221;
  &#8220;But not too late. We're still in the enemy's country. The whole  population is dead against us, and we can't make a move that isn't  known within an hour to the Union leaders. I tell you, Harry, that if  we didn't have a Lee to lead I'd be afraid that we'd never get out of  Pennsylvania.&#8221;
  &#8220;But we have a Lee and the question is settled. What a volley that  was! Didn't you feel the twigs and leaves falling on your face?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it went directly over our heads. It's a good thing we're lying  so close. Perhaps they intend to force a passage of the creek and  stampede at least a portion of our camp.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you're here to prevent it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am. They can't cross that creek in face of our fire. We're good  night-hawks. Every boy in the South knows the night and the woods, and  here in the bush we're something like Indians.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm the descendant of a famous Indian fighter myself,&#8221; said Harry.  And there, surrounded by deep gloom and danger, the spirit of his  mighty ancestor, the great Henry Ware, descended upon him once more. An  orderly had taken their horses to the rear, where they would be out of  range of the bullets, and, as they crouched low in the bushes,  Sherburne looked curiously at him.
  Harry's face as he turned from the soldier to the Indian fighter of  old had changed. To Sherburne's fascinated gaze the eyes seemed  amazingly vivid and bright, like those of one who has learned to see in  the dark. The complexion was redder&#8212;Henry Ware had always burned red  instead of brown&#8212;like that of one who sleeps oftener in the open air  than in a house. His whole look was dominant, compelling and fierce, as  he leaned on his elbows and studied the opposing thickets through his  glasses.
  The glasses even did not destroy the illusion. To Sherburne, who had  learned Harry's family history, the great Henry Ware was alive, and in  the flesh before him. He felt with all the certainty of truth that the  Union skirmishers in the thicket could not escape the keen eyes that  sought them out.
  &#8220;I can see at least twenty men creeping about among the bushes, and  seeking chances for shots,&#8221; whispered Harry.
  &#8220;I knew that you would see them.&#8221;
  It was Harry's turn to give a look of curiosity.
  &#8220;What do you mean, Captain?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;I knew that you had good eyes and I believed that with the aid of  the glasses you would be able to trace figures, despite the shelter of  the bushes. Study the undergrowth again, will you, Harry, and tell me  what more you can see there?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't need to study it. I can tell at one look that they're  gathering a force. Maybe they mean to rush the creek at a shallow  place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is that force moving in any direction?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it's going down the creek.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we'll go down the creek with it. We mustn't be lacking in  hospitality.&#8221;
  Sherburne drew a whistle from his pocket and blew a low call upon  it. Scores of shadowy figures rose from the undergrowth, and followed  his lead down the stream. Harry was still able to see that the force on  the other side was increasing largely in numbers, but Sherburne  reminded him that his duties, as far as the coming skirmish was  concerned, were over.
  &#8220;General Lee didn't send you here to get killed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He wants  you instead to report how many of us get killed. You know that while  the general is a kind man he can be stern, too, and you're not to take  the risk. The orderly is behind that hill with your horse and mine.&#8221;
  Harry, with a sigh, fell back toward the hill. But he did not yet go  behind it, where the orderly stood. Instead he lay down among the trees  on the slope, where he could watch what was going forward, and once  more his face turned to the likeness of the great Indian fighter.
  He saw Sherburne's dismounted troop and others, perhaps five hundred  in all, moving slowly among the bushes parallel with the stream, and he  saw a force which he surmised to be of about equal size, creeping along  in the undergrowth on the other side. He followed both bodies with his  glasses. With long looking everything became clearer and clearer. The  moonlight had to him almost the brilliancy of day.
  His eyes followed the Union force, until it came to a point where  the creek ran shallow over pebbles. Then the Union leader raised his  sword, uttered a cry of command, and the whole force dashed at the  ford. The cry met its response in an order from Sherburne, and the  thickets flamed with the Southern rifles.
  The advantage was wholly with the South, standing on the defense in  dark undergrowth, and the Union troop, despite its desperate attempts  at the ford, was beaten back with great loss.
  Harry waited until the result was sure, and then he walked slowly  over the hill toward the point, where the orderly was waiting with the  horses. The man, who knew him, handed him the reins of his mount,  saying at the same time:
  &#8220;I've a note for you, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;For me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir. It was handed to me about fifteen minutes ago by a large  man in our uniform, whom I didn't know.&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably a dispatch that I'm to carry to General Lee.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir. It's addressed to you.&#8221;
  The note was written in pencil on a piece of coarse gray paper,  folded several times, but with a face large enough to show Harry's name  upon it. He wondered, but said nothing to the sentinel, and did not  look at the note again, until he had ridden some distance.
  He stopped in a little glade where the moonlight fell clearly. He  still heard scattered firing behind him, but he knew that the skirmish  was in reality over, and he concluded that no further attempt by Union  detachments to advance would be made in the face of such vigilance. He  could report to General Lee that the rear of his army was safe. So he  would delay and look at the letter that had come to him out of the  mysterious darkness.
  The superscription was in a large, bold hand, and read:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIEUTENANT HARRY KENTON, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STAFF OF GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE, C. S. A., <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.
  He felt instinctively that something uncommon was coming, and, as  most people do when they are puzzled at the appearance of a letter, he  looked at it some seconds before opening it. Then he read:
  MR. KENTON:
  I have warned you twice before, once when Jefferson Davis was  inaugurated at Montgomery, and once again in Virginia. I told you that  the South could never win. I told you that she might achieve brilliant  victories, and she may achieve them even yet, but they will avail her  nothing. Victories permit her to maintain her position for the time  being, but they do not enable her to advance. A single defeat causes  her to lose ground that she can never regain.
  I tell you this as a warning. Although your enemy, I have seen you  more than once and talked with you. I like you and would save your life  if I could. I would induce you, if I could, to leave the army and  return to your home, but that I know to be impossible. So, I merely  tell you that you are fighting for a cause now lost. Perhaps it is  pride on my part to remind you that my early predictions have come  true, and perhaps it is a wish that the thought I may plant in your  mind will spread to others. You have lost at Gettysburg a hope and an  offensive that you can never regain, and Grant at Vicksburg has given a  death blow to the Western half of the Confederacy.
  As for you, I wish you well.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WILLIAM J. SHEPARD.
  Harry stared in amazement at this extraordinary communication, and  read it over two or three times. He was not surprised that Shepard  should be near, and that he should have been inside the Confederate  lines, but that he should leave a letter, and such a letter, for him  was uncanny. His first feeling, wonder, was succeeded by anger. Did  Shepard really think that he could influence him in such a way, that he  could plant in his mind a thought that would spread to others of his  age and rank and weaken the cause for which he fought? It was a  singular idea, but Shepard was a singular man.
  But perhaps pride in recalling the prediction that he had made long  ago was Shepard's stronger motive, and Harry took fire at that also.  The Confederacy was not beaten. A single defeat&#8212;no, it was not a  defeat, merely a failure to win&#8212;was not mortal, and as for the West,  the Confederacy would gather itself together there and overwhelm Grant!
  Then came a new emotion, a kind of gratitude to Shepard. The man was  really a friend, and would do him a service, if it could be done,  without injuring his own cause! He could not feel any doubt of it, else  the spy would not have taken the risk to send him such a letter. He  read it for the last time, then tore it into little pieces which he  entrusted to the winds.
  The firing behind him had died completely, and there was no sound  but the rustle of dry leaves in the light wind, nothing to tell that  there had been sharp fighting along the creek, and that men lay dead in  the forest. The moon and the stars clothed everything in a whitish  light, that seemed surcharged with a powerful essence, and this essence  was danger.
  The spirit of the great forest ranger descended upon him once more,  and he read the omens, all of which were sinister. He foresaw terrible  campaigns, mighty battles in the forest, and a roll of the dead so long  that it seemed to stretch away into infinity.
  Then he shook himself violently, cast off the spell, and rode  rapidly back with his report. Lee had risen and was standing under a  tree. He was fully dressed and his uniform was trim and unwrinkled.  Harry thought anew as he rode up, what a magnificent figure he was. He  was the only great man he ever saw who really looked his greatness.  Nothing could stir that calm. Nothing could break down that loftiness  of manner. Harry was destined to feel then, as he felt many times  afterward, that without him the South had never a chance. And the  choking came in his throat again, as he thought of him who was gone, of  him who had been the right arm of victory, the hammer of Thor.
  But he hid all these feelings as he quickly dismounted and saluted  the commander-in-chief.
  &#8220;What have you seen, Lieutenant Kenton?&#8221; asked Lee.
  &#8220;A considerable detachment of the enemy tried to force the passage  of the creek in our right rear. They were met by Captain Sherburne's  troop dismounted, and three companies of infantry, and were driven back  after a sharp fight.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very good. Captain Sherburne is an alert officer.&#8221;
  He turned away, and Harry, giving his horse to an orderly, again  resumed his old position under a tree, out of hearing of the generals,  but in sight. Dalton was not there, but he knew that skirmishing had  occurred in other directions, and doubtless the Virginian had been sent  on an errand like his own.
  He had a sense of rest and realization as he leaned back against the  tree. But it was mental tension, not physical, for which relief came,  and Shepard, much more than the battle at the creek, was in his  thoughts.
  The strong personality of the spy and his seeming omniscience  oppressed him again. Apparently he was able to go anywhere, and nothing  could be hidden from him. He might be somewhere in the circling shadows  at that very moment, watching Lee and his lieutenants. His pulses  leaped. Shepard had achieved an extraordinary influence over him, and  he was prepared to believe the impossible.
  He stood up and stared into the bushes, but sentinels stood there,  and no human being could pass their ring unseen. Presently Dalton came,  made a brief report to General Lee and joined his comrade. Harry was  glad of his arrival. The presence of a comrade brought him back to  earth and earth's realities. The sinister shadows that oppressed him  melted away and he saw only the ordinary darkness of a summer night.
  The two sat side by side. Dalton perhaps drew as much strength as  Harry from the comradeship, and they watched other messengers arrive  with dispatches, some of whom rolled themselves in their blankets at  once, and went to sleep, although three, who had evidently slept in the  day, joined Harry and Dalton in their vigil.
  Harry saw that the commander-in-chief was holding a council at that  hour, nearer morning than midnight. A general kicked some of the pieces  of burned wood together and fanned them into a light flame, enough to  take away the slight chill that was coming with the morning. The men  stood around it, and talked a long time, although it seemed to Harry  that Lee said least. Nevertheless his tall figure dominated them all.  Now and then Harry saw his face in the starshine, and it bore its  habitual grave and impassive look.
  The youth did not hear a word that was said, but his imaginative  power enabled him to put himself in the place of the  commander-in-chief. He knew that no man, however great his courage,  could fail to appreciate his position in the heart of a hostile  country, with a lost field behind him, and with superior numbers  hovering somewhere in his rear or on his flank. He realized then to the  full the critical nature of their position and what a mighty task Lee  had to save the army.
  One of his young comrades whispered to him that the Potomac, the  barrier between North and South, was rising, flooded by heavy rains in  both mountains and lowlands, and that a body of Northern cavalry had  already destroyed a pontoon bridge built by the South across it. They  might be hemmed in, with their backs to an unfordable river, and an  enemy two or three times as numerous in front.
  &#8220;Don't you worry,&#8221; whispered Dalton, with sublime confidence. &#8220;The  general will take us to Virginia.&#8221;
  Harry projected his imagination once more. He sought to put himself  in the place of Lee, receiving all the reports and studying them,  trying to measure space that could not be measured, and to weigh a  total that could not be weighed. Greatness and responsibility were  compelled to pay thrice over for themselves, and he was glad that he  was only a young lieutenant, the chief business of whom was to fetch  and carry orders.
  Shafts of sunlight were piercing the eastern foliage when the  council broke up, and shortly after daylight the Southern army was  again on the march, with Northern cavalry and riflemen hanging on its  flanks and rear. Harry was permitted to rejoin, for a while, his  friends of the Invincibles and he found Colonel Leonidas Talbot and  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire riding very erect, a fine color  in their faces.
  &#8220;You come from headquarters, Harry, and therefore you are  omniscient,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot. &#8220;We heard firing in the night. What  did it mean?&#8221;
  &#8220;Only skirmishers, Colonel. I think they wanted to annoy us, but  they paid the price.&#8221;
  &#8220;Inevitably. Our general is as dangerous in retreat as in advance. I  fancy that General Meade will not bring up his lagging forces until we  near the Potomac.&#8221;
  &#8220;They say it's rising, sir, and that it will be very hard to cross.&#8221;
  &#8220;That creates a difficulty but not an impossibility. Ordinary men  yield to difficulties, men like our commander-in-chief are overcome  only by impossibilities. But the further we go, Harry, the more  reconciled I grow to our withdrawal. I have seen scarcely a friendly  face among the population. I would not have us thrust ourselves upon  people who do not like us. It would go very hard with our kindly  Southern nature to have to rule by force over people who are in fact  our brethren. Defensive wars are the just wars, and perhaps it will be  really better for us to retire to Virginia and protect its sacred soil  from the tread of the invader. Eh, Hector?&#8221;
  &#8220;Right, as usual, Leonidas. The reasons for our retirement are most  excellent. We have already spoken of the fact that Philadelphia might  prove a Capua for our young troops, and now we are relieved from the  chance of appearing as oppressors. It can never be said of us by the  people of Pennsylvania that we were tyrants. It's an invidious task to  rule over the unwilling, even when one rules with justice and wisdom.  It's strange, perhaps, Leonidas, but it's a universal truth, that  people would rather be ruled by themselves in a second rate manner than  by the foreigner in a first rate manner. Now, the government of our  states is attacked by Northern critics, but such as it is, it is ours  and it's our first choice. Do we bore you, Harry?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not at all, sir. I never listen to either you or Colonel Talbot  without learning something.&#8221;
  The two colonels bowed politely.
  &#8220;I have wished for some time to speak to you about a certain matter,  Hector,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot.
  &#8220;What is it, Leonidas?&#8221;
  &#8220;During the height of that tremendous artillery fire from Little  Round Top I was at a spot where I could see the artillerymen very well  whenever the smoke lifted. Several times, I noticed an officer  directing the fire of the guns, and I don't think I could have been  mistaken in his identity.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, Leonidas, you were not. I too observed him, and we could not  possibly be mistaken. It was John Carrington, of course.&#8221;
  &#8220;Dear old John Carrington, who was with us at West Point, the  greatest artilleryman in the world. And he was facing us, when the  fortunes of the South were turning on a hair. If any other man had been  there, directing those guns, we might have taken Cemetery Hill.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true, Leonidas, but it was not possible for any other man to  be in such a place at such a time. Granting that such a crisis should  arise and that it should arise at Gettysburg you and I would have known  long before that John would be there with the guns to stop us. Why, we  saw that quality in him all the years we were with him at West Point.  The world has never seen and never will see another such artilleryman  as John Carrington.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good old John. I hope he wasn't killed.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I hope so too, from the bottom of my heart. But we'll know  before many days.&#8221;
  &#8220;How will you find out?&#8221; asked Harry curiously.
  Both colonels laughed genially.
  &#8220;Because he will send us signs, unmistakable signs,&#8221; replied Colonel  Talbot.
  &#8220;I don't understand, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;His signs will be shells, shrapnel and solid shot. We may not have  a battle this week or next week, but a big one is bound to come some  time or other and then if any section of the Northern artillery shows  uncommon deadliness and precision we'll know that Carrington is there.  Why, we can recognize his presence as readily as the deer scents the  hunter. We'll have many notes to compare with him when the war is  over.&#8221;
  Harry sincerely hoped that the three would meet in friendship around  some festive table, and he was moved by the affection and admiration  the two colonels held for Carrington. Doubtless the great  artilleryman's feelings toward them were the same.
  They went into camp once more that night in a pleasant rolling  country of high hills, rich valleys, scattered forests, and swift  streams of clear water. Harry liked this Northern land, which was yet  not so far from the South. It was not more beautiful than his own  Kentucky, but it was much trimmer and neater than the states toward the  Gulf. He saw all about him the evidences of free labor, the proof that  man worked more readily, and with better results, when success or  failure were all his own.
  He was too young to spend much time in concentrated thinking, but as  he looked upon the neat Pennsylvania houses and farms and the  cultivated fields he felt the curse of black slavery in the South, but  he felt also that it was for the South itself to abolish it, and not  for the armed hand of the outsider, an outsider to whom its removal  meant no financial loss and dislocation.
  Despite himself his mind dwelt upon these things longer than before.  He disliked slavery, his father disliked it, and nearly all their  friends and relatives, and here they were fighting for it, as one of  the two great reasons of the Civil War. He felt anew how strangely  things come about, and that even the wisest cannot always choose their  own courses as they wish them.
  A fire, chiefly for cooking purposes, had been built for the general  and his staff in a cove surrounded by trees. A small cold spring gushed  from the side of a hill, flowed down the center of the cove, and then  made its way through the trees into the wider world beyond. It was a  fine little spring, and before the general came, the younger members of  the staff knelt and drank deeply at it. It brought thoughts of home to  all these young rovers of the woods, who had drunk a thousand times  before at just such springs as this.
  Soon Lee and his generals sat there on the stones or on the moss.  Longstreet, Stuart, Pickett, Alexander, Ewell, Early, Hill and many  others, some suffering from wounds, were with their commander, while  the young officers who were to fetch and carry sat on the fringe in the  woods, or stretched themselves on the turf.
  Harry was in the group, but except in extreme emergency he would not  be on duty that night, as he had already been twenty-four hours in the  saddle. Nevertheless he was not yet sleepy, and lying on his blanket,  he watched the leaders confer, as they had conferred every other night  since the Battle of Gettysburg. He was aware, too, that the air was  heavy with suspense and anxiety. He breathed it in at every breath.  Cruel doubt was not shown by words or actions, but it was an atmosphere  which one could not mistake.
  Word had been brought in the afternoon by hard riders of Stuart that  the Potomac was still rising. It could not be forded and the active  Northern cavalry was in between, keeping advanced parties of the  Southern army from laying pontoons. Every day made the situation more  desperate, and it could not be hidden from the soldiers, who,  nevertheless, marched cheerfully on, in the sublime faith that Lee  would carry them through.
  Harry knew that if the Army of the Potomac was not active in pursuit  its cavalrymen and skirmishers were. As on the night before, he heard  the faint report of shots, and he knew that rough work was going  forward along the doubtful line, where the fringes of the two armies  almost met. But hardened so much was he that he fell asleep while the  generals were still in anxious council, and the fitful firing continued  in the distant dark.
