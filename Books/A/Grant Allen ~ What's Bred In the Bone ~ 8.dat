Mrs. Clifford returned from Chetwood Court that clay in by no means  such high spirits as when she went there. In the first place, she  hadn't succeeded in throwing Elma and Granville Kelmscott into one  another's company at all, and in the second place Elma had talked  much under her very nose, for half-an-hour at a stretch, with the  unknown young painter fellow. When Elma was asked out anywhere  else in the country for the next six weeks or so, Mrs. Clifford  made up her mind strictly to inquire in private, before committing  herself to an acceptance, whether that dangerous young man was  likely or not to be included in the party.    
For Mrs. Clifford admitted frankly to herself that Cyril was  dangerous; as dangerous as they make them. He was just the right  age; he was handsome, he was clever, his tawny brown beard had the  faintest little touch of artistic redness, and was trimmed and  dressed with provoking nicety. He was an artist too; and girls  nowadays, you know, have such an unaccountable way of falling in  love with men who can paint, or write verses, or play the violin,  or do something foolish of that sort, instead of sticking fast to  the solid attractions of the London Stock Exchange or of ancestral  acres.    
Mrs. Clifford confided her fears that very night to the sympathetic  ear of the Companion of the Militant and Guardian Saints of the  British Empire.    
"Reginald," she said solemnly, "I told you the other day, when you  asked about it, Elma wasn't in love. And at the time I was right,  or very near it. But this afternoon I've had an opportunity of  watching them both together, and I've half changed my mind. Elma  thinks a great deal too much altogether, I'm afraid, about this  young Mr. Waring."    
"How do you know?" Mr. Clifford asked, staring her hard in the  face, and nodding solemnly.    
The British matron hesitated. "How do I know anything?" she answered  at last, driven to bay by the question. "I never know how. I only  know I know it. But whatever we do we must be careful not to let  Elma and the young man get thrown together again. I should say myself  it wouldn't be a bad plan if we were to send her away somewhere for  the rest of the summer, but I can tell you better about all this  to-morrow."    
Elma, for her part, had come home from Chetwood Court more full  than ever of Cyril Waring. He looked so handsome and so manly that  afternoon at the Holkers'. Elma hoped she'd be asked out where he  was going to be again.    
She sat long in her own bedroom, thinking it over with herself,  while the candle burnt down in its socket very low, and the house  was still, and the rain pattered hard on the roof overhead, and her  father and mother were discussing her by themselves downstairs in  the drawing-room.    
She sat long on her chair without caring to begin undressing. She  sat and mused with her hands crossed on her lap. She sat and thought,  and her thoughts were all about Cyril Waring.    
For more than an hour she sat there dreamily, and told herself over,  one by one, in long order, the afternoon's events from beginning  to the end of them. She repeated every word Cyril had spoken  in her ear. She remembered every glance, every look he had darted  at her. She thought of that faint pressure of his hand as he said  farewell. The tender blush came back to her brown cheek once more  with maidenly shame as she told it all over. He was so handsome  and so nice, and so very, very kind, and, perhaps, after this, she  might never again meet him. Her bosom heaved. She was conscious  of a new sense just aroused within her.    
Presently her heart began to beat more violently. She didn't know  why. It had never beaten in her life like that before--not even in  the tunnel, nor yet when Cyril came up to-day and spoke first to  her. Slowly, slowly, she rose from her seat. The fit was upon her.  Could this be a dream? Some strange impulse made her glide forward  and stand for a minute or two irresolute, in the middle of the room.  Then she turned round, once, twice, thrice, half unconsciously. She  turned round, wondering to herself all the while what this strange  thing could mean; faster, faster, faster, her heart within her  beating at each turn with more frantic haste and speed than ever.  For some minutes she turned, glowing with red shame, yet unable to  stop, and still more unable to say to herself why or wherefore.    
At first that was all. She merely turned and panted. But as she  whirled and whirled, new moods and figures seemed to force themselves  upon her. She lifted her hands and swayed them about above her head  gracefully. She was posturing she knew, but why she had no idea.  It all came upon her as suddenly and as uncontrollably as a blush.  She was whirling around the room, now slow, now fast, but always  with her arms held out lissom, like a dancing-girl's. Sometimes  her body bent this way, and sometimes that, her hands keeping time  to her movements meanwhile in long graceful curves, but all as if  compelled by some extrinsic necessity.    
It was an instinct within her over which she had no control. Surely,  surely, she must be possessed. A spirit that was not her seemed to  be catching her round the waist, and twisting her about, and making  her spin headlong over the floor through this wild fierce dance.  It was terrible, terrible. Yet she could not prevent it. A force  not her own seemed to sustain and impel her.    
And all the time, as she whirled, she was conscious also of some  strange dim need. A sense of discomfort oppressed her arms. She  hadn't everything she required for this solitary orgy. Something  more was lacking her. Something essential, vital. But what on earth  it could be she knew not; she knew not.    
By-and-by she paused, and, as she glanced right and left, the sense  of discomfort grew clearer and more vivid. It was her hands that  were wrong. Her hands were empty. She must have something to fill  them. Something alive, lithe, curling, sinuous. These wavings  and swayings, to this side and to that, seemed so meaningless and  void--without some life to guide them. There was nothing for her  to hold; nothing to tame and subdue; nothing to cling and writhe  and give point to her movements. Oh! heavens, how horrible!    
She drew herself up suddenly, and by dint of a fierce brief effort  of will repressed for awhile the mad dance that overmastered her.  The spirit within her, if spirit it were, kept quiet for a moment,  awed and subdued by her proud determination. Then it began once  more and led her resistlessly forward. She moved over to the chest  of drawers still rhythmically and with set steps, but to the phantom  strain of some unheard low music. The music was running vaguely  through her head all the time--wild Aeolian music--it sounded like  a rude tune on a harp or zither. And surely the cymbals clashed now  and again overhead; and the timbrel rang clear; and the castanets  tinkled, keeping time with the measure. She stood still and listened.  No, no, not a sound save the rain on the roof. It was the music of  her own heart, beating irregularly and fiercely to an intermittent  lilt, like a Hungarian waltz or a Roumanian tarantella.    
By this time, Elina was thoroughly frightened. Was she going mad?  she asked herself, or had some evil spirit taken up his abode within  her? What made her spin and twirl about like this--irresponsibly,  unintentionally, irrepressibly, meaninglessly? Oh, what would her  mother say, if only she knew all? And what on earth would Cyril  Waring think of her?    
Cyril Waring! Cyril Waring! It was all Cyril Waring. And yet, if  he knew--oh, mercy, mercy!    
Still, in spite of these doubts, misgivings, fears, she walked over  towards the chest of drawers with a firm and rhythmical tread, to  the bars of the internal music that rang loud through her brain,  and began opening one drawer after another in an aimless fashion.  She was looking for something--she didn't know what; and she never  could rest now until she'd found it.    
Drawer upon drawer she opened and shut wearily, but nothing that  her eyes fell upon seemed to suit her mood. Dresses and jackets and  underlinen were there; she glanced at them all with a deep sense  of profound contempt; none of these gewgaws of civilized life could  be of any use to supply the vague want her soul felt so dimly and  yet so acutely. They were dead, dead, dead, so close and clinging!  Go further! Go further! At last she opened the bottom drawer of  all, and her eye fell askance upon a feather boa, curled up at the  bottom--soft, smooth, and long; a winding, coiling, serpentine  boa. In a second, she had fallen upon it bodily with greedy hands,  and was twisting it round her waist, and holding it high and low,  and fighting fiercely at times, and figuring with it like a posturant.  Some dormant impulse of her race seemed to stir in her blood, with  frantic leaps and bounds, at its first conscious awakening. She  gave herself up to it wildly now. She was mad. She was mad. She  was glad. She was happy.    
Then she began to turn round again, slowly, slowly, slowly. As she  turned, she raised the boa now high above her head; now held it  low on one side, now stooped down and caressed it. At times, as she  played with it, the lifeless thing seemed to glide from her grasp  in curling folds and elude her; at others, she caught it round the  neck like a snake, and twisted it about her arm, or let it twine  and encircle her writhing body. Like a snake! like a snake! That  idea ran like wildfire through her burning veins. It was a snake,  indeed, she wanted; a real live snake; what would she not have  given, if it were only Sardanapalus!    
Sardanapalus, so glossy, so beautiful, so supple, that glorious green  serpent, with his large smooth coils, and his silvery scales, and  his darting red tongue, and his long lithe movements. Sardanapalus,  Sardanapalus, Sardanapalus! The very name seemed to link itself  with the music in her head. It coursed with her blood. It rang  through her brain. And another as well. Cyril Waring, Cyril Waring,  Cyril Waring, Cyril Waring! Oh! great heavens, what would Cyril  Waring say now, if only he could see her in her mad mood that  moment!    
And yet it was not she, not she, not she, but some spirit, some  weird, some unseen power within her. It was no more she than that  boa there was a snake. A real live snake. Oh, for a real live snake!  And then she could dance--tarantel, tarantella--as the spirit within  her prompted her to dance it.    
"Faster, faster," said the spirit; and she answered him back,  "Faster!"    
Faster, faster, faster, faster she whirled round the room; the  boa grew alive; it coiled about her; it strangled her. Her candle  failed; the wick in the socket flickered and died; but Elma danced  on, unheeding, in the darkness. Dance, dance, dance, dance; never  mind for the light! Oh! what madness was this? What insanity had  come over her? Would her feet never stop? Must she go on till she  dropped? Must she go on for ever?    
Ashamed and terrified with her maidenly sense, overawed and  obscured by this hateful charm, yet unable to stay herself, unable  to resist it, in a transport of fear and remorse, she danced on  irresponsibly. Check herself she couldn't, let her do what she  would. Her whole being seemed to go forth into that weird, wild  dance. She trembled and shook. She stood aghast at her own shame.  She had hard work to restrain herself from crying aloud in her  horror.    
At last, a lull, a stillness, a recess. Her limbs seemed to yield  and give way beneath her. She half fainted with fatigue. She  staggered and fell. Too weary to undress, she flung herself upon  the bed, just as she was, clothes and all. Her overwrought nerves  lost consciousness at once. In three minutes she was asleep,  breathing fast but peacefully.
