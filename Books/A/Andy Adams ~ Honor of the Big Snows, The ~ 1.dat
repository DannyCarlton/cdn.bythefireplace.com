   &quot;Listen, John&#8212;I hear music&#8212;&quot; 
  The words came in a gentle whisper from the woman's lips. One  white,  thin hand lifted itself weakly to the rough face of the man who  was  kneeling beside her bed, and the great dark eyes from which he had   hidden his own grew luminously bright for a moment, as she whispered   again: 
  &quot;John&#8212;I hear&#8212;music&#8212;&quot; 
  A sigh fluttered from her lips. The man's head drooped until it  rested  very near to her bosom. He felt the quiver of her hand against  his  cheek, and in its touch there was something which told John  Cummins  that the end of all life had come for him and for her. His  heart beat  fiercely, and his great shoulders shook with the agony that  was eating  at his soul. 
  &quot;Yes, it is the pretty music, my M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he murmured softly,  choking  back his sobs. &quot;It is the pretty music in the skies.&quot; 
  The hand pressed more tightly against his face. 
  &quot;It's not the music in the skies, John. It is real&#8212;REAL music that  I  hear&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;It's the sky music, my sweet M&eacute;lisse! Shall I open the door so  that  we can hear it better?&quot; 
  The hand slipped from his cheek. Cummins lifted his head, slowly   straightening his great shoulders as he looked down upon the white   face, from which even the flush of fever was disappearing, as he had   seen the pale glow of the northern sun fade before a thickening snow.   He stretched his long, gaunt arms straight up to the low roof of the   cabin, and for the first time in his life he prayed&#8212;prayed to the God   who had made for him this world of snow and ice and endless forest   very near to the dome of the earth, who had given him this woman, and   who was now taking her from him. 
  When he looked again at the woman, her eyes were open, and there   glowed in them still the feeble fire of a great love. Her lips, too,   pleaded with him in their old, sweet way, which always meant that he   was to kiss them, and stroke her hair, and tell her again that she was   the most beautiful thing in the whole world. 
  &quot;My M&eacute;lisse!&quot; 
  He crushed his face to her, his sobbing breath smothering itself in   the soft masses of her hair, while her arms rose weakly and fell   around his neck. He heard the quick, gasping struggle for breath   within her bosom, and, faintly again, the words: 
  &quot;It&#8212;is&#8212;the&#8212;music&#8212;of&#8212;my&#8212;people!&quot; 
  &quot;It is the music of the angels in the skies, my sweet M&eacute;lisse! It  is  OUR music. I will open the door.&quot; 
  The arms had slipped from his shoulders. Gently he ran his rough   fingers through the loose glory of the woman's hair, and stroked her   face as softly as he might have caressed the cheek of a sleeping   child. 
  &quot;I will open the door, M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  His moccasined feet made no sound as he moved across the little  room  which was their home. At the door he paused and listened; then he   opened it, and the floods of the white night poured in upon him as he   stood with his eyes turned to where the cold, pale flashes of the   aurora were playing over the pole. There came to him the hissing,   saddening song of the northern lights&#8212;a song of vast, unending   loneliness, which they two had come to know as the music of the skies. 
  Beyond that mystery-music there was no sound. To the eyes of John   Cummins there was no visible movement of life. And yet he saw signs of   it&#8212;signs which drew his breath from him in choking gulps, and which   sent him out into the night, so that the woman might not hear. 
  It was an hour past midnight at the post, which had the Barren  Lands  at its back door. It was the hour of deep slumber for its  people; but  to-night there was no sleep for any of them. Lights burned  dimly in  the few rough log homes. The company's store was aglow, and  the  factor's office, a haven for the men of the wilderness, shot one   gleaming yellow eye out into the white gloom. The post was awake. It   was waiting. It was listening. It was watching. 
  As the woman's door opened, wide and brimful of light, a door of  one  of the log houses opened, and then another, and out into the  night,  like dim shadows, trod the moccasined men from the factor's  office,  and stood there waiting for the word of life or death from  John  Cummins. In their own fashion these men, who, without knowing it,   lived very near to the ways of God, sent mute prayers into the starry   heavens that the most beautiful thing in the world might yet be spared   to them. 
  It was just two summers before that this beautiful thing had come  into  Cummins' life, and into the life of the post. Cummins,  red-headed,  lithe as a cat, big-souled as the eternal mountain of the  Crees, and  the best of the company's hunters, had brought M&eacute;lisse  thither as his  bride. Seventeen rough hearts had welcomed her. They  had assembled  about that little cabin in which the light was shining  now, speechless  in their adoration of this woman who had come among  them, their caps  in their hands, their faces shining, their eyes  shifting before the  glorious ones that looked at them and smiled at  them as the woman  shook their hands, one by one. 
  Perhaps she was not strictly beautiful, as most people judge; but  she  was beautiful here, four hundred miles beyond civilization. Mukee,  the  half-Cree, had never seen a white woman, for even the factor's  wife  was part Chippewayan; and no one of the others went down to the  edge  of the southern wilderness more than once each twelvemonth or so. 
  Melisse's hair was brown and soft, and it shone with a sunny glory   that reached far back into their conception of things dreamed of but   never seen. Her eyes were as blue as the early wild flowers that came   after the spring floods, and her voice was the sweetest sound that had   ever fallen upon their ears. So these men thought when Cummins first   brought home his wife, and the masterpiece which each had painted in   his soul and brain was never changed. Each week and month added to the   deep-toned value of that picture, as the passing of a century might   add to a Raphael or a Vandyke. 
  The woman became more human, and less an angel, of course, but that   only made her more real, and allowed them to become acquainted with   her, to talk with her, and to love her more. There was no thought of   wrong, for the devotion of these men was a great, passionless love   unhinting of sin. Cummins and his wife accepted it, and added to it   when they could, and were the happiest pair in all that vast   Northland. 
  The girl&#8212;she was scarce more than budding into womanhood&#8212;fell   happily into the ways of her new life. She did nothing that was   elementally unusual, nothing more than any pure woman reared in the   love of God and of a home would have done. In her spare hours she   began to teach the half-dozen wild little children about the post, and   every Sunday she told them wonderful stories out of the Bible. She   ministered to the sick, for that was a part of her code of life.   Everywhere she carried her glad smile, her cheery greeting, her   wistful earnestness, to brighten what seemed to her the sad and lonely   lives of these silent men of the North. 
  And she succeeded, not because she was unlike other millions of her   kind, but because of the difference between the fortieth degree and   the sixtieth&#8212;the difference in the viewpoint of men who fought   themselves into moral shreds in the big game of life and those who   lived a thousand miles nearer to the dome of the earth. 
  A few days before there had come a wonderful event in the history  of  the company's post. A new life was born into the little cabin of   Cummins and his wife. After this the silent, wordless worship of their   people was filled with something very near to pathos. Cummins' wife   was a mother! She was one of them now, an indissoluble part of their   existence&#8212;a part of it as truly as the strange lights for ever   hovering over the pole, as surely as the countless stars that never   left the night skies, as surely as the endless forests and the deep   snows! 
  Then had come the sudden change, and the gloom, that brought with  it  the shadow of death, fell like a pall upon the post, stifling its   life, and bringing with it a grief that those who lived there had   never known before. 
  There came to them no word from Cummins now. 
  He stood for a moment before his lighted door, and then went back,  and  the word passed softly from one to another that the most beautiful   thing in the world was still living her sweet life in that little   cabin at the end of the clearing. 
  &quot;You hear the music in the skies&#8212;now, my M&eacute;lisse?&quot; whispered the  man,  kneeling beside her again. &quot;It is very pretty to-night!&quot; 
  &quot;It was not that,&quot; repeated the woman. 
  She attempted to stroke his face, but Cummins saw nothing of the   effort, for the hand lay all but motionless. He saw nothing of the   fading softness that glowed in the big, loving eyes, for his own eyes   were blinded by a hot film. And the woman saw nothing of the hot film,   so torture was saved them both. But suddenly the woman quivered, and   Cummins heard a thrilling sound. 
  &quot;It is the music!&quot; she panted. &quot;John, John, it is&#8212;the  music&#8212;of&#8212;my&#8212;  people!&quot; 
  The man straightened himself, his face turned to the open door. He   heard it now! Was it the blessed angels coming for his M&eacute;lisse? He   rose, a sobbing note in his throat, and went, his arms stretched out,   to meet them. He had never heard a sound like that&#8212;never in all his   life in this endless wilderness. 
  He went from the door out into the night, and, step by step,  through  the snow toward the black edge of the spruce forest. The sobs  fell  chokingly from his lips, and his arms were still reaching out to  greet  this messenger of the God of his beloved; for Cummins was a man  of the  wild and mannerless ways of a savage world, and he knew not  what to  make of this sweetness that came to them from out of the  depths of the  black forest. 
  &quot;My M&eacute;lisse! My M&eacute;lisse!&quot; he sobbed. 
  A figure came from the shadows, and with the figure came the music,   sweet and soft and low. John Cummins stopped and turned his face   straight up to the sky. His heart died within him. 
  The music ceased, and when he looked again the figure was close to   him, staggering as it walked, and a face white and thin and starved   came with it. It was a boy's face. 
  &quot;For the museek of the violon&#8212;somet'ing to eat!&quot; he heard, and the   thin figure swayed and fell almost into his arms. The voice came weak   again. &quot;Thees is Jan&#8212;Jan Thoreau&#8212;and his violon&#8212;&quot; 
  The woman's bloodless face and her great staring dark eyes greeted   them as they entered the cabin. As the man knelt beside her again, and   lifted her head against his breast, she whispered once more: 
  &quot;It is the&#8212;music&#8212;of my people&#8212;the violin!&quot; 
  John Cummins turned his head. 
  &quot;Play!&quot; he breathed. 
  &quot;Ah, the white angel is seek&#8212;ver' seek,&quot; murmured Jan, and he drew   his bow gently across the strings of his violin. 
  From the instrument there came something so soft and sweet that  John  Cummins closed his eyes as he held the woman against his breast  and  listened. Not until he opened them again, and felt a strange chill   against his cheek, did he know that his beloved's soul had gone from   him on the gentle music of Jan Thoreau's violin.
