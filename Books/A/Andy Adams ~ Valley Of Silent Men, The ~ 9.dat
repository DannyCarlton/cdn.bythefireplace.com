  That morning Kent ate a breakfast that would have amazed Doctor   Cardigan and would have roused a greater caution in Inspector  Kedsty  had he known of it. While eating he strengthened the bonds  already  welded between himself and Mercer. He feigned great  uneasiness over  the condition of Mooie, who he knew was not  fatally hurt because  Mercer had told him there was no fracture.  But if he should happen to  die, he told Mercer, it would mean  something pretty bad for them, if  their part in the affair leaked  out. 
  As for himself, it would make little difference, as he was &quot;in   bad&quot; anyway. But he did not want to see a good friend get into   trouble on his account. Mercer was impressed. He saw himself an   instrument in a possible murder affair, and the thought terrified   him. Even at best, Kent told him, they had given and taken bribes,  a  fact that would go hard with them unless Mooie kept his mouth  shut.  And if the Indian knew anything out of the way about Kedsty,  it was  mighty important that he, Mercer, get hold of it, for it  might prove a  trump card with them in the event of a showdown with  the Inspector of  Police. As a matter of form, Mercer took his  temperature. It was  perfectly normal, but it was easy for Kent to  persuade a notation on  the chart a degree above. 
  &quot;Better keep them thinking I'm still pretty sick,&quot; he assured   Mercer. &quot;They won't suspect there is anything between us then.&quot; 
  Mercer was so much in sympathy with the idea that he suggested   adding another half-degree. 
  It was a splendid day for Kent. He could feel himself growing   stronger with each hour that passed. Yet not once during the day  did  he get out of his bed, fearing that he might be discovered.  Cardigan  visited him twice and had no suspicion of Mercer's  temperature chart.  He dressed his wound, which was healing fast.  It was the fever which  depressed him. There must be, he said, some  internal disarrangement  which would soon clear itself up.  Otherwise there seemed to be no very  great reason why Kent should  not get on his feet. He smiled  apologetically. 
  &quot;Seems queer to say that, when a little while ago I was telling   you it was time to die,&quot; he said. 
  That night, after ten o'clock, Kent went through his setting-up   exercises four times. He marveled even more than the preceding  night  at the swiftness with which his strength was returning. Half  a dozen  times the little devils of eagerness working in his blood  prompted him  to take to the window at once. 
  For three days and nights thereafter he kept his secret and added   to his strength. Doctor Cardigan came in to see him at intervals,  and  Father Layonne visited him regularly every afternoon. Mercer  was his  most frequent visitor. On the third day two things  happened to create  a little excitement. Doctor Cardigan left on a  four-day journey to a  settlement fifty miles south, leaving Mercer  in charge&#8212;and Mooie came  suddenly out of his fever into his  normal senses again. The first  event filled Kent with joy. With  Cardigan out of the way there would  be no immediate danger of the  discovery that he was no longer a sick  man. But it was the  recovery of Mooie from the thumping he had  received about the head  that delighted Mercer. He was exultant. With  the quick reaction of  his kind he gloated over the fact before Kent.  He let it be known  that he was no longer afraid, and from the moment  Mooie was out of  danger his attitude was such that more than once Kent  would have  taken keen pleasure in kicking him from the room. Also,  from the  hour he was safely in charge of Doctor Cardigan's place,  Mercer  began to swell with importance. Kent saw the new danger and  began  to humor him. He flattered him. He assured him that it was a   burning shame Cardigan had not taken him into partnership. He   deserved it. And, in justice to himself, Mercer should demand that   partnership when Cardigan returned. He, Kent, would talk to Father   Layonne about it, and the missioner would spread the gospel of  what  ought to be among others who were influential at the Landing.  For two  days he played with Mercer as an angler plays with a  treacherous fish.  He tried to get Mercer to discover more about  Mooie's reference to  Kedsty. But the old Indian had shut up like a  clam. 
  &quot;He was frightened when I told him he had said things about the   Inspector,&quot; Mercer reported. &quot;He disavowed everything. He shook  his  head&#8212;no, no, no. He had not seen Kedsty. He knew nothing  about him. I  can do nothing with him, Kent.&quot; 
  He had dropped his &quot;sirs,&quot; also his servant-like servility. He   helped to smoke Kent's cigars with the intimacy of proprietorship,   and with offensive freedom called him &quot;Kent.&quot; He spoke of the   Inspector as &quot;Kedsty,&quot; and of Father Layonne as &quot;the little   preacher.&quot; He swelled perceptibly, and Kent knew that each hour of   that swelling added to his own danger. 
  He believed that Mercer was talking. Several times a day he heard   him in conversation with the guard, and not infrequently Mercer  went  down to the Landing, twirling a little reed cane that he had  not dared  to use before. He began to drop opinions and information  to Kent in a  superior sort of way. On the fourth day word came  that Doctor Cardigan  would not return for another forty-eight  hours, and with unblushing  conceit Mercer intimated that when he  did return he would find big  changes. Then it was that in the  stupidity of his egotism he said: 
  &quot;Kedsty has taken a great fancy to me, Kent. He's a square old   top, when you take him right. Had me over this afternoon, and we   smoked a cigar together. When I told him that I looked in at your   window last night and saw you going through a lot of exercises, he   jumped up as if some one had stuck a pin in him. 'Why, I thought  he  was sick&#8212;BAD!' he said. And I let him know there were better  ways of  making a sick man well than Cardigan's. 'Give them plenty  to eat,' I  said. 'Let 'em live normal,' I argued. 'Look at Kent,  for instance,' I  told him. 'He's been eating like a bear for a  week, and he can turn  somersaults this minute!' That topped him  over, Kent. I knew it would  be a bit of a surprise for him, that I  should do what Cardigan  couldn't do. He walked back and forth,  black as a hat&#8212;thinking of  Cardigan, I suppose. Then he called in  that Pelly chap and gave him  something which he wrote on a piece  of paper. After that he shook  hands with me, slapped me on the  shoulder most intimately, and gave me  another cigar. He's a keen  old blade, Kent. He doesn't need more than  one pair of eyes to see  what I've done since Cardigan went away!&quot; 
  If ever Kent's hands had itched to get at the throat of a human   being, the yearning convulsed his fingers now. At the moment when  he  was about to act Mercer had betrayed him to Kedsty! He turned  his face  away so that Mercer could not see what was in his eyes.  Under his body  he concealed his clenched hands. Within himself he  fought against the  insane desire that was raging in his blood, the  desire to leap on  Mercer and kill him. If Cardigan had reported  his condition to Kedsty,  it would have been different. He would  have accepted the report as a  matter of honorable necessity on  Cardigan's part. But Mercer&#8212;a toad  blown up by his own wind, a  consummate fiend who would sell his best  friend, a fool, an ass&#8212; 
  For a space he held himself rigid as a stone, his face turned away   from Mercer. His better sense won. He knew that his last chance   depended upon his coolness now. And Mercer unwittingly helped him  to  win by slyly pocketing a couple of his cigars and leaving the  room.  For a minute or two Kent heard him talking to the guard  outside the  door. 
  He sat up then. It was five o'clock. How long ago was it that   Mercer had seen Kedsty? What was the order that the Inspector had   written on a sheet of paper for Constable Pelly? Was it simply  that  he should be more closely watched, or was it a command to  move him to  one of the cells close to the detachment office? If it  was the latter,  all his hopes and plans were destroyed. His mind  flew to those cells. 
  The Landing had no jail, not even a guard-house, though the   members of the force sometimes spoke of the cells just behind   Inspector Kedsty's office by that name. The cells were of cement,  and  Kent himself had helped to plan them! The irony of the thing  did not  strike him just then. He was recalling the fact that no  prisoner had  ever escaped from those cement cells. If no action  were taken before  six o'clock, he was sure that it would be  postponed until the  following morning. It was possible that  Kedsty's order was for Pelly  to prepare a cell for him. Deep in  his soul he prayed fervently that  it was only a matter of  preparation. If they would give him one more  night&#8212;just one! 
  His watch tinkled the half-hour. Then a quarter of six. Then six.   His blood ran feverishly, in spite of the fact that he possessed  the  reputation of being the coolest man in N Division. He lighted  his last  cigar and smoked it slowly to cover the suspense which he  feared  revealed itself in his face, should any one come into his  room. His  supper was due at seven. At eight it would begin to get  dusk. The moon  was rising later each night, and it would not  appear over the forests  until after eleven. He would go through  his window at ten o'clock. His  mind worked swiftly and surely as  to the method of his first night's  flight. There were always a  number of boats down at Crossen's place.  He would start in one of  these, and by the time Mercer discovered he  was gone, he would be  forty miles on his way to freedom. Then he would  set his boat  adrift, or hide it, and start cross-country until his  trail was  lost. Somewhere and in some way he would find both guns and  food.  It was fortunate that he had not given Mercer the other fifty   dollars under his pillow. 
  At seven Mercer came with his supper. A little gleam of   disappointment shot into his pale eyes when he found the last  cigar  gone from the box. Kent saw the expression and tried to grin   good-humoredly. 
  &quot;I'm going to have Father Layonne bring me up another box in the   morning, Mercer,&quot; he said. &quot;That is, if I can get hold of him.&quot; 
  &quot;You probably can,&quot; snapped Mercer. &quot;He doesn't live far from   barracks, and that's where you are going. I've got orders to have  you  ready to move in the morning.&quot; 
  Kent's blood seemed for an instant to flash into living flame. He   drank a part of his cup of coffee and said then, with a shrug of  his  shoulders: &quot;I'm glad of it, Mercer. I'm anxious to have the  thing  over. The sooner they get me down there, the quicker they  will take  action. And I'm not afraid, not a bit of it. I'm bound  to win. There  isn't a chance in a hundred that they can convict  me.&quot; Then he added:  &quot;And I'm going to have a box of cigars sent up  to you, Mercer. I'm  grateful to you for the splendid treatment you  have given me.&quot; 
  No sooner had Mercer gone with the supper things than Kent's   knotted fist shook itself fiercely in the direction of the door. 
  &quot;My God, how I'd like to have you out in the woods&#8212;alone&#8212;for   just one hour!&quot; he whispered. 
  Eight o'clock came, and nine. Two or three times he heard voices   in the hall, probably Mercer talking with the guard. Once he  thought  he heard a rumble of thunder, and his heart throbbed  joyously. Never  had he welcomed a storm as he would have welcomed  it tonight. But the  skies remained clear. Not only that, but the  stars as they began to  appear seemed to him more brilliant than he  had ever seen them before.  And it was very still. The rattle of a  scow-chain came up to him from  the river as though it were only a  hundred yards away. He knew that it  was one of Mooie's dogs he  heard howling over near the sawmill. The  owls, flitting past his  window, seemed to click their beaks more  loudly than last night. A  dozen times he fancied he could hear the  rippling voice of the  river that very soon was to carry him on toward  freedom. 
  The river! Every dream and aspiration found its voice for him in   that river now. Down it Marette Radisson had gone. And somewhere   along it, or on the river beyond, or the third river still beyond   that, he would find her. In the long, tense wait between the hours  of  nine and ten he brought the girl back into his room again. He  recalled  every gesture she had made, every word she had spoken. He  felt the  thrill of her hand on his forehead, her kiss, and in his  brain her  softly spoken words repeated themselves over and over  again, &quot;I think  that if you lived very long I should love you.&quot;  And as she had spoken  those words SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS NOT GOING  TO DIE! 
  Why, then, had she gone away? Knowing that he was going to live,   why had she not remained to help him if she could? Either she had   spoken the words in jest, or&#8212; 
  A new thought flashed into his mind. It almost drew a cry from his   lips. It brought him up tense, erect, his heart pounding. Had she   gone away? Was it not possible that she, too, was playing a game  in  giving the impression that she was leaving down-river on the  hidden  scow? Was it conceivable that she was playing that game  against  Kedsty? A picture, clean-cut as the stars in the sky,  began to outline  itself in his mental vision. It was clear, now,  what Mooie's mumblings  about Kedsty had signified. Kedsty had  accompanied Marette to the  scow. Mooie had seen him and had given  the fact away in his fever.  Afterward he had clamped his mouth  shut through fear of the &quot;big man&quot;  of the Law. But why, still  later, had he almost been done to death?  Mooie was a harmless  creature. He had no enemies. 
  There was no one at the Landing who would have assaulted the old   trailer, whose hair was white with age. No one, unless it was  Kedsty  himself&#8212;Kedsty at bay, Kedsty in a rage. Even that was  inconceivable.  Whatever the motive of the assault might be, and no  matter who had  committed it, Mooie had most certainly seen the  Inspector of Police  accompany Marette Radisson to the scow. And  the question which Kent  found it impossible to answer was, had  Marette Radisson really gone  down the river on that scow? 
  It was almost with a feeling of disappointment that he told   himself it was possible she had not. He wanted her on the river.  He  wanted her going north and still farther north. The thought  that she  was mixed up in some affair that had to do with Kedsty  was displeasing  to him. If she was still in the Landing or near  the Landing, it could  no longer be on account of Sandy McTrigger,  the man his confession had  saved. In his heart he prayed that she  was many days down the  Athabasca, for it was there&#8212;and only  there&#8212;that he would ever see  her again. And his greatest desire,  next to his desire for his  freedom, was to find her. He was frank  with himself in making that  confession. He was more than that. He  knew that not a day or night  would pass that he would not think or  dream of Marette Radisson. The  wonder of her had grown more vivid  for him with each hour that passed,  and he was sorry now that he  had not dared to touch her hair. She  would not have been offended  with him, for she had kissed him&#8212;after  he had killed the impulse  to lay his hand on that soft glory that had  crowned her head. 
  And then the little bell in his watch tinkled the hour of ten! He   sat up with a jerk. For a space he held his breath while he  listened.  In the hall outside his room there was no sound. An inch  at a time he  drew himself off his bed until he stood on his feet.  His clothes hung  on hooks in the wall, and he groped his way to  them so quietly that  one listening at the crack of his door would  not have heard him. He  dressed swiftly. Then he made his way to  the window, looked out, and  listened. 
  In the brilliant starlight he saw nothing but the two white stubs   of the lightning-shattered trees in which the owls lived. And it  was  very still. The air was fresh and sweet in his face. In it he  caught  the scent of the distant balsams and cedars. The world,  wonderful in  its night silence, waited for him. It was impossible  for him to  conceive of failure or death out there, and it seemed  unreal and  trivial that the Law should expect to hold him, with  that world  reaching out its arms to him and calling him. 
  Assured that the moment for action was at hand, he moved quickly.   In another ten seconds he was through the window, and his feet  were  on the ground. For a space he stood out clear in the  starlight. Then  he hurried to the end of the building and hid  himself in the shadow.  The swiftness of his movement had brought  him no physical discomfort,  and his blood danced with the thrill  of the earth under his feet and  the thought that his wound must be  even more completely healed than he  had supposed. A wild  exultation swept over him. He was free! He could  see the river  now, shimmering and talking to him in the starlight,  urging him to  hurry, telling him that only a little while ago another  had gone  north on the breast of it, and that if he hastened it would  help  him to overtake her. He felt the throb of new life in his body.   His eyes shone strangely in the semi-gloom. 
  It seemed to him that only yesterday Marette had gone. She could   not be far away, even now. And in these moments, with the breath  of  freedom stirring him with the glory of new life, she was  different for  him from what she had ever been. She was a part of  him. He could not  think of escape without thinking of her. She  became, in these precious  moments, the living soul of his  wilderness. He felt her presence. The  thought possessed him that  somewhere down the river she was thinking  of him, waiting,  expecting him. And in that same flash he made up his  mind that he  would not discard the boat, as he had planned; he would  conceal  himself by day, and float downstream by night, until at last  he  came to Marette Radisson. And then he would tell her why he had   come. And after that&#8212; 
  He looked toward Crossen's place. He would make straight for it,   openly, like a man bent on a mission there was no reason to  conceal.  If luck went right, and Crossen was abed, he would be on  the river  within fifteen minutes. His blood ran faster as he took  his first step  out into the open starlight. Fifty yards ahead of  him was the building  which Cardigan used for his fuel. Safely  beyond that, no one could see  him from the windows of the  hospital. He walked swiftly. Twenty paces,  thirty, forty&#8212;and he  stopped as suddenly as the half-breed's bullet  had stopped him  weeks before. Round the end of Cardigan's fuel house  came a  figure. It was Mercer. He was twirling his little cane and   traveling quietly as a cat. They were not ten feet apart, yet Kent   had not heard him. 
  Mercer stopped. The cane dropped from his hand. Even in the   starlight Kent could see his face turn white. 
  &quot;Don't make a sound, Mercer,&quot; he warned. &quot;I'm taking a little   exercise in the open air. If you cry out, I'll kill you!&quot; 
  He advanced slowly, speaking in a voice that could not have been   heard at the windows behind him. And then a thing happened that  froze  the blood in his veins. He had heard the scream of every  beast of the  great forests, but never a scream like that which  came from Mercer's  lips now. It was not the cry of a man. To Kent  it was the voice of a  fiend, a devil. It did not call for help. It  was wordless. And as the  horrible sound issued from Mercer's mouth  he could see the swelling  throat and bulging eyes that accompanied  the effort. They made him  think of a snake, a cobra. 
  The chill went out of his blood, replaced by a flame of hottest   fire. He forgot everything but that this serpent was in his path.   Twice he had stood in his way. And he hated him. He hated him with  a  virulency that was death. Neither the call of freedom nor the  threat  of prison could keep him from wreaking vengeance now.  Without a sound  he was at Mercer's throat, and the scream ended in  a choking shriek.  His fingers dug into flabby flesh, and his  clenched fist beat again  and again into Mercer's face. 
  He went to the ground, crushing the human serpent under him. And   he continued to strike and choke as he had never struck or choked   another man, all other things overwhelmed by his mad desire to  tear  into pieces this two-legged English vermin who was too foul  to exist  on the face of the earth. 
  And he still continued to strike&#8212;even after the path lay clear   once more between him and the river.
