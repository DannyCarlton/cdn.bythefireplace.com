  From that hour was born in Roderick Drew's breast a strange,  imperishable desire. Willingly at this moment would he have given up  the winter trapping to have pursued that golden<I> ignis fatuus</I> of  all ages&#8212;the lure of gold. To him the story of the old cabin, the  skeletons and the treasure of the buckskin bag was complete. Those  skeletons had once been men. They had found a mine&#8212;a place where they  had picked up nuggets with their fingers. And that treasure ground was  somewhere near. No longer was he puzzled by the fact that they had  discovered no more gold in the old log cabin. In a flash he had solved  that mystery. The men had just begun to gather their treasure when they  had fought. What was more logical than that? One day, two, three&#8212;and  they had quarreled over division, over rights. That was the time when  they were most likely to quarrel. Perhaps one had discovered the gold  and had therefore claimed a larger share. Anyway, the contents of the  buckskin bag represented but a few days' labor. Rod was sure of that.
  Mukoki had grinned and shrugged his shoulders with an air of  stupendous doubt when Rod had told him that the gold lay between the  mountains, so now the youth kept his thoughts to himself. It was a  silent trail home. Rod's mind was too active in its new channel, and he  was too deeply absorbed in impressing upon his memory certain landmarks  which they passed to ask questions; and Mukoki, with the natural  taciturnity of his race, seldom found occasion to break into  conversation unless spoken to first. Although his eyes were constantly  on the alert, Rod could see no way in which a descent could be made  into the chasm from the ridge they were on. This was a little  disappointing, for he had made up his mind to explore the gloomy,  sunless gulch at his first opportunity. He had no doubt that Wabi would  join in the adventure. Or he might take his own time, and explore it  alone. He was reasonably sure that from somewhere on the opposite ridge  a descent could be made into it.
  Wabi was in camp when they arrived. He had set eighteen traps and  had shot two spruce partridges. The birds were already cleaned for  their early supper, and a thick slice of venison steak was added to the  menu. During the preparation of the meal Rod described their discovery  of the chasm and revealed some of his thoughts concerning it, but Wabi  betrayed only passing flashes of interest. At times he seemed strangely  preoccupied and would stand in an idle, contemplative mood, his hands  buried deep in his pockets, while Rod or Mukoki proceeded with the  little duties about the table or the stove. Finally, after arousing  himself from one of these momentary spells, he pulled a brass shell  from his pocket and held it out to the old Indian.
  &#8220;See here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don't want to stir up any false fears, or  anything of that sort&#8212;but I found that on the trail to-day!&#8221;
  Mukoki clutched at the shell as though it had been another newly  found nugget of gold. The shell was empty. The lettering on the rim was  still very distinct. He read &#8221;.35 Rem.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, that's&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;A shell from Rod's gun!&#8221;
  For a few moments Rod and Mukoki stared at the young Indian in blank  amazement.
  &#8220;It's a .35 caliber Remington,&#8221; continued Wabi, &#8220;and it's an  auto-loading shell. There are only three guns like that in this  country. I've got one, Mukoki has another&#8212;and you lost the third in  your fight with the Woongas!&#8221;
  The venison had begun to burn, and Mukoki quickly transferred it to  the table. Without a word the three sat down to their meal.
  &#8220;That means the Woongas are on our trail,&#8221; declared Rod presently.
  &#8220;That is what I have been trying to reason out all the afternoon,&#8221;  replied Wabi. &#8220;It certainly is proof that they are, or have been quite  recently, on this side of the mountain. But I don't believe they know  we are here. The trail I struck was about five miles from camp. It was  at least two days old. Three Indians on snow-shoes were traveling  north. I followed back on their trail and found after a time that the  Indians had come from the north, which leads me to believe that they  were simply on a hunting expedition, cut a circle southward, and then  returned to their camp. I don't believe they will come farther south.  But we must keep our eyes open.&#8221;
  Wabi's description of the manner in which the strange trail turned  gave great satisfaction to Mukoki, who nodded affirmatively when the  young hunter expressed it as his belief that the Woongas would not come  so far as their camp. But the discovery of their presence chilled the  buoyant spirits of the hunters. There was, however, a new spice of  adventure lurking in this possible peril that was not altogether  displeasing, and by the time the meal was at an end something like a  plan of campaign had been formed. The hunters would not wait to be  attacked and then act in self-defense, possibly at a disadvantage. They  would be constantly on the lookout for the Woongas, and if a fresh  trail or a camp was found they would begin the man-hunt themselves.
  The sun was just beginning to sink behind the distant hills in the  southwest when the hunters again left camp. Wolf had received nothing  to eat since the previous night, and with increasing hunger the fiery  impatience lurking in his eyes and the restlessness of his movements  became more noticeable. Mukoki called attention to these symptoms with  a gloating satisfaction.
  The gloom of early evening was enveloping the wilderness by the time  the three wolf hunters reached the swamp in which Rod had slain the  buck. While he carried the guns and packs, Mukoki and Wabigoon dragged  the buck between them to the huge flat-top rock. Now for the first time  the city youth began to understand the old pathfinder's scheme. Several  saplings were cut, and by means of a long rope of babeesh the deer was  dragged up the side of the rock until it rested securely upon the flat  space. From the dead buck's neck the babeesh rope was now stretched  across the intervening space between the rock and the clump of cedars  in which the hunters were to conceal themselves. In two of these  cedars, at a distance of a dozen feet from the ground, were quickly  made three platforms of saplings, upon which the ambushed watchers  could comfortably seat themselves. By the time complete darkness had  fallen the &#8220;trap&#8221; was finished, with the exception of a detail which  Rod followed with great interest.
  From inside his clothes, where it had been kept warm by his body,  Mukoki produced the flask of blood. A third of this blood he scattered  upon the face of the rock and upon the snow at its base. The remainder  he distributed, drop by drop, in trails running toward the swamp and  plains.
  There still remained three hours before the moon would be up, and  the hunters now joined Wolf, who had been fastened half-way up the  ridge. In the shelter of a big rock a small fire was built, and during  their long wait the hunters passed the time away by broiling and eating  chunks of venison and in going over again the events of the day.
  It was nine o'clock before the moon rose above the edge of the  wilderness. This great orb of the Northern night seemed to hold a  never-ending fascination for Rod. It crept above the forests, a  glowing, throbbing ball of red, quivering and palpitating in an  effulgence that neither cloud nor mist dimmed in this desolation beyond  the sphere of man; and as it rose, almost with visible movement to the  eyes, the blood in it faded, until at last it seemed a great blaze of  soft light between silver and gold. It was then that the whole world  was lighted up under it. It was then that Mukoki, speaking softly,  beckoned the others to follow him, and with Wolf at his side went down  the ridge.
  Making a circuit around the back of the rock, Mukoki paused near a  small sapling twenty yards from the dead buck and secured Wolf by his  babeesh thong. Hardly had he done so when the animal began to exhibit  signs of excitement. He trotted about nervously, sniffing the air,  gathering the wind from every direction, and his jaws dropped with a  snarling whine. Then he struck one of the clots of blood in the snow.
  &#8220;Come,&#8221; whispered Wabi, pulling at Rod's sleeve, &#8220;come&#8212;quietly.&#8221;
  They slipped back among the shadows of the spruce and watched Wolf  in unbroken silence. The animal now stood rigidly over the blood clot.  His head was level with his quivering back, his ears half aslant, his  nostrils pointing to a strange thrilling scent that came to him from  somewhere out there in the moonlight. Once more the instinct of his  breed was flooding the soul of the captive wolf. There was the odor of  blood in his widening nostrils. It was not the blood of the camp, of  the slaughtered game dragged in by human hands before his eyes. It was  the blood of the chase!
  A flashing memory of his captors turned the animal's head for an  instant in backward inspection. They were gone. He could neither hear  nor see them. He sniffed the sign of human presence, but that sign was  always with him, and was not disturbing. The blood held him&#8212;and the  strange scent, the game scent&#8212;that was coming to him more clearly  every instant.
  He crunched about cautiously in the snow. He found other spots of  blood, and to the watchers there came a low long whine that seemed  about to end in the wolf song. The blood trails were leading him away  toward the game scent, and he tugged viciously at the babeesh that held  him captive, gnawing at it vainly, like an angry dog, forgetting what  experience had taught him many times before. Each moment added to his  excitement He ran about the sapling, gulped mouthfuls of the bloody  snow, and each time he paused for a moment with his open dripping jaws  held toward the dead buck on the rock. The game was very near. Brute  sense told him that. Oh, the longing that was in him, the twitching,  quivering longing to kill&#8212;kill&#8212;kill!
  He made another effort, tore up the snow in his frantic endeavors to  free himself, to break loose, to follow in the wild glad cry of freed  savagery in the calling of his people. He failed again, panting,  whining in piteous helplessness.
  Then he settled upon his haunches at the end of his babeesh thong.
  For a moment his head turned to the moonlit sky, his long nose  poised at right angles to the bristling hollows between his shoulders.
  There came then a low, whining wail, like the beginning of the  &#8220;death-song&#8221; of a husky dog&#8212;a wail that grew in length and in strength  and in volume until it rose weirdly among the mountains and swept far  out over the plains&#8212;the hunt call of the wolf on the trail, which  calls to him the famished, gray-gaunt outlaws of the wilderness, as the  bugler's notes call his fellows on the field of battle.
  Three times that blood-thrilling cry went up from the captive wolf's  throat, and before those cries had died away the three hunters were  perched upon their platforms among the spruce.
  There followed now the ominous, waiting silence of an awakened  wilderness. Rod could hear his heart throbbing within him. He forgot  the intense cold. His nerves tingled. He looked out over the endless  plains, white and mysteriously beautiful as they lay bathed in the glow  of the moon. And Wabi knew more than he what was happening. All over  that wild desolation the call of the wolf had carried its meaning. Down  there, where a lake lay silent in its winter sleep, a doe started in  trembling and fear; beyond the mountain a huge bull moose lifted his  antlered head with battle-glaring eyes; half a mile away a fox paused  for an instant in its sleuth-like stalking of a rabbit; and here and  there in that world of wild things the gaunt hungry people of Wolf's  blood stopped in their trails and turned their heads toward the signal  that was coming in wailing echoes to their ears.
  And then the silence was broken. From afar&#8212;it might have been a  mile away&#8212;there came an answering cry; and at that cry the wolf at the  end of his babeesh thong settled upon his haunches again and sent back  the call that comes only when there is blood upon the trail or when  near the killing time.
  There was not the rustle of a bough, not a word spoken, by the  silent watchers in the spruce. Mukoki had slipped back and half lay  across his support in shooting attitude. Wabi had braced a foot, and  his rifle was half to his shoulder, leveled over a knee. It was Rod's  turn with the big revolver, and he had practised aiming through a  crotch that gave a rest to his arm.
  In a few moments there came again the howl of the distant wolf on  the plains, and this time it was joined by another away to the  westward. And after that there came two from the plains instead of one,  and then a far cry to the north and east. For the first time Rod and  Wabi heard the gloating chuckle of Mukoki in his spruce a dozen feet  away.
  At the increasing responses of his brethren Wolf became more frantic  in his efforts. The scent of fresh blood and of wounded game was  becoming maddening to the captive. But his frenzy no longer betrayed  itself in futile efforts to escape from the babeesh thong. Wolf knew  that his cries were assembling the hunt-pack. Nearer and nearer came  the responses of the leaders, and there were now only momentary rests  between the deep-throated exhortations which he sent in all directions  into the night.
  Suddenly, almost from the swamp itself, there came a quick, excited,  yelping reply, and Wabi gripped Rod by the arm.
  &#8220;He has struck the place where you killed the buck,&#8221; he whispered.  &#8220;There'll be quick work now!&#8221;
  Hardly had he spoken when a series of excited howls broke forth from  the swamp, coming nearer and nearer as the hunger-crazed outlaw of the  plains followed over the rich-scented trail made by the two Indians as  they carried the slaughtered deer. Soon he nosed one of the trails of  blood, and a moment later the watchers saw a gaunt shadow form running  swiftly over the snow toward Wolf.
  For an instant, as the two beasts of prey met, there fell a silence;  then both animals joined in the wailing hunt-pack cry, and the wolf  that was free came to the edge of the great rock and stood with his  fore feet on its side, and his cry changed from that of the chase to  the still more thrilling signal that told the gathering pack of game at  bay.
  Swiftly the wolves closed in. From over the edge of the mountain one  came and joined the wolf at the rock without the hunters seeing his  approach. From out of the swamp there came a pack of three, and now  about the rock there grew a maddened, yelping horde, clambering and  scrambling and fighting in their efforts to climb up to the game that  was so near and yet beyond their reach. And sixty feet away Wolf  crouched, watching the gathering of his clan, helpless, panting from  his choking efforts to free himself, and quieting, gradually quieting,  until in sullen silence he looked upon the scene, as though he knew the  moment was very near when that thrilling spectacle would be changed  into a scene of direst tragedy.
  And it was Mukoki who had first said that this was the vengeance of  Wolf upon his people.
  From Mukoki there now came a faint hissing warning, and Wabi threw  his rifle to his shoulder. There were at least a score of wolves at the  base of the rock. Gradually the old Indian pulled upon the babeesh rope  that led to the dead buck&#8212;pulled until he was putting a half of his  strength into the effort, and could feel the animal slowly slipping  from the flat ledge. A moment more and the buck tumbled down in the  midst of the waiting pack.
  As flies gather upon a lump of sugar the famished animals now  crowded and crushed and fought over the deer's body, and as they came  thus together there sounded the quick sharp signal to fire from Mukoki.
  For five seconds the edge of the spruce was a blaze of death-dealing  flashes, and the deafening reports of the two rifles and the big Colt  drowned the cries and struggles of the animals. When those five seconds  were over fifteen shots had been fired, and five seconds later the  vast, beautiful silence of the wilderness night had fallen again. About  the rock was the silence of death, broken only faintly by the last  gasping throes of the animals that lay dying in the snow.
  In the trees there sounded the metallic clink of loading shells.
  Wabi spoke first.
  &#8220;I believe we did a good job, Mukoki!&#8221;
  Mukoki's reply was to slip down his tree. The others followed, and  hastened across to the rock. Five bodies lay motionless in the snow. A  sixth was dragging himself around the side of the rock, and Mukoki  attacked it with his belt-ax. Still a seventh had run for a dozen rods,  leaving a crimson trail behind, and when Wabi and Rod came up to it the  animal was convulsed in its last dying struggles.
  &#8220;Seven!&#8221; exclaimed the Indian youth. &#8220;That is one of the best shoots  we ever had. A hundred and five dollars in a night isn't bad, is it?&#8221;
  The two came back to the rock, dragging the wolf with them. Mukoki  was standing as rigid as a statue in the moonlight, his face turned  into the north. He pointed one arm far out over the plains, and said,  without turning his head,
  &#8220;See!&#8221;
  Far out in that silent desolation the hunters saw a lurid flash of  flame. It climbed up and up, until it filled the night above it with a  dull glow&#8212;a single unbroken stream of fire that rose far above the  swamps and forests of the plains.
  &#8220;That's a burning jackpine!&#8221; said Wabigoon.
  &#8220;Burning jackpine!&#8221; agreed the old warrior. Then he added, &#8220;Woonga  signal fire!&#8221;
