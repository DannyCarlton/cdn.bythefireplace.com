  For a matter of twenty seconds&#8212;even longer it seemed to Carrigan   &#8212;the life of these two was expressed in a vivid and unforgettable   tableau. One half of it David saw&#8212;the blue sky, the dazzling sun,   the girl in between. The pistol dropped from his limp hand, and  the  weight of his body tottered on the crook of his under-elbow.  Mentally  and physically he was on the point of collapse, and yet  in those few  moments every detail of the picture was painted with  a brush of fire  in his brain. The girl was bareheaded. Her face  was as white as any  face he had ever seen, living or dead; her  eyes were like pools that  had caught the reflection of fire; he  saw the sheen of her hair, the  poise of her slender body&#8212;its  shock, stupefaction, horror. He sensed  these things even as his  brain wobbled dizzily, and the larger part of  the picture began to  fade out of his vision. But her face remained to  the last. It grew  clearer, like a cameo framed in an iris&#8212;a  beautiful, staring,  horrified face with shimmering tresses of  jet-black hair blowing  about it like a veil. He noticed the hair, that  was partly undone  as if she had been in a struggle of some sort, or  had been running  fast against the breeze that came up the river. 
  He fought with himself to hold that picture of her, to utter some   word, make some movement. But the power to see and to live died  out  of him. He sank back with a queer sound in his throat. He did  not hear  the answering cry from the girl as she flung herself,  with a quick  little prayer for help, on her knees in the soft,  white sand beside  him. He felt no movement when she raised his  head in her arm and with  her bare hand brushed back his sand-  littered hair, revealing where  the bullet had struck him. He did  not know when she ran back to the  river. 
  His first sensation was of a cool and comforting something   trickling over his burning temples and his face. It was water.   Subconsciously he knew that, and in the same way he began to  think.  But it was hard to pull his thoughts together. They  persisted in  hopping about, like a lot of sand-fleas in a dance,  and just as he got  hold of one and reached for another, the first  would slip away from  him. He began to get the best of them after a  time, and he had an  uncontrollable desire to say something. But  his eyes and his lips were  sealed tight, and to open them, a  little army of gnomes came out of  the darkness in the back of his  head, each of them armed with a lever,  and began prying with all  their might. After that came the beginning  of light and a flash of  consciousness. 
  The girl was working over him. He could feel her and hear her   movement. Water was trickling over his face. Then he heard a  voice,  close over him, saying something in a sobbing monotone  which he could  not understand. 
  With a mighty effort he opened his eyes. 
  &quot;Thank LE BON DIEU, you live, m'sieu,&quot; he heard the voice say, as   if coming from a long distance away. &quot;You live, you live&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Tryin' to,&quot; he mumbled thickly, feeling suddenly a sense of great   elation. &quot;Tryin'&#8212;&quot; 
  He wanted to curse the gnomes for deserting him, for as soon as   they were gone with their levers, his eyes and his lips shut tight   again, or at least he thought they did. But he began to sense  things  in a curious sort of way. Some one was dragging him. He  could feel the  grind of sand under his body. There were intervals  when the dragging  operation paused. And then, after a long time,  he seemed to hear more  than one voice. There were two&#8212;sometimes a  murmur of them. And odd  visions came to him. He seemed to see the  girl with shining black hair  and dark eyes, and then swiftly she  would change into a girl with hair  like blazing gold. This was a  different girl. She was not like Pretty  Eyes, as his twisted mind  called the other. This second vision that he  saw was like a  radiant bit of the sun, her hair all aflame with the  fire of it  and her face a different sort of face. He was always glad  when she  went away and Pretty Eyes came back. 
  To David Carrigan this interesting experience in his life might   have covered an hour, a day, or a month. Or a year for that  matter,  for he seemed to have had an indefinite association with  Pretty Eyes.  He had known her for a long time and very intimately,  it seemed. Yet  he had no memory of the long fight in the hot sun,  or of the river, or  of the singing warblers, or of the inquisitive  sandpiper that had  marked out the line which his enemy's last  bullet had traveled. He had  entered into a new world in which  everything was vague and unreal  except that vision of dark hair,  dark eyes, and pale, beautiful face.  Several times he saw it with  marvelous clearness, and each time he  drifted away into darkness  again with the sound of a voice growing  fainter and fainter in his  ears. 
  Then came a time of utter chaos and soundless gloom. He was in a   pit, where even his subconscious self was almost dead under a   crushing oppression. At last a star began to glimmer in this pit,  a  star pale and indistinct and a vast distance away. But it crept   steadily up through the eternity of darkness, and the nearer it  came,  the less there was of the blackness of night. From a star it  grew into  a sun, and with the sun came dawn. In that dawn he heard  the singing  of a bird, and the bird was just over his head. When  Carrigan opened  his eyes, and understanding came to him, he found  himself under the  silver birch that belonged to the wood warbler. 
  For a space he did not ask himself how he had come there. He was   looking at the river and the white strip of sand. Out there were  the  rock and his dunnage pack. Also his rifle. Instinctively his  eyes  turned to the balsam ambush farther down. That, too, was in a  blaze of  sunlight now. But where he lay, or sat, or stood&#8212;he was  not sure what  he was doing at that moment&#8212;it was shady and  deliciously cool. The  green of the cedar and spruce and balsam was  close about him, inset  with the silver and gold of the thickly-  leaved birch. He discovered  that he was bolstered up partly  against the trunk of this birch and  partly against a spruce  sapling. Between these two, where his head  rested, was a pile of  soft moss freshly torn from the earth. And  within reach of him was  his own kit pail filled with water. 
  He moved himself cautiously and raised a hand to his head. His   fingers came in contact with a bandage. 
  For a minute or two after that he sat without moving while his   amazed senses seized upon the significance of it all. In the first   place he was alive. But even this fact of living was less  remarkable  than the other things that had happened. He remembered  the final  moments of the unequal duel. His enemy had got him. And  that enemy was  a woman! Moreover, after she had blown away a part  of his head and had  him helpless in the sand, she had&#8212;in place of  finishing him  there&#8212;dragged him to this cool nook and tied up his  wound. It was  hard for him to believe, but the pail of water, the  moss behind his  shoulders, the bandage, and certain visions that  were reforming  themselves in his brain convinced him. A woman had  shot him. She had  worked like the very devil to kill him. And  afterward she had saved  him! He grinned. It was final proof that  his mind hadn't been playing  tricks on him. No one but a woman  would have been quite so  unreasonable. A man would have completed  the job. 
  He began to look for her up and down the white strip of sand. And   in looking he saw the gray and silver flash of the hard-working   sandpiper. He chuckled, for he was exceedingly comfortable, and  also  exhilaratingly happy to know that the thing was over and he  was not  dead. If the sandpiper had been a man, he would have  called him up to  shake hands with him. For if it hadn't been for  the bird getting  squarely in front of him and giving him away,  there might have been a  more horrible end to it all. He shuddered  as he thought of the mighty  effort he had made to fire a shot into  the heart of the balsam  ambush&#8212;and perhaps into the heart of a  woman! 
  He reached for the pail and drank deeply of the water in it. He   felt no pain. His dizziness was gone. His mind had grown suddenly   clear and alert. The warmth of the water told him almost instantly   that it had been taken from the river some time ago. He observed  the  change in sun and shadows. With the instinct of a man trained  to note  details, he pulled out his watch. It was almost six  o'clock. More than  three hours had passed since the sandpiper had  got in front of his  gun. He did not attempt to rise to his feet,  but scanned with slower  and more careful scrutiny the edge of the  forest and the river. He had  been mystified while cringing for his  life behind the rock, but he was  infinitely more so now. Greater  desire he had never had than this  which thrilled him in these  present minutes of his  readjustment&#8212;desire to look upon the woman  again. And then, all at  once, there came back to him a mental  flash of the other. He  remembered, as if something was coming back  to him out of a dream, how  the whimsical twistings of his sick  brain had made him see two faces  instead of one. Yet he knew that  the first picture of his mysterious  assailant, the picture painted  in his brain when he had tried to raise  his pistol, was the right  one. He had seen her dark eyes aglow; he had  seen the sunlit sheen  of her black hair rippling in the wind; he had  seen the white  pallor in her face, the slimness of her as she stood  over him in  horror&#8212;he remembered even the clutch of her white hand at  her  throat. A moment before she had tried to kill him. And then he had   looked up and had seen her like that! It must have been some   unaccountable trick in his brain that had flooded her hair with   golden fire at times. 
  His eyes followed a furrow in the white sand which led from where   he sat bolstered against the tree down to his pack and the rock.  It  was the trail made by his body when she had dragged him up to  the  shelter and coolness of the timber. One of his laws of  physical care  was to keep himself trained down to a hundred and  sixty, but he  wondered how she had dragged up even so much as that  of dead weight.  It had taken a great deal of effort. He could see  distinctly three  different places in the sand where she had  stopped to rest. 
  Carrigan had earned a reputation as the expert analyst of &quot;N&quot;   Division. In delicate matters it was seldom that McVane did not  take  him into consultation. He possessed an almost uncanny grip on  the  working processes of a criminal mind, and the first rule he  had set  down for himself was to regard the acts of omission rather  than the  one outstanding act of commission. But when he proved to  himself that  the chief actor in a drama possessed a normal rather  than a criminal  mind, he found himself in the position of  checkmate. It was a  thrilling game. And he was frankly puzzled  now, until&#8212;one after  another&#8212;he added up the sum total of what  had been omitted in this  instance of his own personal adventure.  Hidden in her ambush, the  woman who had shot him had been in both  purpose and act an assassin.  Her determination had been to kill  him. She had disregarded the white  flag with which he had pleaded  for mercy. Her marksmanship was of  fiendish cleverness. Up to her  last shot she had been, to all intent  and purpose, a murderess. 
  The change had come when she looked down upon him, bleeding and   helpless, in the sand. Undoubtedly she had thought he was dying.  But  why, when she saw his eyes open a little later, had she cried  out her  gratitude to God? What had worked the sudden  transformation in her?  Why had she labored to save the life she  had so atrociously coveted a  minute before? 
  If his assailant had been a man, Carrigan would have found an   answer. For he was not robbed, and therefore robbery was not a  motif.  &quot;A case of mistaken identity,&quot; he would have told himself.  &quot;An error  in visual judgment.&quot; 
  But the fact that in his analysis he was dealing with a woman made   his answer only partly satisfying. He could not disassociate  himself  from her eyes&#8212;their beauty, their horror, the way they  had looked at  him. It was as if a sudden revulsion had come over  her; as if, looking  down upon her bleeding handiwork, the woman's  soul in her had  revolted, and with that revulsion had come  repentance&#8212;repentance and  pity. 
  &quot;That,&quot; thought Carrigan, &quot;would be just like a woman&#8212;and   especially a woman with eyes like hers.&quot; 
  This left him but two conclusions to choose from. Either there had   been a mistake, and the woman had shown both horror and desire to   amend when she discovered it, or a too tender-hearted agent of  Black  Roger Audemard had waylaid him in the heart of the white  strip of  sand. 
  The sun was another hour lower in the sky when Carrigan assured   himself in a series of cautious experiments that he was not in a   condition to stand upon his feet. In his pack were a number of  things  he wanted&#8212;his blankets, for instance, a steel mirror, and  the  thermometer in his medical kit. He was beginning to feel a bit  anxious  about himself. There were sharp pains back of his eyes.  His face was  hot, and he was developing an unhealthy appetite for  water. It was  fever and he knew what fever meant in this sort of  thing, when one was  alone. He had given up hope of the woman's  return. It was not  reasonable to expect her to come back after her  furious attempt to  kill him. She had bandaged him, bolstered him  up, placed water beside  him, and had then left him to work out the  rest of his salvation  alone. But why the deuce hadn't she brought  up his pack? 
  On his hands and knees he began to work himself toward it slowly.   He found that the movement caused him pain, and that with this  pain,  if he persisted in movement, there was a synchronous rise of  nausea.  The two seemed to work in a sort of unity. But his  medicine case was  important now, and his blankets, and his rifle  if he hoped to signal  help that might chance to pass on the river.  A foot at a time, a yard  at a time, he made his way down into the  sand. His fingers dug into  the footprints of the mysterious gun-  woman. He approved of their  size. They were small and narrow,  scarcely longer than the palm and  fingers of his hand&#8212;and they  were made by shoes instead of moccasins. 
  It seemed an interminable time to him before he reached his pack.   When he got there, a pendulum seemed swinging back and forth  inside  his head, beating against his skull. He lay down with his  pack for a  pillow, intending to rest for a spell. But the minutes  added  themselves one on top of another. The sun slipped behind  clouds  banking in the west. It grew cooler, while within him he  was consumed  by a burning thirst. He could hear the ripple of  running water, the  laughter of it among pebbles a few yards away.  And the river itself  became even more desirable than his medicine  case, or his blankets, or  his rifle. The song of it, inviting and  tempting him, blotted thought  of the other things out of his mind.  And he continued his journey, the  swing of the pendulum in his  head becoming harder, but the sound of  the river growing nearer.  At last he came to the wet sand, and fell on  his face, and drank. 
  After this he had no great desire to go back. He rolled himself   over, so that his face was turned up to the sky. Under him the wet   sand was soft, and it was comfortingly cool. The fire in his head   died out. He could hear new sounds in the edge of the forest  evening  sounds. Only weak little twitters came from the wood  warblers, driven  to silence by thickening gloom in the densely  canopied balsams and  cedars, and frightened by the first low hoots  of the owls. There was a  crash not far distant, probably a  porcupine waddling through brush on  his way for a drink; or  perhaps it was a thirsty deer, or a bear  coming out in the hope of  finding a dead fish. Carrigan loved that  sort of sound, even when  a pendulum was beating back and forth in his  head. It was like  medicine to him, and he lay with wide-open eyes, his  ears picking  up one after another the voices that marked the change  from day to  night. He heard the cry of a loon, its softer, chuckling  note of  honeymoon days. From across the river came a cry that was half   howl, half bark. Carrigan knew that it was coyote, and not wolf, a   coyote whose breed had wandered hundreds of miles north of the   prairie country. 
  The gloom gathered in, and yet it was not darkness as the darkness   of night is known a thousand miles south. It was the dusky  twilight  of day where the sun rises at three o'clock in the  morning and still  throws its ruddy light in the western sky at  nine o'clock at night;  where the poplar buds unfold themselves  into leaf before one's very  eyes; where strawberries are green in  the morning and red in the  afternoon; where, a little later, one  could read newspaper print until  midnight by the glow of the sun&#8212;  and between the rising and the  setting of that sun there would be  from eighteen to twenty hours of  day. It was evening time in the  wonderland of the north, a wonderland  hard and frozen and ridden  by pain and death in winter, but a paradise  upon earth in this  month of June. 
  The beauty of it filled Carrigan's soul, even as he lay on his   back in the damp sand. Far south of him steam and steel were  coming,  and the world would soon know that it was easy to grow  wheat at the  Arctic Circle, that cucumbers grew to half the size  of a man's arm,  that flowers smothered the land and berries turned  it scarlet and  black. He had dreaded these days&#8212;days of what he  called &quot;the great  discovery&quot;&#8212;the time when a crowded civilization  would at last  understand how the fruits of the earth leaped up to  the call of twenty  hours of sun each day, even though that earth  itself was eternally  frozen if one went down under its surface  four feet with a pick and  shovel. 
  Tonight the gloom came earlier because of the clouds in the west.   It was very still. Even the breeze had ceased to come from up the   river. And as Carrigan listened, exulting in the thought that the   coolness of the wet sand was drawing the fever from him, he heard   another sound. At first he thought it was the splashing of a fish.   But after that it came again, and still again, and he knew that  it  was the steady and rhythmic dip of paddles. 
  A thrill shot through him, and he raised himself to his elbow.   Dusk covered the river, and he could not see. But he heard low  voices  as the paddles dipped. And after a little he knew that one  of these  was the voice of a woman. 
  His heart gave a big jump. &quot;She is coming back,&quot; he whispered to   himself. &quot;She is coming back!&quot;
