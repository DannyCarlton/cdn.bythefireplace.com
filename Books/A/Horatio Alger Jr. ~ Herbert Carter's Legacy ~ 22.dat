  The little boat touched its moorings. 
  &#8220;Mr. Cameron,&#8221; said Herbert, &#8220;allow me to introduce to you the  owner  of the boat, Mr. James Leech.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mr. Leech,&#8221; said Cameron, &#8220;I have to apologize for taking your  boat  without leave. I hope I haven't kept you waiting for it.&#8221; 
  If the young collegian had not been the son of a wealthy man, whose   social position was higher than his own, James would not so readily   have accepted the apology. As it was, he said, graciously: &#8220;Oh it's no   matter. I'm glad you took the boat. How beautifully you row!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you for the compliment. Last year I belonged to the  Sophomore  crew at Yale.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish I could row as well as you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is a matter of practice. If I can give you any hints I shall be   glad to do so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said James, eagerly. &#8220;Would you have time this   afternoon?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I have an hour to spare. If you and my friend Herbert will  get  into the boat and row out a little way, I shall get an idea of  your  style of rowing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I would rather row out alone,&#8221; said James, haughtily, with a   disparaging look at Herbert. 
  &#8220;Unfortunately that won't do as well. You must learn to row with  one  oar first.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then suppose you get into the boat with me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That won't do as well. I am much heavier than you. Now you and   Herbert are about the same weight.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said James, and turning to Herbert, he said,   ungraciously: &#8220;Will you row with me?&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you desire it,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Get in, then.&#8221; 
  When they returned Cameron made some criticisms Upon their rowing.   They started out again but Herbert profited better by the instructions   he had received and the young collegian said so when they returned. 
  James was far from liking this and when Cameron asked him if he  would  try another row he answered: &#8220;No, I am tired of it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you get tired so soon, I am afraid you will have to strengthen   your arms by gymnastic exercises.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, I am not tired. I don't feel like rowing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then suppose we walk back to the village. Does your way lie with   ours?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nearly all the way,&#8221; said James. 
  He enjoyed the idea of walking with the collegian, but it was  rather a  drawback that Herbert was to share that pleasure with him.  Still he  could not very well suggest that Herbert should leave them. 
  &#8220;Have you seen my father's house?&#8221; asked James. 
  &#8220;Perhaps, without knowing whose it was.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You couldn't help knowing it. It is the best in the village,&#8221; said   James, pompously. 
  Cameron looked at him curiously. 
  &#8220;If he comes to Yale,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and puts on these airs, he'll  be  taken down without ceremony.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; he said aloud, dryly. 
  &#8220;Are you going to stay here long?&#8221; asked James. 
  &#8220;I can't say how long. I am here for my health.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You must come and see us. My father will be very glad to see you.  My  aunt has written us about you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Indeed! May I ask your aunt's name?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Her name is Davenport&#8212;Mrs. John Davenport. She lives in New  Haven.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, yes, I have met her.&#8221; 
  Cameron smiled to himself. The lady referred to was not unlike her   brother and nephew, being pompous and presuming&#8212;one, indeed, whom he   secretly disliked. 
  &#8220;She wants me to prepare for Yale,&#8221; said James. 
  &#8220;Of course we Yale men are biased, but we think no student can do   better than to come to Yale.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My father wants me to be a professional man&#8212;a lawyer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A good profession. Do you think you should like it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said James, complacently. &#8220;It's a very genteel profession.   Besides, most of our public men are lawyers. I might stand a chance to   get into public life.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Should you like it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I should like to be a member of Congress. My father has a  good  deal of influence and I am his only son, so I should have a very  good  chance; don't you think so?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It would seem so,&#8221; said Cameron, with a quiet smile. &#8220;I think you  had  better come to Yale. You would be improved in many ways.&#8221; 
  He referred to the possibility of James having some of the self-   conceit taken out of him; but then the squire's son interpreted the   remark as a compliment. &#8220;Have you ever thought of going to college,   Herbert?&#8221; asked Cameron, turning to our hero. 
  &#8220;I always thought I should like to go,&#8221; answered Herbert, &#8220;but I  never  thought there was any chance of it.&#8221; 
  James laughed scornfully. 
  &#8220;No, I should think not,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Cameron, meaning to draw him out. 
  &#8220;He's too poor,&#8221; said James. 
  &#8220;You, I suppose, have no trouble in that way?&#8221; 
  &#8220;My father is the richest man in Wrayburn.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is lucky for you,&#8221; said the collegian. 
  &#8220;I shouldn't like to be as poor as Carter.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It isn't pleasant or convenient to be poor,&#8221; said Herbert,  quietly.  &#8220;I don't mean always to be poor.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You probably will be,&#8221; said James. &#8220;Poor boys don't always stay   poor.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There isn't much chance for you to rise.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know why,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Then it seems, Herbert,&#8221; said Cameron, smiling, &#8220;there is not much   chance of my welcoming you at Yale.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish there was.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So you will have to be content with serving as my professor here.&#8221; 
  James did not understand this allusion, but privately wondered how   Cameron could talk so intimately with a boy in Herbert's low social   position. 
  &#8220;I turn off here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is our house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Is it?&#8221; said Cameron, indifferently. 
  &#8220;Your friend seems to have a very vain idea of his high position,&#8221;   said Cameron, when James was out of hearing. 
  &#8220;And a very low idea of mine,&#8221; added Herbert. 
  &#8220;Does that disturb you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;A little. He carries it so far as to be annoying.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Circumstances may change with you both.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope they may with me,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I don't want James to  come  down in the world, but I hope to rise.&#8221; 
  The next day Cameron was honored by a special call from Squire  Leech,  who left an invitation for the young collegian to take tea with  him  the following afternoon. This invitation Cameron accepted.
