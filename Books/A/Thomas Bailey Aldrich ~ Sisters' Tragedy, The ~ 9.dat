Listen, my masters! I speak naught but truth.<br> From dawn to dawn they drifted on and on,<br> Not knowing whither nor to what dark end.<br> Now the North froze them, now the hot South scorched.<br> Some called to God, and found great comfort so;<br> Some gnashed their teeth with curses, and some laughed<br> An empty laughter, seeing they yet lived,<br> So sweet was breath between their foolish lips.<br> Day after day the same relentless sun,<br> Night after night the same unpitying stars.<br> At intervals fierce lightnings tore the clouds,<br> Showing vast hollow spaces, and the sleet<br> Hissed, and the torrents of the sky were loosed.<br> From time to time a hand relaxed its grip,<br> And some pale wretch slid down into the dark<br> With stifled moan, and transient horror seized<br> The rest who waited, knowing what must be.<br> At every turn strange shapes reached up and clutched<br> The whirling wreck, held on awhile, and then<br> Slipt back into that blackness whence they came.<br> Ah, hapless folk, to be so tost and torn,<br> So racked by hunger, fever, fire, and wave,<br> And swept at last into the nameless void--<br> Frail girls, strong men, and mothers with their babes! 
And was none saved? 
My masters, not a soul! 
O shipman, woful, woful is thy tale!<br> Our hearts are heavy and our eyes are dimmed.<br> What ship is this that suffered such ill fate? 
What ship, my masters? Know ye not?--The World!
