The Reverend Arthur Collingham Berkeley, curate of St. Fredegond's,  lounged lazily in his own neatly padded wickerwork easy-chair,  opposite the large lattice-paned windows of his pretty little  first-floor rooms in the front quad of Magdalen.    
'There's a great deal to be said, Le Breton, in favour of October  term,' he observed, in his soft, musical voice, as he gazed pensively  across the central grass-plot to the crimson drapery of the Founder's  Tower. 'Just look at that magnificent Virginia creeper over there,  now; just look at the way the red on it melts imperceptibly into  Tyrian purple and cloth of gold! Isn't that in itself argument  enough to fling at Hartmann's head, if he ventured to come here  sprinkling about his heresies, with his affected little spray-shooter,  in the midst of a drowsy Oxford autumn? The Cardinal never saw  Virginia creeper, I suppose; a man of his taste wouldn't have been  guilty of committing such a gross practical anachronism as that,  any more than he would have smoked a cigarette before tobacco was  invented; but if only he could have seen the October effect on that  tower yonder, he'd have acknowledged that his own hat and robe were  positively nowhere in the running, for colour, wouldn't he?'    
'Well,' answered Herbert, putting down the Venetian glass goblet  he had been examining closely with due care into its niche in the  over-mantel, 'I've no doubt Wolsey had too much historical sense  ever to step entirely out of his own century, like my brother Ernest,  for instance; but I've never heard his opinion on the subject of  colour-harmonies, and I should suspect it of having been distinctly  tinged with nascent symptoms of renaissance vulgarity. This is a  lovely bit of Venetian, really, Berkeley. How the dickens do you  manage to pick up all these pretty things, I wonder? Why can't I  afford them, now?'    
'What a question for the endowed and established to put to a poor  starving devil of a curate like me!' said Berkeley lightly. 'You,  an incarnate sinecure and vested interest, a creature revelling in  an unearned income of fabulous Oriental magnificence--I dare say,  putting one thing with another, fully as much as five hundred a  year--to ask me, the unbeneficed and insignificant, with my wretched  pittance of eighty pounds per annum and my three pass-men a term  for classical mods, how I scrape together the few miserable, hoarded  ha'pence which I grudgingly invest in my pots and pipkins! I save  them from my dinner, Mr. Bursar--I save them. If the Church only  recognised modest merit as it ought to do!--if the bishops only  listened with due attention to the sound and scholarly exegesis of  my Sunday evening discourses at St. Fredegond's!--then, indeed, I  might be disposed to regard things through a more satisfied medium  --the medium of a nice, fat, juicy country living. But for you,  Le Breton--you, sir, a pluralist and a sanguisorb of the deepest  dye--to reproach me with my Franciscan poverty--oh, it's too  cruel!'    
'I'm an abuse, I know,' Herbert answered, smiling and waving his  hand gracefully. 'I at once admit it. Abuses exist, unhappily; and  while they continue do so, isn't it better they should envisage  themselves as me than as some other and probably less deserving  fellow?'    
'No, it's not, decidedly. I should much prefer that one of them  envisaged itself as me.'    
'Ah, of course. From your own strictly subjective point of view  that's very natural. I also look at the question abstractly from  the side of the empirical ego, and correctly deduce a corresponding  conclusion. Only then, you see, the terms of the minor premiss are  luckily reversed.'    
'Well, my dear fellow,' said the curate, 'the fact about the  tea-things is this. You eat up your income, devour your substance  in riotous living; I prefer to feast my eyes and ears to my grosser  senses. You dine at high table, and fare sumptuously every day;  I take a commons of cold beef for lunch, and have tea off an egg  and roll in my own rooms at seven. You drink St. Emilion or still  hock; I drink water from the well or the cup that cheers but  not obfuscates. The difference goes to pay for the crockery. Do  likewise, and with your untold wealth you might play Aunt Sally at  Oriental blue, and take cock-shots with a boot-jack at hawthorn-pattern  vases.'    
'At any rate, Berkeley, you always manage to get your money's worth  of amusement out of your money.'    
'Of course, because I lay myself out to do it. Buy a bottle of  champagne, drink it off, and there you have to show for your total  permanent investment on the transaction the memory of a noisy evening  and a headache the next morning. Buy a flute, or a book of poems,  or a little picture, or a Palissy platter, and you have something  to turn to with delight and admiration for half a lifetime.'    
'Ah, but it isn't everybody who can isolate himself so utterly  from the workaday world and live so completely in his own little  paradise of art as you can, my dear fellow. Non omnia possumus  omnes. You seem to be always up in the aesthetic clouds, with your  own music automatically laid on, and no need of cherubim or seraphim  to chant continually for your gratification. Play me something of  your own on your flute now, like a good fellow.'    
'No, I won't; because the spirit doesn't move me. It's treachery  to the divine gift to play when you don't want to. Besides, what's  the use of playing before <i>you</i> when you're not the dean of a musical  cathedral? David was wiser; he played only before Saul, who had  of course all the livings in his own gift, no doubt. I've got a  new thing running in my head this very minute that you shall hear  though, all the same, as soon as I've hammered it into shape--a  sort of villanette in music, a little whiff of country freshness,  suggested by the new ethereal acquisition, little Miss Butterfly.  Have you seen Miss Butterfly yet?'    
'Not by that name, at any rate. Who is she?'    
'Oh, the name's my own invention. Mademoiselle Volauvent, I  mean--the little bit of whirligig thistledown from Devonshire,  Oswald's sister, you know, of Oriel.'    
'Ah, that one! Yes; just caught a glimpse of her in the High on  Thursday. Very pretty, certainly, and as airy as a humming-bird.'    
'That's her! She's coming here to lunch this morning. If you're  a good boy, and will promise not to say anything naughty, you may  stop and meet her. She's a nice little thing, but rather timid at  seeing so many fresh faces. You mustn't frighten her by discussing  the Absolute and the Unconditioned, or bore her by talking about  Aristotle's Politics, or the revolutions in Corcyra. For you know,  my dear Le Breton, if you <i>have</i> a fault, it is that you're such a  consummate and irrepressible prig; now aren't you really?'    
'I'm hardly a fair judge on that subject, I suppose, Berkeley; but  if <i>you</i> have a rudimentary glimmering of a virtue, it is that you're  such a deliciously frank and yet considerate critic. I'll pocket  your rudeness though, and eat your lunch, in spite of it. Is Miss  Butterfly, as you call her, as stand-off as her brother?'    
'Not at all. She's accueillante to the last degree.'    
'Very restricted, I suppose--a country girl of the first water?  Horizon absolutely bounded by the high hedges of her native parish?'    
'Oh dear no! Anything but that. She's like her brother, naturally  quick and adaptive.'    
'Oswald's an excellent fellow in his way,' said Herbert, button-holing  his own waistcoat; 'but he's spoilt by two bad traits. In the first  place, he's so dreadfully conscious of the fact that he has risen  from a lower position; and then, again, he's so engrossingly and  pervadingly mathematical. X square seems to have seized upon him  bodily, and to have wormed its fatal way into his very marrow.'    
'Ah, you must remember, he's true to his first love. Culture came  to him first, while yet he abode in Philistia, under the playful  disguise of a conic section. He scaled his way out of Gath by means  of a treatise on elementary trigonometry, and evaded Askelon on  the wings of an undulatory theory of light. It is different with  us, you know, who have emerged from the land of darkness by the  regular classical and literary highway. We feed upon Rabelais and  Burton; he flits carelessly from flower to flower of the theory of  Quantics. If he were an idealist painter, like Rossetti, he would  paint great allegorical pictures for us, representing an asymptotic  curve appearing to him in a dream, and introducing that blushing  maiden, Hyperbola, to his affectionate consideration.'    
As Berkeley spoke, a rap sounded on the oak, and Ernest Le Breton  entered the room.    
'What, you here, Herbert?' he said with a shade of displeasure in  his tone. 'Are you, too, of the bidden?'    
'Berkeley has asked me to stop and lunch with him, if that's what  you mean.'    
'We shall be quite a party,' said Ernest, seating himself, and looking  abstractedly round the room. 'Why, Berkeley,' as his eye fell upon  the Venetian vase, 'you've positively got some more gew-gaws here.  This one's new, isn't it? Eh!'    
'Yes. I picked it up for a song, this long, at a stranded village  in the Apennines. Literally for a song, for it cost me just what  I got from Fradelli for that last little piece of mine. It's very  pretty, isn't it?'    
'Very; exquisite, really; the blending of the tones is so perfect.  I wish I knew what to think about these things. I can't make up  my mind about them. Sometimes I think it's all right to make them  and buy them; sometimes I think it's all wrong.'    
'Oh, if that's your difficulty,' said Berkeley, pulling his white  tie straight at the tiny round looking-glass, 'I can easily reassure  you. Do you think a hundred and eighty pounds a year an excessive  sum for one person to spend upon his own entire living?'    
'It doesn't seem so, as expenses go amongst <i>us</i>,' said Ernest, seriously,  'though I dare say it would look like shocking extravagance to a  working man with a wife and family.'    
'Very well, that's the very outside I ever spend upon myself in  any one year, for the excellent reason that it's all I ever get to  spend in any way. Now, why shouldn't I spend it on the things that  please me best and are joys for ever, instead of on the things that  disappear at once and perish in the using?'    
'Ah, but that's not the whole question,' Ernest answered, looking  at the curate fixedly. 'What right have you and I to spend so much  when others are wanting for bread? And what right have you or I  to make other people work at producing these useless trinkets for  our sole selfish gratification?'    
'Well now, Le Breton,' said the parson, assuming a more serious tone,  'you know you're a reasonable creature, so I don't mind discussing  this question with you. You've got an ethical foundation to  your nature, and you want to see things done on decent grounds of  distributive justice. There I am one with you. But you've also got  an aesthetic side to your nature, which makes you worth arguing  with upon the matter. I won't argue with your vulgar materialised  socialist, who would break up the frieze of the Parthenon for road  metal, or pull down Giotto's frescoes because they represent scenes  in the fabulous lives of saints and martyrs. You know what a work  of art is when you see it; and therefore you're worth arguing  with, which your vulgar Continental socialist really isn't. The  one cogent argument for him is the whiff of grape-shot.'    
'I recognise,' said Ernest, 'that the works of art, of poetry, or  of music, which we possess are a grand inheritance from the past;  and I would do all I could to preserve them intact for those that  come after us.'    
'I'm sure you would. No restoration or tinkering in you, I'm  certain. Well, then, would you give anything for a world which  hadn't got this aesthetic side to its corporate existence? Would  you give anything for a world which didn't care at all for painting,  sculpture, music, poetry? I wouldn't. I don't want such a world.  I won't countenance such a world. I'll do nothing to further or  advance such a world. It's utterly repugnant to me, and I banish  it, as Themistocles banished the Athenians.'    
'But consider,' said Ernest, 'we live in a world where men and women  are actually starving. How can we reconcile to our consciences the  spending of one penny on one useless thing when others are dying  of sheer want, and cold, and nakedness? That's the great question  that's always oppressing my poor dissatisfied conscience.'    
'So it does everybody's--except Herbert's: he explains it all on  biological grounds as the beautiful discriminative action of natural  selection. Simple, but not consolatory. Still, look at the other  side of the question. Suppose you and everybody else were to give  up all superfluities, and confine all your energies to the unlimited  production of bare necessaries. Suppose you occupy every acre  of land with your corn-fields, or your piggeries; and sweep away  all the parks, and woods, and heaths, and moorlands in England.  Suppose you keep on letting your population multiply as fast as it  chooses--and it <i>will</i> multiply, you know, in that ugly, reckless,  anti-Malthusian fashion of its own--till every rood of ground  maintains its man, and only just maintains him; and what will you  have got then?'    
'A dead level of abject pauperism,' put in Herbert blandly; 'a  reductio ad absurdum of all your visionary Schurzian philosophy,  my dear Ernest. Look at it another way, now, and just consider.  Which really and truly matters most to you and me, a great work  of art or a highly respectable horny-handed son of toil, whose  acquaintance we have never had the pleasure of personally making?  Suppose you read in the Times that the respectable horny-handed  one has fallen off a scaffolding and broken his neck; and that the  Dresden Madonna has been burnt by an unexpected accident; which  of the two items of intelligence affects you the most acutely? My  dear fellow, you may push your humanitarian enthusiasm as far as  ever you like; but in your heart of hearts you know as well as I  do that you'll deeply regret the loss of the Madonna, and you'll  never think again about the fate of the respectable horny-handed,  his wife or children.'    
Ernest's answer, if he had any to make, was effectually nipped in  the bud by the entrance of the scout, who came in to announce Mr.  and Miss Oswald and Mrs. Martindale. Edie wore the grey dress,  her brother's present, and flitted into the room after her joyous  fashion, full of her first fresh delight at the cloistered quad of  Magdalen.    
'What a delicious college, Mr. Berkeley!' she said, holding out  her hand to him brightly. 'Good-morning, Mr. Le Breton; this is  your brother, I know by the likeness. I thought New College very  beautiful, but nothing I've seen is quite as beautiful as Magdalen.  What a privilege to live always in such a place! And what an  exquisite view from your window here!'    
'Yes,' said Berkeley, moving a few music-books from the seat in the  window-sill; 'come and sit by it, Miss Oswald. Mrs. Martindale,  won't you put your shawl down? How's the Professor to-day? So sorry  he couldn't come.'    
'Ah, he had to go to sit on one of his Boards,' said the old lady,  seating herself. 'But you know I'm quite accustomed to going out  without him.'    
Arthur Berkeley knew as much; indeed, being a person of minute  strategical intellect, he had purposely looked out a day on which  the Professor had to attend a meeting of the delegates of something  or other, so as to secure Mrs. Martindale's services without the  supplementary drawback of that prodigious bore. Not that he was  particularly anxious for Mrs. Martindale's own society, which was  of the most strictly negative character; but he didn't wish Edie  to be the one lady in a party of four men, and he invited the  Professor's wife as an excellent neutral figure-head, to keep her  in countenance. Ladies were scarcer then in Oxford than they are  nowadays. The married fellow was still a tentative problematical  experiment in those years, and the invasion of the Parks by young  couples had hardly yet begun in earnest. So female society was  still at a considerable local premium, and Berkeley was glad enough  to secure even colourless old Mrs. Martindale to square his party  at any price.    
'And how do you like Oxford, Miss Oswald?' asked Ernest, making  his way towards the window.    
'My dear Le Breton, what a question to put to her!' said Berkeley,  smiling. 'As if Oxford were a place to be appraised offhand, on  three days' acquaintance. You remind me of the American who went  to look at Niagara, and made an approving note in his memorandum  book to say that he found it really a very elegant cataract.'    
'Oh, but you <i>must</i> form some opinion of it at least, at first sight,'  cried Edie; 'you can't help having an impression of a place from  the first moment, even if you haven't a judgment on it, can you  now? I think it really surpasses my expectations, Mr. Le Breton,  which is always a pleasant surprise. Venice fell below them; Florence  just came up to them; but Oxford, I think, really surpasses them.'    
'We have three beautiful towns in Britain,' Berkeley said. ('As if  he were a Welsh Triad,' suggested Herbert Le Breton, parenthetically.)  'Torquay, Oxford, Edinburgh. Torquay is all nature, spoilt by what  I won't call art; Oxford is all art, superimposed on a swamp that  I won't call nature; Edinburgh is both nature and art, working pretty  harmoniously together, to make up a unique and exquisite picture.'    
'Just like Naples, Venice, and Heidelberg,' said Edie, half to  herself; but Berkeley caught at the words quickly as she said them.  'Yes,' he answered; 'a very good parallel, only Oxford has a trifle  more nature about it than Venice. The lagoon, without the palaces,  would be simply hideous; the Oseney flats, without the colleges,  would be nothing worse than merely dull.'    
'We owe a great deal,' said Ernest, gazing out towards the quadrangle,  'to the forgotten mass of labouring humanity who piled all those  blocks of shapeless stone into beautiful forms for us who come after  to admire and worship. I often wonder, when I sit here in Berkeley's  window-seat, and look across the quad to the carved pinnacles on  the Founder's Tower there, whether any of us can ever hope to leave  behind to our successors any legacy at all comparable to the one  left us by those nameless old mediaeval masons. It's a very saddening  thought that we for whom all these beautiful things have been put  together--we whom labouring humanity has pampered and petted from  our cradles upward, feeding us on its whitest bread, and toiling  for us with all its weary sinews--that we probably will never do  anything at all for it and for the world in return, but will simply  eat our way through life aimlessly, and die forgotten in the end like  the beasts that perish. It ought to make us, as a class, terribly  ashamed of our own utter and abject inutility.'    
Edie looked at him with a sort of hushed surprise; she was accustomed  to hear Harry talk radical talk enough after his own fashion, but  radicalism of this particular pensive tinge she was not accustomed  to. It interested her, and made her wonder what sort of man Mr. Le  Breton might really be.    
'Well, you know, Mr. Le Breton,' said old Mrs. Martindale,  complacently, 'we must remember that Providence has wisely ordained  that we shouldn't all of us be masons or carpenters. Some of us are  clergymen, now, and look what a useful, valuable life a clergyman's  is, after all, isn't it, Mr. Berkeley?' Berkeley smiled a faint  smile of amusement, but said nothing. 'Others are squires and  landed gentry; and I'm sure the landed gentry are very desirable  in keeping up the tone of the country districts, and setting a  pattern of virtue and refinement to their poorer neighbours. What  would the country villages be, for example, if it weren't for the  centres of culture afforded by the rectory and the hall, eh, Miss  Oswald.' Edith thought of quavering old Miss Catherine Luttrell  gossiping with the rector's wife, and held her peace. 'You may depend  upon it Providence has ordained these distinctions of classes for  its own wise purposes, and we needn't trouble our heads at all  about trying to alter them.'    
'I've always observed,' said Harry Oswald, 'that Providence is  supposed to have ordained the existing order for the time being,  whatever it may be, but not the order that is at that exact moment  endeavouring to supplant it. If I were to visit Central Africa,  I should confidently expect to be told by the rain-doctors that  Providence had ordained the absolute power of the chief, and the  custom of massacring his wives and slaves at his open grave side.  I believe in Russia it's usually allowed that Providence has placed  the orthodox Czar at the head of the nation, and that any attempt  to obtain a constitution from him is simply flat rebellion and  flying in the face of Providence. In England we had a King John  once, and we extracted a constitution out of him and sundry other  kings by main force; and here, it's acquiescence in the present  limited aristocratic government that makes up obedience to  the Providential arrangement of things apparently. But how about  America? eh, Mrs. Martindale? Did Providence ordain that George  Washington was to rebel against his most sacred majesty King George  III., or did it not? And did it ordain that George Washington was  to knock his most sacred majesty's troops into a cocked hat, or  did it not? And did it ordain that Abraham Lincoln was to free the  slaves, or did it not? What I want to know is this: can it be said  that Providence has ordained every class distinction in the whole  world, from Dahomey to San Francisco? And has it ordained every  Government, past and present, from the Chinese Empire to the French  Convention? Did it ordain, for example, the revolution of '89?  That's the question I should like to have answered.'    
'Dear me, Mr. Oswald,' said the old lady meekly, taken aback by  Harry's voluble vehemence: 'I suppose Providence permits some things  and ordains others.'    
'And does it permit American democracy or ordain it?' asked the  merciless Harry.    
'Don't you see, Mrs. Martindale,' put in Berkeley, coming gently  to her rescue, 'your principle amounts in effect to saying that  whatever is, is right.'    
'Exactly,' said the old lady, forgetting at once all about Dahomey  or the Convention, and coming back mentally to her squires and  rectors. 'The existing order is wisely arranged by Providence, and  we mustn't try to set ourselves up against it.'    
'But if whatever is, is right,' Edie said, laughing, 'then Mr. Le  Breton's socialism must be right too, you see, because it exists  in him no doubt for some wise purpose of Providence; and if he and  those who think with him can succeed in changing things generally  according to their own pattern, then the new system that they  introduce will be the one that Providence has shown by the result  to be the favoured one.'    
'In short,' said Ernest, musingly, 'Mrs. Martindale's principle  sanctifies success. It's the old theory of "treason never  prospers--what's the reason? Because whene'er it prospers 'tis not  treason." If we could only introduce a socialist republic, then it  would be the reactionaries who would be setting themselves up against  constituted authority, and so flying in the face of Providence.'    
'Fancy lecturing a recalcitrant archbishop and a remonstrant  ci-devant duchess,' cried Berkeley, lightly, 'upon the moral guilt  and religious sinfulness of rebellion against the constituted  authority of a communist phalanstery. It would be simply charming.  I can imagine myself composing a dignified exhortation to deliver  to his grace, entirely compiled out of his own printed pastorals, on  the duty of submission and the danger of harbouring an insubordinate  spirit. Do make me chaplain-in-ordinary to your house of correction  for irreclaimable aristocrats, Le Breton, as soon as you once get  your coming socialist republic fairly under way.'    
'Luncheon is on the table, sir,' said the scout, breaking in  unceremoniously upon their discussion.    
If Arthur Berkeley lunched by himself upon a solitary commons of  cold beef, he certainly did not treat his friends and guests in  corresponding fashion. His little entertainment was of the daintiest  and airiest character, so airy that, as Edie herself observed  afterwards to Harry, it took away all the sense of meat and drink  altogether, and left one only a pleased consciousness of full  artistic gratification. Even Ernest, though he had his scruples  about the aspic jelly, might eat the famous Magdalen chicken cutlets,  his brother said, 'with a distinct feeling of exalted gratitude to  the arduous culinary evolution of collective humanity.'    
'Consider,' said Herbert, balancing neatly a little pyramid of  whip cream and apricot jam upon his fork, 'consider what ages of  slow endeavour must have gone to the development of such a complex  mixture as this, Ernest, and thank your stars that you were born  in this nineteenth century of Soyer and Francatelli, instead of  being condemned to devour a Homeric feast with the unsophisticated  aid of your own five fingers.'    
'But do tell me, Mr. Le Breton,' asked Edie, with one of her pretty  smiles, 'what will this socialist republic of yours be like when  it actually comes about? I'm dying to know all about it.'    
'Really, Miss Oswald,' Ernest answered, in a half-embarrassed tone,  'I don't quite know how to reply to such a very wide and indefinite  question. I haven't got any cut-and-dried constitutional scheme of  my own for reorganising the whole system of society, any distinct  panacea to cure all the ills that collective flesh is heir to. I  leave the details of the future order to your brother Harry. The  thing that troubles me is not so much how to reform the world at  large as how to shape one's own individual course aright in the  actual midst of it. As a single unit of the whole, I want rather  guidance for my private conduct than a scheme for redressing the  universal dislocation of things in general. It seems to me, every  man's first duty is to see that he himself is in the right attitude  towards society, and afterwards he may proceed to enquire whether  society is in the right attitude towards him and all its other  members. But if we were all to begin by redressing ourselves,  there would be nothing left to redress, I imagine, when we turned  to attack the second half of our problem. The great difficulty I  myself experience is this, that <i>I</i> can't discover any adequate  social justification for my own personal existence. But I really  oughtn't to bore other people with my private embarrassments upon  that head.'    
'You see,' said Herbert Le Breton, carelessly, 'my brother represents  the ethical element in the socialist movement, Miss Oswald, while  Harry represents the political element. Each is valuable in its  way; but Oswald's is the more practical. You can move great masses  into demanding their rights; you can't so easily move them into  cordially recognising their duties. Hammer, hammer, hammer at the  most obvious abuses; that's the way all the political victories  are finally won. If I were a radical at all, I should go with you,  Oswald. But happily I'm not one; I prefer the calm philosophic  attitude of perfectly objective neutrality.'    
'And if I were a radical,' said Berkeley, with a tinge of sadness  in his voice as he poured himself out a glass of hock, 'I should  go with Le Breton. But unfortunately I'm not one, Miss Oswald, I'm  only a parson.'
