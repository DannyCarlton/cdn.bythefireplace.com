  The big clock in the City Hall was striking ten when Jim Falkner   reached the pitch-black cobblestone street to which his letter had   directed him. It was a curious letter and an unusual hour for an   appointment with a rich man; but it struck him, as he stopped to light   his pipe, that up to date the street was the most disquieting feature   of all. It ran close along the lake front and smelled dankly of fish,   tar and oils. It was narrow and the buildings rose high on each side,   unlighted and black, giving a tunnel-like effect to the passage   between them. For a few moments Falkner stood and looked into the   mouth of this city abyss, whence came no sound of footsteps or voices,   wondering how he would find the number he wanted and why it was that a   millionaire chose this sort of a dungeon for his offices. Suddenly, a   block and a half down, he saw a thin streak of light shoot out into   the street and remain there, and he at once made up his mind that this   was meant to guide him. Puffing at his pipe and with his right hand in   his coat pocket where his fingers touched a chilly little automatic   revolver, Falkner dived into the darkness. 
  There was something about his present adventure that curiously  stirred  Falkner, to whom adventure of one sort or another had been the  spice  of existence ever since he could remember. Never had he entered  a  thing more blindly than he was going into this. A week before a  letter  had been delivered to him aboard his ship at Milwaukee&#8212;a  letter which  he would have attributed to a crank or a madman if it had  not borne  the signature of a well-known Chicago millionaire. Among  other things  it urged upon him, if he valued his future prospects, to  be on hand at  a certain appointed hour at a certain number in a  certain street in  Chicago; and enclosed was a check for five hundred  dollars as a  guarantee of faith on the part of the sender. 
  It was just five minutes past the appointed hour when Falkner  halted  under the stream of light that shot out of a second-story  window,  struck a match and found the number he wanted. 
  A narrow stairway, blacker than the black street, led to the second   floor; and Falkner stumbled up, making considerable noise because of   the unusual narrowness of the steps. Scarcely had he reached the top   when a door opened and a flood of light poured forth. In this light   stood a man whom Jim Falkner had never seen, and whose round pink   face, good-humoured smile and cheerful corpulence dispelled in an   instant half of the doubts that the black street and the blacker   stairway had forced upon him The man appeared to be about fifty,   though his short-cropped hair was almost white. He was puffing   vigorously at a big black cigar and chuckled audibly when Falkner   stumbled at the last step. &quot;No lights out here,&quot; he apologized. &quot;Is   this Captain Jim Falkner?&quot; 
  &quot;It is,&quot; replied the younger man. 
  &quot;Of course it is! I knew it. Foolish question,&quot; jerked out the  other.  &quot;In fact, I've got your picture on my desk.&quot; He reached out a  hand and  Falkner was surprised at the strength of his grip. 
  &quot;Cut it out of a paper when you found that lost copper-ship,&quot; he   explained. &quot;Mighty good piece of work that! The scoundrels who beat   you out of your salvage ought to be hung.&quot; 
  Falkner laughed as he accepted a cigar which the other had already   pulled from a bulging waistcoat pocket. &quot;I suppose I ought to ask if   this is Mr. Winn,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Yes; I'm Winn&#8212;J. Cortlandt Winn. Come in.&quot; 
  Falkner entered from the main hall into a yet smaller one and Winn   closed the door behind them. Then he opened a second door and gently   thrust his visitor ahead of him into a brilliantly lighted room, in   which the only furniture seemed to be a big table, half a dozen chairs   and an empty bookcase. The floor was bare. Directly over the table   burned a small arc-light; and under this, gazing straight at him as he   entered, was seated a young woman. 
  &quot;My daughter&#8212;Captain Falkner,&quot; said Winn. 
  The girl bowed slightly. Her broad-brimmed hat shaded her face, but   not enough to conceal from him its remarkable beauty. She continued to   gaze at him intently for a moment, her lips parted and her dark eyes   filled with a questioning curiosity. As Falkner seated himself   opposite Winn he caught a glimpse of her profile and the glint of the   light in her hair. On the table before her was a diminutive paper pad,   bound in a red morocco cover, and between her fingers she held a slim   yellow pencil. Falkner faced the millionaire ship-owner with new and   ill-concealed interest. 
  &quot;I won't detain you long, Captain Falkner,&quot; said Winn, his voice   becoming sharp and decisive. He ran a number of papers between his   fingers as he continued: &quot;You are undoubtedly puzzled at my   communication and you will be more mystified before I am through. One   thing I must ask of you, however, before I continue with the   proposition that I have in mind: Whether you accept it or not, I must   be assured that not a word of what passes between us is to go beyond   this room. If you do not wish to go into the adventure which I have in   mind, and which will take perhaps a month of your time, we are to   shake hands and forget that we have ever seen each other. If you join   me I will pay you twenty-five thousand dollars for your month's   service.&quot; 
  Falkner's glance shot from Winn to the girl. Her beautiful eyes  were  glowing with subdued excitement as she looked at him. 
  &quot;That's rather an unusual price to offer an ordinary lake captain,&quot;  he  replied. &quot;It arouses my curiosity. I can only give you my word that   whatever you may say will be regarded as confidential. If you can   accept that you may go on.&quot; 
  A curious smile played over Winn's face. 
  &quot;I do accept it, Falkner,&quot; he said. &quot;Listen!&quot; He leaned half over  the  table, his plump hands clasped in front of him. &quot;This is a  remarkable  adventure that I am about to put in your way. Success  means&#8212;well,  everything to me! I have been planning it for months, and  up until one  month ago the one thing I lacked was a man&#8212;a brave man;  a man who was  willing to take a risk; a man whose word was as good as  a Government  bond. I remembered you because I was one of the owners of  the ship  whose copper salvage you lost. Here&#8212;right here&#8212;&quot; he paused  to tap the  papers under his hand&#8212;&quot;I've got your record down in black  and white.  I sent a man to find out what you were as a boy, and I've  followed  you, year by year, clean up to the present time.&quot; 
  Falkner gave a gasp of astonishment. He looked at Miss Winn, then   stared back at the ship-owner. &quot;I hope you missed some things,&quot; he   said. 
  &quot;A few&#8212;perhaps,&quot; resumed Winn, glancing over the papers; &quot;but we  at  least discovered enough. I'm confident you're the man I want. A  little  matter of holding up a ship on Lake Superior and abducting  eight of  her passengers will be just a sort of holiday recreation for  you.  That's what I want you to do.&quot; 
  Falkner had recovered his self-possession. Coolly he relighted his   pipe, which had gone out. &quot;This is all mighty interesting,&quot; he said,   with an ominous hardness in his voice. &quot;You've searched out my life   story and at the end you sum me up as a high-class criminal, eh?&quot; 
  A low exclamation that was scarcely more than a fluttering throat  note  came from the girl. Falkner looked straight at her, wondering if  she  would speak. Her eyes were filled with a sudden painful anxiety as  she  looked from him to her father. 
  &quot;Great Heavens&#8212;no!&quot; almost shouted the ship owner. &quot;Falkner, I  want a  man!&#8212;and a man isn't a criminal. If I've given you a wrong   impression, I'm a fool. I've called you here because I feel that I can   place absolute confidence in you&#8212;because, in three words, you are   brave, adventurous and at the same time honourable. You're the only   man of your sort on the lakes; and you must understand the confidence   I place in you when I tell you that I am practically surrendering my   own reputation, as well as my daughter's, into your hands. If you   cannot have faith in me, will you in Glady&#8212;Miss Winn?&quot; 
  Again Falkner looked at Miss Winn. The girl's eyes met his with  clear  frankness, but she did not speak. Her silence was beginning to  disturb  him &quot;Go on, Mr. Winn,&quot; he said. &quot;I am at least anxious to hear   something of the business which you have mapped out for me.&quot; 
  &quot;It is this,&quot; said the ship-owner in a low voice and the girl  leaned  nearer. &quot;Three weeks from to-day the steel freighter Uranus  leaves  Duluth for Buffalo with a load of ore. In her cabins she will  carry  eight passengers&#8212;all men. I want you to board this freighter,  kidnap  those eight men and hide them somewhere in the wilderness along  the  north shore for a week or ten days. At the end of that time your  work  will be done and I will hand you a check for fifteen thousand  dollars.  I will give you the first ten thousand to-night if you agree  to do the  work. More than this I cannot tell you. You must remain in  the dark as  to my motive for kidnapping these men and hiding them away  for a time;  but I can assure you that there is practically no danger  in the  undertaking.&quot; 
  Falkner's strong face lighted up with an amused smile. 
  &quot;Only a little matter of piracy, eh?&quot; he laughed. &quot;And do you know   what that means, Mr. Winn? On the Great Lakes piracy is subject to the   laws of the state for which the vessel upon which the piracy is   committed is bound. The Uranus, you say, will load for Buffalo. In New   York the one penalty for piracy is death. Don't assume that I am   afraid. I like excitement. Perhaps I am too fond of it. But as for   flying the black flag and committing crime&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You won't be committing a crime!&quot; cried Winn, striking the table  with  his fat hand. &quot;I give you my word on that, Falkner. I know it's  hard  to believe, but it's true. You run absolutely no risk, except the   small one of holding up the crew of the freighter while you unload her   passengers. You can't believe this, of course; so I've arranged for a   way to checkmate your suspicions. Would I sacrifice my daughter,   Falkner? Ask yourself that. And she is to accompany you. She is to   captain the expedition. You are to obey her orders implicitly. If you   become a pirate she becomes one. If peril faces you it confronts her   as well. I am sending her as a pledge that in boarding the Uranus and   kidnapping her passengers you will not be committing a crime. You will   so completely surprise the vessel's crew that, with a little display   of arms, they will give you no trouble. You will need half a dozen   good men to board the ship, armed with revolvers. Load the pistols   with blank cartridges, but give each man some sort of weapon&#8212;a sand   billy, for instance&#8212;that will stun but not kill if you are forced to   fight. What do you say? Will you undertake this expedition&#8212;under   Gladys, my daughter?&quot; 
  With that soft strange throat sound, so like the fluttering note of  a  bird, the girl suddenly leaned over the table and held out one of  the  little pages of the note-book to Falkner. She smiled straight into  his  eyes, and then she pouted her red lips pleadingly as he took the  slip,  upon which she had written the following words: &quot;Please pardon  me for  not speaking; I must unfortunately write all that I have to  say. But I  can hear. You will go, won't you? Please!&quot; 
  With a curious thrill, Falkner understood the meaning of the   diminutive pad under the slim white hand of the ship-owner's daughter.   She could not talk. She was dumb. He looked at her again. Her mouth   was still pouted; her eyes glowed with luminous and anxious   questioning. It was this girl, and not Winn or the fortune he offered   him, that he thought of now. Her beautiful face still pleaded with   him, and he felt a sudden tremulous stir within him that held him   silent while he looked into her eyes. Her lips moved. He could see the   words as she framed them: &quot;You will go? Please!&quot; She held out a hand   to him; and with a low strange laugh he clasped the hand in his own   big brown palm, trembling like an excited boy. 
  &quot;Yes, I will go!&quot; he said. 
  He felt her fingers tighten about his. She laughed&#8212;a sweet  voiceless  laugh&#8212;her dark eyes glowing with joy; and in that moment  Falkner felt  the earth slipping away from, under his feet. &quot;I will  go,&quot; he said  again, speaking to her alone. &quot;I will go&#8212;with you as my  captain.&quot; 
  An hour later, in the cabin aboard his own ship, Falkner pulled two   slips of paper from his coat pocket. One was a check for ten thousand   dollars; the other was Miss Winn's note. A dozen times he read the   words she had written, a slow flush burning in his face. As he   refolded the slip he noticed a bit of writing on the other side of the   paper. In a careless hand the girl had written: <BR> &nbsp;&quot;Captain Jim Falkner, Pirate.&quot; 
  Three weeks and two days after Falkner's first interview with J.   Cortlandt Winn, the sloop-yacht Silver Fox lay thirty miles off   Thunder Cape, riding lazily and with a scarcely perceptible rolling   motion in the long Superior swells. 
  In the bow stood Miss Winn, searching the level sea with a pair of   powerful binoculars. As Falkner came from his cabin he stopped for a   moment in the shade of the deck-house to look at the girl, whose tall   slender form was silhouetted against a late afternoon sun. She looked   bewitchingly girlish as she stood posed a step or two back from the   rail, her shining hair done up in a big, long braid, her white arms   bared to the elbows. He drew a deep breath and stepped forward. The   three days they had been together since leaving Duluth had sped with   blissful swiftness for him and yet it seemed as though he had known   her for years. They had been days of a steadily increasing yearning&#8212;   days of joy; days of pain; days in which there had come to him, in the   same hour, hope and hopelessness. And with these there was a growing   fear&#8212;a fear that this girl, in spite of Winn's protestations, was   facing a deadly peril. 
  She turned as he came up, with one of those sweet smiles that made  him  want to take her in his arms. &quot;I can make out three freighters,&quot;  she  wrote on her pad. &quot;One of them is a big boat. It ought to be the   Uranus.&quot; 
  He took the glasses from her hand. 
  &quot;It is,&quot; he said quietly, after a few minutes. &quot;I can tell by her   funnels.&quot; Before leaving his cabin he had steeled himself for a   certain unpleasant task, and the girl saw something of what was coming   in his eyes. Her face became serious before he had spoken. &quot;Miss   Winn,&quot; he said, &quot;I have restrained myself from questioning you during   the past few days, but I feel that it is my duty now in spite of my   contract with your father. There has come a change&#8212;&quot; his voice   trembled a little as he came near to the truth that was making his   heart beat excitedly and that sent again that tell-tale flood of   warmth into his face. &quot;There has come a change&#8212;in me! I must know.   Why is there need of all this mystery? Why am I about to board that   ship? What is the reason for the abduction of its passengers? You   know. You must know. I am risking everything blindly&#8212;my ship, my men,   myself. And I am doing this&#8212;&quot; He stopped again, and she saw his   throat twitch. &quot;I am doing this, not for the money your father is   paying me, but for you. If I am doing this, cannot you be honest&#8212;fair   with me? Cannot you trust me?&quot; 
  He was almost sorry that he had spoken. For an instant the  tremulous  look of pain that he had first observed in Winn's office  shot into her  eyes. The colour left her face and her lips quivered, as  though he had  hurt her. She wrote on her pad and he saw that her  fingers trembled.  &quot;I am sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I can tell you  nothing&#8212;nothing more than you  already know. I trust my father. I have  faith in you&#8212;absolute! Cannot  you have faith in me&#8212;in us?&quot; 
  &quot;In you&#8212;yes!&quot; he cried quickly, and somehow her quivering little  hand  came into his. &quot;Miss Winn&#8212;Gladys&#8212;forgive me for what I am about  to  say. I do not fear for myself or for my men. I understand and they   understand what we are undertaking. But it is for you! Listen! I can   run to Thunder Cape, send you ashore and still overtake the Uranus to-   night. Will you let me do that? If there is danger&#8212;and I am sure   there is&#8212;you must not face it. I will board the ship to-night, but   you must go ashore.&quot; 
  His voice and eyes told her more than the words he uttered. He  still  held her hand; and she answered him with the beautiful glow in  her  eyes, the pouting of her red lips, as she shook her head&#8212;the  colour  surging back into her cheeks. 
  &quot;You must go ashore!&quot; he repeated. 
  She drew her hand away and wrote rapidly, and he read the words as   they came from her pencil: &quot;If you care at all&#8212;about me&#8212;you will let   me go with you to-night. I will not go ashore voluntarily. If you   force me ashore you will be a traitor&#8212;to me. I must share the   responsibility of what is going to happen. It is necessary&#8212;to save   you from possible peril! I refuse to let you go on alone.&quot; 
  Her face was white again when she looked up. Her tremulous lips  made  an effort as if to speak, and then suddenly she turned and left  him,  running lightly to her cabin. 
  For ten minutes Falkner stood staring out over the lake toward the   black trails of smoke of the approaching freighters. Then he returned   to his own room and wrote on a piece of notepaper to be delivered to   Miss Winn by the woman cook: 
  &quot;You're a little brick! The Uranus is in sight&#8212;the third ship.  We'll  board her at the end of the first watch to-night.&quot; And then he  added,  with a happy smile: &quot;Captain Jim Falkner, Pirate.&quot; 
  Miss Winn took her meals in her own little cabin and Falkner did  not  see her again for many hours. At eight o'clock the Silver Fox was   running three-quarters of a mile astern of the Uranus, and Falkner had   a final talk with his men. There were six, including himself and not   counting the engineer. On this trip the regular stoker had been   eliminated and the cook's place had been filled by one of the men's   wives. Falkner felt that he could trust every member of his crew.   Clarkson, Findy and McGraw were old companions in adventure who would   stick by him in any project; Hawkins, the engineer, and Peters, mate   and wheelman, had been in his service for three years. Only of   Sullivan was there a question, and Falkner allowed his eyes to fall   more fully upon him as he gave his final instructions. He saw that   each man was armed with a short sand billy, and to each of them he   gave an automatic revolver loaded with blank cartridges. 
  &quot;Don't fire a shot unless you are compelled to,&quot; he warned, &quot;and  then,  if you can, shoot so that your powder will be felt. And don't  crack  any heads with the billies. You're going to get a thousand  dollars  apiece for this job and we've got to do it without seriously  injuring  a person aboard that ship.&quot; 
  At nine o'clock he went to Miss Winn's cabin and knocked upon her   door. The girl opened it. She had changed her light suit for a heavier   and darker dress, and had coiled her hair upon her head. Her face was   tense and pale as she looked beyond Falkner to where the lights of the   Uranus were glowing half a mile to starboard. With a low laugh Falkner   offered her his hand. The girl's was as cold as ice, and the old   shudder of fear ran through him. After all, it was to be piracy&#8212;   nothing less. Then the girl smiled and nodded her head. 
  &quot;Yes; we are ready,&quot; he said, a little grimly. &quot;We are bearing down   upon her now. Will you remain in your cabin?&quot; 
  She shook her head negatively and went with him to the starboard  rail,  her hand resting snugly in his arm. He had little to say now.  His face  was stern and set, his jaws were squared; in his eyes there  was a  light which the girl had not seen before. In a few moments he  left her  to join his men. Rapidly the Silver Fox bore down upon the  freighter.  At last Falkner raised his megaphone. 
  &quot;Ship ahoy!&quot; he cried. &quot;Is that the Uranus?&quot; 
  In a moment the reply came back! &quot;This is the Uranus.&quot; 
  &quot;Then slow down and let us run alongside,&quot; shouted Falkner. &quot;This  is  the yacht Sea Gull, of Port Arthur, and we have important telegrams   for you from the owners.&quot; 
  As he had expected, the ruse worked. He heard the resonant clang of   the signal-gong in the engine-room of the Uranus and the big ship   began to lose speed. Two minutes later the Silver Fox ran alongside   and Findy and McGraw attached grappling hooks. The freighter lay so   deep in the water that from the deck-house Falkner jumped aboard, with   Clarkson a bound behind him. The ship's mate and the watch were the   only men on the big freighter's deck, and before either had spoken a   word Falkner and Clarkson covered them with their revolvers. 
  &quot;If you make a move or a sound we'll blow your heads off!&quot; warned   Falkner. &quot;Up with your hands!&quot; 
  The two startled men complied in an instant. The chilly glitter of  the  automatics was too real to question. As quick as cats, Findy and   McGraw came up behind them and smothered whatever words they might   have uttered under the folds of cloths specially designed for that   purpose. Within three minutes after boarding the two men lay flat upon   their backs, bound and gagged. 
  &quot;Findy, you go and gossip with the wheelman,&quot; commanded Falkner,  &quot;and  you, McGraw, watch the door to the captain's cabin. If he sticks  his  head out get a hold on him that won't let any sound get beyond  your  own ears. We don't want to arouse the crew aft, or there'll be  the  swellest sort of a fight. Now, boys, for the passengers!&quot; 
  Falkner, with Hawkins and Peters close behind him, made for the   observation room above the forward cabins. The door was unlocked, and   Peters struck a match while the other two searched for the electric   light switch. In the flood of light that followed its discovery the   three men dropped black masks from under their hats over their faces.   Falkner could not restrain an amused chuckle as he looked at Hawkins   and Peters, who stood with pistols in their hands and looked as   piratical as any cutthroats that ever sailed with a Kidd or   Blackbeard. Hawkins, with his red hair and huge red beard that   fiercely bristled out from under his mask, was alone worth a small   army as a terrorizer, and for this reason Falkner sent him in advance   as they tiptoed in a single file down the narrow stairway that led to   the state-rooms. Scarcely had they reached the foot of the stair when   the sound of subdued laughter came to them, and from under the door   that opened from the sleeping quarters into the ship's sitting-room   there issued a brilliant streak of light. Without a word Falkner   strode forward and flung open the door. At a small table in the centre   of the room sat four men, playing poker. Two others were looking on at   the game. For a moment the players were so engrossed in the movement   of certain piles of chips that they did not notice the interruption.   When they looked up three dangerous-looking men and three chillingly   murderous automatics menaced them from the door. 
  &quot;Please make no noise, gentlemen,&quot; said Falkner. &quot;We shall be   compelled to shoot the first man who makes an outcry. We want you   outside!&quot; he thrust the fierce Hawkins out into the room and pointed   to the door that led directly to the deck. &quot;Open that&#8212;and brain the   first man who shows an inclination to run! Now, gentlemen, we want you   to travel out that doorway in single file.&quot; 
  The occupants of the room had not uttered a word; and now, as they   rose to their feet, even the sombre Peters could scarcely restrain a   laugh at the spectacle they made. The man who followed Hawkins was one   of the fattest Falkner had ever seen, and the waistbands of three of   the remaining five seemed ready to burst in an effort of envious   competition. They were not a dangerous-looking lot. There was only one   young man among them and Falkner grinned when he saw that three of the   prisoners against whom he had brought such a formidable force were   completely bald. Every man there breathed respectability and   affluence; the very glisten of the bald heads, the huge and immaculate   white waistcoats, bespoke their importance and social standing&#8212;and a   sudden uncomfortable chill shot through Falkner. He had expected   ordinary passengers&#8212;or at least nothing like this appalling   aggregation, whose very rotundity and all-round luxurious appearance   made him realize more than ever the enormity of the act he was   committing. Not one of these men made a remonstrance as they followed   Hawkins through the door except the huge fat man, who spluttered and   rumbled beneath his breath, but not loud enough to call forth a   warning from his captors. For a moment they stopped where Sullivan was   guarding the deck and the two bound men, while Falkner showed them how   to board the Silver Fox. Not until they were seated in a row on the   yacht's forward deck, with Sullivan leaning over the rail above them,   did Falkner rejoin Hawkins and Peters, who were already returning for   the other two passengers. 
  Suddenly a terrific and blood-curdling yell split the calm  stillness  of the night, followed almost in the same instant by the  rapid firing  of an automatic. &quot;That's McGraw!&quot; cried Falkner. &quot;Hustle  up the  others, boys! I'll go to him.&quot; 
  He ran across the deck toward the outer entrance to the captain's   cabin and, to his horror, found McGraw flat upon his back, with a   giant of a man on his chest, busily throttling him. He knew that it   would now be only a matter of a few minutes before the ship's hands   aft would be pouring on deck, and he brought his sand billy down upon   the captain's head with considerable force. The grip on McGraw's   throat relaxed, the captain rolled over and, before Falkner could   strike again, had staggered to his feet. He prepared for the other's   rush, but his blow went wild&#8212;and just what happened after that he   could never tell. He knew that some hard and heavy object landed on   his head, and he crumpled down as completely helpless as though his   back had been broken. He was conscious of a flood of something warm   pouring over his face; then he heard loud voices, shouts, the firing   of pistols&#8212;and everything went blank. 
  Falkner's first return to consciousness was marked by a strange  pain  and the realization that a cool hand was stroking his face and   smoothing back his hair. He opened his eyes; and the second dawning   that came to him was that he was in his own well-lighted little cabin   and that the Silver Fox was under way. Then he saw Miss Winn, her   beautiful face leaning over him; and before he knew what he was doing   he put up his hand to her shining hair. He recovered himself in a   moment and dropped it back with a laughing groan. 
  &quot;Soaked&#8212;soaked good and hard,&quot; he smiled up at her, a little   painfully. &quot;Did we get 'em all?&quot; 
  She nodded affirmatively, smiling down on him with her lips and   glowing eyes in a way that made laugh joyously up into her face, like   a boy. She ran her hand through his hair again, and he took her other   hand and pressed it to his lips. It lay there for a moment, warm and   sweet, and then there came a knock at the door; and as Miss Winn drew   back Peters entered. From the door the girl smiled back at him once   more and left the cabin. 
  Peters sat down and grinned at his chief. There was something  almost  sheepish in his look. Falkner sat up. &quot;What happened?&quot; he  asked. 
  &quot;Cap'n Dix slugged you a good one on the head with a piece of iron   pipe,&quot; explained Peters, his long thin face still wearing a grin.   &quot;Before McGraw got him with his sand billy he yelled like a pack of   hyenas and half a dozen of the crew came running from aft. Sullivan   and Findy held them back until we got the other two aboard and cast   them off. Good Lord&#8212;!&quot; 
  &quot;What the devil is there to grin at?&quot; demanded Falkner. 
  &quot;I can't help grinning at what we got,&quot; said Peters. &quot;The other two   were fat an' there's four bald heads. One of them, too, was so old and   fat we had to help him aboard. I put 'em in the long cabin an' set   Clarkson an' McGraw to guard 'em; but they're as harmless as children.   They hadn't been there fifteen minutes before the whole bunch was   playing setback and poker, and smoking cigars that smelled so good I'd   like to eat a box for breakfast. Listen to that!&quot; Above the yacht's   throbbing engines Falkner heard a distant rumble of laughter, as if   many voices had joined in a sudden burst of merriment. 
  &quot;They're taking it easy,&quot; went on Peters, &quot;and the devil of it is   they're telling pirate stories while they play and predicting all   sorts of things for us. They've got Clarkson and McGraw sweating   blood; and every little while that whale of a fat un describes an   execution he once saw in New York, where they killed a pirate with   electricity.&quot; 
  Falkner's face wore anything but an amused look as he arose to his   feet and examined himself in the glass. &quot;Clarkson and McGraw are still   wearing their masks?&quot; he inquired. 
  &quot;You couldn't pry 'em off with crowbars,&quot; said Peters, &quot;and Hawkins  is  shaving off his red whiskers in the engine-room. That bunch has  scared  'im stiff.&quot; 
  &quot;And how about you?&quot; 
  Peters laughed uneasily. &quot;I don't like the layout, Falkner. They're   too big, too fat an' rich! I shouldn't wonder if we'd tied up to the   eight richest men in the United States, mebby counting out the two   skinny ones&#8212;and that's dangerous!&quot; 
  &quot;Tell Clarkson and McGraw to leave the bunch and lock the door,&quot;  said  Falkner. &quot;I don't believe they need a guard.&quot; 
  With early dawn the Silver Fox was running close in to a wild and   forest-covered shore, and just as the sun appeared above the   wilderness the yacht began picking her way slowly through a maze of   black reefs and small islands until at last she ran into a small cove   completely shut in by a rocky ridge and a thick forest of spruce and   balsam. Between the water and the forest was a white strip of sandy   beach a hundred yards in width. Falkner pointed this out to Peters and   Findy, who stood beside him. 
  &quot;Pitch your tents there,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll give our prisoners  absolute  freedom ashore. They can't get away. There isn't a settlement  within  thirty miles and I don't believe any one of them could make his  way  for five hundred yards through those rocks. They're as safe as if  in a  jail. Land all the provisions and after you've done that make  ready to  sail.&quot; 
  While the mate set about to carry out his instructions Falkner went  to  Miss Winn's cabin. The girl gave a little gesture of surprise and   pleasure when she saw him. &quot;I'm so glad you weren't badly hurt,&quot; she   wrote for him; and then, as she looked up with the witchery of her   wonderful smile and saw the unchanged seriousness of his face, her own   became suddenly quiet and questioning. A little frightened by what she   saw, she put out her hand and rested it on his arm. 
  &quot;I have come to say good-bye, Miss Winn,&quot; he said, struggling to  speak  calmly. &quot;Within half an hour the Silver Fox will be under way  for  Duluth, with her whole crew on board, except myself. You must go  with  her.&quot; 
  A sudden blue fire shot into the girl's eyes. She wrote rapidly in  her  little book: &quot;Yes, I must return to Duluth with the yacht. But why  are  you remaining behind&#8212;alone?&quot; 
  &quot;Because I refuse to imperil for a moment longer the lives of my  men,&quot;  he replied, and the hard ring in his voice sent her back a step,   staring at him. &quot;I shall carry out my contract&#8212;not with your father,   but with you,&quot; he continued. &quot;I shall remain with the prisoners.   Within a few hours two revenue cutters and a dozen tugs and swift   yachts will be scouring Superior and searching the shores for the   criminal who boarded the Uranus. If we are discovered&#8212;&quot; He shrugged   his shoulders. &quot;If we are&#8212;I will take the punishment alone.&quot; 
  She stood looking at him still, but in her eyes there came a  glorious  change. A flood of colour rose into her cheeks. She wrote  again and  gave him the slip of paper. &quot;You are the bravest man in the  world!&quot;  she said to him. &quot;If they find you I shall come to you&#8212;and  confess my  part. And you&#8212;when you are done here&#8212;will you come to see  me at my  home?&quot; 
  He looked at her and for a moment dared not speak. She put her two   hands on his arm and looked up into his face. &quot;You really&#8212;want me to   come?&quot; he asked softly. 
  She nodded. Her red lips pouted, &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;I'll come,&quot; he said. &quot;Good-bye, Miss Winn&#8212;Gladys&#8212;&quot; She  seemed  to come a little nearer to him and suddenly he bent down and  kissed  the beautiful, tremulous mouth so temptingly close; and then,  with his  brain reeling, he stepped back through the open doorway of  the cabin. 
  The prisoners were already ashore; tents were going up in the shade  of  the forest and the supplies were being rushed from the cook's  pantry;  but Falkner paid little attention to these things as he  stepped across  the long planks that were laid from the yacht's deck to  a big rock  ashore. He realized that at the last moment he had  surrendered to his  baser self. His kiss was an insult to Miss Winn. In  the shelter of a  rock he drew pencil and paper from his pocket and  wrote: &quot;Can you  forgive me for what I have done? Can you still believe  me to be brave  and honourable? If you can, God bless you! There is  only one excuse  for what I did&#8212;I love you!&quot; 
  He called Peters and asked him to deliver the note. Then, pulling  his  mask low over his eyes, he walked back to the rocky ridge. He did  not  catch another glimpse of Miss Winn; and as the last tent went up  and  the last box of supplies was carried ashore his heart sank dead  within  him. The girl had refused to pardon him for his insult. He went  down  to the shore, shook hands with the men of his crew and gave  Peters his  final instructions. 
  &quot;Lay up the Silver Fox at Duluth,&quot; he said; &quot;charter a tug with the   check I've given you and join the big search that will be made for the   kidnapped passengers. Be sure and get a new crew&#8212;two men will put   back into this cove. If we're not discovered before then no one will   suspect the game we're playing. I'll disappear back into the woods and   you can make some sort of pursuit if you want to. See the point?   You'll be the lucky rescuers.&quot; 
  Peters hurried aboard and Falkner stood watching the yacht as she  got  under way. She was just passing the mouth of the cove when the  mate  appeared from behind Miss Winn's cabin and launched a heavy  object  through the air. 
  &quot;Hi, Cap'n; that's for you!&quot; he yelled. 
  It fell close to Falkner&#8212;a dainty linen handkerchief tied about   something heavy. As he untied it a stone fell to the beach and a piece   of paper trembled between his fingers. A glad cry broke from his lips   as he read what the girl had written: &quot;I cannot understand your note.   Forgive you! I wanted you to kiss me. I guess I was to blame&#8212;if there   is any blame&#8212;for I think you are the bravest man in the world!   Besides, I got even with you&#8212;when they brought you in and I thought   you were dead! I don't believe you will ever want to see me again, for   I have deceived you terribly. I am not dumb, as you suppose. It was   only a trick&#8212;almost a contemptible one, I am afraid&#8212;to keep you from   questioning me too much; but if you should care, please come and see   me when you get rid of those troublesome prisoners. Then&#8212;then perhaps   I can make you understand!&quot; 
  Trembling with joy&#8212;a happiness greater than that of any dream he  had  ever dreamed&#8212;Falkner stared after the yacht until she disappeared   beyond the island; then, reading the note again, he turned back to the   prisoners. They made a funny spectacle, for Peters had followed his   instructions and each of the eight men stood with his hands securely   bound behind him and his eyes blindfolded. It was Falkner's plan to   give all his prisoners the use of their vision, but to free only two   or three of them at a time, so that they could not make a combined   rush upon him. He had scarcely released the enormously fat man,   however, before the latter thrust out a hand and, with a good-humoured   laugh, said: &quot;If you're out for ransom, old man, you've won. You've   done a mighty slick job&#8212;so deuced slick that we've agreed not to   squeal on you. You might as well pull that rag from your eyes, because   we know who you are. You're Captain Jim Falkner and your boat's the   Silver Fox. You dropped this and I picked it up.&quot; 
  He handed Falkner a slip of paper. It was the note which Gladys  Winn  had given him in her father's office nearly a month before, on  the  back of which she had written: &quot;Captain Jim Falkner, Pirate.&quot; 
  A cold chill ran up Falkner's spine. Then he laughed and gripped  the  fat man's hand. &quot;You're right!&quot; he said. &quot;I might as well take  this  thing off. And I'm not so very sorry. It tickles my nose&quot; 
  Twenty-four hours after the bold hold&#8212;up of the freighter Uranus   every newspaper wire in the United States was hot with the news.   Nothing more sensational had come into the hands of the editors since   the blowing up of the Maine. At first the reported facts were accepted   with a great deal of care by the more cautious. It was scarcely   believable that a piratical crew, armed with bludgeons and automatics,   had actually boarded a lake ship and by force of those arms had   carried off her passengers. Managing editors smiled as they printed   the first stories, but smiles quickly changed to looks of   astonishment, and even horror. The thing had really happened. As the   details came in, &quot;extras&quot; with glaring headlines were printed by the   million throughout the country. Three American and two Canadian   warships rushed to the scene of the piracy; and the authorities of   both Governments were instructed to fit out armed yachts and tugs   along both shores. 
  On the second day, the larger newspapers came out with full-page   headlines covering columns of type and pictures. In the first rush,   photographs of the Uranus and her captain and pictures of her crew   brought from ten to twenty-five dollars each, while the pictures of   the eight abducted men appeared in almost every issue. With these   there were thrilling portrayals in pen and ink and crayon, covering   half-pages, showing the masked boarders leaping over the side, the   struggle with the crew, the terrific fight between Captain Dix and   McGraw, imaginary struggles between the passengers and the invaders of   their cabins, and every other scene that could be worked out to fit   the situation by hungry editors and artists. 
  Who were the daring pirates? Where were they? What had become of  their  prisoners? These and a thousand other questions were asked by  the  newspapers, in business offices, over clicking typewriters, at   breakfast tables&#8212;even by the children in the schools. Not one of them   could be answered. Each day added to the mystery; and as the mystery   grew deeper and more thrilling the newspapers devoted still more space   to it, many of them sending their own correspondents to join in the   search for the pirates. War between the two greatest nations in Europe   could not have created a bigger sensation. 
  Falkner, hidden away in a wilderness cove, behind another  wilderness  of reefs and islands, guessed what was happening. For a few  hours  after the discovery that his identity was known to his prisoners  he  felt as though the gates of doom were already opening for him. He   could see no escape. There was but one chance, and that was in flight.   It was possible for him to strike straight northward into the   wilderness and to lose himself for ever, but this left his crew to   face their terrible penalty alone; for now that he and his vessel were   known, the men who had accompanied him on the desperate expedition   could be easily traced. So he discarded the thought of personal   escape. In spite of what seemed to be the utter hopelessness of his   own situation he could not help being deeply interested in the strange   deportment of his prisoners. At first he attempted to hold aloof from   them, but the fat man and his associates would not stand for this. 
  &quot;No matter if you are a bloody pirate,&quot; said the fat man, &quot;you've  got  to join us and play rum.&quot; 
  Every hour added to the mystery of the situation and to Falkner's   uneasiness. He was astonished at the contents of the boxes which Winn   had sent aboard the Silver Fox at Duluth. They contained everything in   the way of delicacies and solid luxuries, from potted lobster and pate   de foie gras to dill pickles and Limburger cheese. There was one case   of wine and several of good old-fashioned lager, and it occupied the   time of at least two members of the kidnapped band to cool the   beverages in the chill water of Superior. Not for an instant was there   a flash of ill-humour in the crowd. The six fat and well-fed men and   their two lean companions seemed bent on making a holiday lark out of   their unusual predicament, and from morning until night the luckless   Falkner was a mark for a thousand questions and the butt of   innumerable jokes. How long was he going to hide them in the jungle?   Why didn't he demand his ransom? What would happen to him when he was   caught? Would he be hanged, shot or electrocuted? At least six times a   day the fat man described some new and blood-curdling feature of the   execution he had witnessed. 
  At last he was forced, through lack of further material, to come  down  to the curious wiggling of the victim's toes; and he asked  Falkner, in  all seriousness, if he thought he would wiggle his. Would  he rather be  shot, hanged or killed by electricity&#8212;or wasn't a pirate  given his  choice? He assured him in all friendliness, both for himself  and his  associates, that they would all be on hand to see his last  wiggle,  whichever way he went. On the fifth day the fat man said that  he and  his friends were willing to pay a thousand dollars apiece for  their  freedom. He said they had enjoyed the little picnic thus far,  but that  the lager was gone and they were growing tired of it. He  offered  Falkner a check for eight thousand dollars. Falkner refused  it. 
  It was on the sixth day that matters came to a climax. During the   night preceding, a big and hungry bear wandered down from the rocky   fastness of the hinterland and helped himself to the camp supplies. He   left footprints behind him as big as a hat; and no sooner were these   discovered than the eight prisoners took up the pursuit, with the hope   of catching a glimpse of the beast a short distance from the camp.   Falkner followed close behind the rear-most, a short, pudgy man with a   rosy face and long ash-grey hair that fell almost to his shoulders.   The pursuers were hurrying between a narrow break in the rocks, the   fat man leading, when a balsam limb swept back, entangled itself in   the pudgy man's hair, lifted a wig from his head and sent it flying   through the air like a bird on the wing. The man gave a startled cry   as he faced Falkner. What came from between Falkner's lips was not   intelligible. Before the other could speak he leaped at his throat and   bore him down on the rocky trail. There was the threatening glare of   an animal in Falkner's eye as he almost snarled down into his victim's   whitened face. 
  For that face was the face of J. Cortlandt Winn, the millionaire  ship-  owner! 
  After a few moments Falkner loosened his fingers and lifted part of   his weight from the other's prostrate body. With his first glimpse of   Winn's face it had rushed upon him that his disguised employer was at   the bottom of some diabolical plot, for which he was to pay the   penalty; and now as he heard returning voices he pulled out his   automatic and pressed the cold muzzle of it hard down against Winn's   forehead. 
  &quot;Get up!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Get up&#8212;and remember that this isn't  loaded  with blank cartridges now. Come on! You've got to go with me!&quot;  He  pulled Winn into the thick undergrowth and did not stop until the  two  were a hundred yards back in the forest. To his astonishment the  ship-  owner smiled at him. &quot;Falkner&#8212;congratulations, old man. You're  a  brick!&quot; 
  &quot;We're going to have explanations now or I'll bore ten holes  through  you!&quot; said Falkner. 
  &quot;Sure!&quot; said Winn, regaining his breath. He looked admiringly at   Falkner, while he rubbed the red marks on his own neck; and with that   look it suddenly dawned upon Falkner that he was the father of the   girl he loved. &quot;What a dad-blinked, son-of-a-gun of a man you are,   Falkner! I wish you were my son&#8212;honest I do! See here!&quot; He fumbled in   his pocket and drew out a big black wallet. &quot;Here's your check for the   fifteen thousand. It's all turned out gloriously. I had planned to   explain the first day ashore, and wanted to; but the others wouldn't   let me&#8212;said you might queer the game if you knew too soon. By the   way, Jim&quot;&#8212;he chuckled as he spoke Falkner's name&#8212;&quot;can you guess whom   you've kidnapped?&quot; 
  Falkner stared. The beginning of the dawning of a great  understanding  held him speechless. 
  &quot;I'm tied,&quot; said Winn, &quot;and half choked to death. Good Lord, how  you  can pinch! Here&#8212;have a cigar.&quot; He paused to light one of his big   cigars. &quot;Well, to begin with,&quot; he continued, &quot;the ship which you   boarded was mine.&quot; 
  &quot;Yours!&quot; gasped Falkner, chewing his unlighted cigar. 
  &quot;Yes, mine,&quot; went on Winn, smiling and mopping his red face, &quot;and  when  you boarded that ship and captured my friends and myself you  captured  every blessed member of the board of directors of the  one-and-only  Sanspareil Biscuit Company. You took us off the map. And  you did away  with us just at the psychological moment. We knew you  were coming. We  were waiting to be kidnapped. It was our salvation!&quot; 
  He stopped, and Falkner's eagerness blazed in his face. &quot;It was a  put-  up game, then!&quot; he cried. &quot;But I don't understand it. Go on.&quot; 
  &quot;It's simple,&quot; continued Winn. &quot;Gladys has an imaginative turn of   mind. She thought the scheme out and then turned it over to me. You   see, the Sanspareil Biscuit is the best biscuit on earth, but in   running up against competition it ran up against what began to look   like death for it. It wasn't allowed to go on its merits and we   couldn't advertise it enough to beat our competitor. It looked like   bankruptcy. But now&#8212;now, my boy!&#8212;why, can't you guess what every   newspaper in America has been doing for a week? Think of it! The   entire board of directors of the Sanspareil Biscuit Company kidnapped   by pirates and perhaps murdered! There isn't a six-year-old child in   the United States to-day&#8212;Dutch, Irish, Chinese or Hunk, but who's   heard of Sanspareil Biscuit! The Sanspareil Biscuit is a household   phrase from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It's in everybody's mouth,   literally and orally. We've had a billion dollars' worth of free   advertising, and we'll get another billion's worth when we turn up and   tell 'em we can give no explanation for the kidnapping. This has been   the biggest advertising coup of any century since the night Nero   burned Rome! We won't be able to make enough Sanspareil biscuits.   Everybody will want to eat 'em if for nothing more than curiosity&#8212;and   once they taste 'em they'll never buy any other. Do you understand,   Jim, my boy? If the truth ever leaks out&#8212;and there isn't one chance   in a hundred that it will&#8212;we're all here to swear that the whole   thing was a joke to create a little excitement. It was my ship, my   board of directors&#8212;and my treat!&quot; 
  Four days later a black and ugly tug nosed her way into the cove a   little before sunset. The next morning she landed a hatless, coatless   and generally dishevelled lot of passengers at Sault Sainte Marie. At   nine o'clock Falkner sent the following telegram to Gladys Winn: 
  &quot;All O.K.! Am on my way to see you. You're a brick! But you've got  a  big debt to pay. James Falkner.&quot;
