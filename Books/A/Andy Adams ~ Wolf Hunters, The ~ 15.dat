  They traveled more slowly now and Rod found his strength returning.  When they reached the second ridge he took Mukoki by the arm and  assisted him up, and the old Indian made no demur. This spoke more  strongly of his hurt than words. There was still no sign of their  enemies behind. From the top of the second ridge they could look back  upon a quarter of a mile of the valley below, and it was here that Rod  suggested that he remain on watch for a few minutes while Wabigoon went  on with Mukoki. The young hunters could see that the Indian was  becoming weaker at every step, and Mukoki could no longer conceal this  weakness in spite of the tremendous efforts he made to appear natural.
  &#8220;I believe it is bad,&#8221; whispered Wabi to Rod, his face strangely  white. &#8220;I believe it is worse than we think. He is bleeding hard. Your  idea is a good one. Watch here, and if the Woongas show up in the  valley open fire on them. I'll leave you my gun, too, so they'll think  we are going to give them another fight. That will keep them back for a  time. I'm going to stop Muky up here a little way and dress his wound.  He will bleed to death if I don't.&#8221;
  &#8220;And then go on,&#8221; added Rod. &#8220;Don't stop if you hear me fire, but  hurry on to the chasm. I know the way and will join you. I'm as strong  as I ever was now, and can catch up with you easily with Mukoki  traveling as slowly as he does.&#8221;
  During this brief conversation Mukoki had continued his way along  the ridge and Wabi hurried to overtake him. Meanwhile Rod concealed  himself behind a rock, from which vantage-point he could see the whole  of that part of the valley across which they had come.
  He looked at his watch and in tense anxiety counted every minute  after that. He allowed ten minutes for the dressing of Mukoki's wound.  Every second gained from then on would be priceless. For a quarter of  an hour he kept his eyes with ceaseless vigilance upon their back  trail. Surely the Woongas had secured their snow-shoes by this time!  Was it possible that they had given up the pursuit&#8212;that their terrible  experience in the dip had made them afraid of further battle? Rod  answered this question in the negative. He was sure that the Woongas  knew that Wabi was the son of the factor of Wabinosh House. Therefore  they would make every effort to recapture him, even though they had to  follow far and a dozen lives were lost before that feat was  accomplished.
  A movement in the snow across the valley caught Rod's eyes. He  straightened himself, and his breath came quickly. Two figures had  appeared in the open. Another followed close behind, and after that  there came others, until the waiting youth had counted sixteen. They  were all on snow-shoes, following swiftly over the trail of the  fugitives.
  The young hunter looked at his watch again. Twenty-five minutes had  passed. Mukoki and Wabigoon had secured a good start. If he could only  hold the outlaws in the valley for a quarter of an hour more&#8212;just  fifteen short minutes&#8212;they would almost have reached the entrance into  the chasm.
  Alone, with his own life and those of his comrades depending upon  him, the boy was cool. There was no tremble in his hands to destroy the  accuracy of his rifle-fire, no blurring excitement or fear in his brain  to trouble his judgment of distance and range. He made up his mind that  he would not fire until they had come within four hundred yards.  Between that distance and three hundred he was sure he could drop at  least one or two of them.
  He measured his range by a jackpine stub, and when two of the  Woongas had reached and passed that stub he fired. He saw the snow  thrown up six feet in front of the leader. He fired again, and again,  and one of the shots, a little high, struck the second outlaw. The  leader had darted back to the shelter of the stub and Rod sent another  bullet whizzing past his ears. His fifth he turned into the main body  of the pursuers, and then, catching up Wabi's rifle, he poured a hail  of five bullets among them in as many seconds.
  The effect was instantaneous. The outlaws scattered in retreat and  Rod saw that a second figure was lying motionless in the snow. He began  to reload his rifles and by the time he had finished the Woongas had  separated and were running to the right and the left of him. For the  last time he looked at his watch. Wabi and Mukoki had been gone  thirty-five minutes.
  The boy crept back from his rock, straightened himself, and followed  in their trail. He mentally calculated that it would be ten minutes  before the Woongas, coming up from the sides and rear, would discover  his flight, and by that time he would have nearly a mile the start of  them. He saw, without stopping, where Wabi had dressed Mukoki's wound.  There were spots of blood and a red rag upon the snow. Half a mile  farther on the two had paused again, and this time he knew that Mukoki  had stopped to rest. From now on they had rested every quarter of a  mile or so, and soon Roderick saw them toiling slowly through the snow  ahead of him.
  He ran up, panting, anxious.
  &#8220;How&#8212;&#8221; he began.
  Wabi looked at him grimly.
  &#8220;How much farther, Rod?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Not more than half a mile.&#8221;
  Wabi motioned for him to take Mukoki's other arm.
  &#8220;He has bled a good deal,&#8221; he said. There was a hardness in his  voice that made Rod shudder, and he caught his breath as Wabi shot him  a meaning glance behind the old warrior's doubled shoulders.
  They went faster now, almost carrying their wounded comrade between  them. Suddenly, Wabi paused, threw his rifle to his shoulder, and  fired. A few yards ahead a huge white rabbit kicked in his death  struggles in the snow.
  &#8220;If we do reach the chasm Mukoki must have something to eat,&#8221; he  said.
  &#8220;We'll reach it!&#8221; gasped Rod. &#8220;We'll reach it! There's the woods. We  go down there!&#8221;
  They almost ran, with Mukoki's snow-shod feet dragging between them,  and five minutes later they were carrying the half-unconscious Indian  down the steep side of the mountain. At its foot Wabi turned, and his  eyes flashed with vengeful hatred.
  &#8220;Now, you devils!&#8221; he shouted up defiantly. &#8220;Now!&#8221;
  Mukoki aroused himself for a few moments and Rod helped him back to  the shelter of the chasm wall. He found a nook between great masses of  rock, almost clear of snow, and left him there while he hurried back to  Wabigoon.
  &#8220;You stand on guard here, Rod,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;We must cook that  rabbit and get some life back into Mukoki. I think he has stopped  bleeding, but I am going to look again. The wound isn't fatal, but it  has weakened him. If we can get something hot into him I believe he  will be able to walk again. Did you have anything left over from your  dinner on the trail to-day?&#8221;
  Rod unstrapped the small pack in which the hunters carried their  food while on the trail, and which had been upon his shoulders since  noon.
  &#8220;There is a double handful of coffee, a cupful of tea, plenty of  salt and a little bread,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Good! Few enough supplies for three people in this kind of a  wilderness&#8212;but they'll save Mukoki!&#8221;
  Wabi went back, while Rod, sheltered behind a rock, watched the  narrow incline into the chasm. He almost hoped the Woongas would dare  to attempt a descent, for he was sure that he and Wabi would have them  at a terrible disadvantage and with their revolvers and three rifles  could inflict a decisive blow upon them before they reached the bottom.  But he saw no sign of their enemies. He heard no sound from above, yet  he knew that the outlaws were very near&#8212;only waiting for the  protecting darkness of night.
  He heard the crackling of Wabi's fire and the odor of coffee came to  him; and Wabi, assured that their presence was known to the Woongas,  began whistling cheerily. In a few minutes he rejoined Rod behind the  rock.
  &#8220;They will attack us as soon as it gets good and dark,&#8221; he said  coolly. &#8220;That is, if they can find us. As soon as they are no longer  able to see down into the chasm we will find some kind of a  hiding-place. Mukoki will be able to travel then.&#8221;
  A memory of the cleft in the chasm wall came to Rod and he quickly  described it to his companion. It was an ideal hiding-place at night,  and if Mukoki was strong enough they could steal up out of the chasm  and secure a long start into the south before the Woongas discovered  their flight in the morning. There was just one chance of failure. If  the spy whose trail had revealed the break in the mountain to Rod was  not among the outlaws' wounded or dead the cleft might be guarded, or  the Woongas themselves might employ it in making a descent upon them.
  &#8220;It's worth the risk anyway,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;The chances are even that  your outlaw ran across the fissure by accident and that his companions  are not aware of its existence. And they'll not follow our trail down  the chasm to-night, I'll wager. In the cover of darkness they will  steal down among the rocks and then wait for daylight. Meanwhile we can  be traveling southward and when they catch up with us we will give them  another fight if they want it.&#8221;
  &#8220;We can start pretty soon?&#8221;
  &#8220;Within an hour.&#8221;
  For some time the two stood in silent watchfulness. Suddenly Rod  asked:
  &#8220;Where is Wolf?&#8221;
  Wabi laughed, softly, exultantly.
  &#8220;Gone back to his people, Rod. He will be crying in the wild  hunt-pack to-night. Good old Wolf!&#8221; The laugh left his lips and there  was a tremble of regret in his voice. &#8220;The Woongas came from the back  of the cabin&#8212;took me by surprise&#8212;and we had it hot and heavy for a  few minutes. We fell back where Wolf was tied and just as I knew they'd  got me sure I cut his babeesh with the knife I had in my hand.&#8221;
  &#8220;Didn't he show fight?&#8221;
  &#8220;For a minute. Then one of the Indians shot, at him and he hiked off  into the woods.&#8221;
  &#8220;Queer they didn't wait for Mukoki and me,&#8221; mused Rod. &#8220;Why didn't  they ambush us?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because they didn't want you, and they were sure they'd reach their  camp before you took up the trail. I was their prize. With me in their  power they figured on communicating with you and Mukoki and sending you  back to the Post with their terms. They would have bled father to his  last cent&#8212;and then killed me. Oh, they talked pretty plainly to me  when they thought they had me!&#8221;
  There came a noise from above them and the young hunters held their  rifles in readiness. Nearer and nearer came the crashing sound, until a  small boulder shot past them into the chasm.
  &#8220;They're up there,&#8221; grinned Wabi, lowering his gun. &#8220;That was an  accident, but you'd better keep your eyes open. I'll bet the whole  tribe feel like murdering the fellow who rolled over that stone!&#8221;
  He crept cautiously back to Mukoki, and Rod crouched with his face  to the narrow trail leading down from the top of the mountain. Deep  shadows were beginning to lurk among the trees and he was determined  that any movement there would draw his fire. Fifteen minutes later Wabi  returned, eating ravenously at a big hind quarter of broiled rabbit.
  &#8220;I've had my coffee,&#8221; he greeted. &#8220;Go back and eat and drink, and  build the fire up high. Don't mind me when I shoot. I am going to fire  just to let the Woongas know we are on guard, and after that we'll  hustle for that break in the mountain.&#8221;
  Rod found Mukoki with a chunk of rabbit in one hand and a cup of  coffee in the other. The wounded Indian smiled with something like the  old light in his eyes and a mighty load was lifted from Rod's heart.
  &#8220;You're better?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Fine!&#8221; replied Mukoki. &#8220;No much hurt. Good fight some more. Wabi  say, 'No, you stay.'&#8220; His face became a map of grimaces to show his  disapproval of Wabi's command.
  Rod helped himself to the meat and coffee. He was hungry, but after  he was done there remained some of the rabbit and a biscuit and these  he placed in his pack for further use. Soon after this there came two  shots from the rock and before the echoes had died away down the chasm  Wabi approached through the gathering gloom.
  It was easy for the hunters to steal along the concealment of the  mountain wall, and even if there had been prying eyes on the opposite  ridge they could not have penetrated the thickening darkness in the  bottom of the gulch. For some time the flight was continued with  extreme caution, no sound being made to arouse the suspicion of any  outlaw who might be patrolling the edge of the precipice. At the end of  half an hour Mukoki, who was in the lead that he might set a pace  according to his strength, quickened his steps. Rod was close beside  him now, his eyes ceaselessly searching the chasm wall for signs that  would tell him when they were nearing the rift. Suddenly Wabi halted in  his tracks and gave a low hiss that stopped them.
  &#8220;It's snowing!&#8221; he whispered.
  Mukoki lifted his face. Great solitary flakes of snow fell upon it.
  &#8220;She snow hard&#8212;soon. Mebby cover snow-shoe trails!&#8221;
  &#8220;And if it does&#8212;we're safe!&#8221; There was a vibrant joy in Wabi's  voice.
  For a full minute Mukoki held his face to the sky.
  &#8220;Hear small wind over chasm,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;She come from south. She snow hard&#8212;now&#8212;up there!&#8221;
  They went on, stirred by new hope. Rod could feel that the flakes  were coming thicker. The three now kept close to the chasm wall in  their search for the rift. How changed all things were at night! Rod's  heart throbbed now with hope, now with doubt, now with actual fear. Was  it possible that he could not find it? Had they passed it among some of  the black shadows behind? He saw no rock that he recognized, no  overhanging crag, no sign to guide him. He stopped, and his voice  betrayed his uneasiness as he asked:
  &#8220;How far do you think we have come?&#8221;
  Mukoki had gone a few steps ahead, and before Wabi answered he  called softly to them from close up against the chasm wall. They  hurried to him and found him standing beside the rift.
  &#8220;Here!&#8221;
  Wabi handed his rifle to Rod.
  &#8220;I'm going up first,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;If the coast is clear I'll  whistle down.&#8221;
  For a few moments Mukoki and Rod could hear him as he crawled up the  fissure. Then all was silent. A quarter of an hour passed, and a low  whistle came to their ears. Another ten minutes and the three stood  together at the top of the mountain, Rod and the wounded Mukoki  breathing hard from their exertions.
  For a time the three sat down in the snow and waited, watched,  listened; and from Rod's heart there went up something that was almost  a prayer, for it was snowing&#8212;snowing hard, and it seemed to him that  the storm was something which God had specially directed should fall in  their path that it might shield them and bring them safely home.
  And when he rose to his feet Wabi was still silent, and the three  gripped hands in mute thankfulness at their deliverance.
  Still speechless, they turned instinctively for a moment back to the  dark desolation beyond the chasm&#8212;the great, white wilderness in which  they had passed so many adventurous yet happy weeks; and as they gazed  into the chaos beyond the second mountain there came to them the  lonely, wailing howl of a wolf.
  &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Wabi softly. &#8220;I wonder&#8212;if that&#8212;is Wolf?&#8221;
  And then, Indian file, they trailed into the south.
