  Jan had aged five years during those two hours in the office of the   sub-commissioner; he aged now as Thornton looked at him. There came   the same tired, hopeless glow into his eyes, the same tense lines in   his face. And yet, quickly, he changed as he had not changed on that   afternoon. Two livid spots began to burn in his cheeks as he sat down   opposite Thornton. He turned the light low, and his eyes glowed more   darkly and with an animal-like luster in the half gloom. Something in   him now, a quivering, struggling passion that lay behind those eyes,   held Thornton white and silent. 
  &quot;M'sieur,&quot; he began in the low voice which Thornton was beginning  to  understand, &quot;I am going to tell you something which I have told to  but  two other human beings. It is the story of another man&#8212;a man from   civilization, like you, who came up into this country of ours years   and years ago, and who met a woman, as you have met this girl at   Oxford House, and who loved her as you love this one, and perhaps   more. It is singular that the case should be so similar, m'sieur, and   it is because of this that I believe Our Blessed Lady gives me courage   to tell it to you. For this man, like you, left a wife&#8212;and two   children&#8212;when he came into the North. M'sieur, I pray the Great God   to forgive him, for he left a third child&#8212;unborn.&quot; 
  Jan leaned upon his hand so that it shaded his face. 
  &quot;It is not so much of THAT as of what followed that I am going to  tell  you, m'sieur,&quot; he went on. &quot;It was a beautiful love&#8212;on the  woman's  part, and it would have been a beautiful love on the man's  part if it  had been pure. For her he gave up everything, even his  God&#8212;as you  would give up everything&#8212;and your God&#8212;for this girl at  Oxford House.  M'sieur, I will speak mostly of the woman now. She was  beautiful. She  was one of the three most beautiful things that God  ever placed in our  world, and she loved this man. She married him,  believed in him, was  ready to die for him, to follow him to the ends  of the earth, as our  women will do for the men they love. God in  Heaven, can you not guess  what happened, m'sieur? A CHILD WAS BORN!&quot; 
  So fiercely did Jan cry out the words that Thornton jerked back as   though a blow had been struck at him from out of the gloom. 
  &quot;A child was born!&quot; repeated Jan, and Thornton heard his nails  digging  in the table. &quot;That was the first curse of God&#8212;a child! La  Charogne&#8212;  les b&ecirc;tes de charogne&#8212;that is what we call them&#8212;beasts of  carrion  and carrion eaters, breeders of devils and sin! Mon Dieu, that  is what  happened! A child was born, with the curse of God upon him!&quot; 
  Jan stopped, his nails digging deeper, his breath escaping from him  as  though he had been running. 
  &quot;Down in YOUR world he would have grown up a MAN,&quot; he continued,   speaking more calmly. &quot;I have heard that&#8212;since. It is common down   there to be a two-legged carrion&#8212;a man or a woman born out of   wedlock. I have been told so, and that it is a curse not without hope.   But here it is different. The curse never dies. It follows, day after   day, year after year. And this child&#8212;more unfortunate than the wild   things, was born one of them. Do you understand, m'sieur? If the winds   had whispered the secret nothing would have come near him&#8212;the Indian   women would sooner have touched the plague&#8212;he would have been an   outcast, despised as he grew older, pointed at and taunted, called   names which are worse than those called to the lowest and meanest   dogs. THAT is what it means to be born under that curse&#8212;up here.&quot; 
  He waited for Thornton to speak, but the other sat silent and  moveless  across the table. 
  &quot;The curse worked swiftly, m'sieur. It came first&#8212;in remorse&#8212;to  the  man. It gnawed at his soul, ate him alive, and drove him from  place to  place with the woman and the child. The purity and love of  the woman  added to his suffering, and at last he came to know that the  hand of  God had fallen upon his head. The woman saw his grief but did  not know  the reason for it. And so the curse first came to her. They  went  north&#8212;far north, above the Barren Lands, and the curse followed   there. It gnawed at his life until&#8212;he died. That was seven years   after the child was born.&quot; 
  The oil lamp sputtered and began to smoke, and with a quick  movement  Jan turned the wick down until they were left in darkness. 
  &quot;M'sieur, it was then that the curse began to fall upon the woman  and  the child. Do you not believe that about the sins of the fathers   falling upon others? Mon Dieu, it is so&#8212;it is so. It came in many   small ways&#8212;and then&#8212;the curse&#8212;it came suddenly&#8212;LIKE THIS.&quot; Jan's   voice came in a hissing whisper now. Thornton could feel his hot   breath as he leaned over the table, and in the darkness Jan's eyes   shone like two coals of fire. &quot;It came like THIS!&quot; panted Jan. &quot;There   was a new missioner at the post&#8212;a&#8212;a Christian from the South, and he   was a great friend to the woman, and preached God, and she BELIEVED   him. The boy was very young, and saw things, but did not understand at   first. He knew, afterward, that the missioner loved his mother's   beauty, and that he tried hard to win it&#8212;and failed, for the woman,   until death, would love only the one to whom she had given herself   first. Great God, it happened THEN&#8212;one night when every soul was   about the big fires at the caribou roast, and there was no one near   the lonely little cabin where the boy and his mother lived. The boy   was at the feast, but he ran home&#8212;with a bit of dripping meat as a   gift for his mother&#8212;and he heard her cries, and ran in to be struck   down by the missioner. It happened THEN, and even the boy knew, and   followed the man, shrieking that he had killed his mother.&quot; There was   a terrible calmness now in Jan's voice. &quot;M'sieur, it was true. She   wasted away like a flower after that night. She died, and left the boy   alone with the curse. And that boy, m'sieur, was Jan Thoreau. The   woman was his mother.&quot; 
  There was silence now, a dead, pulseless quiet, broken after a  moment  by a movement. It was Thornton, groping across the table. Jan  felt his  hands touch his arm. They groped farther in the darkness,  until Jan  Thoreau's hands were clasped tightly in Thornton's. 
  &quot;And that&#8212;is all?&quot; he questioned hoarsely. 
  &quot;No, it is but the beginning,&quot; said Jan softly. &quot;The curse has   followed me, m'sieur, until I am the unhappiest man in the world. To-   day I have done all that is to be done. When my father died he left   papers which my mother was to give to me when I had attained manhood.   When she died they came to me. She knew nothing of that which was in   them, and I am glad. For they told the story that I have told to you,   m'sieur, and from his grave my father prayed to me to make what   restitution I could. When he came into the North for good he brought   with him most of his fortune&#8212;which was large, m'sieur&#8212;and placed it   where no one would ever find it&#8212;in the stock of the Great Company. A   half of it, he said, should be mine. The other half he asked me to   return to his children, and to his real wife, if she were living. I   have done more than that, m'sieur. I have given up all&#8212;for none of it   is mine. A half will go to the two children whom he deserted. The   other half will go to the child that was unborn. The mother&#8212;is&#8212;   dead.&quot; 
  After a time Thornton said, 
  &quot;There is more, Jan.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, there is more, m'sieur,&quot; said Jan. &quot;So much more that if I  were  to tell it to you it would not be hard for you to understand why  Jan  Thoreau is the unhappiest man in the world. I have told you that  this  is but the beginning. I have not told you of how the curse has   followed me and robbed me of all that is greatest in life&#8212;how it has   haunted me day and night, m'sieur, like a black spirit, destroying my   hopes, turning me at last into an outcast, without people, without   friends, without&#8212;that&#8212;which you, too, will give up in this girl at   Oxford House. M'sieur, am I right? You will not go back to her. You   will go south, and some day the Great God will reward you.&quot; 
  He heard Thornton rising in the dark. 
  &quot;Shall I strike a light, m'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Thornton close to him. In the gloom their hands met.  There  was a change in the other's voice now, something of pride, of  triumph,  of a glory just achieved. &quot;Jan,&quot; he said softly, &quot;I thank you  for  bringing me face to face with a God like yours. I have never met  Him  before. We send missionaries up to save you, we look upon you as  wild  and savage and with only half a soul&#8212;and we are blind. You have   taught me more than has ever been preached into me, and this great,   glorious world of yours is sending me back a better man for having   come into it. I am going&#8212;south. Some day I will return, and I will be   one of this world, and one of your people. I will come, and I will   bring no curse. If I could send this word to HER, ask her forgiveness,   tell her what I have almost been and that I still have hope&#8212;faith&#8212;I   could go easier down into that other world.&quot; 
  &quot;You can,&quot; said Jan. &quot;I will take this word for you, m'sieur, and I   will take more, for I will tell her what it has been the kind fate for   Jan Thoreau to find in the heart of M'sieur Thornton. She is one of my   people, and she will forgive, and love you more for what you have   done. For this, m'sieur, is what the Cree god has given to his people   as the honor of the great snows. She will still love you, and if there   is to be hope it will burn in HER breast, too. M'sieur&#8212;&quot; 
  Something like a sob broke through Thornton's lips as he moved back   through the darkness. 
  &quot;And you&#8212;I will find you again?&quot; 
  &quot;They will know where I go from Oxford House. I will leave  word&#8212;with  HER,&quot; said Jan. 
  &quot;Good-by,&quot; said Thornton huskily. 
  Jan listened until his footsteps had died away, and for a long time   after that he sat with his head buried in his arms upon the little   table. And Kazan, whining softly, seemed to know that in the darkened   room had come to pass the thing which broke at last his master's   overburdened heart.
