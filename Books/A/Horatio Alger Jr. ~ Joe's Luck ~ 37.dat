  At this time Joe and Joshua were occupying a tent which they had  purchased on favorable terms of a fellow miner.
  They retired in good season, for they wished to start early on their  journey on the following morning.
  &#8220;I don't know as I can go to sleep,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;I can't help  thinkin' of how rich I am, and what dad and all the folks will say.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean to go home at once, Mr. Bickford?&#8221;
  &#8220;Jest as soon as I can get ready. I'll tell you what I am goin' to  do, Joe. I'm goin' to buy a tip-top suit when I get to Boston, and a  gold watch and chain, and a breast-pin about as big as a saucer. When I  sail into Pumpkin Holler in that rig folks'll look at me, you bet.  There's old Squire Pennyroyal, he'll be disappointed for one.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why will he be disappointed?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because he told dad I was a fool to come out here. He said I'd be  back in rags before a year was out. Now, the old man thinks a good deal  of his opinion, and he won't like it to find how badly he's mistaken.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then he would prefer to see you come home in rags?&#8221;
  &#8220;You bet he would.&#8221;
  &#8220;How about Susan? Ain't you afraid she has married the store clerk?&#8221;
  Joshua looked grave for a moment.
  &#8220;I won't say but she has,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but if she has gone and  forgotten about me jest because my back is turned, she ain't the gal I  take her for, and I won't fret my gizzard about her.&#8221;
  &#8220;She will feel worse than you when she finds you have come back with  money.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's so.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you will easily find some one else,&#8221; suggested Joe.
  &#8220;There's Sophrony Thompson thinks a sight of me,&#8221; said Mr. Bickford.  &#8220;She's awful jealous of Susan. If Susan goes back on me, I'll call  round and see Sophrony.&#8221;
  Joe laughed.
  &#8220;I won't feel anxious about you, Joshua,&#8221; he said, &#8220;since I find you  have two girls to choose between.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not much danger of breakin' my heart. It's pretty tough.&#8221;
  There was a brief silence.
  Then Joshua said:
  &#8220;What are your plans, Joe? Shall you remain in San Francisco?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've been thinking, Mr. Bickford, that I would like to go home on a  visit. If I find that I have left my business in good hands in the  city, I shall feel strongly tempted to go home on the same steamer with  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;That would be hunky,&#8221; said Bickford, really delighted. &#8220;We'd have a  jolly time.&#8221;
  I think we would. But, Mr. Bickford, I have no girls to welcome me  home, as you have.&#8221;
  &#8220;You ain't old enough yet, Joe. You're a good-lookin' feller, and  when the time comes I guess you can find somebody.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't begin to trouble myself about such things yet,&#8221; said Joe,  laughing. &#8220;I am only sixteen.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've been through considerable, Joe, for a boy of sixteen. I wish  you'd come up to Pumpkin Holler and make me a visit when you're to  home.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps I can arrange to be present at your wedding, Mr.  Bickford&#8212;that is, if Susan doesn't make you wait too long.&#8221;
  While this conversation was going on the dark figure of a man was  prowling near the tent.
  &#8220;Why don't the fools stop talking and go to sleep,&#8221; muttered Hogan.  &#8220;I don't want to wait here all night.&#8221; His wish was gratified.
  The two friends ceased talking and lay quite still. Soon Joe's deep,  regular breathing and Bickford's snoring convinced the listener that  the time had come to carry out his plans.
  With stealthy step he approached the tent, and stooping over gently  removed the nugget from under Joshua's head. There was a bag of  gold-dust which escaped his notice. The nugget was all he thought of.
  With beating heart and hasty step the thief melted into the  darkness, and the two friends slept on unconscious of their loss.
