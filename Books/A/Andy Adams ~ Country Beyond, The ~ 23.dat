  Dawn came softly where the quiet waters of the Willow Bud ran   under deep forests of evergreen out into the gold and silver birch  of  the Nelson River flats. A veiling mist rose out of the earth to  meet  the promise of day, gentle and sweet, like scented raiment,  stirring  sleepily to the pulse of an awakening earth. Through it  came the first  low twitter of birdsong, a sound that seemed to  swell and grow until  it filled the world. Yet was it still a sound  of sleep, of half  wakefulness, and the mist was thinning away  when, a ruffled little  breast sent out its full throat-song from  the tip of a silver birch  that overhung the stream. 
  The little warbler was looking down, as if wondering why there was   no stir of life beneath him, where in last night's sunset there  had  been much to wonder at and a new kind of song to thrill him.  But the  girl was no longer there to sing back at him. The cedar  and balsam  shelter dripped with morning dew, the place where fire  had been was  black and dead, and ruffling his feathers the warbler  continued his  song in triumph. 
  Nada, hidden under her shelter, and still half dreaming, heard   him. She lay with her head nestled in the crook of Roger's arm,  and  the birdsong seemed to come to her from a great distance away.  She  smiled, and her lips trembled, as if even in sleep she&#8212;was  about to  answer it. And then the song drifted away until she could  no longer  hear it, and she sank back into an oblivion of darkness  in which she  seemed lost for a long time, and out of which some  invisible force was  struggling to drag her. 
  There came at last a sudden irresistible pull at her senses, and   she opened her eyes, awake. Her head was no longer in the crook of   Jolly Roger's arm. She could see him sitting up straight, and he  was  not looking at her. It must be late, she thought, for the  light was  strong in his face, warm with the first golden flow of  the sun. She  smiled, and sat up, and shook her soft curls with a  happy little  laugh. 
  &quot;Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  And then she, too, was staring, wide-eyed and speechless. For she   saw Peter under Jolly Roger's hand. But it was not Peter who drew  her  breath short and sent fear cutting like a sharp knife through  her  heart. 
  Facing them, seated coldly on a log which McKay had dragged in   from the timber, was a thin-faced sharp-eyed man who was studying   them with an odd smile on his lips, and instantly Nada knew this  man  was Breault. 
  There was something peculiarly appalling about him as he sat   there, in spite of the fact that for a few moments he neither  spoke  nor moved. His eyes, Nada thought, were not like human eyes,  and his  lips were like the blades of two knives set together. Yet  he was  smiling, or half smiling, not in a comforting or humorous  way, but  with exultation and triumph. From looking at him one  would never have  guessed that Breault loved his joke. 
  He nodded. 
  &quot;Good morning, Jolly Roger McKay! And&#8212;good morning, Mrs. Jolly   Roger McKay! Pardon me for watching you like this, but duty is  duty.  I am Breault, of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police.&quot; 
  McKay wet his lips. Breault saw him, and the grin on his thin face   widened. 
  &quot;I know, it's hard,&quot; he said. &quot;But you've got Peter to thank for   it. Peter led me to you.&quot; 
  He stood up, and in a most casual fashion covered Jolly Roger with   his automatic. 
  &quot;Would you mind stepping out, McKay?&quot; he asked. 
  In his other hand he dangled a pair of handcuffs. McKay stood up,   and Nada rose beside him, gripping his arms with both hands. 
  &quot;No need of those things, Breault,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll go peaceably.&quot; 
  &quot;Still&#8212;it's safer,&quot; argued Breault, a wicked glitter in his eyes.   &quot;Hold out one hand, please&#8212;&quot; 
  The manacle snapped over Jolly Roger's wrist. 
  &quot;I'm Breault&#8212;not Terence Cassidy,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Never take a   chance, you know. Never!&quot; 
  Swift as a flash was his movement then, as the companion bracelet   snapped over Nada's wrist. He stepped back, facing them with a  grin. 
  &quot;Got you both now, haven't I?&quot; he gloated. &quot;Can't get away, can   you?&quot; He put his gun away, and bowed low to Nada. &quot;How do you like   married life, Mrs. Jolly Roger?&quot; 
  McKay's face was whiter than Nada's. 
  &quot;You coward!&quot; he spoke in a low, quiet voice. &quot;You low-down   miserable coward. You're a disgrace to the Service. Do you mean  you  are going to keep my wife ironed like this?&quot; 
  &quot;Sure,&quot; said Breault. &quot;I'm going to make you pay for some of the   trouble I've had over you. I believe in a man paying his debts,  you  know. And a woman, too. And probably you've lied to her like  the very  devil.&quot; 
  &quot;He hasn't!&quot; protested Nada fiercely. &quot;You're a&#8212;a&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Say it,&quot; nodded Breault good humoredly. &quot;By all means say it,   Mrs. Jolly Roger. If you can't find words, let me help you,&quot; and   while he waited he loaded his pipe and lighted it. 
  &quot;You see I don't exactly live up to regulations when I'm with good   friends like you,&quot; he apologized cynically. &quot;In other words you're  a  couple of hard cases. Cassidy has turned in all sorts of  evidence  about you. He says that you, McKay, should be hung the  moment we catch  you. He warned me not to take a chance&#8212;that you'd  slit my throat in  the dark without a prick of conscience. And I'm  a valuable man in the  Service. It can't afford to lose me.&quot; 
  McKay shut his lips tightly, and did not answer. 
  &quot;Now, while you're helpless, I want to tell you a few things,&quot;   Breault went on. &quot;And while I'm talking I'll start the fire, so we   can have breakfast. Peter and, I are hungry. A good dog, McKay. He   saved us up on the Barren. Have you told Mrs. Jolly Roger about   that?&quot; 
  He expected no answer, and whistled as he lighted a pile of   birchbark which he had already placed under dry cedar wood which   McKay had gathered the preceding evening. 
  &quot;That's where MY trouble began&#8212;up there on the Barren, Mrs. Jolly   Roger,&quot; he continued, ignoring McKay. &quot;You see the three of us,   Superintendent Tavish, and Porter&#8212;who is now his son-in-law&#8212;and  I  had a splendid chance to die like martyrs, and go down forever  in the  history of the Service, if it hadn't been for this fool of  a husband  of yours, and Peter. I can't blame Peter, because he's  only a dog. But  McKay is responsible. He robbed us of a beautiful  opportunity of dying  in an unusual way by hunting us up and  dragging us into his shelter. A  shabby trick, don't you think? And  inasmuch as Superintendent Tavish  is about the biggest man in the  Service, and Porter is his son-in-law,  and Miss Tavish was saved  along with us&#8212;why, they reckoned something  ought to be done about  it.&quot; 
  Breault did not look up. With, exasperating slowness he added fuel   to the fire. 
  &quot;And so&#8212;&quot; 
  He rose and stood before them again. 
  &quot;And so&#8212;they assigned me to the very unpleasant duty of running   you down with a pardon, McKay&#8212;a pardon forgiving you for all your   sins, forever and ever, Amen. And here it is!&quot; 
  He had drawn an official-looking envelope from inside his coat,   and held it out now&#8212;not to McKay&#8212;but to Nada. 
  Neither reached for it. Standing there with the cynical smile   still on his lips, his strange eyes gimleting them with a cold  sort  of laughter, it was as if Breault tortured them with a last  horrible  joke. Then, suddenly, Nada seized the envelope and tore  it open, while  McKay stared at Breault, believing, and yet not  daring to speak. 
  It was Nada's cry, a cry wild and sobbing and filled with   gladness, that told him the truth, and with the precious paper   clutched in her hand she smothered her face against McKay's  breast,  while Breault came up grinning behind them, and Jolly  Roger heard the  click of his key in the handcuffs. 
  &quot;I am also loaded down with a number of foolish messages for you,&quot;   he said, attending to the fire again. &quot;For instance, that red-  headed  good-for-nothing, Cassidy, says to tell you he is building  a four-room  bungalow for you in their clearing, and that it will  be finished by  the time you arrive. Also, a squaw named Yellow  Bird, and a redskin  who calls himself Slim Buck, sent word that  you will always be welcome  in their hunting grounds. And a pretty  little thing named Sun Cloud  sent as many kisses as there are  leaves on the trees&#8212;&quot; 
  He paused, chuckling, and did not look up to see the wide,   glorious eyes of the girl upon him. 
  &quot;But the funniest thing of all is the baby,&quot; he went on, preparing   to slice bacon. &quot;They're going to have one pretty soon&#8212;Cassidy's   wife, I mean. They've given it a name already. If it's a boy it's   Roger&#8212;if it's a girl it's Nada. They wanted me to tell you that.   Silly bunch, aren't they? A couple of young fools&#8212;&quot; 
  Just then something new happened in the weirdly adventurous life   of Frangois Breault. Without warning he was suddenly smothered in  a  pair of arms, his head was jerked back, and against his hard and   pitiless mouth a pair of soft red lips pressed for a single  thrilling  instant. &quot;Well, I'll be damned,&quot; he gasped, dropping his  bacon and  staggering to his feet like a man who had been shot.  &quot;I'll  be&#8212;CUSSED!&quot; 
  And he picked up his pack and walked off into the thick young   spruce at the edge of the timber, without saying another word or  once  looking behind him. And breakfast waited, and Nada and Jolly  Roger and  Peter waited, but Frangois Breault did not return. For a  strange and  unaccountable man was he, a hard and pitiless man and  a deadly hunter  who knew no fear. Yet the wilderness swallowed  him, a coward at  last&#8212;running away from the two red lips that had  kissed him. 
  So went Breault, for the first time in his life a messenger of   mercy; and at the top of the silver birch the little warbler knew   that something glad had happened, and offered up its gratitude in  a  sudden burst of song. 
  THE END
