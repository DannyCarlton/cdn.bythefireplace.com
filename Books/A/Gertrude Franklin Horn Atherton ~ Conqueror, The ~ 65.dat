Jefferson had arrived on March 21st, and entered at once upon his duties  as Secretary of State. He disapproved of the assumption measure, but was  so absorbed in the perplexing details of his new office, in  correspondence, and in frequent conferences with the President on the  subject of foreign affairs, that he gave the matter little consecutive  thought. Moreover, he was dined every day for weeks, all the  distinguished New Yorkers, from Hamilton down, vying with each other in  attentions to a man whose state record was so enlightened, and whose  foreign so brilliant, despite one or two humiliating failures. He rented  a small cottage in Maiden Lane, and looked with deep disapproval upon  the aristocratic dissipations of New York, the frigid stateliness of  Washington's "Court." The French Revolution and the snub of the British  king had developed his natural democratism into a controlling passion,  and he would have preferred to find in even the large cities of the new  country the homely bourgeois life of his highest ideals.    
No one accused him of inconsistency in externals. With his shaggy sandy  hair, his great red face, covered with freckles, his long loose figure,  clad in red French breeches a size too small, a threadbare brown coat,  soiled linen and hose, and enormous hands and feet, he must have  astounded the courtly city of New York, and it is certain that he set  Washington's teeth on edge. It is no wonder that when this vision rises  upon the democratic horizon of to-day, he is hailed as a greater man  than Washington or Hamilton.    
Shortly after the final recommitment of the resolution in favour of  assumption, the Federalist leader met this engaging figure almost in  front of Washington's door, and a plan which had dawned in his mind a  day or two before matured on the instant. He had no dislike for  Jefferson at the time, and respected his intellect and diplomatic  talents, without reference to differences of opinion. Jefferson grinned  as Hamilton approached, and offered his great paw amiably. He did not  like his brother secretary's clothes, and his hitherto averted  understanding was gradually moving toward the displeasing fact that  Hamilton was the Administration; but he had had little time for  reflection, and he succumbed temporarily to a fascination which few  resisted.    
Hamilton approached him frankly. "Will you walk up and down with me a  few moments?" he asked. "I have intended to call upon you. You have  returned at a most opportune time. Do you realize, sir, that the whole  business of this nation is at a deadlock? There is nothing in this talk  of the North seceding, but so great is the apprehension that the  energies of the country are paralyzed, and no man thinks of anything but  the possible failure of the Government. I am convinced that assumption  is not only necessary to permanent union, to the solution of the  financial problem, but to the prosperity of the States themselves." He  then proceeded to convince Jefferson, who listened attentively,  wondering, with a sigh, how any man could pour out his thoughts so  rapidly and so well. "Will you turn this over in your mind, and let me  see you again in a day or two?" asked Hamilton, as he finished his  argument. "Let me reiterate that there is no time to lose. The  Government is at a standstill in all matters concerning the  establishment of the country on a sound financial basis, until this  subordinate matter is settled."    
"You alarm and deeply interest me," said Jefferson. "I certainly will  give the matter my attention. Will you dine with me to-morrow? We can  then discuss this matter at leisure. I will ask one or two others."    
The next day, at Mr. Jefferson's epicureous board, Hamilton played his  trump. Having again wrought havoc with his host's imagination, but by no  means trusting to the permanence of any emotion, he proposed a bargain:  if Jefferson would use his influence with the Virginians and other  Southern anti-assumptionists in Congress, he and Robert Morris would  engage to persuade obstinate Northerners to concede the Capital city to  the South. Hamilton made no sacrifice of conviction in offering this  proposition. There was no reason why the Government should not sit as  conveniently on the banks of the Potomac as elsewhere, and if he did not  carry the Union through this new crisis, no one else would. All his  great schemes depended upon his bringing the hostile States to reason,  and with his usual high-handed impatience he carried his object in his  own way.    
Jefferson saw much virtue in this arrangement. The plan was an almost  immediate success. White and Lee of Virginia were induced to change  their votes, and assumption with some modifications passed into a law.  The Government, after a ten years' sojourn in Philadelphia, would abide  permanently upon the Potomac.
