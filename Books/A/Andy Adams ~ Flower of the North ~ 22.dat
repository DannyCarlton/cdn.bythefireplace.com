  News of the double tragedy had swept through the camp, and there   was a crowd in front of the supply-house. Philip passed close to   Thorpe's house to avoid discovery, ran a hundred yards up the  trail  over which Jeanne had fled a short time before, and then cut  straight  across through the thin timber for the head of the lake.  He felt no  effort in his running. Low bush whipped him in the face  and left no  sting. He was not conscious that he was panting for  breath when he  came out in the black shadow of the mountain. This  night in itself had  been a creation for him, for out of grief and  pain it had lifted him  into a new life, and into a happiness that  seemed to fill him with the  strength and the endurance of five  men. Jeanne loved him! The  wonderful truth cried itself out in his  soul at every step he took,  and he murmured it aloud to himself,  over and over again, as he ran. 
  The glow of the signal-fire lighted up the sky above him, and he   climbed up, higher and higher, scrambling swiftly from rock to  rock,  until he saw the tips of the flames licking up into the sky.  He had  come up the steepest and shortest side of the ridge, and  when he  reached the top he lay upon his face for a moment, his  breath almost  gone. 
  The fire was built against a huge dead pine, and the pine was   blazing a hundred feet in the air. He could feel its heat. The   monster torch illumined the barren cap of the rock from edge to  edge,  and he looked about him for Jeanne. For a moment he did not  see her,  and her name rose to his lips, to be stilled in the same  breath by  what he saw beyond the burning pine. Through the blaze  of the heat and  fire fie beheld Jeanne, standing close to the edge  of the mountain,  gazing into the south and west. He called her  name. Jeanne turned  toward him with a startled cry, and Philip was  at her side. The girl's  face was white and strained. Her lips were  twisted in pain at sight of  him. She spoke no word, but a strange  sound rose in her throat, a  welling-up of the sudden despair which  the fire-light revealed in her  eyes. For one moment they stood  apart, and Philip tried to speak. And  then, suddenly, he reached  out and drew her quickly into his arms&#8212;so  quickly that there was  no time for her to escape, so closely that her  sweet face lay  imprisoned upon his breast, as he had held it once  before, under  the picture at Fort o' God. He felt her straining to  free herself;  he saw the fear in her eyes, and he tried to speak  calmly, while  his heart throbbed with the passion of love which he  wished to  pour into her ears. 
  &quot;Listen, Jeanne,&quot; he said. &quot;Pierre has sent me to you. He has told   me everything&#8212;everything, my sweetheart. There is nothing to  keep  from me now. I know. I understand. And I love you&#8212;love you&#8212;  love  you&#8212;my own sweet Jeanne!&quot; 
  She trembled at his words. He felt her shuddering in his arms, and   her eyes gazed at him wonderingly, filled with a strange and   incredulous look, while her lips quivered and remained speechless.  He  drew her nearer, until his face was against her own, and the  warmth of  her lips, her eyes, and her hair entered into him, and  near stifled  his heart with joy. 
  &quot;He has told me everything, my little Jeanne,&quot; he said again, in a   whisper that rose just above the crackling of the pine.  &quot;Everything.  He told me because he knew that I loved you, and  because&#8212;&quot; 
  The words choked in his throat. At this hesitation Jeanne drew her   head back, and, with her hands pressing against his breast, looked   into his face. There were in her eyes the same struggling  emotions,  but with them now there came also a sweet faltering, a  piteous appeal  to him, a faith that rose above her terrors, and  the tremble of her  lips was like that of a crying child. He drew  her face back, and  kissed the quivering lips, and suddenly he felt  the strain against him  give way, and Jeanne's head sobbed upon his  breast. In that moment,  looking where the roaring pine sent its  pinnacles of flame leaping up  into the night, a word of thanks, of  prayer, rose mutely to his lips,  and he held Jeanne more closely,  and whispered over and over again in  his happiness, &quot;Jeanne&#8212;  Jeanne&#8212;my sweetheart Jeanne.&quot; 
  Jeanne's sobs grew less and less, and Philip strengthened himself   to tell her the terrible news of Pierre. He knew that in the   selfishness of his own joy he had already wasted precious minutes,   and very gently he took Jeanne's wet face between his two hands  and  turned it a little toward his own. 
  &quot;Pierre has told me everything, Jeanne,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Everything   &#8212;from the day he found you many years ago to the day your father   returned to torture you.&quot; He spoke calmly, even as he felt her  shiver  in pain against him. &quot;To-night there was a little trouble  down in the  camp, dear. Pierre is wounded, and wants you to come  to him.  Thorpe&#8212;is&#8212;dead.&quot; 
  For an instant Philip was frightened at what happened. Jeanne's   breath ceased. There seemed to be not a quiver of life in her  body,  and she lay in his arms as if dead. And then, suddenly,  there came  from her a terrible cry, and she wrenched herself free,  and stood a  step from him, her face as white as death. 
  &quot;He&#8212;is&#8212;dead&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he is dead.&quot; 
  &quot;And Pierre&#8212;Pierre killed him?&quot; 
  Philip held out his arms, but Jeanne did not seem to see them. She   saw the answer in his face. 
  &quot;And&#8212;Pierre&#8212;is&#8212;hurt&#8212;&quot; she went on, never taking her wide,   luminous eyes from his face. 
  Before he answered Philip took her trembling hands in his own, as   though he would lighten the blow by the warmth and touch of his  great  love. 
  &quot;Yes, he is hurt, Jeanne,&quot; he said. &quot;We must hurry, for I am   afraid there is no time to lose.&quot; 
  &quot;He is&#8212;dying?&quot; 
  &quot;I fear so, Jeanne.&quot; 
  He turned before the look that came into her face, and led her   about the circle of fire to the side of the mountain that sloped  down  into the plain. Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant. Her  fingers  tightened about his. Her face was turned back into the  endless  desolation of night and forest that lay to the south and  west. Far  out&#8212;a mile&#8212;two miles&#8212;an answering fire was breaking  the black  curtain that hid all things beyond them. Jeanne lifted  her face to  him. Grief and love, pain and joy, shone in her eyes. 
  &quot;They are there!&quot; she said, chokingly. &quot;It is Sachigo, and they   are coming&#8212;coming&#8212;coming&#8212;&quot; 
  Once again before they began the descent of the mountain Philip   drew her close in his arms, and kissed her. And this time there  was  the sweet surrender to him of all things in the tenderness of  Jeanne's  lips. Silent in their grief, and yet communing in  sympathy and love in  the firm clasp of their hands, they came down  the mountain, through  the thin spruce forest, and to the lighted  cabin where Pierre lay  dying. MacDougall was in the room when they  entered, and rose softly,  tiptoeing into the little office. Philip  led Jeanne to Pierre's side,  and as he bent over him, and spoke  softly, the half-breed opened his  eyes. He saw Jeanne. Into his  fading eyes there came a wonderful  light. His lips moved, and his  hands strove to lift themselves above  the crumpled blanket. Jeanne  dropped upon her knees beside him, and as  she clasped his chilled  hands to her breast a glorious understanding  lighted up her face;  and then she took Pierre's face between her  hands, and bowed her  own close down to it, so that the two were hidden  under the  beauteous halo of her hair. Philip gripped at his throat to  hold  back a sob. A terrible stillness came into the room, and he dared   not move. It seemed a long time before Jeanne lifted her head,   slowly, tenderly, as if fearing to awaken a sleeping child. She   turned to him, and he read the truth in her face before she had   spoken. Her voice was low and calm, filled with the sweetness and   tenderness and strength that come only to a woman in the final  moment  of a great sorrow. 
  &quot;Leave us, Philip,&quot; she said. &quot;Pierre is dead.&quot;
