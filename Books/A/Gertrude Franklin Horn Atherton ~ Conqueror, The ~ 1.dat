It was my original intention to write a biography of Alexander Hamilton  in a more flexible manner than is customary with that method of  reintroducing the dead to the living, but without impinging upon the  territory of fiction. But after a visit to the British and Danish West  Indies in search of the truth regarding his birth and ancestry, and  after a wider acquaintance with the generally romantic character of his  life, to say nothing of the personality of this most endearing and  extraordinary of all our public men, the instinct of the novelist proved  too strong; I no sooner had pen in hand than I found myself working in  the familiar medium, although preserving the historical sequence. But,  after all, what is a character novel but a dramatized biography? We  strive to make our creations as real to the world as they are to us.  Why, then, not throw the graces of fiction over the sharp hard facts  that historians have laboriously gathered? At all events, this  infinitely various story of Hamilton appealed too strongly to my  imagination to be frowned aside, so here, for better or worse, is the  result. Nevertheless, and although the method may cause the book to read  like fiction, I am conscientious in asserting that almost every  important incident here related of his American career is founded on  documentary or published facts or upon family tradition; the few that  are not have their roots among the probabilities, and suggested  themselves. As for the West Indian part, although I was obliged to work  upon the bare skeleton I unearthed in the old Common Records and Church  Registers, still the fact remains that I did find the skeleton, which I  have emphasized as far as is artistically possible. No date is given nor  deed referred to that cannot be found by other visitors to the Islands.  Moreover, I made a careful study of these Islands as they were in the  time of Hamilton and his maternal ancestors, that I might be enabled to  exercise one of the leading principles of the novelist, which is to  create character not only out of certain well-known facts of heredity,  but out of understood conditions. In this case I had, in addition, an  extensive knowledge of Hamilton's character to work backward from, as  well as his estimate of the friends of his youth and of his mother.  Therefore I feel confident that I have held my romancing propensity well  within the horizon of the probabilities; at all events, I have depicted  nothing which in any way interferes with the veracity of history.  However, having unburdened my imagination, I shall, in the course of a  year or two, write the biography I first had in mind. No writer, indeed,  could assume a more delightful task than to chronicle, in any form,  Hamilton's stupendous services to this country and his infinite variety.
