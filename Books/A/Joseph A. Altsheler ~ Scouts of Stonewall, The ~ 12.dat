  &#8220;George,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;we must chance it now and get back to the  horses.  We've got to reach General Jackson before the Northern army is  through  the pass.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You lead,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;I don't think we'll have any danger  except  when we are in that strip of grass between these bushes and the  woods.&#8221; 
  Harry started, and when he reached the grass threw himself almost  flat on  his face again, crawling forward with extreme caution.   Dalton, close  behind him, imitated his comrade.  The high grass  merely rippled as they  passed and the anxious Northern officers  walking back and forth were not  well enough versed in woodcraft to  read from any sign that an enemy was  near. 
  Once Dalton struck his knee against a small bush and caused its  leaves to  rustle.  A wary and experienced scout would have noticed the  slight,  though new noise, and Harry and Dalton, stopping, lay  perfectly still.  But the officers walked to and fro, undisturbed, and  the two boys resumed  their creeping flight. 
  When they reached the forest, they rose gladly from their knees,  and ran  up the slope, still bearing in mind that time was now the most  pressing  of all things.  They whistled softly as they neared the  little plateau,  and Billy's low answering whistle came back.  They  hurried up the last  reach of the slope, and there he was, the eyes  shining in his eager face,  the three bridles clutched tightly in his  small right hand. 
  &#8220;Did you get what you wanted?&#8221; he asked in a whisper. 
  &#8220;We did, Billy,&#8221; answered Harry. 
  &#8220;I saw 'em sendin' up shootin' stars an' other shootin' stars way  off to  the east answerin', an' I didn't know what it meant.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It was their vanguard in the Gap, talking to their army several  miles to  the eastward.  But we lay in the bushes, Billy, and we heard  what their  officers said.  All that you heard was true.  Ten thousand  Yankees will  be through the pass in the morning, and Stonewall Jackson  will have great  cause to be grateful to William Pomeroy, aged twelve.&#8221; 
  The boy's eyes fairly glowed, but he was a man of action. 
  &#8220;Then I guess that we've got to jump on our horses and ride lickety  split  down the valley to give warnin' to General Jackson,&#8221; he said. 
  Harry knew what was passing in the boy's mind, that he would go  with them  all the way to Jackson, and he did not have the heart to say  anything to  the contrary just then.  But Dalton replied: 
  &#8220;Right you are, Billy.  We ride now as if the woods were burning  behind  us.&#8221; 
  Billy was first in the saddle and led the way.  The horses had  gained a  good rest, while Harry and Dalton were stalking the troopers  in the  valley, and, after they had made the descent of the slope, they  swung  into a long easy gallop across the level. 
  The little lad still kept his place in front.  Neither of the  others  would have deprived him of this honor which he deserved so  well.  He sat  erect, swinging with his horse, and he showed no sign of  weariness.  They took no precautions now to evade a possible meeting  with the enemy.  What they needed was haste, haste, always haste.  They  must risk  everything to carry the news to Jackson.  A mere half hour  might mean the  difference between salvation and destruction. 
  Harry felt the great tension of the moment.  The words of the  Northern  officers had made him understand what he already suspected.   The whole  fate of the Confederacy would waver in the balance on the  morrow.  If Jackson were surrounded and overpowered, the South would  lose its  right arm.  Then the armies that engulfed him would join  McClellan and  pour forward in an overwhelming host on Richmond. 
  Their hoofbeats rang in a steady beat on the road, as they went  forward  on that long easy gallop which made the miles drop swiftly  behind them.  The skies brightened, and the great stars danced in a  solid sheet of  blue.  They were in the gently rolling country, and  occasionally they  passed a farmhouse.  Now and then, a watchful dog  barked at them, but  they soon left him and his bark behind. 
  Harry noticed that Billy's figure was beginning to waver slightly,   and he knew that weariness and the lack of sleep were at last gaining  the  mastery over his daring young spirit.  It gave him relief, as it  solved a  problem that had been worrying him.  He rode up by the side  of Billy,  but he said nothing.  The boy's eyelids were heavy and the  youthful  figure was wavering, but it was in no danger of falling.   Billy could  have ridden his horse sound asleep. 
  Harry presently saw the roof of Mrs. Pomeroy's house showing among  the  trees. 
  &#8220;It's less than half a mile to your house, Billy,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;But I'm not going to stop there.  I'm goin' on with you to General   Jackson, an' I'm goin' to help him fight the Yankees.&#8221; 
  Harry was silent, but when they galloped up to the Pomeroy house,  Billy  was nearly asleep. 
  The door sprang open as they approached, and the figure of the  stalwart  woman appeared.  Harry knew that she had been watching there  every minute  since they left.  He was touched by the dramatic spirit  of the moment,  and he said: 
  &#8220;Mrs. Pomeroy, we bring back to you the most gallant soldier in  Stonewall  Jackson's army of the Valley of Virginia.  He led us  straight to the Gap  where we were able to learn the enemy's movements,  a knowledge which may  save the Confederacy from speedy destruction.   We bring him back to you,  safe and unharmed, and sleeping soundly in  his saddle.&#8221; 
  He lifted Billy from the saddle and put him in his mother's arms. 
  &#8220;Billy's a hero, Cousin Eliza,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Few full-grown men  have  done as important deeds in their whole lives as he has done  to-night.  When he awakens he'll be angry because he didn't go with us,  but you tell  him we'll see that he's a duly enrolled member of General  Jackson's army.  Stonewall Jackson never forgets such deeds as his.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's a proud woman I am to-night,&#8221; said Mrs. Pomeroy.  &#8220;Good-bye,   Cousin George, and you, too, Mr. Kenton.  I can see that you're in a   hurry to be off, and you ought to be.  I want to see both of you in my   house again in better days.&#8221; 
  She went inside, carrying the exhausted and sleeping boy in her  arms,  and Harry and Dalton galloped away side by side. 
  &#8220;How's your horse, Harry?&#8221; asked Dalton. 
  &#8220;Fine.  Smooth as silk!  How's yours?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The machinery moves without a jar.  I may be stiff and sore  myself,  but I'm so anxious to get to General Jackson that I haven't  time to think  about it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Same here.  Suppose we speed 'em up a little more.&#8221; 
  They came into the turnpike, and now the horses lengthened out  their  stride as they fled northward.  It was yet some time until dawn,  but the  two young riders took the cold food from their knapsacks and  ate as they  galloped on.  It was well that they had good horses,  staunch and true,  as they were pushing them hard now. 
  Harry looked toward the west, where the dark slope of Little North   Mountain closed in the valley from that side, and he felt a shiver  which  he knew did not come from the night air.  He knew that a  powerful  Northern force was off there somewhere, and he wondered what  it was  doing.  But he and Dalton had done their duty.  They had  uncovered one  hostile force, and doubtless other men who rode in the  night for Jackson  would attend to the rest. 
  Both Harry and Dalton had been continuously in the saddle for many  hours  now, but they did not notice their weariness.  They were still  upborne by  a great anxiety and a great exaltation, too.  Feeling to  the full the  imminence and immensity of the crisis, they were bending  themselves heart  and soul to prevent it, and no thought of weariness  could enter their  minds.  Each was another Billy, only on a larger and  older scale. 
  Later on, the moon and all the stars slipped away, and it became  very  dark.  Harry felt that it was merely a preliminary to the dawn,  and he  asked Dalton if he did not think so, too. 
  &#8220;It's too dark for me to see the face of my watch,&#8221; said Dalton,  &#8220;but I  know you're right, Harry.  I can just feel the coming of the  dawn.  It's some quality in the air.  I think it grows a little colder  than it  has been in the other hours of the night.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can feel the wind freshening on my face.  It nips a bit for a  May  morning.&#8221; 
  They slackened speed a little, wishing to save their horses for a  final  burst, and stopped once or twice for a second or two to listen  for the  sound of other hoofbeats than their own.  But they heard none. 
  &#8220;If the Yankee armies are already on the turnpike they're not near  us.  That's sure,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;Do you know how many men they have?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Some of the spies brought in what the general believed to be  pretty  straight reports.  The rumors said that Shields was advancing  to Manassas  Gap with ten thousand men, and from what we heard we know  that is true.  A second detachment, also ten thousand strong, from  McDowell's army is  coming toward Front Royal, and McDowell has twenty  thousand men east of  the Blue Ridge.  What the forces to the west are  I don't know but the  enemy in face of the general himself on the  Potomac must now number at  least ten thousand.&#8221; 
  Harry whistled. 
  &#8220;And at the best we can't muster more than fifteen thousand fit to  carry  arms!&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  Dalton leaned over in the dark, and touched his comrade on the  shoulder. 
  &#8220;Harry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don't forget Old Jack.  Where Little Sorrel  leads  there is always an army of forty thousand men.  I'm not setting  myself up  to be very religious, but it's safe to say that he was  praying to-night,  and when Old Jack prays, look out.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, if anybody can lead us out of this trap it will be Old Jack,&#8221;   said Harry.  &#8220;Look, there's the dawn coming over the Blue Ridge,  George.&#8221; 
  A faint tint of gray was appearing on the loftiest crests of the  Blue  Ridge.  It could scarcely be called light yet, but it was a sign  to the  two that the darkness there would soon melt away.  Gradually  the gray  shredded off and then the ridges were tipped with silver  which soon  turned to gold.  Dawn rushed down over the valley and the  pleasant  forests and fields sprang into light. 
  Then they heard hoofbeats behind them coming fast.  The experienced  ears  of both told them that it was only a single horseman who came,  and,  drawing their pistols, they turned their horses across the road.   When  the rider saw the two threatening figures he stopped, but in a  moment he  rode on again.  They were in gray and so was he. 
  &#8220;Why, it's Chris Aubrey of the general's own staff!&#8221; exclaimed  Dalton.  &#8220;Don't you know him, Harry?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course I do.  Aubrey, we're friends.  It's Dalton and Kenton.&#8221; 
  Aubrey dashed his hands across his eyes, as if he were clearing a  mist  from them.  He was worn and weary, and his look bore a singular   resemblance to that of despair. 
  &#8220;What is it, Chris?&#8221; asked Dalton with sympathy. 
  &#8220;I was sent down the Luray Valley to learn what I could and I  discovered  that Ord was advancing with ten thousand men on Front  Royal, where  General Jackson left only a small garrison.  I'm going as  fast as my  horse can take me to tell him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We're on the same kind of a mission, Chris,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;We've  seen  the vanguard of Shields, ten thousand strong coming through  Manassas Gap,  and we also are going as fast as our horses can take us  to tell General  Jackson.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My God!  Does it mean that we are about to be surrounded?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It looks like it,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but sometimes you catch things  that you  can't hold.  George and I never give up faith in Old Jack.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nor do I,&#8221; said Aubrey.  &#8220;Come on!  We'll ride together!  I'm glad  I met  you boys.  You give me courage.&#8221; 
  The three now rode abreast and again they galloped.  One or two  early  farmers going phlegmatically to their fields saw them, but they  passed on  in silence.  They had grown too used to soldiers to pay much  attention to  them.  Moreover, these were their own. 
  The whole valley was now flooded with light.  To east and to west  loomed  the great walls of the mountains, heavy with foliage, cut here  and there  by invisible gaps through which Harry knew that the Union  troops were  pouring. 
  They caught sight of moving heads on a narrow road coming from the  west  which would soon merge into theirs.  They slackened speed for a  moment or  two, uncertain what to do, and then Aubrey exclaimed: 
  &#8220;It's a detachment of our own cavalry.  See their gray uniforms,  and  that's Sherburne leading them!&#8221; 
  &#8220;So it is!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, and he rode forward joyfully.   Sherburne  gave all three of them a warm welcome, but he was far from  cheerful.  He led a dozen troopers and they, like himself, were covered  with dust  and were drooping with weariness.  It was evident to Harry  that they had  ridden far and hard, and that they did not bring good  news. 
  &#8220;Well, Harry,&#8221; said Sherburne, still attempting the gay air,  &#8220;chance has  brought us together again, and I should judge from your  appearance that  you've come a long way, bringing nothing particularly  good.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's so.  George and I have been riding all night.  We were in  Manassas  Gap and we learned definitely that Shields is coming through  the pass  with ten thousand men.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Fine,&#8221; said Sherburne with a dusty smile.  &#8220;Ten thousand is a good  round  number.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And if we'll give him time enough,&#8221; continued Harry, &#8220;McDowell  will come  with twice as many more.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Look's likely,&#8221; said Sherburne. 
  &#8220;We've been riding back toward Jackson as fast as we could,&#8221;  continued  Harry, &#8220;and a little while ago Aubrey riding the same way  overtook us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And what have you seen, Aubrey?&#8221; asked Sherburne. 
  &#8220;I?  Oh, I've seen a lot.  I've been down by Front Royal in the  night,  and I've seen Ord with ten thousand men coming full tilt down  the Luray  Valley.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What another ten thousand!  It's funny how the Yankees run to even  tens  of thousands, or multiples of that number.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've heard,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;that the force under Banks and Saxton in  front  of Jackson was ten thousand also.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm sorry, boys, to break up this continuity,&#8221; said Sherburne with  a  troubled laugh, &#8220;but it's fifteen thousand that I've got to report.   Fremont is coming from the west with that number.  We've seen 'em.   I've no doubt that at this moment there are nearly fifty thousand  Yankees  in the valley, with more coming, and all but ten thousand of  them are in  General Jackson's rear.&#8221; 
  It seemed that Sherburne, daring cavalryman, had lost his courage  for the  moment, but the faith of the stern Presbyterian youth, Dalton,  never  faltered. 
  &#8220;As I told Harry a little while ago, we have at least fifty  thousand men,&#8221;  he said. 
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Sherburne. 
  &#8220;I count Stonewall Jackson as forty thousand, and the rest will  bring the  number well over fifty thousand.&#8221; 
  Sherburne struck his gauntleted hand smartly on his thigh. 
  &#8220;You talk sense, Dalton!&#8221; he exclaimed.  &#8220;I was foolish to despair!   I forgot how much there was under Stonewall Jackson's hat!  They  haven't  caught the old fox yet!&#8221; 
  They galloped on anew, and now they were riding on the road, over  which  they had pursued so hotly the defeated army of Banks.  They  would soon be  in Jackson's camp, and as they approached their hearts  grew lighter.  They would cast off their responsibilities and trust all  to the leader  who appeared so great to them. 
  &#8220;I see pickets now,&#8221; said Aubrey.  &#8220;Only five more minutes, boys,  but as  soon as I give my news I'll have to drop.  The excitement has  kept me up,  but I can't last any longer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Harry, who realized suddenly that he was on the verge  of  collapse.  &#8220;Whether our arrival is to be followed by a battle or a   retreat I'm afraid I won't be fit for either.&#8221; 
  They gave the password, and the pickets pointed to the tent of  Jackson.  They rode straight to him, and dismounted as he came forth  from the tent.  They were so stiff and sore from long riding that  Dalton and Aubrey fell  to their knees when they touched the ground,  but they quickly recovered,  and although they stood somewhat awkwardly  they saluted with the deepest  respect.  Jackson's glance did not  escape their mishap, and he knew the  cause, but he merely said: 
  &#8220;Well, gentlemen.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have to report, sir,&#8221; said Sherburne, speaking first as the  senior  officer, &#8220;that General Fremont is coming from the west with  fifteen  thousand men, ready to fall upon your right flank.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very good, and what have you seen, Captain Aubrey?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Ord with ten thousand men is in our rear and is approaching Front  Royal.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very good.  You have done faithful work, Captain Aubrey.  What  have you  seen, Lieutenant Kenton and Lieutenant Dalton?&#8221; 
  &#8220;General Shields, sir, is in Manassas Gap this morning with ten  thousand  men, and he and General Ord can certainly meet to-day if they  wish.  We learned also that General McDowell can come up in a few days  with  twenty thousand more.&#8221; 
  The face of Stonewall Jackson never flinched.  It looked worn and  weary  but not more so than it did before this news. 
  &#8220;I thank all of you, young gentlemen,&#8221; he said in his quiet level  tones.  &#8220;You have done good service.  It may be that you're a little  weary.  You'd better sleep now.  I shall call you when I want you.&#8221; 
  The four saluted and General Jackson went back into the tent.   Aubrey  made a grimace. 
  &#8220;We may be a little tired!&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Why, I haven't been out of  the  saddle for twenty-four hours, and I felt so anxious that every one  of  those hours was a day long.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But it's a lot to get from the general an admission that you may  be even  a little tired,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Remember the man for whom you  ride.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so,&#8221; said Aubrey, &#8220;and I oughtn't to have said what I did.   We've got to live up to new standards.&#8221; 
  Sherburne, Aubrey and Dalton picked out soft spots on the grass and   almost instantly were sound asleep, but Harry lingered a minute or two   longer.  He saw across the river the glitter of bayonets and the dark   muzzles of cannon.  He also saw many troops moving on the hills and he   knew that he was looking upon the remains of Banks' army reinforced by   fresh men, ready to dispute the passage or fight Jackson if he marched   northward in any other way, while the great masses of their comrades   gathered behind him. 
  Harry felt again for a moment that terrible sinking of the heart  which is  such close kin to despair.  Enemies to the north of them,  enemies to the  south of them, and to the east and to the west, enemies  everywhere.  The ring was closing in.  Worse than that, it had closed  in already and  Stonewall Jackson was only mortal.  Neither he nor any  one else could  lead them through the overwhelming ranks of such a  force. 
  But the feeling passed quickly.  It could not linger, because the  band of  the Acadians was playing, and the dark men of the Gulf were  singing.  Even with the foe in sight, and a long train of battles and  marches  behind them, with others yet worse to come, they began to  dance, clasped  in one another's arms. 
  Many of the Acadians had already gone to a far land and they would  never  again on this earth see Antoinette or Celeste or Marie, but the  sun of  the south was in the others and they sang and danced in the  brief rest  allowed to them. 
  Harry liked to look at them.  He sat on the grass and leaned his  back  against a tree.  The music raised up the heart and it was  wonderfully  lulling, too.  Why worry?  Stonewall Jackson would tell  them what to do. 
  The rhythmic forms grew fainter, and he slept.  He was awakened the  next  instant by Dalton.  Harry opened his eyes heavily and looked   reproachfully at his friend. 
  &#8220;I've slept less than a minute,&#8221; he said. 
  Dalton laughed. 
  &#8220;So it seemed to me, too, when I was awakened,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but  you've  slept a full two hours just as I did.  What do you expect when  you're  working for Stonewall Jackson.  You'll be lucky later on  whenever you get  a single hour.&#8221; 
  Harry brushed the traces of sleep from his eyes and stood up  straight. 
  &#8220;What's wanted?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;You and I and some others are going to take a little railroad  trip,  escorted by Stonewall Jackson.  That's all I know and that's all  anybody  knows except the general.  Come along and look your little  best.&#8221; 
  Harry brushed out his wrinkled uniform, straightened his cap, and  in a  minute he and Dalton were with the group of staff officers about  Jackson.  There was still a section of railway in the valley held by  the South,  and Jackson and his aides were soon aboard a small train on  their way  back to Winchester.  Harry, glancing from the window, saw  the troops  gathering up their ammunition and the teamsters hitching up  their horses. 
  &#8220;It's going to be a retreat up the valley,&#8221; he whispered to Dalton.   &#8220;But masses more than three to one are gathering about us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I tell you again, you just trust Old Jack.&#8221; 
  Harry looked toward the far end of the coach where Jackson sat with  the  older members of his staff.  His figure swayed with the train, but  he  showed no sign of weariness or that his dauntless soul dwelt in a   physical body.  He was looking out at the window, but it was obvious  that  he did not see the green landscape flashing past.  Harry knew  that he was  making the most complex calculations, but like Dalton he  ceased to wonder  about them.  He put his faith in Old Jack, and let it  go at that. 
  There was very little talking in the train.  Despite every effort,   Harry's eyes grew heavy and he began to doze a little.  He would waken   entirely at times and straighten up with a jerk.  Then he would see  the  fields and forests still rushing past, now and then a flash as  they  crossed a stream, and always the sober figure of the general,  staring,  unseeing, through the window. 
  He suddenly became wide-awake, when he heard sharp comment in the  coach.  All the older officers were gazing through the windows with the  greatest  interest.  Harry saw a man in Confederate uniform galloping  across the  fields and waving his hands repeatedly to the train which  was already  checking speed. 
  &#8220;A staff officer with news,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and I'm thinking it will seem bad news to you  and me.&#8221; 
  The train stopped in a field, and the officer, panting and covered  with  dust and perspiration, rode alongside.  Jackson walked out on the  steps,  followed by his eager officers. 
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;The Northern army has retaken Front Royal.  The Georgia regiment  you  left in garrison there has been driven out and without support is   marching northward.  I have here, sir, a dispatch from Colonel Connor,   the commander of the Georgians.&#8221; 
  He handed the folded paper to the general, who received it but did  not  open it for a moment.  There was something halfway between a sigh  and a  groan from the officers, but Jackson said nothing.  He smiled,  but,  as Harry saw it, it was a strange and threatening smile.  Then he  opened  the dispatch, read it carefully, tore it into tiny bits and  threw them  away.  Harry saw the fragments picked up by the wind and  whirled across  the field.  Jackson nearly always destroyed his  dispatches in this manner. 
  &#8220;Very good,&#8221; he said to the officer, &#8220;you can rejoin Colonel  Connor.&#8221; 
  He went back to his seat.  The train puffed, heaved and started  again.  Jackson leaned against the back of the seat and closed his  eyes.  He  seemed to be asleep.  But the desire for sleep was driven  from Harry.  The news of the retaking of Front Royal had stirred the  whole train.  Officers talked of it in low tones, but with excitement.   The Northern  generals were acting with more than their customary  promptness.  Already  they had struck a blow and Ord with his ten  thousand men had undoubtedly  passed from the Luray Valley into the  main Valley of Virginia to form a  junction with Shields and his ten  thousand. 
  What would Jackson do?  Older men in the train than Harry and  Dalton were  asking that question, but he remained silent.  He kept his  eyes closed  for some time, and Harry thought that he must be fast  asleep, although it  seemed incredible that a man with such  responsibilities could sleep at  such a time.  But he opened his eyes  presently and began to talk with a  warm personal friend who occupied  the other half of the seat. 
  Harry did not know the tenor of this conversation then, but he  heard of  it later from the general's friend.  Jackson had remarked to  the man that  he seemed to be surrounded, and the other asked what he  would do if the  Northern armies cut him off entirely.  Jackson replied  that he would go  back toward the north, invade Maryland and march  straight on Baltimore  and Washington.  Few more daring plans have ever  been conceived, but,  knowing Jackson as he learned to know him, Harry  always believed that he  would have tried it. 
  But the Southern leaders within that mighty and closing ring in the   valley were not the only men who had anxious minds.  At the Union  capital  they did not know what had become of Jackson.  They knew that  he was  somewhere within the ring, but where?  He might pounce upon a  division,  deal another terrible blow and then away!  In a week he had  drawn the  eyes of the world upon him, and his enemies no longer  considered anything  impossible to him.  Many a patriot who was ready  to die rather than see  the union of the states destroyed murmured: &#8220;If  he were only on our side!&#8221;  There was already talk of recalling  McClellan's great army to defend  Washington. 
  The object of all this immense anxiety and care was riding  peacefully in  a train to Winchester, talking with a friend but  conscious fully of his  great danger.  It seemed that the Northern  generals with their separate  armies were acting in unison at last, and  must close down on their prey. 
  They came again into Winchester, the town torn so often by battle  and its  anxieties, and saw the Presbyterian minister, his face gray  with care,  greet Jackson.  Then the two walked toward the manse,  followed at a  respectful distance by the officers of the staff. 
  Harry soon saw that the whole of Winchester was in gloom.  They  knew  there of the masses in blue converging on Jackson, and few had  hope.  While Jackson remained at the manse he sat upon the portico  within call.  There was little sound in Winchester.  The town seemed to  have passed  into an absolute silence.  Most of the doors and shutters  were closed. 
  And yet the valley had never seemed more beautiful to Harry.  Far  off  were the dim blue mountains that enclosed it on either side, and  the  bright skies never bent in a more brilliant curve. 
  He felt again that overpowering desire to sleep, and he may have  dozed a  little when he sat there in the sun, but he was wide awake  when Jackson  called him. 
  &#8220;I want you to go at once to Harper's Ferry with this note,&#8221; he  said,  &#8220;and give it to the officer in command.  He will bring back the  troops to  Winchester, and you are to come with him.  You can go most  of the way on  the train and then you must take to your horse.  The  troops will march  back by the valley turnpike.&#8221; 
  Harry saluted and was off.  He soon found that other officers were  going  to the various commands with orders similar to his, and he no  longer had  any doubt that the whole force would be consolidated and  would withdraw  up the valley.  He was right.  Jackson had abandoned  the plan of entering  Maryland and marching on Baltimore and  Washington, and was now about to  try another, fully as daring, but  calling for the most sudden and  complicated movements.  He had  arranged it all, as he rode in the train,  most of it as he leaned  against the back of the seat with his eyes shut. 
  Harry was soon back in Harper's Ferry, and the troops there  immediately  began their retreat.  Most all of them knew of the great  danger that  menaced their army, but Harry, a staff officer, understood  better than  the regimental commanders what was occurring.  The  Invincibles were in  their division and he rode with the two colonels,  St. Clair and Happy Tom  Langdon.  They went at a swift pace and behind  them came the steady beat  of the marching troops on the turnpike. 
  &#8220;You have been with General Jackson in Winchester, Harry,&#8221; said  Colonel  Leonidas Talbot in his precise manner, &#8220;and I judge that you  must have  formed some idea of his intentions.  This indicates a  general retreat  southward, does it not?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think so, sir.  General Jackson has said nothing, but I know  that  orders have been sent to all our detachments to draw in.  He must  have  some plan of cutting his way through toward the south.  What do  you think,  Colonel St. Hilaire?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It must be so,&#8221; replied Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire,  &#8220;but how  he will do it is beyond me.  When I look around at all these  blue  mountains, Leonidas, it seems to me that we're enclosed by living   battlements.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Or that Jackson is like the tiger in the bush, surrounded by the   beaters.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, and sometimes it's woe to the beaters when they come too  near.&#8221; 
  Harry dropped back with his younger friends who were by no means of  sad  demeanor.  St. Clair had restored his uniform to its usual  immaculate  neatness or in some manner he had obtained a new one.  Tom  Langdon was  Happy Tom again. 
  &#8220;We've eaten well, and we've slept well,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;and Arthur  and I  are restored completely.  He's the finest dandy in the army  again,  and I'm ready for another week's run with Jackson.  I know I  won't get  another chance to rest in a long time, but Old Stonewall  needn't think I  can't march as long as he can.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You'll get your fill of it,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and of fighting, too.   Take a  look all around you.  No, not a half circle, but a complete  circle.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, I've twisted my neck until my head nearly falls off.  What   signifies the performance?&#8221; 
  &#8220;There was no time when you were turning around the circle that  your eyes  didn't look toward Yankees.  Nearly fifty thousand of 'em  are in the  valley.  We're in a ring of steel, Happy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, Old Jack will just take his sword and slash that steel ring  apart.  And if he should fail I'm here.  Lead me to 'em, Harry.&#8221; 
  Langdon's spirits were infectious.  Even the marching men who heard  Happy  Tom laugh, laughed with him and were more cheerful.  They  marched faster,  too, and from other points men were coming quickly to  Jackson at  Winchester.  They were even coming into contact with the  ring of steel  which was closing in on them.  Fremont, advancing with  his fifteen  thousand from the mountains, met a heavy fire from a line  of ambushed  riflemen.  Not knowing where Jackson was or what he was  doing, and  fearing that the great Confederate commander might be  before him with his  whole army, he stopped at Cedar Creek and made a  camp of defense. 
  Shields, in the south, moving forward, found a swarm of skirmishers  in  his front, and presently the Acadians, sent in that direction by  Jackson,  opened up with a heavy fire on his vanguard.  Shields drew  back.  He, too,  feared that Jackson with his entire army was before  him and rumor  magnified the Southern force.  Meanwhile the flying  cavalry of Ashby  harassed the Northern advance at many points. 
  All the time the main army of Jackson was retreating toward  Winchester,  carrying with it the prisoners and a vast convoy of wagons  filled with  captured ammunition and stores.  Jackson had foreseen  everything.  He had directed the men who were leading these forces to  pass around  Winchester in case he was compelled to abandon it, circle  through the  mountains and join him wherever he might be. 
  But Harry when he returned to Winchester breathed a little more  freely.  He felt in some manner that the steel ring did not compress so  tightly.  Jackson, acting on the inside of the circle, had spread  consternation.  The Northern generals could not communicate with one  another because  either mountains or Southern troops came between.   Prisoners whom the  Southern cavalry brought in told strange stories.   Rumor in their ranks  had magnified Jackson's numbers double or  triple.  Many believed that a  great force was coming from Richmond to  help him.  Jackson was surrounded,  but the beaters were very wary  about pressing in on him. 
  Yet the Union masses in the valley had increased.  McDowell himself  had  now come, and he sent forward cavalry details which, losing the  way,  were compelled to return.  Fremont on the west at last finding  the line  of riflemen before him withdrawn, pushed forward, and saw the  long  columns of the Southern army with their wagons moving steadily  toward the  south.  His cavalry attacking were driven off and the  Southern division  went on. 
  Harry with the retreating division wondered at these movements and   admired their skill.  Jackson's army, encumbered as it was with  prisoners  and stores, was passing directly between the armies of  Fremont and  Shields, covering its flanks with clouds of skirmishers  and cavalry that  beat off every attack of the hostile vanguards, and  that kept the two  Northern armies from getting into touch. 
  Jackson had not stopped at Winchester.  He had left that town once  more  to the enemy and was still drawing back toward the wider division  of the  valley west of the Massanuttons.  The great mind was working  very fast  now.  The men themselves saw that warlike genius incarnate  rode on the  back of Little Sorrel.  Jackson was slipping through the  ring, carrying  with him every prisoner and captured wagon. 
  His lightning strokes to right and to left kept Shields and Fremont  dazed  and bewildered, and McDowell neither knew what was passing nor  could he  get his forces together.  Harry saw once more and with  amazement the dark  bulk of the Massanuttons rising on his left and he  knew that these great  isolated mountains would again divide the Union  force, while Jackson  passed on in the larger valley. 
  He felt a thrill, powerful and indescribable.  Jackson in very  truth had  slashed across with his sword that great ring of steel and  was passing  through the break, leaving behind not a single prisoner,  nor a single  wagon.  Sixty-two thousand men had not only failed to  hold sixteen  thousand, but their scattered forces had suffered  numerous severe defeats  from the far smaller army.  It was not that  the Northern men were  inferior to the Southern in courage and  tenacity, but the Southern army  was led by a genius of the first rank,  unmatched as a military leader in  modern times, save by Napoleon and  Lee. 
  It was the last day of May and the twilight was at hand.  The dark  masses  of Little North Mountain to the west and of the Massanuttons to  the east  were growing dim.  Harry rode by the side of Dalton a few  paces in the  rear of Jackson, and he watched the somber, silent man,  riding silently  on Little Sorrel.  There was nothing bright or  spectacular about him.  The battered gray uniform was more battered  than ever.  In place of the  worn cap an old slouched hat now shaded  his forehead and eyes.  But Harry  knew that their extraordinary  achievements had not been due to luck or  chance, but were the result  of the mighty calculations that had been made  in the head under the  old slouched hat. 
  Harry heard behind him the long roll and murmur of the marching  army,  the wheels of cannon and wagons grating on the turnpike, the  occasional  neigh of a horse, the rattle of arms and the voices of men  talking low.  Most of these men had been a year and a half ago citizens  untrained for  war.  They were not mere creatures of drill, but they  were intelligent,  and they thought for themselves.  They knew as well  as the officers what  Jackson had done and henceforth they looked upon  him as something almost  superhuman.  Confident in his genius they were  ready to follow wherever  Jackson led, no matter what the odds. 
  These were exactly the feelings of both Harry and Dalton.  They  would  never question or doubt again.  Both of them, with the hero  worship of  youth felt a mighty swell of pride, that they should ride  with so great a  leader, and be so near to him. 
  The army marched on in the darkening hours, leaving behind it sixty   thousand men who closed up the ring only to find their game gone. 
  Harry heard from the older staff officers that they would go on up  the  valley until they came to the Gaps of the Blue Ridge.  There in an   impregnable position they could turn and fight pursuit or take the   railway to Richmond and join in the defense against McClellan.  It all   depended on what Jackson thought, and his thoughts were uniformly   disclosed by action. 
  Meanwhile the news was spreading through the North that Jackson had   escaped, carrying with him his prisoners and captured stores.  Odds  had  counted for nothing.  All the great efforts directed from  Washington had  been unavailing.  All the courage and energy of brave  men had been in  vain.  But the North did not cease her exertions for  an instant.  Lincoln,  a man of much the same character as Jackson, but  continually thwarted by  mediocre generals, urged the attack anew.   Dispatches were sent to all  the commanders ordering them to push the  pursuit of Jackson and to bring  him to battle. 
  Cut to the quick by their great failure, Fremont, Shields, Ord,  Banks,  McDowell and all the rest, pushed forward on either side of the   Massanuttons, those on the west intending to cross at the gap, join  their  brethren, and make another concerted attempt at Jackson's  destruction. 
  But Harry ceased to think of armies and battles as he rode on in  the  dark.  He was growing sleepy again and he dozed in his saddle.   Half  consciously he thought of his father and wondered where he was.   He had  received only one letter from him after Shiloh, but he  believed that he  was still with the Confederate army in the west,  taking an active part.  Much as he loved his father it was the first  time that he had been in his  thoughts in the last two weeks.  How  could any one think of anything but  the affair of the moment at such a  time, when the seconds were ticked off  by cannon-shots! 
  In this vague and pleasant dream he also remembered Dick Mason, his   cousin, who was now somewhere there in the west fighting on the other   side.  He thought of Dick with affection and he liked him none the  less  because he wore the blue.  Then, curiously enough, the last thing  that he  remembered was his Tacitus, lying in his locked desk in the  Pendleton  Academy.  He would get out that old fellow again some day  and finish him.  Then he fell sound asleep in his saddle, and the horse  went steadily on,  safely carrying his sleeping master. 
  He did not awake until midnight, when Dalton's hand on his shoulder   caused him to open his eyes. 
  &#8220;I've been asleep, too, Harry,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;but I woke up first.   We're going into camp here for the rest of the night.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm glad to stop,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;but I wonder what the dawn will  bring.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Dalton.
