While these things were happening on the sea close by, a very different  scene indeed was being enacted meanwhile, beneath those waving palms, on  the island of Boupari. It was strange, to be sure, as Felix Thurstan had  said, that such unspeakable heathen orgies should be taking place within  sight of a passing Christian English steamer. But if only he had known or  reflected to what sort of land he was trying now to struggle ashore with  Muriel, he might well have doubted whether it were not better to let her  perish where she was, in the pure clear ocean, rather than to submit an  English girl to the possibility of undergoing such horrible heathen rites  and ceremonies.    
For on the island of Boupari it was high feast with the worshippers of  their god that night. The sun had turned on the Tropic of Capricorn at  noon, and was making his way northward, toward the equator once more;  and his votaries, as was their wont, had all come forth to do him honor  in due season, and to pay their respects, in the inmost and sacredest  grove on the island, to his incarnate representative, the living spirit  of trees and fruits and vegetation, the very high god, the divine  Tu-Kila-Kila!    
Early in the evening, as soon as the sun's rim had disappeared beneath  the ocean, a strange noise boomed forth from the central shrine of  Boupari. Those who heard it clapped their hands to their ears and ran  hastily forward. It was a noise like distant rumbling thunder, or the  whir of some great English mill or factory; and at its sound every woman  on the island threw herself on the ground prostrate, with her face in the  dust, and waited there reverently till the audible voice of the god had  once more subsided. For no woman knew how that sound was produced. Only  the grown men, initiated into the mysteries of the shrine when they came  of age at the tattooing ceremony, were aware that the strange, buzzing,  whirring noise was nothing more or less than the cry of the bull-roarer.    
A bull-roarer, as many English schoolboys know, is merely a piece of  oblong wood, pointed at either end, and fastened by a leather thong at  one corner. But when whirled round the head by practised priestly hands,  it produces a low rumbling noise like the wheels of a distant carriage,  growing gradually louder and clearer, from moment to moment, till at last  it waxes itself into a frightful din, or bursts into perfect peals of  imitation thunder. Then it decreases again once more, as gradually as it  rose, becoming fainter and ever fainter, like thunder as it recedes, till  the horrible bellowing, as of supernatural bulls, dies away in the end,  by slow degrees, into low and soft and imperceptible murmurs.    
But when the savage hears the distant humming of the bull-roarer, at  whatever distance, he knows that the mysteries of his god are in full  swing, and he hurries forward in haste, leaving his work or his pleasure,  and running, naked as he stands, to take his share in the worship, lest  the anger of heaven should burst forth in devouring flames to consume  him. But the women, knowing themselves unworthy to face the dread  presence of the high god in his wrath, rush wildly from the spot, and,  flinging themselves down at full length, with their mouths to the dust,  wait patiently till the voice of their deity is no longer audible.    
And as the bull-roarer on Boupari rang out with wild echoes from the  coral caverns in the central grove that evening, Tu-Kila-Kila, their god,  rose slowly from his place, and stood out from his hut, a deity revealed,  before his reverential worshippers.    
As he rose, a hushed whisper ran wave-like through the dense throng of  dusky forms that bent low, like corn beneath the wind, before him,  "Tu-Kila-Kila rises! He rises to speak! Hush! for the voice of the mighty  man-god!"    
The god, looking around him superciliously with a cynical air of  contempt, stood forward with a firm and elastic step before his silent  worshippers. He was a stalwart savage, in the very prime of life, tall,  lithe, and active. His figure was that of a man well used to command;  but his face, though handsome, was visibly marked by every external sign  of cruelty, lust, and extreme bloodthirstiness. One might have said,  merely to look at him, he was a being debased by all forms of brutal and  hateful self-indulgence. A baleful light burned in his keen gray eyes.  His lips were thick, full, purple, and wistful.    
"My people may look upon me," he said, in a strangely affable  voice, standing forward and smiling with a curious half-cruel,  half-compassionate smile upon his awe-struck followers. "On every day  of the sun's course but this, none save the ministers dedicated to the  service of Tu-Kila-Kila dare gaze unhurt upon his sacred person. If  any other did, the light from his holy eyes would wither them up, and  the glow of his glorious countenance would scorch them to ashes." He  raised his two hands, palm outward, in front of him. "So all the year  round," he went on, "Tu-Kila-Kila, who loves his people, and sends  them the earlier and the later rain in the wet season, and makes their  yams and their taro grow, and causes his sun to shine upon them  freely--all the year round Tu-Kila-Kila, your god, sits shut up in his  own house among the skeletons of those whom he has killed and eaten, or  walks in his walled paddock, where his bread-fruit ripens and his  plantains spring--himself, and the ministers that his tribesmen have  given him."    
At the sound of their mystic deity's voice the savages, bending lower  still till their foreheads touched the ground, repeated in chorus, to the  clapping of hands, like some solemn litany: "Tu-Kila-Kila speaks true.  Our lord is merciful. He sends down his showers upon our crops and  fields. He causes his sun to shine brightly over us. He makes our pigs  and our slaves bring forth their increase. Tu-Kila-Kila is good. His  people praise him."    
The god took another step forward, the divine mantle of red feathers  glowing in the sunset on his dusky shoulders, and smiled once more that  hateful gracious smile of his. He was standing near the open door of his  wattled hut, overshadowed by the huge spreading arms of a gigantic  banyan-tree. Through the open door of the hut it was possible to catch  just a passing glimpse of an awful sight within. On the beams of the  house, and on the boughs of the trees behind it, human skeletons, half  covered with dry flesh, hung in ghastly array, their skulls turned  downward. They were the skeletons of the victims Tu-Kila-Kila, their  prince, had slain and eaten; they were the trophies of the cannibal  man-god's hateful prowess.    
Tu-Kila-Kila raised his right hand erect and spoke again. "I am a great  god," he said, slowly. "I am very powerful. I make the sun to shine, and  the yams to grow. I am the spirit of plants. Without me there would be  nothing for you all to eat or drink in Boupari. If I were to grow old and  die, the sun would fade away in the heavens overhead; the bread-fruit  trees would wither and cease to bear on earth; all fruits would come to  an end and die at once; all rivers would stop forthwith from running."    
His worshippers bowed down in acquiescence with awestruck faces. "It is  true," they answered, in the same slow sing-song of assent as before.  "Tu-Kila-Kila is the greatest of gods. We owe to him everything. We hang  upon his favor."    
Tu-Kila-Kila started back, laughed, and showed his pearly white teeth.  They were beautiful and regular, like the teeth of a tiger, a strong  young tiger. "But I need more sacrifices than all the other gods," he  went on, melodiously, like one who plays with consummate skill upon some  difficult instrument. "I am greedy; I am thirsty; I am a hungry god. You  must not stint me. I claim more human victims than all the other gods  beside. If you want your crops to grow, and your rivers to run, the  fields to yield you game, and the sea fish--this is what I ask: give me  victims, victims! That is our compact. Tu-Kila-Kila calls you."    
The men bowed down once more and repeated humbly, "You shall have victims  as you will, great god; only give us yam and taro and bread-fruit, and  cause not your bright light, the sun, to grow dark in heaven over us."    
"Cut yourselves," Tu-Kila-Kila cried, in a peremptory voice, clapping his  hands thrice. "I am thirsting for blood. I want your free-will offering."    
As he spoke, every man, as by a set ritual, took from a little skin  wallet at his side a sharp flake of coral-stone, and, drawing it  deliberately across his breast in a deep red gash, caused the blood to  flow out freely over his chest and long grass waistband. Then, having  done so, they never strove for a moment to stanch the wound, but let  the red drops fall as they would on to the dust at their feet, without  seeming even to be conscious at all of the fact that they were flowing.    
Tu-Kila-Kila smiled once more, a ghastly self-satisfied smile of  unquestioned power. "It is well," he went on. "My people love me. They  know my strength, how I can wither them up. They give me their blood to  drink freely. So I will be merciful to them. I will make my sun shine and  my rain drop from heaven. And instead of taking <i>all</i>, I will choose one  victim." He paused, and glanced along their line significantly.    
"Choose, Tu-Kila-Kila," the men answered, without a moment's hesitation.  "We are all your meat. Choose which one you will take of us."    
Tu-Kila-Kila walked with a leisurely tread down the lines and surveyed  the men critically. They were all drawn up in rows, one behind the other,  according to tribes and families; and the god walked along each row,  examining them with a curious and interested eye, as a farmer examines  sheep fit for the market. Now and then, he felt a leg or an arm with his  finger and thumb, and hesitated a second. It was an important matter,  this choosing a victim. As he passed, a close observer might have noted  that each man trembled visibly while the god's eye was upon him, and  looked after him askance with a terrified sidelong gaze as he passed on  to his neighbor. But not one savage gave any overt sign or token of his  terror or his reluctance. On the contrary, as Tu-Kila-Kila passed along  the line with lazy, cruel deliberateness, the men kept chanting aloud  without one tremor in their voices, "We are all your meat. Choose which  one you will take of us."    
On a sudden, Tu-Kila-Kila turned sharply round, and, darting a rapid  glance toward a row he had already passed several minutes before, he  exclaimed, with an air of unexpected inspiration, "Tu-Kila-Kila has  chosen. He takes Maloa."    
The man upon whose shoulder the god laid his heavy hand as he spoke stood  forth from the crowd without a moment's hesitation. If anger or fear was  in his heart at all, it could not be detected in his voice or his  features. He bowed his head with seeming satisfaction, and answered  humbly, "What Tu-Kila-Kila says must need be done. This is a great honor.  He is a mighty god. We poor men must obey him. We are proud to be taken  up and made one with divinity."    
Tu-Kila-Kila raised in his hand a large stone axe of some polished green  material, closely resembling jade, which lay on a block by the door, and  tried its edge with his finger, in an abstracted manner. "Bind him!" he  said, quietly, turning round to his votaries. And the men, each glad to  have escaped his own fate, bound their comrade willingly with green ropes  of plantain fibre.    
"Crown him with flowers!" Tu-Kila-Kila said; and a female attendant,  absolved from the terror of the bull-roarer by the god's command, brought  forward a great garland of crimson hibiscus, which she flung around the  victim's neck and shoulders.    
"Lay his head on the sacred stone block of our fathers," Tu-Kila-Kila  went on, in an easy tone of command, waving his hand gracefully. And the  men, moving forward, laid their comrade, face downward, on a huge flat  block of polished greenstone, which lay like an altar in front of the  hut with the mouldering skeletons.    
"It is well," Tu-Kila-Kila murmured once more, half aloud. "You have  given me the free-will offering. Now for the trespass! Where is the  woman who dared to approach too near the temple-home of the divine  Tu-Kila-Kila? Bring the criminal forward!"    
The men divided, and made a lane down their middle. Then one of them, a  minister of the man-god's shrine, led up by the hand, all trembling and  shrinking with supernatural terror in every muscle, a well-formed young  girl of eighteen or twenty. Her naked bronze limbs were shapely and  lissome; but her eyes were swollen and red with tears, and her face  strongly distorted with awe for the man-god. When she stood at last  before Tu-Kila-Kila's dreaded face, she flung herself on the ground in an  agony of fear.    
"Oh, mercy, great God!" she cried, in a feeble voice. "I have sinned, I  have sinned. Mercy, mercy!"    
Tu-Kila-Kila smiled as before, a smile of imperial pride. No ray of pity  gleamed from those steel-gray eyes. "Does Tu-Kila-Kila show mercy?" he  asked, in a mocking voice. "Does he pardon his suppliants? Does he  forgive trespasses? Is he not a god, and must not his wrath be appeased?  She, being a woman, and not a wife sealed to Tu-Kila-Kila, has dared to  look from afar upon his sacred home. She has spied the mysteries.  Therefore she must die. My people, bind her."    
In a second, without more ado, while the poor trembling girl writhed and  groaned in her agony before their eyes, that mob of wild savages, let  loose to torture and slay, fell upon her with hideous shouts, and bound  her, as they had bound their comrade before, with coarse native ropes of  twisted plantain fibre.    
"Lay her head on the stone," Tu-Kila-Kila said, grimly. And his votaries  obeyed him.    
"Now light the sacred fire to make our feast, before I slay the victims,"  the god said, in a gloating voice, running his finger again along the  edge of his huge hatchet.    
As he spoke, two men, holding in their hands hollow bamboos with coals of  fire concealed within, which they kept aglow meanwhile by waving them up  and down rapidly in the air, laid these primitive matches to the base of  a great pyramidal pile of wood and palm-leaves, ready prepared beforehand  in the yard of the temple. In a second, the dry fuel, catching the sparks  instantly, blazed up to heaven with a wild outburst of flame. Great red  tongues of fire licked up the mouldering mass of leaves and twigs, and  caught at once at the trunks of palm and li wood within. A huge  conflagration reddened the sky at once like lightning. The effect was  magical. The glow transfigured the whole island for miles. It was, in  fact, the blaze that Felix Thurstan had noted and remarked upon as he  stood that evening on the silent deck of the Australasian.    
Tu-Kila-Kila gazed at it with horrid childish glee. "A fine fire!" he  said, gayly. "A fire worthy of a god. It will serve me well. Tu-Kila-Kila  will have a good oven to roast his meal in."    
Then he turned toward the sea, and held up his hand once more for  silence. As he did so, an answering light upon its surface attracted his  eye for a moment's space. It was a bright red light, mixed with white and  green ones; in point of fact, the Australasian was passing. Tu-Kila-Kila  pointed toward it solemnly with his plump, brown fore-finger. "See," he  said, drawing himself up and looking preternaturally wise; "your god is  great. I am sending some of this fire across the sea to where my sun has  set, to aid and reinforce it. That is to keep up the fire of the sun,  lest ever at any time it should fade and fail you. While Tu-Kila-Kila  lives the sun will burn bright. If Tu-Kila-Kila were to die it would be  night forever."    
His votaries, following their god's fore-finger as it pointed, all turned  to look in the direction he indicated with blank surprise and  astonishment. Such a sight had never met their eyes before, for the  Australasian was the very first steamer to take the eastward route,  through the dangerous and tortuous Boupari Channel. So their awe and  surprise at the unwonted sight knew no bounds. Fire on the ocean!  Miraculous light on the waves! Their god must, indeed, be a mighty deity  if he could send flames like that careering over the sea! Surely the sun  was safe in the hands of a potentate who could thus visibly reinforce it  with red light, and white! In their astonishment and awe, they stood with  their long hair falling down over their foreheads, and their hands held  up to their eyes that they might gaze the farther across the dim, dark  ocean. The borrowed light of their bonfire was moving, slowly moving over  the watery sea. Fire and water were mixing and mingling on friendly  terms. Impossible! Incredible! Marvellous! Miraculous! They prostrated  themselves in their terror at Tu-Kila-Kila's feet. "Oh, great god," they  cried, in awe-struck tones, "your power is too vast! Spare us, spare us,  spare us!"    
As for Tu-Kila-Kila himself, he was not astonished at all. Strange as it  sounds to us, he really believed in his heart what he said. Profoundly  convinced of his own godhead, and abjectly superstitious as any of his  own votaries, he absolutely accepted as a fact his own suggestion, that  the light he saw was the reflection of that his men had kindled. The  interpretation he had put upon it seemed to him a perfectly natural and  just one. His worshippers, indeed, mere men that they were, might be  terrified at the sight; but why should he, a god, take any special notice  of it?    
He accepted his own superiority as implicitly as our European nobles and  rulers accept theirs. He had no doubts himself, and he considered those  who had little better than criminals.    
By and by, a smaller light detached itself by slow degrees from the  greater ones. The others stood still, and halted in mid-ocean. The lesser  light made as if it would come in the direction of Boupari. In point of  fact, the gig had put out in search of Felix and Muriel.    
Tu-Kila-Kila interpreted the facts at once, however, in his own way.  "See," he said, pointing with his plump forefinger once more, and  encouraging with his words his terrified followers, "I am sending back a  light again from the sun to my island. I am doing my work well. I am  taking care of my people. Fear not for your future. In the light is yet  another victim. A man and a woman will come to Boupari from the sun, to  make up for the man and woman whom we eat in our feast to-night. Give me  plenty of victims, and you will have plenty of yam. Make haste, then;  kill, eat; let us feast Tu-Kila-Kila! To-morrow the man and woman I have  sent from the sun will come ashore on the reef, and reach Boupari."    
At the words, he stepped forward and raised that heavy tomahawk. With  one blow each he brained the two bound and defenceless victims on the  altar-stone of his fathers. The rest, a European hand shrinks from  revealing. The orgy was too horrible even for description.    
And that was the land toward which, that moment, Felix Thurstan was  struggling, with all his might, to carry Muriel Ellis, from the myriad  clasping arms of a comparatively gentle and merciful ocean!
