At the end of the short street on which the Wescotts lived in Willow  Springs there was a cornfield. When Rosalind was a child it was a  meadow and beyond was an orchard.    
On summer afternoons the child often went there to sit alone on the  banks of a tiny stream that wandered away eastward toward Willow Creek,  draining the farmer's fields on the way. The creek had made a slight  depression in the level contour of the land and she sat with her back  against an old apple tree and with her bare feet almost touching the  water. Her mother did not permit her to run bare footed through the  streets but when she got into the orchard she took her shoes off. It  gave her a delightful naked feeling.    
Overhead and through the branches the child could see the great sky.  Masses of white clouds broke into fragments and then the fragments came  together again. The sun ran in behind one of the cloud masses and grey  shadows slid silently over the face of distant fields. The world of her  child life, the Wescott household, Melville Stoner sitting in his  house, the cries of other children who lived in her street, all the  life she knew went far away. To be there in that silent place was like  lying awake in bed at night only in some way sweeter and better. There  were no dull household sounds and the air she breathed was sweeter,  cleaner. The child played a little game. All the apple trees in the  orchard were old and gnarled and she had given all the trees names.  There was one fancy that frightened her a little but was delicious too.  She fancied that at night when she had gone to bed and was asleep and  when all the town of Willow Springs had gone to sleep the trees came  out of the ground and walked about. The grasses beneath the trees, the  bushes that grew beside the fence--all came out of the ground and ran  madly here and there. They danced wildly. The old trees, like stately  old men, put their heads together and talked. As they talked their  bodies swayed slightly--back and forth, back and forth. The bushes and  flowering weeds ran in great circles among the little grasses. The  grasses hopped straight up and down.    
Sometimes when she sat with her back against the tree on warm bright  afternoons the child Rosalind had played the game of dancing-life until  she grew afraid and had to give it up. Nearby in the fields men were  cultivating corn. The breasts of the horses and their wide strong  shoulders pushed the young corn aside and made a low rustling sound.  Now and then a man's voice was raised in a shout. "Hi, there you Joe!  Get in there Frank!" The widow of the hens owned a little woolly dog  that occasionally broke into a spasm of barking, apparently without  cause, senseless, eager, barking. Rosalind shut all the sounds out. She  closed her eyes and struggled, trying to get into the place beyond  human sounds. After a time her desire was accomplished. There was a low  sweet sound like the murmuring of voices far away. Now the thing was  happening. With a kind of tearing sound the trees came up to stand on  top of the ground. They moved with stately tread toward each other. Now  the mad bushes and the flowering weeds came running, dancing madly, now  the joyful grasses hopped. Rosalind could not stay long in her world of  fancy. It was too mad, too joyful. She opened her eyes and jumped to  her feet. Everything was all right. The trees stood solidly rooted in  the ground, the weeds and bushes had gone back to their places by the  fence, the grasses lay asleep on the ground. She felt that her father  and mother, her brother, everyone she knew would not approve of her  being there among them. The world of dancing life was a lovely but a  wicked world. She knew. Sometimes she was a little mad herself and then  she was whipped or scolded. The mad world of her fancy had to be put  away. It frightened her a little. Once after the thing appeared she  cried, went down to the fence crying. A man who was cultivating corn  came along and stopped his horses. "What's the matter?" he asked  sharply. She couldn't tell him so she told a lie. "A bee stung me," she  said. The man laughed. "It'll get well. Better put on your shoes," he  advised.    
The time of the marching trees and the dancing grasses was in  Rosalind's childhood. Later when she had graduated from the Willow  Springs High School and had the three years of waiting about the  Wescott house before she went to the city she had other experiences in  the orchard. Then she had been reading novels and had talked with other  young women. She knew many things that after all she did not know. In  the attic of her mother's house there was a cradle in which she and her  brother had slept when they were babies. One day she went up there and  found it. Bedding for the cradle was packed away in a trunk and she  took it out. She arranged the cradle for the reception of a child. Then  after she did it she was ashamed. Her mother might come up the attic  stairs and see it. She put the bedding quickly back into the trunk and  went down stairs, her cheeks burning with shame.    
What a confusion! One day she went to the house of a schoolgirl friend  who was about to be married. Several other girls came and they were all  taken into a bedroom where the bride's trousseau was laid out on a bed.  What soft lovely things! All the girls went forward and stood over  them, Rosalind among them. Some of the girls were shy, others bold.  There was one, a thin girl who had no breasts. Her body was flat like a  door and she had a thin sharp voice and a thin sharp face. She began to  cry out strangely. "How sweet, how sweet, how sweet," she cried over  and over. The voice was not like a human voice. It was like something  being hurt, an animal in the forest, far away somewhere by itself,  being hurt. Then the girl dropped to her knees beside the bed and began  to weep bitterly. She declared she could not bear the thought of her  schoolgirl friend being married. "Don't do it! O, Mary don't do it!"  she pleaded. The other girls laughed but Rosalind couldn't stand it.  She hurried out of the house.    
That was one thing that had happened to Rosalind and there were other  things. Once she saw a young man on the street. He clerked in a store  and Rosalind did not know him. However her fancy played with the  thought that she had married him. Her own thoughts made her ashamed.    
Everything shamed her. When she went into the orchard on summer  afternoons she sat with her back against the apple tree and took off  her shoes and stockings just as she had when she was a child, but the  world of her childhood fancy was gone, nothing could bring it back.    
Rosalind's body was soft but all her flesh was firm and strong. She  moved away from the tree and lay on the ground. She pressed her body  down into the grass, into the firm hard ground. It seemed to her that  her mind, her fancy, all the life within her, except just her physical  life, went away. The earth pressed upwards against her body. Her body  was pressed against the earth. There was darkness. She was imprisoned.  She pressed against the walls of her prison. Everything was dark and  there was in all the earth silence. Her fingers clutched a handful of  the grasses, played in the grasses.    
Then she grew very still but did not sleep. There was something that  had nothing to do with the ground beneath her or the trees or the  clouds in the sky, that seemed to want to come to her, come into her, a  kind of white wonder of life.    
The thing couldn't happen. She opened her eyes and there was the sky  overhead and the trees standing silently about. She went again to sit  with her back against one of the trees. She thought with dread of the  evening coming on and the necessity of going out of the orchard and to  the Wescott house. She was weary. It was the weariness that made her  appear to others a rather dull stupid young woman. Where was the wonder  of life? It was not within herself, not in the ground. It must be in  the sky overhead. Presently it would be night and the stars would come  out. Perhaps the wonder did not really exist in life. It had something  to do with God. She wanted to ascend upwards, to go at once up into  God's house, to be there among the light strong men and women who had  died and left dullness and heaviness behind them on the earth. Thinking  of them took some of her weariness away and sometimes she went out of  the orchard in the late afternoon walking almost lightly. Something  like grace seemed to have come into her tall strong body.

Rosalind had gone away from the Wescott house and from Willow Springs,  Iowa, feeling that life was essentially ugly. In a way she hated life  and people. In Chicago sometimes it was unbelievable how ugly the world  had become. She tried to shake off the feeling but it clung to her. She  walked through the crowded streets and the buildings were ugly. A sea  of faces floated up to her. They were the faces of dead people. The  dull death that was in them was in her also. They too could not break  through the walls of themselves to the white wonder of life. After all  perhaps there was no such thing as the white wonder of life. It might  be just a thing of the mind. There was something essentially dirty  about life. The dirt was on her and in her. Once as she walked at  evening over the Rush Street bridge to her room on the North Side she  looked up suddenly and saw the chrysoprase river running inland from  the lake. Near at hand stood a soap factory. The men of the city had  turned the river about, made it flow inland from the lake. Someone had  erected a great soap factory there near the river's entrance to the  city, to the land of men. Rosalind stopped and stood looking along the  river toward the lake. Men and women, wagons, automobiles rushed past  her. They were dirty. She was dirty. "The water of an entire sea and  millions of cakes of soap will not wash me clean," she thought. The  dirtiness of life seemed a part of her very being and an almost  overwhelming desire to climb upon the railing of the bridge and leap  down into the chrysoprase river swept over her. Her body trembled  violently and putting down her head and staring at the flooring of the  bridge she hurried away.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
And now Rosalind, a grown woman, was in the Wescott house at the supper  table with her father and mother. None of the three people ate. They  fussed about with the food Ma Wescott had prepared. Rosalind looked at  her mother and thought of what Melville Stoner had said.    
"If I wanted to write I'd do something. I'd tell what everyone thought.  It would startle people, frighten them a little, eh? I would tell what  you have been thinking this afternoon while you walked here on this  railroad track with me. I would tell what your mother has been thinking  at the same time and what she would like to say to you."    
What had Rosalind's mother been thinking all through the three days  since her daughter had so unexpectedly come home from Chicago? What did  mothers think in regard to the lives led by their daughters? Had  mothers something of importance to say to daughters and if they did  when did the time come when they were ready to say it?    
She looked at her mother sharply. The older woman's face was heavy and  sagging. She had grey eyes like Rosalind's but they were dull like the  eyes of a fish lying on a slab of ice in the window of a city meat  market. The daughter was a little frightened by what she saw in her  mother's face and something caught in her throat. There was an  embarrassing moment. A strange sort of tenseness came into the air of  the room and all three people suddenly got up from the table.    
Rosalind went to help her mother with the dishes and her father sat in  a chair by a window and read a paper. The daughter avoided looking  again into her mother's face. "I must gather myself together if I am to  do what I want to do," she thought. It was strange--in fancy she saw  the lean bird-like face of Melville Stoner and the eager tired face of  Walter Sayers floating above the head of her mother who leaned over the  kitchen sink, washing the dishes. Both of the men's faces sneered at  her. "You think you can but you can't. You are a young fool," the men's  lips seemed to be saying.    
Rosalind's father wondered how long his daughter's visit was to last.  After the evening meal he wanted to clear out of the house, go up town,  and he had a guilty feeling that in doing so he was being discourteous  to his daughter. While the two women washed the dishes he put on his  hat and going into the back yard began chopping wood. Rosalind went to  sit on the front porch. The dishes were all washed and dried but for a  half hour her mother would putter about in the kitchen. She always did  that. She would arrange and rearrange, pick up dishes and put them down  again. She clung to the kitchen. It was as though she dreaded the hours  that must pass before she could go upstairs and to bed and asleep, to  fall into the oblivion of sleep.    
When Henry Wescott came around the corner of the house and confronted  his daughter he was a little startled. He did not know what was the  matter but he felt uncomfortable. For a moment he stopped and looked at  her. Life radiated from her figure. A fire burned in her eyes, in her  grey intense eyes. Her hair was yellow like cornsilk. She was, at the  moment, a complete, a lovely daughter of the cornlands, a being to be  loved passionately, completely by some son of the cornlands--had there  been in the land a son as alive as this daughter it had thrown aside.  The father had hoped to escape from the house unnoticed. "I'm going up  town a little while," he said hesitatingly. Still he lingered a moment.  Some old sleeping thing awoke in him, was awakened in him by the  startling beauty of his daughter. A little fire flared up among the  charred rafters of the old house that was his body. "You look pretty,  girly," he said sheepishly and then turned his back to her and went  along the path to the gate and the street.    
Rosalind followed her father to the gate and stood looking as he went  slowly along the short street and around a corner. The mood induced in  her by her talk with Melville Stoner had returned. Was it possible that  her father also felt as Melville Stoner sometimes did? Did loneliness  drive him to the door of insanity and did he also run through the night  seeking some lost, some hidden and half forgotten loveliness?    
When her father had disappeared around the corner she went through the  gate and into the street. "I'll go sit by the tree in the orchard until  mother has finished puttering about the kitchen," she thought.    
Henry Wescott went along the streets until he came to the square about  the court house and then went into Emanuel Wilson's Hardware Store. Two  or three other men presently joined him there. Every evening he sat  among these men of his town saying nothing. It was an escape from his  own house and his wife. The other men came for the same reason. A faint  perverted kind of male fellowship was achieved. One of the men of the  party, a little old man who followed the housepainters trade, was  unmarried and lived with his mother. He was himself nearing the age of  sixty but his mother was still alive. It was a thing to be wondered  about. When in the evening the house painter was a trifle late at the  rendezvous a mild flurry of speculation arose, floated in the air for a  moment and then settled like dust in an empty house. Did the old house  painter do the housework in his own house, did he wash the dishes, cook  the food, sweep and make the beds or did his feeble old mother do these  things? Emanuel Wilson told a story he had often told before. In a town  in Ohio where he had lived as a young man he had once heard a tale.  There was an old man like the house painter whose mother was also still  alive and lived with him. They were very poor and in the winter had not  enough bedclothes to keep them both warm. They crawled into a bed  together. It was an innocent enough matter, just like a mother taking  her child into her bed.    
Henry Wescott sat in the store listening to the tale Emanuel Wilson  told for the twentieth time and thought about his daughter. Her beauty  made him feel a little proud, a little above the men who were his  companions. He had never before thought of his daughter as a beautiful  woman. Why had he never before noticed her beauty? Why had she come  from Chicago, there by the lake, to Willow Springs, in the hot month of  August? Had she come home from Chicago because she really wanted to see  her father and mother? For a moment he was ashamed of his own heavy  body, of his shabby clothes and his unshaven face and then the tiny  flame that had flared up within him burned itself out. The house  painter came in and the faint flavor of male companionship to which he  clung so tenaciously was reestablished.    
In the orchard Rosalind sat with her back against the tree in the same  spot where her fancy had created the dancing life of her childhood and  where as a young woman graduate of the Willow Springs High School she  had come to try to break through the wall that separated her from life.  The sun had disappeared and the grey shadows of night were creeping  over the grass, lengthening the shadows cast by the trees. The orchard  had long been neglected and many of the trees were dead and without  foliage. The shadows of the dead branches were like long lean arms that  reached out, felt their way forward over the grey grass. Long lean  fingers reached and clutched. There was no wind and the night would be  dark and without a moon, a hot dark starlit night of the plains.    
In a moment more it would be black night. Already the creeping shadows  on the grass were barely discernible. Rosalind felt death all about  her, in the orchard, in the town. Something Walter Sayers had once said  to her came sharply back into her mind. "When you are in the country  alone at night sometime try giving yourself to the night, to the  darkness, to the shadows cast by trees. The experience, if you really  give yourself to it, will tell you a startling story. You will find  that, although the white men have owned the land for several  generations now and although they have built towns everywhere, dug coal  out of the ground, covered the land with railroads, towns and cities,  they do not own an inch of the land in the whole continent. It still  belongs to a race who in their physical life are now dead. The red men,  although they are practically all gone still own the American  continent. Their fancy has peopled it with ghosts, with gods and  devils. It is because in their time they loved the land. The proof of  what I say is to be seen everywhere. We have given our towns no  beautiful names of our own because we have not built the towns  beautifully. When an American town has a beautiful name it was stolen  from another race, from a race that still owns the land in which we  live. We are all strangers here. When you are alone at night in the  country, anywhere in America, try giving yourself to the night. You  will find that death only resides in the conquering whites and that  life remains in the red men who are gone."    
The spirits of the two men, Walter Sayers and Melville Stoner,  dominated the mind of Rosalind. She felt that. It was as though they  were beside her, sitting beside her on the grass in the orchard. She  was quite certain that Melville Stoner had come back to his house and  was now sitting within sound of her voice, did she raise her voice to  call. What did they want her of her? Had she suddenly begun to love two  men, both older than herself? The shadows of the branches of trees made  a carpet on the floor of the orchard, a soft carpet spun of some  delicate material on which the footsteps of men could make no sound.  The two men were coming toward her, advancing over the carpet. Melville  Stoner was near at hand and Walter Sayers was coming from far away, out  of the distance. The spirit of him was creeping toward her. The two men  were in accord. They came bearing some male knowledge of life,  something they wanted to give her.    
She arose and stood by the tree, trembling. Into what a state she had  got herself! How long would it endure? Into what knowledge of life and  death was she being led? She had come home on a simple mission. She  loved Walter Sayers, wanted to offer herself to him but before doing so  had felt the call to come home to her mother. She had thought she would  be bold and would tell her mother the story of her love. She would tell  her and then take what the older woman offered. If her mother  understood and sympathized, well that would be a beautiful thing to  have happen. If her mother did not understand--at any rate she would  have paid some old debt, would have been true to some old, unexpressed  obligation.    
The two men--what did they want of her? What had Melville Stoner to do  with the matter? She put the figure of him out of her mind. In the  figure of the other man, Walter Sayers, there was something less  aggressive, less assertive. She clung to that.    
She put her arm about the trunk of the old apple tree and laid her  cheek against its rough bark. Within herself she was so intense, so  excited that she wanted to rub her cheeks against the bark of the tree  until the blood came, until physical pain came to counteract the  tenseness within that had become pain.    
Since the meadow between the orchard and the street end had been  planted to corn she would have to reach the street by going along a  lane, crawling under a wire fence and crossing the yard of the widowed  chicken raiser. A profound silence reigned over the orchard and when  she had crawled under the fence and reached the widow's back yard she  had to feel her way through a narrow opening between a chicken house  and a barn by running her fingers forward over the rough boards.    
Her mother sat on the porch waiting and on the narrow porch before his  house next door sat Melville Stoner. She saw him as she hurried past  and shivered slightly. "What a dark vulture-like thing he is! He lives  off the dead, off dead glimpses of beauty, off dead old sounds heard at  night," she thought. When she got to the Wescott house she threw  herself down on the porch and lay on her back with her arms stretched  above her head. Her mother sat on a rocking chair beside her. There was  a street lamp at the corner at the end of the street and a little light  came through the branches of trees and lighted her mother's face. How  white and still and death-like it was. When she had looked Rosalind  closed her eyes. "I mustn't. I shall lose courage," she thought.    
There was no hurry about delivering the message she had come to  deliver. It would be two hours before her father came home. The silence  of the village street was broken by a hubbub that arose in the house  across the street. Two boys playing some game ran from room to room  through the house, slamming doors, shouting. A baby began to cry and  then a woman's voice protested. "Quit it! Quit it!" the voice called.  "Don't you see you have wakened the baby? Now I shall have a time  getting him to sleep again."    
Rosalind's fingers closed and her hands remained clenched. "I came home  to tell you something. I have fallen in love with a man and can't marry  him. He is a good many years older than myself and is already married.  He has two children. I love him and I think he loves me--I know he  does. I want him to have me too. I wanted to come home and tell you  before it happened," she said speaking in a low clear voice. She  wondered if Melville Stoner could hear her declaration.    
Nothing happened. The chair in which Rosalind's mother sat had been  rocking slowly back and forth and making a slight creaking sound. The  sound continued. In the house across the street the baby stopped  crying. The words Rosalind had come from Chicago to say to her mother  were said and she felt relieved and almost happy. The silence between  the two women went on and on. Rosalind's mind wandered away. Presently  there would be some sort of reaction from her mother. She would be  condemned. Perhaps her mother would say nothing until her father came  home and would then tell him. She would be condemned as a wicked woman,  ordered to leave the house. It did not matter.    
Rosalind waited. Like Walter Sayers, sitting in his garden, her mind  seemed to float away, out of her body. It ran away from her mother to  the man she loved.    
One evening, on just such another quiet summer evening as this one, she  had gone into the country with Walter Sayers. Before that he had talked  to her, at her, on many other evenings and during long hours in the  office. He had found in her someone to whom he could talk, to whom he  wanted to talk. What doors of life he had opened for her! The talk had  gone on and on. In her presence the man was relieved, he relaxed out of  the tenseness that had become the habit of this body. He had told her  of how he had wanted to be a singer and had given up the notion. "It  isn't my wife's fault nor the children's fault," he had said. "They  could have lived without me. The trouble is I could not have lived  without them. I am a defeated man, was intended from the first to be a  defeated man and I needed something to cling to, something with which  to justify my defeat. I realize that now. I am a dependent. I shall  never try to sing now because I am one who has at least one merit. I  know defeat. I can accept defeat."    
That is what Walter Sayers had said and then on the summer evening in  the country as she sat beside him in his car he had suddenly begun to  sing. He had opened a farm gate and had driven the car silently along a  grass covered lane and into a meadow. The lights had been put out and  the car crept along. When it stopped some cattle came and stood nearby.    
Then he began to sing, softly at first and with increasing boldness as  he repeated the song over and over. Rosalind was so happy she had  wanted to cry out. "It is because of myself he can sing now," she had  thought proudly. How intensely, at the moment she loved the man, and  yet perhaps the thing she felt was not love after all. There was pride  in it. It was for her a moment of triumph. He had crept up to her out  of a dark place, out of the dark cave of defeat. It had been her hand  reached down that had given him courage.    
She lay on her back, at her mother's feet, on the porch of the Wescott  house trying to think, striving to get her own impulses clear in her  mind. She had just told her mother that she wanted to give herself to  the man, Walter Sayers. Having made the statement she already wondered  if it could be quite true. She was a woman and her mother was a woman.  What would her mother have to say to her? What did mothers say to  daughters? The male element in life--what did it want? Her own desires  and impulses were not clearly realized within herself. Perhaps what she  wanted in life could be got in some sort of communion with another  woman, with her mother. What a strange and beautiful thing it would be  if mothers could suddenly begin to sing to their daughters, if out of  the darkness and silence of old women song could come.    
Men confused Rosalind, they had always confused her. On that very  evening her father for the first time in years had really looked at  her. He had stopped before her as she sat on the porch and there had  been something in his eyes. A fire had burned in his old eyes as it had  sometimes burned in the eyes of Walter. Was the fire intended to  consume her quite? Was it the fate of women to be consumed by men and  of men to be consumed by women?    
In the orchard, an hour before she had distinctly felt the two men,  Melville Stoner and Walter Sayers coming toward her, walking silently  on the soft carpet made of the dark shadows of trees.    
They were again coming toward her. In their thoughts they approached  nearer and nearer to her, to the inner truth of her. The street and the  town of Willow Springs were covered with a mantle of silence. Was it  the silence of death? Had her mother died? Did her mother sit there now  a dead thing in the chair beside her?    
The soft creaking of the rocking chair went on and on. Of the two men  whose spirits seemed hovering about one, Melville Stoner, was bold and  cunning. He was too close to her, knew too much of her. He was  unafraid. The spirit of Walter Sayers was merciful. He was gentle, a  man of understanding. She grew afraid of Melville Stoner. He was too  close to her, knew too much of the dark, stupid side of her life. She  turned on her side and stared into the darkness toward the Stoner house  remembering her girlhood. The man was too physically close. The faint  light from the distant street lamp that had lighted her mother's face  crept between branches of trees and over the tops of bushes and she  could see dimly the figure of Melville Stoner sitting before his house.  She wished it were possible with a thought to destroy him, wipe him  out, cause him to cease to exist. He was waiting. When her mother had  gone to bed and when she had gone upstairs to her own room to lie awake  he would invade her privacy. Her father would come home, walking with  dragging footsteps along the sidewalk. He would come into the Wescott  house and through to the back door. He would pump the pail of water at  the pump and bring it into the house to put it on the box by the  kitchen sink. Then he would wind the clock. He would--    
Rosalind stirred uneasily. Life in the figure of Melville Stoner had  her, it gripped her tightly. She could not escape. He would come into  her bedroom and invade her secret thoughts. There was no escape for  her. She imagined his mocking laughter ringing through the silent  house, the sound rising above the dreadful commonplace sounds of  everyday life there. She did not want that to happen. The sudden death  of Melville Stoner would bring sweet silence. She wished it possible  with a thought to destroy him, to destroy all men. She wanted her  mother to draw close to her. That would save her from the men. Surely,  before the evening had passed her mother would have something to say,  something living and true.    
Rosalind forced the figure of Melville Stoner out of her mind. It was  as though she had got out of her bed in the room upstairs and had taken  the man by the arm to lead him to the door. She had put him out of the  room and had closed the door.    
Her mind played her a trick. Melville Stoner had no sooner gone out of  her mind than Walter Sayers came in. In imagination she was with Walter  in the car on the summer evening in the pasture and he was singing. The  cattle with their soft broad noses and the sweet grass-flavored breaths  were crowding in close.    
There was sweetness in Rosalind's thoughts now. She rested and waited,  waited for her mother to speak. In her presence Walter Sayers had  broken his long silence and soon the old silence between mother and  daughter would also be broken.    
The singer who would not sing had begun to sing because of her  presence. Song was the true note of life, it was the triumph of life  over death.    
What sweet solace had come to her that time when Walter Sayers sang!  How life had coursed through her body! How alive she had suddenly  become! It was at that moment she had decided definitely, finally, that  she wanted to come closer to the man, that she wanted with him the  ultimate physical closeness--to find in physical expression through him  what in his song he was finding through her.    
It was in expressing physically her love of the man she would find the  white wonder of life, the wonder of which, as a clumsy and crude girl,  she had dreamed as she lay on the grass in the orchard. Through the  body of the singer she would approach, touch the white wonder of life.  "I shall willingly sacrifice everything else on the chance that may  happen," she thought.    
How peaceful and quiet the summer night had become! How clearly now she  understood life! The song Walter Sayers had sung in the field, in the  presence of the cattle was in a tongue she had not understood, but now  she understood everything, even the meaning of the strange foreign  words.    
The song was about life and death. What else was there to sing about?  The sudden knowledge of the content of the song had not come out of her  own mind. The spirit of Walter was coming toward her. It had pushed the  mocking spirit of Melville Stoner aside. What things had not the mind  of Walter Sayers already done to her mind, to the awakening woman  within her. Now it was telling her the story of the song. The words of  the song itself seemed to float down the silent street of the Iowa  town. They described the sun going down in the smoke clouds of a city  and the gulls coming from a lake to float over the city.    
Now the gulls floated over a river. The river was the color of  chrysoprase. She, Rosalind Wescott, stood on a bridge in the heart of  the city and she had become entirely convinced of the filth and  ugliness of life. She was about to throw herself into the river, to  destroy herself in an effort to make herself clean.    
It did not matter. Strange sharp cries came from the birds. The cries  of the birds were like the voice of Melville Stoner. They whirled and  turned in the air overhead. In a moment more she would throw herself  into the river and then the birds would fall straight down in a long  graceful line. The body of her would be gone, swept away by the stream,  carried away to decay but what was really alive in herself would arise  with the birds, in the long graceful upward line of the flight of the  birds.    
Rosalind lay tense and still on the porch at her mother's feet. In the  air above the hot sleeping town, buried deep in the ground beneath all  towns and cities, life went on singing, it persistently sang. The song  of life was in the humming of bees, in the calling of tree toads, in  the throats of negroes rolling cotton bales on a boat in a river.    
The song was a command. It told over and over the story of life and of  death, life forever defeated by death, death forever defeated by life.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
The long silence of Rosalind's mother was broken and Rosalind tried to  tear herself away from the spirit of the song that had begun to sing  itself within her--    
The sun sank down into the western sky over a city--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>   Life defeated by death, <br>   Death defeated by life.</small></i></blockquote><br>
The factory chimneys had become pencils of light--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>   Life defeated by death, <br>   Death defeated by life.</small></i></blockquote><br>
The rocking chair in which Rosalind's mother sat kept creaking. Words  came haltingly from between her white lips. The test of Ma Wescott's  life had come. Always she had been defeated. Now she must triumph in  the person of Rosalind, the daughter who had come out of her body. To  her she must make clear the fate of all women. Young girls grew up  dreaming, hoping, believing. There was a conspiracy. Men made words,  they wrote books and sang songs about a thing called love. Young girls  believed. They married or entered into close relationships with men  without marriage. On the marriage night there was a brutal assault and  after that the woman had to try to save herself as best she could. She  withdrew within herself, further and further within herself. Ma Wescott  had stayed all her life hidden away within her own house, in the  kitchen of her house. As the years passed and after the children came  her man had demanded less and less of her. Now this new trouble had  come. Her daughter was to have the same experience, to go through the  experience that had spoiled life for her.    
How proud she had been of Rosalind, going out into the world, making  her own way. Her daughter dressed with a certain air, walked with a  certain air. She was a proud, upstanding, triumphant thing. She did not  need a man.    
"God, Rosalind, don't do it, don't do it," she muttered over and over.    
How much she had wanted Rosalind to keep clear and clean! Once she also  had been a young woman, proud, upstanding. Could anyone think she had  ever wanted to become Ma Wescott, fat, heavy and old? All through her  married life she had stayed in her own house, in the kitchen of her own  house, but in her own way she had watched, she had seen how things went  with women. Her man had known how to make money, he had always housed  her comfortably. He was a slow, silent man but in his own way he was as  good as any of the men of Willow Springs. Men worked for money, they  ate heavily and then at night they came home to the woman they had  married.    
Before she married, Ma Wescott had been a farmer's daughter. She had  seen things among the beasts, how the male pursued the female. There  was a certain hard insistence, cruelty. Life perpetuated itself that  way. The time of her own marriage was a dim, terrible time. Why had she  wanted to marry? She tried to tell Rosalind about it. "I saw him on the  Main Street of town here, one Saturday evening when I had come to town  with father, and two weeks after that I met him again at a dance out in  the country," she said. She spoke like one who has been running a long  distance and who has some important, some immediate message to deliver.  "He wanted me to marry him and I did it. He wanted me to marry him and  I did it."    
She could not get beyond the fact of her marriage. Did her daughter  think she had no vital thing to say concerning the relationship of men  and women? All through her married life she had stayed in her husband's  house, working as a beast might work, washing dirty clothes, dirty  dishes, cooking food.    
She had been thinking, all through the years she had been thinking.  There was a dreadful lie in life, the whole fact of life was a lie.    
She had thought it all out. There was a world somewhere unlike the  world in which she lived. It was a heavenly place in which there was no  marrying or giving in marriage, a sexless quiet windless place where  mankind lived in a state of bliss. For some unknown reason mankind had  been thrown out of that place, had been thrown down upon the earth. It  was a punishment for an unforgivable sin, the sin of sex.    
The sin had been in her as well as in the man she had married. She had  wanted to marry. Why else did she do it? Men and women were condemned  to commit the sin that destroyed them. Except for a few rare sacred  beings no man or woman escaped.    
What thinking she had done! When she had just married and after her man  had taken what he wanted of her he slept heavily but she did not sleep.  She crept out of bed and going to a window looked at the stars. The  stars were quiet. With what a slow stately tread the moon moved across  the sky. The stars did not sin. They did not touch one another. Each  star was a thing apart from all other stars, a sacred inviolate thing.  On the earth, under the stars everything was corrupt, the trees,  flowers, grasses, the beasts of the field, men and women. They were all  corrupt. They lived for a moment and then fell into decay. She herself  was falling into decay. Life was a lie. Life perpetuated itself by the  lie called love. The truth was that life itself came out of sin,  perpetuated itself only by sin.    
"There is no such thing as love. The word is a lie. The man you are  telling me about wants you for the purpose of sin," she said and  getting heavily up went into the house.    
Rosalind heard her moving about in the darkness. She came to the screen  door and stood looking at her daughter lying tense and waiting on the  porch. The passion of denial was so strong in her that she felt choked.  To the daughter it seemed that her mother standing in the darkness  behind her had become a great spider, striving to lead her down into  some web of darkness. "Men only hurt women," she said, "they can't help  wanting to hurt women. They are made that way. The thing they call love  doesn't exist. It's a lie."    
"Life is dirty. Letting a man touch her dirties a woman." Ma Wescott  fairly screamed forth the words. They seemed torn from her, from some  deep inner part of her being. Having said them she moved off into the  darkness and Rosalind heard her going slowly toward the stairway that  led to the bedroom above. She was weeping in the peculiar half choked  way in which old fat women weep. The heavy feet that had begun to mount  the stair stopped and there was silence. Ma Wescott had said nothing of  what was in her mind. She had thought it all out, what she wanted to  say to her daughter. Why would the words not come? The passion for  denial within her was not satisfied. "There is no love. Life is a lie.  It leads to sin, to death and decay," she called into the darkness.    
A strange, almost uncanny thing happened to Rosalind. The figure of her  mother went out of her mind and she was in fancy again a young girl and  had gone with other young girls to visit a friend about to be married.  With the others she stood in a room where white dresses lay on a bed.  One of her companions, a thin, flat breasted girl fell on her knees  beside the bed. A cry arose. Did it come from the girl or from the old  tired defeated woman within the Wescott house? "Don't do it. O,  Rosalind don't do it," pleaded a voice broken with sobs.    
The Wescott house had become silent like the street outside and like  the sky sprinkled with stars into which Rosalind gazed. The tenseness  within her relaxed and she tried again to think. There was a thing that  balanced, that swung backward and forward. Was it merely her heart  beating? Her mind cleared.    
The song that had come from the lips of Walter Sayers was still singing  within her--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>    Life the conqueror over death, <br>    Death the conqueror over life.</small></i></blockquote><br>
She sat up and put her head into her hands. "I came here to Willow  Springs to put myself to a test. Is it the test of life and death?" she  asked herself. Her mother had gone up the stairway, into the darkness  of the bedroom above.    
The song singing within Rosalind went on--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>    Life the conqueror over death, <br>    Death the conqueror over life.</small></i></blockquote><br>
Was the song a male thing, the call of the male to the female, a lie,  as her mother had said? It did not sound like a lie. The song had come  from the lips of the man Walter and she had left him and had come to  her mother. Then Melville Stoner, another male, had come to her. In him  also was singing the song of life and death. When the song stopped  singing within one did death come? Was death but denial? The song was  singing within herself. What a confusion!    
After her last outcry Ma Wescott had gone weeping up the stairs and to  her own room and to bed. After a time Rosalind followed. She threw  herself onto her own bed without undressing. Both women lay waiting.  Outside in the darkness before his house sat Melville Stoner, the male,  the man who knew of all that had passed between mother and daughter.  Rosalind thought of the bridge over the river near the factory in the  city and of the gulls floating in the air high above the river. She  wished herself there, standing on the bridge. "It would be sweet now to  throw my body down into the river," she thought. She imagined herself  falling swiftly and the swifter fall of the birds down out of the sky.  They were swooping down to pick up the life she was ready to drop,  sweeping swiftly and beautifully down. That was what the song Walter  had sung was about.    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  *  *  *  *  *</small></i></blockquote><br>
Henry Wescott came home from his evening at Emanuel Wilson's store. He  went heavily through the house to the back door and the pump. There was  the slow creaking sound of the pump working and then he came into the  house and put the pail of water on the box by the kitchen sink. A  little of the water spilled. There was a soft little slap--like a  child's bare feet striking the floor--    
Rosalind arose. The dead cold weariness that had settled down upon her  went away. Cold dead hands had been gripping her. Now they were swept  aside. Her bag was in a closet but she had forgotten it. Quickly she  took off her shoes and holding them in her hands went out into the hall  in her stockinged feet. Her father came heavily up the stairs past her  as she stood breathless with her body pressed against the wall in the  hallway.    
How quick and alert her mind had become! There was a train Eastward  bound toward Chicago that passed through Willow Springs at two in the  morning. She would not wait for it. She would walk the eight miles to  the next town to the east. That would get her out of town. It would  give her something to do. "I need to be moving now," she thought as she  ran down the stairs and went silently out of the house.    
She walked on the grass beside the sidewalk to the gate before Melville  Stoner's house and he came down to the gate to meet her. He laughed  mockingly. "I fancied I might have another chance to walk with you  before the night was gone," he said bowing. Rosalind did not know how  much of the conversation between herself and her mother he had heard.  It did not matter. He knew all Ma Wescott had said, all she could say  and all Rosalind could say or understand. The thought was infinitely  sweet to Rosalind. It was Melville Stoner who lifted the town of Willow  Springs up out of the shadow of death. Words were unnecessary. With him  she had established the thing beyond words, beyond passion--the  fellowship in living, the fellowship in life.    
They walked in silence to the town's edge and then Melville Stoner put  out his hand. "You'll come with me?" she asked, but he shook his head  and laughed. "No," he said, "I'll stay here. My time for going passed  long ago. I'll stay here until I die. I'll stay here with my thoughts."    
He turned and walked away into the darkness beyond the round circle of  light cast by the last street lamp on the street that now became a  country road leading to the next town to the east. Rosalind stood to  watch him go and something in his long loping gait again suggested to  her mind the figure of a gigantic bird. "He is like the gulls that  float above the river in Chicago," she thought. "His spirit floats  above the town of Willow Springs. When the death in life comes to the  people here he swoops down, with his mind, plucking out the beauty of  them."    
She walked at first slowly along the road between corn fields. The  night was a vast quiet place into which she could walk in peace. A  little breeze rustled the corn blades but there were no dreadful  significant human sounds, the sounds made by those who lived physically  but who in spirit were dead, had accepted death, believed only in  death. The corn blades rubbed against each other and there was a low  sweet sound as though something was being born, old dead physical life  was being torn away, cast aside. Perhaps new life was coming into the  land.    
Rosalind began to run. She had thrown off the town and her father and  mother as a runner might throw off a heavy and unnecessary garment. She  wished also to throw off the garments that stood between her body and  nudity. She wanted to be naked, new born. Two miles out of town a  bridge crossed Willow Creek. It was now empty and dry but in the  darkness she imagined it filled with water, swift running water, water  the color of chrysoprase. She had been running swiftly and now she  stopped and stood on the bridge her breath coming in quick little  gasps.    
After a time she went on again, walking until she had regained her  breath and then running again. Her body tingled with life. She did not  ask herself what she was going to do, how she was to meet the problem  she had come to Willow Springs half hoping to have solved by a word  from her mother. She ran. Before her eyes the dusty road kept coming up  to her out of darkness. She ran forward, always forward into a faint  streak of light. The darkness unfolded before her. There was joy in the  running and with every step she took she achieved a new sense of  escape. A delicious notion came into her mind. As she ran she thought  the light under her feet became more distinct. It was, she thought, as  though the darkness had grown afraid in her presence and sprang aside,  out of her path. There was a sensation of boldness. She had herself  become something that within itself contained light. She was a creator  of light. At her approach darkness grew afraid and fled away into the  distance. When that thought came she found herself able to run without  stopping to rest and half wished she might run on forever, through the  land, through towns and cities, driving darkness away with her  presence.    
I stated it as definitely as I could. I was in a room with them.    
They had tongues like me, and hair and eyes.    
I got up out of my chair and said it as definitely as I could.    
Their eyes wavered. Something slipped out of their grasp. Had I been  white and strong and young enough I might have plunged through walls,  gone outward into nights and days, gone into prairies, into distances--  gone outward to the doorstep of the house of God, gone to God's throne  room with their hands in mine.    
What I am trying to say is this--    
By God I made their minds flee out of them.    
Their minds came out of them as clear and straight as anything could  be.    
I said they might build temples to their lives.    
I threw my words at faces floating in a street.    
I threw my words like stones, like building stones.    
I scattered words in alleyways like seeds.    
I crept at night and threw my words in empty rooms of houses in a  street.    
I said that life was life, that men in streets and cities might build  temples to their souls.    
I whispered words at night into a telephone.    
I told my people life was sweet, that men might live.    
I said a million temples might be built, that doorsteps might be  cleansed.    
At their fleeing harried minds I hurled a stone.    
I said they might build temples to themselves.
