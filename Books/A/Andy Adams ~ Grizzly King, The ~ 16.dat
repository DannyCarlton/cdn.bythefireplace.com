  Greatly to Muskwa's relief the three men soon turned away from him  and began to busy themselves about the fire. This gave him a chance to  escape, and he pulled and tugged at the end of the rope until he nearly  choked himself to death. Finally he gave up in despair, and crumpling  himself up against the foot of the balsam he began to watch the camp.
  He was not more than thirty feet from the fire. Bruce was washing  his hands in a canvas basin. Langdon was mopping his face with a towel.  Close to the fire Metoosin was kneeling, and from the big black skittle  he was holding over the coals came the hissing and sputtering of fat  caribou steaks, and about the pleasantest smell that had ever come  Muskwa's way. The air all about him was heavy with the aroma of good  things.
  When Langdon had finished drying his face he opened a can of  something. It was sweetened condensed milk. He poured the white fluid  into a basin, and came with it toward Muskwa. The cub had  unsuccessfully attempted flight on the ground until his neck was sore;  now he climbed the tree. He went up so quickly that Langdon was  astonished, and he snarled and spat at the man as the basin of milk was  placed where he would almost fall into it when he came down.
  Muskwa remained at the end of his rope up the tree, and for a long  time the hunters paid no more attention to him. He could see them  eating and he could hear them talking as they planned a new campaign  against Thor.
  &#8220;We've got to trick him after what happened to-day,&#8221; declared Bruce.  &#8220;No more tracking 'im after this, Jimmy. We can track until doomsday  an' he'll always know where we are.&#8221; He paused for a moment and  listened. &#8220;Funny the dogs don't come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wonder&#8212;&#8221;
  He looked at Langdon.
  &#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed the latter, as he read the significance of  his companion's look. &#8220;Bruce, you don't mean to say that bear might  kill them all!&#8221;
  &#8220;I've hunted a good many grizzlies,&#8221; replied the mountaineer  quietly, &#8220;but I ain't never hunted a trickier one than this. Jimmy, he  trapped them dogs on the ledge, an' he tricked the dog he killed up on  the peak. He's liable to get 'em all into a corner, an' if that  happens&#8212;&#8221;
  He shrugged his shoulders suggestively.
  Again Langdon listened.
  &#8220;If there were any alive at dark they should be here pretty soon,&#8221;  he said. &#8220;I'm sorry, now&#8212;sorry we didn't leave the dogs at home.&#8221;
  Bruce laughed a little grimly.
  &#8220;Fortunes o' war, Jimmy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You don't go hunting grizzlies  with a pack of lapdogs, an' you've got to expect to lose some of them  sooner or later. We've tackled the wrong bear, that's all. He's beat  us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Beat us?&#8221;
  &#8220;I mean he's beat us in a square game, an' we dealt a raw hand at  that in using dogs at all. Do you want that bear bad enough to go after  him my way?&#8221;
  Langdon nodded.
  &#8220;What's your scheme?&#8221;
  &#8220;You've got to drop pretty idees when you go grizzly hunting,&#8221; began  Bruce. &#8220;And especially when you run up against a 'killer.' There won't  be any hour between now an' denning-up time that this grizzly doesn't  get the wind from all directions. How? He'll make detours. I'll bet if  there was snow on the ground you'd find him back-tracking two miles out  of every six, so he can get the wind of anything that's following him.  An' he'll travel mostly nights, layin' high up in the rocks an' shale  during the day. If you want any more shootin', there's just two things  to do, an' the best of them two things is to move on and find other  bears.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which I won't do, Bruce. What's your scheme for getting this one?&#8221;
  Bruce was silent for several moments before he replied.
  &#8220;We've got his range mapped out to a mile,&#8221; he said then. &#8220;It begins  up at the first break we crossed, an' it ends down here where we came  into this valley. It's about twenty-five miles up an' down. He don't  touch the mount'ins west of this valley nor the mount'ins east of the  other valleys an' he's dead certain to keep on makin' circles so long  as we're after him. He's hikin' southward now on the other side of the  range.
  &#8220;We'll lay here for a few days an' not move. Then we'll start  Metoosin through the valley over there with the dogs, if there's any  left, and we'll start south through this valley at the same time. One  of us will keep to the slopes an' the other to the bottom, an' we'll  travel slow. Get the idee?
  &#8220;That grizzly won't leave his country, an' Metoosin is pretty near  bound to drive him around to us. We'll let him do the open hunting an'  we'll skulk. The bear can't get past us both without giving one of us  shooting.&#8221;
  &#8220;It sounds good,&#8221; agreed Langdon. &#8220;And I've got a lame knee that I'm  not unwilling to nurse for a few days.&#8221;
  Scarcely were the words out of Langdon's mouth when a sudden rattle  of hobble-chains and the startled snort of a grazing horse out in the  meadow brought them both to their feet.
  &#8220;Utim!&#8221; whispered Metoosin, his dark face aglow in the firelight.
  &#8220;You're right&#8212;the dogs,&#8221; said Bruce, and he whistled softly.
  They heard a movement in the brush near them, and a moment later two  of the dogs came into the firelight. They slunk in, half on their  bellies, and as they prostrated themselves at the hunters' feet a third  and a fourth joined them.
  They were not like the pack that had gone out that morning. There  were deep hollows in their sides; their wiry crests were flat; they  were hard run, and they knew that they were beaten. Their  aggressiveness was gone, and they had the appearance of whipped curs.
  A fifth came in out of the night. He was limping, and dragging a  torn foreleg. The head and throat of one of the others was red with  blood. They all lay flat on their bellies, as if expecting  condemnation.
  &#8220;We have failed,&#8221; their attitude said; &#8220;we are beaten, and this is  all of us that are left.&#8221;
  Mutely Bruce and Langdon stared at them. They listened&#8212;waited. No  other came. And then they looked at each other.
  &#8220;Two more of them gone,&#8221; said Langdon.
  Bruce turned to a pile of panniers and canvases and pulled out the  dog-leashes. Up in his tree Muskwa was all atremble. Within a few yards  of him he saw again the white-fanged horde that had chased Thor and had  driven him into the rock-crevice. Of the men he was no longer greatly  afraid. They had attempted him no harm, and he had ceased to quake and  snarl when one of them passed near. But the dogs were monsters. They  had given battle to Thor. They must have beaten him, for Thor had run  away.
  The tree to which Muskwa was fastened was not much more than a  sapling, and he lay in the saddle of a crotch five feet from the ground  when Metoosin led one of the dogs past him. The Airedale saw him and  made a sudden spring that tore the leash from the Indian's hand. His  leap carried him almost up to Muskwa. He was about to make another  spring when Langdon rushed forward with a fierce cry, caught the dog by  his collar, and with the end of the leash gave him a sound beating.  Then he led him away.
  This act puzzled Muskwa more than ever. The man had saved him. He  had beaten the monster with the red mouth and the white fangs, and all  of those monsters were now being taken away at the end of ropes.
  When Langdon returned he stopped close to Muskwa's tree and talked  to him. Muskwa allowed Langdon's hand to approach within six inches of  him, and did not snap at it. Then a strange and sudden thrill shot  through him. While his head was turned a little Langdon had boldly put  his hand on his furry back. And in the touch there was not hurt! His  mother had never put her paw on him as gently as that!
  Half a dozen times in the next ten minutes Langdon touched him. For  the first three or four times Muskwa bared his two rows of shining  teeth, but he made no sound. Gradually he ceased even to bare his  teeth.
  Langdon left him then, and in a few moments he returned with a chunk  of raw caribou meat. He held this close to Muskwa's nose. Muskwa could  smell it, but he backed away from it, and at last Langdon placed it  beside the basin at the foot of the tree and returned to where Bruce  was smoking.
  &#8220;Inside of two days he'll be eating out of my hand,&#8221; he said.
  It was not long before the camp became very quiet. Langdon, Bruce,  and the Indian rolled themselves in their blankets and were soon  asleep. The fire burned lower and lower. Soon there was only a single  smouldering log. An owl hooted a little deeper in the timber. The drone  of the valley and the mountains filled the peaceful night. The stars  grew brighter. Far away Muskwa heard the rumbling of a boulder rolling  down the side of a mountain.
  There was nothing to fear now. Everything was still and asleep but  himself, and very cautiously he began to back down the tree. He reached  the foot of it, loosed his hold, and half fell into the basin of  condensed milk, a part of it slopping up over his face. Involuntarily  he shot out his tongue and licked his chops, and the sweet, sticky  stuff that it gathered filled him with a sudden and entirely unexpected  pleasure. For a quarter of an hour he licked himself. And then, as if  the secret of this delightful ambrosia had just dawned upon him, his  bright little eyes fixed themselves covetously upon the tin basin. He  approached it with commendable strategy and caution, circling first on  one side of it and then on the other, every muscle in his body prepared  for a quick spring backward if it should make a jump for him. At last  his nose touched the thick, luscious feast in the basin, and he did not  raise his head again until the last drop of it was gone.
  The condensed milk was the one biggest factor in the civilizing of  Muskwa. It was the missing link that connected certain things in his  lively little mind. He knew that the same hand that had touched him so  gently had also placed this strange and wonderful feast at the foot of  his tree, and that same hand had also offered him meat. He did not eat  the meat, but he licked the interior of the basin until it shone like a  mirror in the starlight.
  In spite of the milk, he was still filled with a desire to escape,  though his efforts were not as frantic and unreasoning as they had  been. Experience had taught him that it was futile to jump and tug at  the end of his leash, and now he fell to chewing at the rope. Had he  gnawed in one place he would probably have won freedom before morning,  but when his jaws became tired he rested, and when he resumed his work  it was usually at a fresh place in the rope. By midnight his gums were  sore, and he gave up his exertions entirely.
  Humped close to the tree, ready to climb up it at the first sign of  danger, the cub waited for morning. Not a wink did he sleep. Even  though he was less afraid than he had been, he was terribly lonesome.  He missed Thor, and he whimpered so softly that the men a few yards  away could not have heard him had they been awake. If Pipoonaskoos had  come into the camp then he would have welcomed him joyfully.
  Morning came, and Metoosin was the first out of his blankets. He  built a fire, and this roused Bruce and Langdon. The latter, after he  had dressed himself, paid a visit to Muskwa, and when he found the  basin licked clean he showed his pleasure by calling the others'  attention to what had happened.
  Muskwa had climbed to his crotch in the tree, and again he tolerated  the stroking touch of Langdon's hand. Then Langdon brought forth  another can from a cowhide pannier and opened it directly under Muskwa,  so that he could see the creamy white fluid as it was turned into the  basin. He held the basin up to Muskwa, so close that the milk touched  the cub's nose, and for the life of him Muskwa could not keep his  tongue in his mouth. Inside of five minutes he was eating from the  basin in Langdon's hand! But when Bruce came up to watch the  proceedings the cub bared all his teeth and snarled.
  &#8220;Bears make better pets than dogs,&#8221; affirmed Bruce a little later,  when they were eating breakfast. &#8220;He'll be following you around like a  puppy in a few days, Jimmy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm getting fond of the little cuss already,&#8221; replied Langdon.  &#8220;What was that you were telling me about Jameson's bears, Bruce?&#8221;
  &#8220;Jameson lived up in the Kootenay country,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;Reg'lar  hermit, I guess you'd call him. Came out of the mountains only twice a  year to get grub. He made pets of grizzlies. For years he had one as  big as this fellow we're chasing. He got 'im when a cub, an 'when I saw  him he weighed a thousand pounds an' followed Jameson wherever he went  like a dog. Even went on his hunts with him, an 'they slept beside the  same campfire. Jameson loved bears, an' he'd never kill one.&#8221;
  Langdon was silent. After a moment he said: &#8220;And I'm beginning to  love them, Bruce. I don't know just why, but there's something about  bears that makes you love them. I'm not going to shoot many  more&#8212;perhaps none after we get this dog-killer we're after. I almost  believe he will be my last bear.&#8221; Suddenly he clenched his hands, and  added angrily: &#8220;And to think there isn't a province in the Dominion or  a state south of the Border that has a 'closed season' for bear! It's  an outrage, Bruce. They're classed with vermin, and can be exterminated  at all seasons. They can even be dug out of their dens with their  young&#8212;and&#8212;so help me Heaven!&#8212;I've helped to dig them out! We're  beasts, Bruce. Sometimes I almost think it's a crime for a man to carry  a gun. And yet&#8212;I go on killing.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's in our blood,&#8221; laughed Bruce, unmoved. &#8220;Did you ever know a  man, Jimmy, that didn't like to see things die? Wouldn't every mother's  soul of 'em go to a hanging if they had the chance? Won't they crowd  like buzzards round a dead horse to get a look at a man crushed to a  pulp under a rock or a locomotive engine? Why, Jimmie, if there weren't  no law to be afraid of, we humans'd be killing one another for the fun  of it! We would. It's born in us to want to kill.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we take it all out on brute creation,&#8221; mused Langdon. &#8220;After  all, we can't have much sympathy for ourselves if a generation or two  of us are killed in war, can we? Mebby you're right, Bruce. Inasmuch as  we can't kill our neighbours legally whenever we have the inclination,  it's possible the Chief Arbiter of things sends us a war now and then  to relieve us temporarily of our blood-thirstiness. Hello, what in  thunder is the cub up to now?&#8221;
  Muskwa had fallen the wrong way out of his crotch and was dangling  like the victim at the end of a hangman's rope. Langdon ran to him,  caught him boldly in his bare hands, lifted him up over the limb and  placed him on the ground. Muskwa did not snap at him or even growl.
  Bruce and Metoosin were away from camp all of that day, spying over  the range to the westward, and Langdon was left to doctor a knee which  he had battered against a rock the previous day. He spent most of his  time in company with Muskwa. He opened a can of their griddle-cake  syrup and by noon he had the cub following him about the tree and  straining to reach the dish which he held temptingly just out of reach.  Then he would sit down, and Muskwa would climb half over his lap to  reach the syrup.
  At his present age Muskwa's affection and confidence were easily  won. A baby black bear is very much like a human baby: he likes milk,  he loves sweet things, and he wants to cuddle up close to any living  thing that is good to him. He is the most lovable creature on four  legs&#8212;round and soft and fluffy, and so funny that he is sure to keep  every one about him in good humour. More than once that day Langdon  laughed until the tears came, and especially when Muskwa made  determined efforts to climb up his leg to reach the dish of syrup.
  As for Muskwa, he had gone syrup mad. He could not remember that his  mother had ever given him anything like it, and Thor had produced  nothing better than fish.
  Late in the afternoon Langdon untied Muskwa's rope and led him for a  stroll down toward the creek. He carried the syrup dish and every few  yards he would pause and let the cub have a taste of its contents.  After half an hour of this manoeuvring he dropped his end of the leash  entirely, and walked campward. And Muskwa followed! It was a triumph,  and in Langdon's veins there pulsed a pleasurable thrill which his life  in the open had never brought to him before.
  It was late when Metoosin returned, and he was quite surprised that  Bruce had not shown up. Darkness came, and they built up the fire. They  were finishing supper an hour later when Bruce came in, carrying  something swung over his shoulders. He tossed it close to where Muskwa  was hidden behind his tree.
  &#8220;A skin like velvet, and some meat for the dogs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I shot  it with my pistol.&#8221;
  He sat down and began eating. After a little Muskwa cautiously  approached the carcass that lay doubled up three or four feet from him.  He smelled of it, and a curious thrill shot through him. Then he  whimpered softly as he muzzled the soft fur, still warm with life. And  for a time after that he was very still.
  For the thing that Bruce had brought into camp and flung at the foot  of his tree was the dead body of little Pipoonaskoos!
