McGregor left the telling of the story of his love to Margaret. Edith  Carson who knew defeat so well and who had in her the courage of  defeat was to meet defeat at his hands through the undefeated woman  and he let himself forget the whole matter. For a month he had been  trying to get workingmen to take up the idea of the Marching Men  without success and after the talk with Margaret he kept doggedly at  the work.    
And then one evening something happened that aroused him. The Marching  Men idea that had become more than half intellectualised became again  a burning passion and the matter of his life with women got itself  cleared up swiftly and finally.    
It was night and McGregor stood upon the platform of the Elevated  Railroad at State and Van Buren Streets. He had been feeling guilty  concerning Edith and had been intending to go out to her place but the  scene in the street below fascinated him and he remained standing,  looking along the lighted thoroughfare.    
For a week there had been a strike of teamsters in the city and that  afternoon there had been a riot. Windows had been smashed and several  men injured. Now the evening crowds gathered and speakers climbed upon  boxes to talk. Everywhere there was a great wagging of jaws and waving  of arms. McGregor grew reminiscent. Into his mind came the little  mining town and he saw himself again a boy sitting in the darkness on  the steps before his mother's bake shop and trying to think. Again in  fancy he saw the disorganised miners tumbling out of the saloon to  stand on the street swearing and threatening and again he was filled  with contempt for them.    
And then in the heart of the great western city the same thing  happened that had happened when he was a boy in Pennsylvania. The  officials of the city, having decided to startle the striking  teamsters by a display of force, sent a regiment of state troops  marching through the streets. The soldiers were dressed in brown  uniforms. They were silent. As McGregor looked down they turned out of  Polk Street and came with swinging measured tread up State Street past  the disorderly mobs on the sidewalk and the equally disorderly  speakers on the curb.    
McGregor's heart beat so that he nearly choked. The men in the  uniforms, each in himself meaning nothing, had become by their  marching together all alive with meaning. Again he wanted to shout, to  run down into the street and embrace them. The strength in them seemed  to kiss, as with the kiss of a lover, the strength within himself and  when they had passed and the disorderly jangle of voices broke out  again he got on a car and went out to Edith's with his heart afire  with resolution.    
Edith Carson's millinery shop was in the hands of a new owner. She had  sold out and fled. McGregor stood in the show room looking about him  at the cases filled with their feathery finery and at the hats along  the wall. The light from a street lamp that came in at the window  started millions of tiny motes dancing before his eyes.    
Out of the room at the back of the shop--the room where he had seen  the tears of suffering in Edith's eyes--came a woman who told him of  Edith's having sold the business. She was excited by the message she  had to deliver and walked past the waiting man, going to the screen  door to stand with her back to him and look up the street.    
Out of the corners of her eyes the woman looked at him. She was a  small black-haired woman with two gleaming gold teeth and with glasses  on her nose. "There has been a lovers' quarrel here," she told  herself.    
"I have bought the store," she said aloud. "She told me to tell you  that she had gone."    
McGregor did not wait for more but hurried past the woman into the  street. In his heart was a feeling of dumb aching loss. On an impulse  he turned and ran back.    
Standing in the street by the screen door he shouted hoarsely. "Where  did she go?" he demanded.    
The woman laughed merrily. She felt that she was getting with the shop  a flavour of romance and adventure very attractive to her. Then she  walked to the door and smiled through the screen. "She has only just  left," she said. "She went to the Burlington station. I think she has  gone West. I heard her tell the man about her trunk. She has been  around here for two days since I bought the shop. I think she has been  waiting for you to come. You did not come and now she has gone and  perhaps you won't find her. She did not look like one who would  quarrel with a lover."    
The woman in the shop laughed softly as McGregor hurried away. "Now  who would think that quiet little woman would have such a lover?" she  asked herself.    
Down the street ran McGregor and raising his hand stopped a passing  automobile. The woman saw him seated in the automobile talking to a  grey-haired man at the wheel and then the machine turned and  disappeared up the street at a law-breaking pace.    
McGregor had again a new light on the character of Edith Carson. "I  can see her doing it," he told himself--"cheerfully telling Margaret  that it didn't matter and all the time planning this in the back of  her head. Here all of these years she has been leading a life of her  own. The secret longings, the desires and the old human hunger for  love and happiness and expression have been going on under her placid  exterior as they have under my own."    
McGregor thought of the busy days behind him and realised with shame  how little Edith had seen of him. It was in the days when his big  movement of The Marching Men was just coming into the light and on the  night before he had been in a conference of labour men who had wanted  him to make a public demonstration of the power he had secretly been  building up. Every day his office was filled with newspaper men who  asked questions and demanded explanations. And in the meantime Edith  had been selling her shop to that woman and getting ready to  disappear.    
In the railroad station McGregor found Edith sitting in a corner with  her face buried in the crook of her arm. Gone was the placid exterior.  Her shoulders seemed narrower. Her hand, hanging over the back of the  seat in front of her, was white and lifeless.    
McGregor said nothing but snatched up the brown leather bag that sat  beside her on the floor and taking her by the arm led her up a flight  of stone steps to the street.
