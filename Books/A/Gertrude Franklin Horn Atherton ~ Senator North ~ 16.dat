"Do you dislike her?" asked Betty anxiously of her mother on the night  of Harriet's arrival. "I do not, and yet I feel that I never can love  her--could not even if it were not for <i>that</i>."    
"It is that. You never will love her. I cannot say that she has made  any impression on me whatever, so far. She seems positively congealed.  I suppose she is frightened and worn out, poor thing! She may improve  when she is rested and happier."    
And the next day, as Betty drove her about the city and showed her the  classic public buildings, the parks, white and glittering under a  light fall of snow, the wide avenues in which no one seemed to hurry,  and the stately private dwellings, Harriet's eyes were wide open with  pleasure, and she sat up straight and alert.    
"And I am really to live in this wonderful city?" she exclaimed. "How  long will it be before I shall have seen all the beautiful things  inside those buildings? Do you mean that I can go through all of them?  Why, I never even dreamed that I'd really see the world one day. All I  prayed for was books, more books. And now I'm living in a house with a  right smart library, and you will let me read them all. I don't know  which makes me feel most happy."    
"I will ask my cousin, Mr. Emory, to take you to all the galleries,  and you must go to the White House and shake hands with the  President."    
"Oh, I should like to!" she exclaimed. "I should like to! I should  indeed feel proud." She flushed suddenly and turned away her head.  Betty called her attention hastily to a shop window: they had turned  into F Street. She was determined that the obnoxious subject should  never be mentioned between them if she could help it.    
"I'll take you to New York and show you the shops there," she  continued. "New York was invented that woman might appreciate her  superiority over man."    
"I'd love a yellow satin dress trimmed with red and blue beads," said  Harriet, thoughtfully.    
Betty shuddered. For the moment F Street seemed flaunting with old  Aunty Dinah's bandannas. She replied hurriedly,--    
"You will have all sorts of new ideas by the time you go out of  mourning. I suppose you will wear black for a year."    
"That makes me think. While I'm in black I can't see your fine  friends. I'd like to study. Could I afford a teacher?"    
"You can have a dozen. I've told you that I intend to turn over to you  the money father left me. Mr. Emory will attend to it. You will have  about five hundred dollars a month to do what you like with."    
The girl gasped, then shook her head. "I can't realize that sum," she  said. "But I know it's riches, and I wish--I wish <i>he</i> were alive."    
"If he were you would not have it, for I should not know of you. You  will enjoy having a French teacher and a Professor of Belles Lettres.  Have you any talent for music?"    
"I can play the banjo--"    
"I mean for the piano."    
"I never saw one till yesterday, so I can't say. But I reckon I could  play anything."    
Her Southern brogue was hardly more marked than Jack Emory's, but she  mispronounced many of her words and dropped the final letters of  others: she said "hyah" for "here" and "do'" for "door," and once she  had said "done died." Betty determined to give special instructions to  the Professor.    
Senator Burleigh and Emory dined at the house that evening, and  although Harriet was shy, and blushed when either of the men spoke to  her the deep and tragic novelty of their respectful admiration finally  set her somewhat at her ease, and she talked under her breath to Emory  of the pleasurable impression Washington had made on her rural mind.  After dinner she went with him to the library, where he showed her his  favourite books, and advised her to read them.    
"Will you have a cigarette?" he asked. "Betty accuses me of being old-  fashioned, but I am modern enough to think that a woman and a  cigarette make a charming combination: she looks so companionable."    
"I've smoked a pipe," said Harriet, doubtfully; "but I've never tried  a cigarette. I reckon I could, though."    
He handed her a cigarette, and she smoked with the natural grace which  pervaded all her movements. She sank back in the deep chair she had  chosen, and puffed out the smoke indolently.    
"I am so happy," she said. "I reckoned down there that the world was  beautiful somewhere, but I never expected to see it. And it is, it is.  Poor old uncle used to say that nothing amounted to much when you got  it, but he didn't know, he didn't know. This room is so big, and the  light is so soft, and this chair is so lazy, and the fire is so  warm--" She looked at Emory with the first impulse of coquetry she had  ever experienced; and her eyes were magnificent.    
"Are you, too, happy?" she asked softly.    
He stood up suddenly and gave a little nervous laugh, darting an  embarrasing glance over his shoulder.    
"I feel uncommonly better than usual," he admitted.
