  Cummins returned the next day&#8212;not that his work among the wild   trappers to the south was finished, but because he had suffered a hurt   in falling from a slippery ledge. When Jan, from his wood-chopping in   the edge of the forest, saw the team race up to the little cabin and a   strange Cree half carry the wounded man through the door, he sped   swiftly across the open with visions of new misfortune before him. 
  What he saw when he reached the door was reassuring. Cummins was  upon  his knees beside the cot, his big shoulders hunched over, and  M&eacute;lisse  was welcoming him with her whole vocabulary of sound. The  injury to  Cummins' leg was not serious; and not being serious, it was  accepted  as a special incident of Providence by Jan, for the new  thoughts that  had come into his head were causing him great  uneasiness. 
  He lost no time in revealing his fears, after Maballa had been sent  to  the factor's wife. With graphic gesture he told of what had  happened.  Cummins hobbled to the door to look upon the wallows in the  snow, and  hobbled back to the table when Jan ran there in excited  imitation of  the way in which he had found the little M&eacute;lisse in  Maballa's sling. 
  &quot;She ees ceevilize!&quot; finished Jan hotly. &quot;She ees not papoose! She   mus' be lak&#8212;HER!&quot; His great eyes shone, and Cummins felt a thickening   in his throat as he looked into them and saw what the boy meant.   &quot;Maballa mak papoose out of M&eacute;lisse. She grow&#8212;know not'ing, lak   papoose, talk lak papoose&#8212;&quot; 
  Jan's feelings overwhelmed his tongue. His shining hair rumpled   thickly about his face as he leaned anxiously toward Cummins; and   Cummins, in turn, stared down in dumb perplexity upon the joyful   kickings and wrigglings of the growing problem. 
  &quot;Ees she not ceevilize?&quot; demanded Jan ecstatically, bending his  black  head over her. &quot;Ah, ze sweet M&eacute;lisse!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, she must be like HER, Jan&#8212;just as good and just as sweet and   just as beautiful,&quot; interrupted Cummins gently. 
  There was a quick intaking of his breath as he hobbled back to his  own  cot, leaving Jan at play with the baby. 
  That night, in the dim, sputtering glow of an oil-lamp, John  Cummins  and Jan Thoreau solemnly set to work to thrash out the great  problem  that had suddenly entered into their existence. To these two  there was  no element of humor in what they were doing, for into their  keeping  had been given a thing for which God had not schemed them. The  woman,  had she been there, would have laughed at them, and in a dozen  gentle  breaths might have told them all that the world held in secret  between  mother and child; but, leaving them, she had passed on to them   something that was life, like herself, and yet mystery. 
  Had fate given Maballa to M&eacute;lisse for a mother there would have  been  no mystery. She would have developed as naturally as a wolf-whelp  or a  lynx-kitten, a savage breath of life in a savage world, waxing  fat in  snow-baths, arrow-straight in papoose-slings, a moving, natural  thing  in a desolation to which generations and centuries of forebears  had  given it birthright. But M&eacute;lisse was like her mother. In the  dreams of  the two who were planning out her fate, she was to be a  reincarnation  of her mother. That dream left a ray of comfort in  Cummins' breast  when his wife died. It stirred happy visions within  Jan. And it ended  with a serious shock when Maballa brought into their  mental  perspective of things the possibilities of environment. 
  So far as Cummins knew, there was not a white woman nearer than  Fort  Churchill, two hundred miles away. In all that region he knew of  only  two full-white men, and they were Williams and himself. The baby   M&eacute;lisse was hopelessly lost in a world of savagery; honest, loyal,   big-souled savagery&#8212;but savagery for all that, and the thought of it   brought the shadows of fear and foreboding to the two into whose lives   the problem had just come. 
  Long into the night they talked seriously of the matter, while  M&eacute;lisse  slept; and the longer they talked, the greater loomed the  problem  before them. Cummins fancied that he already began to see  signs of the  transformation in M&eacute;lisse. She was passionately fond of  the gaudy  things Maballa gave her, which was a sign of savagery. She  was charmed  by confinement in the papoose-sling, which was another  sign of it; and  she had not died in the snow-wallows&#8212;which was still  another. 
  So far back as he could remember, Cummins had never come into  finger-  touch of a white baby. Jan was as blissfully ignorant; so they   determined upon immediate and strenuous action. Maballa would be   ceaselessly watched and checked at every turn. The Indian children   would not be allowed to come near M&eacute;lisse. They two&#8212;John Cummins and   Jan Thoreau&#8212;would make her like the woman who slept under the   sentinel spruce. 
  &quot;She ees ceevilize,&quot; said Jan with finality, &quot;an' we mus' keep her   ceevilize!&quot; 
  Cummins counted back gravely upon his fingers. The little M&eacute;lisse  was  four months and eighteen days old! 
  &quot;To-morrow we will make her one of those things with wheels&#8212;like  the  baby-wagons they have in the South,&quot; he said. &quot;She must not go in  the  papoose-slings!&quot; 
  &quot;An' I will teach her ze museek,&quot; whispered Jan, his eyes glowing.   &quot;That ees ceevilize!&quot; 
  Suddenly an eager light came into Cummins' face, and he pointed to  a  calico-covered box standing upon end in a corner of the room. 
  &quot;There are the books&#8212;HER books, Jan,&quot; he said softly, the  trembling  thrill of inspiration in his voice. He limped across the  room, dropped  upon his knees before the box, and drew back the  curtain. Jan knelt  beside him. &quot;They were HER books,&quot; he repeated.  There was a sobbing  catch in his throat, and his head fell a little  upon his breast. &quot;Now  &#8212;we will give them&#8212;to M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  He drew the books out, one by one, his fingers trembling and his   breath coming quickly as he touched them&#8212;a dozen worn, dusty things,   holding within them more than John Cummins would ever know of the   woman he had lost. These volumes of dead voices had come with her into   the wilderness from that other world she had known. They breathed the   pathos of her love from out of their ragged pages, mended in a hundred   places to keep them from falling into utter ruin. Slowly the man   gathered them against his breast, and held them there silently, as he   might have held the woman, fighting hard to keep back his grief. 
  Jan thrust a hand deeper into the box, and brought forth something   else&#8212;a few magazines and papers, as ragged and worn as the books. In   these other treasures there were pictures&#8212;pictures of the things in   civilization, which Jan had never seen, and which were too wonderful   for him to comprehend at first. His eyes burned excitedly as he held   up a gaudily covered fashion paper to John Cummins. 
  &quot;Theese are picture for M&eacute;lisse!&quot; he whispered tensely. &quot;We teach  her  &#8212;we show her&#8212;we mak her know about ceevilize people!&quot; 
  Cummins replaced the books, one at a time, and each he held  tenderly  for a moment, wiping and blowing away the dust gathered upon  it. At  the last one of all, which was more ragged and worn than the  others,  he gazed for a long time. It was a little Bible, his wife's  Bible,  finger-worn, patched, pathetic in its poverty. The man gulped  hard. 
  &quot;She loved this, Jan,&quot; he said huskily. &quot;She loved this worn, old  book  more than anything else, and little M&eacute;lisse must love it also.  M&eacute;lisse  must be a Christian.&quot; 
  &quot;Ah, yes, ze leetle M&eacute;lisse mus' love ze great God!&quot; said Jan  softly. 
  Cummins rose to his feet and stood for a moment looking at the   sleeping baby. 
  &quot;A missionary is coming over from Fort Churchill to talk to our   trappers when they come in. She shall be baptized!&quot; 
  Like a cat Jan was on his feet, his eyes flashing, his long, thin   fingers clenched, his body quivering with a terrible excitement. 
  &quot;No&#8212;no&#8212;not baptize by missioner!&quot; he cried. &quot;She shall be good,  an'  love ze great God, but not baptize by missioner! No&#8212;no&#8212;no!&quot; 
  Cummins turned upon him in astonishment. Before him Jan Thoreau  stood  for a minute like one gone mad, his whole being consumed in a  passion  terrible to look upon. Lithe giant of muscle and, fearlessness  that he  was, Cummins involuntarily drew back a step, and the  mainspring of  instinct within him prompted him to lift a hand, as if  to ward off a  leaping thing from his breast. 
  Jan noted the backward step, the guarded uplift of hand, and with  an  agonized cry he buried his face in his hands. In another instant he   had turned, and, before Cummins' startled voice found words, had   opened the door and run out into the night. The man saw him darting   swiftly toward the forest, and called to him, but there was no   response. 
  There was a hot fire burning in Jan's brain, a blazing, writhing   contortion of things that brought a low moaning from his lips. He ran   tirelessly and swiftly until he sank down upon the snow in a silent   place far from where he had left John Cummins. His eyes still blazed   with their strange fire upon the desolation about him, his fingers   clenched and unclenched themselves, digging their nails into his   flesh, and he spoke softly to himself, over and over again, the name   of the little M&eacute;lisse. 
  Painting itself each instant more plainly through the tumult of his   emotions was what Jan had come to know as the picture in his brain.   Shadowy and indistinct at first, in pale, elusive lines of mental   fabric, he saw the picture growing; and in its growth he saw first the   soft, sweet outlines of a woman's face, and then great luring eyes,   dark like his own&#8212;and before these eyes, which gazed upon him with   overwhelming love, all else faded away from before Jan Thoreau. The   fire went out of his eyes, his fingers relaxed, and after a little   while he got up out of the snow, shivering, and went back to the   cabin. 
  Cummins asked no questions. He looked at Jan from his cot, and  watched  the boy silently as he undressed and went to bed; and in the  morning  the whole incident passed from his mind. The intangible holds  but  little fascination for the simple folk who live under the Arctic   Circle. Their struggle is with life, their joys are in its   achievement, in their constant struggle to keep life running strong   and red within them. Such an existence of solitude and of strife with   nature leaves small room for curiosity. So the nature of John Cummins   led him to forget what had happened, as he would have forgotten the   senseless running away of a sledge-dog, and its subsequent return. He   saw no tragedy, and no promise of tragedy, in the thing that had   occurred. 
  There was no recurrence of the strange excitement in Jan. He gave  no  hint of it in word or action, and the thing seemed to be forgotten   between the two. 
  The education of the little M&eacute;lisse began at once, while the post  was  still deserted. It began, first of all, with Maballa. She stared   dumbly and with shattered faith at these two creatures who told her of   wonderful things in the upbringing of a child&#8212;things of which she had   never so much as heard rumor before. Her mother instincts were   aroused, but with Cree stoicism she made no betrayal of them. 
  The leather-tanned immobility of her face underwent no whit of  change  when Cummins solemnly declared that the little M&eacute;lisse was  about to  begin teething. She sat grimly and watched them in silence  when  between them, upon a bearskin stretched on the floor, they tried   vainly to persuade M&eacute;lisse to use her feet. 
  It was great fun for M&eacute;lisse, and she enjoyed it immensely; so that  as  the days passed, and the post still remained deserted, John Cummins   and Jan Thoreau spent much of their time upon their knees. In their   eyes, the child's progress was remarkable. They saw in her an   unceasing physical growth, and countless symptoms of forthcoming   mental development. She delighted to pull the strings of Jan's violin,   which was an unmistakable token of her musical genius. She went into   ecstasies over the gaudy plates in the fashion paper. She fingered   them in suggestive and inquiring silence, or with still more   suggestive grunts, and made futile efforts to eat them, which was the   greatest token of all. 
  Weeks passed, and Williams came in from the southern forests. Mukee   followed him from the edge of the barrens. Per-ee returned from the   Eskimo people, three-quarters starved and with half of his dogs   stolen. From the north, east, west, and south the post's fur-rangers   trailed back. Life was resumed. There was a softness in the air, a   growing warmth in the midday sun. The days of the big change were   near. And when they came, John Cummins and Jan Thoreau, of all the   factor's people, wore patches at their knee.
