  Philip did not see the hundred staring eyes that followed in   wonderment the tall, beautiful girl who walked at his side. He  knew  that Miss Brokaw was talking and laughing, and that he was  nodding his  head and answering her, while his brain raged for an  idea that would  give him an excuse for leaving her to follow  Jeanne and Pierre. The  facts that Gregson had left him so  strangely, that Eileen had come  with her father, and that, instead  of clearing up the mystery in which  they were so deeply involved,  the arrival of the London ship had even  more hopelessly entangled  them, were forgotten for the moment in the  desire to intercept  Jeanne and Pierre before they could leave  Churchill. Miss Brokaw  herself unconsciously gave him the opportunity  for which he was  seeking. 
  &quot;You don't look very happy, Philip,&quot; she exclaimed, in a chiding   voice, meant only for his ears. &quot;I thought&#8212;perhaps&#8212;my coming  would  make you glad.&quot; 
  Philip caught eagerly at the half question in her voice. 
  &quot;I feared you would notice it,&quot; he said, quickly. &quot;I was afraid   you would think me indifferent because I did not go out to meet  you  in the boat, and because I stood hidden at the end of the pier  when  you landed. But I was looking for a man. I have been hunting  for him  for a long time. And I saw his face just as we came  through the crowd.  That is why I am&#8212;am rattled,&quot; he laughed.  &quot;Will you excuse me if I go  back? Can you find some excuse for the  others? I will return in a few  minutes, and then you will not say  that I am unhappy.&quot; 
  Miss Brokaw drew her hand from his arm. 
  &quot;Surely I will excuse you,&quot; she cried. &quot;Hurry, or you may lose   him. I would like to go with you if it is going to be exciting.&quot; 
  Philip turned to Brokaw and the factor, who were close behind   them. 
  &quot;I am compelled to leave you here,&quot; he explained. &quot;I have excused   myself to Miss Brokaw, and will rejoin you almost immediately.&quot; 
  He lost no time in hurrying back to the shore of the Bay. As he   had expected, Jeanne and her companion were no longer in sight.  There  was only one direction in which they could have disappeared  so  quickly, and this was toward the cliff. Once hidden by the  fringe of  forest, he hastened his steps until he was almost  running. He had  reached the base of the huge mass of rock that  rose up from the sea,  when down the narrow trail that led to the  cliff there came a figure  to meet him. It was an Indian boy, and  he advanced to question him. If  Jeanne and Pierre had passed that  way the boy must surely have seen  them. 
  Before he had spoken the lad ran toward him, holding out something   in his hand. The question on Philip's lips changed to an  exclamation  of joy when he recognized the handkerchief which he  had dropped upon  the rock a few nights before, or one so near like  it that he could not  have told them apart. It was tied into a  knot, and he felt the  crumpling of paper under the pressure of his  fingers. He almost tore  the bit of lace and linen in his eagerness  to rescue the paper, which  a moment later he held in his fingers.  Three short lines, written in a  fine, old-fashioned hand, were all  that it held for him. But they were  sufficient to set his heart,  beating wildly. 
  Will Monsieur come to the top of the rock to-night, some time   between the hours of nine and ten. 
  There was no signature to the note, but Philip knew that only   Jeanne could have written it, for the letters were almost of   miscroscopic smallness, as delicate as the bit of lace in which  they  had been delivered, and of a quaintness of style which added  still  more to the bewildering mystery which already surrounded  these people.  He read the lines half a dozen times, and then  turned to find that the  Indian boy was slipping sway through the  rocks. 
  &quot;Here&#8212;you,&quot; he commanded, in English. &quot;Come back!&quot; 
  The boy's white teeth gleamed in a laugh as he waved his hand and   leaped farther away. From Philip his eyes shifted in a quick,   searching glance to the top of the cliff. In a flash Philip  followed  its direction. He understood the meaning of the look.  From the cliff  Jeanne and Pierre had seen his approach, and their  meeting with the  Indian boy had made it possible for them to  intercept him in this  manner. They were probably looking down upon  him now, and in the  gladness of the moment Philip laughed up at  the bare rocks and waved  his cap above his head as a signal of his  acceptance of the strange  invitation he had received. 
  Vaguely he wondered why they had set the meeting for that night,   when in three or four minutes he could have joined them up there  in  broad day. But the central tangle of the mystery that had grown  up  about him during the past few days was too perplexing to  embroider  with such a minor detail as this, and he turned back  toward Churchill  with the feeling that everything was working in  his favor. During the  next few hours he would clear up the tangle,  and in addition to that  he would meet Jeanne and Pierre. It was  the thought of Jeanne, and not  of the surprises which he was about  to explain, that stirred his blood  as he hurried back to the Fort. 
  It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father. But he   changed this. He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work   there. He knew that the artist would be expecting him, and he went   directly to the cabin, escaping notice by following along the  fringe  of the forest. 
  Gregson was pacing back and forth across the cabin floor when   Philip arrived. His steps were quick and excited. His hands were   thrust deep in his trousers pockets. The butts of innumerable   half-smoked cigarettes lay scattered under his feet. He ceased his   restless movement upon his companion's interruption, and for a  moment  or two gazed at Philip in blank silence. 
  &quot;Well,&quot; he said, at last, &quot;have you got anything to say?&quot; 
  &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Philip. &quot;It's beyond me, Greggy. For Heaven's sake   give me an explanation!&quot; 
  There was nothing womanish in the hard lines of Gregson's face   now. He spoke with the suggestion of a sneer. 
  &quot;You knew&#8212;all the time,&quot; he said, coldly. &quot;You knew that Miss   Brokaw and the girl whom I drew were one and the same person. What   was the object of your little sensation?&quot; 
  Philip ignored his question. He stepped quickly up to Gregson and   seized him by the arm. 
  &quot;It is impossible!&quot; he cried, in a low voice. &quot;They cannot be the   same person. That ship out there has not touched land since she  left  Halifax. Until she hove in sight off Churchill she hasn't  been within  two hundred miles of a coast this side of Hudson's  Strait. Miss Brokaw  is as new to this country as you. It is beyond  all reason to suppose  anything else.&quot; 
  &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; said Gregson, quietly, &quot;it was Miss Brokaw whom I   saw the other day, and that is Miss Brokaw's picture.&quot; 
  He pointed to the sketch, and freed his arm to light another   cigarette. There was a peculiar tone of finality in his voice  which  warned Philip that no amount of logic or arguing on his part  would  change his friend's belief. Gregson looked at him over his  lighted  match. 
  &quot;It was Miss Brokaw,&quot; he said again. &quot;Perhaps it is within reason   to suppose that she came to Churchill in a balloon, dropped into  town  for luncheon, and departed in a balloon, descending by some  miraculous  chance aboard the ship that was bringing her father.  However it may  have happened, she was in Churchill a few days ago.  On that hypothesis  I am going to work, and as a consequence I am  going to ask you for the  indefinite loan of the Lord Fitzhugh  letter. Will you give me your  word to say nothing of that letter&#8212;  for a few days?&quot; 
  &quot;It is almost necessary to show it to Brokaw,&quot; hesitated Philip. 
  &quot;Almost&#8212;but not quite,&quot; Gregson caught him up. &quot;Brokaw knows the   seriousness of the situation without that letter. See here, Phil&#8212;   you go out and fight, and let me handle this end of the business.   Don't reveal me to the Brokaws. I don't want to meet&#8212;her&#8212;yet,   though God knows if it wasn't for my confounded friendship for you   I'd go over there with you this minute. She was even more  beautiful  than when I saw her&#8212;before.&quot; 
  &quot;Then there is a difference,&quot; laughed Philip, meaningly. 
  &quot;Not a difference, but a little better view,&quot; corrected the   artist. 
  &quot;Now, if we could only find the other girl, what a mess you'd be   in, Greggy! By George, but this is beginning to have its humorous  as  well as its tragic side. I'd give a thousand dollars to have  this  other golden-haired beauty appear upon the scene!&quot; 
  &quot;I'll give a thousand if you produce her,&quot; retorted Gregson. 
  &quot;Good!&quot; laughed Philip, holding out a hand. &quot;I'll report again   this afternoon or to-night.&quot; 
  Inwardly he felt himself in no humorous mood as he retraced his   steps to Churchill. He had thought to begin his work of clearing  up  the puzzling situation with Gregson, and Gregson had failed him   completely by his persistence in the belief that Miss Brokaw was  the  girl whose face he had seen more than a week before. Was it  possible,  after all, that the ship had touched at some point up  the coast? The  supposition was preposterous. Yet before rejoining  the Brokaws he  sought out the captain and found that the company's  vessel had come  directly from Halifax without a change or stop in  her regular course.  The word of the company's captain cleared up  his doubts in one  direction; it mystified him more than ever in  another. He was  convinced that Gregson had not seen Miss Brokaw  until that morning.  But who was Eileen's double? Where was she at  this moment? What  peculiar combination of circumstance had drawn  them both to Churchill  at this particularly significant time? It  was impossible for him not  to associate the girl whom Gregson had  encountered, and who so closely  resembled Eileen, with Lord  Fitzhugh and the plot against his company.  And it struck him with  a certain feeling of dread that, if his  suspicions were true,  Jeanne and Pierre must also be mixed up in the  affair. For had not  Jeanne, in her error, greeted Eileen as though she  were a dear  friend? 
  He went directly to the factor's house, and knocked at the door   opening into the rooms occupied by Brokaw and his daughter. Brokaw   admitted him, and at Philip's searching glance about the room he   nodded toward a closed inner door and said: 
  &quot;Eileen is resting. It's been a hard trip on her, Phil, and she   hasn't slept for two consecutive nights since we left Halifax.&quot; 
  Philip's keen glance told him that Brokaw himself had not slept   much. The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under   them. But otherwise he betrayed no signs of unrest or lack of  rest.  He motioned Philip to a chair close to a huge fireplace in  which a  pile of birch was leaping into flame, offered him a cigar,  and plunged  immediately into business. 
  &quot;It's hell, Philip,&quot; he said, in a hard, quiet voice, as though he   were restraining an outburst of passion with effort. &quot;In another   three months we'd have been on a working basis, earning dividends.   I've even gone to the point of making contracts that show us five   hundred per cent, profit. And now&#8212;this!&quot; 
  He dashed his half-burned cigar into the fire, and viciously bit   the end from another. 
  Philip was lighting his own, and there was a moment's silence,   broken sharply by the financier. 
  &quot;Are your men prepared to fight?&quot; 
  &quot;If it's necessary,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;We can at least depend upon   a part of them, especially the men at Blind Indian Lake. But&#8212;this   fighting&#8212;Why do you think it will come to that? If there is  fighting  we are ruined.&quot; 
  &quot;If the people rise against us in a body&#8212;yes, we are ruined. That   is what we must not permit. It is our one chance. I have done   everything in my power to beat this movement against us down  south,  and have failed. Our enemies are completely masked. They  have won  popular sentiment through the newspapers. Their next move  is to strike  directly at us. Whatever is to happen will happen  soon. The plan is to  attack us, to destroy our property, and the  movement is to be  advertised as a retaliation for heinous outrages  perpetrated by our  men. It is possible that the attack will not be  by northerners alone,  but by men brought in for the purpose. The  result will be the same&#8212;if  it succeeds. The attack is planned to  be a surprise. Our one chance is  to meet it, to completely  frustrate it&#8212;to strike an overwhelming  blow, and to capture  enough of our assailants to give us the evidence  we must have.&quot; 
  Brokaw was excited. He emphasized his words with angry sweeps of   his arms. He clenched his fists, and his face grew red. He was not   like the old, shrewd, indomitable Brokaw, completely master of   himself, never revealing himself beyond the unruffled veil of his   self-possession, and Philip was surprised. He had expected that   Brokaw's wily brain would bring with it half a dozen schemes for  the  quiet undoing of their enemies. And now here was Brokaw, the  man who  always hedged himself in with legal breast-works&#8212;who  never revealed  himself to the shot of his enemies&#8212;enlisting  himself for a fight in  the open! Philip had told Gregson that  there would be a fight. He was  firmly convinced that there would  be a fight. But he had never  believed that Brokaw would come to  join in it. He leaned toward the  financier, his face flushed a  little by the warmth of the fire and by  the knowledge that Brokaw  was relinquishing the situation entirely  into his hands. If it  came to fighting, he would win. He was confident  of himself there.  But&#8212; 
  &quot;What will be the result if we win?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;If we secure those who will give the evidence we need&#8212;evidence   that the movement against us is a plot to destroy our company, the   government will stand by us,&quot; replied Brokaw. &quot;I have sounded the   situation there. I have filed a formal declaration to the effect  that  such a movement is on foot, and have received a promise that  the  commissioner of police will investigate the matter. But before  that  happens our enemies will strike. There is no time for red  tape or  investigations. We must achieve our own salvation. And to  achieve that  we must fight.&quot; 
  &quot;And if we lose?&quot; 
  Brokaw lifted his hands and shoulders with a significant gesture. 
  &quot;The moral effect will be tremendous,&quot; he said. &quot;It will be shown   that the entire north is inimical to our company, and the  government  will withdraw our option. We will be ruined. Our  stockholders will  lose every cent invested.&quot; 
  In moments of mental energy Philip was restless. He rose from his   chair now and moved softly back and forth across the carpeted  floor  of the big room, shrouded in tobacco smoke. Should he break  his word  to Gregson and tell Brokaw of Lord Fitzhugh? But, on  second thought,  what good would come of it? Brokaw was already  aware of the  seriousness of the situation. In some one of his  unaccountable ways he  had learned that their enemies were to  strike almost immediately, and  his own revelation of the Fitzhugh  letters would but strengthen this  evidence. He would keep his  faith with Gregson for the promised day or  two. For an hour the  two men were alone in the room. At the end of  that time their  plans were settled. The next morning Philip would  leave for Blind  Indian Lake and prepare for war. Brokaw would follow  two or three  days later. 
  A heavy weight seemed lifted from Philip's shoulders when he left   Brokaw. After months of worry and weeks of physical inaction he  saw  his way clear for the first time. And for the first time, too,   something seemed to have come into his life that filled him with a   strange exhilaration, and made him forgetful of the gloom that had   settled over him during these last months. That night he would see   Jeanne. His body thrilled at the thought, until for a time he  forgot  that he would also see and talk with Eileen. A few days  before he had  told Gregson that it would be suicidal to fight the  northerners; now  he was eager for action, eager to begin and end  the affair&#8212;to win or  lose. If he had stopped to analyze the  change in himself he would have  found that the beautiful girl whom  he had first seen on the moonlit  rock was at the bottom of it. And  yet Jeanne was a northerner, one of  those against whom his actions  must be directed. But he had confidence  in himself, confidence in  what that night would bring forth. He was  like one freed from a  bondage that had oppressed him for a long time,  and the fact that  he might be compelled to fight Jeanne's own people  did not destroy  his hopefulness, the new joy and excitement that he  had found in  life. As he hurried back to his cabin he told himself  that both  Jeanne and Pierre had read what he had sent to them in the   handkerchief; their response was a proof that they understood him,   and deep down a voice kept telling him that if it came to fighting   they three, Pierre, Jeanne, and himself, would rise or fall  together.  A few hours had transformed him into Gregson's old  appreciation of the  fighting man. Long and tedious months of  diplomacy, of political  intrigue, of bribery and dishonest  financiering, in which he had  played but the part of a helpless  machine, were gone. Now he held the  whip-hand; Brokaw had  acknowledged his own surrender. He was to  fight&#8212;a clean, fair  fight on his part, and his blood leaped in every  vein like  marshaling armies. That nights on the rock, he would reveal   himself frankly to Pierre and Jeanne. He would tell them of the  plot  to disrupt the company, and of the work ahead of him. And  after that&#8212; 
  He thrust open the door of his cabin, eager to enlist Gregson in   his enthusiasm. The artist was not in. Philip noticed that the   cartridge-belt and the revolver which usually hung over Gregson's   bunk were gone. He never entered the cabin without looking at the   sketch of Eileen Brokaw. Something about it seemed to fascinate  him,  to challenge his presence. Now it was missing from the wall. 
  He threw off his coat and hat, filled his pipe, and began   gathering up his few possessions, ready for packing. It was noon   before he was through, and Gregson had not returned. He boiled   himself some coffee and sat down to wait. At five o'clock he was  to  eat supper with the Brokaws and the factor; Eileen, through her   father, had asked him to join her an hour or two earlier in the  big  room. He waited until four, and then left a brief note for  Gregson  upon the table. 
  It was growing dusk in the forest. From the top of the ridge   Philip caught the last red glow of the sun, sinking far to the  south  and west. A faint radiance of it still swept over his head  and mingled  with the thickening gray gloom of the northern sea.  Across the dip in  the Bay the huge, white-capped cliff seemed to  loom nearer and more  gigantic in the whimsical light. For a few  moments a red bar shot  across it, and as the golden fire faded and  died away Philip could not  but think it was like a torch beckoning  to him. A few hours more, and  where that light had been he would  see Jeanne. And now, down there,  Eileen was waiting for him. 
  His pulse quickened as he passed beyond the ancient fort, over the   burial-place of the dead, and into Churchill. He met no one at the   factor's, and the door leading into Miss Brokaw's room was partly   ajar. A great fire was burning in the fireplace, and he saw Eileen   seated in the rich glow of it, smiling at him as he entered. He   closed the door, and when he turned she had risen and was holding  out  her hands to him. She had dressed for him, almost as on that  night of  the Brokaw ball. In the flashing play of the fire her  exquisite arms  and shoulders shone with dazzling beauty; her eyes  laughed at him; her  hair rippled in a golden flood. Faintly there  came to him, filling the  room slowly, tingling his nerves, the  sweet scent of heliotrope&#8212;the  perfume that had filled his  nostrils on that other night, a long time  ago, the sweet scent  that had come to him in the handkerchief dropped  on the rock, the  breath of the bit of lace that had bound Jeanne's  hair! 
  Eileen moved toward him. &quot;Philip,&quot; she said, &quot;now are you glad to   see me?&quot;
