The three long and exhaustive reports, accounting honourably for every  penny entrusted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and justifying every  payment, measure, and investment, had gone to the Congress. Nine days  later Giles brought forward nine resolutions of censure against the  Secretary of the Treasury. But by this time Congress had made up its  mind, and many of the Republicans were disgusted and humiliated. The  Federalists were triumphant, and amused themselves with Giles, drawing  him on, to confound him with ridicule and proof of the absurdity of his  charges. Madison, desperate, lost his head and the respect of many of  his colleagues, by asserting hysterically that the House was impotent to  change the truth of the accusations, and that in the tribunal of public  opinion the Secretary would be condemned. But Hamilton was triumphantly  vindicated by Congress and the Nation at large. His house was in a state  of siege for weeks from people of all parts of the country, come to  congratulate him; his desk obliterated by letters he had no time to  read. The Federals were jubilant. Their pride in Hamilton was so great  that a proclamation from above would not have disturbed their faith, and  they were merciless to the discomfited enemy. In truth, the Virginian  trio and their close adherents were mortified and confounded. In their  hearts they had not believed Hamilton guilty of dishonesty, but they had  been confident that his affairs were in chaos, that large sums must have  escaped, not conceiving that any mortal could at the same time create  gigantic schemes, and be as methodical as a department clerk in every  detail of his great office.    
Although Hamilton had commanded his brain to dwell exclusively upon the  vindication and its means, the deeps below were bitter and hot. When the  work was over, and exhausted in body and mind he went about his duties  mechanically, or attempted to find distraction in his family, he felt as  if the abundant humanity in him were curdled; and he longed for a war,  that he might go out and kill somebody. It was small compensation that  the Virginian ring were grinding their teeth, and shivering under daily  shafts of humiliation and ridicule. So terrible was the position in  which they had placed him, so immeasurably had they added to the sum of  his contempt for human kind, that individually they occupied, for a  time, but a corner of his thought.    
His only solace during this trial had been Washington; he had been too  busy and too frozen for Mrs. Croix. But that closest of his friends,  although forced by his high office to a position of stern neutrality,  did all he could in private to convince Hamilton of his unaltered  affection and regard. As soon as the vindication was complete he fell  into the habit of finishing his daily walk with an hour in Hamilton's  library. But if his visits were a pleasure to his Secretary, they were  wretchedness unleavened for two other members of the family. The  President never failed to ask for Angelica and George Washington  Lafayette; and upon their prompt but unwilling advent he would solemnly  place one on either knee, where they remained for perhaps half an hour  in awe-stricken misery. They had orders to show no distress, and they  behaved admirably; but although young Lafayette was rapidly learning  English, the fact did not lessen his fear of this enormous man, who  spoke so kindly, and looked as if he could have silenced the Terror with  the awful majesty of his presence. Angelica, being an independent little  American, was less overwhelmed, but she was often on the verge of  hysterics. It was the short session of Congress, and in March, George,  with scalding but dignified tears, accompanied his godfather to Mount  Vernon, whence he wrote Hamilton a daily letter of lament, until habit  tempered his awe; from that point he passed with Gallic bounds into an  ardent affection for the great man, who, if of an unearthly dignity, was  always kind, and, when relieved of the cares of State, uniformly genial.    
The respite in Philadelphia was brief. In April came the first news of  the beheading of the French king; and the same tardy packets brought  word that France was at war with England and Spain. Hamilton sent the  news, express haste, to Washington, and dismissed every consideration  from his brain but the terrible crisis forced upon the United States,  and the proper measures to save her from shipwreck. In the early stages  of the French Revolution he had predicted the developments with such  accuracy to Henry Walter Livingston that the new Secretary of Legation,  upon his arrival in Paris, told Gouverneur Morris--United States  minister since 1792--that to his astonishment he found nothing to  surprise him. Therefore the prophet had long been determined upon the  policy the United States should pursue when this crisis shot out of the  eastern horizon; he had now but to formulate it in such a manner that  every point could be grasped at once by the Cabinet, and acted upon.  When Washington arrived in Philadelphia and summoned his advisers,  Hamilton presented twelve questions for discussion, the most pressing of  which were: Shall a proclamation issue for the purpose of preventing  interferences of the citizens of the United States in the war between  France and Great Britain, etc.? Shall it contain a declaration of  neutrality? Shall a minister from this Republic of France be received?  Jefferson was in a far less enviable position than Hamilton. He neither  wished for war, nor dared he machinate for it; but with all his  democratic soul he loved the cause which was convulsing the world from  its ferocious centre in France. Had Jefferson come of stout yeoman  stock, like John Adams, or of a long line of patrician ancestors, like  Hamilton, and, to a lesser degree, like Washington, he might, judging  from certain of his tastes, and his love of power, have become, or been,  as aristocratic in habit and spirit as were most men of his wealth,  position, and importance in the young country. But the two extremes met  in his blood. The plebeianism of his father showed itself in the  ungainly shell, in the indifference to personal cleanliness, and in the  mongrel spirit which drove him to acts of physical cowardice for which  his apologists blush. But his mother had belonged to the aristocracy of  Virginia, and this knowledge induced a sullen resentment that he should  be so unlike her kind, so different in appearance from the courtly men  of his State. Little was wanting to accelerate his natural desire to  level his country to a plane upon which with his gifts he easily could  loom as a being of superior mould; but when a British sovereign publicly  turned his back upon him, and the English court, delighted with its cue,  treated him with an unbearable insolence, nothing more was needed to  start the torrent of his hate against all who stood for aristocracy.  Democracy rampant on all sides of him, during his sojourn in France,  found in him not only an ardent sympathizer, but a passionate advocate.  He quite overlooked the fact that he failed to persuade the country of  his enthusiasm to accord the United States fair commercial treatment: it  embodied and demonstrated his ideal of liberty, equality, fraternity,  and he was its most devoted friend, unresting until he had insinuated  his own admiration into the minds of his followers in America, and made  Jacobinism a party issue.    
To turn his back upon France, therefore, to help her neither in money  nor moral support, was a policy he had no intention to pursue, could he  avoid it; but knowing his weakness in the Cabinet, he suggested an extra  session of Congress. It would then be an easy matter to throw the  responsibility upon his followers in both Houses, while he stood to the  country as working consistently and harmoniously in his great office.    
But Hamilton, who understood him thoroughly, would listen to no  proposition which would involve weeks of delay, inflame further the  public mind, and give Jefferson an opportunity to make political  capital. Moreover, he would have no such confession of weakness go out  from the Administration. He prevailed, and in that first meeting  Jefferson was forced to consent also to the immediate issue of a  proclamation to the people. He argued with such fervour, however,  against the use of the word "neutrality," declaring that the Executive  had no constitutional authority so far to commit the people, that  Washington, to humour him, omitted the word, while declaring  authoritatively for the substance. It was also agreed that Genet, the  new Minister from France, sent by the Revolutionists to succeed M.  Ternant, should be received. The first meeting closed tranquilly, for  both Hamilton and Jefferson had tacitly admitted that it was no time for  personal recrimination.    
But the Cabinet met daily, and other subjects, notably Hamilton's  contention that their treaties made with a proper French government no  longer existed, came up for elaborate discussion; Hamilton had an  exhaustive report prepared on each of them. The two Secretaries, who  hated each other as two men hardly have hated before or since, and who  realized that they had met for their final engagement in official life,  soon dismissed any pretence at concord, and wrangled habitually--with  cutting sarcasm or crushing force on Hamilton's part, with mild but  deadly venom on Jefferson's; until he too was maddened by a jagged dart  which momentarily routed his tender regard for his person. Jefferson  wrenched one victory from the Cabinet despite Hamilton's determined  opposition: Genet's reception should be absolute. But on all other  important points the Secretary of the Treasury scored, and stone by  stone built up the great policy of neutrality which prevailed until the  year 1898; impressed into the Government the "Doctrine"--he had  formulated it in "The Federalist"--which was to immortalize the name of  a man who created nothing. Hamilton, with all the energy and obstinacy  of his nature, was resolved that the United States should not have so  much as a set-back for the sake of a country whose excesses filled him  with horror, much less run the risk of being sucked into the whirlpool  of Europe; and he watched every move Jefferson made, lest his secret  sympathies commit the country. When, after a triumphal procession  through miles of thoughtless enthusiasts, who remembered only the  services of France, forgot that their friends had been confined entirely  to the royalty and aristocracy that the mob was murdering, and were  intoxicated by the extreme democracy of the famous Secretary of State,  Genet arrived in Philadelphia, inflated and bumptious, his brain half  crazed by the nervous excitement of the past two years, and was received  with frigid politeness by Washington, Hamilton was not long discovering  that Jefferson was in secret sympathy and intercourse with this  dangerous fire-brand. The news had preceded and followed the new  minister that he had been distributing blank commissions to all who  would fit out privateers to prey upon British commerce, opening  headquarters for the enlistment of American sailors into the French  service, and constituting French consuls courts of admiralty for the  trial and condemnation of prizes brought in by French privateers.    
As soon as he arrived in Philadelphia he demanded of Hamilton the  arrears of the French debt, which the Secretary had refused to pay until  there was a stable government in France to receive it. Hamilton laughed,  locked the doors of the Treasury, and put the key in his pocket. To  Genet's excited volubility and pertinacity he paid as little attention  as to Jefferson's arguments. Moreover, he reversed all Citizen Genet's  performances in the South; and in course of time, even the captured  British ships, to the wrath and disgust of Jefferson, were returned to  their owners.    
Freneau's <i>Gazette</i> supported the Secretary of State with the  desperation of an expiring cause; in this great final battle, were  Jefferson driven from the Cabinet, his faithful organ must scurry to the  limbo of its kind. It assailed the Administration for ingratitude and  meanness, then turned its attention almost exclusively to the Secretary  of the Treasury. It accused him of abstracting the moneys due to France,  of plundering the industrious farmer with the Excise Law, destroying the  morals of the people by Custom House duties; resurrected the old  discrimination cry and asserted vehemently that he, and he alone, had  robbed the poor soldiers. It raked every accusation, past and present,  from its pigeon holes. Jefferson, on the other hand, was held up as a  model of the disinterested statesman, combining virtues before which  those falsely attributed to Washington paled and expired; and as the  only man fit to fill the Executive Chair. Genet accepted all this as  gospel, fortunately, perhaps, for the country; for his own excesses and  impudence, his final threat to appeal from the President to the people,  ruined him with the cooling heads of the Republican party, and finally  lost him even the support of Jefferson.    
Meanwhile, after stormy meetings of the Cabinet, Hamilton, in the peace  of his library, with Angelica sorting his pages,--until she went to the  North,--had written a series of papers defending the proclamation. They  were so able and convincing, so demonstrable of the treasonable efforts  of the enemy to undermine the influence of the Administration, so cool  and so brilliant an exposition of the rights and powers of the  Executive, that on July 7th Jefferson wrote to Madison: "For God's sake,  my dear sir, take up your pen. Select the most striking heresies, and  cut him to pieces in the face of the public."    
Madison hastened to obey his chief in a series of papers which tickled  the literary nerve, but failed to convince. That the laurels were to  Hamilton was another bitter pill which Jefferson was forced to swallow.  Nevertheless, Hamilton, despite his victories, felt anything but  amiable. He was so exhausted that he was on the verge of a collapse, and  triumphs were drab under the daily harassment of Jefferson, Genet, and  Freneau. Matters came to a climax one day in August, shortly before the  outbreak of yellow fever.
