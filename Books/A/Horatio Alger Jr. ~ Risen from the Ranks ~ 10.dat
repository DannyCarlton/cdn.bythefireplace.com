  On Thursday evening the main school of the Academy building was  lighted up, and groups of boys, varying in age from thirteen to  nineteen, were standing in different parts of the room. These were  members of the Clionian Society, whose weekly meeting was about to take  place.
  At eight o'clock precisely the President took his place at the  teacher's desk, with the Secretary at his side, and rapped for order.  The presiding officer was Alfred DeWitt, a member of the Senior Class,  and now nearly ready for college. The Secretary was a member of the  same class, by name George Sanborn.
  &#8220;The Secretary will read the minutes of the last meeting,&#8221; said the  President, when order had been obtained.
  George Sanborn rose and read his report, which was accepted.
  &#8220;Are any committees prepared to report?&#8221; asked the President.
  The Finance Committee reported through its chairman, recommending  that the fee for admission be established at one dollar, and that each  member be assessed twenty-five cents monthly.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Fitzgerald Fletcher, rising to his feet, &#8220;I  would like to say a word in reference to this report.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Fletcher has the floor.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Mr. President, I wish to say that I disagree with the Report  of the Committee. I think a dollar is altogether too small. It ought to  be at least three dollars, and I myself should prefer five dollars.  Again, sir, the Committee has recommended for the monthly assessment  the ridiculously small sum of twenty-five cents. I think it ought to be  a dollar.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President, I should like to ask the gentleman his reason,&#8221; said  Henry Fairbanks, Chairman of the Finance Committee. &#8220;Why should we tax  the members to such an extent, when the sums reported are sufficient to  defray the ordinary expenses of the Society, and to leave a small  surplus besides?&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; returned Fletcher, &#8220;I will answer the gentleman. We  don't want to throw open the Society to every one that can raise a  dollar. We want to have an exclusive society.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Oscar Vincent, rising, &#8220;I should like to ask  the gentleman for how many he is speaking. He certainly is not speaking  for me. I don't want the Society to be exclusive. There are not many  who can afford to pay the exorbitant sums which he desires fixed for  admission fee and for monthly assessments, and I for one am not willing  to exclude any good fellow who desires to become one of us, but does  not boast as heavy a purse as the gentleman who has just spoken.&#8221;
  These remarks of Oscar were greeted with applause, general enough to  show that the opinions of nearly all were with him.
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Henry Fairbanks, &#8220;though I am opposed to the  gentleman's suggestion, (does he offer it as an amendment?) I have no  possible objection to his individually paying the increased rates which  he recommends, and I am sure the Treasurer will gladly receive them.&#8221;
  Laughter and applause greeted this hit, and Fletcher once more  arose, somewhat vexed at the reception of his suggestion.
  &#8220;I don't choose&#8212;&#8221; he commenced.
  &#8220;The gentleman will address the chair,&#8221; interrupted the President.
  &#8220;Mr. President, I don't choose to pay more than the other members,  though I can do it without inconvenience. But, as I said, I don't  believe in being too democratic. I am not in favor of admitting anybody  and everybody into the Society.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said James Hooper, &#8220;I congratulate the gentleman on  the flourishing state of his finances. For my own part, I am not  ashamed to say that I cannot afford to pay a dollar a month assessment,  and, were it required, I should be obliged to offer my resignation.&#8221;
  &#8220;So much the better,&#8221; thought Fitzgerald, for, as Hooper was poor,  and went coarsely clothed, he looked down upon him. Fortunately for  himself he did not give utterance to his thought.
  &#8220;Does Mr. Fletcher put his recommendation into the form of an  amendment?&#8221; asked, the President.
  &#8220;I do.&#8221;
  &#8220;Be kind enough to state it, then.&#8221;
  Fletcher did so, but as no one seconded it, no action was of course  taken.
  &#8220;Nominations for membership are now in order,&#8221; said the President.
  &#8220;I should like to propose my friend Henry Walton.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is Henry Walton?&#8221; asked a member.
  &#8220;Mr. President, may I answer the gentleman?&#8221; asked Fitzgerald  Fletcher, rising to his feet.
  &#8220;As the nominee is not to be voted upon this evening, it is not in  order.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;I should be glad to have the gentleman  report his information.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Fletcher may speak if he desires it, but as the name will be  referred to the Committee on Nominations, it is hardly necessary.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. President, I merely wish to inform the Society, that Mr. Walton  occupies the dignified position of printer's devil in the office of the  'Centreville Gazette.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Mr. President,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;may I ask the indulgence of the  Society long enough to say that I am quite aware of the fact. I will  add that Mr. Walton is a young man of excellent abilities, and I am  confident will prove an accession to the Society.&#8221;
  &#8220;I cannot permit further remarks on a matter which will come in due  course before the Committee on Nominations,&#8221; said the President.
  &#8220;The next business in order is the debate.&#8221;
  Of the debate, and the further proceedings, I shall not speak, as  they are of no special interest. But after the meeting was over, groups  of members discussed matters which had come up during the evening.  Fletcher approached Oscar Vincent, and said, &#8220;I can't see, Oscar, why  you are trying to get that printer's devil into our Society.&#8221;
  &#8220;Because he's a good fellow, and smart enough to do us credit.&#8221;
  &#8220;If there were any bootblacks in Centreville I suppose you'd be  proposing them?&#8221; said Fletcher with a sneer.
  &#8220;I might, if they were as smart as my friend Walton.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are not very particular about your friends,&#8221; said Fletcher in  the same tone.
  &#8220;I don't ask them to open their pocket-books, and show me how much  money they have.&#8221;
  &#8220;I prefer to associate with gentlemen.&#8221;
  &#8220;So do I.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yet you associate with that printer's devil.&#8221;
  &#8220;I consider him a gentleman.&#8221;
  Fletcher laughed scornfully.
  &#8220;You have strange ideas of a gentleman,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I hold the same,&#8221; said James Hooper, who had come up in time to  hear the last portion of the conversation. &#8220;I don't think a full purse  is the only or the chief qualification of a gentleman. If labor is to  be a disqualification, then I must resign all claims to be considered a  gentleman, as I worked on a farm for two years before coming to school,  and in that way earned the money to pay my expenses here.&#8221;
  Fletcher turned up his nose, but did not reply.
  Hooper was a good scholar and influential in the Society, but in  Fletcher's eyes he was unworthy of consideration.
  &#8220;Look here, Fletcher,&#8212;what makes you so confoundedly exclusive is  your ideas?&#8221; asked Henry Fairbanks.
  &#8220;Because I respect myself,&#8221; said Fletcher in rather a surly tone.
  &#8220;Then you have one admirer,&#8221; said Fairbanks.
  &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; asked Fletcher, suspiciously.
  &#8220;Nothing out of the way. I believe in self-respect, but I don't see  how it is going to be endangered by the admission of Oscar's friend to  the Society.&#8221;
  &#8220;Am I expected to associate on equal terms with a printer's devil?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't answer for you. As for me, if he is a good fellow, I shall  welcome him to our ranks. Some of our most eminent men have been  apprenticed to the trade of printer. I believe, after all, it is the  name that has prejudiced you.&#8221;
  &#8220;No it isn't. I have seen him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Henry Walton?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where?&#8221;
  &#8220;In Oscar's room.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't like his appearance.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's the matter with his appearance?&#8221; asked Oscar.
  &#8220;He looks low.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's where I must decidedly contradict you, Fitz, and I shall  appeal confidently to the members of the Society when they come to know  him, as they soon will, for I am sure no one else shares your  ridiculous prejudices. Harry Walton, in my opinion, is a true  gentleman, without reference to his purse, and he is bound to rise  hereafter, take my word for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;There's plenty of room for him to rise,&#8221; said Fletcher with a  sneer.
  &#8220;That is true not only of him, but of all of us, I take it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you refer to me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh no,&#8221; said Oscar with sarcasm. &#8220;I am quite aware that you are at  the pinnacle of eminence, even if you do flunk in Greek occasionally.&#8221;
  Fitzgerald had failed in the Greek recitation during the day, and  that in school parlance is sometimes termed a &#8220;flunk.&#8221; He bit his lip  in mortification at this reference, and walked away, leaving Oscar  master of the situation.
  &#8220;You had the best of him there, Vincent,&#8221; said George Sanborn. &#8220;He  has gone off in disgust.&#8221;
  &#8220;I like to see Fletcher taken down,&#8221; said Henry Fairbanks. &#8220;I never  saw a fellow put on so many airs. He is altogether too aristocratic to  associate with ordinary people.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;he has a foolish pride, which I hope he will  some time get rid of.&#8221;
  &#8220;He ought to have been born in England, and not in a republic.&#8221;
  &#8220;If he had been born in England, he would have been unhappy unless  he had belonged to the nobility,&#8221; said Alfred DeWitt.
  &#8220;Look here, boys,&#8221; said Tom Carver, &#8220;what do you say to mortifying  Fitz's pride?&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you got a plan in view, Tom? If so, out with it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes: you know the pedler that comes into town about once a month to  buy up rags, and sell his tinwares.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have seen him. Well, what of him?&#8221;
  &#8220;He is coming early next week. Some of us will see him privately,  and post him up as to Fitz's relations and position, and hire him to  come up to school, and inquire for Fitz, representing himself as his  cousin. Of course Fitz will deny it indignantly, but he will persist  and show that he knows all about the family.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good! Splendid!&#8221; exclaimed the boys laughing. &#8220;Won't Fitz be  raving?&#8221;
  &#8220;There's no doubt about that. Well, boys, I'll arrange it all, if  you'll authorize me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Go ahead, Tom. You can draw upon us for the necessary funds.&#8221;
  Fletcher had retired to his room, angry at the opposition his  proposal had received, and without any warning of the humiliation which  awaited him.
