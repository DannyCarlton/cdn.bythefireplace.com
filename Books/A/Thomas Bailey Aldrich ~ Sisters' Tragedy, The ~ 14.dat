The folk who lived in Shakespeare's day<br> And saw that gentle figure pass<br> By London Bridge, his frequent way--<br> They little knew what man he was. 
The pointed beard, the courteous mien,<br> The equal port to high and low,<br> All this they saw or might have seen--<br> But not the light behind the brow! 
The doublet's modest gray or brown,<br> The slender sword-hilt's plain device,<br> What sign had these for prince or clown?<br> Few turned, or none, to scan him twice. 
Yet 'twas the king of England's kings!<br> The rest with all their pomps and trains<br> Are mouldered, half-remembered things--<br> 'Tis he alone that lives and reigns!
