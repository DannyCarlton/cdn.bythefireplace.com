  At the desk in Alan's living-room sat Rossland, when the door opened  behind him and the master of the range came in. He was not disturbed  when he saw who it was, and rose to meet him. His coat was off, his  sleeves rolled up, and it was evident he was making no effort to  conceal his freedom with Alan's books and papers.
  He advanced, holding out a hand. This was not the same Rossland who  had told Alan to attend to his own business on board the<I> Nome</I>.  His attitude was that of one greeting a friend, smiling and affable  even before he spoke. Something inspired Alan to return the smile.  Behind that smile he was admiring the man's nerve. His hand met  Rossland's casually, but there was no uncertainty in the warmth of the  other's grip.
  &#8220;How d' do, Paris, old boy?&#8221; he greeted good-humoredly. &#8220;Saw you  going in to Helen a few minutes ago, so I've been waiting for you.  She's a little frightened. And we can't blame her. Menelaus is mightily  upset. But mind me, Holt, I'm not blaming you. I'm too good a sport.  Clever, I call it&#8212;damned clever. She's enough to turn any man's head.  I only wish I were in your boots right now. I'd have turned traitor  myself aboard the<I> Nome</I> if she had shown an inclination.&#8221;
  He proffered a cigar, a big, fat cigar with a gold band. It was  inspiration again that made Alan accept it and light it. His blood was  racing. But Rossland saw nothing of that. He observed only the nod, the  cool smile on Alan's lips, the apparent nonchalance with which he was  meeting the situation. It pleased Graham's agent. He reseated himself  in the desk-chair and motioned Alan to another chair near him.
  &#8220;I thought you were badly hurt,&#8221; said Alan. &#8220;Nasty knife wound you  got.&#8221;
  Rossland shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;There you have it again, Holt&#8212;the  hell of letting a pretty face run away with you. One of the Thlinkit  girls down in the steerage, you know. Lovely little thing, wasn't she?  Tricked her into my cabin all right, but she wasn't like some other  Indian girls I've known. The next night a brother, or sweetheart, or  whoever it was got me through the open port. It wasn't bad. I was out  of the hospital within a week. Lucky I was put there, too. Otherwise I  wouldn't have seen Mrs. Graham one morning&#8212;through the window. What a  little our fortunes hang to at times, eh? If it hadn't been for the  girl and the knife and the hospital, I wouldn't be here now, and Graham  wouldn't be bleeding his heart out with impatience&#8212;and you, Holt,  wouldn't be facing the biggest opportunity that will ever come into  your life.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm afraid I don't understand,&#8221; said Alan, hiding his face in the  smoke of his cigar and speaking with an apparent indifference which had  its effect upon Rossland. &#8220;Your presence inclines me to believe that  luck has rather turned against me. Where can my advantage be?&#8221;
  A grim seriousness settled in Rossland's eyes, and his voice became  cool and hard. &#8220;Holt, as two men who are not afraid to meet unusual  situations, we may as well call a spade a spade in this matter, don't  you think so?&#8221;
  &#8220;Decidedly,&#8221; said Alan.
  &#8220;You know that Mary Standish is really Mary Standish Graham, John  Graham's wife?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you probably know&#8212;now&#8212;why she jumped into the sea, and why  she ran away from Graham.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do.&#8221;
  &#8220;That saves a lot of talk. But there is another side to the story  which you probably don't know, and I am here to tell it to you. John  Graham doesn't care for a dollar of the Standish fortune. It's the girl  he wants, and has always wanted. She has grown up under his eyes. From  the day she was fourteen years old he has lived and planned with the  thought of possessing her. You know how he got her to marry him, and  you know what happened afterward. But it makes no difference to him  whether she hates him or not. He<I> wants</I> her. And this&#8221;&#8212;he swept  his arms out, &#8220;is the most beautiful place in the world in which to  have her returned to him. I've been figuring from your books. Your  property isn't worth over a hundred thousand dollars as it stands on  hoof today. I'm here to offer you five times that for it. In other  words, Graham is willing to forfeit all action he might have personally  against you for stealing his wife, and in place of that will pay you  five hundred thousand dollars for the privilege of having his honeymoon  here, and making of this place a country estate where his wife may  reside indefinitely, subject to her husband's visits when he is so  inclined. There will be a stipulation, of course, requiring that the  personal details of the deal be kept strictly confidential, and that  you leave the country. Do I make myself clear?&#8221;
  Alan rose to his feet and paced thoughtfully across the room. At  least, Rossland measured his action as one of sudden, intensive  reflection as he watched him, smiling complacently at the effect of his  knock-out proposition upon the other. He had not minced matters. He had  come to the point without an effort at bargaining, and he possessed  sufficient dramatic sense to appreciate what the offer of half a  million dollars meant to an individual who was struggling for existence  at the edge of a raw frontier. Alan stood with his back toward him,  facing a window. His voice was oddly strained when he answered. But  that was quite natural, too, Rossland thought.
  &#8220;I am wondering if I understand you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you mean that if  I sell Graham the range, leave it bag and baggage, and agree to keep my  mouth shut thereafter, he will give me half a million dollars?&#8221;
  &#8220;That is the price. You are to take your people with you. Graham has  his own.&#8221;
  Alan tried to laugh. &#8220;I think I see the point&#8212;now. He isn't paying  five hundred thousand for Miss Standish&#8212;I mean Mrs. Graham. He's  paying it for the<I> isolation</I>.&#8221;
  &#8220;Exactly. It was a last-minute hunch with him&#8212;to settle the matter  peaceably. We started up here to get his wife. You understand, to<I>  get</I> her, and settle the matter with you in a different way from the  one we're using now. You hit the word when you said 'isolation.' What a  damn fool a man can make of himself over a pretty face! Think of  it&#8212;half a million dollars!&#8221;
  &#8220;It sounds unreal,&#8221; mused Alan, keeping his face to the window. &#8220;Why  should he offer so much?&#8221;
  &#8220;You must keep the stipulation in mind, Holt. That is an important  part of the deal. You are to keep your mouth shut. Buying the range at  a normal price wouldn't guarantee it. But when you accept a sum like  that, you're a partner in the other end of the transaction, and your  health depends upon keeping the matter quiet. Simple enough, isn't it?&#8221;
  Alan turned back to the table. His face was pale. He tried to keep  smoke in front of his eyes. &#8220;Of course, I don't suppose he'd allow Mrs.  Graham to escape back to the States&#8212;where she might do a little  upsetting on her own account?&#8221;
  &#8220;He isn't throwing the money away,&#8221; replied Rossland significantly.
  &#8220;She would remain here indefinitely?&#8221;
  &#8220;Indefinitely.&#8221;
  &#8220;Probably never would return.&#8221;
  &#8220;Strange how squarely you hit the nail on the head! Why should she  return? The world believes she is dead. Papers were full of it. The  little secret of her being alive is all our own. And this will be a  beautiful summering place for Graham. Magnificent climate. Lovely  flowers. Birds. And the girl he has watched grow up, and wanted, since  she was fourteen.&#8221;
  &#8220;And who hates him.&#8221;
  &#8220;True.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who was tricked into marrying him, and who would rather die than  live with him as his wife.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it's up to Graham to keep her alive, Holt. That's not our  business. If she dies, I imagine you will have an opportunity to get  your range back pretty cheap.&#8221;
  Rossland held a paper out to Alan.
  &#8220;Here's partial payment&#8212;two hundred and fifty thousand. I have the  papers here, on the desk, ready to sign. As soon as you give  possession, I'll return to Tanana with you and make the remaining  payment.&#8221;
  Alan took the check. &#8220;I guess only a fool would refuse an offer like  this, Rossland.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, only a fool.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>And I am that fool</I>.&#8221;
  So quietly did Alan speak that for an instant the significance of  his words did not fall with full force upon Rossland. The smoke cleared  away from before Alan's face. His cigar dropped to the floor, and he  stepped on it with his foot. The check followed it in torn scraps. The  fury he had held back with almost superhuman effort blazed in his eyes.
  &#8220;If I could have Graham where you are now&#8212;<I>in that chair</I>&#8212;I'd  give ten years of my life, Rossland. I would kill him. And you&#8212;<I>you</I> &#8212;&#8221;
  He stepped back a pace, as if to put himself out of striking  distance of the beast who was staring at him in amazement.
  &#8220;What you have said about her should condemn you to death. And I  would kill you here, in this room, if it wasn't necessary for you to  take my message back to Graham. Tell him that Mary Standish&#8212;<I>not</I>  Mary Graham&#8212;is as pure and clean and as sweet as the day she was born.  Tell him that she belongs to<I> me</I>. I love her. She is mine&#8212;do you  understand? And all the money in the world couldn't buy one hair from  her head. I'm going to take her back to the States. She is going to get  a square deal, and the world is going to know her story. She has  nothing to conceal. Absolutely nothing. Tell that to John Graham for  me.&#8221;
  He advanced upon Rossland, who had risen from his chair; his hands  were clenched, his face a mask of iron.
  &#8220;Get out! Go before I flay you within an inch of your rotten life!&#8221;
  The energy which every fiber in him yearned to expend upon Rossland  sent the table crashing back in an overturned wreck against the wall.
  &#8220;Go&#8212;before I kill you!&#8221;
  He was advancing, even as the words of warning came from his lips,  and the man before him, an awe-stricken mass of flesh that had  forgotten power and courage in the face of a deadly and unexpected  menace, backed quickly to the door and escaped. He made for the  corrals, and Alan watched from his door until he saw him departing  southward, accompanied by two men who bore packs on their shoulders.  Not until then did Rossland gather his nerve sufficiently to stop and  look back. His breathless voice carried something unintelligible to  Alan. But he did not return for his coat and hat.
  The reaction came to Alan when he saw the wreck he had made of the  table. Another moment or two and the devil in him would have been at  work. He hated Rossland. He hated him now only a little less than he  hated John Graham, and that he had let him go seemed a miracle to him.  He felt the strain he had been under. But he was glad. Some little god  of common sense had overruled his passion, and he had acted wisely.  Graham would now get his message, and there could be no  misunderstanding of purpose between them.
  He was staring at the disordered papers on his desk when a movement  at the door turned him about. Mary Standish stood before him.
  &#8220;You sent him away,&#8221; she cried softly.
  Her eyes were shining, her lips parted, her face lit up with a  beautiful glow. She saw the overturned table, Rossland's hat and coat  on a chair, the evidence of what had happened and the quickness of his  flight; and then she turned her face to Alan again, and what he saw  broke down the last of that grim resolution which he had measured for  himself, so that in a moment he was at her side, and had her in his  arms. She made no effort to free herself as she had done in the  cottonwoods, but turned her mouth up for him to kiss, and then hid her  face against his shoulder&#8212;while he, fighting vainly to find utterance  for the thousand words in his throat, stood stroking her hair, and then  buried his face in it, crying out at last in the warm sweetness of it  that he loved her, and was going to fight for her, and that no power on  earth could take her away from him now. And these things he repeated  until she raised her flushed face from his breast, and let him kiss her  lips once more, and then freed herself gently from his arms.
