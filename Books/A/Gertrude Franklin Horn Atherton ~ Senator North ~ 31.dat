Senator North started for Washington that afternoon. Betty did not see  him again. He did not write, but she hardly expected that he would. He  had remarked once that two-thirds of all the trouble in the world came  out of letters, and Betty, with Miss Trumbull in mind, was inclined to  agree with him. He would not return for a fortnight.    
On Friday, very late, Senator Burleigh arrived. He was on the Finance  Committee, but had written that he should break his chains for this  brief holiday if he never had another. He had sent her two boxes of  flowers since her return, and had written her a large number of brief,  emphatic, but impersonal letters during her sojourn in California.    
He looked big and breezy and triumphant as he entered the living-room,  and he sprinkled magnetism like a huge watering-pot. Betty knew by  this time that all men successful in American politics had this  qualification, and had come in contact with it so often since her  introduction to the Senate that it had ceased to have any effect on  her except when emanating from one man.    
"Are you not frightfully tired?" she asked. "What a journey!"    
"Anything, even a fourteen hours' train journey, is heaven after  Washington in hot weather. The asphalt pavements are reeking, and your  heels go in when you forget to walk on your toes--and stick. But it is  enchanting up here."    
His eyes dwelt with frank delight on her fresh blue organdie. "Oh,  Washington does not exist," he exclaimed. "I thought constantly of you  when we were struggling over that Tariff Bill in Committee, and I  wanted to put all the fabrics you like on the free list, as a special  compliment to you."    
"The unwritten history of a Committee Room! Law does not seem like law  at all when one knows the makers of it. But you must be starved. If  you will follow me blindly down the hall, I promise that you will  really be glad you came."    
Miss Trumbull had attended personally to the supper, and he did it  justice, although he continued to talk to Betty and to let his eyes  express a more fervent admiration than had been their previous habit.    
"There's no hope for me," thought Betty, when Emory had taken him to  his room. "He has made up his mind to propose during this visit. If I  can only stave it off till the last minute!"    
As she went up the stair, she met Miss Trumbull, who was coming down.    
"Your supper was very good," she said kindly. "Thank you for sitting  up."    
That was enough for the housekeeper, who appeared to have conceived a  worship of the hand that had smitten her. It had seemed to Betty in  the last few days that she met her admiring eyes whichever way she  turned. Miss Trumbull put out her hand and fumbled at the lace on Miss  Madison's gown.    
"Tell me," she drawled wheedlingly, "that's your beau, ain't it? I  guessed he was when those flowers come, and the minute I set eyes on  him, I said to myself, 'That's the gentleman for Miss Madison. My! but  you'll make a handsome couple."    
"Oh!" exclaimed Betty. "Oh!" Then she laughed. The woman was too  ridiculous for further anger. "Good-night," she said, and went on to  her room.
