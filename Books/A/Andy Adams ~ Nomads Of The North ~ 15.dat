  In a twist of Three Jackpine River, buried in the deep of the   forest between the Shamattawa country and Hudson Bay, was the  cabin  in which lived Jacques Le Beau, the trapper. There was not  another man  in all that wilderness who was the equal of Le Beau in   wickedness&#8212;unless it was Durant, who hunted foxes a hundred miles   north, and who was Jacques's rival in several things. A giant in   size, with a heavy, sullen face and eyes which seemed but half-   hidden greenish loopholes for the pitiless soul within him&#8212;if he  had  a soul at all&#8212;Le Beau was a &quot;throw-back&quot; of the worst sort.  In their  shacks and teepees the Indians whispered softly that all  the devils of  his forebears had gathered in him. 
  It was a grim kind of fate that had given to Le Beau a wife. Had   she been a witch, an evil-doer and an evil-thinker like himself,  the  thing would not have been such an abortion of what should have  been.  But she was not that. Sweet-faced, with something of unusual  beauty  still in her pale cheeks and starving eyes&#8212;trembling at  his approach  and a slave in his presence&#8212;she was, like his dogs,  the PROPERTY of  The Brute. And the woman had a baby. One had  already died; and it was  the thought that this one might die, as  the other had died, that  brought at times the new flash of fire  into her dark eyes. 
  &quot;Le bon Dieu&#8212;I pray to the Blessed Angels&#8212;I swear you SHALL   live!&quot; she would cry to it at times, hugging it close to her  breast.  And it was at these times that the fire came into her  eyes, and her  pale cheeks flushed with a smouldering bit of the  flame that had once  been her beauty. &quot;Some day&#8212;SOME DAY&#8212;&quot; 
  But she never finished, even to the child, what was in her mind.   Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions. The world was still   young, and SHE was not old. She was thinking of that as she stood   before the cracked bit of mirror in the cabin, brushing out her  hair,  that was black and shining and so long that it fell to her  hips. Of  her beauty her hair had remained. It was defiant of The  Brute. And  deep back in her eyes, and in her face, there were  still the living,  hidden traces of her girlhood heritage ready to  bloom again if Fate,  mending its error at last, would only take  away forever the crushing  presence of the Master. She stood a  little longer before the bit of  glass when she heard the crunching  of footsteps in the snow outside. 
  Swiftly what had been in her face was gone. Le Beau had been away   on his trapline since yesterday, and his return filled her with  the  old dread. Twice he had caught her before the mirror and had  called  her vile names for wasting her time in admiring herself  when she might  have been scraping the fat from his pelts. The  second time he had sent  her reeling back against the wall, and had  broken the mirror until the  bit she treasured now was not much  larger than her two slim hands. She  would not be caught again. She  ran with the glass to the place where  she kept it in hiding, and  then quickly she wove the heavy strands of  her hair into a braid.  The strange, dead look of fear and foreboding  closed like a veil  over the secrets her eyes had disclosed to herself.  She turned, as  she always turned in her woman's hope and yearning, to  greet him  when he entered. 
  The Brute entered, a dark and surly monster. He was in a wicked   humour. His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor. He pointed  to  them, and his eyes were narrowed to menacing slits as they fell  upon  her. 
  &quot;He was there again&#8212;that devil!&quot; he growled. &quot;See, he has spoiled   the fisher, and he has cleaned out my baits and knocked down the   trap-houses. Par les mille cornes du diable, but I will kill him!  I  have sworn to cut him into bits with a knife when I catch him&#8212;  and  catch him I will, to-morrow. See to it there&#8212;the skins&#8212;when  you have  got me something to eat. Mend the fisher where he is torn  in two, and  cover the seam well with fat so that the agent over at  the post will  not discover it is bad. Tonnerre de Dieu!&#8212;that  brat! Why do you  always keep his squalling until I come in? Answer  me, Bete!&quot; 
  Such was his greeting. He flung his snowshoes into a corner,   stamped the snow off his feet, and got himself a fresh plug of  black  tobacco from a shelf over the stove. Then he went out again,  leaving  the woman with a cold tremble in her heart and the wan  desolation of  hopelessness in her face as she set about getting  him food. 
  From the cabin Le Beau went to his dog-pit, a corral of saplings   with a shelter-shack in the centre of it. It was The Brute's boast   that he had the fiercest pack of sledge-dogs between Hudson Bay  and  the Athabasca. It was his chief quarrel with Durant, his rival  farther  north; and his ambition was to breed a pup that would kill  the  fighting husky which Durant brought down to the Post with him  each  winter at New Year. This season he had chosen Netah (&quot;The  Killer&quot;) for  the big fight at God's Lake. On the day he would  gamble his money and  his reputation against Durant's, his dog  would be just one month under  two years of age. It was Netah he  called from out of the pack now. 
  The dog slunk to him with a low growl in his throat, and for the   first time something like joy shone in Le Beau's face. He loved to   hear that growl. He loved to see the red and treacherous glow in   Netah's eyes, and hear the menacing click of his jaws. Whatever of   nobility might have been in Netah's blood had been clubbed out by  the  man. They were alike, in that their souls were dead. And  Netah, for a  dog, was a devil. For that reason Le Beau had chosen  him to fight the  big fight. 
  Le Beau looked down at him, and drew a deep breath of   satisfaction. 
  &quot;OW! but you are looking fine, Netah,&quot; he exulted. &quot;I can almost   see running blood in those devil-eyes of yours; OUI&#8212;red blood  that  smells and runs, as the blood of Durant's POOS shall run when  you sink  those teeth in its jugular. And to-morrow we are going to  give you the  test&#8212;such a beautiful test!&#8212;with the wild dog that  is robbing my  traps and tearing my fishers into bits. For I will  catch him, and you  shall fight him until he is almost dead; and  then I shall cut his  heart out alive, as I have promised, and you  will eat it while it is  still beating, so that there will be no  excuse for your losing to that  POOS which M'sieu Durant will bring  down. COMPRENEZ? It will be a  beautiful test&#8212;to-morrow. And if  you fail I will kill you. OUI; if  you so much as let a whimper out  of you, I will kill you&#8212;dead.&quot;
