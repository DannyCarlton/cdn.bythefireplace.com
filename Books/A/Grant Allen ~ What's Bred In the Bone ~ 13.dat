The manager at Messrs. Drummond, Coutts and Barclay's, Limited,  received Colonel Kelmscott with distinguished consideration.  A courteous, conciliatory sort of man, that manager, with his  close-shaven face and his spotless shirt-front.    
"Five minutes, my dear sir?" he exclaimed, with warmth, motioning  his visitor blandly into the leather-covered chair. "Half an hour,  if you wish it. We always have leisure to receive our clients. Any  service we can render them, we're only too happy."    
"But this is a very peculiar bit of business," Colonel Kelmscott  answered, humming and hawing with obvious hesitation. "It isn't  quite in the regular way of banking, I believe. Perhaps, indeed,  I ought rather to have put it into the hands of my solicitor. But,  even if you can't manage the thing yourself, you may be able to put  me in the way of finding out how best I can get it managed elsewhere."    
The manager bowed. His smile was a smile of genuine satisfaction.  Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate was in a most gracious humour.  The manager, with deference, held himself wholly at his client's  disposition.    
So the Colonel proceeded to unfold his business. There were two  young men, now knocking about town, of the names of Guy and Cyril  Waring--the one a journalist, the other a painter--and they had rooms  in Staple Inn, Holborn, which would doubtless form a sufficient clue  by which to identify them. Colonel Kelmscott desired unobtrusively  to know where these young men banked--if indeed they were in a position  to keep an account; and when that was found out, he wished Messrs.  Drummond, Coutts and Barclay, Limited, to place a sum of money  at their bankers to their credit, without mentioning the name of  the person so placing it, as well as to transmit to them a sealed  envelope, containing instructions as to the use to be made of the  money in question.    
The manager nodded a cautious acquiescence. To place the money to  the credit of the two young men, indeed, would be quite in their  way. But to send the sealed envelope, without being aware of its  contents, or the nature of the business on which it was despatched,  would be much less regular. Perhaps the Colonel might find some other  means of managing without their aid that portion of the business  arrangement.    
The Colonel, for his part, fell in readily enough with this modest  point of view. It amply sufficed for him if the money were paid  to the young men's credit, and a receipt, forwarded to him in due  course, under cover of a number, to the care of the bankers.    
"Very well," the manager answered, rubbing his hands contentedly.  "Our confidential clerk will settle all that for you. A most sagacious  person, our confidential clerk. No eyes, no ears, no tongue for  anything but our clients' interests."    
The Colonel smiled, and sat a little longer, giving further details  as the precise amount he wished sent, and the particular way he  wished to send it--the whole sum to be, in fact, twelve thousand  pounds, amount of the purchase money of the Dowlands farms, whereof  only six thousand had as yet been paid down; and that six thousand  he wished to place forthwith to the credit of Cyril Waring, the  painter. The remaining six thousand, to be settled, as agreed,  in five weeks' time, he would then make over under the self-same  conditions to the other brother, Guy Waring, the journalist. It  had gone a trifle too cheap, that land at Dowlands, the Colonel  opined; but still, in days like these he was very glad, indeed, to  find a purchaser for the place at anything like its value.    
"I think a Miss Ewes was the fortunate bidder, wasn't she?" the  manager asked, just to make a certain decent show of interest in  his client's estate.    
"Yes, Miss Elma Ewes of Kenilworth," the Colonel answered, letting  loose for a moment his tongue, that unruly member. "She's the  composer, you know--writes songs and dances; remotely connected with  Reginald Clifford, the man who was Governor of some West Indian  Dutch-oven--St. Kitts, I think, or Antigua--he lives down our way,  and he's a neighbour of mine at Tilgate. Or rather she's connected  with Mrs. Clifford, the Governor's wife, who was one of the younger  branch, a Miss Ewes of Worthing, daughter of the Ewes who was Dean  of Dorchester. Elma's been a family name for years with all the  lot of Eweses, good, bad, or indifferent. Came down to them, don't  you know, from that Roumanian ancestress."    
"Indeed," the manager answered, now beginning to be really  interested--for the Cliffords were clients too, and it behoves  a banker to know everything about everybody's business. "So Mrs.  Clifford had an ancestress who was a Roumanian, had she? Well,  I've noticed at times her complexion looked very southern and  gipsy-like--distinctly un-English."    
"Oh, they call it Roumanian," Colonel Kelmscott went on in a  confidential tone, roping his white moustache, and growing more  and more conversational; "they call it Roumanian, because it sounds  more respectable; but I believe, if you go right down to the very  bottom of the thing, it was much more like some kind of Oriental  gipsy. Sir Michael Ewes, the founder of the house, in George the  Second's time, was ambassador for awhile at Constantinople. He  began life, indeed, I believe, as a Turkey merchant. Well, at Pera  one day, so the story goes--you'll find it all in Horace Walpole's  diary--he picked up with this dark-skinned gipsy-woman, who was a  wonderful creature in her way, a sort of mesmeric sorceress, who  belonged to some tribe of far eastern serpent charmers. It seems  that women of this particular tribe were regularly trained by the  men to be capering priestesses--or fortune-tellers, if you like--who  performed some extraordinary sacred antics of a mystical kind,  much after the fashion of the howling dervishes. However that may  be, Sir Michael, at any rate, pacing the streets of Pera, saw the  woman that she was passing fair, and fell in love with her outright  at some dervish entertainment. But being a very well-behaved old  man, combining a liking for Orientals with a British taste for the  highest respectability, he had the girl baptized and made into a  proper Christian first; and then he married her off-hand and brought  her home with him as my Lady Ewes to England. She was presented at  Court, to George the Second; and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu stood  her sponsor on the occasion."    
"But how did it all turn out?" the manager asked, with an air of  intelligent historical interest.    
"Turn out? Well, it turned out in a thumping big family of thirteen  children," the Colonel answered; "most of whom, happily for the  father, died young, But the five who survived, and who married at  last into very good connections, all had one peculiarity, which  they transmitted to all their female descendants. Very odd these  hereditary traits, to be sure. Very singular! Very singular!"    
"Ah, to be sure," the manager answered, turning over a pile of  letters. "And what was the hereditary trait handed down, as you  say, in the family of the Roumanian lady?"    
"Why, in the first place," the Colonel continued, leaning back in  his chair, and making himself perfectly comfortable, "all the girls  of the Ewes connection, to the third and fourth generation, have  olive-brown complexions, creamy and soft, but clear as crystal.  Then again, they've all got most extraordinary intuition--a perfectly  marvellous gift of reading faces. By George, sir," the Colonel  exclaimed, growing hot and red at the memory of that afternoon on  the Holkers' lawn, "I don't like to see those women's eyes fixed  upon my cheek when there's anything going on I don't want them to  know. A man's transparent like glass before them. They see into  his very soul. They look right through him."    
"If the lady who founded the family habits was a fortune-teller,"  the manager interposed, with a scientific air, "that's not so  remarkable; for fortune-tellers must always be quick-witted people,  keen to perceive the changes of countenance in the dupes who employ  them, and prompt at humouring all the fads and fancies of their  customers, mustn't they?"    
"Quite so," the Colonel echoed. "You've hit it on the nail. And  this particular lady--Esmeralda they call her, so that Elma, which  is short for Esmeralda, understand, has come to be the regular  Christian name among all her women descendants--this particular  lady belonged to what you might call a caste or priestly family,  as it were, of hereditary fortune-tellers, every one of whose  ancestors had been specially selected for generations for the work,  till a kind of transmissible mesmeric habit got developed among  them. And they do say," the Colonel went on, lowering his voice a  little more to a confidential whisper, "that all the girls descended  from Madame Esmeralda--Lady Ewes of Charlwood, as she was in  England--retain to this day another still odder and uncannier mark  of their peculiar origin; but, of course, it's a story that would  be hard to substantiate, though I've heard it discussed more than  once among the friends of the family."    
"Dear me! What's that?" the manager asked, in a tone of marked  curiosity.    
"Why, they do say," the Colonel went on, now fairly launched upon  a piece of after-dinner gossip, "that the eastern snake-dance of  Madame Esmeralda's people is hereditary even still among the women  of the family, and that, sooner or later, it breaks out unexpectedly  in every one of them. When the fit comes on, they shut themselves  up in their own rooms, I've been told, and twirl round and round  for hours like dancing dervishes, with anything they can get in  their hands to represent a serpent, till they fall exhausted with  the hysterical effort. Even if a woman of Esmeralda's blood escapes  it at all other times, it's sure to break out when she first sees  a real live snake, or falls in love for the first time. Then the  dormant instincts of the race come over her with a rush, at the  very dawn of womanhood, all quickened and aroused, as it were, in  the general awakening."    
"That's very curious!" the manager said, leaning back in his chair  in turn, and twirling his thumbs, "very curious indeed; and yet, in  its way, very probable, very probable. For habits like those must  set themselves deep in the very core of the system, don't you think,  Colonel? If this woman, now, was descended from a whole line of  ancestresses, who had all been trained for their work into a sort  of ecstatic fervour, the ecstasy and all that went with it must  have got so deeply ingrained--"    
"I beg your pardon," the Colonel interrupted, consulting his  watch and seizing his hat hastily--for as a Kelmscott, he refused  point-blank to be lectured--"I've an appointment at my club at  half-past three, and I must not wait any longer. Well, you'll get  these young men's address for me, then, at the very earliest possible  opportunity?"    
The manager pocketed the snub, and bowed his farewell. "Oh,  certainly," he answered, trying to look as pleased and gracious as  his features would permit. "Our confidential clerk will hunt them  up immediately. We're delighted to be of use to you. Good morning.  Good morning."    
And as soon as the Colonel's back was turned, the manager rang twice  on his sharp little bell for the confidential clerk to receive  his orders.    
Mr. Montague Nevitt immediately presented himself in answer to the  summons.    
"Mr. Nevitt," the manager said, with a dry, small cough, "here's a  bit of business of the most domestic kind--strict seal of secrecy,  not a word on any account. Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate wants to  know where two young men, named Guy and Cyril Waring, keep their  banking account, if any; and, as soon as he knows, he wishes to  pay in a substantial sum, quite privately, to their credit."    
Mr. Montague Nevitt bowed a bow of assent; without the faintest  sign of passing recognition. "Guy and Cyril Waring," he repeated to  himself, looking close at the scrap of paper his chief had handed  him; "Guy and Cyril Waring, Staple Inn, Holborn. I can find out  to-day, sir, if you attach any special and pressing importance to  promptitude in the matter."
