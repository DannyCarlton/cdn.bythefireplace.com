<b>EDWARD ROWLAND SILL, DIED FEBRUARY 27, 1887</b> 
I held his letter in my hand,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And even while I read<br> The lightning flashed across the land<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The word that he was dead. 
How strange it seemed! His living voice<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was speaking from the page<br> Those courteous phrases, tersely choice,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Light-hearted, witty, sage. 
I wondered what it was that died!<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man himself was here,<br> His modesty, his scholar's pride,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His soul serene and clear. 
These neither death nor time shall dim,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still this sad thing must be--<br> Henceforth I may not speak to him,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he can speak to me!
