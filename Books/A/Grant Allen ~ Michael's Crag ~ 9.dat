From that day forth, by some unspoken compact, it was "Eustace" and  "Cleer," wherever they met, between them. Le Neve began it, by coming  round in the afternoon of that self-same day, as soon as he'd slept  off the first effects of his fatigue and chill, to inquire of Mrs.  Trevennack "how Cleer was getting on" after her night's exposure. And  Mrs. Trevennack accepted the frank usurpation in very good part, as  indeed was no wonder, for Cleer had wanted to know half an hour before  whether "Eustace" had yet been round to ask after her. The form of  speech told all. There was no formal engagement, and none of the party  knew exactly how or when they began to take it for granted; but from  that evening on Michael's Crag it was a tacitly accepted fact between  Le Neve and the Trevennacks that Eustace was to marry Cleer as soon as  he could get a permanent appointment anywhere.    
Engineering, however, is an overstocked profession. In that particular  it closely resembles most other callings.    
The holidays passed away, and Walter Tyrrel recovered, and the  Trevennacks returned to town for the head of the house to take up his  new position in the Admiralty service; but Eustace Le Neve heard of no  opening anywhere for an energetic young man with South American  experience. Those three years he had passed out of England, indeed,  had made him lose touch with other members of his craft. People  shrugged their shoulders when they heard of him, and opined, with a  chilly smile, he was the sort of young man who ought to go to the  colonies. That's the easiest way of shelving all similar questions.  The colonies are popularly regarded in England as the predestined  dumping-ground for all the fools and failures of the mother-country.  So Eustace settled down in lodgings in London, not far from the  Trevennacks, and spent more of his time, it must be confessed, in  going round to see Cleer than in perfecting himself in the knowledge  of his chosen art. Not that he failed to try every chance that lay  open to him--he had far too much energy to sit idle in his chair and  let the stream of promotion flow by unattempted; but chances were few  and applicants were many, and month after month passed away to his  chagrin without the clever young engineer finding an appointment  anywhere. Meanwhile, his little nest-egg of South-American savings was  rapidly disappearing; and though Tyrrel, who had influence with  railway men, exerted himself to the utmost on his friend's behalf--  partly for Cleer's sake, and partly for Eustace's own--Le Neve saw his  balance growing daily smaller, and began to be seriously alarmed at  last, not merely for his future prospects of employment and marriage,  but even for his immediate chance of a modest livelihood.    
Nor was Mrs. Trevennack, for her part, entirely free from sundry  qualms of conscience as to her husband's condition and the  rightfulness of concealing it altogether from Cleer's accepted lover.  Trevennack himself was so perfectly sane in every ordinary relation of  life, so able a business head, so dignified and courtly an English  gentleman, that Eustace never even for a moment suspected any  undercurrent of madness in that sound practical intelligence. Indeed,  no man could talk with more absolute common sense about his daughter's  future, or the duties and functions of an Admiralty official, than  Michael Trevennack. It was only to his wife in his most confidential  moments that he ever admitted the truth as to his archangelic  character; to all others whom he met he was simply a distinguished  English civil servant of blameless life and very solid judgment. The  heads of his department placed the most implicit trust in Trevennack's  opinion; there was no man about the place who could decide a knotty  point of detail off-hand like Michael Trevennack. What was his poor  wife to do, then? Was it her place to warn Eustace that Cleer's father  might at any moment unexpectedly develop symptoms of dangerous  insanity? Was she bound thus to wreck her own daughter's happiness?  Was she bound to speak out the very secret of her heart which she had  spent her whole life in inducing Trevennack himself to bottle up with  ceaseless care in his distracted bosom?    
And yet ... she saw the other point of view as well--alas, all too  plainly. She was a martyr to conscience, like Walter Tyrrel himself;  was it right of her, then, to tie Eustace for life to a girl who was  really a madman's daughter? This hateful question was up before her  often in the dead dark night, as she lay awake on her bed, tossing and  turning feverishly; it tortured her in addition to her one lifelong  trouble. For the silver-haired lady had borne the burden of that  unknown sorrow locked up in her own bosom for fifteen years; and it  had left on her face such a beauty of holiness as a great trouble  often leaves indelibly stamped on women of the same brave, loving  temperament.    
One day, about three months later, in their drawing-room at Bayswater,  Eustace Le Neve happened to let drop a casual remark which cut poor  Mrs. Trevennack to the quick, like a knife at her heart. He was  talking of some friend of his who had lately got engaged. "It's a  terrible thing," he said, seriously. "There's insanity in the family.  I wouldn't marry into such a family as that--no, not if I loved a girl  to distraction, Mrs. Trevennack. The father's in a mad-house, you  know; and the girl's very nice now, but one never can tell when the  tendency may break out. And then--just think! what an inheritance to  hand on to one's innocent children!"    
Trevennack took no open notice of what he said. But Mrs. Trevennack  winced, grew suddenly pale, and stammered out some conventional none-  committing platitude. His words entered her very soul. They stung and  galled her. That night she lay awake and thought more bitterly to  herself about the matter than ever. Next morning early, as soon as  Trevennack had set off to catch the fast train from Waterloo to  Portsmouth direct (he was frequently down there on Admiralty  business), she put on her cloak and bonnet, without a word to Cleer,  and set out in a hansom all alone to Harley Street.    
The house to which she drove was serious-looking and professional--in  point of fact, it was Dr. Yate-Westbury's, the well-known specialist  on mental diseases. She sent up no card and gave no name. On the  contrary, she kept her veil down--and it was a very thick one. But Dr.  Yate-Westbury made no comment on this reticence; it was a familiar  occurrence with him--people are often ashamed to have it known they  consult a mad-doctor.    
"I want to ask you about my husband's case," Mrs. Trevennack began,  trembling. And the great specialist, all attention, leaned forward and  listened to her.    
Mrs. Trevennack summoned up courage, and started from the very  beginning. She described how her husband, who was a government  servant, had been walking below a cliff on the seashore with their  only son, some fifteen years earlier, and how a shower of stones from  the top had fallen on their heads and killed their poor boy, whose  injuries were the more serious. She could mention it all now with  comparatively little emotion; great sorrows since had half obliterated  that first and greatest one. But she laid stress upon the point that  her husband had been struck, too, and was very gravely hurt--so  gravely, indeed, that it was weeks before he recovered physically.    
"On what part of the head?" Yate-Westbury asked, with quick medical  insight.    
And Mrs. Trevennack answered, "Here," laying her small gloved hand on  the center of the left temple.    
The great specialist nodded. "Go on," he said, quietly. "Fourth  frontal convolution! And it was a month or two, I have no doubt,  before you noticed any serious symptoms supervening?"    
"Exactly so," Mrs. Trevennack made answer, very much relieved. "It was  all of a month or two. But from that day forth--from the very  beginning, I mean--he had a natural horror of going <i>beneath</i> a cliff,  and he liked to get as high up as he could, so as to be perfectly sure  there was nobody at all anywhere above to hurt him." And then she went  on to describe in short but graphic phrase how he loved to return to  the place of his son's accident, and to stand for hours on lonely  sites overlooking the spot, and especially on a crag which was  dedicated to St. Michael.    
The specialist caught at what was coming with the quickness, she  thought, of long experience. "Till he fancied himself the archangel?"  he said, promptly and curiously.    
Mrs. Trevennack drew a deep breath of satisfaction and relief. "Yes,"  she answered, flushing hot. "Till he fancied himself the archangel.  There--there were extenuating circumstances, you see. His own name's  Michael; and his family--well, his family have a special connection  with St. Michael's Mount; their crest's a castled crag with 'Stand  fast, St. Michael's!' and he knew he had to fight against this mad  impulse of his own--which he felt was like a devil within him--for his  daughter's sake; and he was always standing alone on these rocky high  places, dedicated to St. Michael, till the fancy took full hold upon  him; and now, though he knows in a sort of a way he's mad, he believes  quite firmly he's St. Michael the Archangel."    
Yate-Westbury nodded once more. "Precisely the development I should  expect to occur," he said, "after such an accident."    
Mrs. Trevennack almost bounded from her seat in her relief. "Then you  attribute it to the accident first of all?" she asked, eagerly.    
"Not a doubt about it," the specialist answered. "The region you  indicate is just the one where similar illusory ideas are apt to arise  from external injuries. The bruise gave the cause, and circumstances  the form. Besides, the case is normal--quite normal altogether. Does  he have frequent outbreaks?"    
Mrs. Trevennack explained that he never had any. Except to herself,  and that but seldom, he never alluded to the subject in any way.    
Yate-Westbury bit his lip. "He must have great self-control," he  answered, less confidently. "In a case like that, I'm bound to admit,  my prognosis--for the final result--would be most unfavorable. The  longer he bottles it up the more terrible is the outburst likely to be  when it arrives. You must expect that some day he will break out  irrepressibly."    
Mrs. Trevennack bowed her head with the solemn placidity of despair.  "I'm quite prepared for that," she said, quietly; "though I try hard  to delay it, for a specific reason. That wasn't the question I came to  consult you about to-day. I feel sure my poor husband's case is  perfectly hopeless, as far as any possibility of cure is concerned;  what I want to know is about another aspect of the case." She leaned  forward appealingly. "Oh, doctor," she cried, clasping her hands, "I  have a dear daughter at home--the one thing yet left me. She's engaged  to be married to a young man whom she loves--a young man who loves  her. Am I bound to tell him she's a madman's child? Is there any  chance of its affecting her? Is the taint hereditary?"    
She spoke with deep earnestness. She rushed out with it without  reserve. Yate-Westbury gazed at her compassionately. He was a kind-  hearted man. "No; certainly not," he answered, with emphasis. "Not the  very slightest reason in any way to fear it. The sanest man, coming  from the very sanest and healthiest stock on earth, would almost  certainly be subject to delusions under such circumstances. This is  accident, not disease--circumstance, not temperament. The injury to  the brain is the result of a special blow. Grief for the loss of his  son, and brooding over the event, no doubt contributed to the  particular shape the delusion has assumed. But the injury's the main  thing. I don't doubt there's a clot of blood formed just here on the  brain, obstructing its functions in part, and disturbing its due  relations. In every other way, you say, he's a good man of business.  The very apparent rationality of the delusion--the way it's been led  up to by his habit of standing on cliffs, his name, his associations,  his family, everything--is itself a good sign that the partial  insanity is due to a local and purely accidental cause. It simulates  reason as closely as possible. Dismiss the question altogether from  your mind, as far as your daughter's future is concerned. Its no more  likely to be inherited than a broken leg or an amputated arm is."    
Mrs. Trevennack burst into a flood of joyous tears. "Then all I have  to do," she sobbed out, "is to keep him from an outbreak until after  my daughter's married."    
Dr. Yate-Westbury nodded. "That's all you have to do," he answered,  sympathetically. "And I'm sure Mrs. Trevennack---" he paused with a  start and checked himself.    
"Why, how do you know my name?" the astonished mother cried, drawing  back with a little shudder of half superstitious alarm at such  surprising prescience.    
Dr. Yate-Westbury made a clean breast of it. "Well, to tell the  truth," he said, "Mr. Trevennack himself called round here yesterday,  in the afternoon, and stated the whole case to me from his own point  of view, giving his name in full--as a man would naturally do--but  never describing to me the nature of his delusion. He said it was too  sacred a thing for him to so much as touch upon; that he knew he  wasn't mad, but that the world would think him so; and he wanted to  know, from something he'd heard said, whether madness caused by an  injury of the sort would or would not be considered by medical men as  inheritable. And I told him at once, as I've told you to-day, there was not  the faintest danger of it. But I never made such a slip in my life before  as blurting out the name. I could only have done it to you. Trust me,  your secret is safe in my keeping. I have hundreds in my head." He  took her hand in his own as he spoke. "Dear madam," he said, gently,"  I understand; I feel for you."    
"Thank you," Mrs. Trevennack answered low, with tears standing in her  eyes. "I'm--I'm so glad you've <i>seen</i> him. It makes your opinion so much  more valuable to me. But you thought his delusion wholly due to the  accident, then?"    
"Wholly due to the accident, dear lady. Yes, wholly, wholly due to it.  You may go home quite relieved. Your doubts and fears are groundless.  Miss Trevennack may marry with a clear conscience."
