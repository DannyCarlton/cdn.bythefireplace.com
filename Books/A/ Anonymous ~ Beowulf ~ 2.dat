Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,<br> leader beloved, and long he ruled<br> in fame with all folk, since his father had gone<br> away from the world, till awoke an heir,<br> haughty Healfdene, who held through life,<br> sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.<br> Then, one after one, there woke to him,<br> to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:<br> Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;<br> and I heard that -- was -- 's queen,<br> the Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear.<br> To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,<br> such honor of combat, that all his kin<br> obeyed him gladly till great grew his band<br> of youthful comrades. It came in his mind<br> to bid his henchmen a hall uprear,<br> ia master mead-house, mightier far<br> than ever was seen by the sons of earth,<br> and within it, then, to old and young<br> he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,<br> save only the land and the lives of his men.<br> Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,<br> for many a tribe this mid-earth round,<br> to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,<br> in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,<br> of halls the noblest: Heorot[1] he named it<br> whose message had might in many a land.<br> Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,<br> treasure at banquet: there towered the hall,<br> high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting<br> of furious flame.[2] Nor far was that day<br> when father and son-in-law stood in feud<br> for warfare and hatred that woke again.[3]<br> With envy and anger an evil spirit<br> endured the dole in his dark abode,<br> that he heard each day the din of revel<br> high in the hall: there harps rang out,<br> clear song of the singer. He sang who knew[4]<br> tales of the early time of man,<br> how the Almighty made the earth,<br> fairest fields enfolded by water,<br> set, triumphant, sun and moon<br> for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,<br> and braided bright the breast of earth<br> with limbs and leaves, made life for all<br> of mortal beings that breathe and move.<br> So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel<br> a winsome life, till one began<br> to fashion evils, that field of hell.<br> Grendel this monster grim was called,<br> march-riever[5] mighty, in moorland living,<br> in fen and fastness; fief of the giants<br> the hapless wight a while had kept<br> since the Creator his exile doomed.<br> On kin of Cain was the killing avenged<br> by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.<br> Ill fared his feud,[6] and far was he driven,<br> for the slaughter's sake, from sight of men.<br> Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,<br> Etins[7] and elves and evil-spirits,<br> as well as the giants that warred with God<br> weary while: but their wage was paid them! 
[1] That is, "The Hart," or "Stag," so called from decorations in the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer. This hall has been carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne. The building was rectangular, with opposite doors -- mainly west and east -- and a hearth in the middle of th single room. A row of pillars down each side, at some distance from the walls, made a space which was raised a little above the main floor, and was furnished with two rows of seats. On one side, usually south, was the high-seat midway between the doors. Opposite this, on the other raised space, was another seat of honor. At the banquet soon to be described, Hrothgar sat in the south or chief high-seat, and Beowulf opposite to him. The scene for a flying (see below, v.499) was thus very effectively set. Planks on trestles -- the "board" of later English literature -- formed the tables just in front of the long rows of seats, and were taken away after banquets, when the retainers were ready to stretch them- selves out for sleep on the benches. 
[2] Fire was the usual end of these halls. See v. 781 below. One thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the Nibelungen, of the Nialssaga, of Saxo's story of Amlethus, and many a less famous instance. 
[3] It is to be supposed that all hearers of this poem knew how Hrothgar's hall was burnt, -- perhaps in the unsuccessful attack made on him by his son-in-law Ingeld. 
[4] A skilled minstrel. The Danes are heathens, as one is told presently; but this lay of beginnings is taken from Genesis. 
[5] A disturber of the border, one who sallies from his haunt in the fen and roams over the country near by. This probably pagan nuisance is now furnished with biblical credentials as a fiend or devil in good standing, so that all Christian Englishmen might read about him. "Grendel" may mean one who grinds and crushes.

THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene<br> with the woe of these days; not wisest men<br> assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,<br> loathly and long, that lay on his folk,<br> most baneful of burdens and bales of the night. 
This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,<br> great among Geats, of Grendel's doings.<br> He was the mightiest man of valor<br> in that same day of this our life,<br> stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker<br> he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,<br> far o'er the swan-road he fain would seek,<br> the noble monarch who needed men!<br> The prince's journey by prudent folk<br> was little blamed, though they loved him dear;<br> they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.<br> And now the bold one from bands of Geats<br> comrades chose, the keenest of warriors<br> e'er he could find; with fourteen men<br> the sea-wood[1] he sought, and, sailor proved,<br> led them on to the land's confines.<br> Time had now flown;[2] afloat was the ship,<br> boat under bluff. On board they climbed,<br> warriors ready; waves were churning<br> sea with sand; the sailors bore<br> on the breast of the bark their bright array,<br> their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,<br> on its willing way, the well-braced craft.<br> Then moved o'er the waters by might of the wind<br> that bark like a bird with breast of foam,<br> till in season due, on the second day,<br> the curved prow such course had run<br> that sailors now could see the land,<br> sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,<br> headlands broad. Their haven was found,<br> their journey ended. Up then quickly<br> the Weders'[3] clansmen climbed ashore,<br> anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing<br> and gear of battle: God they thanked<br> or passing in peace o'er the paths of the sea.<br> Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,<br> a warden that watched the water-side,<br> how they bore o'er the gangway glittering shields,<br> war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him<br> to know what manner of men they were.<br> Straight to the strand his steed he rode,<br> Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might<br> he shook his spear, and spake in parley.<br> "Who are ye, then, ye armed men,<br> mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel<br> have urged thus over the ocean ways,<br> here o'er the waters? A warden I,<br> sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,<br> lest any foe to the folk of Danes<br> with harrying fleet should harm the land.<br> No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,<br> linden-wielders:[4] yet word-of-leave<br> clearly ye lack from clansmen here,<br> my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw I<br> of warriors in world than is one of you, --<br> yon hero in harness! No henchman he<br> worthied by weapons, if witness his features,<br> his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell<br> your folk and home, lest hence ye fare<br> suspect to wander your way as spies<br> in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,<br> ocean-travellers, take from me<br> simple advice: the sooner the better<br> I hear of the country whence ye came."

To him the stateliest spake in answer;<br> the warriors' leader his word-hoard unlocked: --<br> "We are by kin of the clan of Geats,<br> and Hygelac's own hearth-fellows we.<br> To folk afar was my father known,<br> noble atheling, Ecgtheow named.<br> Full of winters, he fared away<br> aged from earth; he is honored still<br> through width of the world by wise men all.<br> To thy lord and liege in loyal mood<br> we hasten hither, to Healfdene's son,<br> people-protector: be pleased to advise us!<br> To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,<br> to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right<br> that aught be hidden. We hear -- thou knowest<br> if sooth it is -- the saying of men,<br> that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,<br> dark ill-doer, in dusky nights<br> shows terrific his rage unmatched,<br> hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I<br> in greatness of soul would succor bring,<br> so the Wise-and-Brave[1] may worst his foes, --<br> if ever the end of ills is fated,<br> of cruel contest, if cure shall follow,<br> and the boiling care-waves cooler grow;<br> else ever afterward anguish-days<br> he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place<br> high on its hill that house unpeered!"<br> Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered,<br> clansman unquailing: "The keen-souled thane<br> must be skilled to sever and sunder duly<br> words and works, if he well intends.<br> I gather, this band is graciously bent<br> to the Scyldings' master. March, then, bearing<br> weapons and weeds the way I show you.<br> I will bid my men your boat meanwhile<br> to guard for fear lest foemen come, --<br> your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean<br> faithfully watching till once again<br> it waft o'er the waters those well-loved thanes,<br> -- winding-neck'd wood, -- to Weders' bounds,<br> heroes such as the hest of fate<br> shall succor and save from the shock of war."<br> They bent them to march, -- the boat lay still,<br> fettered by cable and fast at anchor,<br> broad-bosomed ship. -- Then shone the boars[2]<br> over the cheek-guard; chased with gold,<br> keen and gleaming, guard it kept<br> o'er the man of war, as marched along<br> heroes in haste, till the hall they saw,<br> broad of gable and bright with gold:<br> that was the fairest, 'mid folk of earth,<br> of houses 'neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,<br> and the gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar.<br> The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright<br> burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go<br> straightway thither; his steed then turned,<br> hardy hero, and hailed them thus: --<br> "Tis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty<br> in grace and mercy guard you well,<br> safe in your seekings. Seaward I go,<br> 'gainst hostile warriors hold my watch." 
[1] Hrothgar. 
[2] Beowulf's helmet has several boar-images on it; he is the "man of war"; and the boar-helmet guards him as typical representative of the marching party as a whole. The boar was sacred to Freyr, who was the favorite god of the Germanic tribes about the North Sea and the Baltic. Rude representations of warriors show the boar on the helmet quite as large as the helmet itself.

STONE-BRIGHT the street:[1] it showed the way<br> to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened<br> hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright<br> the steel ring sang, as they strode along<br> in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.<br> There, weary of ocean, the wall along<br> they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,<br> and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,<br> war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,<br> spears of the seafarers stood together,<br> gray-tipped ash: that iron band<br> was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud<br> asked of the heroes their home and kin.<br> "Whence, now, bear ye burnished shields,<br> harness gray and helmets grim,<br> spears in multitude? Messenger, I,<br> Hrothgar's herald!

HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings: --<br> "I knew him of yore in his youthful days;<br> his aged father was Ecgtheow named,<br> to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat<br> his only daughter. Their offspring bold<br> fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.<br> And seamen, too, have said me this, --<br> who carried my gifts to the Geatish court,<br> thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men's<br> heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand,<br> the bold-in-battle. Blessed God<br> out of his mercy this man hath sent<br> to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,<br> against horror of Grendel. I hope to give<br> the good youth gold for his gallant thought.<br> Be thou in haste, and bid them hither,<br> clan of kinsmen, to come before me;<br> and add this word, -- they are welcome guests<br> to folk of the Danes."<br> [To the door of the hall<br> Wulfgar went] and the word declared: --<br> "To you this message my master sends,<br> East-Danes' king, that your kin he knows,<br> hardy heroes, and hails you all<br> welcome hither o'er waves of the sea!<br> Ye may wend your way in war-attire,<br> and under helmets Hrothgar greet;<br> but let here the battle-shields bide your parley,<br> and wooden war-shafts wait its end."<br> Uprose the mighty one, ringed with his men,<br> brave band of thanes: some bode without,<br> battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.<br> Then hied that troop where the herald led them,<br> under Heorot's roof: [the hero strode,]<br> hardy 'neath helm, till the hearth he neared.<br> Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed,<br> war-net woven by wit of the smith: --<br> "Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac's I,<br> kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty<br> have I gained in youth! These Grendel-deeds<br> I heard in my home-land heralded clear.<br> Seafarers say how stands this hall,<br> of buildings best, for your band of thanes<br> empty and idle, when evening sun<br> in the harbor of heaven is hidden away.<br> So my vassals advised me well, --<br> brave and wise, the best of men, --<br> O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,<br> for my nerve and my might they knew full well.<br> Themselves had seen me from slaughter come<br> blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,<br> and that wild brood worsted.

[1] The nicor, says Bugge, is a hippopotamus; a walrus, says ten Brink. But that water-goblin who covers the space from Old Nick of jest to the Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale, is all one needs, and Nicor is a good name for him.

HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings'-helmet: --<br> "For fight defensive, Friend my Beowulf,<br> to succor and save, thou hast sought us here.<br> Thy father's combat[1] a feud enkindled<br> when Heatholaf with hand he slew<br> among the Wylfings; his Weder kin<br> for horror of fighting feared to hold him.<br> Fleeing, he sought our South-Dane folk,<br> over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,<br> when first I was ruling the folk of Danes,<br> wielded, youthful, this widespread realm,<br> this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,<br> my elder brother, had breathed his last,<br> Healfdene's bairn: he was better than I!<br> Straightway the feud with fee[2] I settled,<br> to the Wylfings sent, o'er watery ridges,<br> treasures olden: oaths he[3] swore me.<br> Sore is my soul to say to any<br> of the race of man what ruth for me<br> in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,<br> what sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,<br> my warriors wane; for Wyrd hath swept them<br> into Grendel's grasp. But God is able<br> this deadly foe from his deeds to turn!<br> Boasted full oft, as my beer they drank,<br> earls o'er the ale-cup, armed men,<br> that they would bide in the beer-hall here,<br> Grendel's attack with terror of blades.<br> Then was this mead-house at morning tide<br> dyed with gore, when the daylight broke,<br> all the boards of the benches blood-besprinkled,<br> gory the hall: I had heroes the less,<br> doughty dear-ones that death had reft.<br> -- But sit to the banquet, unbind thy words,<br> hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee." 
Gathered together, the Geatish men<br> in the banquet-hall on bench assigned,<br> sturdy-spirited, sat them down,<br> hardy-hearted. A henchman attended,<br> carried the carven cup in hand,<br> served the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang<br> blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,<br> no dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.

UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,<br> who sat at the feet of the Scyldings' lord,<br> unbound the battle-runes.[1] -- Beowulf's quest,<br> sturdy seafarer's, sorely galled him;<br> ever he envied that other men<br> should more achieve in middle-earth<br> of fame under heaven than he himself. --<br> "Art thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival,<br> who emulous swam on the open sea,<br> when for pride the pair of you proved the floods,<br> and wantonly dared in waters deep<br> to risk your lives? No living man,<br> or lief or loath, from your labor dire<br> could you dissuade, from swimming the main.<br> Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered,<br> with strenuous hands the sea-streets measured,<br> swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm<br> rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea<br> a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,<br> had more of main! Him at morning-tide<br> billows bore to the Battling Reamas,<br> whence he hied to his home so dear<br> beloved of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,<br> fastness fair, where his folk he ruled,<br> town and treasure. In triumph o'er thee<br> Beanstan's bairn[2] his boast achieved.<br> So ween I for thee a worse adventure<br> -- though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been,<br> in struggle grim, -- if Grendel's approach<br> thou darst await through the watch of night!" 
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "What a deal hast uttered, dear my Unferth,<br> drunken with beer, of Breca now,<br> told of his triumph! Truth I claim it,<br> that I had more of might in the sea<br> than any man else, more ocean-endurance.<br> We twain had talked, in time of youth,<br> and made our boast, -- we were merely boys,<br> striplings still, -- to stake our lives<br> far at sea: and so we performed it.<br> Naked swords, as we swam along,<br> we held in hand, with hope to guard us<br> against the whales. Not a whit from me<br> could he float afar o'er the flood of waves,<br> haste o'er the billows; nor him I abandoned.<br> Together we twain on the tides abode<br> five nights full till the flood divided us,<br> churning waves and chillest weather,<br> darkling night, and the northern wind<br> ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge.<br> Now the wrath of the sea-fish rose apace;<br> yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat,<br> hard and hand-linked, help afforded, --<br> battle-sark braided my breast to ward,<br> garnished with gold. There grasped me firm<br> and haled me to bottom the hated foe,<br> with grimmest gripe. 'Twas granted me, though,<br> to pierce the monster with point of sword,<br> with blade of battle: huge beast of the sea<br> was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine.

ME thus often the evil monsters<br> thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,<br> the darling, I dealt them due return!<br> Nowise had they bliss from their booty then<br> to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,<br> seated to banquet at bottom of sea;<br> but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,<br> on the edge of ocean up they lay,<br> put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them<br> on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk<br> are never molested. -- Light from east,<br> came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,<br> so that I saw the sea-cliffs high,<br> windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth<br> earl undoomed if he doughty be!<br> And so it came that I killed with my sword<br> nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles<br> ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's dome,<br> nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!<br> Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,<br> though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,<br> flood of the tide, on Finnish land, <br> the welling waters. No wise of thee<br> have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,<br> bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet,<br> not one of you pair, in the play of war<br> such daring deed has done at all<br> with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --<br> though thou wast the bane[1] of thy brethren dear,<br> thy closest kin, whence curse of hell<br> awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!<br> For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,<br> never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,<br> monster dire, on thy master dear,<br> in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine<br> were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!<br> But he has found no feud will happen;<br> from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan<br> he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.<br> He forces pledges, favors none<br> of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,<br> fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads<br> from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now<br> shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,<br> shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead<br> go he that listeth, when light of dawn<br> this morrow morning o'er men of earth,<br> ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!"<br> Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,<br> hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited<br> the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing,<br> folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.<br> Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding<br> with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,<br> queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,<br> gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;<br> and the high-born lady handed the cup<br> first to the East-Danes' heir and warden,<br> bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,<br> the land's beloved one. Lustily took he<br> banquet and beaker, battle-famed king. 
Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,<br> to younger and older everywhere<br> carried the cup, till come the moment<br> when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,<br> to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.<br> She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,<br> in wisdom's words, that her will was granted,<br> that at last on a hero her hope could lean<br> for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,<br> hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand,<br> and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.<br> Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br> "This was my thought, when my thanes and I<br> bent to the ocean and entered our boat,<br> that I would work the will of your people<br> fully, or fighting fall in death,<br> in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do<br> an earl's brave deed, or end the days<br> of this life of mine in the mead-hall here."<br> Well these words to the woman seemed,<br> Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold<br> the stately dame by her spouse sat down.<br> Again, as erst, began in hall<br> warriors' wassail and words of power,<br> the proud-band's revel, till presently<br> the son of Healfdene hastened to seek<br> rest for the night; he knew there waited<br> fight for the fiend in that festal hall,<br> when the sheen of the sun they saw no more,<br> and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,<br> and shadowy shapes came striding on,<br> wan under welkin. The warriors rose.<br> Man to man, he made harangue,<br> Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,<br> let him wield the wine hall: a word he added: --<br> "Never to any man erst I trusted,<br> since I could heave up hand and shield,<br> this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.<br> Have now and hold this house unpeered;<br> remember thy glory; thy might declare;<br> watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee<br> if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life."

THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,<br> defence-of-Scyldings, forth from hall;<br> fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,<br> couch of his queen. The King-of-Glory<br> against this Grendel a guard had set,<br> so heroes heard, a hall-defender,<br> who warded the monarch and watched for the monster.<br> In truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted<br> his mettle, his might, the mercy of God!<br> Cast off then his corselet of iron,<br> helmet from head; to his henchman gave, --<br> choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,<br> bidding him guard the gear of battle.<br> Spake then his Vaunt the valiant man,<br> Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought: --<br> "Of force in fight no feebler I count me,<br> in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.<br> Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death<br> his life will I give, though it lie in my power.<br> No skill is his to strike against me,<br> my shield to hew though he hardy be,<br> bold in battle; we both, this night,<br> shall spurn the sword, if he seek me here,<br> unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,<br> sacred Lord, on which side soever<br> doom decree as he deemeth right."<br> Reclined then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held<br> the head of the earl, while all about him<br> seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.<br> None of them thought that thence their steps<br> to the folk and fastness that fostered them,<br> to the land they loved, would lead them back!<br> Full well they wist that on warriors many<br> battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,<br> of Danish clan. But comfort and help,<br> war-weal weaving, to Weder folk<br> the Master gave, that, by might of one,<br> over their enemy all prevailed,<br> by single strength. In sooth 'tis told<br> that highest God o'er human kind<br> hath wielded ever! -- Thro' wan night striding,<br> came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors slept<br> whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, --<br> all save one. 'Twas widely known<br> that against God's will the ghostly ravager<br> him[1] could not hurl to haunts of darkness;<br> wakeful, ready, with warrior's wrath,<br> bold he bided the battle's issue.
