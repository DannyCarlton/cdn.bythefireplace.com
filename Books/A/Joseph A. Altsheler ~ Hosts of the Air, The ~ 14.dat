They said very little now. John drove on through a great happy silence.  All the omens were good, and he believed that they would escape. Surely,  fortune was with them when they had been able to come so far without  challenge. The sun swam over the earth and threw golden beams into the  valley. On their right a swift stream chattered over the stones and  further away on their left rose the steep slopes, heavy with forest.  They passed farmers and shepherds who had little time to take notice, as  they saw the great machine but a moment, and then it was gone.    
John had his mind set on escape by the way of the Adriatic. He had heard  rumors that Italy might enter the war on the side of the Allies, but he  knew that it had not yet taken any action and he had high hopes of  finding a path to safety in that direction. Meanwhile, and whatever came  of it, he must press on.    
Toward noon he slackened speed, and they ate a little from the supplies  they carried in the automobile. Just as they finished Suzanne held up  her hand: "I think I hear another machine coming," she said.    
"You are right," said John, after he had listened intently for a full  minute. "It's the humming sound of tires, but it's only one automobile.  Of that I'm sure, and I think it's a light one. We'll drive on at  moderate speed, attending strictly to our own business."    
But he loosened the revolver in his belt, and while he appeared to look  straight ahead he had eye and ear also for the approaching machine,  which obviously was coming at a great pace.    
"It's a small automobile with only one person in it," said Julie.    
"Then we have nothing to fear," said John. "But the figure of the man at  the wheel looks familiar."    
"Ah!" said John, drawing a deep breath. In that region a familiar face  could scarcely be the face of a friend. He stiffened a little, and cast  another look at the revolver in his belt to see that it was convenient  to his hand. Then, to indicate that he was not running away and to  prevent suspicion, he slackened the speed of the machine. As he did so  the humming behind them rapidly grew louder and a light runabout drew up  by their side. John uttered a cry of amazement as he saw the man at the  wheel.    
It was Weber, the Alsatian, in civilian clothing, his black beard  trimmed nicely to a point, his eyes flashing a smile of welcome, as he  took off his cap and bowed low to John and Mademoiselle Julie Lannes,  but lower to Julie. John brought his machine down to a slow pace, and  there was room for Weber's by their side in the road.    
"You never dreamed of being overtaken by me here," said the Alsatian,  smiling again, and showing his white teeth.    
"No," replied John. "It never occurred to me that it was you behind us."    
"After all, I am, I think, your good angel. In your flight with  Mademoiselle Lannes you need advice and guidance, and I can give both."    
"You do appear at the most opportune times. It has become a habit for  which I am grateful."    
"It's not chance that I'm here. It's pursuit and design. You know my  duties as a spy, an ugly name, perhaps, but one that calls for daring  and patriotism. Hearing of the council held at Zillenstein by Prince  Karl of Auersperg I went there to learn what I could of it. The  information that I was able to secure is in the hands of a confederate  now on his way to Paris, and I remained to probe into the mystery of  Mademoiselle Lannes' disappearance."    
"Then you learned of the hunting lodge on the mountain?"    
"Very quickly. I discovered, too, that Mademoiselle Lannes and her maid  had been taken away by a young chauffeur, coming from somewhere in  Lorraine, who had been only a short time at the castle. Knowing you for  what you are, Mr. Scott, and understanding your devotion, I leaped at  once to the conclusion that it was you. I slipped away as soon as the  snow melted sufficiently, and was the first from the outside world to  reach the lodge. The absence of the limousine, the tire tracks leading  toward Tellnitz and other evidence at the lodge showed without doubt  that my conclusions were right."    
"And you followed immediately?"    
"Without delay. I reached Tellnitz, where you stopped, obtained this  light machine and came on at speed. It will be my pleasure to help as  much as I can you and the sister of the great Philip Lannes, the first  aviator of France."    
"You left France after we did, Monsieur Weber," said Julie. "Did you  hear anything of Philip?"    
"That he had recovered fully of his wound, Mademoiselle, and that he and  the <i>Arrow</i> were once more in the service of his country. He knows of  your abduction by Prince Karl of Auersperg. A friend, an aviator,  Delaunois, furnished him with many facts, and I cannot doubt that he  will come over Austria in the <i>Arrow</i> to seek your rescue."    
The eyes of Julie, John and Suzanne, as with one impulse, turned upward.  It seemed to John, for a moment or two, that his vivid imagination could  fairly create the slender and graceful shape of Philip's aeroplane,  outlined against the sky. But the heavens were flawless, a pure,  unbroken blue, without speck or stain, and he suppressed a little sigh  of disappointment.    
"Do you know the country at all?" he asked of Weber.    
"Somewhat. It was a part of my work before the war to pass through all  the regions of Germany and Austria, and learn as much of them as I  could. At the end of this valley is a small village called Obenstein,  where perhaps it would be wise for us to spend the next night. After  that we must devise some method of getting out of Austria--and I do not  seek to conceal from you that it will be a most difficult task. Perhaps  it would be better to change your plan and enter Switzerland, a neutral  country. It, of course, would end your service as a soldier, but that, I  take it, would be no great hardship to you now."    
The color came into John's face, but he was bound to admit that Weber  was right. His interest in the war had become far less than his interest  in Julie Lannes.    
"Perhaps we can tell better after we spend the night at Obenstein," he  said.    
"Nothing can be hurt by reserving our verdict until tomorrow," said  Weber. "Obenstein is very secluded. I believe that it has neither  telephone nor telegraph, and we'll surely be able to leave it tomorrow  before any pursuit can reach us."    
"Do you think the plan a good one?" said John to Julie.    
"I know of no better," she replied in English. "I trust to you and Mr.  Weber."    
"Then it's agreed," said John to Weber.    
"It's agreed."    
The Alsatian now led the way in his light machine, and the limousine  followed at an interval of fifty or sixty yards. One hour, then two and  three passed, and nothing came in the way of their easy and rapid  progress. It all seemed too smooth and fortunate to John. It was  incredible that they could travel thus great distances through Austria,  the land of the enemy. He knew that chance had a way of finding a  balance, and violent and fierce events might be before them.    
But as he drove on he scanned the heavens now and then with a questing  eye. It had not occurred to him until Weber spoke that all of them might  escape through the air. Lannes would trail them, not on the earth, but  through mists and clouds. He would come, too, with friends almost as  daring and skillful as himself, perhaps with Caumartin and the two,  Castelneau and Mery, who had responded to the thrilling signal near  Salzburg, when he took his first flight. His blood leaped and danced,  and once more his eyes roved over the blue in search of the <i>Arrow.</i>    
They came to Obenstein a little before dusk. It was a tiny village,  almost hidden in a recess of the mountain, with a shaggy pine forest  rising above it and casting its shadow over the houses. But there was a  small, neat inn, and a garage for the machines, and the guests were  received with the same hospitality that had been shown at Tellnitz. John  again spread the rumor that it was a princess of the house of Auersperg  who came, and he added Weber to the list of those who were attending her  in her flight to a safer region. Julie withdrew as before to her room  with her maid, but giving John, before she went, the brilliant smile of  faith and confidence that would have sent him, sword in hand, against  dragons.    
He and Weber sat awhile in the little smoking-room talking in low tones  of their journey. Most of the time they were alone, a waiter merely  passing through now and then, and they had no fear of being overheard.    
"Weber," he said, "I've learned from the innkeeper that a mountain road  leads from here toward Switzerland and I feel sure already that your  suggestion about our escaping into that country is good. You, of course,  when you reach the border will do as you choose, as you will want to  continue the dangerous work upon which you're engaged. But you may be  sure that if we do get through, Mademoiselle Lannes and I will never  forget the help that you have given us."    
"All that I do I do gladly," said Weber. "You may not have spoken to  each other but it is easy for me to tell how matters stand between  Mademoiselle Lannes and you."    
John was silent but his color deepened.    
"You must not mind my saying these things," said Weber, speaking easily.  "I'm older than you and the times are unusual. When you reach Paris you  and Mademoiselle Lannes will be married."    
John was still silent.    
"And you will take her to America for the present, or at least Until the  war is over. Ah, well! You're a happy man! Youth and the springtime!  Beauty and love! Kings can procure no more and seldom as much! I think  I'll walk in the air a little and have a smoke."    
"And I," said John, "will go to sleep. I've a tiny room on the ground  floor, but it's big enough to hold me. Good night."    
"Good night, Mr. Scott."    
There was only a single window in John's little room, but before  undressing he opened it and stood there to breathe the cool night air  for a while. It looked upon the forest that ran up the slope of the  mountain, and the odor of the pines was very pleasant. Looking idly at  the trunks and the foliage he saw a shadow pass into the depths of the  forest and something, a pulse in his temple, perhaps, struck a warning  note.    
A shiver ran down his back and his hair lifted, as if touched with  electric sparks. Acting at once under impulse he touched the pistol  inside the pocket of his jacket to see that it was all right, and  slipped out of the room.    
He had marked the point at which the shadow disappeared in the forest  and he followed it on light foot. He had been awakened as if a stroke of  lightning had blazed suddenly before his eyes, and now his brain was  seething with fierce thoughts, called up by a long chain of incidents,  all at once made complete.    
His hand slipped again to the revolver and he drew it forth, holding it  ready for instant use. Then he went forward swiftly again on noiseless  steps, and once more he caught a glimpse of the flitting shadow straight  ahead. He increased his speed and the shadow resolved itself into the  figure of a man, a figure that seemed familiar to him.    
Two or three times the man stopped and looked back, but John had shrunk  behind a tree and no pursuit was visible. Then he resumed his rapid  flight up the steep slope, and young Scott persistently followed, never  once losing sight of the active figure.    
The way led to the crest of the mountain which hung about two thousand  feet above the village and it was a climb requiring some time and  endurance, but though John's pulse beat fast it was with excitement and  not with exhaustion. At the summit he saw the figure emerge upon an open  space upon which stood a slender round tower of considerable height.    
John stopped at the edge of the pines and saw the figure disappear  within the tower, upon the summit of which something presently began to  flash and crackle. He caught his breath and the blood leaped fiercely  through his veins. He knew that the tower was a wireless signal station  and that it was talking to another somewhere. It sent, too, as he well  knew, through the velvety blue of the night the message that  Mademoiselle Julie Lannes, Suzanne, her maid, and John Scott, the  American, were in the village of Obenstein where they could be taken.    
He cursed himself for a fool, thrice a fool! Why had he not understood  long before? Why had he not seen that so many coincidences could not be  the result of chance? Only design and skill could have brought them  about! Who had disabled the automobile in that flight with Carstairs and  Wharton from the Germans? Who had sought to delay Lannes until he could  be caught by the enemy? Who was the mysterious man in the aeroplane who  had wounded Philip, who had led John from the chateau under the very  rifles of the waiting marksmen, and who had been responsible for Julie's  capture at Chastel? That letter, purporting to be from Philip, and  directing her to come to Chastel, was surely a forgery!    
These and all the other details crashed upon him with cumulative force,  and he was so mad with fury that he thought his heart would burst with  the surging blood. Why had the man worked with such energy and such  cruel persistence against him? But his wonder quickly passed, because  the reason did not matter now. Instead he put his finger on the trigger  of the automatic and waited.    
The wireless flashed and crackled for five minutes, then five minutes of  silence and the figure of Weber reappeared at the base of the tower. He  lingered there for a little space looking warily about him, before he  began the descent of the mountain, and John quietly withdrew further  into the pines. Weber presently crossed the open space, entering the  forest, and John, noiseless, retreated before him.    
Thus they proceeded down the mountain until the wireless tower was left  several hundred yards behind and they were buried deep in the pine  forest. Then John stepped suddenly into the road not twenty yards before  the Alsatian and leveling his automatic said sharply:    
"Hands up, Weber!"    
Weber started violently and slowly raised his hands. But he said with  composure:    
"Why this sudden violence, Mr. Scott?"    
"Because you have been upon the wireless tower signaling to our  enemies. I've just understood everything, Weber. You're a German and not  a French spy, and you've played the traitor to Julie and Philip Lannes  and me all along."    
There was enough moonlight for John to see that Weber's face was  distorted by an evil smile.    
"You've been a trifle slow in discovering just what I am," he said,  calmly. "I've wondered that a young man of your perception didn't find  me out earlier."    
John flushed. The Alsatian's effrontery, in truth, had been amazing and  in that perhaps lay his success--so far.    
"It's true," he said, "I should have suspected you sooner, but it did  not occur to me that human nature could be so vile. To undertake such  risks and to use so much trickery and guile there must be a powerful  motive, and in your case I can't guess it. Now, Weber, why did you do  it?"    
"Let me drop my hands, Mr. Scott, and I'll answer you," said Weber.  "It's difficult to argue a case in such a strained and awkward  position."    
"Put them down, then, but remember that I'm watching you, and that I'm  willing to shoot. Now, go ahead. Why have you been such a persistent  enemy of Mademoiselle Lannes, her brother and myself? Why have you been  such a triple traitor?"    
"Don't call me a traitor, because a traitor I am not. On the contrary I  am loyal with a loyalty of which you, John Scott, an American, know  nothing. I've called myself an Alsatian, but really I am not. I am an  Austrian. I was born on the Zillenstein estate of Prince Karl of  Auersperg. My family has served his for a thousand years. Great as I  hold Hapsburg and Hohenzollern, Auersperg means even more to me. The  Auerspergs are the very essence and spirit of that aristocracy and rule  of the very highborn, in which I believe and to which your country and  later the French have stood in the exact opposite. Every time that my  pulse beats within me it beats with the wish that you and all that you  stand for should fail."    
John did not feel the slightest doubt of Weber's sincerity. The  increasing moonlight, falling in a silver flood across his face, showed  too clearly his earnestness. Yet that earnestness was not good to look  upon. It was sinister, tinged strongly with the beliefs of an old and  wicked past. He too, like his master, was of the Middle Ages.    
"And so in all these deeds you were serving Prince Karl of Auersperg?"  said John.    
"To the death. It was a false escape that I planned for you at the  chateau. You were to have been shot down, but by an unlucky chance you  escaped in the water."    
"I've surmised that already."    
"I'm an aviator, not so great as your friend Lannes, but no mean one  nevertheless. It was I who pursued him, when you were with him in the  <i>Arrow</i> near Paris, and wounded him."    
"I've surmised that, too."    
"And when Prince Karl coveted Mademoiselle Julie Lannes--and I do not  blame him--I was of the most help to him in that matter so near to his  heart. Do you understand that it was a great honor he offered  Mademoiselle Lannes, to make her his morganatic wife? He need not have  offered her so much."    
The great pulse in John's throat beat heavily and his hand pressed the  automatic, but he compressed his lips and said nothing.    
"I see that my words anger you," continued Weber, "but from my point of  view I am right. I serve my overlord!"    
"What message were you sending by the wireless from the tower?"    
"Doubtless you have guessed it. I was sending word to the detachment now  on the road from Zillenstein to come here for Mademoiselle Lannes, her  maid and you. They're ahorse, and they should arrive in three hours and  you can't possibly escape. Before Prince Karl was compelled to leave for  the theater of war he put this most important affair in my charge. He  has not yet yielded all hope of Mademoiselle Lannes."    
"It may be true that we can't escape, but what of yourself, Weber? We're  alone in the forest and I hold the whip hand. The score that I owe you  is large. You may have wrecked the life of Mademoiselle Julie and  perhaps you will destroy my own, but you said it would be three hours  before the detachment arrived, and I need only a few seconds."    
"But I don't think you'll fire, Mr. Scott."    
"Why, Weber?"    
"Because I fire first!"    
Absorbed in the talk John had unconsciously lowered the automatic, and,  as agile as a panther, Weber suddenly leaped to one side, snatched a  revolver from his own pocket and pulled the trigger. But the bullet flew  wild. A huge shadow hovered over him and a weight crashed upon his head,  smiting him down as if he had been struck by a giant shell. He sank in  the path and lay motionless, dead ere he fell.    
John stared, stricken with horror. The great shadow bent down a moment  over the fallen man, then straightened itself up again, and two eyes in  which the vengeful fire had not yet died gazed at John. Then as his  dazed mind cleared he saw and knew. It was Antoine Picard, the gigantic  and faithful servitor of the Lannes family.    
"Antoine! Antoine!" cried John. "How did you come here? I thought you  were in Munich!"    
"It seems, your honor, that I'm here at the right moment. His bullet  would certainly have found your heart had not my club descended upon his  head at the very instant that his finger touched the trigger. He'll  never stir again."    
"But Antoine, it's you, yourself! It doesn't seem real that you should  be here at such a time!"    
"It's none other than Antoine Picard, your honor, and he never struck a  truer or more timely blow. They were to hold me a prisoner in Munich,  but I escaped. I did not return to France. I could never desert  Mademoiselle Julie, and I followed. My size drew their attention, but in  one way or another I kept down suspicion or escaped them. I traced  Mademoiselle Julie and my daughter to the great castle and then to the  lodge on the mountain. I saw the traitor who lies so justly dead here  talking with German troops, and I knew that there was need for me to  hasten. In the night I stole the horse of a Uhlan and galloped to  Obenstein.    
"I approached the inn just in time to see the traitor come forth, and  knowing that he was bent upon some devil's work I followed him to the  signal tower. I did not see you until he started back and then I bided  my time. I was in the bush not ten feet from him while you talked."    
"Lucky for your mistress and lucky for us all that you were, Picard!"    
"We must leave Obenstein, your honor, at once!"    
"Of course, Picard. We must take flight in the machine."    
"As it would be hard to explain my presence, your honor, suppose I wait  down the road for you. I've already turned the horse loose in the  forest. First I'll move this from the path lest someone see it and give  the alarm too soon."    
He lifted the body of Weber and hid it among the bushes. Then they  separated, John returning quickly to the inn. He saw a light in Julie's  window and inferring that she had not yet retired he went hastily to her  room and knocked on the door.    
"Who's there?" came the brave voice of his beloved.    
"It's John!" he replied, guardedly. "Open at once, Julie! We're in great  danger and must act quickly!"    
He heard the bolt shoot back, the door was opened, and Julie stood  before him, pale but erect and courageous. Behind her, as usual, hovered  the protecting shadow of Suzanne. John stepped inside and closed the  door.    
"Julie," he said, in a whisper, sharp with anxiety, "we must leave  Obenstein in fifteen minutes! Weber is a traitor in the service of  Prince Karl of Auersperg! He followed us to get you back to him! He has  been signaling from a wireless station on the mountain! A detachment of  hussars will be here in three hours!"    
Her pallor deepened, but the courage that he loved still glowed in her  eyes.    
"But Weber?" she said. "He will stop our flight?"    
"He will never harm us more, Julie. He is dead."    
"You--"    
"No, Julie, I did not kill him. It was a stronger arm than mine that  struck the blow. Suzanne, your father is waiting for us in the forest.  He has followed us all the way from Munich to Zillenstein, to the lodge,  and here to Obenstein. It was he who sent Weber to the doom that he  deserved."    
"Ah!" said Suzanne, and John saw her stern eyes shining. She was the  worthy daughter of her father.    
"Put on your cloaks and hoods at once," said John, "and I'll have the  automobile out in a few minutes! It doesn't matter what they think at  the inn. We disregard it and fly."    
Suzanne, quick and capable, began to prepare her mistress and John went  down to the innkeeper. He was so swift and emphatic that the worthy  Austrian was dazed, and, after all a princess of the house of Auersperg  had a right to her whims. It was not for him to question the minds of  the great, and the heavy gold piece that John dropped into his hands was  potent to allay undue curiosity.    
The automobile properly equipped was before the main door of the inn  within ten minutes. John helped into it the hooded and cloaked figure of  the great lady, and her maid, also hooded and cloaked, followed. Then he  sprang into his own seat, turned the wheel, and the huge machine shot  down the road. But at the first curve it slackened speed, then stopped  for an instant beside a dark figure, and when it went on again four  instead of three rode.    
Picard sat beside his daughter and in those two faithful hearts was no  doubt of their escape.    
"Antoine," said Julie, "I know that we owe our lives to you."    
She offered him a small gloved hand. It rested in his giant grasp a  moment, then he raised it to his lips and kissed it.    
"I'd have followed you across the world, my lady," he said.    
"I know it, Antoine."    
John, watching intently, sent the machine forward at fair speed. The  road again stretched before him lone and white in the moonlight, which  fell in a heavy silver shower. He did not know where they were going,  but there was the road, and the hussars could not ride hard enough to  overtake them. Now and then he stole a glance at Julie, and the same  indomitable courage was always shining in her eyes. She was not weary  and she was as wide awake as he. By and by both Antoine and Suzanne  slept, sitting upright, but Julie, wrapped almost to the eyes in cloak  and hood, was still quiet, watching everything with wide fearless eyes.  John brought the machine down to a slow pace and guided it for the  moment with one hand.    
"Julie," he said softly, "I don't know where we're going, but I know  that we'll escape, and knowing it I now have something to ask you."    
"What is it, John?"    
"When we reach Paris, you'll marry me, Julie?"    
"Yes, John, I'll marry you."    
The other hand came from the wheel and as he leaned back, they kissed in  the moonlight. The great machine ran on, unguided but true. They kissed  again in the moonlight, and for a splendid moment or two her arms were  about his neck.    
"Julie," whispered John, "will your mother consent?"    
"Yes, when I tell her to do so."    
"And Philip?"    
"Yes, without telling."    
The automobile, still unguided, ran on straight and true as if it were  alive, and knew that it carried the precious freight of two young and  faithful hearts, and that nothing else in all the world was so tender  and true as young love.    
Far in the night, when the road had climbed up the hills, John saw a  light flashing and winking in the valley, and from a more distant point  another light winked and flashed in reply. He read the fiery signals and  he knew that the alarm was abroad. The hussars had come to Obenstein,  only to find that the birds had flown, and doubtless, too, to find among  the bushes the dead body of Weber, Prince Karl's most trusted and  unscrupulous agent. Julie had gone to sleep at last and Antoine and  Suzanne slumbered on.    
He alone watched and worked, and for a few moments he felt a chill of  dread. The hussars would spread the alarm and the whole country would  now be seeking them. He saw a road turning from the main one, and  leading deeper into the mountains. Instinctively he followed it, like an  animal seeking hiding in the wilderness, and now the machine rose fast  on the slopes, dense forest lining the way on either side. Far below in  the valley the lights and the wireless signals talked incessantly to one  another and the hounds were hot on the chase.    
It was about halfway between midnight and morning when John stopped the  machine among dense pines on the very crest of a mountain, where the  road, without any reason, seemed to end. Antoine awoke with a start and,  springing out, began to curse himself under his breath for having gone  to sleep.    
"Take no blame, Antoine," said John. "You could have done nothing then,  and it was much better for you to have slept. You now have back all your  strength and we may need it."    
Julie awoke with a start and after a moment or two of bewilderment  understood. Then she gave John that old brilliant, flashing look,  softened now by the memory of a kiss when no hand was at the wheel.    
"Julie," said John, trusting as ever in her courage, "we seem to have  come to the end of things. Our enemies are in the valley following us,  and it's not hard to trace the path of our automobile. I don't know how  many will come, but Antoine and I can make a stand with the rifles."    
"All hope is not yet lost!" said Suzanne, in a voice as deep as that of  a man. "Remember that when the earth cannot hide us the air may open to  receive us. Remember, too, Mademoiselle Julie, that your brother seeks  you, and when the time comes we are to look aloft."    
Driven again by that extraordinary impulse, John and Julie gazed up. But  they saw only the dancing stars in the blue velvet of the sky.    
"He may come! He may come in time!" said Suzanne, speaking like an  inspired prophet of old, and her manner carried conviction. John,  clinging to the last desperate hope, recalled how Lannes and he had  summoned Castelneau and Mery from the sky to save them, and though it  was a wild hope he resolved to send up the same signal.    
It was a quick task to gather dry wood and build a little heap, Julie  and Suzanne helping with energy and enthusiasm. There were plenty of  matches in the car, and presently John lighted the heap, which crackled  and sent up leaping tongues of flame.    
"It may serve also as a signal to those who follow us," he said, "but  we must take the chance. Cavalry can't reach us except by the road that  we came and with our rifles we can hold it a long time."    
The mention of the word "rifle," put a thought in the head of Antoine  Picard, in whose veins the blood of Vikings flowed, and who that night  was a veritable Viking of the land. Leaving John and the two women to  feed the signal fire, he secured one of the powerful breech-loading  rifles from the automobile, and quietly stole down the path.    
Antoine, although he held a modern weapon in his hand, had shed  centuries of civilization. As still as death as he trod lightly in the  dark road, he was, nevertheless, consumed with the wild Berserk rage  against those who followed him. He knew that hussars would soon appear  on the slope, but he intended that a lion should be in their path and he  stroked lovingly the barrel of the powerful breech-loader. Behind him  the flames were shooting higher and higher, pouring red streaks against  the velvet blue of the sky. But all of Picard's attention was  concentrated now on what lay before him.    
He heard soon the distant beat of hoofs and he drew a little to the side  of the road, down which he could see a long distance, as it stretched  straight before him, narrow and steep. He made out clearly a half dozen  figures, hussars struggling forward on tired horses, and he chuckled a  little to himself. It was a splendid weapon that he held in his hand,  and he was a great marksman. Armed as he was, he felt that he had  little to fear on that lone mountain road from six or seven horsemen.    
He pushed the rifle forward a little and waited in the shadow of the  pines. The hoofbeats rang louder, and the shadows became the distinct  figures of horses and men. Picard uttered a deep "Ah!" because he  recognized the one who led them, a powerful, erect man, the Prussian  Rudolf von Boehlen, now in the very center of the moonlight.    
When they were yet two hundred yards away, Picard stepped into the  middle of the road and called to them in a loud voice to halt. He saw  von Boehlen throw up his head, say something to his troop, and then try  to urge his horse to a faster gait.    
Picard sighed. He knew that von Boehlen was a brave man and he respected  brave men. A disagreeable task lay before him, one that must be done,  but he would give him another chance. He called again and louder than  before for them to halt, but von Boehlen came on steadily. Then Picard  promptly raised his rifle and shot him through the heart.    
When von Boehlen fell dead in the road his hussars halted and while they  were hesitating Picard shot the horses of two under them, while a third  received a bullet in the shoulder. Then all of them fled on horse or on  foot into the valley while Picard went calmly back to the fire which was  now sending its signal across the whole heavens. He told John in a  whisper of what had befallen, and soon he returned to his place in the  road to watch.    
John and Julie by and by left Suzanne to feed the fire and they stood  hand in hand gazing now at the heavens and now at the dark pine forests.  The velvet blue of the sky faded into the dark hour and then the dawn  came, edged with silver, turning to pink and then to gold, like a robe  of many colors, drawn slowly out of the infinite. Suzanne suddenly  uttered a great cry.    
"Look up! Look up, my children!" she cried.    
Coming out of the west which was yet in dusk was a black dot and then  three others--behind it in Indian file.    
"We're saved," cried Suzanne. "It's Monsieur Philip and his friends'"    
"How do you know? You can't see yet," said John, almost afraid to hope.    
"I don't need to see it! I feel it, and I know!" replied Suzanne. "Look,  how they come!"    
John trembled and the hand of Julie in his own trembled too, but it was  not fear, it was the feeling that a miracle, a miracle to save them, was  coming to pass.    
The four black dots moved on out of the west and John knew that they  were aeroplanes coming swiftly and directly toward their mountain. The  dawn reaching the zenith spread also to the west and the flying machines  were outlined clearly in the luminous golden haze. Then John, too,  uttered a great cry.    
He knew the slender sinuous shape that led. As far as eye could reach he  would recognize the <i>Arrow</i>. The miracle was done. They had called to  Philip in their desperate need and he had come.    
"Philip and the <i>Arrow</i>!" he exclaimed. "We're saved!"    
"I knew that he would come!" Julie said, as she stared wide-eyed into  the blue and gold of the heavens.    
Now the aeroplanes flew at almost incredible speed, the <i>Arrow</i> always  at their head, poised for a few moments directly over their heads, and  then came down in a dazzling series of spirals, landing almost at their  feet.    
"Philip, my brother!" exclaimed Julie, as the slender compact figure  that they knew so well stepped gracefully from the <i>Arrow</i>.    
He took off his heavy glasses and gazed at them as they stood,  forgetting that they were still hand in hand. Then he smiled and lifting  his cap in his old dramatic way he said:    
"It seems that for several reasons I didn't come too soon."    
"No," replied John, calmly, and holding firmly the little hand in his,  "you have arrived just in time to give your consent to my marriage with  your sister."    
"And what does Mademoiselle Julie Lannes say?"    
The rising sun clothed Julie in a shower of gold. Never before had the  wonderful golden hair seemed more wonderful. Never before had she seemed  to the youthful eyes of her lover more nearly divine.    
"Julie Lannes says," she replied bravely, "that if John Scott wishes her  to be his wife and her mother and brother consent she will gladly marry  him."    
"Then we must hurry away, or it will be a wedding; without either a  bride or a bridegroom. Are not those Austrian hussars at the bottom of  the slope, Picard?"    
"Yes, monsieur."    
"Then it's up and away with us. Here are Caumartin, Mery and Castelneau,  old friends of yours, John, but it was Delaunois who brought me the last  news of you. Caumartin has the <i>Omnibus</i>, and in it the bridal pair must  travel. I can't take you with me in the <i>Arrow</i> now, John, as it admits  of only a single passenger. But do you, Picard, take the rifles and come  with me. We'll cover the rear of our flight. Now, hasten! Hasten!"    
John and Julie in an instant were side by side in the <i>Omnibus</i>, Picard,  forgetting all fear of aeroplanes, was with Philip, and the four  machines rose, circling above the mountain, Caumartin's big plane  leading. John and Julie sat very close together and her hand was again  in his.    
"Fear not, dearest," he said. "When all seemed lost Philip came for us."    
"But you came for me first and you risked your life many times. To give  myself to you seems but a small reward for all that you've done."    
"It's a reward that kings and princes in their power cannot win."    
Then they fell silent, their emotion too deep for speech. Philip had  spoken in jest, but it was almost like a wedding trip. The hussars below  had reached the abandoned automobile, and fired vain shots at the  disappearing aeroplanes, but John and Julie heeded them not. War and  brute passions were left behind, and they were sailing through the calm  blue ether.    
Caumartin, the stalwart, was wholly absorbed in steering his great  machine and they sat behind him, very close together, still hand in  hand, watching the great panorama of the heavens, unrolled before them.  It was the most beautiful sky that they had ever seen, dyed that day  into intensely vivid colors by the master hand. Far away were great pink  terraces of color, changing to blue or gold or silver, while below them  revolved the earth, clad in deepest green, save where far peaks were  crested with snow.    
Both John and Julie breathed an infinite peace. The war sank farther and  farther away, as they sailed on through peaceful heavens, surcharged  with infinite color. Both felt, with the certainty of truth, that their  troubles and dangers were over, and they now left the journey and its  needs to Philip and his able comrades.    
"After we're married, Julie, you'll go to America with me for awhile,"  said John, "but we'll come back to France. We shall divide our time  between two homes, your country and mine, now the countries of both."    
The hand within his own returned his pressure. Caumartin turned his  machine toward the north, avoiding neutral Switzerland, and sailing at  great speed they passed beyond the German lines and over the fair land  of France that all of them loved so well.    
Caumartin kept his place in front. Suzanne was in the machine just  behind and Philip and Picard in the <i>Arrow</i> always hovered in the rear.  That night they descended within the French lines, and John heard the  next day that Prince Karl of Auersperg had been killed in battle. It was  singular, perhaps, but John felt a touch of pity for him. He had wanted  something very greatly and, powerful prince though he was, his power had  not been great enough to win it for him.

They were married in Notre Dame by the Archbishop of Paris. The  influence of John's uncle, the senator and great mining millionaire, was  sufficient to procure John's release from the army. In truth, General  Vaugirard, although he was fat and sixty, had a strong vein of  sentiment, and he was one of the most distinguished guests in Notre  Dame, where he puffed mightily and kept himself with great difficulty  from whistling his approval. He and Senator Pomeroy stood together and  he nodded emphatically when the senator told him, with a certain pride  in his whisper, that while John, his sole heir, was not a prince, he  could buy and sell many who were.    
General Vaugirard was not the only distinguished officer at the  marriage. There was a lull in the operations and all of John's friends  came to Paris to see him wed the beautiful Julie Lannes. A little man,  with the brow of a Napoleon, the famous general, Bougainville, whose  rise had been so astonishing, stood beside General Vaugirard.    
Daniel Colton, now a colonel, his arm in a sling, was not far away.  Carstairs was there, a bandage about his head, and Wharton was with him,  his shoulder yet sore from the path that a bullet had made through it.  It was decreed that while these friends of John's should receive many  wounds, all of them were to survive the great war.    
They were to spend three days at the little house beyond the Seine  before sailing, and as the twilight came on they sat together and looked  out over the City of Light, melting into the dusk after a golden day.  The subdued hum of Paris came to them in a note of infinite sweetness  and peace.    
John was stirred to the depths, but his emotion, like that of most deep  natures, was quiet. He felt Julie's hand tremble a little in his own, as  the voice of Paris grew fainter but sweeter. The twilight faded into the  night and the buildings grew misty.    
"We have passed through many dangers, Julie," said John, "but for me at  least the reward is greater than them all. When did you begin to love  me?"    
"You were my gallant knight from the first, but, if it had not been so,  how could I have kept from loving the fearless crusader who dared all  and who risked his life every day in the country of the enemy to save  me?"    
"I'd have been a poor and worthless creature if I hadn't done so,  Julie."    
"Few men have done so, though, even for love."    
Stirred by an emotion deeper than ever, and wholly pure, he put his  arms around her, and their lips met in a long kiss of young love.    
The first dusk thinned away, the sky turned to a vault of burnished  silver, and, the infinite stars coming out, danced their approval.
