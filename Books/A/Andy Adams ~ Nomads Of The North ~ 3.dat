  As they stood in the warm sunshine of this first day of June,   watching the last of Makoos as he fled across the creek bottom,  Neewa  felt very much like an old and seasoned warrior instead of a   pot-bellied, round-faced cub of four months who weighed nine  pounds  and not four hundred. 
  It was many minutes after Neewa had sunk his ferocious little   teeth deep into the tenderest part of the old he-bear's toe before   Noozak could get her wind sufficiently to grunt. Her sides were   pumping like a pair of bellows, and after Makoos had disappeared   beyond the creek Neewa sat down on his chubby bottom, perked his   funny ears forward, and eyed his mother with round and glistening   eyes that were filled with uneasy speculation. With a wheezing  groan  Noozak turned and made her way slowly toward the big rock  alongside  which she had been sleeping when Neewa's fearful cries  for help had  awakened her. Every bone in her aged body seemed  broken or dislocated.  She limped and sagged and moaned as she  walked, and behind her were  left little red trails of blood in the  green grass. Makoos had given  her a fine pummeling. 
  She lay down, gave a final groan, and looked at Neewa, as if to   say: 
  &quot;If you hadn't gone off on some deviltry and upset that old   viper's temper this wouldn't have happened. And now&#8212;look at ME!&quot; 
  A young bear would have rallied quickly from the effects of the   battle, but Noozak lay without moving all the rest of that  afternoon,  and the night that followed. And that night was by all  odds the finest  that Neewa had ever seen. Now that the nights were  warm, he had come  to love the moon even more than the sun, for by  birth and instinct he  was more a prowler in darkness than a hunter  of the day. The moon rose  out of the east in a glory of golden  fire. The spruce and balsam  forests stood out like islands in a  yellow sea of light, and the creek  shimmered and quivered like a  living thing as it wound its way through  the glowing valley. But  Neewa had learned his lesson, and though the  moon and the stars  called to him he hung close to his mother,  listening to the  carnival of night sound that came to him, but never  moving away  from her side. 
  With the morning Noozak rose to her feet, and with a grunting   command for Neewa to follow she slowly climbed the sun-capped  ridge.  She was in no mood for travel, but away back in her head  was an  unexpressed fear that villainous old Makoos might return,  and she knew  that another fight would do her up entirely, in which  event Makoos  would make a breakfast of Neewa. So she urged herself  down the other  side of the ridge, across a new valley, and through  a cut that opened  like a wide door into a rolling plain that was  made up of meadows and  lakes and great sweeps of spruce and cedar  forest. For a week Noozak  had been making for a certain creek in  this plain, and now that the  presence of Makoos threatened behind  she kept at her journeying until  Neewa's short, fat legs could  scarcely hold up his body. 
  It was mid-afternoon when they reached the creek, and Neewa was so   exhausted that he had difficulty in climbing the spruce up which  his  mother sent him to take a nap. Finding a comfortable crotch he  quickly  fell asleep&#8212;while Noozak went fishing. 
  The creek was alive with suckers, trapped in the shallow pools   after spawning, and within an hour she had the shore strewn with   them. When Neewa came down out of his cradle, just at the edge of   dusk, it was to a feast at which Noozak had already stuffed  herself  until she looked like a barrel. This was his first meal of  fish, and  for a week thereafter he lived in a paradise of fish. He  ate them  morning, noon, and night, and when he was too full to eat  he rolled in  them. And Noozak stuffed herself until it seemed her  hide would burst.  Wherever they moved they carried with them a  fishy smell that grew  older day by day, and the older it became  the more delicious it was to  Neewa and his mother. And Neewa grew  like a swelling pod. In that week  he gained three pounds. He had  given up nursing entirely now, for  Noozak&#8212;being an old bear&#8212;had  dried up to a point where she was  hopelessly disappointing. 
  It was early in the evening of the eighth day that Neewa and his   mother lay down in the edge of a grassy knoll to sleep after their   day's feasting. Noozak was by all odds the happiest old bear in  all  that part of the northland. Food was no longer a problem for  her. In  the creek, penned up in the pools, were unlimited  quantities of it,  and she had encountered no other bear to  challenge her possession of  it. She looked ahead to uninterrupted  bliss in their happy hunting  grounds until midsummer storms  emptied the pools, or the berries  ripened. And Neewa, a happy  little gourmand, dreamed with her. 
  It was this day, just as the sun was setting, that a man on his   hands and knees was examining a damp patch of sand five or six  miles  down the creek. His sleeves were rolled up, baring his brown  arms  halfway to the shoulders and he wore no hat, so that the  evening  breeze ruffled a ragged head of blond hair that for a  matter of eight  or nine months had been cut with a hunting knife. 
  Close on one side of this individual was a tin pail, and on the   other, eying him with the keenest interest, one of the homeliest  and  yet one of the most companionable-looking dog pups ever born  of a  Mackenzie hound father and a mother half Airedale and half  Spitz. 
  With this tragedy of blood in his veins nothing in the world could   have made the pup anything more than &quot;just dog.&quot; His tail,&#8212;   stretched out straight on the sand, was long and lean, with a knot  at  every joint; his paws, like an overgrown boy's feet, looked  like small  boxing-gloves; his head was three sizes too big for his  body, and  accident had assisted Nature in the perfection of her  masterpiece by  robbing him of a half of one of his ears. As he  watched his master  this half of an ear stood up like a galvanized  stub, while the  other&#8212;twice as long&#8212;was perked forward in the  deepest and most  interested enquiry. Head, feet, and tail were  Mackenzie hound, but the  ears and his lank, skinny body was a  battle royal between Spitz and  Airedale. At his present  inharmonious stage of development he was the  doggiest dog-pup  outside the alleys of a big city. 
  For the first time in several minutes his master spoke, and Miki   wiggled from stem to stern in appreciation of the fact that it was   directly to him the words were uttered. 
  &quot;It's a mother and a cub, as sure as you're a week old, Miki,&quot; he   said. &quot;And if I know anything about bears they were here some time   to-day!&quot; 
  He rose to his feet, made note of the deepening shadows in the   edge of the timber, and filled his pail with water. For a few  moments  the last rays of the sun lit up his face. It was a strong,  hopeful  face. In it was the joy of life. And now it was lighted up  with a  sudden inspiration, and a glow that was not of the forest  alone came  into his eyes, as he added: 
  &quot;Miki, I'm lugging your homely carcass down to the Girl because   you're an unpolished gem of good nature and beauty&#8212;and for those  two  things I know she'll love you. She is my sister, you know.  Now, if I  could only take that cub along with you&#8212;&#8212;&quot; 
  He began to whistle as he turned with his pail of water in the   direction of a thin fringe of balsams a hundred yards away. 
  Close at his heels followed Miki. 
  Challoner, who was a newly appointed factor of the Great Hudson's   Bay Company, had pitched his camp at tie edge of the lake dose to  the  mouth of the creek. There was not much to it&#8212;a battered tent,  a still  more battered canoe, and a small pile of dunnage. But in  the last glow  of the sunset it would have spoken volumes to a man  with an eye  trained to the wear and the turmoil of the forests. It  was the outfit  of a man who had gone unfearing to the rough edge  of the world. And  now what was left of it was returning with him.  To Challoner there was  something of human comradeship in these  remnants of things that had  gone through the greater part of a  year's fight with him. The canoe  was warped and battered and  patched; smoke and storm had blackened his  tent until it was the  colour of rusty char, and his grub sacks were  next to empty. 
  Over a small fire title contents of a pan and a pot were brewing   when he returned with Miki at his heels, and close to the heat was  a  battered and mended reflector in which a bannock of flour and  water  was beginning to brown. In one of the pots was coffee, in  the other a  boiling fish. 
  Miki sat down on his angular haunches so that the odour of the   fish filled his nostrils. This, he had discovered, was the next  thing  to eating. His eyes, as they followed Challoner's final  preparatory  movements, were as bright as garnets, and every third  or fourth breath  he licked his chops, and swallowed hungrily.  That, in fact, was why  Miki had got his name. He was always  hungry, and apparently always  empty, no matter how much he ate.  Therefore his name, Miki, &quot;The  drum.&quot; 
  It was not until they had eaten the fish and the bannock, and   Challoner had lighted his pipe, that he spoke what was in his  mind. 
  &quot;To-morrow I'm going after that bear,&quot; he said. 
  Miki, curled up near the dying embers, gave his tail a club-like   thump in evidence of the fact that he was listening. 
  &quot;I'm going to pair you up with the cub, and tickle the Girl to   death.&quot; 
  Miki thumped his tail harder than before. 
  &quot;Fine,&quot; he seemed to say. 
  &quot;Just think of it,&quot; said Challoner, looking over Miki's head a   thousand miles away, &quot;Fourteen months&#8212;and at last we're going  home.  I'm going to train you and the cub for that sister of mine.  Eh, won't  you like that? You don't know what she's like, you  homely little  devil, or you wouldn't sit there staring at me like  a totem-pole pup!  And it isn't in your stupid head to imagine how  pretty she is. You saw  that sunset to-night? Well, she's prettier  than THAT if she is my  sister. Got anything to add to that, Miki?  If not, let's say our  prayers and go to bed!&quot; 
  Challoner rose and stretched himself. His muscles cracked. He felt   life surging like a giant within him. 
  And Miki, thumping his tail until this moment, rose on his   overgrown legs and followed his master into their shelter. 
  It was in the gray light of the early summer dawn when Challoner   came forth again, and rekindled the fire. Miki followed a few  moments  later, and his master fastened the end of a worn tent-rope  around his  neck and tied the rope to a sapling. Another rope of  similar length  Challoner tied to the corners of a grub sack so  that it could be  carried over his shoulder like a game bag. With  the first rose-flush  of the sun he was ready for the trail of  Neewa and his mother. Miki  set up a melancholy wailing when he  found himself left behind, and  when Challoner looked back the pup  was tugging and somersaulting at  the end of his rope like a  jumping-jack. For a quarter of a mile up  the creek he could hear  Miki's entreating protest. 
  To Challoner the business of the day was not a matter of personal   pleasure, nor was it inspired alone by his desire to possess a cub   along with Miki. He needed meat, and bear pork thus early in the   season would be exceedingly good; and above all else he needed a   supply of fat. If he bagged this bear, time would be saved all the   rest of the way down to civilization. 
  It was eight o'clock when he struck the first unmistakably fresh   signs of Noozak and Neewa. It was at the point where Noozak had   fished four or five days previously, and where they had returned   yesterday to feast on the &quot;ripened&quot; catch. Challoner was elated.  He  was sure that he would find the pair along the creek, and not  far  distant. The wind was in his favour, and he began to advance  with  greater caution, his rifle ready for the anticipated moment.  For an  hour he travelled steadily and quietly, marking every sound  and  movement ahead of him, and wetting his finger now and then to  see if  the wind had shifted. After all, it was not so much a  matter of human  cunning. Everything was in Challoner's favour. 
  In a wide, flat part of the valley where the creek split itself   into a dozen little channels, and the water rippled between sandy   bars and over pebbly shallows, Neewa and his mother were nosing  about  lazily for a breakfast of crawfish. The world had never  looked more  beautiful to Neewa. The sun made the soft hair on his  back fluff up  like that of a purring cat. He liked the plash of  wet sand under his  feet and the singing gush of water against his  legs. He liked the  sound that was all about him, the breath of the  wind, the whispers  that came out of the spruce-tops and the  cedars, the murmur of water,  the TWIT-TWIT of the rock rabbits,  the call of birds; and more than  all else the low, grunting talk  of his mother. 
  It was in this sun-bathed sweep of the valley that Noozak caught   the first whiff of danger. It came to her in a sudden twist of the   wind&#8212;the smell of man! 
  Instantly she was turned into rock. There was still the deep scar   in her shoulder which had come, years before, with that same smell  of  the one enemy she feared. For three summers she had not caught  the  taint in her nostrils and she had almost forgotten its  existence. Now,  so suddenly that it paralyzed her, it was warm and  terrible in the  breath of the wind. 
  In this moment, too, Neewa seemed to sense the nearness of an   appalling danger. Two hundred yards from Challoner he stood a   motionless blotch of jet against the white of the sand about him,  his  eyes on his mother, and his sensitive little nose trying to  catch the  meaning of the menace in the air. 
  Then came a thing he had never heard before&#8212;a splitting, cracking   roar&#8212;something that was almost like thunder and yet unlike it;  and  he saw his mother lurch where she stood and crumple down all  at once  on her fore legs. 
  The next moment she was up, with a wild WHOOF in her voice that   was new to him&#8212;a warning for him to fly for his life. 
  Like all mothers who have known the comradeship and love of a   child, Noozak's first thought was of him. Reaching out a paw she  gave  him a sudden shove, and Neewa legged it wildly for the near-  by  shelter of the timber. Noozak followed. A second shot came, and  close  over her head there sped a purring, terrible sound. But  Noozak did not  hurry. She kept behind Neewa, urging him on even as  that pain of a  red-hot iron in her groin filled her with agony.  They came to the edge  of the timber as Challoner's third shot bit  under Noozak's feet. 
  A moment more and they were within the barricade of the timber.   Instinct guided Neewa into the thickest part of it, and close  behind  him Noozak fought with the last of her dying strength to  urge him on.  In her old brain there was growing a deep and  appalling shadow,  something that was beginning to cloud her vision  so that she could not  see, and she knew that at last she had come  to the uttermost end of  her trail. With twenty years of life  behind her, she struggled now for  a last few seconds. She stopped  Neewa close to a thick cedar, and as  she had done many times  before she commanded him to climb it. Just  once her hot tongue  touched his face in a final caress. Then she  turned to fight her  last great fight. 
  Straight into the face of Challoner she dragged herself, and fifty   feet from the spruce she stopped and waited for him, her head  drooped  between her shoulders, her sides heaving, her eyes dimming  more and  more, until at last she sank down with a great sigh,  barring the trail  of their enemy. For a space, it may be, she saw  once more the golden  moons and the blazing suns of those twenty  years that were gone; it  may be that the soft, sweet music of  spring came to her again, filled  with the old, old song of life,  and that Something gracious and  painless descended upon her as a  final reward for a glorious  motherhood on earth. 
  When Challoner came up she was dead. 
  From his hiding place in a crotch of the spruce Neewa looked down   on the first great tragedy of his life, and the advent of man. The   two-legged beast made him cringe deeper into his refuge, and his   little heart was near breaking with the terror that had seized  upon  him. He did not reason. It was by no miracle of mental  process that he  knew something terrible had happened, and that  this tall, two-legged  creature was the cause of it. His little  eyes were blazing, just over  the level of the crotch. He wondered  why his mother did not get up and  fight when this new enemy came.  Frightened as he was he was ready to  snarl if she would only wake  up&#8212;ready to hurry down the tree and help  her as he had helped her  in the defeat of Makoos, the old he-bear. But  not a muscle of  Noozak's huge body moved as Challoner bent over her.  She was stone  dead. 
  Challoner's face was flushed with exultation. Necessity had made   of him a killer. He saw in Noozak a splendid pelt, and a provision  of  meat that would carry him all the rest of the way to the  southland. He  leaned his rifle against a tree and began looking  about for the cub.  Knowledge of the wild told him it would not be  far from its mother,  and he began looking into the trees and the  near-by thickets. 
  In the shelter of his crotch, screened by the thick branches,   Neewa made himself as small as possible during the search. At the  end  of half an hour Challoner disappointedly gave up his quest,  and went  back to the creek for a drink before setting himself to  the task of  skinning Noozak. 
  No sooner was he gone than Neewa's little head shot up alertly.   For a few moments he watched, and then slipped backward down the   trunk of the cedar to the ground. He gave his squealing call, but  his  mother did not move. He went to her and stood beside her  motionless  head, sniffing the man-tainted air. Then he muzzled her  jowl, butted  his nose under her neck, and at last nipped her ear&#8212;  always his last  resort in the awakening process. He was puzzled.  He whined softly, and  climbed upon his mother's big, soft back,  and sat there. Into his  whine there came a strange note, and then  out of his throat there rose  a whimpering cry that was like the  cry of a child. 
  Challoner heard that cry as he came back, and something seemed to   grip hold of his heart suddenly, and choke him. He had heard  children  crying like that; and it was the motherless cub! 
  Creeping up behind a dwarf spruce he looked where Noozak lay dead,   and saw Neewa perched on his mother's back. He had killed many  things  in his time, for it was his business to kill, and to barter  in the  pelts of creatures that others killed. But he had seen  nothing like  this before, and he felt all at once as if he had  done murder. 
  &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he breathed softly, &quot;you poor little devil; I'm   sorry!&quot; 
  It was almost a prayer&#8212;for forgiveness. Yet there was but one   thing to do now. So quietly that Neewa failed to hear him he crept   around with the wind and stole up behind. He was within a dozen  feet  of Neewa before the cub suspected danger. Then it was too  late. In a  swift rush Challoner was upon him and, before Neewa  could leave the  back of his mother, had smothered him in the folds  of the grub sack. 
  In all his life Challoner had never experienced a livelier five   minutes than the five that followed. Above Neewa's grief and his  fear  there rose the savage fighting blood of old Soominitik, his  father. He  clawed and bit and kicked and snarled. In those five  minutes he was  five little devils all rolled into one, and by the  time Challoner had  the rope fastened about Neewa's neck, and his  fat body chucked into  the sack, his hands were scratched and  lacerated in a score of places. 
  In the sack Neewa continued to fight until he was exhausted, while   Challoner skinned Noozak and cut from her the meat and fats which  he  wanted. The beauty of Noozak's pelt brought a glow into his  eyes. In  it he rolled the meat and fats, and with babiche thong  bound the whole  into a pack around which he belted the dunnage  ends of his shoulder  straps. Weighted under the burden of sixty  pounds of pelt and meat he  picked up his rifle&#8212;and Neewa. It had  been early afternoon when he  left. It was almost sunset when he  reached camp. Every foot of the  way, until the last half mile,  Neewa fought like a Spartan. 
  Now he lay limp and almost lifeless in his sack, and when Miki   came up to smell suspiciously of his prison he made no movement of   protest. All smells were alike to him now, and of sounds he made  no  distinction. Challoner was nearly done for. Every muscle and  bone in  his body had its ache. Yet in his face, sweaty and grimed,  was a grin  of pride. 
  &quot;You plucky little devil,&quot; he said, contemplating the limp sack as   he loaded his pipe for the first time that afternoon. &quot;You&#8212;you   plucky little devil!&quot; 
  He tied the end of Neewa's rope halter to a sapling, and began   cautiously to open the grub sack. Then he rolled Neewa out on the   ground, and stepped back. In that hour Neewa was willing to accept  a  truce so far as Challoner was concerned. But it was not  Challoner that  his half-blinded eyes saw first as he rolled from  his bag. It was  Miki! And Miki, his awkward body wriggling with  the excitement of his  curiosity, was almost on the point of  smelling of him! 
  Neewa's little eyes glared. Was that ill-jointed lop-eared   offspring of the man-beast an enemy, too? Were those twisting   convolutions of this new creature's body and the club-like swing  of  his tail an invitation to fight? He judged so. Anyway, here was   something of his size, and like a flash he was at the end of his  rope  and on the pup. Miki, a moment before bubbling over with  friendship  and good cheer, was on his back in an instant, his  grotesque legs  paddling the air and his yelping cries for help  rising in a wild  clamour that filled the golden stillness of the  evening with an  unutterable woe. 
  Challoner stood dumbfounded. In another moment he would have   separated the little fighters, but something happened that stopped   him. Neewa, standing squarely over Miki, with Miki's four over-  grown  paws held aloft as if signalling an unqualified surrender,  slowly drew  his teeth from the pup's loose hide. Again he saw the  man-beast.  Instinct, keener than a clumsy reasoning, held him for  a few moments  without movement, his beady eyes on Challoner. In  midair Miki wagged  his paws; he whined softly; his hard tail  thumped the ground as he  pleaded for mercy, and he licked his  chops and tried to wriggle, as if  to tell Neewa that he had no  intention at all to do him harm. Neewa,  facing Challoner, snarled  defiantly. He drew himself slowly from over  Miki. And Miki, afraid  to move, still lay on his back with his paws in  the air. 
  Very slowly, a look of wonder in his face, Challoner drew back   into the tent and peered through a rent in the canvas. 
  The snarl left Neewa's face. He looked at the pup. Perhaps away   back in some corner of his brain the heritage of instinct was  telling  him of what he had lost because of brothers and sisters  unborn&#8212;the  comradeship of babyhood, the play of children. And  Miki must have  sensed the change in the furry little black  creature who a moment ago  was his enemy. His tail thumped almost  frantically, and he swung out  his front paws toward Neewa. Then, a  little fearful of what might  happen, he rolled on his side. Still  Neewa did not move. Joyously Miki  wriggled. 
  A moment later, looking through the slit in the canvas, Challoner   saw them cautiously smelling noses.
