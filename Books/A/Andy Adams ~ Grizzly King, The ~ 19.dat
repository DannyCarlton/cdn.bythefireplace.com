  Thor heard the dogs when they were a mile away. There were two  reasons why he was even less in a mood to run from them now than a few  days before. Of the dogs alone he had no more fear than if they had  been so many badgers, or so many whistlers piping at him from the  rocks. He had found them all mouth and little fang, and easy to kill.  It was what followed close after them that disturbed him. But to-day he  had stood face to face with the thing that had brought the strange  scent into his valleys, and it had not offered to hurt him, and he had  refused to kill it. Besides, he was again seeking Iskwao, the she-bear,  and man is not the only animal that will risk his life for love.
  After killing his last dog at dusk of that fatal day when they had  pursued him over the mountain Thor had done just what Bruce thought  that he would do, and instead of continuing southward had made a wider  detour toward the north, and the third night after the fight and the  loss of Muskwa he found Iskwao again. In the twilight of that same  evening Pipoonaskoos had died, and Thor had heard the sharp cracking of  Bruce's automatic. All that night and the next day and the night that  followed he spent with Iskwao, and then he left her once more. A third  time he was seeking her when he found Langdon in the trap on the ledge,  and he had not yet got wind of her when he first heard the baying of  the dogs on his trail.
  He was travelling southward, which brought him nearer the hunters'  camp. He was keeping to the high slopes where there were little dips  and meadows, broken by patches of shale, deep coulees, and occasionally  wild upheavals of rock. He was keeping the wind straight ahead so that  he would not fail to catch the smell of Iskwao when he came near her,  and with the baying of the dogs he caught no scent of the pursuing  beasts, or of the two men who were riding behind them.
  At another time he would have played his favourite trick of  detouring so that the danger would be ahead of him, with the wind in  his favour. Caution had now become secondary to his desire to find his  mate. The dogs were less than half a mile away when he stopped  suddenly, sniffed the air for a moment, and then went on swiftly until  he was halted by a narrow ravine.
  Up that ravine Iskwao was coming from a dip lower down the mountain,  and she was running. The yelping of the pack was fierce and close when  Thor scrambled down in time to meet her as she rushed upward. Iskwao  paused for a single moment, smelled noses with Thor, and then went on,  her ears laid back flat and sullen and her throat filled with growling  menace.
  Thor followed her, and he also growled. He knew that his mate was  fleeing from the dogs, and again that deadly and slowly increasing  wrath swept through him as he climbed after her higher up the mountain.
  In such an hour as this Thor was at his worst. He was a fighter when  pursued as the dogs had pursued him a week before&#8212;but he was a demon,  terrible and without mercy, when danger threatened his mate.
  He fell farther and farther behind Iskwao, and twice lie turned, his  fangs gleaming under drawn lips, and his defiance rolling back upon his  enemies in low thunder.
  When he came up out of the coulee he was in the shadow of the peak,  and Iskwao had already disappeared in her skyward scramble. Where she  had gone was a wild chaos of rock-slide and the piled-up debris of  fallen and shattered masses of sandstone crag. The sky-line was not  more than three hundred yards above him. He looked up. Iskwao was among  the rocks, and here was the place to fight. The dogs were close upon  him now. They were coming up the last stretch of the coulee, baying  loudly. Thor turned about, and waited for them.
  Half a mile to the south, looking through his glasses, Langdon saw  Thor, and at almost the same instant the dogs appeared over the edge of  the coulee. He had ridden halfway up the mountain; from that point he  had climbed higher, and was following a well-beaten sheep trail at  about the same altitude as Thor. From where he stood the valley lay  under his glasses for miles. He did not have far to look to discover  Bruce and the Indian. They were dismounting at the foot of the coulee,  and as he gazed they ran quickly into it and disappeared.
  Again Langdon swung back to Thor. The dogs were holding him now, and  he knew there was no chance of the grizzly killing them in that open  space. Then he saw movement among the rocks higher up, and a low cry of  understanding broke from his lips as he made out Iskwao climbing  steadily toward the ragged peak. He knew that this second bear was a  female. The big grizzly&#8212;her mate&#8212;had stopped to fight. And there was  no hope for him if the dogs succeeded in holding him for a matter of  ten or fifteen minutes. Bruce and Metoosin would appear in that time  over the rim of the coulee at a range of less than a hundred yards!
  Langdon thrust his binoculars in their case and started at a run  along the sheep trail. For two hundred yards his progress was easy, and  then the patch broke into a thousand individual tracks on a slope of  soft and slippery shale, and it took him five minutes to make the next  fifty yards.
  The trail hardened again. He ran on pantingly, and for another five  minutes the shoulder of a ridge hid Thor and the dogs from him. When he  came over that ridge and ran fifty yards, down the farther side of it,  he stopped short. Further progress was barred by a steep ravine. He was  five hundred yards from where Thor stood with his back to the rocks and  his huge head to the pack.
  Even as he looked, struggling to get breath enough to shout, Langdon  expected to see Bruce and Metoosin appear out of the coulee. It flashed  upon him then that even if he could make them hear it would be  impossible for them to understand him. Bruce would not guess that he  wanted to spare the beast they had been hunting for almost two weeks.
  Thor had rushed the dogs a full twenty yards toward the coulee when  Langdon dropped quickly behind a rock. There was only one way of saving  him now, if he was not too late. The pack had retreated a few yards  down the slope, and he aimed at the pack. One thought only filled his  brain&#8212;he must sacrifice his dogs or let Thor die. And that day Thor  had given him his life!
  There was no hesitation as he pressed the trigger. It was a long  shot, and the first bullet threw up a cloud of dust fifty feet short of  the Airedales. He fired again, and missed. The third time his rifle  cracked there answered it a sharp yelp of pain which Laagdon himself  did not hear. One of the dogs rolled over and over down the slope.
  The reports of the shots alone had not stirred Thor, but now when he  saw one of his enemies crumple up and go rolling down the mountain he  turned slowly toward the safety of the rocks. A fourth and then a fifth  shot followed, and at the fifth the yelping dogs dropped back toward  the coulee, one of them limping with a shattered fore-foot.
  Langdon sprang upon the boulder over which he had rested his gun,  and his eyes caught the sky-line. Iskwao had just reached the top. She  paused for a moment and looked down. Then she disappeared.
  Thor was now hidden among the boulders and broken masses of  sandstone, following her trail. Within two minutes after the grizzly  disappeared Bruce and Metoosin scrambled up over the edge of the  coulee. From where they stood even the sky-line was within fairly good  shooting distance, and Langdon suddenly began shouting excitedly,  waving his arms, and pointing downward.
  Bruce and Metoosin were caught by his ruse, in spite of the fact  that the dogs were again giving fierce tongue close to the rocks among  which Thor had gone. They believed that from where he stood Langdon  could see the progress of the bear, and that it was running toward the  valley. Not until they were another hundred yards down the slope did  they stop and look back at Langdon to get further directions. From his  rock Langdon was pointing to the sky-line.
  Thor was just going over. He paused for a moment, as Iskwao had  stopped, and took one last look at man.
  And Langdon, as he saw the last of him, waved his hat and shouted,  &#8220;Good luck to you, old man&#8212;good luck!&#8221;
