  The next morning Challoner's outfit of three teams and four men   left north and west for the Reindeer Lake country on the journey  to  his new post at the mouth of the Cochrane. An hour later  Challoner  struck due west with a light sledge and a five-dog team  for the  Jackson's Knee. Behind him followed one of MacDonnell's  Indians with  the team that was to bring Nanette to Fort O' God. 
  He saw nothing more of Durant and Grouse Piet, and accepted   MacDonnell's explanation that they had undoubtedly left the Post   shortly after their assault upon him in the cabin. No doubt their   disappearance had been hastened by the fact that a patrol of the   Royal Northwest Mounted Police on its way to York Factory was   expected at Fort O' God that day. 
  Not until the final moment of departure was Miki brought from the   cabin and tied to the gee-bar of Challoner's sledge. When he saw  the  five dogs squatted on their haunches he grew rigid and the old  snarl  rose in his throat. Under Challoner's quieting words he  quickly came  to understand that these beasts were not enemies, and  from a rather  suspicious toleration of them he very soon began to  take a new sort of  interest in them. It was a friendly team, bred  in the south and  without the wolf strain. 
  Events had come to pass so swiftly and so vividly in Miki's life   during the past twenty-four hours that for many miles after they  left  Fort O' God his senses were in an unsettled state of  anticipation. His  brain was filled with a jumble of strange and  thrilling pictures. Very  far away, and almost indistinct, were the  pictures of things that had  happened before he was made a prisoner  by Jacques Le Beau. Even the  memory of Neewa was fading under the  thrill of events at Nanette's  cabin and at Fort O' God. The  pictures that blazed their way across  his brain now were of men,  and dogs, and many other things that he had  never seen before. His  world had suddenly transformed itself into a  host of Henri Durants  and Grouse Piets and Jacques Le Beaus,  two-legged beasts who had  clubbed him, and half killed him, and who  had made him fight to  keep the life in his body. He had tasted their  blood in his  vengeance. And he watched for them now. The pictures told  him they  were everywhere. He could imagine them as countless as the  wolves,  and as he had seen them crowded round the big cage in which he  had  slain the wolf-dog. 
  In all of this excited and distorted world there was only one   Challoner, and one Nanette, and one baby. All else was a chaos of   uncertainty and of dark menace. Twice when the Indian came up  close  behind them Miki whirled about with a savage snarl.  Challoner watched  him, and understood. 
  Of the pictures in his brain one stood out above all others,   definite and unclouded, and that was the picture of Nanette. Yes,   even above Challoner himself. There lived in him the consciousness  of  her gentle hands; her sweet, soft voice; the perfume of her  hair and  clothes and body&#8212;the WOMAN of her; and a part of the  woman&#8212;as the  hand is a part of the body&#8212;was the baby. It was  this part of Miki  that Challoner could not understand, and which  puzzled him when they  made camp that night. He sat for a long time  beside the fire trying to  bring back the old comradeship of the  days of Miki's puppyhood. But he  only partly succeeded. Miki was  restive. Every nerve in his body  seemed on edge. Again and again  he faced the west, and always when he  sniffed the air in that  direction there came a low whine in his  throat. 
  That night, with doubt in his heart, Challoner fastened him near   the tent with a tough rope of babiche. 
  For a long time after Challoner had gone to bed Miki sat on his   haunches close to the spruce to which he was fastened. It must  have  been ten o'clock, and the night was so still that the snap of  a dying  ember in the fire was like the crack of a whip to his  ears. Miki's  eyes were wide open and alert. Near the slowly  burning logs, wrapped  in his thick blankets, he could make out the  motionless form of the  Indian, asleep. Back of him the sledge-dogs  had wallowed their beds in  the snow and were silent. The moon was  almost straight overhead, and a  mile or two away a wolf pointed  his muzzle to the radiant glow of it  and howled. The sound, like a  distant calling voice, added new fire to  the growing thrill in  Miki's blood. He turned in the direction of the  wailing voice. He  wanted to call back. He wanted to throw up his head  and cry out to  the forests, and the moon, and the starlit sky. But  only his jaws  clicked, and he looked at the tent in which Challoner  was  sleeping. He dropped down upon his belly in the snow. But his head   was still alert and listening. The moon had already begun its   westward decline. The fire burned out until the logs were only a  dull  and slumbering glow; the hand of Challoner's watch passed  midnight,  and still Miki was wide-eyed and restless in the thrill  of the thing  that was upon him. And then at last The Call that was  coming to him  from out of the night became his master, and he  gnawed the babiche in  two. It was the call of the Woman&#8212;of  Nanette and the baby. 
  In his freedom Miki sniffed at the edge of Challoner's tent. His   back sagged. His tail drooped. He knew that in this hour he was   betraying the master for whom he had waited so long, and who had   lived so vividly in his dreams. It was not reasoning, but an   instinctive oppression of fact. He would come back. That  conviction  burned dully in his brain. But now&#8212;to-night&#8212;he must  go. He slunk off  into the darkness. With the stealth of a fox he  made his way between  the sleeping dogs. Not until he was a quarter  of a mile from the camp  did he straighten out, and then a gray and  fleeting shadow he sped  westward under the light of the moon. 
  There was no hesitation in the manner of his going. Free of the   pain of his wounds, strong-limbed, deep-lunged as the strongest  wolf  of the forests, he went on tirelessly. Rabbits bobbing out of  his path  did not make him pause; even the strong scent of a  fisher-cat almost  under his nose did not swerve him a foot from  his trail. Through swamp  and deep forest, over lake and stream,  across open barren and charred  burns his unerring sense of  orientation led him on. Once he stopped to  drink where the swift  current of a creek kept the water open. Even  then he gulped in  haste&#8212;and shot on. The moon drifted lower and lower  until it sank  into oblivion. The stars began to fade away The little  ones went  out, and the big ones grew sleepy and dull. A great  snow-ghostly  gloom settled over the forest world. 
  In the six hours between midnight and dawn he covered thirty-five   miles. 
  And then he stopped. Dropping on his belly beside a rock at the   crest of a ridge he watched the birth of day. With drooling jaws  and  panting breath he rested, until at last the dull gold of the  winter  sun began to paint the eastern sky. And then came the first  bars of  vivid sunlight, shooting over the eastern ramparts as guns  flash from  behind their battlements, and Miki rose to his feet and  surveyed the  morning wonder of his world. Behind him was Fort O'  God, fifty miles  away; ahead of him the cabin&#8212;twenty. It was the  cabin he faced as he  went down from the ridge. 
  As the miles between him and the cabin grew fewer and fewer he   felt again something of the oppression that had borne upon him at   Challoner's tent. And yet it was different. He had run his race.  He  had answered The Call. And now, at the end, he was seized by a  fear of  what his welcome would be. For at the cabin he had killed  a man&#8212;and  the man had belonged to the woman. His progress became  more  hesitating. Mid-forenoon found him only half a mile from the  home of  Nanette and the baby. His keen nostrils caught the faint  tang of smoke  in the air. He did not follow it up, but circled  like a wolf, coming  up stealthily and uncertainly until at last he  looked out into the  little clearing where a new world had come  into existence for him. He  saw the sapling cage in which Jacques  Le Beau had kept him a prisoner;  the door of that cage was still  open, as Durant had left it after  stealing him; he saw the  ploughed-up snow where he had leapt upon the  man-brute&#8212;and he  whined. 
  He was facing the cabin door&#8212;and the door was wide open. He could   see no life, but he could SMELL it. And smoke was rising from the   chimney. He slunk across the open. In the manner of his going  there  was an abject humiliation&#8212;a plea for mercy if he had done  wrong, a  prayer to the creatures he worshipped that he might not  be driven  away. 
  He came to the door, and peered in. The room was empty. Nanette   was not there. Then his ears shot forward and his body grew  suddenly  tense, and he listened, listened, LISTENED to a soft,  cooing sound  that was coming from the crib. He swallowed hard; the  faintest whine  rose in his throat and his claws CLICKED, CLICKED,  CLICKED, across the  floor and he thrust his great head over the  side of the little bed.  The baby was there. With his warm tongue  he kissed it&#8212;just once&#8212;and  then, with another deep breath, lay  down on the floor. 
  He heard footsteps. Nanette came in with her arms filled with   blankets; she carried these into the smaller room, and returned,   before she saw him. For a moment she stared. Then, with a strange   little cry, she ran to him; and once more he felt her arms about  him;  and he cried like a puppy with his muzzle against her breast,  and  Nanette laughed and sobbed, and in the crib the baby kicked  and  squealed and thrust her tiny moccasined feet up into the air. 
  &quot;Ao-oo tap-wa-mukun&quot; (&quot;When the devil goes heaven comes in,&quot;) say   the Crees. And with the death of Le Beau, her husband, the devil  had  gone out of life for Nanette. She was more beautiful than  ever. Heaven  was in the dark, pure glow of her eyes. She was no  longer like a dog  under the club and the whip of a brute, and in  the re-birth of her  soul she was glorious. Youth had come back to  her&#8212;freed from the yoke  of oppression. She was happy. Happy with  her baby, with freedom, with  the sun and the stars shining for her  again; and with new hope, the  greatest star of all. Again on the  night of that first day of his  return Miki crept up to her when  she was brushing her glorious hair.  He loved to put his muzzle in  it; he loved the sweet scent of it; he  loved to put his head on  her knees and feel it smothering him. And  Nanette hugged him  tight, even as she hugged the baby, for it was Miki  who had  brought her freedom, and hope, and life. What had passed was  no  longer a tragedy. It was justice. God had sent Miki to do for her   what a father or a brother would have done. 
  And the second night after that, when Challoner came early in the   darkness, it happened that Nanette had her hair down in that same   way; and Challoner, seeing her thus, with the lampglow shining in  her  eyes, felt that the world had taken a sudden swift turn under  his  feet&#8212;that through all his years he had been working forward  to this  hour.
