    Jim Smith stood leaning indolently against a post, when his   emissary, Bates, returned from his errand. He was experiencing &quot;that   stern joy&quot; which bullies feel just before an encounter with a foeman   inferior in strength, whom they expect easily to master. Several of   the boys were near by&#8212;sycophantic followers of Jim, who were   enjoying in advance the rumpus they expected. I am afraid schoolboys   do not always sympathize with the weaker side. In the present   instance, there was hardly a boy who had not at some time or other   felt the weight of Jim's fist, and, as there is an old saying that   &quot;misery loves company,&quot; it was not, perhaps, a matter of wonder that   they looked forward with interest to seeing another suffer the same   ill-treatment which they had on former occasions received! 
  Presently Bates came back. 
  Jim looked over his head for the boy whom he expected to see in his   company. 
  &quot;Where's the new boy?&quot; he demanded, with a frown. 
  &quot;He won't come.&quot; 
  &quot;Won't come?&quot; repeated Jim, with an ominous frown. &quot;Did you tell  him  I wanted him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I did.&quot; 
  &quot;And what did he say?&quot; 
  &quot;That if you wanted to see him, you could come to him.&quot; 
  All the boys regarded each other with looks of surprise. Was it   possible that any boy in Smith Institute could have the boldness to   send such a message to Jim! Most of all, Jim was moved by such a  bold  defiance of his authority. For the moment, he could not think  of any  adequate terms in which to express his feelings. 
  &quot;Did the new boy say that?&quot; he asked, hoarsely. 
  &quot;Yes, he did.&quot; 
  Jim nodded his head vigorously two or three times. 
  &quot;You fellows,&quot; he said, appealing to the boys around him, &quot;did you   ever hear such impudence?&quot; 
  &quot;No!&quot; &quot;Never!&quot; exclaimed the boys in concert, Bates being the   loudest and most emphatic. 
  &quot;I have never been so insulted since I was at the institute,&quot; said   Jim, again looking about him for a confirmation of his statement. 
  &quot;It's because he's a new boy. He don't understand,&quot; suggested one. 
  &quot;That's no excuse,&quot; said Jim, sternly. &quot;He needn't think I'll let   him off on that account.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course not,&quot; answered Bates. 
  &quot;What would you advise me to do, boys?&quot; asked Jim, with the air of  a  monarch asking the opinion of his counselors. 
  &quot;Thrash him till he can't stand!&quot; said the subservient Bates. He  was  always ready to go farther than anyone else in supporting and   defending the authority of the tyrant of the playground. 
  &quot;Bates, you are right. I shall follow your advice,&quot; said Jim.  &quot;Where  is the young reprobate?&quot; 
  &quot;He is over in Carver's field.&quot; 
  &quot;Is anyone with him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Wilkins.&quot; 
  &quot;Ha! Wilkins and I will have an account to settle. If he is going  to  side with this young rascal he must take the consequences. So, he's   over in the field, is he? What's he doing?&quot; 
  &quot;I think he was going to walk down to the brook.&quot; 
  Carver's field was a tract, several acres in extent, of pasture   land, sloping down to one corner, where a brook trickled along   quietly. Here three large trees were located, under whose spreading   branches the boys, in the intervals of study, used often to stretch   themselves for a chat or engage in some schoolboy games, such as   nimble peg or quoits. The owner of the field was an easy-going man,   who did not appear to be troubled by the visits of the boys, as long   as they did not maltreat the peaceful cows who gathered their   subsistence from the scanty grass that grew there. 
  &quot;He wants to keep out of your way, I guess,&quot; volunteered Bates. 
  As this suggestion was flattering to the pride of the &quot;boss,&quot; it  was  graciously received. 
  &quot;Very likely,&quot; he said; &quot;but he'll find that isn't so easy. Boys,   follow me, if you want to see some fun.&quot; 
  Jim started with his loose stride for the field, where he expected   to meet his adversary, or, rather, victim, for so he considered him,   and the smaller boys followed him with alacrity. There was going to   be a scrimmage, and they all wanted to see it. 
  Jim and his followers issued from the gate, and, crossing the   street, scaled the bars that separated Carver's field from the   highway. Already they could see the two boys&#8212;Roscoe and   Wilkins-slowly walking, and nearly arrived at the brook in the lower   part of the field. 
  &quot;He doesn't seem much afraid,&quot; remarked Talbot, one of the recent   comers, incautiously. 
  Upon him immediately Jim frowned ominously. 
  &quot;So you are taking sides with him, Talbot, are you?&quot; he said,   imperiously. 
  &quot;No, Jim,&quot; answered Talbot, hurriedly, for he now saw that he had   been guilty of an imprudence. 
  &quot;What made you say he wasn't scared, then?&quot; 
  &quot;I only said he didn't seem afraid,&quot; answered Talbot,   apologetically. 
  &quot;Be careful what you say in future, young fellow!&quot; said Jim,   sternly; &quot;that is, if you are a friend of mine. If you are going  over  to Roscoe, you can go, and I shall know how to treat you.&quot; 
  &quot;But I am not going over to him. I don't like him,&quot; said the   cowardly boy. 
  &quot;Very well; I accept your apology this time. In future be careful   what you say.&quot; 
  By this time Wilkins and Roscoe had reached the clump of big trees,   and had seated themselves under their ample branches. Then, for the   first time, glancing backward toward the school, they became aware  of  the advancing troop of boys. Wilkins saw them first. 
  &quot;There's Jim coming!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Now you are in a pickle. He   means business.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose,&quot; said Hector, coolly, &quot;he has decided to accept my   invitation, and come to see me.&quot; 
  &quot;You'll find he has,&quot; said Wilkins, significantly. 
  &quot;He seems to have considerable company,&quot; remarked Hector, scanning   the approaching party with tranquillity. 
  &quot;They're coming to see the fun!&quot; said Wilkins. 
  &quot;I suppose you mean the fight between Jim Smith and myself.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, not exactly. They've come to see you thrashed.&quot; 
  Hector smiled. 
  &quot;Suppose they should see Jim thrashed instead&#8212;what then?&quot; 
  &quot;They might be surprised: but I don't think they will be,&quot; answered   Wilkins, dryly. He was, on the whole, well disposed toward Hector,   and he certainly disliked Jim heartily, but he did not allow his   judgment to be swayed by his preferences, and he could foresee but   one issue to the impending conflict. There was one thing that  puzzled  him exceedingly, and that was Hector's coolness on the brink  of a  severe thrashing, such as Jim was sure to give him for his  daring  defiance and disregard of his authority. 
  &quot;You're a queer boy, Hector,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't seem in the least   alarmed.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not in the least alarmed,&quot; answered Hector. &quot;Why should I  be?&quot; 
  &quot;You don't mind being thrashed, then?&quot; 
  &quot;I might mind; but I don't mean to be thrashed if I can help it.&quot; 
  &quot;But you can't help it, you know.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, that will soon be decided.&quot; 
  There was no time for any further conversation, for Jim and his   followers were close at hand. 
  Jim opened the campaign by calling Hector to account. 
  &quot;Look here, you new boy,&quot; he said, &quot;didn't Bates tell you that I   wanted to see you?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Hector, looking up, indifferently. 
  &quot;Well, why didn't you come to me at once, hey?&quot; 
  &quot;Because I didn't choose to. I sent word if you wished to see me,  to  come where I was.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean by such impudence, hey?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean this, Jim Smith, that you have no authority over me and   never will have. I have not been here long, but I have been here  long  enough to find out that you are a cowardly bully and ruffian.  How all  these boys can give in to you, I can't understand.&quot; 
  Jim Smith almost foamed at the mouth with rage. 
  &quot;You'll pay for this,&quot; he howled, pulling off his coat, in furious   haste.
