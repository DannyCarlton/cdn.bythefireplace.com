The term 'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place  it is used with reference to habit or disposition or any other  quality, for we are said to 'have' a piece of knowledge or a  virtue. Then, again, it has reference to quantity, as, for  instance, in the case of a man's height; for he is said to 'have'  a height of three or four cubits. It is used, moreover, with  regard to apparel, a man being said to 'have' a coat or tunic; or  in respect of something which we have on a part of ourselves, as  a ring on the hand: or in respect of something which is a part of  us, as hand or foot. The term refers also to content, as in the  case of a vessel and wheat, or of a jar and wine; a jar is said  to 'have' wine, and a corn-measure wheat. The expression in such  cases has reference to content. Or it refers to that which has  been acquired; we are said to 'have' a house or a field. A man is  also said to 'have' a wife, and a wife a husband, and this  appears to be the most remote meaning of the term, for by the use  of it we mean simply that the husband lives with the wife.    
Other senses of the word might perhaps be found, but the most  ordinary ones have all been enumerated.
