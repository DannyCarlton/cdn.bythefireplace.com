  Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest   sound. Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the   handkerchief. Pierre could not have gone far among the rocks. It  was  possible that he was concealed somewhere near him now. Softly  he  called his name. 
  &quot;Pierre&#8212;ho, Pierre Couchee!&quot; 
  There was no answer, and in the next breath he was sorry that he   had called. He went silently down the trail. He had come to the  edge  of Churchill when once more he heard the howl of the dog far  back in  the forest. He stopped to locate as nearly as he could the  point  whence the sound came, for he was certain now that the dog  had not  returned with Pierre, but had remained with Jeanne, and  was howling  from their camp. 
  Gregson was awake and sitting on the edge of his bunk when Philip   entered the cabin. 
  &quot;Where the deuce have you been?&quot; he demanded. &quot;I was just trying   to make up my mind to go out and hunt for you. Stolen&#8212;lost&#8212;or   something like that?&quot; 
  &quot;I've been thinking,&quot; said Philip, truthfully. 
  &quot;So have I,&quot; said Gregson. &quot;Ever since you came back, wrote that   letter, and went out again&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You were asleep,&quot; corrected Philip. &quot;I looked at you.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I was&#8212;when you looked. But I have a hazy recollection of   you sitting there at the table, writing like a fiend. Anyway, I've   been thinking ever since you went out of the door, and&#8212;I'd like  to  read that Lord Fitzhugh letter again.&quot; 
  Philip handed him the letter. He was quite sure from his friend's   manner of speaking that he had seen nothing of the handkerchief  and  the lace. 
  Gregson seized the paper lazily, yawned, and slipped it under the   blanket which he had doubled up for a pillow. 
  &quot;Do you mind if I keep it for a few days. Phil?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Not in the least, if you'll tell me why you want it,&quot; said   Philip. 
  &quot;I will&#8212;when I discover a reason myself,&quot; replied his friend,   coolly, stretching himself out again in the bunk. &quot;Remember when I   dreamed that Carabobo planter was sticking a knife into you,   Phil?&#8212;and the next day he tried it? Well, I've had a funny dream,  I  want to sleep on this letter. I may want to sleep on it for a  week.  Better turn in if you expect to get a wink between now and  morning.&quot; 
  For half an hour after he had undressed and extinguished the light   Philip lay awake reviewing the incidents of his night's adventure.  He  was certain that his letter was in the hands of Pierre and  Jeanne, but  he was not so sure that they would respond to it. He  half expected  that they would not, and yet he felt a deep sense of  satisfaction in  what he had done. If he met them again he would  not be quite a  stranger. And that he would meet them he was not  only confident, but  determined. If they did not appear in Fort  Churchill he would hunt out  their camp. 
  He found himself asking a dozen questions, none of which he could   answer. Who was this girl who had come like a queen from out of  the  wilderness, and this man who bore with him the manner of a  courtier?  Was it possible, after all, that they were of the  forests? And where  was Fort o' God? He had never heard of it  before, and as he thought of  Jeanne's strange, rich dress, of the  heliotrope-scented handkerchief,  of the old-fashioned rapier at  Pierre's side, and of the exquisite  grace with which the girl had  left him he wondered if such a place as  this Fort o' God must be  could exist in the heart of the desolate  northland. Pierre had  said that they had come from Fort o' God. But  were they a part of  it? 
  He fell asleep, the resolution formed in his mind to investigate   as soon as he found the opportunity. There would surely be those  at  Churchill who would know these people; if not, they would know  of Fort  o' God. 
  Philip found Gregson awake and dressed when he rolled out of his   bunk a few hours later. Gregson had breakfast ready. 
  &quot;You're a good one to have company,&quot; growled the artist. &quot;When you   go out mooning again please take me along, will you? Chuck your  head  in that pail of water and let's eat. I'm starved.&quot; 
  Philip noticed that his companion had tacked the sketch against   one of the logs above the table. 
  &quot;Pretty good for imagination, Greggy,&quot; he said, nodding. &quot;Burke   will jump at that if you do it in colors.&quot; 
  &quot;Burke won't get it,&quot; replied Gregson, soberly, seating himself at   the table. &quot;It won't be for sale.&quot; 
  &quot;Why?&quot; 
  Gregson waited until Philip had seated himself before he answered. 
  &quot;Look here, old man&#8212;get ready to laugh. Split your sides, if you   want to. But it's God's truth that the girl I saw yesterday is the   only girl I've ever seen that I'd be willing to die for!&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure,&quot; agreed Philip. &quot;I understand.&quot; 
  Gregson stared at him in surprise. &quot;Why don't you laugh?&quot; he   asked. 
  &quot;It is not a laughing matter,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I say that I   understand. And I do.&quot; 
  Gregson looked from Philip's face to the picture. 
  &quot;Does it&#8212;does it hit you that way, Phil?&quot; 
  &quot;She is very beautiful.&quot; 
  &quot;She is more than that,&quot; declared Gregson, warmly. &quot;If I ever   looked into an angel's face it was yesterday, Phil. For just a  moment  I met her eyes&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And they were&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Wonderful!&quot; 
  &quot;I mean&#8212;the color,&quot; said Philip, engaging himself with the food. 
  &quot;They were blue or gray. It is the first time I ever looked into a   woman's eyes without being sure of the color of them. It was her   hair, Phil&#8212;not this tinsel sort of gold that makes you wonder if   it's real, but the kind you dream about. You may think me a loon,  but  I'm going to find out who she is and where she is as soon as I  have  done with this breakfast.&quot; 
  &quot;And Lord Fitzhugh?&quot; 
  A shadow passed over Gregson's face. For a few moments he ate in   silence. Then he said: 
  &quot;That's what kept me awake after you had gone&#8212;thinking of Lord   Fitzhugh and this girl. See here, Phil. She isn't one of the kind  up  here. There was breeding and blood in every inch of her, and  what I am  wondering is if these two could be associated in any  way. I don't want  it to be so. But&#8212;it's possible. Beautiful young  women like her don't  come, traveling up to this knob-end of the  earth alone, do they?&quot; 
  Philip did not pursue the subject. A quarter of an hour later the   two young men left the cabin, crossed the ridge, and walked  together  down into Churchill. Gregson went to the Company's store,  while Philip  entered the building occupied by Pearce. Pearce was  at his desk. He  looked up with tired, puffy eyes, and his fat  hands lay limply before  him. Philip knew that he had not been to  bed. His oily face strove to  put on an appearance of animation and  business as Philip entered. 
  Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him. 
  &quot;You look bushed, Pearce,&quot; he began. &quot;Business must be rushing. I   saw a light in your window after midnight, and I came within an  ace  of calling. Thought you wouldn't like to be interrupted, so I  put off  my business until this morning.&quot; 
  &quot;Insomnia,&quot; said Pearce, huskily. &quot;I can't sleep. Suppose you saw   me at work through the window?&quot; There was almost an eager haste in   his question. 
  &quot;Saw nothing but the light,&quot; replied Philip, carelessly. &quot;You know   this country pretty well, don't you, Pearce?&quot; 
  &quot;Been 'squatting' on prospects for eight years, waiting for this   damned railroad,&quot; said Pearce, interlacing his thick fingers. &quot;I   guess I know it!&quot; 
  &quot;Then you can undoubtedly tell me the location of Fort o' God?&quot; 
  &quot;Fort o' What?&quot; 
  &quot;Fort o' God.&quot; 
  Pearce looked blank. 
  &quot;It's a new one on me,&quot; he said, finally. &quot;Never heard of it.&quot; He   rose from his chair and went over to a big map hanging against the   wall. Studiously he went over it with the point of his stubby   forefinger. &quot;This is the latest from the government,&quot; he  continued,  with his back to Philip, &quot;but it ain't here. There's a  God's Lake down  south of Nelson House, but that's the only thing  with a God about it  north of fifty-three.&quot; 
  &quot;It's not so far south as that,&quot; said Philip, rising. 
  Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly. 
  &quot;Never heard of it,&quot; he repeated. &quot;What sort of a place is it, a   post&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I have no idea,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;I came for information more out   of curiosity than anything else. Perhaps I misunderstood the name.   I'm much obliged.&quot; 
  He left Pearce in his chair and went directly to the factor's   quarters. Bludsoe, chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company in the   far north, could give him no more information than had Pearce. He  had  never heard of Fort o' God. He could not remember the name of  Couchee.  During the next two hours Philip talked with French,  Indian, and  half-breed trappers, and questioned the mail runner,  who had come in  that morning from the south. No one could tell him  of Fort o' God. 
  Had Pierre lied to him? His face flushed with anger as this   thought came to him. In the next breath he assured himself that   Pierre was not a man who would lie. He had measured him as a man  who  would fight, and not one who would lie. Besides, he had  voluntarily  given the information that he and Jeanne were from  Fort o' God. There  had been no excuse for falsehood. 
  He purposely directed his movements so that he would not come into   contact with Gregson, little dreaming that his artist friend was   working under the same formula. He lunched with the factor, and a   little later went boldly back to the cliff where he had met Jeanne   and Pierre the preceding night. Although he had now come to expect  no  response to what he had written, he carefully examined the  rocks about  him. Then he set out through the forest in the  direction from which  had come the howling of the wolf-dog. 
  He searched until late in the afternoon, but found no signs of a   recent camp. For several miles he followed the main trail that led   northward from Fort Churchill. He crossed three times through the   country between this trail and the edge of the Bay, searching for   smoke from the top of every ridge that he climbed, listening for  any  sound that might give him a clue. He visited the shack of an  old  half-breed deep in the forest beyond the cliff, but its aged  tenant  could give him no information. He had not seen Pierre and  Jeanne, nor  had he heard the howling of their dog. 
  Tired and disappointed, Philip returned to Churchill. He went   directly to his cabin and found Gregson waiting for him. There was  a  curious look in the artist's face as he gazed questioningly at  his  friend. His immaculate appearance was gone. He looked like one  who had  passed through an uncomfortable hour or two. Perspiration  had dried in  dirty streaks on his face, and his hands were buried  dejectedly in his  trousers pockets. He rose to his feet and stood  before his companion. 
  &quot;Look at me, Phil&#8212;take a good long look,&quot; he urged. 
  Philip stared. 
  &quot;Am I awake?&quot; demanded the artist. &quot;Do I look like a man in his   right senses? Eh, tell me!&quot; 
  He turned and pointed to the sketch hanging against the wall. 
  &quot;Did I see that girl, or didn't I?&quot; he went on, not waiting for   Philip to answer. &quot;Did I dream of seeing her? Eh? By thunder,  Phil&#8212;&quot;  He whirled upon his companion, a glow of excitement taking  the place  of the fatigue in his eyes. &quot;I couldn't find her to-day.  I've hunted  in every shack and brush heap in and around Churchill.  I've hunted  until I'm so tired I can hardly stand up. And the  devil of it is, I  can find no one else who got more than a glimpse  of her, and then they  did not see her as I did. She had nothing on  her head when I saw her,  but I remember now that something like a  heavy veil fell about her  shoulders, and that she was lifting it  when she passed. Anyway, no one  saw her like&#8212;that.&quot; He pointed to  the sketch. &quot;And she's gone&#8212;gone  as completely as though she came  in a flying-machine and went away in  one. She's gone&#8212;unless&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What?&quot; 
  &quot;Unless she is in concealment right here in Churchill. She's gone   &#8212;or hiding.&quot; 
  &quot;You have reason to suspect that she would be hiding,&quot; said   Philip, concealing the effect of the other's words upon him. 
  Gregson was uneasy. He lighted a cigarette, puffed at it once or   twice, and tossed it through the open door. Suddenly he reached in   his coat pocket and pulled out an envelope. 
  &quot;Deuce take it, if I know whether I have or not!&quot; he cried. &quot;But&#8212;   look here, Phil. I saw the mail come in to-day, and I walked up as   bold as you please and asked if there was anything for Lord  Fitzhugh.  I showed the other letter, and said I was Fitzhugh's  agent. It went.  And I got&#8212;this!&quot; 
  Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him. His   fingers trembled as he unfolded the single sheet of paper which he   drew forth. Across it was written a single line: 
  Don't lose an hour. Strike now. 
  There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.   The envelope was addressed in the same hand as the one he had   previously received. The men stared into each other's face. 
  &quot;It's singular, that's all,&quot; pursued Gregson. &quot;Those words are   important. The writer expects that they will reach Lord Fitzhugh   immediately, and as soon as he gets them you can look for war.  Isn't  that their significance? I repeat that it is singular this  girl should  come here so mysteriously, and disappear still more  so, just at this  psychological moment; and it is still more  puzzling when you take into  consideration the fact that two hours  before the runner came in from  the south another person inquired  for Lord Fitzhugh's mail!&quot; 
  Philip started. 
  &quot;And they told you this?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. It was a man who asked&#8212;a stranger. He gave no name and left   no word. Now, if it should happen to be the man who was with the  girl  when I saw her&#8212;and we can find him&#8212;we've as good as got  this Lord  Fitzhugh. If we don't find him&#8212;and mighty soon&#8212;it's up  to us to  start for your camps and put them into fighting shape.  See the point?&quot; 
  &quot;But we've got the letter,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Fitzhugh won't receive   the final word, and that will delay whatever plot he has ready to   spring.&quot; 
  &quot;My dear Phil,&quot; said Gregson, softly. &quot;I always said that you were   the fighter and I the diplomat, yours the brawn and mine the  brain.  Don't you see what this means? I'll gamble my right hand  that these  very words have been sent to Lord Fitzhugh at two or  three different  points, so that they would be sure of reaching  him. I'm just as  positive that he has already received a copy of  the letter which we  have. Mark my words, it's catch Lord Fitzhugh  within the next few  days&#8212;or fight!&quot; 
  Philip sat down, breathing heavily. 
  &quot;I'll send word to MacDougall,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&#8212;I must wait for   the ship!&quot; 
  &quot;Why not leave word for Brokaw and join MacDougall?&quot; 
  &quot;Because when the ship comes in I believe that a large part of   this mystery will be cleared up,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;It is necessary   that I remain here. That will give us a few days in which to make  a  further search for these people.&quot; 
  Gregson did not urge the point, but replaced the second letter in   his pocket with the first. During the evening he remained at the   cabin. Philip returned to Churchill. For an hour he sat among the   ruins of the old fort, striving to bring some sort of order out of   the chaos of events that had occurred during the past few days. He   was almost convinced that he ought to reveal all that he knew to   Gregson, and yet several reasons kept him from doing so. If Miss   Brokaw was on the London ship when it arrived at Churchill, there   would be no necessity of disclosing that part of his own history   which he was keeping secret within himself. If Eileen was not on  the  ship her absence would be sufficient proof to him that she was  in or  near Churchill, and in this event he knew that it would be  impossible  for him to keep from associating with her movements not  only those of  Lord Fitzhugh, but also those of Jeanne and Pierre  and of Brokaw  himself. He could see but two things to do at  present, wait and watch.  If Miss Brokaw was not with her father,  he would take Gregson fully  into his confidence. 
  The next morning he despatched a messenger with a letter for   MacDougall, at Blind Indian Lake, warning him to be on his guard  and  to prepare the long line of sub-stations for possible attack.  All this  day Gregson remained in the cabin. 
  &quot;It won't do for me to make myself too evident,&quot; he explained.   &quot;I've called for Lord Fitzhugh's mail, and I'd better lie as low  as  possible until the corn begins to pop.&quot; 
  Philip again searched the forests to the north and west with the   hope of finding some trace of Pierre and Jeanne. The forest people   were beginning to come into Churchill from all directions to be   present at the big event of the year&#8212;the arrival of the London   ship&#8212;and Philip made inquiries on every trail. No one had seen  those  whom he described. The fourth and fifth days passed without  any  developments. So far as he could discover there was no Fort o'  God, no  Jeanne and Pierre Couchee. He was completely baffled. The  sixth day he  spent in the cabin with Gregson. On the morning of  the seventh there  came from far out over the Bay the hollow  booming of a cannon. 
  It was the signal which for two hundred years the ships from over   the sea had given to the people of Churchill. 
  By the time the two young men had finished their breakfasts and   climbed to the top of the ridge overlooking the Bay, the vessel  had  dropped anchor half a mile off shore, where she rode safe from  the  rocks at low tide. Along the shore below them, where Churchill  lay,  the forest people were gathered in silent, waiting groups.  Philip  pointed to the factor's big York boat, already two-thirds  of the way  to the ship. 
  &quot;We should have gone with Bludsoe,&quot; he said. &quot;Brokaw will think   this a shabby reception on our part, and Miss Brokaw won't be half   flattered. We'll go down and get a good position on the pier.&quot; 
  Fifteen minutes later they were thrusting themselves through the   crowd of men, women, children, and dogs congregated at the foot of   the long stone pier alongside which the ship would lie for two or   three hours at each high tide. Philip stopped among a number of  Crees  and half-breeds, and laid a detaining hand upon Gregson's  arm. 
  &quot;This is near enough, if you don't want to make yourself   conspicuous,&quot; he said. 
  The York boat was returning. Philip pulled a cigar from his pocket   and lighted it. He felt his heart throbbing excitedly as the boat   drew nearer. He looked at Gregson. The artist was taking short,  quick  puffs on his cigarette, and Philip wondered at the evident  eagerness  with which he was watching the approaching craft. 
  Until the boat ran close up under the pier its sail hid the   occupants. While the canvas still fluttered in the light wind  Bludsoe  sprang from the bow out upon the rocks with a rope. Three  or four of  his men followed. With a rattle of blocks and rings the  sheet dropped  like a huge white curtain, and Philip took a step  forward, scarce  restraining the exclamation that forced itself to  his lips at the  picture which it revealed. Standing on the broad  rail, her slender  form poised for the quick upward step, one hand  extended to Bludsoe,  was Eileen Brokaw! In another instant she was  upon the pier, facing  the strange people before her, while her  father clambered out of the  boat behind. There was a smile of  expectancy on her lips as she  scanned the dark, silent faces of  the forest people. Philip knew that  she was looking for him. His  pulse quickened. He turned for a moment  to see the effect of the  girl's appearance upon Gregson. 
  The artist's two hands had gripped his arm. They closed now until   his fingers were like cords of steel. His face was white, his lips   set into thin lines. For a breath he stood thus, while Miss  Brokaw's  scrutiny traveled nearer to them. Then, suddenly, he  released his hold  and darted back among the half-breeds and  Indians, his face turning to  Philip's in one quick, warning  appeal. 
  He was not a moment too soon, for scarce had he gone when Miss   Brokaw caught sight of Philip's tall form at the foot of the pier.   Philip did not see the signal which she gave him. He was staring  at  the line of faces ahead of him. Two people had worked their way   through that line, and suddenly every muscle in his body became  tense  with excitement and joy. They were Pierre and Jeanne! 
  He caught his breath at what happened then. He saw Jeanne falter   for a moment. He noticed that she was now dressed like the others   about her, and that Pierre, who stood at her shoulder, was no  longer  the fine gentleman of the rock. The half-breed bent over  her, as if  whispering to her, and then Jeanne ran out from those  about her to  Eileen, her beautiful face flushed with joy and  welcome as she reached  out her arms to the other woman. Philip saw  a sudden startled look  leap into Miss Brokaw's face, but it was  gone as quickly as it  appeared. She stared at the forest girl,  drew herself haughtily erect,  and, with a word which he could not  hear, turned to Bludsoe and her  father. For an instant Jeanne  stood as if some one had struck her a  blow. Then, slowly, she  turned. The flush was gone from her face. Her  beautiful mouth was  quivering, and Philip fancied that he could hear  the low sobbing  of her breath. With a cry in which he uttered no name,  but which  was meant for her, he sprang forward into the clear space of  the  pier. She saw him, and darted back among her people. He would have   followed, but Miss Brokaw was coming to him now, her hand held out  to  him, and a step behind were Brokaw and the factor. 
  &quot;Philip!&quot; she cried. 
  He spoke no word as he crushed her hand. The hot grip of his   fingers, the deep flush in his face, was interpreted by her as a   welcome which it did not require speech to strengthen. He shook  hands  with Brokaw, and as the three followed after the factor his  eyes  sought vainly for Pierre and Jeanne. 
  They were gone, and he felt suddenly a thrill of repugnance at the   gentle pressure of Eileen Brokaw's hand upon his arm.
