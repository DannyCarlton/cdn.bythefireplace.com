  It was in the third week after his hurt that Peter saw Nada. By   that time he could easily follow Jolly Roger as far as the   fording-place, and there he would wait, sometimes hours at a  stretch,  while his comrade and master went over to Cragg's Ridge.  But  frequently Jolly Roger would not cross, but remained with  Peter, and  would lie on his back at the edge of a grassy knoll  they had found,  reading one of the little old-fashioned red books  which Peter knew  were very precious to him. Often he wondered what  was between the  faded red covers that was so interesting, and if  he could have read he  would have seen such titles as &quot;Margaret of  Anjou,&quot; &quot;History of  Napoleon,&quot; &quot;History of Peter the Great,&quot;  &quot;Caesar,&quot; &quot;Columbus the  Discoverer,&quot; and so on through the twenty  volumes which Jolly Roger  had taken from a wilderness mail two  years before, and which he now  prized next to his life. 
  This afternoon, as they lay in the sleepy quiet of June, Jolly   Roger answered the questioning inquisitiveness in Peter's face and   eyes. 
  &quot;You see, Pied-Bot, it was this way,&quot; he said, beginning a little   apologetically. &quot;I was dying for something to read, and I figgered   there'd be something on the Mail&#8212;newspapers, you know. So I  stopped  it, and tied up the driver, and found these. And I swear I  didn't take  anything else&#8212;that time. There's twenty of them, and  they weigh nine  pounds, and in the last two years I've toted them  five thousand miles.  I wouldn't trade them for my weight in gold,  and I'm pretty heavy. I  named you after one of them&#8212;Peter. I  pretty near called you  Christopher Columbus. And some day we've  got to take these books to  the man they were going to, Peter. I've  promised myself that. It seems  sort of like stealing the soul out  of someone. I just borrowed them,  that's all. And I've kept the  address of the owner, away up on the  edge of the Barrens. Some day  we're going to make a special trip to  take the books home.&quot; 
  Peter, all at once, had become interested in something else, and   following the direction of his pointed nose Jolly Roger saw Nada   standing quietly on the opposite side of the stream, looking at  them.  In a moment Peter knew her, and he was trembling in every  muscle when  Jolly Roger caught him up under his arm, and with a  happy laugh  plunged through the creek with him. For a good five  minutes after that  Jolly Roger stood aside watching Peter and  Nada, and there was a  glisten of dampness in his eyes when he saw  the wet on Nada's cheeks,  and the whimpering joy of Peter as he  caressed her face and hands.  Three weeks had been a long time to  Peter, but he could see no  difference in the little mistress he  worshipped. There were still the  radiant curls to hide his nose  in, the gentle hands, the sweet voice,  the warm thrill of her body  as she hugged him in her arms. He did not  know that she had new  shoes and a new dress, and that some of the  color had gone from  her red lips, and that her cheeks were paler, and  that she could  no longer hide the old haunted look in her eyes. 
  But Jolly Roger saw the look, and the growing pallor, and had   noted them for two weeks past. And later that afternoon, when Nada   returned to Cragg's Ridge, and he re-crossed the stream with  Peter,  there was a hard and terrible look in his eyes which Peter  had caught  there more and more frequently of late. And that  evening, in the  twilight of their cabin, Jolly Roger said, 
  &quot;It's coming soon, Peter. I'm expecting it. Something is happening   which she won't tell us about. She is afraid for me. I know it.  But  I'm going to find out&#8212;soon. And then, Pied-Bot, I think we'll   probably kill Jed Hawkins, and hit for the North.&quot; 
  The gloom of foreboding that was in Jolly Roger's voice and words   seemed to settle over the cabin for many days after that, and more   than ever Peter sensed the thrill and warning of that mysterious   something which was impending. He was developing swiftly, in flesh   and bone and instinct, and there began to possess him now the   beginning of that subtle caution and shrewdness which were to mean  so  much to him later on. An instinct greater than reason, if it  was not  reason itself, told him that his master was constantly  watching for  something which did not come. And that same instinct,  or reason,  impinged upon him the fact that it was a thing to be  guarded against.  He did not go blindly into the mystery of things  now. He circumvented  them, and came up from behind. Craft and  cunning replaced mere  curiosity and puppyish egoism. He was quick  to learn, and Jolly  Roger's word became his law, so that only once  or twice was he told a  thing, and it became a part of his  understanding. While the keen,  shrewd brain of his Airedale father  developed inside Peter's head, the  flesh and blood development of  his big, gentle, soft-footed Mackenzie  hound mother kept pace in  his body. His legs and feet began to lose  their grotesqueness.  Flesh began to cover the knots in his tail. His  head, bristling  fiercely with wiry whiskers, seemed to pause for a  space to give  his lanky body a chance to catch up with it. And in  spite of his  big feet, so clumsy that a few weeks ago they had  stumbled over  everything in his way, he could now travel without  making a sound. 
  So it came to pass, after a time, that when Peter heard footsteps   approaching the cabin he made no effort to reveal himself until he   knew it was Jolly Roger who was coming. And this was strangely in   spite of the fact that in the five weeks since Nada had brought  him  from Cragg's Ridge no one but Jolly Roger and Nada had set  foot within  sight of the shack. It was an inborn caution, growing  stronger in him  each day. There came one early evening when Peter  made a discovery. He  had returned with Jolly Roger from a fishing  trip farther down the  creek, and scarcely had he set nose to the  little clearing about the  cabin when he caught the presence of a  strange scent. He investigated  it swiftly, and found it all about  the cabin, and very strong close up  against the cabin door. There  were no doubts in Peter's mind. A man  had been there, and this man  had gone around and around the cabin, and  had opened the door, and  had even gone inside, for Peter found the  scent of him on the  floor. He tried, in a way, to tell Jolly Roger. He  bristled, and  whined, and looked searchingly into the darkening edge  of the  forest. Jolly Roger quested with him for a few moments, and  when  he failed to find marks in the ground he began cleaning a fish  for  supper, and said. 
  &quot;Probably a wolverine, Pied-Bot. The rascal came to see what he   could find while we were away.&quot; 
  But Peter was not satisfied. He was restless all that night.   Sounds which had been familiar now held a new significance for  him.  The next day he was filled with a quiet but brooding  expectancy. He  resented the intrustion of the strange footprints.  It was, in his  process of instinctive reasoning, an encroachment  upon the property  rights of his master, and he was&#8212;true to the  law of his species&#8212;the  guardian of those rights. 
  The fourth evening after the stranger's visit to the cabin Jolly   Roger was later than usual in returning from Cragg's Ridge. Peter  had  been on a hunting adventure of his own, and came to the cabin  at  sunset. But he never came out of cover now without standing  quietly  for a few moments, getting the wind, and listening. And  tonight,  poking his head between some balsams twenty yards from  the shack, he  was treated to a sudden thrill. The cabin door was  open. And standing  close to this door, looking quietly and  cautiously about, stood a  stranger. He was not like Jed Hawkins,  was Peter's first impression.  He was tall, with a wide-brimmed  hat, and wore boots with striped  trousers tucked into them, and on  his coat were bits of metal which  caught the last gleams of the  sun. Peter knew nothing of the Royal  Northwest Mounted Police. But  he sensed danger, and he remained very  quiet, without moving a  muscle of his head or body, while the stranger  looked about, with  a hand on his unbuttoned pistol holster. Not until  he entered the  cabin, and closed the door after him, did Peter move  back into the  deeper gloom of the forest. And then, silent as a fox,  he skulked  through cover to the foot-trail, and down the trail to the  ford,  across which Jolly Roger would come from Cragg's Ridge. 
  There was still half an hour of daylight when Jolly Roger arrived.   Peter did not, as usual, run to the edge of the bank to meet him.  He  remained sitting stolidly on his haunches, with his ears  flattened,  and in his whole attitude no sign of gladness at his  master's coming.  With every instinct of caution developed to the  highest degree within  him, Jolly Roger was lightning quick to  observe the significance of  small things. He spoke to Peter,  caressed him with his hand, and moved  on along the foot-trail  toward the cabin. Peter fell in behind him  moodily, and after a  few moments stopped, and squatted on his haunches  again. Jolly  Roger was puzzled. 
  &quot;What is it, Peter?&quot; he asked. &quot;Are you afraid of that wolverine&#8212;   &quot; 
  Peter whined softly; but even as he whined, his ears were flat,   and his eyes filled with a red light as they glared down the trail   beyond the outlaw. Jolly Roger turned and went on, until he   disappeared around a twist in the path. There he stopped, and  peered  back. Peter was not following him, but still sat where he  had left  him. A quicker breath came to Jolly Roger's lips, and he  went back to  Peter. For fully a minute he stood beside him,  watching and listening,  and not once did the reddish glare in  Peter's eyes leave the direction  of the cabin. Jolly Roger's eyes  had grown very bright, and suddenly  he dropped on his knees beside  Peter, and spoke softly, close up to  his flattened ear. 
  &quot;You say it isn't a wolverine, Peter? Is that what you're trying   to tell me?&quot; 
  Peter's teeth clicked, and he whimpered, never taking his eyes   from ahead. 
  There was a cold light in Jolly Roger's eyes as he rose to his   feet, and he turned swiftly and quietly into the edge of the  forest,  and in the gloom that was gathering there his hand carried  the big  automatic. Peter followed him now, and Jolly Roger swung  in a wide  circle, so that they came up on that forest side of the  cabin where  there was no window. And here Jolly Roger knelt down  beside Peter  again, and whispered to him. 
  &quot;You stay here, Pied-Bot. Understand? You stay here.&quot; 
  He pressed him down gently with his hand, so that Peter   understood. Then, slinking low, and swift as a cat, Jolly Roger  ran  to the end of the cabin where there was no window. With his  head close  to the ground he peered out cautiously at the door. It  was closed.  Then he looked at the windows. To the west the  curtains were up, as he  had left them. And to the east&#8212; 
  A whimsical smile played at the corners of his mouth. Those   curtains he had kept tightly drawn. One of them was down now. But  the  other was raised two inches, so that one hidden within the  cabin could  watch the approach from the trail! 
  He drew back, and under his breath he chuckled. He recognized the   sheer nerve of the thing, the clever handiwork of it. Someone was   inside the cabin, and he was ready to stake his life it was  Cassidy,  the Irish bloodhound of &quot;M&quot; Division. If anyone ferreted  him out way  down here on the edge of civilization he had gambled  with himself that  it would be Cassidy. And Cassidy had come&#8212;  Cassidy, who had hung like  a wolf to his trails for three years,  who had chased him across the  Barren Lands, who had followed him  up the Mackenzie, and back  again&#8212;who had fought with him, and  starved with him, and froze with  him, yet had never brought him to  prison. Deep down in his heart Jolly  Roger loved Cassidy. They had  played, and were still playing, a  thrilling game, and to win that  game had become the life's ambition of  each. And now Cassidy was  in there, confident that at last he had his  man, and waiting for  him to step into the trap. 
  To Jolly Roger, in the face of its possible tragedy, there was a   deep-seated humor in the situation. Three times in the last year  and  a half had he turned the tables on Cassidy, leaving him  floundering in  the cleverly woven webs which the man-hunter had  placed for his  victim. This was the fourth time. And Cassidy would  be tremendously  upset! 
  Praying that Peter would remain quiet, Jolly Roger took off his   shoes. After that he made no more sound than a ferret as he crept  to  the door. An inch at a time he raised himself, until he was  standing  up, with his ear half an inch from the crack that ran  lengthwise of  the frame. Holding his breath, he listened. For an  interminable time,  it seemed to him, there was no sound from  within. He guessed what  Cassidy was doing&#8212;peering through that  slit of window under the  curtain. But he was not absolutely sure.  And he knew the necessity of  making no error, with Cassidy in  there, gripping the butt of his gun. 
  Suddenly he heard a movement. A man's steps, subdued and yet   distinct, were moving from the window toward the door. Half way  they  paused, and turned to one of the windows looking westward.  But it was  evident the watcher was not expecting his game from  that direction,  for after a moment's silence he returned to the  window through which  he could see the trail. This time Jolly Roger  was sure. Cassidy was  again peering through the window, with his  back toward him, and every  muscle in the forest rover's body  gathered for instant action. In  another moment he had flung open  the door, and the watcher at the  window whirled about to find  himself looking straight into the muzzle  of Jolly Roger's gun. 
  For several minutes after that last swift movement of Jolly   Roger's, Peter lay where his master had left him, his eyes fairly   popping from his head in his eagerness to see what was happening.  He  heard voices, and then the wild thrill of Jolly Roger's  laughter, and  restraining himself no longer he trotted cautiously  to the open door  of the cabin. In a chair sat the stranger with  the broad-brimmed hat  and high boots, with his hands securely tied  behind him. And Jolly  Roger was hustling about, filling a  shoulder-pack in the last light of  the day. 
  &quot;Cassidy, I oughta kill you,&quot; Jolly Roger was saying as he worked,   an exultant chuckle in his voice. &quot;You don't give me any peace. No   matter where I go you're sure to come, and I can't remember that I   ever invited you. I oughta put you out of the way, and plant  flowers  over you, now that I've got the chance. But I'm too  chicken-hearted.  Besides, I like you. By the time you get tired of  chasing me you  should be a pretty good man-hunter. But just now  you lack finesse,  Cassidy&#8212;you lack finesse. &quot;And Jolly Roger's  chuckle broke into  another laugh. 
  Cassidy heaved out a grunt. 
  &quot;It's luck&#8212;just damned luck!&quot; he growled. 
  &quot;If it is, I hope it keeps up,&quot; said Jolly Roger. &quot;Now, look here,   Cassidy! Let's make a man's bet of it. If you don't get me next   time&#8212;if you fail, and I turn the trick on you once more&#8212;will you   quit?&quot; 
  Cassidy's eyes gleamed in the thickening dusk. 
  &quot;If I don't get you next time&#8212;I'll hand in my resignation!&quot; 
  The laughter went out of Jolly Roger's voice. 
  &quot;I believe you, Cassidy. You've played square&#8212;always. And now&#8212;if   I free your hands&#8212;will you swear to give me a two hours' start   before you leave this cabin?&quot; 
  &quot;I'll give you the start,&quot; said Cassidy. 
  His lean face was growing indistinct in the gloom. 
  Jolly Roger came up behind him. There was the slash of a knife.   Then he picked up his shoulder-pack. At the door he paused. 
  &quot;Look at your watch when I'm gone, Cassidy, and be sure you make   it a full two hours.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll make it two hours and five minutes,&quot; said Cassidy. &quot;Hittin'   north are you, Jolly Roger?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm hittin'&#8212;bushward,&quot; replied the outlaw. &quot;I'm going where it's   plenty thick and hard to travel, Cassidy. Goodby&#8212;&quot; 
  He was gone. He hit straight north, making noise as he went, but   once in the timber he swung southward, and plunged through the  creek  with Peter under his arm. Not until they had traveled a good  half mile  over the plain did Jolly Roger speak. Then he said,  speaking directly  at Peter, 
  &quot;Cassidy thinks I'll sure hit for the North country again, Pied-   Bot. But we're foolin' him. I've sort of planned on something like   this happening, and right now we're hittin' for the tail-end of   Cragg's Ridge where there's a mess of rock that the devil himself  can  hardly get into. We've got to do it, boy. We can't leave the   girl&#8212;just now. We can't leave&#8212;her&#8212;&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's voice choked. Then he paused for a moment, and bent   over to put his hand on Peter. 
  &quot;If it hadn't been for you, Peter&#8212;Cassidy would have got me&#8212;   sure. And I'm wondering, Peter&#8212;I'm wondering&#8212;why did God forget  to  give a dog speech?&quot; 
  Peter whined in answer, and through the darkness of the night they   went on together.
