Robert appreciated fully all the dangers they were sure to encounter  upon their perilous expedition to the lakes. Having the gift of  imagination, he saw them in their most alarming colors, but having a  brave heart also, he was more than willing, he was eager to encounter  them with his chosen comrades by his side. The necessity of striking  some quick and sharp blow became more apparent every hour, or the lakes,  so vital in the fortunes of the war, would soon pass into the complete  possession of the French and Indians.    
The band was chosen and equipped with the utmost care. It included, of  course, all of Rogers' rangers, Robert, Tayoga, Willet and Black Rifle,  making a total of fifty white men, all of tried courage and inured to  the forest. Besides there were fifty Mohawks under Daganoweda, the very  pick of the tribe, stalwart warriors, as tough as hickory, experienced  in every art of wilderness trail and war, and eager to be at the foe.  Every white man was armed with a rifle, a pistol, a hatchet and a knife,  carrying also a pouch containing many bullets, a large horn of powder, a  blanket folded tightly and a knapsack full of food. The Mohawks were  armed to the teeth in a somewhat similar fashion, and, it being  midsummer and the weather warm, they were bare to the waist. Rogers, the  ranger, was in nominal command of the whole hundred, white and red, but  Willet and Daganoweda in reality were on an equality, and since the  three knew one another well and esteemed one another highly they were  sure to act in perfect coordination. Black Rifle, it was understood,  would go and come as he pleased. He was under the orders of no man.    
"I give you no instructions," said Colonel William Johnson to the three  leaders, "because I know of none to be given under such circumstances.  No man can tell what awaits you in the forest and by the lakes. I merely  ask you in God's name to be careful! Do not walk into any trap! And yet  'tis foolish of me to warn Robert Rogers, David Willet, Black Rifle and  Daganoweda, four foresters who probably haven't their equal in all North  America. But we can ill afford to lose you. If you do not see your way  to strike a good blow perhaps it would be better to come back and march  with the army."    
"You don't mean that, William, old friend," said Willet, smiling and  addressing him familiarly by his first name. "In your heart you would be  ashamed of us if we returned without achieving at least one good deed  for our people. And turning from William, my old friend, to Colonel  William Johnson, our commander, I think I can promise that a high deed  will be achieved. Where could you find a hundred finer men than these,  fifty white and fifty red?"    
Daganoweda, who understood him perfectly, smiled proudly and glanced at  the ranks of Mohawks who stood impassive, save for their eager, burning  eyes.    
"But be sure to bring back the good lads, Robert and Tayoga," said  Mynheer Jacobus Huysman, who stood with Colonel William Johnson. "I  would keep them from going, if I could, but I know I cannot and perhaps  I am proud of them, because I know they will not listen to me."    
King Hendrik of the Mohawks, in his gorgeous colored clothes, was also  present, his bronzed and aged face lighted up with the warlike gleam  from his eyes. Evidently his mind was running back over the countless  forays and expeditions he had led in the course of fifty years. He  longed once more for the forests, the beautiful lakes and the great war  trail. His seventy years had not quenched his fiery spirit, but they had  taken much of his strength, and so he would abide with the army, going  with it on its slow march.    
"My son," he said, with the gravity and dignity of an old Indian sachem,  to Daganoweda, "upon this perilous chance you carry the honor and  fortune of the Ganeagaono, the great warlike nation of the Hodenosaunee.  It is not necessary for me to bid you do your duty and show to the Great  Bear, the Mountain Wolf, Black Rifle and the other white men that a  young Mohawk chief will go where any other will go, and if need be will  die with all his men before yielding a foot of ground. I do not bid you  do these things because I know that you will do them without any words  from me, else you would not be a Mohawk chief, else you would not be  Daganoweda, son of fire and battle."    
Daganoweda smiled proudly. The wise old sachem had struck upon the most  responsive chords in his nature.    
"I will try to bear myself as a Mohawk should," he said simply.    
Colden and Grosvenor were also there.    
"I'm sorry our troop can't go with you," said the young Philadelphian,  "but I'm not one to question the wisdom and decision of our  commander-in-chief. Doubtless we'd be a drag upon such a band as yours,  but I wish we could have gone. At least, we'll be with the army which is  going to march soon, and perhaps we'll overtake you at Lake George  before many days."    
"And I," said Grosvenor to Robert and Tayoga, "am serving on the staff  of the commander. I'm perhaps the only Englishman here and I'm an  observer more than anything else. So I could be spared most readily, but  the colonel will not let me go. He says there is no reason why we should  offer a scalp without price to Tandakora, the Ojibway."    
"And I abide by what I said," laughed Colonel Johnson, who heard.  "You're in conditions new to you, Grosvenor, though you've had one  tragic and dreadful proof of what the Indians can do, but there's great  stuff in you and I'm not willing to see it thrown away before it's  developed. Don't be afraid the French and Indians won't give you all the  fighting you want, though I haven't the slightest doubt you'll stand up  to it like a man."    
"Thank you, sir," said Grosvenor, modestly.    
The lad, Peter, was also eager to go, and he was soothed only by the  promise of Mynheer Jacobus Huysman that he might join the army on the  march to Lake George.    
Then the leaders gave the word and the hundred foresters, fifty white  and fifty red, plunged into the great northern wilderness which  stretched through New York into Canada, one of the most beautiful  regions on earth, and at that particular time the most dangerous,  swarming with ruthless Indians and daring French partisans.    
It was remarkable how soon they reached the wilds after leaving Albany.  The Dutch had been along the Hudson for more than a century, and the  English had come too, but all of them had clung mostly to the river.  Powerful and warlike tribes roamed the great northern forests, and the  French colonies in the north and the English colonies in the south had a  healthy respect for the fighting powers of one another. The doubtful  ground between was wide and difficult, and anyone who ventured into it  now had peril always beside him.    
The forest received the hundred, the white and the red, and hid them at  once in its depths. It was mid-summer, but there was yet no brown on the  leaves. A vast green canopy overhung the whole earth, and in every  valley flowed brooks and rivers of clean water coming down from the firm  hills. The few traces made by the white man had disappeared since the  war. The ax was gone, and the scalp-hunters had taken its place.    
Robert, vivid of mind, quickly responsive to the externals of nature,  felt all the charm and majesty that the wilderness in its mightiest  manifestations had for him. He did not think of danger yet, because he  was surrounded by men of so much bravery and skill. He did not believe  that in all the world there was such another hundred, and he was full of  pride to be the comrade of such champions.    
Daganoweda and the Mohawks reverted at once to the primitive, from which  they had never departed much. The young Mohawk chieftain was in advance  with Willet. He had a blanket but it was folded and carried in a small  pack on his back. He was bare to the waist and his mighty chest was  painted in warlike fashion. All his warriors were in similar attire or  lack of it.    
Daganoweda was happy. Robert saw his black eyes sparkling, and he  continually raised his nose to scent the wind like some hunting animal.  Robert knew that in his fierce heart he was eager for the sight of a  hostile band. The enemy could not come too soon for Daganoweda and the  Mohawks. Tayoga's face showed the same stern resolve, but the Onondaga,  more spiritual than the Mohawk, lacked the fierceness of Daganoweda.    
When they were well into the wilderness they stopped and held a  consultation, in which Rogers, Willet, Black Rifle, Daganoweda, Robert  and Tayoga shared. They were to decide a question of vital  importance--their line of march. They believed that Dieskau and the main  French army had not yet reached Crown Point, the great French fortress  on Lake Champlain, but there was terrible evidence that the swarms of  his savage allies were not only along Champlain but all around Lake  George, and even farther south. Unquestionably the French partisan  leaders were with them, and where and when would it be best for the  American-Iroquois force to strike?    
"I think," said Willet, "that St. Luc himself will be here. The Marquis  de Vaudreuil, the new Governor General of Canada, knows his merit and  will be sure to send him ahead of Dieskau."    
Robert felt the thrill that always stirred him at the mention of St.  Luc's name. Would they meet once more in the forest? He knew that if the  Chevalier came all their own skill and courage would be needed to meet  him on equal terms. However kindly St. Luc might feel toward him he  would be none the less resolute and far-seeing in battle against the  English and Americans.    
"I think we should push for the western shore of Andiatarocte," said  Willet. "What is your opinion, Daganoweda?"    
"The Great Bear is right. He is nearly always right," replied the  Mohawk. "If we go along the eastern shore and bear in toward Champlain  we might be trapped by the French and their warriors. West of  Andiatarocte the danger to us would not be so great, while we would have  an equal chance to strike."    
"Well spoken, Daganoweda," said Rogers. "I agree with you that for the  present it would be wise for us to keep away from Oneadatote (the Indian  name for Lake Champlain) and keep to Andiatarocte. The Indians are armed  at Crown Point on Oneadatote, which was once our own Fort Saint  Frederick, founded by us, but plenty of them spread to the westward and  we'll be sure to have an encounter."    
The others were of a like opinion, and the line of march was quickly  arranged. Then they settled themselves for the night, knowing there was  no haste, as the French and Indians would come to meet them, but knowing  also there was always great need of caution, since if their foes were  sure to come it was well to know just when they would come. The Mohawks  asked for the watch, meaning to keep it with three relays of a dozen  warriors each, a request that Rogers and Willet granted readily, and all  the white forest runners prepared for sleep, save the strange and  terrible man whom they commonly called Black Rifle.    
Black Rifle, whose story was known in some form along the whole border,  was a figure with a sort of ominous fascination for Robert, who could  not keep from watching him whenever he was within eye-shot. He had  noticed that the man was restless and troubled at Albany. The presence  of so many people and the absence of the wilderness appeared to vex him.  But since they had returned to the forest his annoyance and uneasiness  were gone. He was confident and assured, he seemed to have grown greatly  in size, and he was a formidable and menacing figure.    
Black Rifle did not watch with the Mohawk sentinels, but he was  continually making little trips into the forest, absences of ten or  fifteen minutes, and whenever he returned his face bore a slight look of  disappointment. Robert knew it was because he had found no Indian sign,  but to the lad himself the proof that the enemy was not yet near gave  peace. He was eager to go on the great war trail, but he was not fond of  bloodshed, though to him more perhaps than to any other was given the  vision of a vast war, and of mighty changes with results yet more  mighty flowing from those changes. His heart leaped at the belief that  he should have a part in them, no matter how small the part.    
He lay on the grass with his blanket beneath him, his head on a pillow  of dead leaves. Not far away was Tayoga, already asleep. They had built  no fires, and as the night was dark the bronze figures of the Indian  sentinels soon grew dim. Rogers and Willet also slept, but Robert still  lay there awake, seeing many pictures through his wide-open eyes,  Quebec, the lost Stadacona of the Mohawks, the St. Lawrence, Tandakora,  the huge Ojibway who had hunted him so fiercely, St. Luc, De Courcelles,  and all the others who had passed out of his life for a while, though he  felt now, with the prescience of old King Hendrik, that they were coming  back again. His path would lie for a long time away from cities and the  gay and varied life that appealed to him so much, and would lead once  more through the wilderness, which also appealed to him, but in another  way. Hence when he slept his wonderfully vivid imagination did not  permit him to sleep as soundly as the others.    
He awoke about midnight and sat up on his blanket, looking around at the  sleeping forms, dim in the darkness. He distinguished Tayoga near him,  just beyond him the mighty figure of Willet, then that of Rogers,  scarcely less robust, and farther on some of the white men. He did not  see Black Rifle, but he felt sure that he was in the forest, looking for  the signs of Indians and hoping to find them. Daganoweda also was  invisible and it was likely that the fiery young Mohawk chief was  outside the camp on an errand similar to that of Black Rifle. He was  able to trace on the outskirts the figures of the sentinels, shadowy and  almost unreal in the darkness, but he knew that the warriors of the  Ganeagaono watched with eyes that saw everything even in the dusk, and  listened with ears that heard everything, whether night or day.    
He fell again into a doze or a sort of half sleep in which Tarenyawagon,  the sender of dreams, made him see more pictures and see them much  faster than he ever saw them awake. The time of dreams did not last more  than half an hour, but in that period he lived again many years of his  life. He passed once more through many scenes of his early boyhood when  Willet was teaching him the ways of the forest. He met Tayoga anew for  the first time, together they went to the house of Mynheer Jacobus  Huysman in Albany, and together they went to the school of Alexander  McLean; then he jumped over a long period and with Willet and Tayoga had  his first meeting with St. Luc and Tandakora. He was talking to the  Frenchman when he came out of that period of years which was yet less  than an hour, and sat up.    
All the others save the sentinels were asleep, but his delicate senses  warned him that something was moving in the forest. It was at first an  instinct rather than anything seen or heard, but soon he traced against  the misty background of the dusk the shadowy figures of moving Mohawks.  He saw the tall form of Daganoweda, who had come back from the forest,  and who must have come because he had something to tell. Then he made  out behind the Mohawk chief, Black Rifle, and, although he could not  see his features, the white man nevertheless looked swart and menacing,  an effect of the day carried over into the night.    
It was Robert's first impulse to lie down again and pretend not to know,  but he remembered that he was in the full confidence of them all, a  trusted lieutenant, welcomed at any time, anywhere, and so remembering,  he arose and walked on light foot to the place where Daganoweda stood  talking with the others. The Mohawk chief gave him one favoring glance,  telling him he was glad that he had come. Then he returned his attention  to a young Indian warrior who stood alert, eager and listening.    
"Haace (Panther), where did you find the sign that someone had passed?"  he asked.    
"Two miles to the north <i>Gao</i> (the wind) brought me a sound," replied  Haace. "It was light. It might have been made by the boughs of <i>Oondote</i>  (a tree) rubbing together, but the ears of Haace told him it was not so.  I crept through <i>Gabada</i> (the forest) to the place, whence the sound had  come, and lo! it and whatever had made it were gone, but I found among  the bushes traces to show that moccasins had passed."    
Fire leaped up in the black eyes of Daganoweda.    
"Did you follow?" he asked.    
"For a mile, and I found other traces of moccasins passing. The traces  met and fused into one trail. All the owners of the moccasins knelt and  drank at a <i>Dushote</i> (a spring), and as they were very thirsty they must  have come far."    
"How do you know, Haace?"    
"Because the imprints of their knees were sunk deep in the earth,  showing that they drank long and with eagerness. <i>Oneganosa</i> (the water)  was sweet to their lips, and they would not have drunk so long had they  not been walking many miles. I would have followed further, but I felt  that I should come back and tell to my chief, Daganoweda, what I had  seen."    
"You have done well, Haace. Some day the Panther will turn into a  chief."    
The black eyes of the young warrior flashed with pleasure, but he said  nothing, silence becoming him when he was receiving precious words of  praise from his leader.    
"I saw sign of the savages too," said Black Rifle. "I came upon the  coals of a dead fire about two days' old. By the side of it I found  these two red beads that had dropped from the leggings or moccasins of  some warrior. I've seen beads of this kind before, and they all come  from the French in Canada."    
"Then," said Robert, speaking for the first time, "you've no doubt the  enemy is near?"    
"None in the world," replied Black Rifle, "but I think they're going  west, away from us. It's not likely they know yet we're here, but so  large a band as ours can't escape their notice long."    
"If they did not find that we are here," said Daganoweda proudly, "we  would soon tell it to them ourselves, and in such manner that they would  remember it."    
"That we would," said Black Rifle, with equal emphasis. "Now, what do  you think, Daganoweda? Should we wake the Great Bear and the Mountain  Wolf?"    
"No, Black Rifle. Let them sleep on. They will need tomorrow the sleep  they get tonight. Man lives by day in the sleep that he has at night,  and we wish the eyes of them all to be clear and the arms of them all to  be strong, when the hour of battle, which is not far away, comes to us."    
"You're right, Daganoweda, right in both things you say, right that they  need all their strength, and right that we'll soon meet St. Luc, at the  head of the French and Indians, because I'm as sure as I know that I'm  standing here that he's now leading 'em. Shall we finish out the night  here, and then follow on their trail until we can bring 'em to battle on  terms that suit us?"    
"Yes, Black Rifle. That is what the Great Bear and the Mountain Wolf  would say too, and so I shall not awake them. Instead, I too will go to  sleep."    
Daganoweda, as much a Viking as any that ever lived in Scandinavia, lay  down among his men and went quickly to the home over which Tarenyawagon  presided. Haace, filled with exultation that he had received the high  approval of his chief, slid away among the trees on another scout, and,  in like manner, the forest swallowed up Black Rifle. Once more the camp  was absolutely silent, only the thin and shadowy figures of the bronze  sentinels showing through the misty gloom. Robert lay down again and  Tarenyawagon, the sender of dreams, held him in his spell. His excited  brain, even in sleep, was a great sensitive plate, upon which pictures,  vivid and highly colored, were passing in a gorgeous procession.    
Now, Tarenyawagon carried him forward and not back. They met St. Luc in  battle, and it was dark and bloody. How it ended he did not know,  because a veil was dropped over it suddenly, and then he was in the  forest with Tayoga, fleeing for his life once more from Tandakora, De  Courcelles and their savage band. Nor was it given to him to know how  the pursuit ended, because the veil fell again suddenly, and when it was  lifted he was in a confused and terrible battle not far from a lake,  where French soldiers, American soldiers and English soldiers were  mingled in horrible conflict. For some strange reason, one that he  wondered at then, he stood among the French, but while he wondered, and  while the combat increased in ferocity the veil slipped down and it was  all gone like a mist. Then came other pictures, vivid in color, but  vague in detail, that might or might not be scenes in his future life,  and he awoke at last to find the dawn had come.    
Tayoga was already awake and handed him a piece of venison.    
"Eat, Dagaeoga," he said, "and drink at the little spring in the wood on  our right. I have learned what Haace and Black Rifle saw in the night,  and we march in half an hour."    
Robert did more than drink at the spring; he also bathed his face, neck  and hands at the little brook that ran away from it, and although  Tarenyawagon had been busy shifting his kaleidoscope before him while he  slept, he was as much refreshed as if he had slumbered without dreams.  The dawn, clear but hot in the great forest, brought with it zeal and  confidence. They would follow on the trail of the French and Indian  leaders, and he believed, as surely as a battle came, that Willet,  Rogers, Daganoweda and their men would be the victors.    
As soon as the brief and cold breakfast was finished the hundred  departed silently. The white rangers wore forest dress dyed green that  blended with the foliage, and the Mohawks still wore scarcely anything  at all. It was marvelous the way in which they traveled, and it would  not have been possible to say that white man or red man was the better.  Robert heard now and then only the light brush of a moccasin. A hundred  men flitted through the greenwood and they passed like phantoms.    
In a brief hour they struck the trail that Haace had found, and followed  it swiftly, but with alert eyes for ambush. Presently other little  trails flowed into it, some from the east, and some from the west, and  the tributaries included imprints, which obviously were those of white  men. Then the whole broad trail, apparently a force of about one  hundred, curved back toward the west.    
"They go to Andiatarocte," said Daganoweda. "Perhaps they meet another  force there."    
"It's probably so," said Willet. "Knowing that our army is about to  advance they wouldn't come to the southwest shore of the lake unless  they were in strength. I still feel that St. Luc is leading them, but  other Frenchmen are surely with him. It behooves us to use all the  caution of which white men and red together are capable. In truth, there  must be no ambush for us. Besides the loss which we should suffer it  would be a terrible decrease of prestige for it to be known that the  Mountain Wolf and Daganoweda, the most warlike of all the chiefs of the  Ganeagaono, were trapped by the French and their savage allies."    
Willet spoke artfully and the response was instantaneous. The great  chest of Daganoweda swelled, and a spark leaped from his eyes.    
"It will never be told of us," he said, "because it cannot happen. There  are not enough of the French and their savage allies in the world to  trap the Great Bear, the Mountain Wolf, Daganoweda, and the lads Tayoga  and Dagaeoga."    
Willet smiled. It was the reply that he had expected. Moreover, both his  words and those of the chief were heard by many warriors, and he knew  that they would respond in every fiber to the battle cry of their  leader. His contemptuous allusion to the allies of the French as  "savages" met a ready response in their hearts, since the nations of the  Hodenosaunee considered themselves civilized and enlightened, which, in  truth, they were in many respects.    
Robert always remembered the place at which they held their brief  council. They stood in a little grove of oaks and elms, clear of  underbrush. The trees were heavy with foliage, and the leaves were yet  green. The dawn had not yet fully come, and the heavens, save low down  in the east, were still silver, casting a silvery veil which gave an  extraordinary and delicate tint to the green of foliage. In the distance  on the right was the gleam of water, silver like the skies, but it was  one of the beautiful lakelets abundant in that region and not yet  Andiatarocte, which was still far away. The bronze figures of the  Indians, silent and impassive as they listened to their chief, fitted  wonderfully into the wilderness scene, and the white men in forest  green, their faces tanned and fierce, were scarcely less wild in look  and figure. Robert felt once more a great thrill of pride that he had  been chosen a member of such a company.    
They talked less than five minutes. Then Black Rifle, alone as usual  because he preferred invariably to be alone, disappeared in the woods to  the right of the great trail. Three young warriors, uncommonly swift of  foot, soon followed him, and three more as nimble of heel as the others,  sank from sight in the forest to the left. Both right and left soon  swallowed up several of the rangers also, who were not inferior as  scouts and trailers to the Mohawks.    
"The wings of our force are protected amply now," said Tayoga, in his  precise school English. "When such eyes as those of our flankers are  looking and watching, no ambush against us is possible. Now our main  force will advance with certainty."    
Twenty men had been sent out as scouts and the remaining eighty, eager  for combat, white and red, advanced on the main trail, not fast but  steadily. Now and then the cries of bird or beast, signals from the  flankers, came from right or left, and the warriors with Daganoweda  responded.    
"They are telling us," said Tayoga to Robert, "that they have not yet  found a hostile presence. The enemy has left behind him no skirmishers  or rear guard. It may be that we shall not overtake them until we  approach the lake or reach it."    
"How do you know that we will overtake them at all, Tayoga? They may go  so fast that we can't come up."    
"I know it, Dagaeoga, because if they are led by St. Luc, and I think  they are, they will not try to get away. If they believe we are not  about to overtake them they will wait for us at some place they consider  good."    
"You're probably right, Tayoga, and it's likely that we'll be in battle  before night. One would think there is enough country here on this  continent for the whole world without having the nations making war over  any part of it. As I have said before, here we are fighting to secure  for an English king or a French king mountains and lakes and rivers and  forests which neither of them will ever see, and of the existence of  which, perhaps, they don't know."    
"And as I have told you before, Dagaeoga, the mountains and lakes and  rivers and forests for which the English and French kings have their  people fight, belong to neither, but to the great League of the  Hodenosaunee and other red nations."    
"That's true, Tayoga. Sometimes I'm apt to forget it, but you know I'm a  friend of the Hodenosaunee. If I had the power I'd see that never an  acre of their country was filched from them by the white men."    
"I know it well, Dagaeoga."    
The pursuit continued all the morning, and the great trail left by the  French and Indians broadened steadily. Other trails flowed into and  merged with it, and it became apparent that the force pursued was larger  than the force pursuing. Yet Willet, Rogers and Daganoweda did not  flinch, clinging to the trail, which now led straight toward  Andiatarocte.
