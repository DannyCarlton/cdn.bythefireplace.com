  It was Peter who roused Jolly Roger many hours later; Peter nosing   about the still burning embers of the fire, and at last muzzling  his  master's face with increasing anxiety. McKay sat up out of his  nest of  balsam boughs and blankets and caught the bright glint of  sunlight  through the treetops. He rubbed his eyes and stared again  to make  sure. Then he looked at his watch. It was ten o'clock and  peering in  the direction of the open he saw the white edge of it  glistening in  the unclouded blaze of a sun. It was the first sun&#8212;  the first real  sun&#8212;he had seen for many days, and with Peter he  went to the rim of  the barren a hundred yards distant. He wanted  to shout. As far as he  could see the white plain was ablaze with  eye-blinding light, and  never had the sky at Cragg's Ridge been  clearer than the sky that was  over him now. 
  He returned to the fire, singing. Back through the months leapt   Peter's memory to the time when his master had sung like that. It  was  in Indian Tom's cabin, with Cragg's Ridge just beyond the  creek, and  it was in those days before Terence Cassidy had come to  drive them to  another hiding place; in the happy days of Nada's  visits and of their  trysts under the Ridge, when even the little  gray mother mouse lived  in a paradise with her nest of babies in  the box on their cabin shelf.  He had almost forgotten but it came  back to him now. It was the old  Jolly Roger&#8212;the old master come  to life again. 
  In the clear stillness of the morning one might have heard that   shouting song half a mile away. But McKay was no longer afraid. As   the storm seemed to have cleaned the world so the sun cleared his   soul of its last shadow of doubt. It was not merely an omen or a   promise, but for him proclaimed a certainty. God was with him.  Life  was with him. His world was opening its arms to him again&#8212;  and he  sang as if Nada was only a mile away from him instead of a  thousand. 
  When he went on, after their breakfast, he laughed at the thought   of Breault discovering their trail. The Ferret would be more than   human to do that after what wind and storm and fire had done for   them. 
  This first day of their pilgrimage into the southland was a day of   glory from its beginning until the setting of the sun. There was  no  cloud in the sky. And it grew warmer, until Jolly Roger flung  back the  hood of his parkee and turned up the fur of his cap. That  night a  million stars lighted the heaven. 
  After this first day and night nothing could break down the hope   and confidence of Jolly Roger and his, dog. Peter knew they were   going south, in which direction lay everything he had ever yearned   for; and each night beside their campfire McKay made a note with   pencil and paper and measured the distance they had come and the   distance they had yet to go. Hope in a little while became  certainty.  Into his mind urged no thought of changes that might  have taken place  at Cragg's Ridge; or, if the thought did come, it  caused him no  uneasiness. Now that Jed Hawkins was dead Nada would  be with the  little old Missioner in whose care he had left her,  and not for an  instant did a doubt cloud the growing happiness of  his anticipations.  Breault and the hunters of the law were the one  worry that lay ahead  and behind him. If he outwitted them he would  find Nada waiting for  him. 
  Day after day they kept south and west until they struck the   Thelon; and then through a country unmapped, and at times terrific  in  its cold and storm, they fought steadily to the frozen regions  of the  Dubawnt waterways. Only once in the first three weeks did  they seek  human company. This was at a small Indian camp where  Jolly Roger  bartered for caribou meat and moccasins for Peter's  feet. Twice  between there and God's Lake they stopped at trappers'  cabins. 
  It was early in March when they struck the Lost Lake country,   three hundred miles from Cragg's Ridge. 
  And here it was, buried under a blind of soft snow, that Peter   nosed out the frozen carcass of a disemboweled buck which Boileau,   the French trapper, had poisoned for wolves. Jolly Roger had built  a  fire and was warming half a pint of deer tallow for a baking of   bannock, when Peter dragged himself in, his rear legs already   stiffening with the palsy of strychnine. In a dozen seconds McKay  had  the warm tallow down Peter's throat, to the last drop of it;  and this  he followed with another dose as quickly as he could heat  it, and in  the end Peter gave up what he had eaten. 
  Half an hour later Boileau, who was eating his dinner, jumped up   in wonderment when the door of his cabin was suddenly opened by a   grim and white-faced man who carried the limp body of a dog in his   arms. 
  For a long time after this the shadow of death hung over the   Frenchman's trapping-shack. To Boileau, with his brotherly  sympathy  and regret that his poison-bait had brought calamity,  Peter was &quot;just  dog.&quot; But when at last he saw the strong shoulders  of the grim-faced  stranger shaking over Peter's paralyzed body and  listened to the  sobbing grief that broke in passionate protest  from his white lips, he  drew back a little awed. It seemed for a  time that Peter was dead; and  in those moments Jolly Roger put his  arms about him and buried his  despairing face in Peter's scraggly  neck, calling in a wild fit of  anguish for him to come back, to  live, to open his eyes again.  Boileau, crossing himself, felt of  Peter's body and McKay heard his  voice over him, saying that the  dog was not dead, but that his heart  was beating steadily and that  he thought the last stiffening blow of  the poison was over. To  McKay it was like bringing the dead back to  life. He raised his  head and drew away his arms and knelt beside the  bunk stunned and  mutely hopeful while Boileau took his place and began  dropping  warm condensed milk down Peter's throat. In a little while  Peter's  eyes opened and he gave a great sigh. 
  Boileau looked up and shrugged his shoulders. 
  &quot;That was a good breath, m'sieu,&quot; he said. &quot;What is left of the   poison has done its worst. He will live.&quot; 
  A bit stupidly McKay rose to his feet. He swayed a little, and for   the first time sensed the hot tears that had blinded his eyes and  wet  his cheeks. And then there came a sobbing laugh out of his  throat and  he went to the window of the Frenchman's shack and  stared out into the  white world, seeing nothing. He had stood in  the presence of death  many times before but never had that  presence choked up his heart as  in this hour when the soul of  Peter, his comrade, had stood  falteringly for a space half-way  between the living and the dead. 
  When he turned from the window Boileau was covering Peter's body   with blankets and a warm bear skin. And for many days thereafter   Peter was nursed through the slow sickness which followed. 
  An early spring came this year in the northland. South of the   Reindeer waterway country the snows were disappearing late in  March  and ice was rotting the first week in April. Winds came from  the south  and west and the sun was warmer and clearer than Boileau  had ever  known it at the winter's end in Lost Lake country. It was  in this  first week of April that Peter was able to travel, and  McKay pointed  his trail once more for Cragg's Ridge 
  He left a part of his winter dunnage at Boileau's shack and went   on light, figuring to reach Cragg's Ridge before the new &quot;goose  moon&quot;  had worn itself out in the west. But for a week Peter lagged  and until  the darker red in the rims of his eyes cleared away  Jolly Roger  checked the impetus of his travel so that the goose  moon had faded out  and the &quot;frog moon&quot; of May was in its full  before they came down the  last slope that dipped from the Height  of Land to the forests and  lakes of the lower country. 
  And now, in these days, it seemed to Jolly Roger that a great   kindness, and not tragedy, had delayed him so that his &quot;home  coming&quot;  was in the gladness of spring. All about him was the  sweetness and  mystic whispering of new life just awakening. It was  in the sky and  the sun; it was underfoot, in the fragrance of the  mold he trod upon,  in the trees about him, and in the mate-  chirping of the birds  flocking back from the southland. His  friends the jays were raucous  and jaunty again, bullying and  bluffing in the warmth of sunshine; the  black glint of crows'  wings flashed across the opens; the wood-sappers  and pewees and  big-eyed moose-birds were aflutter with the excitement  of home  planning; partridges were feasting on the swelling poplar  buds&#8212;  and then, one glorious sunset, he heard the chirruping evening   song of his first robin. 
  And the next day they would reach Cragg's Ridge! 
  Half of that last night he sat up, awake, or smoked in the glow of   his fire, waiting for the dawn. With the first lifting of darkness  he  was traveling swiftly ahead of Peter and the morning was only  half  gone when he saw far ahead of him the great ridge which shut  out  Indian Tom's swamp, and Nada's plain, and Cragg's Ridge beyond  it. 
  It was noon when he stood at the crest of this. He was breathing   hard, for to reach this last precious height from which he might  look  upon the country of Nada's home he had half run up its rock-  strewn  side. There, with his lungs gasping for air, his eager eyes  shot over  the country below him and for a moment the significance  of the thing  which he saw did not strike him. And then in another  instant it seemed  that his heart choked up, like a fist suddenly  tightened, and stopped  its beating. 
  Reaching away from him, miles upon miles of it, east, west and   south&#8212;was a dead and char-stricken world. 
  Up to the foot of the ridge itself had come the devastation of   flame, and where it had swept, months ago, there was now no sign  of  the glorious spring that lay behind him. 
  He looked for Indian Tom's swamp, and where it had been there was   no longer a swamp but a stricken chaos of ten thousand black  stubs,  the shriven corpses of the spruce and cedar and jackpines  out of which  the wolves had howled at night. 
  He looked for the timber on Sucker Creek where the little old   Missioner's cabin lay, and where he had dreamed that Nada would be   waiting for him. And he saw no timber there but only the  littleness  and emptiness of a blackened world. 
  And then he looked to Cragg's Ridge, and along the bald crest of   it, naked as death, he saw blackened stubs pointing skyward,  painting  desolation against the blue of the heaven beyond. 
  A cry came from him, a cry of fear and of horror, for he was   looking upon the fulfilment of Yellow Bird's prediction. He seemed  to  hear, whispering softly in his ears, the low, sweet voice of  the  sorceress, as on the night when she had told him that if he  returned  to Cragg's Ridge he would find a world that had turned  black with ruin  and that it would not be there he would ever find  Nada. 
  After that one sobbing cry he tore like a madman dawn into the   valley, traveling swiftly through the muck of fire and under-foot   tangle with Peter fighting behind him. Half an hour later he stood   where the Missioner's cabin had been and he found only a ruin of  ash  and logs burned down to the earth. Where the trail had run  there was  no longer a trail. A blight, grim and sickening, lay  upon the earth  that had been paradise. 
  Peter heard the choking sound in his master's throat and chest.   He, too, sensed the black shadow of tragedy and cautiously he  sniffed  the air, knowing that at last they were home&#8212;and yet it  was not home.  Instinctively he had faced Cragg's Ridge and Jolly  Roger, seeing the  dog's stiffened body pointing toward the break  beyond which lay Nada's  old home, felt a thrill of hope leap up  within him. Possibly the  farther plain had escaped the scourge of  fire. If so, Nada would be  there, and the Missioner&#8212; 
  He started for the break, a mile away. As he came nearer to it his   hope grew less for he could see where the flames had swept in an   inundating sea along Cragg's Ridge. They passed over the meadow  where  the thick young jackpines, the red strawberries and the blue  violets  had been and Peter heard the strange sob when they came to  the little  hollow&#8212;the old trysting place where Nada had first  given herself into  his master's arms. And there it was that Peter  forgot master and  caution and sped swiftly ahead to the break that  cut the Ridge in  twain. 
  When Jolly Roger came to that break and ran through it he was   staggering from the mad effort he had made. And then, all at once,   the last of his wind came in a cry of gladness. He swayed against  a  rock and stood there staring wild-eyed at what was before him.  The  world was as black ahead of him as it was behind. But Jed  Hawkins'  cabin was untouched! The fire had crept up to its very  door and there  it had died. 
  He went on the remaining hundred yards and before the closed door   of Nada's old home he found Peter standing stiff-legged and  strange.  He opened the door and a damp chill touched his face. The  cabin was  empty. And the gloom and desolation of a grave filled  the place. 
  He stepped in, a moaning whisper of the truth coming to his lips.   He heard the scurrying flight of a starved wood-rat, a flutter of   loose papers, and then the silence of death fell about him. The  door  of Nada's little room was open and he entered through it. The  bed was  naked and there remained only the skeleton of things that  had been. 
  He moved now like a man numbed by a strange sickness and Peter   followed gloomily and silently in the footsteps of his master.  They  went outside and a distance away Jolly Roger saw a thing  rising up out  of the char of fire, ugly and foreboding, like the  evil spirit of  desolation itself. It was a rude cross made of  saplings, up which the  flames had licked their way, searing it  grim and black. 
  His hands clenched slowly for he knew that under the cross lay the   body of Jed Hawkins, the fiend who had destroyed his world. 
  After that he re-entered the cabin and went into Nada's room,   closing the door behind him; and for many minutes thereafter Peter   remained outside guarding the outer door, and hearing no sound or   movement from within. 
  When Jolly Roger came out his face was set and white, and he   looked where the thick forest had stood on that stormy night when  he  ran down the trail toward Mooney's cabin. There was no forest  now. But  he found the old tie-cutters' road, cluttered as it was  with the  debris of fire, and he knew when he came to that twist in  the trail  where long ago Jed Hawkins had lain dead on his back.  Half a mile  beyond he came to the railroad. Here it was that the  fire had burned  hottest, for as far as his vision went he could  see no sign of life or  of forest green alight in the waning sun. 
  And now there fell upon him, along with the desolation of despair,   a something grimmer and more terrible&#8212;a thing that was fear.  About  him everywhere reached this graveyard of death, leaving no  spot  untouched. Was it possible that Nada and the Missioner had  not escaped  its fury? The fear settled upon him more heavily as  the sun went down  and the gloom of evening came, bringing with it  an unpleasant chill  and a cloying odor of things burned dead. 
  He did not talk to Peter now. There was a lamp in the cabin and   wood behind the stove, and silently he built a fire and trimmed  and  lighted the wick when darkness came. And Peter, as if hiding  from the  ghosts of yesterday, slunk into a corner and lay there  unmoving and  still. And McKay did not get supper nor did he smoke,  but after a long  time he carried his blankets into Nada's room,  and spread them out  upon her bed. Then he put out the light and  quietly laid himself down  where through the nights of many a month  and year Nada had slept in  the moon glow. 
  The moon was there tonight. The faint glow of it rose in the east   and swiftly it climbed over the ragged shoulder of Cragg's Ridge,   flooding the blackened world with light and filling the room with  a  soft and golden radiance. It was a moon undimmed, full and round  and  yellow; and it seemed to smile in through the window as if  some living  spirit in it had not yet missed Nada, and was  embracing her in its  glory. And now it came upon Jolly Roger why  she had loved it even more  than she had loved the sun; for through  the little window it shut out  all the rest of the world, and  sitting up, he seemed to hear her heart  beating at his side and  clearly he saw her face in the light of it and  her slim arms out-  reaching, as if to gather it to her breast.  Thus&#8212;many times, she  had told him&#8212;had she sat up in her bed to greet  the moon and to  look for the smiling face that was almost always  there, the face  of the Man in the Moon, her friend and playmate in the  sky. 
  For a space his heart leapt up; and then, as if discovery of the   usurper in her room had come, a cloud swept over the face of the  moon  like a mighty hand and darkness crowded him in. But the cloud  sailed  on and the light drove out the gloom again. Then it was  that Jolly  Roger saw the Old Man in the Moon was up and awake  tonight, for never  had he seen his face more clearly. Often had  Nada pointed it out to  him in her adorable faith that the Old Man  loved her, telling him how  this feature changed and that feature  changed, how sometimes the Old  Man looked sick and at others well,  and how there were times when he  smiled and was happy and other  times when he was sad and stern and sat  there in his castle in the  sky sunk in a mysterious grief which she  could not understand. 
  &quot;And always I can tell whether I'm going to be glad or sorry by   the look of the Man in the Moon,&quot; she had said to him. &quot;He looks  down  and tells me even when the clouds are thick and he can only  peep  through now and then. And he knows a lot about you, Mister&#8212;  Jolly  Roger&#8212;because I've told him everything.&quot; 
  Very quietly Jolly Roger got up from the bed and very strange   seemed his manner to Peter as he walked through the outer room and   into the night beyond. There he stood making no sound or movement,   like one of the lifeless stubs left by fire; and Peter looked up,  as  his master was looking, trying to make out what it was he saw  in the  sky. And nothing was there&#8212;nothing that he had not seen  many times  before; a billion stars, and the moon riding King among  them all, and  fleecy clouds as if made of web, and stillness, a  great stillness that  was like sleep in the lap of the world. 
  For a little Jolly Roger was silent and then Peter heard him   saying, 
  &quot;Yellow Bird was right&#8212;again. She said we'd find a black world   down here and we've found it. And we're going to find Nada where  she  told us we'd find her, in that place she called The Country   Beyond&#8212;the country beyond the forests, beyond the tall trees and  the  big swamps, beyond everything we've ever known of the wild and  open  spaces; the country where God lives in churches on Sunday and  where  people would laugh at some of our queer notions, Pied-Bot.  It's there  we'll find Nada, driven out by the fire, and waiting  for us now in the  settlements.&quot; 
  He spoke with a strange and quiet conviction, the haggard look   dying out of his face as he stared up into the splendor of the  sky. 
  And then he said. 
  &quot;We won't sleep tonight, Peter. We'll travel with the moon.&quot; 
  Half an hour later, as the lonely figures of man and dog headed   for the first settlement a dozen miles away, there seemed to come  for  an instant the flash of a satisfied smile in the face of the  Man in  the sky.
