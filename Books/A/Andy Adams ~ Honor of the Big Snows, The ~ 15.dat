  Peace followed in the blighted trails of the Red Terror. Again the   forest world breathed without fear; but from Hudson's Bay to   Athabasca, and as far south as the thousand waters of the Reindeer   country, the winds whispered of a terrible grief that would remain   until babes were men and men went to their graves. 
  Life had been torn and broken in a cataclysm more fearful than that   which levels cities and disrupts the earth. Slowly it began its   readjustment. There was no other life to give aid or sympathy; and   just as they had suffered alone, so now the forest people struggled   back into life alone, building up from the wreck of what had been, the   things that were to be. 
  For months the Crees wailed their death dirges as they sought out  the  bones of their dead. Men dragged themselves into the posts,  wifeless  and childless, leaving deep in the wilderness all that they  had known  to love and give them comfort. Now and then came a woman,  and around  the black scars of burned cabins and teepees dogs howled  mournfully  for masters that were gone. 
  The plague had taken a thousand souls, and yet the laughing,  dancing  millions in that other big world beyond the edge of the  wilderness  caught only a passing rumor of what had happened. 
  Lac Bain suffered least of the far northern posts, with the  exception  of Churchill, where the icy winds down-pouring from the  Arctic had  sent the Red Terror shivering to the westward. In the late  snows, word  came that Cummins was to take Williams' place as factor,  and Per-ee at  once set off for the Fond du Lac to bring back Jean de  Gravois as  &quot;chief man.&quot; Croisset gave up his fox-hunting to fill  Mukee's place. 
  The changes brought new happiness to M&eacute;lisse. Croisset's wife was a   good woman who had spent her girlhood in Montreal, and Iowaka, now the   mother of a fire-eating little Jean and a handsome daughter, was a   soft-voiced young Venus who had grown sweeter and prettier with her   years&#8212;which is not usually the case with half-breed women. 
  &quot;But it's good blood in her, beautiful blood,&quot; vaunted Jean  proudly,  whenever the opportunity came. &quot;Her mother was a princess,  and her  father a pure Frenchman, whose father's father was a chef de   bataillon. What better than that, eh? I say, what better could there   be than that?&quot; 
  So, for the first time in her life, M&eacute;lisse discovered the joys of   companionship with those of her own kind. 
  This new companionship, pleasant as it was, did not come between  her  and Jan. If anything, they were more to each other than ever. The   terrible months through which they had passed had changed them both,   and had given them, according to their years, the fruits which are   often ripened in the black gloom of disaster rather than in the   sunshine of prosperity. 
  To M&eacute;lisse they had opened up a new world of thought, a new vision  of  the things that existed about her. The sternest teacher of all had   brought to her the knowledge that comes of grief, of terror, and of   death, and she had passed beyond her years, just as the cumulative   processes of generations made the Indian children pass beyond theirs. 
  She no longer looked upon Jan as a mere playmate, a being whose   diversion was to amuse and to love her. He had become a man. In her   eyes he was a hero, who had gone forth to fight the death of which she   still heard word and whisper all about her. Croisset's wife and Iowaka   told her that he had done the bravest thing that a man might do on   earth. She spoke proudly of him to the Indian children, who called him   the &quot;torch-bearer.&quot; She noticed that he was as tall as Croisset, and   taller by half a head than Jean, and that he lifted her now with one   arm as easily as if she were no heavier than a stick of wood. 
  Together they resumed their studies, devoting hours to them each  day,  and through all that summer he taught her to play upon his  violin. The  warm months were a time of idleness at Lac Bain, and Jan  made the most  of them in his teaching of M&eacute;lisse. She learned to read  the books  which he had used at Fort Churchill, and by midsummer she  could read  those which he had used at York Factory. At night they  wrote letters  to each other and delivered them across the table in the  cabin, while  Cummins looked on and smoked, laughing happily at what  they read aloud  to him. 
  One night, late enough in the season for a fire to be crackling   merrily in the stove, Jan was reading one of these letters, when   M&eacute;lisse cried: 
  &quot;Stop, Jan&#8212;stop THERE!&quot; 
  Jan caught himself, and he blushed mightily when he read the next   lines: 
  &quot;'I think you have beautiful eyes. I love them.'&quot; 
  &quot;What is it?&quot; cried Cummins interestedly. &quot;Read on, Jan.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't!&quot; commanded M&eacute;lisse, springing to her feet and running  around  the table. &quot;I didn't mean you to read that!&quot; 
  She snatched the paper from Jan's hand and threw it into the fire. 
  Jan's blood filled with pleasure, and at the bottom of his next  letter  he wrote back: 
  &quot;I think you have beautiful hair. I love it.&quot; 
  That winter Jan was appointed post hunter, and this gave him much  time  at home, for meat was plentiful along the edge of the barrens.  The two  continued at their books until they came to the end of what  Jan knew  in them. After that, like searchers in strange places, they  felt their  way onward, slowly and with caution. During the next summer  they  labored through all the books which were in the little box in the   corner of the cabin. 
  It was M&eacute;lisse who now played most on the violin, and Jan listened,   his eyes glowing proudly as he saw how cleverly her little fingers   danced over the strings, his face flushed with a joy that was growing   stronger in him every day. One day she looked curiously into the F-   hole of the instrument, and her pretty mouth puckered itself into a   round, red &quot;O&quot; of astonishment when Jan quickly snatched the violin   from her hands. 
  &quot;Excuses-moi, ma belle M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he laughed at her in French. &quot;I am   going to play you something new!&quot; 
  That same day he took the little cloth-covered roll from the violin   and gave it another hiding-place. It recalled to him the strange   spirit which had once moved him at Fort Churchill, and which had   remained with him for a time at Lac Bain. That spirit was now gone,   luring him no longer. Time had drawn a softening veil over things that   had passed. He was happy. 
  The wilderness became more beautiful to him as M&eacute;lisse grew older.   Each summer increased his happiness; each succeeding winter made it   larger and more complete. Every fiber of his being sang in joyful   response as he watched M&eacute;lisse pass from childhood into young   girlhood. He marked every turn in her development, the slightest   change in her transformation, as if she had been a beautiful flower. 
  He possessed none of the quick impetuosity of Jean de Gravois.  Years  gave the silence of the North to his tongue, and his exultation  was  quiet and deep in his own heart. With an eagerness which no one   guessed he watched the growing beauty of her hair, marked its   brightening luster when he saw it falling in thick waves over her   shoulders, and he knew that at last it had come to be like the   woman's. The changing lights in her eyes fascinated him, and he   rejoiced again when he saw that they were deepening into the violet   blue of the bakneesh flowers that bloomed on the tops of the ridges. 
  To him, M&eacute;lisse was growing into everything that was beautiful. She   was his world, his life, and at Post Lac Bain there was nothing to   come between the two. Jan noticed that in her thirteenth year she   could barely stand under his outstretched arm. The next year she had   grown so tall that she could not stand there at all. Very soon she   would be a woman! 
  The thought leaped from his heart, and he spoke it aloud. It was on   the girl's fifteenth birthday. They had come up to the top of the   ridge on which he had fought the missionary, to gather red sprigs of   the bakneesh for the festival that they were to have in the cabin that   night. High up on the face of a jagged rock, Jan saw a bit of the   crimson vine thrusting itself out into the sun, and, with M&eacute;lisse   laughing and encouraging him from below, he climbed up until he had   secured it. He tossed it down to her. 
  &quot;It's the last one,&quot; she cried, seeing his disadvantage, &quot;and I'm   going home. You can't catch me!&quot; 
  She darted away swiftly along the snow-covered ridge, taunting him   with merry laughter as she left him clambering in cautious descent   down the rock. Jan followed in pursuit, shouting to her in French, in   Cree, and in English, and their two voices echoed happily in their   wild frolic. 
  Jan slackened his steps. It was a joy to see M&eacute;lisse springing from   rock to rock and darting across the thin openings close ahead of him,   her hair loosening and sweeping out in the sun, her slender figure   fleeing with the lightness of the pale sun-shadows that ran up and   down the mountain. 
  He would not have overtaken her of his own choosing, but at the  foot  of the ridge M&eacute;lisse gave up. She returned toward him, panting  and  laughing, shimmering like a sea-naiad under the glistening veil of  her  disheveled hair. Her face glowed with excitement; her eyes, filled   with the light of the sun, dazzled Jan in their laughing defiance.   Before her he stopped, and made no effort to catch her. Never had he   seen her so beautiful, still daring him with her laugh, quivering and   panting, flinging back her hair. Half reaching out his arms, he cried: 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse, you are beautiful&#8212;you are almost a woman!&quot; 
  The flush deepened in her cheeks, and there was no longer the  sweet,  taunting mischief in her eyes. She made no effort to run from  him when  he came to her. 
  &quot;Do you think so, Brother Jan?&quot; 
  &quot;If you did your hair up like the pictures we have in the books,  you  would be a woman,&quot; he answered softly. &quot;You are more beautiful  than  the pictures!&quot; 
  He drew a step back, and her eyes flashed at him again with the   sparkle of the old fun in them. 
  &quot;You say that I am pretty, and that I am almost a woman,&quot; she  pouted.  &quot;And yet&#8212;&quot; She shrugged her shoulders at him in mock disdain.  &quot;Jan  Thoreau, this is the third time in the last week that you have  not  played the game right! I won't play with you any more!&quot; 
  In a flash he was at her side, her face between his two hands and,   bending down, he kissed her upon the mouth. 
  &quot;There,&quot; she said, as he released her. &quot;Isn't that the way we have   played it ever since I can remember? Whenever you catch me, you may   have that!&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he said seriously. &quot;You are growing so tall   and so pretty that I am afraid.&quot; 
  &quot;Afraid! My brother afraid to kiss me! And what will you do when I  get  to be a woman, Jan&#8212;which will be very soon, you say?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know, M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  She turned her back to him and flung out her hair; and Jan, who had   done this same thing for her a hundred times before, divided the   silken mass into three strands and plaited them into a braid. 
  &quot;I don't believe that you care for me as much as you used to, Jan.  I  wish I were a woman, so that I might know if you are going to forget   me entirely!&quot; 
  Her shoulders trembled; and when he had finished his task, he found   that she was laughing, and that her eyes were swimming with a new   mischief which she was trying to hide from him. In that laugh there   was something which was not like M&eacute;lisse. Slight as the change was, he   noticed it; but instead of displeasing him, it set a vague sensation   of pleasure trilling like a new song within him. 
  When they reached the post, M&eacute;lisse went to the cabin with her   bakneesh, and Jan to the company's store. Tossing the vines upon the   table, M&eacute;lisse ran back to the door and watched him until he   disappeared. Her cheeks were flushed, her lips half parted in   excitement; and no sooner had he gone from view than she hurried to   Iowaka's home across the clearing. 
  It was fully three quarters of an hour later when Jan saw M&eacute;lisse,   with Iowaka's red shawl over her head, walking slowly and with extreme   precision of step back to the cabin. 
  &quot;I wonder if she has the earache,&quot; he said to himself, watching her   curiously. &quot;That is Iowaka's shawl, and she has it all about her   head.&quot; 
  &quot;A clear half-inch of the rarest wool from London,&quot; added the  cheery  voice of Jean de Gravois, whose moccasins had made no sound  behind  him. He always spoke in French to Jan. &quot;There is but one person  in the  world who looks better in it than your M&eacute;lisse, Jan Thoreau,  and that  is Iowaka, my wife. Blessed saints, man, but is she not  growing more  beautiful every day?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Jan. &quot;She will soon be a woman.&quot; 
  &quot;A woman!&quot; shouted Jean, who, not having his caribou whip, jumped  up  and down to emphasize his words. &quot;She will soon be a woman, did you   say, Jan Thoreau? And if she is not a woman at thirty, with two   children&#8212;God send others like them!&#8212;when will she be, I ask you?&quot; 
  &quot;I meant M&eacute;lisse,&quot; laughed Jan. 
  &quot;And I meant Iowaka,&quot; said Jean. &quot;Ah, there she is now, come out to   see if her Jean de Gravois is on his way home with the sugar for which   she sent him something like an hour ago; for you know she is chef de   cuisine of this affair to-night. Ah, she sees me not, and she turns   back heartily disappointed, I'll swear by all the saints in the   calendar! Did you ever see a figure like that, Jan Thoreau? And did   you ever see hair that shines so, like the top-feathers of a raven   who's nibbling at himself in the hottest bit of sunshine he can find?   Deliver us, but I'll go with the sugar this minute!&quot; 
  The happy Jean hopped out, like a cricket over-burdened with life,   calling loudly to his wife, who came to meet him. 
  A few minutes later Jan thrust his head in at their door, as he was   passing. 
  &quot;I knew I should get a beating, or something worse, for forgetting   that sugar,&quot; cried the little Frenchman, holding up his bared arms.   &quot;Dough&#8212;dough&#8212;dough&#8212;I'm rolling dough&#8212;dough for the bread, dough   for the cakes, dough for the pies&#8212;dough, Jan Thoreau, just common   flour and water mixed and swabbed&#8212;I, Jean de Gravois, chief man at   Post Lac Bain, am mixing dough! She is as beautiful as an angel and   sweeter than sugar&#8212;my Iowaka, I mean; but there is more flesh in her   earthly tabernacle than in mine, so I am compelled to mix this dough,   mon ami. Iowaka, my dear, tell Jan what you were telling me, about   M&eacute;lisse and&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Hush!&quot; cried Iowaka in her sweet Cree. &quot;That is for Jan to find  out  for himself.&quot; 
  &quot;So&#8212;so it is,&quot; exclaimed the irrepressible Jean, plunging himself  to  the elbows in his pan of dough. &quot;Then hurry to the cabin, Jan, and  see  what sort of a birthday gift M&eacute;lisse has got for you.&quot;
