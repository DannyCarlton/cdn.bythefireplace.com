  Dick was bent down in his saddle, trying to protect himself a little  from the driving rain which beat in his eyes and soaked through his  clothing. Warner and Pennington beside him were in the same condition,  and he saw just before him the bent back of Colonel Winchester, with  his left arm raised as a shield for his face. Hoofs and wheels made a  heavy, sticky sound as they sank in the mud, and were then pulled out  again.
  &#8220;Do you see any signs of daylight, Dick?&#8221; asked Pennington.
  &#8220;Not a sign. I see only a part of our regiment, trees on either side  of us bending before the wind, and rain, and mud, mud everywhere. I'll  be glad when it's over.&#8221;
  &#8220;So will I,&#8221; said Warner. &#8220;I wonder what kind of hotels they have in  Jackson. I'd like to have a bath, good room and a big breakfast.&#8221;
  &#8220;The Johnnies are holding breakfast for you,&#8221; said Pennington.  &#8220;Their first course is gunpowder, their second bullets, their third  shells and shrapnel, and their fourth bayonets.&#8221;
  &#8220;They'll have to serve a lot at every course,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;because  General Grant is advancing with fifty thousand men, and so many need a  lot of satisfying.&#8221;
  The storm increased in violence. The rain, falling in a deluge, was  driven by a wind like a hurricane. The horses strove to turn their  heads from it, and confusion arose among the cavalry. The infantry  mixed in the mud swore heavily. Staff officers had the utmost  difficulty in keeping the regiments together. It was time for the sun,  but it did not appear. Everything was veiled in clouds and driving  rain.
  Dick looked at his watch, and saw that it was seven o'clock. They  had intended to attack at this hour, but further advance was impossible  for the time, and, bending their heads, they sought to protect their  ammunition. Presently they started again and toiled along slowly and  painfully for more than two hours. Then, just as they saw the enemy  ahead of them, the storm seemed to reach the very zenith of its fury.
  Dick, in the vanguard, beheld earthworks, cannon and troops before  Jackson, but the storm still drove so hard that the Union forces could  not advance to the assault.
  &#8220;This is certainly a most unusual situation,&#8221; said Colonel  Winchester, with an effort at cheerfulness. &#8220;Here we are, ready to  attack, and the Southerners are ready to defend, but a storm holds us  both fast in our tracks. Our duty to protect our cartridges is even  greater than our duty to attack the enemy.&#8221;
  &#8220;The biggest rain must come to an end,&#8221; said Dick.
  But it was nearly noon before they could advance. Then, as the storm  decreased rapidly the trumpets sounded the charge, and horse, foot and  artillery, they pressed forward eagerly through the mud.
  The sun broke through the clouds, and Dick saw before them a wood, a  ravine full of thickets, and the road commanded by strong artillery.  The Northern skirmishers were already stealing forward through the wet  bushes and grass, and soon their rifles were crackling. But the  Southern sharpshooters in the thickets were in stronger force, and  their rapid and accurate fire drove back the Northern men. Then their  artillery opened and swept the road, while the Northern batteries were  making frantic efforts to get up through the deep, sticky mud.
  But the trumpets were still calling. The Winchester regiment and  others, eager for battle and victory, swept forward. Dick felt once  more the fierce thrill of combat, and, waving his revolver high above  his head, he shouted with the others as they rushed on. The stream of  bullets from the ravine thickened, and the cannon were crashing fast.  But the Union masses did not check their rush for an instant. Although  many fell they charged into the ravine, driving out the enemy, and  pursued him on the other side.
  But the Southern cannon, manned by daring gunners, still held the  field and, aided by the thick mud which held back charging feet, they  repulsed every attack. The Winchester regiment was forced to cover, and  then Dick heard the booming of cannon in another direction. He knew  that Grant and Sherman were coming up there, and he expected they would  rush at once into Jackson, but it was a long time before the distant  thunder came any nearer.
  Johnston, whose astuteness they feared, was proving himself worthy  of their opinion. Knowing that his forces were far too small to defend  Jackson, he had sent away the archives of the state and most of the  army. Only a small force and seventeen cannon were left to fight and  cover his retreat. But so bold and skillful were they that it was far  beyond noon before Grant and Sherman found that practically nothing was  in front of them.
  But where Dick and his comrades rode the fighting was severe for a  while. Then everything seemed to melt away before them. The fire of the  Southern cannon ceased suddenly, and Colonel Winchester exclaimed that  their works had been abandoned. They charged forward, seized the  cannon, and now rode without resistance into the capital of the state,  from which the President of the Confederacy hailed, though by birth a  Kentuckian.
  Dick and his comrades were among the first to enter the town, and  not until then did they know that Johnston and all but a few hundreds  of his army were gone.
  &#8220;We've got the shell only,&#8221; Dick said.
  &#8220;Still we've struck a blow by taking the capital of the state,&#8221; said  Colonel Winchester.
  Dick looked with much curiosity at the little city into which they  were riding as conquerors. It was too small and new to be imposing. Yet  there were some handsome houses, standing back on large lawns, and  surrounded by foliage. The doors and shutters of all of them were  closed tightly. Dick knew that their owners had gone away or were  sitting, hearts full of bitterness, in their sealed houses.
  The streets were deep in mud, and at the corners little knots of  negroes gathered and looked at them curiously.
  &#8220;They don't seem to welcome us as deliverers,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;They don't yet know what to think of us,&#8221; said Dick. &#8220;There's the  Capitol ahead of us, and some of our troops are going into it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Others have gone into it already,&#8221; said Pennington. &#8220;Look!&#8221;
  They saw the flag of the Union break out above its dome, the  beautiful stars and stripes, waving gently in the light breeze. A  spontaneous cheer burst from the Union soldiers, and the bitter hearts  in the sealed houses grew more bitter.
  The army was now pouring in by every road and Colonel Winchester and  his staff sought quarters. They were on the verge of exhaustion. All  their clothing was wet and they were discolored with mud. They felt  that they were bound to have rest and cleanliness.
  The victorious troops were making their camp, wherever they could  find dry ground, and soon they were building the fires for cooking. But  many of the officers were assigned to the residences, and Colonel  Winchester and his staff were directed by the general to take quarters  in a large colonial house, standing on a broad lawn, amid the finest  magnolias and live oaks that Dick had ever seen.
  Remembering an earlier experience during the Shiloh campaign Colonel  Winchester and his young officers approached the house with some  reluctance. In ordinary times it must have been brilliant with life.  Two little fountains were playing on either side of the graveled walk  that led to the front door. After the old fashion, three or four marble  statues stood in the shrubbery. Everything indicated wealth. Probably  the town house of a great planter, reflected Dick. In Mississippi a man  sometimes owned as many as a thousand slaves, and lived like a prince.
  The house offered them no welcome. Its doors and windows were  closed, but Dick had seen thin smoke rising from a chimney in the rear.  He expected that they would have to force the door, but at the first  knock it was thrown open by a tall, thin woman of middle years. The  look she gave them was full of bitter hatred&#8212;Dick sometimes thought  that women could hate better than men&#8212;but her manner and bearing  showed distinction. He, as well as his comrades, took her to be the  lady of the house.
  &#8220;We ask your pardon, madame, for this intrusion,&#8221; said Colonel  Winchester, &#8220;but we are compelled to occupy your house a while. We  promise you as little trouble as possible.&#8221;
  &#8220;We ask no consideration of any kind from men who have come to  despoil our country and ruin its people,&#8221; she said icily.
  Colonel Winchester flushed.
  &#8220;But madame,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;we do not come to destroy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do not care to argue with you about it,&#8221; she said in the same  lofty tone, &#8220;and also you need not address me as madame. I am Miss  Woodville.&#8221;
  Dick started.
  &#8220;Does this house belong to Colonel John Woodville?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;It does not,&#8221; she replied crisply, &#8220;but it belongs to his elder  brother, Charles Woodville, who is also a colonel, and who is my  father. What do you know of Colonel John Woodville?&#8221;
  &#8220;I met his son once,&#8221; replied Dick briefly.
  She glanced at him sharply. Dick thought for a moment that he saw  alarm in her look, but he concluded that it was only anger.
  They stood confronting each other, the little group of officers and  the woman, and Colonel Winchester, embarrassed, but knowing that he  must do something, went forward and pushed back a door opening into the  hall. Dick automatically followed him, and then stepped back, startled.
  A roar like that of a lion met them. An old man, with a high, bald  and extremely red forehead lay in a huge bed by a window. It was a  great head, and eyes, set deep, blazed under thick, white lashes. His  body was covered to the chin.
  Dick saw that the man's anger was that of the caged wild beast, and  there was something splendid and terrible about it.
  &#8220;You infernal Yankees!&#8221; he cried, and his voice again rumbled like  that of a lion.
  &#8220;Colonel Charles Woodville, I presume?&#8221; said Colonel Winchester  politely.
  &#8220;Yes, Colonel Charles Woodville,&#8221; thundered the man, &#8220;fastened here  in bed by a bullet from one of your cursed vessels in the Mississippi,  while you rob and destroy!&#8221;
  And then he began to curse. He drew one hand from under the cover  and shook his clenched fist at them in a kind of rhythmic beat while  the oaths poured forth. To Dick it was not common swearing. There was  nothing coarse and vulgar about it. It was denunciation, malediction,  fulmination, anathema. It had a certain majesty and dignity. Its  richness and variety were unequaled, and it was hurled forth by a voice  deep, powerful and enduring.
  Dick listened with amazement and then admiration. He had never heard  its like, nor did he feel any offense. The daughter, too, stood by,  pursing her prim lips, and evidently approving. Colonel Winchester was  motionless like a statue, while the infuriated man shook his fist at  him and launched imprecations. But his face had turned white and Dick  saw that he was fiercely angry.
  When the old man ceased at last from exhaustion Colonel Winchester  said quietly:
  &#8220;If you had spoken to me in the proper manner we might have gone  away and found quarters elsewhere. But we intend to stay here and we  will repay your abuse with good manners.&#8221;
  Dick saw the daughter flush, but the old man said:
  &#8220;Then it will be the first time that good manners were ever brought  from the country north of the Mason and Dixon line.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester flushed in his turn, but made no direct reply.
  &#8220;If you will assign us rooms, Miss Woodville,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we will go  to them, otherwise we'll find them for ourselves, which may be less  convenient for you. I repeat that we desire to give you as little  trouble as possible.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do so, Margaret,&#8221; interrupted Colonel Woodville, &#8220;because then I  may get rid of them all the sooner.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester bowed and turned toward the door. Miss Woodville,  obedient to the command of her father, led the way. Dick was the last  to go out, and he said to the old lion who lay wounded in the bed:
  &#8220;Colonel Woodville, I've met your nephew, Victor.&#8221;
  He did not notice that the old man whitened and that the hand now  lying upon the cover clenched suddenly.
  &#8220;You have?&#8221; growled Colonel Woodville, &#8220;and how does it happen that  you and my nephew have anything in common?&#8221;
  &#8220;I could scarcely put it that way,&#8221; replied Dick, refusing to be  angered, &#8220;unless you call an encounter with fists something in common.  He and I had a great fight at his father's plantation of Bellevue.&#8221;
  &#8220;He might have been in a better business, taking part in a common  brawl with a common Yankee.&#8221;
  &#8220;But, sir, while I may be common, I'm not a Yankee. I was born and  grew up south of the Ohio River in Kentucky.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you're a traitor. All you Kentuckians ought to be fighting  with us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Difference of opinion, but I hope your nephew is well.&#8221;
  The deep eyes under the thick white thatch glared in a manner that  Dick considered wholly unnecessary. But Colonel Woodville made no  reply, merely turning his face to the wall as if he were weary.
  Dick hurried into the hall, closing the door gently behind him. The  others, not missing him, were already some yards away, and he quickly  rejoined Pennington and Warner. The younger men would have been glad to  leave the house, but Colonel Winchester's blood was up, and he was  resolved to stay. The little party was eight in number, and they were  soon quartered in four rooms on the lower floor. Miss Woodville  promptly disappeared, and one of the camp cooks arrived with supplies,  which he took to the kitchen.
  Dick and Warner were in one of the rooms, and, removing their belts  and coats, they made themselves easy. It was a large bedroom with high  ceilings and wicker furniture. There were several good paintings on the  walls and a bookcase contained Walter Scott's novels and many of the  eighteenth century classics.
  &#8220;I think this must have been a guest chamber,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;but for  us coming from the rain and mud it's a real palace.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then it's fulfilling its true function,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;because it  has guests now. What a strange household! Did you ever see such a  peppery pair as that swearing old colonel and his acid daughter?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know that I blame them. I think, sometimes, George, that  you New Englanders are the most selfish of people. You're too truly  righteous. You're always denouncing the faults of others, but you never  see any of your own. Away back in the Revolution when Boston called,  the Southern provinces came to her help, but Boston and New England  have spent a large part of their time since then denouncing the South.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's struck you, Dick? Are you weakening in the good cause?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not for a moment. But suppose Mississippi troops walked into your  own father's house in Vermont, and, as conquerors, demanded food and  shelter! Would you rejoice over them, and ask them why they hadn't come  sooner?&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose not, Dick. But, stop it, and come back to your normal  temperature. I won't quarrel with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I won't give you a chance, George. I'm through. But remember that  while I'm red hot for the Union, I was born south of the Ohio River  myself, and I have lots of sympathy for the people against whom I'm  fighting.&#8221;
  &#8220;For the matter of that, so've I, Dick, and I was born north of the  Ohio River. But I'm getting tremendously hungry. I hope that cook will  hurry.&#8221;
  They were called soon, and eight officers sat at the table. The cook  himself served them. Miss Woodville had vanished, and not a servant was  visible about the great house. Despite their hunger and the good  quality of the food the group felt constraint. The feeling that they  were intruders, in a sense brigands, was forced upon them. Dick was  sure that the old man with the great bald head was swearing fiercely  and incessantly under his breath.
  The dining-room was a large and splendid apartment, and the silver  still lay upon the great mahogany sideboard. The little city, now the  camp of an overwhelming army, had settled into silence, and the  twilight was coming.
  With the chill of unwelcome still upon them the officers said  little. As the twilight deepened Warner lighted several candles. The  silver glittered under the flame. Colonel Winchester presently ordered  the cook to take a plate of the most delicate food to Colonel  Woodville.
  As the cook withdrew on his mission he left open the door of the  dining-room and they heard the sound of a voice, uplifted in a  thunderous roar. The cook hurried back, the untouched plate in his hand  and his face a little pale.
  &#8220;He cursed me, sir,&#8221; he said to Colonel Winchester. &#8220;I was never  cursed so before by anybody. He said he would not touch the food. He  was sure that it had been poisoned by the Yankees, and even if it were  not he'd rather die than accept anything from their hands.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester laughed rather awkwardly.
  &#8220;At any rate, we've tendered our good offices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suppose  his daughter will attend to his wants, and we'll not expose ourselves  to further insults.&#8221;
  But the refusal had affected the spirits of them all, and as soon as  their hunger was satisfied they withdrew. The soldier who had acted as  cook was directed to put the dining-room back in order and then he  might sleep in a room near the kitchen.
  Dick and Warner returned to their own apartment. Neither had much to  say, and Warner, lying down on the bed, was soon fast asleep. Dick sat  by the window. The town was now almost lost in the obscurity. The  exhausted army slept, and the occasional glitter from the bayonet of a  sentinel was almost the only thing that told of its presence.
  Dick was troubled. In spite of will and reason, his conscience hurt  him. Theory was beautiful, but it was often shivered by practice. His  sympathies were strongly with the old colonel who had cursed him so  violently and the grim old maid who had given them only harsh words.  Besides, he had pleasant memories of Victor Woodville, and these were  his uncle and cousin.
  He sat for a long time at the window. The house was absolutely  quiet, and he was sure that everybody was asleep. There could be no  doubt about Warner, because he slumbered audibly. But Dick was still  wide awake. There was some tension of mind or muscle that kept sleep  far from him. So he remained at the window, casting up the events of  the day and those that might come.
  The evening was well advanced when he was quite sure that he heard a  light step in the hall. He would have paid little attention to it at an  ordinary time, but, in all that silence and desolation, it called him  like a drum-beat. Only a light step, and yet it filled him with  suspicion and alarm. He was in the heart of a great and victorious  Union army, but at the moment he felt that anything could happen in  this strange house.
  Slipping his pistol from his belt, he opened the door on noiseless  hinges and stepped into the hall. A figure was disappearing in its dim  space, but, as he saw clearly, it was that of a woman. He was sure that  it was Miss Woodville and he stepped forward. He had no intention of  following her, but his foot creaked on the floor, and, stopping  instantly, she faced about. Then he saw that she carried a tray of  food.
  &#8220;Are we to have our house occupied and to be spied upon also?&#8221; she  asked.
  Dick flushed. Few people had ever spoken to him in such a manner,  and it was hard to remember that she was a woman.
  &#8220;I heard a footstep in the hall, and it was my duty to see who was  passing,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I have prepared food and I am taking it to my father. He would not  accept it from Yankee hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Woodville sups late. I should think a wounded man would be  asleep at this hour, if he could.&#8221;
  She gave him a glance full of venom.
  &#8220;What does it matter?&#8221; she said.
  Dick refused to be insulted.
  &#8220;Let me take the tray for you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at least to the door. Your  father need not know that my hands have touched it.&#8221;
  She shrank back and her eyes blazed.
  &#8220;Let us alone!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Go back to your room! Isn't it  sufficient that this house shelters you?&#8221;
  She seemed to Dick to show a heat and hate out of all proportion to  the occasion, but he did not repeat the offer.
  &#8220;I meant well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but, since you do not care for my help,  I'll return to my room and go to sleep. Believe me, I'm sincere when I  say I hope your father will recover quickly from his wound.&#8221;
  &#8220;He will,&#8221; she replied briefly.
  Dick bowed with politeness and turned toward his own room.  Nevertheless his curiosity did not keep him from standing a moment or  two in the dark against the wall and looking back at the woman who bore  the tray. He drew a long breath of astonishment when he saw her pass  Colonel Woodville's door, and hurry forward now with footsteps that  made no sound.
  The suspicion which had lain deep in his mind sprang at once into  life. Keeping close to the wall, he followed swiftly and saw her  disappear up a stairway. There he let the pursuit end and returned  thoughtfully to his room.
  Dick was much troubled. An ethical question had presented itself to  him. He believed that he had divined everything. The solution had come  to him with such suddenness and force that he was as fully convinced as  if he had seen with his own eyes. Military duty demanded that he invade  the second floor of the Woodville house. But there were feelings of  humanity and mercy, moral issues not less powerful than military duty,  and maybe more so.
  He was pulled back and forth with great mental violence. He was  sorry that he had seen Miss Woodville with the tray. And then he  wasn't. Nevertheless, he stayed in his own room, and Warner, waking for  a moment, regarded him with wonder as he sat outlined against the  window which they had left unshuttered and opened to admit air.
  &#8220;What's the matter, Dick? Have you got a fever?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why  haven't you gone to bed?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm going to do so right away. Don't bother yourself about me,  George. My nerves have been strained pretty hard, and I had to wait  until they were quiet until I could go to sleep.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't have nerves,&#8221; said Warner, as he turned back on his side and  returned to slumber.
  Dick undressed and got into bed. It was the first time in many  nights that he had not slept in his clothes, and beds had been unknown  for many weeks. It was a luxury so penetrating and powerful that it  affected him like an opiate. Such questions as military and moral duty  floated swiftly away, and he slept the sleep of youth and a good heart.
  Breakfast was almost a repetition of supper. The army cook prepared  and served it, and the Woodvilles remained invisible. Colonel  Winchester informed the young officers that they would remain in  Jackson two or three days, and then great events might be expected. All  felt sure that he was predicting aright. Pemberton must be approaching  with the Vicksburg army. The wary and skillful Johnston had another  army, and he could not be far away. Moreover, this was the heart of the  Confederacy and other unknown forces might be gathering.
  They felt the greatness of the hour, Grant's daring stroke, and the  possibility that he might yet be surrounded and overwhelmed. Their  minds were attuned, too, to other and yet mightier deeds, but they were  glad, nevertheless, of a little rest. The Woodville house was a  splendid place, and in the morning they did not feel so much the chill  of embarrassment that had been created for them the night before.
  Dick went straight to the room of Colonel Woodville, opened the door  without knocking, and closed it behind him quickly but noiselessly.
  The colonel was propped up in his bed and a tray bearing light and  delicate food lay on a chair. His daughter stood beside the bed,  speechless with anger at this intrusion. Dick lifted his hand, and the  look upon his face checked one of the mightiest oaths that had ever  welled up from the throat of Colonel Charles Woodville, king of  swearers.
  &#8220;Stop!&#8221; said Dick in a voice not loud, but sharp with command.
  &#8220;Can't we at least have privacy in the room of an old and wounded  man?&#8221; asked Miss Woodville.
  &#8220;You can hereafter,&#8221; replied Dick quietly. &#8220;I shall not come again,  but I tell you now to get him out of the house to-night, unless he's  too badly hurt to be moved.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why should my father be taken away?&#8221; demanded Miss Woodville.
  &#8220;I'm not speaking of your father.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of whom, then?&#8221;
  Dick did not answer, but he met her gaze steadily, and her face  fell. Then he turned, walked out of the room without a word, and again  closed the door behind him. When he went out on the piazza he saw  excitement among his comrades. The moment for great action was coming  even sooner than Colonel Winchester had expected.
  &#8220;Johnston is communicating with Pemberton,&#8221; said Warner, &#8220;and he has  ordered Pemberton to unite with him. Then they will attack us. He sent  the same order by three messengers, but one of them was in reality a  spy of ours, and he came straight to General Grant with it. We're  forewarned, and the trap can't shut down on us, because General Grant  means to go at once for Pemberton.&#8221;
  Dick understood the situation, which was both critical and  thrilling. Grant was still in the heart of the Confederacy, and its  forces were converging fast upon him. But the grim and silent man,  instead of merely trying to escape, intended to strike a blow that  would make escape unnecessary. All the young officers saw the plan and  their hearts leaped.
  Dick, in the excitement of the day, forgot about the Woodville house  and its inmates. Troops were already marching out of Jackson to meet  the enemy, but the Winchester regiment would not leave until early the  next morning. They were to spend a second night, or at least a part of  it, in Colonel Woodville's house.
  It was the same group that ate supper there and the same army cook  served them. They did not go to the bedrooms afterward, but strolled  about, belted, expecting to receive the marching call at any moment.
  Dick went into the library, where a single candle burned, and while  he was there Miss Woodville appeared at the door and beckoned to him.  She had abated her severity of manner so much that he was astonished,  but he followed without a word.
  She saw that the hall was clear and then she led quickly into her  father's room. Colonel Woodville was propped up against the pillows,  and there was color in his face.
  &#8220;Young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;come here. You can afford to obey me,  although I'm a prisoner, because I'm so much older than you are. You  have a heart and breeding, young sir, and I wish to shake your hand.&#8221;
  He thrust a large hand from the cover, and Dick shook it warmly.
  &#8220;I wouldn't have shaken it if you had been born north of the Ohio  River,&#8221; said Colonel Woodville.
  Dick laughed.
  &#8220;My chief purpose in having you brought here,&#8221; said Colonel  Woodville, &#8220;was to relate to you an incident, of which I heard once.  Did I read about it, or was it told to me, Margaret?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think, sir, that some one told you of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ah, well, it doesn't matter. A few words will tell it. In an old,  forgotten war a young soldier quartered in the house of his defeated  enemy&#8212;but defeated only for the time, remember&#8212;saw something which  made him believe that a wounded nephew of the house was hid in an upper  room. But he was generous and he did not search further. The second  night, while the young officer and his comrades were at supper, the  nephew, who was not hurt badly, was slipped out of the house and  escaped from the city in the darkness. It's not apropos of anything,  and I don't know why I'm relating it to you, but I suppose this  terrible war we are fighting is responsible for an old man's whim.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've found it very interesting, sir,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;and I think it's  relevant, because it shows that even in war men may remain Christian  human beings.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you're right, and I trust, young sir, that you will not be  killed in this defeat to which you are surely marching.&#8221;
  Dick bowed to both, and left them to their fears and hopes. The glow  was still about his heart when he rode forth with the Winchester  regiment after midnight. But, owing to the need of horses for the  regular cavalry, it had become an infantry regiment once more. Only the  officers rode.
  At dawn they were with Grant approaching a ridge called Champion  Hill.
