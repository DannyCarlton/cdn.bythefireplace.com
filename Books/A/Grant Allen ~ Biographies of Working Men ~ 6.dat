At the present time, the neighbourhood of Cleveland, Ohio, the busiest  town along the southern shore of Lake Erie, may fairly rank as one of  the richest agricultural districts in all America. But when Abram  Garfield settled down in the township of Orange in 1830, it was one of  the wildest and most unpeopled woodland regions in the whole of the  United States. Pioneers from the older states had only just begun to  make little clearings for themselves in the unbroken forest; and land  was still so cheap that Abram Garfield was able to buy himself a tract  of fifty acres for no more than L20. His brother-in-law's family removed  there with him; and the whole strength of the two households was  immediately employed in building a rough log hut for their common  accommodation, where both the Garfields and the Boyntons lived together  during the early days of their occupation. The hut consisted of a mere  square box, made by piling logs on top of one another, the spaces  between being filled with mud, while the roof was formed of loose stone  slabs. Huts of that sort are everywhere common among the isolation of  the American backwoods; and isolated indeed they were, for the  Garfields' nearest neighbours, when they first set up house, lived as  far as seven miles away, across the uncleared forest.    
When Abram Garfield came to this lonely lodge in the primaeval  woodlands, he had one son and one daughter. In 1831, the year after his  removal to his new home, a second boy was born into the family, whom his  father named James Abram. Before the baby was eighteen months old, the  father died, and was buried alone, after the only possible fashion among  such solitary settlers, in a corner of the wheat field which he himself  had cleared of its stumps. A widow's life is always a hard one, but in  such a country and under such conditions it is even harder and more  lonely than elsewhere. Mrs. Garfield's eldest boy, Thomas, was only  eleven years old; and with the aid of this one ineffectual helper, she  managed herself to carry on the farm for many years. Only those who know  the hard toil of a raw American township can have any idea what that  really means. A farmer's work in America is not like a farmer's work in  England. The man who occupies the soil is there at once his own landlord  and his own labourer; and he has to contend with nature as nobody in  England has had to contend with it for the last five centuries at least.  He finds the land covered with trees, which he has first to fell and  sell as timber; then he must dig or burn out the stumps; clear the plot  of boulders and large stones; drain it, fence it, plough it, and harrow  it; build barns for the produce and sheds for the cows; in short,  <i>make</i> his farm, instead of merely <i>taking</i> it. This is labour  from which many strong men shrink in dismay, especially those who have  come out fresh from a civilized and fully occupied land. For a woman and  a boy, it is a task that seems almost above their utmost powers.  Nevertheless, Mrs. Garfield and her son did not fail under it. With her  own hands, the mother split up the young trees into rude triangular  rails to make the rough snake fences of the country--mere zigzags of  wood laid one bit above the other; while the lad worked away bravely at  sowing fall and spring wheat, hoeing Indian corn, and building a little  barn for the harvest before the arrival of the long cold Ohio winter. To  such a family did the future President originally belong; and with them  he must have shared those strong qualities of perseverance and industry  which more than anything else at length secured his ultimate success in  life.    
For James Garfield's history differs greatly in one point from that of  most other famous working men, whose stories have been told in this  volume. There is no reason to believe that he was a man of exceptional  or commanding intellect. On the contrary, his mental powers appear to  have been of a very respectable but quite ordinary and commonplace  order. It was not by brilliant genius that James Garfield made his way  up in life; it was rather by hard work, unceasing energy, high  principle, and generous enthusiasm for the cause of others. Some of the  greatest geniuses among working men, such as Burns, Tannahill, and  Chatterton, though they achieved fame, and though they have enriched the  world with many touching and beautiful works, must be considered to have  missed success in life, so far as their own happiness was concerned, by  their unsteadiness, want of self-control, or lack of fixed principle.  Garfield, on the other hand, was not a genius; but by his sterling good  qualities he nevertheless achieved what cannot but be regarded as a true  success, and left an honourable name behind him in the history of his  country.    
However poor an American township may be, it is seldom too poor to  afford its children a moderate and humble education. While James  Garfield was still very young, the settlers in the neighbourhood decided  to import a schoolmaster, whom they "boarded about" between them, after  a fashion very common in rural western districts. The school-house was  only a log hut; the master was a lad of twenty; and the textbooks were  of the very meagrest sort. But at least James Garfield was thus enabled  to read and write, which after all is the great first step on the road  to all possible promotion. The raw, uncouth Yankee lad who taught the  Ohio boys, slept at Widow Garfield's, with Thomas and James; and the  sons of the neighbouring settlers worked on the farm during the summer  months, but took lessons when the long ice and snow of winter along the  lake shore put a stop almost entirely for the time to their usual  labours.    
James continued at school till he was twelve years old, and then, his  brother Thomas (being by that time twenty-one) went away by agreement  still further west to Michigan, leaving young Jim to take his place upon  the little farm. The fences were all completed by this time; the barn  was built, the ground was fairly brought under cultivation, and it  required comparatively little labour to keep the land cropped after the  rough fashion which amply satisfies American pioneers, with no rent to  pay, and only their bare living to make out of the soil. Thomas was  going to fell trees in Michigan, to clear land there for a farmer; and  he proposed to use his earnings (when he got them) for the purpose of  building a "frame house" (that is to say, a house built of planks)  instead of the existing log hut. It must be added, in fairness, that  hard as were the circumstances under which the young Garfields lived,  they were yet lucky in their situation in a new country, where wages  were high, and where the struggle for life is far less severe or  competitive than in old settled lands like France and England. Thomas,  in fact; would get boarded for nothing in Michigan, and so would be able  easily to save almost all his high wages for the purpose of building the  frame house.    
So James had to take to the farm in summer, while in the winter he began  to work as a sort of amateur carpenter in a small way. As yet he had  lived entirely in the backwoods, and had never seen a town or even a  village; but his education in practical work had begun from his very  babyhood, and he was handy after the usual fashion of American or  colonial boys--ready to turn his hand to anything that happened to  present itself. In new countries, where everybody has not got neighbours  and workmen within call, such rough-and-ready handiness is far more  common than in old England. The one carpenter of the neighbourhood asked  James to help him, on the proud day when Tom brought back his earnings  from Michigan, and set about the building of the frame house, for which  he had already collected the unhewn timber. From that first beginning,  by the time he was thirteen, James was promoted to assist in building a  barn; and he might have taken permanently to a carpenter's life, had it  not been that his boyish passion for reading had inspired him with an  equal passion for going to sea. He had read Marryatt's novels and other  sailor tales--what boy has not?--and he was fired with the usual  childish desire to embark upon that wonderful life of chasing  buccaneers, fighting pirates, capturing prizes, or hunting hidden  treasure, which is a lad's brilliantly coloured fancy picture of an  everyday sailor's wet, cold, cheerless occupation.    
At last, when James was about fifteen, his longing for the sea grew so  strong that his mother, by way of a compromise, allowed him to go and  try his luck with the Lake Erie captains at Cleveland. Shipping on the  great lakes, where one can see neither bank from the middle of the wide  blue sheet of water, and where wrecks are unhappily as painfully  frequent as on our own coasts, was quite sufficiently like going to sea  to suit the adventurous young backwoodsman to the top of his bent. But  when he got to Cleveland, a fortunate disappointment awaited him. The  Cleveland captains declined his services in such vigorous seafaring  language (not unmixed with many unnecessary oaths), that he was glad  enough to give up the idea of sailoring, and take a place as driver of a  canal boat from Cleveland to Pittsburg in Pennsylvania, the boat being  under the charge of one of his own cousins. Copper ore was then largely  mined on Lake Superior, where it is very abundant, carried by ship to  Cleveland, down the chain of lakes, and there transferred to canal  boats, which took it on to Pittsburg, the centre of a great coal and  manufacturing district in Pennsylvania, to be smelted and employed in  various local arts. Young Garfield stuck for a little while to the canal  business. He plodded along wearily upon the bank, driving his still  wearier horse before him, and carrying ore down to Pittsburg with such  grace as he best might; but it didn't somehow quite come up to his fancy  picture of the seaman's life. It was dull and monotonous, and he didn't  care for it much. In genuine American language, "he didn't find it up to  sample." The sea might be very well in its way; but a canal was a very  different matter indeed. So after a fair trial, James finally gave the  business up, and returned to his mother on the little homestead, ill and  tired with his long tramping.    
While he was at home, the schoolmaster of the place, who saw that the  lad had abilities, was never tired of urging him to go to school, and do  himself justice by getting himself a first-rate education, or at least  as good a one as could be obtained in America. James was ready enough to  take this advice, if the means were forthcoming; but how was he to do  so? "Oh, that's easy enough," said young Bates, the master. "You'll only  have to work out of hours as a carpenter, take odd jobs in your  vacations, live plainly, and there you are." In England there are few  schools where such a plan would be practicable; but in rough-and-ready  America, where self-help is no disgrace, there are many, and they are  all well attended. In the neighbouring town of Chester, a petty Baptist  sect had started a young school which they named Geauga Seminary (there  are no plain schools in America--they are all "academies" or  "institutes"); and to this simple place young Garfield went, to learn  and work as best he might for his own advancement. A very strange figure  he must then have cut, indeed; for a person who saw him at the time  described him as wearing a pair of trousers he had long outworn, rough  cow-hide boots, a waistcoat much too short for him, and a thread-bare  coat, with sleeves that only reached a little below the elbows. Of such  stuff as that, with a stout heart and an eager brain, the budding  presidents of the United States are sometimes made.    
James soon found himself humble lodgings at an old woman's in Chester,  and he also found himself a stray place at a carpenter's shop in the  town, where he was able to do three hours' work out of school time every  day, besides giving up the whole of his Saturday holiday to regular  labour. It was hard work, this schooling and carpentering side by side;  but James throve upon it; and at the end of the first term he was not  only able to pay all his bill for board and lodging, but also to carry  home a few dollars in his pocket by way of savings.    
James stopped three years at the "seminary" at Chester; and in the  holidays he employed himself by teaching in the little township schools  among the country districts. There is generally an opening for young  students to earn a little at such times by instructing younger boys than  themselves in reading, writing, and arithmetic; and the surrounding  farmers, who want schooling for their boys, are glad enough to take the  master in on the "boarding round" system, for the sake of his usefulness  in overlooking the lads in the preparation of their home lessons. It is  a simple patriarchal life, very different from anything we know in  England; and though Ohio was by this time a far more settled and  populated place than when Abram Garfield first went there, it was still  quite possible to manage in this extremely primitive and family fashion.  The fact is, though luxuries were comparatively unknown, food was cheap  and abundant; and a young teacher who was willing to put his heart into  his work could easily earn more than enough to live upon in rough  comfort. Sometimes the school-house was a mere log hut, like that in  which young Garfield had been born; but, at any rate, it was work to do,  and food to eat, and that alone was a great thing for a lad who meant to  make his own way in the world by his own exertions.    
Near the end of his third year at Chester, James met, quite  accidentally, with a young man who had come from a little embryo  "college," of the sort so common in rising American towns, at a place  called Hiram in Ohio. American schools are almost as remarkable as  American towns for the oddity and ugliness of their names; and this  "college" was known by the queer and meaningless title of the "Eclectic  Institute." It was conducted by an obscure sect who dub themselves "The  Disciples' Church," to which young Garfield's father and mother had both  belonged. His casual acquaintance urged upon him strongly the  desirability of attending the institute; and James, who had already  begun to learn Latin, and wished to learn more, was easily persuaded to  try this particular school rather than any other.    
In August, 1851, James Garfield, then aged nearly twenty, presented  himself at the "Eclectic Institute," in the farm-labourer's clothes  which were his only existing raiment. He asked to see the "president" of  the school, and told him plainly that he wished to come there for  education, but that he was poor, and if he came, he must work for his  living. "What can you do?" asked the president. "Sweep the floors, light  the fires, ring the bell, and make myself generally useful," answered  the young backwoodsman. The president, pleased with his eagerness,  promised to try him for a fortnight; and at the end of the fortnight,  Garfield had earned his teaching so well that he was excused from all  further fees during the remainder of his stay at the little institute.  His post was by no mean an easy one, for he was servant-of-all-work as  well as student; but he cared very little for that as long as he could  gain the means for self-improvement.    
Hiram was a small town, as ugly as its name. Twelve miles from a  railway, a mere agricultural centre, of the rough back-country sort, all  brand new and dreary looking, with a couple of wooden churches, half a  dozen wooden shops, two new intersecting streets with wooden sidewalks,  and that was all. The "institute" was a square brick block, planted  incongruously in the middle of an Indian-corn plantation; and the  students were the sons and daughters of the surrounding farmers, for (as  in most western schools) both sexes were here educated together.    
But the place suited Garfield far better than an older and more  dignified university would have done. The other students knew no more  than he did, so that he did not feel himself at a disadvantage; they  were dressed almost as plainly as himself; and during the time he was at  Hiram he worked away with a will at Latin, Greek, and the higher  mathematics, so as to qualify himself for a better place hereafter.  Meanwhile, the local carpenter gave him plenty of planing to do, with  which he managed to pay his way; and as he had to rise before five every  morning to ring the first bell, he was under no danger of oversleeping  himself. By 1853, he had made so much progress in his studies that he  was admitted as a sort of pupil teacher, giving instruction himself in  the English department and in rudimentary Greek and Latin, while he went  on with his own studies with the aid of the other teachers.    
James had now learnt as much as the little "Eclectic Institute" could  possibly teach him, and he began to think of going to some better  college in the older-settled and more cultivated eastern states, where  he might get an education somewhat higher than was afforded him by the  raw "seminaries" and "academies" of his native Ohio. True, his own sect,  the "Disciples' Church," had got up a petty university of their own,  "Bethany College"--such self-styled colleges swarm all over the United  States; but James didn't much care for the idea of going to it. "I was  brought up among the Disciples," he said; "I have mixed chiefly among  them; I know little of other people; it will enlarge my views and give  me more liberal feelings if I try a college elsewhere, conducted  otherwise; if I see a little of the rest of the world." Moreover, those  were stirring times in the States. The slavery question was beginning to  come uppermost. The men of the free states in the north and west were  beginning to say among themselves that they would no longer tolerate  that terrible blot upon American freedom--the enslavement of four  million negroes in the cotton-growing south. James Garfield felt all his  soul stirred within him by this great national problem--the greatest  that any modern nation has ever had to solve for itself. Now, his own  sect, the Disciples, and their college, Bethany, were strongly tinctured  with a leaning in favour of slavery, which young James Garfield utterly  detested. So he made up his mind to having nothing to do with the  accursed thing, but to go east to some New England college, where he  would mix among men of culture, and where he would probably find more  congenial feelings on the slavery question.    
Before deciding, he wrote to three eastern colleges, amongst others to  Yale, the only American university which by its buildings and  surroundings can lay any claim to compare, even at a long distance, in  beauty and associations, with the least among European universities. The  three colleges gave him nearly similar answers; but one of them, in  addition to the formal statement of terms and so forth, added the short  kindly sentence, "If you come here, we shall be glad to do what we can  for you." It was only a small polite phrase; but it took the heart of  the rough western boy. If other things were about the same, he said, he  would go to the college which offered him, as it were, a friendly grasp  of the hand. He had saved a little money at Hiram; and he proposed now  to go on working for his living, as he had hitherto done, side by side  with his regular studies. But his brother, who was always kind and  thoughtful to him, would not hear of this. Thomas had prospered  meanwhile in his own small way, and he insisted upon lending James such  a sum as would cover his necessary expenses for two years at an eastern  university. James insured his life for the amount, so that Thomas might  not be a loser by his brotherly generosity in case of his death before  repayment could be made; and then, with the money safe in his pocket, he  started off for his chosen goal, the Williams College, in one of the  most beautiful and hilly parts of Massachusetts.    
During the three years that Garfield was at this place, he studied hard  and regularly, so much so that at one time his brain showed symptoms of  giving way under the constant strain. In the vacations, he took a trip  into Vermont, a romantic mountain state, where he opened a writing  school at a little country village; and another into the New York State,  where he engaged himself in a similar way at a small town on the banks  of the lovely Hudson river. At college, in spite of his rough western  dress and manners, he earned for himself the reputation of a thoroughly  good fellow. Indeed, geniality and warmth of manner, qualities always  much prized by the social American people, were very marked traits  throughout of Garfield's character, and no doubt helped him greatly in  after life in rising to the high summit which he finally reached. It was  here, too, that he first openly identified himself with the anti-slavery  party, which was then engaged in fighting out the important question  whether any new slave states should be admitted to the Union. Charles  Sumner, the real grand central figure of that noble struggle, was at  that moment thundering in Congress against the iniquitous extension of  the slave-holding area, and was employing all his magnificent powers to  assail the abominable Fugitive Slave Bill, for the return of runaway  negroes, who escaped north, into the hands of their angry masters. The  American colleges are always big debating societies, where questions of  politics are regularly argued out among the students; and Garfield put  himself at the head of the anti-slavery movement at his own little  university. He spoke upon the subject frequently before the assembled  students, and gained himself a considerable reputation, not only as a  zealous advocate of the rights of the negro, but also as an eloquent  orator and a powerful argumentative debater.    
In 1856, Garfield took his degree at Williams College, and had now  finished his formal education. By that time, he was a fair though not a  great scholar, competently read in the Greek and Latin literatures, and  with a good knowledge of French and German. He was now nearly twenty-  five years old; and his experience was large and varied enough to make  him already into a man of the world. He had been farmer, carpenter,  canal driver, and student; he had seen the primitive life of the forest,  and the more civilized society of the Atlantic shore; he had taught in  schools in many states; he had supported himself for years by his own  labours; and now, at an age when many young men are, as a rule, only  just beginning life on their own account, he had practically raised  himself from his own class into the class of educated and cultivated  gentlemen. As soon as he had taken his degree, his old friends, the  trustees of the "Eclectic Institute" at Hiram, proud of their former  sweeper and bell-ringer, called him back at a good salary as teacher of  Greek and Latin. It was then just ten years since he had toiled wearily  along the tow-path of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Canal.    
As a teacher, Garfield seems to have been eminently successful. His  genial character and good-natured way of explaining things made him a  favourite at once with the rough western lads he had to teach, who would  perhaps have thought a more formal teacher stiff and stuck-up. Garfield  was one of themselves; he knew their ways and their manners; he could  make allowances for their awkwardness and bluntness of speech; he could  adopt towards them the exact tone which put them at home at once with  their easy-going instructor. Certainly, he inspired all his pupils with  an immense love and devotion for him; and it is less easy to inspire  those feelings in a sturdy Ohio farmer than in most other varieties of  the essentially affectionate human species.    
From 1857 to 1861, Garfield remained at Hiram, teaching and working very  hard. His salary, though a good one for the time and place, was still  humble according to our English notions; but it sufficed for his needs;  and as yet it would have seemed hardly credible that in only twenty  years the Ohio schoolmaster would rise to be President of the United  States. Indeed, it is only in America, that country of peculiarly  unencumbered political action, where every kind of talent is most  rapidly recognized and utilized, that this particular form of swift  promotion is really possible. But while Garfield was still at his  Institute, he was taking a vigorous part in local politics, especially  on the slavery question. Whenever there was a political meeting at  Hiram, the young schoolmaster was always called upon to take the anti-  slavery side; and he delivered himself so effectively upon this  favourite topic that he began to be looked upon as a rising political  character. In America, politics are less confined to any one class than  in Europe; and there would be nothing unusual in the selection of a  schoolmaster who could talk to a seat in the local or general  legislature. The practice of paying members makes it possible for  comparatively poor men to offer themselves as candidates; and politics  are thus a career, in the sense of a livelihood, far more than in any  other country.    
In 1858, Garfield married a lady who had been a fellow-student of his in  earlier days, and to whom he had been long engaged. In the succeeding  year, he got an invitation which greatly pleased and flattered him. The  authorities at Williams College asked him to deliver the "Master's  Oration" at their annual festival; an unusual compliment to pay to so  young a man, and one who had so recently taken his degree. It was the  first opportunity he had ever had for a pleasure-trip, and taking his  young wife with him (proud indeed, we may be sure, at this earliest  honour of his life, the precursor of so many more) he went to  Massachusetts by a somewhat roundabout but very picturesque route, down  the Great Lakes, through the Thousand Islands, over the St. Lawrence  rapids, and on to Quebec, the only town in America which from its old-  world look can lay claim to the sort of beauty which so many ancient  European cities abundantly possess. He delivered his address with much  applause and returned to his Ohio home well satisfied with this pleasant  outing.    
Immediately on his return, the speech-making schoolmaster was met by a  very sudden and unexpected request that he would allow himself to be  nominated for the State legislature. Every state of the Union has its  own separate little legislative body, consisting of two houses; and it  was to the upper of these, the Senate of Ohio, that James Garfield was  asked to become a candidate. The schoolmaster consented; and as those  were times of very great excitement, when the South was threatening to  secede if a President hostile to the slave-owning interest was elected,  the contest was fought out almost entirely along those particular lines.  Garfield was returned as senator by a large majority, and took his seat  in the Ohio Senate in January, 1860. There, his voice was always raised  against slavery, and he was recognized at once as one of the ablest  speakers in the whole legislature.    
In 1861, the great storm burst over the States. In the preceding  November, Abraham Lincoln had been elected President. Lincoln was  himself, like Garfield, a self-made man, who had risen from the very  same pioneer labourer class;--a wood-cutter and rail-splitter in the  backwoods of Illinois, he had become a common boatman on the  Mississippi, and had there improved his mind by reading eagerly in all  his spare moments. With one of those rapid rises so commonly made by  self-taught lads in America, he had pushed his way into the Illinois  legislature by the time he was twenty-five, and qualified himself to  practise as a barrister at Springfield. His shrewd original talents had  raised him with wonderful quickness into the front ranks of his own  party; and when the question between the North and South rose into the  region of practical politics, Lincoln was selected by the republicans  (the anti-slavery group) as their candidate for the Presidency of the  United States. This selection was a very significant one in several  ways; Lincoln was a very strong opponent of slavery, and his candidature  showed the southern slaveowners that if the Republicans were successful  in the contest, a vigorous move against the slave-holding oligarchy  would at once be made. But it was also significant in the fact that  Lincoln was a western man; it was a sign that the farmers and grangers  of the agricultural west were beginning to wake up politically and throw  themselves into the full current of American State affairs. On both  these grounds, Lincoln's nomination must have been deeply interesting to  Garfield, whose own life had been so closely similar, and who was  destined, twenty years later, to follow him to the same goal.    
Lincoln was duly elected, and the southern states began to secede. The  firing upon Fort Sumter by the South Carolina secessionists was the  first blow struck in that terrible war. Every man who was privileged to  live in America at that time (like the present writer) cannot recall  without a glow of recollection the memory of the wild eagerness with  which the North answered that note of defiance, and went forth with  overpowering faith and eagerness to fight the good fight on behalf of  human freedom. Such a spontaneous outburst of the enthusiasm of humanity  has never been known, before or since. President Lincoln immediately  called for a supply of seventy-five thousand men. In the Ohio Senate,  his message was read amid tumultuous applause; and the moment the sound  of the cheers died away, Garfield, as natural spokesman of the  republican party, sprang to his feet, and moved in a short and  impassioned speech that the state of Ohio should contribute twenty  thousand men and three million dollars as its share in the general  preparations. The motion was immediately carried with the wildest  demonstrations of fervour, and Ohio, with all the rest of the North,  rose like one man to put down by the strong hand the hideous traffic in  human flesh and blood.    
During those fiery and feverish days, every citizen of the loyal states  felt himself to be, in reserve at least, a possible soldier. It was  necessary to raise, drill, and render effective in an incredibly short  time a large army; and it would have been impossible to do so had it not  been for the eager enthusiasm with which civilians of every sort  enlisted, and threw themselves into their military duties with almost  incredible devotion. Garfield felt that he must bear his own part in the  struggle by fighting it out, not in the Senate but on the field; and his  first move was to obtain a large quantity of arms from the arsenal in  the doubtfully loyal state of Missouri. In this mission he was  completely successful; and he was next employed to raise and organize  two new regiments of Ohio infantry. Garfield, of course, knew absolutely  nothing of military matters at that time; but it was not a moment to  stand upon questions of precedence or experience; the born organizers  came naturally to the front, and Garfield was one of them. Indeed, the  faculty for organization seems innate in the American people, so that  when it became necessary to raise and equip so large a body of men at a  few weeks' notice, the task was undertaken offhand by lawyers, doctors,  shopkeepers, and schoolmasters, without a minute's hesitation, and was  performed on the whole with distinguished success.    
When Garfield had organized his regiments, the Governor asked him to  accept the post of colonel to one of them. But Garfield at first  mistrusted his own powers in this direction. How should he, who had  hitherto been poring chiefly over the odes of Horace (his favourite  poet), now take so suddenly to leading a thousand men into actual  battle? He would accept only a subordinate position, he said, if a  regular officer of the United States army, trained at the great military  academy at West Point, was placed in command. So the Governor told him  to go among his own farmer friends in his native district, and recruit a  third regiment, promising to find him a West Point man as colonel, if  one was available. Garfield accepted the post of lieutenant-colonel,  raised the 42nd Ohio regiment, chiefly among his own old pupils at  Hiram, and set off for the seat of operations. At the last moment the  Governor failed to find a regular officer to lead these raw recruits,  every available man being already occupied, and Garfield found himself,  against his will, compelled to undertake the responsible task of  commanding the regiment. He accepted the task thus thrust upon him, and  as if by magic transformed himself at once from a schoolmaster into an  able soldier.    
In less than one month, Colonel Garfield took his raw troops into action  in the battle of Middle Creek, and drove the Confederate General  Marshall, with far larger numbers, out of his intrenchments, compelling  him to retreat into Virginia. This timely victory did much to secure the  northern advance along the line of the Mississippi. During the whole of  the succeeding campaign Garfield handled his regiment with such native  skill and marked success that the Government appointed him Brigadier-  General for his bravery and military talent. In spite of all his early  disadvantages, he had been the youngest member of the Ohio Senate, and  now he was the youngest general in the whole American army.    
Shortly after, the important victory of Chickamauga was gained almost  entirely by the energy and sagacity of General Garfield. For this  service, he was raised one degree in dignity, receiving his commission  as Major-General. He served altogether only two years and three months  in the army.    
But while Garfield was at the head of his victorious troops in Kentucky,  his friends in Ohio were arranging, without his consent or knowledge, to  call him away to a very different sphere of work. They nominated  Garfield as their candidate for the United States House of  Representatives at Washington. The General himself was unwilling to  accede to their request, when it reached him. He thought he could serve  the country better in the field than in Congress. Besides, he was still  a comparatively poor man. His salary as Major-General was double that of  a member of the House; and for his wife's and children's sake he  hesitated to accept the lesser position. Had he continued in the army to  the end of the war, he would doubtless have risen to the very highest  honours of that stirring epoch. But President Lincoln was very anxious  that Garfield should come into the Congress, where his presence would  greatly strengthen the President's hands; and with a generous self-  denial which well bespeaks his thorough loyalty, Garfield gave up his  military post and accepted a place in the House of Representatives. He  took his seat in December, 1863.    
For seventeen years, General Garfield sat in the general legislature of  the United States as one of the members for Ohio. During all that time,  he distinguished himself most honourably as the fearless advocate of  honest government, and the pronounced enemy of those underhand dodges  and wire-pulling machinery which are too often the disgrace of American  politics. He was opposed to all corruption and chicanery, especially to  the bad system of rewarding political supporters with places under  Government, which has long been the chief blot upon American republican  institutions. As a person of stalwart honesty and singleness of purpose,  he made himself respected by both sides alike. Politically speaking,  different men will judge very differently of Garfield's acts in the  House of Representatives. Englishmen especially cannot fail to remark  that his attitude towards ourselves was almost always one of latent  hostility; but it is impossible for anybody to deny that his conduct was  uniformly guided by high principle, and a constant deference to what he  regarded as the right course of action.    
In 1880, when General Garfield had already risen to be the acknowledged  leader of the House of Representatives, his Ohio supporters put him in  nomination for the upper chamber, the Senate. They wished Garfield to  come down to the state capital and canvas for support; but this the  General would not hear of. "I never asked for any place yet," he said,  "except the post of bell-ringer and general sweeper at the Hiram  Institute, and I won't ask for one now." But at least, his friends  urged, he would be on the spot to encourage and confer with his  partisans. No, Garfield answered; if they wished to elect him they must  elect him in his absence; he would avoid all appearance, even, of  angling for office. The result was that all the other candidates  withdrew, and Garfield was elected by acclamation.    
After the election he went down to Ohio and delivered a speech to his  constituents, a part of which strikingly illustrates the courage and  independence of the backwoods schoolmaster. "During the twenty years  that I have been in public life," he said, "almost eighteen of it in the  Congress of the United States, I have tried to do one thing. Whether I  was mistaken or otherwise, it has been the plan of my life to follow my  conviction, at whatever personal cost to myself. I have represented for  many years a district in Congress whose approbation I greatly desired;  but though it may seem, perhaps, a little egotistical to say it, I yet  desired still more the approbation of one person, and his name was  Garfield. He is the only man that I am compelled to sleep with, and eat  with, and live with, and die with; and if I could not have his  approbation I should have bad companionship."    
Only one higher honour could now fall to the lot of a citizen of the  United States. The presidency was the single post to which Garfield's  ambition could still aspire. That honour came upon him, like all the  others, without his seeking; and it came, too, quite unexpectedly. Five  months later, in the summer of 1880, the National Republican Convention  met to select a candidate for their party at the forthcoming  presidential election. Every four years, before the election, each party  thus meets to decide upon the man to whom its votes will be given at the  final choice. After one or two ineffectual attempts to secure unanimity  in favour of other and more prominent politicians, the Convention with  one accord chose James Garfield for its candidate--a nomination which  was quite as great a surprise to Garfield himself as to all the rest of  the world. He was elected President of the United States in November,  1880.    
It was a marvellous rise for the poor canal boy, the struggling student,  the obscure schoolmaster, thus to find himself placed at the head of one  among the greatest nations of the earth. He was still less than fifty,  and he might reasonably have looked forward to many years of a happy,  useful, and honourable life. Nevertheless, it is impossible to feel that  Garfield's death was other than a noble and enviable one. He was cut off  suddenly in the very moment of his brightest success, before the cares  and disappointments of office had begun to dim the pleasure of his first  unexpected triumph. He died a martyr to a good and honest cause, and his  death-bed was cheered and alleviated by the hushed sorrow and sympathy  of an entire nation--one might almost truthfully add, of the whole  civilized world.    
From the first, President Garfield set his face sternly against the bad  practice of rewarding political adherents by allowing them to nominate  officials in the public service--a species of covert corruption  sanctioned by long usage in the United States. This honest and  independent conduct raised up for him at once a host of enemies among  his own party. The talk which they indulged in against the President  produced a deep effect upon a half-crazy and wildly egotistic French-  Canadian of the name of Guiteau, who had emigrated to the States and  become an American citizen. General Garfield had arranged a trip to New  England in the summer of 1881, to attend the annual festival at his old  school, the Williams College, Massachusetts; and for that purpose he  left the White House (the President's official residence at Washington)  on July 2. As he stood in the station of the Baltimore and Potomac  Railway, arm in arm with Mr. Blaine, the Secretary of State, Guiteau  approached him casually, and, drawing out a pistol, fired two shots in  rapid succession, one of which took effect on the President above the  third rib. The assassin was at once secured, and the wounded President  was carried back carefully to the White House.    
Almost everybody who reads this book will remember the long suspense,  while the President lay stretched upon his bed for weeks and weeks  together, with all Europe and America watching anxiously for any sign of  recovery, and sympathizing deeply with the wounded statesman and his  devoted wife. Every effort that was possible was made to save him, but  the wound was past all surgical skill. After lingering long with the  stored-up force of a good constitution, James Garfield passed away at  last of blood-poisoning, more deeply regretted perhaps than any other  man whom the present generation can remember.    
It is only in America that precisely such a success as Garfield's is  possible for people who spring, as he did, from the midst of the people.  In old-settled and wealthy countries we must be content, at best, with  slower and less lofty promotion. But the lesson of Garfield's life is  not for America only, but for the whole world of workers everywhere. The  same qualities which procured his success there will produce a  different, but still a solid success, anywhere else. As Garfield himself  fittingly put it, with his usual keen American common sense, "There is  no more common thought among young people than the foolish one, that by-  and-by something will turn up by which they will suddenly achieve fame  or fortune. No, young gentlemen; things don't turn up in this world  unless somebody turns them up."
