I call it an old town, but it is only relatively old. When one  reflects on the countless centuries that have gone to the  for-mation of this crust of earth on which we temporarily move,  the most ancient cities on its surface seem merely things of the  week before last. It was only the other day, then--that is to  say, in the month of June, 1603--that one Martin Pring, in the  ship Speedwell, an enormous ship of nearly fifty tons burden,  from Bristol, England, sailed up the Piscataqua River. The  Speedwell, numbering thirty men, officers and crew, had for  consort the Discoverer, of twenty-six tons and thirteen men.  After following the windings of "the brave river" for twelve  miles or more, the two vessels turned back and put to sea again,  having failed in the chief object of the expedition, which was to  obtain a cargo of the medicinal sassafras-tree, from the bark of  which, as well known to our ancestors, could be distilled the  Elixir of Life.    
It was at some point on the left bank of the Piscataqua, three or  four miles from the mouth of the river, that worthy Master Pring  probably effected one of his several landings. The beautiful  stream widens suddenly at this place, and the green banks, then  covered with a network of strawberry vines, and sloping  invitingly to the lip of the crystal water, must have won the  tired mariners.    
The explorers found themselves on the edge of a vast forest of  oak, hemlock, maple, and pine; but they saw no sassafras-trees to  speak of, nor did they encounter--what would have been infinitely  less to their taste--and red-men. Here and there were  discoverable the scattered ashes of fires where the Indians had  encamped earlier in the spring; they were absent now, at the  silvery falls, higher up the stream, where fish abounded at that  season. The soft June breeze, laden with the delicate breath of  wild-flowers and the pungent odors of spruce and pine, ruffled  the duplicate sky in the water; the new leaves lisped pleasantly  in the tree tops, and the birds were singing as if they had gone  mad. No ruder sound or movement of life disturbed the primeval  solitude. Master Pring would scarcely recognize the spot were he  to land there to-day.    
Eleven years afterwards a much cleverer man than the commander of  the Speedwell dropped anchor in the Piscataqua--Captain John  Smith of famous memory. After slaying Turks in hand-to-hand  combats, and doing all sorts of doughty deeds wherever he chanced  to decorate the globe with his presence, he had come with two  vessels to the fisheries on the rocky selvage of Maine, when  curiosity, or perhaps a deeper motive, led him to examine the  neighboring shore lines. With eight of his men in a small boat,  a ship's yawl, he skirted the coast from Penobscot Bay to Cape  Cod, keeping his eye open. This keeping his eye open was a  peculiarity of the little captain; possibly a family trait. It  was Smith who really discovered the Isles of Shoals, exploring in  person those masses of bleached rock--those "isles assez hautes,"  of which the French navigator Pierre de Guast, Sieur de Monts,  had caught a bird's-eye glimpse through the twilight in 1605.  Captain Smith christened the group Smith's Isles, a title which  posterity, with singular persistence of ingratitude, has ignored.  It was a tardy sense of justice that expressed itself a few years  ago in erecting on Star Island a simple marble shaft to the  memory of JOHN SMITH--the multitudinous! Perhaps this long delay  is explained by a natural hesitation to label a monument so  ambiguously.    
The modern Jason, meanwhile, was not without honor in his own  country, whatever may have happened to him in his own house, for  the poet George Wither addressed a copy of pompous verses "To his  Friend Captain Smith, upon his Description of New England.""Sir,"  he says--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>  "Sir: your Relations I haue read: which shew <br> Ther's reason I should honor them and you: <br> And if their meaning I have vnderstood, <br> I dare to censure thus: Your Project's good; <br> And may (if follow'd) doubtlesse quit the paine <br> With honour, pleasure and a trebble gaine; <br> Beside the benefit that shall arise <br> To make more happy our Posterities."</small></i></blockquote><br>
The earliest map of this portion of our seaboard was prepared by  Smith and laid before Prince Charles, who asked to give the  country a name. He christened it New England. In that remarkable  map the site of Portsmouth is call Hull, and Kittery and York are  known as Boston.    
It was doubtless owing to Captain John Smith's representation on  his return to England that the Laconia Company selected the banks  of the Piscataqua for their plantation. Smith was on an intimate  footing with Sir Ferinand Gorges, who, five years subsequently,  made a tour of inspection along the New England coast, in company  with John Mason, then Governor of Newfoundland. One of the  results of this summer cruise is the town of Portsmouth, among  whose leafy ways, and into some of whose old-fashioned houses, I  purpose to take the reader, if he have an idle hour on his hands.  Should we meet the flitting ghost of some old-time worthy, on the  staircase or at a lonely street corner, the reader must be  prepared for it.
