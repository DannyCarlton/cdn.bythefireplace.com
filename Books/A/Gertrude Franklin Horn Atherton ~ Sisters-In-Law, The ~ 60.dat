The day was fine and Alexina took advantage of the brief interval of grace  and went for a walk. Gathbroke was in Paris but might come out any moment.  She wore a coat and skirt of heavy white English tweed with a silk blouse  of periwinkle blue. The same soft shade lined her black velvet hat.    
She had a number of notes changed at the bank and struck out for one of the  ruined villages. She was in a mood to distribute happiness, and only silver  coin could carry a ray of light into the dark stupefied recesses of those  miserable wretches living in the ruins of homes haunted by memories of  their dead.    
She felt a very torch of happiness herself. Her body and her brain glowed  with it. The currents of her blood seemed to have changed their pace and  their essence. The elixir of life was in them. She felt less woman than  goddess.    
She knew now why she had been born, why she had waited. As long as this  terrible war had to be she was thankful for her intimate contact with the  very martyrdom of suffering; never else could she have known to the full  the value of life and youth and health and the power to be triumphantly  happy in love. She would have liked to wave a wand and make all the world  happy, but as this was as little possible as to remake human nature itself  she soared into an ether of her own to revel in her astounding good  fortune.

The village she approached was picturesque in its ruin for it climbed the  side of a hill, and although the Germans had set fire deliberately to every  house the shells for the most part remained. Along the low ridge was a row  of brick walls in various stages of gaunt and jagged transfiguration. They  looked less the victims of fire than of earthquake.    
The narrow ascending street was filled with rubble. She picked her way and  peered into the ruins. At first she saw no one; the place seemed to be  deserted. Then some one moved in a dark cellar, and as she stood at the top  of the short flight of steps a very old woman came forward into the light.  There were two children at her heels.    
Alexina suddenly felt very awkward. She had always thought the mere handing  out of money the most detestable part of charity. But there was nothing  here to buy. That was obvious.    
The old woman however relieved her embarrassment. She extended a skinny  hand. The poor of France are not loquacious, but like all their compatriots  they know what they want, and no doubt feel that life is simplified when  they are in a position to ask for it.    
Alexina gratefully handed her a coin and hurried on. Her next experience  was as simple but more delicate. A younger woman had fitted up a corner of  her ruin with a petticoat for roof and a plank supported by two piles of  brick for counter and had laid in a supply of the post cards that pictured  with terrible fidelity the ruins of her village. Alexina bought the entire  stock, "to scatter broadcast in the United States," and promised to send  her friends for more; assuring the woman that when the tourists came to  France once more these ruined villages would be magnets for gold.    
She managed to get rid of her coins without much difficulty, although  comparatively few of the village's inhabitants had returned, and these by  stealth. Many of them had trekked far! Others were still detained at the  hostels in Paris and other cities where they could be looked after without  too much trouble.    
Several had set up housekeeping in the cellars in a fashion not unlike that  of their cave dwelling ancestors, and a few had found a piece of roof above  ground to huddle under when it rained. Some talked to her pleasantly, some  were surly, others unutterably sad. None refused her largesse, and she was  amused to look back and see a little procession making for the town, no  doubt with intent to purchase.    
In one side street less choked with rubbish small boys were playing at war.  But for the most part the children looked very sober. They had been spared  the horrors of occupation but they had suffered privations and been  surrounded by grief and despair.

When she had exhausted her supplies she took refuge in the church. It was  at the end of the long street on the ridge and after she had rested she  could leave the village by its farther end, and by making a long detour  avoid the painful necessity of refusing alms.    
There was no roof on the church; otherwise it would have been the general  refuge. Part of it including the steeple was some distance away and looked  as if it had been blown off. The rest had gone down with one of the walls.  It was a charred unlovely ruin. Saints and virgins sometimes defied the  worst that war could do, but all had succumbed here. The paneless windows  in the walls that still remained precariously erect framed pictures of a  quiet and lovely landscape. The stone walls were intact about the farms in  which moved a few old men and women in faded cotton frocks that looked like  soft pastels. The oaks were majestic and serene. The hills were lavender in  the distance. But the farm houses were in ruins and so was a chateau on  a hill. Alexina could see its black gaping walls through the grove of  chestnut trees withered by the fire.    
She wandered about looking for a seat however humble but could find nothing  more inviting than piles of brick and twisted iron. She noticed an open  place in the floor and went over to it and peered down. There was a flight  of steps ending in cimmerian darkness. Doubtless the vaults of the great  families of the neighborhood were down there. She wondered if the spite of  the Huns had driven them to demolish the very bones of the race they were  unable to conquer.

Suddenly she stiffened. A chill ran up her spine. She had an overwhelming  sense of impending danger and stepped swiftly away from the edge of the  aperture; then turned about, and faced Gora Dwight.
