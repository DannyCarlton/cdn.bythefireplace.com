  Afterward Carrigan wondered to what depths he had fallen in the   first moments of his disillusionment. Something like shock,  perhaps  even more than that, must have betrayed itself in his  face. He did not  speak. Slowly his outstretched arm dropped to the  white counterpane.  Later he called himself a fool for allowing it  to happen, for it was  as if he had measured his proffered  friendship by what its future  might hold for him. In a low, quiet  voice Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain  was saying again that she was St.  Pierre's wife. She was not excited,  yet he understood now why it  was he had thought her eyes were very  dark. They had changed  swiftly. The violet freckles in them were like  little flecks of  gold. They were almost liquid in their glow, neither  brown nor  black now, and with that threat of gathering lightning in  them.  For the first time he saw the slightest flush of color in her   cheeks. It deepened even as he held out his hand again. He knew  that  it was not embarrassment. It was the heat of the fire back of  her  eyes. &quot;It's&#8212;funny,&quot; he said, making an effort to redeem  himself with  a lie and smiling. &quot;You rather amaze me. You see, I  have been told  this St. Pierre is an old, old man&#8212;so old that he  can't stand on his  feet or go with his brigades, and if that is  the truth, it is hard for  me to picture you as his wife. But that  isn't a reason why we should  not be friends. Is it?&quot; 
  He felt that he was himself again, except for the three days'   growth of beard on his face. He tried to laugh, but it was rather  a  poor attempt. And St. Pierre's wife did not seem to hear him.  She was  looking at him, looking into and through him with those  wide-open  glowing eyes. Then she sat down, out of reach of the  hand which he had  held toward her. 
  &quot;You are a sergeant of the police,&quot; she said, the softness gone   suddenly out of her voice. &quot;You are an honorable man, m'sieu. Your   hand is against all wrong. Is it not so?&quot; It was the voice of an   inquisitor. She was demanding an answer of him. 
  He nodded. &quot;Yes, it is so.&quot; 
  The fire in her eyes deepened. &quot;And yet you say you want to be the   friend of a stranger who has tried to kill you. WHY, m'sieu?&quot; 
  He was cornered. He sensed the humiliation of it, the   impossibility of confessing to her the wild impulse that had moved   him before he knew she was St. Pierre's wife. And she did not wait   for him to answer. 
  &quot;This&#8212;this Roger Audemard&#8212;if you catch him&#8212;what will you do   with him?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;He will be hanged,&quot; said David. &quot;He is a murderer.&quot; 
  &quot;And one who tries to kill&#8212;who almost succeeds&#8212;what is the   penalty for that?&quot; She leaned toward him, waiting. Her hands were   clasped tightly in her lap, the spots were brighter in her cheeks. 
  &quot;From ten to twenty years,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;But, of course,   there may be circumstances&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;If so, you do not know them,&quot; she interrupted him. &quot;You say Roger   Audemard is a murderer. You know I tried to kill you. Then why is  it  you would be my friend and Roger Audemard's enemy? Why,  m'sieu?&quot; 
  Carrigan shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. &quot;I shouldn't,&quot; he   confessed. &quot;I guess you are proving I was wrong in what I said. I   ought to arrest you and take you back to the Landing as soon as I   can. But, you see, it strikes me there is a big personal element  in  this. I was the man almost killed. There was a mistake,&#8212;must  have  been, for as soon as you put me out of business you began  nursing me  back to life again. And&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;But that doesn't change it,&quot; insisted St. Pierre's wife. &quot;If   there had been no mistake, there would have been a murder. Do you   understand, m'sieu? If it had been some one else behind that rock,  I  am quite certain he would have died. The Law, at least, would  have  called it murder. If Roger Audemard is a criminal, then I  also am a  criminal. And an honorable man would not make a  distinction because  one of them is a woman!&quot; 
  &quot;But&#8212;Black Roger was a fiend. He deserves no mercy. He&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps, m'sieu!&quot; 
  She was on her feet, her eyes flaming down upon him. In that   moment her beauty was like the beauty of Carmin Fanchet. The poise  of  her slender body, her glowing cheeks, her lustrous hair, her   gold-flecked eyes with the light of diamonds in them, held him   speechless. 
  &quot;I was sorry and went back for you,&quot; she said. &quot;I wanted you to   live, after I saw you like that on the sand. Bateese says I was   indiscreet, that I should have left you there to die. Perhaps he  is  right. And yet&#8212;even Roger Audemard might have had that pity  for you.&quot; 
  She turned quickly, and he heard her moving away from him. Then,   from the door, she said, 
  &quot;Bateese will make you comfortable, m'sieu.&quot; 
  The door opened and closed. She was gone. And he was alone in the   cabin again. 
  The swiftness of the change in her amazed him. It was as if he had   suddenly touched fire to an explosive. There had been the flare,  but  no violence. She had not raised her voice, yet he heard in it  the  tremble of an emotion that was consuming her. He had seen the  flame of  it in her face and eyes. Something he had said, or had  done, had  tremendously upset her, changing in an instant her  attitude toward  him. The thought that came to him made his face  burn under its scrub  of beard. Did she think he was a scoundrel?  The dropping of his hand,  the shock that must have betrayed itself  in his face when she said she  was St. Pierre's wife&#8212;had those  things warned her against him? The  heat went slowly out of his  face. It was impossible. She could not  think that of him. It must  have been a sudden giving way under  terrific strain. She had  compared herself to Roger Audemard, and she  was beginning to  realize her peril&#8212;that Bateese was right&#8212;that she  should have  left him to die in the sand! 
  The thought pressed itself heavily upon Carrigan. It brought him   suddenly back to a realization of how small a part he had played  in  this last half hour in the cabin. He had offered to Pierre's  wife a  friendship which he had no right to offer and which she  knew he had no  right to offer. He was the Law. And she, like Roger  Audemard, was a  criminal. Her quick woman's instinct had told her  there could be no  distinction between them, unless there was a  reason. And now Carrigan  confessed to himself that there had been  a reason. That reason had  come to him with the first glimpse of  her as he lay in the hot sand.  He had fought against it in the  canoe; it had mastered him in those  thrilling moments when he had  beheld this slim, beautiful creature  riding fearlessly into the  boiling waters of the Holy Ghost. Her eyes,  her hair, the sweet,  low voice that had been with him in his fever,  had become a  definite and unalterable part of him. And this must have  shown in  his eyes and face when he dropped his hand&#8212;when she told him  she  was St. Pierre's wife. 
  And now she was afraid of him! She was regretting that she had not   left him to die. She had misunderstood what she had seen betraying   itself during those few seconds of his proffered friendship. She  saw  only a man whom she had nearly killed, a man who represented  the Law,  a man whose power held her in the hollow of his hand. And  she had  stepped back from him, startled, and had told him that she  was not St.  Pierre's daughter, but his wife! 
  In the science of criminal analysis Carrigan always placed himself   in the position of the other man. And he was beginning to see the   present situation from the view-point of Jeanne Marie-Anne  Boulain.  He was satisfied that she had made a desperate mistake  and that until  the last moment she had believed it was another man  behind the rock.  Yet she had shown no inclination to explain away  her error. She had  definitely refused to make an explanation. And  it was simply a matter  of common sense to concede that there must  be a powerful motive for  her refusal. There was but one conclusion  for him to arrive at&#8212;the  error which St. Pierre's wife had made  in shooting the wrong man was  less important to her than keeping  the secret of why she had wanted to  kill some other man. 
  David was not unconscious of the breach in his own armor. He had   weakened, just as the Superintendent of &quot;N&quot; Division had weakened   that day four years ago when they had almost quarreled over Carmin   Fanchet. 
  &quot;I'll swear to Heaven she isn't bad, no matter what her brother   has been,&quot; McVane had said. &quot;I'll gamble my life on that,  Carrigan!&quot; 
  And because the Chief of Division with sixty years of experience   behind him, had believed that, Carmin Fanchet had not been held as  an  accomplice in her brother's evildoing, but had gone back into  her  wilderness uncrucified by the law that had demanded the life  of her  brother. He would never forget the last time he had seen  Carmin  Fanchet's eyes&#8212;great, black, glorious pools of gratitude  as they  looked at grizzled old McVane; blazing fires of venomous  hatred when  they turned on him. And he had said to McVane, 
  &quot;The man pays, the woman goes&#8212;justice indeed is blind!&quot; 
  McVane, not being a stickler on regulations when it came to   Carrigan, had made no answer. 
  The incident came back vividly to David as he waited for the   promised coming of Bateese. He began to appreciate McVane's point  of  view, and it was comforting, because he realized that his own  logic  was assailable. If McVane had been comparing the two women  now, he  knew what his argument would be. There had been no  absolute proof of  crime against Carmin Fanchet, unless to fight  desperately for the life  of her brother was a crime. In the case  of Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain  there was proof. She had tried to  kill. Therefore, of the two, Carmin  Fanchet would have been the  better woman in the eyes of McVane. 
  In spite of the legal force of the argument which he was bringing   against himself, David felt unconvinced. Carmin Fanchet, had she  been  in the place of St. Pierre's wife, would have finished him  there in  the sand. She would have realized the menace of letting  him live and  would probably have commanded Bateese to dump him in  the river. St.  Pierre's wife had gone to the other extreme. She  was not only  repentant, but was making restitution, for her  mistake, and in making  that restitution had crossed far beyond the  dead-line of caution. She  had frankly told him who she was; she  had brought him into the privacy  of what was undeniably her own  home; in her desire to undo what she  had done she had hopelessly  enmeshed herself in the net of the Law&#8212;if  that Law saw fit to  act. She had done these things with courage and  conviction. And of  such a woman, Carrigan thought, St. Pierre must be  very proud. 
  He looked slowly about the cabin again and each thing that he saw   was a living voice breaking up a dream for him. These voices told  him  that he was in a temple built because of a man's worship for a   woman&#8212;and that man was St. Pierre. Through the two western  windows  came the last glow of the western sun, like a golden  benediction  finding its way into a sacred place. Here there was&#8212;  or had been&#8212;a  great happiness, for only a great pride and a great  happiness could  have made it as it was. Nothing that wealth and  toil could drag up out  of a civilization a thousand miles away had  been too good for St.  Pierre's wife. And about him, looking more  closely, David saw the  undisturbed evidences of a woman's  contentment. On the table were  embroidery materials with which she  had been working, and a lamp-shade  half finished. A woman's  magazine printed in a city four thousand  miles away lay open at  the fashion plates. There were other magazines,  and many books,  and open music above the white keyboard of the piano,  and vases  glowing red and yellow with wild-flowers and silver birch  leaves.  He could smell the faint perfume of the fireglow blossoms, red  as  blood. In a pool of sunlight on one of the big white bear rugs lay   the sleeping cat. And then, at the far end of the cabin, an ivory-   white Cross of Christ glowed for a few moments in a last homage of   the sinking sun. 
  Uneasiness stole upon him. This was the woman's holy ground, her   sanctuary and her home, and for three days his presence had driven   her from it. There was no other room. In making restitution she  had  given up to him her most sacred of all things. And again there  rose up  in him that new-born thing which had set strange fires  stirring in his  heart, and which from this hour on he knew he must  fight until it was  dead. 
  For an hour after the last of the sun was obirterated by the   western mountains he lay in the gloom of coming darkness. Only the   lapping of water under the bateau broke the strange stillness of  the  evening. He heard no sound of life, no voice, no tread of  feet, and he  wondered where the woman and her men had gone and if  the scow was  still tied up at the edge of the tar-sands. And for  the first time he  asked himself another question, Where was the  man, St. Pierref
