Who is Lydia, pray, and who<br> Is Hypatia? Softly, dear,<br> Let me breathe it in your ear--<br> They are you, and only you.<br> And those other nameless two<br> Walking in Arcadian air--<br> She that was so very fair?<br> She that had the twilight hair?--<br> They were you, dear, only you.<br> If I speak of night or day,<br> Grace of fern or bloom of grape,<br> Hanging cloud or fountain spray,<br> Gem or star or glistening dew,<br> Or of mythologic shape,<br> Psyche, Pyrrha, Daphne, say--<br> I mean you, dear, you, just you.
