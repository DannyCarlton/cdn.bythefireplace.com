  Harry, when the dawn had fully come, was sent farther away toward  the ford to see if the remainder of the troops had passed, and, when he  returned with the welcome news, the rain had ceased to fall. The army  was rapidly drying itself in the brilliant sunshine, and marched  leisurely on. He felt an immense relief. He knew that a great crisis  had been passed, and, if the Northern armies ever reached Richmond, it  would be a long and sanguinary road. Meade might get across and attack,  but his advantage was gone.
  The same spirit of relief pervaded the ranks, and the men sang their  battle songs. There had been some fighting at one or two of the fords,  but it did not amount to much, and no enemy hung on their rear. But no  stop was made by the staff until noon, when a fire was made and food  was cooked. Then Harry was notified that he and Dalton were to start  that night with dispatches for Richmond. They were to ride through  dangerous country, until they reached a point on the railroad, wholly  within the Southern lines, when they would take a train for the  Confederate capital.
  They were glad to go. They felt sure that no great battles would be  fought while they were gone. Neither army seemed to be in a mood for  further fighting just yet, and they longed for a sight of the little  city that was the heart of the Confederacy. They were tired of the  rifle and march, of cannon and battles. They wished to be a while where  civilized life went on, to hear the bells of churches and to see the  faces of women.
  It seemed to them both that they had lived almost all their lives in  war. Even Jeb Stuart's ball, stopped by the opening guns of a great  battle, was far, far away, and to Harry, it was at least a century  since he had closed his Tacitus in the Pendleton Academy, and put it  away in his desk. That old Roman had written something of battles, but  they were no such struggles as Chancellorsville and Gettysburg had  been. The legions, he admitted in his youthful pride, could fight well,  but they never could have beaten Yank or Reb.
  He and Dalton slept through the afternoon and directly after dark,  well equipped and well-armed, they made their start into the South. But  in going they did not neglect to pass the camp of the Invincibles who  were now in the apex of the army farthest south. They had found an  unusually comfortable place on a grassy plot beside a fine, cool  spring, and most of them were lying down. But Colonel Talbot and  Lieutenant- Colonel Hector St. Hilaire sat on empty kegs, with a board  on an empty box between them. The great game which ran along with the  war had been renewed. St. Clair and Langdon sat on the grass beside  them, watching the contest.
  The two colonels looked up at the sound of hoofs and paused a  moment.
  &#8220;I'm getting his king into a close corner, Harry,&#8221; said Colonel  Talbot, &#8220;and he'll need a lot of time for thinking. Where are you two  going, or perhaps I shouldn't ask you such a question?&#8221;
  &#8220;There's no secret about it,&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;We're going to  Richmond with dispatches.&#8221;
  &#8220;He was incorrect in saying that he was getting my king into a close  corner, as I'll presently show him,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel St.  Hilaire; &#8220;but you boys are lucky. I suppose you'll stay a while in the  capital. You'll sleep in white beds, you'll eat at tables, with  tablecloths on 'em. You'll hear the soft voices of the women and girls  of the South, God bless 'em!&#8221;
  &#8220;And if you went on to Charleston you'd find just as fine women  there,&#8221; said Colonel Leonidas Talbot.
  He sighed and a shade of sadness crossed his face. Harry heard and  saw and understood. He remembered a night long, long ago in that heat  of rebellion, when he had looked down from the window of his room, and,  in the dark, had seen two figures, a man and a woman, upon a piazza,  Colonel Talbot and Madame Delaunay, talking softly together. He had  felt then that he was touching almost unconsciously upon the thread of  an old romance. A thread slender and delicate, but yet strong enough in  its very tenderness and delicacy to hold them both. The perfume of the  flowers and of the old romance that night in the town so far away came  back. He was moved, and when his eyes met Colonel Talbot's some kind of  an understanding passed between them.
  &#8220;The good are never rewarded,&#8221; said Happy Tom.
  &#8220;How so?&#8221; asked Harry.
  &#8220;Because the proof of it sits on his horse here before us. Why  should a man like George Dalton be sent to Richmond? A sour Puritan who  does not know how to enjoy a dance or anything else, who looks upon the  beautiful face of a girl as a sin and an abomination, who thinks to be  ugly is to be good, who is by temperament and education unfit to enjoy  anything, while Thomas Langdon, who by the same measurements is fit to  enjoy everything, is left here to hold back the Army of the Potomac.  It's undoubtedly a tribute to my valor, but I don't like it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thomas,&#8221; said Colonel Leonidas Talbot, gravely, &#8220;you're entirely  too severe with our worthy young friend, Dalton. The bubbles of  pleasure always lie beneath austere and solemn exteriors like his,  seeking to break a way to the surface. The longer the process is  delayed the more numerous the bubbles are and the greater they expand.  If scandalous reports concerning a certain young man in Richmond should  reach us here in the North, relating his unparalleled exploits in the  giddier circles of our gay capital, I should know without the telling  that it was our prim young George Dalton.&#8221;
  &#8220;You never spoke truer words, Leonidas,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel  Hector St. Hilaire. &#8220;A little judicious gallantry in youth is good for  any one. It keeps the temperature from going too high. I recall now the  case of Auguste Champigny, who owned an estate in Louisiana, near the  Louisiana estate of the St. Hilaires, and the estates of those cousins  of mine whom I visited, as I told you once.
  &#8220;But pardon me. I digress, and to digress is to grow old, so I will  not digress, but remain young, in heart at least. I go back now. I was  speaking of Auguste Champigny, who in youth thought only of making  money and of making his plantation, already great, many times greater.  The blood in his veins was old at twenty-two. He did not love the vices  that the world calls such. But yet there were times, I knew, when he  would have longed to go with the young, because youth cannot be crushed  wholly at twenty-two. There was no escape of the spirits, no wholesome  blood-letting, so to speak, and that which was within him became  corrupt. He acquired riches and more riches, and land and more land,  and at fifty he went to New Orleans, and sought the places where  pleasures abound. But his true blossoming time had passed. The blood in  his veins now became poison. He did the things that twenty should do,  and left undone the things that fifty should do. Ah! Harry, one of the  saddest things in life is the dissipated boy of fifty! He should have  come with us when the first blood of youth was upon him. He could have  found time then for play as well as work. He could have rowed with us  in the slender boats on the river and bayous with Mimi and Rosalie and  Marianne and all those other bright and happy ones. He could have  danced, too. It was no strain, we never danced longer than two days and  two nights without stopping, and the festivals, the gay fete days, not  more than one a week! But it was not Auguste's way. A man when he  should have been a boy, and then, alas! a boy when he should have been  a man!&#8221;
  &#8220;You speak true words, Hector,&#8221; said Colonel Leonidas Talbot,  &#8220;though at times you seem to me to be rather sentimental. Youth is  youth and it has the pleasures of youth. It is not fitting that a man  should be a boy, but middle-age has pleasures of its own and they are  more solid, perhaps more satisfying than those of youth. I can't  conceive of twenty getting the pleasure out of the noble game of chess  that we do. The most brilliant of your young French Creole dancers  never felt the thrill that I feel when the last move is made and I beat  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then if you expect to experience that thrill, Leonidas, continue  the pursuit of my king, from which you expect so much, and see what  will happen to you.&#8221;
  Colonel Talbot looked keenly at the board, and alarm appeared on his  face. He made a rapid retreat with one of his pieces, and Harry and  Dalton, knowing that it was time for them to go, reached down from  their saddles, shook hands with both, then with St. Clair and Happy  Tom, and were soon beyond the bounds of the camp.
  They rode on for many hours in silence. They were in a friendly land  now, but they knew that it was well to be careful, as Federal scouts  and cavalry nevertheless might be encountered at any moment. Two or  three times they turned aside from the road to let detachments of  horsemen pass. They could not tell in the dark and from their hiding  places to which army they belonged, and they were not willing to take  the delay necessary to find out. They merely let them ride by and  resumed their own place on the road.
  Harry told Dalton many more details of his perilous journey from the  river to the camp of the commander-in-chief, and he spoke particularly  of Shepard.
  &#8220;Although he's a spy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I feel that the word scarcely fits  him, he's so much greater than the ordinary spy. That man is worth more  than a brigade of veterans to the North. He's as brave as a lion, and  his craft and cunning are almost superhuman.&#8221;
  He did not tell that he might easily have put Shepard forever out of  the way, but that his heart had failed him. Yet he did not feel remorse  nor any sense of treachery to his cause. He would do the same were the  same chance to come again. But it seemed to him now that a duel had  begun between Shepard and himself. They had been drifting into it,  either through chance or fate, for a long time. He knew that he had a  most formidable antagonist, but he felt a certain elation in matching  himself against one so strong.
  They rode all night and the next day across the strip of Maryland  into Virginia and once more were among their own people, their  undoubted own. They were now entering the Valley of Virginia where the  great Jackson had leaped into fame, and both Harry and Dalton felt  their hearts warm at the greetings they received. Both armies had  marched over the valley again and again. It was torn and scarred by  battle, and it was destined to be torn and scarred many times more, but  its loyalty to the South stood every test. This too was the region in  which many of the great Virginia leaders were born, and it rejoiced in  the valor of its sons.
  Food and refreshment were offered everywhere to the two young  horsemen, and the women and the old men&#8212;not many young men were  left&#8212;wanted to hear of Gettysburg. They would not accept it as a  defeat. It was merely a delay, they said. General Lee would march North  once more next year. Harry knew in his heart that the South would never  invade again, that the war would be for her henceforth a purely  defensive one, but he said nothing. He could not discourage people who  were so sanguine.
  Every foot of the way now brought back memories of Jackson. He saw  many familiar places, fields of battle, sites of camps, lines of  advance or retreat, and his heart grew sad within him, because one whom  he admired so much, and for whom he had such a strong affection, was  gone forever, gone when he was needed most. He saw again with all the  vividness of reality that terrible night at Chancellorsville, when the  wounded Jackson lay in the road, his young officers covering his body  with their own to protect him from the shells.
  When they reached the strip of railroad entering Richmond they left  their horses to be sent later, and each took a full seat in the short  train, where he could loosen his belt, and stretch his limbs. It was a  crude coach, by the standards of to-day, but it was a luxury then.  Harry and Dalton enjoyed it, after so much riding horseback, and  watched the pleasant landscape, brown now from the July sun, flow past.
  Their coach did not contain many passengers, several wounded  officers going to Richmond on furlough, some countrymen, carrying  provisions to the capital for sale, and a small, thin, elderly woman in  a black dress, to whom Harry assigned the part of an old maid. He  noticed that her features were fine and she had the appearance of one  who had suffered. When they reached Richmond and their passes were  examined, he hastened to carry her bag for her and to help her off the  train. She thanked him with a smile that made her almost handsome, and  quickly disappeared in the streets of the city.
  &#8220;A nice looking old maid,&#8221; he said to Dalton.
  &#8220;How do you know she's an old maid?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know. I suppose it's a certain primness of manner.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can't judge by appearances. Like as not she's been married  thirty years, and it's possible that she may have a family of at least  twelve children.&#8221;
  &#8220;At any rate, we'll never know. But it's good, George, to be here in  Richmond again. It's actually a luxury to see streets and shop windows,  and people in civilian clothing, going about their business.&#8221;
  &#8220;Looks the same way to me, Harry, but we can't delay. We must be off  to the President, with the dispatches from the Army of Northern  Virginia.&#8221;
  But they did not hurry greatly. They were young and it had been a  long time since they had been in a city of forty thousand inhabitants,  where the shop windows were brilliant to them and nobody on the streets  was shooting at anybody else. It was late July, the great heats were  gone for the time at least, and they were brisk and elated. They paused  a little while in Capitol Square, and looked at the Bell Tower, rising  like a spire, from the crest of which alarms were rung, then at the  fine structure of St. Paul's Church. They intended to go into the State  House now used as the Confederate Capitol, but that must wait until  they reported to President Davis.
  They arrived at the modest building called the White House of the  Confederacy, and, after a short wait in the anteroom, they were  received by the President. They saw a tall, rather spare man, dressed  in a suit of home-knit gray. He received them without either warmth or  coldness. Harry, although it was not the first time he had seen him,  looked at him with intense curiosity. Davis, like Lincoln, was born in  his own State, Kentucky, but like most other Kentuckians, he did not  feel any enthusiasm over the President of the Confederacy. There was no  magnetism. He felt the presence of intellect, but there was no  inspiration in that arid presence.
  A man of Oriental features was sitting near with a great bunch of  papers in his hand. Mr. Davis did not introduce Harry and Dalton to  him, and he remained silent while the President was asking questions of  the messengers. But Harry watched him when he had a chance, interested  strongly in that shrewd, able, Eastern face, the descendant of an  immemorial and intellectual race, the man who while Secretary of State  was trying also to help carry the tremendous burden of Confederate  finance. What was he thinking, as Harry and Dalton answered the  President's questions about the Army of Northern Virginia?
  &#8220;You say that you left immediately after our army crossed the  Potomac?&#8221; asked the President.
  &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;General Meade could have attacked, but  he remained nearly two days on our front without attempting to do so.&#8221;
  A thin gray smile flitted over the face of the President of the  Confederacy.
  &#8220;General Meade was not beaten at Gettysburg, but I fancy he  remembered it well enough.&#8221;
  Harry glanced at Benjamin, but his Oriental face was inscrutable.  The lad wondered what was lurking at the back of that strong brain. He  was shrewd enough himself to know that it was not always the generals  on the battlefield who best understood the condition of a state at war,  and often the man who held the purse was the one who measured it best  of all. But Benjamin never said a word, nor did the expression of his  face change a particle.
  &#8220;The Army of Northern Virginia is safe,&#8221; said the President, &#8220;and it  will be able to repel all invasion of Virginia. General Lee gives  especial mention of both of you in his letters, and you are not to  return to him at once. You are to remain here a while on furlough, and  if you will go to General Winder he will assign you to quarters.&#8221;
  Both Harry and Dalton were delighted, and, although thanks were  really due to General Lee, they thanked the President, who smiled  dryly. Then they saluted and withdrew, the President and the Secretary  of State going at once into earnest consultation over the papers Mr.  Benjamin had brought.
  Harry felt that he had left an atmosphere of depression and said so,  when they were outside in the bright sunshine.
  &#8220;If you were trying to carry as much as Mr. Davis is carrying you'd  be depressed too,&#8221; said Dalton.
  &#8220;Maybe so, but let's forget it. We've got nothing to do for a few  days but enjoy ourselves. General Winder is to give us quarters, but  we're not to be under his command. What say you to a little trip  through the capitol?&#8221;
  &#8220;Good enough.&#8221;
  Congress had adjourned for the day, but they went through the  building, admiring particularly the Houdon Washington, and then  strolled again through the streets, which were so interesting and novel  to them. Richmond was never gayer and brighter. They were sure that the  hated Yankees could never come. For more than two years the Army of  Northern Virginia had been an insuperable bar to their advance, and it  would continue so.
  Harry suddenly lifted his cap as some one passed swiftly, and Dalton  glancing backward saw a small vanishing figure.
  &#8220;Who was it?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;The thin little old maid in black whom we saw on the train. She may  have nodded to me when I bowed, but it was such a little nod that I'm  not certain.&#8221;
  &#8220;I rather like your being polite to an insignificant old maid,  Harry. I'd expect you, as a matter of course, to be polite to a young  and pretty girl, overpolite probably.&#8221;
  &#8220;That'll do, George Dalton. I like you best when you're preaching  least. Come, let's go into the hotel and hear what they're talking  about.&#8221;
  After the custom of the times a large crowd was gathered in the  spacious lobby of Richmond's chief hotel. Among them were the local  celebrities in other things than war, Daniel, Bagby, Pegram, Randolph,  and a half-dozen more, musicians, artists, poets, orators and wits.  People were quite democratic, and Harry and Dalton were free to draw  their chairs near the edge of the group and listen. Pegram, the  humorist, gave them a glance of approval, when he noticed their  uniforms, the deep tan of their faces, their honest eyes and their  compact, strong figures.
  Harry soon learned that a large number of English and French  newspapers had been brought by a blockade runner to Wilmington, North  Carolina, and had just reached the capital, the news of which these men  were discussing with eagerness.
  &#8220;We learn that the sympathies of both the French and English  governments are still with us,&#8221; said Randolph.
  &#8220;But these papers were all printed before the news of Vicksburg and  Gettysburg had crossed the Atlantic,&#8221; said Daniel.
  &#8220;England is for us,&#8221; said Pegram, &#8220;only because she likes us little  and the North less. The French Imperialists, too, hate republics, and  are in for anything that will damage them. When we beat off the North,  until she's had enough, and set up our own free and independent  republic, we'll have both England and France annoying us, and demanding  favors, because they were for us in the war. Sympathy is something, but  it doesn't win any battles.&#8221;
  &#8220;A nation has no real friend except itself,&#8221; said Bagby. &#8220;Whatever  the South gets she'll have to get with her own good right arm.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can predict the first great measure to be put through by the  Southern Government after the war.&#8221;
  &#8220;What will it be?&#8221;
  &#8220;The abolition of slavery.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, that's one of the things we're fighting to maintain!&#8221;
  &#8220;Exactly so. You're willing to throw away a thing of your own  accord, when you're not willing to throw it away because another orders  you to do so. Wars are due chiefly to our misunderstanding of human  nature.&#8221;
  Then Pegram turned suddenly to Harry. &#8220;You're from the field?&#8221; he  said. &#8220;From the Army of Northern Virginia?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Harry. &#8220;My name is Kenton and I'm a lieutenant on the  staff of General Lee. My friend is George Dalton, also of the  commander- in-chief's staff.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you from Kentucky?&#8221; asked Daniel curiously.
  &#8220;Yes, from a little town called Pendleton.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I fancy that I've met a relative of yours. I returned recently  from a small town in North Georgia, the name of which I may not give,  owing to military reasons, necessary at the present time, and I met  while I was there a splendid tall man of middle years, Colonel George  Kenton of Kentucky.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's my father!&#8221; said Harry eagerly. &#8220;How was he?&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought he must be your father. The resemblance, you know. I  should say that if all men were as healthy as he looked there would be  no doctors in the world. He has a fine regiment and he'll be in the  battle that's breeding down there. Grant has taken Vicksburg, as we all  know, but a powerful army of ours is left in that region. It has to be  dealt with before we lose the West.&#8221;
  &#8220;And it will fight like the Army of Northern Virginia,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;I know the men of the West. The Yankees win there most of the time,  because we have our great generals in the East and they have theirs in  the West.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've had that thought myself,&#8221; said Bagby. &#8220;We've had men of genius  to lead us in the East, but we don't seem to produce them in the West.  People are always quoting Napoleon's saying that men are nothing, a man  is everything, which I never believed before, but which I'm beginning  to believe now.&#8221;
  Then the talk veered away from battle and back to social, literary  and artistic affairs, to all of which Harry and Dalton listened  eagerly. Both had minds that responded to the more delicate things of  life, and they were glad to hear something besides war discussed. It  was hard for them to think that everything was going on as usual in  Europe, that new books and operas and songs were being written, and  that men and women were going about their daily affairs in peace. Yet  both were destined to live to see the case reversed, the people of the  States setting the world an example in moderation and restraint, while  the governments of Europe were deluging that continent with blood.
  &#8220;If this war should result in our defeat,&#8221; said Bagby, &#8220;we won't get  a fair trial before the world for two or three generations, and maybe  never.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Dalton.
  &#8220;Because we're not a writing people. Oh, yes, there's Poe, I know,  the nation's greatest literary genius, but even Europe honored him  before the South did. We've devoted our industry and talents to  politics, oratory and war. We don't write books, and we don't have any  newspapers that amount to much. Why, as sure as I'm sitting here, the  moment this war is over New England and New York and Pennsylvania,  particularly New England, will begin to pour out books, telling how the  wicked Southerners brought on the war, what a cruel and low people we  are, the way in which we taught our boys, when they were strong enough,  how to beat slaves to death, and the whole world will believe them.  Maybe the next generation of Southerners will believe them too.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Harry.
  &#8220;Why? Why? Because we don't have any writers, and won't have any for  a long time! The writer has not been honored among us. Any fellow with  a roaring voice who can get up on the stump and tell his audience that  they're the bravest and best and smartest people on earth is the man  for them. You know that old story of Andy Jackson. Somebody taunted him  with being an uneducated man, so at the close of his next speech he  thundered out:<I> E pluribus unum! Multum in parvo! Sic semper  tyrannis!</I> So it was all over. Old Andy to that audience, and all  the others that heard of it, was the greatest Latin scholar in the  world.&#8221;
  &#8220;But that may apply to the North, too,&#8221; objected Harry.
  &#8220;So it would. Nevertheless they'll write this war, and they'll get  their side of it fastened on the world before our people begin to  write.&#8221;
  &#8220;But if we win we won't care,&#8221; said Randolph. &#8220;Success speaks for  itself. You can squirm and twist all you please, and make all the  excuses for it that you can think up, but there stands success glaring  contemptuously at you. You're like a little boy shooting arrows at the  Sphinx.&#8221;
  Thus the conversation ran on. Both Harry and Dalton were glad to be  in the company of these men, and to feel that there was something in  the world besides war. All the multifarious interests of peace and  civilization suddenly came crowding back upon them. Harry remembered  Pendleton with its rolling hills, green fields, and clear streams, and  Dalton remembered his own home, much like it, in the Valley of  Virginia, not so far away.
  &#8220;Do you remain long in Richmond?&#8221; asked Randolph.
  &#8220;A week at least,&#8221; replied Harry.
  &#8220;Then you ought to see a little of social life. Mrs. John Curtis, a  leading hostess, gives a reception and a dance to-morrow night. I can  easily procure invitations for both of you, and I know that she would  be glad to have two young officers freshly arrived from our glorious  Army of Northern Virginia.&#8221;
  &#8220;But our clothes!&#8221; said Dalton. &#8220;We have only a change of uniform  apiece, and they're not fresh by any means.&#8221;
  All the men laughed.
  &#8220;You don't think that Richmond is indulging in gorgeous apparel do  you?&#8221; said Daniel. &#8220;We never manufactured much ourselves, and since all  the rest of the world is cut off from us where are the clothes to come  from even for the women? Brush up your uniforms all you can and you'll  be more than welcome. Two gallant young officers from the Army of  Northern Virginia! Why, you'll be two Othellos, though white, of  course.&#8221;
  Harry glanced at Dalton, and Dalton glanced at Harry. Each saw that  the other wanted to go, and Daniel, watching them, smiled.
  &#8220;I see that you'll come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and so it's settled. Have you  quarters yet?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not yet,&#8221; replied Harry, &#8220;but we'll see about it this afternoon.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll have the invitations sent to you here at this hotel. All of us  will be there, and we'll see that you two meet everybody.&#8221;
  Both thanked him profusely. They were about to go, thinking it time  to report to General Winder, when Harry noticed a thin woman in a black  dress, carrying a large basket, and just leaving the hotel desk. He  caught a glimpse of her face and he knew that it was the old maid of  the train. Then something else was impressed upon his mind, something  which he had not noticed at their first meeting, but which came to him  at their second. He had seen a face like hers before, but the  resemblance was so faint and fleeting that he could not place it,  strive as he would. But he was sure that it was there.
  &#8220;Who is that woman?&#8221; he asked.
  Daniel shook his head and so did Randolph, but Bagby spoke up.
  &#8220;Her name is Henrietta Carden,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and she's a seamstress.  I've seen her coming to the hotel often before, bringing new clothes to  the women guests, or taking away old ones to be repaired. I believe  that the ladies account her most skillful. It's likely that she'll be  at the Curtis house, in a surgical capacity, to-morrow night, as a  quick repairer of damaged garments, those fine linen and silk and lace  affairs that we don't know anything about. Mrs. Curtis relies greatly  upon her and I ought to tell you, young gentlemen, that Mr. Curtis is a  most successful blockade runner, though he takes no personal risk  himself. The Curtis house is perhaps the most sumptuous in Richmond.  You'll see no signs of poverty there, though, as I told you, officers  in old and faded clothes are welcome.&#8221;
  Harry saw Henrietta Carden carrying the large basket of clothes, go  out at a side door, and he felt as if a black shadow like a menace had  passed across the floor. But it was only for an instant. He dismissed  it promptly, as one of those thoughts that come out of nothing, like  idle puffs of summer air. He and Dalton bade a brief farewell to their  new friends and left for the headquarters of General Winder. An elderly  and childless couple named Lanham had volunteered to take two officers  in their house near Capitol Square, and there Harry and Dalton were  sent.
  They could not have found a better place. Mr. and Mrs. Lanham were  quiet people, who gave them an excellent room and a fine supper. Mrs.  Lanham showed a motherly solicitude, and when she heard that they were  going to the Curtis ball on the following night she demanded that their  spare and best uniforms be turned over to her.
  &#8220;I can make them look fresh,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;and your appearance  must be the finest possible. No, don't refuse again. It's a pleasure to  me to do it. When I look at you two, so young and strong and so honest  in manner and speech, I wish that I had sons too, and then again I'm  glad I have not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not, Mrs. Lanham?&#8221; asked Harry.
  &#8220;Because I'd be in deadly fear lest I lose them. They'd go to the  war&#8212; I couldn't help it&#8212;and they'd surely be killed.&#8221;
  &#8220;We won't grieve over losing what we've never had,&#8221; smiled Mr.  Lanham. &#8220;That's morbid.&#8221;
  Harry and Dalton did their best to answer all the questions of their  hosts, who they knew would take no pay. The interest of both Mr. and  Mrs. Lanham was increased when they found that their young guests were  on the staff of General Lee and before that had been on the staff of  the great Stonewall Jackson. These two names were mighty in the South,  untouched by any kind of malice or envy, and with legends to cluster  around them as the years passed.
  &#8220;And you really saw Stonewall Jackson every day!&#8221; said Mrs. Lanham.  &#8220;You rode with him, talked with him, and went into battle with him?&#8221;
  &#8220;I was in all his campaigns, Mrs. Lanham,&#8221; replied Harry, modestly,  but not without pride. &#8220;I was with him in every battle, even to the  last, Chancellorsville. I was one of those who sheltered him from the  shells, when he was shot by our own men. Alas! what an awful mistake.  I&#8212;&#8221;
  He stopped suddenly. He had choked with emotion, and the tears came  into his eyes. Mrs. Lanham saw, and, understanding, she quickly changed  the subject to Lee. They talked a while after supper, called dinner  now, and then they went up to their room on the second floor.
  It was a handsome room, containing good furniture, including two  single beds. Their baggage had preceded them and everything was in  order. Two large windows, open to admit the fresh air, looked out over  Richmond. On a table stood a pitcher of ice water and glasses.
  &#8220;Our lot has certainly been cast in a pleasant place,&#8221; said Dalton,  taking a chair by one of the windows.
  &#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Harry, sitting in the chair by the other  window. &#8220;The Lanhams are fine people, and it's a good house. This is  luxury, isn't it, George, old man?&#8221;
  &#8220;The real article. We seem to be having luck all around. And we're  going to a big ball to-morrow night, too. Who'd have thought such a  thing possible a week ago?&#8221;
  &#8220;And we've made friends who'll see that we're not neglected.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's an absolute fact that we've become the favorite children of  fortune.&#8221;
  &#8220;No earthly doubt of it.&#8221;
  Then ensued a silence, broken at length by a scraping sound as each  moved his chair a little nearer to the window.
  &#8220;Close, George,&#8221; said Harry at length.
  &#8220;Yes, a bit hard to breathe.&#8221;
  &#8220;When fellows get used to a thing it's hard to change.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fine room, though, and those are splendid beds.&#8221;
  &#8220;Great on a winter night.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've noticed how the commander-in-chief himself seldom sleeps  under a tent, but takes his blankets to the open?&#8221;
  &#8220;Wonder how an Indian who has roamed the forest all his life feels  when he's shut up between four walls for the first time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fancy it's like a prison cell to him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Think so too. But the Lanhams are fine people and they're doing  their best for us.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think they'd be offended if I were to take my blankets, and  sleep on the grass in the back yard?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course they would. You mustn't think of such a thing. After this  war is over you've got to emerge slowly from barbarism. Do you remember  whether at supper we cut our food with our knives and lifted it to our  mouths with forks, or just tore and lifted with our fingers?&#8221;
  &#8220;We used knife and fork, each in its proper place. I happened to  think of it and watched myself. You, I suppose, did it through the  force of an ancient habit, recalled by civilized surroundings.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm glad you remember about it. Now I'm going to bed, and maybe  I'll sleep. I suppose there's no hope of seeing the stars through the  roof.&#8221;
  &#8220;None on earth! But my bed is fine and soft. We'd be all right if we  could only lift the roof off the house. I'd like to hear the wind  rubbing the boughs together.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stop it! You make me homesick! We've got no right to be pining for  blankets and the open, when these good people are doing so much for  us!&#8221;
  Each stretched himself upon his bed, and closed his eyes. They had  not been jesting altogether. So long a life in the open made summer  skies at night welcome, and roofs and walls almost took from them the  power of breathing.
  But the feeling wore away after a while and amid pleasurable  thoughts of the coming ball both fell asleep.
