    Notwithstanding his exertions during the day and evening, Philip   rose the next day at his usual hour, and was in time for the family   breakfast, at seven o'clock. 
  &quot;Don't you feel tired, Mr. Gray?&quot; asked Mrs. Webb. 
  &quot;No, thank you. I slept well, and feel quite refreshed.&quot; 
  &quot;He's used to it, Lucy,&quot; remarked her husband. 
  &quot;They look upon me as a professional player,&quot; thought Philip. 
  &quot;I think you and I ought to be more tired, for we were dancing all   the evening,&quot; continued the farmer. 
  When they rose from the table, Philip looked for his hat. 
  &quot;You're not going to leave us so soon, Mr. Gray?&quot; said Mrs. Webb   hospitably. &quot;We shall be glad to have you stay with us a day or two,   if you can content yourself.&quot; 
  &quot;That's right, Lucy. I'm glad you thought to ask him,&quot; said her   husband. 
  Philip was tempted to accept this kind invitation. He would have   free board, and be at no expense, instead of spending the small sum   he had earned the evening previous; but he reflected that he would  be  no nearer solving the problem of how he was to maintain himself,  and  while this was in uncertainty, he was naturally anxious. 
  &quot;I am very much obliged to you both,&quot; he said. &quot;If I come this way   again, I shall be glad to call upon you, but now I think I must be   pushing on.&quot; 
  &quot;You'll always be welcome, Mr. Gray,&quot; said Mrs. Webb. 
  Philip thanked her, and soon after set out on his way. 
  He was more cheerful and hopeful than the day before, for then he   was well nigh penniless, and now he had three dollars in his pocket. 
  Three dollars was not a very large sum, to be sure, but to one who   had been so near destitution as Philip it seemed very important. 
  Besides, he had discovered in his violin a source of income,   whereas, hitherto, he had looked upon it merely as a source of   amusement. This made him feel more independent and self-reliant. 
  He had walked perhaps two miles, when he heard the rattle of wheels   behind him. He did not turn his head, for there was nothing strange   in this sound upon a frequented road. He did turn his head, however,   when he heard a strong voice calling &quot;Hello!&quot; 
  Turning, he saw that a young man who was driving had slackened the   speed of his horse, and was looking toward him. 
  Philip halted, and regarded the driver inquiringly. 
  &quot;You're the young chap that played for a dance last night, ain't   you!&quot; said the newcomer. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you're the one I want to see&#8212;jump in, and we'll talk as we   are going along.&quot; 
  Philip had no objection to a ride, and he accepted the invitation   with alacrity. The driver, he noticed, was a young man, of pleasant   manners, though dressed in a coarse suit. 
  &quot;I drove over to Jonas Webb's to see you, and they told me you had   just gone,&quot; he continued. &quot;I thought maybe you'd get up late, but you   was up on time. Are you engaged for this evening?&quot; 
  Philip began to prick up his ears and become interested. Was it   possible that his good luck was to continue, and that he was to have   an opportunity of earning some more money through his faithful   friend, the violin? He didn't think it well to exhibit the   satisfaction he felt, and answered, in a matter-of-fact tone; 
  &quot;No, I have no engagement for this evening.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm glad of it,&quot; responded the young man, evidently well pleased.   &quot;You see, we had arranged to have a dance over to our place, but Mr.   Beck, being sick, we thought we'd have to give it up. One of my   neighbors was over last evening and heard you play, and he thought   maybe we could secure you.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be glad to play for you,&quot; said Philip politely. 
  &quot;What are your terms?&quot; asked his companion. 
  &quot;Three dollars and board and lodging for the time I need to stay.&quot; 
  &quot;That's satisfactory. I'll engage you.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it near here?&quot; asked Philip. 
  &quot;It's in Conway&#8212;only four miles from here. I'll take you right  over  now, and you shall stay at my house.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, I shall find that very agreeable,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;Does Mr. Beck live near you?&quot; asked our hero, a little later. 
  &quot;Bless you! he lives in our place.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose his services are in demand?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he is sent for to all the towns around. Fact is, there isn't   anybody but he that can play to suit; but I expect, from what I've   heard, that you can come up to him.&quot; 
  &quot;I couldn't expect to do that,&quot; said Philip modestly. &quot;I am very   young yet.&quot; 
  &quot;Folks do say you beat Paul. It seems wonderful, too, considering   how young you are. What might be your age, now?&quot; 
  &quot;Just sixteen.&quot; 
  &quot;Sho! you don't say so? Why, Paul Beck's over fifty.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Beck won't think I'm interfering with him, will he?&quot; asked   Philip. 
  &quot;Of course, he can't. We'd a had him if he was well. We can't be   expected to put off the party because he's sick. That wouldn't be   reasonable, now, would it?&quot; 
  &quot;I should think not.&quot; 
  Just then Philip became sensible that a light wagon was  approaching,  driven by a young lady. 
  He did not, however, suppose it was any one he knew till the   carriage stopped, and he heard a voice saying: 
  &quot;Good morning, Mr. Gray!&quot; 
  Then he discovered that it was the same young lady who had asked  for  an introduction to him the evening previous. 
  &quot;Good morning, Miss Snodgrass!&quot; he said politely, remembering,   fortunately, the young lady's name. 
  Meanwhile, Maria and Philip's drivers had also exchanged   salutations, for they were acquainted. 
  &quot;And where are you carrying Mr. Gray, Mr. Blake?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;I'm carrying him over to our place. He's going to play for us this   evening.&quot; 
  &quot;Is there going to be a dance in Conway this evening?&quot; inquired  Miss  Snodgrass, with sudden interest. 
  &quot;Yes. Won't you come over?&quot; 
  &quot;I will, if I can get Jedidiah to bring me,&quot; answered Maria. 
  &quot;I guess there's no doubt about that,&quot; answered Andrew Blake, who   knew very well Jedidiah's devotion to the young lady. 
  &quot;Oh, I don't know!&quot; answered Maria coquet-tishly. &quot;Perhaps he won't   care for my company.&quot; 
  &quot;If he doesn't, you won't have any trouble in finding another  beau.&quot; 
  After a little more conversation, the young lady drove away; but  not  without expressing to Philip her delight at having another chance  to  hear his beautiful playing. 
  &quot;She'll be there,&quot; said Andrew Blake, as they drove away. &quot;She  makes  Jedidiah Burbank do just as she orders him.&quot; 
  &quot;Are they engaged?&quot; asked our hero. 
  &quot;Yes, I expect so; but there may be some chance of your cutting him   out, if you try. The young lady seems to admire you.&quot; 
  Philip smiled. 
  &quot;I am only a boy of sixteen,&quot; he said. &quot;I am too young to think of   such things. I won't interfere with Mr. Burbank.&quot; 
  &quot;Jedidiah's apt to be jealous,&quot; said Blake, &quot;and Maria likes to   torment him. However, she'll end by marrying him, I guess.&quot; 
  In half an hour or thereabouts, Andrew Blake drew up at the gate of   a small but neat house on the main street in Conway. He was a   carpenter, as Philip afterward found, and had built the house   himself. He was probably of about the same age as Jonas Webb, and   like him was married to a young wife. 
  During the afternoon, Philip, being left pretty much to his own   devices, took a walk in and about the village, ascending a hill at   one side, which afforded him a fine view of that and neighboring   villages. 
  He was pleasantly received and hospitably entertained at the house   of Mr. Blake, and about quarter of eight started out for the hall,  at  which he was to play, in company with his host and hostess. 
  As they approached the hall, a young man approached them with a   perplexed face. 
  &quot;What do you think, Andrew?&quot; he said. &quot;Paul Beck's in the hall, as   mad as a hatter, and he vows he'll play himself. He says he was   engaged, and no one shall take his place.&quot; 
  Andrew Blake looked disturbed, and Philip shared in his feeling.  Was  he to lose his engagement, after all?
