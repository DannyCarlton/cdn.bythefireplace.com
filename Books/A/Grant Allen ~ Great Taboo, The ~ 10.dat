Vaguely and indefinitely one terrible truth had been forced by slow  degrees upon Felix's mind; whatever else Korong meant, it implied at  least some fearful doom in store, sooner or later, for the persons who  bore it. How awful that doom might be, he could hardly imagine; but he  must devote himself henceforth to the task of discovering what its nature  was, and, if possible, of averting it.    
Yet how to reconcile this impending terror with the other obvious facts  of the situation? the fact that they were considered divine beings and  treated like gods; and the fact that the whole population seemed really  to regard them with a devotion and kindliness closely bordering on  religious reverence? If Korongs were gods, why should the people want to  kill them? If they meant to kill them, why pay them meanwhile such  respect and affection?    
One point at least was now, however, quite clear to Felix. While the  natives, especially the women, displayed toward both of them in their  personal aspect a sort of regretful sympathy, he could not help noticing  at the same time that the men, at any rate, regarded them also largely  in an impersonal light, as a sort of generalized abstraction of the  powers of nature--an embodied form of the rain and the weather. The  islanders were anxious to keep their white guests well supplied, well  fed, and in perfect health, not so much for the strangers' sakes as for  their own advantage; they evidently considered that if anything went  wrong with either of their two new gods, corresponding misfortunes might  happen to their crops and the produce of their bread-fruit groves. Some  mysterious sympathy was held to subsist between the persons of the  castaways and the state of the weather. The natives effusively thanked  them after welcome rain, and looked askance at them, scowling, after long  dry spells. It was for this, no doubt, that they took such pains to  provide them with attentive Shadows, and to gird round their movements  with taboos of excessive stringency. Nothing that the new-comers said or  did was indifferent, it seemed, to the welfare of the community; plenty  and prosperity depended upon the passing state of Muriel's health, and  famine or drought might be brought about at any moment by the slightest  imprudence in Felix's diet.    
How stringent these taboos really were Felix learned by slow degrees  alone to realize. From the very beginning he had observed, to be sure,  that they might only eat and drink the food provided for them; that they  were supplied with a clean and fresh-built hut, as well as with brand-new  cocoanut cups, spoons, and platters; that no litter of any sort was  allowed to accumulate near their enclosure; and that their Shadows never  left them, or went out of their sight, by day or by night, for a single  moment. Now, however, he began to perceive also that the Shadows were  there for that very purpose, to watch over them, as it were, like guards,  on behalf of the community; to see that they ate or drank no tabooed  object; to keep them from heedlessly transgressing any unwritten law of  the creed of Boupari; and to be answerable for their good behavior  generally. They were partly servants, it was true, and partly sureties;  but they were partly also keepers, and keepers who kept a close and  constant watch upon the persons of their prisoners. Once or twice Felix,  growing tired for the moment of this continual surveillance, had tried to  give Toko the slip, and to stroll away from his hut, unattended, for a  walk through the island, in the early morning, before his Shadow had  waked; but on each such occasion he found to his surprise that, as he  opened the hut door, the Shadow rose at once and confronted him angrily,  with an inquiring eye; and in time he perceived that a thin string was  fastened to the bottom of the door, the other end of which was tied to  the Shadow's ankle; and this string could not be cut without letting fall  a sort of latch or bar which closed the door outside, only to be raised  again by some external person.    
Clearly, it was intended that the Korong should have no chance of escape  without the knowledge of the Shadow, who, as Felix afterward learned,  would have paid with his own body by a cruel death for the Korong's  disappearance.    
He might as well have tried to escape his own shadow as to escape the one  the islanders had tacked on to him.    
All Felix's energies were now devoted to the arduous task of discovering  what Korong really meant, and what possibility he might have of saving  Muriel from the mysterious fate that seemed to be held in store for them.    
One evening, about six weeks after their arrival in the island, the young  Englishman was strolling by himself (after the sun sank low in heaven)  along a pretty tangled hill-side path, overhung with lianas and rope-like  tropical creepers, while his faithful Shadow lingered a step or two  behind, keeping a sharp lookout meanwhile on all his movements.    
Near the top of a little crag of volcanic rock, in the center of the  hills, he came suddenly upon a hut with a cleared space around it,  somewhat neater in appearance than any of the native cottages he had yet  seen, and surrounded by a broad white belt of coral sand, exactly like  that which ringed round and protected their own enclosure. But what  specially attracted Felix's attention was the fact that the space outside  this circle had been cleared into a regular flower-garden, quite European  in the definiteness and orderliness of its quaint arrangement.    
"Why, who lives here?" Felix asked in Polynesian, turning round in  surprise to his respectful Shadow.    
The Shadow waved his hand vaguely in an expansive way toward the sky, as  he answered, with a certain air of awe, often observable in his speech  when taboos were in question, "The King of Birds. A very great god. He  speaks the bird language."    
"Who is he?" Felix inquired, taken aback, wondering vaguely to himself  whether here, perchance, he might have lighted upon some stray and  shipwrecked compatriot.    
"He comes from the sun like yourselves," the Shadow answered, all  deference, but with obvious reserve. "He is a very great god. I may not  speak much of him. But he is not Korong. He is greater than that, and  less. He is Tula, the same as Tu-Kila-Kila."    
"Is he as powerful as Tu-Kila-Kila?" Felix asked, with intense interest.    
"Oh, no, he's not nearly so powerful as that," the Shadow answered, half  terrified at the bare suggestion. "No god in heaven or earth is like  Tu-Kila-Kila. This one is only king of the birds, which is a little  province, while Tu-Kila-Kila is king of heaven and earth, of plants  and animals, of gods and men, of all things created. At his nod the sky  shakes and the rocks tremble. But still, this god is Tula, like  Tu-Kila-Kila. He is not for a year. He goes on forever, till some other  supplants him."    
"You say he comes from the sun," Felix put in, devoured with curiosity.  "And he speaks the bird language? What do you mean by that? Does he speak  like the Queen of the Clouds and myself when we talk together?"    
"Oh, dear, no," the Shadow answered, in a very confident tone. "He  doesn't speak the least bit in the world like that. He speaks shriller  and higher, and still more bird-like. It is chatter, chatter, chatter,  like the parrots in a tree; tirra, tirra, tirra; tarra, tarra, tarra; la,  la, la; lo, lo, lo; lu, lu, lu; li la. And he sings to himself all the  time. He sings this way--"    
And then the Shadow, with that wonderful power of accurate mimicry which  is so strong in all natural human beings, began to trill out at once,  with a very good Parisian accent, a few lines from a well-known song in  "La Fille de Madame Angot:"    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"Quand on conspi-re, <br>  Quand sans frayeur <br> On pent se di-re <br>  Conspirateur, <br> Pour tout le mon-de <br>  Il faut avoir <br> Perruque blon-de <br>  Et collet noir-- <br> Perruque blon-de <br>  Et collet noir."</small></i></blockquote><br>
"That's how the King of the Birds sings," the Shadow said, as he  finished, throwing back his head, and laughing with all his might at his  own imitation. "So funny, isn't it? It's exactly like the song of the  pink-crested parrot."    
"Why, Toko, it's French," Felix exclaimed, using the Fijian word for a  Frenchman, which the Shadow, of course, on his remote island, had never  before heard. "How on earth did he come here?"    
"I can't tell you," Toko answered, waving his arms seaward. "He came from  the sun, like yourselves. But not in a sun-boat. It had no fire. He came  in a canoe, all by himself. And Mali says"--here the Shadow lowered his  voice to a most mysterious whisper--"he's a man-a-oui-oui."    
Felix quivered with excitement. "Man-a-oui-oui" is the universal name  over semi-civilized Polynesia for a Frenchman. Felix seized upon it with  avidity. "A man-a-oui-oui!" he cried, delighted. "How strange! How  wonderful! I must go in at once to his hut and see him!"    
He had lifted his foot and was just going to cross the white line of  coral-sand, when his Shadow, catching him suddenly and stoutly round the  waist, pulled him back from the enclosure with every sign of horror,  alarm, and astonishment. "No, you can't go," he cried, grappling with him  with all his force, yet using him very tenderly for all that, as becomes  a god. "Taboo! Taboo there!"    
"But I am a god myself," Felix cried, insisting upon his privileges. If  you have to submit to the disadvantages of taboo, you may as well claim  its advantages as well. "The King of Fire and the King of Water crossed  my taboo line. Why shouldn't I cross equally the King of the Birds',  then?"    
"So you might--as a rule," the Shadow answered with promptitude. "You are  both gods. Your taboos do not cross. You may visit each other. You may  transgress one another's lines without danger of falling dead on the  ground as common men would do if they broke taboo-lines. But this is the  Month of Birds. The king is in retreat. No man may see him except his own  Shadow, the Little Cockatoo, who brings him his food and drink. Do you  see that hawk's head, stuck upon the post by the door at the side. That  is his Special Taboo. He keeps it for this month. Even gods must respect  that sign, for a reason which it would be very bad medicine to mention.  While the Month of Birds lasts, no man may look upon the king or hear  him. If they did, they would die, and the carrion birds would eat them.  Come away. This is dangerous."    
Scarcely were the words well out of his mouth when from the recesses of  the hut a rollicking French voice was heard, trilling out merrily:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"Quand on con-spi-re, <br>  Quand, sans frayeur--"</small></i></blockquote><br>
Without waiting for more, the Shadow seized Felix's arm in an agony of  terror. "Come away!" he cried, hurriedly, "come away! What will become  of us? This is horrible, horrible! We have broken taboo. We have heard  the god's voice. The sky will fall on us. If his Shadow were to find it  out and tell my people, my people would tear us limb from limb. Quick,  quick! Hide away! Let us run fast through the forest before any man  discover it."    
The Shadow's voice rang deep with alarm. Felix felt he dare not trifle  with this superstition. Profound as was his curiosity about the  mysterious Frenchman, he was compelled to bottle up his eagerness and  anxiety for the moment, and patiently wait till the Month of Birds had  run its course, and taken its inconvenient taboo along with it. These  limitations were terrible. Yet he counted much upon the information the  Frenchman could give him. The man had been some time on the island, it  was clear, and doubtless he understood its ways thoroughly; he might  cast some light at last upon the Korong mystery.    
So he went back through the woods with a heart somewhat lighter.    
Not far from their own huts he met Muriel and Mali.    
As they walked home together, Felix told his companion in a very few  words the strange discovery about the Frenchman, and the impenetrable  taboo by which he was at present surrounded. Muriel drew a deep sigh.  "Oh, Felix," she said--for they were naturally by this time very much at  home with one another, "did you ever know anything so dreadful as the  mystery of these taboos? It seems as if we should never get really to the  bottom of them. Mali's always springing some new one upon me. I don't  believe we shall ever be able to leave the island--we're so hedged round  with taboos. Even if we were to see a ship to-day, I don't believe they'd  allow us to signal it."    
There was a red sunset; a lurid, tropical, red-and-green sunset. It boded  mischief.    
They were passing by some huts at the moment, and over the stockade of  one of them a tree was hanging with small yellow fruits, which Felix knew  well in Fiji as wholesome and agreeable. He broke off a small branch as  he passed; and offered a couple thoughtlessly to Muriel. She took them in  her fingers, and tasted them gingerly. "They're not so bad," she said,  taking another from the bough. "They're very much like gooseberries."    
At the same moment, Felix popped one into his own mouth, and swallowed it  without thinking.    
Almost before they knew what had happened, with the same extraordinary  rapidity as in the case of the wedding, the people in the cottages ran  out, with every sign of fear and apprehension, and, seizing the branch  from Felix's hands, began upbraiding the two Shadows for their want  of attention.    
"We couldn't help it," Toko exclaimed, with every appearance of guilt and  horror on his face. "They were much too sharp for us. Their hearts are  black. How could we two interfere? These gods are so quick! They had  picked and eaten them before we ever saw them."    
One of the men raised his hand with a threatening air--but against the  Shadow, not against the sacred person of Felix. "He will be ill," he  said, angrily, pointing toward the white man; "and she will, too. Their  hearts are indeed black. They have sown the seed of the wind. They have  both of them eaten of it. They will both be ill. You deserve to die! And  what will come now to our trees and plantations?"    
The crowd gathered round them, cursing low and horribly. The two  terrified Europeans slunk off to their huts, unaware of their exact  crime, and closely followed by a scowling but despondent mob of natives.  As they crossed their sacred boundary, Muriel cried, with a sudden  outburst of tears, "Oh, Felix, what on earth shall we ever do to get  rid of this terrible, unendurable godship!"    
The natives without set up a great shout of horror. "See, see! she  cries!" they exclaimed, in indescribable panic. "She has eaten the  storm-fruit, and already she cries! Oh, clouds, restrain yourselves! Oh,  great queen, mercy! Whatever will become of us and our poor huts  and gardens!"    
And for hours they crouched around, beating their breasts and shrieking.    
That evening, Muriel sat up late in Felix's hut, with Mali by her side,  too frightened to go back into her own alone before those angry people.  And all the time, just beyond the barrier line, they could hear, above  the whistle of the wind around the hut, the droning voices of dozens of  natives, cowering low on the ground; they seemed to be going through some  litany or chant, as if to deprecate the result of this imprudent action.    
"What are they doing outside?" Felix asked of his Shadow at last, after a  peculiarly long wail of misery.    
And the Shadow made answer, in very solemn tones, "They are trying to  propitiate your mightiness, and to avert the omen, lest the rain should  fall, and the wind should blow, and the storm-cloud should burst over the  island to destroy them."    
Then Felix remembered suddenly of himself that the season when this  storm-fruit, or storm-apple, as they called it, was ripe in Fiji, was  also the season when the great Pacific cyclones most often swept over the  land in full fury--storms unexampled on any other sea, like that famous  one which wrecked so many European men-of-war a few years since in the  harbor of Samoa.    
And without, the wail came louder and clearer still! "If you sow the  bread-fruit seed, you will reap the breadfruit. If you sow the wind, you  will reap the whirlwind. They have eaten the storm-fruit. Oh, great king,  save us!"
