The eyes of all the warlike young men now turned northward. The people  whom they had rescued scattered among their relatives and friends,  awaiting the time when they could return to the wilderness, and rebuild  their homes there, but Colden, Wilton, Carson and their troop were eager  for service with Colonel William Johnson. In time orders arrived from  the Governor of Pennsylvania, directing them to join the force that was  being raised in the province of New York to meet the onrush of the  savages and the French, and they rejoiced. Meanwhile Robert, Tayoga and  Willet made a short stay at Mount Johnson, and in the company of its  hospitable owner and his wife refreshed themselves after their great  hardships and dangers.    
Colonel Johnson's activities as a host did not make him neglect his  duties as a commander. Without military experience, save that recently  acquired in border war, he nevertheless showed indomitable energy as a  leader, and his bluff, hearty manner endeared him to Colonials and  Mohawks alike. A great camp had been formed on the low grounds by  Albany, and Robert and his comrades in time proceeded there, where a  numerous force of men from New York and New England and many Mohawks  were gathered. It was their plan to march against the great French  fortress of Crown Point on Lake Champlain, which Robert heard would be  defended by a formidable French and Indian army under Baron Dieskau, an  elderly Saxon in the French service.    
Robert also heard that St. Luc was with Dieskau, and that he was leading  daring raids against little bands of militia on their way from New  England to the camp near Albany. Two were practically destroyed, half of  their numbers being killed, while the rest were sent as prisoners into  Canada. Two more succeeded in beating off the Frenchman, though with  large loss, but he was recognized by everybody as a great danger, and  Daganoweda and the best of the Mohawks went forth to meet him.    
Rogers with his partisan band and Black Rifle also disappeared in the  wilderness, and Robert looked longingly after them, but he and his  friends were still held at the Albany camp, as the march of the army was  delayed, owing to the fact that five provincial governors, practically  independent of one another, had a hand in its management, and they could  not agree upon a plan. Braddock's great defeat had a potent influence in  the north, and now they were all for caution.    
While they delayed Robert went into Albany one bright morning to see  Mynheer Jacobus Huysman, who showed much anxiety about him these days.  The little Dutch city looked its best, a comfortable place on its hills,  inhabited by comfortable people, but swarming now with soldiers and even  with Mohawks, all of whom brought much business to the thrifty  burghers. Albany had its profit out of everything, the river commerce,  the fur trade, and war itself.    
Robert, as he walked along, watched with interest the crowd which was,  in truth, cosmopolitan, despite the smallness of the place. Some of the  Colonials had uniforms of blue faced with red, of which they were very  proud, but most of them were in the homespun attire of every day. They  were armed with their own rifles. Only the English had bayonets so far.  The Americans instead carried hatchets or tomahawks at their belts, and  the hatchet had many uses. Every man also carried a big jack or clasp  knife which, too, had its many uses.    
The New Englanders, who were most numerous in the camp, were of pure  British blood, a race that had become in the American climate tall, thin  and very muscular, enduring of body and tenacious of spirit, religious,  ambitious, thinking much of both worldly gain and the world hereafter.  Among them moved the people of Dutch blood from the province of New  York, generally short and fat like their ancestors, devoted to good  living, cheerful in manner, but hard and unscrupulous in their dealing  with the Indians, and hence a menace to the important alliance with the  Hodenosaunee.    
There were the Germans, also, most of them descendants of the fugitives  from the Palatinate, after it had been ravaged by the generals of Louis  XIV, a quiet, humble people, industrious, honest, sincerely religious,  low at present in the social scale, and patronized by the older families  of English or Dutch blood, perhaps not dreaming that their race would  become some day the military terror of the world.    
The Mohawks, who passed freely through the throng, were its most  picturesque feature. The world bred no more haughty savages than they.  Tall men, with high cheek bones, and fierce eyes, they wore little  clothing in the summer weather, save now and then a blanket of brilliant  color for the sake of adornment. There were also some Onondagas, as  proud as the Mohawks, but not so fierce.    
A few Virginians and Marylanders, come to cooperate with the northern  forces, were present, and they, like the New Englanders, were of pure  British blood. Now and then a Swede, broad of face, from the Jersey  settlements could be seen, and there was scarcely a nation in western  Europe that did not have at least one representative in the streets of  Albany.    
It pleased Robert to see the great variety of the throng. It made a deep  impression upon his imaginative mind. Already he foresaw the greatness  of America, when these races were blended in a land of infinite  resources. But such thoughts were driven from his mind by a big figure  that loomed before him and a hearty voice that saluted him.    
"Day dreaming, Master Lennox?" said the voice. "One does not have much  time for dreams now, when the world is so full of action."    
It was none other than Master Benjamin Hardy, portly, rubicund, richly  but quietly dressed in dark broadcloth, dark silk stockings and shoes of  Spanish leather with large silver buckles. Robert was unaffectedly glad  to see him, and they shook hands with warmth.    
"I did not know that you were in Albany," said young Lennox.    
"But I knew that you were here," said Master Hardy.    
"I haven't your great resources for collecting knowledge."    
"A story reached me in New York concerning the gallant conduct of one  Robert Lennox on the retreat from Fort Refuge, and I wished to come here  myself and see if it be true."    
"I did no better than a hundred others. How is the wise Master Jonathan  Pillsbury?"    
"As wise as ever. He earnestly urged me, when I departed for this town,  not to be deceived by the glamour of the military. 'Bear in mind, Master  Benjamin,' he said, 'that you and I have been associates many years, and  your true path is that of commerce and gain. The march and the  battlefield are not for you any more than they are for me.' Wise words  and true, and it was not for me to gainsay them. So I gave him my  promise that I would not march with this brave expedition to the lakes."    
The merchant's words were whimsical, but Robert felt that he was  examining him with critical looks, and he felt, too, that a protecting  influence was once more about him. He could not doubt that Master Hardy  was his sincere friend, deeply interested in him. He had given too many  proofs of it, and a sudden curiosity about his birth, forgotten amid the  excitement of continued action, rose anew. He was about to ask  questions, but he remembered that they would not be answered, and so he  held his peace, while the merchant walked on with him toward the house  of Mynheer Jacobus Huysman.    
"You are bent upon going with the army?" said Mr. Hardy. "Haven't you  had enough of battle? There was a time, after the news of Braddock's  defeat came, when I feared that you had fallen, but a message sent by  the young Englishman, Grosvenor, told me you were safe, and I was very  thankful. It is natural for the young to seek what they call adventure,  and to serve their country, but you have done much already, Robert. You  might go with me now to New York, and still feel that you are no  shirker."    
"You are most kind, Mr. Hardy. I believe that next to Willet and Tayoga  you are the greatest and best of my friends. Why, I know not, nor do I  ask now, but the fact is patent, and I thank you many times over,  although I can't accept your offer. I'm committed to this expedition and  there my heart lies, too. Willet and Tayoga go with it. So do Black  Rifle and Rogers, I think, and Colonel Johnson, who is also my good  friend, is to lead it. I couldn't stay behind and consider myself a true  man."    
Master Benjamin Hardy sighed.    
"Doubtless you are right, Robert," he said, "and perhaps at your age I  should have taken the same view, despite Jonathan's assertion that my  true ways are the ways of commerce and gain. Nevertheless, my interest  in this struggle is great. It is bound to be since it means vast changes  in the colonies, whatever its result."    
"What changes do you have in mind, Mr. Hardy?"    
"Mental changes more than any other, Robert. The war in its sweep bids  fair to take in almost all the civilized world we know. We are the  outpost of Britain, Canada is the outpost of France, and in a long and  desperate strife such as this promises to be we are sure to achieve  greater mental stature, and to arrive at a more acute consciousness of  our own strength and resources. Beyond that I don't care to predict. But  come, lad, we'll not talk further of such grave matters, you and I.  Instead we'll have a pleasant hour with Mynheer Jacobus Huysman, a man  of no mean quality, as you know."    
Mynheer Jacobus was at home, and he gave them a great welcome, glancing  at one and at the other, and then back again, apparently rejoiced to see  them together.    
Then he ordered a huge repast, of which they ate bountifully, and upon  which he made heavy inroads himself. When the demands of hospitality  were somewhat satisfied, he put aside knife and fork, and said to Mr.  Hardy:    
"And now, old friend, it iss no impertinence on my part to ask what hass  brought you to Albany."    
Master Benjamin, who was gravely filling a pipe, lighted it, took one  puff, and replied:    
"No, Jacobus, it is no impertinence. No question that you might ask me  could be an impertinence. You and I are old friends, and I think we  understand each other. I have to say in reply that I have come here on a  matter of army contracts, to get a clearer and better view of the war  which is going to mean so much to all of us, and to attend to one or  two matters personal to myself."    
Robert, excusing himself, had risen and was looking out of a window at a  passing company of soldiers. Mynheer Jacobus glanced at him and then  glanced back at the merchant.    
"It iss a good lad," he said, "und you watch over him as well as you  can."    
"Aye, I do my best," replied Hardy in the same subdued tones, "but he is  bold of spirit, full of imagination and adventurous, and, though I would  fain keep him out of the war, I cannot. Yet if I were his age I would go  into it myself."    
"It iss the way of youth. He lives in times troubled und full of danger,  yet he hass in the hunter, Willet, and the Onondaga, Tayoga, friends who  are a flaming sword on each side of him. Willet hass a great mind. He  iss as brave as a lion und full of resource."    
"Right well do I know it, Jacobus."    
"And the young Onondaga, Tayoga, is of the antique mold. Do I not know  it, I who haf taught him so long? Often I could think he was a young  Greek or Roman of the best type, reincarnated und sent to the forest. He  does haf the lofty nature, the noble character und simplicity of a young  Roman of the republic, before it was corrupted by conquest. I tell you,  Benjamin Hardy, that we do not value the red men at their true worth,  especially those of the Hodenosaunee!"    
"Right well do I know that, too, Jacobus. I had a fair reading in the  classics, when I was a schoolboy, and I should call the lad, Tayoga,  more Greek in spirit than Roman. I have found in him the spiritual  quality, the love of beauty and the kindliness of soul which the books  say the Greeks had and which the Romans lacked."    
"It iss fairly put, Benjamin, und I bethink me you are right. But there  iss one thing which you do not know, but which you ought to know,  because it iss of much importance."    
"What is it?" asked Hardy, impressed by the manner of Jacobus.    
"It iss the fact that Adrian Van Zoon arrived in Albany this morning."    
The merchant started slightly in surprise, and then his face became a  mask.    
"Adrian Van Zoon is a merchant like myself," he said. "He has a right to  come to Albany. Perhaps he feels the necessity, too, as no doubt he is  interested in large contracts for the army."    
"It iss true, Benjamin, but you und I would rather he had not come. He  arrived but this morning on his own sloop, the <i>Dirkhoeven</i>, und I feel  that wherever Adrian Van Zoon iss the air becomes noxious, full of  poisonous vapors und dangerous to those about him."    
"You're right, Jacobus. I see that your faculties are as keen as ever.  You can see through a mill stone, and you can put together much larger  figures than two and two."    
Mynheer Jacobus smiled complacently.    
"I haf not yet reached my zenith," he said, "und I am very glad I am not  yet an old man, because I am so full of curiosity."    
"I don't take your meaning, Jacobus."    
"I would not like to die before this great und long war iss ended  because I wish to see how it does end. Und I want to see the nature of  the mighty changes which I feel are coming in the world."    
"What changes, for instance, Jacobus?"    
"The action of the New World upon the Old, und the action of the old  monarchies upon one another. All things change, Benjamin. You und I know  that. The veil of majesty that wraps around kings und thrones iss not  visible to us here in der American forest, und maybe for dot reason we  see the changes coming in Europe better than those who are closer by.  France is the oldest of all the old und great monarchies und for dot  reason the French monarchy iss most overripe. Steeped in luxury und  corruption, the day of its decay hass set in."    
"But the French people are valiant and great, Jacobus. Think not that we  have in them a weak antagonist."    
"I said nothing of the French nation, Benjamin, mein friend. I spoke of  the French throne. The French leaders in Canada are brave und  enterprising. They will inflict on us many defeats, but the French  throne will not give to them the support to which they as Frenchmen are  entitled."    
"You probably see the truth, Jacobus, and it's to our advantage. Perhaps  'tis better that the French throne should decay. But we'll return to  affairs closer by. You've had Van Zoon watched?"    
"My stable boy, Peter, hass not let him out of sight, since he landed  from the <i>Dirkhoeven</i>. Peter is not a lad of brilliant appearance,  which iss perhaps all the better for our purpose, but he will keep Van  Zoon in sight, if it iss humanly possible, without being himself  suspected."    
"Well done, Jacobus, but I might have known that you would take all  needful precautions."    
Robert came back from the window, and they promptly changed the current  of the talk, speaking now of the army, its equipment, and the probable  time of its march to meet Dieskau. Presently they left Mynheer Huysman's  house, and Robert and the merchant went toward the camp on the flats.  Here they beheld a scene of great activity and of enormous interest to  Robert.    
Few stranger armies have ever been gathered than that which Colonel  William Johnson was preparing to lead against Crown Point. The New  Englanders brought with them all their characteristics, their  independence, their love of individualism and their piety. Despite this  piety it was an army that swore hugely, and, despite its huge swearing,  it was an honest army. It survives in written testimony that the  greatest swearers were from the provinces of New York and Rhode Island,  and Colonel Ephraim Williams, an officer among them writing at the time,  said that the language they most used was "the language of Hell." And,  on the other hand, a New York officer testified that not a housewife in  Albany or its suburbs could mourn the loss of a single chicken. Private  property everywhere was absolutely safe, and, despite the oaths and  rough appearance of the men, no woman was ever insulted.    
"They're having prayer meeting now," said Mr. Hardy, as they came upon  the flats. "I've learned they have sermons twice a week--their ministers  came along with them--prayers every day, and the singing of songs many  times. They often alternate the psalm singing with the military drill,  but I'm not one to decry their observances. Religious fervor is a great  thing in battle. It made the Ironsides of Cromwell invincible."    
Five hundred voices, nearly all untrained, were chanting a hymn. They  were the voices of farmers and frontiersmen, but the great chorus had  volume and majesty, and Robert was not one to depreciate them. Instead  he was impressed. He understood the character of both New Englanders and  New Yorkers. Keen for their own, impatient of control, they were  nevertheless capable of powerful collective effort. A group of Mohawks  standing by were also watching with grave and serious attention. When  they raised a chant to Manitou they demanded the utmost respect, and  they gave it also, without the asking, to the white man when he sang in  his own way to his own God.    
It was when they turned back to the town that they were hailed in a  joyous voice, and Robert beheld the young English officer, Grosvenor,  whom he had known in New York, Grosvenor, a little thinner than of old,  but more tanned and with an air of experience. His pleasure at meeting  Robert again was great and unaffected. He shook hands with him warmly  and exclaimed:    
"When I last saw you, Lennox, it was at the terrible forest fight,  where we learned our bitter lesson. I saw that you escaped, but I did  not know what became of you afterward."    
"I've had adventures, and I'll tell you of 'em later," said Robert.  "Glad I am to see you, although I had not heard of your coming to  Albany."    
"I arrived but this morning. No British troops are here. I understand  this army is to be composed wholly of Colonials--pardon the word, I use  it for lack of a better--and of Mohawks. But I was able to secure in New  York a detail on the staff of Colonel Johnson. My position perhaps will  be rather that of an observer and representative of the regular troops,  but I hope, nevertheless, to be of some service. I suppose I won't see  as much of you as I would like, as you're likely to be off in the forest  in front of the army with those scouting friends of yours."    
"It's what we can do best," said Robert, "but if there's a victory ahead  I hope we'll all be present when it's gained."    
Jacobus Huysman insisted that all his old friends be quartered with him,  while they were in Albany, and as there was little at present for  Grosvenor to do, he was added by arrangement with Colonel Johnson to the  group. They sat that evening on the portico in the summer dusk, and  Master Alexander McLean, the schoolmaster, joined them, still regarding  Robert and Tayoga as lads under his care, and soon including Grosvenor  also. But the talk was pleasant, and they were deep in it when a man  passed in the street and a shadow fell upon them all.    
It was Adrian Van Zoon, heavy, dressed richly as usual, and carrying a  large cane, with a gold head. To the casual eye he was a man of  importance, aware of his dignity, and resolute in the maintenance of it.  He bowed with formal politeness to the group upon the portico, and  walked majestically on. Mynheer Jacobus watched him until he was out of  sight, going presumably to his inn, and then his eyes began to search  for another figure. Presently it appeared, lank, long and tow-headed,  the boy, Peter, of whom he had spoken. Mynheer Huysman introduced him  briefly to the others, and he responded, in every case, with a pull at a  long lock on his forehead. His superficial appearance was that of a  simpleton, but Robert noticed sharp, observant eyes under the thick  eyebrows. Mynheer Jacobus, Willet and Master Hardy, excusing themselves  for a few minutes, went into an inner room.    
"What has Mynheer Van Zoon been doing, Peter?" asked Jacobus.    
"He has talked with three contractors for the army," replied the lad.  "He also had a short conversation with Colonel Ephraim Williams of the  Massachusetts militia."    
"Williams is a thoroughly honest man," said Mr. Hardy. "His talk with  Van Zoon could only have been on legitimate business. We'll dismiss him.  What more have you seen, Peter?"    
"Late in the afternoon he went to his schooner, the <i>Dirkhoeven</i>, which  is anchored in the river. I could not follow him there, but I saw him  speaking on the deck to a man who did not look like a sailor. They were  there only a minute, then they went into the cabin, and when Mynheer  Van Zoon came ashore he came alone."    
"And the man who did not look like a sailor was left on the ship. It may  mean nothing, or it may mean anything, but my mind tells me it hath an  unpleasant significance. Now, I wish I knew this man who is lying hid in  the <i>Dirkhoeven</i>. Perhaps it would be better, Jacobus, to instruct Peter  to follow the lad, Lennox, and give the alarm if any threat or menace  appears."    
"I think it is the wiser course, Benjamin, and I will even instruct  Peter in such manner."    
He spoke a few sentences to Peter, who listened with eagerness,  apparently delighted with the task set for him. When Mynheer Huysman had  finished the lad slipped out at a back door, and was gone like a shadow.    
"An admirable youth for our purpose," said Mynheer Jacobus Huysman. "He  likes not work, but if he is to watch or follow anyone he hangs on like  a hound. In Albany he will become the second self of young Lennox, whose  first self will not know that he has a second self."    
They returned to the portico. Robert glanced curiously at them, but not  one of the three offered any explanation. He knew, however, that their  guarded talk with Peter had to do with himself, and he felt a great  emotion of gratitude. If he was surrounded by dangers he was also  surrounded by powerful friends. If chance had put him on the outskirts  of the world it had also given him comrades who were an armor of steel  about him.    
Tayoga and he occupied their old bedroom at Mynheer Jacobus Huysman's  that night, and once when Robert glanced out of the window he caught a  glimpse of a dark figure lurking in the shrubbery. It was a man who did  not look like a sailor, but as he did not know of the conversation in  the inner room the shadow attracted little attention from him. It  disappeared in an instant, and he thought no more about it.    
Robert and his comrades were back in the camp next day, and now they saw  Colonel Johnson at his best, a man of wonderful understanding and tact.  He was soon able to break through the reserve of the New England citizen  officers who were not wont to give their confidence in a hurry, and  around great bowls of lemon punch they talked of the campaign. The  Mohawks, as of old, told him all their grievances, which he remedied  when just, and persuaded them into forgetting when unjust.    
Robert, Tayoga and Willet, in their capacity of scouts and skirmishers,  could go about practically as they pleased. Colonel Johnson trusted them  absolutely and they talked of striking out into the wilderness on a new  expedition to see what lay ahead of the army. Adrian Van Zoon, they  learned definitely, had started for New York on the <i>Dirkhoeven</i>, and  Robert felt relief. Yet the lank lad, Peter, still followed him, and, as  had been predicted truly, was his second self, although his first self  did not know it.    
He had been at Albany several days when he returned alone from the flats  to the town late one evening. At a dark turn in the road he heard a  report, and a bullet whistled very near him. It was followed quickly by  a second report, but not by the whistling of any bullet. He had a pair  of pistols in his belt, and, taking out one and cocking it, he searched  the woods, though he found nothing. He concluded then that it was a  random bullet fired by some returning hunter, and that the second shot  was doubtless of the same character. But the first hunter had been  uncommonly careless and he hastened his steps from a locality which had  been so dangerous, even accidentally.    
Inured, however, as he was to risks, the incident soon passed entirely  out of his mind. Yet an hour or two later the lad, Peter, sat in a back  room with Mynheer Jacobus Huysman, and told him with relish of the  occurrence at the dark turn of the road.    
"I was fifty or sixty yards behind in the shadow of the trees," he said.  "I could see Master Lennox very well, though he could not see me. The  figure of a man appeared in the woods near me and aimed a pistol at  Master Lennox. I could not see his face well, but I knew it was the man  on the boat who was talking to Mynheer Van Zoon. I uttered a cry which  did not reach Master Lennox, but which did reach the man with the  pistol. It disturbed his aim, and his bullet flew wide. Then I fired at  him, but if I touched him at all it was but lightly. He made off through  the woods and I followed, but his speed was so great I could not  overtake him."    
"You haf done well, Peter. Doubtless you haf saved the life of young  Master Lennox, which was the task set for you to do. But it iss not  enough. You may haf to save it a second und yet a third time."    
The pale blue eyes of Peter glistened. Obviously he liked his present  task much better than the doing of chores.    
"You can trust me, Mynheer Huysman," he said importantly. "I will guard  him, and I will do more. Is there anybody you want killed?"    
"No, no, you young savage! You are to shoot only in self-defense, or in  defense of young Lennox whom you are to protect. Bear that in mind."    
"Very well, Mynheer. Your orders are law to me."    
Peter went out of the room and slid away in the darkness. Mynheer  Jacobus Huysman watched his departure and sighed. He was a good man,  averse to violence and bloodshed, and he murmured:    
"The world iss in a fever. The nations fight among themselves und even  the lads talk lightly of taking life."    
Peter reported to him again the next night, when Robert was safely in  bed.    
"I followed Master Lennox to the parade ground again," he said. "The  Onondaga, Tayoga, the hunter, Willet, and the Englishman, Grosvenor,  were with him. They watched the drill for a while, and spoke with  Colonel Johnson. Then Master Lennox wandered away alone to the north  edge of the drill ground, where there are some woods. Since I have  received your instructions, Mynheer, I always examine the woods, and I  found in them a man who might have been in hiding, or who might have  been lying there for the sake of the shade, only I am quite sure it was  not the latter. Just when Master Lennox came into his view I spoke to  him, and he seemed quite angry. He asked me impatiently to go away, but  I stood by and talked to him until Master Lennox was far out of sight."    
"You saw the man well, then, Peter?"    
"I did, Mynheer Huysman, and I cannot be mistaken. It was the same that  talked with Mynheer Van Zoon on the deck of the <i>Dirkkoeven</i>."    
"I thought so. And what kind of a looking man was he, Peter?"    
"About thirty, I should say, Mynheer, well built and strong, and  foreign."    
"Foreign! What mean you, Peter?"    
"French."    
"What? French of France or French of Canada?"    
"That I cannot say with certainty, Mynheer, but French he was I do  believe and maintain."    
"Then he must be a spy as well as a threat to young Lennox. This goes  deeper than I had thought, but you haf done your work well, Peter.  Continue it."    
He held out a gold coin, which Peter pocketed with thanks, and went  forth the next morning to resume with a proud heart the task that he  liked.    
Robert, all unconscious that a faithful guardian was always at his  heels, was passing days full of color, variety and pleasure. Admission  into the society of Albany was easy to one of his manner and appearance,  who had also such powerful friends, and there were pleasant evenings in  the solid Dutch houses. But he knew they could not last long. Daganoweda  and a chosen group of his Mohawks came back, reporting the French and  Indian force to be far larger than the one that had defeated Braddock by  Duquesne, and that Baron Dieskau who led it was considered a fine  general. Unless Waraiyageh made up his mind to strike quickly Dieskau  would strike first.    
The new French and Indian army, Daganoweda said, numbered eight thousand  men, a great force for the time, and for the New World, and it would be  both preceded and followed by clouds of skirmishers, savages from the  regions of the Great Lakes and even from beyond. They were flushed with  victory, with the mighty taking of scalps, at Braddock's defeat, and  they expected here in the north a victory yet greater. They were already  assuming control of Champlain and George, the two lakes which from time  immemorial, long before the coming of the white man, had formed the line  of march between what had become the French colonies and the British  colonies. It was equally vital now to possess this passage. Whoever  became the rulers of the lakes might determine in their favor the issue  of the war in America, and the youths in Johnson's army were eager to go  forward at once and fight for the coveted positions.    
But further delay was necessary. The commander still had the difficult  task of harmonizing the provincial governors and legislatures, and he  also made many presents to the Indians to bind them to the cause. Five  of the Six Nations, alarmed by the French successes and the slowness of  the Americans and English, still held neutral, but the Mohawks were full  of zeal, and the best of their young chiefs and warriors stood by  Johnson, ready to march when he marched, and to cover his van with their  skirmishers and patrols.    
Meanwhile the army drilled incessantly. The little troop of  Philadelphians under Colden, Wilton and Carson were an example. They  had seen much hard service already, although they spoke modestly of the  dangers over which they had triumphed in the forest. It was their pride,  too, to keep their uniforms neat, and to be as soldierly in manner as  possible. They had the look of regulars, and Grosvenor, the young  Englishman who had been taken on Colonel Johnson's staff, spoke of them  as such.    
New York and the four New England Colonies, whatever their lack of  cooperation, showed energy. The governors issued proclamations, and if  not enough men came, more were drafted from the regiments of militia.  Bounties of six dollars for every soldier were offered by Massachusetts,  and that valiant colony, as usual, led the way in energy.    
They were full days for Robert. He listened almost incessantly to the  sound of drum and fife, the drill master's word of command, or to voices  raised in prayer, preaching or the singing of psalms. Recruits were  continually coming in, awkward plowboys, but brave and enduring, waiting  only to be taught. Master Benjamin Hardy was compelled to return to New  York, departing with reluctance and holding an earnest conference with  Mynheer Jacobus Huysman before he went.    
"The man, who is most certainly a French spy, is somewhere about," said  Mynheer Jacobus. "Peter haf seen him twice more, but he haf caught only  glimpses. But you can trust Peter even as I do. His whole heart iss in  the task I have set him. He wass born Dutch but hiss soul iss Iroquois!  He iss by nature a taker of scalps."    
Master Benjamin laughed.    
"Just at present," he said, "'tis the nature that suits us best. Most  urgent business calls me back to New York, and, after all, I can't do  more here than you are doing, old friend."    
When they had bidden each other good-by in the undemonstrative manner of  elderly men who have long been friends, Master Jacobus strolled down the  main street of Albany and took a long look at a substantial house  standing in fine grounds. Then he shook his head several times, and,  walking on, met its owner, whom he greeted with marked coolness,  although the manner of the other toward him had been somewhat effusive.    
"I gif you good day, Hendrik Martinus," he said, "und I hear that you  are prospering. I am not one to notice fashions myself, but others haf  spoken to me of the beautiful new shawls your daughters are wearing und  of the brooches und necklaces they haf."    
The face of Martinus, a man of about fifty, turned a deep red, but the  excessive color passed in a few moments, and he spoke carelessly. In  truth, his whole manner was lighter and more agile than that of the  average man of Dutch blood.    
"I am not so sure, Mynheer Jacobus, that you did not take notice  yourself," he said. "Mynheer Jacobus is grave and dignified, but many a  grave and dignified man has a wary eye for the ladies."    
Mynheer Jacobus Huysman frowned.    
"And as for shawls and brooches and necklaces," continued Martinus, "it  is well known that war brings legitimate profits to many men. It makes  trade in certain commodities brisk. Now I'd willingly wager that your  friend, Master Benjamin Hardy, whom you have just seen on his way to New  York, will be much the richer by this war."    
"Master Hardy has ships upon the seas, and important contracts for the  troops."    
"I have no ships upon the seas, but I may have contracts, too."    
"It may well be so, Hendrik," said Mynheer Jacobus, and without another  word he passed on. When he had gone a hundred yards he shook himself  violently, and when he had gone another hundred yards he gave himself a  second shake of equal vigor. An hour later he was in the back room  talking with the lad, Peter.    
"Peter," he said, "you haf learned to take naps in the day und to keep  awake all through the night?"    
"Yes, Mynheer," replied Peter, proudly.    
"Then, Peter, you vass an owl, a watcher in the dark."    
"Yes, Mynheer."    
"Und I gif you praise for watching well, Peter, und also gold, which iss  much more solid than praise. Now I gif you by und by more praise und  more gold which iss still more solid than praise. The lad, Robert  Lennox, will be here early tonight to take supper with me, und I will  see that he does not go out again before the morrow. Now, do you, Peter,  watch the house of Hendrik Martinus all night und tell me if anyone  comes out or goes in, und who und what he may be, as nearly as you can."    
"Yes, Mynheer," said Peter, and a sudden light flickered in the pale  blue eyes.    
No further instructions were needed. He left the house in silence, and  Mynheer Jacobus Huysman trusted him absolutely.
