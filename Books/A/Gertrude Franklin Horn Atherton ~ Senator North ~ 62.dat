The Senate adjourned a few moments after Betty left the gallery. There  was little conversation in the cloak-room. The Senators were very  tired, and it surely was a brain of bubbles that could indulge in  comment upon the climax of the great finished chapter of the old  Republic.    
North put on his hat and overcoat at once and left the Capitol. After  the close confinement in heated and vitiated air for sixteen hours,  the thought of a cab was intolerable: he shook his head at the old  darky who owned him and whom he never had been able to dodge during  his twenty years' service in Washington, plunged his hands into his  overcoat pockets, and strode off with an air of aggressive  determination which amused him as a fitting anti-climax. The darky  grinned and drove home without looking for another fare. His Senator  not only had paid him by the month for several years, but had  supported his family for the last ten.    
North inhaled the pure cool air, the delicious perfume of violet and  magnolia, as Betty had done. Once he paused and looked up at the  wooded heights surrounding the city, then down at the Potomac and the  great expanse of roofs and leaves. The Washington Monument, the  purest, coldest, most impersonal monument on earth, looked as gray as  the sky, but its outlines were as sharp as at noonday. North often  watched it from the window of his Committee Room; he had seen it rosy  with the mists of sunset, as dark as granite under stormy skies, as  waxen as death. Normally, it was white and pure and inspiring, never  companionable, but helpful in its cold and lofty beauty.    
"It <i>is</i> a monument," he thought, to-night, "and to more than  Washington."    
He turned into Massachusetts Avenue and strolled along, in no hurry to  find himself between walls again. He was not conscious of physical  fatigue, and experienced no longing for bed, but his brain was tired  and he enjoyed the absence of enforced companionship and continued  alertness, the cool air, the quiet morning in her last sleep.    
Betty, like all brilliant women who love passionately, had over-  imagined, in her solitude and excitement. It is true that North had  felt the bitterness of defeat, that his mind had dwelt upon the  miserable and blasting thought that after years of unquestioned  statesmanship and leadership, of hard work and unremitting devotion,  his will had had no weight against hysteria and delirium. But both  bitterness and the sense of failure had been dismissed in the moment  when he had, once for all, accepted the situation; and that had been  several days before. Since then, he had shoved aside the past, and had  given his undivided thought to the present and the future. He had  uttered his "aye" almost indifferently; it had been given to the  President days since.    
Nevertheless, his brain, tired as it was, did not wander from the  great climax in his country's history. To that country at large this  climax meant simply a brief and arrogant chastisement of a cruel  little nation; the generals would have been quite justified in sending  their dress clothes and golf sticks on to Havana; but North knew that  this officious "police duty" was the noisy prologue to a new United  States, possibly to the birth of a new Constitution.    
"Is this the grand finale of the people's rule?" he thought. "They  have screamed for the moon as they never screamed before, and this  time they have got it fairly between their teeth. Well, it is a dead  old planet; will its decay vitiate their own blood and leave them the  half-willing prey of a Circumstance they do not dream of now? Dewey  will take the Philippines, of course. He would be an inefficient fool  if he did not, and he is the reverse. The Spanish in Cuba will crumble  almost before the world realizes that the war has begun. The United  States will find itself sitting open-mouthed with two huge prizes in  its lap. It may, in a fit of virtue which would convulse history, give  them back, present them, with much good advice and more rhetoric, to  their rightful owners. And it may not. These prizes are crusted with  gold; and the stars and stripes will look so well in the breeze above  that the pride of patriotism may decide they must remain there. And if  it does--if it does... The extremists in the Senate will grow twenty  years in one... With the bit between their teeth and the arrogance  of triumph in their blood--"    
He found himself in front of his own house. He turned slowly and  looked intently for a moment toward I Street. His face softened, then  he jerked out his latchkey, let himself in and went directly to the  library. He still had no desire for bed, and threw himself into an  easy-chair before the andirons. But it was the first time in several  days that he had sat in a luxurious chair, and the room was full of  soft warmth. He fell asleep, and although he seemed to awaken  immediately, he could only conclude, when the experience which  followed was over, that he had been dreaming.    
He suddenly became aware that a chair beside him was occupied, and he  wheeled about sharply. His sense of companionship was justified; a man  sat there. North stared at him, more puzzled than surprised,  endeavouring to fit the familiar face to some name on his long list of  acquaintances, and wondering who in Washington could have given a  fancy-dress ball that night. His visitor wore his hair in a queue and  powdered, a stock of soft lawn, and a dress-coat of plum-coloured  cloth cut as in the days of the founders of the Republic.    
Although it was some moments before North recognized his visitor, his  resentment at this unseasonable intrusion passed quickly; the  personality in the chair was so charming, so magnetic, so genial. He  was a young man, between thirty and forty, with a long nose, a mobile  mouth, dark gray-blue eyes full of fire and humour, and a massive  head. It was a face of extraordinary power and intellect, but lit up  by a spirit so audacious and impulsive and triumphant that it was  like a leaping flame of dazzling brilliancy in some forbidding  fortress. He was smiling with a delighted expression of good  fellowship; but North experienced a profound conviction that the man  was weighing and analyzing him, that he would weigh and analyze  everybody with whom he came in contact, and make few mistakes.    
"Who the deuce can he be?" he thought, "and why doesn't he speak?" And  then it occurred to him that he had not spoken, himself. He was about  to inquire with somewhat perfunctory courtesy in what manner he could  serve his visitor, when his glance fell on the man's hands. He sat  erect with a slight exclamation and experienced a stiffening at the  roots of his hair. The hands under the lace ruffles were the most  beautiful that ever had been given to a man, even to as small a man as  this. They were white and strong and delicate, with pointed fingers  wide apart, and filbert nails. North knew them well, for they were the  hands of the man whom he admired above all men in the history of his  country. But until to-night he had seen them on canvas only, in the  Treasury Department of the United States. His feeling of terror  passed, and he sat forward eagerly.    
"The little lion," he said caressingly, for the man before him might  have been his son, although he had been in his tomb with a bullet in  his heart for nearly a century. But he looked so young, so restless,  so indomitable, that the years slipped out of the century, and  Hamilton once more was the most brilliant ornament of a country which  had never ceased to need him.    
"Yes," he said brightly, "here I am, sir, and you see me at last. This  is that one moment in the lifetime of the few when the spirit burns  through the flesh and recognizes another spirit who has lost that dear  and necessary medium. I have been with you a great deal in your life,  but you never have been able to see me until to-night." He gave his  head an impatient toss. "How I have wished I were alive during the  last three or four months!" he exclaimed. "Not that I could have  accomplished what you could not, sir, but it would have been such a  satisfaction to have been able to make the effort, and then, when I  failed, to tell democracy what I thought of it."    
North smiled. All sense of the supernatural had left him. His soul and  Hamilton's were face to face; that was the one glorified fact. "I have  been tempted several times lately to wish that we had your  aristocratic republic," he said, "and that I were the head and centre  of it. I have felt a strong desire to wring the neck of that many-  headed nuisance called 'the people,' and proceed as if it were where  the God of nations intended those incapable of governing should  be and remain without protest."    
"Oh, yes, you are an aristocrat. That is the reason I have enjoyed the  society of your mind all these years. You were so like me in many ways  when you were my age, and since then I seem to have grown older with  you. I died so young. But in you, in the last twenty years, I seem to  have lived on. You have built an iron wall all round those terrible  fires of your youth, and roofed it over. It is only now and then that  a panel melts and the flame leaps out; and the panel is so quickly  replaced! I too should have conquered myself like that and made fewer  and fewer mistakes."    
"God knows what I might not have been able to do for my country. I  have been mad to leap into the arena often enough."    
"You are not dead. No man is, whose inspiration lives on. More than  one of us would be of shorter stature and shorter gait if we never had  had your accomplishment to ponder over. And as to what the nation  would have been without you--"    
"Yes!" cried Hamilton. "Yes! How can any man of ability submit to  death without protest, shrug his shoulders cynically, and say that no  man's disappearance causes more than a whirl of bubbles on the  surface, that the world goes on its old gait undisturbed, and does as  well with the new as the old? Look at Great Britain. She hasn't a  single great man in all her eleven million square miles to lead her.  That is answer enough to a theory which some men are sincere enough in  believing. This country always has needed great leaders, and sometimes  she has had them and sometimes not. The time is coming when she will  need them as she has not done since the days when three or four of us  set her on her feet."    
North stood up suddenly and looked down on Hamilton. "What are we  coming to?" he asked abruptly. "Monarchy?"    
The guest tapped the toe of his little slipper with the tips of his  beautiful fingers. He laughed gayly. "I can see only a little farther  ahead than your own far-penetrating brain, sir. What do you think?"    
"As I walked home tonight, the situation possessed my mind, which by  some process of its own seemed to develop link after link in coming  events. It seemed to me that I saw a thoroughly disorganized people,  unthinkingly but ruthlessly thrusting aside all ideals, and--  consequently--in time--ready for anything."    
Hamilton nodded, "If they had begun with my ideal, they would have  remained there. Now they will leap far behind that--when there is a  strong enough man down there in the White House. Certain radical  changes, departures from their traditions and those of their fathers,  will school them for greater changes still. In some great critical  moment when a dictator seems necessary they will shrug their shoulders  and say, 'Why not?'"    
"I believe you are right, but I doubt if it comes in my time."    
Hamilton shook his head. "Every state in Europe has its upper lip  curled back above its teeth, and who knows, when the leashes snap,  what our fate will be, now that we have practically abandoned our  policy of non-interference in the affairs of the Eastern Hemisphere?  If all Europe is at somebody's throat in the next five years, we shall  not escape; be sure of that. Then will be the great man's opportunity.  You always have despised the office of President. Work for it from  this day. The reaction from this madness will help you. Democrats as  well as Republicans will turn to you as the one man worthy of the  confidence of the entire country."    
"Not if they guessed that I meditated treason, sir. Nor should I. I  agree with you that your ideal was the best, but there is nothing for  me to do but to make the best of the one I've inherited. If I am  aristocratic in my preferences, I am also a pretty thoroughgoing  American."    
"Yes, yes, I know, sir. You never will meditate what, if premeditated,  would be treason. But when the great moment comes, when your  patriotism and your statesmanship force you to admit that if the  country is to be saved it must be rescued from the people, and that  you alone can rescue it, then you will tear the Constitution down its  middle. This country is past amendments. It must begin over again. And  the whole great change must come from one man. The people never could  be got to vote for an aristocratic republic. They must be stunned into  accepting a monarchy. After the monarchy, then the real, the great  Republic."    
The two men looked long into each other's eyes. Then North said,--    
"I repeat that I never should work nor scheme for the position that  such a change might bring me. Nevertheless, believing, as I do, that  we are on the threshold of a new and entirely different era in this  country, if the time should come when I felt that I, as its most  highly trained servant, could best serve the United States by taking  her destinies entirely into my own hands, I should do so without an  instant's hesitation. I have done all I could to preserve the old  order for them, and they have called me traitor and gone their own  way. Now let them take the consequences."    
Hamilton set his mobile lips in a hard line. His eyes looked like  steel. "Yes," he said harshly, "let them take the consequences. They  had their day, they have gone mad with democracy, let them now die of  their own poison. The greatest Republic the world ever will have known  is only in the ante-room of its real history." He stood up suddenly  and held out his hand. "Good-bye, sir," he said. "We may or may not  meet again before you too are forced to abandon your work. But I often  shall be close to you, and I believe, I firmly believe, that you will  do exactly as I should do if I stood on solid ground to-day."    
North took the exquisite hand that had written the greatest state  papers of the century, and looked wonderingly at its white beauty. It  suddenly gave him the grip of an iron vise. North returned the  pressure. Then the strong hand melted from his, and he stood alone.    
Exactly in what the transition from sleep to waking consisted, North  was not able to define. There was a brief sense of change, including a  lifting of heavy eyelids. Technically he awoke. But he was standing on  the hearthrug. And his right hand ached.    
He shrugged his shoulders.    
"What difference does it make whether he appeared to my waking eyes or  passed through my sleeping brain and sat down with my soul?"    
He plunged his hands into his pockets and stood thinking for many  minutes. He said, half aloud, finally,--    
"Not in my time, perhaps. But it will come, it will come."
