  Gravois did not stay to see the effect of his last words. Only he   knew, as he went through the door, that her eyes were following him,   and that if he looked at her she would call him back. So he shut the   door quickly behind him, fearing that he had already said too much. 
  Cummins and Jan came in together at suppertime. The factor was in   high humor. An Indian from the Porcupine had brought in two silver fox   that morning, and he was immensely pleased at Jan's return&#8212;a   combination of incidents which put him in the best of moods. 
  M&eacute;lisse sat opposite Jan at the table. She had twisted a sprig of  red  bakneesh into her glossy braid, and a cluster of it nestled at her   throat, but Jan gave no sign that he had noticed this little favor,   which was meant entirely for him. He smiled at her, but there was a   clear coolness in the depths of his dark eyes which checked any of the   old familiarity on her part. 
  &quot;Has MacVeigh put in his new trap-line?&quot; Cummins inquired, after   asking Jan many questions about his trip. 
  &quot;I don't know,&quot; replied Jan. &quot;I didn't go to MacVeighs'.&quot; 
  Purposely he held his eyes from M&eacute;lisse. She understood his effort,   and a quick flush gathered in her cheeks. 
  &quot;It was MacVeigh who brought in word of you,&quot; persisted the factor,   oblivious of the effect of his questions. 
  &quot;I met him in the Cree Lake country, but he said nothing of his  trap-  lines.&quot; 
  He rose from the table with Cummins, and started to follow him from   the cabin. M&eacute;lisse came between. For a moment her hand rested upon his   arm. 
  &quot;You are going to stay with me, Jan,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I want your help   with the dishes, and then we're going to play on the violin.&quot; 
  She pulled him into a chair as Cummins left, and tied an apron  about  his shoulders. 
  &quot;Close your eyes&#8212;and don't move!&quot; she commanded, laughing into his   surprised face as she ran into her room. 
  A moment later she returned with one hand held behind her back. The   hot blood surged through Jan's veins when he felt her fingers running   gently through his long hair. There came the snip of scissors, a   little nervous laugh close to his head, and then again the snip, snip,   snip of the scissors. 
  &quot;It's terribly long, Jan!&quot; Her soft hand brushed his bearded cheek.   &quot;Ugh!&quot; she shuddered. &quot;You must take that off your face. If you  don't&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Why?&quot; he asked, through lack of anything else to say. 
  She lowered her head until her cheek pressed against his own. 
  &quot;Because it feels like bristles,&quot; she whispered. 
  She reddened fiercely when he remained silent, and the scissors   snipped more rapidly between her fingers. 
  &quot;I'm going to prospect the big swamp along the edge of the Barrens   this summer,&quot; he explained soon, laughing to relieve the tension. &quot;A   beard will protect me from the black flies.&quot; 
  &quot;You can grow another.&quot; 
  She took the apron from about his shoulders, and held it so that he   could see the result of her work. He looked up, smiling. 
  &quot;Thank you, M&eacute;lisse. Do you remember when you last cut my hair?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;it was over on the mountain. We had taken the scissors along  for  cutting bakneesh, and you looked so like a wild Indian that I made  you  sit on a rock and let me trim it.&quot; 
  &quot;And you cut my ear,&quot; he reminded. 
  &quot;For which you made me pay,&quot; she retorted quickly, almost under her   breath. 
  She went to the cupboard behind the stove, and brought out her   father's shaving-mug and razor. 
  &quot;I insist that you shall use them,&quot; she said, stirring the soap  into a  lather, and noting the indecision in his face. &quot;I am afraid of  you!&quot; 
  &quot;Afraid of me?&quot; 
  He stood for a moment in front of the little mirror, turning his  face  from side to side. M&eacute;lisse handed him the razor and cup. 
  &quot;You don't seem like the Jan that I used to know once upon a time.   There has been a great change in you since&#8212;since&#8212;&quot; 
  She hesitated. 
  &quot;Since when, M&eacute;lisse?&quot; 
  &quot;Since the day we came in from the mountain and I put up my hair.&quot;   With timid sweetness she added: &quot;I haven't had it up again, Jan.&quot; 
  She caught a glimpse of his lathered face in the glass, staring at  her  with big, seeking eyes. He turned them quickly away when he saw  that  she was looking, and M&eacute;lisse set to work at the dishes. She had  washed  them before he finished shaving. Then she took down the old  violin  from the wall and began to play, her low, sweet voice  accompanying the  instrument in a Cree melody which Iowaka had taught  her during Jan's  absence at Nelson House and the Wholdaia. 
  Surprised, he faced her, his eyes glowing as there fell from her  lips  the gentle love-song of a heart-broken Indian maiden, filled with  its  infinite sadness and despair. He knew the song. It was a lyric of  the  Crees. He had heard it before, but never as it came to him now,   sobbing its grief in the low notes of the violin, speaking to him with   immeasurable pathos from the trembling throat of M&eacute;lisse. 
  He stood silent until she had finished, staring down upon her bowed   head. When she lifted her eyes to him, he saw that her long lashes   were wet and glistening in the lamp-glow. 
  &quot;It is wonderful, M&eacute;lisse! You have made beautiful music for it.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Jan.&quot; 
  She played again, her voice humming with exquisite sweetness the   wordless music which he had taught her. At last she gave him the   violin. 
  &quot;Now you must play for me.&quot; 
  &quot;I have forgotten a great deal, M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  She was astonished to see how clumsily his brown fingers traveled  over  the strings. As she watched him, her heart thrilled uneasily. It  was  not the old Jan who was playing for her now, but a new Jan, whose  eyes  shone dull and passionless, in whom there was no stir of the old   spirit of the violin. He wandered listlessly from one thing to   another, and after a few minutes gave her the instrument again. 
  Without speaking, she rose from her chair and hung the violin upon  the  wall. 
  &quot;You must practise a great deal,&quot; she said quietly. 
  At her movement he, too, rose from his seat; and when she turned to   him again he had his cap in his hand. A flash of surprise shot into   her eyes. 
  &quot;Are you going so soon, Jan?&quot; 
  &quot;I am tired,&quot; he said in excuse. &quot;It has been two days since I have   slept, M&eacute;lisse. Good night!&quot; 
  He smiled at her from the door, but the &quot;Good night&quot; which fell  from  her lips was lifeless and unmeaning. Jan shivered when he went  out.  Under the cold stars he clenched his hands, knowing that he had  come  from the cabin none too soon. 
  Choking back the grief of this last meeting with M&eacute;lisse, he  crossed  to the company store. 
  It was late when Cummins returned home. M&eacute;lisse was still up. He   looked at her sharply over his shoulder as he hung up his coat and   hat. 
  &quot;Has anything come between you and Jan?&quot; he asked suddenly. &quot;Why  have  you been crying?&quot; 
  &quot;Sometimes the tears come when I am playing the violin, father. I  know  of nothing that has come between Jan and me, only I&#8212;I don't   understand&#8212;&quot; 
  She stopped, struggling hard to keep back the sobs that were  trembling  in her throat. 
  &quot;Neither do I understand,&quot; exclaimed the factor, going to the stove  to  light his pipe. &quot;He gave me his resignation as a paid servant of  the  company tonight!&quot; 
  &quot;He is not going&#8212;to leave&#8212;the post?&quot; breathed M&eacute;lisse. 
  &quot;He is leaving the service,&quot; reiterated her father. &quot;That means he  can  not long live at Lac Bain. He says he is going into the woods,  perhaps  into Jean's country of the Athabasca. Has he told you more?&quot; 
  &quot;Nothing,&quot; said M&eacute;lisse. 
  She was upon her knees in front of the little bookcase. A blinding   film burned in her eyes. She caught her breath, struggling hard to   master herself before she faced her father again. For a moment the   factor went into his room, and she took this opportunity of slipping   into her own, calling &quot;Good night&quot; to him from the partly closed door. 
  The next day it was Croisset who went along the edge of the Barrens   for meat. Gravois found Jan filling a new shoulder-pack with supplies.   It was their first encounter since he had learned that Jan had given   up the service. 
  &quot;Diable!&quot; he fairly hissed, standing over him as he packed his  flour  and salt in a rubber bag. &quot;Diable, I say, M. Jan Thoreau!&quot; 
  Jan looked up, smiling, to see the little Frenchman fairly  quivering  with rage. 
  &quot;Bon jour, M. Jean de Gravois!&quot; he laughed back. &quot;You see I am  going  out among the foxes.&quot; 
  &quot;The devils!&quot; snapped Jean. 
  &quot;No, the foxes, my dear Jean. I am tired of the post. I can make   better wage for my time in the swamps to the west. Think of it, Jean!   It has been many years since you have trapped there, and the foxes   must be eating up the country!&quot; 
  Jean's thin lips were almost snarling. &quot;Blessed saints, and it was  I  who&#8212;&quot; 
  He spun upon his heels without another word, and went straight to   M&eacute;lisse. 
  &quot;Jan Thoreau is going to leave the post,&quot; he announced fiercely,   throwing out his chest and glaring at her accusingly. 
  &quot;So father has told me,&quot; said M&eacute;lisse. 
  Her cheeks were colorless, and there were purplish lines under her   eyes, but she spoke with exceeding calmness. 
  &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; exclaimed Jean, whirling again, &quot;you take it coolly!&quot; 
  A little later M&eacute;lisse saw Jan coming from the store. When he  entered  the cabin his dark face betrayed the strain under which he was   laboring, but his voice was unnaturally calm. 
  &quot;I have come to say good-by, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he said. &quot;I am going to   prospect for a good trap-line among the Barrens.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope you will have good luck, Jan.&quot; 
  In her voice, too, was a firmness almost metallic. 
  For the first time in his life Jan held out his hand to her. She   started, and for an instant the blood surged from her heart to her   face. Then she gave him her own and looked him squarely and   unflinchingly in the eyes. 
  &quot;Will you wait a moment?&quot; she asked. 
  She hurried into her room, and scarcely had she gone before she   reappeared again, this time with a flush burning in her cheeks and her   eyes shining brightly. She had unbraided her hair, and it lay coiled   upon the crown of her head, glistening with crimson sprigs of   bakneesh. She came to him a second time, and once more gave him her   hand. 
  &quot;I don't suppose you care now,&quot; she said coldly, and yet laughing  in  his face. &quot;I have not broken my promise. It was silly, wasn't it?&quot; 
  He felt as if his blood had been suddenly chilled to water, and he   fought to choke back the thick throbbing in his throat. 
  &quot;You promised&#8212;&quot; He could not go further. 
  &quot;I promised that I would not do up my hair again until you had   forgotten to love me,&quot; she finished for him. &quot;I will do it up now.&quot; 
  He bowed his head, and she could see his shoulders quiver under  their  thick caribou coat. Her tense lips parted, and she raised her  arms as  if on the point of stretching them out to him; but his voice  came  evenly, without a quiver, yet filled with the dispassionate truth  of  what he spoke. 
  &quot;I have not forgotten to love you, M&eacute;lisse. I shall never cease to   love my little sister. But you are older now, and it is time for you   to do up your hair.&quot; 
  He turned, without looking at her again, leaving her standing with  her  arms still half stretched out to him, and went from the cabin. 
  &quot;Good-by, Jan!&quot; 
  The words fell in a sobbing whisper from her, but he had gone too  far  to hear. Through the window she saw him shake hands with Cummins  in  front of the company's store. She watched him as he went to the  cabin  of Iowaka and Jean. Then she saw him shoulder his pack, and,  with  bowed head, disappear slowly into the depths of the black spruce   forest.
