  Until the present moment Rod had forgotten to speak of the  mysterious man-trail he had encountered in the chasm. The excitement of  the past hour had made him oblivious to all other things, but now as  they ate their dinner he described the strange maneuvers of the spying  Woonga. He did not, however, voice those fears which had come to him in  the gorge, preferring to allow Mukoki and Wabigoon to draw their own  conclusions. By this time the two Indians were satisfied that the  Woongas were not contemplating attack, but that for some unaccountable  reason they were as anxious to evade the hunters as the hunters were to  evade them. Everything that had passed seemed to give evidence of this.  The outlaw in the chasm, for instance, could easily have waylaid Rod; a  dozen times the almost defenseless camp could have been attacked, and  there were innumerable places where ambushes might have been laid for  them along the trap-lines.
  So Rod's experience with the Woonga trail between the mountains  occasioned little uneasiness, and instead of forming a scheme for the  further investigation of this trail on the south, plans were made for  locating the first fall. Mukoki was the swiftest and most tireless  traveler on snow-shoes, and it was he who volunteered to make the first  search. He would leave the following morning, taking with him a supply  of food, and during his absence Rod and Wabigoon would attend to the  traps.
  &#8220;We must have the location of the first fall before we return to the  Post,&#8221; declared Wabi. &#8220;If from that we find that the third fall is not  within a hundred miles of our present camp it will be impossible for us  to go in search of our gold during this trip. In that event we shall  have to go back to Wabinosh House and form a new expedition, with fresh  supplies and the proper kind of tools. We can not do anything until the  spring freshets are over, anyway.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have been thinking of that,&#8221; replied Rod, his eyes softening.  &#8220;You know mother is alone, and&#8212;her&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I understand,&#8221; interrupted the Indian boy, laying a hand fondly  across his companion's arm.
  &#8220;&#8212;her funds are small, you know,&#8221; Rod finished. &#8220;If she has been  sick&#8212;or&#8212;anything like that&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, we've got to get back with our furs,&#8221; helped Wabi, a tremor of  tenderness in his own voice. &#8220;And if you don't mind, Rod, I might take  a little run down to Detroit with you. Do you suppose she would care?&#8221;
  &#8220;Care!&#8221; shouted Rod, bringing his free hand down upon Wabi's arm  with a force that hurt. &#8220;Care! Why, she thinks as much of you as she  does of me, Wabi! She'd be tickled to death! Do you mean it?&#8221;
  Wabi's bronzed face flushed a deeper red at his friend's enthusiasm.
  &#8220;I won't promise&#8212;for sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I'd like to see  her&#8212;almost as much as you, I guess. If I can, I'll go.&#8221;
  Rod's face was suffused with a joyful glow.
  &#8220;And I'll come back with you early in the summer and we'll start out  for the gold,&#8221; he cried. He jumped to his feet and slapped Mukoki on  the back in the happy turn his mind had taken. &#8220;Will you come, too,  Mukoki? I'll give you the biggest 'city time' you ever had in your  life!&#8221;
  The old Indian grinned and chuckled and grunted, but did not reply  in words. Wabi laughed, and answered for him.
  &#8220;He is too anxious to become Minnetaki's slave again, Rod. No, Muky  won't go, I'll wager that. He will stay at the Post to see that she  doesn't get lost, or hurt, or stolen by the Woongas. Eh, Mukoki?&#8221;  Mukoki nodded, grinning good-humoredly. He went to the door, opened it  and looked out.
  &#8220;Devil&#8212;she snow!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;She snow like twent' t'ousand&#8212;like  devil!&#8221;
  This was the strongest English in the old warrior's vocabulary, and  it meant something more than usual. Wabi and Rod quickly joined him.  Never in his life had the city youth seen a snow-storm like that which  he now gazed out into. The great north storm had arrived&#8212;a storm which  comes just once each year in the endless Arctic desolation. For days  and weeks the Indians had expected it and wondered at its lateness. It  fell softly, silently, without a breath of air to stir it; a  smothering, voiceless sea of white, impenetrable to human vision, so  thick that it seemed as though it might stifle one's breath. Rod held  out the palm of his hand and in an instant it was covered with a film  of white. He walked out into it, and a dozen yards away he became a  ghostly, almost invisible shadow.
  When he came back a minute later he brought a load of snow into the  cabin with him.
  All that afternoon the snow fell like this, and all that night the  storm continued. When he awoke in the morning Rod heard the wind  whistling and howling through the trees and around the ends of the  cabin. He rose and built the fire while the others were still sleeping.  He attempted to open the door, but it was blocked. He lowered the  barricade at the window, and a barrel of snow tumbled in about his  feet. He could see no sign of day, and when he turned he saw Wabi  sitting up in his blankets, laughing silently at his wonder and  consternation.
  &#8220;What in the world&#8212;&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;We're snowed in,&#8221; grinned Wabi. &#8220;Does the stove smoke?&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; replied Rod, throwing a bewildered glance at the roaring fire.  &#8220;You don't mean to say&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we are not completely, buried,&#8221; interrupted the other. &#8220;At  least the top of the chimney is sticking out!&#8221;
  Mukoki sat up and stretched himself.
  &#8220;She blow,&#8221; he said, as a tremendous howl of wind swept over the  cabin. &#8220;Bime-by she blow some more!&#8221;
  Rod shoveled the snow into a corner and replaced the barricade while  his companions dressed.
  &#8220;This means a week's work digging out traps,&#8221; declared Wabi. &#8220;And  only Mukoki's Great Spirit, who sends all blessings to this country,  knows when the blizzard is going to stop. It may last a week. There is  no chance of finding our waterfall in this.&#8221;
  &#8220;We can play dominoes,&#8221; suggested Rod cheerfully. &#8220;You remember we  haven't finished that series we began at the Post. But you don't expect  me to believe that it snowed enough yesterday afternoon and last night  to cover this cabin, do you?&#8221;
  &#8220;It didn't exactly<I> snow</I> enough to cover it,&#8221; explained his  comrade. &#8220;But we're covered for all of that. The cabin is on the edge  of an open, and of course the snow just naturally drifts around us,  blown there by the wind. If this blizzard keeps up we shall be under a  small mountain by night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't it&#8212;smother us?&#8221; faltered Rod.
  Wabi gave a joyous whoop of merriment at the city-bred youth's  half-expressed fear and a volley of Mukoki's chuckles came from where  he was slicing moose-steak on the table.
  &#8220;Snow mighty nice thing live under,&#8221; he asserted with emphasis.
  &#8220;If you were under a mountain of snow you could live, if you weren't  crushed to death,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;Snow is filled with air. Mukoki was  caught under a snow-slide once and was buried under thirty feet for ten  hours. He had made a nest about as big as a barrel and was nice and  comfortable when we dug him out. We won't have to burn much wood to  keep warm now.&#8221;
  After breakfast the boys again lowered the barricade at the window  and Wabi began to bring small avalanches of snow down into the cabin  with his shovel. At the third or fourth upward thrust a huge mass  plunged through the window, burying them to the waist, and when they  looked out they could see the light of day and the whirling blizzard  above their heads.
  &#8220;It's up to the roof,&#8221; gasped Rod. &#8220;Great Scott, what a snow-storm!&#8221;
  &#8220;Now for some fun!&#8221; cried the Indian youth. &#8220;Come on, Rod, if you  want to be in it.&#8221;
  He crawled through the window into the cavity he had made in the  drift, and Rod followed. Wabi waited, a mischievous smile on his face,  and no sooner had his companion joined him than he plunged his shovel  deep into the base of the drift. Half a dozen quick thrusts and there  tumbled down upon their heads a mass of light snow that for a few  moments completely buried them. The suddenness of it knocked Rod to his  knees, where he floundered, gasped and made a vain effort to yell.  Struggling like a fish he first kicked his feet free, and Wabi, who had  thrust out his head and shoulders, shrieked with laughter as he saw  only Rod's boots sticking out of the snow.
  &#8220;You're going the wrong way, Rod!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Wow&#8212;wow!&#8221;
  He seized his companion's legs and helped to drag him out, and then  stood shaking, the tears streaming down his face, and continued to  laugh until he leaned back in the drift, half exhausted. Rod was a  curious and ludicrous-looking object. His eyes were wide and blinking;  the snow was in his ears, his mouth, and in his floundering he had  packed his coat collar full of it. Slowly he recovered from his  astonishment, saw Wabi and Mukoki quivering with laughter, grinned&#8212;and  then joined them in their merriment.
  It was not difficult now for the boys to force their way through the  drift and they were soon standing waist-deep in the snow twenty yards  from the cabin.
  &#8220;The snow is only about four feet deep in the open,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;But  look at that!&#8221;
  He turned and gazed at the cabin, or rather at the small part of it  which still rose triumphant above the huge drift which had almost  completely buried it. Only a little of the roof, with the smoking  chimney rising out of it, was to be seen. Rod now turned in all  directions to survey the wild scene about him. There had come a brief  lull in the blizzard, and his vision extended beyond the lake and to  the hilltop. There was not a spot of black to meet his eyes; every rock  was hidden; the trees hung silent and lifeless under their heavy  mantles and even their trunks were beaten white with the clinging  volleys of the storm. There came to him then a thought of the wild  things in this seemingly uninhabitable desolation. How could they live  in this endless desert of snow? What could they find to eat? Where  could they find water to drink? He asked Wabi these questions after  they had returned to the cabin.
  &#8220;Just now, if you traveled from here to the end of this storm zone  you wouldn't find a living four-legged creature,&#8221; said Wabigoon. &#8220;Every  moose in this country, every deer and caribou, every fox and wolf, is  buried in the snow. And as the snow falls deeper about them the warmer  and more comfortable do they become, so that even as the blizzard  increases in fury the kind Creator makes it easier for them to bear.  When the storm ceases the wilderness will awaken into life again. The  moose and deer and caribou will rise from their snow-beds and begin to  eat the boughs of trees and saplings; a crust will have formed on the  snow, and all the smaller animals, like foxes, lynx and wolves, will  begin to travel again, and to prey upon others for food. Until they  find running water again snow and ice take the place of liquid drink;  warm caverns dug in the snow give refuge in place of thick swamp moss  and brush and leaves. All the big animals, like moose, deer and  caribou, will soon make 'yards' for themselves by trampling down large  areas of snow, and in these yards they will gather in big herds, eating  their way through the forests, fighting the wolves and waiting for  spring. Oh, life isn't altogether bad for the animals in a deep winter  like this!&#8221;
  Until noon the hunters were busy cleaning away the snow from the  cabin door. As the day advanced the blizzard increased in its fury,  until, with the approach of night, it became impossible for the hunters  to expose themselves to it. For three days the storm continued with  only intermittent lulls, but with the dawn of the fourth day the sky  was again cloudless, and the sun rose with a blinding effulgence. Rod  now found himself suffering from that sure affliction of every  tenderfoot in the far North&#8212;snow-blindness. For only a few minutes at  a time could he stand the dazzling reflections of the snow-waste where  nothing but white, flashing, scintillating white, seemingly a vast sea  of burning electric points in the sunlight, met his aching eyes. On the  second day after the storm, while Wabi was still inuring Rod to the  changed world and teaching him how to accustom his eyes to it  gradually, Mukoki left the cabin to follow the chasm in his search for  the first waterfall.
  That same day Wabi began his work of digging out and resetting the  traps, but it was not until the day following that Rod's eyes would  allow him to assist. The task was a most difficult one; rocks and other  landmarks were completely hidden, and the lost traps averaged one out  of four. It was not until the end of the second day after Mukoki's  departure that the young hunters finished the mountain trap-line, and  when they turned their faces toward camp just at the beginning of dusk  it was with the expectant hope that they would find the old Indian  awaiting them. But Mukoki had not returned. The next day came and  passed, and a fourth dawned without his arrival. Hope now gave way to  fear. In three days Mukoki could travel nearly a hundred miles. Was it  possible that something had happened to him? Many times there recurred  to Rod a thought of the Woonga in the chasm. Had the mysterious spy, or  some of his people, waylaid and killed him?
  Neither of the hunters had a desire to leave camp during the fourth  day. Trapping was exceptionally good now on account of the scarcity of  animal food and since the big storm they had captured a wolf, two lynx,  a red fox and eight mink. But as Mukoki's absence lengthened their  enthusiasm grew less.
  In the afternoon, as they were watching, they saw a figure climb  wearily to the summit of the hill.
  It was Mukoki.
  With shouts of greeting both youths hurried through the snow toward  him, not taking time to strap on their snow-shoes. The old Indian was  at their side a couple of minutes later. He smiled in a tired  good-natured way, and answered the eagerness in their eyes with a nod  of his head.
  &#8220;Found fall. Fift' mile down mountain.&#8221;
  Once in the cabin he dropped into a chair, exhausted, and both Rod  and Wabigoon joined in relieving him of his boots and outer garments.  It was evident that Mukoki had been traveling hard, for only once or  twice before in his life had Wabi seen him so completely fatigued.  Quickly the young Indian had a huge steak broiling over the fire, and  Rod put an extra handful of coffee in the pot.
  &#8220;Fifty miles!&#8221; ejaculated Wabi for the twentieth time. &#8220;It was an  awful jaunt, wasn't it, Muky?&#8221;
  &#8220;Rough&#8212;rough like devil th'ough mountains,&#8221; replied Mukoki. &#8220;Not  like that!&#8221; He swung an arm in the direction of the chasm.
  Rod stood silent, open-eyed with wonder. Was it possible that the  old warrior had discovered a wilder country than that through which he  had passed in the chasm?
  &#8220;She little fall,&#8221; went on Mukoki, brightening as the odor of coffee  and meat filled his nostrils. &#8220;No bigger than&#8212;that!&#8221; He pointed to the  roof of the cabin.
  Rod was figuring on the table. Soon he looked up.
  &#8220;According to Mukoki and the map we are at least two hundred and  fifty miles from the third fall,&#8221; he said.
  Mukoki shrugged his shoulders and his face was crinkled in a  suggestive grimace.
  &#8220;Hudson Bay,&#8221; he grunted.
  Wabi turned from his steak in sudden astonishment.
  &#8220;Doesn't the chasm continue east?&#8221; he almost shouted.
  &#8220;No. She turn&#8212;straight north.&#8221;
  Rod could not understand the change that came over Wabi's face.
  &#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;if that is the case I can tell you where  the gold is. If the stream in the chasm turns northward it is bound for  just one place&#8212;the Albany River, and the Albany River empties into  James Bay! The third waterfall, where our treasure in gold is waiting  for us, is in the very heart of the wildest and most savage wilderness  in North America. It is safe. No other man has ever found it. But to  get it means one of the longest and most adventurous expeditions we  ever planned in all our lives!&#8221;
  &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Rod. &#8220;Hurrah&#8212;&#8221;
  He had leaped to his feet, forgetful of everything but that their  gold was safe, and that their search for it would lead them even to the  last fastnesses of the snow-bound and romantic North.
  &#8220;Next spring, Wabi!&#8221; He held out his hand and the two boys joined  their pledge in a hearty grip.
  &#8220;Next spring!&#8221; reiterated Wabi.
  &#8220;And we go in canoe,&#8221; joined Mukoki. &#8220;Creek grow bigger. We make  birch-bark canoe at first fall.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is better still,&#8221; added Wabi. &#8220;It will be a glorious trip!  We'll take a little vacation at the third fall and run up to James  Bay.&#8221;
  &#8220;James Bay is practically the same as Hudson Bay, isn't it?&#8221; asked  Rod.
  &#8220;Yes. I could never see a good reason for calling it James Bay. It  is in reality the lower end, or tail, of Hudson Bay.&#8221;
  There was no thought of visiting any of the traps that day, and the  next morning Mukoki insisted upon going with Rod, in spite of his four  days of hard travel. If he remained in camp his joints would get stiff,  he said, and Wabigoon thought he was right. This left the young Indian  to care for the trap-line leading into the north.
  Two weeks of ideal trapping weather now followed. It had been more  than two months since the hunters had left Wabinosh House, and Rod now  began to count the days before they would turn back over the homeward  trail. Wabi had estimated that they had sixteen hundred dollars' worth  of furs and scalps and two hundred dollars in gold, and the white youth  was satisfied to return to his mother with his share of six hundred  dollars, which was as much as he would have earned in a year at his old  position in the city. Neither did he attempt to conceal from Wabi his  desire to see Minnetaki; and his Indian friend, thoroughly pleased at  Rod's liking for his sister, took much pleasure in frequent  good-natured banter on the subject. In fact, Rod possessed a secret  hope that he might induce the princess mother to allow her daughter to  accompany himself and Wabi to Detroit, where he knew that his own  mother would immediately fall in love with the beautiful little maiden  from the North.
  In the third week after the great storm Rod and Mukoki had gone over  the mountain trap-line, leaving Wabi in camp. They had decided that the  following week would see them headed for Wabinosh House, where they  would arrive about the first of February, and Roderick was in high  spirits.
  On this day they had started toward camp early in the afternoon, and  soon after they had passed through the swamp Rod expressed his  intention of ascending the ridge, hoping to get a shot at game  somewhere along the mountain trail home. Mukoki, however, decided not  to accompany him, but to take the nearer and easier route.
  On the top of the mountain Rod paused to take a survey of the  country about him. He could see Mukoki, now hardly more than a moving  speck on the edge of the plain; northward the same fascinating,  never-ending wilderness rolled away under his eyes; eastward, two miles  away, he saw a moving object which he knew was a moose or a caribou;  and westward&#8212;
  Instinctively his eyes sought the location of their camp. Instantly  the expectant light went out of his face. He gave an involuntary cry of  horror, and there followed it a single, unheard shriek for Mukoki.
  Over the spot where he knew their camp to be now rose a huge volume  of smoke. The sky was black with it, and in the terrible moment that  followed his piercing cry for Mukoki he fancied that he heard the sound  of rifle-shots.
  &#8220;Mukoki! Mukoki!&#8221; he shouted.
  The old Indian was beyond hearing. Quickly it occurred to Rod that  early in their trip they had arranged rifle signals for calling  help&#8212;two quick shots, and then, after a moment's interval, three  others in rapid succession.
  He threw his rifle to his shoulder and fired into the air; once,  twice&#8212;and then three times as fast as he could press the trigger.
  As he watched Mukoki he reloaded. He saw the Indian pause, turn  about and look back toward the mountain.
  Again the thrilling signals for help went echoing over the plains.  In a few seconds the sounds had reached Mukoki's ears and the old  warrior came swinging back at running speed.
  Rod darted along the ridge to meet him, firing a single shot now and  then to let him know where he was, and in fifteen minutes Mukoki came  panting up the mountain.
  &#8220;The Woongas!&#8221; shouted Rod. &#8220;They've attacked the camp! See!&#8221; He  pointed to the cloud of smoke. &#8220;I heard shots&#8212;I heard shots&#8212;&#8221;
  For an instant the grim pathfinder gazed in the direction of the  burning camp, and then without a word he started at terrific speed down  the mountain.
  The half-hour race that followed was one of the most exciting  experiences of Rod's life. How he kept up with Mukoki was more than he  ever could explain afterward. But from the time they struck the old  trail he was close at the Indian's heels. When they reached the hill  that sheltered the dip his face was scratched and bleeding from contact  with swinging bushes; his heart seemed ready to burst from its  tremendous exertion; his breath came in an audible hissing, rattling  sound, and he could not speak. But up the hill he plunged behind  Mukoki, his rifle cocked and ready. At the top they paused.
  The camp was a smoldering mass of ruins. Not a sign of life was  about it. But&#8212;
  With a gasping, wordless cry Rod caught Mukoki's arm and pointed to  an object lying in the snow a dozen yards from where the cabin had  been. The warrior had seen it. He turned one look upon the white youth,  and it was a look that Rod had never thought could come into the face  of a human being. If that was Wabi down there&#8212;if Wabi had been  killed&#8212;what would Mukoki's vengeance be! His companion was no longer  Mukoki&#8212;as he had known him; he was the savage. There was no mercy, no  human instinct, no suggestion of the human soul in that one terrible  look. If it was Wabi&#8212;
  They plunged down the hill, into the dip, across the lake, and  Mukoki was on his knees beside the figure in the snow. He turned it  over&#8212;and rose without a sound, his battle-glaring eyes peering into  the smoking ruins.
  Rod looked, and shuddered.
  The figure in the snow was not Wabi.
  It was a strange, terrible-looking object&#8212;a giant Indian, distorted  in death&#8212;and a half of his head was shot away!
  When he again looked at Mukoki the old Indian was in the midst of  the hot ruins, kicking about with his booted feet and poking with the  butt of his rifle.
