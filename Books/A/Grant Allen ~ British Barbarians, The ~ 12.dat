Never in her life had Frida enjoyed anything so much as those  first four happy days at Heymoor. She had come away with Bertram  exactly as Bertram himself desired her to do, without one thought  of anything on earth except to fulfil the higher law of her own  nature; and she was happy in her intercourse with the one man who  could understand it, the one man who had waked it to its fullest  pitch, and could make it resound sympathetically to his touch in  every chord and every fibre. They had chosen a lovely spot on a  heather-clad moorland, where she could stroll alone with Bertram  among the gorse and ling, utterly oblivious of Robert Monteith and  the unnatural world she had left for ever behind her. Her soul  drank in deep draughts of the knowledge of good and evil from  Bertram's lips; she felt it was indeed a privilege to be with him  and listen to him; she wondered how she could ever have endured  that old bad life with the lower man who was never her equal, now  she had once tasted and known what life can be when two well-  matched souls walk it together, abreast, in holy fellowship.    
The children, too, were as happy as the day was long. The heath was  heaven to them. They loved Bertram well, and were too young to be  aware of anything unusual in the fact of his accompanying them. At  the little inn on the hill-top where they stopped to lodge, nobody  asked any compromising questions: and Bertram felt so sure he could  soon complete his arrangements for taking Frida and the children  "home," as he still always phrased it, that Frida had no doubts for  their future happiness. As for Robert Monteith, that bleak, cold  man, she hardly even remembered him: Bertram's first kiss seemed  almost to have driven the very memory of her husband clean out of  her consciousness. She only regretted, now she had left him, the  false and mistaken sense of duty which had kept her so long tied to  an inferior soul she could never love, and did wrong to marry.    
And all the time, what strange new lessons, what beautiful truths,  she learned from Bertram! As they strolled together, those sweet  August mornings, hand locked in hand, over the breezy upland, what  new insight he gave her into men and things! what fresh impulse he  supplied to her keen moral nature! The misery and wrong of the  world she lived in came home to her now in deeper and blacker hues  than ever she had conceived it in: and with that consciousness came  also the burning desire of every wakened soul to right and redress  it. With Bertram by her side, she felt she could not even harbour  an unholy wish or admit a wrong feeling; that vague sense of his  superiority, as of a higher being, which she had felt from the very  first moment she met him at Brackenhurst, had deepened and grown  more definite now by closer intercourse; and she recognised that  what she had fallen in love with from the earliest beginning was  the beauty of holiness shining clear in his countenance. She had  chosen at last the better part, and she felt in her soul that, come  what might, it could not be taken away from her.    
In this earthly paradise of pure love, undefiled, she spent three  full days and part of another. On the morning of the fourth, she  sent the country girl they had engaged to take care of the  children, out on the moor with the little ones, while she herself  and Bertram went off alone, past the barrow that overlooks the  Devil's Saucepan, and out on the open ridge that stretches with  dark growth of heath and bracken far away into the misty blue  distance of Hampshire. Bertram had just been speaking to her, as  they sat on the dry sand, of the buried chieftain whose bones still  lay hid under that grass-grown barrow, and of the slaughtered wives  whose bodies slept beside him, massacred in cold blood to accompany  their dead lord to the world of shadows. He had been contrasting  these hideous slaveries of taboo-ridden England, past or present,  with the rational freedom of his own dear country, whither he hoped  so soon with good luck to take her, when suddenly Frida raised her  eager eyes from the ground, and saw somebody or something coming  across the moor from eastward in their direction.    
All at once, a vague foreboding of evil possessed her. Hardly quite  knowing why, she felt this approaching object augured no good to  their happiness. "Look, Bertram," she cried, seizing his arm in her  fright, "there's somebody coming."    
Bertram raised his eyes and looked. Then he shaded them with his  hands. "How strange!" he said simply, in his candid way: "it looks  for all the world just like the man who was once your husband!"    
Frida rose in alarm. "Oh, what can we do?" she cried, wringing her  hands. "What ever can we do? It's he! It's Robert!"    
"Surely he can't have come on purpose!" Bertram exclaimed, taken  aback. "When he sees us, he'll turn aside. He must know of all  people on earth he's the one least likely at such a time to be  welcome. He can't want to disturb the peace of another man's  honeymoon!"    
But Frida, better used to the savage ways of the world she had  always lived in, made answer, shrinking and crouching, "He's hunted  us down, and he's come to fight you."    
"To fight me!" Bertram exclaimed. "Oh, surely not that! I was told  by those who ought best to know, you English had got far beyond the  stage of private war and murderous vendetta."    
"For everything else," Frida answered, cowering down in her terror  of her husband's vengeance, not for herself indeed so much as for  Bertram. "For everything else, we have; but <i>not</i> for a woman."    
There was no time just then, however, for further explanation of  this strange anomaly. Monteith had singled them out from a great  distance with his keen, clear sight, inherited from generations of  Highland ancestors, and now strode angrily across the moor, with  great wrathful steps, in his rival's direction. Frida nestled close  to Bertram, to protect her from the man to whom her country's laws  and the customs of her tribe would have handed her over blindfold.  Bertram soothed her with his hand, and awaited in silence, with  some dim sense of awe, the angry barbarian's arrival.    
He came up very quickly, and stood full in front of them, glaring  with fierce eyes at the discovered lovers. For a minute or two his  rage would not allow him to speak, nor even to act; he could but  stand and scowl from under his brows at Bertram. But after a long  pause his wrath found words. "You infernal scoundrel!" he burst  forth, "so at last I've caught you! How dare you sit there and look  me straight in the face? You infernal thief, how dare you? how  dare you?"    
Bertram rose and confronted him. His own face, too, flushed  slightly with righteous indignation; but he answered for all that  in the same calm and measured tones as ever: "I am <i>not</i> a scoundrel,  and I will not submit to be called so even by an angry savage. I  ask you in return, how dare you follow us? You must have known your  presence would be very unwelcome. I should have thought this was  just the one moment in your life and the one place on earth where  even <i>you</i> would have seen that to stop away was your imperative  duty. Mere self-respect would dictate such conduct. This lady has  given you clear proof indeed that your society and converse are  highly distasteful to her."    
Robert Monteith glared across at him with the face of a tiger. "You  infamous creature," he cried, almost speechless with rage, "do you  dare to defend my wife's adultery?"    
Bertram gazed at him with a strange look of mingled horror and  astonishment. "You poor wretch!" he answered, as calmly as before,  but with evident contempt; "how can you dare, such a thing as you,  to apply these vile words to your moral superiors? Adultery it was  indeed, and untruth to her own higher and purer nature, for this  lady to spend one night of her life under your roof with you; what  she has taken now in exchange is holy marriage, the only real and  sacred marriage, the marriage of true souls, to which even the  wiser of yourselves, the poets of your nation, would not admit  impediment. If you dare to apply such base language as this to  my lady's actions, you must answer for it to me, her natural  protector, for I will not permit it."    
At the words, quick as lightning, Monteith pulled from his pocket a  loaded revolver and pointed it full at his rival. With a cry of  terror, Frida flung herself between them, and tried to protect her  lover with the shield of her own body. But Bertram gently unwound  her arms and held her off from him tenderly. "No, no, darling," he  said slowly, sitting down with wonderful calm upon a big grey  sarsen-stone that abutted upon the pathway; "I had forgotten again;  I keep always forgetting what kind of savages I have to deal with.  If I chose, I could snatch that murderous weapon from his hand, and  shoot him dead with it in self-defence--for I'm stronger than he  is. But if I did, what use? I could never take you home with me.  And after all, what could we either of us do in the end in this  bad, wild world of your fellow-countrymen? They would take me and  hang me; and all would be up with you. For your sake, Frida, to  shield you from the effects of their cruel taboos, there's but one  course open: I must submit to this madman. He may shoot me if he  will. . . . Stand free, and let him!"    
But with a passionate oath, Robert Monteith seized her arm and  flung her madly from him. She fell, reeling, on one side. His eyes  were bloodshot with the savage thirst for vengeance. He raised the  deadly weapon. Bertram Ingledew, still seated on the big round  boulder, opened his breast in silence to receive the bullet. There  was a moment's pause. For that moment, even Monteith himself, in  his maniac mood, felt dimly aware of that mysterious restraining  power all the rest who knew him had so often felt in their dealings  with the Alien. But it was only for a moment. His coarser nature  was ill adapted to recognise that ineffable air as of a superior  being that others observed in him. He pulled the trigger and fired.  Frida gave one loud shriek of despairing horror. Bertram's body  fell back on the bare heath behind it.
