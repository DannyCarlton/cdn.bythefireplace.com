Rachael had just eaten the last of her sixteenth birthday sweets when,  at a ball at Government House, she met John Michael Levine. It was her  debut; she was the fairest creature in the room, and, in the idiom of  Dr. Hamilton, the men besieged her as were she Brimstone Hill in  possession of the French. The Governor and the Captain General had  asked her to dance, and even the women smiled indulgently, disarmed by  so much innocent loveliness.    
Levine, albeit a Dane, and as colourless as most of his countrymen, was  her determined suitor before the night was half over. It may be that he  was merely dazzled by the regal position to which the young men had  elevated her, and that his cold blood quickened at the thought of  possessing what all men desired, but he was as immediate and persistent  in his suit as any excitable creole in the room. But Rachael gave him  scant attention that night. She may have been intellectual, but she was  also a girl, and it was her first ball. She was dazzled and happy,  delighted with her conquests, oblivious to the depths of her nature.    
The next day Levine, strong in the possession of a letter from Mr. Peter  Lytton,--for a fortnight forgotten,--presented himself at Mistress  Fawcett's door, and was admitted. The first call was brief and  perfunctory, but he came the next day and the next. Rachael, surprised,  but little interested, and longing for her next ball, strummed the harp  at her mother's command and received his compliments with indifference.  A week after his first call Mary Fawcett drove into town and spent an  hour with the Governor. He told her that Levine had brought him a  personal letter from the Governor of St. Croix, and that he was wealthy  and well born. He was also, in his Excellency's opinion, a distinguished  match even for the most beautiful and accomplished girl on the Island.  Peter Lytton had mentioned in his letter that Levine purposed buying an  estate on St. Croix and settling down to the life of a planter. On the  following day Levine told her that already he was half a West Indian, so  fascinated was he with the life and the climate, but that if she would  favour his suit he would take Rachael to Copenhagen as often as she  wished for the life of the world.    
Mary Fawcett made up her mind that he should marry Rachael, and it  seemed to her that no mother had ever come to a wiser decision. Her  health was failing, and it was her passionate wish not only to leave her  child encircled by the protection of a devoted husband, but to realize  the high ambitions she had cherished from the hour she foresaw that  Rachael was to be an exceptional woman.    
Levine had not seen Rachael on the morning when he asked for her hand,  and he called two days later to press his suit and receive his answer.  Mistress Fawcett told him that she had made up her own mind and would  perform that office for Rachael at once, but thought it best that he  should absent himself until the work was complete. Levine, promised an  answer on the morrow, took himself off, and Mary Fawcett sent for her  daughter.    
Rachael entered the library with a piece of needlework in her hand. Her  mind was not on her books these days, for she had gone to another ball;  but her hands had been too well brought up to idle, however her brain  might dream. Mary Fawcett by this time wore a large cap with a frill,  and her face, always determined and self-willed, was growing austere  with years and much pain: she suffered frightfully at times with  rheumatism, and her apprehension of the moment when it should attack her  heart reconciled her to the prospect of brief partings from her  daughter. Her eyes still burned with the fires of an indiminishable  courage however; she read the yellow pages of her many books as rapidly  as in her youth, and if there was a speck of dust on her mahogany  floors, polished with orange juice, she saw it. Her negroes adored her  but trembled when she raised her voice, and Rachael never had disobeyed  her. She expected some dissatisfaction, possibly a temper, but no  opposition.    
Rachael smiled confidently and sat down. She wore one of the thin white  linens, which, like the other women of the Islands, she put aside for  heavier stuffs on state occasions only, and her hair had tumbled from  its high comb and fallen upon her shoulders. Mary Fawcett sighed as she  looked at her. She was too young to marry, and had it not been for the  haunting terror of leaving her alone in the world, the Dane, well  circumstanced as he was, would have been repulsed with contumely.    
"Rachael," said her mother, gently, "put down your tapestry. I have  something to say to you, something of great import."    
Rachael dropped her work and met her mother's eyes. They were hard with  will and definite purpose. In an instant she divined what was coming,  and stood up. Her face could not turn any whiter, but her eyes were  black at once, and her nostrils spread.    
"It cannot be possible that you wish me to marry that man--Levine," she  stammered. "I do not know how I can think of such a thing--but I do--it  seems to me I see it in your eyes."    
"Yes," said her mother, with some uneasiness. "I do; and my reasons are  good--"    
"I won't listen to them!" shrieked Rachael. "I won't marry him! His  whiteness makes me sick! I know he is not a good man! I feel it! I never  could be happy with him! I never could love him!"    
Mary Fawcett looked at her aghast, and, for a moment, without answering;  she saw her own will asserting itself, heard it on those piercing notes,  and she knew that it sprang from stronger and more tragic foundations  than had ever existed in her own nature; but believing herself to be  right, she determined to prevail.    
"What do you know about men, my darling?" she said soothingly. "You have  been dreaming romantic dreams, and young Levine does not resemble the  hero. That is all. Women readjust themselves marvellously quick. When  you are married to him, and he is your tender and devoted husband, you  will forget your prince--who, no doubt, is dark and quite splendid. But  we never meet our princes, my dear, and romantic love is only one of the  things we live for--and for that we live but a little while. Levine is  all that I could wish for you. He is wealthy, aristocratic, and  chivalrously devoted."    
Her long speech had given her daughter time to cool, but Rachael  remained standing, and stared defiantly into the eyes which had relaxed  somewhat with anxious surprise.    
"I <i>feel</i> that he is not a good man," she repeated sullenly, "and I hate  him. I should die if he touched me. I have not danced with him. His  hands are so white and soft, and his eyes never change, and his mouth  reminds me of a shark's."    
"Levine is a remarkably handsome man," exclaimed Mistress Fawcett,  indignantly. "You have trained your imagination to some purpose, it  seems. Forget your poets when he comes to-morrow, and look at him  impartially. And cannot he give you all that you so much desire, my  ambitious little daughter? Do you no longer want to go to Europe? to  court? to be <i>grande dame</i> and converse with princes?"    
"Oh, yes," said Rachael. "I want that as much as ever; but I want to  love the man. I want to be happy."    
"Well, <i>do</i> love him," exclaimed her mother with energy. "Your father  was twenty years older than myself, and a Frenchman, but I made up my  mind to love him, and I did--for a good many years."    
"You had to leave him in the end. Do you wish me to do the same?"    
"You will do nothing of the kind. There never was but one John Fawcett."    
"I don't love this Levine, and I never shall love him. I don't believe  at all that that kind of feeling can be created by the brain, that it  responds to nothing but the will. I shall not love that way. I may be  ignorant, but I know that."    
"You have read too much Shakespeare! Doubtless you imagine yourself one  of his heroines--Juliet? Rosalind?"    
"I have never imagined myself anybody but Rachael Fawcett. I <i>cannot</i>  imagine myself Rachael Levine. But I know something of myself--I have  read and thought enough for that. I could love someone--but not this  bleached repulsive Dane. Why will you not let me wait? It is my right.  No, you need not curl your lip--I am <i>not</i> a little girl. I may be  sixteen. I may be without experience in the world, but you have been  almost my only companion, and until just now I have talked with  middle-aged men only, and much with them. I had no real childhood. You  have educated my brain far beyond my years. To-day I feel twenty, and it  seems to me that I see far down into myself--much deeper than you do. I  tell you that if I marry this man, I shall be the most hopeless wretch  on earth."    
Mary Fawcett was puzzled and distressed, but she did not waver for a  moment. The cleverest of girls could not know what was best for herself,  and the mother who permitted her daughter to take her life into her own  hands was a poor creature indeed.    
"Listen, my dear child," she said tenderly, "you have always trusted in  me, believed me. I <i>know</i> that this is a wise and promising marriage for  you. And--" she hesitated, but it was time to play her trump. "You know  that my health is not good, but you do not know how bad it is. Dr.  Hamilton says that the rheumatism may fly to my heart at any moment, and  I <i>must</i> see you married--"    
She had ejaculated the last words; Rachael had shrieked, and flung  herself upon her, her excitement at this sudden and cruel revelation  bursting out in screams and sobs and a torrent of tears. Her mother had  seen her excited and in brief ungovernable tempers, but she never had  suspected that she was capable of such passion as this; and, much  disturbed, she led her off to bed, and sent for her advisers, Archibald  Hamn and Dr. Hamilton.
