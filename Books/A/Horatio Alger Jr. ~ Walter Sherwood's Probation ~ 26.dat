  In the country it may safely be assumed that by twelve o'clock at   night every sound and healthy person will be asleep. Dick Ranney gave   an extra margin of half an hour, and thirty minutes after midnight   made his appearance in the hotel yard. Thanks to the information given   by his young messenger, Oren Trott, who, of course, did not know that   in this way he was assisting a dishonest scheme, he was able to fix at   once upon the windows of the rooms occupied by Walter and the   professor. 
  He decided to enter Walter's chamber first, partly because he  wanted  his revolver, which would be of service to him in case he were   attacked. Then, again, he wanted the satisfaction of triumphing over   the boy who had had the audacity to defy him&#8212;a full-grown man, and   one whose name had carried terror to many a traveler. 
  There was a long ladder leaning against the stable. Dick Ranney  could  not call this providential without insinuating that Providence  was  fighting on the side of the transgressor, but he called it,   appropriately, a &quot;stroke of luck,&quot; as indeed it seemed at the time. 
  He secured the ladder and put it up against the window of Walter's   room. The window, as he could see, was partly open, it being a summer   night. 
  Dick Ranney observed this with a grim smile of satisfaction. 
  &quot;He's making things easy for me,&quot; he said to himself. 
  As softly and cautiously as a cat he ascended the ladder, but not   softly enough to escape the vigilant ear of Manning, who was expecting   him. 
  Manning at the sound stepped from the bed&#8212;he had thrown himself on   the outside, without undressing&#8212;and stepped into a closet, as he did   not wish Ranney to learn that there were two persons in the chamber.   Walter was awake, but he lay in bed motionless and with his eyes   closed. The revolver was in Manning's hands, but he had placed his   clothing temptingly over a chair between the bed and the window, but   in such a position that his companion on coming out of the closet   would be between the window and the burglar. Dick Ranney stood on the   ladder and looked in. 
  What he saw reassured him. Walter was in bed, and seemed to be fast   asleep. 
  &quot;The coast is clear,&quot; he murmured softly. &quot;Now, where is the   revolver?&quot; 
  He could not see it, but this did not trouble him. Probably the boy   had it under his pillow, and in that case he could obtain it without   trouble. Meanwhile, it would be well to secure the boy's pocketbook.   Though he underrated Walter's wealth, he thought he might have twenty   dollars, and this would be worth taking. 
  He lifted the window softly and entered the room. In order to  deaden  the sound of his steps he had taken off his shoes and placed  them on  the ground beside the foot of the ladder. 
  Having entered the room, he strode softly to the chair over which   Walter had thrown his clothes and began to feel in the pockets of his   pantaloons. There was a purse in one of the pockets which contained a   few small silver coins, but it is needless to say that Walter had   disposed of his stock of bank bills elsewhere. He felt that prevention   of robbery was better than the recovery of the goods stolen. 
  Meanwhile, Manning, whose hearing was keen, was made aware through  it  that the burglar had entered the room. He opened the door of the   closet and, walking into the center of the apartment, placed himself,   revolver in hand, in front of the window. 
  Though his motions were gentle, the outlaw's ears were quick. He   turned swiftly, and with a look of dismay realized that he had walked   into a trap. He had not felt afraid to encounter a boy of eighteen,   but here was a resolute man, who had the advantage of being armed, and   well armed. 
  Dick Ranney surveyed him for a minute in silence, but was very  busily  thinking what were his chances of escape. 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said Manning, &quot;we meet again!&quot; &quot;Again?&quot; repeated Ranney, in  a  questioning tone. 
  &quot;Yes. When we last met, you had the drop on me and relieved me of  my  wallet. To-night I have the drop on you.&quot; 
  Dick Ranney paused for reflection. 
  &quot;That's so,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you want your wallet back?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then we'll make a bargain. Give me that revolver, promise not to   raise the house, and I will give you back your wallet.&quot; 
  &quot;With all the money inside?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I will,&quot; said Manning, after a pause. 
  &quot;Don't be a fool! Come, be quick, or the boy will wake up.&quot; 
  &quot;He is awake already,&quot; said Walter, raising his head from the  pillow. 
  &quot;Were you awake when I entered the room?&quot; asked Dick Ranney,  quickly. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Fooled again!&quot; exclaimed Ranney, bitterly. &quot;Boy, I believe you are  my  evil genius. Till I met you, I thought myself a match for any one.&quot; 
  &quot;You were more than a match for me,&quot; said Manning, &quot;but he wins  best  who wins last.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, what do you mean to do?&quot; asked Ranney, doggedly. 
  &quot;To capture you, Dick Ranney, and hand you over to the law which  you  have so persistently violated.&quot; 
  &quot;That you will never do,&quot; said Ranney, and he dashed toward the   window, thrusting Manning to one side. 
  But what he saw increased his dismay. The ladder had been removed,  and  if he would leave the room he must leap to the ground, a distance  of  over twenty feet. 
  &quot;Confusion!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The ladder is gone!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I directed the stable-boy to keep awake and remove it,&quot;   explained Manning. 
  &quot;I may be taken, but I will be revenged first,&quot; shouted Dick  Ranney,  and he flung himself on Manning, who, unprepared for the  sudden  attack, sank to the floor, with Ranney on top. But the outlaw's   triumph was short-lived. Walter sprang to Manning's rescue, seized the   revolver, and, aiming it at the burglar, cried quickly: 
  &quot;Get up, or I'll fire!&quot; 
  Dick Ranney rose sullenly. He paid Walter the compliment of  believing  he meant what he said. 
  &quot;It's your turn, boy,&quot; he muttered. 
  &quot;Stay where you are!&quot; ordered Walter, and he walked slowly  backward,  still covering the robber with the revolver, till he reached  the door  opening into the entry. 
  Dick Ranney watched him closely, and did not offer any opposition,  for  it occurred to him that the opening of the door would afford him a   better chance for flight. 
  No sooner, therefore, was the door open than he prepared to avail   himself of the opportunity, running the risk of a bullet wound, when   his plans were frustrated by the entrance of two village constables&#8212;   strong, sturdy men. 
  &quot;Dick Ranney, do you surrender?&quot; asked Walter, in a clear, resolute   tone. 
  Ranney looked slowly from one to the other and calculated the  chances.  The ladder was gone and he found himself facing four foes,  three of  them strong men, some of them armed. 
  &quot;It's all up with me!&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I surrender.&quot; 
  &quot;You do wisely,&quot; remarked Manning. &quot;Now, will you restore my  wallet?&quot; 
  The outlaw took it out of his pocket and handed it over. 
  &quot;There it is,&quot; he said. &quot;I suppose you won't me to pay interest for   the use of the money.&quot; 
  The two constables advanced, and one of them took out a pair of   handcuffs. 
  &quot;Hold out your hands!&quot; he said. 
  The burglar did so. He saw that opposition would not benefit him,  and  he yielded to the inevitable with a good grace. 
  &quot;It seems I walked into a trap,&quot; he said. &quot;If you don't mind  telling  me, were you expecting me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Walter. 
  &quot;Did the boy betray me?&quot; he asked quickly. 
  &quot;No; the boy suspected nothing wrong, but his questions excited   suspicion.&quot; 
  &quot;Dick Ranney,&quot; said the outlaw, apostrophizing himself, &quot;you're a   fool! I should like to kick you!&quot; 
  &quot;I think you were imprudent, Mr. Ranney,&quot; said Manning, 
  &quot;It was this revolver that undid me,&quot; said Ranney. &quot;I wanted to   recover it, for it was given me by my old captain. It was never out of   my possession till that boy snatched it from me. I suppose it was to   be,&quot; and he sighed, comforted, perhaps, by the thought that it would   have been useless to struggle against fate.
