It was the autumn of 1786. New York had risen from her charred and  battered ruins. There were cows on her meadows, a lake with wooded  shores as merely traditional, groves, gardens, orchards, fields, and  swamps; but her business houses and public buildings were ambitious once  more, her spires more lofty and enduring, her new dwelling-houses,  whether somewhat crowded in Wall Street and Broadway, or on the terraces  of less busy streets, or along the river fronts and facing a wild and  lovely prospect, were square, substantial, and usually very large. And  every street was an avenue of ancient trees. Mrs. John Jay, with her  experience of foreign courts, her great beauty, and the prestige of her  distinguished husband, was the leader of society, holding weekly  receptions, and the first to receive the many distinguished strangers.  Although society was not quite as gay as it became three years later,  under a more settled government and hopeful outlook, still there was  quiet entertaining by the Hamiltons, who lived at 58 Wall Street, the  Duers, Watts, Livingstons, Clintons, Duanes, Jays, Roosevelts, Van  Cortlandts, and other representatives of old New York families, now  returned to their own. Congress was come to New York and established in  the City Hall in Wall Street. It had given the final impetus to the  city, struggling under the burden of ruins and debt left by the British;  and society sauntered forth every afternoon in all the glory of velvet  and ruffles, three-cornered hats recklessly laced, brocades, hoopskirts,  and Rohan hats, to promenade past the building where the moribund body  was holding its last sessions. The drive was down the Broadway into the  shades of the Battery, with the magnificent prospect of bay and wooded  shores beyond. Politics, always epidemic among men and women alike, had  recently been animated by Hamilton's coup at Annapolis, and the prospect  of a general convention of the States to consider the reorganization of  a government which had reduced the Confederation to a condition  fearfully close to anarchy, the country to ruin, and brought upon the  thirteen sovereign independent impotent and warring States the contempt  of Europe and the threat of its greed.    
A group of men, standing on a corner of Wall Street and the Broadway,  were laughing heartily: a watch was dragging off to jail two citizens  who had fallen upon each other with the venom of political antithesis;  the one, a Nationalist, having called Heaven to witness that Hamilton  was a demi-god, begotten to save the wretched country, the other  vociferating that Hamilton was the devil who would trick the country  into a monarchy, create a vast standing army, which would proclaim him  king and stand upon the heads of a people that had fought and died for  freedom, while the tyrant exercised his abominable functions.    
The men in the group were Governor Clinton, Hamilton's bitterest  opponent, but sufficiently amused at the incident; William Livingston,  Governor of New Jersey, now with but a few hairs on the top of his head  and a few at the base, his nose more penetrating, his eye more  disapproving, than ever; James Duane, Mayor of New York; John Jay, the  most faultless character in the Confederation, honoured and unloved, his  cold eyes ever burning with an exalted fire; and John Marshall of  Virginia, munching an apple, his attire in shabby contrast to the  fashionable New Yorkers, the black mane on his splendid head unpowdered  and tossing in the ocean breeze.    
"I like your Hamilton," he announced, "and I've come to the conclusion  that I think with him on all matters. He's done more to educate the  people up to a rational form of government during the last seven years  than all the rest of us put together. He's shone upon them like a fixed  star. Other comets have come and gone, whirling them forward to  destruction, but they have always been forced to turn and look at him  again and again, and he has always shone in the same place."    
"Sir," exclaimed Clinton, who was flushed with rage, "are you aware that  I am present, and that I entirely disapprove of Mr. Hamilton's attempt  to reduce the States to a condition of ignominious subserviency to an  ambitious and tyrannical central power?"    
"I had heard of you, sir," replied Marshall, meekly, "and I am glad to  have the opportunity to ask you what <i>your</i> remedy is for the existing  state of things? You will admit that there must be a remedy, and  quickly. If not a common government with a Constitution empowering it to  regulate trade, imposts, reduce the debt, enter into treaties with  foreign powers which will not be sneered at, administer upon a thousand  details which I will not enumerate, and raise the country from its  slough of contempt, then what? As the personage who has taken the most  decided stand against the enlightened and patriotic efforts of Mr.  Hamilton, I appeal to you for a counter suggestion as magnificent as  his. I am prepared, sir, to listen with all humility."    
Clinton, whose selfish fear of his own downfall with that of State  supremacy was so well known that a smile wrinkled across the polite  group of gentlemen surrounding him, deepened his colour to purple under  this assault, and stammered: "Sir, have I not myself proposed an  enlargement of the powers of Congress, in order to counteract the  damnable policy of Britain? Did not your Hamilton harangue that crowd I  sanctioned till he got nearly all he asked for?"    
"But he knew better than to ask for too much, in the conditions,"  replied Marshall, suavely. "May I suggest that you have not answered my  humble and earnest questions?"    
"I answer no questions that I hold to be impertinent and unimportant!"  said Clinton, pompously, and with a dignified attempt to recover his  poise. He swept his hat from his head; the New Yorkers were as  punctilious; Marshall lifted his battered lid from the wild mass  beneath, and the popular Governor sauntered down the street, saluted  deferentially by Nationalists and followers alike. When he had occasion  to sweep his gorgeous hat to his knees, the ladies courtesied to the  ground, their draperies taking up the entire pavement, and His  Excellency was obliged to encounter the carriages in the street.    
"If Clinton were sure of figuring as powerfully in a national government  as he does in the state of New York, he would withdraw his opposition,"  said Livingston, contemptuously. "He has been Governor for nine years.  New York is his throne. He is a king among the common people, who will  elect him indefinitely. Were it not for Hamilton, he would be New York,  and the awful possibilities lying hidden in the kernel of change haunt  his dreams at night. You embarrassed him in a manner that rejoiced my  heart, Mr. Marshall. I beg you will do me the honour to dine with me  to-night. I beg to assure you that your fame is as known to me as were I  a Virginian."    
"I'll accept the invitation with pleasure," replied Marshall, whose  manners were all that his attire was not. "I shall be glad to talk with  you on many subjects. To-morrow I shall pay my respects to Mr. Hamilton.  His has been a trying but not a thankless task. He has addressed himself  to the right class of men all over the country, winning them to his  sound and enlightened views, giving them courage, consolidating them  against the self-interested advocates of State sovereignty. That he has  so often neglected a legal practice which must bring him a large income,  as well as sufficient personal glory, out of a sincere pity for and  patriotic interest in this afflicted country, gives New York deep cause  for congratulation that she was in such close communication with that  Island of his youth. I wish that fate had steered him to Virginia."    
"Surely you have enough as it is," said Duane, laughing: "Washington,  yourself, Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Madison, Randolph. Spare us  Hamilton. We shall need him badly enough. The Clinton faction is very  strong. That the Hamilton embraces the best spirits of the community  means that it is in the minority, and needs the unremitting exercise of  his genius to counteract the disadvantage in numbers."    
"I think that what I admire most in Hamilton," remarked a newcomer, a  small dark man of vivid personality, "are his methods of manipulation.  He picks out his own men, Duer, Troup, Malcolm, has them sent to the  legislature, where they blindly and indefatigably obey his behest and  gain the consent of that body to the convention at Annapolis, then see  that he is elected as principal delegate. He goes to Annapolis  ostensibly to attend a commercial convention: while its insufficient  numbers are drowsing, he springs upon them an eloquent proposal for a  national convention for reforming the Union, and forces it through  before they know what they are about. Certainly Mr. Hamilton is a man of  genius."    
"Do I understand. Mr. Burr," said Jay, from his glacial height, "that  you are impugning the purity of Mr. Hamilton's motives?"    
"No, sir," replied Burr, whom an archangel could not have rebuked. "In  the present condition of things all methods are justifiable. Hamilton is  great but adaptable. I respect him for that quality above all others,  for he is quite the most imperious character in America, and his natural  instinct is to come out and say, 'You idiots, fall into line behind me  and stop twaddling. I will do your thinking; be kind enough not to delay  me further.' On the other hand, he is forced to be diplomatic, to  persuade where he would command, to move slowly instead of charging at  the point of the bayonet. So, although I have no sympathy with his  pronounced monarchical inclinations, I respect his acquired methods of  getting what he wants."    
"What do you mean by pronounced monarchical inclinations?" snorted  Governor Livingston, who could not endure Burr.    
Burr gave his peculiar sardonic laugh. "Will you deny it, sir?"    
"Deny it? I certainly am in Mr. Hamilton's confidence to no such extent,  and I challenge you to indicate one sentence in his published writings  which points to such a conclusion."    
"Ah, he is too clever for that; but his very walk, his whole personality  expresses it, to say nothing of the fact that he never thinks of denying  his admiration of the British Constitution. And did he not defend the  Tories after the evacuation, when no other lawyer would touch them? I  admired his courage, but it was sufficient evidence of the catholicity  of his sentiments."    
"Mr. Hamilton defended the abstract principle of right against wrong in  defending the wretched Tories against the persecutions of an  unmagnanimous public sentiment," said Jay, witheringly. "I should advise  you, young gentleman, to become a disciple of Mr. Hamilton. I can  recommend no course which would prove so beneficial." And he turned on  his heel.    
He had hit Burr. The jealousy born in Albany had thriven with much  sustenance since. Hamilton was by far the most prominent figure at the  New York bar, and was hastening to its leadership. Burr was conspicuous  for legal ability, but never would be first while Hamilton was in the  race. Moreover, although Hamilton had not then reached that dizzy height  from which a few years later he looked down upon a gaping world, he was  the leader of a growing and important party, intelligently followed and  worshipped by the most eminent men in the Confederation, many of them  old enough to be his father; and he was the theme of every drawing-room,  of every coffee-house group and conclave. His constant pamphlets on the  subject nearest to all men's hearts, his eloquent speeches on the same  theme upon every possible occasion, and the extraordinary brilliance of  his legal victories, gave people no time to think of other men. When he  entered a drawing-room general conversation ceased, and the company  revolved about him so long as he remained. When he spoke, all the world  went to hear. For an ambitious young man to be told to attach himself to  the train of this conquering hero was more than poor Burr could stand,  and he replied angrily:--    
"I have the privilege of being true to my own convictions, I suppose.  They are not Mr. Hamilton's and never will be. I do not impugn the  purity of his motives, but I have no desire to see George Washington  king, nor Hamilton, neither. I wish you good day, sirs," and he strode  up Broadway to the Fields with dignity in every inch of him.    
"This constant talk of Hamilton's monarchical principles makes my gorge  rise," said Livingston. "Did he not fight as hard as he was permitted,  to drive monarchy out of the country? Was he not the first to sound the  call to arms?"    
"Hamilton's exact attitude on that question is not clearly understood,"  replied Duane, soothingly, for the heat of Livingston's republicanism  had never abated. "I fancy it is something like this: So far no  constitution has worked so well as the British. Montesquieu knew whereof  he praised. The number of men in this country equal to the great problem  of self-government are in a pitiful minority. The anarchic conditions of  the States, the disgrace which they have brought upon us, their  inefficiency to cope with any problem, the contemptible depths of human  nature which they have revealed to the thinking members of the  community--all these causes inspire Hamilton, incomparably the greatest  brain in the country, with a dread of leaving any power whatever in  their hands. He believes firmly in the few of tried brain and  patriotism. I very much doubt if he has considered the subject of actual  monarchy for a moment, for he is no dreamer, and he knows that even his  followers have been Republicans too long. But that he will fight for the  strongest sort of national government, with the least possible power  vested in the States--oh, no doubt of that."    
"Our people are hopeless, I fear," said Livingston, with a sigh. "This  period of independency seems to have demoralized them when it should  have brought out their best elements. Well, Mr. Marshall, what say you?  You have been modestly silent, and we have been rudely voluble when so  distinguished a guest should have had all the floor."    
"I have been deeply entertained," replied Marshall, with a grin. "My  visit to New York is by no means wasted. I envy Mr. Hamilton; but let  him look out for Mr. Burr. There are just five feet seven inches of  jealous hate in that well-balanced exterior, and its methods would be  sinuous, I fancy, but no less deadly. But Hamilton has had many escapes.  What was that atrocious story I heard of a duelling cabal? When the  rolling stone of gossip reaches Virginia from New York, it has gathered  more moss than you would think."    
"It would be difficult to exaggerate that story," snorted Livingston."  Hamilton defended his course in regard to the Tories in two pamphlets,  signed 'Phocion.' They were answered by a Mr. Ledyard, who signed  himself 'Mentor,' and was a conspicuous advocate of the damnable spirit  of revenge possessing this country. It is a bold man indeed who enters  into a conflict of the pen with Hamilton, and 'Mentor' was left without  a leg to stand on. Forthwith, a club of Ledyard's friends and  sympathizers, enraged by defeat, and fearing the growing ascendency of  Hamilton over men's minds, deliberately agreed to challenge him in turn  until he was silenced forever. This atrocious project would undoubtedly  have been carried out, had not Ledyard himself repudiated it with  horror. Can you show me a greater instance of the depravity of human  nature, sir?"    
"We are in a ferment of bitter passions," said Marshall, sadly, "and I  fear they will be worse before they are better. I only hope that  Hamilton will not be swept into their current, for upon his keeping his  balance depends the future greatness of this country. I am at your  service, sir, for I will confess my two legs are tired."
