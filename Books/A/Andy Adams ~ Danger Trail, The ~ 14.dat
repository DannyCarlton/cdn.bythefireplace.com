  In a single breath the face of Jean Croisset became no more than a  mask of what it had been. The taunting smile left his lips and a gray  pallor spread over his face as he saw Howland's finger crooked firmly  on the trigger of his revolver. In another instant there came the sound  of a metallic snap.
  &#8220;Damnation! An empty cartridge!&#8221; Howland exclaimed. &#8220;I forgot to  load after those three shots at the cup. It's coming this time, Jean!&#8221;
  Purposely he snapped the second empty cartridge.
  &#8220;The great God!&#8221; gasped Jean. &#8220;M'seur&#8212;&#8221;
  From deep in the forest came again the baying of the Mackenzie  hound. This time it was much nearer, and for a moment Howland's eyes  left the Frenchman's terrified face as he turned his head to listen.
  &#8220;They are coming!&#8221; exclaimed Croisset. &#8220;M'seur, I swear to&#8212;&#8221;
  Again Howland's pistol covered his heart.
  &#8220;Then it is even more necessary that I kill you,&#8221; he said with  frightful calmness. &#8220;I warned you that I would kill you if you led me  into a trap, Croisset. The dogs are bushed. There is no way out of this  but to fight&#8212;if there are people coming down the trail. Listen to  that!&#8221;
  This time, from still nearer, came the shout of a man, and then of  another, followed by the huskies' sharp yelping as they started afresh  on the trail. The flush of excitement that had come into Howland's face  paled until he stood as white as the Frenchman. But it was not the  whiteness of fear. His eyes were like blue steel flashing in the  sunlight.
  &#8220;There is nothing to do but fight,&#8221; he repeated, even more calmly  than before. &#8220;If we were a mile or two back there it could all happen  as I planned it. But here&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;They will hear the shots,&#8221; cried Jean. &#8220;The post is no more than a  gunshot beyond the forest, and there are plenty there who would come  out to see what it means. Quick, M'seur&#8212;follow me. Possibly they are  hunters going out to the trap-lines. If it comes to the worst&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What then?&#8221; demanded Howland.
  &#8220;You can shoot me a little later,&#8221; temporized the Frenchman with a  show of his old coolness. &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, I am afraid of that gun,  M'seur. I will get you out of this if I can. Will you give me the  chance&#8212;or will you shoot?&#8221;
  &#8220;I will shoot&#8212;if you fail,&#8221; replied the engineer.
  Barely were the words out of his mouth when Croisset sprang to the  head of the dogs, seized the leader by his neck-trace and half dragged  the team and sledge through the thick bush that edged the trail. A  dozen paces farther on the dense scrub opened into the clearer run of  the low-hanging banskian through which Jean started at a slow trot,  with Howland a yard behind him, and the huskies following with  human-like cleverness in the sinuous twistings of the trail which the  Frenchman marked out for them. They had progressed not more than three  hundred yards when there came to them for a third time the hallooing of  a voice. With a sharp &#8220;hup, hup,&#8221; and a low crack of his whip Jean  stopped the dogs.
  &#8220;The Virgin be praised, but that is luck!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They have  turned off into another trail to the east, M'seur. If they had come on  to that break in the bush where we dragged the sledge through&#8212;&#8221; He  shrugged his shoulders with a gasp of relief. &#8220;<I>Sacre</I>, they would  not be fools enough to pass it without wondering!&#8221;
  Howland had broken the breech of his revolver and was replacing the  three empty cartridges with fresh ones.
  &#8220;There will be no mistake next time,&#8221; he said, holding out the  weapon. &#8220;You were as near your death a few moments ago as ever before  in your life, Croisset&#8212;and now for a little plain understanding  between us. Until we stopped out there I had some faith in you. Now I  have none. I regard you as my worst enemy, and though you are deuced  near to your friends I tell you that you were never in a tighter box in  your life. If I fail in my mission here, you shall die. If others come  along that trail before dark, and run us down, I will kill you. Unless  you make it possible for me to see and talk with Meleese I will kill  you. Your life hangs on my success; with my failure your death is as  certain as the coming of night. I am going to put a bullet through you  at the slightest suspicion of treachery. Under the circumstances what  do you propose to do?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad that you changed your mind, M'seur, and I will not tempt  you again. I will do the best that I can,&#8221; said Jean. Through a narrow  break in the tops of the banskian pines a few feathery flakes of snow  were falling, and Jean lifted his eyes to the slit of gray sky above  them. &#8220;Within an hour it will be snowing heavily,&#8221; he affirmed. &#8220;If  they do not run across our trail by that time, M'seur, we shall be  safe.&#8221;
  He led the way through the forest again, more slowly and with  greater caution than before, and whenever he looked over his shoulder  he caught the dull gleam of Howland's revolver as it pointed at the  hollow of his back.
  &#8220;The devil, but you make me uncomfortable,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;The  hammer is up, too, M'seur!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it is up,&#8221; said Howland grimly. &#8220;And it never leaves your  back, Croisset. If the gun should go off accidentally it would bore a  hole clean through you.&#8221;
  Half an hour later the Frenchman halted where the banskians climbed  the side of a sloping ridge.
  &#8220;If you could trust me I would ask to go on ahead,&#8221; whispered Jean.  &#8220;This ridge shuts in the plain, M'seur, and just over the top of it is  an old cabin which has been abandoned for many years. There is not one  chance in a thousand of there being any one there, though it is a good  fox ridge at this season. From it you may see the light in Meleese's  window at night.&#8221;
  He did not stop to watch the effect of his last words, but began  picking his way up the ridge with the dogs tugging at his heels. At the  top he swung sharply between two huge masses of snow-covered rock, and  in the lee of the largest of these, almost entirely sheltered from the  drifts piled up by easterly winds, they came suddenly on a small log  hut. About it there were no signs of life. With unusual eagerness Jean  scanned the surface of the snow, and when he saw that there was trail  of neither man nor beast in the unbroken crust a look of relief came  into his face.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, so far I have saved my hide,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;Now,  M'seur, look for yourself and see if Jean Croisset has not kept his  word!&#8221;
  A dozen steps had taken him through a screen of shrub to the  opposite slope of the ridge. With outstretched arm he pointed down into  the plain, and as Howland's eyes followed its direction he stood  throbbing with sudden excitement. Less than a quarter of a mile away,  sheltered in a dip of the plain, were three or four log buildings  rising black and desolate out of the white waste. One of these  buildings was a large structure similar to that in which Howland had  been imprisoned, and as he looked a team and sledge appeared from  behind one of the cabins and halted close to the wall of the large  building. The driver was plainly visible, and to Howland's astonishment  he suddenly began to ascend the side of this wall. For the moment  Howland had not thought of a stair.
  Jean's attitude drew his eyes. The Frenchman had thrust himself half  out of the screening bushes and was staring through the telescope of  his hands. With an exclamation he turned quickly to the engineer.
  &#8220;Look, M'seur! Do you see that man climbing the stair? I don't mind  telling you that he is the one who hit you over the head on the trail,  and also one of those who shut you up in the coyote. Those are his  quarters at the post, and possibly he is going up to see Meleese. If  you were much of a shot you could settle a score or two from here,  M'seur.&#8221;
  The figure had stopped, evidently on a platform midway up the side  of the building. He stood for a moment as if scanning the plain between  him and the mountain, then disappeared. Howland had not spoken a word,  but every nerve in his body tingled strangely.
  &#8220;You say Meleese&#8212;is there?&#8221; he questioned hesitatingly. &#8220;And  he&#8212;who is that man, Croisset?&#8221;
  Jean shrugged his shoulders and drew himself back into the bush,  turning leisurely toward the old cabin.
  &#8220;<I>Non</I>, M'seur, I will not tell you that,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I  have brought you to this place. I have pointed out to you the stair  that leads to the room where you will find Meleese. You may cut me into  ribbons for the ravens, but I will tell you no more!&#8221;
  Again the threatening fire leaped into Howland's eyes.
  &#8220;I will trouble you to put your hands behind your back, Croisset,&#8221;  he commanded. &#8220;I am going to return a certain compliment of yours by  tying your hands with this piece of babeesh, which you used on me.  After that&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;And after that, M'seur&#8212;&#8221; urged Jean, with a touch of the old taunt  in his voice, and stopping with his back to the engineer and his hands  behind him. &#8220;After that?&#8221;
  &#8220;You will tell me all that I want to know,&#8221; finished Howland,  tightening the thong about his wrists.
  He led the way then to the cabin. The door was closed, but opened  readily as he put his weight against it. The single room was lighted by  a window through which a mass of snow had drifted, and contained  nothing more than a rude table built against one of the log walls,  three supply boxes that had evidently been employed as stools, and a  cracked and rust-eaten sheet-iron stove that had from all appearances  long passed into disuse. He motioned the Frenchman to a seat at one end  of the table. Without a word he then went outside, securely toggled the  leading dog, and returning, closed the door and seated himself at the  end of the table opposite Jean.
  The light from the open window fell full on Croisset's dark face and  shone in a silvery streak along the top of Howland's revolver as the  muzzle of it rested casually on a line with the other's breast. There  was a menacing click as the engineer drew back the hammer.
  &#8220;Now, my dear Jean, we're ready to begin the real game,&#8221; he  explained. &#8220;Here we are, high and dry, and down there&#8212;just far enough  away to be out of hearing of this revolver when I shoot&#8212;are those  we're going to play against. So far I've been completely in the dark. I  know of no reason why I shouldn't go down there openly and be welcomed  and given a good supper. And yet at the same time I know that my life  wouldn't be worth a tinker's damn if I<I> did</I> go down. You can  clear up the whole business, and that's what you're going to do. When I  understand why I am scheduled to be murdered on sight I won't be  handicapped as I now am. So go ahead and spiel. If you don't, I'll blow  your head off.&#8221;
  Jean sat unflinching, his lips drawn tightly, his head set square  and defiant.
  &#8220;You may shoot, M'seur,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;I have sworn on a cross  of the Virgin to tell you no more than I have. You could not torture me  into revealing what you ask.&#8221;
  Slowly Howland raised his revolver.
  &#8220;Once more, Croisset&#8212;will you tell me?&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Non</I>, M'seur&#8212;&#8221;
  A deafening explosion filled the little cabin. From the lobe of  Jean's ear there ran a red trickle of blood. His face had gone deathly  pale. But even as the bullet had stung him within an inch of his brain  he had not flinched.
  &#8220;Will you tell me, Croisset?&#8221;
  This time the black pit of the engineer's revolver centered squarely  between the Frenchman's eyes.
  &#8220;<I>Non</I>, M'seur.&#8221;
  The eyes of the two men met over the blue steel. With a cry Howland  slowly lowered his weapon.
  &#8220;Good God, but you're a brave man, Jean Croisset!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I'd  sooner kill a dozen men that I know than you!&#8221;
  He rose to his feet and went to the door. There was still but little  snow in the air. To the north the horizon was growing black with the  early approach of the northern night. With a nervous laugh he returned  to Jean.
  &#8220;Deuce take it if I don't feel like apologizing to you,&#8221; he  exclaimed. &#8220;Does your ear hurt?&#8221;
  &#8220;No more than if I had scratched it with a thorn,&#8221; returned Jean  politely. &#8220;You are good with the pistol, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would not profit by killing you&#8212;just now,&#8221; mused Howland,  seating himself again on the box and resting his chin in the palm of  his hand as he looked across at the other. &#8220;But that's a pretty good  intimation that I'm desperate and mean business, Croisset. We won't  quarrel about the things I've asked you. What I'm here for is to see  Meleese. Now&#8212;how is that to happen?&#8221;
  &#8220;For the life of me I don't know,&#8221; replied Jean, as calmly as though  a bullet had not nipped the edge of his ear a moment before. &#8220;There is  only one way I can see, M'seur, and that is to wait and watch from this  mountain top until Meleese drives out her dogs. She has her own team,  and in ordinary seasons frequently goes out alone or with one of the  women at the post.<I> Mon Dieu</I>, she has had enough sledge-riding of  late, and I doubt if she will find pleasure in her dogs for a long  time.&#8221;
  &#8220;I had planned to use you,&#8221; said Howland, &#8220;but I've lost faith in  you. Honestly, Croisset, I believe you would stick me in the back  almost as quickly as those murderers down there.&#8221; &#8220;Not in the back,  M'seur,&#8221; smiled the Frenchman, unmoved. &#8220;I have had opportunities to do  that.<I> Non</I>, since that fight back there I do not believe that I  want to kill you.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I would be a fool to trust you. Isn't that so?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not if I gave you my word. That is something we do not break up  here as you do down among the Wekusko people, and farther south.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you murder people for pastime&#8212;eh, my dear Jean?&#8221;
  Croisset shrugged his shoulders without speaking.
  &#8220;See here, Croisset,&#8221; said Howland with sudden earnestness, &#8220;I'm  almost tempted to take a chance with you. Will you go down to the post  to-night, in some way gain access to Meleese, and give her a message  from me?&#8221;
  &#8220;And the message&#8212;what would it be?&#8221;
  &#8220;It would bring Meleese up to this cabin&#8212;to-night.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you sure, M'seur?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am certain that it would. Will you go?&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Non</I>, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;The devil take you!&#8221; cried Howland angrily. &#8220;If I was not certain  that I would need you later I'd garrote you where you sit.&#8221;
  He rose and went to the old stove. It was still capable of holding  fire, and as it had grown too dark outside for the smoke to be observed  from the post, he proceeded to prepare a supper of hot coffee and meat.  Jean watched him in silence, and not until food and drink were on the  table did the engineer himself break silence.
  &#8220;Of course, I'm not going to feed you,&#8221; he said curtly, &#8220;so I'll  have to free your hands. But be careful.&#8221;
  He placed his revolver on the table beside him after he had freed  Croisset.
  &#8220;I might assassinate you with a fork!&#8221; chuckled the Frenchman  softly, his black eyes laughing over his coffee cup. &#8220;I drink your  health, M'seur, and wish you happiness!&#8221;
  &#8220;You lie!&#8221; snapped Howland.
  Jean lowered the cup without drinking.
  &#8220;It's the truth, M'seur,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;Since that<I> bee</I>-utiful  fight back there I can not help but wish you happiness. I drink also to  the happiness of Meleese, also to the happiness of those who tried to  kill you on the trail and at the coyote. But,<I> Mon Dieu</I>, how is  it all to come? Those at the post are happy because they believe that  you are dead. You will not be happy until they are dead. And  Meleese&#8212;how will all this bring happiness to her? I tell you that I am  as deep in trouble as you, M'seur Howland. May the Virgin strike me  dead if I'm not!&#8221;
  He drank, his eyes darkening gloomily. In that moment there flashed  into Howland's mind a memory of the battle that Jean had fought for him  on the Great North Trail.
  &#8220;You nearly killed one of them&#8212;that night&#8212;at Prince Albert,&#8221; he  said slowly. &#8220;I can't understand why you fought for me then and won't  help me now. But you did. And you're afraid to go down there&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Until I have regrown a beard,&#8221; interrupted Jean with a low  chuckling laugh. &#8220;You would not be the only one to die if they saw me  again like this. But that is enough, M'seur. I will say no more.&#8221;
  &#8220;I really don't want to make you uncomfortable, Jean,&#8221; Howland  apologized, as he secured the Frenchman's hands again after they had  satisfied their hearty appetites, &#8220;but unless you swear by your Virgin  or something else that you will make no attempt to call assistance I  shall have to gag you. What do you say?&#8221;
  &#8220;I will make no outcry, M'seur. I give you my word for that.&#8221;
  With another length of babeesh Howland tied his companion's legs.
  &#8220;I'm going to investigate a little,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I am not afraid  of your voice, for if you begin to shout I will hear you first. But  with your legs free you might take it into your head to run away.&#8221;
  &#8220;Would you mind spreading a blanket on the floor, M'seur? If you are  gone long this box will grow hard and sharp.&#8221;
  A few minutes later, after he had made his prisoner as comfortable  as possible in the cabin, Howland went again through the fringe of  scrub bush to the edge of the ridge. Below him the plain was lost in  the gloom of night. He could see nothing of the buildings at the post  but two or three lights gleaming faintly through the darkness. Overhead  there were no stars; thickening snow shut out what illumination there  might have been in the north, and even as he stood looking into the  desolation to the west the snow fell faster and the lights grew fainter  and fainter until all was a chaos of blackness.
  In these moments a desire that was almost madness swept over him.  Since his fight with Jean the swift passing of events had confined his  thoughts to their one objective&#8212;the finding of Meleese and her people.  He had assured himself that his every move was to be a cool and  calculating one, that nothing&#8212;not even his great love&#8212;should urge him  beyond that reason which had made him a master-builder among men. As he  stood with the snow falling heavily on him he knew that his trail would  be covered before another day&#8212;that for an indefinite period he might  safely wait and watch for Meleese on the mountain top. And yet, slowly,  he made his way down the side of the ridge. A little way out there in  the gloom, barely beyond the call of his voice, was the girl for whom  he was willing to sacrifice all that he had ever achieved in life. With  each step the desire in him grew&#8212;the impulse to bring himself nearer  to her, to steal across the plain, to approach in the silent smother of  the storm until he could look on the light which Jean Croisset had told  him would gleam from her window.
  He descended to the foot of the ridge and headed into the plain,  taking the caution to bury his feet deep in the snow that he might have  a trail to guide him back to the cabin. At first he found himself  impeded by low bush. Then the plain became more open, and he knew that  there was nothing but the night and the snow to shut out his vision  ahead. Still he had no motive, no reason for what he did. The snow  would cover his tracks before morning. There would be no harm done, and  he might get a glimpse of the light, of<I> her</I> light.
  It came on his vision with a suddenness that set his heart leaping.  A dog barked ahead of him, so near that he stopped in his tracks, and  then suddenly there shot through the snow-gloom the bright gleam of a  lamp. Before he had taken another breath he was aware of what had  happened. A curtain had been drawn aside in the chaos ahead. He was  almost on the walls of the post&#8212;and the light gleamed from high, up,  from the head of the stair!
  For a space he stood still, listening and watching. There was no  other light, no other sound after the barking of the dog. About him the  snow fell with fluttering noiselessness and it filled him with a  sensation of safety. The sharpest eyes could not see him, the keenest  ears could not hear him&#8212;and he advanced again until before him there  rose out of the gloom a huge shadowy mass that was blacker than the  night itself. The one lighted window was plainly visible now, its  curtain two-thirds drawn, and as he looked a shadow passed over it. Was  it a woman's shadow? The window darkened as the figure within came  nearer to it, and Howland stood with clenched hands and wildly beating  heart, almost ready to call out softly a name. A little nearer&#8212;one  more step&#8212;and he would know. He might throw a chunk of snow-crust, a  cartridge from his belt&#8212;and then&#8212;
  The shadow disappeared. Dimly Howland made out the snow-covered  stair, and he went to it and looked up. Ten feet above him the light  shone out.
  He looked into the gloom behind him, into the gloom out of which he  had come. Nothing&#8212;nothing but the storm. Swiftly he mounted the stair.
