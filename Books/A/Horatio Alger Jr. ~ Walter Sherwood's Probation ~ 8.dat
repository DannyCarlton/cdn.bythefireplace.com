  Walter was tempted to stop over at Niagara, as his ticket would  have  allowed him to do, but he was also very anxious to reach Chicago  and  get to work. &quot;I can visit Niagara some other time,&quot; he reflected.  &quot;Now  I can spare neither the money nor the time.&quot; 
  Hour after hour sped by, until with a little thrill of excitement   Walter learned by consulting his railroad guide that he was within   fifty miles of Chicago. He looked out of the car window, and surveyed   with interest the country through which they were speeding at the rate   of thirty-five miles an hour. His attention was drawn from the   panorama outside by a voice: 
  &quot;Is this seat engaged?&quot; 
  Walter looked up, and his glance rested on a man of perhaps thirty-   five, dressed in a light suit, and wearing a tall white hat. 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered Walter politely, removing his gripsack from the   seat. 
  &quot;I don't want to incommode you,&quot; said the stranger, as he took the   place thus vacated. 
  &quot;You don't in the least,&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;I suppose you are going to Chicago?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you going farther&#8212;out to Dakota, for instance?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir. Chicago is far enough west for me at present.&quot; 
  &quot;I live in Dakota. I have a long journey to make after we reach   Chicago.&quot; &quot;I don't know about Dakota. Is it a good place for   business?&quot; 
  &quot;It is going to be. Yes, Dakota has a bright future. I have a  pleasant  little home out there. I had to go East on business, and  stayed a  little longer than I intended. In fact I spent more money  than I  anticipated, and that makes me a little short.&quot; 
  It struck Walter that his new acquaintance for a stranger was very   confidential. 
  &quot;Is it possible he will propose to borrow money of me?&quot; he asked   himself. He did not quite know what to say, but politeness required   him to say something. 
  &quot;I am sorry,&quot; he replied, in a sympathizing tone. 
  &quot;I should like to take a train this evening for my home,&quot; continued   the stranger. 
  &quot;I hope you will be able to do so.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, there's one drawback. I haven't got money enough to buy a   through ticket. Under these circumstances I am going to offer you a   bargain.&quot; 
  Walter looked surprised and expectant. The stranger drew a gold  watch  from his pocket&#8212;a very handsome gold watch, which looked  valuable. 
  &quot;You see that watch?&quot; he said. &quot;How much do you think it is worth?&quot; 
  &quot;It looks like a nice watch. I am no judge of values.&quot; 
  &quot;It cost me ninety dollars six months since. Now I need the money,  and  I will sell it to you for twenty-five.&quot; 
  &quot;But that would be a great sacrifice.&quot; 
  &quot;So it would, but I need the money. Of course, if you haven't got  the  money&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I have that amount of money,&quot; said Walter, &quot;but I haven't got it  to  spare. I might need it.&quot; 
  &quot;Then all you need to do is to sell the watch or pawn it. You could   sell it for fifty dollars without trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;Why don't you do that?&quot; asked Walter shrewdly. 
  &quot;Because I haven't the time. I want, if possible, to go on  to-night.  If you had a wife and two children waiting for you, whom you  had not  seen for two months, you wouldn't mind losing a few dollars  for the  sake of seeing them a little sooner.&quot; 
  &quot;Very likely,&quot; answered Walter, to whom his companion's explanation   seemed plausible. 
  Walter was tempted, but he reflected that twenty-five dollars   represented a third of the money he had with him, so he put away the   temptation, but with reluctance. He had a silver watch, bought for   him, when he entered college, at a cost of fifteen dollars, and like   the majority of boys of his age he felt that he should much prefer to   carry a gold one. Still he must be prudent. 
  &quot;No,&quot; he said, shaking his head, &quot;I don't think I had better buy  the  watch. I presume you will find some one else on the train who  would be  glad of the bargain.&quot; 
  &quot;Very likely, but we are near Chicago, and I haven't time to look   around. Come, I'll make you a still better offer, though I ought not   to do so. You may have the watch for twenty dollars. That money will   get me through, and I won't haggle about five dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;Twenty dollars!&quot; repeated Walter thoughtfully. 
  &quot;Yes, look at the watch. Isn't it a beauty?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I like the appearance of it very much.&quot; 
  &quot;If you get out of money, you can easily pawn it for more than the  sum  I ask for it.&quot; 
  Certainly this was an important consideration. Walter felt that he   would be foolish to lose so good a chance. It was a pity that the   stranger should be forced to make such a sacrifice, yet it really   seemed that he would be doing him a favor, as well as benefiting   himself, by accepting his proposition. 
  &quot;You will guarantee it to be solid gold?&quot; he said, with momentary   suspicion. 
  &quot;Certainly. You will see that it is an Elgin watch. Of course you  know  the reputation of that make. They don't make any sham watches at  their  factory.&quot; 
  &quot;I thought the case might be gilt,&quot; said Walter, half ashamed of  his  suspicions. 
  &quot;You do well to be cautious, but I will guarantee the watch to be  all  I represent it. I only wish you were a jeweler. Then you could  judge  for yourself.&quot; 
  It sounded very plausible. Then, the watch was a very handsome one. 
  &quot;Let me open it and show you the works.&quot; 
  The stranger did so. Walter was no judge of the mechanism of a  watch,  but what he saw impressed him favorably. The stranger seemed  very  frank and fair-spoken. Walter knew, of course, that in traveling  one  was likely to meet with sharpers, but that did not justify him in   suspecting everybody he met. 
  &quot;It would look very nice at the end of my chain,&quot; he thought. &quot;I   suppose I cannot afford it; but, as he says, I can raise money on it   at any time.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, young man, what is your decision? You must excuse me for   hurrying, but we are not far from Chicago, and I want to make sure   that I can continue my journey to-night. I shall telegraph to my wife   that I am coming.&quot; 
  &quot;I will take the watch,&quot; said Walter. &quot;There doesn't seem to be  much  risk in doing so.&quot; 
  &quot;Bosh! I should say not. Young man, I congratulate you. You have  made  the best bargain of your life. Have you got the money handy?&quot; 
  Walter took out two ten-dollar bills and handed them to his  companion,  receiving the watch in exchange. 
  &quot;Well, that settles my mind,&quot; said the stranger, in a tone of   satisfaction. &quot;I shall see the old woman and the kids very soon,   thanks to your kindness.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't mention it,&quot; said Walter complacently. &quot;I feel indebted to  you,  rather, as you have given me much more than an equivalent for my   money.&quot; 
  &quot;That is true, but under present circumstances money is worth a  good  deal to me. Now, if you don't mind I will go into the smoking-car  and  have a little smoke before we arrive. Will you join me?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir, thank you; I don't smoke.&quot; 
  &quot;Good-day, then. Hope we shall meet again.&quot; 
  Walter responded politely, and the stranger, rising, walked forward  to  the front part of the car and disappeared. 
  Walter detached the silver watch from the plated chain to which it  was  attached, substituted the new gold watch, and put the silver watch  in  his pocket. It occurred to him that if he should really need money  it  might be better for him to sell the silver watch and retain the  gold  one. 
  &quot;I have made thirty dollars at the very least on my purchase,&quot; he   reflected, &quot;for I am sure I can sell the watch for fifty dollars if I   wish to do so. This is a white day for me, as the Romans used to say.   I accept it as a good omen of success. I wish Doctor Mack and Nancy   were here to see it. I think the doctor would give me credit for a   little shrewdness.&quot; 
  The car sped on perhaps a dozen miles farther, when the door opened   and the conductor entered, followed by a stout man of perhaps fifty   years of age, who looked flushed and excited. 
  &quot;This gentleman has been robbed of his gold watch,&quot; explained the   conductor. &quot;He is convinced that some one on the train has taken it.   Of course, no one of you is suspected, but I will trouble you to show   me your watches.&quot; 
  As Walter heard these words a terrible fear assailed him. Had he   bought a stolen watch?
