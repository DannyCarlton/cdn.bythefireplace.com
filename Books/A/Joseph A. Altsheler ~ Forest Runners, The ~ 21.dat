Although the terrible ford had been won, Henry Ware knew that the danger  was far from over. The savages, caught on the flank and shot down from  above, had yielded to momentary panic, but they would come again. To any  souls less daring than this band of pioneers, the situation would have  been truly appalling. They were in the vast and unknown wilderness,  surrounded everywhere by the black forest, with the horde, hungry for  slaughter, still hanging upon their flanks; but among them all, scarce one  woman or child showed a craven heart.    
Led by Henry Ware, the wagons filed into an open space--a plain or little  prairie--about a quarter of a mile beyond the ford, and there, still  following his instructions, they drew up in a circle. He considered this  open space a godsend, as no marksmen hidden in the woods could reach them  there with a bullet. As soon as the circle was completed, the women and  children poured forth from the wagons, and began to join the men in  fortifying. There was mingled joy for victory and grief for loss. They had  left dead behind in the river, and they had brought more with them; of  wounds, except those that threatened to be mortal, they took little count.  Even as they worked, scattering shots were fired from the forest, but they  paid no heed to them, as all the bullets fell short.    
Right in the center of the circle, inclosed by the wagons, a half dozen  chosen spademen dug a deep hole, and then the dead were brought forth,  ready for burial. A minister prayed and the women sang. Overhead, the late  sun burned brilliant and red, and from the forest, as a kind of stern  chorus, came the pattering rifle shots. But the last ceremony, all the  more solemn and impressive because of these sights and sounds, went on  unbroken. The dead were buried deep, then covered over, and the ground  trodden that none might disturb their rest. Then all turned to the living  need.    
The five, barring slight scratches suffered by Ross and Shif'less Sol, had  escaped unhurt, and now they labored with the others to throw up the wall  of earth about the wagons. A spring took its rise in the center of the  plain, and flowed down to the river. This spring was within the circle of  the wagons, and they were assured of plenty of water.    
Henry Ware looked over the crowd, and he rejoiced at their spirits, which  had not been dampened by the sight of their dead. They had fought  magnificently, and they were ready to fight again. Already fires were  burning within the circle of the wagons, and the women were cooking  supper. The pleasant odor of food arose, and men began to eat. Daniel Poe,  as usual, turned to Henry.    
"You are sure that they will make a new attack?" he said.    
"Yes," replied Henry. "They have not come so far to retire after one  repulse. We outflanked them there at the river, but they think that they  will certainly get us, burdened as we are with the women and children.  It's still a long road to Wareville."    
"We can never repay the debt we owe to you and your comrades," said Daniel  Poe.    
"Don't think of it. It's the thing that we were bound to do."    
Daniel Poe looked at the setting sun, now red like blood. Far over the  western forest twilight shadows were coming.    
"I wish this night was over," he said.    
"If they attack we'll beat them off," said Henry confidently.    
"But the cost, the cost!" murmured Daniel Poe.    
Paul meanwhile was within the circle of wagons, in his great role of  sustainer. He had fought like a paladin in the battle, and now he was  telling what a great fight they had made, and what a greater one they  could make, if need be. High spirits seemed to flow spontaneously from  him, and the others caught the infection. More than one Amazon looked at  him affectionately, as she would have looked at a son. Shif'less Sol  joined him as he stood by one of the fires.    
"I've been workin' out thar with a spade more'n an hour," said the  shiftless one in a tone of deep disgust, "an' I'm tired plumb to death.  I'll lay down before that fire an' sleep till mornin', ef every one uv you  will promise not to say a word an' won't disturb me."    
A laugh arose.    
"Why, Mr. Hyde," exclaimed one of the Amazons, "they say there was not a  more industrious man in the battle than you."    
"Wa'al," said Shif'less Sol, slowly and reflectively, "a man, ef he's  crowded into a corner, will fight ef his life depends on it, but I kin  come purty near to livin' without work."    
"You deserve your sleep, Mr. Hyde," said the woman. "Just stretch out  there before the fire."    
"I'll stretch out, but I won't sleep," said the shiftless one.    
He was as good as his word, and admiring hands brought him food, which he  ate contentedly. Presently he said in a low voice to Paul:    
"That's right, Paul, hearten 'em up. They've got a lot to stand yet, an'  it's courage that counts."    
Paul knew this truth full well, and he went back and forth in the circle,  ever performing his chosen task, while Henry outside planned and labored  incessantly for the defense against a new attack. Fifty men, sharp of eye  and ear, were selected to watch through half the night, when fifty more,  also sharp of eye and ear, were to take their places. All the others were  to sleep, if they could, in order that they might be strong and fresh for  what the next day would bring forth.    
The scattering fire from the forest ceased, and everything there became  silent. No dusky forms were visible to the defenders. The sun dropped  behind the hills, and night, thick and dark, came over the earth. The  peace of the world was strange and solemn, and those in the beleaguered  camp felt oppressed by the darkness and the mystery. They could not see  any enemies or hear any, and after a while they began to argue that since  the savages could no longer be seen or heard, they must have gone away.  But Henry Ware only laughed as they told him so.    
"They have not gone," he said to Daniel Poe, "nor will they go to-night  nor to-morrow nor the next night. This train, when it starts in the  morning, must be a moving fort."    
Daniel Poe sighed. As always, he believed what Henry Ware said, and the  prospect did not invite.    
The darkness and the silence endured. The keenest of the watchers saw and  heard nothing. The moon came out and the earth lightened, then darkened  again as clouds rolled across the heavens; the camp fires sank, and,  despite their alarms, many slept. The wounded, all of whom had received  the rude but effective surgery of the border, were quiet, and the whole  camp bore the aspect of peace. Paul slipped from the circle, and joined  Henry outside the earthwork.    
"Do you see anything, Henry?" he said.    
"No, but I've heard," replied Henry, who had just come out of the  darkness. "The Shawnees are before us, the Miamis behind us, and the  warriors of the smaller tribes on either side. The night may pass without  anything happening, or it may not. But we have good watchers."    
Paul stayed with him a little while, but, at Henry's urgent request, he  went back inside the circle, wrapped himself in a blanket and lay down,  his face upturned to the cloudy skies which he did not see. He did not  think he could sleep. His brain throbbed with excitement, and his vivid  imagination was wide awake. Despite the danger, he rejoiced to be there;  rejoiced that he and his comrades should help in the saving of all these  people. The spiritual exaltation that he felt at times swept over him.  Nevertheless, all the pictures faded, his excited nerves sank to rest,  and, with his face still upturned to the cloudy skies, he slept.    
Far after midnight a sudden ring of fire burst from the dark forest, and  women and children leaped up at the crash of many rifles. Shouting their  war whoop, the tribesmen rushed upon the camp; but the fifty sentinels,  sheltered by the earthwork, met them with a fire more deadly than their  own, and in a moment the fifty became more than two hundred.    
Red Eagle and Yellow Panther had hoped for a surprise, but when the  unerring volleys met them, they sank back again into the forest, carrying  their dead with them.    
"You were right," said Daniel Poe to Henry Ware; "they will not leave us."    
"Not while they think there is a chance to overpower us. But we've shown  'em they can't count on a surprise."    
The camp, except the watchers, went back to sleep, and the night passed  away without a second alarm. Dawn came, gray and cloudy, and the people  of the train awoke to their needs, which they faced bravely. Breakfast was  cooked and eaten, and then the wagons, in a file of four, took up their  march, a cloud of keen-eyed and brave skirmishers on every side. The train  had truly become what Henry said it must be, a moving fort; and, though  the savages opened fire in the woods, they dared not attack in force, so  resolute and sure-eyed were the skirmishers and so strong a defense were  the heavy wagons.    
All day long this terrible march proceeded, the women and children  sheltered in the wagons, and the savages, from the shelter of the forest,  keeping up an irregular but unceasing fire on the flanks. The white  skirmishers replied often with deadly effect, but it grew galling, almost  unbearable. The Indians, who were accustomed either to rapid success or  rapid retreat, showed an extraordinary persistence, and Henry suspected  that Braxton Wyatt was urging them on. As he thought of the effect of  these continued attacks upon the train, he grew anxious. The bravest  spirit could be worn down by them, and he sought in vain for a remedy.    
They camped the second night in an open place, and fortified, as before,  with a circular earthwork; but they were harried throughout all the hours  of darkness by irregular firing and occasional war whoops. Fewer people  slept that night than had slept the night before. Nerves were raw and  suffering, and Paul found his chosen task a hard one. But he worked  faithfully, going up and down within the fortified circle, cheering,  heartening, and predicting a better day for the morrow.    
That day came, cloudless and brilliant above, but to the accompaniment of  shouts, shots, and alarms below. Once more the terrible march was resumed,  and the savages still hung mercilessly on their flanks. Henry, with  anxious heart, noticed a waning of spirit, though not of courage, in the  train. The raw nerves grew rawer. This incessant marching forward between  the very walls of death could not be endured forever. Again he sought a  way out. Such a way they must have, and at last he believed that he had  found it. But he said nothing at present, and the train, edged on either  side with fire and smoke, went on through the woods.    
A third time they camped in an open space, a third time they fortified;  but now, after the supper was over, Henry called a council of the leaders.    
"We cannot go on as we have been going," he said. "The savages hang to us  with uncommon tenacity, and there are limits to human endurance."    
Daniel Poe shook his head sadly. The awful lacerating process had never  ceased. More men were wounded, and the spirits of all grew heavier and  heavier. Paul still walked among the fires, seeking to cheer and inspire,  but he could do little. Dread oppressed the women and children, and they  sat mostly in silence. Outside, an occasional whoop came from the depths  of the forest, and now and then a rifle was fired. The night was coming  on, thick and ominous. The air had been heavy all the day, and now somber  clouds were rolling across the sky. At intervals flashes of lightning  flared low down on the black forest. Heavy and somber, like the skies,  were the spirits of all the people. A wounded horse neighed shrilly, and  in an almost human voice, as he died.    
"We must take a new step," said Henry; "things cannot go on this way. It  is yet a hundred and fifty miles, perhaps, to Wareville, and if the  savages continue to hang on, we can never reach it."    
"What do you propose?" asked Daniel Poe.    
Henry Ware stood erect. The light of the council fire flared upon his  splendid, indomitable face. All relied upon him, and he knew it.    
"I have a plan," he said. "To-morrow we can reach an unforested hill that  I know of, with a spring flowing out of the side. It is easy to hold, and  we shall have plenty of water. We will stop there and make our stand.  Meanwhile, we will send to Wareville for help. The messenger must leave  to-night. Jim Hart, are you ready?"    
Jim Hart had been sitting on a fallen tree, all humped together. Now he  unfolded himself and stood up, stretched out to his complete length, six  feet four inches of long, slim man, knotted and jointed, but as tough as  wire--the swiftest runner in all the West. Long Jim, ugly, honest, and  brave, said nothing, but his movement showed that he was ready.    
"Jim Hart was made for speed," continued Henry. "At his best he is like  the wind, and he can run all the way to Wareville. He'll leave in a half  hour, before the moon has a chance to rise."    
"He'll never get through!" exclaimed Daniel Poe.    
"Oh, yes, he will!" said Henry confidently. "Bring all the men Wareville  can spare, Jim, and fall upon them while they are besieging us at the  Table Rock."    
Little more was said. Had the train afforded paint, they would have  stained Jim's face in the Indian way; but the utmost that they could do  was to draw up his hair and tie it in a scalp lock, like those of the  Shawnees. Fortunately, his hair was dark, and his face was so thoroughly  tanned by weather that it might be mistaken in the night for an Indian's.  Then Long Jim was ready. He merely shook the hands of his four comrades  and of Daniel Poe, and without another word went forth.    
The night was at its darkest when Jim Hart slipped under one of the wagons  and crept across the open space. The heavy clouds had grown heavier, and  now and then low thunder muttered on the horizon. The fitful lightning  ceased, and this was occasion for thanks.    
Jim Hart crept about twenty yards from the circle of the wagons, and then  he lay flat upon the earth. He could see nothing in the surrounding rim of  forest, nor could he hear anything. A light hum from the camp behind him  was all that came to his ears. He slipped forward again in a stooping  position, stopped a moment when he heard a rifle shot from the other side  of the camp, and then resumed his shambling, but swift, journey. Now he  passed the open space and gained the edge of the woods. Here the danger  lay, but the brave soul of Long Jim never faltered.    
He plunged into the gloom of the bushes and trees, slipping silently among  them. Two warriors glanced curiously at him in the dark, but in a moment  he was gone; a third farther on spoke to him, but he shook his head  impatiently, as if he bore some message, and only walked the faster. Now  his keen eyes saw savages all around him, some talking, others standing or  lying down, quite silent. He was sorry now that he was so tall, as his was  a figure that would cause remark anywhere; but he stooped over, trying to  hide his great height as much as possible. He passed one group, then two,  then three, and now he was a full four hundred yards from the camp. His  curving flight presently brought him near three men who were talking  earnestly together. They noticed Hart at the same time, and one of them  beckoned to him. Long Jim pretended not to see, and went on. Then one of  them called to him angrily, and Jim recognized the voice of Braxton Wyatt.    
Long Jim stopped a moment, uncertain what to do at that critical juncture,  and Braxton Wyatt, stepping forward, seized him by the arm. It was dark in  the woods, but the renegade, looking up, recognized the face and figure.    
"Jim Hart!" he cried.    
Long Jim's right hand was grasping the stock of his rifle, but his left  suddenly flashed out and smote Braxton Wyatt full in the face. The  renegade gasped and went down unconscious, and then Long Jim turned, and  ran with all the speed that was in him, leaping over the low bushes and  racing among the tree trunks more like a phantom than a human being. A  shout arose behind him, and a dozen rifle shots were fired. He felt a  sting in his arm, and then blood dripped down; but it was only a flesh  wound, and he was spurred to greater speed.    
A terrible yell arose, and many warriors, trained runners of the forest,  with muscles of steel and a spirit that never tired, darted after him. But  Long Jim, bending his head a little lower, raced on through the dark, his  strength growing with every leap and his brain on fire with energy. He  passed two or three savages--far-flung outposts--but before they could  recover from their surprise he was by them and gone. Bullets sang past  him, but the long, slim figure cut the air like an arrow in the wind.  After him came the savages, but now he was beyond the last outposts, and  the footsteps of his pursuers were growing fainter behind. Now he opened  his mouth, and emitted a long, quavering, defiant yell--answer to their  own. After that he was silent, and sped on, never relaxing, tireless like  some powerful machine. The pursuit died away behind him, and though some  might hang on his trail, none could ever overtake him.    
The low thunder still muttered, and the fitful lightning began to flare  again. Now and then there were gusts of rain, swept by the wind; but  through all the hours of rain and dark the runner sped on, mile upon  mile.    
Day dawns and finds him still flitting! But now there is full need of thy  speed, Jim Hart! Five hundred lives hang upon it!    
Speed ye, Long Jim, speed ye!
