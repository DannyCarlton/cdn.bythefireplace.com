After my poor friend Le Geyt had murdered his wife, in a sudden  access of uncontrollable anger, under the deepest provocation, the  police naturally began to inquire for him. It is a way they have;  the police are no respecters of persons; neither do they pry into  the question of motives. They are but poor casuists. A murder is  for them a murder, and a murderer a murderer; it is not their habit  to divide and distinguish between case and case with Hilda Wade's  analytical accuracy.    
As soon as my duties at St. Nathaniel's permitted me, on the  evening of the discovery, I rushed round to Mrs. Mallet's, Le  Geyt's sister. I had been detained at the hospital for some hours,  however, watching a critical case; and by the time I reached Great  Stanhope Street I found Hilda Wade, in her nurse's dress, there  before me. Sebastian, it seemed, had given her leave out for the  evening. She was a supernumerary nurse, attached to his own  observation-cots as special attendant for scientific purposes, and  she could generally get an hour or so whenever she required it.    
Mrs. Mallet had been in the breakfast-room with Hilda before I  arrived; but as I reached the house she rushed upstairs to wash her  red eyes and compose herself a little before the strain of meeting  me; so I had the opportunity for a few words alone first with my  prophetic companion.    
"You said just now at Nathaniel's," I burst out, "that Le Geyt  would not be hanged: he would commit suicide. What did you mean by  that? What reason had you for thinking so?"    
Hilda sank into a chair by the open window, pulled a flower  abstractedly from the vase at her side, and began picking it to  pieces, floret after floret, with twitching fingers. She was  deeply moved. "Well, consider his family history," she burst out  at last, looking up at me with her large brown eyes as she reached  the last petal. "Heredity counts. . . . And after such a  disaster!"    
She said "disaster," not "crime"; I noted mentally the reservation  implied in the word.    
"Heredity counts," I answered. "Oh, yes. It counts much. But  what about Le Geyt's family history?" I could not recall any  instance of suicide among his forbears.    
"Well--his mother's father was General Faskally, you know," she  replied, after a pause, in her strange, oblique manner. "Mr. Le  Geyt is General Faskally's eldest grandson."    
"Exactly," I broke in, with a man's desire for solid fact in place  of vague intuition. "But I fail to see quite what that has to do  with it."    
"The General was killed in India during the Mutiny."    
"I remember, of course--killed, bravely fighting."    
"Yes; but it was on a forlorn hope, for which he volunteered, and  in the course of which he is said to have walked straight into an  almost obvious ambuscade of the enemy's."    
"Now, my dear Miss Wade"--I always dropped the title of "Nurse," by  request, when once we were well clear of Nathaniel's,--"I have  every confidence, you are aware, in your memory and your insight;  but I do confess I fail to see what bearing this incident can have  on poor Hugo's chances of being hanged or committing suicide."    
She picked a second flower, and once more pulled out petal after  petal. As she reached the last again, she answered, slowly: "You  must have forgotten the circumstances. It was no mere accident.  General Faskally had made a serious strategical blunder at Jhansi.  He had sacrificed the lives of his subordinates needlessly. He  could not bear to face the survivors. In the course of the  retreat, he volunteered to go on this forlorn hope, which might  equally well have been led by an officer of lower rank; and he was  permitted to do so by Sir Colin in command, as a means of  retrieving his lost military character. He carried his point, but  he carried it recklessly, taking care to be shot through the heart  himself in the first onslaught. That was virtual suicide--  honourable suicide to avoid disgrace, at a moment of supreme  remorse and horror."    
"You are right," I admitted, after a minute's consideration. "I  see it now--though I should never have thought of it."    
"That is the use of being a woman," she answered.    
I waited a second once more, and mused. "Still, that is only one  doubtful case," I objected.    
"There was another, you must remember: his uncle Alfred."    
"Alfred Le Geyt?"    
"No; <i>he</i> died in his bed, quietly. Alfred Faskally."    
"What a memory you have!" I cried, astonished. "Why, that was  before our time--in the days of the Chartist riots!"    
She smiled a certain curious sibylline smile of hers. Her earnest  face looked prettier than ever. "I told you I could remember many  things that happened before I was born," she answered. "<i>This</i> is  one of them."    
"You remember it directly?"    
"How impossible! Have I not often explained to you that I am no  diviner? I read no book of fate; I call no spirits from the vasty  deep. I simply remember with exceptional clearness what I read and  hear. And I have many times heard the story about Alfred  Faskally."    
"So have I--but I forget it."    
"Unfortunately, I <i>can't</i> forget. That is a sort of disease with  me. . . . He was a special constable in the Chartist riots; and  being a very strong and powerful man, like his nephew Hugo, he used  his truncheon--his special constable's baton, or whatever you call  it--with excessive force upon a starveling London tailor in the mob  near Charing Cross. The man was hit on the forehead--badly hit, so  that he died almost immediately of concussion of the brain. A woman  rushed out of the crowd at once, seized the dying man, laid his head  on her lap, and shrieked out in a wildly despairing voice that he  was her husband, and the father of thirteen children. Alfred  Faskally, who never meant to kill the man, or even to hurt him, but  who was laying about him roundly, without realising the terrific  force of his blows, was so horrified at what he had done when he  heard the woman's cry, that he rushed off straight to Waterloo  Bridge in an agony of remorse and--flung himself over. He was  drowned instantly."    
"I recall the story now," I answered; "but, do you know, as it was  told me, I think they said the mob <i>threw</i> Faskally over in their  desire for vengeance."    
"That is the official account, as told by the Le Geyts and the  Faskallys; they like to have it believed their kinsman was  murdered, not that he committed suicide. But my grandfather"--I  started; during the twelve months that I had been brought into  daily relations with Hilda Wade, that was the first time I had  heard her mention any member of her own family, except once her  mother--"my grandfather, who knew him well, and who was present in  the crowd at the time, assured me many times that Alfred Faskally  really jumped over of his own accord, <i>not</i> pursued by the mob, and  that his last horrified words as he leaped were, 'I never meant it!  I never meant it!' However, the family have always had luck in  their suicides. The jury believed the throwing-over story, and  found a verdict of 'wilful murder' against some person or persons  unknown."    
"Luck in their suicides! What a curious phrase! And you say,  <i>always</i>. Were there other cases, then?"    
"Constructively, yes; one of the Le Geyts, you must recollect, went  down with his ship (just like his uncle, the General, in India)  when he might have quitted her. It is believed he had given a  mistaken order. You remember, of course; he was navigating  lieutenant. Another, Marcus, was <i>said</i> to have shot himself by  accident while cleaning his gun--after a quarrel with his wife.  But you have heard all about it. 'The wrong was on my side,' he  moaned, you know, when they picked him up, dying, in the gun-room.  And one of the Faskally girls, his cousin, of whom his wife was  jealous--that beautiful Linda--became a Catholic, and went into a  convent at once on Marcus's death; which, after all, in such cases,  is merely a religious and moral way of committing suicide--I mean,  for a woman who takes the veil just to cut herself off from the  world, and who has no vocation, as I hear she had not."    
She filled me with amazement. "That is true," I exclaimed, "when  one comes to think of it. It shows the same temperament in  fibre. . . . But I should never have thought of it."    
"No? Well, I believe it is true, for all that. In every case, one  sees they choose much the same way of meeting a reverse, a blunder,  an unpremeditated crime. The brave way is to go through with it,  and face the music, letting what will come; the cowardly way is to  hide one's head incontinently in a river, a noose, or a convent  cell."    
"Le Geyt is not a coward," I interposed, with warmth.    
"No, not, a coward--a manly spirited, great-hearted gentleman--but  still, not quite of the bravest type. He lacks one element. The  Le Geyts have physical courage--enough and to spare--but their  moral courage fails them at a pinch. They rush into suicide or its  equivalent at critical moments, out of pure boyish impulsiveness."    
A few minutes later, Mrs. Mallet came in. She was not broken down--  on the contrary, she was calm--stoically, tragically, pitiably  calm; with that ghastly calmness which is more terrible by far than  the most demonstrative grief. Her face, though deadly white, did  not move a muscle. Not a tear was in her eyes. Even her bloodless  hands hardly twitched at the folds of her hastily assumed black  gown. She clenched them after a minute when she had grasped mine  silently; I could see that the nails dug deep into the palms in her  painful resolve to keep herself from collapsing.    
Hilda Wade, with infinite sisterly tenderness, led her over to a  chair by the window in the summer twilight, and took one quivering  hand in hers. "I have been telling Dr. Cumberledge, Lina, about  what I most fear for your dear brother, darling; and . . . I think  . . . he agrees with me."    
Mrs. Mallet turned to me, with hollow eyes, still preserving her  tragic calm. "I am afraid of it, too," she said, her drawn lips  tremulous. "Dr. Cumberledge, we must get him back! We must induce  him to face it!"    
"And yet," I answered, slowly, turning it over in my own mind; "he  has run away at first. Why should he do that if he means--to  commit suicide?" I hated to utter the words before that broken  soul; but there was no way out of it.    
Hilda interrupted me with a quiet suggestion. "How do you know he  has run away?" she asked. "Are you not taking it for granted that,  if he meant suicide, he would blow his brains out in his own house?  But surely that would not be the Le Geyt way. They are gentle-  natured folk; they would never blow their brains out or cut their  throats. For all we know, he may have made straight for Waterloo  Bridge,"--she framed her lips to the unspoken words, unseen by Mrs.  Mallet,--"like his uncle Alfred."    
"That is true," I answered, lip-reading. "I never thought of that  either."    
"Still, I do not attach importance to this idea," she went on. "I  have some reason for thinking he has run away . . . elsewhere; and  if so, our first task must be to entice him back again."    
"What are your reasons?" I asked, humbly. Whatever they might be,  I knew enough of Hilda Wade by this time to know that she had  probably good grounds for accepting them.    
"Oh, they may wait for the present," she answered. "Other things  are more pressing. First, let Lina tell us what she thinks of most  moment."    
Mrs. Mallet braced herself up visibly to a distressing effort.  "You have seen the body, Dr. Cumberledge?" she faltered.    
"No, dear Mrs. Mallet, I have not. I came straight from Nathaniel's.  I have had no time to see it."    
"Dr. Sebastian has viewed it by my wish--he has been so kind--and  he will be present as representing the family at the post-mortem.  He notes that the wound was inflicted with a dagger--a small  ornamental Norwegian dagger, which always lay, as I know, on the  little what-not by the blue sofa."    
I nodded assent. "Exactly; I have seen it there."    
"It was blunt and rusty--a mere toy knife--not at all the sort of  weapon a man would make use of who designed to commit a deliberate  murder. The crime, if there <i>was</i> a crime (which we do not admit),  must therefore have been wholly unpremeditated."    
I bowed my head. "For us who knew Hugo that goes without saying."    
She leaned forward eagerly. "Dr. Sebastian has pointed out to me a  line of defence which would probably succeed--if we could only  induce poor Hugo to adopt it. He has examined the blade and  scabbard, and finds that the dagger fits its sheath very tight, so  that it can only be withdrawn with considerable violence. The  blade sticks." (I nodded again.) "It needs a hard pull to wrench  it out. . . . He has also inspected the wound, and assures me its  character is such that it <i>might</i> have been self-inflicted." She  paused now and again, and brought out her words with difficulty.  "Self-inflicted, he suggests; therefore, that <i>this</i> may have  happened. It is admitted--<i>will</i> be admitted--the servants overheard  it--we can make no reservation there--a difference of opinion, an  altercation, even, took place between Hugo and Clara that evening"--  she started suddenly--"why, it was only last night--it seems like  ages--an altercation about the children's schooling. Clara held  strong views on the subject of the children"--her eyes blinked  hard--"which Hugo did not share. We throw out the hint, then, that  Clara, during the course of the dispute--we must call it a dispute--  accidentally took up this dagger and toyed with it. You know her  habit of toying, when she had no knitting or needlework. In the  course of playing with it (we suggest) she tried to pull the knife  out of its sheath; failed; held it up, so, point upward; pulled  again; pulled harder--with a jerk, at last the sheath came off; the  dagger sprang up; it wounded Clara fatally. Hugo, knowing that  they had disagreed, knowing that the servants had heard, and seeing  her fall suddenly dead before him, was seized with horror--the Le  Geyt impulsiveness!--lost his head; rushed out; fancied the  accident would be mistaken for murder. But why? A Q.C., don't  you know! Recently married! Most attached to his wife. It is  plausible, isn't it?"    
"So plausible," I answered, looking it straight in the face,  "that . . . it has but one weak point. We might make a coroner's  jury or even a common jury accept it, on Sebastian's expert  evidence. Sebastian can work wonders; but we could never make--"    
Hilda Wade finished the sentence for me as I paused: "Hugo Le Geyt  consent to advance it."    
I lowered my head. "You have said it," I answered.    
"Not for the children's sake?" Mrs. Mallet cried, with clasped  hands.    
"Not for the children's sake, even," I answered. "Consider for a  moment, Mrs. Mallet: <i>is</i> it true? Do you yourself <i>believe</i> it?"    
She threw herself back in her chair with a dejected face. "Oh, as  for that," she cried, wearily, crossing her hands, "before you and  Hilda, who know all, what need to prevaricate? How <i>can</i> I believe  it? We understand how it came about. That woman! That woman!"    
"The real wonder is," Hilda murmured, soothing her white hand,  "that he contained himself so long!"    
"Well, we all know Hugo," I went on, as quietly as I was able;  "and, knowing Hugo, we know that he might be urged to commit this  wild act in a fierce moment of indignation--righteous indignation  on behalf of his motherless girls, under tremendous provocation.  But we also know that, having once committed it, he would never  stoop to disown it by a subterfuge."    
The heart-broken sister let her head drop faintly. "So Hilda told  me," she murmured; "and what Hilda says in these matters is almost  always final."    
We debated the question for some minutes more. Then Mrs. Mallet  cried at last: "At any rate, he has fled for the moment, and his  flight alone brings the worst suspicion upon him. That is our  chief point. We must find out where he is; and if he has gone  right away, we must bring him back to London."    
"Where do you think he has taken refuge?"    
"The police, Dr. Sebastian has ascertained, are watching the  railway stations, and the ports for the Continent."    
"Very like the police!" Hilda exclaimed, with more than a touch of  contempt in her voice. "As if a clever man-of-the-world like Hugo  Le Geyt would run away by rail, or start off to the Continent!  Every Englishman is noticeable on the Continent. It would be sheer  madness!"    
"You think he has not gone there, then?" I cried, deeply  interested.    
"Of course not. That is the point I hinted at just now. He has  defended many persons accused of murder, and he often spoke to me  of their incredible folly, when trying to escape, in going by rail,  or in setting out from England for Paris. An Englishman, he used  to say, is least observed in his own country. In this case, I  think I <i>know</i> where he has gone, how he went there."    
"Where, then?"    
"<i>Where</i> comes last; <i>how</i> first. It is a question of inference."    
"Explain. We know your powers."    
"Well, I take it for granted that he killed her--we must not mince  matters--about twelve o'clock; for after that hour, the servants  told Lina, there was quiet in the drawing-room. Next, I conjecture,  he went upstairs to change his clothes: he could not go forth on the  world in an evening suit; and the housemaid says his black coat and  trousers were lying as usual on a chair in his dressing-room--which  shows at least that he was not unduly flurried. After that, he put  on another suit, no doubt--<i>what</i> suit I hope the police will not  discover too soon; for I suppose you must just accept the situation  that we are conspiring to defeat the ends of justice."    
"No, no!" Mrs. Mallet cried. "To bring him back voluntarily, that  he may face his trial like a man!"    
"Yes, dear. That is quite right. However, the next thing, of  course, would be that he would shave in whole or in part. His big  black beard was so very conspicuous; he would certainly get rid of  that before attempting to escape. The servants being in bed, he  was not pressed for time; he had the whole night before him. So,  of course, he shaved. On the other hand, the police, you may be  sure, will circulate his photograph--we must not shirk these  points"--for Mrs. Mallet winced again--"will circulate his  photograph, <i>beard and all</i>; and that will really be one of our great  safeguards; for the bushy beard so masks the face that, without it,  Hugo would be scarcely recognisable. I conclude, therefore, that  he must have shorn himself <i>before</i> leaving home; though naturally I  did not make the police a present of the hint by getting Lina to  ask any questions in that direction of the housemaid."    
"You are probably right," I answered. "But would he have a razor?"    
"I was coming to that. No; certainly he would not. He had not  shaved for years. And they kept no men-servants; which makes it  difficult for him to borrow one from a sleeping man. So what he  would do would doubtless be to cut off his beard, or part of it,  quite close, with a pair of scissors, and then get himself properly  shaved next morning in the first country town he came to."    
"The first country town?"    
"Certainly. That leads up to the next point. We must try to be  cool and collected." She was quivering with suppressed emotion  herself, as she said it, but her soothing hand still lay on Mrs.  Mallet's. "The next thing is--he would leave London."    
"But not by rail, you say?"    
"He is an intelligent man, and in the course of defending others  has thought about this matter. Why expose himself to the needless  risk and observation of a railway station? No; I saw at once what  he would do. Beyond doubt, he would cycle. He always wondered it  was not done oftener, under similar circumstances."    
"But has his bicycle gone?"    
"Lina looked. It has not. I should have expected as much. I told  her to note that point very unobtrusively, so as to avoid giving  the police the clue. She saw the machine in the outer hall as  usual."    
"He is too good a criminal lawyer to have dreamt of taking his  own," Mrs. Mallet interposed, with another effort.    
"But where could he have hired or bought one at that time of  night?" I exclaimed.    
"Nowhere--without exciting the gravest suspicion. Therefore, I  conclude, he stopped in London for the night, sleeping at an hotel,  without luggage, and paying for his room in advance. It is  frequently done, and if he arrived late, very little notice would  be taken of him. Big hotels about the Strand, I am told, have  always a dozen such casual bachelor guests every evening."    
"And then?"    
"And then, this morning, he would buy a new bicycle--a different  make from his own, at the nearest shop; would rig himself out, at  some ready-made tailor's, with a fresh tourist suit--probably an  ostentatiously tweedy bicycling suit; and, with that in his  luggage-carrier, would make straight on his machine for the  country. He could change in some copse, and bury his own clothes,  avoiding the blunders he has seen in others. Perhaps he might ride  for the first twenty or thirty miles out of London to some minor  side-station, and then go on by train towards his destination,  quitting the rail again at some unimportant point where the main  west road crosses the Great Western or the South-Western line."    
"Great Western or South-Western? Why those two in particular?  Then, you have settled in your own mind which direction he has  taken?"    
"Pretty well. I judge by analogy. Lina, your brother was brought  up in the West Country, was he not?"    
Mrs. Mallet gave a weary nod. "In North Devon," she answered; "on  the wild stretch of moor about Hartland and Clovelly."    
Hilda Wade seemed to collect herself. "Now, Mr. Le Geyt is  essentially a Celt--a Celt in temperament," she went on; "he comes  by origin and ancestry from a rough, heather-clad country; he  belongs to the moorland. In other words, his type is the  mountaineer's. But a mountaineer's instinct in similar  circumstances is--what? Why, to fly straight to his native  mountains. In an agony of terror, in an access of despair, when  all else fails, he strikes a bee-line for the hills he loves;  rationally or irrationally, he seems to think he can hide there.  Hugo Le Geyt, with his frank boyish nature, his great Devonian  frame, is sure to have done so. I know his mood. He has made for  the West Country!"    
"You are, right, Hilda," Mrs. Mallet exclaimed, with conviction.  "I'm quite sure, from what I know of Hugo, that to go to the West  would be his first impulse."    
"And the Le Geyts are always governed by first impulses," my  character-reader added.    
She was quite correct. From the time we two were at Oxford  together--I as an undergraduate, he as a don--I had always noticed  that marked trait in my dear old friend's temperament.    
After a short pause, Hilda broke the silence again. "The sea  again; the sea! The Le Geyts love the water. Was there any place  on the sea where he went much as a boy--any lonely place, I mean,  in that North Devon district?"    
Mrs. Mallet reflected a moment. "Yes, there was a little bay--a  mere gap in high cliffs, with some fishermen's huts and a few yards  of beach--where he used to spend much of his holidays. It was a  weird-looking break in a grim sea-wall of dark-red rocks, where the  tide rose high, rolling in from the Atlantic."    
"The very thing! Has he visited it since he grew up?"    
"To my knowledge, never."    
Hilda's voice had a ring of certainty. "Then <i>that</i> is where we  shall find him, dear! We must look there first. He is sure to  revisit just such a solitary spot by the sea when trouble overtakes  him."    
Later in the evening, as we were walking home towards Nathaniel's  together, I asked Hilda why she had spoken throughout with such  unwavering confidence. "Oh, it was simple enough," she answered.  "There were two things that helped me through, which I didn't like  to mention in detail before Lina. One was this: the Le Geyts have  all of them an instinctive horror of the sight of blood; therefore,  they almost never commit suicide by shooting themselves or cutting  their throats. Marcus, who shot himself in the gun-room, was an  exception to both rules; he never minded blood; he could cut up a  deer. But Hugo refused to be a doctor, because he could not stand  the sight of an operation; and even as a sportsman he never liked  to pick up or handle the game he had shot himself; he said it  sickened him. He rushed from that room last night, I feel sure, in  a physical horror at the deed he had done; and by now he is as far  as he can get from London. The sight of his act drove him away;  not craven fear of an arrest. If the Le Geyts kill themselves--a  seafaring race on the whole--their impulse is to trust to water."    
"And the other thing?"    
"Well, that was about the mountaineer's homing instinct. I have  often noticed it. I could give you fifty instances, only I didn't  like to speak of them before Lina. There was Williams, for  example, the Dolgelly man who killed a game-keeper at Petworth in a  poaching affray; he was taken on Cader Idris, skulking among rocks,  a week later. Then there was that unhappy young fellow, Mackinnon,  who shot his sweetheart at Leicester; he made, straight as the crow  flies, for his home in the Isle of Skye, and there drowned himself  in familiar waters. Lindner, the Tyrolese, again, who stabbed the  American swindler at Monte Carlo, was tracked after a few days to  his native place, St. Valentin, in the Zillerthal. It is always  so. Mountaineers in distress fly to their mountains. It is a part  of their nostalgia. I know it from within, too: if <i>I</i> were in  poor Hugo LeGeyt's place, what do you think I would do? Why, hide  myself at once in the greenest recesses of our Carnarvonshire  mountains."    
"What an extraordinary insight into character you have!" I cried.  "You seem to divine what everybody's action will be under given  circumstances."    
She paused, and held her parasol half poised in her hand.  "Character determines action," she said, slowly, at last. "That is  the secret of the great novelists. They put themselves behind and  within their characters, and so make us feel that every act of  their personages is not only natural but even--given the conditions--  inevitable. We recognise that their story is the sole logical  outcome of the interaction of their dramatis personae. Now, <i>I</i> am  not a great novelist; I cannot create and imagine characters and  situations. But I have something of the novelist's gift; I apply  the same method to the real life of the people around me. I try to  throw myself into the person of others, and to feel how their  character will compel them to act in each set of circumstances to  which they may expose themselves."    
"In one word," I said, "you are a psychologist."    
"A psychologist," she assented; "I suppose so; and the police--  well, the police are not; they are at best but bungling materialists.  They require a <i>clue</i>. What need of a <i>clue</i> if you can interpret  character?"    
So certain was Hilda Wade of her conclusions, indeed, that Mrs.  Mallet begged me next day to take my holiday at once--which I could  easily do--and go down to the little bay in the Hartland district  of which she had spoken, in search of Hugo. I consented. She  herself proposed to set out quietly for Bideford, where she could  be within easy reach of me, in order to hear of my success or  failure; while Hilda Wade, whose summer vacation was to have begun  in two days' time, offered to ask for an extra day's leave so as to  accompany her. The broken-hearted sister accepted the offer; and,  secrecy being above all things necessary, we set off by different  routes: the two women by Waterloo, myself by Paddington.    
We stopped that night at different hotels in Bideford; but next  morning, Hilda rode out on her bicycle, and accompanied me on mine  for a mile or two along the tortuous way towards Hartland. "Take  nothing for granted," she said, as we parted; "and be prepared to  find poor Hugo Le Geyt's appearance greatly changed. He has eluded  the police and their 'clues' so far; therefore, I imagine he must  have largely altered his dress and exterior."    
"I will find him," I answered, "if he is anywhere within twenty  miles of Hartland."    
She waved her hand to me in farewell. I rode on after she left me  towards the high promontory in front, the wildest and least-visited  part of North Devon. Torrents of rain had fallen during the night;  the slimy cart-ruts and cattle-tracks on the moor were brimming  with water. It was a lowering day. The clouds drifted low. Black  peat-bogs filled the hollows; grey stone homesteads, lonely and  forbidding, stood out here and there against the curved sky-line.  Even the high road was uneven and in places flooded. For an hour I  passed hardly a soul. At last, near a crossroad with a defaced  finger-post, I descended from my machine, and consulted my ordnance  map, on which Mrs. Mallet had marked ominously, with a cross of red  rink, the exact position of the little fishing hamlet where Hugo  used to spend his holidays. I took the turning which seemed to me  most likely to lead to it; but the tracks were so confused, and the  run of the lanes so uncertain--let alone the map being some years  out of date--that I soon felt I had lost my bearings. By a little  wayside inn, half hidden in a deep combe, with bog on every side, I  descended and asked for a bottle of ginger-beer; for the day was  hot and close, in spite of the packed clouds. As they were opening  the bottle, I inquired casually the way to the Red Gap bathing-  place.    
The landlord gave me directions which confused me worse than ever,  ending at last with the concise remark: "An' then, zur, two or  dree more turns to the right an' to the left 'ull bring 'ee right  up alongzide o' ut."    
I despaired of finding the way by these unintelligible sailing-  orders; but just at that moment, as luck would have it, another  cyclist flew past--the first soul I had seen on the road that  morning. He was a man with the loose-knit air of a shop assistant,  badly got up in a rather loud and obtrusive tourist suit of brown  homespun, with baggy knickerbockers and thin thread stockings. I  judged him a gentleman on the cheap at sight. "Very Stylish; this  Suit Complete, only thirty-seven and sixpence!" The landlady  glanced out at him with a friendly nod. He turned and smiled at  her, but did not see me; for I stood in the shade behind the half-  open door. He had a short black moustache and a not unpleasing,  careless face. His features, I thought, were better than his  garments.    
However, the stranger did not interest me just then I was far too  full of more important matters. "Why don't 'ee taake an' vollow  thik ther gen'leman, zur?" the landlady said, pointing one large  red hand after him. "Ur do go down to Urd Gap to zwim every  marnin'. Mr. Jan Smith, o' Oxford, they do call un. 'Ee can't go  wrong if 'ee do vollow un to the Gap. Ur's lodgin' up to wold  Varmer Moore's, an' ur's that vond o' the zay, the vishermen do  tell me, as wasn't never any gen'leman like un."    
I tossed off my ginger-beer, jumped on to my machine, and followed  the retreating brown back of Mr. John Smith, of Oxford--surely a  most non-committing name--round sharp corners and over rutty lanes,  tire-deep in mud, across the rusty-red moor, till, all at once, at  a turn, a gap of stormy sea appeared wedge-shape between two  shelving rock-walls.    
It was a lonely spot. Rocks hemmed it in; big breakers walled it.  The sou'-wester roared through the gap. I rode down among loose  stones and water-worn channels in the solid grit very carefully.  But the man in brown had torn over the wild path with reckless  haste, zigzagging madly, and was now on the little three-cornered  patch of beach, undressing himself with a sort of careless glee,  and flinging his clothes down anyhow on the shingle beside him.  Something about the, action caught my eye. That movement of the  arm! It was not--it could not be--no, no, not Hugo!    
A very ordinary person; and Le Geyt bore the stamp of a born  gentleman.    
He stood up bare at last. He flung out his arms, as if to welcome  the boisterous wind to his naked bosom. Then, with a sudden burst  of recognition, the man stood revealed. We had bathed together a  hundred times in London and elsewhere. The face, the clad figure,  the dress, all were different. But the body--the actual frame and  make of the man--the well-knit limbs, the splendid trunk--no  disguise could alter. It was Le Geyt himself--big, powerful,  vigorous.    
That ill-made suit, those baggy knickerbockers, the slouched cap,  the thin thread stockings, had only distorted and hidden his  figure. Now that I saw him as he was, he came out the same bold  and manly form as ever.    
He did not notice me. He rushed down with a certain wild joy into  the turbulent water, and, plunging in with a loud cry, buffeted the  huge waves with those strong curving arms of his. The sou'-wester  was rising. Each breaker as it reared caught him on its crest and  tumbled him over like a cork, but like a cork he rose again. He  was swimming now, arm over arm, straight out seaward. I saw the  lifted hands between the crest and the trough. For a moment I  hesitated whether I ought to strip and follow him. Was he doing as  so many others of his house had done--courting death from the  water?    
But some strange hand restrained me. Who was I that I should stand  between Hugo Le Geyt and the ways of Providence?    
The Le Geyts loved ever the ordeal by water.    
Presently, he turned again. Before he turned, I had taken the  opportunity to look hastily at his clothes. Hilda Wade had  surmised aright once more. The outer suit was a cheap affair from  a big ready-made tailor's in St. Martin's Lane--turned out by the  thousand; the underclothing, on the other hand, was new and  unmarked, but fine in quality--bought, no doubt, at Bideford. An  eerie sense of doom stole over me. I felt the end was near. I  withdrew behind a big rock, and waited there unseen till Hugo had  landed. He began to dress again, without troubling to dry himself.  I drew a deep breath of relief. Then this was not suicide!    
By the time he had pulled on his vest and drawers, I came out  suddenly from my ambush and faced him. A fresh shock awaited me.  I could hardly believe my eyes. It was <i>not</i> Le Geyt--no, nor  anything like him!    
Nevertheless, the man rose with a little cry and advanced, half  crouching, towards me. "<i>You</i> are not hunting me down--with the  police?" he exclaimed, his neck held low and his forehead  wrinkling.    
The voice--the voice was Le Geyt's. It was an unspeakable mystery.  "Hugo," I cried, "dear Hugo--hunting you down?--<i>could</i> you imagine  it?"    
He raised his head, strode forward, and grasped my hand. "Forgive  me, Cumberledge," he cried. "But a proscribed and hounded man! If  you knew what a relief it is to me to get out on the water!"    
"You forget all there?"    
"I forget <i>it</i>--the red horror!"    
"You meant just now to drown yourself?"    
"No! If I had meant it I would have done it. . . . Hubert, for my  children's sake, I <i>will</i> not commit suicide!"    
"Then listen!" I cried. I told him in a few words of his sister's  scheme--Sebastian's defence--the plausibility of the explanation--  the whole long story. He gazed at me moodily. Yet it was not  Hugo!    
"No, no," he said, shortly; and as he spoke it was <i>he</i>. "I have  done it; I have killed her; I will not owe my life to a falsehood."    
"Not for the children's sake?"    
He dashed his hand down impatiently. "I have a better way for the  children. I will save them still. . . . Hubert, you are not  afraid to speak to a murderer?"    
"Dear Hugo--I know all; and to know all is to forgive all."    
He grasped my hand once more. "Know <i>all</i>!" he cried, with a  despairing gesture. "Oh, no; no one knows <i>all</i> but myself; not even  the children. But the children know much; <i>they</i> will forgive me.  Lina knows something; <i>she</i> will forgive me. You know a little; <i>you</i>  forgive me. The world can never know. It will brand my darlings  as a murderer's children."    
"It was the act of a minute," I interposed. "And--though she is  dead, poor lady, and one must speak no ill of her--we can at least  gather dimly, for your children's sake, how deep was the  provocation."    
He gazed at me fixedly. His voice was like lead. "For the  children's sake--yes," he answered, as in a dream. "It was all for  the children! I have killed her--murdered her--she has paid her  penalty; and, poor dead soul, I will utter no word against her--the  woman I have murdered! But one thing I will say: If omniscient  justice sends me for this to eternal punishment, I can endure it  gladly, like a man, knowing that so I have redeemed my Marian's  motherless girls from a deadly tyranny."    
It was the only sentence in which he ever alluded to her.    
I sat down by his side and watched him closely. Mechanically,  methodically, he went on with his dressing. The more he dressed,  the less could I believe it was Hugo. I had expected to find him  close-shaven; so did the police, by their printed notices. Instead  of that, he had shaved his beard and whiskers, but only trimmed his  moustache; trimmed it quite short, so as to reveal the boyish  corners of the mouth--a trick which entirely altered his rugged  expression. But that was not all; what puzzled me most was the  eyes--they were not Hugo's. At first I could not imagine why. By  degrees the truth dawned upon me. His eyebrows were naturally  thick and shaggy--great overhanging growth, interspersed with many  of those stiff long hairs to which Darwin called attention in  certain men as surviving traits from a monkey-like ancestor. In  order to disguise himself, Hugo had pulled out all these coarser  hairs, leaving nothing on his brows but the soft and closely  pressed coat of down which underlies the longer bristles in all  such cases. This had wholly altered the expression of the eyes,  which no longer looked out keenly from their cavernous penthouse;  but being deprived of their relief, had acquired a much more  ordinary and less individual aspect. From a good-natured but  shaggy giant, my old friend was transformed by his shaving and his  costume into a well-fed and well-grown, but not very colossal,  commercial gentleman. Hugo was scarcely six feet high, indeed,  though by his broad shoulders and bushy beard he had always  impressed one with such a sense of size; and now that the  hirsuteness had been got rid of, and the dress altered, he hardly  struck one as taller or bigger than the average of his fellows.    
We sat for some minutes and talked. Le Geyt would not speak of  Clara; and when I asked him his intentions, he shook his head  moodily. "I shall act for the best," he said--"what of best is  left--to guard the dear children. It was a terrible price to pay  for their redemption; but it was the only one possible, and, in a  moment of wrath, I paid it. Now, I have to pay, in turn, myself.  I do not shirk it."    
"You will come back to London, then, and stand your trial?" I  asked, eagerly.    
"Come back <i>to London</i>?" he cried, with a face of white panic.  Hitherto he had seemed to me rather relieved in expression than  otherwise; his countenance had lost its worn and anxious look; he  was no longer watching each moment over his children's safety.  "Come back . . . <i>to London</i> . . . and face my trial! Why, did you  think, Hubert, 'twas the court or the hanging I was shirking? No,  no; not that; but <i>it</i>--the red horror! I must get away from <i>it</i> to  the sea--to the water--to wash away the stain--as far from <i>it</i>--that  red pool--as possible!"    
I answered nothing. I left him to face his own remorse in silence.    
At last he rose to go, and held one foot undecided on his bicycle.    
"I leave myself in Heaven's hands," he said, as he lingered. "<i>It</i>  will requite. . . . The ordeal is by water."    
"So I judged," I answered.    
"Tell Lina this from me," he went on, still loitering: "that if she  will trust me, I will strive to do the best that remains for my  darlings. I will do it, Heaven helping. She will know <i>what</i>,  to-morrow."    
He mounted his machine and sailed off. My eyes followed him up the  path with sad forebodings.    
All day long I loitered about the Gap. It consisted of two bays--  the one I had already seen, and another, divided from it by a saw-  edge of rock. In the further cove crouched a few low stone  cottages. A broad-bottomed sailing boat lay there, pulled up high  on the beach. About three o'clock, as I sat and watched, two men  began to launch it. The sea ran high; tide coming in; the sou'-  wester still increasing in force to a gale; at the signal-staff on  the cliff, the danger-cone was hoisted. White spray danced in air.  Big black clouds rolled up seething from windward; low thunder  rumbling; a storm threatened.    
One of the men was Le Geyt, the other a fisherman.    
He jumped in, and put off through the surf with an air of triumph.  He was a splendid sailor. His boat leapt through the breakers and  flew before the wind with a mere rag of canvas. "Dangerous weather  to be out!" I exclaimed to the fisherman, who stood with hands  buried in his pockets, watching him.    
"Ay that ur be, zur!" the man answered. "Doan't like the look o'  ut. But thik there gen'leman, 'ee's one o' Oxford, 'ee do tell me;  and they'm a main venturesome lot, they college volk. 'Ee's off by  'isself droo the starm, all so var as Lundy!"    
"Will he reach it?" I asked, anxiously, having my own idea on the  subject.    
"Doan't seem like ut, zur, do ut? Ur must, an' ur mustn't, an' yit  again ur must. Powerful 'ard place ur be to maake in a starm, to  be zure, Lundy. Zaid the Lord 'ould dezide. But ur 'ouldn't be  warned, ur 'ouldn't; an' voolhardy volk, as the zayin' is, must go  their own voolhardy waay to perdition!"    
It was the last I saw of Le Geyt alive. Next morning the lifeless  body of "the man who was wanted for the Campden Hill mystery" was  cast up by the waves on the shore of Lundy. The Lord had decided.    
Hugo had not miscalculated. "Luck in their suicides," Hilda Wade  said; and, strange to say, the luck of the Le Geyts stood him in  good stead still. By a miracle of fate, his children were not  branded as a murderer's daughters. Sebastian gave evidence at the  inquest on the wife's body: "Self-inflicted--a recoil--accidental--  I am <i>sure</i> of it." His specialist knowledge--his assertive  certainty, combined with that arrogant, masterful manner of his,  and his keen, eagle eye, overbore the jury. Awed by the great  man's look, they brought in a submissive verdict of "Death by  misadventure." The coroner thought it a most proper finding. Mrs.  Mallet had made the most of the innate Le Geyt horror of blood.  The newspapers charitably surmised that the unhappy husband, crazed  by the instantaneous unexpectedness of his loss, had wandered away  like a madman to the scenes of his childhood, and had there been  drowned by accident while trying to cross a stormy sea to Lundy,  under some wild impression that he would find his dead wife alive  on the island. Nobody whispered <i>murder</i>. Everybody dwelt on the  utter absence of motive--a model husband!--such a charming young  wife, and such a devoted stepmother. We three alone knew--we  three, and the children.    
On the day when the jury brought in their verdict at the adjourned  inquest on Mrs. Le Geyt, Hilda Wade stood in the room, trembling  and white-faced, awaiting their decision. When the foreman uttered  the words, "Death by misadventure," she burst into tears of relief.  "He did well!" she cried to me, passionately. "He did well, that  poor father! He placed his life in the hands of his Maker, asking  only for mercy to his innocent children. And mercy has been shown  to him and to them. He was taken gently in the way he wished. It  would have broken my heart for those two poor girls if the verdict  had gone otherwise. He knew how terrible a lot it is to be called  a murderer's daughter."    
I did not realise at the time with what profound depth of personal  feeling she said it.
