It was Sunday evening, and on Sundays Max Schurz, the chief of the  London Socialists, always held his weekly receptions. That night  his cosmopolitan refugee friends were all at liberty; his French  disciples could pour in from the little lanes and courts in Soho,  where, since the Commune, they had plied their peaceful trades as  engravers, picture-framers, artists'-colourmen, models, pointers,  and so forth--for most of them were hangers-on in one way or another  of the artistic world; his German adherents could stroll round,  pipe in mouth, from their printing-houses, their ham-and-beef shops,  or their naturalists' chambers, where they stuffed birds or set up  exotic butterflies in little cabinets--for most of them were more  or less literary or scientific in their pursuits; and his few English  sympathisers, chiefly dissatisfied philosophical Radicals of the  upper classes, could drop in casually for a chat and a smoke, on  their way home from the churches to which they had been dutifully  escorting their un-emancipated wives and sisters. Max Schurz kept  open house for all on Sunday evenings, and there was not a drawing-room  in London better filled than his with the very advanced and not  undistinguished set who alone had the much-prized entree of his  exclusive salon.    
The salon itself did not form any component part of Max Schurz's  own private residence in any way. The great Socialist, the man whose  mandates shook the thrones of Russia and Austria, whose movements  spread terror in Paris and Berlin, whose dictates were even obeyed  in Kerry and in Chicago, occupied for his own use two small rooms  at the top of a shabby composite tenement in a doubtful district  of Marylebone. The little parlour where he carried on his trade of  a microscope-lens grinder would not have sufficed to hold one-tenth  of the eager half-washed crowd that pressed itself enthusiastically  upon him every Sunday. But a large room on the ground floor of the  tenement, opening towards the main street, was used during the  week by one of his French refugee friends as a dancing-saloon;  and in this room on every Sunday evening the uncrowned king of the  proletariate Socialists was permitted to hold his royal levees.  Thither all that was best and truest in the socially rebellions  classes domiciled in London used to make its way; and there men  calmly talked over the ultimate chances of social revolutions which  would have made the hair of respectable Philistine Marylebone stand  stiffly on end, had it only known the rank political heresies that  were quietly hatching in its unconscious midst.    
While Max Schurz's hall was rapidly filling with the polyglot crowd  of democratic solidarists, Ernest Le Breton and his brother were  waiting in the chilly little drawing-room at Epsilon Terrrace,  Bayswater, for the expected arrival of Harry Oswald. Ernest had  promised to introduce Oswald to Max Schurz's reception; and it  was now past eight o'clock, getting rather a late hour for those  simple-minded, early-rising Communists. 'I'm afraid, Herbert,'  said Ernest to his brother, 'he forgets that Max is a working-man  who has to be at his trade again punctually by seven o'clock  to-morrow. He thinks he's going out to a regular society At Home,  where ten o'clock's considered just the beginning of the evening. Max  won't at all like his turning up so late; it smells of non-productivity.'    
'If Herr Schurz wants to convert the world,' Herbert answered  chillily, rolling himself a tiny cigarette, 'he must convince the  unproductive as well as the proletariate before he can set things  fairly on the roll for better arrangement. The proletariate's  all very well in its way, no doubt, but the unproductive happen to  hold the key of the situation. One convert like you or me is worth  a thousand ignorant East-end labourers, with nothing but their  hands and their votes to count upon.'    
'But you are not a convert, Herbert.'    
'I didn't say I was. I'm a critic. There's no necessity to throw  oneself open-armed into the embrace of either party. The wise man  can wait and watch the progress of the game, backing the winner  for the time being at all the critical moments, and hedging if  necessary when the chances turn momentarily against the favourite.  There's a ring at the bell: that's Oswald; let's go down to the  door to meet him.'    
Ernest ran down the stairs rapidly, as was his wont; Herbert  followed in a more leisurely fashion, still rolling the cigarette  between his delicate finger and thumb. 'Goodness gracious, Oswald!'  Ernest exclaimed as his friend stepped in, 'why, you've actually  come in evening dress! A white tie and all! What on earth will  Max say? He'll be perfectly scandalised at such a shocking and  unprecedented outrage. This will never do; you must dissemble  somehow or other.'    
Oswald laughed. 'I had no idea,' he said, 'Herr Schurz was such  a truculent sans-culotte as that comes to. As it was an evening  reception I thought, of course, one ought to turn up in evening  clothes.'    
'Evening clothes! My dear fellow, how on earth do you suppose a  set of poor Leicester Square outlaws are going to get themselves  correctly set up in black broadcloth coats and trousers? They might  wash their white ties themselves, to be sure; they mostly do their  own washing, I believe, in their own basins.' ('And not much at  that either,' put in Herbert, parenthetically.) 'But as to evening  clothes, why, they'd as soon think of arraying themselves for dinner  in full court dress as of putting on an obscurantist swallow-tail.  It's the badge of a class, a distinct aristocratic outrage; we must  alter it at once, I assure you, Oswald.'    
'At any rate,' said Oswald laughing, 'I've had the pleasure of finding  myself accused for the first time in the course of my existence of  being aristocratic. It's quite worth while going to Max Schurz's  once in one's life, if it were only for the sake of that single  new sensation.'    
'Well, my dear fellow, we must rectify you, anyhow, before you go.  Let me see; luckily you've got your dust-coat on, and you needn't  take that off; it'll do splendidly to hide your coat and waistcoat.  I'll lend you a blue tie, which will at once transform your upper  man entirely. But you show the cloven hoof below; the trousers  will surely betray you. They're absolutely inadmissible under any  circumstances whatsoever, as the Court Circular says, and you must  positively wear a coloured pair of Herbert's instead of them. Run  upstairs quickly, there's a good fellow, and get rid of the mark  of the Beast as fast as you can.'    
Oswald did as he was told without demur, and in about a minute more  presented himself again, with the mark of the Beast certainly most  effectually obliterated, at least so far as outer appearance went.  His blue tie, light dust-coat, and borrowed grey trousers, made up  an ensemble much more like an omnibus conductor out for a holiday  than a gentleman of the period in correct evening dress. 'Now  mind,' Ernest said seriously, as he opened the door, 'whatever you  do, Oswald, if you stew to death for it--and Schurz's rooms are  often very close and hot, I can assure you--don't for heaven's sake  go and unbutton your dust-coat. If you do they'll see at once you're  a wolf in sheep's clothing, and I shouldn't be at all surprised  if they were to turn and rend you. At least, I'm sure Max would be  very much annoyed with me for unsocially introducing a plutocratic  traitor into the bosom of the fold.'    
They walked along briskly in the direction of Marylebone, and  stopped at last at a dull, yellow-washed house, which bore on  its door a very dingy brass plate, inscribed in red letters, 'M.  et Mdlle. Tirard. Salon de Danse.' Ernest opened the door without  ringing, and turned down the passage towards the salon. 'Remember,'  he said, turning to Harry Oswald by way of a last warning, with his  hand on the inner door-handle, 'coute que coute, my dear fellow,  don't on any account open your dust-coat. No anti-social opinions;  and please bear in mind that Max is, in his own way, a potentate.'    
The big hall, badly lighted by a few contribution candles (for the  whole colony subscribed to the best of its ability for the support  of the weekly entertainment), was all alive with eager figures and  the mingled busy hum of earnest conversation. A few chairs ranged  round the wall were mostly occupied by Mdlle. Tirard and the other  ladies of the Socialist party; but the mass of the guests were  men, and they were almost all smoking, in utter indifference to the  scanty presence of the fair sex. Not that they were intentionally  rude or boorish; that they never were; except where an emperor or an  aristocrat is concerned, there is no being on earth more courteous,  kindly, and considerate for the feelings of others than your  exiled Socialist. He has suffered much himself in his own time, and  so miseris succurrere discit. Emperors he mentally classes with  cobras, tarantulas, and scorpions, as outside the pale of humanitarian  sympathies altogether; but, with this slight political exception,  he is the broadest and tenderest and most catholic in his feelings  of all living breathing creatures. However, the ladies of his party  have all been brought up from their childhood onward in a mingled  atmosphere of smoke and democracy; so that he no more thinks  of abstaining from tobacco in their presence than he thinks of  commiserating the poor fish for being so dreadfully wet, or the  unfortunate mole for his unpleasantly slimy diet of live earthworms.    
'Herr Schurz,' said Ernest, singling out the great leader in the  gloom immediately, 'I've brought my brother Herbert here, whom  you know already, to see you, as well as another Oxford friend of  mind, Mr. Harry Oswald, Fellow and Lecturer of Oriel. He's almost  one of us at heart, I'm happy to say, and at any rate I'm sure  you'll be glad to make his acquaintance.'    
The little spare wizened-up grey man, in the threadbare brown velveteen  jacket, who stood in the middle of the hall, caught Ernest's hand  warmly, and held it for a moment fettered in his iron grip. There  was an honesty in that grip and in those hazy blue-spectacled eyes  that nobody could for a second misunderstand. If an emperor had  been introduced to Max Schurz he might have felt a little abashed  one minute at the old Socialist's royal disdain, but he could not  have failed to say to himself as he looked at him from head to  foot, 'Here, at least, is a true man.' So Harry Oswald felt, as  the spare grey thinker took his hand in his, and grasped it firmly  with a kindly pressure, but less friendly than that with which he  had greeted his known admirer, Ernest Le Breton. As for Herbert, he  merely bowed to him politely from a little distance; and Herbert,  who had picked up at once with a Polish exile in a corner, returned  the bow frigidly without coming up to the host himself at all for  a moment's welcome.    
'I'm always pleased to meet friends of the cause from Oxford,'  Herr Schurz said, in almost perfect English. 'We want recruits most  of all among the thinking classes. If we are ever to make headway  against the banded monopolies--against the place-holders, the  land-grabbers, the labour-taxers, the robbers of the poor--we must  first secure the perfect undivided confidence of the brain-workers,  the thinkers, and the writers. At present everything is against us;  we are but a little leaven, trying vainly in our helpless fashion  to leaven the whole lump. The capitalist journals carry off all  the writing talent in the world; they are timid, as capital must  always be; they tremble for their tens of thousands a year, and  their vast circulations among the propertied classes. We cannot  get at the heart of the people, save by the Archimedean lever of  the thinking world. For that reason, my dear Le Breton, I am always  glad to muster here your Oxford neophytes.'    
'And yet, Herr Schurz,' said Ernest gently, 'you know we must not  after all despair. Look at the history of your own people! When  the cause of Jehovah seemed most hopeless, there were still seven  thousand left in Israel who had not bowed the knee to Baal. We are  gaining strength every day, while they are losing it.'    
'Ah yes, my friend. I know that too,' the old man answered, with a  solemn shake of the head; 'but the wheels move slowly, they move  slowly--very surely, but oh, so slowly. You are young, friend  Ernest, and I am growing old. You look forward to the future with  hope; I look back to the past with regret: so many years gone, so  little, so very little done. It will come, it will come as surely  as the next glacial period, but I shall not live to see it. I stand  like Moses on Pisgah; I see the promised land before me; I look  down upon the equally allotted vineyards, and the glebe flowing  with milk and honey in the distance; but I shall not lead you into  it; I shall not even lead you against the Canaanites; another than  I must lead you in. But I am an old man, Mr. Oswald, an old man  now, and I am talking all about myself--an anti-social trick we have  inherited from our fathers. What is your friend's special line at  Oxford, did you say, Ernest?'    
'Oswald is a mathematician, sir,' said Ernest, 'perhaps the greatest  mathematician among the younger men in the whole University.'    
'Ah! that is well. We want exact science. We want clear and definite  thinking. Biologists and physicists and mathematicians, those are  our best recruits, you may depend upon it. We need logic, not mere  gas. Our French friends and our Irish friends--I have nothing in  the world to say against them; they are useful men, ardent men,  full of fire, full of enthusiasm, ready to do and dare anything--but  they lack ballast. You can't take the kingdom of heaven by storm.  The social revolution is not to be accomplished by violence, it is  not even to be carried by the most vivid eloquence; the victory  will be in the end to the clearest brain and the subtlest intellect.  The orthodox political economists are clever sophists; they mask  and confuse the truth very speciously; we must have keen eyes and  sharp noses to spy out and scent out their tortuous fallacies. I'm  glad you're a mathematician, Mr. Oswald. And so you have thought  on social problems?'    
'I have read "Gold and the Proletariate,"' Oswald answered modestly,  'and I learned much from it, and thought more. I won't say you have  quite converted me, Herr Schurz, but you have given me plenty of  food for future reflection.'    
'That is well, said the old man, passing one skinny brown hand  gently up and down over the other. 'That is well. There's no hurry.  Don't make up your mind too fast. Don't jump at conclusions. It's  intellectual dishonesty to do that. Wait till you have convinced  yourself. Spell out your problems slowly; they are not easy ones;  try to see how the present complex system works; try to probe  its inequalities and injustices; try to compare it with the ideal  commonwealth: and you'll find the light in the end, you'll find  the light.'    
As he spoke, Herbert Le Breton lounged up quietly from his farther  corner towards the little group. 'Ah, your brother, Ernest!' said  Max Schurz, drawing himself up a little more stiffly; 'he has found  the light already, I believe, but he neglects it; still he is not  with us, and he that is not with us is against us. You hold aloof  always, Mr. Herbert, is it not so?'    
'Well, not quite aloof, Herr Schurz, I'm certain, but not on  your side exactly either. I like to look on and hold the balance  evenly, not to throw my own weight too lightly into either stale.  The objective attitude of the mere spectator is after all the right  one for an impartial philosopher to take up.'    
'Ah, Mr. Herbert, this philosophy of your Oxford contemplative  Radicals is only another name for a kind of social selfishness,  I fancy,' said the old man solemnly. 'It seems to me your head is  with us, but your heart, your heart is elsewhere.'    
Herbert Le Breton played a moment quietly with the Roman aureus of  Domitian on his watch-chain; then he said slowly in his clear cold  voice, 'There may be something in that, no doubt, Herr Schurz, for  each of us has his own game to play, and while the world remains  unreformed, he must play it on his own gambit to a great extent,  without reference to the independent game of others. We all agree  that the board is too full of counters, and as each counter is not  responsible for its own presence and position on the board, having  been put there without previous consultation by the players, we  must each do the best we can for ourselves in our own fashion. My  sympathies, as you say, are on your side, but perhaps my interests  lie the other way, and after all, till you start your millennium,  we must all rattle along as well as we can in the box together,  jarring against one another in our old ugly round of competition,  and supply and demand, and survival of the fittest, and mutual  accommodation, and all the rest of it, to the end of the chapter.  Every man for himself and God for us all, you know. You have the  logic, to be sure, Herr Schurz, but the monopolists have the law  and the money.'    
'Ah, yes,' said the old Socialist grimly; 'Demas, Demas; he and his  silver mine; you remember your Bunyan, don't you? Well, all faiths  and systems have their Demases. The cares of this world and the  deceitfulness of riches. He's bursar of his college, isn't he, Ernest?  I thought so. "He had the bag, and bare what was put therein." A  dangerous office, isn't it, Mr. Oswald? A very dangerous office.  You can't touch pitch or property without being defiled.'    
'You at least, sir, said Ernest, reverentially, 'have kept yourself  unspotted from the world.'    
The old man sighed, and turned for a moment to speak in French to  a tall, big-bearded new-comer who advanced to meet him. 'Impossible!'  he said quickly; 'I am truly distressed to hear it. It is very  imprudent, very unnecessary.'    
'What is the news?' asked Ernest, also in French.    
The new-comer answered him with a marked South Russian accent.  'There has been another attempt on the life of Alexander Nicolaiovitch.'    
'You don't mean to say so!' cried Ernest in surprise.    
'Yes, I do,' replied the Russian, 'and it has nearly succeeded  too.'    
'An attempt on whom?' asked Oswald, who was new to the peculiar  vocabulary of the Socialists, and not particularly accustomed to  following spoken French.    
'On Alexander Nicolaiovitch,' answered the red-bearded stranger.    
'Not the Czar?' Oswald inquired of Ernest.    
'Yes, the one whom you call Czar,' said the stranger, quickly, in  tolerable English. The confusion of tongues seemed to be treated as  a small matter at Max Schurz's receptions, for everybody appeared  to speak all languages at once, in the true spirit of solidarity,  as though Babel had never been.    
Oswald did not attempt to conceal a slight gesture of horror. The  tall Russian looked down upon him commiseratingly. 'He is of the  Few?' he asked of Ernest, that being the slang of the initiated  for a member of the aristocratic and capitalist oligarchy.    
'Not exactly,' Ernest answered with a smile; 'but he has not entirely  learned the way we here regard these penal measures. His sympathies  are one-sided as to Alexander, no doubt. He thinks merely of the  hunted, wretched life the man bears about with him, and he forgets  poor bleeding, groaning, down-trodden, long-suffering Russia. It  is the common way of Englishmen. They do not realise Siberia and  Poland and the Third Section, and all the rest of it; they think  only of Alexander as of the benevolent despot who freed the serf  and befriended the Bulgarian. They never remember that they have  all the freedom and privileges themselves which you poor Russians  ask for in vain; they do not bear in mind that he has only to sign  his name to a constitution, a very little constitution, and he  might walk abroad as light-hearted in St. Petersburg to-morrow as  you and I walk in Regent Street to-day. We are mostly lopsided,  we English, but you must bear with us in our obliquity; we have  had freedom ourselves so long that we hardly know how to make due  allowance for those unfortunate folks who are still in search of  it.'    
'If you had an Alexander yourselves for half a day,' the Russian  said fiercely, turning to Oswald, 'you would soon see the difference.  You would forget your virtuous indignation against Nihilist assassins  in the white heat of your anger against unendurable tyranny. You  had a King Charles in England once--the mere shadow of a Russian  Czar--and you were not so very ceremonious with him, you order-loving  English, after all.'    
'It is a foolish thing, Borodinsky,' said Max Schurz, looking up  from the long telegram the other had handed him, 'and I told Toroloff  as much a fortnight ago, when he spoke to me about the matter. You  can do no good by these constant attacks, and you only rouse the  minds of the oligarchy against you by your importunity. Bloodshed  will avail us nothing; the world cannot be regenerated by a baptism  like that. Every peasant won over, every student enrolled, every  mother engaged to feed her little ones on the gospel of Socialism  together with her own milk, is worth a thousand times more to  us and to the people than a dead Czar. If your friends had really  blown him up, what then? You would have had another Czar, and  another Third Section, and another reign of terror, and another  raid and massacre; and we should have lost twenty good men from our  poor little side for ever. We must not waste the salt of the earth  in that reckless fashion. Besides, I don't like this dynamite. It's  a bad argument, it smacks too much of the old royal and repressive  method. You know the motto Louis Quatorze used to cast on his  bronze cannon--"Ultima ratio regum." Well, we Socialists ought to  be able to find better logic for our opponents than that, oughtn't  we?'    
'But in Russia,' cried the bearded man hotly, 'in poor stricken-down  groaning Russia, what other argument have they left us? Are we to  be hunted to death without real law or trial, tortured into sham  confessions, deluded with mock pardons, arraigned before hypocritical  tribunals, ensnared by all the chicanery, and lying, and treachery,  and ferreting of the false bureaucracy, with its spies, and its  bloodhounds, and its knout-bearing police-agents; and then are we  not to make war the only way we can--open war, mind you, with fair  declaration, and due formalities, and proper warning beforehand--against  the irresponsible autocrat and his wire-pulled office-puppets who  kill us off mercilessly? You are too hard upon us, Herr Schurz;  even you yourself have no sympathy at all for unhappy Russia.'    
The old man looked up at him tenderly and regretfully. 'My poor  Borodinsky,' he said in a gentle tremulous voice, 'I have indeed  sympathy and pity in abundance for you. I do not blame you; you  will have enough and to spare to do that, even here in free England;  I would not say a harsh word against you or your terrible methods  for all the world. You have been hard-driven, and you stand at  bay like tigers. But I think you are going to work the wrong way,  not using your energies to the best possible advantage for the  proletariate. What we have really got to do is to gain over every  man, woman, and child of the working-classes individually, and to  array on our side all the learning and intellect and economical  science of the thinking classes individually; and then we can present  such a grand united front to the banded monopolists that for very  shame they will not dare to gainsay us. Indeed, if it comes to  that, we can leave them quietly alone, till for pure hunger they  will come and beg our assistance. When we have enticed away all  the workmen from their masters to our co-operative factories, the  masters may keep their rusty empty mills and looms and engines to  themselves as long as they like, but they must come to us in the  end, and ask us to give them the bread they used to refuse us. For  my part, I would kill no man and rob no man; but I would let no  man kill or rob another either.'    
'And how about Alexander Nicolaiovitch, then?' persisted the  Russian, eagerly. 'Has he killed none in his loathsome prisons and  in his Siberian quicksilver mines? Has he robbed none of their own  hardly got earnings by his poisoned vodki and his autocratically  imposed taxes and imposts? Who gave him an absolute hereditary right  to put us to death, to throw us in prison, to take our money from  us against our will and without our leave, to treat us as if we  existed, body and soul, and wives and children, only as chattels  for the greater glory of his own orthodox imperial majesty? If we  may justly slay the highway robber who meets us, arms in hand, in  the outskirts of the city, and demands of us our money or our life,  may we not justly slay Alexander Nicolaiovitch, who comes to our  homes in the person of his tax-gatherers to take the bread out of  our children's mouths and to help himself to whatever he chooses by  the divine right of his Romanoff heirship? I tell you, Herr Max,  we may blamelessly lie in wait for him wherever we find him, and  whoso says us nay is siding with the wolf against the lambs, with  the robber and the slayer against the honest representative of  right and justice.'    
'I never met a Nihilist before,' said Oswald to Ernest, in a  half-undertone,' and it never struck me to think what they might  have to say for themselves from their own side of the question.'    
'That's one of the uses of coming here to Herr Schurz's,' Ernest  answered quickly. 'You may not agree with all you hear, but at  least you learn to see others as they see themselves; whereas if  you mix always in English society, and read only English papers,  you will see them only as we English see them.'    
'But just fancy,' Oswald went on, as they both stood back a little  to make way for others who wished for interviews with the great  man, 'just fancy that this Borodinsky, or whatever his name may be,  has himself very likely helped in dynamite plots, or manufactured  nitro-glycerine cartridges to blow up the Czar; and yet we stand  here talking with him as coolly as if he were an ordinary respectable  innocent Englishman.'    
'What of that?' Ernest answered, smiling. 'Didn't we meet Prince  Strelinoffsky at Oriel last term, and didn't we talk with him too,  as if he was an honest, hard-working, bread-earning Christian? and  yet we knew he was a member of the St. Petersburg office clique,  and at the bottom of half the trouble in Poland for the last ten  years or so. Grant even that Borodinsky is quite wrong in his way  of dealing with noxious autocrats, and yet which do you think is  the worst criminal of the two--he with his little honest glazier's  shop in a back slum of Paddington, or Strelinoffsky with his jewelled  fingers calmly signing accursed warrants to send childing Polish  women to die of cold and hunger and ill-treatment on the way to  Siberia?'    
'Well, really, Le Breton, you know I'm a passably good Radical,  but you're positively just one stage too Radical even for me.'    
'Come here oftener,' answered Ernest; 'and perhaps you'll begin to  think a little differently about some things.'    
An hour later in the evening Max Schurz found Ernest alone in a  quiet corner. 'One moment, my dear Le Breton,' he said; 'you know  I always like to find out all about people's political antecedents;  it helps one to fathom the potentialities of their characters. From  what social stratum, now, do we get your clever friend, Mr. Oswald?'    
'His father's a petty tradesman in a country town in Devonshire,  I believe,' Ernest answered; 'and he himself is a good general  democrat, without any very pronounced socialistic colouring.'    
'A petty tradesman! Hum, I thought so. He has rather the mental  bearing and equipment of a man from the petite bourgeoisie. I have  been talking to him, and drawing him out. Clever, very, and with  good instincts, but not wholly and entirely sound. A fibre wrong  somewhere, socially speaking, a false note suspected in his ideas  of life; too much acquiescence in the thing that is, and too little  faith or enthusiasm for the thing that ought to be. But we shall  make something of him yet. He has read "Gold" and understands it.  That is already a beginning. Bring him again. I shall always be  glad to see him here.'    
'I will,' said Ernest, 'and I believe the more you know him, Herr  Max, the better you will like him.'    
'And what did you think of the sons of the prophets?' asked Herbert  Le Breton of Oswald as they left the salon at the close of the  reception.    
'Frankly speaking,' answered Oswald, looking half aside at Ernest,  'I didn't quite care for all of them--the Nihilists and Communards  took my breath away at first; but as to Max Schurz himself I think  there can be only one opinion possible about him.'    
'And that is----?'    
'That he's a magnificent old man, with a genuine apostolic  inspiration. I don't care twopence whether he is right or wrong,  but he's a perfectly splendid old fellow, as honest and transparent  as the day's long. He believes in it all, and would give his life  for it freely, if he thought he could forward the cause a single  inch by doing it.'    
'You're quite right,' said Herbert calmly. 'He's an Elijah thrown  blankly upon these prosaic latter days; and what's more, his  gospel's all true; but it doesn't matter a sou to you or me, for  it will never come about in our time, no nor for a century after.  "Post nos millennium." So what on earth's the good of our troubling  our poor overworked heads about it?'    
'He's the only really great man I ever knew,' said Ernest  enthusiastically, 'and I consider that his friendship's the one  thing in my life that has been really and truly worth living for.  If a pessimist were to ask me what was the use of human existence,  I should give him a card of introduction to go to Max Schurz's.'    
'Excuse my interrupting your rhapsody, Ernest,' Herbert put in  blandly, 'but will you have your own trousers tonight, Oswald, or  will you wear mine back to your lodgings now, and I'll send one of  the servants round with yours for them in the morning?'    
'Thanks,' said Harry Oswald, slapping the sides of the unopened  dust-coat; 'I think I'll go home as I am at present, and I'll recover  the marks of the Beast again to-morrow. You see, I didn't betray  my evening waistcoat after all, now did I?'    
And they parted at the corner, each of them going his own way in  his own mood and manner.
