  The morning passed like a dream to Carrigan. He permitted himself   to live and breathe it as one who finds himself for a space in the   heart of a golden mirage. He was sitting so near Marie-Anne that  now  and then the faint perfume of her came to him like the  delicate scent  of a flower. It was a breath of crushed violets,  sweet as the air he  was breathing, violets gathered in the deep  cool of the forest, a  whisper of sweetness about her, as if on her  bosom she wore always the  living flowers. He fancied her gathering  them last bloom-time, a year  ago, alone, her feet seeking out the  damp mosses, her little fingers  plucking the smiling and laughing  faces of the violet flowers to be  treasured away in fragrant  sachets, as gentle as the wood-thrush's  note, compared with the  bottled aromas fifteen hundred miles south. It  seemed to be a  physical part of her, a thing born of the glow in her  cheeks, a  living exhalation of her soft red lips&#8212;and yet only when he  was  near, very near, did the life of it reach him. 
  She did not know he was thinking these things. There was nothing   in his voice, he thought, to betray him. He was sure she was   unconscious of the fight he was making. Her eyes smiled and  laughed  with him, she counted her stitches, her fingers worked,  and she talked  to him as she might have talked to a friend of St.  Pierre's. She told  him how St. Pierre had made the barge, the  largest that had ever been  on the river, and that he had built it  entirely of dry cedar, so that  it floated like a feather wherever  there was water enough to run a  York boat. She told him how St.  Pierre had brought the piano down from  Edmonton, and how he had  saved it from pitching in the river by  carrying the full weight of  it on his shoulders when they met with an  accident in running  through a dangerous rapids bringing it down. St.  Pierre was a very  strong man, she said, a note of pride in her voice.  And then she  added, 
  &quot;Sometimes, when he picks me up in his arms, I feel that he is   going to squeeze the life out of me!&quot; 
  Her words were like a sharp thrust into his heart. For an instant   they painted a vision for him, a picture of that slim and adorable   creature crushed close in the great arms of St. Pierre, so close  that  she could not breathe. In that mad moment of his hurt it was  almost a  living, breathing reality for him there on the golden  fore-deck of the  scow. He turned his face toward the far shore,  where the wilderness  seemed to reach off into eternity. What a  glory it was&#8212;the green seas  of spruce and cedar and balsam, the  ridges of poplar and birch rising  like silvery spume above the  darker billows, and afar off, mellowed in  the sun-mists, the  guardian crests of Trout Mountains sentineling the  country beyond!  Into that mystery-land on the farther side of the  Wabiskaw  waterways Carrigan would have loved to set his foot four days  ago.  It was that mystery of the unpeopled places that he most desired,   their silence, the comradeship of spaces untrod by the feet of  man.  And now, what a fool he was! Through vast distances the  forests he  loved seemed to whisper it to him, and ahead of him the  river seemed  to look back, nodding over its shoulder, beckoning to  him, telling him  the word of the forests was true. It streamed on  lazily, half a mile  wide, as if resting for the splashing and  roaring rush it would make  among the rocks of the next rapids, and  in its indolence it sang the  low and everlasting song of deep and  slowly passing water. In that  song David heard the same whisper,  that he was a fool! And the lure of  the wilderness shores crept in  on him and gripped him as of old. He  looked at the rowers in the  two York boats, and then his eyes came  back to the end of the  barge and to St. Pierre's wife. 
  Her little toes were tapping the floor of the deck. She, too, was   looking out over the wilderness. And again it seemed to him that  she  was like a bird that wanted to fly. 
  &quot;I should like to go into those hills,&quot; she said, without looking   at him. &quot;Away off yonder!&quot; 
  &quot;And I&#8212;I should like to go with you.&quot; 
  &quot;You love all that, m'sieu?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;Yes, madame!&quot; 
  &quot;Why 'madame,' when I have given you permission to call me 'Marie-   Anne'?&quot; she demanded. 
  &quot;Because you call me 'm'sieu'.&quot; 
  &quot;But you&#8212;you have not given me permission&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Then I do now,&quot; he interrupted quickly. 
  &quot;Merci! I have wondered why you did not return the courtesy,&quot; she   laughed softly. &quot;I do not like the m'sieu. I shall call you  'David'!&quot; 
  She rose out of the hammock suddenly and dropped her needles and   lace work into the little basket. &quot;I have forgotten something. It  is  for you to eat when it comes dinner-time, m'sieu&#8212;I mean David.  So I  must turn fille de cuisine for a little while. That is what  St. Pierre  sometimes calls me, because I love to play at cooking.  I am going to  bake a pie!&quot; 
  The dark-screened door of the kitchenette closed behind her, and   Carrigan walked out from under the awning, so that the sun beat  down  upon him. There was no longer a doubt in his mind. He was  more than  fool. He envied St. Pierre, and he coveted that which  St. Pierre  possessed. And yet, before he would take what did not  belong to him,  he knew he would put a pistol to his head and blow  his life out. He  was confident of himself there. Yet he had  fallen, and out of the mire  into which he had sunk he knew also  that he must drag himself, and  quickly, or be everlastingly  lowered in his own esteem. He stripped  himself naked and did not  lie to that other and greater thing of life  that was in him. 
  He was not only a fool, but a coward. Only a coward would have   touched the hair of St. Pierre's wife with his lips; only a coward   would have let live the thoughts that burned in his brain. She was   St. Pierre's wife&#8212;and he was anxious now for the quick homecoming  of  the chief of the Boulains. After that everything would happen  quickly.  He thanked God that the inspiration of the wager had come  to him.  After the fight, after he had won, then once more would he  be the old  Dave Carrigan, holding the trump hand in a thrilling  game. 
  Loud voices from the York boats ahead and answering cries from   Bateese in the stern drew him to the open deck. The bateau was  close  to shore, and the half-breed was working the long stern  sweep as if  the power of a steam-engine was in his mighty arms.  The York boats had  shortened their towline and were pulling at  right angles within a few  yards of a gravelly beach. A few strokes  more, and men who were bare  to the knees jumped out into shallow  water and began tugging at the  tow rope with their hands. David  looked at his watch. It was ten  o'clock. Never in his life had  time passed so swiftly as that morning  on the forward deck of the  barge. And now they were tying up, after a  drop of six or eight  miles down the river, and he wondered how swiftly  St. Pierre was  overtaking them with his raft. 
  He was filled with the desire to feel the soft crush of the earth   under his feet again, and not waiting for the long plank that  Bateese  was already swinging from the scow to the shore, he made a  leap that  put him on the sandy beach, St. Pierre's wife had given  him this  permission, and he looked to see what effect his act had  on the  half-breed. The face of Concombre Bateese was like sullen  stone. Not a  sound came from his thick lips, but in his eyes was a  deep and  dangerous fire as he looked at Carrigan. There was no  need for words.  In them were suspicion, warning, the deadly threat  of what would  happen if he did not come back when it was time to  return. David  nodded. He understood. Even though St. Pierre's wife  had faith in him,  Bateese had not. He passed between the men, and  to a man their faces  turned on him, and in their quiet and  watchful eyes he saw again that  warning and suspicion, the  unspoken threat of what would happen if he  forgot his promise to  Marie-Anne Boulain. Never, in a single outfit,  had he seen such  splendid men. They were not a mongrel assortment of  the lower  country. Slim, tall, clean-cut, sinewy&#8212;they were stock of  the old  voyageurs of a hundred years ago, and all of them were young.  The  older men had gone to St. Pierre. The reason for this dawned upon   Carrigan. Not one of these twelve but could beat him in a race   through the forest; not one that could not outrun him and cut him  off  though he had hours the start! 
  Passing beyond them, he paused and looked back at the bateau. On   the forward deck stood Marie-Anne, and she, too, was looking at  him  now. Even at that distance he saw that her face was quiet and  troubled  with anxiety. She did not smile when he lifted his hat to  her, but  gave only a little nod. Then he turned and buried himself  in the green  balsams that grew within fifty paces of the river.  The old joy of life  leaped into him as his feet crushed in the  soft moss of the shaded  places where the sun did not break  through. He went on, passing  through a vast and silent cathedral  of spruce and cedar so dense that  the sky was hidden, and came  then to higher ground, where the  evergreen was sprinkled with  birch and poplar. About him was an  invisible choir of voices, the  low twittering of timid little  gray-backs, the song of hidden&#8212;  warblers, the scolding of distant  jays. Big-eyed moose-birds  stared at him as he passed, fluttering so  close to his face that  they almost touched his shoulders in their  foolish  inquisitiveness. A porcupine crashed within a dozen feet of  his  trail. And then he came to a beaten path, and other paths worn   deep in the cool, damp earth by the hoofs of moose and caribou.  Half  a mile from the bateau he sat down on a rotting log and  filled his  pipe with fresh tobacco, while he listened to catch the  subdued voice  of the life in this land that he loved. 
  It was then that the curious feeling came over him that he was not   alone, that other eyes than those of beast and bird were watching   him. It was an impression that grew on him. He seemed to feel  their  stare, seeking him out from the darkest coverts, waiting for  him to  shove on, dogging him like a ghost. Within him the hound-  like  instincts of the man-hunter rose swiftly to the suspicion of  invisible  presence. 
  He began to note the changes in the cries of certain birds. A   hundred yards on his right a jay, most talkative of all the forest   things, was screeching with a new note in its voice. On the other   side of him, in a dense pocket of poplar and spruce, a warbler   suddenly brought its song to a jerky end. He heard the excited Pe-   wee&#8212;Pe-wee&#8212;Pe-wee of a startled little gray-back giving warning  of  an unwelcome intruder near its nest. And he rose to his feet,  laughing  softly as he thumbed down the tobacco in his pipe. Jeanne  Marie-Anne  Boulain might believe in him, but Bateese and her wary  henchmen had  ways of their own of strengthening their faith. 
  It was close to noon when he turned back, and he did not return by   the moose path. Deliberately he struck out a hundred yards on  either  side of it, traveling where the moss grew thick and the  earth was damp  and soft. And five times he found the moccasin-  prints of men. 
  Bateese, with his sleeves up, was scrubbing the deck of the bateau   when David came over the plank. 
  &quot;There are moose and caribou in there, but I fear I disturbed your   hunters,&quot; said Carrigan, grinning at the half-breed. &quot;They are too   clumsy to hunt well, so clumsy that even the birds give them away.  I  am afraid we shall go without fresh meat tomorrow!&quot; 
  Concombre Bateese stared as if some one had stunned him with a   blow, and he spoke no word as David went on to the forward deck.   Marie-Anne had come out under the awning. She gave a little cry of   relief and pleasure. 
  &quot;I am glad you have come back, M'sieu David!&quot; 
  &quot;So am I, madame,&quot; he replied. &quot;I think the woods are unhealthful   to travel in!&quot; 
  Out of the earth he felt that a part of the old strength had   returned to him. Alone they sat at dinner, and Marie-Anne waited  on  him and called him David again&#8212;and he found it easier now to  call her  Marie-Anne and look into her eyes without fear that he  was betraying  himself. A part of the afternoon he spent in her  company, and it was  not difficult for him to tell her something of  his adventuring in the  north, and how, body and soul, the  northland had claimed him, and that  he hoped to die in it when his  time came. Her eyes glowed at that. She  told him of two years she  had spent in Montreal and Quebec, of her  homesickness, her joy  when she returned to her forests. It seemed, for  a time, that they  had forgotten St. Pierre. They did not speak of him.  Twice they  saw Andre, the Broken Man, but the name of Roger Audemard  was not  spoken. And a little at a time she told him of the hidden  paradise  of the Boulains away up in the unmapped wildernesses of the   Yellowknife beyond the Great Bear, and of the great log chateau  that  was her home. 
  A part of the afternoon he spent on shore. He filled a moosehide   bag full of sand and suspended it from the limb of a tree, and for   three-quarters of an hour pommeled it with his fists, much to the   curiosity and amusement of St. Pierre's men, who could see nothing  of  man-fighting in these antics. But the exercise assured David  that he  had lost but little of his strength and that he would be  in form to  meet Bateese when the time came. Toward evening Marie-  Anne joined  him, and they walked for half an hour up and down the  beach. It was  Bateese who got supper. And after that Carrigan sat  with Marie-Anne on  the foredeck of the barge and smoked another of  St. Pierre's cigars. 
  The camp of the rivermen was two hundred yards below the bateau,   screened between by a finger of hardwood, so that except when they   broke into a chorus of laughter or strengthened their throats with   snatches of song, there was no sound of their voices. But Bateese  was  in the stern, and Nepapinas was forever flitting in and out  among the  shadows on the shore, like a shadow himself, and Andre,  the Broken  Man, hovered near as night came on. At last he sat down  in the edge of  the white sand of the beach, and there he remained,  a silent and  lonely figure, as the twilight deepened. Over the  world hovered a  sleepy quiet. Out of the forest came the droning  of the wood-crickets,  the last twitterings of the day birds, and  the beginning of night  sounds. A great shadow floated out over the  river close to the bateau,  the first of the questing, blood-  seeking owls adventuring out like  pirates from their hiding-places  of the day. One after another, as the  darkness thickened, the  different tribes of the people of the night  answered the summons  of the first stars. A mile down the river a loon  gave its harsh  love-cry; far out of the west came the faint trail-song  of a wolf;  in the river the night-feeding trout splashed like the  tails of  beaver; over the roof of the wilderness came the coughing,  moaning  challenge of a bull moose that yearned for battle. And over  these  same forest tops rose the moon, the stars grew thicker and   brighter, and through the finger of hardwood glowed the fire of  St.  Pierre Boulain's men&#8212;while close beside him, silent in these  hours of  silence, David felt growing nearer and still nearer to  him the  presence of St. Pierre's wife. 
  On the strip of sand Andre, the Broken Man, rose and stood like   the stub of a misshapen tree. And then slowly he moved on and was   swallowed up in the mellow glow of the night. 
  &quot;It is at night that he seeks,&quot; said St. Pierre's wife, for it was   as if David had spoken the thought that was in his mind. 
  David, for a moment, was silent. And then he said, &quot;You asked me   to tell you about Black Roger Audemard. I will, if you care to  have  me. Do you?&quot; 
  He saw the nodding of her head, though the moon and star-mist   veiled her face. 
  &quot;Yes. What do the Police say about Roger Audemard?&quot; 
  He told her. And not once in the telling of the story did she   speak or move. It was a terrible story at best, he thought, but he   did not weaken it by smoothing over the details. This was his   opportunity. He wanted her to know why he must possess the body of   Roger Audemard, if not alive, then dead, and he wanted her to   understand how important it was that he learn more about Andre,  the  Broken Man. 
  &quot;He was a fiend, this Roger Audemard,&quot; he began. &quot;A devil in man   shape, afterward called 'Black Roger' because of the color of his   soul.&quot; 
  Then he went on. He described Hatchet River Post, where the   tragedy had happened; then told of the fight that came about one  day  between Roger Audemard and the factor of the post and his two  sons. It  was an unfair fight; he conceded that&#8212;three to one was  cowardly in a  fight. But it could not excuse what happened  afterward. Audemard was  beaten. He crept off into the forest,  almost dead. Then he came back  one stormy night in the winter with  three strange friends. Who the  friends were the Police never  learned. There was a fight, but all  through the fight Black Roger  Audemard cried out not to kill the  factor and his sons. In spite  of that one of the sons was killed. Then  the terrible thing  happened. The father and his remaining son were  bound hand and  foot and fastened in the ancient dungeon room under the  Post  building. Then Black Roger set the building on fire, and stood   outside in the storm and laughed like a madman at the dying  shrieks  of his victims. It was the season when the trappers were  on their  lines, and there were but few people at the post. The  company clerk  and one other attempted to interfere, and Black  Roger killed them with  his own hands. Five deaths that night&#8212;two  of them horrible beyond  description! 
  Resting for a moment, Carrigan went on to tell of the long years   of unavailing search made by the Police after that; how Black  Roger  was caught once and killed his captor. Then came the rumor  that he was  dead, and rumor grew into official belief, and the  Police no longer  hunted for his trails. Then, not long ago, came  the discovery that  Black Roger was still living, and he, Dave  Carrigan, was after him. 
  For a time there was silence after he had finished. Then St.   Pierre's wife rose to her feet. &quot;I wonder,&quot; she said in a low  voice,  &quot;what Roger Audemard's own story might be if he were here  to tell it?&quot; 
  She stepped out from under the awning, and in the full radiance of   the moon he saw the pale beauty of her face and the crowning  luster  of her hair. 
  &quot;Good night!&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;Good night!&quot; said David. 
  He listened until her retreating footsteps died away, and for   hours after that he had no thought of sleep. He had insisted that  she  take possession of her cabin again, and Bateese had brought  out a  bundle of blankets. These he spread under the awning, and  when he  drowsed off, it was to dream of the lovely face he had  seen last in  the glow of the moon. 
  It was in the afternoon of the fourth day that two things   happened&#8212;one that he had prepared himself for, and another so   unexpected that for a space it sent his world crashing out of its   orbit. With St. Pierre's wife he had gone again to the ridge-line  for  flowers, half a mile back from the river. Returning a new way,  they  came to a shallow stream, and Marie-Anne stood at the edge of  it, and  there was laughter in her shining eyes as she looked to  the other side  of it. She had twined flowers into her hair. Her  cheeks were rich with  color. Her slim figure was exquisite in its  wild pulse of life. 
  Suddenly she turned on him, her red lips smiling their witchery in   his face. &quot;You must carry me across,&quot; she said. 
  He did not answer. He was a-tremble as he drew near her. She   raised her arms a little, waiting. And then he picked her up. She  was  against his breast. Her two hands went to his shoulders as he  waded  into the stream; he slipped, and they clung a little  tighter. The soft  note of laughter was in her throat when the  current came to his knees  out in the middle of the stream. He held  her tighter; and then  stupidly, he slipped again, and the movement  brought her lower in his  arms, so that for a space her head was  against his breast and his face  was crushed in the soft masses of  her hair. He came with her that way  to the opposite shore and  stood her on her feet again, standing back  quickly so that she  would not hear the pounding of his heart. Her face  was radiantly  beautiful, and she did not look at David, but away from  him. 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. 
  And then, suddenly, they heard running feet behind them, and in   another moment one of the brigade men came dashing through the   stream. At the same time there came from the river a quarter of a   mile away a thunderous burst of voice. It was not the voice of a   dozen men, but of half a hundred, and Marie-Anne grew tense,   listening, her eyes on fire even before the messenger could get  the  words out of his mouth. 
  &quot;It is St. Pierre!&quot; he cried then. &quot;He has come with the great   raft, and you must hurry if you would reach the bateau before he   lands!&quot; 
  In that moment it seemed to David that Marie-Anne forgot he was   alive. A little cry came to her lips, and then she left him,  running  swiftly, saying no word to him, flying with the speed of a  fawn to St.  Pierre Boulain! And when David turned to the man who  had come up  behind them, there was a strange smile on the lips of  the lithe-limbed  forest-runner as his eyes followed the hurrying  figure of St. Pierre's  wife. 
  Until she was out of sight he stood in silence and then he said: 
  &quot;Come, m'sieu. We, also, must meet St. Pierre!&quot;
