Next morning the day broke bright and calm, as if the tempest had been  but an evil dream of the night, now past forever. The birds sang loud;  the lizards came forth from their holes in the wall, and basked, green  and gold, in the warm, dry sunshine. But though the sky overhead was blue  and the air clear, as usually happen after these alarming tropical  cyclones and rainstorms, the memorials of the great wind that had raged  all night long among the forests of the island were neither few nor far  between. Everywhere the ground was strewn with leaves and branches and  huge stems of cocoa-palms. All nature was draggled. Many of the trees  were stripped clean of their foliage, as completely as oaks in an English  winter; on others, big strands of twisted fibres marked the scars and  joints where mighty boughs had been torn away by main force; while,  elsewhere, bare stumps alone remained to mark the former presence of some  noble dracaena or some gigantic banyan. Bread-fruits and cocoanuts lay  tossed in the wildest confusion on the ground; the banana and  plantain-patches were beaten level with the soil or buried deep in the  mud; many of the huts had given way entirely; abundant wreckage strewed  every corner of the island. It was an awful sight. Muriel shuddered to  herself to see how much the two that night had passed through.    
What the outer fringing reef had suffered from the storm they hardly knew  as yet; but from the door of the hut Felix could see for himself how even  the calm waters of the inner lagoon had been lashed into wild fury by the  fierce swoop of the tempest. Round the entire atoll the solid  conglomerate coral floor was scooped under, broken up, chewed fine by the  waves, or thrown in vast fragments on the beach of the island. By the  eastern shore, in particular, just opposite their hut, Felix observed a  regular wall of many feet in height, piled up by the waves like the  familiar Chesil Beach near his old home in Dorsetshire. It was the  shelter of that temporary barrier alone, no doubt, that had preserved  their huts last night from the full fury of the gale, and that had  allowed the natives to congregate in such numbers prone on their faces in  the mud and rain, upon the unconsecrated ground outside their taboo-line.    
But now not an islander was to be seen within ear-shot. All had gone away  to look after their ruined huts or their beaten-down plantain-patches,  leaving the cruel gods, who, as they thought, had wrought all the  mischief out of pure wantonness, to repent at leisure the harm done  during the night to their obedient votaries.    
Felix was just about to cross the taboo-line and walk down to the shore  to examine the barrier, when Toko, his Shadow, laying his hand on his  shoulder with more genuine interest and affection than he had ever yet  shown, exclaimed, with some horror, "Oh, no! Not that! Don't dare to go  outside! It would be very dangerous for you. If my people were to catch  you on profane soil just now, there's no saying what harm they might do  to you."    
"Why so?" Felix exclaimed, in surprise. "Last night, surely, they were  all prayers and promises and vows and entreaties."    
The young man nodded his head in acquiescence. "Ah, yes; last night," he  answered. "That was very well then. Vows were sore needed. The storm was  raging, and you were within your taboo. How could they dare to touch you,  a mighty god of the tempest, at the very moment when you were rending  their banyan-trees and snapping their cocoanut stems with your mighty  arms like so many little chicken-bones? Even Tu-Kila-Kila himself, I  expect, the very high god, lay frightened in his temple, cowering by his  tree, annoyed at your wrath; he sent Fire and Water among the  worshippers, no doubt, to offer up vows and to appease your anger."    
Then Felix remembered, as his Shadow spoke, that, as a matter of fact, he  had observed the men who usually wore the red and white feather cloaks  among the motley crowd of grovelling natives who lay flat on their faces  in the mud of the cleared space the night before, and prayed hard for  mercy. Only they were not wearing their robes of office at the moment, in  accordance with a well-known savage custom; they had come naked and in  disgrace, as befits all suppliants. They had left behind them the  insignia of their rank in their own shaken huts, and bowed down their  bare backs to the rain and the lightning.    
"Yes, I saw them among the other islanders," Felix answered,  half-smiling, but prudently remaining within the taboo-line, as his  Shadow advised him.    
Toko kept his hand still on his master's shoulder. "Oh, king," he said,  beseechingly, and with great solemnity, "I am doing wrong to warn you; I  am breaking a very great Taboo. I don't know what harm may come to me for  telling you. Perhaps Tu-Kila-Kila will burn me to ashes with one glance  of his eyes. He may know this minute what I'm saying here alone to you."    
It is hard for a white man to meet scruples like this; but Felix was bold  enough to answer outright: "Tu-Kila-Kila knows nothing of the sort, and  can never find out. Take my word for it, Toko, nothing that you say to me  will ever reach Tu-Kila-Kila."    
The Shadow looked at him doubtfully, and trembled as he spoke. "I like  you, Korong," he said, with a genuinely truthful ring in his voice. "You  seem to me so kind and good--so different from other gods, who are very  cruel. You never beat me. Nobody I ever served treated me as well or as  kindly as you have done. And for <i>your</i> sake I will even dare to break  taboo--if you're quite, quite sure Tu-Kila-Kila will never discover it."    
"I'm quite sure," Felix answered, with perfect confidence. "I know it for  certain. I swear a great oath to it."    
"You swear by Tu-Kila-Kila himself?" the young savage asked, anxiously.    
"I swear by Tu-Kila-Kila himself," Felix replied at once. "I swear,  without doubt. He can never know it."    
"That is a great Taboo," the Shadow went on, meditatively, stroking  Felix's arm. "A very great Taboo indeed. A terrible medicine. And you  are a god; I can trust you. Well, then, you see, the secret is this:  you are Korong, but you are a stranger, and you don't understand the  ways of Boupari. If for three days after the end of this storm, which  Tu-Kila-Kila has sent Fire and Water to pray and vow against, you or the  Queen of the Clouds show yourselves outside your own taboo-line--why,  then, the people are clear of sin; whoever takes you may rend you alive;  they will tear you limb from limb and cut you into pieces."    
"Why so?" Felix asked, aghast at this discovery. They seemed to live on a  perpetual volcano in this wonderful island; and a volcano ever breaking  out in fresh places. They could never get to the bottom of its horrible  superstitions.    
"Because you ate the storm-apple," the Shadow answered, confidently.  "That was very wrong. You brought the tempest upon us yourselves by your  own trespass; therefore, by the custom of Boupari, which we learn in the  mysteries, you become full Korong for the sacrifice at once. That makes  the term for you. The people will give you all your dues; then they will  say, 'We are free; we have bought you with a price; we have brought your  cocoanuts. No sin attaches to us; we are righteous; we are righteous.'  And then they will kill you, and Fire and Water will roast you and boil  you."    
"But only if we go outside the taboo-line?" Felix asked, anxiously.    
"Only if you go outside the taboo-line," the Shadow replied, nodding a  hasty assent. "Inside it, till your term comes, even Tu-Kila-Kila  himself, the very high god, whose meat we all are, dare never hurt you."    
"Till our term comes?" Felix inquired, once more astonished and  perplexed. "What do you mean by that, my Shadow?"    
But the Shadow was either bound by some superstitious fear, or else  incapable of putting himself into Felix's point of view. "Why, till you  are full Korong," he answered, like one who speaks of some familiar fact,  as who should say, till you are forty years old, or, till your beard  grows white. "Of course, by and by, you will be full Korong. I cannot  help you then; but, till that time comes, I would like to do my best by  you. You have been very kind to me. I tell you much. More than this,  it would not be lawful for me to mention."    
And that was the most that, by dexterous questioning, Felix could ever  manage to get out of his mysterious Shadow.    
"At the end of three days we will be safe, though?" he inquired at last,  after all other questions failed to produce an answer.    
"Oh, yes, at the end of three days the storm will have blown over," the  young man answered, easily. "All will then be well. You may venture out  once more. The rain will have dried over all the island. Fire and Water  will have no more power over you."    
Felix went back to the hut to inform Muriel of this new peril thus  suddenly sprung upon them. Poor Muriel, now almost worn out with endless  terrors, received it calmly. "I'm growing accustomed to it all, Felix,"  she answered, resignedly. "If only I know that you will keep your  promise, and never let me fall alive into these wretches' hands, I shall  feel quite safe. Oh, Felix, do you know when you took me in your arms  like that last night, in spite of everything, I felt positively happy."    
About ten o'clock they were suddenly roused by a sound of many natives,  coming in quick succession, single file, to the huts, and shouting aloud,  "Oh, King of the Rain, oh, Queen of the Clouds, come forth for our vows!  Receive your presents!"    
Felix went forth to the door to look. With a warning look in his eyes,  his Shadow followed him. The natives were now coming up by dozens at a  time, bringing with them, in great arm-loads, fallen cocoanuts and  breadfruits, and branches of bananas, and large draggled clusters of  half-ripe plantains.    
"Why, what are all these?" Felix exclaimed in surprise.    
His Shadow looked up at him, as if amused at the absurd simplicity of the  question. "These are yours, of course," he said; "yours and the Queen's;  they are the windfalls you made. Did you not knock them all off the trees  for yourselves when you were coming down in such sheets from the sky last  evening?"    
Felix wrung his hands in positive despair. It was clear, indeed, that to  the minds of the natives there was no distinguishing personally between  himself and Muriel, and the rain or the cyclone.    
"Will they bring them all in?" he asked, gazing in alarm at the huge pile  of fruits the natives were making outside the huts.    
"Yes, all," the Shadow answered; "they are vows; they are godsends; but  if you like, you can give some of them back. If you give much back, of  course it will make my people less angry with you."    
Felix advanced near the line, holding his hand up before him to command  silence. As he did so, he was absolutely appalled himself at the perfect  storm of execration and abuse which his appearance excited. The foremost  natives, brandishing their clubs and stone-tipped spears, or shaking  their fists by the line, poured forth upon his devoted head at once all  the most frightful curses of the Polynesian vocabulary. "Oh, evil god,"  they cried aloud with angry faces, "oh, wicked spirit! you have a bad  heart. See what a wrong you have purposely done us. If your heart were  not bad, would you treat us like this? If you are indeed a god, come out  across the line, and let us try issues together. Don't skulk like a  coward in your hut and within your taboo, but come out and fight us. <i>We</i>  are not afraid, who are only men. Why are <i>you</i> afraid of us?"    
Felix tried to speak once more, but the din drowned his voice. As he  paused, the people set up their loud shouts again. "Oh, you wicked god!  You eat the storm-apple! You have wrought us much harm. You have spoiled  our harvest. How you came down in great sheets last night! It was  pitiful, pitiful! We would like to kill you. You might have taken our  bread-fruits and our bananas, if you would; we give you them freely; they  are yours; here, take them. We feed you well; we make you many offerings.  But why did you wish to have our huts also? Why did you beat down our  young plantations and break our canoes against the beach of the island?  That shows a bad heart! You are an evil god! You dare not defend  yourself. Come out and meet us."
