  &#8220;I am sorry to part with you, Harry,&#8221; said Professor Henderson. &#8220;You  have been a very satisfactory and efficient assistant, and I shall miss  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I have tried to be faithful to your  interests.&#8221;
  &#8220;You have been so,&#8221; said the Professor emphatically. &#8220;I have had  perfect confidence in you, and this has relieved me of a great deal of  anxiety. It would have been very easy for one in your position to cheat  me out of a considerable sum of money.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was no credit to me to resist such a temptation as that,&#8221; said  Harry.
  &#8220;I am glad to hear you say so, but it shows your inexperience  nevertheless. Money is the great tempter nowadays. Consider how many  defalcations and breaches of trust we read of daily in confidential  positions, and we are forced to conclude that honesty is a rarer virtue  than we like to think it. I have every reason to believe that my  assistant last winter purloined, at the least, a hundred dollars, but I  was unable to prove it, and submitted to the loss. It may be the same  next winter. Can't I induce you to change your resolution, and remain  in my employ? I will advance your pay.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Professor Henderson,&#8221; said Harry gratefully. &#8220;I  appreciate your offer, even if I do not accept it. But I have made up  mind to learn the printing business.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are to enter the office of the 'Centreville Gazette,' I  believe.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;How much pay will you get?&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall receive my board the first month, and for the next six  months have agreed to take two dollars a week and board.&#8221;
  &#8220;That won't pay your expenses.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must,&#8221; said Harry, firmly.
  &#8220;You have laid up some money while with me, haven't you!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir; I have fifty dollars in my pocket-book, besides having  given eighty dollars at home.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is doing well, but you won't be able to lay up anything for  the next year.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps not in money, but I shall be gaining the knowledge of a  good trade.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you like that better than remaining with me, and learning my  business?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, perhaps you are right. I don't fancy being a magician myself;  but I am too old to change. I like moving round, and I make a good  living for my family. Besides I contribute to the innocent amusement of  the public, and earn my money fairly.&#8221;
  &#8220;I agree with you, sir,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I think yours is a useful  employment, but it would not suit everybody. Ever since I read the life  of Benjamin Franklin, I have wanted to learn to be a printer.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is an excellent business, no doubt, and if you have made up your  mind I will not dissuade you. When you have a paper of your own, you  can give your old friend, Professor Henderson, an occasional puff.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be glad to do that,&#8221; said Harry, smiling, &#8220;but I shall have  to wait some time first.&#8221;
  &#8220;How old are you now?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sixteen.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you may qualify yourself for an editor in five or six years. I  advise you to try it at any rate. The editor in America is a man of  influence.&#8221;
  &#8220;I do look forward to it,&#8221; said Harry, seriously. &#8220;I should not be  satisfied to remain a journeyman all my life, nor even the half of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I sympathize with your ambition, Harry,&#8221; said the Professor,  earnestly, &#8220;and I wish you the best success. Let me hear from you  occasionally.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should be very glad to write you, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see the stage is at the door, and I must bid you good-by. When  you have a vacation, if you get a chance to come our way, Mrs.  Henderson and myself will be glad to receive a visit from you.  Good-by!&#8221; And with a hearty shake of the hand, Professor Henderson bade  farewell to his late assistant.
  Those who have read &#8220;Bound to Rise,&#8221; and are thus familiar with  Harry Walton's early history, will need no explanation of the preceding  conversation. But for the benefit of new readers, I will recapitulate  briefly the leading events in the history of the boy of sixteen who is  to be our hero.
  Harry Walton was the oldest son of a poor New Hampshire farmer, who  found great difficulty is wresting from his few sterile acres a living  for his family. Nearly a year before, he had lost his only cow by a  prevalent disease, and being without money, was compelled to buy  another of Squire Green, a rich but mean neighbor, on a six months'  note, on very unfavorable terms. As it required great economy to make  both ends meet, there seemed no possible chance of his being able to  meet the note at maturity. Beside, Mr. Walton was to forfeit ten  dollars if he did not have the principal and interest ready for Squire  Green. The hard-hearted creditor was mean enough to take advantage of  his poor neighbor's necessities, and there was not the slightest chance  of his receding from his unreasonable demand. Under these circumstances  Harry, the oldest boy, asked his father's permission to go out into the  world and earn his own living. He hoped not only to do this, but to  save something toward paying his father's note. His ambition had been  kindled by reading the life of Benjamin Franklin, which had been  awarded to him as a school prize. He did not expect to emulate  Franklin, but he thought that by imitating him he might attain an  honorable position in the community.
  Harry's request was not at first favorably received. To send a boy  out into the world to earn his own living is a hazardous experiment,  and fathers are less sanguine than their sons. Their experience  suggests difficulties and obstacles of which the inexperienced youth  knows and possesses nothing. But in the present case Mr. Walton  reflected that the little farming town in which he lived offered small  inducements for a boy to remain there, unless he was content to be a  farmer, and this required capital. His farm was too small for himself,  and of course he could not give Harry a part when be came of age. On  the whole, therefore, Harry's plan of becoming a mechanic seemed not so  bad a one after all. So permission was accorded, and our hero, with his  little bundle of clothes, left the paternal roof, and went out in quest  of employment.
  After some adventures Harry obtained employment in a shoe-shop as  pegger. A few weeks sufficed to make him a good workman, and he was  then able to earn three dollars a week and board. Out of this sum be  hoped to save enough to pay the note held by Squire Green against his  father, but there were two unforeseen obstacles. He had the misfortune  to lose his pocket-book, which was picked up by an unprincipled young  man, by name Luke Harrison, also a shoemaker, who was always in  pecuniary difficulties, though he earned much higher wages than Harry.  Luke was unable to resist the temptation, and appropriated the money to  his own use. This Harry ascertained after a while, but thus far had  succeeded in obtaining the restitution of but a small portion of his  hard-earned savings. The second obstacle was a sudden depression in the  shoe trade which threw him out of work. More than most occupations the  shoe business is liable to these sudden fluctuations and suspensions,  and the most industrious and ambitious workman is often compelled to  spend in his enforced weeks of idleness all that he had been able to  save when employed, and thus at the end of the year finds himself,  through no fault of his own, no better off than at the beginning.  Finding himself out of work, our hero visited other shoe establishments  in the hope of employment. But his search was in vain. Chance in this  emergency made him acquainted with Professor Henderson, a well-known  magician and conjurer, whose custom it was to travel, through the fall  and winter, from town to town, giving public exhibitions of his skill.  He was in want of an assistant, to sell tickets and help him generally,  and he offered the position to our hero, at a salary of five dollars a  week. It is needless to say that the position was gladly accepted. It  was not the business that Harry preferred, but he reasoned justly that  it was honorable, and was far better than remaining idle. He found  Professor Henderson as he called himself, a considerate and agreeable  employer, and as may be inferred from the conversation with which this  chapter begins, his services were very satisfactory. At the close of  the six months, he had the satisfaction of paying the note which his  father had given, and so of disappointing the selfish schemes of the  grasping creditor.
  This was not all. He met with an adventure while travelling for the  Professor, in which a highwayman who undertook to rob him, came off  second best, and he was thus enabled to add fifty dollars to his  savings. His financial condition at the opening of the present story  has already been set forth.
  Though I have necessarily omitted many interesting details, to be  found in &#8220;Bound to Rise,&#8221; I have given the reader all the information  required to enable him to understand the narrative of Harry's  subsequent fortunes.
