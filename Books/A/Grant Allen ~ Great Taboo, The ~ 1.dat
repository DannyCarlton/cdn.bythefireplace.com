I desire to express my profound indebtedness, for the central  mythological idea embodied in this tale, to Mr. J.G. Frazer's admirable  and epoch-making work, "The Golden Bough," whose main contention I have  endeavored incidentally to popularize in my present story. I wish also to  express my obligations in other ways to Mr. Andrew Lang's "Myth, Ritual,  and Religion," Mr. H.O. Forbes's "Naturalist's Wanderings," and Mr.  Julian Thomas's "Cannibals and Convicts." If I have omitted to mention  any other author to whom I may have owed incidental hints, it will be  some consolation to me to reflect that I shall at least have afforded an  opportunity for legitimate sport to the amateurs of the new and popular  British pastime of badger-baiting or plagiary-hunting. It may also save  critics some moments' search if I say at once that, after careful  consideration, I have been unable to discover any moral whatsoever in  this humble narrative. I venture to believe that in so enlightened an age  the majority of my readers will never miss it.
