    When Mr. Smith had made the two boys' understand that he suspected   them of purloining the missing five-dollar bill, they were naturally   very indignant. 
  &quot;Mr. Smith,&quot; said Ben Platt, in a spirited tone, &quot;no one ever   suspected me of dishonesty before.&quot; 
  &quot;Nor me,&quot; said Wilkins. 
  &quot;That's neither here nor there,&quot; said the principal, dogmatically.   &quot;It stands to reason that some one took the money. Money doesn't   generally walk off itself,&quot; he added, with a sneer. 
  &quot;I don't dispute that,&quot; said Ben; &quot;but that does not prove that   Wilkins or I had anything to do with it.&quot; 
  &quot;You were in the room with the money for half an hour, according to   your own confession,&quot; said Socrates. 
  &quot;Yes, I was.&quot; 
  &quot;And part of that time Wilkins was also present.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; assented Wilkins. 
  &quot;I am no lawyer,&quot; said the principal, triumphantly, &quot;but that seems   to me a pretty good case of circumstantial evidence.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem to forget, sir, that there is another person who had an   excellent chance to take the money,&quot; said Ben Platt. 
  &quot;You mean Hector Roscoe? That is true. It lies between you three.&quot; 
  &quot;No, Mr. Smith, I do not mean Hector Roscoe. I have as much   confidence in Roscoe as myself.&quot; 
  &quot;So have I,&quot; sneered Socrates. 
  &quot;And I know he would not take any money that did not belong to him.   I mean a very different person&#8212;your nephew, James Smith.&quot; 
  Socrates Smith frowned with anger. &quot;There seems to be a conspiracy   against my unfortunate nephew,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't believe a word of   your mean insinuations, and I am not deceived by your attempt to   throw your own criminality upon him. It will not injure him in my   eyes. Moreover, I shall be able to trace back the theft to the   wrongdoer. The missing bill was marked with a cross upon the back,   and should either of you attempt to pass it, your guilt will be made   manifest. I advise you to restore it to me while there is yet time.&quot; 
  &quot;The bill was marked?&quot; asked Wilkins, eagerly. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, sir, you may have a chance to find out who took it.&quot; 
  &quot;The discovery might not please you,&quot; said Socrates, with a sneer. 
  &quot;It would give me the greatest pleasure, Mr. Smith. If I can in any   way help you discover the missing note, I will do so.&quot; 
  &quot;You can go,&quot; said Socrates, abruptly. 
  When the two boys had left the presence of the principal, Ben  Platt,  said, &quot;What are you going to do about it, Wilkins?&quot; 
  &quot;First of all,&quot; answered Wilkins, promptly, &quot;I am going to find out   if Jim took that money.&quot; 
  &quot;How can you find out?&quot; 
  &quot;Did you notice that he had come out with a new ring?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I didn't observe it.&quot; 
  &quot;He has bought it since that money was lost!&quot; said Wilkins,   significantly. 
  &quot;Do you think he purchased it with the missing bill?&quot; 
  &quot;I wouldn't wonder at all. At any rate, I am going to find out. He   must have bought it from Washburn, the jeweler. Will you go with me,   and ask?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Ben, eagerly. &quot;Let us go alone. If we can only  prove  the theft upon Jim, so that old Sock can't help believing that  he  stole the money, we shall be cleared; though, as to that, there   isn't a scholar in school who would believe the charge against us.&quot; 
  &quot;Still, we may as well do what we can to bring the guilt home to  Jim  Smith.&quot; 
  Ten minutes later the two boys entered the shop of Mr. Washburn. 
  &quot;Will you show me some rings, Mr. Washburn?&quot; asked Wilkins. 
  &quot;Certainly,&quot; answered the jeweler, politely. 
  &quot;What is the price of that?&quot; asked Wilkins, pointing to one exactly   like the one he had seen on Jim's finger. 
  &quot;Three dollars and a half. It is a very pretty pattern.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir. There's one of our boys who has one just like it.&quot; 
  &quot;You mean James Smith, the principal's nephew.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;He bought it of me yesterday.&quot; 
  The two boys exchanged a quick glance. 
  They felt that they were on the brink of a discovery. 
  &quot;Did he give you a five-dollar bill in payment?&quot; asked Ben Platt. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered the jeweler, in surprise. 
  &quot;Could you identify that bill?&quot; 
  &quot;What are you driving at, boys?&quot; asked Mr. Washburn, keenly. 
  &quot;I will explain to you if you will answer my questions first.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I could identify the bill.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you it in your possession still?&quot; 
  &quot;I have.&quot; 
  &quot;How will you know it?&quot; 
  &quot;It seems to me, my boy, you are in training for a lawyer.&quot; 
  &quot;I have a very urgent reason for asking you this question, Mr.   Washburn.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I will answer you. When the note was given me, I noticed that   it was on the Park Bank of New York.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you be kind enough to see if you can find it?&quot;' 
  &quot;Certainly.&quot; 
  The jeweler opened his money drawer, and after a brief search,   produced the bill in question. 
  It was a five-dollar bill on the Park Bank of New York, as he had   already told the boys. 
  &quot;Now, Mr. Washburn,&quot; asked Wilkins, trying to repress his   excitement, &quot;will you examine the back of the bill, and see if there   is any mark on it.&quot; 
  The jeweler did as requested, and announced, after slight   examination, that there was a cross on the back of the bill in the   upper right hand corner. 
  &quot;Hurrah!&quot; shouted Ben, impulsively. 
  To the wondering jeweler he explained his precise object in the   inquiry he had made, and the boys were complimented by Mr. Washburn   for their shrewdness. 
  &quot;If I ever meet with a loss, I shall certainly call on you for   assistance, boys,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Washburn,&quot; answered Wilkins, &quot;but I do not expect  to  be here to be called upon.&quot; 
  &quot;You are not going to leave the institute, are you?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall write to my father in what manner I have been treated, and   let him understand how the principal manages the school, and I feel   sure he will withdraw me.&quot; 
  &quot;Ditto for me!&quot; said Ben Platt. &quot;Old Sock's partiality for his   nephew has been carried too far, and now that the only decent  teacher  is going&#8212;Mr. Crabb&#8212;I don't mean, to stay here if I can  help it.&quot; 
  The boys, upon their return to the school, sought out the  principal. 
  &quot;Well, boys,&quot; he said, &quot;have you come to confess?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered Ben, &quot;but we have come to give you some   information about your money.&quot; 
  &quot;I was sure you knew something about it,&quot; said Socrates, with a   sneer. &quot;I am glad you have decided to make a clean breast of it.&quot; 
  &quot;You are mistaken, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, out with your information!&quot; said the principal, roughly. 
  &quot;A five-dollar bill, marked as you have described, was paid to Mr.   Washburn, the jeweler, only yesterday.&quot; 
  &quot;Ha! Well?&quot; 
  &quot;The one who offered it purchased a gold ring.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't care what he bought. Who was it that offered the money?&quot; 
  &quot;Your nephew, James Smith!&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe it,&quot; said the teacher, very much disconcerted. 
  &quot;Then, sir, I advise you to question Mr. Washburn.&quot; 
  &quot;How can he identify the bill? Is it the only five-dollar bill he   has?&quot; 
  &quot;The only five-dollar bill on the Park Bank of New York, and he  says  he noticed that this was the bank that issued the bill handed him  by  your nephew.&quot; 
  &quot;What of that?&quot; 
  &quot;The note, which he still has in his possession, is marked just   exactly as you have described.&quot; 
  &quot;It may have been marked since it came into Mr. Washburn's hands,&quot;   said Socrates, but he was evidently very much disturbed by the   intelligence. He might not confess it, but he could not help   believing that Jim was the thief, after all. 
  &quot;You can go,&quot; he said, harshly. &quot;I will look into this improbable   story.&quot;
