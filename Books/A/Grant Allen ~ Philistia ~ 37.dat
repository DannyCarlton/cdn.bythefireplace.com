Long before the 'Social Reformer' had fully made its mark in the  world, another event had happened of no less importance to some  of the chief actors in the little drama whose natural termination  it seemed to form. While the pamphlet and the paper were in course  of maturation, Arthur Berkeley had been running daily in and out  of the house in Wilton Place in what Lady Exmoor several times  described as a positively disgraceful and unseemly manner. ('What  Hilda can mean,' her ladyship observed to her husband more than  once, 'by encouraging that odd young man's extraordinary advances  in the way she does is really more than I can understand even in  her.') But when the Le Bretons were fairly launched at last on the  favourable flood of full prosperity, both Hilda and Arthur began to  feel as though they had suddenly been deprived of a very pleasant  common interest. After all, benevolent counsel on behalf of other  people is not so entirely innocent and impersonal in certain cases  as it seems to be at first sight. 'Do you know, Lady Hilda,'  Berkeley said one afternoon, when he had come to pay, as it were,  a sort of farewell visit, on the final completion of their joint  schemes for restoring happiness to the home of the Le Bretons,  'our intercourse together has been very delightful, and I'm quite  sorry to think that in future we must see so much less of one another  than we've been in the habit of doing for the last month or so.'    
Hilda looked at him straight and said in her own frank unaffected  fashion, 'So am I, Mr. Berkeley, very sorry, very sorry indeed.'    
Arthur looked back at her once more, and their eyes met. His  look was full of admiration, and Hilda saw it. She moved a little  uneasily upon the ottoman, waiting apparently as though she expected  Arthur to say something else. But Arthur looked at her long and  steadfastly, and said nothing.    
At last he seemed to wake from his reverie, and make up his mind  for a desperate venture. Could he be mistaken? Could he have read  either record wrong--his own heart, or Hilda's eyes? No, no, both  of them spoke to him too plainly and evidently. His heart was  fluttering like a wind-shaken aspen-leaf; and Hilda's eyes were  dimming visibly with a tender moisture. Yes, yes, yes, there was  no misreading possible. He knew he loved her! he knew she loved  him!    
Bending over towards where Hilda sat, he took her hand in  his dreamily: and Hilda let him take it without a movement. Then  he looked deeply into her eyes, and felt a curious speechlessness  coming over him, deep down in the ball of his throat.    
'Lady Hilda,' he began at last with an effort, in a low voice, not  wholly untinged with natural timidity, 'Lady Hilda, is a working  man's son----'    
Hilda looked back at him with a sudden look of earnest deprecation.  'Not that way, Mr. Berkeley,' she said quietly: 'not that way,  please: you'll hurt me if you do: you know that's not the way <i>I</i>  look at the matter. Why not simply "Hilda"?'    
Berkeley clasped her hand eagerly and raised it to his lips. 'Hilda,  then,' he said, kissing it twice over. 'It <i>shall</i> be Hilda.'    
Hilda rose and stood before him erect in all her queenlike beauty.  'So now that's settled,' she said, with a vain endeavour to control  her tears of joy. 'Don't let's talk about it any more, now; I can't  bear to talk about it: there's nothing to arrange, Arthur. Whenever  you like will suit me. But, oh, I'm so happy, so happy, so happy--I  never thought I could be so happy.'    
'Nor I,' Arthur answered, holding her hand a moment in his tenderly.    
'How strange,' Hilda said again, after a minute's delicious silence;  'it's the poor Le Bretons who have brought us two thus together.  And yet, they were both once our dearest rivals. <i>You</i> were in love  with Edie Le Breton: <i>I</i> was half in love with Ernest Le Breton:  and now--why, now, Arthur, I <i>do</i> believe we're both utterly in love  with one another. What a curious little comedy of errors!'    
'And yet only a few months ago it came very near being a tragedy,  rather,' Arthur put in softly.    
'Never mind!' Hilda answered in her brightest and most joyous tone,  as she wiped the joyful tears from her eyes. 'It isn't a tragedy,  now, after all, Arthur, and all's well that ends well!'    
When the Countess heard of Hilda's determination--Hilda didn't  pretend to go through the domestic farce of asking her mother's  consent to her approaching marriage--she said that so far as she  was concerned a more shocking or un-Christian piece of conduct on  the part of a well-brought-up girl had never yet been brought to  her knowledge. To refuse Lord Connemara, and then go and marry the  son of a common cobbler! But the Earl only puffed away vigorously  at his cheroot, and observed philosophically that for his part he  just considered himself jolly well out of it. This young fellow  Berkeley mightn't be a man of the sort of family Hilda would  naturally expect to marry into, but he was decently educated and  in good society, and above all, a gentleman, you know, don't you  know: and, hang it all, in these days that's really everything.  Besides, Berkeley was making a pot of money out of these operas  of his, the Earl understood, and as he had always expected that  Hilda'd marry some penniless painter or somebody of that sort, and  be a perpetual drag upon the family exchequer, he really didn't see  why they need trouble their heads very much about it. By George,  if it came to that, he rather congratulated himself that the girl  hadn't taken it into her nonsensical head to run away with the groom  or the stable-boy! As to Lynmouth, he merely remarked succinctly in  his own dialect, 'Go it, Hilda, go it, my beauty! You always were  a one-er, you know, and it's my belief you always will be.'    
It was somewhere about the same time that Ronald Le Breton, coming  back gladdened in soul from a cheerful talk with Ernest, called  round of an evening in somewhat unwonted exultation at Selah's  lodgings. 'Selah,' he said to her calmly, as she met him at the door  to let him in herself, 'I want to have a little talk with you.'    
'What is it about, Ronald?' Selah asked, with a perfect consciousness  in her own mind of what the subject he wished to discourse about  was likely to be.    
'Why, Selah,' Ronald went on in his quiet, matter-of-fact, unobtrusive  manner, 'do you know, I think we may fairly consider Ernest and  Edie out of danger now.'    
'I hope so, Ronald,' Selah answered imperturbably. 'I've no doubt  your brother'll get along all right in future, and I'm sure at least  that he's getting stronger, for he looks ten per cent. better than  he did three months ago.'    
'Well, Selah!'    
'Well, Ronald!'    
'Why, in that case, you see, your objection falls to the ground.  There can be no possible reason on either side why you should any  longer put off marrying me. We needn't consider Edie now; and you  can't have any reasonable doubt that I want to marry you for your  own sake this time.'    
'What a nuisance the man is!' Selah cried impetuously. 'Always  bothering a body out of her nine senses to go and marry him. Have  you never read what Paul says, that it's good for the unmarried  and widows to abide? He was always dead against the advisability  of marriage, Paul was.'    
'Brother Paul was an able and earnest preacher,' Ronald murmured  gravely, 'from whose authority I should be sorry to dissent except  for sufficient and weighty reason; but you must admit that on this  particular question he was prejudiced, Selah, decidedly prejudiced,  and that the balance of the best opinion goes distinctly the other  way.'    
Selah laughed lightly. 'Oh, does it?' she said, in her provoking,  mocking manner. 'Then you propose to marry me, I suppose, on the  balance of the best Scriptural opinion.'    
'Not at all, Selah,' Ronald replied without a touch of anything  but grave earnestness in his tone--it must be admitted Ronald was  distinctly lacking in the sense of humour. 'Not at all, I assure  you. I propose to marry you because I love you, and I believe in  your heart of hearts you love me, too, you provoking girl, though  you're too proud or too incomprehensible ever to acknowledge it.'    
'And even if I do?' Selah asked. 'What then?'    
'Why, then, Selah,' Ronald answered confidently, taking her hand  boldly in his own and actually kissing her--yes, kissing her; 'why,  then, Selah, suppose we say Monday fortnight?'    
'It's awfully soon,' Selah replied, half grumbling. 'You don't give  a body time to think it over.'    
'Certainly not,' Ronald responded, quickly, taking the handsome  face firmly between his two spare hands, and kissing her lips half  a dozen times over in rapid succession.    
'Let me go, Ronald,' Selah cried, struggling to be free, and trying  in vain to tear down his thin wiry arms with her own strong shapely  hands. 'Let me go at once,--there's a good boy, and I'll marry you  on Monday fortnight, or do anything else you like, just to keep  you quiet. After all, you're a kind-hearted fellow enough, and you  want looking after and taking care of, and if you insist upon it,  I don't mind giving way to you in this small matter.'    
Ronald stepped back a pace or two, and stood looking at her a little  sadly with his hands folded. 'Oh, Selah,' he cried in a tone of  bitter disappointment, 'don't speak like that to me, don't, please.  Don't, don't tell me that you don't really love me--that you're  going to marry me for nothing else but out of mere compassion for  my weakness and helplessness!'    
Selah burst at once into a wild flood of uncontrollable tears: 'Oh,  Ronald,' she cried in her old almost fiercely passionate manner,  flinging her arms around his neck and covering him with kisses;  'Oh, Ronald, how can you ever ask me whether I really really love  you! You know I love you! You know I love you! You've given me back  life and everything that's dear in it, and I never want to live  for anything any longer except to love you, and wait upon you,  and make you happy. I'm stronger than you, Ronald, and I shall be  able to do a little to make you happy, I do believe. My ways are  not your ways, nor my thoughts your thoughts, my darling; but I  love you all the better for that, Ronald, I love you all the better  for that; and if you were to kick me, beat me, trample on me now,  Ronald, I should love you, love you, love you for ever still.'    
So they two were quietly married, with no audience save Ernest and  Edie, on that very Monday fortnight.    
When Herbert Le Breton heard of it from his mother a few days later,  he went home at once to his own eminently cultured home and told  Mrs. Le Breton the news, of course without much detailed allusion  to Selah's earlier antecedents. 'And do you know, Ethel,' he added  significantly, 'I think it was an excellent thing that you decided  not to call after all upon Ernest's wife, for I'm sure it'll be  a great deal safer for you and me to have nothing to say in any  way to the whole faction of them. A greengrocer's daughter, you  know--quite unpresentable. They'll be all mixed up together in  future, which'll make it quite impossible to know the one without  at the same time knowing the other. Now, it'd be just practicable  for you to call upon Mrs. Ernest, I must admit, but to call upon  Mrs. Ronald would be really and truly too inconceivable.'    
At the end of the first year of the 'Social Reformer,' the annual  balance was duly audited, and it showed a very considerable and  solid surplus to go into the pocket of the enterprising Radical  proprietor. Ernest and Herr Max scanned it closely together, and  even Ernest could not refrain from a smile of pleasure when he saw  how thoroughly successful the doubtful venture had finally turned  out. 'And yet,' he said regretfully, as he looked at the heavy  balance-sheet, 'what a strange occupation after all for the author  of "Gold and the Proletariate," to be looking carefully over the  sum-total of a capitalist's final balance! To think, too, that all  that money has come out of the hard-earned scraped-up pennies of  the toiling poor! I often wish, Herr Max, that even so I had been  brought up an honest shoemaker! But whether I'm really earning my  salt at the hands of humanity now or not is a deep problem I often  have many an uncomfortable internal sigh over to this day.'    
'There is work and work, friend Ernest,' Herr Max answered, as gently  as had been his wont in older years; 'and for my part it seems to  me you are better here writing your Social Reformers than making  shoes for a single generation. One man builds for to-day, another  man builds for to-morrow; and he that plants a fruit tree for his  children to eat of is doing as much good work in the world as he  that sows the corn in spring to be reaped and eaten at this autumn's  harvest.'    
'Perhaps so,' Ernest answered softly. 'I wish I could think so.  But after all I'm not quite sure whether, if we had all starved  eighteen months ago together, as seemed so likely then, it wouldn't  have been the most right thing in the end that could possibly have  happened to all of us. As things are constituted now, there seems  only one life that's really worth living for an honest man, and  that's a martyr's. A martyr's or else a worker's. And I, I greatly  fear, have managed somehow to miss being either. The wind carries  us this way and that, and when we would do that which is right, it  drifts us away incontinently into that which is only profitable.'    
'Dear Ernest,' Edie cried in her bright old-fashioned manner from  the ofice door, 'Dot has come in her new frock to bring Daddy home  for her birthday dinner as she was promised. Come quick, or your  little daughter'll be very angry with you. And Lady Hilda Berkeley  has come, too, to drive us back in her own brougham. Now don't  be a silly, there's a dear, or say that you can't drive away from  the office of the "Social Reformer" in Lady Hilda's brougham!'
