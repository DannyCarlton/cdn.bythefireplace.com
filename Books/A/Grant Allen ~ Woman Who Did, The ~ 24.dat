When she returned from Sir Anthony's to her mother's lodgings, she  found Herminia, very pale, in the sitting-room, waiting for her.  Her eyes were fixed on a cherished autotype of a Pinturicchia at  Perugia,--Alan's favorite picture. Out of her penury she had  bought it. It represented the Madonna bending in worship over her  divine child, and bore the inscription: "Quem genuit adoravit."  Herminia loved that group. To her it was no mere emblem of a dying  creed, but a type of the eternal religion of maternity. The Mother  adoring the Child! 'Twas herself and Dolly.    
"Well?" Herminia said interrogatively, as her daughter entered, for  she half feared the worst.    
"Well," Dolores answered in a defiant tone, blurting it out in  sudden jerks, the rebellion of a lifetime finding vent at last.  "I've been to my grandfather, my father's father; and I've told him  everything; and it's all arranged: and I'm to take his name; and  I'm to go and live with him."    
"Dolly!" the mother cried, and fell forward on the table with her  face in her hands. "My child, my child, are you going to leave  me?"    
"It's quite time," Dolly answered, in a sullen, stolid voice. "I  can't stop here, of course, now I'm almost grown up and engaged to  be married, associating any longer with such a woman as you have  been. No right-minded girl who respected herself could do it."    
Herminia rose and faced her. Her white lips grew livid. She had  counted on every element of her martyrdom,--save one; and this, the  blackest and fiercest of all, had never even occurred to her.  "Dolly," she cried, "oh, my daughter, you don't know what you do!  You don't know how I've loved you! I've given up my life for you.  I thought when you came to woman's estate, and learned what was  right and what wrong, you would indeed rise up and call me blessed.  And now,--oh, Dolly, this last blow is too terrible. It will kill  me, my darling. I can't go on out-living it."    
"You will," Dolly answered. "You're strong enough and wiry enough  to outlive anything. . . . But I wrote to Walter from Sir  Anthony's this morning, and told him I would wait for him if I  waited forever. For, of course, while <i>you</i> live, I couldn't think  of marrying him. I couldn't think of burdening an honest man with  such a mother-in-law as you are!"    
Herminia could only utter the one word, "Dolly!" It was a  heart-broken cry, the last despairing cry of a wounded and stricken  creature.
