  In ten seconds, it seemed to Kent, Marette Radisson was again the   splendid creature who had held the three men at bay over the end  of  her little black gun at barracks. The sound of Mooie's second  warning  came at first as a shock. Accompanying it there was a  moment of fear,  of fear driven almost to the point of actual  terror. Following it came  a reaction so swift that Kent was dazed.  Within those ten seconds the  girl's slender body seemed to grow  taller; a new light flamed in her  face; her eyes, turning swiftly  to him, were filled with the same fire  with which they had faced  the three constables. She was unafraid. She  was ready to fight. 
  In such moments as these it was the quiet and dispassionate   composure of her voice that amazed him most. It was musical in its   softness now. Yet in that softness was a hidden thing. It was like   velvet covering steel. She had spoken of Niska, the Gray Goose,  the  goddess of the Three Rivers. And he thought that something of  the  spirit of a goddess must be in Marette Radisson to give her  the  courage with which she faced him, even as the metallic thing  outside  tapped its warning again at the window. 
  &quot;Inspector Kedsty is coming back,&quot; she said. &quot;I did not think he   would do that&#8212;tonight.&quot; 
  &quot;He has not had time to go to barracks,&quot; said Kent. 
  &quot;No. Possibly he has forgotten something. Before he arrives, I   want to show you the nest I have made for you, Jeems. Come  quickly!&quot; 
  It was her first intimation that he was not to remain in her room,   a possibility that had already caused him some inward  embarrassment.  She seized a number of matches, turned down her  light, and hurried  into the hall. Kent followed her to the end of  this hall, where she  paused before a low half-door that apparently  opened into some sort of  a space close under the sloping roof of  the bungalow. 
  &quot;It is an old storeroom,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I have made it quite   comfortable, I think. I have covered the window, so you may light  the  lamp. But you must see that no light shows under this door.  Lock it on  the inside, and be very quiet. For whatever you find in  there you must  thank M'sieu Fingers.&quot; 
  She pulled the door slightly open and gave him the matches. The   illumination in the lower hall made its way only dimly to where  they  stood. In the gloom he found himself close to the soft glow  of her  eyes. His fingers closed about her hand as he took the  matches. 
  &quot;Marette, you believe me?&quot; he entreated. &quot;You believe that I love   you, that I didn't kill John Barkley, that I am going to fight for   you as long as God gives me breath to fight?&quot; 
  For a moment there was silence. Her hand withdrew gently from his. 
  &quot;Yes, I think that I believe. Good-night, Jeems.&quot; 
  She went from him quickly. At her door she turned. &quot;Go in now,   please,&quot; she called back softly. &quot;If you care as you say you do,  go  IN.&quot; 
  She did not wait for his reply. Her own door closed behind her,   and Kent, striking a match, stooped low and entered his hiding-   place. In a moment he saw directly ahead of him a lamp on a box.  He  lighted this, and his first movement then was to close the door  and  turn the key that was in the lock. After that he looked about  him. The  storeroom was not more than ten feet square, and the roof  was so close  over his head that he could not stand upright. It was  not the  smallness of the place that struck him first, but the  preparations  which Marette had made for him. In a corner was a bed  of blankets, and  the rough floor of the place was carpeted with  blankets, except for a  two-or-three-foot space around the edge of  it. Beyond the box was a  table and a chair, and it was the burden  of this table that made his  pulse jump quickest. Marette had not  forgotten that he might grow  hungry. It was laid sumptuously, with  a plate for one, but with food  for half a dozen. There were a  brace of roasted grouse, brown as nuts;  a cold roast of moose meat  or beef; a dish piled high with golden  potato salad; olives,  pickles, an open can of cherries, a loaf of  bread, butter, cheese  &#8212;and one of Kedsty's treasured thermos bottles,  which undoubtedly  held hot coffee or tea. And then he noticed what was  on the chair  &#8212;a belt and holster and a Colt automatic forty-five!  Marette had  not figured on securing a gun in the affair at barracks,  and her  foresight had not forgotten a weapon. She had placed it   conspicuously where he could not fail to see it at once. And just   beyond the chair, on the floor, was a shoulder-pack. It was of the   regulation service sort, partly filled. Resting against the pack  was  a Winchester. He recognized the gun. He had seen it hanging in  Dirty  Fingers' shack. 
  For a matter of five minutes he scarcely moved from where he stood   beside the table. Nothing but an unplastered roof was between him  and  the storm, and over his head the thunder crashed, and the rain  beat in  torrents. He saw where the window was, carefully covered  with a  blanket. Even through the blanket he caught faintly the  illumination  of lightning. This window overlooked the entrance to  Kedsty's  bungalow, and the idea came to him of turning out the  light and  opening it. In darkness he took down the blanket. But  the window  itself was not movable, and after assuring himself of  this fact he  flattened his face against it, peering out into the  chaos of the  night. 
  In that instant came a flare of lightning, and to Kent, looking   down, was revealed a sight that tightened every muscle in his  body.  More vividly than if it had been day he saw a man standing  below in  the deluge. It was not Mooie. It was not Kedsty. It was  no one that he  had ever seen. Even more like a ghost than a man  was that apparition  of the lightning flare. A great, gaunt giant  of a ghost, bare-headed,  with long, dripping hair and a long,  storm-twisted beard. The picture  shot to his brain with the  swiftness of the lightning itself. It was  like the sudden throwing  of a cinema picture on a screen. Then  blackness shut it out. Kent  stared harder. He waited. 
  Again came the lightning, and again he saw that tragic, ghost-like   figure waiting in the storm. Three times he saw it. And he knew  that  the mysterious, bearded giant was an old man. The fourth time  the  lightning came, the figure was gone. And in that flare it was  the  bowed figure of Kedsty he saw hurrying up the gravel path to  the door. 
  Quickly Kent covered the window, but he did not relight the lamp.   Before Kedsty could have reached the foot of the stair, he had   unlocked the door. Cautiously he opened it three or four inches  and  sat down with his back against the wall, listening. He heard  Kedsty  pass through into the big room where Marette had waited for  him a  short time before. After that there was silence except for  the tumult  of the storm. 
  For an hour Kent listened. In all that time he did not hear a   sound from the lower hall or from Marette's room. He wondered if  she  was sleeping, and if Kedsty had gone to bed, waiting for  morning  before he set in action his bloodhounds of the law. 
  Kent had no intention of disturbing the comfortable looking bed of   blankets. He was not only sleepless, but filled with a premonition  of  events about to happen. He felt impinging itself more and more  upon  him a sense of watchfulness. That Inspector Kedsty and  Marette  Radisson were under the same roof, and that there was some  potent and  mysterious reason which kept Kedsty from betraying the  girl's  presence, was the thought which troubled him most. He was  not  developing further the plans for his own escape. 
  He was thinking of Marette. What was her power over Kedsty? Why   was it that Kedsty would like to see her dead? Why was she in his   house? Again and again he asked himself the questions and found no   answers to them. And yet, even in this purgatory of mystery that   environed him, he felt himself happier than he had ever been in  his  life. For Marette was not four or five hundred miles down the  river.  She was in the same house with him. And he had told her  that he loved  her. He was glad that he had been given courage to  let her know that.  He relighted the lamp, and opened his watch and  placed it on the  table, where frequently he could look at the  time. He wanted to smoke  his pipe, but the odor of tobacco, he was  sure, would reach Kedsty,  unless the Inspector had actually  retired into his bedroom for the  night. 
  Half a dozen times he questioned himself as to the identity of the   ghostly apparition he had seen in the lightning flare of the  storm.  Perhaps it was some one of Fingers' strange friends from  out of the  wilderness, Mooie's partner in watching the bungalow.  The picture of  that giant of a man with his great beard and long  hair, as his eyes  had caught him in a sea of electrical fire, was  indelibly burned into  his brain. It was a tragic picture. 
  Again he put out the light and bared the blanketed window, but he   saw nothing but the sodden gleam of the earth when the lightning   flashed. A second time he opened the door a few inches and sat  down  with his back to the wall, listening. 
  How long it was before drowsiness stole upon him he did not know,   but it came, and for a few moments at a time, as his eyes closed,  it  robbed him of his caution. And then, for a space, he slept. A  sound  brought him suddenly into wide wakefulness. His first  impression was  that the sound had been a cry. For a moment or two,  as his senses  adjusted themselves, he was not sure. Then swiftly  the thing grew upon  him. 
  He rose to his feet and widened the crack of his door. A bar of   light shot across the upper hall. It was from Marette's room. He  had  taken off his boots to deaden the sound of his feet, and he  stepped  outside his door. He was positive he heard a low cry, a  choking,  sobbing cry, only barely audible, and that it came from  down the  stair. 
  No longer hesitating, he moved quickly to Marette's room and   looked in. His first glimpse was of the bed. It had not been used.   The room was empty. 
  Something cold and chilling gripped at his heart, and an impulse   which he no longer made an effort to resist pulled him to the head  of  the stair. It was more than an impulse&#8212;it was a demand. Step  by step  he went down, his hand on the butt of his Colt. 
  He reached the lower hall, which was still lighted, and a step or   two brought him to a view of the door that opened into the big   living-room beyond. That door was partly open, and the room itself   was filled with light. Soundlessly Kent approached. He looked in. 
  What he saw first brought him relief together with shock. At one   end of the long desk table over which hung a great brass lamp  stood  Marette. She was in profile to him. He could not see her  face. Her  hair fell loose about her, glowing like a rich, sable  cape in the  light of the lamp. She was safe, alive, and yet the  attitude of her as  she looked down was the thing that gave him  shock. He was compelled to  move a few inches more before he could  see what she was staring at.  And then his heart stopped dead  still. 
  Huddled down in his chair, with his head flung back so that the   terrible ghastliness of his face fronted Kent, was Kedsty. And  Kent,  in an instant, knew. Only a dead man could look like that. 
  With a cry he entered the room. Marette did not start, but an   answering cry came into her throat as she turned her eyes from  Kedsty  to him. To Kent it was like looking upon the dead in two  ways. Marette  Radisson, living and breathing, was whiter than  Kedsty, who was white  with the unbreathing pallor of the actually  dead. She did not speak.  She made no sound after that answering  cry in her throat. She simply  looked. And Kent spoke her name  gently as he saw her great, wide eyes  blazing dully their agony  and despair. Then, like one stunned and  fascinated, she stared  down upon Kedsty again. 
  Every instinct of the man-hunter became alive in Kent's brain as   he, too, turned toward the Inspector of Police. Kedsty's arms hung   limp over the side of his chair. On the floor under his right hand   was his Colt automatic. His head was strained so far over the back  of  the chair that it looked as though his neck had been broken. On  his  forehead, close up against his short-cropped, iron-gray hair,  was a  red stain. 
  Kent approached and bent over him. He had seen death too many   times not to recognize it now, but seldom had he seen a face  twisted  and distorted as Kedsty's was. His eyes were open and  bulging in a  glassy stare. His jaws hung loose. His&#8212; 
  It was then Kent's blood froze in his veins. Kedsty had received a   blow, but it was not the blow that had killed him. Afterward he  had  been choked to death. And the thing that had choked him was a  TRESS OF  WOMAN'S HAIR. 
  In the seconds that followed that discovery Kent could not have   moved if his own life had paid the penalty of inaction. For the  story  was told&#8212;there about Kedsty's throat and on his chest. The  tress of  hair was long and soft and shining and black. It was  twisted twice  around Kedsty's neck, and the loose end rippled down  over his  shoulder, GLOWING LIKE A BIT OF RICH SABLE IN THE  LAMPLIGHT. It was  that thought of velvety sable that had come to  him at the doorway,  looking at Marette. It was the thought that  came to him now. He  touched it; he took it in his fingers; he  unwound it from about  Kedsty's neck, where it had made two deep  rings in the flesh. From his  fingers it rippled out full length.  And he turned slowly and faced  Marette Radisson. 
  Never had human eyes looked at him as she was looking at him now.   She reached out a hand, her lips mute, and Kent gave her the tress  of  hair. And the next instant she turned, with a hand clasped at  her own  throat, and passed through the door. 
  After that he heard her going unsteadily up the stairs.
