  Langdon and Bruce crossed the summit into the westward valley in the  afternoon of the day Thor left the clay wallow. It was two o'clock when  Bruce turned back for the three horses, leaving Langdon on a high ridge  to scour the surrounding country through his glasses. For two hours  after the packer returned with the outfit they followed slowly along  the creek above which the grizzly had travelled, and when they camped  for the night they were still two or three miles from the spot where  Thor came upon Muskwa. They had not yet found his tracks in the sand of  the creek bottom. Yet Bruce was confident. He knew that Thor had been  following the crests of the slopes.
  &#8220;If you go back out of this country an' write about bears, don't  make a fool o' yo'rself like most of the writin' fellows, Jimmy,&#8221; he  said, as they sat back to smoke their pipes after supper. &#8220;Two years  ago I took a natcherlist out for a month, an' he was so tickled he said  'e'd send me a bunch o' books about bears an' wild things. He did! I  read 'em. I laughed at first, an' then I got mad an' made a fire of  'em. Bears is cur'ous. There's a mighty lot of interestin' things to  say about 'em without making a fool o' yo'rself. There sure is!&#8221;
  Langdon nodded.
  &#8220;One has to hunt and kill and hunt and kill for years before he  discovers the real pleasure in big game stalking,&#8221; he said slowly,  looking into the fire. &#8220;And when he comes down to that real pleasure,  the part of it that absorbs him heart and soul, he finds that after all  the big thrill isn't in killing, but in letting live. I want this  grizzly, and I'm going to have him. I won't leave the mountains until I  kill him. But, on the other hand, we could have killed two other bears  to-day, and I didn't take a shot. I'm learning the game, Bruce&#8212;I'm  beginning to taste the real pleasure of hunting. And when one hunts in  the right way one learns facts. You needn't worry. I'm going to put  only facts in what I write.&#8221;
  Suddenly he turned and looked at Bruce.
  &#8220;What were some of the 'fool things' you read in those books?&#8221; he  asked.
  Bruce blew out a cloud of smoke reflectively.
  &#8220;What made me maddest,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was what those writer fellows said  about bears havin' 'marks.' Good Lord, accordin' to what they said all  a bear has to do is stretch 'imself up, put a mark on a tree, and that  country is his'n until a bigger bear comes along an' licks 'im. In one  book I remember where a grizzly rolled a log up under a tree so he  could stand on it an' put his mark above another grizzly's mark. Think  of that!
  &#8220;No bear makes a mark that means anything. I've seen grizzlies bite  hunks out o' trees an' scratch 'em just as a cat might, an' in the  summer when they get itchy an' begin to lose their hair they stand up  an' rub against trees. They rub because they itch an' not because  they're leavin' their cards for other bears. Caribou an' moose an' deer  do the same thing to get the velvet off their horns.
  &#8220;Them same writers think every grizzly has his own range, an' they  don't&#8212;not by a long shot they don't! I've seen eight full-grown  grizzlies feedin' on the same slide! You remember, two years ago, we  shot four grizzlies in a little valley that wasn't a mile long. Now an'  then there's a boss among grizzlies, like this fellow we're after, but  even he ain't got his range alone. I'll bet there's twenty other bears  in these two valleys! An' that natcherlist I had two years ago couldn't  tell a grizzly's track from a black bear's track, an so 'elp me if he  knew what a cinnamon was!&#8221;
  He took his pipe from his mouth and spat truculently into the fire,  and Langdon knew that other things were coming. His richest hours were  those when the usually silent Bruce fell into these moods.
  &#8220;A cinnamon!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;Think of that, Jimmy&#8212;he thought there  were such a thing as a cinnamon bear! An' when I told him there wasn't,  an' that the cinnamon bear you read about is a black or a grizzly of a  cinnamon colour, he laughed at me&#8212;an' there I was born an' brung up  among bears! His eyes fair popped when I told him about the colour o'  bears, an' he thought I was feedin' him rope. I figgered afterward  mebby that was why he sent me the books. He wanted to show me he was  right.
  &#8220;Jimmy, there ain't anything on earth that's got more colours than a  bear! I've seen black bears as white as snow, an' I've seen grizzlies  almost as black as a black bear. I've seen cinnamon black bears an'  I've seen cinnamon grizzlies, an' I've seen browns an' golds an'  almost-yellows of both kinds. They're as different in colour as they  are in their natchurs an' way of eatin'.
  &#8220;I figger most natcherlists go out an' get acquainted with one  grizzly, an' then they write up all grizzlies accordin' to that one.  That ain't fair to the grizzlies, darned if it is! There wasn't one of  them books that didn't say the grizzly wasn't the fiercest,  man-eatingest cuss alive. He ain't&#8212;unless you corner 'im. He's as  cur'ous as a kid, an' he's good-natured if you don't bother 'im. Most  of 'em are vegetarians, but some of 'em ain't. I've seen grizzlies pull  down goat an' sheep an' caribou, an' I've seen other grizzlies feed on  the same slides with them animals an' never make a move toward them.  They're cur'ous, Jimmy. There's lots you can say about 'em without  makin' a fool o' yourself!&#8221;
  Bruce beat the ash out of his pipe as an emphasis to his final  remark. As he reloaded with fresh tobacco, Langdon said:
  &#8220;You can make up your mind this big fellow we are after is a  game-killer, Bruce.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can't tell,&#8221; replied Bruce. &#8220;Size don't always tell. I knew a  grizzly once that wasn't much bigger'n a dog, an' he was a game-killer.  Hundreds of animals are winter-killed in these mount'ins every year,  an' when spring comes the bears eat the carcasses; but old flesh don't  make game-killers. Sometimes it's born in a grizzly to be a killer, an'  sometimes he becomes a killer by chance. If he kills once, he'll kill  again.
  &#8220;Once I was on the side of a mount'in an' saw a goat walk straight  into the face of a grizzly. The bear wasn't going to make a move, but  the goat was so scared it ran plump into the old fellow, and he killed  it. He acted mighty surprised for ten minutes afterward, an' he sniffed  an' nosed around the warm carcass for half an hour before he tore it  open. That was his first taste of what you might call live game. I  didn't kill him, an' I'm sure from that day on he was a big-game  hunter.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should think size would have something to do with it,&#8221; argued  Langdon. &#8220;It seems to me that a bear which eats flesh would be bigger  and stronger than if he was a vegetarian.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's one o' the cur'ous things you want to write about,&#8221; replied  Bruce, with one of his odd chuckles. &#8220;Why is it a bear gets so fat he  can hardly walk along in September when he don't feed on much else but  berries an' ants an' grubs? Would you get fat on wild currants?
  &#8220;An' why does he grow so fast during the four or five months he's  denned up an' dead to the world without a mouthful to eat or drink?
  &#8220;Why is it that for a month, an' sometimes two months, the mother  gives her cubs milk while she's still what you might call asleep? Her  nap ain't much more'n two-thirds over when the cubs are born.
  &#8220;And why ain't them cubs bigger'n they are? That natcherlist laughed  until I thought he'd split when I told him a grizzly bear cub wasn't  much bigger'n a house-cat kitten when born!&#8221;
  &#8220;He was one of the few fools who aren't willing to learn&#8212;and yet  you cannot blame him altogether,&#8221; said Langdon. &#8220;Four or five years ago  I wouldn't have believed it, Bruce. I couldn't actually believe it  until we dug out those cubs up the Athabasca&#8212;one weighed eleven ounces  and the other nine. You remember?&#8221;
  &#8220;An' they were a week old, Jimmy. An' the mother weighed eight  hundred pounds.&#8221;
  For a few moments they both puffed silently on their pipes.
  &#8220;Almost&#8212;inconceivable,&#8221; said Langdon then. &#8220;And yet it's true. And  it isn't a freak of nature, Bruce&#8212;it's simply a result of Nature's  far-sightedness. If the cubs were as large comparatively as a  house-cat's kittens the mother-bear could not sustain them during those  weeks when she eats and drinks nothing herself. There seems to be just  one flaw in this scheme: an ordinary black bear is only about half as  large as a grizzly, yet a black bear cub when born is much larger than  a grizzly cub. Now why the devil that should be&#8212;&#8221;
  Bruce interrupted his friend with a good-natured laugh.
  &#8220;That's easy&#8212;easy, Jimmy!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Do you remember last year  when we picked strawberries in the valley an' threw snowballs two hours  later up on the mountain? Higher you climb the colder it gets, don't  it? Right now&#8212;first day of July&#8212;you'd half freeze up on some of those  peaks! A grizzly dens high, Jimmy, and a black bear dens low. When the  snow is four feet deep up where the grizzly dens, the black bear can  still feed in the deep valleys an' thick timber. He goes to bed mebby a  week or two weeks later than the grizzly, an' he gets up in the spring  a week or two weeks earlier; he's fatter when he dens up an' he ain't  so poor when he comes out&#8212;an' so the mother's got more strength to  give to her cubs. It looks that way to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've hit the nail on the head as sure as you're a year old!&#8221;  cried Langdon enthusiastically. &#8220;Bruce, I never thought of that!&#8221;
  &#8220;There's a good many things you don't think about until you run  across 'em,&#8221; said the mountaineer. &#8220;It's what you said a while  ago&#8212;such things are what makes huntin' a fine sport when you've  learned huntin' ain't always killin'&#8212;but lettin' live. One day I lay  seven hours on a mountain-top watchin' a band o' sheep at play, an' I  had more fun than if I'd killed the whole bunch.&#8221;
  Bruce rose to his feet and stretched himself, an after-supper  operation that always preceded his announcement that he was going to  turn in.
  &#8220;Fine day to-morrow,&#8221; he said, yawning. &#8220;Look how white the snow is  on the peaks.&#8221;
  &#8220;Bruce&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221;
  &#8220;How heavy is this bear we're after?&#8221;
  &#8220;Twelve hundred pounds&#8212;mebby a little more. I didn't have the  pleasure of lookin' at him so close as you did, Jimmy. If I had we'd  been dryin' his skin now!&#8221;
  &#8220;And he's in his prime?&#8221;
  &#8220;Between eight and twelve years old, I'd say, by the way he went up  the slope. An old bear don't roll so easy.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've run across some pretty old bears, Bruce?&#8221;
  &#8220;So old some of 'em needed crutches,&#8221; said Bruce, unlacing his  boots. &#8220;I've shot bears so old they'd lost their teeth.&#8221;
  &#8220;How old?&#8221;
  &#8220;Thirty&#8212;thirty-five&#8212;mebby forty years. Good-night, Jimmy!&#8221;
  &#8220;Good-night, Bruce!&#8221;
  Langdon was awakened some time hours later by a deluge of rain that  brought him out of his blankets with a yell to Bruce. They had not put  up their tepee, and a moment later he heard Bruce anathematizing their  idiocy. The night was as black as a cavern, except when it was broken  by lurid flashes of lightning, and the mountains rolled and rumbled  with deep thunder. Disentangling himself from his drenched blanket,  Langdon stood up. A glare of lightning revealed Bruce sitting in his  blankets, his hair dripping down over his long, lean face, and at sight  of him Langdon laughed outright.
  [Illustration: &#8220;They headed up the creek-bottom, bending over from  their saddles to look at every strip of sand they passed for tracks.  They had not gone a quarter of a mile when Bruce gave a sudden  exclamation and stopped.&#8221;]
  &#8220;Fine day to-morrow,&#8221; he taunted, repeating Bruce's words of a few  hours before. &#8220;Look how white the snow is on the peaks!&#8221;
  Whatever Bruce said was drowned in a crash of thunder.
  Langdon waited for another lightning flash and then dove for the  shelter of a thick balsam. Under this he crouched for five or ten  minutes, when the rain stopped as suddenly as it had begun. The thunder  rolled southward, and the lightning went with it. In the darkness he  heard Bruce fumbling somewhere near. Then a match was lighted, and he  saw his comrade looking at his watch.
  &#8220;Pretty near three o'clock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nice shower, wasn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I rather expected it,&#8221; replied Langdon carelessly. &#8220;You know,  Bruce, whenever the snow on the peaks is so white&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Shut up&#8212;an' let's get a fire! Good thing we had sense enough to  cover our grub with the blankets. Are yo' wet?&#8221;
  Langdon was wringing the water from his hair. He felt like a drowned  rat.
  &#8220;No. I was under a thick balsam, and prepared for it. When you  called my attention to the whiteness of the snow on the peaks I knew&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Forget the snow,&#8221; growled Bruce, and Langdon could hear him  breaking off dry pitch-filled twigs under a spruce.
  He went to help him, and five minutes later they had a fire going.  The light illumined their faces, and each saw that the other was not  unhappy. Bruce was grinning under his sodden hair.
  &#8220;I was dead asleep when it came,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;An' I thought I'd  fallen in a lake. I woke up tryin' to swim.&#8221;
  An early July rain at three o'clock in the morning in the northern  British Columbia mountains is not as warm as it might be, and for the  greater part of an hour Langdon and Bruce continued to gather fuel and  dry their blankets and clothing. It was five o'clock before they had  breakfast, and a little after six when they started with their two  saddles and single pack up the valley. Bruce had the satisfaction of  reminding Langdon that his prediction had come true for a glorious day  followed the thunder shower.
  Under them the meadows were dripping. The valley purred louder with  the music of the swollen streamlets. From the mountain-tops a half of  last night's snow was gone, and to Langdon the flowers seemed taller  and more beautiful. The air that drifted through the valley was laden  with the sweetness and freshness of the morning, and over and through  it all the sun shone in a warm and golden sea.
  They headed up the creek-bottom, bending over from their saddles to  look at every strip of sand they passed for tracks. They had not gone a  quarter of a mile when Bruce gave a sudden exclamation, and stopped. He  pointed to a round patch of sand in which Thor had left one of his huge  footprints. Langdon dismounted and measured it.
  &#8220;It's he!&#8221; he cried, and there was a thrill of excitement in his  voice. &#8220;Hadn't we better go on without the horses, Bruce?&#8221;
  The mountaineer shook his head. But before he voiced an opinion he  got down from his horse and scanned the sides of the mountains ahead of  them through his long telescope. Langdon used his double-barrelled  hunting glass. They discovered nothing.
  &#8220;He's still in the creek-bottom, an' he's probably three or four  miles ahead,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;We'll ride on a couple o' miles an' find a  place good for the horses. The grass an' bushes will be dry then.&#8221;
  It was easy to follow Thor's course after this, for he had hung  close to the creek. Within three or four hundred yards of the great  mass of boulders where the grizzly had come upon the tan-faced cub was  a small copse of spruce in the heart of a grassy dip, and here the  hunters stripped and hobbled their horses. Twenty minutes later they  had come up cautiously to the soft carpet of sand where Thor and Muskwa  had become acquainted. The heavy rain had obliterated the cub's tiny  footprints, but the sand was cut up by the grizzly's tracks. The  packer's teeth gleamed as he looked at Langdon.
  &#8220;He ain't very far,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Shouldn't wonder if he spent the  night pretty close an' he's mooshing on just ahead of us.&#8221;
  He wet a finger and held it above his head to get the wind. He  nodded significantly.
  &#8220;We'd better get up on the slopes,&#8221; he said.
  They made their way around the end of the boulders, holding their  guns in readiness, and headed for a small coulee that promised an easy  ascent of the first slope. At the mouth of this both paused again. Its  bottom was covered with sand, and in this sand were the tracks of  another bear. Bruce dropped on his knees.
  &#8220;It's another grizzly,&#8221; said Langdon.
  &#8220;No, it ain't; it's a black,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;Jimmy, can't I ever knock  into yo'r head the difference between a black an' a grizzly track? This  is the hind foot, an' the heel is round. If it was a grizzly it would  be pointed. An' it's too broad an' clubby f'r a grizzly, an' the claws  are too long f'r the length of the foot. It's a black as plain as the  nose on yo'r face!&#8221;
  &#8220;And going our way,&#8221; said Langdon. &#8220;Come on!&#8221; Two hundred yards up  the coulee the bear had climbed out on the slope. Langdon and Bruce  followed. In the thick grass and hard shale of the first crest of the  slope the tracks were quickly lost, but the hunters were not much  interested in these tracks now. From the height at which they were  travelling they had a splendid view below them.
  Not once did Bruce take his eyes from the creek bottom. He knew that  it was down there they would find the grizzly, and he was interested in  nothing else just at present. Langdon, on the other hand, was  interested in everything that might be living or moving about them;  every mass of rock and thicket of thorn held possibilities for him, and  his eyes were questing the higher ridges and the peaks as well as their  immediate trail. It was because of this that he saw something which  made him suddenly grip his companion's arm and pull him down beside him  on the ground.
  &#8220;Look!&#8221; he whispered, stretching out an arm.
  From his kneeling posture Bruce stared. His eyes fairly popped in  amazement. Not more than thirty feet above them was a big rock shaped  like a dry-goods box, and protruding from behind the farther side of  this rock was the rear half of a bear. It was a black bear, its glossy  coat shining in the sunlight. For a full half minute Bruce continued to  stare. Then he grinned.
  &#8220;Asleep&#8212;dead asleep! Jimmy&#8212;you want to see some fun?&#8221;
  He put down his gun and drew out his long hunting knife. He chuckled  softly as he felt of its keen point.
  &#8220;If you never saw a bear run yo'r goin' to see one run now, Jimmy!  You stay here!&#8221;
  He began crawling slowly and quietly up the slope toward the rock,  while Langdon held his breath in anticipation of what was about to  happen. Twice Bruce looked back, and he was grinning broadly. There was  undoubtedly going to be a very much astonished bear racing for the tops  of the Rocky Mountains in another moment or two, and between this  thought and the picture of Bruce's long lank figure snaking its way  upward foot by foot the humour of the situation fell upon Langdon.  Finally Bruce reached the rock. The long knife-blade gleamed in the  sun; then it shot forward and a half inch of steel buried itself in the  bear's rump. What followed in the next thirty seconds Langdon would  never forget. The bear made no movement. Bruce jabbed again. Still  there was no movement, and at the second thrust Bruce remained as  motionless as the rock against which he was crouching, and his mouth  was wide open as he stared down at Langdon.
  &#8220;Now what the devil do you think of that?&#8221; he said, and rose slowly  to his feet. &#8220;He ain't asleep&#8212;he's dead!&#8221;
  Langdon ran up to him, and they went around the end of the rock.  Bruce still held the knife in his hand and there was an odd expression  in his face&#8212;a look that put troubled furrows between his eyes as he  stood for a moment without speaking.
  &#8220;I never see anything like that before,&#8221; he said, slowly slipping  his knife in its sheath. &#8220;It's a she-bear, an' she had cubs&#8212;pretty  young cubs, too, from the looks o' her.'
  &#8220;She was after a whistler, and undermined the rock,&#8221; added Langdon.  &#8220;Crushed to death, eh, Bruce?&#8221;
  Bruce nodded.
  &#8220;I never see anything like it before,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I've wondered  why they didn't get killed by diggin' under the rocks&#8212;but I never see  it. Wonder where the cubs are? Poor little devils!&#8221;
  He was on his knees examining the dead mother's teats.
  &#8220;She didn't have more'n two&#8212;mebby one,&#8221; he said, rising. &#8220;About  three months old.&#8221;
  &#8220;And they'll starve?&#8221;
  &#8220;If there was only one he probably will. The little cuss had so much  milk he didn't have to forage for himself. Cubs is a good deal like  babies&#8212;you can wean 'em early or you can ha'f grow 'em on pap. An'  this is what comes of runnin' off an' leavin' your babies alone,&#8221;  moralized Bruce. &#8220;If you ever git married, Jimmy, don't you let yo'r  wife do it. Sometimes th' babies burn up or break their necks!&#8221;
  Again he turned along the crest of the slope, his eyes once more  searching the valley, and Langdon followed a step behind him, wondering  what had become of the cub.
  And Muskwa, still slumbering on the rock-ledge with Thor, was  dreaming of the mother who lay crushed under the rock on the slope, and  as he dreamed he whimpered softly.
