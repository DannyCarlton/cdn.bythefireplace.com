  Soon Philip slackened his pace, and looked anxiously ahead of him.   From where he stood the cliff sloped down to a white strip of  beach  that reached out into the night as far as he could see,  hemmed close  in by the black gloom of the forest. Half-way down  the slope the  moonlight was cut by a dark streak, and he found  this to be the second  break. He had no difficulty in descending.  Its sides were smooth, as  though worn by water. At the bottom  white, dry sand slipped under his  feet. He made his way between  the walls, and darkness shut him in. The  trail grew rougher. Near  the shore he stumbled blindly among huge  rocks and piles of  crumbling slate, wondering why Jeanne and Pierre  had come this way  when they might have taken a smoother road. Close to  the stony  beach, where the light was a little better, he made out the  canoe  which Pierre had drawn into the shadows. 
  Not until he had dragged it into the moonlight at the edge of the   water did he see that it was equipped as if for a long journey.  Close  to the stern was a bulging pack, with a rifle strapped  across it. Two  or three smaller caribou-skin bags lay in the  center of the canoe. In  the bow was a thick nest of bearskin, and  he knew that this was for  Jeanne. 
  Cautiously Philip launched himself, and with silent sweeps of the   paddle that made scarcely the sound of a ripple in the water set  out  in the direction of Churchill. Jeanne's captors had a  considerable  start of him, but he felt confident of his ability to  overtake them  shortly if Pierre had spoken with truth when he said  that they would  head for the Churchill River. He had observed the  caution with which  Pierre's assailants had approached the cliff,  and he was sure that  they would double that caution in their  return, especially as their  attack had been interrupted at the  last moment. For this reason he  paddled without great haste,  keeping well within the concealment of  the precipitous shore, with  his ears and eyes keenly alive to discover  a sign of those who  were ahead of him. 
  Opposite the rock where Pierre and Jeanne were to have met him he   stopped and stood up in the canoe. The wind had dispelled the  smoke  shadow. Between him and the distant ship lay an unclouded  sea.  Two-thirds of the distance to the vessel he made out the  larger canoe,  rising and falling with the smooth undulations of  the tide. He sank  upon his knees again and unstrapped Pierre's  rifle. There was a  cartridge in the chamber. He made sure that the  magazine was loaded,  and resumed his paddling. 
  His mind worked rapidly. Within half an hour, if he desired, he   could overtake the other canoe. And what then? There were three to   one, if it came to a fight&#8212;and how could he rescue Jeanne without  a  fight? His blood was pounding eagerly, almost with pleasure at  the  promise of what was ahead of him, and he laughed softly to  himself as  he thought of the odds. 
  The ship loomed nearer; the canoe vanished behind it. A brief   stop, a dozen words of explanation, and Philip knew that he could   secure assistance from the vessel. After all, would that not be  the  wisest course for him to pursue? For a moment he hesitated,  and  paddled more slowly. If others joined with him in the rescue  of Jeanne  what excuse could he offer for not bringing her back to  Churchill?  What would happen if he returned with her? Why had  Pierre roused  himself from something that was almost death to  entreat him to take  Jeanne to Fort o' God? 
  At the thought of Fort o' God a new strength leaped into his arms   and body, urging him on to cope with the situation single-handed.  If  he rescued Jeanne alone, and went on with her as he had  promised  Pierre, many things that were puzzling him would be  explained. It  occurred to him again that Jeanne and Pierre might  be the key to the  mysterious plot that promised to crash out the  life of the enterprise  he had founded in the north. He found  reasons for this belief. Why had  Lord Fitzhugh's name had such a  startling effect upon Pierre? Why was  one of his assailants a man  fresh from the London ship that had borne  Eileen Brokaw and her  father as passengers? He felt that Jeanne could  explain these  things, as well as her brother. She could explain the  strange  scene on the pier, when for a moment she had stood crushed and   startled before Eileen. She could clear up the mystery of  Gregson's  sketch, for if there were two Eileen Brokaws, Jeanne  would know. With  these arguments he convinced himself that he  should go on alone. Yet,  behind them there was another and more  powerful motive. He confessed  to himself that he would willingly  accept double the chances against  him to achieve Jeanne's rescue  without assistance and to accompany her  to Fort o' God. The  thought of their being together, of the girl's  companionship&#8212;  perhaps for days&#8212;thrilled him with exquisite  anticipation. An  hour or so ago he had been satisfied in the assurance  that he  would see her for a few minutes on the cliff. Since then fate  had  played his way. Jeanne was his own, to save, to defend, to carry   on to Fort o' God. 
  Not for a moment did he hesitate at the danger ahead of him, and   yet his pursuit was filled with caution. Gregson, the diplomat,  would  have seen the necessity of halting at the ship for help;  Philip was  confident in himself. He knew that he would have at  least three  against him, for he was satisfied that the man whom he  had wounded on  the cliff was still in fighting trim. There might  be others whom he  had not taken into account. 
  He passed so close under the stern of the ship that his canoe   scraped against her side. For a few minutes the vessel had  obstructed  his view, but now he saw again, a quarter of a mile  distant, the craft  which he was pursuing. Jeanne's captors were  heading straight for the  river, and as the canoe was now partly  broadside to him he could  easily make out the figures in her, but  not distinctly enough to make  sure of their number. He shoved out  boldly into the moonlight, and,  instead of following in his former  course, he turned at a sharp angle  in the direction of the shore.  If the others saw him, which was  probable, they would think that  he was making a landing from the ship.  Once he was in the deep  fringe of shadow along the shore he could  redouble his exertions  and draw nearer to them without being observed. 
  No sooner had he readied the sheltering gloom than he bent to his   paddle and the light birch-bark fairly hissed through the water.  Not  until he found himself abreast of the pursued did it occur to  him that  he could beat them out to the mouth of the Churchill and  lie in wait  for them. Every stroke of his paddle widened the  distant between him  and the larger canoe. Fifteen minutes later he  reached the edge of the  huge delta of wild rice and reeds through  which the sluggish volume of  the river emptied into the Bay. The  chances were that the approaching  canoe would take the nearest  channel into the main stream, and Philip  concealed himself so that  it would have to pass within twenty yards of  him. 
  From his ambuscade he looked out upon the approaching canoe. He   was puzzled by the slowness of its progress. At times it seemed to   stand still, and he could distinguish no movement at all among its   occupants. At first he thought they were undecided as to which  course  to pursue, but a few minutes more sufficed to show that  this was not  the reason for their desultory advance. The canoe was  headed for the  first channel. The solution came when a low but  clear whistle signaled  over the water. Almost instantly there came  a responsive whistle from  up the channel. 
  Philip drew a quick breath, and a new sensation brought his teeth   together in sudden perplexity. It looked as though he had a bigger   fight before him than he had anticipated. 
  At the signal from up-stream he heard the quick dip of paddles,   and the canoe cut swiftly toward him. He drew back the hammer of   Pierre's rule, and cleared a little space through the reeds and  grass  so that his view into the channel was unobstructed. Three or  four  well-directed shots, a quick dash out into the stream, and  he would  possess Jeanne. This was his first thought. It was  followed by others,  rapid as lightning, that restrained his  eagerness. The night-glow was  treacherous to shoot by. What if he  should miss, or hit Jeanne&#8212;or in  the sudden commotion and  destruction of his shots the canoe should be  overturned? A single  error, the slightest mishap to himself, would  mean the  annihilation of his hopes. Even if he succeeded in directing  his  shots with accuracy, both himself and Jeanne would almost   immediately be under fire from those above. 
  He dropped back again behind the screen of reeds. The canoe drew   nearer. A moment more and it was almost abreast of him, and his  heart  pounded like a swiftly beating hammer when he saw Jeanne in  the stern.  She was leaning back as though unconscious. He could  see nothing of  her face, but as the canoe passed within ten yards  of his hiding-place  he saw the dark glow of her disheveled hair,  which fell thickly over  the object against which she was resting.  It was but a moment's view,  and they were gone. He had not looked  at the three men in the canoe.  His whole being was centered upon  Jeanne. He had seen no sign of  life&#8212;no movement in her body, not  the flutter of a hand, and all his  fears leaped like brands of  burning fire into his brain. He thought of  the inhuman plot which  Lord Fitzhugh's letter had revealed; in the  same breath Pierre  Couchee's words rang in his ears&#8212;&quot;It is  death&#8212;worse than death  &#8212;for her&#8212;&quot; 
  Was Jeanne the first victim of that diabolical scheme to awaken   the wrath of the northland? In the madness which possessed him now   Philip shoved out his canoe while there was still danger of   discovery. Fortunately none of the pursued glanced back, and a  turn  in the channel soon hid them from view. Philip had recovered  his  self-possession by the time he reached the turn. He assured  himself  that Jeanne was unharmed as yet, and that when he saw her  she had  probably fainted from excitement and terror. Her fate  still lay before  her, somewhere in the deep and undisturbed  forests up the Churchill.  His one hope was to remain undiscovered  and to rescue her at the last  moment when she was taken ashore by  her captors. 
  He followed, close up against the reeds, never trusting himself   out of the shadows. After a little he heard voices, and a second   canoe appeared. There was a short pause, and the two canoes  continued  side by side up the channel. A quarter of an hour  brought both the  pursuers and the pursued into the main stream,  which lay in black  gloom between forest walls that cut out all  light but the shimmer of  the stars. 
  No longer could Philip see those ahead of him, but he guided   himself by occasional voices and the dip of paddles. At times,  when  the stream narrowed and the forest walls gave him deeper  shelter, he  drew perilously near with the hope of overhearing what  was said, but  he caught only an occasional word or two. He  listened in vain for  Jeanne's voice. Once he heard her name  spoken, and it was followed by  a low laugh from some one in the  canoe that had waited at the mouth of  the Churchill. A dozen times  during the first half-hour after they  entered the main stream  Philip heard this same laughing voice. 
  After a time there fell a silence upon those ahead. No sound rose   above the steady dip of paddles, and the speed of the two canoes   increased. Suddenly, from far up the river, there came a voice,   faintly at first, but growing steadily louder, singing one of the   wild half-breed songs of the forest. The voice broke the silence  of  those in the canoes. They ceased paddling, and Philip stopped.  He  heard low words, and after a few moments the paddling was  resumed, and  the canoes turned in toward the shore. Philip  followed their movement,  dropping fifty yards farther down the  stream, and thrust big  birch-bark alongside a thick balsam that  had fallen into the river. 
  The singing voice approached rapidly. Five minutes later a long   company canoe floated down out of the gloom. It passed so near  that  Philip could see the picturesque figure in the stern paddling  and  singing. In the bow kneeled an Indian working in stoic  silence.  Between them, in the body of the canoe, sat two men whom  he knew at a  glance were white men. The strangers and their craft  slipped by with  the quickness of a shadow. 
  Again Philip heard movements above him, and once more he took up   the pursuit. He wondered why Jeanne had not called for help when  the  company canoe passed. If she was not hurt or unconscious, her  captors  had been forced to hold a handkerchief or a brutal hand  over her  mouth, perhaps at her throat! His blood grew hot with  rage at the  thought. 
  For three-quarters of an hour longer the swift paddling up-stream   continued without interruption. Then the river widened into a  small  lake, and Philip was compelled to hold back until the two  canoes,  which he could see clearly now, had passed over the  exposed area. 
  By the time he dared to follow, Jeanne's captors were a quarter of   a mile ahead of him. He no longer heard their paddles when he  entered  the stream at the upper end of the lake, and he bent to  his work with  greater energy and less caution. Five minutes&#8212;ten  minutes passed, and  he saw nothing, heard nothing. His strokes  grew more powerful and the  canoe shot through the water with the  swift cleavage of a knife. A  perspiration began to gather on his  face, and a sudden chilling fear  entered him. Another five minutes  and he stopped. The river swept out  ahead of him, broad and clear,  for a quarter of a mile. There was no  sign of the canoes! 
  For a few moments he remained motionless, drifting back with the   slow current of the stream, stunned by the thought that he had   allowed Jeanne's captors to escape him. Had they heard him and   dropped in to shore to let him pass? He swung his canoe about and   headed down-stream. In that case he could not miss them, if he  used  caution. But if they had turned into some creek hidden in the   gloom&#8212;were even now picking their way through a secret channel  that  led back from the river&#8212; 
  A groan burst from his lips as he thought of Jeanne. In that half   mile of river he could surely find where the canoes had gone, but  it  might be too late. He went down in mid-stream, searching the  shadows  of both shores. His heart sank like lead when he came to  the lake.  There was but one thing to do now, and he ran his canoe  close along  the right-hand shore, looking for an opening. His  progress was slow. A  dozen times he entangled himself in masses of  reeds and rice, or  thrust himself under over-hanging tree-tops  and vines to investigate  the deeper gloom beyond. He had returned  two-thirds of the distance to  the straight-water where he had  given up the pursuit when the bow of  his canoe ran upon a smooth,  sandy bar that shelved out thirty or  forty feet from the shore.  Scarcely had he felt the grate of sand when  with a powerful shove  he sent his canoe back, and almost in the same  instant Pierre's  rifle leveled menacingly shoreward. Drawn up high and  dry on the  sand-bar were the two canoes. 
  For a space Philip expected that his appearance would be the   signal for some movement ashore; but as he drifted slowly away,  his  rifle still leveled, he was filled more and more with the  belief that  he had not been discovered. He allowed himself to  drift until he knew  that he was hidden in the shadows, and then  quietly worked himself in  to shore. Making no sound, he pulled  himself up the bank and crept  among the trees toward the bar.  There was no one guarding the canoes.  He heard no sound of voice,  no crackling of brush or movement of  reeds. For a full minute he  crouched and listened. Then he crept  nearer and found where both  reeds and brush were trampled down into a  path that led away from  the river. 
  His heart gave a bound of joy, and he darted along the path,   holding his rifle ready for instant use. The trail wound through  the  tall grass of a dry swamp meadow and, two hundred yards beyond  the  river, plunged into a forest. He had barely entered this when  he saw  the glow of a fire. It was only a short distance ahead,  hidden in a  deep hollow that completely concealed its existence  from the keenest  eyes that might pass along the river. Stealing  cautiously to the crest  of the little knoll between him and the  light, Philip found himself  within fifty feet of a camp. 
  A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.   The fire was built against this face of a rock in front of this,  and  over the fire hovered a man dragging out beds of coals with a  forked  stick. Almost at the same moment a second man appeared from  the tent,  bearing two huge skillets in one hand and a big pot in  the other. At a  glance Philip knew that they were preparing to  cook a meal, and that  it was for many instead of two. Wildly he  searched the firelit spaces  and the shadows for a sign of Jeanne.  He saw nothing. She was not in  the camp. The five or six men who  had fled up the river with her were  not there. His fingers dug  deep in the earth under him at the  discovery, and once more  appalling fears overwhelmed him. Perhaps she  had already met her  fate a little deeper in the forest. 
  He crept over the edge of the knoll and worked himself down   through the low bush on the opposite side, which would bring him   within a dozen feet of the man over the fire. There he would have   them at his mercy, and at the point of his revolver would compel  them  to tell him where Jeanne had been taken. The advantage was  all in his  favor. It would not be difficult to make them prisoners  and leave them  secured while he followed after their companions. 
  He was intent only upon his plan, and did not take his eyes from   the men over the fire. He came to the end of the bush, and  crouched  with head and shoulders exposed, his revolver in his  hand. Suddenly a  sound close to the tent startled him. It was a  low cough. The men over  the fire made no movement to look behind  them, but Philip turned. 
  In the shadow of a tree, which had concealed her until now, sat   Jeanne. She was tense and straight. Her white face was turned to  him.  Her beautiful eyes glowed like stars. Her lips were parted;  he could  see her quick, excited breathing. She saw him! She knew  him! He could  see the joy of hope in her face and that she was  crushing back an  impulse to cry out to him, even as he was  restraining his own mad  desire to shout out his defiance and joy.  And there in the firelight,  his face illumined, and oblivious for  the moment of the presence of  the two men, Philip straightened  himself and held out his arms with a  glad smile to Jeanne. 
  Hardly had he turned to the men, ready to spring out upon them,   when there came a terrific interruption. There was a sudden crash  in  the brush behind him, a menacing snarl, and a huge wolfish  brute  launched itself at his throat. The swift instinct of self-   preservation turned the weapon intended for the men over the fire   upon this unexpected assailant. The snarling fangs of the husky  were  gleaming in his face and the animal's body was against the  muzzle of  his revolver when Philip fired. Though he escaped the  fangs, he could  not ward off the impact of the dog's body, and in  another moment he  was sprawling upon his back in the light of the  camp. Before Philip  could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards  were upon him. Flung  back, he still possessed his pistol, and  pulled the trigger blindly.  The report was muffled and sickening.  At the same moment a heavy blow  fell upon his head, and a furious  weight crushed him back to the  ground. He dropped his revolver.  His brain reeled; his muscles  relaxed. He felt his assailant's  fingers at his throat, and their  menace brought back every ounce  of fighting strength in his body. For  a moment he lay still, his  eyes closed, the warm blood flowing over  his face. He had worked  this game once before, years ago. He even  thought of that time  now, as he lay upon his back. It had worked then,  and it worked  now. The choking fingers at his throat loosened; the  weight lifted  itself a little from his chest. The lone guard thought  that he was  unconscious, and Jeanne, who had staggered to her feet,  thought  that he was dead. 
  It was her cry, terrible, filled with agony and despair, that   urged him into action an instant too soon. His foe was still  partly  on his guard, rising with a caution born of more than one  wilderness  episode, when with a quick movement Philip closed with  him. Locked in  a deadly grip, they rolled upon the ground; and,  with a feeling of  despair which had never entered into his soul  before, the terrible  truth came to Philip that the old strength  was gone from his arms and  that with each added exertion he was  growing weaker. For a moment he  saw Jeanne. She stood almost above  them, her hands clutched at her  breast. And as he looked, she  suddenly turned and ran to the fire. An  instant more and she was  back, a red-hot brand in her hand. Philip saw  it flash close to  his eyes, felt the heat of it; and then a scream,  animal-like in  its ferocity and pain, burst from the lips of his  antagonist. The  man reeled backward, clutching at his thick neck,  where Jeanne had  thrust the burning stick. Philip rose to his knees.  His fist shot  out like lightning against the other's jaw, and the  second guard  fell back in a limp heap. 
  Even as the blow fell, a loud shout came from close back in the   forest, followed by the crashing of many feet tearing through the   underbrush.
