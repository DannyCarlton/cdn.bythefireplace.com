From Edie Le Breton's lodgings, Hilda Tregellis drove straight,  without stopping all the way, to Arthur Berkeley's house at Chelsea;  for Arthur had long since risen to the dignity of an enfranchised  householder, and had bought himself a pretty cottage near the  Embankment, with room enough for himself and the Progenitor, and  even for any possible future domestic contingency in the way of  wife and children. It was a very unconventional thing for her to  do, no doubt; but Lady Hilda was certainly not the person to be  deterred from doing anything she contemplated on the bare ground  of its extreme unconventionally; and so far was she from objecting  personally to her visit on this score, that before she rang the  Berkeleys' bell she looked quietly at her little bijou watch, and  said with a bland smile to the suspicious Mr. Jenkins, 'Let me see,  Jenkins; it's one o'clock. I shall lunch with my friends here this  morning; so you may take the carriage home now for my lady, and I  shall cab it back, or come round by Metropolitan.' Jenkins was too  much accustcmed to Lady Hilda's unaccountable vagaries to express  any surprise at her wildest resolutions, even if she had proposed  to go home on a costermonger's barrow; so he only touched his hat  respectfully, in his marionette fashion, and drove away at once  without further colloquy.    
'Is Mr. Berkeley at home?' Hilda asked of the pretty servant girl  who opened the door to her, mentally taking note at the same time  that Arthur's aesthetic tendencies evidently extended even to his  human surroundings.    
'Which Mr. Berkeley?' the girl asked in reply. 'Mr. Berkeley  senerer, 'e's at 'ome, but Mr. Arthur, 'e's gone up this mornin'  to 'Olloway.'    
Hilda seized with avidity upon this unexpected and almost providential  opening. 'No, is he?' she said, delighted. 'Then I'll go in and see  Mr. Berkeley senior. No card, thank you: no name: tell him merely  a lady would like to see him. I dare say Mr. Arthur'll be back  before long from Holloway.'    
The girl hesitated a moment as if in doubt, and surveyed Lady Hilda  from head to foot. Hilda, whose eyes were still red from crying,  couldn't help laughing outright at the obvious cause of the girl's  hesitation. 'Do as I tell you,' she said in her imperious way. 'Who  on earth do you take me for, my good girl? That's my card, see: but  you needn't give it to Mr. Berkeley senior. Now go and tell him at  once that a lady is waiting to see him.'    
The innate respect of the English working classes for the kind of  nobility that is supposed to be represented by the British peerage  made the girl drop an instinctive curtsey as she looked at the card,  and answer in a voice of hushed surprise, 'Yes, my lady.' She had  heard Lady Hilda Tregellis spoken of more than once at her master's  table, and she knew, of course, that so great a personage as that  could do no wrong. So she merely ushered her visitor at once into  Arthur Berkeley's beautiful little study, with its delicate grey  pomegranate wall paper and its exquisite unpolished oak fittings,  and said simply, in an overawed manner, 'A lady wishes to speak to  you, sir.'    
The old shoemaker looked up from the English translation of Ribot's  'Psychologie Anglaise Contemporaine,' with whose intricacies he  was manfully struggling, and rose with native politeness to welcome  Hilda.    
'Good morning,' Hilda said, extending her hand to him with one of  her beaming disarming smiles, and annihilating all that was most  obtrusively democratic in him at once by her pleasant manner. 'I'm  a friend of your son's, Mr. Berkeley, and I've come here to see  him about very particular private business--in short, on an errand  of charity. Will he be long gone, do you know?'    
'Not very,' the Progenitor answered, in a somewhat embarrassed  manner, surveying her curiously. 'At least, I should think not.  He's gone to Holloway for an hour or two, but I fancy he'll be back  for two o'clock luncheon, Miss----ur, I don't think I caught your  name, did I?'    
'To Holloway,' Hilda echoed, taking no notice of his suggested  query. 'Oh, then he's gone to see the poor dear Le Bretons, of  course. Why, that's just what I wanted to see him about. If you'll  allow me then, I'll just stop and have lunch with you.'    
'The dickens you will,' the Progenitor thought to himself in speechless  astonishment. 'That's really awfully cool of you. However, I dare  say it's usual to invite oneself in the state of life that that boy  Artie has gone and hoisted himself into, most unnaturally. A fine  lady, no doubt, of their modern pattern; but in my day, up in  Paddington, we should have called her a brazen hussey.--Certainly,  if you will,' he added aloud. 'If you've come on any errand that  will do any good to the Le Bretons, I'm sure my son'll be delighted  to see you. He's greatly grieved at their unhappy condition.'    
'I'm afraid I've nothing much to suggest of any very practical  sort,' Hilda answered, with a slight sigh; 'but at least I should  like to talk with him about the matter. Something must be done  for these two poor young people, you know, Mr. Berkeley. Something  must really be done to help them.'    
'Then you're interested in them, Miss--ur--ur--ah, yes--are you?'    
'Look at my eyes,' Hilda said plumply. 'Are they very red, Mr.  Berkeley?'    
'Well....ur...yes, if I may venture to say so to a lady,' the old  shoemaker answered hesitatingly, with unwonted gallantry. 'I should  say they were a trifle, ur, just a trifle roseate, you know.'    
'Quite so,' Hilda went on, seriously. 'That's it. They're red with  crying. I've been crying like a baby all the morning with that  poor, dear, sweet little angel of a Mrs. Le Breton.'    
'Then you're a great friend of hers, I suppose,' the Progenitor  suggested mildly.    
'Never set eyes on her in my life before this morning, on the  contrary,' Hilda continued in her garrulous fashion. 'But, oh, Mr.  Berkeley, if you'd only seen that dear little woman, crying as if  her heart would break, and telling me that dear Ernest was dying,  actually dying; why--there--excuse me--I can't help it, you know;  we women are always crying about something or other, aren't we?'    
The old man laid his hand on hers quietly. 'Don't mind <i>me</i>, my  dear,' he said with genuine tenderness. 'Don't mind me a bit; I'm  only an old shoemaker, as I dare say you've heard before now; but  I know you'll be the better for crying--women always are--and tears  shed on somebody else's account are never thrown away, my dear,  are they?'    
Hilda took his hand between hers, and wiping her eyes once more  whispered softly, 'No, Mr. Berkeley, no; perhaps they're not; but  oh, they're so useless; so very, very, very useless. Do you know,  I never felt my own powerlessness and helplessness in all my life  so much as I did at that dear, patient little Mrs. Le Breton's  this very morning. There I sat, knowing she was in dire need of  money for her poor husband, and wanting sufficient food and drink,  perhaps, for herself, and him, and the dear darling baby; and in  my hand in my muff I had my purse there with five tenners--Bank of  England ten-pound uotes, you know--fifty pounds altogether, rolled  up inside it; and I would have given anything if only I could have  pulled them out and made them a present to her then and there; and  I couldn't, you see: and, oh, Mr. Berkeley, isn't it terrible to  look at them? And then, before I left, poor Mr. Le Breton himself  came in, and I was quite shocked to see him. I used to know him a  few years ago, and even then he wasn't what you'd call robust by  any means; but now, oh, dear me, he does look so awfully ill and  haggard and miserable that it quite made me break down again, and I  cried about him before his very face; and the moment I got away, I  said to the coachman, "Jenkins, drive straight off to the Embankment  at Chelsea;" and here I am, you see, waiting to talk with your  clever son about it; for, really, Mr. Berkeley, the poor Le Bretons  haven't got a single friend anywhere like your son Arthur.'    
And then Lady Hilda went on to praise Arthur's music to the  Progenitor, and to speak of how much admired he was everywhere,  and to hint that so much genius and musical power must of course be  largely hereditary. Whereat the old man, not unmoved by her gentle  insinuating flattery, at last confessed to his own lifelong musical  tastes, and even casually acknowledged that the motive for one or  two of the minor songs in the famous operas was not entirely of  Arthur's own unaided invention. And so, from one subject to another,  they passed on so quickly, and hit it off with one another so exactly  (for Hilda had a wonderful knack of leading up to everybody's strong  points), that long before lunch was ready, the Progenitor had been  quite won over by the fascinations of the brazen hussey, and was  prepared to admit that she was really a very nice, kind, tender-hearted,  intelligent, appreciative, and discriminating young lady. True,  she had not read Mill or Fawcett, and was ignorant of the very name  of Herbert Spencer; but she had a vast admiration for his dear boy  Artie, and she saw that he himself knew a thing or two in his own  modest way, though he was only what the grand world she moved in  would doubtless call an old superannuated journeyman shoemaker.    
'Ah, yes, a shoemaker! so I've heard somewhere, I fancy,' Lady  Hilda remarked brightly, when for the third time in the course of  their conversation he informed her with great dignity of the interesting  fact; 'how very delightful and charming that is, really, now isn't  it? So original, you know, to make shoes instead of going into some  useless profession, especially when you're such a great reader  and student and thinker as you are--for I see you're a philosopher  and a psychologist already, Mr. Berkeley'--Hilda considered it rather  a bold effort on her part to pronounce the word 'psychologist' at  the very first trial without stumbling; but though she was a little  doubtful about the exact pronunciation of that fearful vocable,  she felt quite at her ease about the fact at least, because  she carefully noticed him lay down Ribot on the table beside him,  name upward; 'one can't help finding that much out on a very short  acquaintance, can one? Though, indeed, now I come to think of it,  I believe I've heard often that men of your calling generally <i>are</i>  very fond of reading, and are very philosophical, and clever, and  political, and all that sort of thing; and they say that's the  reason, of course, why Northampton's such an exceptionally intelligent  constituency, and always returns such thoroughgoing able logical  Radicals.'    
The old man's eyes beamed, as she spoke, with inexpressible pride  and pleasure. 'I'm very glad indeed to hear you say so,' he answered  promptly with a complacent self-satisfied smile, 'and I believe  you're right too, Miss, ur--ur--ur--quite so. The practice of  shoemaking undoubtedly tends to develop a very high and exceptional  level of general intelligence and logical power.'    
'I'm sure of it,' Hilda answered demurely, in a tone of the deepest  and sincerest conviction; 'and when I heard somebody say somewhere,  that your son was...--well, <i>was</i> your son, I said to myself at once,  "Ah, well, there now, that quite accounts, of course, for young  Mr. Berkeley's very extraordinary and unusual abilities!"'    
'She's really a most sensible, well-informed young woman, whoever  she is,' the Progenitor thought to himself silently; 'and it's  certainly a pity that dear Artie couldn't take a fancy to some nice,  appreciative, kind-hearted, practical girl like that now, instead  of wearing away all the best days of his life in useless regret  for that poor slender, unsubstantial nonentity of a watery little  Mrs. Le Breton.'    
By two o'clock lunch was ready, and just as it had been announced,  Arthur Berkeley ran up the front steps, and let himself in with  his proprietory latch-key. Turning straight into the dining-room,  he was just in time to see his own father walking into lunch arm  in arm with Lady Hilda Tregellis. As Mrs. Hallis had graphically  expressed it, he felt as if you might have knocked him down with  a feather! Was she absolutely ubiquitous, then, this pervasive  Lady Hilda? and was he destined wherever he went to come upon her  suddenly in the most unexpected and incomprehensible situations?    
'Will you sit down here, my dear,' the Progenitor was saying to  Hilda at the exact moment he entered, 'or would you prefer your  back to the fire?'    
Arthur Berkeley opened his eyes wide with unspeakable amazement.  'What, <i>you</i> here,' he exclaimed, coming forward suddenly to shake  hands with Hilda; 'why, I saw you only a couple of hours since at  the Le Bretons' at Holloway.'    
'You did!' Hilda cried with almost equal astonishment, 'Why, how  was that? I never saw <i>you</i>.'    
Arthur sighed quietly. 'No,' he answered, with a curious look at  the Progenitor; 'you were engaged when I opened the door, and I  didn't like to disturb you. You were--you were speaking with poor  little Mrs. Le Breton. But I'm so much obliged to you for your  kindness to them, Lady Hilda; so very much obliged to you for your  great kindness to them.'    
It was the Progenitor's turn now to start in surprise. 'What! Lady  Hilda!' he cried with a bewildered look. 'Lady Hilda! Did I hear  you say "Lady Hilda"? Is this Lady Hilda Tregellis, then, that I've  heard you talk about so often, Artie?'    
'Why, of course, Father. You didn't know who it was, then, didn't  you? Lady Hilda, I'm afraid you've been stealing a march upon the  poor unsuspecting hostile Progenitor.'    
'Not quite that, Mr. Berkeley,' Hilda replied, laughing; 'only  after the very truculent character I had heard of your father as  a regular red-hot militant Radical, I thought I'd better not send  in my name to him at once for fear it might prejudice him against  me before first acquaintance.'    
The Progenitor looked at her steadfastly from head to foot, standing  before him there in her queenly beauty, as if she were some strange  wild beast that he had been requested to inspect and report upon  for a scientific purpose. 'Lady Hilda Tregellis!' he said slowly  and deliberately; 'Lady Hilda Tregellis! So this is Lady Hilda  Tregellis, is it? Well, all I can say is this, then, that as far as  I can judge her, Lady Hilda Tregellis is a very sensible, modest,  intelligent, well-conducted young woman, which is more than I  could possibly have expected from a person of her unfortunate and  distressing hereditary antecedents. But you know, my dear, it was  a very mean trick of you to go and take an old man's heart by guile  and stratagem in that way!'    
Hilda laughed a little uneasily. The Progenitor's manner was perhaps  a trifle too open and unconventional even for her. 'It wasn't for  that I came, Mr. Berkeley,' she said again with one of her sunny  smiles, which brought the Progenitor metaphorically to her feet  again, 'but to talk over this matter of the poor Le Bretons with  your son. Oh, Mr. Arthur, something must really be done to help  them. I know you say there's nothing to be done; but there must be;  we must find it out; we must invent it; we must compel it. When  I sat there this morning with that dear little woman and saw  her breaking her full heart over her husband's trouble, I said to  myself, somehow, Hilda Tregellis, if you can't find a way out of  this, you're not worth your salt in this world, and you'd better  make haste and take a rapid through-ticket at once to the next, if  there is one.'    
'Which is more than doubtful, really,' the Progenitor muttered  softly half under his breath; 'which, as Strauss has conclusively  shown, is certainly a good deal more than doubtful.'    
Arthur took no notice of the interruption, but merely answered  imploringly, with a despairing gesture of his hands, 'What are we  to do, Lady Hilda? What can we possibly do?'    
'Why, sit down and have some lunch first,' Hilda rejoined with  practical common-sense, 'and then talk it over rationally afterwards,  instead of wringing our hands helplessly like a pair of Frenchmen  in a street difficulty.' (Hilda had a fine old crusted English  contempt, by the way, for those vastly inferior and foolish creatures  known as foreigners.)    
Thus adjured, Berkeley sat down promptly, and they proceeded to take  counsel together in this hard matter over the cutlets and claret  provided before them. 'Ernest and Mrs. Le Breton told me all about  your visit,' Arthur went on, soon after; 'and they're so much obliged  to you for having taken the trouble to look them up in their sore  distress. Do you know, Lady Hilda, I think you've quite made a  conquest of our dear little friend, Mrs. Le Breton.'    
'I don't know about that,' Hilda responded with a smile, 'but I'm  sure, at any rate, that the sweet little woman quite made a conquest  of me, Mr. Berkeley. In fact, I can't say what you think, but for  my part I'm determined an effort must be made one way or another  to save them.'    
'It's no use,' Arthur answered, shaking his head sadly; 'it can't  be done. There's nothing for it but to let them float down helplessly  with the tide, wherever it may bear them.'    
'Stuff and nonsense,' Hilda replied energetically. 'All rubbish,  utter rubbish, and if I were a man as you are, Mr. Berkeley, I  should be ashamed to take such a desponding view of the situation.  If we say it's got to be done, it will be done, and that's an end  of it. Work must and can be found for him somehow or somewhere.'    
'But the man's dying,' Arthur interrupted with a vehement gesture.  'There's no more work left in him. The only thing that's any use  is to send him off to Madeira, or Egypt, or Catania, or somewhere  of that sort, and let him die quietly among the palms and cactuses  and aloes. That's Sir Antony Wraxall's opinion, and surely nobody  in London can know half as well as he does about the matter.'    
'Sir Antony's a fool,' Hilda responded with refreshing bluntness.  'He knows nothing on earth at all about it. He's accustomed to  prescribing for a lot of us idle good-for-nothing rich people'--('Very  true,' the Progenitor assented parenthetically;) 'and he's got  into a fixed habit of prescribing a Nile voyage, just as he's got  into a fixed habit of prescribing old wine, and carriage exercise,  and ten thousand a year to all his patients. What Mr. Le Breton  really wants is not Egypt, or old wine, or Sir Antony, or anything  of the sort, but relief from this pressing load of anxiety and  responsibility. Put him in my hands for six months, and I'll back  myself at a hundred to six against Sir Antony to cure him for a  monkey.'    
'For a what!' the Progenitor asked with a puzzled expression of  countenance.    
'Back myself for a monkey, you know,' Hilda answered, without  perceiving the cause of the old man's innocent confusion.    
The Progenitor was evidently none the wiser still for Hilda's  answer, though he forbore to pursue the subject any farther, lest  he should betray his obvious ignorance of aristocratic manners and  dialect.    
But Arthur looked up at Lady Hilda with something like the gleam of  a new-born hope on his distressed features. 'Lady Hilda,' he said  almost cheerfully, 'you really speak as if you had some practicable  plan actually in prospect. It seems to me, if anybody can pull  them through, you can, because you've got such a grand reserve of  faith and energy. What is it, now, you think of doing?'    
'Well,' Hilda answered, taken a little aback at this practical  question, 'I've hardly got my plan matured yet; but I've got a  plan; and I thought it all out as far as it went as I came along  here just now in the carriage. The great thing is, we must inspire  Mr. Le Breton with a new confidence; we must begin by showing him  we believe in him, and letting him see that he may still manage  in some way or other to retrieve himself. He has lost all hope: we  must begin with him over again. I've got an idea, but it'll take  money. Now, I can give up half my allowance for the next year--the  Le Bretons need never know anything about it--that'll be something:  you're a rich man now, I believe, Mr. Berkeley; will you make up  as much as I do, if my plan seems a feasible one to you for retrieving  the position?'    
The Progenitor answered quickly for him: 'Miss Tregellis,' he  said, with a little tremor in his voice, '--you'll excuse me, my  dear, but it's against my principles to call anybody my lady:--he  will, I know he will; and if he wouldn't, why, my dear, I'd go  back to my cobbling and earn it myself rather than that you or your  friends should go without it for a single minute.'    
Arthur said nothing, but he bowed his head silently. What a lot of  good there was really in that splendid woman, and what a commanding,  energetic, masterful way she had about her! To a feckless, undecided,  faltering man like Arthur Berkeley there was something wonderfully  attractive and magnificent, after all, in such an imperious resolute  woman as Lady Hilda.    
'Then this is my plan,' Hilda went on hastily. 'We must do  something that'll take Mr. Le Breton out of himself for a short  time entirely--that'll give him occupation of a kind he thinks  right, and at the same time put money in his pocket. Now, he's  always talking about this socialistic business of his; but why  doesn't he tell us what he has actually seen about the life and  habits of the really poor? Mrs. Le Breton tells me he knows the  East End well: why doesn't he sit down and give us a good rattling,  rousing, frightening description of all that's in it? Of course,  I don't care twopence about the poor myself--not in the lump, I  mean--I beg your pardon, Mr. Berkeley,'--for the Progenitor gave  a start of surprise and astonishment--'you know we women are nothing  if not concrete; we never care for anything in the abstract, Mr. Le  Breton used to tell me; we want the particular case brought home  to our sympathies before we can interest ourselves about it. After  all, even <i>you</i> who are men don't feel very much for all the miserable  wretched people there are in China, you know; they're too far away  for even you to bother your heads about. But I <i>do</i> care about the  Le Bretons, and it strikes me we might help them a little in this  way. I know a lot of artists, Mr. Berkeley; and I know one who  I think would just do for the very work I want to set him. (He's  poor, too, by the way, and I don't mind giving him a lift at the  same time and killing two birds with one stone.) Very well, then;  I go to him, and say, "Mr. Verney," I say,--there now, I didn't mean  to tell you his name, but no matter; "Mr. Verney," I shall say, "a  friend of mine in the writing line is going to pay some visits to  the very poor quarters in the East End, and write about it, which  will make a great noise in the world as sure as midday."'    
'But how do you know it will?' asked the Progenitor, simply.    
Hilda turned round upon him with an unfeigned look of startled  astonishment. 'How do I know it will?' she said confidently. 'Why,  because I mean it to, Mr. Berkeley. Because I say it shall. Because  I choose to make it. Two Cabinet ministers shall quote it in the  House, and a duke shall write letters to the "Times" denouncing it  as an intensely wicked and revolutionary publication. If I choose  to float it, I <i>will</i> float it.--Well, "Mr. Verney," I say for example,  "will you undertake to accompany him and make sketches? It'll be  unpleasant work, I know, because I've been there myself to see,  and the places don't smell nice at all--worse than Genoa or the  old town at Nice even, I can tell you: but it'll make you a name;  and in any case the publisher who's getting it up'll pay you well  for it." Of course, Mr. Verney says "Yes." Then we go on to Mr.  Le Breton and say, "A young artist of my acquaintance is making a  pilgrimage into the East End to see for himself how the people live,  and to make pictures of them to stir up the sluggish consciences of  the lazy aristocrats"--that's me and my people, of course: that'll  be the way to work it. Play upon Mr. Le Breton's tenderest feelings.  Make him feel he's fighting for the Cause; and he'll be ready to  throw himself, heart and soul, into the spirit of the project. I  don't care twopence about the Cause myself, of course, so that's  flat, and I don't pretend to, either, Mr. Berkeley; but I care a  great deal for the misery of that poor, dear, pale little woman,  sitting there with me this morning and regularly sobbing her heart  out; and if I can do anything to help her, why, I shall be only  too delighted.'    
'Le Breton's a well-meaning young fellow, certainly,' the Progenitor  murmured gently in a voice of graceful concession; 'and I believe  his heart's really in the Cause, as you call it; but you know, my  dear, he's very far from being sound in his economical views as to  the relations of capital and labour. Far from sound, as John Stuart  Mill would have judged the question, I can solemnly assure you.'    
'Very well,' Hilda went on, almost without noticing the interruption.  'We shall say to him, or rather we shall get our publisher to say  to him, that as he's interested in the matter, and knows the East  End well, he has been selected--shall we put it on somebody's  recommendation?--to accompany the artist, and to supply the reading  matter, the letter-press I think you call it; in fact, to write up  to our illustrator's pictures; and that he is to be decently paid  for his trouble. He must do something graphic, something stirring,  something to wake up lazy people in the West End to a passing  sense of what he calls their responsibilities. That'll seem like  real work to Mr. Le Breton. It'll put new heart into him; he'll take  up the matter vigorously; he'll do it well; he'll write a splendid  book; and I shall guarantee its making a stir in the world this  very dull season. What's the use of knowing half the odiously  commonplace bores and prigs in all London if you can't float a  single little heterodox pamphlet for a particular purpose? What do  you think of it, Mr. Berkeley?'    
Arthur sighed again. 'It seems to me, Lady Hilda,' he said, regretfully,  'a very slender straw indeed to hang Ernest Le Breton's life on:  but any straw is better than nothing to a drowning man. And you  have so much faith yourself, and mean to fling yourself into it so  earnestly, that I shouldn't be wholly surprised if you were somehow  to pull it through. If you do, Lady Hilda--if you manage to save  these two poor young people from the verge of starvation--you'll  have done a very great good work in your day, and you'll have made  me personally eternally your debtor.'    
Was it mere fancy, the Progenitor wondered, or did Hilda cast her  eyes down a little and half blush as she answered in a lower and  more tremulous tone than usual, 'I hope I shall, Mr. Berkeley;  for their sakes, I hope I shall.' The Progenitor didn't feel quite  certain about it, but somehow, more than once that evening, as he  sat reading Spencer's 'Data of Ethics' in his easy-chair, a curious  vision of Lady Hilda as a future daughter-in-law floated vaguely  with singular persistence before the old shoemaker's bewildered  eyes. 'It'd be a shocking falling away on Artie's part from his  father's principles,' he muttered inarticulately to himself several  times over; 'and yet, on the other hand, I can't deny that this bit  of a Tregellis girl is really a very tidy, good-looking, respectable,  well-meaning, intelligent, and appreciative sort of a young woman,  who'd, maybe, make Artie as good a wife as anybody else he'd be  likely to pitch on.'
