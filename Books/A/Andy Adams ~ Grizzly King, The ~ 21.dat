  For a good half-mile Muskwa followed over the trail of Langdon. He  ran at first; then he walked; finally he stopped entirely and sat down  like a dog, facing the distant slope. Had Langdon been afoot he would  not have halted until he was tired. But the cub had not liked his  pannier prison. He had been tremendously jostled and bounced about, and  twice the horse that carried him had shaken himself, and those shakings  had been like earthquakes to Muskwa. He knew that the cage as well as  Langdon was ahead of him. He sat for a time and whimpered wistfully,  but he went no farther. He was sure that the friend he had grown to  love would return after a little. He always came back. He had never  failed him. So he began to hunt about for a spring beauty or a  dog-tooth violet, and for some time he was careful not to stray very  far away from where the outfit had passed.
  All that day the cub remained in the flower-strewn meadows under the  slope; it was very pleasant in the sunshine, and he found more than one  patch of the bulbous roots he liked. He dug, and he filled himself, and  he took a nap in the afternoon; but when the sun began to go down and  the heavy shadows of the mountain darkened the valley he began to grow  afraid.
  He was still a very small baby of a cub, and only that one dreadful  night after his mother had died had he spent entirely alone. Thor had  replaced mother, and Langdon had taken the place of Thor, so that until  now he had never felt the loneliness and emptiness of darkness. He  crawled under a clump of thorn close to the trail, and continued to  wait, and listen, and sniff expectantly. The stars came out clear and  brilliant, but to-night their lure was not strong enough to call him  forth. Not until dawn did he steal out cautiously from his shelter of  thorn.
  The sun gave him courage and confidence again and he began wandering  back through the valley, the scent of the horse-trail growing fainter  and fainter until at last it disappeared entirely. That day Muskwa ate  some grass and a few dog-tooth violet roots, and when the second night  came he was abreast of the slope over which the outfit had come from  the valley in which were Thor and Iskwao. He was tired and hungry, and  he was utterly lost.
  That night he slept in the end of a hollow log. The next day he went  on, and for many days and many nights after that he was alone in the  big valley. He passed close to the pool where Thor and he had met the  old bear, and he nosed hungrily among the fishbones; he skirted the  edge of the dark, deep lake; he saw the shadowy things fluttering in  the gloom of the forest again; he passed over the beaver dam, and he  slept for two nights close to the log-jam from which he had watched  Thor throw out their first fish. He was almost forgetting Langdon now,  and was thinking more and more about Thor and his mother. He wanted  them. He wanted them more than he had ever wanted the companionship of  man, for Muskwa was fast becoming a creature of the wild again.
  It was the beginning of August before the cub came to the break in  the valley and climbed up the slope where Thor had first heard the  thunder and had first felt the sting of the white men's guns. In these  two weeks Muskwa had grown rapidly, in spite of the fact that he often  went to bed on an empty stomach; and he was no longer afraid of the  dark. Through the deep, sunless canyon above the clay wallow he went,  and as there was only one way out he came at last to the summit of the  break over which Thor had gone, and over which Langdon and Bruce had  followed in close pursuit. And the other valley&#8212;his home&#8212;lay under  Muskwa.
  Of course he did not recognize it. He saw and smelled in it nothing  that was familiar. But it was such a beautiful valley, and so  abundantly filled with plenty and sunshine, that he did not hurry  through it. He found whole gardens of spring beauties and dog-tooth  violets. And on the third day he made his first real kill. He almost  stumbled over a baby whistler no larger than a red squirrel, and before  the little creature could escape he was upon it. It made him a splendid  feast.
  It was fully a week before he passed along the creek-bottom close  under the slope where his mother had died. If he had been travelling  along the crest of the slope he would have found her bones, picked  clean by the wild things. It was another week before he came to the  little meadow where Thor had killed the bull caribou and the big black  bear.
  And now Muskwa knew that he was home!
  For two days he did not travel two hundred yards from the scene of  feast and battle, and night and day he was on the watch for Thor. Then  he had to seek farther for food, but each afternoon when the mountains  began to throw out long shadows he would return to the clump of trees  in which they had made the cache that the black bear robber had  despoiled.
  One day he went farther than usual in his quest for roots. He was a  good half-mile from the place he had made home, and he was sniffing  about the end of a rock when a great shadow fell suddenly upon him. He  looked up, and for a full half-minute he stood transfixed, his heart  pounding and jumping as it had never pounded and jumped before in his  life. Within five feet of him stood Thor! The big grizzly was as  motionless as he, looking at him steadily. And then Muskwa gave a  puppy-like whine of joy and ran forward. Thor lowered his huge head,  and for another half-minute they stood without moving, with Thor's nose  buried in the hair on Muskwa's back. After that Thor went up the slope  as if the cub had never been lost at all, and Muskwa followed him  happily.
  Many days of wonderful travel and of glorious feasting came after  this, and Thor led Muskwa into a thousand new places in the two valleys  and the mountains between. There were great fishing days, and there was  another caribou killed over the range, and Muskwa grew fatter and  fatter and heavier and heavier until by the middle of September he was  as large as a good-sized dog.
  Then came the berries, and Thor knew where they all grew low down in  the valleys&#8212;first the wild red raspberries, then the soap berries, and  after those the delicious black currants which grew in the cool depths  of the forests and were almost as large as cherries and nearly as sweet  as the sugar which Langdon had fed Muskwa. Muskwa liked the black  currants best of all. They grew in thick, rich clusters; there were no  leaves on the bushes that were loaded with them, and he could pick and  eat a quart in five minutes.
  But at last the time came when there were no berries. This was in  October. The nights were very cold, and for whole days at a time the  sun would not shine, and the skies were dark and heavy with clouds. On  the peaks the snow was growing deeper and deeper, and it never thawed  now up near the sky-line. Snow fell in the valley, too&#8212;at first just  enough to make a white carpet that chilled Muskwa's feet, but it  quickly disappeared. Raw winds began to come out of the north, and in  place of the droning music of the valley in summertime there were now  shrill wailings and screechings at night, and the trees made mournful  sounds.
  To Muskwa the whole world seemed changing. He wondered in these  chill and dark days why Thor kept to the windswept slopes when he might  have found shelter in the bottoms. And Thor, if he explained to him at  all, told him that winter was very near, and that these slopes were  their last feeding grounds. In the valleys the berries were gone; grass  and roots alone were no longer nourishing enough for their bodies; they  could no longer waste time in seeking ants and grubs; the fish were in  deep water. It was the season when the caribou were keen-scented as  foxes and swift as the wind. Only along the slopes lay the dinners they  were sure of&#8212;famine-day dinners of whistlers and gophers. Thor dug for  them now, and in this digging Muskwa helped as much as he could. More  than once they turned out wagonloads of earth to get at the cozy winter  sleeping quarters of a whistler family, and sometimes they dug for  hours to capture three or four little gophers no larger than red  squirrels, but lusciously fat.
  Thus they lived through the last days of October into November. And  now the snow and the cold winds and the fierce blizzards from the north  came in earnest, and the ponds and lakes began to freeze over. Still  Thor hung to the slopes, and Muskwa shivered with the cold at night and  wondered if the sun was never going to shine again.
  One day about the middle of November Thor stopped in the very act of  digging out a family of whistlers, went straight down into the valley,  and struck southward in a most businesslike way. They were ten miles  from the clay-wallow canyon when they started, but so lively was the  pace set by the big grizzly that they reached it before dark that same  afternoon.
  For two days after this Thor seemed to have no object in life at  all. There was nothing in the canyon to eat, and he wandered about  among the rocks, smelling and listening and deporting himself generally  in a fashion that was altogether mystifying to Muskwa. In the afternoon  of the second day Thor stopped in a dump of jackpines under which the  ground was strewn with fallen needles. He began to eat these needles.  They did not look good to Muskwa, but something told the cub that he  should do as Thor was doing; so he licked them up and swallowed them,  not knowing that it was nature's last preparation for his long sleep.
  It was four o'clock when they came to the mouth of the deep cavern  in which Thor was born, and here again Thor paused, sniffing up and  down the wind, and waiting for nothing in particular.
  It was growing dark. A wailing storm hung over the canyon. Biting  winds swept down from the peaks, and the sky was black and full of  snow.
  For a minute the grizzly stood with his head and shoulders in the  cavern door. Then he entered. Muskwa followed. Deep back they went  through a pitch-black gloom, and it grew warmer and warmer, and the  wailing of the wind died away until it was only a murmur.
  It took Thor at least half an hour to arrange himself just as he  wanted to sleep. Then Muskwa curled up beside him. The cub was very  warm and very comfortable.
  That night the storm raged, and the snow fell deep. It came up the  canyon in clouds, and it drifted down through the canyon roof in still  thicker clouds, and all the world was buried deep. When morning came  there was no cavern door, there were no rocks, and no black and purple  of tree and shrub. All was white and still, and there was no longer the  droning music in the valley.
  Deep back in the cavern Muskwa moved restlessly. Thor heaved a deep  sigh. After that long and soundly they slept. And it may be that they  dreamed.
 
  THE VALLEY OF SILENT MEN
  &#8220;You are going up from among a people who have many gods to a people  who have but one,&#8221; said Ransom quietly, looking across at the other.  &#8220;It would be better for you if you turned back. I've spent four years  in the Government service, mostly north of Fifty-three, and I know what  I'm talking about. I've read all of your books carefully, and I tell  you now&#8212;go back. If you strike up into the Bay country, as you say  you're going to, every dream of socialism you ever had will be  shattered, and you will laugh at your own books. Go back!&#8221;
  Roscoe's fine young face lighted up with a laugh at his old college  chum's seriousness.
  &#8220;You're mistaken, Ranny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'm not a socialist but a  sociologist. There's a distinction, isn't there? I don't believe that  my series of books will be at all complete without a study of socialism  as it exists in its crudest form, and as it must exist up here in the  North. My material for this last book will show what tremendous  progress the civilization of two centuries on this continent has made  over the lowest and wildest forms of human brotherhood. That's my idea,  Ranny. I'm an optimist. I believe that every invention we make, that  every step we take in the advancement of science, of mental and  physical uplift, brings us just so much nearer to the Nirvana of  universal love. This trip of mine among your wild people of the North  will give me a good picture of what civilization has gained.&#8221;
  &#8220;What it has lost, you will say a little later,&#8221; replied Ransom.  &#8220;See here, Roscoe&#8212;has it ever occurred to you that brotherly love, as  you call it&#8212;the real thing&#8212;ended when civilization began? Has it ever  occurred to you that somewhere away back in the darkest ages your  socialistic Nirvana may have existed, and that you sociologists might  still find traces of it, if you would? Has the idea ever come to you  that there has been a time when the world has been better than it is  to-day, and better than it ever will be again? Will you, as a student  of life, concede that the savage can teach you a lesson? Will any of  your kind? No, for you are self-appointed civilizers, working according  to a certain code.&#8221;
  Ransom's weather-tanned face had taken on a deeper flush, and there  was a questioning look in Roscoe's eyes, as though he were striving to  look through a veil of clouds to a picture just beyond his vision.
  &#8220;If most of us believed as you believe,&#8221; he said at last,  &#8220;civilization would end. We would progress no farther.&#8221;
  &#8220;And this civilization,&#8221; said Ransom, &#8220;can there not be too much of  it? Was it any worse for God's first men to set forth and slay twenty  thousand other men, than it is for civilization's sweat-shops to slay  twenty thousand men, women, and children each year in the making of  your cigars and the things you wear? Civilization means the uplifting  of man, doesn't it, and when it ceases to uplift when it kills, robs,  and disrupts in the name of progress; when the dollar-fight for  commercial and industrial supremacy kills more people in a day than  God's first people killed in a year; when not only people, but nations,  are sparring for throat-grips, can we call it civilization any longer?  This talk may all be bally rot, Roscoe. Ninety-nine out of every  hundred people will think that it is. There are very few these days who  stoop to the thought that the human soul is the greatest of all  creations, and that it is the development of the soul, and not of  engines and flying machines and warships, that measures progress as God  meant progress to be. I am saying this because I want you to be honest  when you go up among the savages, as you call them. You may find up  there the last chapter in life, as it was largely intended that life  should be in the beginning of things. And I want you to understand it,  because in your books you possess a power which should be well  directed. When I received your last letter I hunted up the best man I  knew as guide and companion for you&#8212;old Rameses, down at the Mission.  He is called Rameses because he looks like the old boy himself. You  said you wanted to learn Cree, and he'll teach it to you. He will teach  you a lot of other things, and when you look at him, especially at  night beside the campfire, you will find something in his face which  will recall what I have said, and make you think of the first people.&#8221;
  Roscoe, at thirty-two, had not lost his boy's enthusiasm in life, in  spite of the fact that he had studied too deeply, and had seen too  much, and had begun fighting for existence while still in bare feet.  From the beginning it seemed as though some grim monster of fate had  hovered about him, making his path as rough as it could, and striking  him down whenever the opportunity came. His own tremendous energy and  ambition had carried him to the top.
  He worked himself through college, and became a success in his way.  But at no time could he remember real happiness. It had almost come to  him, he thought, a year before&#8212;in the form of a girl; but this promise  had passed like the others because, of a sudden, he found that she had  shattered the most precious of all his ideals. So he picked himself up,  and, encouraged by his virile optimism, began looking forward again.  Bad luck had so worked its hand in the moulding of him that he had come  to live chiefly in anticipation, and though this bad luck had played  battledore and shuttlecock with him, the things which he anticipated  were pleasant and beautiful. He believed that the human race was  growing better, and that each year was bringing his ideals just so much  nearer to realization. More than once he had told himself that he was  living two or three centuries too soon. Ransom, his old college chum,  had been the first to suggest that he was living some thousands of  years too late.
  He thought of this a great deal during the first pleasant weeks of  the autumn, which he and old Rameses spent up in the Lac la Ronge and  Reindeer Lake country. During this time he devoted himself almost  entirely to the study of Cree under Rameses' tutelage, and the more he  learned of it the more he saw the truth of what Ransom had told him  once upon a time, that the Cree language was the most beautiful in the  world. At the upper end of the Reindeer they spent a week at a Cree  village, and one day Roscoe stood unobserved and listened to the  conversation of three young Cree women, who were weaving reed baskets.  They talked so quickly that he could understand but little of what they  said, but their low, soft voices were like music. He had learned French  in Paris, and had heard Italian in Rome, but never in his life had he  heard words or voices so beautiful as those which fell from the red,  full lips of the Cree girls. He thought more seriously than ever of  what Ransom had said about the first people, and the beginning of  things.
  Late in October they swung westward through the Sissipuk and  Burntwood water ways to Nelson House, and at this point Rameses  returned homeward. Roscoe struck north, with two new guides, and on the  eighteenth of November the first of the two great storms which made the  year of 1907 one of the most tragic in the history of the far Northern  people overtook them on Split Lake, thirty miles from a Hudson's Bay  post. It was two weeks later before they reached this post, and here  Roscoe was given the first of several warnings.
  &#8220;This has been the worst autumn we've had for years,&#8221; said the  factor to him. &#8220;The Indians haven't caught half enough fish to carry  them through, and this storm has ruined the early-snow hunting in which  they usually get enough meat to last them until spring. We're stinting  ourselves on our own supplies now, and farther north the Company will  soon be on famine rations if the cold doesn't let up&#8212;and it won't.  They won't want an extra mouth up there, so you'd better turn back.  It's going to be a starvation winter.&#8221;
  But Roscoe, knowing as little as the rest of man-kind of the  terrible famines of the northern people, which keep an area one-half as  large as the whole of Europe down to a population of thirty thousand,  went on. A famine, he argued, would give him greater opportunity for  study.
  Two weeks later he was at York Factory, and from there he continued  to Fort Churchill, farther up on Hudson's Bay. By the time he reached  this point, early in January, the famine of those few terrible weeks  during which more than fifteen hundred people died of starvation had  begun. From the Barren Lands to the edge of the southern watershed the  earth lay under from four to six feet of snow, and from the middle of  December until late in February the temperature did not rise above  thirty degrees below zero, and remained for the most of the time  between fifty and sixty. From all points in the wilderness reports of  starvation came to the Company's posts. Traplines could not be followed  because of the intense cold. Moose, caribou, and even the furred  animals had buried themselves under the snow. Indians and halfbreeds  dragged themselves into the posts. Twice Roscoe saw mothers who brought  dead babies in their arms. One day a white trapper came in with his  dogs and sledge, and on the sledge, wrapped in a bear skin, was his  wife, who had died fifty miles back in the forest.
  Late in January there came a sudden rise in the temperature, and  Roscoe prepared to take advantage of the change to strike south and  westward again, toward Nelson House. Dogs could not be had for love or  money, so on the first of February he set out on snowshoes with an  Indian guide and two weeks' supply of provisions. The fifth night, in  the wild, Barren country west of the Etawney, his Indian failed to keep  up the fire, and when Roscoe investigated he found him half dead with a  strange sickness. Roscoe thought of smallpox, the terrible plague that  usually follows northern famine, and a shiver ran through him. He made  the Indian's balsam shelter snow and wind proof, cut wood, and waited.  The temperature fell again, and the cold became intense. Each day the  provisions grew less, and at last the time came when Roscoe knew that  he was standing face to face with the Great Peril. He went farther and  farther from camp in his search for game. But there was no life. Even  the brush sparrows and snow hawks were gone. Once the thought came to  him that he might take what food was left, and accept the little chance  that remained of saving himself. But the idea never got further than a  first thought. He kept to his post, and each day spent half an hour in  writing. On the twelfth day the Indian died. It was a terrible day, the  beginning of the second great storm of that winter. There was food for  another twenty-four hours, and Roscoe packed it, together with his  blankets and a little tinware. He wondered if the Indian had died of a  contagious disease. Anyway, he made up his mind to put out the warning  for others if they came that way, and over the dead Indian's balsam  shelter he planted a sapling, and at the end of the sapling he fastened  a strip of red cotton cloth&#8212;the plague-signal of the North.
  Then he struck out through the deep snows and the twisting storm,  knowing that there was no more than one chance in a thousand ahead of  him, and that his one chance was to keep the wind at his back.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  This was the beginning of the wonderful experience which Roscoe  Cummins afterward described in his book &#8220;The First People and the  Valley of Silent Men.&#8221; He prepared another manuscript which for  personal reasons was never published, the story of a dark-eyed girl of  the First People&#8212;but this is to come. It has to do with the last  tragic weeks of this winter of 1907, in which it was a toss-up between  all things of flesh and blood in the Northland to see which would  win&#8212;life or death&#8212;and in which a pair of dark eyes and a voice from  the First People turned a sociologist into a possible Member of  Parliament.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  At the end of his first day's struggle Roscoe built himself a camp  in a bit of scrub timber, which was not much more than brush. If he had  been an older hand he would have observed that this bit of timber, and  every tree and bush that he had passed since noon, was stripped and  dead on the side that faced the north. It was a sign of the Great  Barrens, and of the fierce storms that swept over them, destroying even  the life of the trees. He cooked and ate his last food the following  day, and went on. The small timber turned to scrub, and the scrub, in  time, to vast snow wastes over which the storm swept mercilessly. All  this day he looked for game, for a flutter of bird life; he chewed  bark, and in the afternoon got a mouthful of Fox-bite, which made his  throat swell until he could scarcely breathe. At night he made tea, but  had nothing to eat. His hunger was acute and painful. It was torture  the next day&#8212;the third&#8212;for the process of starvation is a rapid one  in this country where only the fittest survive on four meals a day. He  camped, built a small bush fire at night, and slept. He almost failed  to rouse himself on the morning that followed, and when he staggered to  his feet and felt the cutting sting of the storm still in his face, and  heard the swishing wail of it over the Barren, he knew that at last the  moment had come when he was standing face to face with the Almighty.
  For some strange reason he was not frightened at the situation. He  found that even over the level spaces he could scarcely drag his snow  shoes, but this had ceased to alarm him as he had been alarmed at  first. He went on, hour after hour, weaker and weaker. Within himself  there was still life which reasoned that if death were to come it could  not come in a better way. It at least promised to be painless&#8212;even  pleasant. The sharp, stinging pains of hunger, like little electrical  knives piercing him, were gone; he no longer experienced a sensation of  intense cold; he almost felt that he could lie down in the drifted snow  and sleep peacefully. He knew what it would be&#8212;a sleep without  end&#8212;with the arctic foxes to pick his bones, and so he resisted the  temptation and forced himself onward. The storm still swept straight  west from Hudson's Bay, bringing with it endless volleys of snow, round  and hard as fine shot; snow that had at first seemed to pierce his  flesh, and which swished past his feet, as if trying to trip him, and  tossed itself in windrows and mountains in his path. If he could only  find timber&#8212;shelter! That was what he worked for now. When he had last  looked at his watch it was nine o'clock in the morning; now it was late  in the afternoon. It might as well have been night. The storm had long  since half blinded him. He could not see a dozen paces ahead. But the  little life in him still reasoned bravely. It was a heroic spark of  life, a fighting spark, and hard to put out. It told him that when he  came to shelter be would at least<I> feel</I> it, and that he must  fight until the last. And all this time, for ages and ages it seemed to  him, he kept mumbling over and over again Ransom's words:
 <I> &#8220;Go back&#8212;Go back&#8212;Go back&#8212;-&#8221;</I>
  They rang in his brain. He tried to keep step with their monotone.  The storm could not drown them. They were meaningless words to him now,  but they kept him company. Also, his rifle was meaningless, but he  clung to it. The pack on his back held no significance and no weight  for him. He might have travelled a mile or ten miles an hour and he  would not have sensed the difference. Most men would have buried  themselves in the snow, and died in comfort, dreaming the pleasant  dreams which come as a sort of recompense to the unfortunate who die of  starvation and cold. But the fighting spark commanded Roscoe to die  upon his feet, if he died at all. It was this spark which brought him  at last to a bit of timber thick enough to give him shelter from wind  and snow. It burned a little more warmly then. It flared up, and gave  him new vision. And, for the first time, he realized that it must be  night. For a light was burning ahead of him, and all else was gloom.  His first thought was that it was a campfire, miles and miles away.  Then it drew nearer&#8212;until he knew that it was a light in a cabin  window. He dragged himself toward it, and when he came to the door he  tried to shout. But no sound fell from his swollen lips. It seemed an  hour before he could twist his feet out of his snowshoes. Then he  groped for a latch, pressed against the door, and plunged in.
  What he saw was like a picture suddenly revealed for an instant by a  flashlight. In the cabin there were four men. Two sat at a table,  directly in front of him. One held a dice box poised in the air, and  had turned a rough, bearded face toward him. The other was a younger  man, and in this moment of lapsing consciousness it struck Roscoe as  strange that he should be clutching a can of beans between his hands. A  third man stared from where he had been looking down upon the dice-play  of the other two. As Roscoe came in he was in the act of lowering a  half-filled bottle from his lips. The fourth man sat on the edge of a  bunk, with a face so white and thin that he might have been taken for a  corpse if it had not been for a dark glare in his sunken eyes. Roscoe  smelled the odor of whisky; he smelled food. He saw no sign of welcome  in the faces turned toward him, but he advanced upon them, mumbling  incoherently. And then the spark&#8212;the fighting spark in him&#8212;gave out,  and he crumpled down on the floor. He heard a voice, which came to  him&#8212;as if from a great distance, and which said, &#8220;Who the h&#8212;l is  this?&#8221; And then, after what seemed to be a long time, he heard another  voice say, &#8220;Pitch him back into the snow.&#8221;
  After that he lost consciousness.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  A long time before he awoke he knew that he was not in the snow, and  that hot stuff was running down his throat. When he opened his eyes  there was no longer a light burning in the cabin. It was day. He felt  strangely comfortable, but there was something in the cabin that  stirred him from his rest. It was the odour of frying bacon. He raised  himself upon his elbow, prepared to thank his deliverers, and to eat.  All of his hunger had come back. The joy of life, of anticipation,  shone in his thin face as he pulled himself up. Another face&#8212;the  bearded face&#8212;red-eyed, almost animal-like in its fierce questioning,  bent over him.
  &#8220;Where's your grub, pardner?&#8221;
  The question was like a stab. Roscoe did not hear his own voice as  he explained.
  &#8220;Got none!&#8221; The bearded man's voice was like a bellow as he turned  upon the others.
  &#8220;He's got no grub!&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll divvy up, Jack,&#8221; came a weak voice. It was from the thin,  white-faced man who had sat corpse-like on the edge of his bunk the  night before.
  &#8220;Divvy h&#8212;l!&#8221; growled the bearded man. &#8220;It's up to you&#8212;you and  Scotty. You're to blame!&#8221;
  You're to blame!
  The words struck upon Roscoe's ears with a chill of horror. He  recalled the voice that had suggested throwing him back into the snow.  Starvation was in the cabin. He had fallen among animals instead of  men, and his body grew cold with a chill that was more horrible than  that of the snow and the wind. He saw the thin-faced man who had spoken  for him sitting again on the edge of his bunk. Mutely he looked to the  others to see which was Scotty. He was the young man who had clutched  the can of beans. It was he who was frying bacon over the sheet iron  stove.
  &#8220;We'll divvy&#8212;Henry and I,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I told you that last night.&#8221;  He looked over at Roscoe. &#8220;Glad you're better,&#8221; he greeted. &#8220;You  see&#8212;you've struck us at a bad time. We're on our last legs for grub.  Our two Indians went out to hunt a week ago and never came back.  They're dead&#8212;or gone, and we're as good as dead if the storm doesn't  let up pretty soon. You can have some of our grub&#8212;Henry's and mine.&#8221;
  It was a cold invitation, lacking warmth or sympathy, and Roscoe  felt that even this man wished that he had died before he reached the  cabin. But the man was human; he at least had not cast his voice with  those who had wanted to throw him back into the snow, and Roscoe tried  to voice his gratitude, and at the same time to hide his hunger. He saw  that there were three thin slices of bacon in the frying pan, and it  struck him that it would be bad taste to reveal a starvation appetite  in the face of such famine. He came up, limping, and stood on the other  side of the stove from Scotty.
  &#8220;You saved my life,&#8221; he said, holding out a hand. &#8220;Will you shake?&#8221;
  Scotty shook hands limply.
  &#8220;It's h&#8212;l,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;We'd have had beans this  morning if I hadn't shook dice with him last night.&#8221; He nodded toward  the bearded man, who was cutting open the top of a can. &#8220;He won!&#8221;
  &#8220;My God!&#8221; began Roscoe.
  He didn't finish. Scotty turned the meat, and added:
  &#8220;He won a square meal off me yesterday&#8212;a quarter of a pound of  bacon. Day before that he won Henry's last can of beans. He's got his  share under his blanket over there, and swears he'll shoot any one who  goes to monkeying with his bed&#8212;so you'd better fight shy of it.  Thompson&#8212;he isn't up yet&#8212;chose the whisky for<I> his</I> share, so  you'd better fight shy of him, too. Henry and I'll divvy up with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Roscoe, the one word choking him.
  Henry came from his bunk, bent and wobbling. He looked like a dying  man, and for the first time Roscoe saw that his hair was gray. He was a  little man, and his thin hands shook as he held them out over the  stove, and nodded at Roscoe. The bearded man had opened his can, and  approached the stove with a pan of water, coming in beside Roscoe  without noticing him. He brought with him a foul odour of stale tobacco  smoke and whisky. After he had put his water over the fire he turned to  one of the bunks and with half a dozen coarse epithets roused Thompson,  who sat up stupidly, still half drunk. Henry had gone to a small table,  and Scotty followed him with the bacon. But Roscoe did not move. He  forgot his hunger. His pulse was beating quickly. Sensations filled him  which he had never known or imagined before. He had known tragedy; he  had investigated to what he had supposed to be the depths of human  vileness&#8212;but this that he was experiencing now stunned him. Was it  possible that these were people of his own kind? Had a madness of some  sort driven all human instincts from them? He saw Thompson's red eyes  fastened upon him, and he turned his face to escape their questioning,  stupid leer. The bearded man was turning out the can of beans he had  won from Scotty. Beyond the bearded man the door creaked, and Roscoe  heard the wail of the storm. It came to him now as a friendly sort of  sound.
  &#8220;Better draw up, pardner,&#8221; he heard Scotty say. &#8220;Here's your share.&#8221;
  One of the thin slices of bacon and a hard biscuit were waiting for  him on a tin plate. He ate as ravenously as Henry and Scotty, and drank  a cup of hot tea. In two minutes the meal was over. It was terribly  inadequate. The few mouthfuls of food stirred up all his craving, and  he found it impossible to keep his eyes from the bearded man and his  beans. The bearded man, whom Scotty called Croker, was the only one who  seemed well fed, and his horror increased when Henry bent over and said  to him in a low whisper: &#8220;He didn't get my beans fair. I had three aces  and a pair of deuces, an' he took it on three fives and two sixes. When  I objected he called me a liar an' hit me. Them's my beans, or  Scotty's!&#8221; There was something almost like murder in the little man's  red eyes.
  Roscoe remained silent. He did not care to talk, or question. No one  had asked him who he was or whence he came, and he felt no inclination  to know more of the men he had fallen among. Croker finished, wiped his  mouth with his hand, and looked across at Roscoe.
  &#8220;How about going out with me to get some wood?&#8221; he demanded.
  &#8220;I'm ready,&#8221; replied Roscoe.
  For the first time he took notice of himself. He was lame, and  sickeningly weak, but apparently sound in other ways. The intense cold  had not frozen his ears or feet. He put on his heavy moccasins, his  thick coat and fur cap, and Croker pointed to his rifle.
  &#8220;Better take that along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Can't tell what you might see.&#8221;
  Roscoe picked it up and the pack which lay beside it. He did not  catch the ugly leer which the bearded man turned upon Thompson. But  Henry did, and his little eyes grew smaller and blacker. On snowshoes  the two men went out into the storm, Croker carrying an axe. He led the  way through the bit of thin timber, and across a wide open over which  the storm swept so fiercely that their trail was covered behind them as  they travelled. Roscoe figured that they had gone a quarter of a mile  when they came to another clump of trees, and Croker gave him the axe.
  &#8220;You can cut down some of this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's better burning than  that back there. I'm going on for a dry log that I know of. You wait  until I come back.&#8221;
  Roscoe set to work upon a spruce, but he could scarcely strike out a  chip. After a little he was compelled to drop his axe, and lean against  the tree, exhausted. At intervals he resumed his cutting. It was half  an hour before the small tree fell. Then he waited for Croker. Behind  him his trail was already obliterated. After a little he raised his  voice and called for Croker. There was no reply. The wind moaned above  him in the spruce tops. It made a noise like the wash of the sea out on  the open Barren. He shouted again. And again. The truth dawned upon him  slowly&#8212;but it came. Croker had brought him out purposely&#8212;to lose him.  He was saving the bacon and the cold biscuits back in the cabin.  Roscoe's hands clenched tightly, and then they relaxed. At last he had  found what he was after&#8212;his book! It would be a terrible book, if he  carried out the idea that flashed upon him now in the wailing and  twisting of the storm. And then he laughed, for it occurred to him  quickly that the idea would die&#8212;with himself. He might find the cabin,  but he would not make the effort. Once more he would fight alone and  for himself. The Spark returned to him, loyally. He buttoned himself up  closely, saw that his snowshoes were securely fastened, and struck out  once more with his back to the storm. He was at least a trifle better  off for meeting with the flesh and blood of his kind.
  The clump of timber thinned out, and Roscoe struck out boldly into  the low bush. As he went, he wondered what would happen in the cabin.  He believed that Henry, of the four, would not pull through alive, and  that Croker would come out best. It was not until the following summer  that he learned the facts of Henry's madness, and of the terrible  manner in which he avenged himself on Croker by sticking a knife under  the latter's ribs.
  For the first time in his life Roscoe found himself in a position to  measure accurately the amount of energy contained in a slice of bacon  and a cold biscuit. It was not much. Long before noon his old weakness  was upon him again. He found even greater difficulty in dragging his  feet over the snow, and it seemed now as though all ambition had left  him, and that even the fighting spark was becoming disheartened. He  made up his mind to go on until the arctic gloom of night began  mingling with the storm; then he would stop, build a fire, and go to  sleep in its warmth. He would never wake up, and there would be no  sensation of discomfort in his dying.
  During the afternoon he passed out of the scrub into a rougher  country. His progress was slower, but more comfortable, for at times he  found himself protected from the wind. A gloom darker and more sombre  than that of the storm was falling about him when he came to what  appeared to be the end of the Barren. The earth dropped away from under  his feet, and far below him, in a ravine shut out from wind and storm,  he saw the black tops of thick spruce. What life was left in him leaped  joyously, and he began to scramble downward. His eyes were no longer  fit to judge distance or chance, and he slipped. He slipped a dozen  times in the first five minutes, and then there came the time when he  did not make a recovery, but plunged down the side of the mountain like  a rock. He stopped with a terrific jar, and for the first time during  the fall he wanted to cry out with pain. But the voice that he heard  did not come from his own lips. It was another voice&#8212;and then two,  three, many of them. His dazed eyes caught glimpses of dark objects  floundering in the deep snow about him, and just beyond these objects  were four or five tall mounds of snow, like tents, arranged in a  circle. A number of times that winter Roscoe had seen mounds of snow  like these, and he knew what they meant. He had fallen into an Indian  village. He tried to call out the words of greeting that Rameses had  taught him, but he had no tongue. Then the floundering figures caught  him up, and he was carried to the circle of snow-mounds. The last that  he knew was that warmth was entering his lungs, and that once again  there came to him the low, sweet music of a Cree girl's voice.
  It was a face that he first saw after that, a face that seemed to  come to him slowly from out of night, approaching nearer and nearer  until he knew that it was a girl's face, with great, dark, shining eyes  whose lustre suffused him with warmth and a strange happiness. It was a  face of wonderful beauty, he thought&#8212;of a wild sort of beauty, yet  with something so gentle in the shining eyes that he sighed restfully.  In these first moments of his returning consciousness the whimsical  thought came to him that he was dying, and the face was a part of a  pleasant dream. If that were not so he had fallen at last among  friends. His eyes opened wider, he moved, and the face drew back.  Movement stimulated returning life, and reason rehabilitated itself in  great bounds. In a dozen flashes he went over all that had happened up  to the point where he had fallen down the mountain and into the Cree  camp. Straight above him he saw a funnel-like peak through which there  drifted a blue film of smoke. He was in a wigwam. It was warm and  exceedingly comfortable. Wondering if he was hurt, he moved. The  movement drew a sharp exclamation of pain from him. It was the first  real sound he had made, and in an instant the face was over him again.  He saw it plainly this time, with its dark eyes and oval cheeks framed  between two great braids of black hair. A hand touched his brow cool  and gentle, and a sweet voice soothed him in half a dozen musical  words. The girl was a Cree.
  At the sound of her voice an Indian woman came up beside her, looked  down at Roscoe for a moment, and then went to the door of the wigwam,  speaking in a low voice to some one who was outside. When she returned  a man followed in after her. He was old and bent, and his face was  thin. His cheek-bones shone, so tightly was the skin drawn over them.  And behind him came a younger man, as straight as a tree, with strong  shoulders, and a head set like a piece of bronze sculpture. Roscoe  thought of Ransom and of his words about old Rameses:
  &#8220;You will find something in his face which will recall what I have  said, and make you think of the First People.&#8221;
  The second man carried in his hand a frozen fish, which he gave to  the woman. And as he gave it to her he spoke words in Cree which Roscoe  understood.
  &#8220;It is the last fish.&#8221;
  For a moment some terrible hand gripped at Roscoe's heart and  stopped its beating. He saw the woman take the fish and cut it into two  equal parts with a knife, and one of these parts he saw her drop into a  pot of boiling water which hung over the stone fireplace built under  the vent in the wall. The girl went up and stood beside the older  woman, with her back turned to him. He opened his eyes wide, and  stared. The girl was tall and slender, as lithely and as beautifully  formed as one of the northern lilies that thrust their slender stems  from between the mountain rocks. Her two heavy braids fell down her  back almost to her knees. And this girl, the woman, the two men<I> were  dividing with him their last fish</I>!
  He made an effort and sat up. The younger man came to him, and put a  bear skin at his back. He had picked up some of the patois of  half-blood French and English.
  &#8220;You seek,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you hurt&#8212;you hungr'. You have eat soon.&#8221;
  He motioned with his hand to the boiling pot. There was not a ficker  of animation in his splendid face. There was something godlike in his  immobility, something that was awesome in the way he moved and  breathed. His voice, too, it seemed to Roscoe, was filled with the old,  old mystery of the beginning of things, of history that was long dead  and lost for all time. And it came upon Roscoe now, like a flood of  rare knowledge descending from a mysterious source, that he had at last  discovered the key to new life, and that through the blindness of  reason, through starvation and death, fate had led him to the Great  Truth that was dying with the last sons of the First People. For the  half of the last fish was brought to him, and he ate; and when the  knowledge that he was eating life away from these people choked him,  and he thrust a part of it back, the girl herself urged him to  continue, and he finished, with her dark, glorious eyes fixed upon him  and sending warm floods through his veins. And after that the men  bolstered him up with the bear skin, and the two went out again into  the storm. The woman sat hunched before the fire, and after a little  the girl joined her and piled fresh fagots on the blaze. Then she sat  beside her, with her chin resting in the little brown palms of her  hands, the fire lighting up a half profile of her face and painting  rich colour in her deep-black hair.
  For a long time there was silence, and Roscoe lay as if he were  asleep. It was not an ordinary silence, the silence of a still room, or  of emptiness&#8212;but a silence that throbbed and palpitated with an  unheard life, a silence which was thrilling because it spoke a language  which Roscoe was just beginning to understand. The fire grew redder,  and the cone-shaped vacancy at the top of the tepee grew duskier, so  Roscoe knew that night was falling outside. Far above he could hear the  storm wailing over the top of the mountain. Redder and redder grew the  birch flame that lighted up the profile of the girl's face. Once she  turned, so that he caught the lustrous darkness of her eyes upon him.  He could not hear the breath of the two in front of the fire. He heard  no sound outside except that of the wind and the trees, and all grew as  dark as it was silent in the snow-covered tepee, except in front of the  fire. And then, as he lay with wide-open eyes, it seemed to Roscoe as  though the stillness was broken by a sob that was scarcely more than a  sigh, and he saw the girl's head droop a little lower in her hands, and  fancied that a shuddering tremor ran through her slender shoulders. The  fire burned low, and she reached out for more fagots. Then she rose  slowly, and turned toward him. She could not see his face in the gloom,  but the deep breathing which he feigned drew her to him, and through  his half-closed eyes he could see her face bending over him, until one  of her heavy braids slipped over her shoulder and fell upon his breast.  After a moment she sat down silently beside him, and he felt her  fingers brush gently through his tangled hair. Something in their  light, soft touch thrilled him, and he moved his hand in the darkness  until it came in contact with the big, soft braid that still lay where  it had fallen across him. He was on the point of speaking, but the  fingers left his hair and stroked as gentle as velvet over his  storm-beaten face. She believed that he was asleep, and a warm flood of  shame swept through him at the thought of his hypocrisy. The birch  flared up suddenly, and he saw the glisten of her hair, the glow of her  eyes, and the startled change that came into them when she saw that his  own eyes were wide open, and looking up at her. Before she could move  he had caught her hand, and was holding it tighter to his face&#8212;against  his lips. The birch bark died as suddenly as it had flared up; he heard  her breathing quickly, he saw her great eyes melt away like lustrous  stars into the returning gloom, and a wild, irresistible impulse moved  him. He raised his free hand to the dark head, and drew it down to him,  holding it against his feverish face while he whispered Rameses's  prayer of thankfulness in Cree:
  &#8220;The spirits bless you forever,<I> Meeani</I>.&#8221;
  The nearness of her, the touch of her heavy hair, the caress of her  breath stirred him still more deeply with the strange, new emotion that  was born in him, and in the darkness he found and kissed a pair of  lips, soft and warm.
  The woman stirred before the fire. The girl drew back, her breath  coming almost sobbingly. And then the thought of what he had done  rushed in a flood of horror upon Roscoe. These wild people had saved  his life; they had given him to eat of their last fish; they were  nursing him back from the very threshold of death&#8212;and he had already  repaid them by offering to the Cree maiden next to the greatest insult  that could come to her people. He remembered what Rameses had told  him&#8212;that the Cree girl's first kiss was her betrothal kiss; that it  was the white garment of her purity, the pledge of her fealty forever.  He lifted himself upon his elbow, but the girl had run to the door.  Voices came from outside, and the two men reentered the tepee. He  understood enough of what was said to learn that the camp had been  holding council, and that two men were about to make an effort to reach  the nearest post. Each tepee was to furnish these two men a bit of food  to keep them alive on their terrible hazard, and the woman brought  forth the half of a fish. She cut it into quarters, and with one of the  pieces the elder man went out again into the night. The younger man  spoke to the girl. He called her Oachi, and to Roscoe's astonishment  spoke in French.
  &#8220;If they do not come back, or if we do not find meat in seven days,&#8221;  he said, &#8220;we will die.&#8221;
  Roscoe made an effort to rise, and the effort sent a rush of fire  into his head. He turned dizzy, and fell back with a groan. In an  instant the girl was at his side&#8212;ahead of the man. Her hands were at  his face, her eyes glowing again. He felt that he was falling into a  deep sleep. But the eyes did not leave him. They were wonderful eyes,  glorious eyes! He dreamed of them in the strange sleep that came to  him, and they grew more and more beautiful, shining with a light which  thrilled him even in his unconsciousness. After a time there came a  black, more natural sort of night to him. He awoke from it refreshed.  It was day. The tepee was filled with light, and for the first time he  looked about him. He was alone. A fire burned low among the stones;  over it simmered a pot. The earth floor of the tepee was covered with  deer and caribou skins, and opposite him there was another bunk. He  drew himself painfully to a sitting posture and found that it was his  shoulder and hip that hurt him. He rose to his feet, and stood  balancing himself feebly when the door to the tepee was drawn back and  Oachi entered. At sight of him, standing up from his bed, she made a  quick movement to draw back, but Roscoe reached out his hands with a  low cry of pleasure.
  &#8220;Oachi,&#8221; he cried softly. &#8220;Come in!&#8221; He spoke in French, and Oachi's  face lighted up like sunlight. &#8220;I am better,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am well. I  want to thank you&#8212;and the others.&#8221; He made a step toward her, and the  strength of his left leg gave way. He would have fallen if she had not  darted to him so quickly that she made a prop for him, and her eyes  looked up into his whitened face, big and frightened and filled with  pain.
  &#8220;Oo-ee-ee,&#8221; she said in Cree, her red lips rounded as she saw him  flinch, and that one word, a song in a word; came to him like a flute  note.
  &#8220;It hurts&#8212;a little,&#8221; he said. He dropped back on his bunk, and  Oachi sank upon the skins at his feet, looking up at him steadily with  her wonderful, pure eyes, her mouth still rounded, little wrinkles of  tense anxiety drawn in her forehead. Roscoe laughed.
  For a few moments his soul was filled with a strange gladness. He  reached out his hand and stroked it over her shining hair, and a  radiance such as he had never seen leapt into her eyes.  &#8220;You&#8212;talk&#8212;French?&#8221; he asked slowly.
  She nodded.
  &#8220;Then tell me this&#8212;you are hungry&#8212;starving?&#8221;
  She nodded again, and made a cup of her two small hands. &#8220;No meat.  This little&#8212;so much&#8212;flour&#8212;&#8221; Her throat trembled and her voice  fluttered. But even as she measured out their starvation her face was  looking at him joyously. And then she added, with the gladness of a  child, &#8220;<I>Feesh</I>, for you,&#8221; and pointed to the simmering pot.
  &#8220;For<I> ME</I>!&#8221; Roscoe looked at the pot, and then back at her.
  &#8220;Oachi,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;go tell your father that I am ready to  talk with him. Ask him to come&#8212;now.&#8221;
  She looked at him for a moment as though she did not quite  understand what he had said, and he repeated the words. Even as he was  speaking he marvelled at the fairness of her skin, which shone with a  pink flush, and at the softness and beauty of her hair. What he saw  impelled him to ask, as she made to rise:
  &#8220;Your father&#8212;your mother&#8212;is French. Is that so, Oachi?&#8221; The girl  nodded again, with the soft little Cree throat note that meant yes.  Then she slipped to her feet and ran out, and a little later there came  into the tepee the man who had first loomed up in the dusky light like  a god of the First People to Roscoe Cummins. His splendid face was a  little more gaunt than the night before, and Roscoe knew that famine  came hand in hand with him. He had seen starvation before, and he knew  that it reddened the eyes and gave the lips a grayish pallor. These  things, and more, he saw in Oachi's father. But Mukoki came in straight  and erect, hiding his weakness under the pride of his race. Fighting  down his pain Roscoe rose at sight of him and held out his hands.
  &#8220;I want to thank you,&#8221; he said, repeating the words he had spoken to  Oachi. &#8220;You have saved my life. But I have eyes, and I can see. You  gave me of your last fish. You have no meat. You have no flour. You are  starving. What? I have asked you to come and tell me, so that I may  know how it fares with your women and children. You will give me a  council, and we will smoke.&#8221; Roscoe dropped back on his bunk. He drew  forth his pipe and filled it with tobacco. The Cree sat down mutely in  the centre of the tepee. They smoked, passing the pipe back and forth  without speaking. Once Roscoe loaded the pipe, and once the chief; and  when the last puff of the last pipeful was taken the Indian reached  over his hand, and Roscoe gripped it hard.
  And then, while the storm still moaned far up over their heads,  Roscoe Cummins listened to the old, old story of the First People&#8212;the  story of starvation and of death. To him it was epic. It was terrible.  But to the other it was the mere coming and going of a natural thing,  of a thing that had existed for him and for his kind since life began,  and he spoke of it quietly and without a gesture. There had been a camp  of twenty-two, and there were now fifteen. Seven had died, four men,  two women, and one child. Each day during the great storm the men had  gone out on their futile search for game, and every few days one of  them had failed to return. Thus four had died. The dogs were eaten.  Corn and fish were gone; there remained but a little flour, and this  was for the women and the children. The men had eaten nothing but bark  and roots for five days. And there seemed to be no hope. It was death  to stray far from the camp. That morning the two men had set out for  the post, but Mukoki said calmly that they would never return. And then  Roscoe spoke of Oachi, his daughter, and for the first time the iron  lines of the chief's bronze face seemed to soften, and his head bent  over a little, and his shoulders drooped. Not until then did Roscoe  learn the depths of sorrow hidden behind the splendid strength of the  starving man. Oachi's mother had been a French woman. Six months before  she had died in this tepee, and Mukoki had buried his wife up on the  face of the mountain, where the storm was moaning. After this Roscoe  could not speak. He was choking. He loaded his pipe again, and sat down  close to the chief, so that their knees and their shoulders touched,  and thus, as taught him by old Rameses, he smoked with Oachi's father  the pledge of eternal friendship, of brotherhood in life, of spirit  communion in the Valley of Silent Men. After that Mukoki left him and  he crawled back upon his bunk, weak and filled with pain, knowing that  he was facing death with the others. He was not afraid, but was filled  with a great thankfulness that, even at the price of starvation, fate  had allowed him to touch at last the edge of the fabric of his dreams.  All of that day he wrote, in the hours when he felt best. He filled  page after page of the tablets which he carried in his pack, writing  feverishly and with great haste, oppressed only by the fear that he  would not be able to finish the message which he had for the people of  that other world a thousand miles away. Three times during the morning  Oachi came in and brought him the cooked fish and a biscuit which she  had made for him out of flour and meal. And each time he said, &#8220;I am a  man with the other men, Oachi. I would be a woman if I ate.&#8221;
  The third time Oachi knelt close down at his side, and when he  refused the food again there came a strange light into her eyes, and  she said, &#8220;If you starve&#8212;I starve!&#8221;
  It was the first revelation to him. He put up his hands. They  touched her face. Some potent spirit in him carried him across all  gulfs. In that moment, thrilling, strange, he was heart and soul of the  First People. In an instant he had drifted back a thousand years,  beyond the memory of cities, of clubs, of all that went with  civilization. A wild, half savage longing filled him. One of his hands  slipped to her shining hair, and suddenly their faces lay close to each  other, and he knew that in that moment love had come to him from the  fount of glory itself.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  Days followed&#8212;black days filled with the endless terrors of the  storm. And yet they were days of a strange contentment which Roscoe had  never felt before. Oachi and her father were with him a great deal in  the tepee which they had given up to him. On the third day Roscoe  noticed that Oachi's little hands were bruised and red and he found  that the chief's daughter had gone out to dig down through ice and snow  with the other women after roots. The camp lived entirely on roots  now&#8212;wild flag and moose roots ground up and cooked in a batter. On  this same day, late in the afternoon, there came a low wailing grief  from one of the tepees, a moaning sound that pitched itself to the key  of the storm until it seemed to be a part of it. A child had died, and  the mother was mourning. That night another of the camp huntsmen failed  to return at dusk.
  The next day Roscoe was able to move about in his tepee without  pain. Oachi and her father were with him when, for the first time, he  got out his comb and military brushes and began grooming his touselled  hair. Oachi watched him, and suddenly, seeing the wondering pleasure in  her eyes, he held out the brushes to her. &#8220;You may have them, Oachi,&#8221;  he said, and the girl accepted them with a soft little cry of delight.  To his amazement she began unbraiding her hair immediately, and then  she stood up before him, hidden to her knees in her wonderful wealth of  shining tresses, and Roscoe Cummins thought in this moment that he had  never seen a woman more beautiful than the half Cree girl. When they  had gone he still saw her, and the vision troubled him. They came in  again at night, when the fire was sending red and yellow lights up and  down the tepee walls, and the more he watched Oachi the stronger there  grew within him something that seemed to gnaw and gripe with a dull  sort of pain. Oachi was beautiful. He had never seen hair like her  hair. He had never before seen eyes more beautiful. He had never heard  a voice so low and sweet and filled with bird-like ripples of music.  She was beautiful, and yet with her beauty there was a primitiveness, a  gentle savagery, and an age-old story written in the fine lines of her  face which made him uneasy with the thought of a thing that was almost  tragedy. Oachi loved him. He could see that love in her eyes, in her  movement; he could feel it in her presence, and the sweet song of it  trembled in her voice when she spoke to him. Ordinarily a white man  would have accepted this love; he would have rejoiced in it, and would  have played with it for a time, as they have done with the loves of the  women of Oachi's people since the beginning of white man's time. But  Roscoe Cummins was of a different type. He was a man of ideals, and in  Oachi's love he saw his ideal of love set apart from him by illimitable  voids. This night, in the firelit tepee, there came to him like a  painful stab the truth of Ransom's words. He had been born some  thousands of years too late. He saw in Oachi love and life as they  might have been for him; but beyond them he also saw, like a grim and  threatening hand, a vision of cities, of toiling millions, of a great  work just begun&#8212;a vision of life as it was intended that he should  live it; and to shut it out from him he bowed his head in his two  hands, overwhelmed by a new grief.
  The chief sat with his face to the fire, smoking silently, and Oachi  came to Roscoe's side, and touched hands timidly, like a little child.  She seemed to him wondrously like a child when he lifted his head and  looked down into her face. She smiled at him, questioning him, and he  smiled his answer back, yet neither broke the silence with words. He  heard only the soft little note in Oachi's throat that filled him with  such an exquisite sensation, and he wondered what music would be if it  could find expression through a voice like hers.
  &#8220;Oachi,&#8221; he asked softly, &#8220;why did you never sing?&#8221;
  The girl looked at him in silence for a moment.
  &#8220;We starve,&#8221; she said. She swept her hand toward the door of the  tepee. &#8220;We starve&#8212;die&#8212;there is no song.&#8221;
  He put his hand under her chin and lifted her face to him, as he  might have done with a little child.
  &#8220;I wish you would sing, Oachi,&#8221; he said.
  For a moment the girl's dark eyes glowed up at him. Then she drew  back softly, and seated herself before the fire, with her back turned  toward him, close beside her father. A strange quiet filled the tepee.  Over their heads the wailing storm seemed to die for a moment; and then  something rose in its place, so low and gentle at first that it seemed  like a whisper, but growing in sweetness and volume until Roscoe  Cummins sat erect, his eyes flashing, his hands clenched, looking at  Oachi. The storm rose, and with it the song&#8212;a song that reached down  into his soul, stirring him now with its gladness, now with a half  savage pain; but always with a sweetness that engulfed for him all  other things, until he was listening only to the voice. And then  silence came again within the tepee. Over the mountain the wind burst  more fiercely. The chief sat motionless. In Oachi's hair the firelight  glistened with a dull radiance. There was quiet, and yet Roscoe still  heard the voice. He knew that he would always hear it, that it would  never die.
  Not until long afterward did he know that Oachi had sung to him the  great love song of the Crees.
  That night and the next day, and the terrible night and day that  followed, Roscoe fought with himself. He won&#8212;when alone&#8212;and lost when  Oachi was with him. In some ways she knew intuitively that he loved to  see her with her splendid hair down, and she would sit at his feet and  brush it, while he tried to hide his admiration and smother the passion  which sprang up in his breast when she was near. He knew, in these  moments, that it was too late to kill the thing that was born in  him&#8212;the craving of his heart and his soul for this girl of the First  People who had laid her life at his feet and who was removed from him  by barriers which he could never pass. On the afternoon of his seventh  day in camp an Indian hunter ran in from the forest nearly crazed with  joy. He had ventured farther away than the others, and had found a  moose-yard. He had killed two of the animals. The days of famine were  over. Oachi brought the first news to Roscoe. Her face was radiant with  joy, her eyes burned like stars, and in her excitement she stretched  out her arms to him as she cried out the wonderful news. Roscoe took  her two hands.
  &#8220;Is it true, Oachi?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;They have surely killed meat?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;yes&#8212;yes,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;They have killed meat&#8212;much meat&#8212;&#8221;
  She stopped at the strange, hard look in Roscoe's eyes. He was  looking overhead. If he had looked down, into the glory and love of her  eyes, he would have swept her close in his arms, and the last fight  would have been over then and there. Oachi went out, wondering at the  coldness with which he had received the word of their deliverance, and  little guessing that in that moment he had fought the greatest battle  of his life. Each day after this called him back to the fight. His two  broken ribs healed slowly. The storm passed. The sun followed it, and  the March winds began bringing up warmth from the south. Days grew into  weeks, and the snow was growing soft underfoot before he dared venture  forth short distances from the camp alone. He tried often to make Oachi  understand, but he always stopped short of what he meant to say; his  hand would steal to her beautiful hair, and in Oachi's throat would  sound the inimitable little note of happiness. Each day he was more and  more handicapped. For in the joy of her great love Oachi became more  beautiful and her voice still sweeter. By the time the snows began  running down from the mountains and the poplar buds began to swell she  was telling him the most sacred of all sacred things, and one day she  told him of the wonderful world far to the west, painted by the glow of  the setting sun, wherein lay the Valley of Silent Men.
  &#8220;And that is Heaven&#8212;your Heaven,&#8221; breathed Roscoe. He was almost  well now, but he was sitting on the edge of his bunk, and Oachi knelt  in the old place upon the deer skin at his feet. As he spoke he stroked  her hair.
  &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what sort of a place it is, Oachi.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; spoke Oachi softly.
  &#8220;Long, long ago the Great God came down among us and lived for a  time; and He came at a time like that which has just passed, and He saw  suffering, and hunger, and death. And when He saw what life was He made  for us another world, and told us that it should be called the Valley  of Silent Men; and that when we died we would go to this place, and  that at last&#8212;when all of our race were gone&#8212;He would cause the earth  to roll three times, and in the Valley of Silent Men all would awaken  into life which would never know death, or sorrow, or pain again. And  He says that those who love will awaken there&#8212;hand in hand.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; said Roscoe. He felt himself trembling. Oachi's  breath was against his hand. It was his last fight. He half reached  out, as if to clasp her to him; but beyond her he still saw the other  thing&#8212;the other world. He rose to his feet, not daring to look at her  now. He loved her too much to sacrifice her. And it would be a  sacrifice. He tried to speak firmly.
  &#8220;Oachi,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am nearly well enough to travel now. I have  spent pleasant weeks with you, weeks which I shall never forget. But it  is time for me to go back to my people. They are expecting me. They are  waiting for me, and wondering at my absence. I am as you would be if  you were down there in a great city. So I must go. I must go to-morrow,  or the next day, or soon after. Oachi&#8212;&#8221;
  He still looked where he could not see her face. But he heard her  move. He knew that slowly she was drawing away.
  &#8220;Oachi&#8212;&#8221;
  She was near the door now, and his eyes turned toward her. She was  looking back, her slender shoulders bent over, her glorious hair  rippling to her knees, as she had left it undone for him. In her eyes  was love such as falls from the heavens. But her face was as white as a  mask.
  &#8220;Oachi!&#8221;
  With a cry Roscoe reached out his arms. But Oachi was gone. At last  the Cree girl understood.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  Three days later there came in the passing of a single day and night  the splendour of northern spring. The sun rose warm and golden. From  the sides of the mountains and in the valleys water poured forth in  rippling, singing floods. There bakneesh glowed on bared rocks.  Moose-birds, and jays, and wood-thrushes flitted about the camp, and  the air was filled with the fragrant smells of new life bursting from  earth, and tree, and shrub. On this morning of the third day Roscoe  strode forth from his tepee, with his pack upon his back. An Indian  guide waited for him outside. He had smoked his last pipe with the  chief, and now he went from tepee to tepee, in the fashion of the  Crees, and drew a single puff from the pipe of each master, until there  was but one tepee left, and in that was Oachi. With a white face he  rubbed his hand over the deer-flap, and waited. Slowly it was drawn  back, and Oachi came out. He had not seen her since the night he had  driven her from him, and he had planned to say things in this last  moment which he might have said then. But words stumbled on his lips.  Oachi was changed. She seemed taller. Her beautiful eyes looked at him  clearly and proudly. For the first time she was to him Oachi, the &#8220;Sun  Child,&#8221; a princess of the First People&#8212;the daughter of a Cree chief.  He held out his hand, and the hand which Oachi gave to him was cold and  lifeless. She smiled when he told her that he had come to say good-bye,  and when she spoke to him her voice was as clear as the stream singing  through the canon. His own voice trembled. In spite of his mightiest  effort a tightening fist seemed choking him.
  &#8220;I am coming back&#8212;some day,&#8221; he managed.
  Oachi smiled, with the glory of the morning sun in her eyes and  hair. She turned, still smiling, and pointed far to the west.
  &#8220;And some day&#8212;the Valley of Silent Men will awaken,&#8221; she said, and  reentered her father's tepee.
  Out of the camp staggered Roscoe Cummins behind his Indian guide, a  blinding heat in his eyes. Once or twice a gulping sob rose in his  throat, and he clutched hard at his heart to beat himself into  submission to the great law of life as it had been made for him.
  An hour later the two came to a stream where there was a canoe.  Because of rapids and the fierceness of the spring floods, portages  were many, and progress slow during the whole of that day. They had  made twenty miles when the sun began sinking in the west, and they  struck camp. After their supper of meat the Cree rolled himself in his  blanket and slept. But for long hours Roscoe sat beside their fire.  Night dropped about him, a splendid night filled with sweet breaths and  stars and a new moon, and with strange sounds which came to him now in  a language which he was beginning to understand. From far away there  floated faintly to his ears the lonely cry of a wolf, and it no longer  made him shudder, but filled him with the mysterious longing of the cry  itself. It was the mate-song of the beast of prey, sending up its  message to the stars&#8212;crying out to all the wilderness for a response  to its loneliness. Night birds twittered about him. A loon laughed in  its mocking joy. An owl hooted down at him from the black top of a tall  spruce. From out of starvation and death the wilderness had awakened.  Its sounds spoke to him still of grief, of the suffering that would  never know end; and yet there trembled in them a note of happiness and  of content. Beside the campfire it came to him that in this world he  had discovered two things&#8212;a suffering that he had never known, and a  peace he had never known. And Oachi stood for them both. He thought of  her until drowsiness drew a pale film over his eyes. The birch crackled  more and more faintly in the fire and sounds died away. The stillness  of sleep fell about him. Scarce had he fallen into slumber than his  eyes seemed to open wide and wakeful, and out of the gloom beyond the  smouldering fire he saw a human form slowly revealing itself, until  there stood clearly within his vision a figure which he at first took  to be that of Mukoki, the chief. But in another moment he saw that it  was even taller than the tall chief, and that its eyes had searched him  out. When he heard a voice, speaking in Cree the words which mean,  &#8220;Whither goest thou?&#8221; he was startled to hear his own voice reply: &#8220;I  am going back to my people.&#8221;
  He stared into vacancy, for at the sound of his voice the vision  faded away; but there came a voice to him back through the night, which  said: &#8220;And it is here that you have found that of which you have  dreamed&#8212;Life, and the Valley of Silent Men!&#8221;
  Roscoe was wide awake now. The voice and the vision had seemed so  real to him that he looked about him tremblingly into the starlit gloom  of the forest, as if not quite sure that he had been dreaming. Then he  crawled into his balsam shelter, drew his blankets about him, and fell  asleep.
  The next day he had little to say to his Indian companion as they  made their way downstream. At each dip of their paddles a deeper  sickness seemed to enter into his heart. Life, after all, he tried to  reason, was like a tailored garment. One might have an ideal, and if  that ideal became a realization it would be found a misfit for one  reason or another. So he told himself, in spite of fill the dreams  which had urged him on in the fight for better things. There flooded  upon him now the forceful truth of what Ransom had said. His work, as  he had begun it, was at an end, his fabric of idealism had fallen into  ruins. For he had found all that was ideal&#8212;love, faith, purity, and  beauty&#8212;and he, Roscoe Cummins, the idealist, had repulsed them because  they were not dressed in the tailored fashion of his kind. He told  himself the truth with brutal directness. Before him he saw another  work in his books, but of a different kind; and each hour that passed  added to the conviction within him that at last that work would prove a  failure. He went off alone into the forest when they camped, early in  the afternoon, and thought of Oachi, who would mourn him until the end  of time. And he&#8212;could he forget? What if he had yielded to temptation,  and had taken Oachi with him? She would have come. He knew that. She  would have sacrificed herself to him forever, would have gone with him  into a life which she could not understand, and would never understand,  satisfied to live in his love alone. The old, choking hand gripped at  his heart, and yet with the pain of it there was still a rejoicing that  he had not surrendered to the temptation, that he had been strong  enough to save her.
  The last light of the setting sun cast film-like webs of yellow and  gold through the forest as he turned in the direction of camp. It was  that hour in which a wonderful quiet falls upon the wilderness, the  last minutes between night and day, when all wild life seems to shrink  in suspensive waiting for the change. Seven months had taught Roscoe a  quiet of his own. His moccasined feet made no sound. His head was bent,  his shoulders had a tired droop, and his eyes searched for nothing in  the mystery about him. His heart seemed weighted under a pressure that  had taken all life from him, and close above him, in a balsam bough, a  night bird twittered. In response to it a low cry burst from his lips,  a cry of loneliness and of grief. In that moment he saw Oachi again at  his feet; he heard the low, sweet note of love in her throat, so much  like that of the bird over his head; he saw the soft lustre of her  hair, the glory of her eyes, looking up at him from the half gloom of  the tepee, telling him that they had found their god. It was all so  near, so real for a moment, that he sprang erect, his fingers clutching  handfuls of moss. He looked toward the camp, and he saw something move  between the rock and the fire.
  It was a wolf, he thought, or perhaps a lynx, and drawing his  revolver he moved quickly and silently in its direction. The object had  disappeared behind a little clump of balsam shrub within fifty paces of  the camp, and as he drew nearer, until he was no more than ten paces  away, he wondered why it did not break cover.
  There were no trees, and it was quite light where the balsam grew.  He approached, step by step. And then, suddenly, from almost under his  hands, something darted away with a strange, human cry, turning upon  him for a single instant a face that was as white as the white stars of  early night&#8212;a face with great, glowing, half-mad eyes. It was Oachi.  His pistol dropped to the ground. His heart stopped beating. No cry, no  breath of sound, came from his paralyzed lips. And like a wild thing  Oachi was fleeing from him into the darkening depths of the forest.  Life leaped into his limbs, and he raced like mad after her, overtaking  her with a panting, joyous cry. When she saw that she was caught the  girl turned. Her hair had fallen, and swept about her shoulders and her  body. She tried to speak, but only bursting sobs came from her breast.  As she shrank from him, Roscoe saw that her clothing was in shreds, and  that her thin moccasins were almost torn from her little feet. The  truth held him for another moment stunned and speechless. Like a  lightning flash there recurred to him her last words: &#8220;And some  day&#8212;the Valley of Silent Men will awaken.&#8221; He understood&#8212;now. She had  followed him, fighting her way through swamp and forest along the  river, hiding from him, and yet keeping him company so long as her  little broken heart could urge her on. And then alone, with a last  prayer for him&#8212;<I>she had planned to kill herself</I>. He trembled.  Something wonderful happened with him, flooding his soul with day&#8212;with  a joy that descended upon him as the Hand of the Messiah must have  fallen upon the heads of the children of Samaria. With a great, glad  cry he sprang toward Oachi and caught her in his arms, crushing her  face to him, kissing her hair and her eyes and her mouth until at last  with a strange, soft cry she put her arms up about his neck and sobbed  like a little child upon his breast.
  Back in the camp the Indian waited. The white stars grew red. In the  forest the shadows deepened to the chaos of night. Once more there was  sound, the pulse and beat of a life that moves in darkness. In the camp  the Indian grew restless with the thought that Roscoe had wandered away  until he was lost. So at last he fired his rifle.
  Oachi started in Roscoe's arms.
  &#8220;You should go back&#8212;alone,&#8221; she whispered. The old, fluttering  love-note was in her voice, sweeter than the sweetest music to Roscoe  Cummins. He turned her face up, and held it between his two hands.
  &#8220;If I go there,&#8221; he said, pointing for a moment into the south, &#8220;I  go<I> alone</I>. But if I go there&#8212;&#8221; and he pointed into the north&#8212;&#8220;I  go<I> with you</I>. Oachi, my beloved, I am going with you.&#8221; He drew  her close again, and asked, almost in a whisper: &#8220;And when we awaken in  the Valley of Silent Men, how shall it be, my Oachi?&#8221;
  And with the sweet love-note, Oachi said in Cree:
  &#8220;Hand in hand, my master.&#8221;
  Hand in hand they returned to the waiting Indian and the fire.
