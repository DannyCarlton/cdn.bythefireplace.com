  Once more winter had spread its mantle over the Erie coast and the   club-rooms of the Master Mariners' Society were well patronized. It   was Thursday afternoon, nearly five o'clock. The seemingly endless   games had been discontinued for a time while the club members and   their guests gathered about the big fireplace where a huge pile of   hardwood logs had become but a great heap of glowing coals. Savoury   odours crept in from the kitchen at the end of a long hall, where   their regular weekly banquet was being prepared, to mingle with the   slowly drifting clouds that rose from a score of blackened pipes. 
  Captain John MacDonald, famed narrator of adventures on the Inland   Seas&#8212;teller of tales which were fiction only so far as he deemed it   necessary to make them really interesting&#8212;had scarcely got well   started when Jim Falkner slipped quietly in to join the group, where   he was always welcome. 
  &quot;For a third time since Joshua Phipps had poised himself on the   dizzily swinging cable-block,&quot; the captain was saying, &quot;a streak of   fire flashed through the inky blackness of the sky, and showed the   wheelman of Tow Number One the growing sea beneath him. For three   lightning flashes Joshua Phipps had stood there, half naked,   undecided, with something between a prayer and a curse upon his lips,   and fear in his heart. Thrice he had nerved himself to spring into the   seething water, and thrice his nerve had failed him. 
  &quot;A fourth lightning flash lit up the huge steel freighter ahead,   puffing steadily down Lake Huron with a million feet of lumber   dragging on behind. The man on the cable-block looked over his   shoulder at it and as the light burned out of the sky he turned his   eyes again to where the red and green lights of Tow Number Two   twinkled, a hundred fathoms back of Tow Number One. They seemed to   taunt him with his cowardice, to urge him back over the bit of sea to   a little deck cabin half buried under the cedar piles. 
  &quot;In that cabin was the only being Joshua Phipps had ever loved in  his  life, and now he pictured her there, his sweetheart still,  red-eyed as  he had left her that morning. Then he was mate of the  ship, with a  captain's berth somewhere in the future and a vision  always before him  of a certain little white-walled cottage down by the  lake,' with  honeysuckle 'n' jasmine a creepin' over it,' and with an  orchard just  at its back. That was the cottage and the orchard that  Joshua Phipps  would take his little sailor wife to, and they would  give up the hard  life of the Inland Seas together. Of these plans the  mate had been  talking, the day before, for the twentieth time, with  Nell's head very  close to his shoulder, when the captain, who was  supposed to be taking  a nap, had come over the top of the lumber and  seen them. The next  morning&#8212;that morning&#8212;the big freighter ahead had  wasted a ton of  coal by pausing for a few minutes in mid-lake. Then  Joshua Phipps had  been sent to the tow ahead, the tow that was to be  carried on to  Buffalo, while the other was to be dropped at Algonac,  three hundred  miles behind. That same day the captain of Tow Number  Two sprained a  leg, but the deposed mate was not recalled. These were  the events that  put the pirate into the heart of Joshua Phipps. 
  &quot;Once more he leaned out, wanting still the last charge of nerve to   launch himself down into the blackness of the sea. The rope that   passed from his body to a hoop on the tow-line&#8212;the rope that meant   life or death in the swift journey over the cable&#8212;he gripped in both   hands. And still before him, those little bobbing red and green eyes   at the head of Tow Number Two seemed to beckon more vehemently now as   the first edge of wind came with the approaching storm. 
  &quot;In the distance two sonorous echoes cried that a ship was coming  up,  and the whistle on the big freighter ahead answered the greeting  with  two screaming blasts. It was the night-language of ships passing  on  the unsalted seas, and the deposed mate stared again at the little   eyes on Tow Number Two and half mumbled, half thought, the bargeman's   'lines of safety': 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Green t' green <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' red t' red, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow two w'istles <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An' go ahead!' 
  &quot;Joshua Phipps emphasized the last three words&#8212;'An' go ahead!'  That  meant him. The voice of the ship shrieked at him; the bobbing,   blinking eyes of Tow Number Two invited him through the dash of spray;   and something in himself said 'Go!' 
  &quot;Another lightning flash revealed the cable-block empty, and down  into  the chop of the sea that was coming with the first breath of the  storm  shot a human form, doubled like a jack-knife, and swallowed in  an  instant where the cable end of Tow Number One dipped in a swirl of   water on its way to Tow Number Two.&quot; 
  A breathless silence filled the room as Captain MacDonald paused to   tamp his pipe and enjoy the thrill which always came to him from the   unfeigned interest shown on the faces of his little audience. 
  &quot;When one plunges into the sea with a rope about his waist, and the   other end of that rope is fastened to a steel hoop on a tow-line, it   takes only the small part of a minute to drag through a hundred   fathoms of water. For one long breath Joshua was whipped about like a   great spider; then the upward slant of the cable running to the nose   of Tow Number Two caught him, and he slipped up it on his hoop until,   half drowned but breathing free again, he reached out and hugged close   to where the tow-line cut into the cable-block of his old ship. 
  &quot;For a few moments he hung there, like a great half-drowned  water-rat.  Somewhere behind the lumber he heard the shout of a man and  then the  stumble of heavy feet near him. Huge and grotesque in the dim  glow of  a deck-lantern, the deposed mate's head and shoulders rose  above the  ship's bulwark. An arm reached over, and at the end of that  arm  something that glittered menacingly as it pointed at a shadow  swinging  with the movement of the barge. 
  &quot;'Ho, Bill&#8212;Bill-ee-ee!' called the mate; but the shadow seemed to   slip back into the blackness of the lumber piles while Phipps still   pointed to where it had disappeared. 
  &quot;'Billy, is that you?' he cried again. 'Don't be afraid, man! This  is  Josh-Josh Phipps, an' I need help!' He pulled himself over the  bulwark  as he spoke and followed where he thought the shadow had gone. 
  &quot;'I tell 'e you needn't be afraid, Billy! I fell overboard and  caught  on the cable by luck. Can't you give a man a little help?' He  had put  his pistol hand behind him and reached out to grope with the  other.  Close up against the ragged edges of the lumber piled high on  the deck  of Tow Number Two he found a man crouching. 
  &quot;'Billy, I ain't a ghost, I tell you! What you afraid of?' The mate   hauled at the invisible form, and a round fat face, white with fear,   came out into the lantern light. 
  &quot;'If it's you, Josh, an' I needn't be afraid, what the devil's that  y'  been pointing at me!' 
  &quot;From behind him the mate poked the muzzle of a revolver close up  into  the other's face. Then he shoved it into one of his wet pockets  and  drew the shivering cook of Tow Number Two back into the dense  shadow  of the lumber. 'Only this, Billy, but I ain't going to use it  on you,  &#8212;not if y' play me fair!' The mate shouted the last words as  a fresh  gust of wind screamed over the lumber. 'Billy, can y' say the  Lord's  Prayer?' 
  &quot;'I think I kin, Josh!' 
  &quot;'An' do you remember the marriage service?' 
  &quot;'I kin think it out, Josh.' 
  &quot;'See here, Billy&#8212;you wasn't lyin' when you said you was a  preacher  once?' The mate caught the cook's wrists in his hands and  bound them  with a piece of the rope from about his waist. 
  &quot;'No&#8212;no&#8212;I was a preacher, s'elp me God, I was!' 
  &quot;'I ain't going to gag you, Billy!' he shouted, for the wind came  in a  sudden roar as he spoke. 'But if you don't think out the service  by  the time I get back, or if you open your yap, I'll shoot&#8212;' 
  &quot;Phipps' voice was drowned in a thunderous clatter of lumber above,   and he finished his warning with a cold touch of the revolver. Then he   swung out into the smothering sheets of spray that were drowning the   bow-lights and clambered up the edge of the cedar piles to the top.   Amidships the blackness was like that in the sky above. He crawled   through it on all fours until the cabin lamps and the lanterns under   the wheel showed him the stern of Tow Number Two running black with   the drench of the sea. He leaped down, almost shouting with the new   joy that burned in his heart. Against a blast that beat back his   breath he struggled to the stream of light that shot across the   slippery tow from the captain's cabin. A few steps more and his naked   shoulders pressed against a door, his hand groped for a latch, and,   dripping and exhausted, he came into the presence of the captain of   Tow Number Two. 
  &quot;'Good evenin', Cap'n Wiggs&#8212;' 
  &quot;Joshua Phipps meant to round off his words with an oath. He had   planned to curse the captain before doing other things; but through   the water-mist in his eyes he saw a form kneeling beside the skipper's   berth and a face, white and terrified, stared up at him. 
  &quot;'Nell!' he cried, 'Nell&#8212;' 
  &quot;A thundering blow of the sea against the ship's side sent him   reeling. As he caught at the wall the girl sprang from the bunk, but   the powerful fingers of Captain Wiggs imprisoned her arm and she sank   back to her knees again, while Joshua Phipps, his eyes burning with   the fever that had come to him in Tow Number One, advanced slowly upon   the skipper of Tow Number Two. His hands were clenched, the muscles in   his bare arms stood out like cords, and the wounded captain drew back   in his berth and caught a sheath-knife from his pillow. The   threatening eyes of the deposed mate seemed not to notice that the   other was armed. He caught the berth-railing with a grip that made it   creak. Then he leaned over and tried to smile-but it was an ugly grin,   even for the homely face of Joshua Phipps. 
  &quot;'I said good evenin', Cap'n Wiggs!' he declared, while the captain   swallowed as if a lump in his throat had suddenly become loosened. 
  &quot;'What the devil you doing here' cried the captain, pulling himself  to  a sitting posture, pain and rage distorting his face. 
  &quot;Joshua Phipps came a step nearer, and reverentially placed one of  his  big bony hands upon the dark head of the girl at his feet. His  hand  trembled as it touched the silken tresses, but the eyes that  looked  into those of Captain Wiggs were unfaltering. 
  &quot;'I've come back for Nell, Cap'n!' 
  &quot;Another hand, warm and loving, came up to the bronzed one on the  head  of the captain's daughter. The girl was silent still, between  father  and lover, but the touch gave Phipps all the strength he  required. 
  &quot;'I've come back for Nell, Cap'n,' said the young man in a softer   voice. 'This is goin' t' be our weddin' night, and you're going to   bless us&#8212;here in this cabin!' 
  &quot;The lash of the wind and sea and the shrill whistling of the gale  in  the lumber seemed to concentrate, not to drown, the captain's  voice. 
  &quot;'This is mutiny, Josh Phipps&#8212;damned mutiny!' he almost shrieked.   'Ho, Nell, girl, call the men aft.' 
  &quot;'It's worse'n mutiny&#8212;it's piracy, Cap'n Wiggs!' cried the mate.  He  whipped the revolver from his pocket and flourished it above his  head.  'The ship's mine! There isn't a man out there to take care of  the  lumber in this blow. The wheel's tied, an' not a soul aboard to  help  you but me 'n' Nell. You're going t' marry us, or I swear we'll  all go  down together!' 
  &quot;As if to emphasize his words, there came a jar that set the ship   shuddering under their feet. Through his thick tan the captain's face   went a shade whiter, and with a terrible cry Nell staggered to her   feet and threw her arms over Joshua's naked shoulders. 
  &quot;'Oh, my God! Joshua, do you know what you're doing?' 
  &quot;The mate's arms tightened about the girl's slight form. 'Are you   afraid to die with me, Nelly?&quot; he asked quietly, while the gale   outside came again in a screaming blast. The captain lost his voice in   it, and waited, while Joshua pressed his lips down upon the head of   the girl he held. Again there came a shock that seemed to split the   ship. 
  The captain gave a shout. He made an attempt to rise from his  berth,  but fell back with a cry of pain. 'Nell! Nell!' he moaned  weakly, and  in an instant the girl was at his side, her arms about his  neck. 
  &quot;'I won't leave you, dad!' she sobbed. 
  &quot;The look in Captain Wiggs' eyes would have sent a chill to the  heart  of any other than the half-mad lover of this girl. 'Josh  Phipps,' he  shouted, 'we was bound for a Michigan port, where piracy  is life  imprisonment; but now I'll hang to th' tow ahead for N' York,  where  it's death! D'y hear, damn you, it's death&#8212;death!' 
  &quot;'Listen!' interrupted the mate. Hear that sea, Cap'n Wiggs? It's   poundin' away your lumber, because there's no man a-guiding the ship.   But it's going to be worse in a minit, Cap'n! I'll give you one more   chance&#8212;it's Nell or th' cable!' 
  &quot;'It's death t' you!' shouted the captain. Between the two-the girl   knelt, her eyes big and dark with agony. 
  &quot;'One more chance-Nell or th' cable!' cried Joshua Phipps a second   time, but again Captain Wiggs replied: 'I tell you it's death! We'll   keep to th' tow.' 
  &quot;In a moment Joshua Phipps was at the cabin door and had  disappeared  into the blackness of the night. With his going came a  thunder of  storm and sea through the open door that drowned the cry of  the girl  behind him. With almost a shriek of pain Captain Wiggs drew  himself to  a sitting posture on the edge of his bunk. In that instant  his face  looked ashy grey in the ghostly glow of the binnacle lamp  over his  head, and he gave one hoarse shout for the return of Joshua  Phipps. 
  &quot;'Great God, Nell, he's gone to cut the tow! Ho, Bill-ee!&#8212;Jack!&#8212;   Henderson!'&quot; 
  Probably every one in the room had heard this remarkable tale  before&#8212;  with the exception of Jim Falkner&#8212;but all were listening as  intently  as the young sailor, to whom it appeared an astounding  recital of  heroism and golden romance. 
  &quot;The captain's daughter bowed her head against the rush of wind,  and  fought her way to the door. Her brain seemed to burn with a single   thought. If Joshua Phipps was mad she was the person he needed most at   that moment. Out into the blackness of the slippery after-deck she   stumbled, a prayer in her heart and her lover's name coming in a   smothered cry from her lips. The stern was roaring like a cataract,   and in the drench of the sea she fell upon her hands and knees and   crept across the pitching deck to the face of the lumber. Foot by foot   she clambered up the great pile, the wind tearing at her hair and   clothes and threatening to hurl her over into the black smother under   the sides of the tow. At intervals her voice would rise, piteously   weak, in a long wind-strangled cry of 'Joshua&#8212;Joshua&#8212;Joshua!' Once   she fancied she heard an answering shout, and listened; but only the   shrieking of the wind through the spars and the lashing of the sea   filled her ears. She had almost reached the top of the lumber when an   ominous rumble rose above the storm, and she released her hold and   fell to the deck as half of the great pile above her slipped off into   the water-With her breath almost gone, she clung to the Jagged ends of   the cedar, then drew herself up again, until she looked out over the   break of Tow Number Two, and saw, like pitching, clouded stars, the   two little dancing lights ahead on Tow Number One. As she looked, the   girl fancied those lights were dissolving into the blackness ahead,   and her heart seemed to stop beating with the knowledge that her lover   had cut the tow. Then they appeared again, to disappear as quickly as   before; and as she strained her eyes in their direction a human shape   came crawling over the lumber, followed by a shadow just behind. 
  &quot;'Joshua!' cried the girl. 
  &quot;Her cry was smothered in the strong arms of the mate. With the   drenched form clasped to him, Joshua Phipps lowered himself over the   broken cedar pile, and with a shout to the shadow behind, staggered   with his sweetheart through the open door of the captain's cabin. 
  &quot;'Cap'n, 'ere's Nell! It's a rough night for her outside, sir!&quot; he   said. Through the door there came another dripping figure, round, fat,   and with a face like chalk. Phipps pointed his revolver at it. 
  &quot;'Come in, Billy, an' take a seat by the cap'n. Cap'n Wiggs, this  is  the preacher I've brought to marry Nell 'n' me!' 
  &quot;For a moment the captain's voice failed him. He still sat on the  edge  of his bunk, his face twitching with pain at every jar of the  ship.  His girl knelt beside him again, the water from her hair and  clothes  wetting him to the skin. But he seemed not to notice this. 
  &quot;'Josh, have you cut the cable?' he asked. There had come a great   change in his voice, and the hand that rested on Nell's head trembled   a bit. 
  &quot;'Ask Billy, Cap'n Wiggs!' replied the mate. 
  &quot;'Billy&#8212;is th' cable gone?' 
  &quot;There came the ominous click of the hammer on Toshua Phipps'   revolver. Billy started. 'Tell th' honest truth, Billy!' 
  &quot;'S'elp me God&#8212;' 
  &quot;The revolver fell careless on a line with Billy's head. 'Th'  cable's  gone, Cap'n Wiggs, th' lumber's washin' overboard, an'&#8212;an'&#8212;' 
  &quot;'Tell it all, Billy!' said the mate. &quot;'An' we'll be on the rock o'   Thunder Bay inside of an hour, Cap'n Wiggs, s'elp me God, we will!&quot; 
  &quot;'And there's nary a hand aboard to help us, Cap'n,' added the  mate.  'Listen to the sea beatin' death to 'er ribs! We're  awash&#8212;driftin'  like a cask&#8212;' 
  &quot;The revolver rested in the hollow of Joshua's arm on a dead level   with Billy's eyes. It suggested death to Billy. 'Cap'n, f'r the sake   o' God give Josh Phipps his wish or we're all dead men&#8212;an'&#8212;an'&#8212;'   Fear choked back the cook's words, but with trembling hand he pointed   at the captain's girl. 
  &quot;'It's for Nell, Cap'n,' said the mate. Almost unconsciously he  knelt  beside the girl and put his arms about her. His revolver lay on  the  floor a foot behind him, and a devilish, frightened gleam came  into  Billy's eyes as he sneaked toward it. 'It's all for Nell, Cap'n,'   repeated the mate, almost pleadingly. 
  &quot;Billy's hand stole down. His fat fingers twined themselves about  the  cold metal of the gun, and his white face went whiter as he  thought of  what he would do the next instant. The captain watched him  over  Joshua's shoulder. 
  &quot;'Put it down, Billy!' he said. 'Put it down and take a seat, as  Josh  told you!' Then he leaned over until his powerful hands could  have  clutched the mate's throat. From outside there came the grinding  wash  of another avalanche of cedar pitching over the side, and the  captain  grimaced. 'And what if I promise, Josh?' he asked. 
  &quot;'It ain't a promise I want, Cap'n, it's a wife,' said the mate.  His  head was bowed until he could see only the feet of the other; but  one  of Nell's arms was about his neck, and he knew that he was safe. 
  &quot;'An' if I give y' that?' 
  &quot;Joshua straightened himself. 'If you give me that I'll&#8212;I'll run  th'  ship to port an' work for you 'n' Nell till th' crack o' doom!' 
  &quot;'Billy&#8212;hev y' a Bible?' 
  &quot;The captain shouted the words in a voice of thunder. With a cry  that  rose piercing above the tumult of the storm, the sailor's  sweetheart  threw her arms about her father's neck, and Joshua Phipps  rose to his  feet, dazed, and stretched both of his great, brawny arms  out toward  the two. 
  &quot;'Hev y' a Bible?' 
  &quot;It was the captain's old voice again, the voice that had strung   itself to the song of gales for forty years, and, with it thundering   through the cabin, a great joy filled the heart of Joshua Phipps, and   he, too, turned and roared at the little fat man who stood shivering   at the door, the revolver shaking in his hand. 
  &quot;'Your Bible, Billy!' 
  &quot;As the cook slipped out into the roaring night two great hands met  in  a crushing clasp, and two tender, loving arms were raised to go  around  the necks of father and lover. 
  &quot;'Josh, 'adn't you better put off th' weddin' until the hands have   straightened the ship?' asked the captain, after that first silent   moment. 
  &quot;'The ship's all right, Cap'n Wiggs!' said the mate. 'Billy was the   one as told you the tow as cut; I didn't!' 
  &quot;'An' the tow&#8212;?' 
  &quot;'Ain't cut at all, sir!' 
  &quot;'But th' wheel-th' men&#8212;?' 
  &quot;'Henderson's at the wheel, sir, an' Jack's for'rd, neither of 'em   knowing what's been happening! ' 
  &quot;For a full minute the captain was speechless. Then he let out an  oath  which seemed to come from the bottom of his soul. 'Josh, you're&#8212;   you're devilish clever!' he said. 
  &quot;Again two great hands met in a crushing clasp, and this time two  warm  lips kissed first the mate and then the captain, while a wildly   beating little heart prayed that Billy would hurry&#8212;with the Bible.&quot;
