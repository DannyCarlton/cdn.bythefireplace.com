<b>A. D. 1670</b> 
<b>AGLAE, a widow<br> MURIEL, her unmarried sister.</b> 
IT happened once, in that brave land that lies<br> For half the twelvemonth wrapt in sombre skies,<br> Two sisters loved one man. He being dead,<br> Grief loosed the lips of her he had not wed,<br> And all the passion that through heavy years<br> Had masked in smiles unmasked itself in tears.<br> No purer love may mortals know than this,<br> The hidden love that guards another's bliss.<br> High in a turret's westward-facing room,<br> Whose painted window held the sunset's bloom,<br> The two together grieving, each to each<br> Unveiled her soul with sobs and broken speech. 
Both still were young, in life's rich summer yet;<br> And one was dark, with tints of violet<br> In hair and eyes, and one was blond as she<br> Who rose--a second daybreak--from the sea,<br> Gold-tressed and azure-eyed. In that lone place,<br> Like dusk and dawn, they sat there face to face. 
She spoke the first whose strangely silvering hair<br> No wreath had worn, nor widow's weed might wear,<br> And told her blameless love, and knew no shame--<br> Her holy love that, like a vestal flame<br> Beside the sacred body of some queen<br> Within a guarded crypt had burned unseen<br> From weary year to year. And she who heard<br> Smiled proudly through her tears and said no word,<br> But, drawing closer, on the troubled brow<br> Laid one long kiss, and that was words enow! 
<b>MURIEL.</b> 
Be still, my heart! Grown patient with thine ache,<br> Thou shouldst be dumb, yet needs must speak, or break.<br> The world is empty now that he is gone. 
<b>AGLAE.</b> 
Ay, sweetheart! 
<b>MURIEL.</b> 
None was like him, no, not one.<br> From other men he stood apart, alone<br> In honor spotless as unfallen snow.<br> Nothing all evil was it his to know;<br> His charity still found some germ, some spark<br> Of light in natures that seemed wholly dark.<br> He read men's souls; the lowly and the high<br> Moved on the self-same level in his eye.<br> Gracious to all, to none subservient,<br> Without offence he spake the word he meant--<br> His word no trick of tact or courtly art,<br> But the white flowering of the noble heart.<br> Careless he was of much the world counts gain,<br> Careless of self, too simple to be vain,<br> Yet strung so finely that for conscience-sake<br> He would have gone like Cranmer to the stake.<br> I saw--how could I help but love? And you-- 
<b>AGLAE.</b> 
At this perfection did I worship too . . .<br> 'Twas this that stabbed me. Heed not what I say!<br> I meant it not, my wits are gone astray,<br> With all that is and has been. No, I lie--<br> Had he been less perfection, happier I! 
<b>MURIEL.</b> 
Strange words and wild! 'Tis the distracted mind<br> Breathes them, not you, and I no meaning find. 
<b>AGLAE.</b> 
Yet 'twere as plain as writing on a scroll<br> Had you but eyes to read within my soul.--<br> How a grief hidden feeds on its own mood,<br> Poisons the healthful currents of the blood<br> With bitterness, and turns the heart to stone!<br> I think, in truth, 'twere better to make moan,<br> And so be done with it. This many a year,<br> Sweetheart, have I laughed lightly and made cheer,<br> Pierced through with sorrow! 
Then the widowed one<br> With sorrowfullest eyes beneath the sun,<br> Faltered, irresolute, and bending low<br> Her head, half whispered, 
Dear, how could you know?<br> What masks are faces!--yours, unread by me<br> These seven long summers; mine, so placidly<br> Shielding my woe! No tremble of the lip,<br> No cheek's quick pallor let our secret slip!<br> Mere players we, and she that played the queen,<br> Now in her homespun, looks how poor and mean!<br> How shall I say it, how find words to tell<br> What thing it was for me made earth a hell<br> That else had been my heaven! 'Twould blanch your cheek<br> Were I to speak it. Nay, but I will speak,<br> Since like two souls at compt we seem to stand,<br> Where nothing may be hidden. Hold my hand,<br> But look not at me! Noble 'twas, and meet,<br> To hide your heart, nor fling it at his feet<br> To lie despised there. Thus saved you our pride<br> And that white honor for which earls have died.<br> You were not all unhappy, loving so!<br> I with a difference wore my weight of woe.<br> My lord was he. It was my cruel lot,<br> My hell, to love him--for he loved me not! 
Then came a silence. Suddenly like death<br> The truth flashed on them, and each held her breath--<br> A flash of light whereby they both were slain,<br> She that was loved and she that loved in vain!
