<b>I</b>    
When Mortimer, after tapping on his wife's door, was bidden to enter he  found her sitting with Aileen over a breakfast tray, the belated tears  running down into her coffee. Aileen, promising to return after she had  given her father his breakfast, made a hasty retreat; and Dwight took his  wife in his arms and soothed the grief which grew almost hysterical in its  reaction from the insensibility of the morning.    
"You won't leave me for a moment?" she sobbed, in this mood finding his  sympathy exquisite and necessary. "You'll stay home--until--until--"    
"Of course. I'll telephone Wicksam after breakfast. He can run the office  for a day or two. By the way Maria will be here this evening; Sally is  better. Joan and Tom and the rest will be here in about an hour. Tom and I  will attend to everything. You are not to bother, not to think."    
"Oh, you are too wonderful--always so strong--so strong--how I love it. But  I'll never get over this--poor old mommy!"    
But the paroxysm passed, and just as Mortimer was on the verge of morning  starvation and too polite to mention it, she grew calm by degrees and sent  him down to breakfast. The emotional phase of her grief was over.
