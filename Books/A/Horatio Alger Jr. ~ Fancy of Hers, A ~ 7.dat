  A few evenings later, at Mrs. Pratt's house, Mabel met an  individual of whom she had frequently heard since her arrival in  Granville. This was Mr. Randolph Chester, a bachelor from New York, who  generally passed part of the summer in the village. He was reputed to  be rich, and, though his wealth was exaggerated, he actually had enough  to support a single man in comfort and even luxury. Though a bachelor,  he allowed it to be understood that he was in the matrimonial market,  and thus received no little attention from maneuvering mothers, single  ladies of uncertain age, and blooming maidens who were willing to  overlook disparity in age for the sake of the wealth and position which  it was understood Mr. Chester would be able to give them. 
  Why did Mr. Randolph Chester (he liked to be called by his full  name) summer in Granville when he might have gone to Bar Harbor or  Newport? Because at these places of resort he would have been nobody,  while in a small New Hampshire village he was a great man. In Granville  he felt, though in this he was perhaps mistaken, that he could marry  any of the village belles to whom he chose to hold out his finger, and  this consciousness was flattering. 
  On his arrival at the hotel, where he had a special room reserved  for him summer after summer, he was told of the new school teacher, a  young, beautiful, and accomplished girl from New York. 
  &quot;If I like her looks,&quot; thought he to himself, &quot;I may marry her. Of  course she's poor, of she wouldn't be teaching here for the paltry  wages of a country school mistress, and she'll be glad enough to accept  me.&quot; 
  When he was introduced to her Mabel saw before her a middle aged  man, carefully dressed, passably good looking, and evidently very well  pleased with himself. On his part, he was somewhat dazzled by the  school teacher's attractions. 
  &quot;Why, the girl has actual style,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Egad, she  would appear to advantage in a New York drawing room. I wonder if she's  heard about me.&quot; 
  He felt doubtful on this point, for Mabel received him with well  bred indifference. He missed the little flutter of gratified vanity  which the attentions of such an eligible parti usually produced in the  young ladies of Granville. 
  &quot;I believe you are from New York, my own city,&quot; he said  complacently. 
  &quot;I have passed some time there.&quot; 
  &quot;You must &#151; ahem! &#151; find a considerable difference between the  city and this village.&quot; 
  Undoubtedly, Mr. Chester. I find it a pleasant relief to be here.&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure. So do I. I enjoy leaving the gay saloons of New York  for the green glades of the country.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't say,&quot; returned Mabel mischievously, &quot;that I know much  about the saloons of New York.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course I mean the saloons of fashion &#151; the shining circles of  gay society,&quot; said Mr. Chester hastily, half suspecting that she was  laughing at him. &quot;Do you know the Livingstons, Miss Frost?&quot; 
  &quot;There is a baker of that name on Sixth Avenue, I believe,&quot; said  Mabel innocently. &quot;Do You mean his family?&quot; 
  &quot;No, certainly not,&quot; said Mr. Randolph Chester, quite shocked at  the idea. &quot;I haven't the honor of knowing any baker on Sixth Avenue.&quot; 
  Neither had Mabel, but she had fully made up her mind to tease Mr.  Randolph Chester, whose self conceit she instinctively divined. 
  &quot;Then you don't live on Sixth Avenue,&quot; she continued. &quot;I wonder  where I got that impression!&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Mr. Chester, scandalized. &quot;I have apartments  on Madison Avenue.&quot;  &quot;I know where it is,&quot; said Mabel. 
  &quot;She can't move in any sort of society, and yet where on earth did  she get that air of distinction?&quot; Randolph Chester reflected. &quot;Do you  like school teaching?&quot; he asked in a patronizing tone. 
  &quot;I find it pleasant.&quot; 
  &quot;I wonder you do not procure a position in the city, where you  could obtain higher wages.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think I could?&quot; asked Mabel. 
  &quot;My friend, Mr. Livingston, is one of the School Commissioners,&quot;  said Mr. Chester. &quot;I can mention your name to him, and you might stand  a chance to obtain the next vacancy.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Chester, you are exceedingly kind, but I don't  think that I wish to become a candidate at present,&quot; 
  &quot;But you are really throwing away your talents in a small country  village like this.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think so,&quot; said Mabel. &quot;I find many of my scholars pretty  intelligent, and it is a real pleasure to guide them.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Randolph Chester, you mustn't try to lure away Miss Frost. We  can't spare her,&quot; said Mrs. Pratt. 
  &quot;You see, Mr. Chester, that I am appreciated here,&quot; said Mabel. &quot;In  the city I might not be.&quot; 
  &quot;I think,&quot; said the bachelor gallantly, &quot;that you would be  appreciated anywhere.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Chester,&quot; returned Mabel, receiving the compliment  without seeming at all overpowered by it; &quot;but you see you speak from a  very short acquaintance.&quot; 
  Mr. Randolph Chester was piqued. He felt that his attentions were  not estimated at their real value. The school mistress could not  understand what an eligible parti he was. 
  &quot;Do you propose to remain here after the summer is over, Miss  Frost?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;My plans are quite undecided,&quot; said Mabel. 
  &quot;I suppose she isn't sure whether she can secure the school for the  fall term,&quot; thought the bachelor. 
  There was a piano in the room, recently purchased for Carrie Pratt,  Mrs. Pratt's daughter. 
  &quot;I wonder whether she plays,&quot; thought Mr. Chester. &quot;Will you give  us some music, Miss Frost?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;If you desire it. What is your taste?&quot; 
  &quot;Do you know any operatic airs?&quot; 
  &quot;A few; and Mabel began with an air from La Sonnambula.&quot; She played  with a dash and execution which Mr. Chester recognized, though he only  pretended to like opera because it was fashionable. 
  &quot;Bravo!&quot; he exclaimed, clapping his hands in affected ecstasy.  &quot;Really you are an excellent player. I suppose you have attended the  opera?&quot; 
  &quot;Occasionally,&quot; said Mabel. 
  &quot;And you like music? But I need not ask.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes, I like music. It is one of my greatest pleasures.&quot; 
  &quot;You would make a very successful music teacher, I should judge. I  should think you would prefer it to teaching a country school.&quot; 
  &quot;I like music too well to teach it. I am afraid that I should find  it drudgery to initiate beginners.&quot; 
  &quot;There may be something in that.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you sing, Miss Frost?&quot; asked Mrs. Pratt. 
  &quot;Sometimes.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you sing something, to oblige me?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly, Mrs. Pratt. What would you like?&quot; 
  &quot;I like ballad music. I am afraid my ear is not sufficiently  trained to like operatic airs, such as Mr. Randolph Chester admires.&quot; 
  After a brief prelude Mabel sang an old ballad. Her voice was very  flexible, and was not wanting in strength. It was very easy to see that  it had been carefully cultivated. 
  Mr. Chester was more and more surprised and charmed. &quot;That girl is  quite out of place here,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Any commonplace girl  would do for the Granville school mistress. She deserves a more  brilliant position.&quot;  He surveyed Mabel critically, but could find no  fault with her appearance. She was beautiful, accomplished, and had a  distinguished air. Even if she were related to the baker's family on  Sixth Avenue, as he thought quite probable, she was fitted to adorn the  &quot;saloons of fashion,&quot; as he called them. 
  &quot;I rather think I will marry her,&quot; he thought. &quot;I don't believe I  can do better. She is poor, to be sure, but I have enough for both, and  can raise her to my own position in society.&quot; 
  Fortunately Mabel did not know what was passing through the mind of  the antiquated beau, as, she regarded him, who amused her by his  complacent consciousness of his superiority. When it was ten o'clock,  she rose to go. 
  &quot;It won't do to be dissipated, Mrs. Pratt,&quot; she said. &quot;I must be  going home.&quot; 
  &quot;Permit me to escort you, Miss Frost,&quot; said Mr. Chester, rising  with alacrity. 
  She hesitated, but could think of no reason for declining, and they  walked together to Mrs. Kent's. The distance was' short &#151; too short,  Mr. Chester thought, but there was no way of lengthening it. 
  &quot;I hope to have the pleasure of meeting you again soon, Miss  Frost,&quot; said the bachelor at parting. 
  Mabel responded in suitable terms, and Mr. Randolph Chester went  back to the hotel in quite a flutter of excitement. The staid bachelor  was as nearly in love as such a well regulated person could be. 
  The next evening Mabel spent in writing a letter to Mary Bridgman,  part of which it may be well to quote. 
  &quot;You,&quot; she said, &quot;are the only person in my confidence, the only  one who knows of my present whereabouts. You will, I feel sure, be glad  to know that my experiment is proving to be a success. I believe I have  inspired in my pupils a real and earnest interest in study. It gives me  genuine pleasure to see their minds unfolding and expanding, day by  day, and to feel that I am doing an important part in guiding them in  this intellectual growth. I can assure you that I get more satisfaction  and exhilaration from the life I am leading now than I found in my last  summer's round of amusements at Newport. 
  &quot;When will it end? How long will this fit of enthusiasm last? If  you ask these questions, I cannot tell you. Let time decide. 
  &quot;You have heard, I suppose, of Mr. Randolph Chester, the elderly  bachelor who favors Granville with his presence every summer. I made  his acquaintance yesterday, while calling upon Mrs. Pratt. His air of  condescension on being introduced to the school teacher was very  amusing. He was evidently disappointed by my indifference, and seemed  piqued by it. When I was asked to play I determined to produce an  impression upon him, and I did my best. Mr. Chester seemed surprised to  find a country school mistress so accomplished. He recommended me to  become a music teacher and offered to assist me to obtain a position in  the city, professing to regard me worthy of a larger field than  Granville affords. He offered his escort home, and I accepted. 
  &quot;Today Mr. Chester did me the great honor of visiting my school. He  professed a great interest in the subject of education, but I learn, on  inquiry, that he has never before visited the school. I suggested to  him that Miss Bassett would be glad to receive a call; but he shrugged  his shoulders and did not welcome the proposal. I felt a malicious  satisfaction in introducing him publicly to my scholars as one who took  a strong interest in them, and announced that he would address them. My  visitor started, blushed, and looked embarrassed, but retreat was  impossible. He made a halting speech, chiefly consisting of  congratulations to the scholars upon having so accomplished and capable  a teacher. On the whole he rather turned the tables upon me. 
  &quot;It is quite in the line of possibility  that I may have a chance  to become Mrs. Randolph Chester before the season is over. If I accept  him I shall insist on your being one of my bridesmaids.&quot;
