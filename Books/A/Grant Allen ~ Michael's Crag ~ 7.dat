The Trevennacks dined in their lodgings at Gunwalloe at half-past  seven. But in the rough open-air life of summer visitors on the  Cornish coast, meals as a rule are very movable feasts; and Michael  Trevennack wasn't particularly alarmed when he reached home that  evening to find Cleer hadn't returned before him. They had missed one  another, somehow, among the tangled paths that led down the gully; an  easy enough thing to do between those big boulders and bramble-bushes;  and it was a quarter to eight before Trevennack began to feel alarmed  at Cleer's prolonged absence. By that time, however, he grew  thoroughly frightened; and, reproaching himself bitterly for having  let his daughter stray out of his sight in the first place, he hurried  back, with his wife, at the top of his speed along the cliff path to  the Penmorgan headland.    
It's half an hour's walk from Gunwalloe to Michael's Crag; and by the  time Trevennack reached the mouth of the gully the sands were almost  covered; so for the first time in fifteen years he was forced to take  the path right under the cliff to the now comparatively distant  island, round whose base a whole waste of angry sea surged sullenly.  On the way they met a few workmen who, in answer to their inquiries,  could give them no news, but who turned back to aid in the search for  the missing young lady. When they got opposite Michael's Crag, a wide  belt of black water, all encumbered with broken masses of sharp rock,  some above and some below the surface, now separated them by fifty  yards or more from the island. It was growing dark fast, for these  were the closing days of August twilight; and dense fog had drifted  in, half obliterating everything. They could barely descry the dim  outline of the pyramidal rock in its lower half; its upper part was  wholly shrouded in thick mist and drizzle.    
With a wild cry of despair, Trevennack raised his voice, and shouted  aloud, "Cleer, Cleer! where are you?"    
That clarion voice, as of his namesake angel, though raised against  the wind, could be heard above even the thud of the fierce breakers  that pounded the sand. On the highest peak above, where she sat, cold  and shivering, Cleer heard it, and jumped up. "Here! here! father!"  she cried out, with a terrible effort, descending at the same time  down the sheer face of the cliff as far as the dashing spray and  fierce wild waves would allow her.    
No other ear caught the sound of that answering cry; but Trevennack's  keen senses, preternaturally awakened by the gravity of the crisis,  detected the faint ring of her girlish voice through the thunder of  the surf. "She's there!" he cried, frantically, waving his hands above  his head. "She's there! She's there! We must get across and save her."    
For a second Mrs. Trevennack doubted whether he was really right, or  whether this was only one of poor Michael's hallucinations. But the  next moment, with another cry, Cleer waved her handkerchief in return,  and let it fall from her hand. It came, carried on the light breeze,  and dropped in the water before their very eyes, half way across the  channel.    
Frenzied at the sight, Trevennack tore off his coat, and would have  plunged into the sea, then and there, to rescue her. But the workmen  held him back. "No, no, sir; you mustn't," they said. "No harm can't  come to the young lady if she stops there. She've only got to sit on  them rocks there till morning, and the tide'll leave her high and dry  right enough, as it always do. But nobody couldn't live in such a sea  as that--not Tim o' Truro. The waves 'u'd dash him up afore he knowed  where he was, and smash him all to pieces on the side o' the island."    
Trevennack tried to break from them, but the men held him hard. Their  resistance angered him. He chafed under their restraint. How dare  these rough fellows lay hands like that on the Prince of the  Archangels and a superior officer in Her Majesty's Civil Service? But  with the self-restraint that was habitual to him, he managed to  refrain, even so, from disclosing his identity. He only struggled  ineffectually, instead of blasting them with his hot breath, or  clutching his strong arms round their bare throats and choking them.  As he stood there and hesitated, half undecided how to act, of a  sudden a sharp cry arose from behind. Trevennack turned and looked.  Through the dark and the fog he could just dimly descry two men  hurrying up, with ropes and life buoys. As they neared him, he started  in unspeakable horror. For one of them, indeed, was only Eustace Le  Neve; but the other--the other was that devil Walter Tyrrel, who, he  felt sure in his own heart, had killed their dear Michael. And it was  his task in life to fight and conquer devils.    
For a minute he longed to leap upon him and trample him under foot, as  long ago he had trampled his old enemy, Satan. What was the fellow  doing here now? What business had he with Cleer? Was he always to be  in at the death of a Trevennack?    
But true to her trust, the silver-haired lady clutched his arm with  tender watchfulness. "For Cleer's sake, dear Michael!" she whispered  low in his ear; "for Cleer's sake--say nothing; don't speak to him,  don't notice him!"    
The distracted father drew back a step, out of reach of the spray.  "But Lucy," he cried low to her, "only think! only remember! If I  cared to go on the cliff and just spread my wings, I could fly across  and save her--so instantly, so easily!"    
His wife held his hand hard. That touch always soothed him. "If you  did, Michael," she said gently, with her feminine tact, "they'd all  declare you were mad, and had no wings to fly with. And Cleer's in no  immediate danger just now, I feel sure. Don't try, there's a dear man.  That's right! Oh, thank you."    
Reassured by her calm confidence, Trevennack fell back yet another  step on the sands, and watched the men aloof. Walter Tyrrel turned to  him. His heart was in his mouth. He spoke in short, sharp sentences.  "The coastguard's wife told us," he said. "We've come down to get her  off. I've sent word direct to the Lizard lifeboat. But I'm afraid it  won't come. They daren't venture out. Sea runs too high, and these  rocks are too dangerous."    
As he spoke, he tore off his coat, tied a rope round his waist, flung  his boots on the sand, and girded himself rapidly with an inflated  life-buoy. Then, before the men could seize him or prevent the rash  attempt, he had dashed into the great waves that curled and thundered  on the beach, and was struggling hard with the sea in a life and death  contest. Eustace Le Neve held the rope, and tried to aid him in his  endeavors. He had meant to plunge in himself, but Walter Tyrrel was  beforehand with him. He was no match in a race against time for the  fiery and impetuous Cornish temperament. It wasn't long, however,  before the breakers proved themselves more than equal foes for Walter  Tyrrel. In another minute he was pounded and pummeled on the unseen  rocks under water by the great curling billows. They seized him  resistlessly on their crests, tumbled him over like a child, and  dashed him, bruised and bleeding, one limp bundle of flesh, against  the jagged and pointed summits of the submerged boulders.    
With all his might, Eustace Le Neve held on to the rope; then, in coat  and boots as he stood, he plunged into the waves and lifted Walter  Tyrrel in his strong arms landward. He was a bigger built and more  powerful man than his host, and his huge limbs battled harder with the  gigantic waves. But even so, in that swirling flood, it was touch and  go with him. The breakers lifted him off his feet, tossed him to and  fro in their trough, flung him down again forcibly against the sharp-  edged rocks, and tried to float off his half unconscious burden. But  Le Neve persevered in spite of them, scrambling and tottering as he  went, over wet and slippery reefs, with Tyrrel still clasped in his  arms, and pressed tight to his breast, till he landed him safe at last  on the firm sand beside him.    
The squire was far too beaten and bruised by the rocks to make a  second attempt against those resistless breakers. Indeed, Le Neve  brought him ashore more dead than alive, bleeding from a dozen wounds  on the face and hands, and with the breath almost failing in his  battered body. They laid him down on the beach, while the fishermen  crowded round him, admiring his pluck, though they deprecated his  foolhardiness, for they "knowed the squire couldn't never live ag'in  it." But Le Neve, still full of the reckless courage of youth, and  health, and strength, and manhood, keenly alive now to the peril of  Cleer's lonely situation, never heeded their forebodings. He dashed in  once more, just as he stood, clothes and all, in the wild and  desperate attempt to stem that fierce flood and swim across to the  island.    
In such a sea as then raged, indeed, and among such broken rocks,  swimming, in the strict sense, was utterly impossible. By some mere  miracle of dashing about, however--here, battered against the sharp  rocks; there, flung over them by the breakers; and yonder, again,  sucked down, like a straw in an eddy, by the fierce strength of the  undertow--Eustace found himself at last, half unconscious and half  choked, carried round by the swirling scour that set through the  channel to the south front of the island. Next instant he felt he was  cast against the dead wall of rock like an india rubber ball. He  rebounded into the trough. The sea caught him a second time, and flung  him once more, helpless, against the dripping precipice. With what  life was left in him, he clutched with both hands the bare serpentine  edge. Good luck befriended him. The great wave had lifted him up on  its towering crest to the level of vegetation, beyond the debatable  zone. He clung to the hard root of woody sea-aster in the clefts. The  waves dashed back in tumultuous little cataracts, and left him there  hanging.    
Like a mountain goat, Eustace clambered up the side, on hands, knees,  feet, elbows, glad to escape with his life from that irresistible  turmoil. The treacherous herbs on the slope of the crag were kind to  him. He scrambled ahead, like some mad, wild thing. He went onward,  upward, cutting his hands at each stage, tearing the skin from his  fingers. It was impossible; but he did it. Next minute he found  himself high and dry on the island.    
His clothes were clinging wet, of course, and his limbs bruised and  battered. But he was safe on the firm plateau of the rock at last; and  he had rescued Cleer Trevennack!    
In the first joy and excitement of the moment he forgot altogether the  cramping conventionalities of our every-day life; and, repeating the  cry he had heard Michael Trevennack raise from the beach below, he  shouted aloud, at the top of his voice, "Cleer! Cleer! Where are you?"    
"Here!" came an answering voice from the depths of the gloom overhead.  And following the direction whence the sound seemed to come, Eustace  Le Neve clambered up to her.    
As he seized her hand and wrung it, Cleer crying the while with  delight and relief, it struck him all at once, for the very first  time, he had done no good by coming, save to give her companionship.  It would be hopeless to try carrying her through those intricate rock-  channels and that implacable surf, whence he himself had emerged,  alone and unburdened, only by a miracle. They two must stop alone  there on the rock till morning.    
As for Cleer, too innocent and too much of a mere woman in her deadly  peril to think of anything but the delightful sense of confidence in a  strong man at her side to guard and protect her, she sat and held his  hand still, in a perfect transport of gratitude. "Oh, how good of you  to come!" she cried again and again, bending over it in her relief,  and half tempted to kiss it. "How good of you to come across like that  to save me."
