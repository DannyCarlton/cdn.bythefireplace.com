When first the crocus thrusts its point of gold<br> Up through the still snow-drifted garden mould,<br> And folded green things in dim woods unclose<br> Their crinkled spears, a sudden tremor goes<br> Into my veins and makes me kith and kin<br> To every wild-born thing that thrills and blows.<br> Sitting beside this crumbling sea-coal fire,<br> Here in the city's ceaseless roar and din,<br> Far from the brambly paths I used to know,<br> Far from the rustling brooks that slip and shine<br> Where the Neponset alders take their glow,<br> I share the tremulous sense of bud and briar<br> And inarticulate ardors of the vine.
