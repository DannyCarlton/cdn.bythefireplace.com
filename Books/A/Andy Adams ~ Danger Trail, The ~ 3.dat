  Howland was glad that for a time there was an excuse for his  silence. It began to dawn on him that this was an extraordinary  adventure for a man on whose shoulders rested the responsibilities of  one of the greatest engineering tasks on the continent, and who was due  to take a train for the seat of his operations at eight o'clock in the  morning. Inwardly he was experiencing some strange emotions; outwardly  he smiled as he thought of what Van Horn would say if he knew the  circumstances. He looked down at his companion; saw the sheen of her  hair as it rippled out from under her fur turban, studied the soft  contour of her cheek and chin, without himself being observed, and  noticed, incidentally, that the top of the bewitching head beside him  came just about to a level with his cigar which he was smoking. He  wondered if he were making a fool of himself. If so, he assured himself  that there was at least one compensation. This night in Prince Albert  would not be so uninteresting as it had promised to be earlier in the  evening.
  Where the river ferry was half drawn up on the shore, its stern  frozen in the ice, he paused and looked down at the girl in quiet  surprise. She nodded, smiling, and motioned across the river.
  &#8220;I was over there once to-night,&#8221; said Howland aloud. &#8220;Didn't see  any houses and heard nothing but wolves. Is that where we're going?&#8221;
  Her white teeth gleamed at him and he was conscious of a warm  pressure against his arm as the girl signified that they were to cross.  His perplexity increased. On the farther shore the forest came down to  the river's edge in a black wall of spruce and balsam. Beyond that edge  of the wilderness he knew that no part of Prince Albert intruded. It  was possible that across from them was a squatter's cabin; and yet if  this were so, and the girl was going to it, why had she told him that  she was a stranger in the town? And why had she come to him for the  assistance she promised to request of him instead of seeking it of  those whom she knew?
  He asked himself these questions without putting them in words, and  not until they were climbing up the frozen bank of the stream, with the  shadows of the forest growing deeper about them, did he speak again.
  &#8220;You told me you were a stranger,&#8221; he said, stopping his companion  where the light of the stars fell on the face which she turned up to  him. She smiled, and nodded affirmatively.
  &#8220;You seem pretty well acquainted over here,&#8221; he persisted. &#8220;Where  are we going?&#8221;
  This time she responded with an emphatic negative shake of her head,  at the same time pointing with her free hand to the well-defined trail  that wound up from the ferry landing into the forest. Earlier in the  day Howland had been told that this was the Great North Trail that led  into the vast wildernesses beyond the Saskatchewan. Two days before,  the factor from Lac Bain, the Chippewayan and the Crees had come in  over it. Its hard crust bore the marks of the sledges of Jean Croisset  and the men from the Lac la Ronge country. Since the big snow, which  had fallen four feet deep ten days before, a forest man had now and  then used this trail on his way down to the edge of civilization; but  none from Prince Albert had traveled it in the other direction. Howland  had been told this at the hotel, and he shrugged his shoulders in  candid bewilderment as he stared down into the girl's face. She seemed  to understand his thoughts, and again her mouth rounded itself into  that bewitching red O, which gave to her face an expression of tender  entreaty, of pathetic grief that the soft lips were powerless to voice,  the words which she wished to speak. Then, suddenly, she darted a few  steps from Howland and with the toe of her shoe formed a single word in  the surface of the snow. She rested her hand lightly on Howland's  shoulder as he bent over to make it out in the elusive starlight.
  &#8220;Camp!&#8221; he cried, straightening himself. &#8220;Do you mean to say you're  camping out here?&#8221;
  She nodded again and again, delighted that he understood her. There  was something so childishly sweet in her face, in the gladness of her  eyes, that Howland stretched out both his hands to her, laughing aloud.  &#8220;You!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;<I>You</I>&#8212;camping out here!&#8221; With a quick  little movement she came to him, still laughing with her eyes and lips,  and for an instant he held both her hands tight in his own. Her lovely  face was dangerously near to him. He felt the touch of her breath on  his face, for an instant caught the sweet scent of her hair. Never had  he seen eyes like those that glowed up at him softly, filled with the  gentle starlight; never in his life had he dreamed of a face like this,  so near to him that it sent the blood leaping through his veins in  strange excitement. He held the hands tighter, and the movement drew  the girl closer to him, until for no more than a breath he felt her  against his breast. In that moment he forgot all sense of time and  place; forgot his old self&#8212;Jack Howland&#8212;practical, unromantic,  master-builder of railroads; forgot everything but this presence of the  girl, the warm pressure against his breast, the lure of the great brown  eyes that had come so unexpectedly into his life. In another moment he  had recovered himself. He drew a step back, freeing the girl's hands.
  &#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he said softly. His cheeks burned hotly at what  he had done, and turning squarely about he strode up the trail. He had  not taken a dozen paces, when far ahead of him he saw the red glow of a  fire. Then a hand caught his arm, clutching at it almost fiercely, and  he turned to meet the girl's face, white now with a strange terror.
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Tell me&#8212;&#8221;
  He caught her hands again, startled by the look in her eyes. Quickly  she pulled herself away. A dozen feet behind her, in the thick shadows  of the forest trees, something took shape and movement. In a flash  Howland saw a huge form leap from the gloom and caught the gleam of an  uplifted knife. There was no time for him to leap aside, no time for  him to reach for the revolver which he carried in his pocket. In such a  crisis one's actions are involuntary, machine-like, as if life,  hovering by a thread, preserves itself in its own manner and without  thought or reasoning on the part of the creature it animates.
  For an instant Howland neither thought nor reasoned. Had he done so  he would probably have met his mysterious assailant, pitting his naked  fists against the knife. But the very mainspring of his  existence&#8212;which is self-preservation&#8212;called on him to do otherwise.  Before the startled cry on his lips found utterance he flung himself  face downward in the snow. The move saved him, and as the other  stumbled over his body, pitching headlong into the trail, he snatched  forth his revolver. Before he could fire there came a roar like that of  a beast from behind him and a terrific blow fell on his head. Under the  weight of a second assailant he was crushed to the snow, his pistol  slipped from his grasp, and two great hands choked a despairing cry  from his throat. He saw a face over him, distorted with passion, a huge  neck, eyes that named like angry garnets. He struggled to free his  pinioned arms, to wrench off the death-grip at his throat, but his  efforts were like those of a child against a giant. In a last terrible  attempt he drew up his knees inch by inch under the weight of his  enemy; it was his only chance, his only hope. Even as he felt the  fingers about his throat, sinking like hot iron into his flesh, and the  breath slipping from his body, he remembered this murderous knee-punch  taught to him by the rough fighters of the Inland Seas, and with all  the life that remained in him he sent it crushing into the other's  abdomen. It was a moment before he knew that it had been successful,  before the film cleared from his eyes and he saw his assailant  groveling in the snow. He rose to his feet, dazed and staggering from  the effect of the blow on his head and the murderous grip at his  throat. Half a pistol shot down the trail he saw indistinctly the  twisting of black objects in the snow, and as he stared one of the  objects came toward him.
  &#8220;Do not fire, M'seur Howland,&#8221; he heard a voice call. &#8220;It ees  I&#8212;Jean Croisset, a friend! Blessed Saints, that was&#8212;what you call  heem?&#8212;close heem?&#8212;close call?&#8221;
  The half-breed's thin dark face came up smiling out of the white  gloom. For a moment Howland did not see him, scarcely heard his words.  Wildly he looked about him for the girl. She was gone.
  &#8220;I happened here&#8212;just in time&#8212;with a club,&#8221; continued Croisset.  &#8220;Come, we must go.&#8221;
  The smile had gone from his face and there was a commanding firmness  in the grip that fell on the young engineer's arm. Howland was  conscious that things were twisting about him and that there was a  strange weakness in his limbs. Dumbly he raised his hands to his head,  which hurt him until he felt as if he must cry out in his pain.
  &#8220;The girl&#8212;&#8221; he gasped weakly.
  Croisset's arm tightened about his waist.
  &#8220;She ees gone!&#8221; Howland heard him say; and there was something in  the half-breed's low voice that caused him to turn unquestioningly and  stagger along beside him in the direction of Prince Albert.
  And yet as he went, only half-conscious of what he was doing, and  leaning more and more heavily on his companion, he knew that it was  more than the girl's disappearance that he wanted to understand. For as  the blow had fallen on his head he was sure that he had heard a woman's  scream; and as he lay in the snow, dazed and choking, spending his last  effort in his struggle for life, there had come to him, as if from an  infinite distance, a woman's voice, and the words that it had uttered  pounded in his tortured brain now as his head dropped weakly against  Croisset's shoulder.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, you are killing him&#8212;killing him!&#8221;
  He tried to repeat them aloud, but his voice sounded only in an  incoherent murmur. Where the forest came down to the edge of the river  the half-breed stopped.
  &#8220;I must carry you, M'seur Howland,&#8221; he said; and as he staggered out  on the ice with his inanimate burden, he spoke softly to himself, &#8220;The  saints preserve me, but what would the sweet Meleese say if she knew  that Jean Croisset had come so near to losing the life of this M'seur  le engineer?<I> Ce monde est plein de fous!</I>&#8220;
