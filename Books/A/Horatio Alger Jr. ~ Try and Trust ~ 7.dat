  By the time they had ridden twenty miles both Herbert and Mr.  Holden  felt hungry. The fresh air had produced a similar effect upon  both. They  approached a broad, low building with a swinging sign and a  long piazza  in front, which it was easy to see was a country tavern. 
  &quot;Do you feel hungry, boy?&quot; inquired Abner Holden. 
  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; returned our hero. 
  &quot;So do I. I think I shall get some dinner here. You can get some,  too,  if you like.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, there's no occasion to thank me,&quot; said Mr. Holden, dryly. &quot;I  shall  pay for my dinner, and if you want any, you can pay for yours.&quot; 
  Herbert looked surprised. As he had entered Mr. Holden's employ, he   supposed of course that the latter would feel bound to provide for  him,  and it certainly seemed mean that he should be compelled to pay  for his  own dinner. However, he was beginning to suspect that his new  employer  was essentially a mean man. 
  &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; asked Herbert, at length. 
  &quot;Thirty-seven cents,&quot; was the reply. 
  It must be remembered that this was in the day of low prices, when  gold  was at par, and board could be obtained at first-class city  hotels for  two dollars and a half a day, and in country villages at  that amount by  the week. 
  &quot;Thirty-seven cents!&quot; Herbert hardly liked to break in upon his  scanty  hoard, but the morning air had sharpened his appetite, and he  felt that  he must have something to eat. Besides, he remembered one  thing which  fortunately Mr. Holden did not know, that in addition to  the five  dollars which Dr. Kent had given him he had the ten dollars  sent him by  his uncle, and not only that, but a little loose change  which he had  earned. 
  &quot;Well, are you going to get out?&quot; asked Abner Holden. &quot;It's nothing  to  me whether you take dinner or not.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I guess I will.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well,&quot; said Holden, who had a reason for being pleased with  his  decision. 
  Both went into the tavern. There were two or three loungers on a  settle,  who gazed at them curiously. One of them at once appeared to  recognize  Abner Holden. 
  &quot;How dy do, Holden?&quot; he said. &quot;Who've you got with you?&quot; 
  &quot;A boy I've taken,&quot; said Holden, shortly. 
  &quot;A pretty smart-looking boy. Where'd you pick him up?&quot; 
  &quot;Over in Waverley. He's got some pretty high notions, but I guess  I'll  take 'em out of him in time.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; chuckled the other; &quot;I warrant you will.&quot; 
  While this conversation was going on Herbert had entered the  tavern, but  he could not avoid hearing what was said, including Mr.  Holden's reply.  He was not frightened, but inwardly determined that he  would do his  duty, and then if Mr. Holden saw fit to impose upon him,  he would make  what resistance he was able. 
  &quot;I wonder what high notions he means,&quot; thought our hero. &quot;If he  expects  to make a slave of me, he will be mistaken, that's all.&quot; 
  &quot;Sit down there, and I'll go and order dinner,&quot; said Mr. Holden,   entering. 
  Just then, however, the landlord came in and greeted Abner Holden,  whom  he appeared to know. 
  &quot;I want dinner for two, Mr. Robinson,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;For two! You haven't brought your wife along with you, Holden?&quot; he   said, jocosely. 
  &quot;No, I haven't come across any such lady yet. I've got a boy here  who is  bound to me. And hark you, landlord,&quot; he added, in a lower  voice, that  Herbert might not hear, &quot;he will pay you for his dinner  out of a five-  dollar bill which he has with him. YOU NEEDN'T GIVE  BACK THE CHANGE TO  HIM, BUT TO ME.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; said the landlord, winking. 
  &quot;I prefer to keep the money for him. He has refused to give it up  and  this will give me a chance to get hold of it without any fuss.&quot; 
  &quot;All right.&quot; 
  &quot;If he kept it himself he'd spend it in some improper way.&quot; 
  &quot;Just so. I'll attend to it.&quot; 
  Now our hero was gifted with pretty sharp ears, and he caught  enough of  this conversation to understand Mr. Holden's plot, which he  straightway  determined should not succeed. 
  &quot;You shan't take me in this time, Mr. Holden,&quot; he thought. 
  He opened his pocketbook to see if he had enough small change to  pay for  his dinner without intrenching upon his bill. There proved to  be a  quarter and two half-dimes, amounting, of course, to thirty-five  cents.  This would not be quite sufficient. 
  &quot;I must change the bill somewhere,&quot; he said to himself. 
  Looking out of the tavern window, he saw the village store nearly   opposite. He took his cap and ran over. There was a clerk leaning with   his elbows upon the counter, appearing unoccupied. 
  It occurred to Herbert that he might want some paper and envelopes.  He  inquired the price. 
  &quot;We sell the paper at a penny a sheet, and the envelopes will cost  you  eight cents a package.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you may give me twelve sheets of paper and a package of   envelopes,&quot; said Herbert. 
  The package was done up for him and in payment he tendered the  bill. 
  The clerk gave him back four dollars and eighty cents in change. He  put  the money in his pocketbook, and the paper and envelopes in his  jacket-  pocket, and returned to the tavern well pleased with his  success. Mr.  Holden was in the barroom, taking a glass of &quot;bitters,&quot;  and had not  noticed the absence of our hero. 
  Dinner was soon ready. 
  There was some beefsteak and coffee and a whole apple pie. Herbert   surveyed the viands with satisfaction, having a decidedly good  appetite.  He soon found, however, that hungry as he was, he stood a  poor chance  with Abner Holden; that gentleman, being a very rapid  eater, managed to  appropriate two-thirds of the beefsteak and  three-quarters of the pie.  However, the supply being abundant, Herbert  succeeded in making a  satisfactory repast, and did not grudge the  amount which he knew he  should have to pay for it before leaving. 
  &quot;Now,&quot; said Abner Holden, his eyes twinkling at the thought of our   hero's coming discomfiture, &quot;we'll go and settle our bill.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well,&quot; said Herbert, quietly. 
  They entered the public room and advanced to the bar. 
  &quot;This boy wants to pay for his dinner, Mr. Robinson,&quot; said Abner,   significantly. 
  &quot;How much will it be?&quot; asked Herbert. 
  &quot;Thirty-seven cents.&quot; 
  Herbert took out of his vest pocket a quarter, a dime and two  cents, and  handed them over. 
  To say that Abner Holden looked amazed is not sufficient. He looked   disgusted and wronged, and glared at Herbert as if to inquire how he   could have the face to outrage his feelings in that way. 
  &quot;Ho! ho!&quot; laughed the landlord, who, having no interest in the  matter,  was amused at the course affairs had taken. 
  Herbert suppressed his desire to laugh, and looked as if he had no   knowledge of Mr. Holden's plans. 
  &quot;Where did you get that money?&quot; growled Abner, with a scowl. 
  &quot;Out of my vest pocket,&quot; said Herbert, innocently. 
  &quot;I know that, of course, but I thought you had only a bill.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, I got that changed at the store.&quot; 
  &quot;How dared you go over there without my permission?&quot; roared Abner. 
  &quot;I didn't think it necessary to ask your permission to go across  the  street.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, you know it now. Don't you go there again without my  knowledge.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Did you buy anything at the store?&quot; continued Mr. Holden. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;What was it?&quot; 
  &quot;Some paper and envelopes.&quot; 
  &quot;Humph!&quot; muttered Abner, discontentedly. 
  He proceeded to pay his own bill and in a few minutes got into the  wagon  and drove off rather sulkily. Herbert saw that Mr. Holden was  disturbed  by the failure of his little plan, and felt amused rather  than  otherwise. But when he reflected that he was going to live with  this  man, and be, to a considerable extent under his control, he felt   inclined to be sad. One thing he resolved that he would not submit to   tyranny. The world was wide, and he felt able to earn his own living.  He  would give Mr. Holden a trial, and if he treated him with  reasonable  fairness he would remain with him. But he was not going to  be any man's  slave. 
  Meanwhile they were getting over the road, and a few more hours  brought  them to their journey's end. 
  Abner Holden's house stood in considerable need of paint. It had no   great pretensions to architectural beauty, being about as handsome for  a  house as Abner Holden was for a man. There was a dilapidated barn, a   little to one side, and the yard was littered up with a broken wagon,  a  woodpile and various odds and ends, giving the whole a very untidy  look. 
  &quot;Is this where you live, Mr. Holden?&quot; asked Herbert, looking about  him. 
  &quot;Yes, and I'm glad to get home. Do you know how to unharness a  horse?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then jump out and unharness this horse. A man will come for it to-   morrow.&quot; 
  Herbert did as directed. Then he took his little trunk from the  wagon,  and went with it to the back door and knocked.
