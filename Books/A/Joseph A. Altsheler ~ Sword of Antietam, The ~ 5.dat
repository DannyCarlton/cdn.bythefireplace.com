  The sunbeams seemed fairly to dance over the dusty earth. The dust  was not only over the earth, but over everything, men, animals, wagons  and tents. Dick Mason who had struggled so hard through a storm but a  few nights ago now longed for another like it. Anything to get away  from this blinding blaze.
  But he soon forgot heat and dust. He was conscious of a great quiver  and thrill running through the whole army. Something was happening.  Something had happened, but nobody knew what. Warner and Pennington  felt the same quiver and thrill, because they looked at him as if in  inquiry. Colonel Winchester showed it, too. He said nothing, but gazed  uneasily toward the Northern horizon. Dick found himself looking that  way also. Along the Rappahannock there was but little firing now, and  he began to forget the river which had loomed so large in the affairs  of the armies. Perhaps the importance of the Rappahannock had passed.
  It was said that Pope himself with his staff had ridden away toward  Washington, but Dick did not know. Far off toward the capital he saw  dust clouds, but he concluded that they must be made by marching  reinforcements.
  The long hot hours dragged and then came a messenger. It was Shepard  who had reported to headquarters and who afterwards came over to the  shade of a tree where Colonel Winchester and his little staff were  gathered. He was on the verge of exhaustion. He was black under the  eyes and the veins of his neck were distended. Dust covered him from  head to foot. He threw himself on the ground and drank deeply from a  canteen of cool water that Dick handed to him. All saw that Shepard,  the spy, the man whose life was a continual danger, who had never  before shown emotion, was in a state of excitement, and if they waited  a little he would speak of his own accord.
  Shepard took the canteen from his lips, drew several long deep  breaths of relief and said:
  &#8220;Do you know what I have seen?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't, but I infer from your manner, Shepard, that it must be of  great importance,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester.
  &#8220;I've seen Stonewall Jackson at the head of half of Lee's army  behind us! Standing between us and Washington!&#8221;
  &#8220;What! Impossible! How could he get there?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's possible, because it's been done&#8212;I've seen the rebel army  behind us. In these civilian clothes of mine, I've been in their ranks,  and I've talked with their men. While they were amusing us here on the  Rappahannock with their cannon, Jackson with the best of the army  crossed the river higher up, passed through Thoroughfare Gap, marching  two or three days before a soul of ours knew it, and then struck our  great camp at Bristoe Station.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shepard, you must be sunstruck!&#8221;
  &#8220;My mind was never clearer. What I saw at close range General Pope  himself saw at long range. He and his staff and a detachment came near  enough to see the looting and burning of all our stores&#8212;I don't  suppose so many were ever gathered together before. But I was right  there. You ought to have seen the sight, Colonel, when those ragged  rebels who had been living on green corn burst into our camp. I've  heard about the Goths and Vandals coming down on Rome and it must have  been something like it. They ate as I never saw anybody eat before, and  then throwing away their rags they put on our new uniforms which were  stored there in thousands. At least half the rebel army must now be  wearing the Union blue. And the way they danced about and sang was  enough to make a loyal man's heart sick.&#8221;
  &#8220;You told all this to General Pope?&#8221;
  &#8220;I did, sir, but I could not make him believe the half of it. He  insists that it can only be a raiding detachment, that it is impossible  for a great army to have come to such a place. But, sir, I was among  them. I know Stonewall Jackson, and I saw him with my own eyes. He was  there at the head of thirty thousand men, and we've already lost stores  worth millions and millions. Jeb Stuart was there, too. I saw him. And  I saw Munford, who leads Jackson's cavalry since the death of Turner  Ashby. Oh, they'll find out soon enough that it's Jackson. We're  trapped, sir! I tell you we're trapped, and our own commander-in-chief  won't believe it. Good God, Colonel, the trap has shut down on us and  if we get out of it we've got to be up and doing! This is no time for  waiting!&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester saw from the rapidity and emphasis with which  Shepard spoke that his excitement had increased, but knowing the man's  great devotion to the Union he had no rebuke for his plain speech.
  &#8220;You have done splendid work, Mr. Shepard,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the  commander- in-chief will recognize what great risks you have run for  the cause. I've no doubt that the accuracy of your reports will soon be  proved.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester in truth believed every word that Shepard had  said, sinister though they were. He said that Jackson was behind them,  that he had done the great destruction at Bristoe Station and he had  not the slightest doubt that Jackson was there.
  Shepard flushing a little with gratification at Colonel Winchester's  praise quickly recovered his customary self possession. Once more he  was the iron-willed, self-contained man who daily dared everything for  the cause he served.
  &#8220;Thank you, Colonel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I've got to go out and get a little  food now. All I say will be proved soon enough.&#8221;
  The three boys, like Colonel Winchester, did not doubt the truth of  Shepard's news, and they looked northeast for the dust clouds which  should mark the approach of Jackson.
  &#8220;We've been outmaneuvered,&#8221; said Warner to Dick, &#8220;but it's no reason  why we should be outfought.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, George, it isn't. We've eighty thousand men as brave as any in  the world, and, from what we hear they haven't as many. We ought to  smash their old trap all to pieces.&#8221;
  &#8220;If our generals will only give us a chance.&#8221;
  Shepard's prediction that his news would soon prove true was  verified almost at once. General Pope himself returned to his army and  dispatch after dispatch arrived stating that Jackson and his whole  force had been at Bristoe Station while the Union stores were burning.
  &#8220;Now is our chance,&#8221; said Dick to his comrades, &#8220;why doesn't the  general move on Jackson at once, and destroy him before Lee can come to  his help?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm praying for it,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;From what I hear it's going to be done,&#8221; said Pennington.
  Their hopes came true. Pope at once took the bold course, and  marched on Jackson, but the elusive Stonewall was gone. They tramped  about in the heat and dust in search of him. One portion of the army  including Colonel Winchester's regiment turned off in the afternoon  toward a place of a few houses called Warrenton. It lay over toward the  Gap through which Jackson had gone and while the division ten thousand  strong did not expect to find anything there it was nevertheless  ordered to look.
  Dick rode by the side of his colonel ready for any command, but the  mystery, and uncertainty had begun to weigh upon him again. It seemed  when they had the first news that Jackson was behind them, that they  had a splendid opportunity to turn upon him and annihilate him before  Lee could come. But he was gone. They had looked upon the smoldering  ruins of their great supply camp, but they had found there no trace of  a Confederate soldier. Was Harry Kenton right, when he told them they  could not beat Jackson? He asked himself angrily why the man would not  stay and fight. He believed, too, that he must be off there somewhere  to the right, and he listened eagerly but vainly for the distant throb  of guns in the east.
  A cloud of dust hovered over the ten thousand as they marched on in  the blazing sunshine. The country was well peopled, but all the  inhabitants had disappeared save a few, and from not one of these could  they obtain a scrap of information.
  Dick noticed through the dusty veil a heavy wood on their left  extending for a long distance. Then as in a flash, he saw that the  whole forest was filled with troops, and he saw also two batteries  galloping from it toward the crest of a ridge. It occurred to him  instantly that here was the army of Jackson, and others who saw had the  same instinctive belief.
  There was a flash and roar from the batteries. Shot and shell cut  through the clouds of dust and among the ranks of the men in blue. Now  came from the forest a vast shout, the defiant rebel yell and nobody in  the column doubted that Jackson was there. He had swung away toward the  Gap, where Lee could come to him more readily, and he would fight the  whole Union army until Lee came up.
  As the roar of the first discharge from the batteries was dying  swarms of skirmishers sprang up from ambush and poured a storm of  bullets upon the Union front and flanks. A cry as of anguish arose from  the column and it reeled back, but the men, many of them hardy young  farmers from the West, men of staunch stuff, were eager to get at the  enemy and the terrible surprise could not daunt them. Uttering a  tremendous shout they charged directly upon the Southern force.
  It was a case largely of vanguards, the main forces not yet having  come up, but the two detachments charged into each other with a courage  and fierceness that was astounding. In a minute the woods and fields  were filled with fire and smoke, and hissing shells and bullets. Men  fell by hundreds, but neither side yielded. The South could not drive  away the North and the North could not hurl back the South.
  The field of battle became a terrible and deadly vortex. The fire of  the opposing lines blazed in the faces of each other. Often they were  only three or four score yards apart. Ewell, Jackson's ablest and most  trusted lieutenant, fell wounded almost to death, and lay long upon the  field. Other Southern generals fell also, and despite their superior  numbers they could not drive back the North.
  Dick never had much recollection of the combat, save a reek of fire  and smoke in which men fought. He saw Colonel Winchester's horse pitch  forward on his head and springing from his own he pulled the  half-stunned colonel to his feet. Both leaped aside just in time to  avoid Dick's own falling horse, which had been slain by a shell. Then  the colonel ran up and down the lines of his men, waving his sword and  encouraging them to stand fast.
  The Southern lines spread out and endeavored to overlap the Union  men, but they were held back by a deep railroad cut and masses of  felled timber. The combat redoubled in fury. Cannon and rifles together  made a continuous roar. Both sides seemed to have gone mad with the  rage of battle.
  The Southern generals astonished at such a resistance by a smaller  force, ordered up more men and cannon. The Union troops were slowly  pushed back by the weight of numbers, but then the night, the coming of  which neither had noticed, swept down suddenly upon them, leaving  fifteen hundred men, nearly a third of those engaged, fallen upon the  small area within which the two vanguards had fought.
  But the Union men did not retreat far. Practically, they were  holding their ground, when the darkness put an end to the battle, and  they were full of elation at having fought a draw with superior numbers  of the formidable Jackson. Dick, although exultant, was so much  exhausted that he threw himself upon the ground and panted for breath.  When he was able to rise he looked for Warner and Pennington and found  them uninjured. So was Sergeant Whitley, but the sergeant, contrary to  his custom, was gloomy.
  &#8220;What's the matter, sergeant?&#8221; exclaimed Dick in surprise. &#8220;Didn't  we give 'em a great fight?&#8221;
  &#8220;Splendid, Mr. Mason, I don't believe that troops ever fought better  than ours did. But we're not many here. Where's all the rest of our  army? Scattered, while I'm certain that Jackson with twenty-five or  thirty thousand men is in front of us, with more coming. We'll fall  back. We'll have to do it before morning.&#8221;
  The sergeant on this occasion had the power of divination. An hour  after midnight the whole force which had fought with so much heroism  was withdrawn. It was a strange night to the whole Union army, full of  sinister omens.
  Pope, in his quest for Jackson, had heard about sunset the booming  of guns in the west, but he could not believe that the Southern general  was there. Many of his dispatches had been captured by the hard-riding  cavalry of Stuart. His own division commanders had lost touch with him.  It was not possible for him to know what to do until morning, and no  one could tell him. Meanwhile Longstreet was advancing in the darkness  through the Gap to reinforce Jackson.
  Dick had found another horse belonging to a slain owner, and, in the  darkness, his heart full of bitterness, he rode back beside Colonel  Winchester toward Manassas. Could they never win a big victory in the  east? The men were brave and tenacious. They had proved it over and  over again, but they were always mismanaged. It seemed to him that they  were never sent to the right place at the right time.
  Nevertheless, many of the Northern generals, able and patriotic,  achieved great deeds before the dawn of that momentous morning.  Messengers were riding in the darkness in a zealous attempt to gather  the forces together. There was yet abundant hope that they could crush  Jackson before Lee came, and in the darkness brigade after brigade  marched toward Warrenton.
  Dick, after tasting all the bitterness of retreat, felt his hopes  rise again. They had not really been beaten. They had fought a superior  force of Jackson's own men to a standstill. He could never forget that.  He cherished it and rolled it under his tongue. It was an omen of what  was to come. If they could only get leaders of the first rank they  would soon end the war.
  He found himself laughing aloud in the anticipation of what Pope's  Army of Virginia would do in the coming day to the rebels. It might  even happen that McClellan with the Army of the Potomac would also come  upon the field. And then! Lee and Jackson thought they had Pope in a  trap! Pope and McClellan would have them between the hammer and the  anvil, and they would be pounded to pieces!
  &#8220;Here, stop that foolishness, Dick! Quit, I say, quit it at once!&#8221;
  It was Warner who was speaking, and he gripped Dick's arm hard,  while he peered anxiously into his face.
  &#8220;What's the matter with you?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;What do you find to  laugh at? Besides, I don't like the way you laugh.&#8221;
  Dick shook himself, and then rubbed his hand across his brow.
  &#8220;Thanks, George,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'm glad you called me back to myself. I  was thinking what would happen to the enemy if McClellan and the Army  of the Potomac came up also, and I was laughing over it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, the next time, don't you laugh at a thing until it happens.  You may have to take your laugh back.&#8221;
  Dick shook himself again, and the nervous excitement passed.
  &#8220;You always give good advice, George,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you know where  we are?&#8221;
  &#8220;I couldn't name the place, but we're not so far from Warrenton that  we can't get back there in a short time and tackle Jackson again. Dick,  see all those moving lights to right and left of us. They're the  brigades coming up in the night. Isn't it a weird and tremendous scene?  You and I and Pennington will see this night over and over again, many  and many a time.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's so, George,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I feel the truth of what you say all  through me. Listen to the rumble of the cannon wheels! I hear 'em on  both sides of us, and behind us, and I've no doubt, too, that it's  going on before us, where the Southerners are massing their batteries.  How the lights move! It's the field of Manassas again, and we're going  to win this time!&#8221;
  All of Dick's senses were excited once more, and everything he saw  was vivid and highly colored. Warner, cool of blood as he habitually  was, had no words of rebuke for him now, because he, too, was affected  in the same way. The fields and plains of Manassas were alive not alone  with marching armies, but the ghosts of those who had fallen there the  year before rose and walked again.
  Despite the darkness everything swelled into life again for Dick.  Off there was the little river of Manassas, Young's Branch, the railway  station, and the Henry House, around which the battle had raged so  fiercely. They would have won the victory then if it had not been for  Stonewall Jackson. If he had not been there the war would have been  ended on that sanguinary summer day.
  But Jackson was in front of them now, and they had him fast. Lee and  Jackson had thought to trap Pope, but Jackson himself was in the trap,  and they would destroy him utterly. His admiration for the great  Southern general had changed for the time into consuming rage. They  must overwhelm him, annihilate him, sweep him from the face of the  earth.
  They mounted again and moved back, but did not go far.
  &#8220;Get down, Dick,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;Here's food for us, and  hot coffee. I don't remember myself how long we've been in the saddle  and how long we've been without food, but we mustn't go into battle  until we've eaten.&#8221;
  Dick was the last of the officers to dismount. He, too, did not  remember how long they had been in the saddle. He could not say at that  moment, whether it had been one night or two. He ate and drank  mechanically, but hungrily&#8212;the Union army nearly always had plenty of  stores&#8212;and then he felt better and stronger.
  A faint bluish tint was appearing under the gray horizon in the  east. Dick felt the touch of a light wind on his forehead. The dawn was  coming.
  Yes, the dawn was coming, but it was coming heavy with sinister  omens and the frown of battle. Before the bluish tint in the east had  turned to silver Dick heard the faint and far thudding of great guns,  and closer a heavy regular beat which he knew was the gallop of  cavalry. Surely the North could not fail now. Fierce anger against  those who would break up the Union surged up in him again.
  The gray came at last, driving the bluish tint away, and the sun  rose hot and bright over the field of Manassas which already had been  stained with the blood of one fierce battle. But now the armies were  far greater. Nearly a hundred and fifty thousand men were gathering for  the combat, and Dick was still hoping that McClellan would come with  seventy or eighty thousand more. But within the Confederate lines,  where they must always win and never lose, because losing meant to lose  all there was a stern determination to shatter Pope and his superior  numbers before McClellan could come. Never had the genius and  resolution of the two great Southern leaders burned more brightly.
  As the brazen sun swung slowly up Dick felt that the intense nervous  excitement he had felt the night before was seizing him again. The  officers of the regiment remained on foot. Colonel Winchester had sent  their horses away to some cavalrymen who had lost their own. He and his  staff and other officers, dismounted, could lead the men better into  battle.
  And that it was battle, great and bloody, the youngest of them all  could see. Never had an August day been brighter and hotter. Every  object seemed to swell into new size in the vivid and burning sunlight.  Plain before them lay Jackson's army. Two of his regiments were between  them and a turnpike that Dick remembered well. Off to the left ran the  dark masses in gray, until they ended against a thick wood. In the  center was a huge battery, and Dick from his position could see the  mouths of the cannon waiting for them.
  But he also saw the great line of the Northern Army. It was both  deeper and longer than that of the South, and he knew that the men were  full of resolve and courage.
  &#8220;How many have we got here?&#8221; Dick heard himself asking Warner.
  &#8220;Forty or fifty thousand, I suppose,&#8221; he heard Warner replying, &#8220;and  before night there will be eighty thousand. Our line is two miles long  now. We ought to wrap around Jackson and crush him to death. Listen to  the bugles! What a mellow note! And how they draw men on to death! And  listen to the throbbing of the big cannon, too!&#8221;
  Warner's face was flushed. He had become excited, as the two armies  stood there, and looked at each other a moment or two like prize  fighters in the ring before closing in battle. Then they heard the  order to charge and far up and down the line their own cannon opened  with a crash so great that Dick and his comrades could not hear one  another talking.
  Then they charged. The whole army lifted itself up and rushed at the  enemy, animated by patriotism, the fire of battle and the desire for  revenge. Among the officers were Milroy and Schenck and others who had  been beaten by Jackson in the valley. There, too, was the brigade of  Germans whom Jackson had beaten at Cross Keyes. Many of them were  veterans of the sternest discipline known in Europe and they longed  fiercely for revenge. And there were more Germans, too, under Schurz&#8212;  hired Germans, fighting nearly a hundred years before to prevent the  Union&#8212;and free Germans now fighting to save it.
  Driven forward thus by all the motives that sway men in battle, the  Union army rushed upon Jackson. Confident from many victories and  trusting absolutely in their leader the Southern defense received the  mighty charge without flinching. The wood now swarmed with riflemen and  they filled the air with their bullets, so many of them that their  passage was like the continual rush of a hurricane. Along the whole  line came the same metallic scream, and the great battery in the center  was a volcano, pouring forth a fiery hurricane of shot and shell.
  Dick felt their front lines being shorn. Although he was untouched  it was an actual physical sensation. He could see but little save that  fearful blaze in their faces, and the cries of the wounded and dying  were drowned by the awful roar of so many cannon and rifles.
  The cloud of dust and smoke had become immense and overwhelming in  an instant, but it was pierced always in front by the blaze of fire,  and by its flaming light Dick saw the long lines of the Southern men,  their faces gray and fixed, as he knew those of his own comrades were.
  But the charge, brave, even reckless, failed. The brigades broke in  vain on Jackson's iron front. Riddled by the fire of the great battery  and of the riflemen they could not go on and live. The Germans had  longed for revenge, but they did not get it. The South Carolinians fell  upon them at the edge of the wood and hurled them back. They rallied,  and charged again, but again they were handled terribly, and were  forced back by the charging masses of the Southerners.
  Dick had been at Shiloh. He had seen the men of the west in a great  battle, and now he saw the men of the east in a battle yet greater.  There it had been largely in the forest, here it was mostly in the  open, yet he saw but little more. One of the extraordinary features of  this battle was dust. Trampled up from the dry fields by fighting men  in scores of thousands it rose in vast floating clouds that permeated  everything. It was even more persistent than the smoke. It clogged  Dick's throat. It stung and burnt him like powder. Often it filled his  eyes so completely that for a moment or two he could not see the blaze  of the cannon and rifle fire, almost in his face.
  But as they fell back he felt again that sensation of actual  physical pain, although he was still untouched. Added to it was an  intense mental anguish. They were failing! They had been driven back!  They had not crushed Jackson! He forgot all about Colonel Winchester,  and his comrades Warner and Pennington. He forgot all about his own  danger in this terrible reversal of his hopes, and he began to shout  angrily at the men to stand. He did not know by and by that no sound  came from his mouth, that words could not come from a throat so choked  with dust and burned gunpowder.
  But the charge was made again. The thudding great guns now told all  the Northern divisions where Jackson was. The eighty thousand men of  Pope were crowding forward to attack him, and the batteries were  galloping over the plateau to add to the volume of shot and shell that  was poured upon the Southern ranks.
  Dick was quite unconscious of the passage of time. Hope had sprung  anew in his breast. He heard a report that ten thousand fresh troops  under Kearney had arrived and were attacking the Southerners in the  wood. He knew by the immense volume of fire coming from that point that  the report was true, and he heard that McDowell, too, would soon be at  hand with nearly thirty thousand men.
  Then he saw Colonel Winchester, his face a mass of grime and his  clothing flecked with blood. But he did not seem to have suffered any  wound and he was calmly rallying his men.
  &#8220;It's hot!&#8221; Dick shouted, why he knew not.
  &#8220;Yes, my boy, and it will soon be hotter! Look at the new brigades  coming into battle! See them on both right and left! We'll crush  Jackson yet!&#8221;
  It was now mid-morning, and neither Colonel Winchester nor any other  of the Northern officers facing the Southern force knew that Lee and  the other Southern army was at hand. The front ranks of Longstreet were  already in battle, and the most difficult and dangerous of all tasks  was accomplished. Two armies coming from points widely divergent, but  acting in concert had joined upon the field of battle at the very  moment when the junction meant the most. Lee had come, but McClellan  and the Army of the Potomac were far away.
  Dick heard the trumpets calling again, and once more they charged,  hurling heavy masses now upon the wood, which was held by the Southern  general, A. P. Hill. Rifle fire gave way to bayonet charges by either  side, and after swaying back and forth the Union men held the wood for  a while, but at last they were driven out to stay, and as they  retreated cannon and rifles decimated their ranks.
  The regiment had suffered so terribly that after its retreat it was  compelled to lie down a while and rest. Dick gasped for breath, but he  was not as much excited as he had been earlier in the day. Perhaps one  can become hardened to anything. Although he and his immediate comrades  were resting he could see no diminution of the battle.
  As far to left and right as the eye reached, cannon and rifles  blazed and thundered. In front of their own exhausted regiment hundreds  of sharpshooters, creeping forward, were now pouring a deadly fire  among the Southern troops who held the wood. They were men of the west  and northwest, accustomed all their lives to the use of firearms, and  if a Confederate officer in the forest showed himself for a moment it  was at the risk of his life. Captains and lieutenants fell fast beneath  the aim of the sharpshooters.
  The burning sun was at the zenith, pouring fiery rays upon the vast  conflict which raged along a front of two miles. Pope himself was now  upon the field and his troops were pouring from every point to his aid.  So deadly was the fire of the sharpshooters that they regained the  wood, driving out the Southerners who had exhausted their cartridges.  Hill's division of the Confederates was almost cut to pieces by the  cannon and rifles, and the Southern leaders from their posts on the  hills saw brigades and regiments continually coming to the help of the  North.
  Dick saw or rather felt the fortunes of the North rising again, and  as his regiment stood up for action once more he began to shout with  the others in triumph. The roar of the battle grew so steady that the  voices of men became audible and articulate beneath it.
  &#8220;They shut their trap down upon us, but we're breaking that trap all  to pieces,&#8221; he heard Pennington say.
  &#8220;Looks as if we might win a victory,&#8221; said the cooler Warner.
  Then he heard no more, as they were once again upon the enemy who  received them almost hand to hand, and the battle swelled anew. It was  now long past noon, and in that prodigious canopy of dust and fire and  smoke it seemed for a while that the Union army in truth had shattered  the trap. The men in gray were borne back by the courage and weight of  their opponents. Hooker, Kearney, Reynolds and all the gallant generals  of the North continually urged on their troops. Confidence in victory  at last passed through all the army, and incited it to greater efforts.
  But Jackson was undaunted. Never was he cooler. Never did his genius  shine more brilliantly. Never did any man in all the fury and turmoil  of battle, amid a thousand conflicting reports and appalling confusion,  have a keener perception, a greater power to sum up what was actually  passing, and a better knowledge of what to do.
  Lee was a mile away, standing on a wooded hill, the bearded  Longstreet by his side, watching the battle in his immediate front,  where accumulating masses under Pope's own eye were gathering. On the  other flank where Jackson stood and the conflict was heaviest he  trusted all to his great lieutenant and not in vain.
  Jackson had formed his plan. There came for a few moments a lull in  the battle which had now lasted nine hours, and then gathering a  powerful reserve he sent them charging through the wood with the  bayonet. Dick saw the massive line of glittering steel coming on at the  double quick and he felt his regiment giving back. The men could not  help it. Physically exhausted and with ammunition running low they  slowly yielded the wood. Many of the youths wept with rage, but  although they had lost thousands in five desperate charges they were  compelled to see all five fail.
  Dick, aghast, gazed at Warner through the smoke.
  &#8220;It's true!&#8221; gasped Warner, &#8220;we didn't break the trap, Dick. But  maybe they'll succeed off there to the left! Our own commander is  there, and they say that Lee himself has come to the help of Jackson!&#8221;
  They had been driven back at all points and their own battle was  dying, but off to the left it thundered a while longer, and then as  night suddenly rushed over the field it, too, sank, leaving the hostile  forces on that wing also still face to face, but with the North pushed  back.
  The coming of night was as sudden to Dick as if it had been the  abrupt dropping of a great dark blanket. In the fury of conflict he had  not noticed the gathering shadows in the west. The dimness around him,  if he had taken time to think about it, he would have ascribed to the  vast columns of dust that eddied and surged about.
  Again it was the dust that he felt and remembered. The surging back  and forth of seven score thousand men, the tread of horses and the  wheels of hundreds of cannon raised it in such quantities that it  covered the forest and the armies with a vast whitish curtain. Even in  the darkness it showed dim and ghastly like a funeral veil.
  Out of that fatal forest came a dreadful moaning. Dick did not know  whether it was the wind among the leaves or the dying. Once more the  ghosts of the year before walked the fatal field, but the ghosts of  this year would be a far greater company. They had not broken the trap  and Dick knew that the battle was far from over.
  It would be renewed in the morning with greater fierceness than  ever, but he was grateful for the present darkness and rest. He and his  comrades had thrown themselves upon the ground, and they felt as if  they could never move again. Their bones did not ache. They merely felt  dead within them.
  Dick was roused after a long time. The camp cooks were bringing food  and coffee. He saw a figure lying at his feet as still as death, and he  shoved it with his foot.
  &#8220;Get up, Frank,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You're not dead.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I'm not, but I'm as good as dead. You just let me finish dying  in peace.&#8221;
  Dick shoved him again and Pennington sat up. When he saw the food  and coffee he suddenly remembered to be hungry. Warner was already  eating and drinking. Off to the left they still heard cannon and  rifles, although the sound was sinking. Occasionally flashes from the  mouths of the great guns illumined the darkness.
  Dick did not know what time it was. He had no idea how long he had  been lying upon the ground panting, the air surcharged with menace and  suspense. The vast clouds of dust, impregnated with burned gunpowder  still floated about, and it scorched his mouth and throat as he  breathed it.
  The boys, after eating and drinking lay down again. They still heard  the firing of pickets, but it was no more than the buzzing of bees to  them, and after a while they fell into the sleep of nervous and  physical exhaustion. But while many of the soldiers slept all of the  generals were awake.
  It was a singular fact but in the night that divided the great  battle of the Second Manassas into two days both sides were full of  confidence. Jackson's men, who had borne the brunt of the first day,  rested upon their arms and awaited the dawn with implicit confidence in  their leader. On the other flank Lee and Longstreet were massing their  men for a fresh attack.
  The losses within the Union lines were replaced by reinforcements.  Pope rode among them, sanguine, full of hope, telegraphing to  Washington that the enemy had lost two to his one, and that Lee was  retreating toward the mountains.
  Dick slept uneasily through the night, and rose to another hot  August sun. Then the two armies looked at each other and it seemed that  each was waiting for the other to begin, as the morning hours dragged  on and only the skirmishers were busy. During this comparative peace,  the heavy clouds of dust were not floating about, and Dick whose body  had come to life again walked back and forth with his colonel, gazing  through their glasses at the enemy. He scarcely noticed it, but Colonel  Winchester's manner toward him had become paternal. The boy merely  ascribed it to the friendly feeling an officer would feel for a  faithful aide, but he knew that he had in his colonel one to whom he  could speak both as a friend and a protector. Walking together they  talked freely of the enemy who stood before them in such an imposing  array.
  &#8220;Colonel,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;do you think General Pope is correct in  stating that one wing of the Southern army is already retreating  through Thoroughfare Gap?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't, Dick. I don't think it is even remotely probable. I'm  quite sure, too, that we have the whole Confederate army in front of  us. We'll have to beat both Lee and Jackson, if we can.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where do you think the main attack will be?&#8221;
  &#8220;On Jackson, who is still in front of us. But we have waited a long  time. It must be full noon now.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is past noon, sir, but I hear the trumpets, calling up our men.&#8221;
  &#8220;They are calling to us, too.&#8221;
  The regiment shifted a little to the right, where a great column was  forming for a direct attack upon the Confederate lines. Twenty thousand  men stood in a vast line and forty thousand were behind them to march  in support.
  Dick had thought that he would be insensible to emotions, but his  heart began to throb again. The spectacle thrilled and awed him&#8212;the  great army marching to the attack and the resolute army awaiting it.  Soon he heard behind him the firing of the artillery which sent shot  and shell over their heads at the enemy. A dozen cannon came into  action, then twenty, fifty, a hundred and more, and the earth trembled  with the mighty concussion.
  Dick felt the surge of triumph. They had yet met no answering fire.  Perhaps General Pope and not Colonel Winchester had been right after  all, and the Confederates were crushed. Awaiting them was only a rear  guard which would flee at the first flash of the bayonets in the wood.
  The great line marched steadily onward, and the cannon thundered and  roared over the heads of the men raking the wood with steel. Still no  reply. Surely the sixty thousand Union men would now march over  everything. They were driving in the swarms of skirmishers. Dick could  see them retreating everywhere, in the wood over the hills and along an  embankment.
  Warner was on his right and Pennington on his left. Dick glanced at  them and he saw the belief in speedy victory expressed on the faces of  both. It seemed to him, too, that nothing could now stop the massive  columns that Pope was sending forward against the thinned ranks of the  Confederates.
  They were much nearer and he saw gray lines along an embankment and  in a wood. Then above the crash and thunder of their covering artillery  he heard another sound. It was the Southern bugles calling with a  piercing note to their own men just as the Northern trumpets had  called.
  Dick saw a great gray multitude suddenly pour forward. It looked to  him in the blur and the smoke like an avalanche, and in truth it was a  human avalanche, a far greater force of the South than they expected to  meet there. Directly in front of the Union column stood the Stonewall  Brigade, and all the chosen veterans of Stonewall Jackson's army.
  &#8220;It's a fight, face to face,&#8221; Dick heard Colonel Winchester say.
  Then he saw a Union officer, whose name he did not know suddenly  gallop out in front of the division, wave his saber over his head and  shout the charge. A tremendous rolling cry came from the blue ranks and  Dick physically felt the whole division leap forward and rush at the  enemy.
  Dick saw the officer who had made himself the leader of the charge  gallop straight at a breastwork that the Southerners had built, reach  and stand, horse and rider, a moment at the top, then both fall in a  limp heap. The next instant the officer, not dead but wounded, was  dragged a prisoner behind the embankment by generous foes who had  refused to shoot at him until compelled to do so.
  The Union men, with a roar, followed their champion, and Dick felt a  very storm burst upon them. The Southerners had thrown up earthworks at  midnight and thousands of riflemen lying behind them sent in a fire at  short range that caused the first Union line to go down like falling  grain. Cannon from the wood and elsewhere raked them through and  through.
  It was a vortex of fire and death. The Confederates themselves were  losing heavily, but taught by the stern Jackson and knowing that his  eye was upon them they refused to yield. The Northern charge broke on  their front, but the men did not retreat far. The shrill trumpet called  them back to the charge, and once more the blue masses hurled  themselves upon the barrier of fire and steel, to break again, and to  come yet a third time at the trumpet's call. Often the combatants were  within ten yards of one another, but strive as they would the Union  columns could not break through the Confederate defense.
  Elsewhere the men of Hill and Longstreet showed a sternness and  valor equal to that of Jackson's. Their ranks held firm everywhere, and  now, as the long afternoon drew on, the eye of Lee, watching every  rising and falling wave of the battle, saw his chance. He drew his  batteries together in great masses and as the last charge broke on  Jackson's lines the trumpets sounded the charge for the Southern troops  who hitherto had stood on the defensive.
  Dick heard a tremendous shout, the great rebel yell, that he had  heard so often before, and that he was destined to hear so often again.  Through the clouds of smoke and dust he saw the long lines of Southern  bayonets advancing swiftly. His regiment, which had already lost more  than half its numbers, was borne back by an appalling weight.
  Then hope deserted the boy for the first time. The Union was not to  be saved here on this field. It was instead another lost Manassas, but  far greater than the first. The genius of Lee and Jackson which bore up  the Confederacy was triumphing once again. Dick shut his teeth in grim  despair. He heard the triumphant shouts of the advancing enemy, and he  saw that not only his own regiment, but the whole Northern line, was  being driven back, slowly it is true, but they were going.
  Now at the critical moment, Lee was hurling forward every man and  gun. Although his army was inferior in numbers he was always superior  at the point of contact, and his exultant veterans pressed harder and  harder upon their weakening foes. Only the artillery behind them now  protected Dick and his comrades. But the Confederates still came with a  rush.
  Jackson was leading on his own men who had stood so long on the  defensive. The retreating Union line was broken, guns were lost, and  there was a vast turmoil and confusion. Yet out of it some order  finally emerged, and although the Union army was now driven back at  every point it inflicted heavy losses upon its foe, and under the lead  of brave commanders great masses gathered upon the famous Henry Hill,  resolved, although they could not prevent defeat, to save the army from  destruction.
  Night was coming down for the second time upon the field of battle,  lost to the North, although the North was ready to fight again.
  Lee and Jackson looked upon the heavy Union masses gathered at the  Henry Hill, and then looking at the coming darkness they stopped the  attack. Night heavier than usual came down over the field, covering  with its friendly veil those who had lost and those who had won, and  the twenty-five thousand who had fallen.
