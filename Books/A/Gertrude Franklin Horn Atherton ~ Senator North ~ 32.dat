Betty had organized a picnic for the following day, inviting several  acquaintances from the hotel; and they all drove to a favourite spot  in the forest. Mrs. Madison's maid had charge of many cushions, and  disposed her tiny mistress--who looked like a wood fairy in lilac  mull--comfortably on a bed of pine needles. Major Carter felt young  once more as he grilled steaks at a camp-fire, and Harriet enchanted  him with her rapt attention while his memory rioted in deeds of war.    
Senator Burleigh had never appeared so well, Betty thought. There was  an out-of-door atmosphere about him at any time; no doubt he had been  a mighty wind in the Senate more than once during the stormy passage  of the Tariff Bill; but with all out-doors around him he looked  nothing less than a mountain king. His large well-knit frame, full of  strength and energy, was at its triumphant best in outing tweeds and  Scotch stockings; his fair handsome face was boyish, despite its  almost fierce determination, as he pranced about, intoxicated with the  mountain air.    
"If you ever had spent one summer in Washington, you would  understand," he said to Betty. "This is where I'd like to spend the  rest of my life. I'd like to think I'd never see a city or the inside  of a house again."    
"Then you'd probably hew down the forest, which would be a loss to the  State: you would have to do something with your superfluous energy.  And what would you do with your brain? Mere reading, when your arm  ached from chopping, never would content you."    
"No, that is the worst of civilization. It either produces  discontented savages like myself or goes too far and turns the whole  body into brain. I have managed to get a sort of steam-engine into my  head which gives me little rest and would wear out my body if I didn't  happen to have the constitution of a buffalo. But I doubt if I shall  be what North is, sixteen years hence. That man is the best example of  equilibrium I have ever seen. His mental activity is enormous, but  his control over himself is so absolute that he never wastes an ounce  of force. I've seen him look as fresh at the end of a long day of  debate as he was when he got on his feet. He never lets go of himself  for a moment."    
That was the only time Betty heard Senator North's name mentioned  during Burleigh's visit, for the younger man was much more interested  in himself and the object of his holiday.    
"I think if it hadn't been for this Extra Session I should have  followed you to California," he said abruptly. "I didn't know how much  I depended for my entire happiness upon my frequent visits to your  house until I came back after the short vacation and found you gone."    
"It would have been jolly to have had you in California. But you must  feel that your time has not been thrown away. Are you satisfied with  the Tariff Bill?"    
"I liked it fairly well as we re-wrote it, but I don't expect to care  much about it after it comes out of conference. But there are no  politics in the Adirondacks, and when a weary Senator is looking at a  woman in a pale green muslin--"    
"You look anything but weary. I expect you will tramp over half the  Adirondacks before you go back. And I am sure you will eat one of  those beefsteaks. Come, they are ready."    
But although she managed to seat him between Sally Carter and an  extremely pretty girl, he was at her side again the moment the gay  party began to split into couples.    
"Will you come for a walk?" he asked. "I do want to roam about on the  old trails the Indians made, and to get away from these hideous  emblems of modern civilization--sailor hats. Thank heaven you don't  wear a sailor hat."    
Betty shot a peremptory glance at Sally Carter, who nodded and started  to follow with a small dark attache who had pursued herself and her  million for five determined years. He was titled if not noble, a  clever operator of a small brain, and a high-priest of teas. He knew  the personnel of Washington Society so thoroughly that he never had  been known to waste a solitary moment on a portion-less girl, and he  had successfully cultivated every art that could commend him to the  imperious favourites of fortune. Betty Madison had disposed of him in  short order, but Miss Carter, although she refused him periodically,  allowed him to hang on, for he amused her and read her favourite  authors. They had not walked far when he seized the picturesque  opportunity to press his suit, and Miss Carter, while scolding him  soundly, forgot the rapid walkers in front.    
Betty, as she tramped along beside the large swinging presence the  forest seemed to embrace as its own, wondered why she did not love  him, wondered if she should, had she never met the other man.  Doubtless, for he possessed all the attributes of the conquering hero,  and she would have excavated the ideals of her romantic girlhood,  brushed and re-cut their garments, and then deliberately set fire to  her imagination. If the responsive spark had held sullenly aloof,  awaiting its time, she, knowing nothing of its existence, would soon  have ceased to remember the half-conscious labours of the initial  stage of her affections, and doubtless would have married this fine  specimen of American manhood, and been happy enough. But the  responsive spark had struck, and illumined the deepest recesses of her  heart in time to burn contempt into any effort of her brain, now or  hereafter. The question did assail her--as Burleigh talked of his  summer outings among the stupendous mountains of his chosen State--  could she turn to him in time were she suddenly and permanently  separated from the other? She shook her head in resentment at the  treasonable thought; but her brain had received every advantage of the  higher civilization for twenty-seven years, and worked by itself. She  was young and she had much to give; in consequence, much to receive.  She could find the highest with one man only, for with him alone  would her imagination do its final work. But Nature is inexorable. She  commands union; and as the years went by and one memory grew dimmer--  who knew? But the thought gave her a moment of sadness so profound  that she ceased to hear the voice of the man beside her. She had had  moments of deep insight before, and again she stared down into the  depths where so many women's agonized memories lie buried. She  suddenly felt a warm clasp round her hand, and for a second responded  to it gratefully, for hers had turned cold. Then she realized that she  was in the present, and withdrew her hand hurriedly.    
"Forgive me," he said. "I simply couldn't help it. I could in  Washington, and I felt that I must wait. But up here--I want to marry  you. You know that, do you not?"    
Betty glanced over her shoulder. There was to be no interruption. She  was mistress of herself at once.    
"I cannot marry you," she said. "I almost wish I could, but I cannot."    
He swung into the middle of the path and stood still, looking down  upon her squarely. There was nothing of the suppliant in his attitude.  He looked unconquerable.    
"I did not expect to win you in a moment," he said. "I should not have  expected it if I had waited another year. I knew from the beginning  that it would be hard work, for if a woman does not love at once it  takes a long time to teach her what love is. I have tried to make you  like me, and I think I have succeeded. That is all I can hope for now.  You have been surfeited and satiated with admiration, and you regard  all men as having been born to burn incense before you. I love you for  that too. I should hate a woman who even had it in her to love a man  out of gratitude. You have your world at your feet, and I want mine  at my feet. You have won yours without effort, for you were born with  the crown and sceptre of fascination, I have to fight for mine. But  the same instinct is in us both, the same possibilities on different  lines. I am not making you the broken passionate appeal of the usual  lover, because so long as I know you do not love me I could not place  myself at the mercy of emotion--I have no thought of making a fool of  myself. But when I do win you--then--ah! that will be another matter."    
She shook her head, but smiling, for she never had liked and admired  him more. She knew of what passion he was capable, and how absurd he  would have looked if lashed by it while her cool eyes looked on. His  self-control made him magnificent.    
"I never shall marry," she said, and then laughed, in spite of  herself, at the world-old formula. Burleigh laughed also.    
"There isn't time enough left before chaos comes again to argue with a  woman a question which means absolutely nothing. I am going to marry  you. I have accomplished everything big I have ever strived for. I  never have wanted to marry any other woman, and I want to marry you  more than I wanted to become a Senator of the United States. Nothing  could discourage me unless I thought you loved another man, but so far  as I can see there is no other suitor in the field. You appear to have  refused every proposing man in Washington. Is there any one on the  other side?" he asked anxiously.    
"No one. I have no suitor beside yourself; but--"    
"I don't understand that word, any more than I understand the word  'fail,'" he said in his rapid truculent tones. Then he added more  gently: "I am afraid you think I should be a tyrant, but no one would  tyrannize over you, for you are any man's equal, and he never would  forget it. I could not love a fool. I want a mate. And I should love  you so much that I never should cease atoning for my fractious and  other unpleasant qualities--"    
"You have none! I cannot do less than tell you I think you are one of  the finest men this country has produced, and that I am as proud of  you as she will be--"    
"Let me interrupt you before you say 'but.' That I have won so high an  opinion from you gives me the deepest possible gratification. But I  want much more than that. Let us go on with our walk. I'll say no more  at present."
