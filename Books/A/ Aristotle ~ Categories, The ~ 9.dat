Action and affection both admit of contraries and also of  variation of degree. Heating is the contrary of cooling, being  heated of being cooled, being glad of being vexed. Thus they  admit of contraries. They also admit of variation of degree: for  it is possible to heat in a greater or less degree; also to be  heated in a greater or less degree. Thus action and affection  also admit of variation of degree. So much, then, is stated with  regard to these categories.    
We spoke, moreover, of the category of position when we were  dealing with that of relation, and stated that such terms derived  their names from those of the corresponding attitudes.    
As for the rest, time, place, state, since they are easily  intelligible, I say no more about them than was said at the  beginning, that in the category of state are included such states  as 'shod', 'armed', in that of place 'in the Lyceum' and so on,  as was explained before.
