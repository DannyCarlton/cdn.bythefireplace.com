Alexina was driving her little car up the avenue at Rincona on the  following morning when she saw Joan running toward her through the park and  signaling to her to stop.    
"What is it?" she asked in some alarm as Joan arrived panting. "Any one  ill?"    
"Not so's you'd notice it. Leave your car here and come with me. Sneak  after me quietly and don't say a word."    
Much mystified, Alexina ran her car off the road and followed her niece  by a devious route toward the house. Joan interested her mildly; she had  fulfilled some of her predictions but not all. She did not go with the  "fast set" even of the immediate neighborhood; that is to say the small  group called upon, as they indubitably "belonged," but wholly disapproved  of, who entertained in some form or other every day and every night, played  poker for staggering stakes, danced the wildest of the new dances, made up  brazenly, and found tea and coffee indifferent stimulants. Two of Joan's  former schoolmates belonged to this active set, but she was only permitted  to meet them at formal dinners and large parties. She had rebelled at  first, but her mother's firm hand was too much for her still undeveloped  will, and later she had concluded "there was nothing in it anyhow; just the  whole tiresome society game raised to the nth degree." Moreover, she  was socially as conventional as her mother and her good gray aunts, and  although full of the mischief of youth, and longing to "do something," no  prince having captured her fancy, enough of what Alexina called the sound  Ballinger instincts remained to make her disapprove of "fast lots," and she  had progressed from radical eighteen to critical twenty-one. She worked  off her superfluous spirits at the outdoor games which may be indulged in  California for eight months of the year, rode horseback every day, used  all her brothers' slang she could remember when in the society of such  uncritical friends as her young Aunt Alexina, and bided her time. Sooner  or later she was determined to "get out and hustle,"--"shake a leg." That  would be the only complete change from her present life, not matrimony and  running with fast sets. She wanted more money, she wanted to live alone,  and, while devoted to her family, she wanted interests they could not  furnish, "no, not in a thousand years."

Joan's slim boyish athletic figure darted on ahead and then approached the  rear of the house on tiptoe. Alexina followed in the same stealthy fashion,  feeling no older at the moment than her niece. The verandah did not extend  as far as the music room, which had been built a generation later, and the  windows were some eight feet from the ground. A ladder, however, abridged  the distance, and Alexina, obeying a gesture from Joan, climbed as hastily  as her narrow skirt would permit and peered through the outside shutters,  which had been carefully closed.    
The room was not dark, however. The electricity had been turned on and  shone down upon an amazing sight.    
Clad in black bloomers and stockings lay a row of six women flat on the  floor, while in front of them stood a woman thin to emaciation, who was  evidently talking rapidly. Alexina's mouth opened as widely as her eyes.  She had heard of Devil Worship, of strange and awful rites that took place  at midnight in wickedest Paris. Had an expurgated edition been brought to  chaste Alta--plus Menlo--plus Atherton, by Mrs. Hunter or Mrs. Thornton, or  any of those fortunate Californians who visited the headquarters of fashion  and sin once a year? They would do a good deal to vary the monotony of  life. But that they should have corrupted Maria...the impeccable, the  superior, the unreorientable Maria! Maria, with whom contentment  and conservatism were the first articles of the domestic and the  socio-religious creed!    
For there lay Maria, extended full length; and on her calm white face was  a look of unholy joy. Beside her, as flat as if glued to the inlaid floor,  were Mrs. Hunter, Mrs. Thornton, Coralie Geary, Mrs. Brannan, another old  friend of Maria, and--yes--Tom's sister, Susan Delling, austere in her  virtues, kind to all, conscientiously smart, and with a fine mahogany  complexion that made even a merely powdered woman feel not so much a harlot  as a social inferior.    
What on earth...what on earth....    
The thin loquacious stranger clapped her hands. Up went six pairs of legs.  Two remained in mid-air, Mrs. Geary's and Mrs. Brannan's having met an  immovable obstacle shortly above the hip-joints. Three bent backward slowly  but surely until they approached the region of the neck. Maria's flew  unerringly, effortlessly, up, back, until they tapped the floor behind her  head. Alexina almost shouted "Bravo." Maria was a real sport.    
Six times they repeated this fascinating rite, and then, obeying another  peremptory command, they rolled over abruptly and balanced on all fours.  Alexina could stand no more. She dropped down the ladder and ran after  Joan, who was disappearing round the corner of the house.

"Well, I never!" she exclaimed. "Maria! Your mo--"    
"She gained three pounds, for the first time in her life, and you know her  figure is her only vanity. This woman came along and the whole Peninsula is  crazy about her. She's taken the fat off every woman in New York, and came  out with letters to a lot of women. Mother fell for her hard. I nearly  passed away when I peeked through that shutter the first time. Mother!  She's the best of the bunch, though. But they're all having a perfectly  grand time. New interest for middle-age--what?"    
"Don't be cruel. Heavens, how hot they all looked! I could hear them gasp.  Hope their arteries are all right. Are they going to stay to lunch?"    
"No. There's a big one on in Burlingame. Mother's not going, though. It's  at that Mrs. Cutts', new Burlingame stormer, that Anne Montgomery coaches  and caters for and who gives wonderful entertainments. Mother and Aunt  Susan won't go, but nearly all the others do."    
"Anne Montgomery. I haven't seen her since mother died."    
"You look as if an idea had struck you. She's useful no end, they say; is  now a social secretary to a lot of new people, and sells the 'real lace'  and other superfluous luxuries of some of our old families for the cold  coin that buys comforts."    
"Fine idea. But I'm glad your mother will be alone. I've come down to have  a talk with her."    
"Thanks. I'll take the hint."
