  They did not lunch on the trail, but drove into the post in time  for  dinner. Jean de Gravois and Croisset came forth from the store to  meet  them. 
  &quot;You have company, my dear!&quot; cried Jean to M&eacute;lisse. &quot;Two gentlemen   fresh from London on the last boat, and one of them younger and   handsomer than your own Jan Thoreau. They are waiting for you in the   cabin, where mon pere is getting them dinner, and telling them how   beautifully you would have made the coffee if you were there.&quot; 
  &quot;Two!&quot; said Jan, as M&eacute;lisse left them. &quot;Who are they?&quot; 
  &quot;The new agent, M. Timothy Dixon, as red as the plague, and fatter   than a spawning fish! And his son, who has come along for fun, he   says; and I believe he will get what he's after if he remains here   very long, Jan Thoreau, for he looked a little too boldly at my Iowaka   when she came into the store just now!&quot; 
  &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; laughed Jan, as Gravois took in the four quarters of  the  earth with a terrible gesture. &quot;Can you blame him, Jean? I tell  you  that I look at Iowaka whenever I get the chance!&quot; 
  &quot;Is she not worth it?&quot; cried Jean in rapture. &quot;You are welcome to   every look that you can get, Jan Thoreau. But the foreigner&#8212;I will   skin him alive and spit him with devil-thorn if he so much as peeps at   her out of the wrong way of his eye!&quot; 
  Croisset spoke. 
  &quot;There was once a foreigner who came. You remember?&quot; 
  &quot;I remember,&quot; said Jan. 
  He looked to the white cross which marked Mukee's grave in the edge  of  the forest, where the shadow of the big spruce fell across it at  the  end of summer evenings. 
  &quot;And&#8212;he&#8212;died,&quot; said Jean de Gravois, his dark hands clenched.  &quot;God  forgive me, but I hate these red-necked men from across the sea.&quot; 
  Croisset shrugged his shoulders. 
  &quot;Breeders of two-legged carrion-eaters!&quot; he exclaimed fiercely. &quot;La   charogne! There are two at Nelson House, and two on the Wholdaia, and   one&#8212;&quot; 
  A sharp cry fell from Jan's lips. When Croisset whirled toward him,  he  stood among his dogs, as white as death, his black eyes blazing as  if  just beyond him he saw something which filled him with terror. 
  As the man turned, startled by the look, Jean sprang to his side. 
  &quot;Saints preserve us, but that was an ugly twist of the hand!&quot; he  cried  shrilly. &quot;Next time, turn your sledge by the rib instead of the  nose,  when your dogs are still in the traces!&quot; Under his breath he   whispered, as he made pretense of looking at Jan's hand: &quot;Le diable,   do you want to tell HIM?&quot; Jan tried to laugh as Croisset came to see   what had happened. 
  &quot;Will you care for the dogs, Henri?&quot; asked Jean. &quot;It's only a  trifling  sprain of the wrist, which Iowaka can cure with one dose of  her  liniment.&quot; 
  As they walked away, Jan's face still as pallid as the gray snow  under  their feet, Gravois added: &quot;You're a fool, Jan Thoreau. There's  a  crowd at your cabin, and you'll have dinner with me.&quot; 
  &quot;La charogne!&quot; muttered Jan. &quot;Les b&ecirc;tes de charogne!&quot; 
  Jean gripped him by the arm. 
  &quot;I tell you that it means nothing&#8212;nothing!&quot; he said, repeating his   words of the previous day in the cabin. &quot;You are a man. You must fight   it down, and forget. No one knows but you and me.&quot; 
  &quot;You will never tell what you read in the papers?&quot; cried Jan  quickly.  &quot;You swear it?&quot; 
  &quot;By the blessed Virgin, I swear it!&quot; 
  &quot;Then,&quot; said Jan softly, &quot;M&eacute;lisse will never know!&quot; 
  &quot;Never,&quot; said Jean. His dark face flashed joyously as Iowaka's  sweet  voice came to them, singing a Cree lullaby in the little home.  &quot;Some  day M&eacute;lisse will be singing that same way over there; and it  will be  for you, Jan Thoreau, as my Iowaka is now singing for me!&quot; 
  An hour later Jan went slowly across the open to Cummins' cabin. As  he  paused for an instant at the door he heard a laugh that was strange  to  him, and when he opened it to enter he stood perplexed and  undecided.  M&eacute;lisse had risen from the table at the sound of his  approach, and his  eyes quickly passed from her flushed face to the  young man who was  sitting opposite her. He caught a nervous tremble in  her voice when  she said: 
  &quot;Mr. Dixon, this is my brother, Jan.&quot; 
  The stranger jumped to his feet and held out a hand. 
  &quot;I'm glad to know you, Cummins.&quot; 
  &quot;Thoreau,&quot; corrected Jan quietly, as he took the extended hand.  &quot;Jan  Thoreau.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought&#8212;&quot; He turned inquiringly to  M&eacute;lisse.  The flush deepened in her cheeks as she began to gather up  the dishes. 
  &quot;We are of no relation,&quot; continued Jan, something impelling him to   speak the words with cool precision. &quot;Only we have lived under the   same roof since she was a baby, and so we have come to be like brother   and sister.&quot; 
  &quot;Miss M&eacute;lisse has been telling me about your wonderful run this   morning,&quot; exclaimed the young Englishman, his face reddening slightly   as he detected the girl's embarrassment. &quot;I wish I had seen it!&quot; 
  &quot;There will be plenty of it very soon,&quot; replied Jan, caught by the   frankness of the other's manner. &quot;Our runners will be going out among   the trappers within a fortnight.&quot; 
  &quot;And will they take me?&quot; 
  &quot;You may go with me, if you can run. I leave the day after  to-morrow.&quot; 
  &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Dixon, moving toward the door. 
  M&eacute;lisse did not lift her head as he went out. Faintly she said: 
  &quot;I've kept your dinner for you, Jan. Why didn't you come sooner?&quot; 
  &quot;I had dinner with Gravois,&quot; he replied. &quot;Jean said that you would   hardly be prepared for five, M&eacute;lisse, so I accepted his invitation.&quot; 
  He took down from the wall a fur sledge-coat, in which M&eacute;lisse had   mended a rent a day or two before, and, throwing it over his arm,   turned to leave. 
  &quot;Jan!&quot; 
  He faced her slowly, knowing that in spite of himself there was a   strangeness in his manner which she would not understand. 
  &quot;Why are you going away the day after to-morrow&#8212;two weeks before  the  others? You didn't tell me.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm going a hundred miles into the South,&quot; he answered. 
  &quot;Over the Nelson House trail?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh!&quot; Her lips curled slightly as she looked at him. Then she  laughed,  and a bright spot leaped into either cheek. &quot;I understand,  brother,&quot;  she said softly. &quot;Pardon me for questioning you so. I had  forgotten  that the MacVeigh girl lives on the Nelson trail. Iowaka  says that she  is as sweet as a wild flower. I wish you would have her  come up and  visit us some time, Jan.&quot; 
  Jan's face went red, then white, but M&eacute;lisse saw only the first  effect  of her random shot, and was briskly gathering up the dishes. 
  &quot;I turn off into the Cree Lake country before I reach MacVeighs'.&quot;  he  was on the point of saying; but the words hung upon his lips, and  he  remained silent. 
  A few minutes later he was talking with Jean de Gravois. The little   Frenchman's face was ominously dark, and he puffed furiously upon his   pipe when Jan told him why he was leaving at once for the South. 
  &quot;Running away!&quot; he repeated for the tenth time in French, his thin   lips curling in a sneer. &quot;I am sorry that I gave you my oath, Jan   Thoreau, else I would go myself and tell M&eacute;lisse what I read in the   papers. Pish! Why can't you forget?&quot; 
  &quot;I may&#8212;some day,&quot; said Jan. &quot;That is why I am going into the South   two weeks early, and I shall be gone until after the big roast. If I   remain here another week, I shall tell M&eacute;lisse, and then&#8212;&quot; 
  He shrugged his shoulders despairingly. 
  &quot;And then&#8212;what?&quot; 
  &quot;I should go away for ever.&quot; 
  Jean snapped his fingers with a low laugh. 
  &quot;Then remain another week, Jan Thoreau, and if it turns out as you   say, I swear I will abandon my two Iowakas and little Jean to the   wolves!&quot; 
  &quot;I am going the day after to-morrow.&quot; 
  The next morning Iowaka complained to M&eacute;lisse that Gravois was as   surly as a bear. 
  &quot;A wonderful change has come over him,&quot; she said. &quot;He does nothing  but  shrug his shoulders and say 'Le diable!' and 'The fool!' Last  night I  could hardly sleep because of his growling. I wonder what bad  spirit  has come into my Jean?&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse was wondering the same of Jan. She saw little of him during   the day. At noon, Dixon told her that he had made up his mind not to   accompany Thoreau on the trip south. 
  The following morning, before she was up, Jan had gone. She was  deeply  hurt. Never before had he left on one of his long trips without   spending his last moments with her. She had purposely told her father   to entertain the agent and his son at the store that evening, so that   Jan might have an opportunity of bidding her good-by alone. 
  Outside of her thoughts of Jan, the days and evenings that followed   were pleasant ones for her. The new agent was as jolly as he was fat,   and took an immense liking to M&eacute;lisse. Young Dixon was good-looking   and brimming with life, and spent a great deal of his time in her   company. For hours at a time she listened to his stories of the   wonderful world across the sea. As MacDonald had described that life   to Jan at Fort Churchill, so he told of it to M&eacute;lisse, filling her   with visions of great cities, painting picture after picture, until   her imagination was riot with the beauty and the marvel of it all, and   she listened, with flaming cheeks and glowing eyes. 
  One day, a week after Jan had gone, he told her about the women in  the  world which had come to be a fairy-land to M&eacute;lisse. 
  &quot;They are all beautiful over there?&quot; she asked wonderingly, when he   had finished. 
  &quot;Many of them are beautiful, but none so beautiful as you,  M&eacute;lisse,&quot;  he replied, leaning near to her, his eyes shining. &quot;Do you  know that  you are beautiful?&quot; 
  His words frightened her so much that she bowed her head to hide  the  signs of it in her face. Jan had often spoken those same words&#8212;a   thousand times he had told her that she was beautiful&#8212;but there bad   never been this fluttering of her heart before. 
  There were few things which Iowaka and she did not hold in secret   between them, and a day or two later M&eacute;lisse told her friend what   Dixon had said. For the first time Iowaka abused the confidence placed   in her, and told Jean. 
  &quot;Le diable!&quot; gritted Jean, his face blackening. 
  He said no more until night, when the children were asleep. Then he   drew Iowaka close beside him on a bench near the stove, and asked   carelessly: 
  &quot;Mon ange, if one makes an oath to the blessed Virgin, and breaks  it,  what happens?&quot; 
  He evaded the startled look in his wife's big black eyes. 
  &quot;It means that one will be for ever damned unless he confesses to a   priest soon after, doesn't it ma ch&eacute;rie? And if there is no priest   nearer than four hundred miles, it is a dangerous thing to do, is it   not? But&#8212;&quot; He did not wait for an answer. &quot;If one might have the oath   broken, and not do it himself, what then?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know,&quot; said Iowaka simply, staring at him in amazed   questioning. 
  &quot;Nor do I,&quot; said Jean, lighting his pipe. &quot;But there is enough of  the  devil in Jean de Gravois to make him break a thousand oaths if it  was  for you, my Iowaka!&quot; 
  Her eyes glowed upon him softly. 
  &quot;A maiden's soul leaves her body when she becomes the wife of the  man  she loves,&quot; she whispered tenderly in Cree, resting her dark head  on  Jean's shoulder. &quot;That is what my people believe, Jean; and if I  have  given my soul to you, why should I not break oath for you?&quot; 
  &quot;For me alone, Iowaka?&quot; 
  &quot;For you alone.&quot; 
  &quot;And not for a friend?&quot; 
  &quot;For no one else in the world, Jean. You are the only one to whom  the  god of my people bids me make all sacrifice.&quot; 
  &quot;But you do not believe in that god, Iowaka!&quot; 
  &quot;Sometimes it is better to believe in the god of my people than in   yours,&quot; she replied gently. &quot;I believed in him fifteen years ago at   Churchill. Do you wish me to take back what I gave to you then?&quot; 
  With a low cry of happiness Jean crushed his face against her soft   cheek. 
  &quot;Believe in him always, my Iowaka, and Jean de Gravois will cut the   throat of any missioner who says you will not go to Paradise! But&#8212;   this other. You are sure that you would break oath for none but me?&quot; 
  &quot;And the children. They are a part of you, Jean.&quot; 
  A fierce snarling and barking of dogs brought Gravois to the door.   They could hear Croisset's raucous voice and the loud cracking of his   big whip. 
  &quot;I'll be back soon,&quot; said Jean, closing the door after him; but   instead of approaching Croisset and the fighting dogs he went in the   direction of Cummins' cabin. &quot;Devil take an oath!&quot; he growled under   his breath. &quot;Neither one God nor the other will let me break it, and   Iowaka least of all!&quot; He gritted his teeth as young Dixon's laugh   sounded loudly in the cabin. &quot;Two fools!&quot; he went on communing with   himself. &quot;Cummins&#8212;Jan Thoreau&#8212;both fools!&quot;
