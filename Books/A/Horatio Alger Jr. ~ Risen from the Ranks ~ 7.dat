  &#8220;I am afraid your friend won't thank you for introducing me to him,&#8221;  said Harry, after Fitz had left the room.
  &#8220;Fitz is a snob,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;He makes himself ridiculous by  putting on airs, and assuming to be more than he is. His father is in a  good business, and may be rich&#8212;I don't know about that&#8212;but that isn't  much to boast of.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think we shall be very intimate,&#8221; said Harry, smiling.  &#8220;Evidently a printer's apprentice is something very low in his eyes.&#8221;
  &#8220;When you are an influential editor he will be willing to recognize  you. Let that stimulate your ambition.&#8221;
  &#8220;It isn't easy for a half-educated boy to rise to such a position. I  feel that I know very little.&#8221;
  &#8220;If I can help you any, Harry, I shall be very glad to do it. I'm  not much of a scholar, but I can help you a little. For instance, if  you wanted to learn French, I could hear your lessons, and correct your  exercises.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you?&#8221; said Harry, eagerly. &#8220;There is nothing I should like  better.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I'll tell you what I'll do. You shall buy a French grammar,  and come to my room two evenings a week, and recite what you get time  to study at home.&#8221;
  &#8220;Won't it give you a great deal of trouble, Oscar?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a bit of it; I shall rather like it. Until you can buy a  grammar, I will lend you mine. I'll set you a lesson out of it now.&#8221;
  He took from the book-shelves a French grammar, and inviting Harry  to sit down beside him, gave him some necessary explanations as to the  pronunciation of words according to the first lesson.
  &#8220;It seems easy,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I can take more than that.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is the easiest of the modern languages, to us at least, on  account of its having so many words similar to ours.&#8221;
  &#8220;What evening shall I come, Oscar?&#8221;
  &#8220;Tuesday and Friday will suit me as well as any. And remember,  Harry, I mean to be very strict in discipline. And, by the way, how  will it do to call myself Professor?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll call you Professor if you want me to.&#8221;
  &#8220;We'll leave all high titles to Fitz, and I won't use the rod any  oftener than it is absolutely necessary.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right, Professor Vincent,&#8221; said Harry laughing, &#8220;I'll endeavor  to behave with propriety.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wonder what they would say at home,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;if they knew I  had taken up the profession of teacher. Strange as it may seem to you,  Harry, I have the reputation in the home-circle of being decidedly  lazy. How do you account for it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Great men are seldom appreciated.&#8221;
  &#8220;You hit the nail on the head that time&#8212;glad I am not the nail, by  the way. Henceforth I will submit with resignation to injustice and  misconstruction, since I am only meeting with the common fate of great  men.&#8221;
  &#8220;What time is it, Oscar?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nearly ten.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then I will bid you good-night,&#8221; and Harry rose to go. &#8220;I can't  tell how much I am obliged to you for your kind offer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just postpone thanks till you find out whether I am a good teacher  or not.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am sure of that.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not so sure, but I will do what I can for you. Good-night.  I'll expect you Friday evening. I shall see Fitz to-morrow. Shall I  give him your love?&#8221;
  &#8220;Never mind!&#8221; said Harry, smiling. &#8220;I'm afraid it wouldn't be  appreciated.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps not.&#8221;
  As Harry left his lively companion, he felt that he had been most  fortunate in securing his friendship&#8212;not only that he found him very  agreeable and attractive, but he was likely to be of great use to him  in promoting his plans of self-education. He had too much good sense  not to perceive that the only chance he had of rising to an influential  position lay in qualifying himself for it, by enlarging his limited  knowledge and improving his mind.
  &#8220;I have made a good beginning,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;After I have learned  something of French, I will take up Latin, and I think Oscar will be  willing to help me in that too.&#8221;
  The next morning he commenced work in the printing office. With a  few hints from Ferguson, he soon comprehended what he had to do, and  made very rapid progress.
  &#8220;You're getting on fast, Harry,&#8221; said Ferguson approvingly.
  &#8220;I like it,&#8221; said our hero. &#8220;I am glad I decided to be a printer.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I wasn't one,&#8221; grumbled Clapp, the younger journeyman.
  &#8220;Don't you like it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not much. It's hard work and poor pay. I just wish I was in my  brother's shoes. He is a bookkeeper in Boston, with a salary of twelve  hundred a year, while I am plodding along on fifteen dollars week.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may do better some day,&#8221; said Ferguson.
  &#8220;Don't see any chance of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;If I were in your place, I would save up part of my salary, and by  and by have an office, and perhaps a paper of my own.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why don't you do it, then?&#8221; sneered Clapp.
  &#8220;Because I have a family to support from my earnings&#8212;you have only  yourself.&#8221;
  &#8220;It doesn't help me any; I can't save anything out of fifteen  dollars a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean you won't,&#8221; said Ferguson quietly.
  &#8220;No I don't. I mean I can't.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you expect I get along, then? I have a wife and two children  to support, and only get two dollars a week more than you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you get into debt.&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I owe no man a dollar,&#8221; said Ferguson emphatically. &#8220;That isn't  all. I save two dollars a week; so that I actually support four on  fifteen dollars a week&#8212;your salary. What do you say to that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want to be mean,&#8221; said Clapp.
  &#8220;Nor I. I mean to live comfortably, but of course I have to be  economical.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, hang economy!&#8221; said Clapp impatiently. &#8220;The old man used to  lecture me about economy till I got sick of hearing the word.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a good thing, for all that,&#8221; persisted Ferguson. &#8220;You'll  think so some day, even if you don't now.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess you mean to run opposition to young Franklin, over there,&#8221;  sneered Clapp, indicating Harry, who had listened to the discussion  with not a little interest.
  &#8220;I think he and I will agree together pretty well,&#8221; said Ferguson,  smiling. &#8220;Franklin's a good man to imitate.&#8221;
  &#8220;If there are going to be two Franklins in the office, it will be  time for me to clear out,&#8221; returned Clapp.
  &#8220;You can do better.&#8221;
  &#8220;How is that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Become Franklin No. 3.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't catch me imitating any old fogy like that. As far as I  know anything about him, he was a mean, stingy old curmudgeon!&#8221;  exclaimed Clapp with irritation.
  &#8220;That's rather strong language, Clapp,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson, looking  up from his desk with a smile. &#8220;It doesn't correspond with the general  estimate of Franklin's character.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't care,&#8221; said Clapp doggedly, &#8220;I wouldn't be like Franklin if  I could. I have too much self-respect.&#8221;
  Ferguson laughed, and Harry wanted to, but feared he should offend  the younger journeyman, who evidently had worked himself into a bad  humor.
  &#8220;I don't think you're in any danger,&#8221; said Ferguson, who did not  mind his fellow-workman's little ebullitions of temper.
  Clapp scowled, but did not deign to reply, partly, perhaps, because  he knew that there was nothing to say.
  From the outset Ferguson took a fancy to the young apprentice.
  &#8220;He's got good, solid ideas,&#8221; said he to Mr. Anderson, when Harry  was absent. &#8220;He isn't so thoughtless as most boys of his age. He looks  ahead.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think you are right in your judgment of him,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson.  &#8220;He promises to be a faithful workman.&#8221;
  &#8220;He promises more than that,&#8221; said Ferguson. &#8220;Mark my words, Mr.  Anderson; that boy is going to make his mark some day.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a little too soon to say that, isn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I judge from what I see. He is industrious and ambitious, and  is bound to succeed. The world will hear of him yet.&#8221;
  Mr. Anderson smiled. He liked what he had seen of his new  apprentice, but he thought Ferguson altogether too sanguine.
  &#8220;He's a good, faithful boy,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but it takes more than  that to rise to distinction. If all the smart boys turned out smart  men, they'd be a drug in the market.&#8221;
  But Ferguson held to his own opinion, notwithstanding. Time will  show which was right.
  The next day Ferguson said, &#8220;Harry, come round to my house, and take  tea to-night. I've spoken to my wife about you, and she wants to see  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Ferguson,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I shall be very glad to  come.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll wait till you are ready, and you can walk along with me.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right; I will be ready in five minutes.&#8221;
  They set out together for Ferguson's modest home, which was about  half a mile distant. As they passed up the village street Harry's  attention was drawn to two boys who were approaching them. One he  recognized at once as Fitzgerald Fletcher. He had an even more stunning  necktie than when Harry first met him, and sported a jaunty little  cane, which he swung in his neatly gloved hand.
  &#8220;I wonder if he'll notice me,&#8221; thought Harry. &#8220;At any rate, I won't  be wanting in politeness.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good-afternoon, Mr. Fletcher,&#8221; he said, as they met.
  Fitzgerald stared at him superciliously, and made the slightest  possible nod.
  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; asked Ferguson.
  &#8220;It is a boy who has great contempt for printers' devils and low  apprentices,&#8221; answered Harry. &#8220;I was introduced to him two evenings  ago, but he evidently doesn't care about keeping up the acquaintance.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is that, Fitz?&#8221; asked his companion in turn.
  &#8220;It's a low fellow&#8212;a printer's devil,&#8221; answered Fitz, shortly.
  &#8220;How do you happen to know him?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oscar Vincent introduced him to me. Oscar's a queer fellow. He  belongs to one of the first families in Boston&#8212;one of my set, you  know, and yet he actually invited that boy to his room.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's rather a good-looking boy&#8212;the printer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Think so?&#8221; drawled Fitz. &#8220;He's low&#8212;all apprentices are. I mean to  keep him at a distance.&#8221;
