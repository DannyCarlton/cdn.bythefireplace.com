Whether Ronald Le Breton's abstruse speculations on the theory of  heredity were well founded or not, it certainly did happen, at any  rate, that the more he saw of Selah Briggs the better he liked her;  and the more Selah saw of him the better she liked him in return.  Curiously enough, too, Selah did actually recognise in him what  he fancied he recognised in himself, that part of his brother's  nature (not all wholly assumed) which was just what Selah had  first been drawn to admire in Herbert himself. It wasn't merely  the originality of his general point of view: it was something more  deep-seated and undefinable than that--in a word, his idiosyncrasy.  Selah Briggs, with her peculiar fiery soul and rebellious nature,  found in both the Le Bretons something that seemed at once to satisfy  her wants, to fulfil her desires, to saturate her affinities: and  with Ronald, as with Herbert before, she was conscious of a certain  awe and respect which was all the more pleasant to her because  her untamed spirit had never felt anything like it with any other  human being. She didn't understand them, and she didn't want to  understand them: that constituted just the very charm of their  whole personality to her peculiar fancy. All the other people she  had ever met were as transparent as glass, for good or for evil;  she could see through all their faults and virtues as easily as  one sees through a window: the Le Bretons were to her inscrutable,  novel, incomprehensible, inexplicable, and she prized them for  their very inscrutability. And so it came to pass, that almost by  a process of natural and imperceptible transference, she passed on  at last to Ronald's account very much the same intensity of feeling  that she had formerly felt towards his brother Herbert.    
But at the same time, Selah never for a moment let him see it. She  was too proud to confess now that she could ever love another man:  the Mr. Walters she had once believed in had never, never, never  existed: and she would raise no other idol in future to take the  place of that vanished ideal. She was grateful to Ronald, and even  fond of him: but that was all-outwardly at least. She never let him  see, by word or act, that in her heart of hearts she was beginning  to love him. And yet Ronald instinctively knew it. He himself  could not have told you why; but he knew it. Even a woman cannot  hide a secret from a man with that peculiarly penetrating intuitive  temperament which belongs to sensitive, delicate types like Ronald  Le Breton's.    
One Sunday evening, when Selah had been spending a few hours at  Edie's lodgings (Ronald always made it an excuse for finding them  a supper, on the ground that Selah was really his guest, though he  could not conveniently ask her to his own rooms), he walked home  towards Notting Hill with Selah; and as they crossed the Regent's  Park, he took the opportunity to say something to her that he had  had upon his mind for a few weeks past, in some vague, indefinite,  half-unconscious fashion.    
'Selah,' he began, a little timidly, 'don't you think it's very  probable we shan't have Ernest here much longer with us?'    
'I'm afraid it is, Ronald,' Selah answered. She had got quite  accustomed now to calling him Ronald. With such a poor, weak, sickly  fellow as that, why really, after all, it did not much matter.    
'Well, Selah,' Ronald went on, gravely, his eyes filling with  tears as he spoke, 'in that case, you know, I can't think what's  to become of poor Edie. It's a dreadful contingency to talk about,  Selah, and I can't bear talking about it; but we <i>must</i> face these  things, however terrible, mustn't we? and in this case one's  absolutely bound to face it for poor Edie's sake as well as for  Ernest's. Selah, she must have a home to go to, when dear Ernest's  taken from us.'    
'I'm very sorry for her, Ronald,' Selah answered, with unusual  softness of manner, 'but I really don't see how a home can possibly  be provided for her.'    
'I do,' Ronald answered, more calmly; 'and for their sakes, Selah,  I want you to help me in trying to provide it.'    
'How?' Selah asked, looking up in his face curiously, as they passed  into a ray of lamplight.    
'Listen, Selah, and I'll tell you. Why, by marrying me.'    
'Never?' Selah answered, firmly, and with a decided tinge of the old  Adam in her trembling voice. 'Never, Ronald! Never, never, never!'    
'Wait a minute, Selah,' Ronald pleaded, 'till you've heard the  end of what I have to say to you. Consider that when dear Ernest's  gone (oh! Selah, you must excuse me; it makes me cry so to think  of it), there'll be nowhere on earth for poor little Edie and Dot  to go to.'    
'Did ever a man propose to a girl so extraordinarily in all this  world,' Selah thought to herself, angrily. 'He actually expects me  to marry him in order to provide a home for his precious sister-in-law.  That's really carrying unselfishness a step too far, I call it.'    
'Edie couldn't come and live with me, of course,' Ronald went on,  quickly, 'if I were a bachelor; but if I were married, why then,  naturally, she and Dot could come and live with us; and she could  earn a little money somehow, no doubt; and, at any rate, it'd be  better for her than starvation.'    
Selah stopped a minute, and tapped the hard ground two or three  times angrily with the point of her umbrella. 'And me, Ronald?'  she said in a curious defiant voice. 'And <i>me</i>? I suppose you've  forgotten all about <i>me</i>. You don't ask me to marry you because  you love me; you don't ask me whether I love you or not; you only  propose to me that I should quietly turn domestic housekeeper for  Mrs. Ernest Le Breton. And for my part, I answer you plainly, once  for all, that I'm not going to do it--no, never, never, never!'    
She spoke haughtily, flashing her eyes at him in the fierce old  fashion, and Ronald was almost frightened at the angry intensity  of her contemptuous gestures. 'Selah,' he cried, trying to take  her hand, which she tore away from him hurriedly: 'Selah, you  misunderstand me. I only approached the subject that way because  I didn't want to seem overweening and presumptuous. It's a very  great piece of vanity, it seems to me, for any man to ask a woman  whether she loves him. I'm too conscious of all my own faults and  failings, Selah, to venture upon asking you ever to love me; but  I do love you, Selah, I'm sure I do love you; and I hoped, I somehow  fancied--it may have been mere fancy, but I <i>did</i> imagine--that I  detected, I can't say how, that you did really love me, too, just  a very very little. Oh, Selah, it's because I really love you that  I ask you whether you'll marry me, such as I am; I know I'm a poor  sort of person to marry, but I ventured to hope you might love me  just a little for all that.'    
He looked so frail and gentle as he stood there pleading in the  pale moonlight, that Selah could have taken him to her bosom then  and there and fondled him as one would pet a sick child, for pure  womanliness; but the devil in her blood kept her from doing it, and  she answered haughtily, instead: 'Ronald, if you wanted to marry  me, you ought to have asked me for my own sake. Now that you've  asked me for another's, you can't expect me to give you an answer.  Keep your money, my poor boy; you'll want it all for you and her  hereafter; don't go sharing it and spending it on perfect strangers  such as me. And don't go talking to me again about this business  as long as your sister-in-law is unprovided for. I'm not going to  take the bread out of her mouth, and I'm not going to marry a man  who doesn't utterly and entirely love me.'    
'But I do,' Ronald answered, earnestly; 'I do, Selah; I love you  truly and faithfully from the very bottom of my heart.'    
'Leave off, Roland,' Selah said in the same angry tone. 'If you  ever talk to me of this again, I give you my word of honour about  it, I'll never speak another word to you.'    
And Ronald, who deeply respected the sanctity of a promise, were  it only a threat, bided his time, and said no more about it for  the present.    
Next day, as Ronald sat reading in his own rooms, he was much  surprised at hearing a well-known voice at the door, inquiring  with some asperity whether Mr. Le Breton was at home. He listened  to the voice in intense astonishment. It was his mother's.    
'Ronald,' Lady Le Breton began, the moment she had been shown into  his little sitting-room, 'I didn't think, after your undutiful,  ungrateful conduct--with that abominable woman, too--that I should  ever have come to see you, unless you came first, as you ought  clearly to do, and begged my pardon penitently for your disgraceful  behaviour. It's hard, I know, to acknowledge oneself in the wrong,  but every Christian ought to be above vindictiveness and obstinate  self-will; and I expect you, therefore, sooner or later, to come  and ask forgiveness for your dreadful unkindness to me. Till then,  as I said, I didn't expect to call upon you in any way. But I've  felt compelled to-day to come and speak to you about a matter  of duty, and as a matter of duty strictly I regard it, not as any  relaxation of my just attitude of indignant expectancy towards  yourself; no parent ought rightly to overlook such conduct as  yours on the part of a son.' Ronald inclined his head respectfully.  'Well, what I've come to speak to you about to-day, Ronald, is  about your poor misguided brother Ernest. He, too, as you know,  has behaved very badly to me.'    
'No,' Ronald answered stoutly, without further note or comment.  Where the matter touched himself only he could maintain a decent  silence, but where it touched poor dying Ernest he couldn't possibly  restrain himself, even from a sense of filial obligation.    
'Very badly to me,' Lady Le Breton went on sternly, without in any  way noticing the brief interruption, 'and I can't, of course, go  to see him either, especially not as I should by so doing expose  myself to meeting the person whom he has chosen to make his wife.  Still, as I hear that Ernest a in a very serious or even dangerous  condition----'    
'He's dying,' Ronald answered, the quick tears once more finding  the easy road to his eyes as usual.    
'I considered, as a mother, it was my duty to warn him to take a  little thought about his soul.'    
'His soul!' Ronald exclaimed in astonishment. 'Ernest's soul! Why,  mother, dear Ernest has no need to look after his soul. He doesn't  take that sordid, petty, limited view of our relations with  eternity, and of our relations with the Infinite, which makes them  all consist of the miserable, selfish, squalid desire to save our  own poor personal little souls at all hazards. Ernest has something  better and nobler to think of, I can assure you, than such a mere  self-centred idea as that.'    
'Ronald!' Lady Breton exclaimed, drawing herself up with much  dignity; 'how on earth you, who have always pretended to be a  religious person, can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment  as that, really passes my comprehension. What in the world is  religion for, I should like to know, if it isn't to teach us how  to save our own souls? But the particular thing I want to speak  to you about is just this: couldn't you manage to induce Ernest to  see the Archdeacon a little, and let the Archdeacon speak to him  about his deplorable spiritual condition? I thought about you both  so much at church yesterday, when the dear Archdeacon was preaching  such a beautiful sermon; his text was like this, as far as I can  remember it. "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but  the end thereof are the ways of death." I couldn't help thinking  all the time of my own two poor rebellious boys, and of the path  that their misguided notions were leading them on. For I believe  Ernest does really somehow persuade himself that he's in the  right--it's inconceivable, but it's the fact; and I'm afraid the end  thereof will be the ways of death; and then, as the dear Archdeacon  said, "After death the judgment." Oh, Ronald, when I think of your  poor dear brother Ernest's open unbelief, it makes me tremble for  his future, so that I couldn't rest upon my bed until I'd been to  see you and urged you to go and try to save him.'    
'Mother,' Ronald said with that tone in which he was well accustomed  to answering Lady Le Breton's religious harangues; 'I don't think  you need feel any uneasiness whatever on dear Ernest's account,  so far as all that's concerned. What does <i>he</i> want with saving  his soul, mother? "Whosoever will save his life shall lose it."  Remember what is written: "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord,  Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven."'    
'But, Ronald,' Lady Le Breton continued, half angrily, 'consider  his unbelief, his dreadful opinions, his errors of doctrine! How  on earth can we be happy about him when we think of those?'    
'I don't think, Mother,' Ronald answered gently, 'that Infinite  Justice and Infinite Love take much account of a man's opinions.  They take account of his life and soul only, not of the correctness  of his propositions in dogmatic theology; "Other sheep have I which  are not of this fold--them also must I bring."'    
'It seems to me, Ronald,' Lady Le Breton rejoined coldly, 'that  you don't in the least care for whatever is most distinctive and  characteristic in the whole of Christian doctrine. You talk so  very very differently on religious subjects from that dear, good,  excellent Archdeacon.'
