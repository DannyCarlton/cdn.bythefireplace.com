  Half a mile down the ridge, where it sloped up gradually from the   forests and swamps of the plain, a team of powerful Malemutes were   running at the head of a toboggan. On the sledge was a young half-Cree   woman. Now beside the sledge, now at the lead of the dogs, cracking   his whip and shouting joyously, ran Jean de Gravois. 
  &quot;Is it not beautiful, my Iowaka?&quot; he cried for the hundredth time,  in  Cree, leaping over a three-foot boulder in his boundless  enthusiasm.  &quot;Is this not the glorious world, with the sun just rising  off there,  and spring only a few days away? It is not like the cold  chills at  Churchill, which come up with the icebergs and stay there  all summer!  What do you think of your Jean de Gravois and his country  now?&quot; 
  Jean was bringing back with him a splendid young woman, with big,   lustrous eyes, and hair that shone with the gloss of a raven's wing in   the sun. She laughed at him proudly as he danced and leaped beside   her, replying softly in Cree, which is the most beautiful language in   the world, to everything that he said. 
  Jean leaped and ran, cracked his caribou whip, and shouted and sang   until he was panting and red in the face. Just as Iowaka had called   upon him to stop and get a second wind, the Malemutes dropped back   upon their haunches where Jan Thoreau lay, twisted and bleeding, in   the snow. 
  &quot;What is this?&quot; cried Jean. 
  He caught Jan's limp head and shoulders up in his arms, and called   shrilly to Iowaka, who was disentangling herself from the thick furs   in which he had wrapped her. 
  &quot;It is the fiddler I told you about, who lives with Williams at  Post  Lac Bain!&quot; he shouted excitedly in Cree. &quot;He has been murdered!  He has  been choked to death, and torn to pieces in the face, as if by  an  animal!&quot; Jean's eyes roved about as Iowaka kneeled beside him.  &quot;What a  fight!&quot; he gasped. &quot;See the footprints&#8212;a big man and a small  boy, and  the murderer has gone on a sledge!&quot; 
  &quot;He is warm,&quot; said Iowaka. &quot;It may be that he is not dead.&quot; 
  Jean de Gravois sprang to his feet, his little black eyes flashing   with a dangerous fire. In a single leap he was at the side of the   sledge, throwing off the furs and bundles and all other objects except   his rifle. 
  &quot;He is dead, Iowaka. Look at the purple and black in his face. It  is  Jean de Gravois who will catch the murderer, and you will stay here   and make yourself a camp. Hi-o-o-o-o!&quot; he shouted to the Malemutes. 
  The team twisted sinuously and swiftly in the trail as he sped over   the edge of the mountain. Upon the plain below he knelt upon the   toboggan, with his rifle in front of him; and at his low, hissing   commands, which reached no farther than the dogs' ears, the team   stretched their long bodies in pursuit of the missioner and his   huskies. 
  Jean knew that whoever was ahead of him was not far away, and he   laughed and hunched his shoulders when he saw that his magnificent   Malemutes were making three times the speed of the huskies. It was a   short chase. It led across the narrow plain and into a dense tangle of   swamp, where the huskies had picked their way in aimless wandering   until they came out in thick balsam and Banksian pine. Half a mile   farther on, and the trail broke into an open which led down to the   smooth surface of a lake, and two-thirds across the lake was the   fleeing missioner. 
  The Malemute leader flung open his jaws in a deep baying triumph,  and  with a savage yell Jean cracked his caribou whip over his back. He  saw  the man ahead of him lean over the end of his sledge as he urged  his  dogs, but the huskies went no faster; and then he caught the  glitter  of something that flashed for a moment in the sun. 
  &quot;Ah!&quot; said Jean softly, as a bullet sang over his head. &quot;He fires  at  Jean de Gravois!&quot; He dropped his whip, and there was the warm glow  of  happiness in his little dark face as he leveled his rifle over the   backs of his Malemutes. &quot;He fires at Jean de Gravois, and it is Jean   who can hamstring a caribou at three hundred yards on the run!&quot; 
  For an instant, at the crack of his rifle, there was no movement   ahead; then something rolled from the sledge and lay doubled up in the   snow. A hundred yards beyond it, the huskies stopped in a rabble and   turned to look at the approaching strangers. 
  Beside it Jean stopped; and when he saw the face that stared up at   him, he clutched his thin hands in his long black hair and cried out,   in shrill amazement and horror: 
  &quot;The saints in Heaven, it is the missioner from Churchill!&quot; 
  He turned the man over, and found where his bullet had entered  under  one arm and come out from under the other. There was no spark of  life  left. The missioner was already dead. 
  &quot;The missioner from Churchill!&quot; he gasped again. 
  He looked up at the warm sun, and kicked the melting snow under his   moccasined feet. 
  &quot;It will thaw very soon,&quot; he said to himself, looking again at the   dead man, &quot;and then he will go into the lake.&quot; 
  He headed his Malemutes back to the forest. Then he ran out and cut   the traces of the exhausted huskies, and with his whip scattered them   in freedom over the ice. 
  &quot;Go to the wolves!&quot; he shouted in Cree. &quot;Hide yourselves from the   post, or Jean de Gravois will cut out your tongues and take your skins   off alive!&quot; 
  When he came back to the top of the mountain, Jean found Iowaka  making  hot coffee, while Jan was bundled up in furs near the fire. 
  &quot;It is as I said,&quot; she called. &quot;He is alive!&quot; 
  Thus it happened that the return of Jean de Gravois to the post was   even more dramatic than he had schemed it to be, for he brought back   with him not only a beautiful wife from Churchill, but also the half   dead Jan Thoreau from the scene of battle on the mountain. And in the   mystery of it all he reveled for two days; for Jean de Gravois said   not a word about the dead man on the lake beyond the forest, nor did   the huskies come back into their bondage to give a hint of the missing   missionary.
