  Andy Burke was passing the house of Mrs. Preston, within a month  after Colonel Preston's death, when Godfrey, who had not gone back to  boarding school, showed himself at the front door.
  &#8220;Come here!&#8221; said Godfrey, in an imperious tone.
  Andy turned his head, and paused.
  &#8220;Who are you talking to?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;To you, to be sure.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's wanted?&#8221;
  &#8220;My mother wants to see you.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right; I'll come in.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can go around to the back door,&#8221; said Godfrey, who seemed to  find pleasure in making himself disagreeable.
  &#8220;I know I can, but I don't mean to,&#8221; said Andy, walking up to the  front entrance, where Godfrey was standing.
  &#8220;The back door is good enough for you,&#8221; said the other, offensively.
  &#8220;I shouldn't mind going to it if you hadn't asked me,&#8221; said Andy.  &#8220;Just move away, will you?&#8221;
  Godfrey did not stir.
  &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Andy, turning; &#8220;tell your mother you would not let  me in.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come in, if you want to,&#8221; said Godfrey, at length, moving aside.
  &#8220;I don't care much about it. I only came to oblige your mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe you won't like what she has to say,&#8221; said Godfrey, with a  disagreeable smile.
  &#8220;I'll soon know,&#8221; said Andy.
  He entered the house, and Godfrey called upstairs: &#8220;Mother, the  Burke boy is here.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll be down directly,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;He can sit down.&#8221;
  Andy sat down on a chair in the hall, not receiving an invitation to  enter the sitting-room, and waited for Mrs. Preston to appear. He  wondered a little what she wanted with him, but thought it likely that  she had some errand or service in which she wished to employ him. He  did not know the extent of her dislike for him and his mother.
  After a while Mrs. Preston came downstairs. She was dressed in  black, but showed no other mark of sorrow for the loss of her husband.  Indeed, she was looking in better health than usual.
  &#8220;You can come into the sitting-room,&#8221; she said, coldly.
  Andy followed her, and so did Godfrey, who felt a malicious pleasure  in hearing what he knew beforehand his mother intended to say.
  &#8220;I believe your name is Andrew?&#8221; she commenced.
  &#8220;Yes, ma'am.&#8221;
  &#8220;Your mother occupies a house belonging to my late husband.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, ma'am,&#8221; answered Andy, who now began to guess at the object of  the interview.
  &#8220;I find, by examining my husband's papers, that she has paid no rent  for the last six months.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;She offered to pay it, but Colonel  Preston told her he didn't want no rent from her. He said she could  have it for nothing.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a likely story,&#8221; said Godfrey, with a sneer.
  &#8220;It's a true story,&#8221; said Andy, in a firm voice, steadily eying his  young antagonist.
  &#8220;This may be true, or it may not be true,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston,  coldly. &#8220;If true, I suppose my husband gave your mother a paper of some  kind, agreeing to let her have the house rent-free.&#8221;
  &#8220;She hasn't got any paper,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;I thought not,&#8221; said Godfrey, sneering. &#8220;You forgot to write her  one.&#8221;
  &#8220;Be quiet, Godfrey,&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;I prefer to manage this  matter myself. Then, your mother has no paper to show in proof of what  you assert?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, ma'am. The colonel didn't think it was necessary. He just told  my mother, when she first came with the rent, that she needn't trouble  herself to come again on that errand. He said that she had nursed him  when he was sick with the smallpox, and he'd never forget it, and that  he'd bought the house expressly for her.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am aware that your mother nursed my husband in his sickness,&#8221;  said Mrs. Preston, coldly. &#8220;I also know that my husband paid her very  handsomely for her services.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's true, ma'am,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;He was a fine, generous man, the  colonel was, and I'll always say it.&#8221;
  &#8220;There really seems no reason why, in addition to this compensation,  your mother should receive a present of her rent. How much rent did she  pay before my husband bought the house?&#8221;
  &#8220;Fifteen dollars a quarter.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then she has not paid rent for six months. I find she owes my  husband's estate thirty dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;Colonel Preston told her she wasn't to pay it.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do I know that?&#8221;
  &#8220;My mother says it, and she wouldn't tell a lie,&#8221; said Andy,  indignantly.
  &#8220;I have nothing to say as to that,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston. &#8220;I am now  managing the estate, and the question rests with me. I decide that your  mother has been sufficiently paid for her services, and I shall claim  rent for the last six months.&#8221;
  Andy was silent for a moment. Then he spoke:
  &#8220;It may be so, Mrs. Preston. I'll speak to the doctor, and I'll do  as he says.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know what the doctor has to do with the matter,&#8221; said Mrs.  Preston, haughtily.
  &#8220;He wants to get an excuse for not paying,&#8221; said Godfrey, with a  sneer.
  &#8220;Mind your business,&#8221; said Andy, excusably provoked.
  &#8220;Do you hear that, mother?&#8221; said Godfrey. &#8220;Are you going to let that  beggar insult me before your very face?&#8221;
  &#8220;You have spoken very improperly to my son,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston.
  &#8220;He spoke very improperly to me at first,&#8221; said Andy, sturdily.
  &#8220;You do not appear to understand the respect due to me,&#8221; said Mrs.  Preston, with emphasis.
  &#8220;If I've treated you disrespectfully, I'm sorry,&#8221; said Andy; &#8220;but  Godfrey mustn't insult me, and call me names.&#8221;
  &#8220;We have had enough of this,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston. &#8220;I have only to  repeat that your mother is indebted to me for six months' rent&#8212;thirty  dollars&#8212;which I desire she will pay as soon as possible. One thing  more: I must request her to find another home, as I have other plans  for the house she occupies.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're not goin' to turn her out of her house, sure?&#8221; said Andy, in  some dismay.
  &#8220;It is not her house,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston; though it occurred to her  that it might have been, if she had not suppressed the will. But, of  course, Andy knew nothing of this, nor did he suspect anything, since  neither he nor his mother had the faintest idea of being remembered in  Colonel Preston's will, kind though he had been to them both in his  life.
  &#8220;I know it isn't,&#8221; said Andy; &#8220;but she's got used to it. I don't  know any other place we can get.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is your lookout,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston. &#8220;I have no doubt you can  get in somewhere. As I said, the house is mine, and I have other views  for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can't we stay till the end of the quarter, ma'am?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I wish to finish my business here as soon as possible, and then  shall go to Boston.&#8221;
  &#8220;How long can we stay, then?&#8221;
  &#8220;Till the first of the month.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's only three days.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is long enough to find another place. That is all I have to  say,&#8221; and Mrs. Preston turned to go.
  Andy rose, and followed her, without a word. He saw that it would be  of no use to appeal for more time. Her tone was so firm and determined  that there evidently was no moving her.
  &#8220;What will we do?&#8221; thought Andy, as he walked slowly and silently  along the road.
  He felt the need of consulting somebody older and more experienced  than himself. Just in the nick of time he met Dr. Townley, in whose  friendship he felt confidence.
  &#8220;Can you stop a minute, Dr. Townley?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to speak to  you about something.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can spare two minutes, if you like, Andy,&#8221; said the doctor,  smiling.
  Andy explained the case.
  &#8220;It is quite true,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Colonel Preston intended your  mother to pay no rent&#8212;he told me so himself; but, as your mother has  no written proof, I suppose you will have to pay it. Shall I lend you  the money?&#8221;
  &#8220;No need, doctor. We've got money enough for that. But we must move  out in three days. Where shall we go?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell you. I own the small house occupied by Grant Melton. He  sets out for the West to-morrow, with his family. I'll let it to your  mother for the same rent she's been paying.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Andy, gratefully. &#8220;It's better than the house  we've been living in. It's a good change.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps you won't like me for a landlord so well as Mrs. Preston,&#8221;  said the doctor, smiling.
  &#8220;I'll risk it,&#8221; said Andy.
  Two days afterward the transfer was made. Mrs. Preston was  disappointed, and Godfrey still more so, to find their malice had done  the widow Burke no harm.
  By advice of the doctor, Andy deferred paying the thirty dollars  claimed as rent, availing himself of the twelve months allowed for the  payment of debts due the estate of one deceased.
  &#8220;If it was anybody else, I'd pay at once,&#8221; said Andy; &#8220;but Mrs.  Preston has treated us so meanly that I don't mean to hurry.&#8221;
  The delay made Mrs. Preston angry, but she was advised that it was  quite legal.
