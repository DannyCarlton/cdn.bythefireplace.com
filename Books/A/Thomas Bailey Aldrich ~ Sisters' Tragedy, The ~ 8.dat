<b>I</b> 
Shakespeare and Milton--what third blazoned name<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall lips of after-ages link to these?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His who, beside the wild encircling seas,<br> Was England's voice, her voice with one acclaim,<br> For threescore years; whose word of praise was fame,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose scorn gave pause to man's iniquities. 
<b>II</b> 
What strain was his in that Crimean war?<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bugle-call in battle; a low breath,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plaintive and sweet, above the fields of death!<br> So year by year the music rolled afar,<br> From Euxine wastes to flowery Kandahar,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bearing the laurel or the cypress wreath. 
<b>III</b> 
Others shall have their little space of time,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their proper niche and bust, then fade away<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the darkness, poets of a day;<br> But thou, O builder of enduring rhyme,<br> Thou shalt not pass! Thy fame in every clime<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On earth shall live where Saxon speech has sway. 
<b>IV</b> 
Waft me this verse across the winter sea,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through light and dark, through mist and blinding sleet,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O winter winds, and lay it at his feet;<br> Though the poor gift betray my poverty,<br> At his feet lay it: it may chance that he<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will find no gift, where reverence is, unmeet.
