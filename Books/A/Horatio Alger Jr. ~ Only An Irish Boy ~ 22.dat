  Four weeks afterward, we will introduce the reader into the  bedchamber of Colonel Preston. His sickness has been severe. At times  recovery was doubtful, but Mrs. Burke has proved a careful and devoted  nurse, intelligent and faithful enough to carry out the directions of  the physician.
  &#8220;How do you feel this morning, Colonel Preston?&#8221; asked the doctor,  who had just entered the chamber.
  &#8220;Better, doctor. I feel quite an appetite.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are looking better&#8212;decidedly better. The disease has spent its  force, and retreated from the field.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is to you that the credit belongs, Dr. Townley.&#8221;
  &#8220;Only in part. The greater share belongs to your faithful nurse,  Mrs. Burke.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall not soon forget my obligations to her,&#8221; said the sick man,  significantly.
  &#8220;Now, Colonel Preston,&#8221; said Mrs. Burke, &#8220;you are making too much of  what little I have done.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is impossible, Mrs. Burke. It is to your good nursing and the  doctor's skill that I owe my life, and I hardly know to which the  most.&#8221;
  &#8220;To the doctor, sir. I only followed out his directions.&#8221;
  &#8220;At the expense of your own health. You show the effects of your  long-continued care.&#8221;
  &#8220;It won't take long to pick up,&#8221; said Mrs. Burke, cheerfully.
  &#8220;Is the danger of contagion over, doctor?&#8221; asked the patient.
  &#8220;Quite so.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, would it not be well to write to Mrs. Preston? Not that I  mean to give up my good nurse just yet; that is, if she is willing to  stay.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will stay as long as you need me, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is well; but Mrs. Preston may wish to return, now that there's  no further danger.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will write to her at once.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
  The following letter was dispatched to Mrs. Preston:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;MRS. PRESTON:&#8212; <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Dear Madam: It gives me great pleasure to inform you that <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your husband is so far recovered that there is no danger now <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of infection. You can return with safety, and he will, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubtless, be glad to see you. He has been very ill, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed&#8212;in danger of his life; but, thanks to the devotion of <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Burke, who has proved an admirable nurse, he is now on <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the high road to recovery. Yours respectfully, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;John Townley.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think that will bring her,&#8221; said the doctor.
  But he reckoned without his host.
  The next day he received the following letter, on scented paper:
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;MY DEAR DOCTOR TOWNLEY: You cannot think how rejoiced I am <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive the tidings of my husband's convalescence. I have <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been so tortured with anxiety during the last four weeks! You <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot think how wretchedly anxious I have been. I could not <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have endured to stay away from his bedside but that my duty <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imperatively required it. I have lost flesh, and my anxiety <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has worn upon me. Now, how gladly will I resume my place at <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bedside of my husband, restored by your skill. I am glad <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nurse has proved faithful. It was a good chance for her, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she shall be liberally paid, and no doubt the money will <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be welcome. But don't you think it might be more prudent for <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to defer my return until next week? It will be safer, I <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think, and I owe it to my boy to be very careful. You know, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the contagion may still exist. It is hard for me to remain <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer away, when I would fain fly to the bedside of Mr. <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preston, but I feel that it is best. Say to him, with my <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love, that he may expect me next week. Accept my thanks for <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your attention to him. I shall never forget it; and believe <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to be, my dear doctor, your obliged <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;Lucinda Preston.&#8221;
  Dr. Townley threw down this letter with deep disgust.
  &#8220;Was ever any woman more disgustingly selfish?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Her  husband might have died, so far as she was concerned.&#8221;
  Of course, he had to show this letter to Colonel Preston.
  The latter read it, with grave face, and the doctor thought he heard  a sigh.
  &#8220;My wife is very prudent,&#8221; he said, with a touch of bitterness in  his voice.
  &#8220;She will be here next week,&#8221; said the doctor, having nothing else  to answer.
  &#8220;I think she will run no risk then,&#8221; said the sick man, cynically.
  But Mrs. Preston did not return in a week. It was a full week and a  half before she arrived at her own house.
  The doctor was just coming out of the front door.
  &#8220;How is my husband?&#8221; she asked.
  &#8220;Not far from well. He is still weak, of course.&#8221;
  &#8220;And are you sure,&#8221; she said, anxiously, &#8220;that there is no danger of  infection?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not the slightest, madam,&#8221; said Dr. Townley, coldly.
  &#8220;I am so glad I can see him once more. You cannot imagine,&#8221; she  exclaimed, clasping her hands, &#8220;how much I have suffered in my  suspense!&#8221;
  The doctor remained cool and unmoved. He didn't feel that he could  respond fittingly, being absolutely incredulous.
  Mrs. Preston saw it, and was nettled. She knew that she was a  hypocrite, but did not like to have the doctor, by his silence, imply  his own conviction of it.
  &#8220;Mine has been a hard position,&#8221; she continued.
  &#8220;Your husband has not had an easy time,&#8221; said the doctor,  significantly.
  &#8220;But he has had good care&#8212;Mrs. Burke was a good nurse?&#8221;
  &#8220;Admirable.&#8221;
  &#8220;She must be paid well.&#8221;
  &#8220;I offered her ten dollars a week.&#8221;
  &#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, doubtfully, in whose eyes five dollars  would have been liberal compensation. &#8220;It has been a good chance for  her.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is far from adequate,&#8221; said the doctor, disgusted. &#8220;Money cannot  pay for such service as hers, not to speak of the risk she ran, for  cases have been known of persons being twice attacked by the disease.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't think my husband will have a relapse?&#8221; asked Mrs.  Preston, with fresh alarm.
  &#8220;Not if he has the same care for a short time longer.&#8221;
  &#8220;He shall have it. She must stay. Of course her duties are lighter  now, and six dollars a week for the remainder of the time will be  enough&#8212;don't you think so?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I don't,&#8221; said the doctor, bluntly; &#8220;and, moreover, I am quite  sure your husband will not consent to reducing the wages of one whose  faithful care has saved his life.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, well, you know best,&#8221; said Mrs. Preston, slowly. &#8220;I am quite  willing that she should be well paid.&#8221;
  Mrs. Preston went upstairs, and entered her husband's chamber.
  &#8220;Oh, my dear husband!&#8221; she exclaimed, theatrically, hurrying across  the room, with affected emotion. &#8220;I am so glad to find you so much  better!&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad to see you back, Lucinda,&#8221; said Colonel Preston; but he  spoke coldly, and without the slightest affectation of sentimental joy.  &#8220;I have passed through a good deal since you left me.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so have I!&#8221; exclaimed his wife. &#8220;Oh, how my heart has been rent  with anxiety, as I thought of you lying sick, while duty kept me from  your side.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is Godfrey well?&#8221; asked her husband, taking no notice of her last  speech.
  &#8220;Yes, poor boy! He sends his love, and is so anxious to see you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let him come next Friday afternoon,&#8221; said the sick man, who doubted  this statement, yet wanted to believe it true.
  &#8220;He shall. I will write to him at once.&#8221;
  So Mrs. Preston resumed her place in the house; but from that time  there was a something she could not understand in her husband's manner.  He was graver than formerly, and sometimes she saw him watching her  intently, and, after a little, turn away, with a sigh.
  He had found her out in all her intense selfishness and want of  feeling, and he could never again regard her as formerly, even though  she tried hard at times, by a show of affection, to cover up her  heartless neglect.
