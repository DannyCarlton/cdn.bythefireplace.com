From yonder gilded minaret<br> Beside the steel-blue Neva set,<br> I faintly catch, from time to time,<br> The sweet, aerial midnight chime--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God save the Tsar!" 
Above the ravelins and the moats<br> Of the white citadel it floats;<br> And men in dungeons far beneath<br> Listen, and pray, and gnash their teeth--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God save the Tsar!" 
The soft reiterations sweep<br> Across the horror of their sleep,<br> a term of endearment applied<br> to the Tsar in Russian folk-song.<br> As if some daemon in his glee<br> Were mocking at their misery--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God save the Tsar!" 
In his Red Palace over there,<br> Wakeful, he needs must hear the prayer.<br> How can it drown the broken cries<br> Wrung from his children's agonies?--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "God save the Tsar!" 
Father they called him from of old--<br> Batuschka! . . . How his heart is cold!<br> Wait till a million scourged men<br> Rise in their awful might, and then--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; God save the Tsar!
