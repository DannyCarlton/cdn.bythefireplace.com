Felix wound his way painfully through the deep fern-brake of the jungle,  by no regular path, so as to avoid exciting the alarm of the natives, and  to take Tu-Kila-Kila's palace-temple from the rear, where the big tree,  which overshadowed it with its drooping branches, was most easily  approachable. As he and Toko crept on, bending low, through that dense  tropical scrub, in deathly silence, they were aware all the time of a  low, crackling sound that rang ever some paces in the rear on their trail  through the forest. It was Tu-Kila-Kila's Eyes, following them stealthily  from afar, footstep for footstep, through the dense undergrowth of bush,  and the crisp fallen leaves and twigs that snapped light beneath their  footfall. What hope of success with those watchful spies, keen as beagles  and cruel as bloodhounds, following ever on their track? What chance of  escape for Felix and Muriel, with the cannibal man-gods toils laid round  on every side to insure their destruction?    
Silently and cautiously the two men groped their way on through the dark  gloom of the woods, in spite of their mute pursuers. The moonlight  flickered down athwart the trackless soil as they went; the hum of  insects innumerable droned deep along the underbrush. Now and then the  startled scream of a night jar broke the monotony of the buzz that was  worse than silence; owls boomed from the hollow trees, and fireflies  darted dim through the open spaces. At last they emerged upon the cleared  area of the temple. There Felix, without one moment's hesitation, with a  firm and resolute tread, stepped over the white coral line that marked  the taboo of the great god's precincts. That was a declaration of open  war; he had crossed the Rubicon of Tu-Kila-Kila's empire. Toko stood  trembling on the far side; none might pass that mystic line unbidden and  live, save the Korong alone who could succeed in breaking off the bough  "with yellow leaves, resembling a mistletoe," of which Methuselah, the  parrot, had told Felix and Muriel, and so earn the right to fight for his  life with the redoubted and redoubtable Tu-Kila-Kila.    
As he stepped over the taboo-line, Felix was aware of many native eyes  fixed stonily upon him from the surrounding precinct. Clearly they were  awaiting him. Yet not a soul gave the alarm; that in itself would have  been to break taboo. Every man or woman among the temple attendants  within that charmed circle stood on gaze curiously. Close by, Ula, the  favorite wife of the man-god, crouched low by the hut, with one finger  on her treacherous lips, bending eagerly forward, in silent expectation  of what next might happen. Once, and once only, she glanced at Toko  with a mute sign of triumph; then she fixed her big eyes on Felix in  tremulous anxiety; for to her as to him, life and death now hung  absolutely on the issue of his enterprise. A little farther back the King  of Fire and the King of Water, in full sacrificial robes, stood smiling  sardonically. For them it was merely a question of one master more or  less, one Tu-Kila-Kila in place of another. They had no special interest  in the upshot of the contest, save in so far as they always hated most  the man who for the moment held by his own strong arm the superior  godship over them. Around, Tu-Kila-Kila's Eyes kept watch and ward in  sinister silence. Taboo was stronger than even the commands of the high  god himself. When once a Korong had crossed that fatal line, unbidden and  unwelcomed by Tu-Kila-Kila, he came as Tu-Kila-Kila's foe and would-be  successor; the duty of every guardian of the temple was then to see fair  play between the god that was and the god that might be--the Tu-Kila-Kila  of the hour and the Tu-Kila-Kila who might possibly supplant him.    
"Let the great spirit itself choose which body it will inhabit," the King  of Fire murmured in a soft, low voice, glancing toward a dark spot at the  foot of the big tree. The moonlight fell dim through the branches on the  place where he looked. The glibbering bones of dead victims rattled  lightly in the wind. Felix's eyes followed the King of Fire's, and saw,  lying asleep upon the ground, Tu-Kila-Kila himself, with his spear and  tomahawk.    
He lay there, huddled up by the very roots of the tree, breathing deep  and regularly. Right over his head projected the branch, in one part of  whose boughs grew the fateful parasite. By the dim light of the moon,  straggling through the dense foliage, Felix could see its yellow leaves  distinctly. Beneath it hung a skeleton, suspended by invisible cords,  head downward from the branches. It was the skeleton of a previous Korong  who had tried in vain to reach the bough, and perished. Tu-Kila-Kila had  made high feast on the victim's flesh; his bones, now collected together  and cunningly fastened with native rope, served at once as a warning and  as a trap or pitfall for all who might rashly venture to follow him.    
Felix stood for one moment, alone and awe-struck, a solitary civilized  man, among those hideous surroundings. Above, the cold moon; all about,  the grim, stolid, half-hostile natives; close by, that strange,  serpentine, savage wife, guarding, cat-like, the sleep of her cannibal  husband; behind, the watchful Eyes of Tu-Kila-Kila, waiting ever in the  background, ready to raise a loud shout of alarm and warning the moment  the fatal branch was actually broken, but mute, by their vows, till that  moment was accomplished. Then a sudden wild impulse urged him on to the  attempt. The banyan had dropped down rooting offsets to the ground, after  the fashion of its kind, from its main branches. Felix seized one of  these and swung himself lightly up, till he reached the very limb on  which the sacred parasite itself was growing.    
To get to the parasite, however, he must pass directly above  Tu-Kila-Kila's head, and over the point where that ghastly grinning  skeleton was suspended, as by an unseen hair, from the fork that bore it.    
He walked along, balancing himself, and clutching, as he went, at the  neighboring boughs, while Tu-Kila-Kila, overcome with the kava, slept  stolidly and heavily on beneath him. At last he was almost within grasp  of the parasite. Could he lunge out and clutch it? One try--one effort!  No, no; he almost lost footing and fell over in the attempt. He couldn't  keep his balance so. He must try farther on. Come what might, he must go  past the skeleton.    
The grisly mass swung again, clanking its bones as it swung, and groaned  in the wind ominously. The breeze whistled audibly through its hollow  skull and vacant eye-sockets. Tu-Kila-Kila turned uneasily in his sleep  below. Felix saw there was not one instant of time to be lost now. He  passed on boldly; and as he passed, a dozen thin cords of paper mulberry,  stretched every way in an invisible network among the boughs, too small  to be seen in the dim moonlight, caught him with their toils and almost  overthrew him. They broke with his weight, and Felix himself, tumbling  blindly, fell forward. At the cost of a sprained wrist and a great jerk  on his bruised fingers, he caught at a bough by his side, but wrenched it  away suddenly. It was touch and go. At the very same moment, the skeleton  fell heavily, and rattled on the ground beside Tu-Kila-Kila.    
Before Felix could discover what had actually happened, a very great  shout went up all round below, and made him stagger with excitement.  Tu-Kila-Kila was awake, and had started up, all intent, mad with wrath  and kava. Glaring about him wildly, and brandishing his great spear in  his stalwart hands, he screamed aloud, in a perfect frenzy of passion and  despair: "Where is he, the Korong? Bring him on, my meat! Let me devour  his heart! Let me tear him to pieces. Let me drink of his blood! Let me  kill him and eat him!"    
Sick and desperate at the accident, Felix, in turn, clinging hard to his  bough with one hand, gazed wildly about him to look for the parasite. But  it had gone as if by magic. He glanced around in despair, vaguely  conscious that nothing was left for it now but to drop to the ground  and let himself be killed at leisure by that frantic savage. Yet even as  he did so, he was aware of that great cry--a cry as of triumph--still  rending the air. Fire and Water had rushed forward, and were holding back  Tu-Kila-Kila, now black in the face from rage, with all their might. Ula  was smiling a malicious joy. The Eyes were all agog with interest and  excitement. And from one and all that wild scream rose unanimous to the  startled sky: "He has it! He has it! The Soul of the Tree! The Spirit of  the World! The great god's abode. Hold off your hands, Lavita, son of  Sami! Your trial has come. He has it! He has it!"    
Felix looked about him with a whirling brain. His eye fell suddenly.  There, in his own hand, lay the fateful bough. In his efforts to steady  himself, he had clutched at it by pure accident, and broken it off  unawares with the force of his clutching. As fortune would have it, he  grasped it still. His senses reeled. He was almost dead with excitement,  suspense, and uncertainty, mingled with pain of his wrenched wrist. But  for Muriel's sake he pulled himself together. Gazing down and trying hard  to take it all in--that strange savage scene--he saw that Tu-Kila-Kila  was making frantic attempts to lunge at him with the spear, while the  King of Fire and the King of Water, stern and relentless, were holding  him off by main force, and striving their best to appease and quiet him.    
There was an awful pause. Then a voice broke the stillness from beyond  the taboo-line:    
"The Shadow of the King of the Rain speaks," it said, in very solemn,  conventional accents. "Korong! Korong! The Great Taboo is broken. Fire  and Water, hold him in whom dwells the god till my master comes. He has  the Soul of all the spirits of the wood in his hands. He will fight for  his right. Taboo! Taboo! I, Toko, have said it."    
He clapped his hands thrice.    
Tu-Kila-Kila made a wild effort to break away once more. But the King of  Fire, standing opposite him, spoke still louder and clearer. "If you  touch the Korong before the line is drawn," he said, with a voice of  authority, "you are no Tu-Kila-Kila, but an outcast and a criminal. All  the people will hold you with forked sticks, while the Korong burns you  alive slowly, limb by limb, with me, who am Fire, the fierce, the  consuming. I will scorch you and bake you till you are as a bamboo in the  flame. Taboo! Taboo! Taboo! I, Fire, have said it."    
The King of Water, with three attendants, forced Tu-Kila-Kila on one  side for a moment. Ula stood by and smiled pleased compliance. A temple  slave, trembling all over at this conflict of the gods, brought out a  calabash full of white coral-sand. The King of Water spat on it and  blessed it. By this time a dozen natives, at least, had assembled outside  the taboo-line, and stood eagerly watching the result of the combat. The  temple slave made a long white mark with the coral-sand on one side of  the cleared area. Then he handed the calabash solemnly to Toko. Toko  crossed the sacred precinct with a few inaudible words of muttered charm,  to save the Taboo, as prescribed in the mysteries. Then he drew a similar  line on the ground on his side, some twenty yards off. "Descend, O my  lord!" he cried to Felix; and Felix, still holding the bough tight in his  hand, swung himself blindly from the tree, and took his place by Toko.    
"Toe the line!" Toko cried, and Felix toed it.    
"Bring up your god!" the Shadow called out aloud to the King of Water.  And the King of Water, using no special ceremony with so great a duty,  dragged Tu-Kila-Kila helplessly along with him to the farther taboo-line.    
The King of Water brought a spear and tomahawk. He handed them to Felix.  "With these weapons," he said, "fight, and merit heaven. I hold the bough  meanwhile--the victor takes it."    
The King of Fire stood out between the lists. "Korongs and gods," he  said, "the King of the Rain has plucked the sacred bough, according to  our fathers' rites, and claims trial which of you two shall henceforth  hold the sacred soul of the world, the great Tu-Kila-Kila. Wager of  Battle decides the day. Keep toe to line. At the end of my words, forth,  forward, and fight for it. The great god knows his own, and will choose  his abode. Taboo, Taboo, Taboo! I, Fire, have spoken it."    
Scarcely were the words well out of his mouth, when, with a wild whoop of  rage, Tu-Kila-Kila, who had the advantage of knowing the rules of the  game, so to speak, dashed madly forward, drunk with passion and kava, and  gave one lunge with his spear full tilt at the breast of the startled and  unprepared white man. His aim, though frantic, was not at fault. The  spear struck Felix high up on the left side. He felt a dull thud of pain;  a faint gurgle of blood. Even in the pale moonlight his eye told him at  once a red stream was trickling--out over his flannel shirt. He was  pricked, at least. The great god had wounded him.
