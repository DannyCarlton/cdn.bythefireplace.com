That was almost the last thing Granville Kelmscott knew. Some  strange shadowy dreams, to be sure, disturbed the lethargy into which  he fell soon after; but they were intermittent and indefinite. He  was vaguely aware of being lifted with gentle care into somebody's  arms, and of the somebody staggering along with him, not without  considerable difficulty, over the rough stony ground of that South  African plateau. He remembered also, as in a trance, some sound of  angry voices--a loud expostulation--a hasty palaver--a long slow  pause--a gradual sense of reconciliation and friendliness--during  all which, as far as he could recover the circumstances afterwards,  he must have been extended on the earth, with his back propped  against a great ledge of jutting rock, and his head hanging listless  on his sinking breast. Thenceforward all was blank, or just dimly  perceived at long intervals between delirium and unconsciousness.  He was ill for many days, where or how he knew not.    
In some half dreamy way, he was aware too, now and again, of strange  voices by his side, strange faces tending him. But they were black  faces, all, and the voices spoke in deep guttural tones, unlike  even the clicks and harsh Bantu jerks with which he had grown  so familiar in eighteen months among the Barolong. This that he  heard now, or seemed to hear in his delirium, like distant sounds  of water, was a wholly different and very much harsher tongue--the  tongue of the Namaquas, in fact, though Granville was far too ill  and too drowsy just then to think of reasoning about it or classifying  it in any way. All he knew for the moment was that sometimes, when  he turned round feebly on his bed of straw, and asked for drink  or help in a faltering voice, no white man appeared to answer  his summons. Black, faces all--black, black, and unfamiliar. Very  intermittently he was conscious of a faint sense of loneliness. He  knew not why. But he thought he could guess. Guy Waring had deserted  him!    
At last, one morning, after more days had passed than Granville  could possibly count, all of a sudden, in a wild whirl, he came  to himself again at once, with that instant revulsion of complete  awakening which often occurs at the end of long fits of delirium  in malarious fever. A light burst in upon him with a flash. In  a moment, his brain seemed to clear all at once, and everything  to grow plain as day before him. He raised himself on one wasted  elbow and gazed around him with profound awe. He saw it all now;  he remembered everything, everything.    
He was alone, among savages in the far heart of Africa.    
He lay on his back, on a heap of fresh straw, in a close and filthy  mud-built hut. Under his aching neck a wooden pillow or prop of  native make supported his head. Two women and a man bent over him  and smiled. Their faces, though black, were far from unkindly.  They were pleased to see him stare about with such meaning in his  eyes. They were friendly, no doubt. They seemed really to take an  interest in their patient's recovery.    
But where was Guy Waring? Dead? Dead? Or run away? Had his  half-brother, in this utmost need, then, so basely deserted him?    
For some minutes, Granville gazed around him, half dazed, and in  a turmoil of surprise, yet with a vivid passion of acute inquiry.  Now he was once well awake, he must know all immediately. But  how? Who to ask? This was terrible, terrible. He had no means of  intercommunication with the people in the hut. He knew none of their  language, nor they of his. He was utterly alone, among unmitigated  savages.    
Meanwhile, the man and the women talked loud among themselves in  their own harsh speech, evidently well pleased and satisfied at  their guest's improvement. With a violent effort, Granville began to  communicate with them in the language of signs which every savage  knows as he knows his native tongue, and in which the two Englishmen  had already made some progress during their stay in Barolong land.    
Pointing first to himself, with one hand on his breast, he held  up two fingers before the observant Namaqua, to indicate that at  first there had been a couple of them on the road, both white men.  The latter point he still further elaborated by showing the white  skin on his own bare wrist, and once more holding up the two fingers  demonstratively. The Namaqua nodded. He had seized the point well.  He held up two fingers in return himself; then looked at his own  black wrist and shook his head in dissent--they were not black men;  after which he touched Granville's fair forearm with his hand; yes,  yes, just so; he took it in; two white men.    
What had become of the other one? Granville asked in the same fashion,  by looking around him on all sides in dumb show, inquiringly. One  finger only was held up now, pointing about the hut; one hand was  laid upon his own breast to show that a single white man alone  remained. He glanced about him uneasily. What had happened to his  companion?    
The Namaqua pointed with his finger to the door of the hut, as much  as to say the other man was gone. He seized every sign at once  with true savage quickness.    
Then Granville tried once more. Was his companion dead? Had he been  killed in a fight? Was that the reason of his absence? He lunged  forward with his hand holding an imaginary assegai. He pressed on  upon the foe; he drove it through a body. Then he fell, as if dead,  on the floor, with a groan and a shriek. After which, picking  himself up as well as he was able, and crawling back to his straw,  he proceeded in mute pantomime to bury himself decently.    
The Namaqua shook his head again with a laugh of dissent. Oh no;  not like that. It had happened quite otherwise. The missing white  man was well and vigorous, a slap on his own chest sufficiently  indicated that news. He placed his two first fingers in the ground,  astride like legs, and made them walk along fast, one in front  of the other. The white man had gone away. He had gone on foot.  Granville nodded acquiescence. The savage took water in a calabash  and laid it on the floor. Then he walked once more with his fingers,  as if on a long and weary march, to the water's brink. Granville  nodded comprehension again. He understood the signs. The white man  had gone away, alone, on foot--and seaward.    
At that instant, with a sudden cry of terror, the invalid's hands  went down to his waist, where he wore the girdle that contained  those precious diamonds--the diamonds that were to be the ransom  of some fraction of Tilgate. An awful sense of desertion broke over  him all at once. He called aloud in his horror. It was too much to  believe. The girdle was gone, and the diamonds with it!    
Hypocrite! Hypocrite! Thief! Murderer! Robber! He had trusted that  vile creature, that plausible wretch, in spite of all the horrible  charges he knew against him. And <i>this</i> was the sequel of their talk  that day! <i>This</i> was how Guy Waring had requited his confidence.    
He had stolen the fruits of eighteen months' labour.    
Granville turned to the Namaqua, wild with his terrible loss, and  pointed angrily to his loins, where the diamonds were not. The  savage nodded; looked wise and shook his head; pretended to gird  himself round the waist with a cloth; then went over to Granville,  who lay still in the straw, undid an imaginary belt, with deliberate  care, tied it round his own body above the other one, with every  appearance of prudence and forethought, counted the small stones  in it one by one, in his hand, to the exact number, with grotesque  fidelity, and finally set his fingers to walk a second time at a  rapid pace, in the direction of the calabash which represented the  ocean.    
Granville fell back on his wooden pillow with a horrible groan of  awakened distrust. The man had gone off, that was clear, and had  stolen his diamonds That is what comes of intrusting your life and  property to a discovered murderer. How could he ever have been such  a fool? He would never forgive himself.    
The desertion itself was bad enough in all conscience; but it was  as nothing at all in Granville's mind to the wickedness of the  robbery.    
He might have known it, of course. How that fellow toiled and moiled  and gloated over his wretched diamonds! How little he seemed to  think of the stain of blood on his hands, and how much of the mere  chance of making filthy lucre! Pah! Pah! it was pitiable. The man's  whole mind was distorted by a hideous fungoid growth--the love of  gain, which is the root of all evil. For a few miserable stones,  he would plunder his own brother, lying helpless and ill in that  African hut, and make off with the booty himself, saving his own  skin, seaward.    
If it hadn't been for the unrequited kindness of these mere savage  Namaquas, Granville cried to himself in his bitterness, he might  have died of want in the open desert. And now he would go down to  the coast, after all, a ruined man, penniless and friendless. It  was a hard thought indeed for a Kelmscott to think he should have  been abandoned and robbed by his own half-brother, and should owe  his life now to a heathen African. The tender mercies of a naked  barbarian in a mud-built hut were better than the false friendship  of his father's son, the true heir of Tilgate.    
It was miserable! pitiable! The shock of that discovery threw  Granville back once more into a profound fever. For several hours  he relapsed into delirium. And the worst of it was, the negroes  wouldn't let him die quietly in his own plain way. In the midst of  it all, he was dimly aware of a dose thrust down his throat. It  was the Namaqua administering him a pill--some nauseous native  decoction, no doubt--which tasted as if it were made of stiff white  paper.
