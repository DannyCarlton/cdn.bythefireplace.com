In the year following the beginning of his acquaintanceship with Edith  Carson McGregor continued to work hard and steadily in the warehouse  and with his books at night. He was promoted to be foreman, replacing  the German, and he thought he had made progress with his studies. When  he did not go to the night school he went to Edith Carson's place and  sat reading a book and smoking his pipe by a little table in the back  room.    
About the room and in and out of her shop moved Edith, going softly  and quietly. A light began to come into her eyes and colour into her  cheeks. She did not talk but new and daring thoughts visited her mind  and a thrill of reawakened life ran through her body. With gentle  insistence she did not let her dreams express themselves in words and  almost hoped that she might be able to go on forever thus, having this  strong man come into her presence and sit absorbed in his own affairs  within the walls of her house. Sometimes she wanted him to talk and  wished that she had the power to lead him into the telling of little  facts of his life. She wanted to be told of his mother and father, of  his boyhood in the Pennsylvania town, of his dreams and his desires  but for the most part she was content to wait and only hoped that  nothing would happen to bring an end to her waiting.    
McGregor began to read books of history and became absorbed in the  figures of certain men, all soldiers and leaders of soldiers who  stalked across the pages wherein was written the story of man's life.  The figures of Sherman, Grant, Lee, Jackson, Alexander, Caesar,  Napoleon, and Wellington seemed to him to stand starkly up among the  other figures in the books and going to the Public Library at the noon  hour he got books concerning these men and for a time lost interest in  the study of law and devoted himself to contemplation of the breakers  of laws.    
There was something beautiful about McGregor in those days. He was as  virginal and pure as a chunk of the hard black coal out of the hills  of his own state and like the coal ready to burn himself out into  power. Nature had been kind to him. He had the gift of silence and of  isolation. All about him were other men, perhaps as strong physically  as himself and with better trained minds who were being destroyed and  he was not being destroyed. For the others life let itself run out in  the endless doing of little tasks, the thinking of little thoughts and  the saying of groups of words over and over endlessly like parrots  that sit in cages and earn their bread by screaming two or three  sentences to passers by.    
It is a terrible thing to speculate on how man has been defeated by  his ability to say words. The brown bear in the forest has no such  power and the lack of it has enabled him to retain a kind of nobility  of bearing sadly lacking in us. On and on through life we go,  socialists, dreamers, makers of laws, sellers of goods and believers  in suffrage for women and we continuously say words, worn-out words,  crooked words, words without power or pregnancy in them.    
The matter is one to be thought of seriously by youths and maidens  inclined to garrulousness. Those who have the habit of it will never  change. The gods who lean over the rim of the world to laugh at us  have marked them for their barrenness.    
And yet the word must run on. McGregor, the silent, wanted his word.  He wanted his true note as an individual to ring out above the hubbub  of voices and then he wanted to use the strength and the virility  within himself to carry his word far. What he did not want was that  his mouth become foul and his brain become numb with the saying of the  words and the thinking of the thoughts of other men and that he in his  turn become a mere toiling food-consuming chattering puppet to the  gods.    
For a long time the miner's son wondered what power lay in the men  whose figures stood up so boldly in the pages of the books he read. He  tried to think the matter out as he sat in Edith's room or walked by  himself through the streets. In the warehouse he looked with new  curiosity at the men who worked in the great rooms piling and unpiling  apple barrels and the boxes of eggs and fruit When he came into one of  the rooms the men who had been standing in groups idly talking of  their own affairs began to run busily about. They no longer chattered  but as long as he remained worked desperately, furtively watching as  he stood staring at them.    
McGregor wondered. He tried to fathom the mystery of the power that  made them willing to work until their bodies were bent and stooped,  that made them unashamed to be afraid and that left them in the end  mere slaves to words and formulas.    
The perplexed young man who watched the men in the warehouse began to  think that the passion for reproduction might have something to do  with the matter. Perhaps his constant association with Edith awakened  the thought. His own loins were heavy with the seeds of children and  only his absorption in the thought of finding himself kept him from  devoting himself to the feeding of his lusts. One day he had a talk  concerning the matter with a at the warehouse. The talk came about in  this way.    
In the warehouse the men came in at the door in the morning, drifting  in like flies that wander in at the open windows on a summer day. With  downcast eyes they shuffled across the long floor, white with lime.  Morning after morning they came in at the door and went silently to  their places looking at the floor and scowling. A slender bright-eyed  young man who acted as shipping clerk during the day sat in a little  coop and to him the men as they passed called out their numbers. From  time to time the shipping clerk who was an Irishman tried to joke with  one of them, tapping sharply upon his desk with a pencil as though to  compel attention. "They are no good," he said to himself, when in  response to his sallies they only smiled vaguely. "Although they get  but a dollar and a half a day they are overpaid!" Like McGregor he had  nothing but contempt for the men whose numbers he put in the book.  Their stupidity he took as a compliment to himself. "We are the kind  who get things done," he thought as he put the pencil back of his ear  and closed the book. In his mind the futile pride of the middle class  man flamed up. In his contempt for the workers he forgot also to have  contempt for himself.    
One morning McGregor and the shipping clerk stood upon a board  platform facing the street and the shipping clerk talked of parentage.  "The wives of the workers here have children as cattle have calves,"  said the Irishman. Moved by some hidden sentiment within himself he  added heartily. "Oh well, what's a man for? It's nice to see kids  around the house. I've got four kids myself. You should see them play  about in the garden at my place in Oak Park when I come home in the  evening."    
McGregor thought of Edith Carson and a faint hunger began to grow  within him. A desire that was later to come near to upsetting the  purpose of his life began to make itself felt. With a growl he fought  against the desire and confused the Irishman by making an attack upon  him. "Well how are you any better?" he asked bluntly. "Do you think  your children any more important than theirs? You may have a better  mind but their bodies are better and your mind hasn't made you a very  striking figure as far as I can see."    
Turning away from the Irishman who had begun to sputter with wrath  McGregor went up an elevator to a distant part of the building to  think of the Irishman's words. From time to time he spoke sharply to a  workman who loitered in one of the passages between the piles of boxes  and barrels. Under his hand the work in the warehouse had begun to  take on order and the little grey-haired superintendent who had  employed him rubbed his hands with delight.    
In a corner by a window stood McGregor wondering why he also did not  want to devote his life to being the father of children. In the dim  light across the face of the window a fat old spider crawled slowly.  In the hideous body of the insect there was something that suggested  to the mind of the struggling thinker the sloth of the world. Vaguely  his mind groped about trying to get hold of words and ideas to express  what was in his brain. "Ugly crawling things that look at the floor,"  he muttered. "If they have children it is without order or orderly  purpose. It is an accident like the accident of the fly that falls  into the net built by the insect here. The coming of the children is  like the coming of the flies, it feeds a kind of cowardice in men. In  the children men hope vainly to see done what they have not the  courage to try to do."    
With an oath McGregor smashed with his heavy leather glove the fat  thing wandering aimlessly across the light. "I must not be confused by  little things. There is still going on the attempt to force me into  the hole in the ground. There is a hole here in which men live and  work just as there is in the mining town from which I came."

Hurrying out of his room that evening McGregor went to see Edith. He  wanted to look at her and to think. In the little room at the back he  sat for an hour trying to read a book and then for the first time  shared his thoughts with her. "I am trying to discover why men are of  so little importance," he said suddenly. "Are they mere tools for  women? Tell me that. Tell me what women think and what they want?"    
Without waiting for an answer he turned again to the reading of the  book. "Oh well," he added "it doesn't need to bother me. I won't let  any women lead me into being a reproductive tool for her."    
Edith was alarmed. She took McGregor's outburst as a declaration of  war against herself and her influence and her hands began to tremble.  Then a new thought came to her. "He needs money to get on in the  world," she told herself and a little thrill of joy ran through her as  she thought of her own carefully guarded hoard. She wondered how she  could offer it to him so that there would be no danger of a refusal.    
"You're all right," said McGregor, preparing to depart. "You do not  interfere with a man's thoughts."    
Edith blushed and like the workmen in the warehouse looked at the  floor. Something in his words startled her and when he was gone she  went to her desk and taking out her bankbook turned its pages with new  pleasure. Without hesitation she who indulged herself in nothing would  have given all to McGregor.    
And out into the street went the man, thinking of his own affairs. He  dismissed from his mind the thoughts of women and children and began  again to think of the stirring figures of history that had made so  strong an appeal to him. As he passed over one of the bridges he  stopped and stood leaning over the rail to look at the black water  below. "Why has thought never succeeded in replacing action?" he asked  himself. "Why are the men who write books in some way less full of  meaning than the men who do things?"    
McGregor was staggered by the thought that had come to him and  wondered if he had started on a wrong trail by coming to the city and  trying to educate himself. For an hour he stood in the darkness and  tried to think things out. It began to rain but he did not mind. Into  his brain began to creep a dream of a vast order coming out of  disorder. He was like one standing in the presence of some gigantic  machine with many intricate parts that had begun to run crazily, each  part without regard to the purpose of the whole. "There is danger in  thinking too," he muttered vaguely. "Everywhere there is danger, in  labour, in love and in thinking. What shall I do with myself?"    
McGregor turned about and threw up his hands. A new thought swept like  a broad path of light across the darkness of his mind. He began to see  that the soldiers who had led thousands of men into battle had  appealed to him because in the working out of their purposes they had  used human lives with the recklessness of gods. They had found the  courage to do that and their courage was magnificent. Away down deep  in the hearts of men lay sleeping a love of order and they had taken  hold of that love. If they had used it badly did that matter? Had they  not pointed the way?    
Back into McGregor's mind came a night scene in his home town. Vividly  he saw in fancy the poor unkempt little street facing the railroad  tracks and the groups of striking miners huddled in the light before  the door of a saloon while in the road a body of soldiers marched  past, their uniforms looking grey and their faces grim in the  uncertain light. "They marched," whispered McGregor. "That's what made  them seem so powerful. They were just ordinary men but they went  swinging along, all as one man. Something in that fact ennobled them.  That's what Grant knew and what Caesar knew. That's what made Grant  and Caesar seem so big. They knew and they were not afraid to use  their knowledge. Perhaps they did not bother to think how it would all  come out. They hoped for another kind of man to do the thinking.  Perhaps they did not think of anything at all but just went ahead and  tried to do each his own part.    
"I will do my part here," shouted McGregor. "I will find the way." His  body shook and his voice roared along the footpath of the bridge. Men  stopped to look back at the big shouting figure. Two women walking  past screamed and ran into the roadway. McGregor walked rapidly away  toward his own room and his books. He did not know how he would be  able to use the new impulse that had come to him but as he swung along  through dark streets and past rows of dark buildings he thought again  of the great machine running crazily and without purpose and was glad  he was not a part of it. "I will keep myself to myself and be ready  for what happens," he said, burning with new courage.
