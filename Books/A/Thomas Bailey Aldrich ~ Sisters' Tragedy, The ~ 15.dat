Pillared arch and sculptured tower<br> Of Ilium have had their hour;<br> The dust of many a king is blown<br> On the winds from zone to zone;<br> Many a warrior sleeps unknown.<br> Time and Death hold each in thrall,<br> Yet is Love the lord of all;<br> Still does Helen's beauty stir<br> Because a poet sang of her!
