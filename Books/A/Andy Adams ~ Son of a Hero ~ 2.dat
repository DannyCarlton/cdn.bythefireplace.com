  Into one of those cavernous pits often found at the bottom of Lake   Superior&#8212;&quot;the shining big sea water&quot; to a poet, perhaps, but a   sullen, fear-inspiring ocean to belated mariners&#8212;all that remained of   the Bannockburn had sunk for ever. She pounded herself to pieces   within six hours after striking upon an unknown reef near one of the   desolate islands that lie close to the horizon about Whitefish Point.   From those pits far beneath waves that are shiveringly cold even in   midsummer no ship ever breaks to rise again; and there&#8212;like things of   ice&#8212;human bodies lie intact until the judgment-day. 
  It was late in November, 1885, during a frightening hurricane that   swept suddenly out from over the uninhabited Canadian wildernesses to   spread ruin and death along white-duned shores that skirt the bleak,   forbidding forests of northern Michigan. 
  A week later, a little woman with gold-brown hair and big sleepless   eyes slipped once more into the marine office in Detroit, as the door   opened to give exit to a messenger. She had come many times before.   There was pathetic hopelessness in the glance she gave the clerk; the   agony of the hours that had passed since the Great Storm had stripped   her cheeks of colour and furrowed them with lines of suffering. She   had come so often that now her lips were parted in what might have   been the beginning of an apologetic smile had not the misery in her   heart destroyed it. The clerk turned his head and his heart throbbed a   little faster as the office stenographer lifted toward the inquirer   her eyes that were filled with the intense sympathy of woman for   woman. He went back and leaned over a ledger, leaving the little woman   standing silently outside the barred window. One of his duties was to   give the news of tragedy, to tell of storm and shipwreck, of men lost   and vessels saved&#8212;to bring happiness and to break hearts; but he   could not bring himself to do it now. He heard the stenographer rise   from her chair, and knew that she was going to the window. 
  &quot;Have&#8212;you heard of the Bannockburn?&quot; 
  The woman's voice barely rose above a whisper. For an instant there   was intense longing in her eyes; then, as the office girl hesitated,   struggling with the truth, hope shot into them with almost the gleam   of madness. 
  &quot;No, dear, we haven't,&quot; said the girl softly. &quot;I mean&#8212;nothing   definite. She was sighted off Grand Island just as the storm began,   but&#8212;she hasn't been seen at the Soo.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh!&#8212;My God!&quot; 
  The clerk, poring over the ledger, heard the stenographer swish  past  him into the next room. He knew why. He turned and looked at the   little woman, who stood with her face bowed in her hands just outside   his window. This was not a strange sight, for it had happened many   times during the past few days; usually the tragic news had not been   received so quietly. 
  Those were the days just after the Great Storm that comes once each   year. It comes in the days of late navigation, November or December,   when men and ships of the Inland Seas face a thousand perils in their   mad dashes from port to port through ice and snow. Never has it been   known to fail. And the one just past had raged with unprecedented fury   for seventy-two hours. From end to end of the lakes it had swept until   not one of the five escaped the destruction it wrought. Now the   stories of the tragedies were coming in over the wires, to be   disseminated among owners and the friends and relatives of the men   whom they hired. 
  Since early morning the clerk in the marine office had been busy   answering questions. There was a lull when the little woman came. But   now, as she stood sobbing quietly, an aged man, bent and hobbling, and   with snow-white hair touching his shoulders, stumbled up and inquired   in a cracked, trembling voice for news of his son's ship. She was safe   in port, and he hobbled away, mumbling with hysterical gladness. A   young woman, just behind him, with a little boy's hand clasped tightly   in her own, whispered for the fiftieth time for word of a wooden ship   upon which her husband had sailed. One after another they came, and   silently the little woman stood aside from them, unseeing and   unhearing, until a woman brushed past her sobbing aloud. 
  Instinctively she put out a hand, and the two white tear-wet faces   met. Both were young; sympathy glowed in their eyes. She whose husband   had gone with the Bannockburn spoke first. 
  &quot;Is it bad, dear?&quot; 
  &quot;No&#8212;no&#8212;no!&quot; sobbed the other. &quot;Thank God, they've heard! He's  safe&#8212;  safe! See this.&quot; 
  She held something out for the other to read. It was a telegram.  But  the little woman's blurred eyes could not see. She reached out and   flung her arms blindly around the other's neck, and kissed her. Then   she went forth into the storm. 
  The city was smothered in the damp grey chill of a windy,  sleet-filled  night, and in the face of it the Bannockburn Widow&#8212;for  by reason of a  custom of the lakes such poor unfortunates are  sometimes known by the  names of their husband's ill-fated  ships&#8212;passed up from the river,  and mingled with the hurrying,  home-bound throngs that were pouring  forth from the shops. She seemed  neither to see nor to hear; with  blinded eyes turned to the slippery  pavement she ran into other  pedestrians, until the breath was half  jostled out of her; a loiterer,  ensconced in the shelter of a doorway,  caught the prettiness of her  face, and brushed up to her side with a  raised umbrella. But he was  unnoticed. Without once looking ahead, the  woman continued through the  sleet. Only by her homing instinct was she  led in the right direction,  across the car-cluttered square, from  under the feet of carelessly  driven horses, and up the narrow,  alley-like street that passed her  home. So far as thoughts of herself  were concerned, her mind was a  blank. One thing alone seemed to fill  it&#8212;a vision of a coast of rock,  with the sea roaring against it, and  a black forest behind, and in the  midst of the hissing spume a ship  being beaten to pieces. She had seen  that coast of rock. Only that  summer she had passed it on the vacation  trip which her husband had  given her. He had pointed out the pictures  upon them, which had given  them the name, Pictured Rocks; and she had  shuddered when he told her  stories of ships that had gone ashore  there. 
  &quot;Some day I may go up against 'em myself, Nell,&quot; he had laughed.  And  she had laughed with him. As the memory of it came to her, she  moaned  aloud. 
  In front of a little cottage she paused. A small lamp burned dimly  in  one of the windows, and the Bannockburn Widow strained her eyes to   peer through into the room. After a few moments of silent watchfulness   she slipped like a shadow up the board walk to the narrow steps, and   tapped gently upon the door. It was cautiously opened, and an elderly   woman's face peered out at her. For an instant the eyes of the two   met, and the one who had opened the door stood back speechless while   the other entered. 
  &quot;Are they asleep?&quot; 
  The elder woman nodded. She tried to speak, but her lips seemed   frozen. While the other was taking off her drenched garments she drew   a shawl about her head, paused at the door a moment, stammered good   night, and hurried to her own home. 
  The sailor's young wife fell upon her knees beside a ragged,   upholstered chair, and buried her face in her arms. Her gold-brown   hair had become loosened, and fell in a damp, shining mass down her   back. For a long time she might have been in a swoon; but the fires of   her suffering were burning madly in her brain. All they produced were   pictures, pictures, pictures; bursting seas meeting cavernous rocks   with the tumult of thunder, a ship battling in a maelstrom of reef and   spume, the black forest bending in shrieking blasts and always   somewhere in this terrible scene a human face! And this face became   larger and nearer and more real to her, until its lips seemed to move   in speech; and out of the ghastly grey mists of her mental fantasm a   hand reached and beckoned, beckoned until she flung herself back with   a shriek. 
  A child's half-sleeping cry answered, and the woman sprang to her   feet, and stood, almost without breathing, clutching the edge of the   chair and listening. The cry did not come again. On tiptoe the woman   went until she could peer into a darkened room, where two little forms   lay huddled in the middle of a bed. 
  As silently she stole back again. A pencil and a tablet lay upon  the  table. Upon the tablet she wrote: 
  &quot;Ben is wrecked on the Pictured Rocks. I've gone to help him.  Please  care for the children until I come back.&quot; 
  Then she put on her water-soaked coat and hat, and went again out  into  the storm of the night, led on by the pictures in her brain. 
  They were becoming more and more distinct now. With each passing   moment she saw them clearer; and she knew that her duty was defined   and indubitable. It seemed a long time afterward that she came down   into the crashing tumult of shunting engines and the glare of a score   of fiery eyes that lighted up the sooty drizzle of the station yards.   The pictures left her brain for a time as she picked her way among   them. The dazzling headlights seemed like orbs of fire. Bewildered,   she stumbled over tracks and ties, until at last a trainman seized her   by an arm and piloted her to safety. Then the pictures came back, and   she forgot that she had been lost and in danger. She asked questions,   but none of those who answered them saw aught but the misery of some   passing misfortune in her face. Strangers looked at her pityingly, the   ticket agent curiously, and when she passed the gateman her white face   was bowed and hidden. 
  So she went into the train. The yards, with their inferno of  blazing  eyes and clanging bells, slipped behind unnoticed, the glow of  the  city melted away, and to the little widow the hours and miles  swept  past in meaningless procession. 
  Toward dawn she fell into what might have been sleep had it not  been  for the pictures. Her head rested upon her arm, and for a long  time  she lay crumpled up in her seat, starting now and then like one  in a  nightmare when her mental visions became too exciting. When she   straightened herself and looked out into the world again the sun was   shooting fleeting rays through the grimy window. Deep black forests   had taken the place of city and farmland; here and there a woodman's   shanty came into view; and through the open car door came the redolent   perfume of the pine wilderness. 
  This had been home to her once. It had been life to her, a life  which  she would not have bartered for the choice of a million  others&#8212;until  there came the man who afterward turned sailor. The  odour of the pine  was an old friend. It reached down into her soul and  wrenched her free  from the brain-pictures which were maddening her,  and she struggled to  her feet and went to the car door, and stood  there listening and  seeing and smelling, while a flush gathered in her  cheeks and her eyes  glowed with the warm beauty that made people love  them. Somewhere in  this big wilderness she had been a girl; somewhere  in it the little  farm of the old folks was buried;  somewhere&#8212;somewhere&#8212;in it&#8212;she had  met the man. The old thoughts  returned to her. The pictures came, one,  and two, and three, until in  their number and hurry they crowded and  crushed one another, and drove  the Bannockburn Widow back to her seat  with a white drawn face on  which was stamped all the misery and  hopelessness in life. 
  It was noon when the train ran into the little wilderness station  near  the white capped run of Superior. As the woman came out, she saw  the  black sweep of the lake over the tops of a thousand wind-wrought  dunes  beyond the shanty that was called a station, and on its  uttermost  edge, where the grey gloom of the sky seemed to reach down  into the  sombreness of the lake, her eyes caught the faint smoke of a   southbound freighter. 
  The sight of it fascinated her. As she stepped down from the car,  she  failed to notice the curious glances of men and boys whose daily   diversion was meeting the train. In her head the pictures seemed to   burst into flame, a heating, maddening fire that filled her with a   desire to shriek aloud to the ship which was a thing almost out of her   vision. But those who watched her saw nothing of the trouble in her   brain. She went slowly down among the dunes, and then to the edge of   the lake; and along that she trailed, bent and searching, until the   purple shadows of the beach-pines wrapped her from the following of   human eyes. None knew whence she came; none could guess whither she   was going. An old lumberman said that a squatter back in the woods was   expecting his wife from the south. But few believed that this was the   woman. And in the end the most curious of them all, a small boy, dived   off into the woods to discover things for himself. It was late when he   came back. The lake was shrouded in cold foggy gloom; the rising   night-winds were whistling in the pines; away off in their depths   sounded the lone, hungry cry of a wolf; and the woman, the boy said,   was miles away&#8212;with her face still turned to the peopleless barrens   of the Indian cliffs. 
  Once she had looked back and seen the boy, but she had not thought  of  calling him. After a time she knew that she stumbled because she  could  not see, and that an opaque curtain had shut her in until the  lake and  the forest might have been another world. But the night held  no  terrors for her; so she kept on. The lone wolf howled up in the  edge  of the forest; a flight of belated wild fowl whistled over her  head; a  quavering, thrilling cry came nearer and nearer from the  blackness of  the land, the night-wind came colder and stronger; the  bursting of the  lake among tumbled rocks became more and more  tumultuous, but the  little Bannockburn Widow was unmindful of them  all. The Indian cliffs  were ahead. Each step brought her nearer to  them, and each moment she  could see her husband's ship more  distinctly. Now it had ceased its  struggles in the seas; its shattered  remnants lay among the rocks.  Among them she saw human things, some  dripping and creeping, some  drowned and still; and when she thought  that she heard their voices,  crying faintly for help, she stopped and  listened. 
  &quot;Ben!&quot; she called. &quot;Ben! Oh, Ben!&quot; 
  She fancied she heard a reply, and called again. The wolf slunk   farther behind; two little fiery dots that were levelled at her from   the edge of the forest disappeared; the night, too, grew suddenly   quiet, and only the noise of the lake drowned the voices of those   human things staggering up from the wreck in the woman's brain. It   suddenly occurred to her that she must hurry or they would get away   from her. So she ran. When she stopped running she fell. For hours   after that the pictures were gone, the sounds of the night passed   unheard, the lone wolf howled and sniffed almost at her feet, and the   lake lashed itself in futile fury against the face of the Pictured   Rocks. 
  When she awoke, the sun was shining upon her. She did not sense the   passing of time. The night had gone without reckoning, and she began   the search where she had left off, only now there were no human things   creeping and dying in her visions. If a hunter had seen her, he would   have known that she was weak and footsore. But she was not conscious   of hunger or fatigue. Rather than this, a strange content was growing   in her; she had reached the Pictured Rocks. The lake was rolling and   thundering against them, and she knew that very soon she would find   her husband. Hour after hour she went on. She thought that she had   travelled far, but the rocks she had left in the morning were in sight   at noon. Now she seemed much nearer to them. She came to a break in   the great stone cliffs, and down there in the white sand at their base   she thought that she saw men. There was one lying white and naked in   the sun, with the water creeping up about him at every roll of the   lake. She knew now that her search was at an end. 
  &quot;Ben! Ben! Ben!&#8212;&quot; 
  She called aloud in her joy as she half crept, half fell, down  through  the fissure in the cliff. With outstretched arms she stumbled  to the  edge of the beach. The white thing had been drawn back by a  receding  wave, and was just out of her reach. It was an oar. 
  &quot;Ben!&quot; she pleaded. &quot;Ben, my darling!&quot; 
  She waded out to her knees, and met the oar as it came in again.  With  a scream she snatched it and fell with it upon the sand. After a   little she held it out and looked at it, her eyes dazzling in the joy   of triumph. Silently she clutched the thing to her breast and slowly   made her way up the ragged breach in the rocks. It was a tiresome   climb, but she held to her precious burden. When she had reached the   summit she staggered back toward the gloom of the forest, mumbling   incoherently. But through it ran one strain. 
  &quot;Ben&#8212;Ben&#8212;Ben&#8212;Ben&#8212;&quot; 
  That day a coatless, uncovered sailor looked longingly out from the   island that lay just beyond sight of Whitefish Point. It was a   desolate and uninhabited area of drifting sand and ragged pines,   surrounded on all sides by the ugly grey run of the sea. No other   object in the dreary scene betrayed a sign of life. Nearly doubled   under the weight of a bundle clasped in his arms, his feet wrapped in   trailing rags, he stumbled slowly along. His eyes were deep-sunk, his   face starved to the thinness of a death-mask, and he mumbled   incoherently to the bundle he held. Slowly the figure turned and   trailed back among the low, pine-covered sand-dunes, and as it   disappeared, like a tottering old man, another living thing came up   from the edge of the water. It was not unlike the first in the   gauntness of starvation, but this man was naked to the waist and his   feet were bare and bloodstained. He was older, but more powerful, and   as he gazed up to where a shirt fluttered at the top of a dead pine he   showed his teeth in a snarl and cursed. Then he, too, took up the   trail into the dunes. 
  Deep in them and sheltered somewhat from the cold wind of the sea,  the  first man gently laid his bundle down in a shelter made of pine   boughs. As he pulled back the coat he had wrapped about it he smiled,   a ghastly enough smile had it not been for the love-light that shone   in his sunken eyes. The man's movements exposed the face of a sleeping   boy who could not have been more than five years old. He put the coat   back again and turned to the figure approaching through the dunes.   &quot;His-s-st!&quot; he warned, holding up a hand that shook like one of the   pine-cones above him. 
  &quot;T' hell with yer hissin'!&quot; growled the other. &quot;Cap'n, I want th'   grub&#8212;an' I'm damned if I ain't goin' t' have it.&quot; 
  &quot;There isn't any more grub,&quot; said the smaller man. &quot;I gave it all  to  the little one.&quot; 
  He picked up a few dry sticks from the sand and piled them on a  fire  that was burning near the pine-bough shelter. In his companion's  eyes  smouldered a dangerous madness. A few yards from the shelter he  fell  upon his hands and knees and like a hungry animal crawled toward  the  sleeping child. The starving captain staggered to intercept him  and  grovelled upon all fours in his path. 
  &quot;I said there isn't any more!&quot; 
  Like two human creatures in an animal pantomime the men glared,  while  their emaciated faces almost touched. There was a deadly  challenge in  the little man's red eyes. He supported himself on his  knees and one  arm, while the other arm was raised, like a cat's, ready  to scratch at  the yellow, hair-hung visage of the man he defied. 
  After a moment the sailor settled back on his haunches with a   crackling laugh and glanced furtively at a stick just out of reach.   Streaks of blood had dried on his naked chest and arms, and over one   of these he licked his tongue, smacking his lips in an ecstatic   grimace. There was something terribly suggestive in the leering look   of the man as he nodded toward the pine-bough shelter. He came a foot   nearer on his hands and knees, but the captain crouched weakly, his   teeth gleaming like half-drawn ivory knives ready to bury themselves   in human flesh. The other paused again. 
  &quot;Are y' honest, Cap'n?&quot; 
  &quot;Honest as God!&quot; replied the smaller man, and as the other turned  away  again, the captain went back to sit down in front of the  pine-bough  shelter. For a few minutes the half-stripped sailor lay in  the sand,  burying his arms and shivering. Then he crawled up and  huddled close  to the fire. The other suffered in grim silence, staring  out fixedly  against the wilderness of lifeless sand-dunes, and slowly  his reason  slipped beyond his control and the drifted heaps seemed to  take a  thousand fantastic shapes and fill the air until they walled  him in.  After a time they settled again and were peopled with a score  of  romping children, among whom was a rosy boy with a tiny ship  trailing  at the end of a string. Behind them all was a woman, who  smiled over  their heads and down at him. The man crooned and beckoned  to the woman  and the child until something pulled at his arm, and the  sailor crept  between him and his vision. 
  &quot;My Gawd, Cap'n, wake up!&quot; 
  The captain dragged himself back to consciousness with a start. His   first instinct was to crouch back in an attitude of preparedness; his   second to glance hastily in the shelter where the coat-wrapped bundle   still lay as he had placed it. In a vague sort of way he felt that he   had something to fear, and he turned his cavernous eyes in a sullen,   suspicious look at his companion. 
  &quot;I've got a plan,&quot; said the sailor. With a trembling forefinger he   drew a circle in the sand. &quot;We'll both start here&#8212;at the end of th'   island. You go one way, me th' other. Mebby we'll find a clam.&quot; 
  He pulled himself to his feet and stood swaying like a drunken man.   With an effort the captain stood up. He piled a few more sticks on the   fire and then the two men staggered off through the dunes. The little   man's weakness was overpowering. In a moment of delirium he fell upon   the sand and hunted for tracks. &quot;They were here&#8212;they were here&#8212;&quot; he   moaned monotonously. &quot;God&#8212;God&#8212;they were here&#8212;they were here&#8212;&#8212;&quot; He   dug his way up the side of the dune that crumbled away under him as be   kicked and clutched in it with his hands and feet. Again and again he   rolled back exhausted, his eyes and mouth filled with sand. Fighting   his way weakly, inch by inch, he crawled at last to the top of the   dune, and with an unheard cry flung his arms above his head and turned   his gaunt face up to the cold, grey vastness of the sky. Then he   pitched forward and like a dead thing rolled down the other side of   the dune. With a powerful effort he concentrated what was left of his   mind and, at times stumbling along on his feet, at others creeping   upon his hands and knees, toiled through the drifting sand until he   came to the edge of the lake along which the searching sailor was   crawling like a snail. In the west, day was going out in a sickly   yellow gleam. The starving man turned his face toward it and trailed   close down to the water's edge watching hungrily for something that   would give him life. He forgot to measure time as he worked. One   minute&#8212;ten&#8212;an hour passed. He failed to notice that he had made less   than a hundred fathoms. On bleeding hands and knees he still crept   along, resting now and then, sometimes even in the freezing wash of   the sea. The glow burned out of the sky, and now up through the gloom   of the twisting sand-dunes came the sailor. 
  &quot;Nothing&#8212;nothing&#8212;&#8212;&quot; he groaned wearily. &quot;Oh, God,  nothing&#8212;nothing&#8212;  nothing&#8212;&#8212;&quot; 
  The little man stood up beside him and together the two gazed out  upon  the grey waste of water that was dissolving itself in the  gathering  darkness of night. After a moment the captain's chin fell  upon his  chest, and his eyes searched the sand at his feet. Suddenly  he gave a  cry and fell upon his face, sobbing, laughing and raving in  his  madness until the other drew back in horror. For a few moments he  lay  very quiet, and during those moments the captain fought to re-   establish his reason, while with both hands he clutched a tiny mussel   to his breast. When he came to his knees he held the precious shell   out for the sailor to see. The eyes of the latter burned with a   maniacal fire. He approached like a thing half human and fell upon his   companion, tearing and scratching with the viciousness of a eat. &quot;Gi'   me it&#8212;gi' me it!&quot; he cried. 
  The two rolled over and over in sickening combat. The great hands  of  the starving sailor caught at the other's throat and held there  until  the face went black and the captain opened his mouth like a  strangling  fish. By chance he freed himself, and using the clam for a  weapon dug  its sharp edge deep into the sailor's naked chest. Inside  the  captain's shirt was treasured a pistol. In their smothering  embrace he  reached for it, and his arm was pinioned. An instant later  the  sailor's hand came in contact with a small stone and with it he  rained  blow after blow upon the little man's head. Under them the  captain  sank like a dead man and lay crushed beneath the body of his  enemy. He  was conscious of a flow of warm blood pouring over his face  and he  knew that he must be terribly wounded. His hand touched the  revolver  butt and with a supreme effort he twisted the muzzle upward  and  exhausted all of his dying strength in a pull upon the trigger.  There  followed a smothered explosion, and the sailor lurched back and   pressed his hands to his stomach. A moment more and he toppled over   upon the sand, kicking and sobbing in the agonies of death, while the   victor lay very quiet, with blood soaking his hair and beard and   forming a pool under his face. 
  Darkness had fallen thick and cold over the sea when the captain   raised his head. He seemed to be awakened from his death-sleep by the   crying of a child. Groaning, he struggled to rise, and failing in this   he dragged himself foot by foot toward the dead pine from which   floated the signal of distress. That pine had been in his mind for a   day and a night. He had figured that his last duty would be the   sending up of a pillar of flame that might call a ship to his little   son whom he would leave when he died. They had burned a tree each   night. This would be the last. On his stomach he wormed his way toward   it, and again and again he attempted to raise his voice in response to   the wails of the child coming from among the dunes. After a little it   seemed to the wounded man that the sounds were nearer. Frantically he   strove to reach the pine. The light of it would bring to him the only   living thing he had saved from his ship, and he prayed and sobbed in   his weakness as he came nearer and nearer to it. He was bleeding   profusely again and knew that he had only a few minutes more before   him. His last progress was made by inches. At the base of the pine he   had only strength enough left to strike a match and light the pile of   cones. Then he rolled upon his face again as the flames began licking   their way up the resinous tree. 
  Somewhere in the man there rose and battled the last call to life.  It  struggled with his desire to die, and conquered by bringing him  back  into the agony of existence. He heard the crackling of flames  over his  head much as he might have listened to the murmuring of the  sea on a  peaceful night of a happier day. He possessed no fear, no  pain, and  his one desire was that he might rest in peace. But the  spirit of life  dragged him out of the valley of contentment and opened  his ears again  to the crying of the child. His consciousness found him  in a blaze of  light. The pine was a roaring torch reaching up a  hundred feet in the  air. Its heat had burned his face and scorched his  hair, but this gave  him no additional pain. He was almost sightless,  but life gave him  power to see the child. More like a wounded animal  than a man he  dragged himself toward his son. In terror the boy saw  the strange  thing approaching in the fiery glare, and his screams of  fear brought  reason back into the captain's brain. He stopped, and  gasped out a cry  that sent warm blood trickling down his face. A final  tremendous  effort brought him to his feet, an unhearing, unseeing  creature  struggling with the death-grip, and praying for a few moments  more. He  staggered on and on until he knew that he had been recognized  and that  the terror-stricken child was running into his arms. Then he   collapsed. In one hand the man still clutched the precious clam. He   opened it now with his teeth and gave it to the child. He tried to   speak, but the life of his tongue seemed gone. 
  The captain turned his face once more to the sea. The lights of a  ship  were coming up out of the naked vastness of Superior. He lay down   quietly and passed into a deep trance, and when the men came they   found him with the little breathing thing at his side, cold in the   slumber from which no man awakes. 
  Two graves were soon made, but there were none to identify either  the  occupants or the little child. Eventually the rescuers learned  from  the boy that his name was &quot;Jim,&quot; but where he lived or who he  might be  remained unknown. So when Captain Falkner left the little  waif at an  orphanage on the Erie shore the boy was registered as James  Falkner&#8212;  lacking a better name&#8212;and his relatives believed him to  have perished  with his father on the Bannockburn.
