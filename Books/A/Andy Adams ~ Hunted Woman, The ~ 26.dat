  They rode on into the Valley of Gold. Again MacDonald took the lead,  and he rode straight into the face of the black mountain. Aldous no  longer made an effort to keep Joanne in ignorance of what might be  ahead of them. He put a sixth cartridge into the chamber of his rifle,  and carried the weapon across the pommel of his saddle. He explained to  her now why they were riding behind&#8212;that if their enemies were laying  in wait for them, MacDonald, alone, could make a swift retreat. Joanne  asked no questions. Her lips were set tight. She was pale.
  At the end of three quarters of an hour it seemed to them that  MacDonald was riding directly into the face of a wall of rock. Then he  swung sharply to the left, and disappeared. When they came to the point  where he had turned they found that he had entered a concealed break in  the mountain&#8212;a chasm with walls that rose almost perpendicular for a  thousand feet above their heads. A dark and solemn gloom pervaded this  chasm, and Aldous drew nearer to MacDonald, his rifle held in  readiness, and his bridle-rein fastened to his saddle-horn. The chasm  was short. Sunlight burst upon them suddenly, and a few minutes later  MacDonald waited for them again.
  Even Aldous could not restrain an exclamation of surprise when he  rode up with Joanne. Under them was another valley, a wide-sweeping  valley between two rugged ranges that ran to the southwest. Up out of  it there came to their ears a steady, rumbling roar; the air was filled  with that roar; the earth seemed to tremble with it under their  feet&#8212;and yet it was not loud. It came sullenly, as if from a great  distance.
  And then they saw that MacDonald was not looking out over the sweep  of the valley, but down. Half a mile under them there was a dip&#8212;a  valley within a valley&#8212;and through it ran the silver sheen of a  stream. MacDonald spoke no word now. He dismounted and levelled his  long telescope at the little valley. Aldous helped Joanne from her  horse, and they waited. A great breath came at last from the old  hunter. Slowly he turned. He did not give the telescope to Aldous, but  to Joanne. She looked. For a full minute she seemed scarcely to  breathe. Her hands trembled when she turned to give the glass to  Aldous.
  &#8220;I see&#8212;log cabins!&#8221; she whispered.
  MacDonald placed a detaining hand on her arm.
  &#8220;Look ag'in&#8212;Joanne,&#8221; he said in a low voice that had in it a  curious quiver.
  Again she raised the telescope to her eyes.
  &#8220;You see the little cabin&#8212;nearest the river?&#8221; whispered Donald.
  &#8220;Yes, I see it.&#8221;
  &#8220;That was our cabin&#8212;Jane's an' mine&#8212;forty years ago,&#8221; he said, and  now his voice was husky.
  Joanne's breath broke sobbingly as she gave Aldous the glass.  Something seemed to choke him as he looked down upon the scene of the  grim tragedy in which Donald MacDonald and Jane had played their fatal  part. He saw the cabins as they had stood for nearly half a century.  There were four. Three of them were small, and the fourth was large.  They might have been built yesterday, for all that he could see of ruin  or decay. The doors and windows of the larger cabin and two of the  smaller ones were closed. The roofs were unbroken. The walls appeared  solid. Twice he looked at the fourth cabin, with its wide-open door and  window, and twice he looked at the cabin nearest the stream, where had  lived Donald MacDonald and Jane.
  Donald had moved, and Joanne was watching him tensely, when he took  the glass from his eyes. Mutely the old mountaineer held out a hand,  and Aldous gave him the telescope. Crouching behind a rock he slowly  swept the valley. For half an hour he looked through the glass, and in  that time scarce a word was spoken. During the last five minutes of  that half-hour both Joanne and Aldous knew that MacDonald was looking  at the little cabin nearest the stream, and with hands clasped tightly  they waited in silence.
  At last old Donald rose, and his face and voice were filled with a  wonderful calm.
  &#8220;There ain't been no change,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;I can see the log in  front o' the door that I used to cut kindling on. It was too tough for  them to split an' burn after we left. An' I can see the tub I made out  o' spruce for Jane. It's leaning next the door, where I put it the day  before we went away. Forty years ain't very long, Johnny! It ain't very  long!&#8221;
  Joanne had turned from them, and Aldous knew that she was crying.
  &#8220;An' we've beat 'em to it, Johnny&#8212;we've beat 'em to it!&#8221; exulted  MacDonald. &#8220;There ain't a sign of life in the valley, and we sure could  make it out from here if there was!&#8221;
  He climbed into his saddle, and started down the slope of the  mountain. Aldous went to Joanne. She was sobbing. Her eyes were blinded  by tears.
  &#8220;It's terrible, terrible,&#8221; she whispered brokenly. &#8220;And it&#8212;it's  beautiful, John. I feel as though I'd like to give my life&#8212;to bring  Jane back!&#8221;
  &#8220;You must not betray tears or grief to Donald,&#8221; said Aldous, drawing  her close in his arms for a moment. &#8220;Joanne&#8212;sweetheart&#8212;it is a  wonderful thing that is happening with him! I dreaded this day&#8212;I have  dreaded it for a long time. I thought that it would be terrible to  witness the grief of a man with a heart like Donald's. But he is not  filled with grief, Joanne. It is joy, a great happiness that perhaps  neither you nor I can understand&#8212;that has come to him now. Don't you  understand? He has found her. He has found their old home. To-day is  the culmination of forty years of hope, and faith, and prayer. And it  does not bring him sorrow, but gladness. We must rejoice with him. We  must be happy with him. I love you, Joanne. I love you above all else  on earth or in heaven. Without you I would not want to live. And yet,  Joanne, I believe that I am no happier to-day than is Donald  MacDonald!&#8221;
  With a sudden cry Joanne flung her arms about his neck.
  &#8220;John, is it<I> that?</I>&#8221; she cried, and joy shone through her  tears. &#8220;Yes, yes, I understand now! His heart is not breaking. It is  life returning into a heart that was empty. I understand&#8212;oh, I  understand now! And we must be happy with him. We must be happy when we  find the cavern&#8212;and Jane!&#8221;
  &#8220;And when we go down there to the little cabin that was their home.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;yes!&#8221;
  They followed behind MacDonald. After a little a spur of the  mountain-side shut out the little valley from them, and when they  rounded this they found themselves very near to the cabins. They rode  down a beautiful slope into the basin, and when he reached the log  buildings old Donald stopped and dismounted. Again Aldous helped Joanne  from her horse. Ahead of them MacDonald went to the cabin nearest the  stream. At the door he paused and waited for them.
  &#8220;Forty years!&#8221; he said, facing them. &#8220;An' there ain't been so very  much change as I can see!&#8221;
  Years had dropped from his shoulders in these last few minutes, and  even Aldous could not keep quite out of his face his amazement and  wonder. Very gently Donald put his hand to the latch, as though fearing  to awaken some one within; and very gently he pressed down on it, and  put a bit of his strength against the door. It moved inward, and when  it had opened sufficiently he leaned forward so that his head and a  half of his shoulders were inside; and he looked&#8212;a long time he  looked, without a movement of his body or a breath that they could see.
  And then he turned to them again, and his eyes were shining as they  had never seen them shine before.
  &#8220;I'll open the window,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It's dark&#8212;dark inside.&#8221;
  He went to the window, which was closed with a sapling barricade  that had swung on hinges; and when he swung it back the rusted hinges  gave way, and the thing crashed down at his feet. And now through the  open window the sun poured in a warm radiance, and Donald entered the  cabin, with Joanne and Aldous close behind him.
  There was not much in the cabin, but what it held was earth, and  heaven, and all else to Donald MacDonald. A strange, glad cry surged  from his chest as he looked about him, and now Joanne saw and  understood what John Aldous had told her&#8212;for Donald MacDonald, after  forty years, had come back to his home!
  &#8220;Oh, my Gawd, Johnny, they didn't touch anything! They didn't touch  anything!&#8221; he breathed in ecstasy. &#8220;I thought after we ran away they'd  come in&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He broke off, and his hat dropped from his hand, and he stood and  stared; and what he was looking at, the sun fell upon in a great golden  splash, and Joanne's hand gripped John's, and held to it tightly.  Against the wall, hanging as they had hung for forty years, were a  woman's garments: a hood, a shawl, a dress, and an apron that was half  in tatters; and on the floor under these things were<I> a pair of shoes</I>. And as Donald MacDonald went to them, his arms reaching out, his lips  moving, forgetful of all things but that he had come home, and Jane was  here, Joanne drew Aldous softly to the door, and they went out into the  day.
  Joanne did not speak, and Aldous did not urge her. He saw her white  throat throbbing as if there were a little heart beating there, and her  eyes were big and dark and velvety, like the eyes of a fawn that had  been frightened. There was a thickness in his own throat, and he found  that it was difficult for him to see far out over the plain. They  waited near the horses. Fifty yards from them ran the stream; a clear,  beautiful stream which flowed in the direction from which the  mysterious ramble of thunder seemed to come. This, Aldous knew, was the  stream of gold. In the sand he saw wreckage which he knew were the  ancient rockers; a shovel, thrust shaft-deep, still remained where it  had last been planted.
  Perhaps for ten minutes Donald MacDonald remained in the cabin. Then  he came out. Very carefully he closed the door. His shoulders were  thrown back. His head was held high. He looked like a monarch.
  And his voice was calm.
  &#8220;Everything is there, Johnny&#8212;everything but the gold,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;They took that.&#8221;
  Now he spoke to Joanne.
  &#8220;You better not go with us into the other cabins,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked softly.
  &#8220;Because&#8212;there's death in them all.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am going,&#8221; she said.
  From the window of the largest cabin MacDonald pulled the sapling  shutter, and, like the other, it fell at his feet. Then they opened the  door, and entered; and here the sunlight revealed the cabin's ghastly  tragedy. The first thing that they saw, because it was most terrible,  was a rough table, half over which lay the shrunken thing that had once  been a man. A part of its clothes still remained, but the head had  broken from its column, and the white and fleshless skull lay facing  them. Out of tattered and dust-crumbling sleeves reached the naked  bones of hands and arms. And on the floor lay another of these things,  in a crumpled and huddled heap, only the back of the skull showing,  like the polished pate of a bald man. These things they saw first, and  then two others: on the table were a heap of age-blackened and dusty  sacks, and out of the back of the crumbling thing that guarded them  stuck the long buckhorn hilt of a knife.
  &#8220;They must ha' died fighting,&#8221; said MacDonald. &#8220;An' there, Johnny,  is their gold!&#8221;
  White as death Joanne stood in the door and watched them. MacDonald  and Aldous went to the sacks. They were of buckskin. The years had not  aged them. When Aldous took one in his hands he found that it was  heavier than lead. With his knife MacDonald cut a slit in one of them,  and the sun that came through the window flashed in a little golden  stream that ran from the bag.
  &#8220;We'll take them out and put 'em in a pannier,&#8221; said MacDonald. &#8220;The  others won't be far behind us, Johnny.&#8221;
  Between them they carried out the seven sacks of gold. It was a load  for their arms. They put it in one of the panniers, and then MacDonald  nodded toward the cabin next the one that had been his own.
  &#8220;I wouldn't go in there, Joanne,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I'm going,&#8221; she whispered again.
  &#8220;It was<I> their</I> cabin&#8212;the man an' his wife,&#8221; persisted old  Donald. &#8220;An' the men was beasts, Joanne! I don't know what happened in  there&#8212;but I guess.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm going,&#8221; she said again.
  MacDonald pulled down the barricade from the window&#8212;a window that  also faced the south and west, and this time he had to thrust against  the door with his shoulder. They entered, and now a cry came from  Joanne's lips&#8212;a cry that had in it horror, disbelief, a woman's wrath.  Against the wall was a pile of something, and on that pile was the  searching first light of day that had fallen upon it for nearly half a  century. The pile was a man crumpled down; across it, her skeleton arms  thrown about it protectingly, was a woman. This time Aldous did not go  forward. MacDonald was alone, and Aldous took Joanne from the cabin,  and held her while she swayed in his arms. Donald came out a little  later, and there was a curious look of exultation and triumph in his  face.
  &#8220;She killed herself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was her husband. I know him. I  gave him the rock-nails he put in the soles of his boots&#8212;and the nails  are still there.&#8221;
  He went alone into the remaining two cabins, while Aldous stood with  Joanne. He did not stay long. From the fourth cabin he brought an  armful of the little brown sacks. He returned, and brought a second  armful.
  &#8220;There's three more in that last cabin,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Two men, an'  a woman. She must ha' been the wife of the man they killed. They were  the last to live, an' they starved to death. An' now, Johnny&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He paused, and he drew in a great breath.
  He was looking to the west, where the sun was beginning to sink  behind the mountains.
  &#8220;An' now, Johnny, if you're ready, an' if Joanne is ready, we'll  go,&#8221; he said.
