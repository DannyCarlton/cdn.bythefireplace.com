The immediate consequences of Hamilton's Report were a rise of fifty per  cent in the securities of the bankrupt Confederation, and a bitter  warfare in Congress. All were agreed upon the propriety of paying the  foreign loan, but the battle raged about every other point in turn. One  of the legacies of the old Congress was the principle of repudiating  what it was not convenient to redeem, and the politicians of the country  had insensibly fallen into the habit of assuming that they should start  clear with the new government, and relegate the domestic debt to the  limbo which held so many other resources best forgotten. They were far  from admitting the full measure of their inheritance, however, and  opened the battle with a loud denouncement of the greedy speculator who  had defrauded the impoverished soldier, to whose needs they had been  indifferent hitherto. Most of this feeling concentrated in the  opposition, but many Federalists were so divided upon the question of  discrimination that for a time the other great questions contained in  the Report fell back. Feeling became so bitter that those who supported  the assignees were accused of speculation, and personalities were hot  and blistering. Many of the strongest men, however, ranged with  Hamilton, and were in sight of victory, when Madison, who had hoped to  see the question settle itself in favour of the original holders without  his open support, came out with a double bomb; the first symptom of his  opposition to the Federal party, and an unconstitutional proposition  that the holders by assignment should receive the highest market-price  yet reached by the certificates, by which they would reap no  inconsiderable profit, and that the balance of the sum due, possibly  more than one-half, should be distributed among the original holders.  For a time the reputation for statemanship which Madison had won was  clouded, for his admission of the claims of the assignees nullified any  argument he could advance in favour of the original holders. But he had  his limitations. There was nothing of the business man in his  composition. One of the most notable and useful attributes of Hamilton's  versatile brain was excluded from his, beyond its comprehension. His  proposition was rejected by thirty-six votes to thirteen.    
Then the hostile camps faced each other on the questions of the domestic  debt and assumption. In regard to the former, common decency finally  prevailed, but the other threatened to disrupt the Union, for the  Eastern States threw out more than one hint of secession did the measure  fail. Madison, without further subterfuge, came forth at the head of  his State as the leader of the anti-assumptionists. He offered no  explanation to his former chief and none was demanded. For a time  Hamilton was bitterly disgusted and wounded. He shrugged his shoulders,  finally, and accepted his new enemy with philosophy, though by no means  with amiability and forgiveness; but he had seen too much of the  selfishness and meanness of human nature to remain pained or astonished  at any defection.    
When June came, however, he was deeply uneasy. On March 29th the  resolutions providing for the foreign debt and for paying in full the  principal of the domestic debt to the present holders passed without a  division. So did the resolution in favour of paying the arrears of  interest in like manner with the principal of the domestic debt. But the  resolution in favour of assumption was recommitted. The next day the  friends of assumption had the other resolutions also recommitted, and  the furious battle raged again. Finally, on June 2d, a bill was passed  by the House, which left the question of assumption to be settled by a  future test of strength.    
The anti-assumptionists were triumphant, for they believed the idea  would gain in unpopularity. But they reckoned without Hamilton.
