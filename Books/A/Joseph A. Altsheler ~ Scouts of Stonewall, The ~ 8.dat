  General Jackson and several of his senior officers were examining  the  valley with glasses, but Harry, with eyes trained to the open air  and  long distances, could see clearly nearly all that was going on  below.  He saw movement among the masses of men in blue, and he saw  officers on  horseback, galloping along the banks of the river.  Then  he saw cannon in  trenches with their muzzles elevated toward the  heights, and he knew that  the Union troops must have had warning of  Jackson's coming.  And he saw,  too, that the officers below also had  glasses through which they were  looking. 
  There was a sudden blaze from the mouth of one of the cannon.  A  shell  shot upward, whistling and shrieking, and burst far above their  heads.  Harry heard pieces of falling metal striking on the rocks  behind them.  The mountains sent back the cannon's roar in a sinister  echo. 
  A second gun flashed and again the shell curved over their heads.   But Jackson paid no heed.  He was still watching intently through his   glasses. 
  &#8220;The enemy is up and alert,&#8221; whispered St. Clair to Harry.  &#8220;I  judge that  these are Western men used to sleeping with their eyes  open.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Like as not a lot of them are mountain West Virginians,&#8221; said  Harry.  &#8220;They are strong for the North, and it's likely, too, that  they're the  men who have discovered Jackson's advance.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And they mean to make it warm for us.  Listen to those guns!  It's  hard  shooting aiming at men on heights, but it shows what they could  do on  level ground.&#8221; 
  Jackson presently retired with his officers, and Harry, parting  from his  friends of the Invincibles, went with him.  Back among the  ridges all the  troops were under arms, the weary ones having risen  from their blankets  which were now tied in rolls on their backs.  They  had not yet been able  to bring the artillery up the steeps.  Harry saw  that the faces of all  were eager as they heard the thunder of the guns  in the valley below.  Among the most eager was a regiment of Georgians  arrived but recently  with the reinforcements. 
  Many of the men, speaking from the obscurity of the crowded ranks,   did not scorn to hurl questions at their officers. 
  &#8220;Are we goin' to fight the Yankees at last?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'd rather take my chances with the bullets than march any more.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Lead us down an' give us a chance at 'em.&#8221; 
  Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire  were  among the officers who had gone with Jackson to the verge of the  cliff,  and now when they heard the impertinent but eager questions  from the  massed ranks they looked at each other and smiled.  It was  not according  to West Point, but these were recruits and here was  enthusiasm which was  a pearl beyond price. 
  General Jackson beckoned to Harry and three other young staff  officers. 
  &#8220;Take glasses,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go back to the verge of the cliff, and  watch  for movements on the part of the enemy.  If any is made be sure  that you  see it, and report it to me at once.&#8221; 
  The words were abrupt, sharp, admitting of no question or delay,  and the  four fairly ran.  Harry and his comrades lay down at the edge  of the  cliff and swept the valley with their glasses.  The great guns  were still  firing at intervals of about a minute.  The gunners could  not see the  Southern troops drawn back behind the ridges, but Harry  believed that  they might be guided by signals from men on opposite  slopes.  But if  signalmen were there they were hidden by the forest  even from his glasses. 
  The smoke from the cannon was gathering heavily in the narrow  valley,  so heavily that it began to obscure what was passing there in  the  Northern army.  But the four, remembering the injunction of  Jackson,  a man who must be obeyed to the last and minutest detail,  still sought to  pierce through the smoke both with the naked eye and  with glasses.  As a rift appeared Harry saw a moving mass of men in  blue.  It was a  great body of troops and the sun shining through the  rift glittered over  bayonets and rifle barrels.  They were marching  straight toward a slope  which led at a rather easy grade up the side  of the mountain. 
  &#8220;They're not waiting to be attacked!  They're attacking!&#8221; cried  Harry,  springing to his feet and running to the point where he knew  Jackson  stood.  Jackson received his news, looked for himself, and  then began to  push on the troops.  A shout arose as the army pressed  forward to meet  the enemy who were coming so boldly. 
  &#8220;We ought to beat 'em, as we have the advantage of the heights,&#8221;   exclaimed Sherburne, who was now on foot. 
  But the advantage was the other way.  Those were staunch troops who  were  advancing, men of Ohio and West Virginia, and while they were yet  on the  lower slopes their cannon, firing over their heads, swept the  crest with  shot and shell.  The eager Southern youths, as invariably  happens with  those firing downward, shot too high.  The Northern  regiments now opening  with their rifles and taking better aim came on  in splendid order. 
  &#8220;What a magnificent charge!&#8221; Harry heard Sherburne exclaim. 
  The rifles by thousands were at work, and the unceasing crash sent  echoes  far through the mountains.  The Southerners at the edge of the  cliff were  cut down by the fire of their enemy from below.  Their loss  was now far  greater than that of the North, and their officers sought  to draw them  back from the verge, to a ridge where they could receive  the charge,  just as it reached the crest and pour into them their full  fire.  The  eager young regiment from Georgia refused to obey. 
  &#8220;Have we come all these hundreds of miles from Georgia to run  before  Yankees?&#8221; they cried, and stood there pulling trigger at the  enemy,  while their own men fell fast before the bitter Northern hail. 
  Harry, too, was forced to admire the great resolution and courage  with  which the Northern troops came upward, but he turned away to be  ready for  any command that Jackson might give him.  The general stood  by a rock  attentively watching the fierce battle that was going on,  but not yet  giving any order.  But Harry fancied that he saw his eyes  glisten as he  beheld the ardor of his troops. 
  A detachment of Virginians, posted in the rear, seeing a break in  the  first line, rushed forward without orders, filled the gap and came  face  to face with the men in blue.  Harry thought he saw Jackson's  eyes  glisten again, but he was not sure. 
  The crash of the battle increased fast.  The Southern troops had no   artillery, but as the Northern charge came nearer the crest their  bullets  ceased to fly over the heads of their enemies, but struck now  in the  ranks.  The ridges were enveloped in fire and smoke.  A fresh  Southern  regiment was thrown in and the valiant Northern charge broke.   The brave  men of Ohio and West Virginia, although they fought  desperately and  encouraged one another to stand fast, were forced  slowly back down the  slope. 
  Harry and a half dozen others beside him heard Jackson say,  apparently to  himself, &#8220;The battle will soon be over.&#8221;  Harry knew  instinctively that  it was true.  He had got into the habit of  believing every thing Jackson  said.  The end came in fifteen minutes  more, and with it came the night. 
  The soldiers in their ardor had not noticed that the long shadows  were  creeping over the mountains.  The sun had already sunk in a  blood-red  blur behind the ridges, and as the men in blue slowly  yielded the last  slope darkness which was already heavy in the defiles  and ravines swept  down over the valley. 
  Jackson had won, but his men had suffered heavily and moreover he  had  stood on the defense.  He could not descend into the valley in the  face  of the Northern resistance which was sure to be fierce and  enduring.  The Northern cannon were beginning to send curving shells  again over the  cliffs, sinister warnings of what the Virginians might  expect if they  came down to attack.  Harry and the other staff  officers peering over the  crest saw many fires burning along the banks  of the river.  Milroy seemed  to be still bidding Jackson defiance. 
  Harry saw no preparations for a return assault.  Jackson was  inspecting  the ground, but his men were going over the field gathering  up the  wounded and burying the dead.  The Georgians had suffered  terribly&#8212;most  of all&#8212;for their rash bravery, and the whole army was  subdued.  There  was less of exuberant youth, and more of grim and  silent resolve. 
  Harry worked far into the night carrying orders here and there.   The moon  came out and clothed the strange and weird battlefield in a  robe of  silver.  The heavens were sown with starshine, but it all  seemed mystic  and unreal to the excited nerves of the boy.  The  mountains rose to two,  three times their real height, and the valley  in which the Northern fires  burned became a mighty chasm. 
  It was one o'clock in the morning before Jackson himself left the  field  and went to his headquarters at a little farmhouse on the  plateau.  His faithful colored servant was waiting for him with food.   He had not  touched any the whole day, but he declined it saying that  he needed  nothing but sleep.  He flung himself booted and clothed upon  a bed and  was sound asleep in five minutes. 
  There was a little porch on one side of the house, and here Harry,   who had received no instructions from his general, camped.  He rolled   himself in his cavalry cloak, lay down on the hard floor which was not   hard to him, and slept like a little child. 
  He was awakened at dawn as one often is by a presence, even though  that  presence be noiseless.  He felt a great unwillingness to get up.   That  was a good floor on which he slept, and the cavalry cloak  wrapped around  him was the finest and warmest that he had ever felt.   He did not wish to  abandon either.  But will triumphed.  He opened  his eyes and sprang  quickly to his feet. 
  Stonewall Jackson was standing beside him looking intently toward  the  valley.  The edge of a blazing sun barely showed in the east, and  in the  west all the peaks and ridges were yet in the dusk.  Morning  was coming  in silence.  There was no sound of battle or of the voices  of men. 
  &#8220;I beg your pardon.  I fear that I have overslept myself!&#8221;  exclaimed  Harry. 
  &#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Jackson with a slight smile.  &#8220;The others of the  staff  are yet asleep.  You might have come inside.  A little room was  left on  the floor there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I never had a better bed and I never slept better.&#8221;  The general  smiled  again and gave Harry an approving glance. 
  &#8220;Soldiers, especially boys, learn quickly to endure any kind of  hardship,&#8221;  he said.  &#8220;Come, we'll see if the enemy is still there.&#8221; 
  Harry fancied from his tone that he believed Milroy gone, but  knowing  better than to offer any opinion of his own he followed him  toward the  edge of the valley.  The pickets saluted as the silent  figures passed.  The sun in the east was rising higher over the valley,  and in the west  the peaks and ridges were coming out of the dusk. 
  The general carried his glasses slung over his shoulder, but he did  not  need them.  One glance into the valley and they saw that the army  of  Milroy was gone.  It had disappeared, horse, foot and guns, and  Harry now  knew that the long row of camp fires in the night had been a  show,  but only a brave show, after all. 
  The whole Southern army awoke and poured down the slopes.  Yes,  Milroy,  not believing that he was strong enough for another battle,  had gone down  the valley.  He had fought one good battle, but he would  reach Banks  before he fought another. 
  The Southern troops felt that they had won the victory, and Jackson  sent  a message to Richmond announcing it.  Never had news come at a  more  opportune time.  The fortunes of the South seemed to be at the  lowest  ebb.  Richmond had heard of the great battle of Shiloh, the  failure to  destroy Grant and the death of Albert Sidney Johnston.  New  Orleans,  the largest and richest city in the Confederacy, had been  taken by the  Northern fleet&#8212;the North was always triumphant on the  water&#8212;and the  mighty army of McClellan had landed on the Peninsula of  Virginia for the  advance on Richmond. 
  It had seemed that the South was doomed, and the war yet scarcely a  year  old.  But in the mountains the strange professor of mathematics  had  struck a blow and he might strike another.  Both North and South  realized  anew that no one could ever tell where he was or what he  might do.  The great force, advancing by land to co-operate with  McClellan,  hesitated, and drew back. 
  But Jackson's troops knew nothing then of what was passing in the  minds  of men at Washington and Richmond.  They were following Milroy  and that  commander, wily as well as brave, was pressing his men to the  utmost in  order that he might escape the enemy who, he was sure, would  pursue with  all his power.  He knew that he had fought with Stonewall  Jackson and he  knew the character of the Southern leader. 
  Sherburne brought his horses through a defile into the valley and  his men,  now mounted, led the pursuit.  Jackson in his eagerness rode  with him and  Harry was there, too.  Behind them came the famous foot  cavalry.  Thus  pursuer and pursued rolled down the valley, and Harry  exulted when he  looked at the path of the fleeing army.  The traces  were growing fresher  and fresher.  Jackson was gaining. 
  But there were shrewd minds in Milroy's command.  The Western men  knew  many devices of battle and the trail, and Milroy was desperately  bent  upon saving his force, which he knew would be overwhelmed, if  overtaken  by Jackson's army.  Now he had recourse to a singular  device. 
  Harry, riding with Captain Sherburne, noticed that the trees were  dry  despite the recent rains.  On the slopes of the mountains the  water ran  off fast, and the thickets were dry also.  Then he saw a red  light in the  forest in front of them.  General Jackson saw it at the  same time. 
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  &#8220;It looks like a forest fire, general,&#8221; replied Sherburne. 
  &#8220;You're right, captain, and it's growing.&#8221; 
  As they galloped forward they saw the red light expand rapidly and  spread  directly across their path.  The whole forest was on fire.   Great flames  rose up the trunks of trees and leaped from bough to  bough.  Sparks flew  in millions and vast clouds of smoke, picked up by  the wind, were whirled  in their faces. 
  The troop of cavalry was compelled to pause and General Jackson,  brushing  the smoke from his eyes, said: 
  &#8220;Clever! very clever!  Milroy has put a fiery wall between us.&#8221; 
  The device was a complete success.  The pursuing men in gray could  pass  around the fire at points, and wait at other points for it to  burn out,  but they lost so much time that their cavalry were able only  to skirmish  with the Northern rear guard.  Then when night came on  Milroy escaped  under cover of the thick and smoky darkness. 
  Harry slept on the ground that night, but the precious cloak was  around  him.  He slept beyond the dawn as the pursuit was now  abandoned, but when  he arose smoke was still floating over the valley  and the burned forests.  He was stiff and sore, but the fierce hunger  that assailed him made him  forget the aching of his bones.  He had  eaten nothing for thirty-six  hours.  He had forgotten until then that  there was such a thing as food.  But the sight of Langdon holding a  piece of frying bacon on a stick  afflicted him with a raging desire. 
  &#8220;Give me that bacon, Tom,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;or I'll set the rest of the  forest  on fire!&#8221; 
  &#8220;No need, you old war-horse.  I was just bringing it to you.   There's  plenty more where this came from.  The foot cavalry took it  at McDowell,  and like the wise boys they are brought it on with them.   Come and join  us.  Your general is already riding a bit up the  valley, and, as he  didn't call you, it follows that he doesn't want  you.&#8221; 
  Harry followed him gladly.  The Invincibles had found a good place,   and were cooking a solid breakfast.  They had bacon and ham and coffee   and bread in abundance, and for a while there was a great eating and   drinking. 
  To youth which had marched and fought without food it was not a   breakfast.  It was a banquet and a feast.  Young frames which recover   quickly responded at once.  Now and then, the musical clatter of iron   spoons and knives on iron cups and plates was broken by deep sighs of   satisfaction.  But they did not speak for a while.  There was lost  time  to be made up, and they did not know when they would get another  such  chance&#8212;the odds were always against it. 
  &#8220;Enough is enough,&#8221; said Langdon at last.  &#8220;It took a lot to make  enough,  but it's enough.  You have to be a soldier, Harry, to  appreciate what it  is to eat, sleep and rest.  I'm willing to wager my  uniform against a  last winter's snowball that we don't get another  such meal in a month.  Old Jack won't let us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;To my mind,&#8221; said St. Clair, &#8220;we're going right into the middle of  big  things.  We've chased the Yankees out of the mountains into the  valley,  and we'll follow hot on their heels.  We've already learned  enough of  General Jackson to know that he doesn't linger.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Linger!&#8221; exclaimed Langdon indignantly.  &#8220;Even if there was no  fighting  to be done he'd march us from one end of the valley to the  other just to  keep us in practice.  Hear that bugle!  Off we go!  Five  minutes to get  ready!  Or maybe it is only three!&#8221; 
  It was more than five minutes, but not much more, when the whole  army was  on the march again, but the foot cavalry forgot to grumble  when they came  again into their beloved valley, across which, and up  and down which,  they had marched so much. 
  They threw back their shoulders, their gait became more jaunty and  they  burst into cheers, at the sight of the rich rolling country, now  so  beautiful in spring's heavy green.  Far off the mountains rose,  dark and  blue, but they were only the setting for the gem and made it  more  precious. 
  &#8220;It's ours,&#8221; said Sherburne proudly to Harry.  &#8220;We left it to the  Yankees  for a little while, but we've come back to claim it, and if  the unbidden  tenant doesn't get out at once we'll put him out.  Harry,  haven't you got  Virginia kinfolks?  We want to adopt you and call you  a Virginian.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Lots of them.  My great-grandfather, Governor Ware, was born in  Maryland,  but all the people on my mother's side were of Virginia  origin.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I might have known it.  Kentucky is the daughter of Virginia  though a  large part of Kentucky takes sides with the Yankees.  But  that's not your  fault.  Remember, for the time being you're a  Virginian, one of us by  right of blood and deed.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Count me among 'em at once,&#8221; said Harry.  He felt a certain pride  in  this off-hand but none the less real adoption, because he knew that  it  was a great army with which he marched, and it might immortalize  itself. 
  &#8220;What's the news, Harry?&#8221; asked Sherburne.  &#8220;You're always near Old  Jack,  and if he lets anything come from under that old hat of his,  which isn't  often, it's because he's willing for it to be known.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He's said this, and he doesn't mean it to be any secret.  Banks is  at  Strasburg with a big army, but he's fortified himself there and he   doesn't know just what to do.  He doesn't for the life of him know  which  way Jackson is coming, nor do I.  But I do know that Ewell with  his  division is going to join us at last and we'll have a sizable  army.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And that means bigger things!&#8221; exclaimed Sherburne, joyously.   &#8220;Between  you and me, Harry, Banks won't sleep soundly again for many  a night!&#8221; 
  As they marched on the valley people came out joyously to meet  them.  Even women and girls on horseback, galloping, reined in their  horses to  tell them where the Union forces lay.  Always they had  information for  Jackson, never any for the North.  Here scouts and  spies were scarcely  needed by the Southern army.  Before night  Stonewall Jackson knew as much  of his enemy as any general needed to  know. 
  They camped at dusk and Langdon, contrary to his prediction,  enjoyed  another ample meal and plenty of rest.  Jackson allowed no  tent to be set  for himself.  The night was warm and beautiful and the  songs of birds  came from the trees.  The general had eaten sparingly,  and now he sat on  a log in deep thought.  Presently he looked up and  said: 
  &#8220;Lieutenant Kenton, do you and Lieutenant Dalton ride forward in  that  direction and meet General Ewell.  He is coming, with his staff,  to see  me.  Escort him to the camp.&#8221; 
  He pointed out the direction and in an instant Harry and Dalton,  also of  the staff, were in the camp, following the line of that  pointing finger.  They had the password and as they passed a little  beyond the pickets they  saw a half dozen horsemen riding rapidly  toward them in the dusk. 
  &#8220;General Ewell, is it not, sir?&#8221; said Harry, as he and Dalton gave  the  salute. 
  &#8220;I'm General Ewell,&#8221; replied the foremost horseman.  &#8220;Do you come  from  General Jackson?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.  His camp is just before you.  You can see the lights  now.  He has directed us to meet you and escort you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then lead the way.&#8221; 
  The two young lieutenants, guiding General Ewell and his staff,  were soon  inside Jackson's camp, but Harry had time to observe Ewell  well.  He had  already heard of him as a man of great vigor and daring.   He had made a  name for judgment and dash in the Indian wars on the  border.  Men spoke  of him as a soldier, prompt to obey his superior  and ready to take  responsibility if his superior were not there.   Harry knew that Jackson  expected much of him. 
  He saw a rather slender man with wonderfully bright eyes that  smiled much,  a prominent and pronounced nose and a strong chin.  When  he took off his  hat at the meeting with Jackson he disclosed a round  bald head, which he  held on one side when he talked. 
  Jackson had risen from the log as Ewell rode up and leaped from his   magnificent horse&#8212;his horses were always of the best&#8212;and he  advanced,  stretching out his hand.  Ewell clasped it and the two  talked.  The  staffs of the two generals had withdrawn out of ear shot,  but Harry  noticed that Ewell did much the greater part of the talking,  his head  cocked on one side in that queer, striking manner.  But Harry  knew, too,  that the mind and will of Jackson were dominant, and that  Ewell readily  acknowledged them as so. 
  The conference did not last long.  Then the two generals shook  hands  again and Ewell sprang upon his horse.  Jackson beckoned to  Harry. 
  &#8220;Lieutenant Kenton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;ride with General Ewell to his camp.   You will then know the way well, and he may wish to send me some quick   dispatch.&#8221; 
  Harry, nothing loath, was in the saddle in an instant, and at the  wish of  General Ewell rode by his side. 
  &#8220;You have been with him long?&#8221; said Ewell. 
  &#8220;From the beginning of the campaign here, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then you were at both Kernstown and McDowell.  A great general,  young  man.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.  He will march anywhere and fight anything.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's my own impression.  We've heard that his men are the  greatest  marchers in the world.  My own lads under him will acquire  the same  merit.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We know, sir, that your men are good marchers already.&#8221; 
  General Ewell laughed with satisfaction. 
  &#8220;It's true,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;When I told my second in command that we  were  going to march to join General Jackson he wanted to bring tents.   I told  him that would load us up with a lot of tent poles and that he  must bring  only a few, for the sick, perhaps.  There must be no  baggage, just food  and ammunition.  I told 'em that when we joined  General Jackson we'd have  nothing to do but eat and fight.&#8221; 
  He seemed now to be speaking to himself rather than to Harry, and  the boy  said nothing.  Ewell, relapsing into silence, urged his horse  to a gallop  and the staff perforce galloped, too.  Such a pace soon  brought them to  the camp of the second army, and as they rode past the  pickets Harry  heard the sound of stringed music. 
  &#8220;The Cajuns,&#8221; said one of the staff, a captain named Morton.  Harry  did  not know what &#8220;Cajuns&#8221; meant, but he was soon to learn.  Meanwhile  the  sound of the music was pleasant in his ear, and he saw that the  camp,  despite the lateness of the hour, was vivid with life. 
  General Ewell gave Harry into Captain Morton's care, and walked  away to a  small tent, where he was joined by several of his senior  officers for a  conference.  But after they had tethered their horses  for the night,  Captain Morton took Harry through the camp. 
  Harry was full of eagerness and curiosity and he asked to see first  the  strange &#8220;Cajuns,&#8221; those who made the music. 
  &#8220;They are Louisiana French,&#8221; said Morton, &#8220;not the descendants or  the  original French settlers in that state, but the descendants of the  French  by the way of Nova Scotia.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, I see, the Acadians, the exiles.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, that's it.  The name has been corrupted into Cajuns in  Louisiana.  They are not like the French of New Orleans and Baton Rouge  and the other  towns.  They are rural and primitive.  You'll like them.   Few of them  were ever more than a dozen miles from home before.  They  love music,  and they've got a full regimental band with them.  You  ought to hear it  play.  Why, they'd play the heart right out of you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I like well enough the guitars and banjos that they're playing  now.  Seems to me that kind of music is always best at night.&#8221; 
  They had now come within the rim of light thrown out by the fires  of the  Acadians, and Harry stood there looking for the first time at  these dark,  short people, brought a thousand miles from their homes. 
  They were wholly unlike Virginians and Kentuckians.  They had black  eyes  and hair, and their naturally dark faces were burned yet darker  by the  sun of the Gulf.  Yet the dark eyes were bright and gay,  sparkling with  kindliness and the love of pleasure.  The guitars and  banjos were playing  some wailing tune, with a note of sadness in the  core of it so keen and  penetrating that it made the water come to  Harry's eyes.  But it changed  suddenly to something that had all the  sway and lilt of the rosy South.  Men sprang to their feet and clasping  arms about one another began to  sway back and forth in the waltz and  the polka. 
  Harry watched with mingled amazement and pleasure.  Most of the  South was  religious and devout.  The Virginians of the valley were  nearly all  staunch Presbyterians, and Stonewall Jackson, staunchest of  them all,  never wanted to fight on Sunday.  The boy himself had been  reared in a  stern Methodist faith, and the lightness in this French  blood of the  South was new to him.  But it pleased him to see them  sing and dance,  and he found no wrong in it, although he could not  have done it himself. 
  Captain Morton noticed Harry's close attention and he read his  mind. 
  &#8220;They surprised me, too, at first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but they're fine  soldiers,  and they've put cheer into this army many a time when it  needed it most.  Taylor, their commander, is a West Pointer and he's  got them into  wonderful trim.  They're well clothed and well shod.   They never straggle  and they're just about the best marchers we have.   They'll soon be rated  high among Jackson's foot cavalry.&#8221; 
  Harry left the Acadians with reluctance, and when he made the round  of  the camp General Ewell, who had finished the conference, told him  that he  would have no message to send that night to Jackson.  He might  go to  sleep, but the whole division would march early in the morning.   Harry  wrapped himself again in his cloak, found a place soft with  moss under a  tree, and slept with the soft May wind playing over his  face and lulling  him to deeper slumber. 
  He rode the next morning with General Ewell and the whole division  to  join Jackson's army.  It was a trim body of men, well clad, fresh  and  strong, and they marched swiftly along the turnpike, on both sides  of  which Jackson was encamped further on. 
  Harry felt a personal pride in being with Ewell when the junction  was to  be made.  He felt that, in a sense, he was leading in this  great  reinforcement himself, and he looked back with intense  satisfaction at  the powerful column marching so swiftly along the  turnpike. 
  They came late in the day to Jackson's pickets, and then they saw  his  army, scattered through the fields on either side of the road. 
  Harry rejoiced once more in the grand appearance of the new  division.  Every coat or tunic sat straight.  Every shoe-lace was tied,  and they  marched with the beautiful, even step of soldiers on parade.   They were  to encamp beyond Jackson's old army, and as they passed  along the  turnpike it was lined on either side by Jackson's own men,  cheering with  vigor. 
  The colonel who was in immediate charge of the encampment, a man  who had  never seen General Jackson, asked Harry where he might find  him.  Harry  pointed to a man sitting on the top rail of a fence beside  the road. 
  &#8220;But I asked for General Jackson,&#8221; said the colonel. 
  &#8220;That's General Jackson.&#8221; 
  The colonel approached and saluted.  General Jackson's clothes were   soiled and dusty.  His feet, encased in cavalry boots that reached  beyond  the knees, rested upon a lower rail of the fence.  A worn cap  with a  dented visor almost covered his eyes.  The rest of his face was  concealed  by a heavy, dark beard. 
  &#8220;General Jackson, I believe,&#8221; said the officer, saluting. 
  &#8220;Yes.  How far have those men marched?&#8221;  The voice was kindly and   approving. 
  &#8220;We've come twenty-six miles, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Good.  And I see no stragglers.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We allow no stragglers.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Better still.  I haven't been able to keep my own men from  straggling,  and you'll have to teach them.&#8221; 
  At that moment the Acadian band began to play, and it played the  merriest  waltz it knew.  Jackson gazed at it, took a lemon from his  pocket and  began to suck the juice from it meditatively.  The officer  stood before  him in some embarrassment. 
  &#8220;Aren't they rather thoughtless for such serious work as war?&#8221;  asked the  Presbyterian general. 
  &#8220;I am confident, sir, that their natural gayety will not impair  their  value as soldiers.&#8221; 
  Jackson put the end of the lemon back in his mouth and drew some  juice  from it.  The colonel bowed and retired.  Then Jackson beckoned  to Harry,  who stood by. 
  &#8220;Follow him and tell him,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the band can play as much  as it  likes.  I noticed, too, that it plays well.&#8221; 
  Jackson smiled and Harry hurried after the officer, who flushed  with  gratification, when the message was delivered to him. 
  &#8220;I'll tell it to the men,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and they'll fight all the  better for  it.&#8221; 
  That night it was a formidable army that slept in the fields on  either  side of the turnpike, and in the silence and the dark,  Stonewall Jackson  was preparing to launch the thunderbolt.
