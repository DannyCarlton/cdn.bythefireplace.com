  &#8220;We will look up our stateroom first, Joe,&#8221; said his new friend. &#8220;It  ought to be a good one.&#8221;
  The stateroom proved to be No. 16, very well located and spacious  for a stateroom. But to Joe it seemed very small for two persons. He  was an inexperienced traveler and did not understand that life on board  ship is widely different from life on shore. His companion had been to  Europe and was used to steamer life.
  &#8220;I think, Joe,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I shall put you in the top berth. The  lower berth is considered more desirable, but I claim it on the score  of age and infirmity.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't look very old, or infirm,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;I am twenty-three. And you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Fifteen&#8212;nearly sixteen.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have a stateroom trunk, which will just slip in under my berth.  Where is your luggage?&#8221;
  Joe looked embarrassed.
  &#8220;I don't know but you will feel ashamed of me,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but the  only extra clothes I have are tied up in this handkerchief.&#8221;
  Charles Folsom whistled.
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you are poorly provided. What have you got  inside?&#8221;
  &#8220;A couple of shirts, three collars, two handkerchiefs, and a pair of  stockings.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you are going a journey of thousands of miles! But never mind,&#8221;  he said kindly. &#8220;I am not much larger than you, and, if you need it, I  can lend you. Once in California, you will have less trouble than if  you were loaded down with clothes. I must get you to tell me your story  when there is time.&#8221;
  They came on deck just in time to see the steamer swing out of the  dock.
  There were some of the passengers with sober faces. They had bidden  farewell to friends and relatives whom they might not see for  years&#8212;perhaps never again. They were going to a new country, where  hardships undoubtedly awaited them, and where they must take their  chances of health and success. Some, too, feared seasickness, a malady  justly dreaded by all who have ever felt its prostrating effects. But  Joe only felt joyful exhilaration.
  &#8220;You look happy, Joe,&#8221; said young Folsom.
  &#8220;I feel so,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;Are you hoping to make your fortune in California?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am hoping to make a living,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;Didn't you make a living here at home?&#8221;
  &#8220;A poor living, with no prospects ahead. I didn't mind hard work and  poor clothes, if there had been a prospect of something better by and  by.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tell me your story. Where were you living?&#8221; Charles Folsom listened  attentively.
  &#8220;Major Norton didn't appear disposed to pamper you, or bring you up  in luxury, that's a fact. It would have been hard lines if, on account  of losing your aunt's legacy, you had been compelled to go back to  Oakville.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't have gone,&#8221; said Joe resolutely.
  &#8220;What would you have done?&#8221;
  &#8220;Stayed in New York, and got a living somehow, even if I had to  black boots in the street.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess you'll do. You've got the right spirit. It takes boys and  men like you for pioneers.&#8221;
  Joe was gratified at his companion's approval.
  &#8220;Now,&#8221; said Folsom, &#8220;I may as well tell you my story. I am the son  of a New York merchant who is moderately rich. I entered the  counting-room at seventeen, and have remained there ever since, with  the exception of four months spent in Europe.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you are rich already, why do you go out to California?&#8221; asked  Joe.
  &#8220;I am not going to the mines; I am going to prospect a little for  the firm. Some day San Francisco will be a large city. I am going to  see how soon it will pay for our house to establish a branch there.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;I shall probably go out to the mines and take a general survey of  the country; but, as you see, I do not go out to obtain employment.&#8221;
  &#8220;It must be jolly not to have to work,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but to have  plenty of money to pay your expenses.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, I suppose it is convenient. I believe you haven't a large  cash surplus?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have a dollar.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've got some pluck to travel so far away from home with such a  slender capital, by Jove!&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know that it's pluck. It's necessity.&#8221;
  &#8220;Something of both, perhaps. Don't you feel afraid of what may  happen?&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;California is a new country, and there must be  plenty of work. Now, I am willing to work and I don't believe I shall  starve.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the way to feel, Joe. At the worst, you have me to fall back  upon. I won't see you suffer.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is very lucky for me. I hope I shan't give you any trouble.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you do, I'll tell you of it,&#8221; said Folsom, laughing. &#8220;The fact  is, I feel rather as if I were your guardian. An odd feeling that, as  hitherto I have been looked after by others. Now it is my turn to  assume authority.&#8221;
  &#8220;You will find me obedient,&#8221; said Joe, smiling. &#8220;Seriously, I am so  inexperienced in the way of the world that I shall consider it a great  favor if you will give me any hints you may think useful to me.&#8221;
  Folsom became more and more pleased with his young charge. He saw  that he was manly, amiable, and of good principles, with only one great  fault&#8212;poverty&#8212;which he was quite willing to overlook.
  They selected their seats in the saloon, and were fortunate enough  to be assigned to the captain's table. Old travelers know that those  who sit at this table are likely to fare better than those who are  farther removed.
  While Folsom was walking the deck with an old friend, whom he had  found among the passengers, Joe went on an exploring expedition.
  He made his way to that portion of the deck appropriated to the  steerage passengers. Among them his eye fell on the man who swindled  him.
  &#8220;You here!&#8221; exclaimed the fellow in amazement.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;I am here.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought you said your ticket wasn't good?&#8221;
  &#8220;It wasn't, as you very well know.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know anything about it. How did you smuggle yourself  aboard?&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't smuggle myself aboard at all. I came on like the rest of  the passengers.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why haven't I seen you before?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not a steerage passenger. I am traveling first-class.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't mean it!&#8221; ejaculated the fellow, thoroughly astonished.  &#8220;You told me you hadn't any more money.&#8221;
  &#8220;So I did, and that shows that you were the man that sold me the  bogus ticket.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing of the kind,&#8221; said the other, but he seemed taken aback by  Joe's charge. &#8220;Well, all I can say is, that you know how to get round.  When a man or boy can travel first-class without a cent of money, he'll  do.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't have come at all if I had had to swindle a poor boy out  of his money,&#8221; said Joe.
  Joe walked off without receiving an answer. He took pains to  ascertain the name of the man who had defrauded him. He was entered on  the passenger-list as Henry Hogan.
