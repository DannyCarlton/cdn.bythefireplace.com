On Thursday she not only witnessed the last moments of the last  session of the Fifty-fourth Congress, but the initial ceremonies of  the inauguration of a President of the United States. She had seen the  galleries crowded before, but never as they were to-day. Even the  Diplomatists' Gallery, usually empty, was full of women and attaches,  and the very steps of the other galleries were set thick with people.  Thousands had stood patiently in the corridors since early morning,  and thousands stood there still, or wandered about looking at the  statues and painted walls. The Senators were all in their seats; most  of them would gladly have been in bed, for they had been up all night;  and the Ambassadors and Envoys were brilliant and glittering curves of  colour: the effect greatly enhanced by the Republican simplicity of  the men to whose country they were accredited. The Judges of the  Supreme Court, in their flowing silk gowns, alone reminded the  spectator that the United States had not sprung full-fledged from  nothing, without traditions and without precedent.    
What little is left of form in the Republic was observed. Two Senators  and one Representative, the Committee appointed to call on the  retiring President, who had just signed his last bill in his room  close by, entered and announced that Mr. Cleveland had no further  messages for the Senate, and extended his congratulations to both  Houses of Congress upon the termination of their labours. The United  States had been without a ruler for twenty minutes when the assistant  doorkeeper announced the Vice-President, two pages drew back the  doors, and Mr. Hobart entered on the arm of a Senator and took the  seat on the dais beside his predecessor, who still occupied the chair  of the presiding officer of the Senate. Then there was another long  wait, during which the people in the galleries gossiped loudly and the  Senators yawned. Finally the President elect and the ex-President,  after being formally announced, entered arm in arm. Both looked very  Republican indeed, especially poor Mr. Cleveland, who toiled along  with the gout, leaning what he could of his massive figure upon an  umbrella. The women stood up, and with one accord pronounced their  President-elect as good-looking as he undoubtedly was strong and  amiable and firm and calm and pious. Mr. Hobart took the oath of  office, and after the necessary speeches and the proclamation for an  Extra Session, the new Senators were sworn in by the new Vice-  President, and Betty wondered how any man would dare to break so  solemn an oath.    
As soon as the move began toward the platform outside, Betty escaped  through the crowd and went home. As she drove down the Avenue, she  heard the stupendous shout of joy, some fifty thousand strong, with  which the American public ever greets its new President and the  consequent show. Be he Republican or Democrat, it is all one for the  day; he is an excuse to gather, to yell, and to gaze.    
Betty turned her head and caught a glimpse of a bareheaded man on his  feet, bowing and bowing and bowing, and of a heavy figure with its hat  on seated beside him. She speculated upon the sardonic reflections  active inside of that hat.    
She did not expect to see Senator North for at least twenty-four  hours, but his card was brought to her while she was still at  luncheon. She went rapidly to her boudoir, and found him standing with  his overcoat on and his hat in his hand.    
Although he had been up all the night before and had not had his full  measure of rest for a week, he looked as calm as usual, and there was  not a hint of fatigue in his face nor of disorder in his dress.    
"You deserted us last night," he said, smiling. "I thought perhaps you  would sit up and see us through."    
"I was up there at nine this morning and saw the Senate floor littered  with papers. It had a very allnight look. Have you had luncheon? Won't  you come in?"    
"I should be glad to, but I haven't time. I find I must go North to-  night, and am on my way home to get a few hours' rest. I wanted to  thank you for many pleasant hours--in this room." His eyes moved about  slowly and softened somewhat. It is not improbable that he would have  liked to throw himself among the cushions of the divan and go to  sleep.    
"Well! You might postpone that until we part for life," said Betty,  lightly. "You forget that Congress will convene in Extra Session on  the fifteenth."    
"Yes, but there is no necessity for me to be here until some time in  May at earliest. The principal object of the Session is the revision  of the Tariff, and the new bill originates with the Ways and Means  Committee. After it has been thrashed out in the House and returned to  the Committee for amendments, it will be referred to the Finance  Committee of the Senate. All that takes time. I am not a member of the  Finance Committee this term, and I shall not return until the debate  opens in the Senate. As to the Arbitration business, Ward will look  after that. I would not stir if there were a chance of the Treaty  coming back to the Senate in its original form, but there is not. When  Ward telegraphs me I shall come down and cast my vote."    
His long speech had given Betty time to recover from his first  announcement, and her eyes were full of the frank earnestness which  had established the desired relation between herself and Senator  North.    
"I am glad you are going to have a rest," she said; "that is, if you  are."    
"Oh, it is work that sits very lightly on me, and is very congenial: I  am going to do all I can to allay this war fever in my own State. It  is not too late to appeal to their reason; but it might be at any  moment."    
"Well, at all events, you go to the bracing climate of the North. But  I am sorry you go so soon. Mother cannot stay in Washington after the  third week in May. I am afraid we shall not meet again until you come  to the Adirondacks."    
"Ah, the Adirondacks!" he said. "Yes, I shall see you there. Good-  bye."    
He did not smile. There were times when he seemed to turn a key and  lock up his features. This was one of them. Betty felt as if she were  looking at a mask contrived with unusual skill.    
He shook her warmly by the hand, however. "I forgot to say that I  shall be in Washington off and on--for a day or so. My wife remains  here. It is still too cold for her in the North. Good-bye again."    
He left her, and she did not return to her luncheon.
