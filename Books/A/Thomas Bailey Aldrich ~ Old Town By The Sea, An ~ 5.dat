When Washington visited Portsmouth in 1789 he was not much  impressed by the architecture of the little town that had stood  by him so stoutly in the struggle for independence. "There are  some good houses," he writes, in a diary kept that year during a  tour through Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, "  among which Colonel Langdon's may be esteemed the first; but in  general they are indifferent, and almost entirely of wood. On  wondering at this, as the country is full of stone and good clay  for bricks, I was told that on account of the fogs and damp they  deemed them wholesomer, and for that reason preferred wood  buildings."    
The house of Colonel Langdon, on Pleasant Street, is an excellent  sample of the solid and dignified abodes which our  great-grandsires had the sense to build. The art of their  construction seems to have been a lost art these fifty years.  Here Governor John Langdon resided from 1782 until the time of  his death in 1819--a period during which many an illustrious man  passed between those two white pillars that support the little  balcony over the front door; among the rest Louis Philippe and  his brothers, the Ducs de Montpensier and Beaujolais, and the  Marquis de Chastellus, a major-general in the French army,  serving under the Count de Rochambeau, whom he accompanied from  France to the States in 1780. The journal of the marquis contains  this reference to his host: "After dinner we went to drink tea  with Mr. Langdon. He is a handsome man, and of noble carriage; he  has been a member of Congress, and is now one of the first people  of the country; his house is elegant and well furnished, and the  apartments admirably well wainscoted" (this reads like Mr. Samuel  Pepys); "and he has a good manuscript chart of the harbor of  Portsmouth. Mrs. Langdon, his wife, is young, fair, and tolerably  handsome, but I conversed less with her than her husband, in  whose favor I was prejudiced from knowing that he had displayed  great courage and patriotism at the time of Burgoynes's  expedition."    
It was at the height of the French Revolution that the three sons  of the Due d'Orleans were entertained at the Langdon mansion.  Years afterward, when Louis Philippe was on the throne of France,  he inquired of a Portsmouth lady presented at his court if the  mansion of ce brave Gouverneur Langdon was still in existence.    
The house stands back a decorous distance from the street, under  the shadows of some gigantic oaks or elms, and presents an  imposing appearance as you approach it over the tessellated  marble walk. A hundred or two feet on either side of the gate,  and abutting on the street, is a small square building of brick,  one story in height--probably the porter's lodge and tool-house  of former days. There is a large fruit garden attached to the  house, which is in excellent condition, taking life comfortably,  and having the complacent air of a well-preserved beau of the  ancien regime. The Langdon mansion was owned and long occupied by  the late Rev. Dr. Burroughs, for a period of forty-seven years  the esteemed rector or St. John's Church.    
At the other end of Pleasant Street is another notable house, to  which we shall come by and by. Though President Washington found  Portsmouth but moderately attractive from an architectural point  of view, the visitor of to-day, if he have an antiquarian taste,  will find himself embarrassed by the number of localities and  buildings that appeal to his interest. Many of these buildings  were new and undoubtedly commonplace enough at the date of  Washington's visit; time and association have given them a  quaintness and a significance which now make their architecture a  question of secondary importance.    
One might spend a fortnight in Portsmouth exploring the nooks and  corners over which history has thrown a charm, and by no means  exhaust the list. I cannot do more than attempt to describe--and  that very briefly--a few of the typical old houses. On this same  Pleasant Street there are several which we must leave unnoted,  with their spacious halls and carven staircases, their antiquated  furniture and old silver tankards and choice Copleys. Numerous  examples of this artist's best manner are to be found here. To  live in Portsmouth without possessing a family portrait done by  Copley is like living in Boston without having an ancestor in the  old Granary Burying-Ground. You can exist, but you cannot be said  to flourish. To make this statement smooth, I will remark that  every one in Portsmouth has a Copley--or would have if a fair  division were made.    
In the better sections of the town the houses are kept in such  excellent repair, and have so smart an appearance with their  bright green blinds and freshly painted woodwork,that you are  likely to pass many an old landmark without suspecting it.  Whenever you see a house with a gambrel roof, you may be almost  positive that the house is at least a hundred years old, for the  gambrel roof went out of fashion after the Revolution.    
On the corner of Daniel and Chapel streets stands the oldest  brick building in Portsmouth--the Warner House. It was built in  1718 by Captain Archibald Macpheadris, a Scotchman, as his name  indicates, a wealthy merchant, and a member of the King's  Council. He was the chief projector of one of the earliest  iron-works established in America. Captain Macpheadris married  Sarah Wentworth, one of the sixteen children of Governor John  Wentworth, and died in 1729, leaving a daughter, Mary, whose  portrait, with that of her mother, painted by the ubiquitous  Copley, still hangs in the parlor of this house, which is not  known by the name of Captain Macpheadris, but by that of his  son-in-law, Hon. Jonathan Warner, a member of the King's Council  until the revolt of the colonies. "We well recollect Mr. Warner,"  says Mr. Brewster, writing in 1858, "as one of the last of the  cocked hats. As in a vision of early childhood he is still before  us, in all the dignity of the aristocratic crown officers. That  broad-backed, long-skirted brown coat, those small-clothes and  silk stockings, those silver buckles, and that cane--we see them  still, although the life that filled and moved them ceased half a  century ago."    
The Warner House, a three-story building with gambrel roof and  luthern windows, is as fine and substantial an exponent of the  architecture of the period as you are likely to meet with  anywhere in New England. The eighteen-inch walls are of brick  brought from Holland, as were also many of the materials used in  the building--the hearth-stones, tiles, etc. Hewn-stone  underpinnings were seldom adopted in those days; the brick-work  rests directly upon the solid walls of the cellar. The interior  is rich in paneling and wood carvings about the mantel-shelves,  the deep-set windows, and along the cornices. The halls are wide  and long, after a by-gone fashion, with handsome staircases, set  at an easy angle, and not standing nearly upright, like those  ladders by which one reaches the upper chambers of a modern  house. The principal rooms are paneled to the ceiling, and have  large open chimney-places, adorned with the quaintest of Dutch  files. In one of the parlors of the Warner House there is a  choice store of family relics--china, silver-plate, costumes, old  clocks, and the like. There are some interesting paintings,  too--not by Copley this time. On a broad space each side of the  hall windows, at the head of the staircase, are pictures of two  Indians, life size. They are probably portraits of some of the  numerous chiefs with whom Captain Macphaedris had dealings, for  the captain was engaged in the fur as well as in the iron  business. Some enormous elk antlers, presented to Macpheadris by  his red friends, are hanging in the lower hall.    
By mere chance, thirty or forty years ago, some long-hidden  paintings on the walls of this lower hall were brought to light.  In repairing the front entry it became necessary to remove the  paper, of which four or five layers had accumulated. A one place,  where several coats had peeled off cleanly, a horse's hoof was  observed by a little girl of the family. The workman then began  removing the paper carefully; first the legs, then the body of a  horse with a rider were revealed, and the astonished paper-hanger  presently stood before a life-size representation of Governor  Phipps on his charger. The workman called other persons to his  assistance, and the remaining portions of the wall were speedily  stripped, laying bare four or five hundred square feet covered  with sketches in color, landscapes, views of unknown cities,  Biblical scenes, and modern figure-pieces, among which was a lady  at a spinning-wheel. Until then no person in the land of the  living had had any knowledge of those hidden pictures. An old  dame of eighty, who had visited at the house intimately ever  since her childhood, all but refused to believe her spectacles  (though Supply Ham made them(1.)) when brought face to face with  the frescoes. (1. In the early part of this century, Supply Ham  was the leading optician and watchmaker of Portsmouth.)    
The place is rich in bricabrac, but there is nothing more curious  that these incongruous printings, clearly the work of a practiced  hand. Even the outside of the old edifice is not without its  interest for an antiquarian. The lightening-rod which protects  the Warner House to-day was put up under Benjamin Franklin's own  supervision in 1762--such at all events is the credited  tradition--and is supposed to be the first rod put up in New  Hampshire. A lightening-rod "personally conducted" by Benjamin  Franklin ought to be an attractive object to even the least  susceptible electricity. The Warner House has another imperative  claim on the good-will of the visitor--it is not positively known  that George Washington ever slept there.    
The same assertion cannot be made on connection with the old  yellow barracks situated in the southwest corner of Court and  Atkinson streets. Famous old houses seem to have an intuitive  perception of the value of corner lots. If it is a possible  thing, they always set themselves down on the most desirable  spots. It is beyond a doubt that Washington slept not only one  night, but several nights, under this roof; for this was a  celebrated tavern previous and subsequent to the War of  Independence, and Washington made it his headquarters during his  visit to Portsmouth in 1797. When I was a boy I knew an old  lady--not one of the preposterous old ladies in the newspapers,  who have all their faculties unimpaired, but a real old lady,  whose ninety-nine years were beginning to tell on her--who had  known Washington very well. She was a girl in her teens when he  came to Portsmouth. The President was the staple of her  conversation during the last ten years of her life, which she  passed in the Stavers House, bedridden; and I think those ten  years were in a manner rendered short and pleasant to the old  gentlewoman by the memory of a compliment to her complexion which  Washington probably never paid to it.    
The old hotel--now a very unsavory tenement-house--was built by  John Tavers, innkeeper, in 1770, who planted in front of the door  a tall post, from which swung the sign of the Earl of Halifax.  Stavers had previously kept an inn of the same name on Queen, now  State Street.    
It is a square three-story building, shabby and dejected, giving  no hint of the really important historical associations that  cluster about it. At the time of its erection it was no doubt  considered a rather grand structure, for buildings of three  stories were rare in Portsmouth. Even in 1798, of the six hundred  and twenty-six dwelling houses of which the town boasted,  eighty-six were of one story, five hundred and twenty-four were  of two stories, and only sixteen of three stories. The Stavers  inn has the regulation gambrel roof, but is lacking in those wood  ornaments which are usually seen over the doors and windows of  the more prominent houses of that epoch. It was, however, the  hotel of the period.    
That same worn doorstep upon which Mr. O'Shaughnessy now  stretches himself of a summer afternoon, with a short clay pipe  stuck between his lips, and his hat crushed down on his brows,  revolving the sad vicissitude of things--that same doorstep has  been pressed by the feet of generals and marquises and grave  dignitaries upon whom depended the destiny of the  States--officers in gold lace and scarlet cloth, and high-heeled  belles in patch, powder, and paduasoy. At this door the Flying  Stage Coach, which crept from Boston, once a week set down its  load of passengers--and distinguished passengers they often were.  Most of the chief celebrities of the land, before and after the  secession of the colonies, were the guests of Master Stavers, at  the sign of the Earl of Halifax.    
While the storm was brewing between the colonies and the mother  country, it was in a back room of the tavern that the adherents  of the crown met to discuss matters. The landlord himself was a  amateur loyalist, and when the full cloud was on the eve of  breaking he had an early intimation of the coming tornado. The  Sons of Liberty had long watched with sullen eyes the secret  sessions of the Tories in Master Stavers's tavern, and one  morning the patriots quietly began cutting down the post which  supported the obnoxious emblem. Mr. Stavers, who seems not to  have been belligerent himself, but the cause of belligerence in  others, sent out his black slave with orders to stop proceedings.  The negro, who was armed with an axe, struck but a single blow  and disappeared. This blow fell upon the head of Mark Noble; it  did not kill him, but left him an insane man till the day of his  death, forty years afterward. A furious mob at once collected,  and made an attack on the tavern, bursting in the doors and  shattering every pane of glass in the windows. It was only  through the intervention of Captain John Langdon, a warm and  popular patriot, that the hotel was saved from destruction.    
In the mean while Master Stavers had escaped through the stables  in the rear. He fled to Stratham, where he was given refuge by  his friend William Pottle, a most appropriately named gentleman,  who had supplied the hotel with ale. The excitement blew over  after a time, and Stavers was induced to return to Portsmouth. He  was seized by the Committee of Safety, and lodged in Exeter jail,  when his loyalty, which had really never been very high, went  down below zero; he took the oath of allegiance, and shortly  after his released reopened the hotel. The honest face of William  Pitt appeared on the repentant sign, vice Earl of Halifax,  ignominiously removed, and Stavers was himself again. In the  state records is the following letter from poor Noble begging for  the enlargement of John Stavers:--    
PORTSMOUTH, February 3, 1777.<br>  To the Committee of Safety of the Town of Exeter:<br>  GENTLEMEN,--As I am informed that Mr. Stivers is in confinement  in gaol upon my account contrary to my desire, for when I was at  Mr. Stivers a fast day I had no ill nor ment none against the  Gentleman but by bad luck or misfortune I have received a bad  Blow but it is so well that I hope to go out in a day or two. So  by this gentlemen of the Committee I hope you will release the  gentleman upon my account. I am yours to serve.<br>  MARK NOBLE,<br>  A friend to my country.    
From that period until I know not what year the Stavers House  prospered. It was at the sign of the William Pitt that the  officers of the French fleet boarded in 1782, and hither came the  Marquis Lafayette, all the way from Providence, to visit  them.John Hancock, Elbridge Gerry, Rutledge, and other signers of  the Declaration sojourned here at various times. It was here  General Knox--"that stalwart man, two officers in size and three  in lungs"--was wont to order his dinner, and in a stentorian  voice compliment Master Stavers on the excellence of his larder.  One day--it was at the time of the French Revolution--Louis  Philippe and his two brothers applied at the door of the William  Pitt for lodgings; but the tavern was full, and the future king,  with his companions, found comfortable quarters under the  hospitable roof of Governor Langdon in Pleasant Street.    
A record of the scenes, tragic and humorous, that have been  enacted within this old yellow house on the corner would fill a  volume. A vivid picture of the social and public life of the old  time might be painted by a skillful hand, using the two Earl of  Halifax inns for a background. The painter would find gay and  sombre pigments ready mixed for his palette, and a hundred  romantic incidents waiting for his canvas. One of these romantic  episodes has been turned to very pretty account by Longfellow in  the last series of The Tales of a Wayside Inn--the marriage of  Governor Benning Wentworth with Martha Hilton, a sort of second  edition of King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid.    
Martha Hilton was a poor girl, whose bare feet and ankles and  scant drapery when she was a child, and even after she was well  in the bloom of her teens, used to scandalize good Dame Stavers,  the innkeeper's wife. Standing one afternoon in the doorway of  the Earl of Halifax, (1. The first of the two hotels bearing that  title. Mr. Brewster commits a slight anachronism in locating the  scene of this incident in Jaffrey Street, now Court. The Stavers  House was not built until the year of Governor Benning  Wentworth's death. Mr. Longfellow, in the poem, does not fall  into the same error.    <blockquote>
 "One hundred years ago, and something more,<br>   In Queen Street, Portsmouth, at her tavern door,<br>   Neat as a pin, and blooming as a rose,<br>   Stood Mistress Stavers in her furbelows.")  </blockquote>  
Dame Stavers took occasion to remonstrate with the sleek-limbed  and lightly draped Martha, who chanced to be passing the tavern,  carrying a pail of water, in which, as the poet neatly says, "the  shifting sunbeam danced."    
"You Pat! you Pat!" cried Mrs. Stavers severely; "why do you go  looking so? You should be ashamed to be seen in the street."    
"Never mind how I look," says Miss Martha, with a merry laugh,  letting slip a saucy brown shoulder out of her dress; "I shall  ride in my chariot yet, ma'am."    
Fortunate prophecy! Martha went to live as servant with Governor  Wentworth at his mansion at Little Harbor, looking out to sea.  Seven years passed, and the "thin slip of a girl," who promised  to be no great beauty, had flowered into the loveliest of women,  with a lip like a cherry and a cheek like a tea-rose--a lady by  instinct, one of Nature's own ladies. The governor, a lonely  widower, and not too young, fell in love with his fair handmaid.  Without stating his purpose to any one, Governor Wentworth  invited a number of friends (among others the Rev. Arthur Brown)  to dine with him at Little Harbor on his birthday. After the  dinner, which was a very elaborate one, was at an end, and the  guests were discussing their tobacco-pipes, Martha Hilton glided  into the room, and stood blushing in front of the chimney-place.  She was exquisitely dressed, as you may conceive, and wore her  hair three stories high. The guests stared at each other, and  particularly at her, and wondered. Then the governor, rising from  his seat,    <blockquote>
 "Played slightly with his ruffles, then looked down,<br>   And said unto the Reverend Arthur Brown:<br>   'This is my birthday; it shall likewise be<br>   My wedding-day; and you shall marry me!'"</blockquote>    
The rector was dumfounded, knowing the humble footing Martha had  held in the house, and could think of nothing cleverer to say  than, "To whom, your excellency?" which was not cleaver at all.    
"To this lady," replied the governor, taking Martha Hilton by the  hand. The Rev. Arthur Brown hesitated. "As the Chief Magistrate  of New Hampshire I command you to marry me!" cried the choleric  old governor.    
And so it was done; and the pretty kitchen-maid became Lady  Wentworth, and did ride in her own chariot. She would not have  been a woman if she had not taken an early opportunity to drive  by Staver's hotel!    
Lady Wentworth had a keen appreciation of the dignity of her new  station, and became a grand lady at once. A few days after her  marriage, dropping her ring on the floor, she languidly ordered  her servant to pick it up. The servant, who appears to have had a  fair sense of humor, grew suddenly near-sighted, and was unable  to the ring until Lady Wentworth stooped and placed her  ladyship's finger upon it. She turned out a faultless wife,  however; and Governor Wentworth at his death, which occurred in  1770, signified his approval of her by leaving her his entire  estate. She married again without changing name, accepting the  hand, and what there was of the heart, of Michael Wentworth, a  retired colonel of the British army, who came to this country in  1767. Colonel Wentworth (not connected, I think, with the  Portsmouth branch of Wentworths) seems to have been of a  convivial turn of mind. He shortly dissipated his wife's fortune  in high living, and died abruptly in New York--it was supposed by  his own hand. His last words--a quite unique contribution to the  literature of last words--were, "I have had my cake, and ate it,"  which showed that the colonel within his own modest limitations  was a philosopher.    
The seat of Governor Wentworth at Little Harbor--a pleasant walk  from Market Square--is well worth a visit. Time and change have  laid their hands more lightly on this rambling old pile than on  any other of the old homes in Portsmouth. When you cross the  threshold of the door you step into the colonial period. Here the  Past seems to have halted courteously, waiting for you to catch  up with it. Inside and outside the Wentworth mansion remains  nearly as the old governor left it; and though it is no longer in  the possession of the family, the present owners, in their  willingness to gratify the decent curiosity of strangers, show a  hospitality which has always characterized the place.    
The house is an architectural freak. The main building--if it is  the main building--is generally two stories in height, with  irregular wings forming three sides of a square which opens in  the water. It is, in brief, a cluster of whimsical extensions  that look as if they had been built at different periods, which I  believe was not the case. The mansion was completed in 1750. It  originally contained fifty-two rooms; a portion of the structure  was removed about half a century ago, leaving forty-five  apartments. The chambers were connected in the oddest manner, by  unexpected steps leading up or down, and capricious little  passages that seem to have been the unhappy afterthoughts of the  architect. But it is a mansion on a grand scale, and with a grand  air. The cellar was arranged for the stabling of a troop of  thirty horse in times of danger. The council-chamber, where for  many years all questions of vital importance to the State were  discussed, is a spacious, high-studded room, finished in the  richest style of the last century. It is said that the  ornamentation of the huge mantel, carved with knife and chisel,  cost the workman a year's constant labor. At the entrance to the  council-chamber are still the racks for the twelve muskets of the  governor's guard--so long ago dismissed!    
Some valuable family portraits adorn the walls here, among which  is a fine painting-yes, by our friend Copley--of the lovely  Dorothy Quincy, who married John Hancock, and afterward became  Madam Scott. This lady was a niece of Dr. Holme's "Dorothy Q."  Opening on the council-chamber is a large billiard-room; the  billiard-table is gone, but an ancient spinnet, with the prim air  of an ancient maiden lady, and of a wheezy voice, is there; and  in one corner stands a claw-footed buffet, near which the  imaginative nostril may still detect a faint and tantalizing odor  of colonial punch. Opening also on the council-chamber are  several tiny apartments, empty and silent now, in which many a  close rubber has been played by illustrious hands. The stillness  and loneliness of the old house seem saddest here. The jeweled  fingers are dust, the merry laughs have turned themselves into  silent, sorrowful phantoms, stealing from chamber to chamber. It  is easy to believe in the traditional ghost that haunts the  place--    <blockquote>
 "A jolly place in times of old,<br>   But something ails it now!"</blockquote>    
The mansion at Little Harbor is not the only historic house that  bears the name of Wentworth. On Pleasant Street, at the head of  Washington Street, stands the abode of another colonial worthy,  Governor John Wentworth, who held office from 1767 down to the  moment when the colonies dropped the British yoke as if it had  been the letter H. For the moment the good gentleman's occupation  was gone. He was a royalist of the most florid complexion. In  1775, a man named John Fenton, and ex-captain in the British  army, who had managed to offend the Sons of Liberty, was given  sanctuary in this house by the governor, who refused to deliver  the fugitive to the people. The mob planted a small cannon  (unloaded) in front of the doorstep and threatened to open fire  if Fenton were not forthcoming. He forth-with came. The family  vacated the premises via the back-yard, and the mob entered,  doing considerable damage. The broken marble chimney-place still  remains, mutely protesting against the uncalled-for violence.  Shortly after this event the governor made his way to England,  where his loyalty was rewarded first with a governorship and then  with a pension of L500. He was governor of Nova Scotia from 1792  to 1800, and died in Halifax in 1820. This house is one of the  handsomest old dwellings in the town, and promises to outlive  many of its newest neighbors. The parlor has undergone no change  whatever since the populace rushed into it over a century ago.  The furniture and adornments occupy their original positions and  the plush on the walls has not been replaced by other hangings.  In the hall--deep enough for the traditional duel of baronial  romance--are full-length portraits of the several governors and  sundry of their kinsfolk.    
There is yet a third Wentworth house, also decorated with the  shade of a colonial governor--there were three Governors  Wentworth--but we shall pass it by, though out of no lack of  respect for that high official personage whose commission was  signed by Joseph Addison, Esq., Secretary of State under George  I.
