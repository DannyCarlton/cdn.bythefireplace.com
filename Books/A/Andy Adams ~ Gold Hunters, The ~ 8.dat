  Before a rousing fire of logs Rod and Wabigoon began to see the  cheerful side of life again, and as soon as Mukoki had built them a  balsam shelter they stripped off their clothes and wrapped themselves  in blankets, while the old Indian dried their outfits. It was two hours  before they were dressed. No sooner were they out than Wabi went into  the bush and returned a few minutes later brandishing a good-sized  birch in his hand. There was no sign of humor in his face as he eyed  Rod.
  &#8220;Do you see that log?&#8221; he said, pointing to the big trunk of a  fallen tree near the fire &#8220;That will just fit your stomach, Rod. It  will be better than kicking. Double yourself over that, face down,  pantaloons up. I'm going to lick you first because I want you to know  just how much to give me. I want it twice as hard, for I was more to  blame than you.&#8221;
  In some astonishment Rod doubled himself over the log.
  &#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he ejaculated, peering up in dismay. &#8220;Not too hard,  Wabi!&#8221;
  Swish! fell the birch, and a yell of pain burst from the white  youth's lips.
  Swish!&#8212;Swish!&#8212;Swish!
  &#8220;Ouch! Great Caesar&#8212;Let up!&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't move!&#8221; shouted Wabi. &#8220;Take it like a man&#8212;you deserve it!&#8221;
  Again and again the birch fell. Rod groaned as he rose to his feet  after Wabi had stopped. &#8220;Oh, please&#8212;please give me that whip!&#8221;
  &#8220;Not too hard, you know,&#8221; warned Wabi, as he fitted himself over the  log.
  &#8220;You chose your own poison,&#8221; reminded Rod, rolling up his sleeve.  &#8220;Just twice as hard, no more!&#8221;
  And the birch began to fall.
  When it was over Rod's arm ached, and Wabi, despite his Indian  stoicism, let out a long howl at the last blow.
  During the entire scene of chastisement Mukoki stood like one struck  dumb.
  &#8220;We'll never be bad any more, Muky,&#8221; promised Wabigoon, rubbing  himself gently. &#8220;That is, if we are, we'll whip ourselves again, eh,  Rod?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not so long as I can run!&#8221; assured Rod with emphasis. &#8220;I'm willing  to lend a helping hand at any time you think you deserve another, but  beyond that please count me out!&#8221;
  For an hour after the self-punishment of the young gold hunters the  three gathered fuel for the night and balsam boughs for their beds. It  was dark by the time they sat down to their supper, which they ate in  the light of a huge fire of dry poplar.
  &#8220;This is better than paddling all night, even if we did have a close  shave,&#8221; said Rod, after they had finished and settled themselves  comfortably.
  Wabi gave a grimace and shrugged his shoulders.
  &#8220;Do you know how close your call was?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It was so close  that just by one chance in ten thousand you were saved. I had pulled  myself upon the ice by catching hold of the bow of the canoe and when  Muky saw that I was safe he watched for you. But you didn't show up. We  had given you up for dead when a few bubbles came to the surface, and  quicker than a wink Mukoki thrust down his arm. He got you by the hair  as you were sinking for the last time. Think of that, Rod, and dream of  it to-night. It'll do you good.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ugh!&#8221; shuddered the white youth. &#8220;Let's talk of something more  cheerful. What a glorious fire that poplar makes!&#8221;
  &#8220;Mak' light more as twent' t'ous'nd candles!&#8221; agreed Mukoki. &#8220;Heem  bright!&#8221;
  &#8220;Once upon a time, many ages ago, there was a great chief in this  country,&#8221; began Wabigoon, &#8220;and he had seven beautiful daughters. So  beautiful were they that the Great Spirit himself fell in love with  them, and for the first time in countless moons he appeared upon earth,  and told the chief that if he would give him his seven daughters he, in  turn, would grant the father seven great desires. And the chief,  surrendering his daughters, asked that he might be given a day without  night, and a night without day, and his wish was granted; and his third  and fourth and fifth desires were that the land might always be filled  with fish and game, the forests remain for ever green, and fire be  given to his people. His sixth desire was that a fuel be given to him  which would burn even in water, and the Great Spirit gave him birch;  and his seventh desire was that he might possess another fuel, which  would throw off no smoke, and might bring comfort and joy to his  wigwams&#8212;and the poplar sprang up in the forests. And because of that  chief, and his seven beautiful daughters, all of these things are true  even to this day. Isn't it so, Mukoki?&#8221;
  The old warrior nodded.
  &#8220;And what became of the Great Spirit and the seven beautiful  daughters?&#8221; questioned Rod.
  Mukoki rose and left the fire.
  &#8220;He believes in that as he believes in the sun and the moon,&#8221; spoke  Wabi softly. &#8220;But he knows that you do not, and that all white people  laugh at it. He could tell you many wonderful stories of the creation  of these forests and mountains and the things in them if he would. But  he knows that you would not believe, and would laugh at him afterward.&#8221;
  In an instant Rod was upon his feet.
  &#8220;Mukoki!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Mukoki!&#8221;
  The old Indian turned and came back slowly. The white youth met him  half-way, his face flushed, his eyes shining.
  &#8220;Mukoki,&#8221; he said gently, gripping the warrior's hand, &#8220;Mukoki&#8212;I  love your Great Spirit! I love the one who made these glorious forests,  and that glorious moon up there, and the mountains and lakes and  rivers! I Want to know more about him. You must tell me, so that I will  know when he talks about me, in the winds, in the stars, in the  forests! Will you?&#8221;
  Mukoki was looking at him, his thin lips parted, his grim visage  relaxed, as if he were weighing the truthfulness of the white youth's  words.
  &#8220;And I will tell you about our Great Spirit, the white man's Great  Spirit,&#8221; urged Rod. &#8220;For we have a Great Spirit, too, Mukoki, and He  did for the white man's world what yours did for you. He created the  earth, the sky and the sea and all the things in them in six days, and  on the seventh He rested. And that seventh day we call Sunday, Mukoki.  And He made our forests for us, as your Great Spirit made them for you,  only instead of giving them for the love of seven beautiful women He  gave them for the love of man. I'll tell you wonderful things about  Him, Mukoki, if you will tell me about yours. Is it a bargain?&#8221;
  &#8220;Mebby&#8212;yes,&#8221; replied the old pathfinder slowly. His face had  softened, and for the second time Rod knew that he had touched the  heartstrings of his red comrade. They returned to the fire, and Wabi  made room for them upon the log beside him. In his hand he held a copy  of the old birch-bark map.
  &#8220;I've been thinking about this all day,&#8221; he said, spreading it out  so that the others could see. &#8220;Somehow I haven't been able to get the  idea out of my head that&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221; asked Rod.
  &#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; hastily added Wabi, as if he regretted what he had  said. &#8220;It's a mighty curious map, isn't it? I wonder if we'll ever know  its whole story.&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe we know it now,&#8221; declared Rod. &#8220;In the first place, we  found it clutched by one of the skeletons, and we know from the knife  wounds in those skeletons, and the weapons near them, that the two men  fought and killed themselves. They fought for this map, for the  precious secret which each wished to possess alone. Now&#8212;&#8221;
  He took the map from Wabi's fingers and held it up between them and  the fire.
  &#8220;Isn't the rest of it clear?&#8221;
  For a few moments the three looked at it in silence.
  From the faded outlines of the original it had been drawn with  painstaking accuracy.
  With a splinter Rod pointed to the top of the map, where were  written the words, &#8220;Cabin and head of chasm.&#8221;
  &#8220;Could anything be clearer?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Here is the cabin in  which the men killed themselves, and where we found their skeletons,  and here they have marked the chasm in which I shot the silver fox, and  down which we must go to find the gold. According to this we must go  until we come to the third waterfall, and there we will find another  cabin&#8212;and the gold.&#8221;
  &#8220;It all seems very simple&#8212;by the map,&#8221; agreed Wabi.
  Under the crude diagram were a number of lines in writing. They  were:
  &#8220;We, John Ball, Henri Langlois, and Peter Plante, having discovered  gold at this fall, do hereby agree to joint partnership in the same,  and do pledge ourselves to forget our past differences and work in  mutual good will and honesty, so help us God. Signed,
  &#8220;JOHN BALL, HENRI LANGLOIS, PETER PLANTE.&#8221;
  Through the name of John Ball had been drawn a broad black line  which had almost destroyed the letters, and at the end of this line, in  brackets, was printed a word in French, which for the hundredth time  Wabi translated aloud:
  &#8220;Dead!&#8221;
  &#8220;From the handwriting of the original we know that Ball was a man of  some education,&#8221; continued Rod. &#8220;And there is no doubt but that the  birch-bark sketch was made by him. All of the writing was in one hand,  with the exception of the signatures of Langlois and Plante, and you  could hardly decipher the letters in those signatures if you did not  already know their names. From these lines it is quite certain that we  were right at the cabin when we concluded that the two Frenchmen killed  the Englishman to get him out of the partnership. Isn't that story  clear enough?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, as far as you have gone,&#8221; replied Wabi. &#8220;These three men  discovered gold, quarreled, signed this agreement, and then Ball was  murdered. The two Frenchmen, as Mukoki suggested at the cabin, came out  a little later for supplies, and brought the buckskin bag full of gold  with them. They had come as far as the cabin at the head of the chasm  when they quarreled over possession of the map and agreement, fought,  and died. From the old guns and other evidences we found near them we  know that all this happened at least fifty years ago, and perhaps more.  But&#8212;&#8221;
  He paused, whistling softly.
  &#8220;Where is the third waterfall?&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought we settled that last winter,&#8221; replied Rod, a little  irritated by his companion's doubt. &#8220;If writing goes for anything, Ball  was a man of education, and he drew the map according to some sort of  scale. The second fall is only half as far from the first fall as the  third fall is from the second, which is conclusive evidence of this.  Now Mukoki discovered the first waterfall fifty miles down the chasm!&#8221;
  &#8220;And we figured from the distances between John Ball's marks on the  birch, that the third fall was about two hundred and fifty miles from  our old camp at the head of the chasm,&#8221; rejoined Wabigoon. &#8220;It looks  reasonable.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is reasonable,&#8221; declared Rod, his face flushed with excitement.  &#8220;From the head of the chasm our trail is as plain as day. We can't miss  it!&#8221;
  Mukoki had been listening in silence, and now joined in the  conversation for the first time.
  &#8220;Must get to chasm first,&#8221; he grunted, giving his shoulders a hunch  that suggested a great deal.
  Wabi returned the map to his pocket.
  &#8220;You're right, Muky,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;We're climbing mountains before  we come to them. It will be tough work getting to the chasm.&#8221;
  &#8220;Much water&#8212;ver' swift. River run lak twent' t'ous'nd cari-boo!&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll bet the Ombabika is a raging torrent,&#8221; said Rod.
  &#8220;And we've got forty miles of it, all upstream,&#8221; replied Wabi. &#8220;Then  we come to the Height of Land. After that the streams run northward, to  Hudson Bay, and when we reach them we'll hold our breath and pray  instead of paddling. Oh, it will be exciting fun rushing down-stream on  the floods!&#8221;
  &#8220;But there is work before us to-morrow&#8212;hard work,&#8221; said Rod. &#8220;And  I'm going to bed. Good night!&#8221;
  Mukoki and Wabigoon soon followed their companion's example, and  half an hour later nothing but the crackling of the fire disturbed the  stillness of the camp. Mukoki was as regular as clockwork in his  rising, and an hour before dawn he was up and preparing breakfast. When  his young comrades aroused themselves they found the ducks they had  shot the preceding day roasting on spits over the fire, and coffee  nearly ready. Rod also noticed that a part of the contents of the canoe  were missing.
  &#8220;Took load up to river,&#8221; explained Mukoki in response to the youth's  questioning.
  &#8220;Working while we sleep, as usual,&#8221; exclaimed the disgusted  Wabigoon. &#8220;If it keeps on we'll deserve another whipping, Rod!&#8221;
  Mukoki examined a fat bluebill, roasted to a rich brown, and gave it  to Rod. Another he handed to Wabigoon, and with a third in his own  hands he found a seat for himself upon the ground close to the coffee  and bread.
  &#8220;Ah, if this isn't fit for a king!&#8221; cried Rod, poising his savory  bluebill on the end of a fork.
  Half an hour later the three went to their canoe. Mukoki had already  packed a half of its contents to the river, a quarter of a mile away,  and he now loaded himself with the remainder while the two boys hoisted  the light birch upon their shoulders. As Roderick caught his first  glimpse of the Ombabika in the growing light of day he gave a cry of  astonishment. When he had gone up the stream the preceding winter it  was scarce more than a dozen gun lengths in width. Now it was a  veritable Amazon, its black, ugly waters rolling and twisting like the  slow boiling of a thick liquid over a fire. There was little rush about  it, no frenzied haste, no mountain-like madness in the advance of the  torrent. Rod had expected to see this, and he would not have been  startled by it.
  But there was something vastly more appalling in the flood that  rolled slowly before his eyes, with its lazily twisting whirlpools, its  thousand unseen currents, rolling the water here and there&#8212;always in  different places&#8212;like the gurgling eruptions he had often observed in  a pot of simmering oatmeal. There was something uncanny about it,  something terribly suggestive of giant hands under the surface, waiting  to pull them down. He knew, without questioning, that there was more  deadly power in that creeping flood than in a dozen boisterous torrents  thundering down from the mountains. In it were the cumulative waters of  a score of those torrents, and in its broad, deep sweep into the big  lake the currents and perils of each were combined into one great  threatening force.
  The thoughts that were in Rod's mind betrayed themselves as he  looked at his companions. Mukoki was reloading the canoe. Wabi watched  the flood.
  &#8220;She's running pretty strong,&#8221; said the Indian youth dubiously.  &#8220;What do you think of it, Muky?&#8221;
  &#8220;Keep close to shore,&#8221; replied the old warrior, without stopping his  work. &#8220;We mak' heem&#8212;safe!&#8221;
  There was a good deal of consolation in Mukoki's words, for both  youths still bore smarting reminders of his caution and good judgment.  In a short time the canoe was safely launched where a small eddy had  worked into the shore, and the three adventurers dug in their paddles.  Mukoki, who held the important position in the stern, kept the bow of  the birch within half a dozen yards of the bank, and to Rod's mind they  slipped up-stream with amazing speed and ease. Now and then one of the  upheavings of the currents would catch the canoe, and from the way in  which it was pitched either to one side or the other Rod easily  imagined what perils the middle of the stream would have held for them.  Quick action on the part of Mukoki and Wabigoon was always necessary to  counteract the effect of these upheavals, and in the bow Wabi was  constantly on the alert. At no time could they tell when to expect the  attacks of the unseen forces below. Ten feet ahead the water might be  running as smooth as oil, then&#8212;a single huge bubble, as if a great  fish had sent up a gasp of air&#8212;and in an instant it would be boiling  like a small maelstrom.
  Rod noticed that each time they were caught near one of these some  unseen power seemed sucking them down, and that at those times the  canoe would settle several inches deeper than when they were in calm  water. The discovery thrilled him, and he wondered what one of the big  eruptions out in mid-stream would do to them if they were caught in it.  Other perils were constantly near them. Floating logs and masses of  brush and other debris swept down with the flood, and Wabi's warning  cries of &#8220;right,&#8221; &#8220;left,&#8221; and &#8220;back&#8221; came with such frequency that  Rod's arms ached with the mighty efforts which he made with his paddle  in response to them. Again the stream would boil with such fury ahead  of them that Mukoki would put in to shore, and a portage would be made  beyond the danger point. Five times during the day were the canoe and  its contents carried in this manner, so that including all time lost an  average of not more than two miles an hour was made. When camp was  struck late that afternoon, however, Mukoki figured that they had  covered half the distance up the Ombabika.
  The following day's progress was even slower. With every mile the  stream became narrower and swifter. The treacherous upheavals caused by  undercurrents no longer harassed the gold seekers, but logs and debris  swept down with greater velocity. Several times the frail canoe was  saved from destruction only by the quick and united action of the  three. They worked now like a well-regulated machine, engineered by  Wabigoon, whose sharp eyes were always on the alert for danger ahead.  This second day was one of thrills and tense anxiety for Rod, and he  was glad when it came to an end. It was early, and the sun was still  two hours high, when they stopped to camp.
  Mukoki had chosen an open space, backed by a poplar-covered rocky  ridge, and scarce had the bow of the canoe touched shore when Wabi gave  an excited exclamation, caught up his rifle, and fired three rapid  shots in the direction of a small clump of spruce near the foot of the  mountain.
  &#8220;Missed, by all that's good and great!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Quick, Mukoki,  shove her in! There's the biggest bear I've seen in all my life!&#8221;
  &#8220;Where?&#8221; demanded Rod. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;
  He dropped his paddle and snatched his own rifle, while Mukoki,  keeping his self-possession, brought the canoe so that Wabi could leap  ashore. Rod followed like a flash, and the two excited youths sped in  the direction of the bear, leaving their companion to care for himself  and the heavily-laden birch. A short, swift run brought them to the  edge of the spruce, and with hearts beating wildly the two scanned the  barren side of the mountain ahead of them. There was no sign of the  bear.
  &#8220;He turned down-stream!&#8221; cried Wabi, &#8220;We must cut&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;There he is,&#8221; whispered Rod sharply.
  Just beginning the ascent of the mountain, four or five hundred  yards below them, was the bear. Even at that distance Rod was amazed at  the size of the beast.
  &#8220;What a monster!&#8221; he gasped.
  &#8220;Blaze away!&#8221; urged Wabi. &#8220;It's four hundred yards if it's a foot!  Aim for the top of his back and you'll bring him!&#8221;
  Suiting action to his words he fired the two remaining shots in his  rifle, and as he slipped in fresh cartridges Rod continued the  long-range fusillade. His first and second shots produced no effect. At  his third the running animal paused for a moment and looked down at  them, and the young Hunter seized his opportunity to take a careful  aim. At the report of his gun the bear gave a quick lunge forward,  half-fell among the rocks, and then was off again.
  &#8220;You hit him!&#8221; shouted Wabi, setting off on a dead run between the  spruce and the mountain.
  For a few brief moments Rod studied the situation as he reloaded.  The bear was rapidly nearing the summit of the ridge. By, swift running  Wabigoon would have another fair shot before the animal got out of  range. If that shot were a miss they would lose their game. In a flash  he discerned a break in the mountain. If he could make that, and the  bear turned in his direction&#8212;
  Without further thought he ran toward the break. He heard the sharp  reports of Wabi's rifle behind him, but didn't stop to see the effect  of the fire. If it was another miss&#8212;every second counted. The cut in  the mountain was clear. Breathlessly he dashed through it and stopped  on the opposite side, his eyes eagerly scanning the rock-strewn ridge.  He made no attempt to suppress the exclamation of joy that came to his  lips when, fully eight hundred yards away, he discerned the bear coming  down the side of the mountain, and in his direction. Crouching behind a  huge boulder Rod waited. Seven hundred yards, six hundred, five  hundred, and the bear turned, this time striking into the edge of the  plain. The animal was traveling slowly, partly stopping in his flight  now and then, and Rod knew that he was badly wounded. It was soon  evident that the course being taken by the game would bring it no  nearer, and the young hunter leveled his rifle.
  Five hundred yards, more than a quarter of a mile!
  This was desperate shooting, shooting that sent a strange thrill  through Roderick Drew. The magnificent weapon in his hands was equal to  the task. It would kill easily at that distance. But would he fail? He  was confident that his first shot went high. His second had no effect.  To his third there came the sharp response of a fourth from the top of  the mountain. Wabigoon had reached the summit, and was firing at six  hundred yards!
  The bear stopped. With deadly precision Rod now took aim at the  motionless animal. An instant after he had fired a wild shout burst  from his throat, and was answered by Wabigoon's joyful yell from the  mountain. It was a wonderful shot, and the bear was down!
  The animal was dead when the triumphant young hunters reached its  side. It was some time before either of them spoke. Panting from their  exertions, both looked down in silence upon the huge beast at their  feet. That he had made a remarkable kill Rod could see by the look of  wonder in his companion's face. They were still mutely regarding the  dead animal when Mukoki came through the break in the ridge and hurried  toward them. His face, too, became filled with amazement when he saw  the bear.
  &#8220;Big bear!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  There was a world of meaning in his words, and Rod flushed with  pleasure.
  &#8220;He weighs five hundred,&#8221; said Wabi, &#8220;and he stands four feet at the  shoulders if an inch.&#8221;
  &#8220;Fine rug!&#8221; grinned Mukoki.
  &#8220;Let's see, Rod; he'll make a rug&#8212;&#8221; Wabi walked critically around  the bear. &#8220;He'll make you a rug over eight feet long by about six in  width. I wonder where he is hit?&#8221;
  A brief examination showed that while the honors of the actual kill  were with Rod, at least one, and perhaps two, of Wabi's shots had taken  effect. The last shot from the white youth's rifle had struck the bear  just below the right ear, causing almost instantaneous death. On this  same side, which had been exposed to Rod's fire, was a body wound,  undoubtedly made by the shot on the mountain side. When the animal was  rolled over by the combined efforts of the three two more wounds were  discovered on the left side, which had mostly been exposed to  Wabigoon's fire. It was while examining these that the sharp-eyed  Mukoki gave a sudden grunt of surprise.
  &#8220;Heem shot before&#8212;long time ago! Old wound&#8212;feel bullet!&#8221;
  Between his fingers he was working the loose hide back of the  foreleg. The scar of an old wound was plainly visible, and both Rod and  Wabi could feel the ball under the skin. There is something that  fascinates the big game hunter in this discovery of an old wound in his  quarry, and especially in the vast solitudes of the North, where  hunters are few and widely scattered. It brings with it a vivid picture  of what happened long ago, the excitement of some other chase, the  well-directed shot, and at last the escape of the game. And so it was  now. The heads of Rod and Wabigoon hung close over Mukoki's shoulders  while the old Indian dug out the bullet with his knife. Another grunt  of surprise fell from the pathfinder's lips as he dropped the pellet in  the palm of his hand.
  It was a strange-looking object, smooth, and curiously flattened.
  &#8220;Ver' soft bullet,&#8221; said Mukoki. &#8220;Never know lead thin, thin out lak  that!&#8221;
  With his knife he peeled off a thin slice of the ball.
  &#8220;Heem&#8212;&#8221;
  He held up the two pieces. In the sun they gleamed a dull, rich  yellow.
  &#8220;That bullet made of gold!&#8221; he breathed, scarcely above a whisper.  &#8220;No yellow lead. That gold, pure gold!&#8221;
