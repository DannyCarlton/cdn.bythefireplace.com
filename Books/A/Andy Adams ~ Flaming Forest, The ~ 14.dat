  David moved slowly behind the brigade man. He had no desire to   hurry. He did not wish to see what happened when Marie-Anne met  St.  Pierre Boulain. Only a moment ago she had been in his arms;  her hair  had smothered his face; her hands had clung to his  shoulders; her  flushed cheeks and long lashes had for an instant  lain close against  his breast. And now, swiftly, without a word of  apology, she was  running away from him to meet her husband. 
  He almost spoke that word aloud as he saw the last of her slim   figure among the silver birches. She was going to the man to whom  she  belonged, and there was no hesitation in the manner of her  going. She  was glad. And she was entirely forgetful of him, Dave  Carrigan, in  that gladness. 
  He quickened his steps, narrowing the distance between him and the   hurrying brigade man. Only the diseased thoughts in his brain had   made the happening in the creek anything but an accident. It was  all  an accident, he told himself. Marie-Anne had asked him to  carry her  across just as she would have asked any one of her  rivermen. It was  his fault, and not hers, that he had slipped in  mid-stream, and that  his arms had closed tighter about her, and  that her hair had brushed  his face. He remembered she had laughed,  when it seemed for a moment  that they were going to fall into the  stream together. Probably she  would tell St. Pierre all about it.  Surely she would never guess it  had been nearer tragedy than  comedy for him. 
  Once more he was convinced he had proved himself a weakling and a   fool. His business now was with St. Pierre, and the hour was at  hand  when the game had ceased to be a woman's game. He had looked  ahead to  this hour. He had prepared himself for it and had  promised himself  action that would be both quick and decisive. And  yet, as he went on,  his heart was still thumping unsteadily, and  in his arms and against  his face remained still the sweet, warm  thrill of his contact with  Marie-Anne. He could not drive that  from him. It would never  completely go. As long as he lived, what  had happened in the creek  would live with him. He did not deny  that crying voice inside him. It  was easy for his mouth to make  words. He could call himself a fool and  a weakling, but those  words were purely mechanical, hollow,  meaningless. The truth  remained. It was a blazing fire in his breast,  a conflagration  that might easily get the best of him, a thing which  he must fight  and triumph over for his own salvation. He did not think  of danger  for Marie-Anne, for such a thought was inconceivable. The  tragedy  was one-sided. It was his own folly, his own danger. For just  as  he loved Marie-Anne, so did she love her husband, St. Pierre. 
  He came to the low ridge close to the river and climbed up through   the thick birches and poplars. At the top was a bald knob of   sandstone, over which the riverman had already passed. David  paused  there and looked down on the broad sweep of the Athabasca. 
  What he saw was like a picture spread out on the great breast of   the river and the white strip of shoreline. Still a quarter of a  mile  upstream, floating down slowly with the current, was a mighty  raft,  and for a space his eyes took in nothing else. On the  Mackenzie, the  Athabasca, the Saskatchewan, and the Peace he had  seen many rafts, but  never a raft like this of St. Pierre Boulain.  It was a hundred feet in  width and twice and a half times as long,  and with the sun blazing  down upon it from out of a cloudless sky  it looked to him like a  little city swept up from out of some  archaic and savage desert land  to be transplanted to the river. It  was dotted with tents and canvas  shelters. Some of these were  gray, and some were white, and two or  three were striped with  broad bands of yellow and red. Behind all  these was a cabin, and  over this there rose a slender staff from which  floated the black  and white pennant of St. Pierre. The raft was alive.  Men were  running between the tents. The long rudder sweeps were  flashing in  the sun. Rowers with naked arms and shoulders were  straining their  muscles in four York boats that were pulling like ants  at the  giant mass of timber. And to David's ears came a deep monotone  of  human voices, the chanting of the men as they worked. 
  Nearer to him a louder response suddenly made answer to it. A   dozen steps carried him round a projecting thumb of brush, and he   could see the open shore where the bateau was tied. Marie-Anne had   crossed the strip of sand, and Bateese was helping her into a  waiting  York boat. Then Bateese shoved it off, and the four men in  it began to  row. Two canoes were already half-way to the raft, and  David  recognized the occupant of one of them as Andre, the Broken  Man. Then  he saw Marie-Anne rise in the York boat and wave  something white in  her hand. 
  He looked again toward the raft. The current and the sweeps and   the tugging boats were drawing it steadily nearer. Standing at the   very edge of it he saw now a solitary figure, and in the clear   sunlight the man stood out clean-cut as a carven statue. He was a   giant in size. His head and arms were bare, and he was looking   steadily toward the bateau and the approaching York boat. He  raised  an arm, and a moment later the movement was followed by a  voice that  rose above all other voices. It boomed over the river  like the rumble  of a gun. In response to it Marie-Anne waved the  white thing in her  hand, and David thought he heard her voice in  an answering cry. He  stared again at the solitary figure of the  man, seeing nothing else,  hearing no other sound but the booming  of the deep cry that came again  over the river. His heart was  thumping. In his eyes was a gathering  fire. His body grew tense.  For he knew that at last he was looking at  St. Pierre, chief of  the Boulains, and husband of the woman he loved. 
  As the significance of the situation grew upon him, a flash of his   old humor returned. It was the same grim humor that had possessed  him  behind the rock, when he had thought he was going to die. Fate  had  played him a dishonest turn then, and it was doing the same  thing by  him now. Unless he deliberately turned his face away, he  was going to  see the reunion of Marie-Anne and St. Pierre. 
  Yesterday he had strapped his binoculars to his belt. Today Marie-   Anne had looked through them a dozen times. They had been a source  of  pleasure and thrill to her. Now, David thought, they would be  good  medicine for him. He would see the whole thing through, and  at close  range. He would leave himself no room for doubt. He had  laughed behind  the rock, when bullets were zipping close to his  head, and the same  grim smile came to his lips now as he focused  his glasses on the  solitary figure at the head of the raft. 
  The smile died away when he saw St. Pierre. It was as if he could   reach out and touch him with his hand. And never, he thought, had  he  seen such a man. A moment before, a flashing vision had come to  him  from out of an Arabian desert; the multitude of colored tents,  the  half-naked men, the great raft floating almost without  perceptible  motion on the placid breast of the river had stirred  his imagination  until he saw a strange picture. But there was  nothing Arabic, nothing  desert-like, in this man his binoculars  brought within a few feet of  his eyes. He was more like a viking  pirate who had roved the sea a few  centuries ago. One great, bare  arm was raised as David looked, and his  booming voice was rolling  over the river again. His hair was shaggy,  and untrimmed, and red;  he wore a short beard that glistened in the  sun&#8212;he was laughing  as he waved and shouted to Marie-Anne&#8212;a joyous,  splendid giant of  a man who seemed almost on the point of leaping into  the water in  his eagerness to clasp in his naked arms the woman who  was coming  to him. 
  David drew a deep breath, and there came an unconscious tightening   at his heart as he turned his glasses upon Marie-Anne. She was  still  standing in the bow of the York boat, and her back was  toward him. He  could see the glisten of the sun in her hair. She  was waving her  handkerchief, and the poise of her slim body told  him that in her  eagerness she would have darted from the bow of  the boat had she  possessed wings. 
  Again he looked at St. Pierre. And this was the man who was no   match for Concombre Bateese! It was inconceivable. Yet he heard   Marie-Anne's voice repeating those very words in his ear. But she  had  surely been joking with him. She had been storing up this  little  surprise for him. She had wanted him to discover with his  own eyes  what a splendid man was this chief of the Boulains. And  yet, as David  stared, there came to him an unpleasant thought of  the incongruity of  this thing he was looking upon. It struck upon  him like a clashing  discord, the fact of matehood between these  two&#8212;a condition  inconsistent and out of tune with the beautiful  things he had built up  in his mind about the woman. In his soul he  had enshrined her as a  lovely wildflower, easily crushed, easily  destroyed, a sweet treasure  to be guarded from all that was rough  and savage, a little  violet-goddess as fragile as she was brave  and loyal. And St. Pierre,  standing there at the edge of his raft,  looked as if he had come up  out of the caves of a million years  ago! There was something barbaric  about him. He needed only a club  and a shield and the skin of a beast  about his loins to transform  him into prehistoric man. At least these  were his first  impressions&#8212;impressions roused by thought of  Marie-Anne's slim,  beautiful body crushed close in the embrace of that  laughing,  powerful-lunged giant. Then the reaction swept over him. St.   Pierre was not a monster, even though his disturbed mind   unconsciously made an effort to conceive him as such. There were   gladness and laughter in his face. There was the contagion of joy  and  good cheer in the voice that boomed over the water. Laughter  and  shouts answered it from the shore. The rowers in Marie-Anne's  York  boat burst into a wild and exultant snatch of song and made  their oars  fairly crack. There came a solitary yell from Andre,  the Broken Man,  who was close to the head of the raft now. And  from the raft itself  came a slowly swelling volume of sound, the  urge and voice and  exultation of red-blooded men a-thrill with the  glory of this day and  the wild freedom of their world. The truth  came to David. St. Pierre  Boulain was the beloved Big Brother of  his people. 
  He waited, his muscles tense, his jaws set tight. Good medicine,   he called it again, a righteous sort of punishment set upon him  for  the moral cowardice he had betrayed in falling down in worship  at the  feet of another man's wife. The York boat was very close to  the head  of the raft now. He saw Marie-Anne herself fling a rope  to St. Pierre.  Then the boat swung alongside. In another moment  St. Pierre had leaned  over, and Marie-Anne was with him on the  raft. For a space everything  else in the world was obliterated for  David. He saw St. Pierre's arms  gather the slim form into their  embrace. He saw Marie-Anne's hands go  up fondly to the bearded  face. And then&#8212; 
  Carrigan cut the picture there. He turned his shoulder to the raft   and snapped the binoculars in the case at his belt. Some one was   coming in his direction from the bateau. It was the riverman who  had  brought to Marie-Anne the news of St. Pierre's arrival. David  went  down to meet him. From the foot of the ridge he again turned  his eyes  in the direction of the raft. St. Pierre and Marie-Anne  were just  about to enter the little cabin built in the center of  the drifting  mass of timber.
