  There are times when death is a shock, but not a grief. And so it   was with Nanette Le Beau. With her own eyes she had looked upon  the  terrible fate of her husband, and it was not in her gentle  soul to  weep or wish him alive again. At last there had overtaken  him what LE  BON DIEU had intended him to receive some day:  justice. And for the  baby's sake more than her own Nanette was not  sorry. Durant, whose  soul was only a little less wicked than the  dead man's, had not even  waited for a prayer&#8212;had not asked her  what to do. He had chopped a  hole in the frozen earth and had  buried Le Beau almost before his body  was cold. And Nanette was  not sorry for that. The Brute was gone. He  was gone for ever. He  would never strike her again. And because of the  baby she offered  up a prayer of gratitude to God. 
  In his prison-cage of sapling bars Miki cringed on his belly at   the end of his chain. He had scarcely moved since those terrible   moments in which he had torn the life out of the man-brute's  throat.  He had not even growled at Durant when he dragged the body  away. Upon  him had fallen a fearful and overwhelming oppression.  He was not  thinking of his own brutal beatings, or of the death  which Le Beau had  been about to inflict upon him with the club; he  did not feel the  presence of pain in his bruised and battered  body, nor in his bleeding  jaws and whip-lashed eyes. He was  thinking of Nanette, the woman. Why  had she run away with that  terrible cry when he killed the man-beast?  Was it not the man-  beast who had struck her down, and whose hands  were at her white  throat when he sprang the length of his chain and  tore out his  jugular? Then why was it that she ran away, and did not  come back? 
  He whimpered softly. 
  The afternoon was almost gone, and the early gloom of mid-winter   night in the Northland was settling thickly over the forests. In  that  gloom the dark face of Durant appeared at the bars of Miki's  prison.  Instinctively Miki had hated this foxhunter from the edge  of the  Barrens, just as he had hated Le Beau, for in their brutish  faces as  well as in their hearts they were like brothers. Yet he  did not growl  at Durant as he peered through. He did not even  move. 
  &quot;UGH! LE DIABLE!&quot; shuddered Durant. 
  Then he laughed. It was a low, terrible laugh, half smothered in   his coarse black beard, and it sent an odd chill through Miki. 
  He turned after that and went into the cabin. 
  Nanette rose to meet him, her great dark eyes glowing in a face   dead white. She had not yet risen above the shock of Le Beau's  tragic  death, and yet in those eyes there was already something  re-born. It  had not been there when Durant came to the cabin with  Le Beau that  afternoon. He looked at her strangely as she stood  with the baby in  her arms. She was another Nanette. He felt  uneasy. Why was it that a  few hours ago he had laughed boldly when  her husband had cursed her  and said vile things in her presence&#8212;  and now he could not meet the  steady gaze of her eyes? DIEU! he  had never before observed how lovely  she was! He drew himself  together, and stated the business in his  mind. 
  &quot;You will not want the dog,&quot; he said. &quot;I will take him away.&quot; 
  Nanette did not answer. She seemed scarcely to be breathing as she   looked at him. It seemed to him that she was waiting for him to   explain; and then the inspiration to lie leapt into his mind. 
  &quot;You know, there was to be the big fight between HIS dog and mine   at Post Fort O' God at the New Year carnival,&quot; he went on,  shuffling  his heavy feet. &quot;For that, Jacques&#8212;your husband&#8212;was  training the  wild dog. And when I saw that OOCHUN&#8212;that wolf  devil&#8212;tearing at the  bars of the cage I knew he would kill my dog  as a fox kills a rabbit.  So we struck a bargain, and for the two  cross foxes and the ten red  which I have outside I bought him.&quot;  (The VRAISEMBLANCE of his lie gave  him courage. It sounded like  truth, and Jacques, the dead man, was not  there to repudiate his  claim.) &quot;So he is mine,&quot; he finished a little  exultantly, &quot;and I  will take him to the Post, and will fight him  against any dog or  wolf in all the North. Shall I bring in the skins,  MADAME?&quot; 
  &quot;He is not for sale,&quot; said Nanette, the glow in her eyes   deepening. &quot;He is my dog&#8212;mine and the baby's. Do you understand,   Henri Durant? HE IS NOT FOR SALE!&quot; 
  &quot;OUI,&quot; gasped Durant, amazed. 
  &quot;And when you reach Post Fort O' God, m'sieu, you will tell LE   FACTEUR that Jacques is dead, and how he died, and say that some  one  must be sent for the baby and me. We will stay here until  then.&quot; 
  &quot;OUI,&quot; said Durant again, backing to the door. 
  He had never seen her like that. He wondered how Jacques Le Beau   could swear at her, and strike her. For himself, he was afraid.   Standing there with those wonderful eyes and white face, with the   baby in her arms, and her shining hair over her breasts, she made  him  think of a picture he had once seen of the Blessed Lady. 
  He went out through the door and back to the sapling cage where   Miki lay. Softly he spoke through the bars. 
  &quot;OW, BETE&quot; he called; &quot;she will not sell you. She keeps you   because you fought for her, and killed MON AMI, Jacques Le Beau.  And  so I must take you my own way. In a little while the moon will  be up,  and then I will slip a noose over your head at the end of a  pole, and  will choke you so quickly she will not hear a sound. And  who will know  where you are gone, if the cage door is left open?  And you will fight  for me at Post Fort 0' God. MON DIEU! how you  will fight! I swear it  will do the ghost of Jacques Le Beau good  to see what happens there.&quot; 
  He went away, to where he had left his light sledge and two dogs   in the edge of the timber, and waited for the moon to rise. 
  Still Miki did not move, A light had appeared in the window of the   cabin, and his eyes were fixed on it yearningly as the low whine   gathered in his throat again. His world no longer lay beyond that   window. The Woman and the baby had obliterated in him all desire  but  to be with them. 
  In the cabin Nanette was thinking of him&#8212;and of Durant. The man's   words came to her again, vividly, significantly: &quot;YOU WILL NOT  WANT  THE DOG.&quot; Yes, all the forest people would say that same  thing&#8212;even  LE FACTEUR himself, when he heard. SHE WOULD NOT WANT  THE DOG! And why  not? Because he had killed Jacques Le Beau, her  husband, in defence of  her? Because he had freed her from the  bondage of The Brute? Because  God had sent him to the end of his  chain in that terrible moment that  the baby Nanette might live, as  the OTHER had not, and that she might  grow up with laughter on her  lips instead of sobs? In her there rose  suddenly a thought that  fanned the new flame in her heart. It MUST  have been LE BON DIEU!  Others might doubt, but she&#8212;never. She  recalled all that Le Beau  had told her about the wild dog&#8212;how for  many days he had robbed  the traps, and the terrific fight he had made  when at last he was  caught. And of all that The Brute had said there  stood out most  the words he had spoken one day. 
  &quot;He is a devil, but he was not born of wolf. NON, some time, a   long time ago, he was a white man's dog.&quot; 
  A WHITE MAN'S DOG! 
  Her soul thrilled. Once&#8212;a long time ago&#8212;he had known a master   with a white heart, just as she had known a girlhood in which the   flowers bloomed and the birds sang. She tried to look back, but  she  could not see very far. She could not vision that day, less  than a  year ago, when Miki, an angular pup, came down out of the  Farther  North with Challoner; she could not vision the strange  comradeship  between the pup and Neewa, the little black bear cub,  nor that tragic  day when they had fallen out of Challoner's canoe  into the swift  stream that had carried them over the waterfall and  into the Great  Adventure which had turned Neewa into a grown bear  and Miki into a  wild dog. But in her heart she FELT the things  which she could not  see. Miki had not come by chance. Something  greater than that had sent  him. 
  She rose quietly, so that she would not waken the baby in the   crib, and opened the door. The moon was just rising over the  forest  and through the glow of it she went to the cage. She heard  the dog's  joyous whine, and then she felt the warm caress of his  tongue upon her  bare hands as she thrust them between the sapling  bars. 
  &quot;NON, NON; you are not a devil,&quot; she cried softly, her voice   filled with a strange tremble. &quot;O-o-ee, my SOKETAAO, I prayed,   PRAYED&#8212;and you came. Yes, on my knees each night I prayed to Our   Blessed Lady that she might have mercy on my baby, and make the  sun  in heaven shine for her through all time. AND YOU CAME! And  the dear  God does not send devils in answer to prayer. NON;  never!&quot; 
  And Miki, as though some spirit had given him the power to   understand, rested the weight of his bruised and beaten head on  her  hands. 
  From the edge of the forest Durant was watching. He had caught the   flash of light from the door and had seen Nanette go to the cage,  and  his eyes did not leave her until she returned into the cabin.  He  laughed as he went to his fire and finished making the WAHGUN  he was  fastening to the end of a long pole. This WAHGUN and the  pole added to  his own cleverness were saving him twelve good fox  skins, and he  continued to chuckle there in the fireglow as he  thought how easy it  was to beat a woman's wits. Nanette was a fool  to refuse the pelts,  and Jacques was&#8212;dead. It was a most lucky  combination of  circumstances for him. Fortune had surely come his  way. On LE BETE, as  he called the wild dog, he would gamble all  that he possessed in the  big fight. And he would win. 
  He waited until the light in the cabin went out before he   approached the cage again. Miki heard him coming. At a  considerable  distance he saw him, for the moon was already turning  the night into  day. Durant knew the ways of dogs. With them he  employed a superior  reason where Le Beau had used the club and the  rawhide. So he came up  openly and boldly, and, as if by accident,  dropped the end of the pole  between the bars. With his hands  against the cage, apparently  unafraid, he began talking in a  casual way. He was different from Le  Beau. Miki watched him  closely for a space and then let his eyes rest  again on the  darkened cabin window. Stealthily Durant began to take  advantage  of his opportunity. A little at a time he moved the end of  the  pole until it was over Miki's head, with the deadly bowstring and   its open noose hanging down. He was an adept in the use of the   WAHGUN. Many foxes and wolves, and even a bear, he had caught that   way. Miki, numbed by the cold, scarcely felt the BABICHE noose as  it  settled softly about his neck. He did not see Durant brace  himself,  with his feet against the running-log of the cage. 
  Then, suddenly, Durant lurched himself backward, and it seemed to   Miki as though a giant trap of steel had closed about his neck.   Instantly his wind was cut off. He could make no sound as he   struggled frantically to free himself. Hand over hand Durant  dragged  him to the bars, and there, with his feet still braced, he  choked with  his whole weight until&#8212;when at last he let up on the  WAHGUN&#8212;Miki  collapsed as if dead. Ten seconds later Durant was  looping a muzzle  over his closed jaws. He left the cage door open  when he went back to  his sledge, carrying Miki in his arms.  Nanette's slow wits would never  guess, he told himself. She would  think that LE BETE had escaped into  the forest. 
  It was not his scheme to club Miki into serfdom, as Le Beau had   failed to do. Durant was wiser than that. In his crude and  merciless  way he had come to know certain phenomena of the animal  mind. He was  not a psychologist; oh the other hand brutality had  not utterly  blinded him. So, instead of lashing Miki to the sledge  as Le Beau had  fastened him to his improvised drag, Durant made  his captive  comfortable, covering him with a warm blanket before  he began his  journey eastward. He made sure, however, that there  was no flaw in the  muzzle about Miki's jaws, and that the free end  of the chain to which  he was still fastened was well hitched to  the Gee-bar of his sledge. 
  When these things were done Durant set off in the direction of   Fort O' God, and if Jacques Le Beau could have seen him then he  would  have had good reason to guess at his elation. By taint of  birth and  blood Durant was a gambler first, and a trapper  afterward. He set his  traps that he might have the thrill of  wagering his profits, and for  half a dozen successive years he had  won at the big annual dog fight  at Post Fort O' God. But this year  he had been half afraid. His fear  had not been of Jacques Le Beau  and Netah, but of the halfbreed away  over on Red Belly Lake.  Grouse Piet was the halfbreed's name, and the  &quot;dog&quot; that he was  going to put up at the fight was half wolf.  Therefore, in the  foolish eagerness of his desire, had Durant offered  two cross  foxes and ten reds&#8212;the price of five dogs and not one&#8212;for  the  possession of Le Beau's wild dog. And now that he had him for   nothing, and Nanette was poorer by twelve skins, he was happy. For  he  had now a good match for Grouse Piet's half wolf, and he would  chance  his money and his credit at the Post to the limit. 
  When Miki came back to his senses Durant stopped his dogs, for he   had been watching closely for this moment. He bent over the sledge   and began talking, not in Le Beau's brutal way, but in a careless   chummy sort of voice, and with his mittened hand he patted his   captive's head. This was a new thing to Miki, for he knew that it  was  not the hand of Nanette, but of a man-beast, and the softness  of his  nest in the blanket, over which Henri had thrown a bear  skin, was also  new. A short time ago he was frozen and stiff. Now  he was warm and  comfortable. So he did not move. And Durant  exulted in his cleverness.  He did not travel far in the night, but  stopped four or five miles  from Nanette's cabin, and built a fire.  Over this he boiled coffee and  roasted meat. He allowed the meat  to roast slowly, turning it round  and round on a wooden spit, so  that the aroma of it grew thick and  inviting in the air. He had  fastened his two sledge dogs fifty paces  away, but the sledge was  close to the fire, and he watched the effect  on Miki of the  roasting meat. Since the days of his puppyhood with  Challoner a  smell like that which came from the meat had not filled  Miki's  nostrils, and at last Durant saw him lick his chops and heard  the  click of his teeth. He chuckled in his beard. Still he waited   another quarter of an hour. Then he pulled the meat off the spit,  cut  it up, and gave a half of it to Miki. And Miki ate it  ravenously. 
  A clever man was Henri Durant!
