  After the fight in the coulee there was no longer a thought on the   part of Neewa and Miki of returning to the Garden of Eden in which   the black currants grew so lusciously. From the tip of his tail to   the end of his nose Miki was an adventurer, and like the nomadic   rovers of old he was happiest when on the move. The wilderness had   claimed him now, body and soul, and it is probable that he would  have  shunned a human camp at this stage of his life, even as Neewa  would  have shunned it. But in the lives of beasts, as well as in  the lives  of men, Fate plays her pranks and tricks, and even as  they turned into  the vast and mystery-filled spaces of the great  lake and  waterway-country, to the west, events were slowly shaping  themselves  into what was to be perhaps the darkest hour of gloom  in the life of  Miki, son of Hela. 
  Through six glorious and sun-filled weeks of late summer and early   autumn&#8212;until the middle of September&#8212;Miki and Neewa ranged the   country westward, always heading toward the setting sun, the  country  of Jackson's Knee, of the Touchwood and the Clearwater,  and God's  Lake. In this country they saw many things. It was a  region a hundred  miles square which the handiwork of Nature had  made into a veritable  kingdom of the wild. They came upon great  beaver colonies in the dark  and silent places; they watched the  otter at play; they came upon  moose and caribou so frequently that  they no longer feared or evaded  them, but walked out openly into  the meadows or down to the edge of  the swamps where they were  feeding. It was here that Miki learned the  great lesson that claw  and fang were made to prey upon cloven hoof and  horn, for the  wolves were thick, and a dozen times they came upon  their kills,  and even more frequently heard the wild tongue of the  hunting-  packs. Since his experience with Maheegun he no longer had  the  desire to join them. And now Neewa no longer insisted on remaining   near meat when they found it. It was the beginning of the KWASKA-  HAO  in Neewa&#8212;the instinctive sensing of the Big Change. 
  Until early in October Miki could see but little of this change in   his comrade. It was then that Neewa became more and more restless,   and this restlessness grew as the chill nights came, and autumn   breathed more heavily in the air. It was Neewa who took the lead  in  their peregrinations now, and he seemed always to be questing  for  something&#8212;a mysterious something which Miki could neither  smell nor  see. He no longer slept for hours at a time. By mid-  October he slept  scarcely at all, but roved through most of the  hours of night as well  as day, eating, eating, eating, and always  smelling the wind for that  elusive thing which Nature was  commanding him to seek and find.  Ceaselessly he was nosing under  windfalls and among the rocks, and  Miki was always near him,  always on the QUI VIVE for battle with the  thing that Neewa was  hunting out. And it seemed to be never found. 
  Then Neewa turned back to the east, drawn by the instinct of his   forefathers; back toward the country of Noozak, his mother, and of   Soominitik, his father; and Miki followed. The nights grew more  and  more chill. The stars seemed farther away, and no longer was  the  forest moon red like blood. The cry of the loon had a moaning  note in  it, a note of grief and lamentation. And in their shacks  and tepees  the forest people sniffed the air of frosty mornings,  and soaked their  traps in fish-oil and beaver-grease, and made  their moccasins, and  mended snow-shoe and sledge, for the cry of  the loon said that winter  was creeping down out of the North. And  the swamps grew silent. The  cow moose no longer mooed to her  young. In place of it, from the open  plain and &quot;burn&quot; rose the  defiant challenge of bull to bull and the  deadly clash of horn  against horn under the stars of night. The wolf  no longer howled  to hear his voice. In the travel of padded feet there  came to be a  slinking, hunting caution. In all the forest world blood  was  running red again. 
  And then&#8212;November. 
  Perhaps Miki would never forget that first day when the snow came.   At first he thought all the winged things in the world were  shedding  their white feathers. Then he felt the fine, soft touch  of it under  his feet, and the chill. It sent the blood rushing  like a new kind of  fire through his body; a wild and thrilling  joy&#8212;the exultation that  leaps through the veins of the wolf when  the winter comes. 
  With Neewa its effect was different&#8212;so different that even Miki   felt the oppression of it, and waited vaguely and anxiously for  what  was to come. And then, on this day of the first snow, he saw  his  comrade do a strange and unaccountable thing. He began to eat  things  that he had never touched as food before. He lapped up soft  pine  needles, and swallowed them. He ate of the dry, pulpy  substance of  rotted logs. And then he went into a great cleft  broken into the heart  of a rocky ridge, and found at last the  thing for which he had been  seeking. It was a cavern&#8212;deep, and  dark, and warm. 
  Nature works in strange ways. She gives to the birds of the air   eyes which men may never have, and she gives to the beasts of the   earth an instinct which men may never know. For Neewa had come  back  to sleep his first Long Sleep in the place of his birth&#8212;the  cavern in  which Noozak, his mother, had brought him into the  world. 
  His old bed was still there, the wallow in the soft sand, the   blanket of hair Noozak had shed; but the smell of his mother was   gone. In the nest where he was born Neewa lay down, and for the  last  time he grunted softly to Miki. It was as if he felt upon him  the  touch of a hand, gentle but inevitable, which he could no  longer  refuse to obey, and to Miki was saying, for the last time:   &quot;Good-night!&quot; 
  That night the PIPOO KESTIN&#8212;the first storm of  winter&#8212;came like  an avalanche from out of the North. With it came  a wind that was like  the roaring of a thousand bulls, and over all  the land of the wild  there was nothing that moved. Even in the  depth of the cavern Miki  heard the beat and the wail of it and the  swishing of the shot-like  snow beyond the door through which they  had come, and he snuggled  close to Neewa, content that they had  found shelter. 
  With the day he went to the slit in the face of the rock, and in   his astonishment he made no sound, but stared forth upon a world  that  was no longer the world he had left last night. Everywhere it  was  white&#8212;a dazzling, eye-blinding white. The sun had risen. It  shot a  thousand flashing shafts of radiant light into Miki's eyes.  So far as  his vision could reach the earth was as if covered with  a robe of  diamonds. From rock and tree and shrub blazed the fire  of the sun; it  quivered in the tree-tops, bent low with their  burden of snow; it was  like a sea in the valley, so vivid that the  unfrozen stream running  through the heart of it was black. Never  had Miki seen a day so  magnificent. Never had his heart pounded at  the sight of the sun as it  pounded now, and never had his blood  burned with a wilder exultation.  He whined, and ran back to Neewa.  He barked in the gloom of the cavern  and gave his comrade a nudge  with his nose. Neewa grunted sleepily. He  stretched himself,  raised his head for an instant, and then curled  himself into a  ball again. Vainly Miki protested that it was day, and  time for  them to be moving. Neewa made no response, and after a while  Miki  returned to the mouth of the cavern, and looked back to see if   Neewa was following him. Then, disappointed, he went out into the   snow. For an hour he did not move farther than ten feet away from  the  den. Three times he returned to Neewa and urged him to get up  and come  out where it was light. In that far corner of the cavern  it was dark,  and it was as if he were trying to tell Neewa that he  was a dunce to  lie there still thinking it was night when the sun  was up outside. But  he failed. Neewa was in the edge of his Long  Sleep&#8212;the beginning of  USKE-POW-A-MEW, the dream land of the  bears. 
  Annoyance, the desire almost to sink his teeth in Neewa's ear,   gave place slowly to another thing in Miki. The instinct that  between  beasts is like the spoken reason of men stirred in a  strange and  disquieting way within him. He became more and more  uneasy. There was  almost distress in his restlessness as he  hovered about the mouth of  the cavern. A last time he went to  Neewa, and then he started alone  down into the valley. 
  He was hungry, but on this first day after the storm there was   small chance of him finding anything to eat. The snowshoe rabbits   were completely buried under their windfalls and shelters, and lay   quietly in their warm nests. Nothing had moved during the hours of   the storm. There were no trails of living things for him to  follow,  and in places he sank to his shoulders in the soft snow.  He made his  way to the creek. It was no longer the creek he had  known. It was  edged with ice. There was something dark and  brooding about it now.  The sound it made was no longer the  rippling song of summer and golden  autumn. There was a threat in  its gurgling monotone&#8212;a new voice, as  if a black and forbidding  spirit had taken possession of it and was  warning him that the  times had changed, and that new laws and a new  force had come to  claim sovereignty in the land of his birth. 
  He drank of the water cautiously. It was cold&#8212;ice-cold. Slowly it   was being impinged upon him that in the beauty of this new world  that  was his there was no longer the warm and pulsing beat of the  heart  that was life. He was alone. ALONE! Everything else was  covered up;  everything else seemed dead. 
  He went back to Neewa and lay close to him all through the day.   And through the night that followed he did not move again from the   cavern. He went only as far as the door and saw celestial spaces   ablaze with stars and a moon that rode up into the heavens like a   white sun. They, too, seemed no longer like the moon and stars he  had  known. They were terribly still and cold. And under them the  earth was  terribly white and silent. 
  With the coming of dawn he tried once more to awaken Neewa. But   this time he was not so insistent. Nor did he have the desire to  nip  Neewa with his teeth. Something had happened&#8212;something which  he could  not understand. He sensed the thing, but he could not  reason it. And  he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear. 
  He went down again to hunt. Under the glory of the moon and stars   it had been a wild night of carnival for the rabbits, and in the  edge  of the timber Miki found the snow beaten hard in places with  their  tracks. It was not difficult for him to stalk his breakfast  this  morning. He made his kill, and feasted. He killed again after  that,  and still again. He could have gone on killing, for now that  the snow  betrayed them, the hiding-places of the rabbits were so  many traps for  them. Miki's courage returned. He was fired again  with the joy of  life. Never had he known such hunting, never had  he found such a  treasure-house before&#8212;not even in the coulee  where the currants grew.  He ate until he could eat no more, and  then he went back to Neewa,  carrying with him one of the rabbits  he had slain. He dropped it in  front of his comrade, and whined.  Even then Neewa did not respond,  except to draw a deeper breath,  and change his position a little. 
  That afternoon, for the first time in many hours, Neewa rose to   his feet, stretched himself, and sniffed of the dead rabbit. But  he  did not eat. To Miki's consternation he rolled himself round  and round  in his nest of sand and went to sleep again. 
  The next day, at about the same time, Neewa roused himself once   more. This time he went as far as the mouth of the den, and lapped  up  a few mouthfuls of snow. But he still refused to eat the  rabbit. Again  it was Nature telling him that he must not disturb  the pine needles  and dry bark with which he had padded his stomach  and intestines. And  he went to sleep again. He did not get up  after that. 
  Day followed day, and, growing lonelier as the winter deepened,   Miki hunted alone. All through November he came back each night  and  slept with Neewa. And Neewa was as if dead, except that his  body was  warm, and he breathed, and made little sounds now and  then in his  throat. But this did not satisfy the great yearning  that was becoming  more and more insistent in Miki's soul, the  overwhelming desire for  company, for a brotherhood on the trail.  He loved Neewa. Through the  first long weeks of winter he returned  to him faithfully; he brought  him meat. He was filled with a  strange grief&#8212;even greater than if  Neewa had been dead. For Miki  knew that he was alive, and he could not  account for the thing  that had happened. Death he would have  understood, and FROM death  he would have gone away&#8212;for good. 
  So it came that one night, having hunted far, Miki remained away   from the den for the first time, and slept under a deep windfall.   After that it was still harder for him to resist the CALL. A  second  and a third night he went away; and then came the time&#8212;  inevitable as  the coming and going of the moon and stars&#8212;when  understanding at last  broke its way through his hope and his fear,  and something told him  that Neewa would never again travel with  him as through those glorious  days of old, when shoulder to  shoulder they had faced together the  comedies and tragedies of  life in a world that was no longer soft and  green and warm with a  golden sun, but white, and still, and filled  with death. 
  Neewa did not know when Miki went away from the den for the last   time. And yet it may be that even in his slumber the Beneficent   Spirit may have whispered that Miki was going, for there were   restlessness and disquiet in Neewa's dreamland for many days   thereafter. 
  &quot;Be quiet&#8212;and sleep!&quot; the Spirit may have whispered. &quot;The Winter   is long. The rivers are black and chill, the lakes are covered  with  floors of ice, and the waterfalls are frozen like great white  giants.  Sleep! For Miki must go his way, just as the waters of the  streams  must go their way to the sea. For he is Dog. And you are  Bear. SLEEP!&quot;
