  Abner Holden's reflections, when he found himself left alone in  Ralph's  cabin, bound hand and foot, were not of the most agreeable  nature. It  was humiliating to find himself baffled at every point,  and, for once,  completely defeated in his attempt to exercise his  authority over the  boy who had been bound to him. 
  That Herbert should escape from him beyond the chance of recovery  seemed  now almost certain. If he were free, something might be done.  But he was  so securely bound that it was impossible to get free  without help, and  the lonely situation of the cabin made it very  doubtful whether anyone  would come within hearing until the return of  Ralph himself. When that  would be was uncertain. 
  Three hours passed, and still no prospect of release. The bonds  chafed  his wrists, and his situation was far from comfortable. He  tried to  loosen the cords, but without success. 
  &quot;Must I stay here all night?&quot; he thought, in alarm. 
  But deliverance was at hand, though its first approach was  disagreeable. 
  A large dog entered the cabin through the open door, drawn thither,   probably, by curiosity. When he saw Abner he appeared to take a  dislike  to him, and barked vehemently. 
  &quot;Go away, you brute!&quot; said Abner, wrathfully. 
  The dog, however, appeared instinctively to understand that Abner  Holden  was able only to threaten him, and barked more furiously than  before;  sometimes approaching within a foot of the helpless prisoner,  and  showing a formidable row of teeth, which Abner feared every moment  might  fasten upon his arm or leg. 
  Abner Holden was not a man of courage. Though his disposition was  that  of a bully, he was easily frightened, and the fierce look of the  dog  alarmed him not a little. In fact, it might have tested the  courage of a  much braver man than Mr. Holden. 
  &quot;Go away!&quot; he shrieked, shrinking back as far as he could from the  open  mouth of his persecutor. 
  A hoarse bark was the only reply, and the dog made an artful  spring,  which was only a feint, but had too much the appearance of  earnest to  suit his enemy. 
  &quot;Oh, will nobody save me from the brute?&quot; groaned Abner, in an  ecstasy  of terror. &quot;If I could only get my hands loose!&quot; and he tugged   frantically at the cord. 
  Feeling how utterly he was at a disadvantage, he condescended to  coax  his fierce antagonist. 
  &quot;Be quiet, that's a good dog,&quot; he said, with hypocritical softness. 
  The dog noticed a change in his tone, and evidently viewed it with  some  suspicion. Still his bark became less fierce and his looks less   threatening. 
  &quot;Good dog!&quot; repeated Abner, in wheedling tones. &quot;There's some  dinner.&quot; 
  And he pushed over the provisions which Ralph had left. 
  While the dog was apparently taking his offer into consideration, a   boy's voice was heard outside, calling &quot;Carlo, Carlo!&quot; 
  The dog pricked up his ears and ran out of the cabin. 
  &quot;So you are here, you truant,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Why did you run away?  What  have you to say for yourself, sir?&quot; 
  The dog answered by a wag of his tail. 
  &quot;Oh, yes, you may wag your tail, but I've a great mind to punish  you for  running away, and putting me to the trouble of finding you.&quot; 
  &quot;Hello!&quot; cried Abner, in a loud voice. 
  &quot;Who's that?&quot; thought the boy, surprised. 
  As the voice evidently came from within the cabin, he ventured to  the  door, and looked in. He was considerably surprised to see Abner  Holden,  whom he knew well by sight, lying bound hand and foot in the  corner. 
  &quot;Is that you, Mr. Holden?&quot; he asked, in a tone of surprise. 
  &quot;Of course it is,&quot; said Abner, who was not in a very pleasant frame  of  mind. 
  &quot;Are you tied?&quot; 
  &quot;Don't you see I am?&quot; snarled Abner. 
  &quot;Who tied you?&quot; 
  &quot;That rascal Ralph. I mean to have him hung, if I live.&quot; 
  &quot;Ralph! Why, I thought he was quiet and peaceable.&quot; 
  &quot;He tried to murder me, but changed his mind, and tied me, as you  see.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't understand it.&quot; 
  &quot;There is no need of understanding it. Come and unfasten these  cords. I  feel stiff and cramped.&quot; 
  The boy tried to unfasten the cord, but it was too securely tied. 
  &quot;Where is your knife?&quot; 
  &quot;I haven't got any.&quot; 
  &quot;Then take the axe.&quot; 
  There was an axe standing at the corner of the room. This the boy  got,  and, with the keen edge, severed the string. 
  Abner stretched himself to relieve his cramped limbs. Then he  bethought  himself of his late persecutor. 
  &quot;Is that your dog?&quot; he asked, surveying his four-legged enemy with  no  friendly expression. 
  &quot;Yes, that's Carlo. Come here, Carlo.&quot; 
  &quot;He's been in here barking at me, and threatening to bite me, and  now  I'll have my revenge.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; inquired the boy, in alarm, as Abner seized the  axe  and swung it over his head. 
  &quot;Stand aside, boy!&quot; 
  &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm going to kill that brute.&quot; 
  &quot;No, no, he's a good dog. He won't do any harm,&quot; said the boy, in  alarm. 
  &quot;I'll kill him,&quot; said Abner, fiercely. 
  The dog surveyed his enemy with suspicion. He seemed to understand  that  danger menaced him. He growled in a low, hoarse, ominous tone,  which  showed that he was on his guard, and meant to do his part of the   fighting, if necessary. 
  His owner had retreated to the door, and now tried to call him  away. 
  &quot;Carlo, Carlo, come out here, sir.&quot; 
  But Carlo would not come. He had no intention of shrinking from the   danger that threatened him, but was bent on defending himself, as  became  a brave and dauntless dog, whose courage was above suspicion. 
  If Abner had not been so exasperated, he might have been terrified,  but  anger re-enforced his courage, and, moreover, he had a great deal  of  confidence that the axe which he held in his hand would make him  more  than a match for the dog. 
  &quot;I'll kill him!&quot; he exclaimed, and once more he swung the axe over  his  head, and brought it down with a tremendous force in the direction  of  the dog. 
  Alas for poor Carlo, if the axe had struck him! But he was wary,  and  knew something of warlike tactics, and with watchful eye carefully  noted  Abner's movements. The boy uttered a cry of alarm at the peril  of his  favorite, but Carlo sprang to one side just as the axe  descended, and it  was buried in the earthen floor of the cabin so  deeply that Abner could  not immediately recover it. 
  The advantage was thus transferred to the other side, and the dog  was  not slow in perceiving it. 
  With a bound he sprang upon his adversary, and bore him to the  floor,  seizing his coat between his strong teeth. He pulled and tugged  at this  with a strength which no ordinary cloth could possibly  withstand. 
  &quot;Take him off! take him off!&quot; shrieked Abner in terror. 
  The boy sprang to the rescue. 
  &quot;Come away, Carlo,&quot; he said, grasping him by the collar; &quot;come  away,  that's a good dog.&quot; 
  But, habitually obedient as Carlo was, his young master found it   difficult to get him away. He felt that he had received a grievous   injury&#8212;that his life had been attempted&#8212;and he wanted to have   satisfaction. Finally his master succeeded in drawing him away, but  not  till Mr. Holden's coat was badly torn. 
  The latter was crestfallen and angry, and not so grateful as he  ought to  have been to his young defender. 
  &quot;I'll make your father pay for this coat, you young rascal!&quot; he  said. 
  &quot;It isn't my fault, Mr. Holden,&quot; said the boy. 
  &quot;Yes, it is. It was your dog that tore my coat.&quot; 
  &quot;Carlo wouldn't have torn it, if you hadn't attacked him.&quot; 
  &quot;He attacked me first.&quot; 
  &quot;You had better go away, Mr. Holden, or he may go at you again.&quot; 
  A low growl from the dog whom he held by the collar re-enforced  this  suggestion, and Abner, uttering threats both against the dog and  his  master, strode out of the cabin and bent his steps homeward. 
  As he entered the kitchen, the housekeeper turned, and, noticing  his  torn coat, exclaimed, &quot;Good gracious, Mr. Holden, what's happened  to  you? How came your coat so badly torn?&quot; 
  &quot;It was a dog,&quot; muttered Abner, who did not care to be questioned. 
  Mrs. Bickford supposed he must have taken off the coat, and the dog  had  torn it as it lay upon the ground. 
  &quot;What a pity!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Whose dog was it?&quot; 
  &quot;Alfred Martin's. I'll make Martin pay for the coat. He has no  right to  keep such a brute.&quot; 
  &quot;You must be hungry, Mr. Holden.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, get me something as quick as possible.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you seen anything of Herbert?&quot; asked the housekeeper. 
  &quot;No,&quot; snapped Abner. 
  This was a falsehood, of course, but he felt rather ashamed to  confess  that he had seen Herbert, and that the latter had got the  better of him.  Mrs. Bickford perceived that he was out of humor, and  did not press the  question. She concluded that he was angry because  his quest had been  unsuccessful.
