Hamilton reentered New York to the blaze of bonfires, the salute of  cannon, and the deafening shouts of a multitude that escorted him to his  doorway. Betsey was so proud of him she hardly could speak for a day,  and his library was flooded with letters of congratulation from all  parts of the Union. For several days he shut himself up with his family  and a few friends, for he needed the rest; and the relaxation was  paradisal. He played marbles and spun tops with his oldest boys, and  dressed and undressed Angelica's doll as often as his imperious daughter  commanded. Troup and Fish, now the dignified Adjutant-General of State,  with his bang grown long and his hair brushed back, spent hours with him  in the heavy shades of the garden, or tormenting a monkey on the other  side of the fence. Madison came at once to wrangle with him over the  temporary seat of government, and demanded the spare bedroom, protesting  he had too much to say to waste time travelling back and forth. He was a  welcome guest; and he, too, sat on the floor and dressed Angelica's  doll.    
The city was <i>en fete</i>, and little business was transacted except at the  public houses. Bands of citizens awoke Hamilton from his sleep, shouting  for "Alexander the Great." Anti-Federalists got so drunk that they  embraced the Federalists, and sang on Hamilton's doorstep. The hero  retreated to the back room on the top floor. The climax came on the 5th  of August, in the great procession, with which, after the fashion of  other triumphant cities, New York was to demonstrate in honour of the  victory of the Constitution.    
But, unlike its predecessors, this procession was as much in honour of  one man as of the triumph of a great principle. To have persuaded New  York, at that time, that Hamilton had not written the Constitution, and  secured its ratification in the eleven States of the Union by his  unaided efforts, would have been a dissipation of energy in August which  even Clinton would not have attempted. To them Hamilton was the  Constitution, Federalism, the genius of the new United States. And he  was their very own. "Virginia has her Madison," they reiterated,  "Massachusetts her Adamses--and may she keep them and be damned; other  States may think they have produced a giant, and those that do not can  fall back on Washington; but Hamilton is ours, we adore him, we are so  proud of him we are like to burst, and we can never express our  gratitude, try as we may; so we'll show him an honour that no other  State has thought of showing to any particular man."    
And of the sixth of New York's thirty thousand inhabitants that turned  out on that blazing August day and marched for hours, that all the  eager city might see, at least two-thirds bore a banner emblazoned with  Hamilton's portrait or name, held on high. The procession was  accompanied by a military escort; and every profession, every trade, was  represented. A large proportion of the men who marched were gentlemen.  Nicolas Fish was on the staff of the grand marshal, with six of his  friends. Robert Troup and two other prominent lawyers bore, on a  cushion, the new Constitution, magnificently engrossed. Nicolas Cruger,  Hamilton's old employer, again a resident of New York, led the farmers,  driving a plough drawn by three yoke of oxen. Baron Polnitz displayed  the wonders of the newly perfected threshing-machine. John Watts, a man  who had grown gray in the highest offices of New York, before and since  the Revolution, guided a harrow, drawn by horses and oxen. The  president, regents, professors, and students of Columbia College, all in  academic dress, were followed by the Chamber of Commerce and the members  of the bar. The many societies, led by the Cincinnati, followed, each  bearing an appropriate banner.    
And in the very centre of that pageant, gorgeous in colour and costume,  from the green of the foresters to the white of the florists, was the  great Federal ship, with HAMILTON, HAMILTON, HAMILTON, HAMILTON,  emblazoned on every side of it. In the memory of the youngest present  there was to be but one other procession in New York so imposing, and  that, too, was in honour of Hamilton.    
He stood on a balcony in the Broadway, with his family, Madison, Baron  Steuben, and the Schuylers, bowing constantly to the salutes and cheers.  Nicolas Cruger looked up and grinned. Fish winked decorously, and Troup  attempted a salaam, and nearly dropped the Constitution. But Hamilton's  mind served him a trick for a moment; the vivid procession, with his  face and name fluttering above five thousand heads, the compact mass of  spectators, proud and humble, that crowded the pavements and waved their  handkerchiefs toward him, the patriotically decorated windows filled  with eager, often beautiful, faces, disappeared, and he stood in front  of Cruger's store on Bay Street, with his hands in his linen pockets,  gazing out over a blinding glare of water, passionately wishing for the  war-ship which never came, to deliver him from his Island prison and  carry him to the gates of the real world beyond. He had been an  ambitious boy, but nothing in his imaginings had projected him to the  dizzy eminence on which he stood to-day. He was recalled by the salute  of the Federal ship's thirteen guns to the president of the Congress and  its members, who stood on the fort in the Battery.    
After all, perhaps it was the proudest and the happiest day of his  career, for the depths in his nature still slumbered, the triumph was  without alloy; and he knew that there were other heights to scale, and  that he should scale them. It was the magnificent and spontaneous  tribute of an intelligent people to an enlightened patriotism, to years  of severe and unselfish thought; and hardly an enemy grudged him his  deserts. The wild feeling of exultant triumph which surged behind his  smiling face receded before the rising swell of the profoundest  gratitude he had ever known.    
The day finished with a great banquet at Mr. Bayard's country-seat, near  Grand Street, where tables were spread for six thousand persons, in a  pavilion surmounted by an image of Fame, and decorated with the colours  of the nations that had formed treaties with the United States. Later,  there was a grand display of fireworks.
