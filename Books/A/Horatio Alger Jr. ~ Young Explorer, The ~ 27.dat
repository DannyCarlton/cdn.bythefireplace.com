    Leaving Ben and his companion for a time, we go back to record an   incident which will prove to have a bearing upon the fortunes of   those in whom we are interested. 
  One morning two men, Taylor and O'Reilly, who had been out   prospecting, came into camp, conveying between them, very much as  two  policemen conduct a prisoner, a terrifled-looking Chinaman,  whose  eyes, rolling helplessly from one to the other, seemed to  indicate  that he considered his position a very perilous one. 
  At that early period in the settlement of California, a few  Chinamen  had found their way to the Pacific coast; but the full tide  of  immigration did not set in till a considerable time later, and,   therefore, the miners regarded one as a curiosity. 
  &quot;Who have you got there, O'Reilly?&quot; inquired one of his   mining-comrades. 
  &quot;A yeller haythen!&quot; answered O'Eeilly. &quot;Look at the craythur! Ain't   he a beauty jist wid his long pigtail hangin' down his back like a   monkey's tail?&quot; 
  &quot;Where did you find him?&quot; 
  &quot;He was huntin' for gold, the haythen, jist for all the world as if   he was as white as you or I.&quot; 
  Mr. Patrick O'Reilly appeared to hold the opinion that gold-hunting   should be confined to the Caucasian race. He looked upon a Chinaman   as rather a superior order of monkey, suitable for exhibition in a   cage, but not to be regarded as possessing the ordinary rights of an   adopted American resident. If he could have looked forward   twenty-five years, and foreseen the extent to which these barbarians   would throng the avenues of employment, he would, no doubt, have  been  equally amazed and disgusted. Indeed, the capture of Ki Sing  was made  through his influence, as Taylor, a man from Ohio, was  disposed to let  him alone. 
  Soon a crowd gathered around the terrified Chinaman and his  captors,  and he was plied with questions, some of a jocular character,  by the  miners, who were glad of anything that relieved the monotony of   their ordinary life. 
  &quot;What's your name?&quot; asked one. 
  The Chinaman gazed at the questioner vacantly. 
  &quot;What's your name, you haythen?&quot; repeated O'Reilly, emphasizing the   inquiry by a powerful shake. 
  &quot;My name Ki Sing,&quot; answered the Mongolian nervously. 
  &quot;Where did you come from, old pigtail?&quot; 
  &quot;My name Ki Sing, not Pigtail,&quot; said the Chinaman, not  understanding  the meaning of the epithet. 
  This answer appeared to be regarded by the crowd as either witty or   absurd, for it elicited a roar of laughter. 
  &quot;Never mind what your name is, old stick in the mud! We'll call you   whatever we please. Where do you come from?&quot; 
  &quot;Me come from 'Flisco.&quot; 
  It is well known that a Chinaman cannot pronounce the letter r,   which in his mouth softens to l, in some cases producing a ludicrous   effect. 
  &quot;What have you come here for, Cy King, or whatever your name is.&quot; 
  &quot;My name Ki Sing.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, it's a haythen name; anyhow,&quot; remarked Mr. Patrick O'Eeilly.   &quot;Before I'd have such a name, I'd go widout one intirely. Did you   hear the gintleman ask you what you came here for?&quot; 
  &quot;You bling me,&quot; answered Ki Sing shrewdly. 
  There was another laugh. 
  &quot;That Chinee ain't no fool!&quot; said Dick Roberts. 
  &quot;What made you leave China?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Me come to Amelica fol gold.&quot; 
  &quot;Hi, ho! That's it, is it? What are you going to do with your gold   when you find it?&quot; 
  &quot;Cally it back to China.&quot; 
  &quot;And when you've callied it back, what'll you do then?&quot; 
  &quot;Me mally wife, have good time and plenty money to buy lice.&quot; 
  Of course, Ki Sing's meaning was plain, but there was a roar of   laughter, to which he listened with mild-eyed wonder, evidently   thinking that the miners who so looked down on him were themselves a   set of outside barbarians, to whom the superior civilization of  China  was utterly unknown. It is fortunate that his presumption was  not  suspected by those around him. No one would have resented it  more than  Mr. Patrick O'Reilly, whose rank as regards enlightenment  and  education certainly was not very high. 
  &quot;I say, John,&quot; said Dick Roberts, &quot;are you fond of rat pie?&quot; 
  &quot;Lat pie velly good,&quot; returned Ki Sing, with a look of  appreciation.  &quot;Melican man like him?&quot; 
  &quot;Hear the haythen!&quot; said O'Reilly, with an expression of deep   disgust. &quot;He thinks we ate rats and mice, like him. No, old pigtail,   we ain't cats. We are good Christians.&quot; 
  &quot;Chlistian! Ma don't know Ghlistian,&quot; said the Chinaman. 
  &quot;Then look at O'Reilly,&quot; said Dick Roberts, mischievously. &quot;He's a   good solid Christian.&quot; 
  Ki Sing turned his almond eyes upon O'Reilly, who, with his  freckled  face, wide mouth, broad nose, and stubby beard, was by no  means a  prepossessing-looking man, and said interrogatively: &quot;He  Chlistian?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, John. Wouldn't you like to be one?&quot; 
  Ki Sing shook his head decidedly. 
  &quot;Me no want to be Chlistian,&quot; he answered. &quot;Me velly well now. Me   want to be good Chinaman.&quot; 
  &quot;There's a compliment for you, O'Reilly,&quot; said one of the miners.   &quot;John prefers to be a Chinaman to being like you.&quot; 
  &quot;He's a barbarious haythen, anyhow,&quot; said O'Reilly, surveying his   prisoner with unfriendly eyes. &quot;What did he come over to America  for,  anyhow?&quot; 
  &quot;He probably came over for the same reason that brought you,   O'Reilly,&quot; said a young man, who spoke for the first time, though he   had been from the outset a disgusted witness of what had taken  place. 
  &quot;And what's that?&quot; demanded O'Reilly angrily. 
  &quot;To make a living,&quot; answered Richard Dewey quietly. 
  As this is the first time this young man has been introduced, we   will briefly describe him. He was of medium size, well knit and   vigorous, with a broad forehead, blue eyes, and an intelligent and   winning countenance. He might have been suspected of too great   amiability and gentleness, but for a firm expression about the  mouth,  and an indefinable air of manliness, which indicated that it  would not  do to go too far with him. There was a point, as all his  friends knew,  where his forbearance gave way and he sternly asserted  his rights. He  was not so popular in camp as some, because he  declined to drink or  gamble, and, despite the rough circumstances in  which he found himself  placed, was resolved to preserve his  self-respect. 
  O'Reilly did not fancy his interference, and demanded, in a surly   tone: 
  &quot;Do you mean to compare me wid this haythen?&quot; 
  &quot;You are alike in one respect,&quot; said Richard Dewey quietly.  &quot;Neither  of you were born in this country, but each of you came here  to  improve your fortunes.&quot; 
  &quot;And hadn't I the right, I'd like to know?&quot; blustered O'Reilly. 
  &quot;To be sure you had. This country is free to all who wish to make a   home here.&quot; 
  &quot;Then what are you talkin' about, anyway?&quot; 
  &quot;You ought to be able to understand without asking. Ki Sing has  come  here, and has the same right that you have.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you mane to put me on a livel wid him?&quot; 
  &quot;In that one respect, I do.&quot; 
  &quot;I want you to understand that Patrick O'Reilly won't take no   insults from you, nor any other man!&quot; 
  &quot;Hush, O'Reilly!&quot; said Terence O'Gorman, another Irish miner.  &quot;Dewey  is perfectly right. I came over from Ireland like you, but he  hasn't  said anything against either of us.&quot; 
  &quot;That is where you are right, O'Gorman,&quot; said Richard Dewey   cordially. &quot;You are a man of sense, and can understand me. My own   father emigrated from England, and I am not likely to say anything   against the class to which he belonged. Now, boys, you have had   enough sport out of the poor Chinaman. I advise you to let him go.&quot; 
  Ki Sing grasped at this suggestion. 
  &quot;Melican man speak velly good,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Of course, you think so,&quot; sneered O'Reilly. &quot;I say, boys, let's  cut  off his pigtail,&quot; touching the poor Chinaman's queue. 
  Ki Sing uttered a cry of dismay as O'Reilly's suggestion was  greeted  with favorable shouts by the thoughtless crowd.
