   &#8220;Come here, you Joe, and be quick about it!&#8221;
  The boy addressed, a stout boy of fifteen, with an honest,  sun-browned face, looked calmly at the speaker.
  &#8220;What's wanted?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Brush me off, and don't be all day about it!&#8221; said Oscar Norton  impatiently.
  Joe's blue eyes flashed indignantly at the tone of the other.
  &#8220;You can brush yourself off,&#8221; he answered independently.
  &#8220;What do you mean by your impudence?&#8221; demanded Oscar angrily. &#8220;Have  you turned lazy all at once?&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Joe firmly, &#8220;but I don't choose to be ordered round by  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's up, I wonder? Ain't you our servant?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not your servant, though your father is my employer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you are bound to obey me&#8212;his son.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't see it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you'd better, if you know what's best for yourself. Are you  going to brush me off?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;Look out! I can get my father to turn you off.&#8221;
  &#8220;You may try if you want to.&#8221;
  Oscar, much incensed, went to his father to report Joe's  insubordination. While he is absent, a few words of explanation will  enlighten the reader as to Joe's history and present position.
  Joe Mason was alone in the world. A year previous he had lost his  father, his only remaining parent, and when the father's affairs were  settled and funeral expenses paid there was found to be just five  dollars left, which was expended for clothing for Joe.
  In this emergency Major Norton, a farmer and capitalist, offered to  provide Joe with board and clothes and three months' schooling in the  year in return for his services. As nothing else offered, Joe accepted,  but would not bind himself for any length of time. He was free to go  whenever he pleased.
  Now there were two disagreeable things in Joe's new place. The first  was the parsimony of Major Norton, who was noted for his stingy  disposition, and the second was the overbearing manners of Oscar, who  lost no opportunity to humiliate Joe and tyrannize over him so far as  Joe's independent spirit would allow. It happened, therefore, that Joe  was compelled to work hard, while the promised clothing was of the  cheapest and shabbiest description. He was compelled to go to school in  patched shoes and a ragged suit, which hurt his pride as he compared  himself with Oscar, who was carefully and even handsomely dressed.  Parsimonious as his father was, he was anxious that his only boy should  appear to advantage.
  On the very day on which our story begins Oscar had insulted Joe in  a way which excited our hero's bitter indignation.
  This is the way it happened:
  Joe, who was a general favorite on account of his good looks and  gentlemanly manners, and in spite of his shabby attire, was walking  home with Annie Raymond, the daughter of the village physician, when  Oscar came up.
  He was himself secretly an admirer of the young lady, but had never  received the least encouragement from her. It made him angry to see his  father's drudge walking on equal terms with his own favorite, and his  coarse nature prompted him to insult his enemy.
  &#8220;Miss Raymond,&#8221; he said, lifting his hat mockingly, &#8220;I congratulate  you on the beau you have picked up.&#8221;
  Annie Raymond fully appreciated his meanness, and answered calmly:
  &#8220;I accept your congratulations, Mr. Norton.&#8221;
  This answer made Oscar angry and led him to go further than he  otherwise would.
  &#8220;You must be hard up for an escort, when you accept such a  ragamuffin as Joe Mason.&#8221;
  Joe flushed with anger.
  &#8220;Oscar Norton, do you mean to insult Miss Raymond or me,&#8221; he  demanded.
  &#8220;So you are on your high horse!&#8221; said Oscar sneeringly.
  &#8220;Will you answer my question?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I will. I certainly don't mean to insult Miss Raymond, but I  wonder at her taste in choosing my father's hired boy to walk with.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not responsible to you for my choice, Oscar Norton,&#8221; said  Annie Raymond, with dignity. &#8220;If my escort is poorly dressed, it is not  his fault, nor do I think the less of him for it.&#8221;
  &#8220;If your father would dress me better, I should be very glad of it,&#8221;  said Joe. &#8220;If I am a ragamuffin, it is his fault.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll report that to him,&#8221; said Oscar maliciously.
  &#8220;I wish you would. It would save me the trouble of asking him for  better clothes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose we go on,&#8221; said Annie Raymond.
  &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Joe politely.
  And they walked on, leaving Oscar discomfited and mortified.
  &#8220;What a fool Annie Raymond makes of herself&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I should  think she'd be ashamed to go round with Joe Mason.&#8221;
  Oscar would have liked to despise Annie Raymond, but it was out of  his power. She was undoubtedly the belle of the school, and he would  have been proud to receive as much notice from her as she freely  accorded to Joe. But the young lady had a mind and a will of her own,  and she had seen too much to dislike in Oscar to regard him with favor,  even if he were the son of a rich man, while she had the good sense and  discrimination to see that Joe, despite his ragged garb, possessed  sterling good qualities.
  When Oscar got home he sought his father.
  &#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I heard Joe complaining to Annie Raymond that  you didn't dress him decently.&#8221;
  Major Norton looked annoyed.
  &#8220;What does the boy mean?&#8221; he said. &#8220;What does he expect?&#8221;
  &#8220;He should be dressed as well as I am,&#8221; said Oscar maliciously.
  &#8220;Quite out of the question,&#8221; said the major hastily. &#8220;Your clothes  cost a mint of money.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course, you want me to look well, father. I am your son, and he  is only your hired boy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want folks to talk,&#8221; said the major, who was sensitive to  public opinion. &#8220;Don't you think his clothes are good enough?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course they are; but I'll tell you what, father,&#8221; said Oscar,  with a sudden idea, &#8220;you know that suit of mine that I got stained with  acid?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, Oscar,&#8221; said the major gravely. &#8220;I ought to remember it. It  cost me thirty-four dollars, and you spoiled it by your carelessness.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you give that to Joe?&#8221; suggested Oscar.
  &#8220;He's a good deal larger than you. It wouldn't fit him; and,  besides, it's stained.&#8221;
  &#8220;What right has a hired boy to object to a stain? No matter if it is  too small, he has no right to be particular.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are right, Oscar,&#8221; said the major, who was glad to be saved the  expense of a new suit for Joe. Even he had been unpleasantly conscious  that Joe's appearance had become discreditable to him. &#8220;You may bring  it down, Oscar,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I dare say Joe won't like the idea of wearing it, but a boy in his  position has no right to be proud.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course not,&#8221; returned the major, his ruling passion gratified by  the prospect of saving the price of a suit. &#8220;When Joseph comes home&#8212;at  any rate, after he is through with his chores&#8212;you may tell him to come  in to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right, sir.&#8221;
  Before Oscar remembered this message, the scene narrated at the  commencement of the chapter occurred. On his way to complain to his  father, he recollected the message, and, retracing his steps, said to  Joe:
  &#8220;My father wants to see you right off.&#8221;
  This was a summons which Joe felt it his duty to obey. He  accordingly bent his steps to the room where Major Norton usually sat.
