The three, the white youth, the red youth, and the white man, lay deep  in the forest, watching the fire that burned on a low hill to the west,  where black figures flitted now and then before the flame. They did not  stir or speak for a long time, because a great horror was upon them.  They had seen an army destroyed a few days before by a savage but  invisible foe. They had heard continually for hours the fierce  triumphant yells of the warriors and they had seen the soldiers dropping  by hundreds, but the woods and thickets had hid the foe who sent forth  such a rain of death.    
Robert Lennox could not yet stop the quiver of his nerves when he  recalled the spectacle, and Willet, the hunter, hardened though he was  to war, shuddered in spite of himself at the memory of that terrible  battle in the leafy wilderness. Nor was Tayoga, the young Onondaga,  free from emotion when he thought of Braddock's defeat, and the blazing  triumph it meant for the western tribes, the enemies of his people.    
They had turned back, availing themselves of their roving commission,  when they saw that the victors were not pursuing the remains of the  beaten army, and now they were watching the French and Indians. Fort  Duquesne was not many miles away, but the fire on the hill had been  built by a party of Indians led by a Frenchman, his uniform showing when  he passed between eye and flame, the warriors being naked save for the  breech cloth.    
"I hope it's not St. Luc," said Robert.    
"Why?" asked Willet. "He was in the battle. We saw him leading on the  Indian hosts."    
"I know. That was fair combat, I suppose, and the French used the tools  they had. The Chevalier could scarcely have been a loyal son of France  if he had not fought us then, but I don't like to think of him over  there by the fire, leading a band of Indians who will kill and scalp  women and children as well as men along the border."    
"Nor I, either, though I'm not worried about it. I can't tell who the  man is, but I know it's not St. Luc. Now I see him black against the  blaze, and it's not the Chevalier's figure."    
Robert suddenly drew a long breath, as if he had made a surprising  recognition.    
"I'm not sure," he said, "but I notice a trick of movement now and then  reminding me of someone. I'm thinking it's the same Auguste de  Courcelles, Colonel of France, whom we met first in the northern woods  and again in Quebec. There was one memorable night, as you know, Dave,  when we had occasion to mark him well."    
"I think you're right, Robert," said the hunter. "It looks like De  Courcelles."    
"I know he is right," said Tayoga, speaking for the first time. "I have  been watching him whenever he passed before the fire, and I cannot  mistake him."    
"I wonder what he's doing here," said Robert. "He may have been in the  battle, or he may have come to Duquesne a day or two later."    
"I think," said Willet, "that he's getting ready to lead a band against  the border, now almost defenseless."    
"He is a bad man," said Tayoga. "His soul is full of wickedness and  cruelty, and it should be sent to the dwelling place of the evil minded.  If Great Bear and Dagaeoga say the word I will creep through the  thickets and kill him."    
Robert glanced at him. The Onondaga had spoken in the gentle tones of  one who felt grief rather than anger. Robert knew that his heart was  soft, that in ordinary life none was kinder than Tayoga. And yet he was  and always would be an Indian. De Courcelles had a bad mind, and he was  also a danger that should be removed. Then why not remove him?    
"No, Tayoga," said Willet. "We can't let you risk yourself that way. But  we might go a little closer without any great danger. Ah, do you see  that new figure passing before the blaze?"    
"Tandakora!" exclaimed the white youth and the red youth together.    
"Nobody who knows him could mistake him, even at this distance. I think  he must be the biggest Indian in all the world."    
"But a bullet would bring him crashing to earth as quickly as any  other," said the Onondaga.    
"Aye, so it would, Tayoga, but his time hasn't come yet, though it will  come, and may we be present when your Manitou deals with him as he  deserves. Suppose we curve to the right through these thick bushes, and  from the slope there I think we can get a much better view of the band."    
They advanced softly upon rising ground, and being able to approach two  or three hundred yards, saw quite clearly all those around the fire. The  white man was in truth De Courcelles, and the gigantic Indian, although  there could have been no mistake about him, was Tandakora, the Ojibway.  The warriors, about thirty in number, were, Willet thought, a mingling  of Ojibways, Pottawattomies and Ottawas. All were in war paint and were  heavily armed, many of them carrying big muskets with bayonets on the  end, taken from Braddock's fallen soldiers. Three had small swords  belted to their naked waists, not as weapons, but rather as the visible  emblems of triumph.    
As he looked, Robert's head grew hot with the blood pumped up from his  angry heart. It seemed to him that they swaggered and boasted, although  they were but true to savage nature.    
"Easy, lad," said Willet, putting a restraining hand upon his shoulder.  "It's their hour. You can't deny that, and we'll have to bide a while."    
"But will our hour ever come, Dave? Our army has been beaten,  destroyed. The colonies and mother country alike are sluggish, and now  have no plans, the whole border lies at the mercy of the tomahawk and  the French power in Canada not only grows all the time, but is directed  by able and daring men."    
"Patience, lad, patience! Our strength is greater than that of the foe,  although we may be slower in using it. But I tell you we'll see our day  of triumph yet."    
"They are getting ready to move," whispered the Onondaga. "The Frenchman  and the band will march northward."    
"And not back to Duquesne?" said Willet. "What makes you think so,  Tayoga?"    
"What is left for them to do at Duquesne? It will be many a day before  the English and Americans come against it again."    
"That, alas, is true, Tayoga. They're not needed longer here, nor are  we. They've put out their fire, and now they're off toward the north,  just as you said they would be. Tandakora and De Courcelles lead,  marching side by side. A pretty pair, well met here in the forest. Now,  I wish I knew where they were going!"    
"Can't the Great Bear guess?" said the Onondaga.    
"No, Tayoga. How should I?"    
"Doesn't Great Bear remember the fort in the forest, the one called  Refuge?"    
"Of course I do, Tayoga! And the brave lads, Colden and Wilton and  Carson and their comrades who defended it so long and so well. That's  the most likely point of attack, and now, since Braddock's army is  destroyed it's too far in the wilderness, too exposed, and should be  abandoned. Suppose we carry a warning!"    
Robert's eyes glistened. The idea made a strong appeal to him. He had  mellow memories of those Philadelphia lads, and it would be pleasant to  see them again. The three, in bearing the alarm, might achieve, too, a  task that would lighten, in a measure, the terror along the border. It  would be a relief at least to do something while the government  disagreed and delayed.    
"Let's start at once for Fort Refuge," he said, "and help them to get  away before the storm breaks. What do you say, Tayoga?"    
"It is what we ought to do," replied the Onondaga, in his precise  English of the schools.    
"Come," said Willet, leading the way, and the three, leaving the fire  behind them, marched rapidly into the north and east. Two miles gone,  and they stopped to study the sun, by which they meant to take their  reckoning.    
"The fort lies there," said Willet, pointing a long finger, "and by my  calculations it will take us about five days and nights to reach it,  that is, if nothing gets in our way."    
"You think, then," asked Robert, "that the French and Indians are  already spreading a net?"    
"The Indians might stop, Robert, my lad, to exult over their victory and  to celebrate it with songs and dances, but the French leaders, whose  influence with them is now overwhelming, will push them on. They will  want to reap all the fruits of their great triumph by the river. I've  often told you about the quality of the French and you've seen for  yourself. Ligneris, Contrecoeur, De Courcelles, St. Luc and the others  will flame like torches along the border."    
"And St. Luc will be the most daring, skillful and energetic of them  all."    
"It's a fact that all three of us know, Robert, and now, having fixed  our course, we must push ahead with all speed. De Courcelles, Tandakora  and the warriors are on the march, too, and we may see them again before  we see Fort Refuge."    
"The forest will be full of warriors," said Tayoga, speaking with great  gravity. "The fort will be the first thought of the western barbarians,  and of the tribes from Canada, and they will wish to avenge the defeat  they suffered before it."    
It was not long until they had ample proof that the Onondaga's words  were true. They saw three trails in the course of the day, and all of  them led toward the fort. Willet and Tayoga, with their wonderful  knowledge of the forest, estimated that about thirty warriors made one  trail, about twenty another, and fifteen the smallest.    
"They're going fast, too," said the hunter, "but we must go faster."    
"They will see our traces," said Tayoga, "and by signaling to one  another they will tell all that we are in the woods. Then they will set  a force to destroy us, while the greater bands go on to take the fort."    
"But we'll pass 'em," said Robert confidently. "They can't stop us!"    
Tayoga and the hunter glanced at him. Then they looked at each other  and smiled. They knew Robert thoroughly, they understood his vivid and  enthusiastic nature which, looking forward with so much confidence to  success, was apt to consider it already won, a fact that perhaps  contributed in no small measure to the triumph wished so ardently. At  last, the horror of the great defeat in the forest and the slaughter of  an army was passing. It was Robert's hopeful temperament and brilliant  mind that gave him such a great charm for all who met him, a charm to  which even the fifty wise old sachems in the vale of Onondaga had not  been insensible.    
"No, Robert," said the Great Bear gravely, "I don't think anything can  stop us. I've a prevision that De Courcelles and Tandakora will stand in  our way, but we'll just brush 'em out of it."    
They had not ceased to march at speed, while they talked, and now Tayoga  announced the presence of a river, an obstacle that might prove  formidable to foresters less expert than they. It was lined on both  sides with dense forest, and they walked along its bank about a mile  until they came to a comparatively shallow place where they forded it in  water above their knees. However, their leggings and moccasins dried  fast in the midsummer sun, and, experiencing no discomfort, they pressed  forward with unabated speed.    
All the afternoon they continued their great journey to save those at  the fort, fording another river and a half dozen creeks and leaping  across many brooks. Twice they crossed trails leading to the east and  twice other trails leading to the west, but they felt that all of them  would presently turn and join in the general march converging upon Fort  Refuge. They were sure, too, that De Courcelles, Tandakora and their  band were marching on a line almost parallel with them, and that they  would offer the greatest danger.    
Night came, a beautiful, bright summer night with a silky blue sky in  which multitudes of silver stars danced, and they sought a covert in a  dense thicket where they lay on their blankets, ate venison, and talked  a little before they slept.    
Robert's brilliant and enthusiastic mood lasted. He could see nothing  but success. With the fading of the great slaughter by the river came  other pictures, deep of hue, intense and charged with pleasant memories.  Life recently had been a great panorama to him, bright and full of  changes. He could not keep from contrasting his present position, hid in  a thicket to save himself from cruel savages, with those vivid days at  Quebec, his gorgeous period in New York, and the gay time with sporting  youth in the cozy little capital of Williamsburg.    
But the contrast, so far from making him unhappy, merely expanded his  spirit. He rejoiced in the pleasures that he had known and adapted  himself to present conditions. Always influenced greatly by what lay  just around him, he considered their thicket the best thicket in which  he had ever been hidden. The leaves of last year, drifted into little  heaps on which they lay, were uncommonly large and soft. The light  breeze rustling the boughs over his head whispered only of peace and  ease, and the two comrades, who lay on either side of him, were the  finest comrades any lad ever had.    
"Tayoga," he asked, and his voice was sincerely earnest, "can you see on  his star Tododaho, the founder and protector of the great league of the  Hodenosaunee?"    
The young Onondaga, his face mystic and reverential, gazed toward the  west where a star of great size and beauty quivered and blazed.    
"I behold him," he replied. "His face is turned toward us, and the wise  serpents lie, coil on coil, in his hair. There are wreaths of vapor  about his eyes, but I can see them shining through, shining with  kindness, as the mighty chief, who went away four hundred years ago,  watches over us. His eyes say that so long as our deeds are just, so  long as we walk in the path that Manitou wishes, we shall be victorious.  Now a cloud passes before the star, and I cannot see the face of  Tododaho, but he has spoken, and it will be well for us to remember his  words."    
He sank back on his blanket and closed his eyes as if he, too, in  thought, had shot through space to some great star. Robert and Willet  were silent, sharing perhaps in his emotion. The religion and beliefs of  the Indian were real and vital to them, and if Tododaho promised success  to Tayoga then the promise would be fulfilled.    
"I think, Robert," said Willet, "that you'd better keep the first watch.  Wake me a little while before midnight, and I'll take the second."    
"Good enough," said Robert. "I think I can hear any footfall Tandakora  may make, if he approaches."    
"It is not enough to hear the footfall of the Ojibway," said Tayoga,  opening his eyes and sitting up. "To be a great sentinel and forester  worthy to be compared with the greatest, Dagaeoga must hear the whisper  of the grass as it bends under the lightest wind, he must hear the sound  made by the little leaf as it falls, he must hear the ripple in the  brook that is flowing a hundred yards from us, and he must hear the wild  flowers talking together in the night. Only then can Dagaeoga call  himself a sentinel fit to watch over two such sleeping foresters as the  Great Bear and myself."    
"Close your eyes and go to sleep without fear," said Robert in the same  vein. "I shall hear Tandakora breathing if he comes within a mile of us,  at the same distance I shall hear the moccasin of De Courcelles, when it  brushes against last year's fallen leaf, and at half a mile I shall see  the look of revenge and cruelty upon the face of the Ojibway seeking for  us."    
Willet laughed softly, but with evident satisfaction.    
"You two boys are surely the greatest talkers I've heard for a long  time," he said. "You have happy thoughts and you put 'em into words. If  I didn't know that you had a lot of deeds, too, to your credit, I'd call  you boasters, but knowing it, I don't. Go ahead and spout language,  because you're only lads and I can see that you enjoy it."    
"I'm going to sleep now," said Tayoga, "but Dagaeoga can keep on talking  and be happy, because he will talk to himself long after we have gone to  the land of dreams."    
"If I do talk to myself," said Robert, "it's because I like to talk to  a bright fellow, and I like to have a bright fellow talk to me. Sleep as  soundly as you please, you two, because while you're sleeping I can  carry on an intellectual conversation."    
The hunter laughed again.    
"It's no use, Tayoga," he said. "You can't put him down. The fifty wise  old sachems in the vale of Onondaga proclaimed him a great orator, and  great orators must always have their way."    
"It is so," said the Onondaga. "The voice of Dagaeoga is like a river.  It flows on forever, and like the murmur of the stream it will soothe me  to deeper slumbers. Now I sleep."    
"And so do I," said the hunter.    
It seemed marvelous that such formal announcements should be followed by  fact, but within three minutes both went to that pleasant land of dreams  of which they had been talking so lightly. Their breathing was long and  regular and, beyond a doubt, they had put absolute faith in their  sentinel. Robert's mind, so quick to respond to obvious confidence,  glowed with resolve. There was no danger now that he would relax the  needed vigilance a particle, and, rifle in the hollow of his arm, he  began softly to patrol the bushes.    
He was convinced that De Courcelles and Tandakora were not many miles  away--they might even be within a mile--and memory of a former occasion,  somewhat similar, when Tayoga had detected the presence of the Ojibway,  roused his emulation. He was determined that, while he was on watch, no  creeping savage should come near enough to strike.    
Hand on the hammer and trigger of his rifle he walked in an ever  widening circle about his sleeping comrades, searching the thickets with  eyes, good naturally and trained highly, and stopping now and then to  listen. Two or three times he put his ear to the earth that he might  hear, as Tayoga had bade him, the rustle of leaves a mile away.    
His eager spirit, always impatient for action, found relief in the  continuous walking, and the steady enlargement of the circle in which he  traveled, acquiring soon a radius of several hundred yards. On the  western perimeter he was beyond the deep thicket, and within a  magnificent wood, unchoked by undergrowth. Here the trees stood up in  great, regular rows, ordered by nature, and the brilliant moonlight  clothed every one of them in a veil of silver. On such a bright night in  summer the wilderness always had for him an elusive though powerful  beauty, but he felt its danger. Among the mighty trunks, with no  concealing thickets, he could be seen easily, if prowling savages were  near, and, as he made his circles, he always hastened through what he  called to himself his park, until he came to the bushes, in the density  of which he was well hidden from any eye fifty feet away.    
It was an hour until midnight, and the radius of his circle had  increased another fifty yards, when he came again to the great spaces  among the oaks and beeches. Halfway through and he sank softly down  behind the trunk of a huge oak. Either in fact or in a sort of mental  illusion, he had heard a moccasin brush a dry leaf far away. The command  of Tayoga, though spoken in jest, had been so impressive that his ear  was obeying it. Firm in the belief that his own dark shadow blurred  with the dark trunk, and that he was safe from the sight of a questing  eye, he lay there a long time, listening.    
In time, the sound, translated from fancy into fact, came again, and now  he knew that it was near, perhaps not more than a hundred yards away,  the rustling of a real moccasin against a real dry leaf. Twice and  thrice his ear signaled to his brain. It could not be fancy. It was  instead an alarming fact.    
He was about to creep from the tree, and return to his comrades with  word that the enemy was near, but he restrained his impulse, merely  crouching a little lower that his dark shadow might blend with the dark  earth as well as the dark trunk. Then he heard several rustlings and the  very low murmur of voices.    
Gradually the voices which had been blended together, detached  themselves and Robert recognized those of Tandakora and De Courcelles.  Presently they came into the moonlight, followed by the savage band, and  they passed within fifty yards of the youth who lay in the shelter of  the trunk, pressing himself into the earth.    
The Frenchman and the Ojibway were talking with great earnestness and  Robert's imagination, plumbing the distance, told him the words they  said. Tandakora was stating with great emphasis that the three whose  trail they had found had gone on very fast, obviously with the intention  of warning the garrison at the fort, and if they were to be cut off the  band must hasten, too. De Courcelles was replying that in his opinion  Tandakora was right, but it would not be well to get too far ahead. They  must throw out flankers as they marched, but there was no immediate  need of them. If the band spread out before dawn it would be sufficient.    
Robert's fancy was so intense and creative that, beginning by imagining  these things so, he made them so. The band therefore was sure to go on  without searching the thickets on either right or left at present, and  all immediate apprehension disappeared from his mind. Tandakora and De  Courcelles were in the center of the moonlight, and although knowing  them evil, he was surprised to see how very evil their faces looked,  each in its own red or white way. He could remember nothing at that  moment but their wickedness, and their treacherous attacks upon his life  and those of his friends, and the memory clothed them about with a  hideous veil through which only their cruel souls shone. It was  characteristic of him that he should always see everything in extreme  colors, and in his mind the good were always very good and the bad were  very bad.    
Hence it was to him an actual physical as well as mental relief, when  the Frenchman, the Ojibway and their band, passing on, were blotted from  his eyes by the forest. Then he turned back to the thicket in which his  comrades lay, and bent over them for the purpose of awakening them. But  before he could speak or lay a hand upon either, Tayoga sat up, his eyes  wide open.    
"You come with news that the enemy has been at hand!"    
"Yes, but how did you know it?"    
"I see it in your look, and, also when I slept, the Keeper of Dreams  whispered it in my ear. An evil wind, too, blew upon my face and I knew  it was the breath of De Courcelles and Tandakora. They have been near."    
"They and their entire band passed not more than four hundred yards to  the eastward of us. I lay in the bush and saw them distinctly. They're  trying to beat us to Fort Refuge."    
"But they won't do it, because we won't let 'em," said Willet, who had  awakened at the talking. "We'll make a curve and get ahead of 'em again.  You watched well, Robert."    
"I obeyed the strict injunctions of Tayoga," said young Lennox, smiling  faintly. "He bade me listen so intently that I should hear the rustle of  a dry leaf when a moccasin touched it a mile away in the forest. Well, I  heard it, and going whence the sound came I saw De Courcelles, Tandakora  and their warriors pass by."    
"You love to paint pictures with words, Robert. I see that well, but  'tis not likely that you exaggerate so much, after all. I'm sorry you  won't get your share of sleep, but we must be up and away."    
"I'll claim a double portion of it later on, Dave, but I agree with you  that what we need most just now is silence and speed, and speed and  silence."    
The three, making a curve toward the east, traveled at high speed  through the rest of the night, Tayoga now leading and showing all his  inimitable skill as a forest trailer. In truth, the Onondaga was in his  element. His spirits, like Robert's, rose as dangers grew thicker around  them, and he had been affected less than either of his comrades by the  terrible slaughter of Braddock's men. Mentally at least, he was more of  a stoic, and woe to the vanquished was a part of the lore of all the  Indian tribes. The French and their allies had struck a heavy blow and  there was nothing left for the English and Americans to do but to strike  back. It was all very simple.    
Day came, and at the suggestion of Willet they rested again in the  thickets. Robert was not really weary, at least the spirit uplifted him,  though he knew that he must not overtask the body. His enthusiasm, based  upon such a sanguine temperament, continued to rise. Again he foresaw  glittering success. They would shake off all their foes, reach the fort  in time, and lead the garrison and the people who had found refuge there  safely out of the wilderness.    
Where they lay the bushes were very dense. Before hiding there they had  drunk abundantly at a little brook thirty or forty feet away, and now  they ate with content the venison that formed their breakfast. Over the  vast forest a brilliant sun was rising and here the leaves and grass  were not burned much by summer heat. It looked fresh and green, and the  wind sang pleasantly through its cool shadows. It appealed to Robert.  With his plastic nature he was all for the town when he was in town, and  now in the forest he was all for the forest.    
"I can understand why you love it so well," he said to Tayoga, waving  his hand at the verdant world that curved about them.    
"My people and their ancestors have lived in it for more generations  than anyone knows," said the Onondaga, his eyes glistening. "I have  been in the white man's schools, and the white man's towns, and I have  seen the good in them, but this is my real home. This is what I love  best. My heart beats strongest for the forest."    
"My own heart does a lot of beating for the woods," said Willet,  thoughtfully, "and it ought to do so, I've spent so many years of my  life in them--happy years, too. They say that no matter how great an  evil may be some good will come out of it, and this war will achieve one  good end."    
"What is that, Great Bear?"    
"It will delay the work of the ax. Men will be so busy with the rifle  that they will have mighty little time for the ax. The trees will stop  falling for a while, and the forest will cover again the places where it  has been cleared away. Why, the game itself will increase!"    
"How long do you think we'd better stay here?" asked Robert, his eager  soul anxious to be on again.    
"Patience! patience, my lad," replied Willet. "It's one thing that  you'll have to practice. We don't want to run squarely into De  Courcelles, Tandakora and their band, and meanwhile we're very  comfortable here, gathering strength. Look at Tayoga there and learn  from him. If need be he could lie in the same place a week and be  happy."    
"I hope the need will not come," laughed the Onondaga.    
Robert felt the truth of Willet's words, and he put restraint upon  himself, resolved that he would not be the first to propose the new  start. He had finished breakfast and he lay on his elbow gazing up  through the green tracery of the bushes at the sky. It was a wonderful  sky, a deep, soft, velvet blue, and it tinted the woods with glorious  and kindly hues. It seemed strange to Robert, at the moment, that a  forest so beautiful should bristle with danger, but he knew it too well  to allow its softness and air of innocence to deceive him.    
It was almost the middle of the morning when Willet gave the word to  renew the march, and they soon saw they had extreme need of caution.  Evidence that warriors had passed was all about them. Now and then they  saw the faint imprint of a moccasin. Twice they found little painted  feathers that had fallen from a headdress or a scalplock, and once  Tayoga saw a red bead lying in the grass where it had dropped, perhaps,  from a legging.    
"We shall have to pass by Tandakora's band and perhaps other bands in  the night," said Tayoga.    
"It's possible, too," said Willet, "that they know we're on our way to  the fort, and may try to stop us. Our critical time will soon be at  hand."    
They listened throughout the afternoon for the signals that bands might  make to one another, but heard nothing. Willet, in truth, was not  surprised.    
"Silence will serve them best," he said, "and they'll send runners from  band to band. Still, if they do give signals we want to know it."    
"There is a river, narrow but deep, about five miles ahead," said  Tayoga, "and we'll have to cross it on our way to the fort. I think it  is there that Tandakora will await us."    
"It's pretty sure to be the place," said Willet. "Do you know where  there's a ford, Tayoga?"    
"There is none."    
"Then we'll have to swim for it. That's bad. But you say it's a narrow  stream?"    
"Yes, Great Bear. Two minutes would carry us across it."    
"Then we must find some place for the fording where the trees lean over  from either side and the shadow is deep."    
Tayoga nodded, and, after that, they advanced in silence, redoubling  their caution as they drew near to the river. The night was not so  bright as the one that had just gone before, but it furnished sufficient  light for wary and watching warriors to see their figures at a  considerable distance, and, now and then, they stopped to search the  thickets with their own eyes. No wind blew, their footsteps made no  sound and the intense stillness of the forest wove itself into the  texture of Robert's mind. His extraordinary fancy peopled it with  phantoms. There was a warrior in every bush, but, secure in the  comradeship of his two great friends, he went on without fear.    
"There is no signal," whispered Tayoga at last. "They do not even  imitate the cry of bird or beast, and it proves one thing, Great Bear."    
"So it does, Tayoga."    
"You know as well as I do, Great Bear, that they make no sound because  they have set the trap, and they do not wish to alarm the game which  they expect to walk into it."    
"Even so, Tayoga. Our minds travel in the same channel."    
"But the game is suspicious, nevertheless," continued Tayoga in his  precise school English, "and the trap will not fall."    
"No, Tayoga, it won't fall, because the game won't walk into it."    
"Tandakora will suffer great disappointment. He is a mighty hunter and  he has hunted mighty game, but the game that he hunts now is more wary  than the stag or the bear, and has greater power to strike back than  either."    
"Well spoken, Tayoga."
