  The Sabbath was a day of glory and peace in the Burntwood country.   The sun rose warm and golden, the birds were singing, and never  had  the air seemed sweeter to Father John when he came out quietly  from  the cabin and breathed it in the early break of dawn. Best of  all he  loved this very beginning of day, before darkness was quite  gone, when  the world seemed to be awakening mid sleepy whisperings  and sounds  came clearly from a long distance. 
  This morning he heard the barking of a dog, a mile away it must   have been, and Peter, who followed close beside him, pricked up  his  ears at the sound of it. Father John had noted Peter's  vigilance, the  cautious expectancy with which he was always  sniffing the air, and the  keen alertness of his eyes and ears.  McKay had explained the reason  for it. And this morning, as they  made their way down to the pool at  the creekside, Peter's  ceaseless watching for danger held a deeper  significance for  Father John. All through the night, in spite of his  faith and his  words of consolation, he was thinking of the menace  which was  following McKay, and which eventually must catch up with  him. 
  And yet, how short a time was five years! Looking backward, each   five years of his life seemed but a yesterday. It was eight times   five years ago that a sweet-faced girl had first filled his life,  as  Nada filled Jolly Roger's now, and through the thirty years  since he  had lost her he could still hear her voice as clearly as  though he had  held her in his arms only a few hours ago, so swift  had been the  passing of time. But looking ahead, and not backward,  five years  seemed an eternity of time, and the dread of it was in  Father John's  heart as he stood at the side of the pool, with the  first pink glow of  sunrise coming to him over the forest-tops. 
  Five years, and he was an old man now. A long and dreary wait it   would be for him. But for youth, the glorious youth of Roger and   Nada, it would seem very short when in later years they looked  back  upon it. And for a time as he contemplated the long span of  life that  lay behind him, and the briefness of that which lay  ahead, a yearning  selfishness possessed the soul of Father John,  an almost savage desire  to hold those five years away from the  violation of the law&#8212;not alone  for Nada's sake and Roger McKay's  &#8212;but for his own. In this twilight  of a tragic life a great  happiness had come to him in the love of  these two, and thought of  its menace, its desecration by a pitiless  and mistaken justice,  roused in him something that was more like the  soul of a fighting  man than the spirit of a missioner of God. 
  Vainly he tried to stamp out the evil of this resentment, for evil   he believed it to be. And shame possessed him when he saw the  sweet  glory in Nada's face later that morning, and the happiness  that was in  Roger McKay's. Yet was that aching place in his heart,  and the hidden  fear which he could not vanquish. 
  And that day, it seemed to him, his lips gave voice to lies. For,   being Sunday, the wilderness folk gathered from miles about, and  he  preached to them in the little mission house which they had  helped him  to build of logs in the clearing. Partly he spoke in  Cree, and partly  in English, and his message was one of hope and  inspiration, pointing  out the silver linings that always lay  beyond the darkness of clouds.  To McKay, holding Nada's hand in  his own as they listened, Father  John's words brought a great and  comforting faith. And in Nada's eyes  and voice as she led in Cree  the song, &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee,&quot; he  heard and saw the living  fire of that faith, and had Breault come in  through the open  doorway then he would have accepted him calmly as the  beginning of  that sacrifice which he had made up his mind to make. 
  In the afternoon, when the wilderness people had gone, Father John   heard again the story of Yellow Bird, for Nada was ever full of   questions about her, and for the first time the Missioner learned  of  the inspiration which the Indian woman's sorcery had been to  Jolly  Roger. 
  &quot;It was foolish,&quot; McKay apologized, in spite of the certainty and   faith which he saw shining in Nada's eyes. &quot;But&#8212;it helped me.&quot; 
  &quot;It wasn't foolish,&quot; replied Nada quickly. &quot;Yellow Bird DID come   to me. And&#8212;SHE KNEW.&quot; 
  &quot;No true faith is folly,&quot; said Father John, in his soft, low   voice. &quot;The great fact is that Yellow Bird believed. She was  inspired  by a great confidence, and confidence and faith give to  the mind a  power which it is utterly incapable of possessing  without them. I  believe in the mind, children. I believe that in  some day to come it  will reach those heights where it will unlock  the mystery of life  itself to us. I have seen many strange things  in my forty-odd years in  the wilderness, and not the least of  these have been the achievements  of the primitive mind. And it  seems to me, Roger, that Yellow Bird  told you much that has come  true. And has it occurred to you&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped, knowing that the cloud of unrest which was almost fear   in his heart was driving him to say these things. 
  &quot;What, father,&quot; questioned Nada, bending toward him. 
  &quot;I was about to express a thought which suggests an almost   childish curiosity, and you will laugh at me, my dear. I am  wondering  if it has occurred to Roger the mysterious 'Country  Beyond' of which  Yellow Bird dreamed might be the great country  down  there&#8212;south&#8212;BEYOND THE BORDER&#8212;the United States?&quot; 
  Something which he could not control seemed to drive the words   from his lips, and in an instant he saw that Nada had seized upon   their significance. Her eyes widened. The blue in them grew  darker,  and Roger observed her fingers grip suddenly in the  softness of her  dress as she turned from Father John to look at  him. 
  &quot;Or&#8212;it might be China, or Africa, or the South Seas,&quot; he tried to   laugh, remembering his old visions. &quot;It might be&#8212;anywhere.&quot; 
  Nada's lips trembled, as if she were about to speak; and then very   quietly she sat, with her hands tightly clasped in her lap, and   Father John knew she was not expressing the thought in her heart  when  she said, 
  &quot;Someday I want to tell Yellow Bird how much I love her.&quot; 
  Now in these hours since he and his master had come to the   Burntwood it seemed to Peter that he had lost something very  great,  for in his happiness McKay had taken but scant notice of  him, and Nada  seemed to have found a greater joy than that which a  long time ago she  had found in his comradeship. So now, as she saw  him lying in his  loneliness a short distance away, Nada suddenly  ran to him, and  together they went into the thick screen of the  balsams, Peter yipping  joyously, and Nada without so much as  turning her head in the  direction of Roger and Father John. But  even in that bird-like  swiftness with which she had left them,  Father John had caught the  look in her eyes. 
  &quot;I have made a mistake,&quot; he confessed humbly. &quot;I have sinned,   because in her I have roused the temptation to urge you to fly  away  with her&#8212;down there&#8212;south. She is a woman, and being a  woman she has  infinite faith in Yellow Bird, for Yellow Bird  helped to give you to  her. She believes&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And I&#8212;I&#8212;also believe,&quot; said McKay, staring at the green   balsams. 
  &quot;And yet&#8212;it is better for you to remain. God means that judgment   and happiness should come in their turn.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger rose to his feet, facing the south. 
  &quot;It is a temptation, father. It would be hard to give her up&#8212;now.   If Breault would only wait a little while. But if he comes&#8212;NOW&#8212;&quot; 
  He walked away slowly, following through the balsams where Nada   and Peter had gone. Father John watched him go, and a trembling  smile  came to his lips when he was alone. In his heart he knew he  was a  coward, and that these young people had been stronger than  he. For in  their happiness and the faith which he had falsely  built up in them  they had resigned themselves to the inevitable,  while he, in these  moments of cowardice, had shown them the way to  temptation. And yet as  he stood there, looking in the direction  they had gone, he felt no  remorse because of what he had done, and  a weight seemed to have  lifted itself from his shoulders. 
  For a time the more selfish instincts of the man rose in him,   fighting down the sacrificial humility of the great faith of which  he  was a messenger. The new sensation thrilled him, and in its  thrill he  felt his heart beating a little faster, and hope rising  in him. Five  years were a long time&#8212;FOR HIM. That was the thought  which kept  repeating itself over and over in his brain, and with  it came that  other thought, that self-preservation was the first  law of existence,  and therefore could not be a sin. Thus did  Father John turn traitor to  his spoken words, though his calm and  smiling face gave no betrayal of  it when Nada and Roger returned  to the cabin an hour later, their arms  filled with red bakneesh  vines and early wildflowers. 
  Nada's cheeks were as pink as the bakneesh, and her eyes as blue   as the rock-violets she wore on her breast. 
  And Father John knew that Jolly Roger was no longer oppressed by   the fear of a menace which he was helpless to oppose, for there  was  something very confident in the look of his eyes and the  manner in  which they rested upon Nada 
  Peter alone saw the mysterious thing which happened in the early   evening. He was with Nada in her room. And she was the old Nada   again, hugging his shaggy head in her arms, and whispering to him  in  the old, excited way. And strange memory of a bundle came back  to  Peter, for very quietly, as if unseen ears might be listening  to her,  Nada gathered many things in a pile on the table, and made  another  bundle. This bundle she thrust under her bed, just as a  long time ago  she had thrust a similar bundle under a banksian  clump in the  meadowland below Cragg's Ridge. 
  Father John went to his bed very early, and he was thinking of   Breault. The Hudson's Bay Company post was only twelve miles away,   and Breault would surely go there before questing from cabin to  cabin  for his victim. 
  So it happened that a little after midnight he rose without making   a sound, and by the light of a candle wrote a note for Nada,  saying  he had business at the post that day, and without wakening  them had  made an early start. This note Nada read to McKay when  they sat at  breakfast. 
  &quot;Quite frequently he has gone like that,&quot; Nada explained. &quot;He   loves the forests at night&#8212;in the light of the moon.&quot; 
  &quot;But last night there was no moon,&quot; said Roger. 
  &quot;Yes&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And when Father John left the cabin the sky was clouded, and it   was very dark.&quot; 
  &quot;You heard him go?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, and saw him. There was a worried look in his face when he   wrote that note in the candle-glow.&quot; 
  &quot;Roger, what do you mean?&quot; 
  McKay went behind her chair, and tilted up her face, and kissed   her shining hair and questioning eyes. 
  &quot;It means, precious little wife, that Father John is hurrying to   the post to get news of Breault if he can. It means that deep in  his  heart he wants us to follow Yellow Bird's advice to the end.  For he is  sure that he knows what Yellow Bird meant by 'The  Country Beyond.' It  is the great big world outside the forests. a  world so big that if  need be we can put ourselves ten thousand  miles away from the trails  of the mounted police. That is the  thought which is urging him to the  post to look for Breault.&quot; 
  Her arms crept up to his neck, and in a little voice trembling   with eagerness she said, 
  &quot;Roger, my bundle is ready. I prepared it last night&#8212;and it is   under the bed.&quot; 
  He held her more closely. 
  &quot;And you are willing to go with me&#8212;anywhere?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, anywhere.&quot; 
  &quot;To the end of the earth?&quot; 
  Her crumpled head nodded against his breast. 
  &quot;And leave Father John?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, for you. But I think&#8212;sometime&#8212;he will come to us.&quot; 
  Her fingers touched his cheek. 
  &quot;And there must be forests, big, beautiful forests, in some other   part of the world, Roger&quot; 
  &quot;Or a desert, where they would never think of looking for us,&quot; he   laughed happily. 
  &quot;I'd love the desert, Roger.&quot; 
  &quot;Or an uninhabited island?&quot; 
  Against him her head nodded again. 
  &quot;I'd love life anywhere&#8212;WITH YOU.&quot; 
  &quot;Then&#8212;we'll go,&quot; he said, trying to speak very calmly in spite of   the joy that was consuming him like a fire. And then he went on,   steadying his voice until it was almost cold. &quot;But it means giving  up  everything you've dreamed of, Nada&#8212;these forests you love,  Father  John, Yellow Bird, Sun Cloud&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I have only one dream,&quot; she interrupted him softly. 
  &quot;And five years will pass very quickly,&quot; he continued. &quot;Possibly   it will not be as bad as that, and afterward all this land we love   will be free to us forever. Gladly will I remain and take my   punishment if in the end it will make us happier, Nada&quot; 
  &quot;I have only one dream,&quot; she repeated, caressing his cheek with   her hand, &quot;and that is you, Roger. Where-ever you take me I shall  be  the happiest woman in the world.&quot; 
  &quot;WOMAN,&quot; he laughed, scarcely breathing the word aloud. 
  &quot;Yes, I am a woman&#8212;now&quot; 
  &quot;And yet forever and ever the little girl of Cragg's Ridge,&quot; he   cried with sudden passion, crushing her close to him. &quot;I'd lose my   life sooner than I would lose her, Nada&#8212;the little girl with  flying  hair and strawberry stain on her nose, and who believed so  faithfully  in the Man in the Moon. Always I shall worship her as  the little  goddess who came down to me from somewhere in heaven!&quot; 
  Yet all through that day, as they waited for Father John's return,   he saw more and more of the wonder of woman that had come to crown   the glory of Nada's wifehood, and his heart trembled with joy at  the  miracle of it. There was something vastly sweet in the change  of her.  She was no longer the utterly dependent little thing,  possibly caring  for him because he was big and strong and able to  protect her; she was  a woman, and loved him as a woman, and not  because of fear or  helplessness. And then came the thrilling  mystery of another thing. He  found himself, in turn, beginning to  depend upon her, and in their  planning her calm decision and quiet  reasoning strengthened him with  new confidence and made his heart  sing with gladness. With his eyes on  the smooth and velvety coils  of hair which she had twisted woman-like  on her head, he said, 
  &quot;With your hair like that you are my Margaret of Anjou, and the   other way&#8212;with it down you are my little Nada of Cragg's Ridge.  And  I&#8212;I don't quite understand why God should be so good to me.&quot; 
  And this day Peter was trying in his dumb way to analyze the   change. The touch of Nada's hand thrilled him, as it did a long  time  ago, and still he sensed the difference. Her voice was even  softer  when she put her cheek down to his whiskered face and  talked to him,  but in it he missed that which he could not quite  bring back clearly  through the lapse of time&#8212;the childish  comradeship of her. Yet he  began to worship her anew, even more  fiercely than he had loved the  Nada of old. He was content now to  lie with his nose touching her foot  or dress; but when in the  sunset of early evening she went into her  room, and came out a  little later with her curling hair clouding her  shoulders and  breast, and tied with a faded ribbon she had brought  from Cragg's  Ridge, he danced about her, yelping joyously, and she  accepted the  challenge in a wild race with him to the edge of the  clearing. 
  Panting and flushed she ran back to Jolly Roger, and rested in his   arms. 
  And it was McKay, with his face half hidden in her riotous hair,   who saw a figure come suddenly out of the forest at the far end of   the clearing. It was Father John. He saw him pause for an instant,   and then stagger toward them, swaying as if about to fall. 
  The sudden stopping of his breath&#8212;the tightening of his arms&#8212;   drew Nada's shining eyes to his face, and then she, too, saw the   little old Missioner as he swayed and staggered across the  clearing.  With a cry she was out of McKay's arms and running  toward him. 
  Father John was leaning heavily upon her when McKay came up. His   face was tense and his breath came in choking gasps. But he tried  to  smile as he clutched a hand at his breast. 
  &quot;I have hurried,&quot; he said, making a great effort to speak calmly,   &quot;and I am&#8212;winded&#8212;&quot; 
  He drew in a deep breath, and looked at Jolly Roger. 
  &quot;Roger&#8212;I have hurried to tell you&#8212;Breault is coming. He cannot   be far behind me. Possibly half a mile, or a mile&#8212;&quot; 
  In the thickening dusk he took Nada's white face between his   hands. 
  &quot;I find&#8212;at last&#8212;that I was mistaken, child,&quot; he said, very   calmly now. &quot;I believe it is not God's will that you remain to be   taken by Breault. You must go. There is no time to lose. If  Breault  does not stumble off the trail in this gloom he will be  here in a few  minutes. Come.&quot; 
  Not a word did Nada say as they went to the cabin, and McKay saw   her tense face as pale as an ivory cameo in the twilight. But   something in the up-tilt of her chin and the poise of her head   assured him she was prepared, and unafraid. 
  In the cabin the Leaf Bud met them, and to her Nada spoke quickly.   There was understanding between them, and Oosimisk dragged in a   filled pack from the kitchen while Nada ran into her room and came   out with the bundle. 
  Suddenly she was standing before McKay and Father John, her breast   throbbing with excitement. 
  &quot;There is nothing more to make ready,&quot; she said. &quot;Yellow Bird has   been with me all this day, and her spirit told me to prepare. We  have  everything we need.&quot; 
  And then she saw only Father John, and put her arms closely about   his neck, and with wide, tearless eyes looked into his face. 
  &quot;Father, you will come to us?&quot; she whispered. &quot;You promise that?&quot; 
  The Missioner's arms closed about her, and he bowed his face   against her lips and cheek. 
  &quot;I pray God that it may be so,&quot; he said. 
  Nada's arms tightened convulsively, and in that moment there came   a warning growl from outside the cabin door. 
  &quot;Peter!&quot; she cried. 
  In another moment Father John had extinguished the light. 
  &quot;Go, my children,&quot; he commanded. &quot;You must be quick. Twenty paces   below the pool is a canoe. I had one of my Indians leave it there   yesterday, and it is ready. Roger&#8212;Nada&#8212;&quot; 
  He groped out, and the hands of the three met in the darkness. 
  &quot;God bless you&#8212;both! And go south&#8212;always south. Now go&#8212;go! I   think I hear footsteps&#8212;&quot; 
  He thrust them to the door, Nada with her bundle and Roger with   his pack. Suddenly he felt Peter at his side, and reaching down he   fastened his fingers in the scruff of his neck, and held him back. 
  &quot;Good-bye,&quot; he whispered huskily. &quot;Good-bye&#8212;Nada&#8212;Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  A sob came back out of the gloom. 
  &quot;Good-bye, father.&quot; 
  And then they listened, Peter and Father John, until the swift   footsteps of the two they loved passed beyond their hearing. 
  Peter whimpered, and struggled a little, but Father John held him   as he closed the door. 
  &quot;It's best for you to stay, Peter,&quot; he tried to explain. &quot;It's   best for you to stay&#8212;with me. For I think they are going a far   distance, and will come to a land where you would shrivel up and  die.  Besides, you could not go in the canoe. So be good, and  remain with  me, Peter&#8212;with me&#8212;&quot; 
  And the Leaf Bud, standing wide-eyed and motionless, heard a   strange little choking laugh come from Father John as he groped in   darkness for a light.
