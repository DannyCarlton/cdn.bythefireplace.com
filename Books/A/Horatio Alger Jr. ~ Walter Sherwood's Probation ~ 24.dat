  As Walter had been brought up with a strict sense of honesty, he  was  somewhat in doubt whether he ought to keep the revolver, which was  a  handsome one, silver-mounted. He decided, however, that it would be   quixotic to disarm himself and put the outlaw in a position to renew   his attack, as he undoubtedly would, if only because he would wish to   get even with the boy who had humiliated him. Walter had, to be sure,   promised to give it up if the owner called for it, but he meant at the   same time to secure his arrest. 
  He did not mention to the professor that he had received a letter  from  the owner of the weapon, as his employer would have insisted upon  his  giving it up. Professor Robinson was a timid man, and, though he  was  of stout build and possessed a fair measure of strength, he had  not as  much spirit as some boys of ten. 
  &quot;What are you going to do with the revolver, Walter?&quot; he asked   uneasily, as they set out on their way from Fremont to Stilwell. 
  &quot;I am going to carry it with me, professor.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you had better withdraw the charges.&quot; 
  &quot;Why should I?&quot; 
  &quot;The weapon might go off.&quot; 
  &quot;I mean that it shall if the owner makes another attack upon us.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't think he will?&quot; asked the professor, nervously. 
  &quot;I think it very probable.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish we had never met him,&quot; said the unhappy professor. 
  &quot;So do I; but as we have, we must make the best of it.&quot; 
  &quot;If you had only given him back the revolver we should have had no   more trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;Pardon me, professor, I think we should have had a great deal of   trouble. Once give the fellow his old advantage over us and he would   use it.&quot; 
  &quot;I never had such an experience before,&quot; complained the professor,   looking at Walter reproachfully, as if he thought that somehow it was   the fault of his young assistant. 
  Walter smiled. 
  &quot;Do you know, professor,&quot; he said, &quot;your remark reminds me of a   statement in an Irish paper to this effect: 'Several persons have died   during the last year who never died before.'&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see the point,&quot; said the professor, peevishly. 
  They were about half-way to the next town when Walter heard the  sound  of a galloping horse behind him. 
  Looking out of the side of the wagon, he saw the now familiar  figure  of the outlaw as he rode up alongside. He looked critically at  Walter,  and saw that the coveted revolver was in our hero's hand,  ready for  action. 
  &quot;Why didn't you give the revolver to my messenger this morning,  boy?&quot;  he demanded, with a frown. 
  &quot;I didn't think it would be safe,&quot; Walter answered significantly. 
  &quot;Didn't you know it was my property?&quot; 
  &quot;I wasn't sure of it.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't know whether you had paid for it.&quot; 
  &quot;You are impudent. Professor Robinson, will you make the boy give  me  back my revolver?&quot; 
  &quot;I have told him to,&quot; answered the professor, in an apologetic  tone,  &quot;but he won't obey me.&quot; 
  &quot;Then why don't you discharge him? I wouldn't keep a boy in my  employ  who disobeyed me.&quot; 
  &quot;I am well satisfied with him, except on this point.&quot; 
  &quot;I am ready to leave you, professor, if you say the word,&quot; said   Walter, and he made a motion as if to jump out of the wagon. 
  &quot;No, no!&quot; exclaimed the professor, in alarm. &quot;I don't want you to   leave me.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I won't. I think it might be bad for you if I did,&quot; said  Walter,  with a significant look at the horseman. 
  &quot;Well, boy,&quot; said the outlaw, harshly, &quot;I can't waste my time here.   You sent me a message to come for my revolver myself if I wanted it.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, here I am. Now give me the weapon.&quot; 
  &quot;I think I shall have to decline.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you going back on your word?&quot; demanded the outlaw. 
  &quot;Not exactly.&quot; 
  &quot;Then what do you propose to do?&quot; 
  &quot;Keep along with us till we reach Stilwell. Then we will go before  a  magistrate. You will make your demand for the weapon, and in his   presence I will surrender it.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you take me for a fool?&quot; thundered the robber. 
  &quot;No, and I want you to understand that I am not a fool, either.&quot; 
  &quot;You are acting like a fool and a knave.&quot; 
  &quot;I should certainly be acting like a fool if I gave up the  revolver,  and had it immediately pointed at me or my companion, with a  demand  for our money.&quot; 
  &quot;But I gave you my word&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Of course you did, but I put no confidence in your word.&quot; 
  While this conversation was going on the poor professor looked on  and  listened with an expression of helplessness on his broad face. He  was  essentially a man of peace, and was by no means fitted to deal  with a  highwayman. 
  &quot;Look here,&quot; said the outlaw, after a pause, and in a milder tone,  &quot;I  have a special attachment for that weapon, or I would drop the  whole  matter and buy another one. But this was given me by an old pal,  now  dead, and I set great store by it. Professor, although the  revolver is  mine by rights, I will waive all that and offer you  twenty-five  dollars for it. That will pay you for all the trouble I  have put you  to.&quot; 
  Professor Robinson, though not a mean man, was fond of money, and  this  offer tempted him. It would be getting twenty-five dollars for   nothing, and that was a piece of good luck not likely to present   itself every day. 
  &quot;I accept your offer,&quot; he said gladly. 
  &quot;But I don't,&quot; put in Walter, calmly. &quot;Allow me to say that the   professor has no claim to the weapon. I took it with my own hand, and   it has never been in his possession.&quot; 
  &quot;All right! Then I'll give you twenty-five dollars for it.&quot; 
  &quot;I decline your offer.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd like to wring your neck, you young thief!&quot; 
  &quot;I have no doubt you would.&quot; 
  &quot;Once more, and for the last time, will you give me back that   revolver?&quot; 
  &quot;I have told you when and on what conditions I would surrender it.&quot; 
  &quot;When?&quot; 
  &quot;At Stilwell, in the presence of a magistrate.&quot; 
  &quot;You are very crafty. You want me to be arrested for attempted   robbery.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, that is my wish.&quot; 
  &quot;I've a great mind to snatch the revolver from you.&quot; 
  &quot;Come on, then!&quot; said Walter, holding it firmly, pointing at the   outlaw. 
  &quot;You've got the drop on me, youngster, but mark my word, I'll have   that weapon yet, and I'll punish you for giving me all this trouble.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you anything more to say?&quot; 
  &quot;No.&quot; 
  &quot;Then suppose you ride on. We have been delayed long enough.&quot; 
  The robber did go, but aimed a volley of imprecations at Walter, of   which the latter took no notice. 
  In the early evening they arrived at Stilwell and secured rooms at  the  hotel. 
  Among the guests was a cattleman from Dakota, who had been to  Chicago  with a herd of cattle and was now on his way back. He was loud  in his  complaints of a highwayman whom he had met two days previous,  who had  relieved him of a wallet containing five hundred dollars. 
  &quot;Won't you describe him?&quot; asked Walter, struck by a sudden  suspicion. 
  The cattle dealer did so. His description tallied with the personal   appearance of Walter's enemy. 
  &quot;Was he on foot?&quot; asked Walter. 
  &quot;No; he was on a black horse.&quot; 
  Walter nodded. 
  &quot;I know him,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Has he robbed you?&quot; 
  &quot;No; I have robbed him.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; inquired the cattle dealer, in wonder. 
  &quot;Do you recognize this?&quot; and Walter exhibited the revolver. 
  &quot;Yes; it looks like the revolver he pointed at me.&quot; 
  &quot;Probably it is.&quot; 
  &quot;But how do you happen to have it?&quot; 
  &quot;I took it from him.&quot; 
  &quot;You&#8212;a mere boy!&quot; exclaimed the cattle dealer, incredulously. 
  &quot;Yes. I will tell you about it.&quot; 
  And Walter gave an account of the circumstances under which the   revolver had come into his possession. 
  &quot;It is a handsome weapon,&quot; said the cattle dealer, taking it into  his  hands and examining it. &quot;It must be worth a hundred dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;I think I shall keep it for my own use,&quot; said Walter, quietly. 
  &quot;I'll give you seventy-five dollars for it.&quot; 
  &quot;I would rather not part with it. Indeed, I should not feel  justified  in selling it, considering the way it came into my hands.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, boy, you're a smart one; but I surmise you haven't seen the   last of the owner.&quot; 
  The speaker was right.
