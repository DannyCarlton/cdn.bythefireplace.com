Paul was half reclining against the wall, when he suddenly saw Henry look  up. Paul's eyes followed his comrade's, and then he heard a soft, faint  sound over their heads. He understood at once. Danger had come from a new  quarter. The Shawnees were upon the board roof, through which a rifle  bullet could easily pass. The menace was serious, but the men up there  could not see their targets below, and they themselves were in a  precarious position.    
Henry once pointed his rifle toward a portion of the roof from which a  slight sound came, but for a reason that he did not give he withheld his  fire. Then came a dead stillness, to be broken a few moments later by  fierce war cries all around the cabin and a crash of rapid shots. It  seemed to Paul that an attack in great force was being made from every  side, and, thrusting his rifle through the loophole, he fired quickly at  what he took to be the flitting form of a foe. The next moment he became  aware of a terrible struggle in the cabin itself. He heard a thud, the  roar of a rifle shot within the confined space, a fall, and then, in the  half darkness, he saw two powerful figures writhing to and fro. One was  Henry and the other a mighty Shawnee warrior, naked to the waist, and  striving to use a tomahawk that he held in a hand whose wrist was clenched  in the iron grasp of his foe. Lying almost at their feet was the body of  another warrior, stark and dead.    
Paul sprang forward, his second and loaded rifle in his hand.    
"No, no, Paul!" cried Henry. "The chimney! Look to the chimney!"    
Paul whirled about, and he was just in time. A savage warrior dropped down  the great wide chimney that all the log cabins had, and fell lightly on  his feet among the dead embers of a month ago. His face was distorted  horribly with ferocity, and Paul, all the rage of battle upon him now that  battle had come, fired squarely at the red forehead, the rifle muzzle only  three feet away. The savage fell back and lay still among the cinders. The  next instant the deep, long-drawn sigh of a life departing came from  behind, and Paul whirled about again, his heart full of sickening fear.    
But it was Henry who stood erect. He had wrenched the warrior's own  tomahawk from him, and had slain him with it. His face was flushed with a  victorious glow, but he stood there only a moment. Then he seized his own  second and loaded rifle, and ran to the chimney. But nothing more came  down it, and there were no more sounds of warriors walking on the roof.  The three who had come had been daring men, but they had paid the price.  The shots and shouts around continued for a little space, forms dashed  heavily against the door, and then, as suddenly as it began, the tumult  ceased.    
Paul felt a chill of horror creeping through his bones. It was all so  ghastly. The dead warriors lay, each upon his back, one among the dead  coals, and Paul could hear nothing but his own and Henry's heavy  breathing.    
"It was a daring thing to do," said Henry at last, "to come down the  chimney that way; but it has been done before in Kentucky."    
Then they reloaded their rifles, but Paul was like one in a dream. It  seemed to him now that he could not endure the long hours in the cabin  with those dead faces on the floor staring at him with their dead eyes.    
"Henry," he said, "we can't keep them here."    
"No," replied Henry, "we can't; but we must wait a little."    
Paul sat down on the bench. He felt for a moment faint and sick. The  little cabin was full of rifle smoke, and it lay heavy in his nostrils and  upon his lungs. He felt as if he were breathing poisoned air. But the  smoke gradually drifted away up the chimney, and the thick, clogging  feeling departed from his lungs and nostrils. Strength and spirit came  back.    
"How are we to get rid of them?" he asked, nodding toward the dead  warriors.    
"Let's wait an hour at least, and I'll show you," replied Henry.    
The hour passed, but to Paul it seemed two. Then Henry took the largest of  the warriors and dragged him to the wall just beneath the window. The  second and third he did the same way.    
"Now, Paul," he said, "you must take down the bar and open the window.  Then I'll pitch them out. The besiegers will be surprised, and they won't  have time to get at us."    
Paul accepted his part of the task eagerly. There might be danger, but  better that than having the dead men lying on the floor and staring at him  with dead eyes. He took down the bar and quickly held the window open.  Henry heaved up the bodies of the warriors and cast them out, one by one,  each falling with a dull, heavy sound to the ground below. Then Paul  slammed back the window and shot the bar into place. As he did so three  or four rifles flashed from the forest, and the bullets pattered upon the  heavy oaken shutter.    
"Too late," said Henry, "We took 'em by surprise, as I thought we should."    
Paul drew a long and deep breath. The cabin had taken on a brighter  aspect.    
"I'm mighty glad that's done," he said.    
"If you'll listen carefully, I think you'll hear something later," said  Henry.    
Henry was right. In about half an hour they heard soft, shuffling noises  beside the cabin, just under the window.    
"They're taking away the dead warriors," said Henry.    
"I don't want to fire on them while they're doing it," said Paul.    
"Nor I," said Henry. "We might reach 'em, but I'm glad they're doing what  they are."    
The slight, sliding noises continued for a little while, and then they  heard only the light sweep of the rain. On the roof it became a patter,  and here and there a drop made its way between the boards and fell on the  floor. It was soothing to Paul after the excitement of those terrible  moments, and he felt a queer, pleasant languor. His eyes half closed, but  his vague look fell on somber, dark spots on the floor, and the sight was  repellent to him. He went to the hearth, heaped up the whole of the embers  and ashes, and sprinkled them carefully over the spots, which would have  been red in the light, but which were black in the night and gloom of the  cabin. Henry watched him do it, but said nothing. He understood Paul, and  gave him his sympathy.    
Paul sat down again on the floor, and leaned against the wall. The  pleasant, languorous feeling came once more, but he was roused suddenly by  scattered rifle shots, and sprang up. Henry laughed.    
"They're not attacking," he said. "It was only a volley, fired from the  wood, to show how angry they are. I don't think we need expect anything  more to-night. You might really go to sleep, Paul, if you feel like it."    
"No, I will not!" exclaimed Paul with energy. "I won't do all the  sleeping, and let you do all the watching. Besides, I couldn't sleep,  anyhow; my nerves wouldn't let me. I looked sleepy just because I was  tired, it's your time."    
"All right," said Henry. "Now, you watch good, Paul."    
Then Henry lay down upon the floor and closed his eyes. He might not have  done so, but he felt sure that nothing more would be attempted that  night; and if, by any chance, they should attack again, Paul would be  sure to waken him in time. The rain grew harder on the roof, and its  steady patter was like the rocking of a cradle to a child. His nerves were  of steel, and the mechanism of his body and brain were not upset at all.  The half-dropped lids dropped down entirely, and he slept, breathing  peacefully.    
Paul watched, his brief lethargy gone; but his accustomed eyes could see  little now through the loopholes, only the dim forest and the rain,  falling slowly but steadily. He and Henry seemed to be alone in the world.  Outside all the wilderness was in gloom, but in the little cabin it was  dry and warm. The few drops that came through the boards now and then, and  fell with a little pat on the floor, were nothing. He and Henry were dry  and safe, and it seemed to him that so far, at least, they had all the  better of the battle. The glow of triumph came again.    
Paul watched until dawn, and saw the sun spring up over the eastern  forests. Then he awakened Henry, and the great youth, stretching himself,  uttered a long sigh.    
"That was fine, Paul!" he said, "fine! Now, what are our friends outside  doing?"    
"Nothing that I can see. There are only stumps in the clearing, and trees  and hushes in the forest. I see no warrior."    
Henry laughed, and his laugh had a most cheerful tone.    
"They are not far away," he said. "It is likely they'll try to starve us  out, or rather conquer us with thirst. They don't know anything about our  barrel of water."    
"Blessed barrel!" ejaculated Paul.    
It seemed that Henry was right in his prediction. As long hours passed,  the sun rose higher and higher, and it grew very close in the little  cabin. Paul thought the warriors must have gone away, disgusted with their  losses, but Henry cautioned him against savage patience. Toward noon they  ate a little more of their pigeon and dried venison, and Paul looked with  some dismay at the small portions that were left.    
"Henry," he exclaimed, "there is enough for supper, and no more."    
"Just so," said Henry, "and our enemies remain on guard. They'll wait for  us."    
He thought it best to put the case plainly and in all its hideous phases  to Paul. While savages sometimes abandoned a siege very soon, they did not  show signs of ceasing now. Perhaps they relied on starving out the  besieged, and if they only knew the state of affairs within the cabin  theirs was a good reliance.    
Their brief dinner over, the two boys sat down on the floor, and from the  loopholes on either side watched the forest. To Paul the whole air and  atmosphere of the cabin had now become intolerably oppressive. At first it  had been such a strong, snug place of refuge that he rejoiced, but at last  his sensitive spirit was weighed down by the long delay, the gloom, and  the silence. The sight of their limited rations brought to him all the  future--the vigilant enemy on guard, the last little piece of food gone,  then slow starvation, or a rush on the savage bullets and sure death. As  usual, his uncommon imagination was depicting everything in vivid colors,  far in advance.    
But he said nothing, nor did Henry. They had already exhausted all  subjects for talk, and they waited--Henry with real, and Paul with assumed  patience. Fully two hours passed in silence, but after that time it was  naturally Paul who spoke first.    
"Henry," he said in a tone that indicated unbelief in his own words,  "don't you think that they must have got tired and gone away?"    
"No, they are surely in the forest about us; but since they won't go,  Paul, you and I must leave to-night."    
"What do you mean?" Paul's words expressed the greatest surprise.    
Henry stood up, and figure, face, and words alike showed the greatest  decision.    
"Paul," he said, "our last piece of venison will soon be gone, and the  Shawnees, I think, will stay, expecting to starve us out, which they can  do; but the night shows all the signs of being very dark, and you and I  must slip through their lines some way or other. Are you ready to try it?"    
It was like a signal to Paul, those words, "Are you ready to try it?" He  was ready to try anything now, as a release from the cabin, and a fine  flare of color mounted to his cheeks as he replied:    
"I'll follow you anywhere, Henry."    
Henry said nothing more; Paul's reply was sufficient; but he resumed his  position at the loophole, and attentively watched the heavens. Somber  clouds were rolling up from the southwest and the air was growing cooler,  but heavy with damp. Already the sun, so bright and pitiless in the  morning, was obscured, and mists and vapors hung over the forest. He  judged that it would be a dark night, with flurries of mist and rain, just  suited to his purpose, and he felt a sensation of relief.    
"Paul," he said, after a while, "I think we'd better take the two captured  rifles with us again. If we come face to face with 'em, a couple of extra  shots might save us."    
"Whatever you say, Henry," replied Paul.    
The afternoon passed slowly away, and the night came on thick and dark, as  Henry had hoped. The rain fell again in intermittent showers, and it was  carried in gusts by the wind. The two boys drank deeply from the barrel,  and ate what was left of the venison.    
"Be sure your powder horns are stopped up tight, Paul," said Henry. "We've  got to keep our powder dry. The sooner we go the better, because the  Shawnees won't be expecting us to come out so soon."    
The darkness was now rolling up so thick and black that to Paul it seemed  like a great sable curtain dropping its folds over them. It enveloped the  forest, then the clearing, then the hut, and those within it. The inky sky  was without a star. The puffs of rain rattled dismally on the roof of the  old cabin. But all this somberness of nature brought comfort and lightness  of heart to the besieged. Paul's spirits rose with the blackness of the  night and the wildness of the rain.    
"Are you all ready, Paul?" asked Henry.    
"Yes," replied Paul cheerfully.    
Accustomed as they were to the darkness of the cabin, they could not see  each other's faces now, only the merest outlines of their figures.    
"We must keep close together," said Henry. "It won't do to lose sight of  each other."    
He slipped to the door, lifted the bar and put it soundlessly on one side,  and he and Paul stood together in the open space, just a moment, waiting  and listening.    
The rush of air and raindrops on Paul's face felt wonderfully cool and  invigorating. His chest expanded and his spirits rose to the top. It was  like leaving a prison behind.    
"Step more lightly than you ever did before in your life," said Henry, and  he and Paul put foot together on mother earth. The very pressure of the  damp earth felt good to Paul all the way through his moccasins. A step or  two from the door they paused again, waiting and listening. The forest was  invisible, and so were the stumps in the clearing. But nothing stirred.  Henry's acute ear told him that.    
"We'll follow the wall around to the other side of the cabin," he  whispered to Paul. "They don't know yet that we've come out, and naturally  they'll watch the door closest. Be careful where you put your feet."    
But the very dampness prevented any rustle in the weeds and grass, and  they passed to the other side of the cabin without an alarm coming from  the forest. There they paused again, and once more Henry whispered his  instructions.    
"I think we'd better get down and crawl," he said. "It's a hard thing to  do with two rifles each, but we must do it until we get to the woods."    
It was difficult, as Henry had said, and Paul felt, too, a sense of  humiliation; but then one's life was at stake, and without hesitation he  dropped to his knees, crawling slowly after the dark figure of his  comrade. Henry made no sound and Paul but a little, not enough to be heard  ten feet away. Henry stopped now and then, as if he would listen intently  a moment or two, and Paul, of course, stopped just behind him. Fortune  seemed to favor their daring. The great silence lasted, broken only by  puffs of wind and rain, and the wet leaves of the forest rubbing softly  against each other. Paul looked back once. The cabin was already melting  into a blur, although not twenty yards distant, and in as many yards more  it would be lost completely in the surrounding darkness.    
Now the forest was only a few yards away, but to Paul it seemed very far.  His knees and wrists began to ache, and the two rifles became awkward for  him to carry. He wondered how Henry could go forward with so much ease,  but he resolved to persist as long as his comrade led the way.    
The dark outline of the wood slowly came nearer, then nearer yet, and then  they entered it, pressing silently among the hushes and the black shadows  of the lofty trees. Here Henry rose to his feet and Paul imitated him,  thankful to rest his aching knees and wrists, and to stand up in the form  and spirit of a man.    
"We may slip through unseen and unheard," whispered Henry, "and then again  we may not. Come on; we'll need all our caution now."    
But as they took the first step erect, a cry arose behind them, a cry so  full of ferocity and chagrin that Paul absolutely shuddered from head to  foot. It came from the clearing, near the hut, and Paul, without the  telling of it, knew what had happened.    
"They've tried the door of the cabin, only to find it open and the place  empty," whispered Henry. "Now, we must not go too fast, Paul. In this  pitchy darkness not even a Shawnee could see us ten feet away, but he  could hear us. No noise, Paul!"    
They stole forward, one close behind the other, going but slowly, seeking  with sedulous care to avoid any noise that would bring the savages upon  them. The rain, which had grown steadier, was a Godsend. It and the wind  together kept up a low, moaning sound that hid the faint pressure of  Paul's footsteps. The cry behind them at the cabin was repeated once,  echoing away through the black and dripping forest. After that Paul heard  nothing, but to the keener ears of Henry came now and then the soft,  sliding sound of rapid footsteps, a word or two uttered low, and the faint  swish of bushes, swinging back into place after a body passed. He knew  that the warriors were now seeking eagerly for them, but with the aid of  the intense darkness he hoped that he and Paul would steal safely through  their lines. They went slowly forward for perhaps half an hour, stopping  often and listening. Once Henry's hand on Paul's shoulder, they sank a  little lower in the bushes, and Henry, but not Paul, saw the shadowy  outline of a figure passing near.    
Fortunately the forest was very dense, but unfortunately the clouds began  to thicken, and a rumble dull and low came from the far horizon. Then the  clouds parted, cut squarely down the middle by a flash of lightning, and  for a moment a dazzling glow of light played over the dripping forest.  Everything was revealed by it, every twig and leaf stood out in startling  distinctness, and Paul, by impulse, sank lower to hide himself among the  bushes.    
The glow vanished and Henry had seen nothing; he was sure, too, that no  one had seen them, but he knew that it was only luck; another flash might  reveal them, and he and Paul must now hasten, taking the chances of  discovery by noise. He spoke a word to his comrade, and they plunged more  rapidly through the undergrowth. The thunder kept up an unceasing and  threatening murmur on the far horizon, and the lightning flared fitfully  now and then, but they were still unseen, and Henry hoped that they had  now passed the ring of savages in the forest and the dusk.    
Paul had dropped back from Henry's side, but was following closely behind  him. He was deeply impressed by a situation so extraordinary for one of  his type. The thunder, the lightning, the darkness and the danger  contained for him all the elements of awe and mystery.    
"I think we've shaken them off," said Henry presently, "and unless the  lightning shows us to some stray member of the band they can't pick up our  trail again before morning."    
Paul was grateful for the assurance, and he noticed, too, that the danger  of the lightning's revelation was decreasing, as the flashes were becoming  less frequent and vivid. His breathing now grew easier and his spirits  rose. Much of the gloom departed from the forest. The thunder that had  kept up a continuous low rolling, like a dirge, died away, and the  lightning, after a few more weak and ineffectual flashes, ceased.    
"We won't have any further trouble to-night, that's sure," said Henry.  "They could not possibly find our trail before day, and I think we'd  better push on, as nearly as we can, in the direction of our hidden  powder. You know we still mean to do what we started out to do."    
They traveled all night, with brief periods of rest, through rough and  densely wooded country. Toward morning the rain ceased, and the clouds all  floated away. The stars came out in a clear sky, and a warm wind blew over  the wet forest. Henry looked more than once at Paul, and his look was  always full of sympathy. Paul's face was pale, but his expression was set  in firm resolve, and Henry knew that he would never yield.    
After a while the dark began to lighten, and Henry stopped short in  surprise. Paul was walking in such automatic fashion that he almost ran  against him before he stopped. Henry pointed with a long forefinger to a  red spot deep in the forest.    
"See that?" he said.    
"Yes, I guess it's the sun rising," said Paul, who was staggering a  little, and who saw through a cloud, as it were.    
Henry looked at him and laughed.    
"The sun!" he said. "Well, Paul, it's the first time I ever knew the sun  to rise in the west."    
"The sun's likely to do anything out here where we are," rejoined Paul.    
"That's a fire, a camp fire, Paul," said Henry, "and I'm thinking it must  be made by white men."    
"White men! Friends!" exclaimed Paul. He stood up straight, and his eyes  grew brighter. An hour or two ago it had scarcely seemed possible to him  that they should ever see white faces again.    
"It's only my belief," said Henry. "We've got to make sure. Now, you wait  here, Paul, and I'll do a little bit of scouting. Sit down among those  bushes there and I'll be back soon."    
Paul was fully content to do what Henry said. He found a good place in a  thick clump of underbrush, and sank down easily. He would have been quite  willing to lie down, because he was terribly tired and sleepy, but with an  effort he held himself to a sitting posture and watched Henry. He was  conscious of a vague admiration as the tall form of his comrade went  forward swiftly, making no noise and hiding itself so quickly in the  forest that he could not tell where it had gone.    
Then Paul was conscious of a great peace, and a heavy tugging at his  eyelids. Never in his life before was he so tired and sleepy. The last  raindrop was gone, and the bushes and grass were drying in the gentle  wind. A fine golden sun was bringing with it a silver dawn, and a pleasant  warmth stole all through him. His head sank back a little more and his  elbow found a soft place in the turf.    
The boy, with his half-closed eyes and pale face, was not alone as he lay  there among the bushes. Little neighbors came and looked at the newcomer.  A hare gazed solemnly at him for a moment or two, and then hopped solemnly  away. A bluebird flew down to the very tip of a bough, surveyed him at  leisure, and then flew off in search of food. Neither hare nor bird was  scared. Tiny creeping things scuttled through the grass, but the boy did  not move, and they scuttled on undisturbed.    
Paul was just sinking away into a pleasant unknown land when a shout  brought him back to earth. He sprang to his feet, and there was Henry  returning through the forest.    
"Friends, Paul! Old friends!" he cried. "Up with you and we'll pay 'em a  surprise visit!"    
Paul shook his head to clear his thoughts, and followed Henry. Henry  walked swiftly now, not seeming to care whether or not he made noise, and  Paul followed him toward the fire, which now rapidly grew larger.
