  As soon as he had passed from the view of the cabin door Aldous  shortened his pace. He knew that never in his life had he needed to  readjust himself more than at the present moment. A quarter of an hour  had seen a complete and miraculous revolution within him. It was a  change so unusual and apparently so impossible that he could not grasp  the situation and the fact all at once. But the truth of it swept over  him more and more swiftly as he made his way along the dark, narrow  trail that led up to the Miette Plain. It was something that not only  amazed and thrilled him. First&#8212;as in all things&#8212;he saw the humour of  it. He, John Aldous of all men, had utterly obliterated himself, and  for a<I> woman</I>. He had even gone so far as to offer the sacrifice  of his most important work. Frankly he had told Joanne that she  interested him more just now than his book. Again he repeated to  himself that it had not been a surrender&#8212;but an obliteration. With a  pair of lovely eyes looking quietly into him, he had wiped the slate  clean of the things he had preached for ten years and the laws he had  made for himself. And as he came in sight of the big Otto tent, he  found himself smiling, his breath coming quickly, strange voices  singing within him.
  He stopped to load and light his pipe before he faced Mrs. Otto, and  he clouded himself in as much smoke as possible while he explained to  her that he had almost forced Joanne to stop at his cabin and eat  partridges with him. He learned that the Tete Jaune train could not go  on until the next day, and after Mrs. Otto had made him take a loaf of  fresh bread and a can of home-made marmalade as a contribution to their  feast, he turned back toward the cabin, trying to whistle in his old  careless way.
  The questions he had first asked himself about Joanne forced  themselves back upon him now with deeper import. Almost unconsciously  he had revealed himself to her. He had spread open for her eyes and  understanding the page which he had so long hidden. He had as much as  confessed to her that she had come to change him&#8212;to complete what he  had only half created. It had been an almost inconceivable and daring  confession, and he believed that she understood him. More than that,  she had read about him. She had read his books. She knew John  Aldous&#8212;the man.
  But what did he know about her beyond the fact that her name was  Joanne Gray, and that the on-sweeping Horde had brought her into his  life as mysteriously as a storm might have flung him a bit of down from  a swan's breast? Where had she come from? And why was she going to Tete  Jaune? It must be some important motive was taking her to a place like  Tete Jaune, the rail-end, a place of several thousand men, with its  crude muscle and brawn and the seven passions of man. It was an  impossible place for a young and beautiful woman unprotected. If Joanne  had known any one among the engineers or contractors, or had she  possessed a letter of introduction to them, the tense lines would not  have gathered so deeply about the corners of Aldous' mouth. But these  men whose brains were behind the Horde&#8212;the engineers and the  contractors&#8212;knew what women alone and unprotected meant at Tete Jaune.  Such women floated in with the Horde. And Joanne was going in with the  Horde. There lay the peril&#8212;and the mystery of it.
  So engrossed was Aldous in his thoughts that he had come very  quietly to the cabin door. It was Joanne's voice that roused him. Sweet  and low she was singing a few lines from a song which he had never  heard.
  She stopped when Aldous appeared at the door. It seemed to him that  her eyes were a deeper, more wonderful blue as she looked up at him,  and smiled. She had found a towel for an apron, and was peeling  potatoes.
  &#8220;You will have some unusual excuses to make very soon,&#8221; she greeted  him. &#8220;We had a visitor while you were gone. I was washing the potatoes  when I looked up to find a pair of the fiercest, reddest moustaches I  have ever seen, ornamenting the doorway. The man had two eyes that  seemed about to fall out when he saw me. He popped away like a  rabbit&#8212;and&#8212;and&#8212;there's something he left behind in his haste!&#8221;
  Joanne's eyes were flooded with laughter as she nodded at the door.  On the sill was a huge quid of tobacco.
  &#8220;Stevens!&#8221; Aldous chuckled. &#8220;God bless my soul, if you frightened  him into giving up a quid of tobacco like that you sure<I> did</I>  startle him some!&#8221; He kicked Stevens' lost property out with the toe of  his boot and turned to Joanne, showing her the fresh bread and  marmalade. &#8220;Mrs. Otto sent these to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the train won't  leave until to-morrow.&#8221;
  In her silence he pulled a chair in front of her, sat down close,  and thrust the point of his hunting knife into one of the two remaining  potatoes.
  &#8220;And when it does go I'm going with you,&#8221; he added.
  He expected this announcement would have some effect on her. As she  jumped up with the pan of potatoes, leaving the one still speared on  the end of his knife, he caught only the corner of a bewitching smile.
  &#8220;You still believe that I will be unable to take care of myself up  at this terrible Tete Jaune?&#8221; she asked, bending for a moment over the  table. &#8220;Do you?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. You can care for yourself anywhere, Ladygray,&#8221; he repeated.  &#8220;But I am quite sure that it will be less troublesome for me to see  that no insults are offered you than for you to resent those insults  when they come. Tete Jaune is full of Quades,&#8221; he added.
  The smile was gone from her face when she turned to him. Her blue  eyes were filled with a tense anxiety.
  &#8220;I had almost forgotten that man,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;And you mean that  you would fight for me&#8212;again?&#8221;
  &#8220;A thousand times.&#8221;
  The colour grew deeper in her cheeks. &#8220;I read something about you  once that I have never forgotten, John Aldous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was after  you returned from Thibet. It said that you were largely made up of two  emotions&#8212;your contempt for woman and your love of adventure; that it  would be impossible for you not to see a flaw in one, and that for the  other&#8212;physical excitement&#8212;you would go to the ends of the earth.  Perhaps it is this&#8212;your desire for adventure&#8212;that makes you want to  go with me to Tete Jaune?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am beginning to believe that it will be the greatest adventure of  my life,&#8221; he replied, and something in his quiet voice held her silent.  He rose to his feet, and stood before her. &#8220;It is already the Great  Adventure,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;I feel it. And I am the one to judge. Until  to-day I would have staked my life that no power could have wrung from  me the confession I am going to make to you voluntarily. I have laughed  at the opinion the world has held of me. To me it has all been a  colossal joke. I have enjoyed the hundreds of columns aimed at me by  excited women through the press. They have all asked the same question:  Why do you not write of the good things in women instead of always the  bad? I have never given them an answer. But I answer you now&#8212;here. I  have not picked upon the weaknesses of women because I despise them.  Those weaknesses&#8212;the destroying frailties of womankind&#8212;I have driven  over rough-shod through the pages of my books because I have always  believed that Woman was the one thing which God came nearest to  creating<I> perfect</I>. I believe they should be perfect. And because  they have not quite that perfection which should be theirs I have  driven the cold facts home as hard as I could. I have been a fool and  an iconoclast instead of a builder. This confession to you is proof  that you have brought me face to face with the greatest adventure of  all.&#8221;
  The colour in her cheeks had centred in two bright spots. Her lips  formed words which came slowly, strangely.
  &#8220;I guess&#8212;I understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps I, too, would have been  that kind of an iconoclast&#8212;if I could have put the things I have  thought into written words.&#8221; She drew a deep breath, and went on, her  eyes full upon him, speaking as if out of a dream. &#8220;The Great  Adventure&#8212;for you. Yes; and perhaps for both.&#8221;
  Her hands were drawn tightly to her breast. Something about her as  she stood there, her back to the table, drew John Aldous to her side,  forced the question from his lips: &#8220;Tell me, Ladygray&#8212;why are you  going to Tete Jaune?&#8221;
  In that same strange way, as if her lips were framing words beyond  their power to control, she answered:
  &#8220;I am going&#8212;to find&#8212;my husband.&#8221;
