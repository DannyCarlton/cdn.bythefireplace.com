  When the slow retreat began Dick looked for the sergeant. But a  stalwart figure, a red bandage around the head, rose up and confronted  him. It was Sergeant Whitley himself, a little unsteady yet on his  feet, but soon to be as good as ever.
  &#8220;Thank you for looking for me, Mr. Mason,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I came to,  some time ago. I guess the bullet found my skull too hard, 'cause it  just ran 'roun' it, and came out on the other side. I won't even be  scarred, as my hair covers up the place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Can you walk all right?&#8221; asked Dick, overjoyed to find the sergeant  was not hurt badly.
  &#8220;Of course I can, Mr. Mason, an' I'm proud to have been with General  Thomas in such a battle. I didn't think human bein's could do what our  men have done.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor did I. It was impossible, but we've done it all the same.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester rejoiced no less than the lads over the  sergeant's escape. All the officers of the regiment liked him, and they  had an infinite respect for his wisdom, particularly when danger was  running high. They were glad for his own sake that he was alive, and  they were glad to have him with them as they retreated into  Chattanooga, because the night still had its perils.
  The moon, though clouded, was out as they withdrew slowly. On their  flanks there was still firing, as strong detachments skirmished with  one another, but the Winchester men as yet paid little attention to it.  They said grimly to one another that two days in the infernal regions  were enough for one time. They looked back at the vast battlefield and  the clumps of pines burning now like funeral torches, and shuddered.
  The retreat of Thomas was harried incessantly. Longstreet and  Forrest were eager to push the attack that night and the next day and  make the victory complete. They and men of less rank dreamed of a  triumph which should restore the fortunes of the Confederacy to the  full, but Bragg was cautious. He did not wish to incur the uttermost  risk, and the roll of his vast losses might well give him pause also.
  Nevertheless Southern infantry and cavalry hung on the flanks and  rear of the withdrawing Union force. The cloudy moon gave sufficient  light for the sharpshooters, whose rifles flashed continuously. The  lighter field guns moved from the forests and bushes, and the troops of  Thomas were compelled to turn again and again to fight them off.
  The Winchester regiment was on the extreme flank, where the men were  exposed to the fiercest attacks, but fortunately the thickets and hills  gave them much shelter. At times they lay down and returned the fire of  the enemy until they beat him off. Then they would rise and march on  again.
  All the officers had lost their horses, and Colonel Winchester  strode at the head of his men. Just behind were Dick, Pennington and  some other members of his staff. The rest had fallen. Further back was  Sergeant Whitley, his head in a red bandage, but all his faculties  returned. In this dire emergency he was taking upon himself the duties  of a commissioned officer, and there was none to disobey him. Once more  was the wise veteran showing himself a very bulwark of strength.
  Despite the coolness of the night, they had all suffered on the  second day of the battle from a burning thirst. And now after their  immense exertions it grew fiercer than ever. Dick's throat and mouth  were parched, and he felt as if he were breathing fire. He felt that he  must have water or die. All the men around him were panting, and he  knew they were suffering the same torture.
  &#8220;This country ought to be full of brooks and creeks,&#8221; he said to  Pennington. &#8220;If I see water I mean to make a dash for it, Johnnies or  no Johnnies. I'm perfectly willing to risk my life for a drink.&#8221;
  &#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Warner, who overheard him, &#8220;and so are all who are  left in this regiment. If they see the flash of water nothing can hold  them back, not even Bragg's whole army. How those skirmishers hang on  to us! Whizz-z! there went their bullets right over our head!&#8221;
  The Winchesters turned, delivered a heavy volley into a thicket,  whence the bullets had come, and marched on, looking eagerly now for  water. They began to talk about it. They spoke of the cool brooks,  &#8220;branches&#8221; they called them, that they had known at home, and they told  how, when they found one, they would first drink of it, and then lie  down in its bed and let its water flow over them.
  But Dick's thirst could not wholly take his mind from the tremendous  scenes accompanying that sullen and defiant retreat. Hills and  mountains were in deepest gloom, save when the signal lights of the  Southern armies flashed back and forth. The clouded moon touched  everything nearer by with somber gray. The fire of cannon rolled  through the forest and gorges with redoubled echoes.
  A shout suddenly came from the head of the Winchester column.
  &#8220;Water! Water!&#8221; they cried. A young boy had caught a glimpse of  silver through some bushes, and he knew that it was made by the swift  current of a brook. In an instant the regiment broke into a run for the  water. Colonel Winchester could not have stopped them if he had tried,  and he did not try. He knew how great was their need.
  &#8220;We're off!&#8221; cried Pennington.
  &#8220;I see it! The water!&#8221; shouted Dick.
  &#8220;I do, too!&#8221; exclaimed Warner, &#8220;and it's the most beautiful water  that ever flowed!&#8221;
  But they stopped in their rush and dropped down in the thickets.  Sergeant Whitley had given the warning shout, and fortunately most of a  volley from a point about a hundred yards beyond the stream swept over  their heads. A few men were wounded, and they not badly.
  Dick crawled to the head of the column. The sergeant was already  there, whispering to Colonel Winchester.
  &#8220;They've taken to cover, too, sir,&#8221; said the sergeant.
  &#8220;How many do you suppose they are?&#8221; asked the colonel.
  &#8220;Not more than we are, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;They run a great risk when they attack us in this manner.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe, sir,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;they, too, were coming for the water.&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester looked at Sergeant Whitley.
  &#8220;I'm of the opinion, sir,&#8221; said the sergeant, &#8220;that Mr. Mason is  right.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester. &#8220;It's a pity that men  should kill each other over a drink of water when there's enough for  all. Has any man a handkerchief?&#8221;
  &#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; said Warner; &#8220;it's ragged and not very clean, but I  hope it will do.&#8221;
  The Colonel raised the handkerchief on the point of his sword and  gave a hail. The bulk of the two armies had passed on, and now there  was silence in the woods as the two little forces confronted each other  across the stream.
  Dick saw a tall form in Confederate gray rise up from the bushes on  the other side of the brook.
  &#8220;Are you wanting to surrender?&#8221; the man called in a long, soft  drawl.
  &#8220;Not by any means. We want a drink of water, and we're just bound to  have it.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't want it any more than we do, and you're not any more  bound to have it than we are.&#8221;
  The colonel hesitated a moment, and then, influenced by a generous  impulse, said:
  &#8220;If you won't fire, we won't.&#8221;
  The tall, elderly Southerner, evidently a colonel, also said:
  &#8220;It's a fair proposition, sir. My men have been working so hard the  last two days licking you Yanks that they're plum' burnt up with  thirst.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't admit the licking, although it's obvious that you've gained  the advantage so far, but is it agreed that we shall have a truce for a  quarter of an hour?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is, sir; the truce of the water, and may we drink well! Come on,  boys!&#8221;
  Colonel Winchester gave a similar order to his men, and each side  rose from the thickets, and made a rush for the brook. It was a  beautiful little stream, the most beautiful in the world just then to  Dick and his friends. Clear and cold, the color of silver in the  moonlight, it rushed down from the mountains. On one side knelt the men  in blue, and on the other the men in gray, and the pure water was like  the elixir of heaven to their parched and burning throats.
  Dick drank long, and then as he raised his face from the stream he  saw opposite him a tall, lean youth, evidently from the far South,  Louisiana perhaps, a lad with a tanned face and a wide mouth stretched  in a friendly grin.
  &#8220;Tastes good, doesn't it, Yank?&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Yes, it does, Reb,&#8221; replied Dick. &#8220;I felt that I was drying up and  just crumbling away like old dead wood. As soon as the gallon that I've  drunk has percolated thoroughly through my system I intend to hoist  aboard another gallon.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know what percolate means, but I reckon it has something to  do with travelin' about through your system. I think I need a couple of  gallons myself. Say, will you give a fair answer to a fair question?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, go ahead.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you Yanks feel powerful bad over the thrashing we've given  you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not so bad. Besides I wouldn't call it a thrashing. It's just a  temporary advantage. And you wait. We'll take it away from you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know about that, but I can't argue with you now. I'm due  for my second gallon.&#8221;
  &#8220;So am I.&#8221;
  Each bent down and drank again a long, life-giving draught from the  rushing stream. For a distance of a hundred yards or more heads black,  brown and sometimes yellow were bent over the brook. Far off, both to  east and west, the cannon thundered in the darkness, but with the  drinkers it was a peaceful interlude of a quarter of an hour. Such  moments often occurred in this war when the men on both sides were  blood brethren.
  Colonel Winchester stood up, and the grizzled Confederate colonel  stood up on the other side of the stream, facing him. Their hands rose  in a simultaneous salute of respect.
  &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, &#8220;I'm happy to have met you in this  manner.&#8221;
  &#8220;Sir,&#8221; said the Southern colonel ornately, &#8220;we are happy to have  drunk from the same stream with such brave foes, and now, sir, I  propose as we retire that neither regiment shall fire a shot within the  next five minutes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Agreed,&#8221; said Colonel Winchester, and then as the colonels gave the  signals the two regiments withdrew beyond their respective thickets.  The truce of the water was over, but these foes did not meet again that  night.
  The regiment had left a great proportion of its numbers dead upon  the field. Half the others were wounded more or less, but the slightly  wounded marched on with the unhurt. Many of them were now barely  conscious. They were either asleep upon their feet or in a daze.  Nevertheless they soon rejoined the main command.
  Dick, having his pride as an officer, sought to keep himself active  and alert. He passed among the lads of his own age, and encouraged  them. He told them how the older men were already speaking of the  wonders they had done, and presently he saw Thomas himself riding along  with the young general, Garfield, who had been with him throughout the  afternoon. All the Winchester men saw their commander, and, worn as  they were, they stopped and gave a mighty cheer. Thomas was moved.  Under the cloudy moon Dick saw him show emotion for the first time. He  took off his hat.
  &#8220;Gentlemen, comrades,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have lost the battle of  Chickamauga, but if all our regiments fight as you fought to-day the  war is won.&#8221;
  Another cheer, enthusiastic and spontaneous, burst from the  regiment, and Thomas rode on. Dick had never heard him make another  speech so long.
  When they reached the little town of Chattanooga within its  mountains they began to realize the full grandeur of their exploit. The  remainder of the army of Rosecrans was almost a mob, and brave as he  undoubtedly was he was soon removed to another field, leaving Thomas in  supreme command until Grant should come.
  Dick had no rest until the next night, when tents were set for the  battered remains of the Winchester regiment. He, Warner, Pennington and  three others were assigned to one of the larger tents. He had been  without sleep for two days and two nights, and the tremendous tension  that had kept him up so long was relaxing fast. He felt that he must  sleep or die. Yet they talked together a little before they stretched  themselves upon their blankets.
  &#8220;Do you think Bragg will attack us in Chattanooga, Dick?&#8221; asked  Pennington.
  &#8220;I don't. Our position here is too strong, and, as he was the  assailant, his losses must be something awful. Moreover, the rivers are  always ours and reinforcements will soon pour in to us. I think that  General Thomas saved the Union. What have you to say, George?&#8221;
  &#8220;Just about what you are saying, Dick. We've been beaten, but not  enough to suit the Johnnies. They have on their side present victory.  We have on ours present but not total defeat. You might say they have  x, while we have x + y. Wait until I look into my algebra, and I can  find further mathematical and beautiful propositions proving my  contention beyond the shadow of a doubt.&#8221;
  He took out his algebra and opened it. A bullet fell from the leaves  into his lap. Warner picked it up and examined it carefully. Then he  looked at the book.
  &#8220;It went half way through,&#8221; he said in tones of genuine solemnity.  &#8220;If it had gone all the way it would have pierced my heart and I could  never have known how this war is going to end. It has saved my life,  and I shall always keep it over my heart until we go back home.&#8221;
  Dick was asleep the next minute, and they did not wake him for  twelve hours. When he came from the tent he stood blinking in the sun,  and a tall lean youth hailed him with a joyous shout:
  &#8220;Why, it's Mason&#8212;Mason of Kentucky!&#8221; exclaimed the lad, extending a  hardened hand. &#8220;I'm glad you're alive. How are those friends of yours,  Warner and Pennington?&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, save for scratches, Ohio. They're about somewhere.&#8221;
  They shook hands again, hunted up the others, and celebrated their  escape from death.
  Dick learned later that all the Woodvilles were still alive and that  Colonel Kenton, although wounded, was recovering fast. Slade, with  troublesome raids, soon gave evidence of his own continued existence.
  Then, as they expected, reinforcements poured in. Grant came, and  Dick and his comrades took part in the fight at Missionary Ridge and  the battle &#8220;above the clouds&#8221; on Lookout Mountain. He witnessed great  triumphs and he had a share in them.
  He saw Bragg's army broken up, and he rejoiced with the others when  the news came that Grant for his brilliant successes had been made  commander of all the armies of the Union, and would go east to match  himself against the mighty Lee. The Winchester regiment would go with  him and Dick, Warner, Pennington and Sergeant Whitley, who was entirely  recovered, talked of it gravely:
  &#8220;We've been in the East before,&#8221; said Pennington, &#8220;but we won't be  under any doubting general now.&#8221;
  &#8220;I fancy it will be the death grapple,&#8221; said Warner.
  &#8220;And the continent will shake with it,&#8221; said Dick.
  The three, as if by the same impulse, turned and faced the distant  East, where the shades were already gathering over the Wilderness.
