  James repeated to his father what Herbert had told him, and the  squire  jumped to the conclusion that Herbert and his mother were in  his  power, and must accede to his demand. He decided to take advantage  of  their necessities, and allow only three hundred dollars for the  house. 
  He entered the little house with the air of a proprietor. 
  &#8220;I suppose you know my errand, Mrs. Carter,&#8221; he said pompously. 
  &#8220;I believe this is interest day,&#8221; returned the widow. 
  &#8220;Yes. I presume you have by this time seen the folly of holding on  to  the place. You can't afford it, and it is best to accept my offer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My mother and I have thought it over, and decided to sell,&#8221; said   Herbert. 
  &#8220;I am glad you are so sensible,&#8221; observed Squire Leech, in a tone  of  satisfaction. &#8220;I will give you three hundred dollars over and above   the mortgage.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You offered us fifty dollars more before.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then is not now. You should have accepted my offer when I made  it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We have no idea of selling at that price,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;Our  lowest  price is six hundred and fifty dollars over and above the  mortgage.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Are you crazy?&#8221; ejaculated the squire, angrily. 
  &#8220;No; we have fixed upon that as a fair price,&#8221; said Herbert,  coolly. 
  &#8220;You know you can't get it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then we won't sell.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Young man, I apprehend you do not understand how the matter  stands.  You will have to sell.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why must we?&#8221; 
  &#8220;You can't live on nothing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course not.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You have made a failure in New York.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I made my expenses while I was there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then why didn't you stay?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wanted to do something for mother's support.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You have altogether too high an idea of your own abilities.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope not, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You influence your mother to her harm.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think so, Squire Leech.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But in this case you must yield. You can't expect me to wait for  my  money.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you mean the interest?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course I do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We shall not ask you to wait. I am ready to pay it.&#8221; 
  The squire stared in discomfiture while Herbert drew out the  precise  sum needed to pay the interest. 
  &#8220;Where did you get that money?&#8221; he inquired, chop-fallen. 
  &#8220;Honestly, Squire Leech. Will you give me a receipt?&#8221; 
  The squire did so mechanically. 
  &#8220;I will give you the three hundred and fifty dollars,&#8221; he said;  &#8220;but  you must accept it to-day, or it is withdrawn.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Neither to-day nor any other day will it be accepted, Squire  Leech,&#8221;  said Herbert, firmly. &#8220;If you choose to pay six hundred and  fifty, we  will sell.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You must think I am crazy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, sir; it is a fair offer. If you don't want to buy, we will  make  another offer. We will rent the house for ninety dollars a year.  That  is the interest on fifteen hundred dollars at six per cent. I  believe  a man in your employ wishes to live here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Where do you propose to live?&#8221; asked Squire Leech, in surprise. 
  &#8220;We are going to leave town.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you got a chance to work outside?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; but I have declined to. I am going to school for two  years&#8212;to  an academy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But how are you going to live all this time?&#8221; inquired the squire,  in  amazement. 
  &#8220;I shall live on my income,&#8221; answered Herbert, smiling. 
  &#8220;Income! Have you had a legacy?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;From whom? I thought you only got a trunk of old clothes from your   uncle.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My legacy comes from my father.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But he died poor.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He left behind him an invention, half of which we have sold for an   income of a thousand dollars a year.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A thousand a year!&#8221; ejaculated the squire. 
  &#8220;Yes. I have sold it to the father of Mr. Cameron, who employed me   last summer. You see, there is no occasion for our selling the house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You have been very fortunate,&#8221; said Squire Leech, soberly. &#8220;I   congratulate you both.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Herbert, who privately thought their visitor  looked  excessively annoyed at their good fortune. 
  &#8220;I will see you about the house,&#8221; he said, as he rose to go. 
  &#8220;Well, the squire congratulated us,&#8221; said Herbert, after he went  away;  &#8220;but he didn't look happy when he did so. I shouldn't wonder if  he  accepted our terms, now that he knows we needn't sell.&#8221; 
  Herbert proved to be right. Two days later the squire offered six   hundred dollars over the mortgage for the place, and it was accepted. 
  &#8220;The place is worth more, mother,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but it will relieve us   from care to sell it.&#8221; 
  James was even more annoyed than his father when he heard of  Herbert's  good fortune; but after his first annoyance he showed a  disposition to  be friendly. It is the way of the world. Nothing makes  us sought after  like a little good fortune. James felt that, now  Herbert was in a  position to live without work, he was a gentleman,  and to be treated  accordingly. Herbert received his overtures  politely, but rated them  at their real value. 
  Two years slipped away. 
  Herbert has finished his course at the academy, and is about to  enter  the manufactory as an office clerk. Mr. Cameron means to promote  him  as he merits, and I should not be at all surprised if our young  friend  eventually became junior partner. He and his mother have bought  the  house into which they moved, and have done not a little to convert  it  into a tasteful home. The invention has proved all that Mr. Cameron   hoped for it. It has been widely introduced, and Herbert realizes as   much from his own half as Mr. Cameron agreed to pay for that which he   purchased. So his father's invention has proved to be Herbert Carter's   most valuable legacy. 
  Squire Leech has been unfortunate. Too late he found, that Andrew   Temple had deceived and defrauded him. All his large property, except   a few thousand dollars, has been swept away, and James, disappointed   in his lofty hopes, last week applied to Herbert to use his influence   to obtain him a situation in Mr. Cameron's establishment. There was no   vacancy there, but our hero has found him a place in a dry-goods store   in the same town. Whether he will keep it remains to be seen. Times   have changed since James looked upon Herbert as far beneath him. Now   he is glad to be acknowledged as his companion. If James profits by   his altered circumstances, the loss of his father's property may not   prove so much of a misfortune after all, for wealth is far from being   the greatest earthly good. For our young friend Herbert we may   confidently indulge in cheerful anticipations. He has undergone the   discipline of poverty and privation, and prosperity is not likely to   spoil him. He has done his duty under difficult circumstances, and now   he reaps the reward. 
  THE END
