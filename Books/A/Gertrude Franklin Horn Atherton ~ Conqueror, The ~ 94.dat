The humour and vivacity which had seldom been absent from Hamilton's  face in life withdrew its very impress with his spirit. His features had  something more than the noble repose, the baffling peace, of death; they  looked as if they had been cast long ago with the heads of the Caesars.  Gouverneur Morris, staring at him through blistered eyeballs as he lay  in his coffin, recalled the history of the House of Hamilton, of its  direct and unbroken descent--through the fortunate, and famed, and  crowned of the centuries--from the Great Constantine, from "The  Macedonian," founder of a dynasty of Roman Emperors, and from the first  of the Russian monarchs. Throughout that history great spirits had  appeared from time to time, hewed the foundations of an epoch, and  disappeared. What long-withdrawn creators had met in this exceptionally  begotten brain? Did those great makers of empire, whose very granite  tombs were dust, return to earth when their immortal energies were  invoked to create a soul for a nation in embryo? Morris reviewed the  dead man's almost unhuman gift for inspiring confidence, exerted from  the moment he first showed his boyish face to the multitude; for  triumphing to his many goals as if jagged ramparts had been grass under  his feet. He had been the brain of the American army in his boyhood; he  had conceived an empire in his young twenties; he had poured his genius  into a sickly infant, and set it, a young giant, on its legs, when he  was long under twoscore. Almost all things had come to him by intuition,  for he had lived in advance of much knowledge.    
He communicated these thoughts to Troup, who left the room with him, his  head bent, his arms hanging listlessly. "He might have come in some less  human form," added Morris, bitterly. "This is the worst time of <i>my</i>  life. I am not ashamed to say I've cried my eyes out."    
"I have cried my heart out," said Troup.    
The funeral took place from the house of John Church, in Robinson  Street, near the upper Park. Express messengers had dashed out from New  York the moment Hamilton breathed his last, and every city tolled its  bells as it received the news. People flocked into the streets, weeping  and indignant to the point of fury. Washington's death had been followed  by sadness and grief, but was unaccompanied by anger, and a loud desire  for vengeance. Moreover, Hamilton was still a young man. Few knew of his  feeble health; and that dauntless resourceful figure dwelt in the high  light of the public imagination, ever ready to deliver the young country  in its many times of peril. His death was lamented as a national  calamity.    
On the day of the funeral, New York was black. Every place of business  was closed. The world was in the windows, on the housetops, on the  pavements of the streets through which the cortege was to pass:  Robinson, Beekman, Peal, and Broadway to Trinity Church. Those who were  to walk in the funeral procession waited, the Sixth Regiment, with the  colours and music of the several corps, paraded, in Robinson Street,  until the standard of the Cincinnati, shrouded in crepe, was waved  before the open door of Mr. Church's house. The regiment immediately  halted and rested on its reversed arms, until the bier had been carried  from the house to the centre of the street, when the procession  immediately formed. This was the order of it:--    <blockquote>
 The Military Corps<br>   The Society of the Cincinnati<br>   Clergy of all Denominations<br>   The Body of Hamilton<br>   The General's Horse<br>   The Family<br>   Physicians<br>   The Judges of the Supreme Court (in deep mourning)<br>   Mr. Gouverneur Morris in his carriage<br>   Gentlemen of the Bar and students at law (in deep mourning)<br>   Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of the State<br>   Mayor and Corporation of the City<br>   Members of Congress and Civil Officers of the United States<br>   The Minister, Consuls, and Residents of Foreign Powers<br>   The Officers of the Army and Navy of the United States<br>   Military and Naval Officers of the Foreign Powers<br>   Militia Officers of States<br>   Presidents, Directors, and Officers of the respective Banks<br>   Chamber of Commerce and Merchants<br>   Marine Society, Wardens of the Port, and Masters and Officers   of the Harbour<br>   The President, Professors, and students of Columbia College<br>   The different Societies<br>   The Citizens in general, including the partisans of Burr</blockquote>    
On the coffin were Hamilton's hat and sword. His boots and spurs were  reversed across his horse. The fine gray charger, caparisoned in  mourning, was led by two black servants, dressed in white, their turbans  trimmed with black.    
The military escorted him in single file, with trailing arms, the band  playing "The Dead March in Saul," minute guns from the Artillery in the  Park answered by the British and French warships in the harbour. But for  the solemn music, its still more solemn accompaniment, the tolling of  muffled bells, and the heavy tramp of many feet, there was no sound;  even women of an hysterical habit either controlled themselves or were  too impressed to give way to superficial emotion. When the procession  after its long march reached Trinity Church the military formed in two  columns, extending from the gate to the corners of Wall Street, and the  bier was deposited before the entrance. Morris, surrounded by Hamilton's  boys, stood over it, and delivered the most impassioned address which  had ever leapt from that brilliant but erratic mind. It was brief, both  because he hardly was able to control himself, and because he feared to  incite the people to violence, but it was profoundly moving. "He never  lost sight of your interests!" he reiterated; "I declare to you before  that God in whose presence we are now so especially assembled, that in  his most private and confidential conversations, his sole subject of  discussion was your freedom and happiness. Although he was compelled to  abandon public life, never for a moment did he abandon the public  service. He never lost sight of your interests. For himself he feared  nothing; but he feared that bad men might, by false professions, acquire  your confidence and abuse it to your ruin. He was ambitious only of  glory, but he was deeply solicitous for you."    
The troops formed an extensive hollow square in the churchyard, and  terminated the solemnities with three volleys over the coffin in its  grave. The immense throng, white, still aghast, and unreconciled,  dispersed. The bells tolled until sundown. The city and the people wore  mourning for a month, the bar for six weeks. In due time the leading men  of the parish decided upon the monument which should mark to future  generations the cold and narrow home of him who had been so warm in  life, loving as few men had loved, exulted in the wide greatness of the  empire he had created.    
It bears this inscription:
