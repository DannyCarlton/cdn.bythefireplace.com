    Philip was glad to hear that all in the almshouse went to bed so   early. He had not yet given up the hope of escaping that night,   though he had as yet arranged no definite plan of escape. 
  Meanwhile, he had an active friend outside. I refer, of course, to   Frank Dunbar. Frank had no sooner heard of his friend's captivity   than he instantly determined, if it were a possible thing, to help   him to escape. 
  He would not even wait till the next day, but determined after it   was dark to visit the poor-house and reconnoiter. First, he informed   his parents what had befallen Phil. Their indignation was scarcely   less than his. 
  &quot;Squire Pope is carrying matters with a high hand,&quot; said the  farmer.  &quot;According to my idea, he has done no less than kidnap Philip,   without the shadow of a legal right.&quot; 
  &quot;Can't he be prosecuted?&quot; asked Frank eagerly. 
  &quot;I am not sure as to that,&quot; answered his father, &quot;but I am  confident  that Philip will not be obliged to remain, unless he  chooses, a  dependent upon the charity of the town.&quot; 
  &quot;It is outrageous!&quot; said Mrs. Dunbar, who was quite as friendly to   Philip as her husband and son. 
  &quot;In my opinion,&quot; said Mr. Dunbar, &quot;Squire Pope has done a very   unwise thing as regards his own interests. He desires to remain in   office, and the people will not be likely to reelect him if his   policy is to make paupers of those who wish to maintain themselves.   Voters will be apt to think that they are sufficiently taxed already   for the support of those who are actually unable to maintain   themselves.&quot; 
  &quot;If I were a voter,&quot; exclaimed Frank indignantly, &quot;I wouldn't vote   for Squire Pope, even for dog-catcher! The meanest part of it is the   underhanded way in which he has taken Phil. He must have known he  was  acting illegally, or he would have come here in open day and  required  Phil to go with him.&quot; 
  &quot;I agree with you, Frank. Squire Pope may be assured that he has   lost my vote from henceforth. Hitherto I have voted for him annually   for selectman, knowing that he wanted the office and considering him   fairly faithful.&quot; 
  &quot;Father,&quot; said Frank, after a thoughtful pause, &quot;do you think  Philip  would be justified in escaping from the poorhouse?&quot; 
  &quot;I do,&quot; answered Mr. Dunbar. &quot;In this free country I hold that no   one ought to be made an object of charity against his will.&quot; 
  &quot;Philip is strong enough and smart enough to earn his own living,&quot;   said Frank. 
  &quot;That is true. I will myself give him his board and clothes if he   will stay with me and work on the farm.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish he would. He would be a splendid companion for me; but I   think he wants to leave Norton, and try his fortune in some larger   place.&quot; 
  &quot;I can't blame him. If his father were living and he had a good   home, I should not think it wise; but, as matters stand, it may not   be a bad plan for him.&quot; 
  &quot;Father,&quot; said Frank, after supper, &quot;I am going out and I may not  be  back very early.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you going to see Philip?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; but I want to see him alone. If possible, I will see him   without attracting the attention of Joe Tucker.&quot; 
  &quot;You won't get into any trouble, Frank?&quot; said his mother anxiously. 
  &quot;No, mother; I don't know what trouble I can get into.&quot; 
  &quot;You may very likely fail to see Philip,&quot; suggested his father. &quot;I   hear that Tucker and his boarders go to bed very early.&quot; 
  &quot;So much the better!&quot; said Frank, in a tone of satisfaction. &quot;The   only one I want to see is Philip, and he isn't likely to go to sleep   very early.&quot; 
  Mr. Dunbar smiled to himself. 
  &quot;Frank has got some plan in his head,&quot; he thought. &quot;I won't inquire   what it is, for he has good common sense, and won't do anything   improper.&quot; 
  About eight o'clock, Frank, after certain preparations, which will   hereafter be referred to, set out for the poorhouse, which was about   a mile distant,
