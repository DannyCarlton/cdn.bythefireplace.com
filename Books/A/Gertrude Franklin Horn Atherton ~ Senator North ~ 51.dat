He came in again on Sunday, but Burleigh and other men were there; and  as the Senate had adjourned until the fifth, there was no excuse for  him to call at the late hour when she was sure to be alone; so he  dropped in twice to luncheon, and they went for a long walk in Rock  Creek Park afterward. On one of these occasions Sally Carter joined  them; and on the other, although but for the occasional passer-by they  were alone for two hours in the wild beauty of rocky gorges and winter  woods, they talked of war and Spain. He left her at the door.    
On Thursday night she was to have her dinner, and in spite of her  stormy inner life she felt a pleasurable nervousness as the hour  approached; for on its results depended the colour of her future. With  love or without it she had to live on, and if she could see the way to  serve her country, to preserve some of its higher ideals as well as to  win a distinguished position, she had no doubt that in time she should  find resignation.    
All her invitations but one had been accepted: the British Ambassador  was attending a diplomatic dinner, but would come in later. Betty was  not altogether regretful, for the question of precedence, with all her  personages, was sufficiently complicated. The Speaker ranked the  Senators, but there were eight Senators to be disposed of with tact;  they might overlook a mistake, but their wives or daughters would not.    
She had spared no pains to honour her guests. She still scorned the  plutocratic multiplication of flowers until they seemed to rattle like  the dollars they stood for, but the table looked very beautiful, and  the silver and china and crystal had endured through several  generations. Some of it had been used in the White House in the days  when it was an honour to have a President in one's family. Her  father's wine-cellar had been celebrated, and she had employed  connoisseurs in its replenishment ever since the duties of  entertaining had devolved upon her. She also had her own <i>chef,</i> and  knew with what satisfaction he filled the culinary brain-cells of the  patient diner out in Washington. All the lower house was softly lit  with candles; except her boudoir, which was dark and locked.    
She wore a gown of apple-green satin which looked simple and was not.  Mrs. Madison was like an exquisite miniature, in satin of a pinkish  gray hue, trimmed with much Alencon, a collar of diamonds, and a pink  spray in her soft white hair. Her blue eyes were very bright, and  there was a pink colour in her cheeks, but she looked better than she  felt. She was, indeed, hot and cold by turns, and she held herself  with a majesty of mien which only a tiny woman can accomplish.    
Sally Carter was the first to arrive, and looked remarkably well in  her black velvet of Custom House indignities. The Montgomerys  followed, and Lady Mary wore the azure and white in which she appeared  harmless and undiplomatic. No one was more than ten minutes late, and  at eight o'clock the party was seated about the great round table in  the dining-room.    
Senator North sat on Betty's right, Senator Ward on her left. Next to  that astute diplomatist was the lady in azure and white, whom he  admired profoundly and understood thoroughly. She never knew the  latter half of his attitude, however. He was a gallant American, and  delighted to indulge a pretty woman in her fads and ambitions. Mrs.  Madison achieved resignation between the Speaker of the House and  Senator Maxwell, and Sally Carter was paired with Senator March.    
Betty had meditated several hours over the placing of her guests, and  had invited as many pretty and charming women as the matrimonial  entanglements of her statesmen would permit. Fortunately it was early  in the year, and a number of wives had tarried behind their husbands.  The family portraits on the dark old walls had not looked down upon so  brilliant a gathering for half a century, and Betty's eyes sparkled  and she lifted her head, her nostrils dilating. The light in her inner  life burned low, and her brain was luminous with the excitement of  the hour. And as he was beside her, there really was no cause for  repining.    
At once the talk was all of war. Washington, like the rest of the  country, did not rise to its highest pitch of excitement until after  the destruction of the <i>Maine</i>, but no other subject could hold its  interest for long. In ordinary conditions politics are barely  mentioned when the most political city in the world is in evening  dress, but war is a microbe.    
"I am for it," announced Lady Mary, "if only to give you a chance to  find out whom your friends are."    
"There is nothing in the history of human nature or of nations to  disprove that our friends of to-day may be our enemies of to-morrow,"  observed Senator North.    
"I believe you hate England."    
"On the contrary, I am probably the best friend she has in the Senate.  My mission is to forestall the hate which leads so many ardent but  ill-mated couples into the divorce courts."    
"Well, you will see," said Lady Mary, mysteriously.    
"I do not doubt it," said Senator North, smiling. "And we shall be  grateful. If the circumstances ever are reversed, we shall do as much  for her."    
"How much?"    
"That will depend upon the quality of statesmanship in both Houses."    
"I wish you would explain what you mean by that." Lady Mary's wide  voice was too well trained to sharpen. Her cold blue eyes wore the  dreamy expression of their most active moments.    
"I wish I knew whether the statesmen of the future were to be  Populists or Republicans."    
"Well, whatever you mean you have no sentiment."    
"I have no sentimentalism."    
Lady Mary shrugged her shoulders and turned to Senator Ward. She knew  better than to talk politics to him before dinner was two thirds over,  but she bent her pretty head to him, and gave him her distinguished  attentions while he re-invigorated his weary brain. He smiled  encouragingly.    
"The statesmen of the future will be Populists, Senator," announced  Betty's last recruit, a man with a keen sharply cut face and a  slightly nasal though not displeasing voice. He was forty and looked  thirty.    
"The Populist will have called himself so many things by that time  that 'statesman' will do as well as any other," growled the Speaker.  "'The Statesmen's Party' would sound well, and would be worthy of the  noble pretensions of your leader."    
"Well, they are noble," said Armstrong tartly, but glad of the  opportunity to talk back to the personage who treated him in the House  as a Czar treats a minion. "We are the only party that is ready to  cling to the Constitution as if it were the rock of ages."    
"Well, you've clung so hard you've turned it upside down, and the new  inventions and patent improvements you've stuccoed it with will do for  the 'Statesmen's Party,' but not for the United States--Madam?"    
Mrs. Madison had touched his arm timidly, and asked him if he liked  terrapin. Her colour was deeper, but she exerted herself to keep the  attention of this huge personality whom a poor worm might be tempted  to assassinate.    
Senator Burleigh's voice rose above the chatter. "Who would be a  Western Senator?" he said plaintively. "My colleague and I received a  document today, signed by two thousand of our constituents, the entire  population of an obscure but determined town, in which we were ordered  to acknowledge the belligerency of the Cubans at once or expect to be  tarred and feathered upon our return. The climate of my State is  excellent for consumption, but bad for nerves. Doubtless most of these  men come of good New England stock, whose relatives 'back East' would  never think of doing such a thing; but the intoxicating climate they  have been inhaling for half a generation, to say nothing of the raw  conditions, makes them want to fight creation."    
Senator Maxwell, who had more of the restlessness of youth than the  repose of age, threw back his silver head and gave his little  irritated laugh. "That is it," he said. "It is the lust of blood that  possesses the United States. They don't know it. They call it  sympathy; but their blood is aching for a fight, so that they can read  the exciting horrors of it in the newspapers. You might as well reason  with mad dogs."    
"I shall not attempt to reason with my kennel," said Burleigh. "In the  present congested state of the mails this particular memorial has gone  astray."    
"The trials of a Senator!" cried Sally Carter. "Petitions and  lobbyists, election clouds, fractious and dishonest legislatures,  unprincipled bosses and the country gone mad!"    
"I can give you a list as long as my arm," said Senator March, grimly;  "and you may believe it or not, but it is all I can do to walk in my  Committee-room and I haven't a chair to sit on. I live under a snow-  storm of petitions, memorials, and resolutions. I expect to see them  come flying through the window, and I dream of nothing else."    
Betty had taken part in the general conversation until the last few  moments, but as it concentrated on the subject of Cuban autonomy and  her guests ceased to appeal to her, she fell into conversation with  Senator North, who she knew would be willing to dispense with politics  for a few moments.    
"You have no idea how I miss Jack Emory," she said. "He half lived  with us, you know, and I am always expecting to meet him in the hall.  When I was writing my invitations I caught myself beginning a note,  'Dear Jack.' It is uncanny."    
"It is the only revenge the dead have; and doubtless it is this vivid  after life of theirs in memory that is at the root of the belief in  ghosts. You say that you are going to open your <i>salon</i> every year  with a dinner to the original members. It will be interesting to watch  the two faces in some of the seats--if you attempt to fill the vacant  chairs."    
Betty pressed her handkerchief against her lips, for she knew they had  turned white. She was but twenty-eight, and if her <i>salon</i> was the  success it promised to be she would sit at the head of this table  for twenty-eight years to come, and then have compassed fewer years  than the man beside her. She had refused resolutely to permit her  thought to dwell on the tragic difference in their ages, a difference  that had no meaning now, but would symbolize death and desolation  hereafter; but her mind had moments of abrupt insight that no Will  could conquer, and not long since she had gasped and covered her face  with her hands.    
"That was brutal of me," he said hurriedly. "Your dinner is the  brilliant success that it deserves to be, and you should be permitted  to be entirely happy. There is not a bored face, and if they are all  jabbering about the everlasting subject, so much the better for you.  It gives your <i>salon</i> its political character at once; you would have  had a hard time getting them to begin on bimetallism and the census--  perish the thought! Ward is now making Lady Mary think that she is a  greater diplomatist than himself. Maxwell and the Speaker are  wrangling across your mother, who looks alarmed; Burleigh is flirting  desperately with Miss Alice Maxwell, who is purring upon his  senatorial vanity; your Populist is breaking out into the turgid  rhetoric of Mr. Bryan; French has persuaded that charming English girl  that he is the most literary man in America, and Miss Carter is  condoling with March about an ungrateful State. So be happy, my  darling, be happy."    
His voice had dropped suddenly. She made an involuntary movement  toward him.    
"I am," she said below her breath. "I am." She added in a moment,  "Will you always come to my Thursday evenings, no matter what  happens?"    
"Always."    
He had turned slightly, and one hand was on his knee. She slipped hers  into it recklessly; they were safe in the crowd, and her hand ached  for his. It ached from the grasp it received, for he was a man whose  self-control was absolute or non-existent. But she clung to him as  long as she dared, and when she withdrew her hand she sought for  distraction in her company.    
It looked as gay and happy as if war had been invented to animate  conversation and make a bored people feel dramatic. Death was close  upon the heels of two of the distinguished men present; but even  though the eyes of the soul be raised everlastingly to the world  above, they are blind to the portal. The busy member who had incurred  Miss Carter's disapproval and the brilliant Librarian of Congress were  among the liveliest at the feast.    
It was Senator Ward at one end of the table and Burleigh at the other,  who finally started the topic of Miss Madison's intended <i>salon</i>, not  only that those unacquainted with her ambition might be enlightened,  but that the great intention should receive a concrete form without  further delay. A half-hour later, when the women left the table, Betty  had the satisfaction of knowing that whatever the final result of her  venture, her stand was as fully recognized as if she had written a  book and found a publisher and critics to advertise her.
