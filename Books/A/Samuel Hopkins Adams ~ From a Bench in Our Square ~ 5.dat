<b>I</b>    
Mayme Mccartney was a bad little good girl. She inspired (I trust)  esteem for her goodness. But it was for her hardy and happy impudence,  her bent for ingenious mischief, her broad and catholic disrespect for  law, conventions, proprieties and persons, and the glint of the devil in  her black eyes that we really loved her. Such is the perversity of human  nature in Our Square. I am told that it is much the same elsewhere.    
She first came into public notice by giving (unsolicited) a most  scandalous and spirited imitation of old Madame Tallafferr, aforetime of  the Southern aristocracy, in the act of rebuking her landlord, the  insecticidal Boggs ("Boggs Kills Bugs" in his patent of nobility), for  eating peanuts on his own front steps. She then (earnestly solicited by  a growing audience) put on impromptu sketches of the Little Red Doctor  diagnosing internal complications in a doodle-bug; of MacLachan (drunk)  singing "The Cork Leg" and MacLachan (sober) repenting thereof; of  Bartholomew Storrs offering samples of his mortuary poesy to a bereaved  second-cousin; and, having decked out her chin in cotton-batten whiskers  (limb of Satan!), of myself proffering sage counsel and pious  admonitions to Our Square at large. Having concluded, she sat down on a  bench and coughed. And the Little Red Doctor, who, from the shelter of a  shrub had observed her presentation of his little idiosyncrasies, drew  nearer and looked at her hard. For he disliked the sound of that cough.  He suspected that his old friend and opponent, Death, with whom he  fought an interminable campaign, was mocking him from ambush. It wasn't  quite fair play, either, for the foe to use the particular weapon  indicated by the cough on a mere child. With her lustrous hair loose and  floating, and her small, eager, flushed face, she looked far short of  the mature and self-reliant seventeen which was the tally of her  experienced years.    
"Hello," greeted the Little Red Doctor, speaking with the brusque  informality of one assured of his place as a local celebrity. "I don't  know you, do I?"    
Mayme lifted her eyes. "If you don't," she drawled, "it ain't for lack  of tryin'. Is your hat glued on?"    
"Good Lord!" exclaimed the Little Red Doctor indignantly. "Do you think  I'm trying to flirt with you? Why, you're only a kid."    
"Get up to date," advised Mayme. "I'm old enough to be your steady.  Only, I'm too lucky."    
"That's a bad cough you've got," said the Little Red Doctor hastily.    
"I've got a better one at home. Like to hear it some day?"    
"Bring it over to my office and let's look at the thing," suggested the  Little Red Doctor, smiling.    
As Mayme McCartney observed that smile with the shrewd judgment of men  which comes early, in self-protection, to girls of her environment, the  suspicion and impudence died out of her face, which became wistful.    
"D'you think it means anything?" she asked.    
"Any cough means something. I couldn't tell without examination."    
"How much?" inquired the cautious Mayme.    
The Little Red Doctor is a willing liar in a good cause. "No charge for  first consultation. Come over to my office."    
When the test was finished, the Little Red Doctor looked professionally  non-committal. "Live with your parents?" he asked.    
"No. With my aunt. 'Round in the Avenue."    
"Where do you work?"    
"The Emporium," answered the girl, naming the great and still  fashionable downtown department store, half a mile to the westward.    
"You ought to quit. As soon as possible."    
"And spoil my delicate digestion?"    
"Who said anything about your digestion?"    
"I did. If I quit workin', I quit eatin'. And that's bad for me. I tried  it once."    
"I see," said the Little Red Doctor, recognizing a condition by no means  unprecedented in local practice. "Couldn't you get a job in some  better climate?"    
"Where, for instance?"    
"Well, if you knew any one in California."    
"How's the walkin'?" asked Mayme.    
"It's long," replied the Little Red Doctor, "seeing" again. "Anyway,  you've got to have fresh air."    
"They serve it fresh, every morning, right here in Our Square," Mayme  pointed out.    
"Good idea. Get up early and fill your lungs full of it for an hour  every day." He gave some further instructions.    
Mayme produced a dollar, and delicately placed it on the mantel.    
"Take it away," said the Little Red Doctor. "Didn't I tell you--"    
"Go-wan!" said Mayme. "Whadda you think you are; Bellevue Hospital? I  pay as I go, Doc."    
The Little Red Doctor frowned austerely.    
"What's the matter? Face hurt you?" asked the solicitous Mayme.    
"People don't call me 'Doc,'" began the offended practitioner in  dignified tones.    
"Oh, that's because they ain't on to you," she assured him. "I wouldn't  call you 'Doc' myself if I didn't know you was a good sport back of  your bluff."    
The Little Red Doctor grinned, looking first at Mayme and then at the  dollar. "You aren't such a bad sport yourself," he admitted. "Well,  we'll call this a deal. But if I see you in the Square and give you a  tip about yourself now and again, that doesn't count. That's on the  side. Understand?"    
She considered it gravely. "All right," she agreed at length. "Between  pals, yes? Shake, Doc."    
So began the quaint friendship between our hard-worked, bluff,  knightly-hearted practitioner, and the impish and lovable little  store-girl. Also another of the innumerable tilts between him and his  old friend, Death.    
"He's got the jump on me, Dominie," complained the Little Red Doctor to  me. "But, at that, we're going to give him a fight. She's clear grit,  that youngster is. She's got a philosophy of life, too. I don't know  where she got it, or just what it is, but it's there. Oh, she's worth  saving, Dominie."    
"If I hadn't reason to think you safeguarded, my young friend," said I,  "I'd give you solemn warning."    
"Why, she's an infant!" returned the Little Red Doctor scornfully. "A  poor, little, monkey-faced child. Besides--" He stopped and sighed.    
"Yes; I know," I assented. There was at that time a "Besides" in the  Little Red Doctor's sorrowful heart which bulked too large to admit of  any rivalry. "Nevertheless," I added, "you needn't be so scornful about  the simian type in woman. It's a concentrated peril to mankind. I've  seen trouble caused in this world by kitten faces, by pure, classic  faces, by ox-eyed-Juno faces, by vivid blond faces, by dreamy, poetic  faces, by passionate Southern faces, but for real power of catastrophe,  for earthquake and eclipse, for red ruin and the breaking up of laws,  commend me to the humanized, feminized monkey face. I'll wager that when  Antony first set eyes on Cleopatra, he said, 'And which cocoa palm did  she fall out of?' Phryne was of the beautified baboon cast of features,  and as for Helen of Troy, the best authorities now lean to the belief  that the face that launched a thousand ships and fired the topless  towers of Ilium was a reversion to the arboreal. I tell you, man that is  born of woman cannot resist it. Give little Mayme three more years--"    
"I wish to God I could," said the Little Red Doctor.    
"Can't you?" I asked, startled. "Is it as bad as that?"    
"It isn't much better. How's your insomnia, Dominie?"    
"Insomnia," said I, "is a scientific quibble for unlaid memories. I take  mine out for the early morning air at times, if that's what you mean."    
"It is. Keep an eye on the kid, and do what you can to prevent that busy  little mind of hers from brooding."    
In that way Mayme McCartney and I became early morning friends. She  adopted for her special own a bench some rods from mine under the lilac  near the fountain. After her walk, taken with her thin shoulders flung  back and the chest filling with deep, slow breaths, she would pay me a  call or await one from me and we would exchange theories and opinions  and argue about this and other worlds. Seventy against seventeen. Fair  exchange, for, if mine were the riper creed, hers was the more vivid and  adventurous. Who shall say which was the sounder?    
On the morning of the astonishing Trespass, I was late, being  discouraged by a light rain. As she approached her bench, she found it  occupied by an individual who appeared to be playing a contributory part  in the general lamentation of nature. The interloper was young and quite  exquisite of raiment, which alone would have marked him for an  outlander. His elbows were propped on his knees, his fists supported his  cheekbones, his whole figure was in a slump of misery. Scrutinizing him  with surprise, Mayme was shocked to see a glistening drop, detached from  his drooping countenance, fall to the pavement, followed by another. At  the same time she heard an unmistakable and melancholic sound.    
The benches in Our Square have seen more life than most. They have  cradled weariness of body and spirit; they have assuaged grief and given  refuge to shaking terror, and been visited by Death. They have shivered  to the passion of cursing men and weeping women. But never before had  any of their ilk heard grown young manhood blubber. Neither had Mayme  McCartney. It inspired her with mingled emotions, the most immediate of  which was a desire to laugh.    
Accordingly she laughed. The intruder lifted a woeful face, gave her one  vague look, and reverted to his former posture. Mayme stopped laughing.  She advanced and put a friendly hand on one of the humped shoulders.    
"Cheer up, Buddy," she said. "It ain't as bad as you think it is."    
"It's worse," gulped a choky voice. Then the head lifted again. "Who are  you?" it demanded.    
"I'm your big sister," said Mayme reassuringly. "Tell a feller about  it."    
The response was neither polite nor explanatory. "D---n sisters!" said  the bencher.    
"Oh, tutt-<i>tutt</i> and naughty-naughty!" rebuked Mayme. "Somebody's sister  been puttin' somethin' over on poor little Willy?"    
"My own sister has." He was in that state of semi-hysterical exhaustion  in which revelation of one's intimate troubles to the first comer seems  natural. "She's gone and got arrested," he wailed.    
Mayme's face became grave and practical.    
"That's different," said she. "What's her lay?"    
"Lay? I don't know--"    
"What's her line? What's she done to get pinched?"    
"Shoplifting. At the special night sale of the Emporium."    
"You're tellin' me! In the silks, huh?"    
"What do you know about it? My God! Is it in the papers already?"    
"Keep your hair on, Buddy. I work there, and I heard about that pinch.  Swell young married lady. Say," she added, after a thoughtful pause:  "has she got somethin' comin'?"    
"Something coming? How? What?"    
"Don't be dumb. A kid."    
He stared. She was looking at him with unabashed frankness. Those who  live in the close, rough intimacy of the slums do not cherish false  shame about the major facts of life.    
"Suppose she has?" queried the youth sulkily.    
"Why, that'll be all right, you poor boob," returned the kindly Mayme.  "The judge'll let her off with a warning."    
"How do you know?"    
"They always do. Those cases are common. Dolan ought to be canned for  makin' a pinch of a lady in the fam'ly way."    
"What if they do let her off?" lamented the youth. "It'll be in all the  papers and I'll be ruined. My life's spoiled. I might as well leave  the city."    
"Ah, don't do a mean trick like that to the old town!" besought the  sardonic Mayme. "Where do you come in to get hurt?"    
He burst into the hectic grievances of the pampered and spoiled child.  His family was just getting a foothold in Society (with an almost holy  emphasis on the word) and now they were disgraced. All was up. Their  new, precariously held acquaintances would drop them. In his petulant  grief he did an amazing thing; he produced a bunch of clippings from the  local society columns, setting forth, in the printed company of the  Shining Ones, the doings (mostly charitable) of Mrs. Samuel Berthelin,  her daughter, Mrs. Harris, and her son, David, referred to glowingly as  "the scion of the wealth and position of the late lamented financier."    
Mayme was impressed. Like most shop-girls she was a fervent reader of  society news. (If shop-girls did not read this fine flower of American  democracy, nobody would, except those who wait eagerly and anxiously for  their names to appear.) She perceived--not knowing that the advertising  leverage of the Berthelin Loan Agency had forced those insecure portals  of print for the entry of Mrs. Berthelin and her progeny--that she was  in the presence of the Great. Capacity for awe was not in Mayme's  independent soul. But she was interested and sympathetic. Here was a  career worth saving!    
"Let's go over to the station-house," said she. "I know some of the  cops."    
To the white building with the green lanterns they went. The shoplifting  case, it appeared, had already been bailed out. Furthermore, everything  would be all right and there was little fear of publicity; the store  itself would see to that. Vastly relieved and refreshed in spirit, David  Berthelin began to take stock of his companion with growing interest.  She was decidedly not pretty. Just as decidedly she was quaint and  piquant and quite new to his jejune but also somewhat bored experience.  From the opening passage of their first conversation he deduced, lacking  the insight to discriminate between honest frankness and immodesty, that  she was a "fly kid." On that theory he invited her to breakfast with  him. Mayme accepted. They went to Thomson's Elite Restaurant, on the  corner, where David roused mingled awe and misgivings in the breast of  Polyglot Elsa, the cashier, by ordering champagne, and Mayme reassured  her by declining it.    
Thus began an acquaintanceship which swiftly ripened into a queer sort  of intimacy, more than a little disturbing to us of Our Square who were  interested in Mayme. Young Berthelin's over-ornate roadster lingered in  our quiet precincts more often than appeared to us suitable or safe, and  black-eyed Mayme, looking demure and a little exalted, was whirled away  to unknown worlds, always returning, however, at respectable hours. When  the Little Red Doctor remonstrated with her ostensibly on the score of  her health, she reminded him in one breath that he hadn't been invited  to censor her behavior which was entirely her own affair, and in the  next--with his hand caught between hers and her voice low and  caressing--declared that he was the best little old Doc in the world and  there was nothing to worry about, either as to health or conduct.  Indeed, her condition seemed to be improving. I dare say young Mr.  Berthelin's expensive food was one of the things she needed.  Furthermore, she ceased to be the raggle-taggle, hoydenishly clad Mayme  of the cash department, and, having been promoted to saleswoman, quite  went in for dress. On this point she sought the advice of the Bonnie  Lassie. The result went far to justify my prophecy that Mayme's queer  little face might yet make its share of trouble in an impressionable  world. But the Bonnie Lassie shook her bonnie head privately and said  that the fine-feathers development was a bad sign, and that if young  Berthelin would obligingly run his seventeen-jeweled roadster off the  Williamsburgh Bridge, with himself in it, much trouble might be saved  for all concerned.    
If little Mayme were headed for trouble, she went to meet it with a  smiling face. Never had she seemed so joyous, so filled with the desire  of life. This much was to be counted on the credit side, the Little Red  Doctor said. On the debit side--well, to me was deputed the unwelcome  task of conveying the solemn, and, as it were, official protest and  warning of Our Square. Of course I did it at the worst possible moment.  It was early one morning, when Mayme, on her bench, was looking a little  hollow-eyed and disillusioned. I essayed the light and jocular approach  to the subject:    
"Well, Mayme; how is the ardent swain?"    
She turned to me with the old flash in her big, shadowed eyes: "Did you  say swain or swine, Dominie?"    
"Ah!" said I. "Has he changed his role?"    
"He's given himself away, if that's what you mean."    
"I thought that would come."    
"He--he wanted me to take a trip to Boston with him."    
I considered this bit of information, which was not as surprising or  unexpected as Mayme appeared to deem it. "Have you told the Little  Red Doctor?"    
"Doc'd kill him," said Mayme simply.    
"What better reason for telling?"    
"Oh, the poor kid: he don't know any better."    
"Doesn't he? In any case I trust that you know better, after this, than  to have anything more to do with him."    
"Yep. I've cut him out," replied Mayme listlessly. "I figured you and  Doc were right, Dominie. It's no good, his kind of game. Not for girls  like me." She looked up at me with limpid eyes, in which there was  courage and determination and suffering.    
"My dear," I murmured, "I hope it isn't going to be too hard."    
"He's so pretty," said Mayme McCartney wistfully.    
So he was, now that I came to think of it. With his clear, dark color,  his wavy hair, his languishing brown eyes, his almost girlishly graceful  figure, and his beautiful clothes, he was pretty enough to fascinate any  inexperienced imagination. But I cannot say that he looked pretty when,  a few days later, he invaded Our Square in search of a Mayme who had  vanished beyond his ken (she had kept her tenement domicile a secret  from him), and, addressing me as "you white-whiskered old goat," accused  me of having come between him and the girl upon whom he had deigned to  bestow his lordly favor. Unfortunately for him, the Little Red Doctor  chanced along just then and inquired, none too deferentially, what the  Scion of Wealth and Position was doing in that quarter.    
"What business is it of yours, Red-Head?" countered the offended  visitor.    
He then listened with distaste, but perforce (for what else could he do  in the grasp of a man of twice his power?), to a brilliant and  convincing summary of his character, terminating in a withering sketch  of his personal and sartorial appearance.    
"I didn't mean the kid any harm," argued the Scion suavely. "I--I came  back to apologize."    
"Let me catch you snooping around here again and I'll break every bone  in your body," the Little Red Doctor answered him.    
"I guess this Square's free to everybody. I guess you don't own it,"  said the youth, retreating to his car.    
Notwithstanding the unimpeachable exactitude of this surmise, he was  seen no more in that locality. Judge, then, of our dismay, locally, at  learning, not a fortnight later, from a fellow employee of Mayme's, that  she had been met at closing time by a swell young guy in a  cherry-colored rattler, who took her away to dine with him. Catechized  upon the point, later on, by a self-appointed committee of two  consisting of the Little Red Doctor and myself, Mayme said vaguely that  it was all right; we didn't understand. This is, I believe, the usual  formula. The last half of it at least, was true.    
About that time we, in common with the rest of the Nation, took that  upon our minds which was even more important than Mayme McCartney's love  affair. War loomed imminently before us. It was only a question of the  fitting time to strike; and Our Square was feverishly reckoning up its  military capacity. The great day of the declaration came. The Nation had  drawn the sword. In the week following, Our Square was invaded.    
She descended upon us from the somber sumptuousness of a gigantic  limousine, the majestic, the imposing, the formidable, the authoritative  Mrs. S. Berthelin. We knew at once who she was, because she led, by the  ear, as it were, her hopeful progeny, young David. I do not mean that  she had an actual auricular grip on him, but the effect upon his  woe-begone and brow-beaten person was the same. He suggested vividly a  spoiled and pretty lapdog being sternly conveyed to a detested bath. She  suggested a vivified bouquet of artificial flowers. We hastily rallied  our forces to meet her; the Little Red Doctor, the Bonnie Lassie, and  myself. Mrs. Berthelin opened her exordium in a tone of high philippic,  not even awaiting the formalities of introduction. But when I insisted  upon these, and she learned that the Bonnie Lassie was Mrs. Cyrus  Staten, she cringed. Despite a desire to keep out of the society columns  quite as genuine as that of Mrs. Berthelin's to get in, the Cyrus  Statens frequently figure among the Shining Ones, a fact almost  painfully appreciated by our visitor. After that it was easy to get her  into the Bonnie Lassie's house, where her eloquence could not draw a  crowd. To get young David there was not quite so easy. He made one  well-timed and almost successful effort to bolt, and even evinced signs  of balking on the steps.    
His punishment was awaiting him. No sooner were we all settled in the  Bonnie Lassie's studio than the mother proceeded to regale us with a  history and forecast of his career, beginning with his precocious infant  lispings and terminating with his projected, though wholly indefinite,  marriage into the Highest Social Circles. To do David justice,  he squirmed.    
"Have you got him a job as a general in the army yet, ma'am?" inquired  the Little Red Doctor suavely.    
It was quite lost upon Mrs. Berthelin. She informed us that a commission  as Captain in the Quartermaster's Department was arranged for, and she  expected to have the young officer assigned to New York so that he could  live at home in the comfort and luxury suitable to his wealth and  condition. And what she wanted us to understand clearly was that no  designing little gutter-snipe was to be allowed to compromise David's  future. She concluded with an imaginative and most unflattering estimate  of Mayme McCartney's character, manners, and morals, in the midst of  which I heard a gasp.    
It came from Mayme, standing, wide-eyed and white, in the doorway. The  front door had been left ajar, and, seeing the Berthelins' monogrammed  car outside, she had come in. The oratress turned and stared.    
"That's a lie," said Mayme McCartney steadily. "I'm as straight a girl  as your own daughter. Ask him."    
She pointed to the stricken David. Pointing may not be ladylike, but it  can be extremely effective. David's head dropped into his hands.    
"Oh, Ma!" he groaned.    
"Don't call me 'Ma,'" snapped the goaded Mrs. Berthelin. "And this is  the girl?" She looked Mayme up and down. Mayme did the same by her and  did it better.    
"I could give you a lorny-yette and beat you at the frozen-stare trick,"  said the irrepressible Mayme at the conclusion of the duel which ended  in her favor.    
The Little Red Doctor gurgled. I saw the Bonnie Lassie's eyelids quiver,  but her face was cold and impassive as she turned to the visitor.    
"Mrs. Berthelin," said she, "you have made some very damaging  statements, before witnesses, about Miss McCartney's character. What  proof have you?"    
"Why, he wants to <i>marry</i> her!" almost yelled the mother. "She's trapped  him."    
"That's another lie," said Mayme.    
"He told me himself that he was going to marry you."    
"Did he? Then he's wrong. I wouldn't marry him with a brass ring,"  asserted Mayme.    
"You wouldn't mar--You wouldn't <i>what</i>?" demanded the mother, outraged  and incredulous.    
"You heard me. He knows it, too. I don't like the family--what I've seen  of them," observed Mayme judicially. "Besides, he's yellow."    
David's shamed face emerged into view. "I'm not," he gulped. "She--she  made me."    
"Captain!" said Mayme with a searing scorn in her voice.  "Quartermaster's Department! Safety first! When half the little  fifteen-per tape-snippers in the Emporium are breakin' their  fourteen-inch necks volunteerin' early and often to get where the  fightin' is."    
David Berthelin stood on his feet, and his pretty face wore an ugly  expression.    
"Let me out of here," he growled.    
"David!" said his mother. "Where are you going?"    
"To enlist."    
"Davey!" It was a shriek. "You shan't."    
"I will."    
"I won't let you."    
"You can go to--"    
"Buddy!" Mayme's voice, magically softened, broke in. "Cut out the rough  stuff. You better go home and think it over. Bein' a private is no  pink-silk picnic."    
"I'd rather see a son of mine dead than a common soldier!" cried Mrs.  Berthelin.    
The Bonnie Lassie, very white, rose. "You must leave this house," she  said. "At once. Think yourself fortunate that I cannot bring myself to  betray a guest. Otherwise I should report you to the authorities."    
Young David addressed Mayme in the words and tone of a misunderstood and  aggrieved pet. "You think I'm no good. I'll show you, Mayme. Wait till I  come back--if I ever do come back--and you'll be sorry."    
"Hero stuff," commented the Little Red Doctor. "It'll all have oozed out  of his fingertips this time to-morrow."    
"Will you show me a place to enlist?" challenged the boy. "And," he  added with a malicious grin, "will you enlist with me?"    
"Sure!" said the Little Red Doctor. "I'll show you. But they won't take  me." He bestowed a bitter glance on his twisted foot. "Come along."    
They went off together, while Mrs. Berthelin scandalized Our Square by  an exhibition of hysterics involving language not at all in accord with  the rich respectability of her apparel and her limousine.    
We waited at the Bonnie Lassie's for the Little Red Doctor's return. He  came back alone. I thought that I detected a pathetic little gleam of  disappointment in Mayme's deep eyes.    
"He's done it," said the Little Red Doctor. And I was sorry for him, so  much was there of tragic envy in his face.    
"Did you give him your blessing?" I asked.    
"I did. He shook hands like a man. There's maybe something in that boy,  if it weren't for the old hell-cat of a mother. However, she won't have  much chance. He's off to-morrow."    
"Will he write?" said Mayme in a curious, strained voice.    
"He will. He'll report to me from time to time."    
"Didn't he--wasn't there any message?"    
"Just good-bye and good luck," answered the Little Red Doctor, censoring  ruthlessly.    
The Bonnie Lassie went over and put her arms around Mayme McCartney.    
"My dear," she said softly. "It wouldn't do. It really wouldn't. He  isn't worth it. You're going to forget him."    
"All right." Suddenly Mayme looked like a very helpless and sorrowful  little girl. "Only, it--it isn't goin' to be as easy as you think. He  was so pretty," said Mayme McCartney wistfully.    
<b>II</b>    
Summer was smiting Our Square with white-hot bolts of sun-fire, from  which one could scarcely find refuge beneath the scraggly shelter of  parched shrubbery, when one morning the Bonnie Lassie approached my  bench with a fell and purposeful smile.    
"Dominie, you're a dear old thing," she began in her most insinuating  tones.    
"I won't do it," I said determinedly, foreboding something serious.    
The Bonnie Lassie raised her eyebrows at me, affecting aggrieved  innocence. "Won't do what?" she inquired.    
"Whatever it is that you're trying to wheedle me into."    
The eyebrows resumed their normal arch, and a dimple flickered in the  corner of the soft lips. By this I knew that the case was hopeless. "Oh,  but you've already done it," she said.    
"Help! Tell me the worst and get it over with."    
"It must be lovely to be rich," said the Bonnie Lassie meditatively.  "And so generous!"    
"How much is it? What do you want it for? I haven't got that much," I  hastily remarked.    
"And to keep it an absolute secret from everybody. Even from Mayme  herself."    
"Go on. Don't mind me," I murmured.    
"The Little Red Doctor has found the place. It's in New Mexico. And in  the fall she's going on to the Coast. He's almost willing to guarantee  that a year of it will make her as strong as ever. And the hundred  dollars a month you allow her besides her traveling expenses will be  plenty. You <i>are</i> a good old thing, Dominie!"    
"What you mean is that I'm an old good-thing. How shall I look," I  demanded bitterly, "when Mayme comes to thank me?"    
"No foolisher than you do now, trying to raise unreasonable objections  to our perfectly good plans," retorted the Bonnie Lassie. "Besides, she  won't. She knows that your way is to do good by stealth and blush to  find it fame, and she's under pledge to pretend to know nothing  about it."    
"Where did the Little Red Doctor raise it?" I queried.    
"There are times, Dominie, when your mind has real penetrative power.  Think it over."    
"The Weeping Scion of Wealth and Position!" I cried. "Did our medical  friend blackmail him?"    
"Not necessarily. He only dropped a hint that Mayme's chance here was  rather poorer than a soldier's going to war, unless something could be  done and the Weeping Scion fairly begged to be allowed to do it. 'Do you  think she'd take it from you?' said the Little Red Doctor, 'after what  your mother called her?' 'Don't let her know,' says our ornamental young  weeper. 'Tell her somebody else is doing it. Tell her it's from that  white-whiskered old--from the elderly and handsome gentleman with the  benevolent expres--'"    
"Yes: I know," I broke in. "Very good. I'm the goat. Lying, hypocrisy,  false pretense, fake charity; it's all one to a sin-seared old reprobate  like me. After it's over I'll go around the corner and steal what  pennies I can find in Blind Simon's cup, just to make me feel  comparatively respectable and decent again."    
It was no easier than I expected it to be, especially when little Mayme,  having come to say good-bye, put her lips close to my ear and tried to  whisper something, and cried and kissed me instead.    
Our Square was a dimmer and duller place after she left. But her letters  helped. They were so exactly like herself! Even at the first, when  things seemed to be going ill with her, they were all courage, and  quaint humor and determination to get well and come back to Our Square,  which was the dearest and best place in the world with the dearest and  best people in it. Homesickness! Poor little, lonely Mayme. She was  reading--she wrote the Bonnie Lassie--all the books that the Dominie had  listed for her, and she was being tutored by a school-teacher with blue  goggles and a weak heart who lived at the same resort. "Why grow up a  Boob," wrote the philosophic Mayme, "when the lil old world is full of  wise guys just aking to spill their wiseness?"    
Contemporaneously the Weeping Scion of Wealth was writing back his views  on life and the emptiness thereof, in better orthography, but with  distinctly less of spirit.    
"It appears," reported the Little Red Doctor, "that every man in his own  company has licked our young friend and now the other companies of the  regiment are beginning to show interest, and he doesn't like it. I  believe he'd desert if it weren't that he's afraid of what Mayme  would think."    
"Still on his mind, is she?" I asked.    
The Little Red Doctor produced a letter with a camp postmark from the  South and read a passage:    
"You were right when you guessed that I never wanted anything very much  before, without having it handed to me. Perhaps you are right about its  being good for me. But it comes hard. The promise goes, of course. I'm  going to show you and her that I'm not yellow. [So that was still  rankling; salutary, if bitter dose!] But if this war ever finishes, all  bets are off and I'm coming back to find her. And don't you forget your  part of the bargain, to write and let me know how she is getting on."  The Little Red Doctor was able to send progressively encouraging news.  When the cold weather came, Mayme moved westward to Southern California,  and found herself on the edge of one of the strange, tumultuous,  semi-insane moving-picture colonies of that region. Thence issued,  presently, stirring tidings.    
"What do you think?" wrote our exile. "They've got my funny little  monkey mug in the movies. Five per and steady work. The director likes  me and says he will give me a real chance one of these days. But, as the  Dominie would say, this is a hell of a place. [Graceless imp!] I would  not say it myself, because I am a perfect lady. You have to be, out  here. That reminds me: I have cut out the Mayme. Every fresh little  frizzle in the colony with a false front and a pneumatic figure calls  herself Mayme or Daisye or Tootsye. Not for me! I am keeping up my  lessons and trying to make my head good for something besides carrying a  switch. Tell the Little Red Doctor that it is so long since I coughed I  have forgotten how. And I love you all so hard that it <i>hurts</i>.    
"Your loving    
"MARY MCCARTNEY    
"P.S. I am going to be Marie Courtenay when I get my name up in the  pictures. Put that in the Directory and see how it looks.    
"P.S.2. How is my soldier boy getting along? Poor kid! I expect he is  finding it a lot different from Broadway with money in your pocket."    
About this time the Weeping Scion was finding things very different,  indeed, from Broadway, having been shifted to a specially wet and muddy  section of France; and was taking them as he found them. That is to say,  he had learned the prime lesson of war.    
"And he's been made corporal," announced the Little Red Doctor with  satisfaction.    
"That sounds encouraging," remarked the Bonnie Lassie. "How did it  happen?"    
"He went over on one of the 'flu ships,' and when the epidemic began to  mow 'em down there was a kind of panic. From what I can make out, the  Scion kept his head and his nerve, and made good. A corporal's stripes  aren't much, but they're something."    
Better was to come. There was high triumph in the Little Red Doctor's  expression when he came to my bench with the glad tidings of young  David's promotion to a sergeantcy.    
"While it's very gratifying," I remarked, "it doesn't seem to me an  epoch-making event."    
"Doesn't it!" retorted my friend. "That's because of your abysmal  military ignorance, Dominie. Let me tell you how it is in our army. A  fellow can get himself made a captain by pull, or a major by luck, or a  colonel by desk-work, or a general by having a fine martial figure, but  to get yourself made a sergeant, by Gosh, you've got to show the  <i>stuff</i>. You've got to be a <i>man</i>. You've got to have--"    
"Are you going to tell her?" interrupted the Bonnie Lassie who had been  sent for to share the news.    
The Little Red Doctor fell suddenly grave. "She's another matter," he  said. "I don't think I shall."    
Matters were going forward with Mayme--beg her pardon, Mary McCartney,  too.    
"Better and more of it," she wrote the Bonnie Lassie. "They rang me in  on one of their local Red Cross shows to do a monologue. Was I a hit?  Say, I got more flowers than a hearse! You've got to remember, though,  that they deliver flowers by the car-load out here. And the local stock  company has made me an offer. Ingenue parts. There is not the money that  I might get in the pictures, but the chance is better. So Marie  Courtenay moves on to the legit.--I mean the spoken drama. Look out for  me on Broadway later!"    
In the correspondence from Sergeant Berthelin there came a long hiatus  followed by a curt bit of official information: "Seriously wounded." The  Little Red Doctor brought the news to me, with a queer expression on  his face.    
"It doesn't look good, Dominie," he said. "You know, my old friend,  Death, is a shrewd picker. He's got an eye for men." He mused, rubbing  his tousled, brickish locks with a nervous hand. "I was getting to kind  of like that young pup," he muttered moodily.    
The saying that no news is good news was surely concocted by some one  who never chafed through day after lengthening day for that which does  not come. But in the end it did come, in the form of a scrawl from the  Weeping Scion himself. He was mending, but very slowly, and they said it  would be a long time--months, perhaps--before he could get back to the  front. Meantime, they were still picking odds and ends, chiefly  metallic, out of various parts of his system.    
"I'm one of the guys you read about that came over here to collect  souvenirs," he commented. "Well, I've got all I need of 'em. They can  have the rest. All I want now is to get back and present a few to  Fritzie before the show is over."    
Thereafter the Little Red Doctor exhibited, but read to us only in small  parts, quite bulky communications from overseas. Some of them, it became  known, he was forwarding to our little Mary, out in the Far West. With  her answer came the solution.    
"Some of the 'Grass and Asphalt' sketches are wonders; some not so good.  I am going to try out 'Doggy' if I can find a poodle with enough  intelligence to support me. But you need not have been so mysterious,  Doc, about your 'young amateur writer who seems to have some talent.'  Did you think I would not know it was David? Why, bless your dear, silly  heart, I told him some of those stories myself. But how does he get a  chance to write them? Is he back on this side? Or is he invalided? Or  what? Tell me. I want to know about him. You do not have to worry about  my--well, my infatuation for him, any more. He was a pretty boy, though,  wasn't he? But I have seen too many of that kind in the picture game.  I'm spoiled for them. How I would love to smear some of their pretty,  smirky faces! They give me a queer feeling in my breakfast. Excuse me: I  forgot I was a lady. But don't say 'pretty' to me any more. I'm through.  At that, you were all wrong about Buddy. He was a lot decenter than you  thought: only he was brought up wrong. Give him my love as one pal to  another. I hope he don't come back a He-ro. I'm offen he-roes, too.  Excuse again!"    
Wars and exiles alike come to an end in time. And in time our two  wanderers returned, but Mary first, David having been sent into Germany  with the Army of Occupation. Modest announcements in the theatrical  columns informed an indifferent theater-going world that Miss Marie  Courtenay, an actress new to Broadway, was to play the ingenue part in  the latest comedy by a highly popular dramatist. Immediately upon the  production, the theater-going world ceased to be indifferent to the new  actress; in fact, it went into one of its occasional furores about her.  Not that she was in any way a great genius, but she had a certain  indefinable and winningly individual quality. The critics discussed it  gravely and at length, differing argumentatively as to its nature and  constitution. I could have given them a hint. My predictions regarding  the ancestral potencies of the monkey-face were being abundantly  justified.    
No announcements, even of the most modest description, heralded the  arrival of Sergeant Major (if you please!) David Berthelin upon his  native shores. He came at once to Our Square and tackled the Little  Red Doctor.    
"Where is she?" he asked.    
The Little Red Doctor assumed an air of incredulous surprise. "Have you  still got <i>that</i> bee in your bonnet?" said he.    
"Where is she?" repeated the Weeping Scion.    
Maneuvering for time and counsel, the Little Red Doctor took him to see  the Bonnie Lassie and they sent for me. We beheld a new and  reconstituted David. He was no longer pretty. The soft brown eyes were  less soft and more alert, and there were little wrinkles at their  corners. He had broadened a foot or so. That pinky-delicate complexion  by which he had, in earlier and easier days, set obvious store, was  brownish and looked hardened. The Cupid's-bow of his mouth had  straightened out. High on one cheekbone was a not unsightly scar. His  manner was unassertive, but eminently self-respecting, and me, whom  aforetime he had stigmatized as a "white-whiskered old goat," he now  addressed as "Sir."    
"Perhaps <i>you'll</i> tell me where she is, sir," said he patiently.    
"Leave it to me," said the Bonnie Lassie, who has an unquenchable thirst  for the dramatic in real life. "And keep next Sunday night open."    
She arranged with Mary McCartney to give a reading on that evening, at  her studio, of David's "Doggy" from the "Grass and Asphalt" sketches  which he had written in hospital. It was a quaint, pathetic little  conceit, the bewildered philosophy of a waif of the streets, as  expressed to his waif of a dog. For the supporting part we borrowed  Willy Woolly from the House of Silvery Voices, and admirably he played  it, barking accurately and with true histrionic fervor in the right  places (besides promptly falling in love with the star at the first and  only rehearsal). After the try-out, Mary came over to my bench with a  check for a rather dazzling sum in her hand, and said that now was the  time to settle accounts, but she never could repay--and so forth and so  on; all put so sweetly and genuinely that I heartily wished I might  accept the thanks if not the check. Instead of which I blurted out  the truth.    
"Oh, <i>Dominie</i>!" said the girl, with such reproach that my heart sank  within me. "Do you think that was fair? Don't you know that I never  could have taken the money?"    
"Precisely. And we had to find a way to make you take it. We couldn't  have you dying on the premises," I argued with a feeble attempt at  jocularity.    
"But from <i>him</i>!" she said. "After what had happened--And his mother.  How could you let me do it!"    
"I thought you would have gotten over that feeling by this time," I  ventured.    
"Oh, there's none of the old feeling left," she answered, so simply that  I knew she believed her own statement. "But to have lived on his  money--Where is he?" she asked abruptly.    
I told her that also and about Sunday night; the whole thing. The Bonnie  Lassie would have slain me. But I couldn't help it. I was feeling  rather abject.    
Sunday night came, and with it Miss Marie Courtenay, escorted by an  "ace" covered with decorations, whose name is a household word and who  was only too obviously her adoring slave. Already there had been hints  of their engagement. Had I been that ace, I should have felt no small  discomposure at the sight of the girl's face when she first saw the  changed and matured Weeping Scion of three years before. After the first  flash of recognition she had developed on that expressive face of hers a  look of wonder and almost pathetic questioning, and, I thought, who knew  and loved the child, already something deeper and sweeter. Young David,  after greeting the star of the evening, took a modest rear seat as  befitted his rank. But when the Bonnie Lassie announced "Doggy," it was  his face that was the study.    
Of that performance I shall say nothing. It is now famous and familiar  to thousands of theater-goers. But if ever mortal man spent twenty  minutes in fairyland, it was David, while Mary was playing the work of  his fancy. At the close, he disappeared. I suppose he did not dare trust  himself to join in the congratulations with which she was overwhelmed. I  found him, as I rather expected, on the bench where he had sat when  Mayme McCartney first found him. And when the crowd had departed from  the studio, I told the girl. Without even stopping to put on her hat she  went out to him.    
He was sitting with his elbows on his knees and his fists supporting his  cheekbones. But this time he was not weeping. He was thinking. Just as  of old she put a hand on his humped shoulder. Startled, he looked up,  and jumped to his feet. She was holding something out to him.    
"What's that?" he said.    
"A check. For what I owe you."    
"Who told you? The Little Red Doctor promised--"    
"He's kept his promise. The Dominie told me."    
"Oh! I suppose," he said slowly, "I've got to take this. You  wouldn't--no, of course you wouldn't," he sighed.    
"I've tried to keep strict account," she said.    
David adopted a matter-of-fact tone. "I can't deny that it'll come in  handy, just now," he remarked. "At the present price of clothing, and  with my personal exchequer in its depleted state--"    
"Why," she broke in, "has anything happened? Your mother--?"    
"Cut off," said David briefly.    
"She's cut you off? On my account? Oh--"    
"No. I've cut her off. Temporarily. She doesn't want me to work. I'm  working. On a newspaper."    
"That's good," said the girl warmly. "Let's sit down."    
They sat down. Each, however, found it curiously hard to begin again.  Mary was aching to thank him, but had a dreadful fear that if she tried  to, she would cry. She didn't want to cry. She had a feeling that crying  would be a highly unstrategic procedure leading to possible alarming  developments. Why didn't David say something? Finally he did make a  beginning.    
"Mayme."    
"No: not 'Mayme' any more."    
He flushed to his temples. "I beg your pardon, Miss Courtenay."    
"Nonsense!" she said softly. "Mary. I've discarded the 'Mayme' long  ago."    
"Mary," he repeated in a tone of musing content.    
"Buddy."    
He caught his breath. "A few thousand of the best guys in the world," he  said, "call a fellow that. And every time they said it, it made my heart  ache with longing to hear it in your voice."    
"You're a queer Buddy," returned the girl, not quite steadily. "Did you  bring me home a German helmet for a souvenir?"    
He shook his head. "I didn't bring home much of anything, except some  experience and the discovery of the fact that when I had to stand on my  own feet, I wasn't much."    
"You got your stripes, didn't you?" suggested the girl.    
"That's all I did get," he returned jealously. "I didn't get any medal,  or palms or decorations or crosses of war: I didn't get anything except  an occasional calling down and a few scratches. If I'd had the luck to  get into aviation or some of the fancy branches--" David checked  himself. "There I go," he said in self-disgust. "Beefing again."    
It was quite in the old, spoiled-child tone; an echo of indestructible  personality, the Weeping Scion of other days; and it went straight to  Mary's swelling, bewildered, groping heart. She began to laugh and a sob  tangled itself in the laughter, and she choked and said:    
"Buddy."    
He turned toward her.    
"Don't be dumb, Buddy," she said, in the words of their unforgotten  first talk. "You've--you've got me--if you still want me."    
She put out a tremulous hand to him, and it slipped over his shoulder  and around his neck, and she was drawn close into his arms.    
"The Little Red Doctor," remarked David after an interlude, in the  shaken tone of one who has had undeserved miracles thrust upon him,  "said that to want something more than anything in the world and not get  it was good for my soul, besides serving me right."    
"The Little Red Doctor," retorted Mary McCartney, with the reckless  ingratitude of a woman in love, "is a dear little red idiot. What does  he know about <i>Us!</i>"
