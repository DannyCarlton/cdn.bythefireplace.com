After all Ernest didn't get many more socials to write for the  'Morning Intelligence,' as it happened; for the war that came on  shortly after crowded such trifles as socials fairly out of all the  papers, and he had harder work than ever to pick up a precarious  living somehow by the most casual possible contributions. Of course  he tried many other channels; but he had few introductions, and then  his views were really so absurdly ultra that no reasonable editor  could ever be expected to put up with them. He got tired at last of  seeing his well-meant papers return to him, morning after morning,  with the unvarying legend, 'Declined with thanks;' and he might have  gone to the wall utterly but for the kindly interest which Arthur  Berkeley still took in his and Edie's future. On the very day  after his conversation with Lancaster at the club Arthur dropped  round casually at Holloway, and brought with him a proposal which  he said had just been made him by a colonial newsagent. It was a  transparent little ruse enough; but Ernest and Edie were not learned  in the ways of the world and did not suspect it so readily as older  and wiser heads might probably have done. Would Ernest supply a  fortnightly letter, to go by the Australian mail, to the Paramatta  'Chronicle and News,' containing London political and social gossip  of a commonplace kind--just the petty chit-chat he could pick up  easily out of 'Truth' and the 'World'--for the small sum of thirty  shillings a letter?    
Yes, Ernest thought he could manage that.    
Very well, then. The letter must be sent on alternate Wednesdays  to the colonial newsagent's address, and it would be duly forwarded  by mail to the office of the Paramatta 'Chronicle.' A little  suspicious, that item, Berkeley thought, but Ernest swallowed it  like a child and made no comment. It must be addressed to 'Paramatta,  care of Lane & Co.,' and the payments would be made fortnightly  through the same agency. Arthur watched his friend's face narrowly  at this point again; but Ernest in his simple-minded, unsuspecting  wasy, never noticed the obvious meaning of this little deception.  He thanked Arthur over and over again for his kindness, but he  never guessed how far it extended. The letters kept him employed  for two days a week, or thereabouts, and though they never got  to Paramatta, nor any farther than Arthur Berkeley's own study in  the little house he had taken for himself at Chelsea, they were  regularly paid for through the colonial newsagents, by means of  a cheque which really owed its ultimate origin to Arthur Berkeley  himsslf. Fifteen shillings a week is not a large fortune, certainly;  but still it is considerably better than nothing, when you come to  try both methods of living by practical experience.    
Even so, however, Ernest and Edie had a hard struggle, with their  habits of life and Ernest's delicate health, to make both ends meet  upon that modest income. They found the necessity for recourse to  the imaginary pawnbroker growing upon them with alarming rapidity;  and though the few small articles that they sent out for that purpose  never really went beyond kind Mrs. Halliss's kitchen dresser, yet  so far as Ernest and Edie were concerned, the effect was much the  same as if they had been really pledged to the licensed broker.  The good woman hid them away carefully in the back drawers of the  dresser, sending up as much money for the poor little trinkets as  she thought it at all credible that any man in his senses could  possibly advance--if she had given altogether too much, she thought  it probable that even the unsuspicious Le Bretons would detect the  kindly deception--at the time remarking to John that 'if ever them  pore dear young creechurs was able to redeem 'em again, why, well  an' good; an' if not, why, they could just find some excuse to  give 'em back to the dear lady after pore Mr. Le Breting was dead  an' gone, as he must be, no doubt, afore many months was over.'  What wretched stuff that is that some narrow-minded cynics love  to talk, after their cheap moralising fashion, about the coldness  and cruelty of the world! The world is not cold and cruel; it is  brimming over everywhere with kindliness and warmth of heart; and  you have only got to put yourself into the proper circumstances  in order to call forth at once on every hand, and in all classes,  its tenderest and truest sympathies. None but selfish, unsympathetic  people themselves ever find it otherwise in the day of trouble. It  is not the world that is cold and heartless--it is not the individual  members of the world that are cruel and unkind--it is the relentless  march of circumstances--the faulty organisation which none of us  can control, and for which none of us is personally responsible,  that grinds us to powder under its Juggernaut wheels. Private  kindliness is for ever trying, feebly and unsuccessfully, but with  its best efforts, to undo the evil that general mismanagement is  for ever perpetrating in its fateful course.    
One day, a few weeks later, Arthur Berkeley called in again, and on  the stairs he met a child playing--a neighbour's child whom good  Mrs. Halliss allowed to come in and amuse herself while the mother  went out charing. The girl had a bright gold object in her hand;  and Arthur, wondering how she came by it, took it from her and  looked at it curiously. He recognised it in a moment for what it  was--a gold bracelet, a well remembered gold bracelet--the very  one that he himself had given as a wedding present to poor Edie.  He turned it over and looked closely at the inside: cut into the  soft gold he saw the one word 'Frustra,' that he himself had carved  into it with his penknife the night before the memorable wedding.    
'Where did you get this?' he asked the child.    
'Mrs. 'Alliss give it me,' the little one answered, beginning to  cry.    
Arthur ran lightly down the steps again, and knocked at the door of  Mrs. Halliss's kitchen, with the tell-tale bracelet in his hand.  Mrs. Halliss opened the dcor to him respectfully, and after a faint  attempt at innocent prevarication, felt bound to let out all the  pitiful little secret without further preamble. So Arthur, good,  kind-hearted, delicate-souled Arthur, took his seat sadly upon one  of the hard wooden kitchen chairs, and waited patiently while Mrs.  Halliss and honest John, in their roundabout inarticulate fashion,  slowly unfolded the story how them two pore young creechurs upstairs  had been druv that low through want of funs that Mrs. Le Breting,  God bless 'er 'eart, 'ad 'ad to pawn her poor little bits of  jewelry and such like: and how they 'adn't 'ad the face to go an'  pawn it for her, and so 'ad locked it up in their drawers, and  waited hopefully for better times. Arthur listened to all this with  an aching heart, and went home alone to ponder on the best way of  still further assisting them.    
The only thing that occurred to him was a plan for giving Edie,  too, a little relief, in the way of what she might suppose to be  money-getting occupation. She used to paint a little in water-colours,  he remembered, in the old days; so he put an advertisement in a  morning paper, which he got Mrs. Halliss to show Edie, asking for  drawings of orchids, the flowers to be supplied and accurately copied  by an amateur at a reasonable price. Edie fell into the harmless  friendly trap readily enough, and was duly supplied with orchids by  a florist in Regent Street, who professed to receive his instructions  from the advertiser. The pictures were all produced in due time,  and were sent to a fixed address, where a gentleman in a hansom used  to call for them at regular intervals. Arthur Berkeley kept those  poor little water-colours long afterwards locked up in a certain  drawer all by themselves: they were sacred mementoes to him of that  old hopeless love for the little Miss Butterfly of his Oxford days.    
With the very first three guineas that Edie earned, carefully  saved and hoarded out of her payments for the water-colours, she  insisted in the pride of her heart that Ernest should go and visit  a great London consulting physician. Sir Antony Wraxall was the  best specialist in town on the subject of consumption, she had heard,  and she was quite sure so clever a man must do Ernest a great deal  of good, if he didn't even permanently cure him.    
'It's no use, Edie darling,' Ernest said to her imploringly. 'You'll  only be wasting your hard-earned money. What I want is not advice  or medicine; I want what no doctor on earth can possibly give  me--relief from this terrible crushing responsibility.'    
But Edie would bear no refusal. It was <i>her</i> money, she said, the  first she had ever earned in her whole life, and she should certainly  do as she herself liked with it. Sir Antony Wraxall, she was quite  confident, would soon be able to make him better.    
So Ernest, overborne by her intreaties, yielded at last, and made  an appointment with Sir Antony Wraxall. He took his quarter-hour in  due form, and told the great physician all his symptoms as though  he believed in the foolish farce. Sir Antony held his head solemnly  on one side, weighed him with puritanical scrupulosity to a quarter  of an ounce on his delicate balance, listened attentively at the  chest with his silver-mounted stethoscope, and perpended the net  result of his investigation with professional gravity; then he gave  Edie his full advice and opinion to the maximum extent of five  minutes.    
'Your husband's case is not a hopeful one, Mrs. Le Breton,' he said  solemnly, 'but still, a great deal may be done for him.' Edie's face  brightened visibly. 'With care, his life may be prolonged for many  years,--I may even say, indeed, quite indefinitely.' Edie smiled  with joy and gratitude. 'But you must strictly observe my rules  and directions--the same that I've just given in a similar case to  the Crown Prince of Servia who was here before you. In the first  place, your husband must give up work altogether. He must be  content to live perfectly and absolutely idle. Then, secondly, he  must live quite away from England. I should recommend the Engadine  in summer, and Algeria or the Nile trip every winter; but, if that's  beyond your means--and I understand from Mr. Le Breton that you're  in somewhat straitened circumstances--I don't object to Catania,  or Malaga, or even Mentone and the Riviera. You can rent furnished  villas for very little on the Riviera. But he must in no case come  farther north, even in summer, than the Lake of Geneva. That, I  assure you, is quite indispensable, if he wishes to live another  twelvemonth. Take him south at once, in a coupe-lit of course, and  break the journey once or twice at Lyons and Marseilles. Next, as  to diet, he must live generously--very generously. Don't let him  drink claret; claret's poor sour stuff; a pint of good champagne  daily, or a good, full-bodied, genial vintage Burgundy would be  far better and more digestible for him. Oysters, game, sweetbreads,  red mullet, any little delicacy of that sort as much as possible.  Don't let him walk; let him have carriage exercise daily; you can  hire carriages for a mere trifle monthly at Cannes and Mentone.  Above all things, give him perfect freedom from anxiety. Allow him  to concentrate his whole attention on the act of getting well,  and you'll find he'll improve astonishingly in no time. But if you  keep him here in England and feed him badly and neglect my directions,  I can't answer for his getting through another winter....Don't  disturb yourself, I beg of you; don't, pray, give way to tears;  there is really no occasion for it, my dear madam, no occasion for  it at all, if you'll only do as I tell you....Quite right, thank  you. Good morning.--Next case, McFarlane.--Good morning. Good  morning.'    
So that was the end of weeping little Edie's poor hardly-spared  three guineas.    
The very next day Arthur Berkeley happened to mount the stairs  quietly, at an earlier hour than usual, and knocked at the door  of Ernest's lodging. There was no answer, so he turned the handle,  and entered by himself. The remains of breakfast lay upon the  table. Arthur did not want to spy, but he couldn't help remarking  that these remains were extremely meagre and scanty. Half a loaf  of bread stood upon a solitary plate in the centre; a teapot and  two cups occupied one side; and--that was all. In spite of himself,  he couldn't restrain his curiosity, and he looked more closely at  the knives and plates. Not a mark of anything but crumbs upon them,  not even butter! He looked into the cups. Nothing but milkless  tea at the bottom! Yes, the truth was only too evident; they had  had no meat for breakfast, no butter, no milk, no sugar; it was  quite clear that the meal had consisted entirely of dry bread with  plain tea--call it hot water--and that for a dying man and a delicate  over-worked lady! Arthur looked at that pitiable breakfast-table with  a twinge of remorse, and the tears rose sharply and involuntarily  into his eyes. He had not done enough for them, then; he had not  done enough for them.    
Poor little Miss Butterfly! and had it really come to this! You,  so bright, so light, so airy, in want, in positive want, in hunger  even, with your good, impossible, impracticable Ernest! Had it  come to this! Bread and water; dry bread and water! Down tears,  down; a man must be a man; but, oh, what a bitter sight for Arthur  Berkeley! And yet, what could he do to mend it? Money they would  not take; he dare not even offer it; and he was at his wit's end  for any other contrivance for serving them without their knowledge.  He must do what he could; but how he was to do it, he couldn't  imagine.    
As he stood there, ruminating bitterly over that poor bare table,  he thought he heard sounds above, as of Edie coming downstairs  with Dot on her shoulder. He knew she would not like to know that  he had surprised the secret of their dire poverty; and he turned  silently and cautiously to descend the stair. There was only just  time enough to get away, for Edie was even then opening the door  of the nursery. Noiselessly, with cat-like tread, he crept down  the steps once more, and heard Edie descending, and singing as she  came down to Dot. It was a plaintive little song, in a sad key--a  plaintive little song of his own--but not wholly distressful,  Arthur thought; she could still sing, then, to her baby! With the  hot tears rising a second time to his eyes, he groped his way to  the foot of the staircase. There he brushed them hurriedly aside  with his hand, and turned out into the open street. The children  were playing and tumbling in the sun, and a languid young man  in a faultless frock coat and smooth silk hat was buying a showy  button-hole flower from the little suburban florist's opposite.    
With a heavy heart Arthur Berkeley turned homeward to his own cosy  little cottage; that modest palace of art which he had once hoped  little Miss Butterfly might have shared with him. He went up the  steps, and turned quickly into his own small study. The Progenitor  was there, sitting reading in an easy-chair. 'At least,' Arthur  thought to himself, 'I have made <i>his</i> old age happy. If I could only  do as much for little Miss Butterfly! for little Miss Butterfly!  for little Miss Butterfly! If I could only do as much for her, oh,  how happy and contented I should be!'    
He flung himself down on his own sofa, and brushed big eyes nervously  with his handkerchief before he dared lookup again towards the  Progenitor. 'Father,' he said, clutching his watchchain hard and  playing with it nervously to keep down his emotion, 'I'm afraid  those poor Le Bretons are in an awfully bad way. I'm afraid, do you  know, that they actually haven't enough to eat! I went into their  rooms just now, and, would you believe it, I found nothing on the  table for breakfast but dry bread and tea!'    
The Progenitor looked up quietly from the volume of Morley's 'Voltaire'  which he was at that moment placidly engaged in devouring. 'Nothing  but dry bread and tea,' he said, in what seemed to Arthur a horribly  unconcerned tone. 'Really, hadn't they? Well, I dare say they <i>are</i>  very badly off, poor people. But after all, you know, Artie, they  can't be really poor, for Le Breton told me himself he was generally  earning fifteen shillings or a pound a week, and that, you see, is  really for three people a very good income, now isn't it?'    
Arthur, delicate-minded, gentle, chivalrous Arthur, gazed in surprise  and sudden distress at that dear, good, unselfish old father of  his. How extraordinary that the kindly old man couldn't grasp the  full horror of the situation! How strange that he, who would himself  have been so tender, so considerate, so womanly in his care and  sympathy towards anything that seemed to him like real poverty  or real suffering, should have been so blinded by his long hard  workingman life towards the peculiar difficulties and trials of  classes other than his own as not to recognise the true meaning of  that dreadful disclosure! Arthur was not angry with him--he felt  too fully at that moment what depths of genuine silent hardship  uncomplainingly endured were implied in the stoically calm frame  of mind which could treat Edie Le Breton's penury of luxuries as  a comparatively slight matter: after all, his father was right at  bottom; such mere sentimental middle-class poverty is as nothing  to the privations of the really poor; yet he could not help feeling  a little disappointed for all that. He wanted sympathy in his  pity, and he could clearly expect none here. 'Why, father,' he  cried bitterly, 'you don't throw yourself into the position as you  ought to do. A pound a week, paid regularly, would be a splendid  income of course for people brought up like you or me. But just  consider how those two young people have been brought up! Consider  their wants and their habits! Consider the luxury they have been  accustomed to! And then think of their being obliged to want now  almost for food in their last extremity!'    
His father answered in the same quiet tone--not hardly, but calmly,  as though he were discussing a problem in political economy instead  of the problem of Edie Le Breton's happiness--'Well, you see, it's  all a matter of the standard of comfort. These two friends of yours  have been brought up above their future; and now that they're got  to come down to their natural level, why, of course, they feel it,  depend upon it, they feel it. Their parents, of course, shouldn't  have accustomed them to a style of life above their station. Good  dry bread, not too stale, does nobody any harm: still, I dare say  they don't like coming down to it. But bless your heart, Artie,  if you'd seen the real want and poverty that I've seen, my boy--the  actual hunger and cold and nakedness that I've known honest working  people brought down to by no work, and nothing but the House open  before them, or not that even, you wouldn't think so much of the  sentimental grievances of people who are earning fifteen shillings  a week in ease and comfort.'    
'But, Father,' Arthur went on, scarcely able to keep down the  rising tone of indignation at such seeming heartlessness, 'Ernest  doesn't earn even that always. Sometimes he earns nothing, or next  to nothing; and it's the uncertainty and insecurity that tells  upon them even more than the poverty itself. Oh, Father, Father,  you who have always been so good and kind, I never heard you speak  so cruelly about anyone before as you're speaking now about that  poor, friendless, helpless, penniless, heart-broken little woman!'    
The old shoemaker caught at the word suddenly, and looking him  through and through with an unexpected gleam of discovery, laid  down the life of Voltaire on the table with a bang, and sat straight  upright in his chair, nodding his head, and muttering slowly to  himself, 'Little woman--he said "little woman!" Poor Artie, Poor  Artie!' in a tone of inexpressible pity. At last he turned to Arthur  and cried with a voice of womanly tenderness, 'My boy, my boy, I  didn't know before it was the lassie you were thinking of; I thought  it was only poor young Le Breton. I see it all now; I've surprised  your secret; you've let it out to me without knowing it. Oh, Artie,  if that's She, I'm sorry for her, and I'm sorry for you, my boy,  from the bottom of my heart. If that's She, Artie, we'll put our  heads together, and see what plan we can manage to save her from  what she has never been accustomed to. Don't think too hardly of  your old Progenitor, Artie; he hasn't mixed with these people all  his life, and learned to sympathise with them as you've done, my  son; he doesn't understand them or know their troubles as you do:  but if that's her that you told me about one day, we shall find the  means to make her happy and comfortable yet, if we have to starve  for it. Dear Arthur, do not think I could be harsh or unfeeling  for a moment to the woman that you ever once in passing fixed your  heart upon. Let's talk it over and think it over, and sooner or  later we'll surely find the way to accomplish it.'
