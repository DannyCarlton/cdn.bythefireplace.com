  For a few minutes after finding the handkerchief at his door, Alan  experienced a feeling of mingled curiosity and disappointment&#8212;also a  certain resentment. The suspicion that he was becoming involved in  spite of himself was not altogether pleasant. The evening, up to a  certain point, had been fairly entertaining. It was true he might have  passed a pleasanter hour recalling old times with Stampede Smith, or  discussing Kadiak bears with the English earl, or striking up an  acquaintance with the unknown graybeard who had voiced an opinion about  John Graham. But he was not regretting lost hours, nor was he holding  Mary Standish accountable for them. It was, last of all, the  handkerchief that momentarily upset him.
  Why had she dropped it at his door? It was not a dangerous-looking  affair, to be sure, with its filmy lace edging and ridiculous  diminutiveness. As the question came to him, he was wondering how even  as dainty a nose as that possessed by Mary Standish could be much  comforted by it. But it was pretty. And, like Mary Standish, there was  something exquisitely quiet and perfect about it, like the simplicity  of her hair. He was not analyzing the matter. It was a thought that  came to him almost unconsciously, as he tossed the annoying bit of  fabric on the little table at the head of his berth. Undoubtedly the  dropping of it had been entirely unpremeditated and accidental. At  least he told himself so. And he also assured himself, with an  involuntary shrug of his shoulders, that any woman or girl had the  right to pass his door if she so desired, and that he was an idiot for  thinking otherwise. The argument was only slightly adequate. But Alan  was not interested in mysteries, especially when they had to do with  woman&#8212;and such an absurdly inconsequential thing as a handkerchief.
  A second time he went to bed. He fell asleep thinking about Keok and  Nawadlook and the people of his range. From somewhere he had been given  the priceless heritage of dreaming pleasantly, and Keok was very real,  with her swift smile and mischievous face, and Nawadlook's big, soft  eyes were brighter than when he had gone away. He saw Tautuk, gloomy as  usual over the heartlessness of Keok. He was beating a tom-tom that  gave out the peculiar sound of bells, and to this Amuk Toolik was  dancing the Bear Dance, while Keok clapped her hands in exaggerated  admiration. Even in his dreams Alan chuckled. He knew what was  happening, and that out of the corners of her laughing eyes Keok was  enjoying Tautuk's jealousy. Tautuk was so stupid he would never  understand. That was the funny part of it. And he beat his drum  savagely, scowling so that he almost shut his eyes, while Keok laughed  outright.
  It was then that Alan opened his eyes and heard the last of the  ship's bells. It was still dark. He turned on the light and looked at  his watch. Tautuk's drum had tolled eight bells, aboard the ship, and  it was four o'clock in the morning.
  Through the open port came the smell of sea and land, and with it a  chill air which Alan drank in deeply as he stretched himself for a few  minutes after awakening. The tang of it was like wine in his blood, and  he got up quietly and dressed while he smoked the stub-end of a cigar  he had laid aside at midnight. Not until he had finished dressing did  he notice the handkerchief on the table. If its presence had suggested  a significance a few hours before, he no longer disturbed himself by  thinking about it. A bit of carelessness on the girl's part, that was  all. He would return it. Mechanically he put the crumpled bit of  cambric in his coat pocket before going on deck.
  He had guessed that he would be alone. The promenade was deserted.  Through the ghost-white mist of morning he saw the rows of empty  chairs, and lights burning dully in the wheel-house. Asian monsoon and  the drifting warmth of the Japan current had brought an early spring to  the Alexander Archipelago, and May had stolen much of the flowering  softness of June. But the dawns of these days were chilly and gray.  Mists and fogs settled in the valleys, and like thin smoke rolled down  the sides of the mountains to the sea, so that a ship traveling the  inner waters felt its way like a child creeping in darkness.
  Alan loved this idiosyncrasy of the Alaskan coast. The phantom  mystery of it was stimulating, and in the peril of it was a challenging  lure. He could feel the care with which the<I> Nome</I> was picking her  way northward. Her engines were thrumming softly, and her movement was  a slow and cautious glide, catlike and slightly trembling, as if every  pound of steel in her were a living nerve widely alert. He knew Captain  Rifle would not be asleep and that straining eyes were peering into the  white gloom from the wheel-house. Somewhere west of them, hazardously  near, must lie the rocks of Admiralty Island; eastward were the still  more pitiless glacial sandstones and granites of the coast, with that  deadly finger of sea-washed reef between, along the lip of which they  must creep to Juneau. And Juneau could not be far ahead.
  He leaned over the rail, puffing at the stub of his cigar. He was  eager for his work. Juneau, Skagway, and Cordova meant nothing to him,  except that they were Alaska. He yearned for the still farther north,  the wide tundras, and the mighty achievement that lay ahead of him  there. His blood sang to the surety of it now, and for that reason he  was not sorry he had spent seven months of loneliness in the States. He  had proved with his own eyes that the day was near when Alaska would  come into her own. Gold! He laughed. Gold had its lure, its romance,  its thrill, but what was all the gold the mountains might possess  compared with this greater thing he was helping to build! It seemed to  him the people he had met in the south had thought only of gold when  they learned he was from Alaska. Always gold&#8212;that first, and then ice,  snow, endless nights, desolate barrens, and craggy mountains frowning  everlastingly upon a blasted land in which men fought against odds and  only the fittest survived. It was gold that had been Alaska's doom.  When people thought of it, they visioned nothing beyond the old  stampede days, the Chilkoot, White Horse, Dawson, and Circle City.  Romance and glamor and the tragedies of dead men clung to their ribs.  But they were beginning to believe now. Their eyes were opening. Even  the Government was waking up, after proving there was something besides  graft in railroad building north of Mount St. Elias. Senators and  Congressmen at Washington had listened to him seriously, and especially  to Carl Lomen. And the beef barons, wisest of all, had tried to buy him  off and had offered a fortune for Lomen's forty thousand head of  reindeer in the Seward Peninsula! That was proof of the awakening.  Absolute proof.
  He lighted a fresh cigar, and his mind shot through the dissolving  mist into the vast land ahead of him. Some Alaskans had cursed Theodore  Roosevelt for putting what they called &#8220;the conservation shackles&#8221; on  their country. But he, for one, did not. Roosevelt's far-sightedness  had kept the body-snatchers at bay, and because he had foreseen what  money-power and greed would do, Alaska was not entirely stripped today,  but lay ready to serve with all her mighty resources the mother who had  neglected her for a generation. But it was going to be a struggle, this  opening up of a great land. It must be done resourcefully and with  intelligence. Once the bars were down, Roosevelt's shadow-hand could  not hold back such desecrating forces as John Graham and the syndicate  he represented.
  Thought of Graham was an unpleasant reminder, and his face grew hard  in the sea-mist. Alaskans themselves must fight against the licensed  plunderers. And it would be a hard fight. He had seen the pillaging  work of these financial brigands in a dozen states during the past  winter&#8212;states raped of their forests, their lakes and streams robbed  and polluted, their resources hewn down to naked skeletons. He had been  horrified and a little frightened when he looked over the desolation of  Michigan, once the richest timber state in America. What if the  Government at Washington made it possible for such a thing to happen in  Alaska? Politics&#8212;and money&#8212;were already fighting for just that thing.
  He no longer heard the throb of the ship under his feet. It was<I>  his</I> fight, and brain and muscle reacted to it almost as if it had  been a physical thing. And his end of that fight he was determined to  win, if it took every year of his life. He, with a few others, would  prove to the world that the millions of acres of treeless tundras of  the north were not the cast-off ends of the earth. They would populate  them, and the so-called &#8220;barrens&#8221; would thunder to the innumerable  hoofs of reindeer herds as the American plains had never thundered to  the beat of cattle. He was not thinking of the treasure he would find  at the end of this rainbow of success which he visioned. Money, simply  as money, he hated. It was the achievement of the thing that gripped  him; the passion to hew a trail through which his beloved land might  come into its own, and the desire to see it achieve a final triumph by  feeding a half of that America which had laughed at it and kicked it  when it was down.
  The tolling of the ship's bell roused him from the subconscious  struggle into which he had allowed himself to be drawn. Ordinarily he  had no sympathy with himself when he fell into one of these mental  spasms, as he called them. Without knowing it, he was a little proud of  a certain dispassionate tolerance which he possessed&#8212;a philosophical  mastery of his emotions which at times was almost cold-blooded, and  which made some people think he was a thing of stone instead of flesh  and blood. His thrills he kept to himself. And a mildly disturbing  sensation passed through him now, when he found that unconsciously his  fingers had twined themselves about the little handkerchief in his  pocket. He drew it out and made a sudden movement as if to toss it  overboard. Then, with a grunt expressive of the absurdity of the thing,  he replaced it in his pocket and began to walk slowly toward the bow of  the ship.
  He wondered, as he noted the lifting of the fog, what he would have  been had he possessed a sister like Mary Standish. Or any family at  all, for that matter&#8212;even an uncle or two who might have been  interested in him. He remembered his father vividly, his mother a  little less so, because his mother had died when he was six and his  father when he was twenty. It was his father who stood out above  everything else, like the mountains he loved. The father would remain  with him always, inspiring him, urging him, encouraging him to live  like a gentleman, fight like a man, and die at last unafraid. In that  fashion the older Alan Holt had lived and died. But his mother, her  face and voice scarcely remembered in the passing of many years, was  more a hallowed memory to him than a thing of flesh and blood. And  there had been no sisters or brothers. Often he had regretted this lack  of brotherhood. But a sister.... He grunted his disapprobation of the  thought. A sister would have meant enchainment to civilization. Cities,  probably. Even the States. And slavery to a life he detested. He  appreciated the immensity of his freedom. A Mary Standish, even though  she were his sister, would be a catastrophe. He could not conceive of  her, or any other woman like her, living with Keok and Nawadlook and  the rest of his people in the heart of the tundras. And the tundras  would always be his home, because his heart was there.
  He had passed round the wheel-house and came suddenly upon an odd  figure crumpled in a chair. It was Stampede Smith. In the clearer light  that came with the dissolution of the sea-mist Alan saw that he was not  asleep. He paused, unseen by the other. Stampede stretched himself,  groaned, and stood up. He was a little man, and his fiercely bristling  red whiskers, wet with dew, were luxuriant enough for a giant. His head  of tawny hair, bristling like his whiskers, added to the piratical  effect of him above the neck, but below that part of his anatomy there  was little to strike fear into the hearts of humanity. Some people  smiled when they looked at him. Others, not knowing their man, laughed  outright. Whiskers could be funny. And they were undoubtedly funny on  Stampede Smith. But Alan neither smiled nor laughed, for in his heart  was something very near to the missing love of brotherhood for this  little man who had written his name across so many pages of Alaskan  history.
  This morning, as Alan saw him, Stampede Smith was no longer the  swiftest gunman between White Horse and Dawson City. He was a pathetic  reminder of the old days when, single-handed, he had run down Soapy  Smith and his gang&#8212;days when the going of Stampede Smith to new fields  meant a stampede behind him, and when his name was mentioned in the  same breath with those of George Carmack, and Alex McDonald, and Jerome  Chute, and a hundred men like Curley Monroe and Joe Barret set their  compasses by his. To Alan there was tragedy in his aloneness as he  stood in the gray of the morning. Twenty times a millionaire, he knew  that Stampede Smith was broke again.
  &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he said so unexpectedly that the little man jerked  himself round like the lash of a whip, a trick of the old gun days.  &#8220;Why so much loneliness, Stampede?&#8221;
  Stampede grinned wryly. He had humorous, blue eyes, buried like an  Airedale's under brows which bristled even more fiercely than his  whiskers. &#8220;I'm thinkin',&#8221; said he, &#8220;what a fool thing is money. Good  mornin', Alan!&#8221;
  He nodded and chuckled, and continued to chuckle in the face of the  lifting fog, and Alan saw the old humor which had always been  Stampede's last asset when in trouble. He drew nearer and stood beside  him, so that their shoulders touched as they leaned over the rail.
  &#8220;Alan,&#8221; said Stampede, &#8220;it ain't often I have a big thought, but  I've been having one all night. Ain't forgot Bonanza, have you?&#8221;
  Alan shook his head. &#8220;As long as there is an Alaska, we won't forget  Bonanza, Stampede.&#8221;
  &#8220;I took a million out of it, next to Carmack's Discovery&#8212;an' went  busted afterward, didn't I?&#8221;
  Alan nodded without speaking.
  &#8220;But that wasn't a circumstance to Gold Run Creek, over the Divide,&#8221;  Stampede continued ruminatively. &#8220;Ain't forgot old Aleck McDonald, the  Scotchman, have you, Alan? In the 'wash' of Ninety-eight we took up  seventy sacks to bring our gold back in and we lacked thirty of doin'  the job. Nine hundred thousand dollars in a single clean-up, and that  was only the beginning. Well, I went busted again. And old Aleck went  busted later on. But he had a pretty wife left. A girl from Seattle. I  had to grub-stake.&#8221;
  He was silent for a moment, caressing his damp whiskers, as he noted  the first rose-flush of the sun breaking through the mist between them  and the unseen mountain tops.
  &#8220;Five times after that I made strikes and went busted,&#8221; he said a  little proudly. &#8220;And I'm busted again!&#8221;
  &#8220;I know it,&#8221; sympathized Alan.
  &#8220;They took every cent away from me down in Seattle an' Frisco,&#8221;  chuckled Stampede, rubbing his hands together cheerfully, &#8220;an' then  bought me a ticket to Nome. Mighty fine of them, don't you think?  Couldn't have been more decent. I knew that fellow Kopf had a heart.  That's why I trusted him with my money. It wasn't his fault he lost  it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course not,&#8221; agreed Alan.
  &#8220;And I'm sort of sorry I shot him up for it. I am, for a fact.&#8221;
  &#8220;You killed him?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not quite. I clipped one ear off as a reminder, down in Chink  Holleran's place. Mighty sorry. Didn't think then how decent it was of  him to buy me a ticket to Nome. I just let go in the heat of the  moment. He did me a favor in cleanin' me, Alan. He did, so help me! You  don't realize how free an' easy an' beautiful everything is until  you're busted.&#8221;
  Smiling, his odd face almost boyish behind its ambush of hair, he  saw the grim look in Alan's eyes and about his jaws. He caught hold of  the other's arm and shook it.
  &#8220;Alan, I mean it!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;That's why I think money is a fool  thing. It ain't<I> spendin'<I> money that makes me happy. It's<I>  findin'<I> it&#8212;the gold in the mountains&#8212;that makes the blood run fast  through my gizzard. After I've found it, I can't find any use for it in  particular. I want to go broke. If I didn't, I'd get lazy and fat, an'  some newfangled doctor would operate on me, and I'd die. They're doing  a lot of that operatin' down in Frisco, Alan. One day I had a pain, and  they wanted to cut out something from inside me. Think what can happen  to a man when he's got money!&#8221;</I></I></I></I>
  &#8220;You mean all that, Stampede?&#8221;
  &#8220;On my life, I do. I'm just aching for the open skies, Alan. The  mountains. And the yellow stuff that's going to be my playmate till I  die. Somebody'll grub-stake me in Nome.&#8221;
  &#8220;They won't,&#8221; said Alan suddenly. &#8220;Not if I can help it. Stampede, I  want you. I want you with me up under the Endicott Mountains. I've got  ten thousand reindeer up there. It's No Man's Land, and we can do as we  please in it. I'm not after gold. I want another sort of thing. But  I've fancied the Endicott ranges are full of that yellow playmate of  yours. It's a new country. You've never seen it. God only knows what  you may find. Will you come?&#8221;
  The humorous twinkle had gone out of Stampede's eyes. He was staring  at Alan.
  &#8220;Will I<I> come?</I> Alan, will a cub nurse its mother? Try me. Ask  me. Say it all over ag'in.&#8221;
  The two men gripped hands. Smiling, Alan nodded to the east. The  last of the fog was clearing swiftly. The tips of the cragged Alaskan  ranges rose up against the blue of a cloudless sky, and the morning sun  was flashing in rose and gold at their snowy peaks. Stampede also  nodded. Speech was unnecessary. They both understood, and the thrill of  the life they loved passed from one to the other in the grip of their  hands.
