At Tilgate and Chetwood next morning, two distinguished households  were thrown into confusion by the news in the papers. To Colonel  Kelmscott and to Elma Clifford alike that news came with crushing  force and horror. A murder, said the Times, had been committed in  Devonshire, in a romantic dell, on the skirts of Dartmoor. No element  of dramatic interest was wanting to the case; persons, place, and  time were all equally remarkable. The victim of the outrage was Mr.  Montague Nevitt, confidential clerk to Messrs. Drummond, Coutts,  and Barclay, the well-known bankers, and himself a familiar figure  in musical society in London. The murderer was presumably a young  journalist, Mr. Guy Waring, not unknown himself in musical circles,  and brother of that rising landscape painter, Mr. Cyril Waring,  whose pictures of wild life in forest scenery had lately attracted  considerable attention at the Academy and the Grosvenor. Mr. Guy  Waring had been arrested the day before on the pier at Dover, where  he had just arrived by the Ostend packet. It was supposed by the  police that he had hastily crossed the Channel from Plymouth to  Cherbourg, soon after the murder, to escape detection, and, after  journeying by cross-country routes through France and Belgium, had  returned via Ostend to the shores of England. It was a triumphant  vindication of our much maligned detective system that within a few  hours after the discovery of the body on Dartmoor, the supposed  criminal should have been recognised, arrested, and detained among  a thousand others, in a busy port, at the very opposite extremity  of southern England.    
Colonel Kelmscott that day was strangely touched, even before  he took up his morning paper. A letter from Granville, posted at  Plymouth, had just reached him by the early mail, to tell him that  the only son he had ever really loved or cared for on earth had  sailed the day before, a disinherited outcast, to seek his fortune  in the wild wastes of Africa. How he could break the news to Lady  Emily he couldn't imagine. The Colonel, twisting his white moustache,  with a quivering hand on his tremulous lip, hardly dared to realize  what their future would seem like. And then--he turned to the  paper, and saw to his horror this awful tale of a cold-blooded and  cowardly murder, committed on a friend by one who, however little  he might choose to acknowledge it, was after all his own eldest  son, a Kelmscott of Tilgate, as much as Granville himself, in lawful  wedlock duly begotten.    
The proud but broken man gazed at the deadly announcement in blank  amaze and agony. His Nemesis had come. Guy Waring was his own  son--and Guy Waring was a murderer.    
He tried to argue with himself at first that this tragic result in  some strange way justified him, after the event, for his own long  neglect of his parental responsibilities. The young man was no  true Kelmscott at heart, he was sure, or such an act as that would  have revolted and appalled him. He was no true son in reality; his  order disowned him. Base blood flowed in his veins, and made crimes  like these conceivable.    
"I was right after all," the Colonel thought, "not to acknowledge  these half low-born lads as the heirs of Tilgate. Bad blood will  out in the end--and <i>this</i> is the result of it."    
And then, with sudden revulsion he thought once more--God help  him! How could he say such things in his heart even now of <i>her</i>,  his pure, trustful Lucy? She was better than him in her soul, he  knew--ten thousand times better. If bad blood came in anywhere, it  came in from himself, not from that simple-hearted, innocent little  country-bred angel.    
And perhaps if he'd treated these lads as he ought, and brought  them up to their own, and made them Kelmscotts indeed, instead of  nameless adventurers, they might never have fallen into such abysses  of turpitude. But he had let them grow up in ignorance of their  own origin, with the vague stain of a possible illegitimacy hanging  over their heads; and what wonder if they forgot in the end how  noblesse oblige, and sank at last into foul depths of vice and  criminality?    
As he read on, his head swam with the cumulative evidence of that  deliberately planned and cruelly executed yet brutal murder. The  details of the crime gave him a sickening sense of loathing and  incredulity. Impossible that his own son could have schemed and  carried out so vile an attack upon a helpless person, who had once  been his nearest and dearest companion. And yet, the account in  the paper gave him no alternative but to believe it. Nevitt and  Guy Waring had been inseparable friends. They had dined together,  supped together, played duets in their own rooms, gone out to the  same parties, belonged to the same club, in all things been closer  than even the two twin brothers. Some quarrel seemed to have  arisen about a matter of speculations in which both had suffered.  They separated at once--separated in anger. Nevitt went down to  Devonshire by himself for his holiday. Then Waring followed him,  without any pretence at concealment; inquired for him at the village  inn with expressions of deadly hate; tracked him to a lonely place  in the adjacent wood; choked him, apparently with some form of  garotte or twisted rope--for the injuries seemed greater than even  the most powerful man could possibly inflict with the hands alone;  and hid the body of his murdered friend at last in a mossy dell  by the bank of the streamlet. Nor was that all; for with callous  effrontery he had returned to the inn, still inquiring after his  victim; and had gone off next morning early with a lie on his lips,  pretending even then to nurse his undying wrath and to be bent on  following up with coarse threats of revenge his stark and silent  enemy.    
So far the Times. But to Colonel Kelmscott, reading in between  the lines as he went, there was more in it than even that. He saw,  though dimly, some hint of a motive. For it was at Mambury that  all these things had taken place; and it was at Mambury that the  secret of Guy Waring's descent lay buried, as he thought, in the  parish registers. What it all meant, Colonel Kelmscott couldn't  indeed wholly understand; but many things he knew which the writer  of the account in the Times knew not. He knew that Nevitt was a  clerk in the bank where he himself kept his account, and to which  he had given orders to pay in the six thousand to Cyril's credit,  at Cyril's bankers. He knew, therefore, that Nevitt might thus  have been led to suspect the real truth of the case as to the two  so-called Warings. He knew that Cyril had just received the six  thousand. Trying to put these facts together and understand their  meaning he utterly failed; but this much at least was clear to him,  he thought--the reason for the murder was something connected with  a search for the entry of his own clandestine marriage.    
He looked down at the paper again. Great heavens, what was this?  "It is rumoured that a further inducement to the crime may perhaps  be sought in the fact that the deceased gentleman had a large sum  of money in his possession in Bank of England notes at the time  of his death. These notes he carried in a pocket-book about his  person, where they were seen by the landlord of the Talbot Arms at  Mambury, the night before the supposed murder. When the body was  discovered by the side of the brook, two days later, the notes were  gone. The pockets were carefully searched by order of the police,  but no trace of the missing money could be discovered. It is now  conjectured that Mr. Guy Waring, who is known to have lost heavily  in the Rio Negro Diamond Mines, may have committed the crime from  purely pecuniary motives, in order to release himself from his  considerable and very pressing financial embarrassments."    
The paper dropped from Colonel Kelmscott's hands. His eyes ceased  to see. His arm fell rigid. This last horrible suggestion proved  too much for him to bear. He shrank from it like poison. That  a son of his own, unacknowledged or not, should be a criminal--a  murderer--was terrible enough; but that he should even be suspected  of having committed murder for such base and vulgar motives as mere  thirst of gain was more than the blood of the Kelmscotts could put  up with. The unhappy father had said to himself in his agony at  first that if Guy really killed that prying bank clerk at all, it  was no doubt in defence of his mother's honour. <i>That</i> was a reason a  Kelmscott could understand. That, if not an excuse, was at least  a palliation. But to be told he had killed him for a roll of  bank-notes--oh, horrible, incredible; his reason drew back at it.  That was a depth to which the Kelmscott idiosyncrasy could never  descend. The Colonel in his horror refused to believe it.    
He put his hands up feebly to his throbbing brow. This was a ghastly  idea--a ghastly accusation. The man called Waring had dragged the  honour of the Kelmscotts through the mud of the street. There was  but one comfort left. He never bore that unsullied name. Nobody  would know he was a Kelmscott of Tilgate.    
The Colonel rose from his seat, and staggered across the floor.  Half-way to the door, he reeled and stopped short. The veins of his  forehead were black and swollen. He had the same strange feeling  in his head as he experienced on the day when Granville left--only  a hundred times worse. The two halves of his brain were opening  and shutting. His temples seemed too full; he fancied there was  something wrong with his forehead somewhere. He reeled once more,  like a drunken man. Then he clutched at a chair and sat down. His  brain was flooded.    
He collapsed all at once, mumbling to himself some inarticulate  gibberish. Half an hour later, the servants came in and found him.  He was seated in his chair, still doddering feebly. The house was  roused. A doctor was summoned, and the Colonel put to bed. Lady  Emily watched him with devoted care. But it was all in vain. The  doctor shook his head the moment he examined him. "A paralytic  stroke," he said gravely; "and a very serious one. He seems to have  had a slighter attack some time since, and to have wholly neglected  it. A great blood-vessel in the brain must have given way with a  rush. I can hold out no hope. He won't live till morning."    
And indeed, as it turned out, about ten that night the Colonel's  loud and stentorious breathing began to fail slowly. The intervals  grew longer and longer between each recurrent gasp, and life died  away at last in imperceptible struggles.    
By two in the morning, Kelmscott of Tilgate lay dead on his bed;  and his two unacknowledged and unrecognised sons were the masters  of his property.    
But one of them was at that moment being tossed about wildly on the  waves of Biscay; and the other was locked up on a charge of murder  in the county jail at Tavistock, in Devonshire.    
Meanwhile, at the other house at Chetwood, where these tidings were  being read with almost equal interest, Elma Clifford laid down the  paper on the table with a very pale face, and looked at her mother.  Mrs. Clifford, all solicitous watchfulness for the effect on Elma,  looked in return with searching eyes at her daughter. Then Elma  opened her lips like one who talks in her sleep, and spoke out  twice in two short disconnected sentences. The first time she  said simply, "He didn't do it, I know," and the second time, with  all the intensity of her emotional nature, "Mother, mother, whatever  turns up, I <i>must</i> go there."    
"<i>He</i> will be there," Mrs. Clifford interposed, after a painful pause.    
And Elma answered dreamily, with her great eyes far away, "Yes, of  course, I know he will. And I must be there too, to see how far,  if at all, I can help them."    
"Yes, darling," her mother replied, stroking her daughter's hair  with a caressing hand. She knew that when Elma spoke in a tone like  that, no power on earth could possibly restrain her.
