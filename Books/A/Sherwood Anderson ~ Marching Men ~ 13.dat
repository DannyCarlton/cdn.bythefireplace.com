Beaut McGregor went home to Pennsylvania to bury his mother and on a  summer afternoon walked again on the streets of his native town. From  the station he went at once to the empty bake-shop, above which he had  lived with his mother but he did not stay there. For a moment he stood  bag in hand listening to the voices of the miners' wives in the room  above and then put the bag behind an empty box and hurried away. The  voices of women broke the stillness of the room in which he stood.  Their thin sharpness hurt something within him and he could not bear  the thought of the equally thin sharp silence he knew would fall upon  the women who were attending his mother's body in the room above when  he came into the presence of the dead.    
Along Main Street he went to a hardware store and from there went to  the mine office. Then with a pick and shovel on his shoulder he began  to climb the hill up which he had walked with his father when he was a  lad. On the train homeward bound an idea had come to him. "I will her  among the bushes on the hillside that looks down into the fruitful  valley," he told himself. The details of a religious discussion  between two labourers that had gone on one day during the noon hour at  the warehouse had come into his mind and as the train ran eastward he  for the first time found himself speculating on the possibility of a  life after death. Then he brushed the thoughts aside. "Anyway if  Cracked McGregor does come back it is there you will find him, sitting  on the log on the hillside," he thought.    
With the tools on his shoulder McGregor climbed the long hillside  road, now deep with black dust. He was going to dig the grave for the  burial of Nance McGregor. He did not glare at the miners who passed  swinging their dinner-pails as they had done in the old days but  looked at the ground and thought of the dead woman and a little  wondered what place a woman would yet come to occupy in his own life.  On the hillside the wind blew sharply and the great boy just emerging  into manhood worked vigorously making the dirt fly. When the hole had  grown deep he stopped and looked to where in the valley below a man  who was hoeing corn shouted to a woman who stood on the porch of a  farm house. Two cows that stood by a fence in a field lifted up their  heads and bawled lustily. "It is the place for the dead to lie,"  whispered McGregor. "When my own time comes I shall be brought up  here." An idea came to him. "I will have father's body moved," he told  himself. "When I have made some money I will have that done. Here we  shall all lie in the end, all of us McGregors."    
The thought that had come to McGregor pleased him and he was pleased  also with himself for thinking the thought. The male in him made him  throw back his shoulders. "We are two of a feather, father and me," he  muttered, "two of a feather and mother has not understood either of  us. Perhaps no woman was ever intended to understand us."    
Jumping out of the hole he strode over the crest of the hill and began  the descent toward the town. It was late afternoon and the sun had  gone down behind clouds. "I wonder if I understand myself, if any one  understands," he thought as he went swiftly along with the tools  clanking on his shoulder.    
McGregor did not want to go back to the town and to the dead woman in  the little room. He thought of the miners' wives, attendants to the  dead, who would sit with crossed hands looking at him and turned out  of the road to sit on the fallen log where once on a Sunday afternoon  he had sat with the black-haired boy who worked in the poolroom and  where the daughter of the undertaker had come to sit beside him.    
And then up the long hill came the woman herself. As she drew near he  recognised her tall figure and for some reason a lump came into his  throat She had seen him depart from the town with the pick and shovel  on his shoulder and after waiting what she thought an interval long  enough to still the tongues of gossip had followed. "I wanted to talk  with you," she said, climbing over logs and coming to sit beside him.    
For a long time the man and woman sat in silence and stared at the  town in the valley below. McGregor thought she had grown more pale  than ever and looked at her sharply. His mind, more accustomed to look  critically at women than had been the mind of the boy who had once sat  talking to her on the same log, began to inventory her body. "She is  already becoming stooped," he thought. "I would not want to make love  to her now."    
Along the log toward him moved the undertaker's daughter and with a  swift impulse toward boldness slipped a thin hand into his. She began  to talk of the dead woman lying in the upstairs room in the town. "We  have been friends since you went away," she explained. "She liked to  talk of you and I liked that too."    
Made bold by her own boldness the woman hurried on. "I do not want you  to misunderstand me," she said. "I know I can't get you. I'm not  thinking of that."    
She began to talk of her own affairs and of the dreariness of life  with her father but McGregor's mind could not centre itself on her  talk. When they started down the hill he had the impulse to take her  in his arms and carry her as Cracked McGregor had once carried him but  was so embarrassed that he did not offer to help her. He thought that  for the first time some one from his native town had come close to him  and he watched her stooped figure with an odd new feeling of  tenderness. "I won't be alive long, maybe not a year. I've got the  consumption," she whispered softly as he left her at the entrance to  the hallway leading up to her home, and McGregor was so stirred by her  words that he turned back and spent another hour wandering alone on  the hillside before he went to see the body of his mother.

In the room above the bakery McGregor sat at an open window and looked  down into the dimly lighted street. In a corner of the room lay his  mother in a coffin and two miners' wives sat in the darkness behind  him. All were silent and embarrassed.    
McGregor leaned out of the window and watched a group of miners who  gathered at a corner. He thought of the undertaker's daughter, now  nearing death, and wondered why she had suddenly come so close to him.  "It is not because she is a woman, I know that," he told himself and  tried to dismiss the matter from his mind by watching the people in  the street below.    
In the mining town a meeting was being held. A box lay at the edge of  the sidewalk and upon it climbed that same young Hartnet who had once  talked to McGregor and who made his living by gathering birds' eggs  and trapping squirrels in the hills. He was frightened and talked  rapidly. Presently he introduced a large man with a flat nose who,  when he had in turn climbed upon the box, began to tell stories and  anecdotes designed to make the miners laugh.    
McGregor listened. He wished the undertaker's daughter were there to  sit in the darkened room beside him. He thought he would like to tell  her of his life in the city and of how disorganised and ineffective  all modern life seemed to him. Sadness invaded his mind and he thought  of his dead mother and of how this other woman would presently die.  "It's just as well. Perhaps there is no other way, no orderly march  toward an orderly end. Perhaps one has to die and return to nature to  achieve that," he whispered to himself.    
In the street below the man upon the box, who was a travelling  socialist orator, began to talk of the coming social revolution. As he  talked it seemed to McGregor that his jaw had become loose from much  wagging and that his whole body was loosely put together and without  force. The speaker danced up and down on the box and his arms flapped  about and these also seemed loose, not a part of the body.    
"Vote with us and the thing is done," he shouted. "Are you going to  let a few men run things forever? Here you live like beasts paying  tribute to your masters. Arouse yourselves. Join us in the struggle.  You yourselves can be masters if you will only think so."    
"You will have to do something more than think," roared McGregor, as  he leaned far out at the window. Again as always when he had heard men  saying words he was blind with anger. Sharply he remembered the walks  he had sometimes taken at night in the city streets and the air of  disorderly ineffectiveness all about him. And here in the mining town  it was the same. On every side of him appeared blank empty faces and  loose badly knit bodies.    
"Mankind should be like a great fist ready to smash and to strike. It  should be ready to knock down what stands in its way," he cried,  astonishing the crowd in the street and frightening into something  like hysterics the two women who sat with him beside the dead woman in  the darkened room.
