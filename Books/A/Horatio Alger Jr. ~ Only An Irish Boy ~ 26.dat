  There was a short interval before the play commenced. This Andy  improved by examining the large stock of curiosities which have been  gathered from all parts of the world for the gratification of visitors.  Fairfax kept at his side, and spoke freely of all they saw. There was  something about him which seemed to Andy strangely familiar. Was it in  his features, or in his voice? He could not tell. The red whig and  whiskers misled him. Andy finally set it down as a mere chance  resemblance to someone whom he had met formerly, and dismissed it from  his mind.
  At length the increasing crowds pouring into the lecture-room  reminded them that the play was about to begin.
  &#8220;Shall we go in and take our seats?&#8221; said Fairfax.
  Andy assented, and they were speedily in their seats.
  I do not propose to speak of the play. It was a novelty to Andy to  see a dramatic representation, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Fairfax  was more accustomed to such things, but pretended to be equally  interested, feeling that in this way he could ingratiate himself better  into Andy's confidence.
  At last it was over, and they went out of the building.
  &#8220;How did you like it?&#8221; asked Fairfax.
  &#8220;Tiptop,&#8221; said Andy, promptly. &#8220;Don't you think so?&#8221;
  &#8220;Capital,&#8221; answered Fairfax, with simulated delight. &#8220;I am glad I  had company. I don't enjoy anything half as well alone. By the way,  where do you pass the night?&#8221;
  &#8220;At some hotel&#8212;I don't know which.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you go to the Adams House. I've got to stop overnight  somewhere, and it might be pleasanter going in company.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where is the Adams House?&#8221;
  &#8220;On Washington Street, not very far off&#8212;ten or fifteen minutes'  walk.&#8221;
  &#8220;If it's a good place, I'm willing.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is an excellent hotel, and moderate in price. We might go up  there now, and engage a room, and then spend the evening where we  like.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Andy.
  They soon reached the Adams House&#8212;a neat, unpretending hotel&#8212;and  entered. They walked up to the desk, and Fairfax spoke to the clerk.
  &#8220;Can you give us a room?&#8221;
  &#8220;Certainly. Enter your names.&#8221;
  &#8220;Shall we room together?&#8221; asked Fairfax, calmly.
  Now Andy, though he had had no objection to going to the theater  with his present companion, did not care to take a room with a  stranger, of whom he knew nothing. He might be a very respectable man,  but somehow, Andy did not know why, there was something in his manner  which inspired a little repulsion. Besides, he remembered that he had  considerable money with him, and that consideration alone rendered it  imprudent for him to put himself in the power of a companion. So he  said, a little awkwardly:
  &#8220;I think we'd better take separate rooms.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Fairfax, in a tone of indifference, though he  really felt very much disappointed. &#8220;I thought it might have been a  little more sociable to be together.&#8221;
  Andy did not take the hint, except so far as to say:
  &#8220;We can take rooms alongside of each other.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can give you adjoining rooms, if you desire,&#8221; said the clerk.
  Fairfax here entered his name in the hotel register as &#8220;Nathaniel  Marvin, Portland, Maine,&#8221; while Andy put down his real address. His  companion's was, of course, fictitious. He did not venture to give the  name of Fairfax, as that might be recognized by Andy as that of the  highwayman, with whose little plans he had interfered.
  A servant was called, and they went up to their rooms, which, as the  clerk had promised, were found to be adjoining. They were precisely  alike.
  &#8220;Very comfortable, Mr. Burke,&#8221; said Fairfax, in a tone of apparent  satisfaction. &#8220;I think we shall have a comfortable night.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess so,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;Are you going to stay here now?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I'm going to wash my face, and then take a walk around. I want  to see something of the city.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I'll lie down awhile; I feel tired. Perhaps we shall meet  later. If not, I shall see you in the morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right,&#8221; said Andy.
  In a few minutes he went out.
