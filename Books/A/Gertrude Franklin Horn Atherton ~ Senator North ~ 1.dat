"If we receive this Lady Mary Montgomery, we shall also have to  receive her dreadful husband."    
"He is said to be quite charming."    
"He is a Representative!"    
"Of course they are all wild animals to you, but one or two have been  pointed out to me that looked quite like ordinary gentlemen--really."    
"Possibly. But no person in official life has ever entered my house. I  do not feel inclined to break the rule merely because the wife of one  of the most objectionable class is an Englishwoman with a title. I  think it very inconsiderate of Lady Barnstaple to have given her a  letter to us."    
"Lee, never having lived in Washington, doubtless fancies, like the  rest of the benighted world, that its officials are its aristocracy.  The Senate of the United States is regarded abroad as a sort of House  of Peers. One has to come and live in Washington to hear of the 'Old  Washingtonians,' the 'cave-dwellers,' as Sally calls us; I expected to  see a coat of blue mould on each of them when I returned."    
"Really, Betty, I do not understand you this morning." Mrs. Madison  moved uneasily and took out her handkerchief. When her daughter's rich  Southern voice hardened itself to sarcasm, and her brilliant hazel  eyes expressed the brain in a state of cold analysis, Mrs. Madison  braced herself for a contest in which she inevitably must surrender  with what slow dignity she could command. Betty had called her Molly  since she was fourteen months old, and, sweet and gracious in small  matters, invariably pursued her own way when sufficiently roused by  the strength of a desire. Mrs. Madison, however, kept up the fiction  of an authority which she thought was due to herself and her  ancestors. She continued impatiently,--    
"You have been standing before that fireplace for ten minutes with  your shoulders thrown back as if you were going to make a speech. It  is not a nice attitude for a girl at all, and I wish you would sit  down. I hope you don't think that because Sally Carter crosses her  knees and cultivates a brutal frankness of expression you must do the  same now that you have dropped all your friends of your own age and  become intimate with her. I suppose she is old enough to do as she  chooses, and she always was eccentric."    
"She is only eight years older than I. You forget that I shall be  twenty-seven in three months."    
"Well, that is no reason why you should stand before the fireplace  like a man. Do sit down."    
"I'd rather stand here till I've said what is necessary--if you don't  mind. I am sorry to be obliged to say it, and I can assure you that I  have not made up my mind in a moment."    
"What is it, for heaven's sake?"    
Mrs. Madison drew a short breath and readjusted her cushions. In spite  of her wealth and exalted position she had known much trouble and  grief. Her first six children had died in their early youth. Her  husband, brilliant and charming, had possessed a set of affections too  restless and ardent to confine themselves within the domestic limits.  His wife had buried him with sorrow, but with a deep sigh of relief  that for the future she could mourn him without torment. He had  belonged to a collateral branch of a family of which her father had  been the heir; consequently the old Madison house in Washington was  hers, as well as a large fortune. Harold Madison had been free to  spend his own inheritance as he listed, and he had left but a  fragment. Mrs. Madison's nerves, never strong, had long since given  way to trouble and ill-health, and when her active strong-willed  daughter entered her twentieth year, she gladly permitted her to  become the mistress of the household and to think for both. Betty had  been educated by private tutors, then taken abroad for two years, to  France, Germany, and Italy, in order, as she subsequently observed, to  make the foreign attache. Feel more at ease when he proposed. Her  winters thereafter until the last two had been spent in Washington,  where she had been a belle and ranked as a beauty. In the fashionable  set it was believed that every attache, in the city had proposed to  her, as well as a large proportion of the old beaux and of the youths  who pursue the business of Society. Her summers she spent at her place  in the Adirondacks, at Northern watering-places, or in Europe; and the  last two years had been passed, with brief intervals of Paris and  Vienna, in England, where she had been presented with distinction and  seen much of country life. She had returned with her mother to  Washington but a month ago, and since then had spent most of her  time in her room or on horseback, breaking all her engagements after  the first ten days. Mrs. Madison had awaited the explanation with deep  uneasiness. Did her daughter, despite the health manifest in her  splendid young figure, feel the first chill of some mortal disease?  She had not been her gay self for months, and although her complexion  was of that magnolia tint which never harbours colour, it seemed to  the anxious maternal eye, looking back to six young graves, a shade  whiter than it should. Or had she fallen in love with an Englishman,  and hesitated to speak, knowing her mother's love for Washington and  bare tolerance of the British Isles? She looked askance at Betty, who  stood tapping the front of her habit with her crop and evidently  waiting for her mother to express some interest. Mrs. Madison closed  her eyes. Betty therefore continued,--    
"I see you are afraid I am going to marry an Oriental minister or  something. I hear that one is looking for an American with a million.  Well, I am going to do something you will think even worse. I am going  in for politics."    
"You are going to do what?" Mrs. Madison's voice was nearly inaudible  between relief and horrified surprise, but her eyes flew open. "Do you  mean that you are going to vote?--or run for Congress?--but women  don't sit in Congress, do they?"    
"Of course not. Do you know I think it quite shocking that we have  lived here in the very brain of the United States all our lives and  know less of politics than if we were Indians in Alaska? I was ashamed  of myself, I can assure you, when Lord Barnstaple asked me so many  questions the first time I visited Maundrell Abbey. He took for  granted, as I lived in Washington, I must be thoroughly well up in  politics, and I was obliged to tell him that although I had  occasionally been in the room with one or two Senators and Cabinet  Ministers, who happened to be in Society first and politics afterward,  I didn't know the others by name, had never put my foot in the White  House or the Capitol, and that no one I knew ever thought of talking  politics. He asked me what I had done with myself during all the  winters I had spent in Washington, and I told him that I had had the  usual girls'-good-time,--teas, theatre, Germans, dinners, luncheons,  calls, calls, calls! I was glad to add that I belonged to several  charities and had read a great deal; but that did not seem to interest  him. Well, I met a good many men like Lord Barnstaple, men who were in  public life. Some of them were dull enough, judged by the feminine  standard, but even they occasionally said something to remember, and  others were delightful. This is the whole point--I can't and won't go  back to what I left here two years ago. My day for platitudes and  pouring tea for men, who are contemptible enough to make Society their  profession, is over. I am going to know the real men of my country. It  is incredible that there are not men in that Senate as well worth  talking to as any I met in England. The other day I picked up a bound  copy of the Congressional Record in a book-shop. It was frantically  interesting."    
"It must have been! But, my dear--of course I understand, darling,  your desire for a new intellectual occupation; you always were so  clever--but you can't, you really can't know these men. They are--they  are--politicians. We never have known politicians. They are dreadful  people, who have come from low origins and would probably call me  'marm.'"    
"You are all wrong, Molly. I bought a copy of the Congressional  Directory a day or two ago, and have read the biography of every  Senator. Nine-tenths of them are educated men; if only a few attended  the big Universities, the rest went to the colleges of their State.  That is enough for an American of brains. And most of them are  lawyers; others served in the war, and several have distinguished  records. They cannot be boors, whether they have blue blood in them or  not. I'm sick of blue blood, anyway. Vienna was the deadliest place I  ever visited. What makes London interesting is its red streak of  plebeianism;--well, I repeat, I think it really dreadful that we  should not know even by name the men who make our laws, who are making  history, who may be called upon at any moment to decide our fate among  nations. I feel a silly little fool."    
"I suppose you mean that I am one too. But it always has been my  boast, Betty, that I never have had a politician in my house. Your  father knew some, but he never brought them here; he knew the  fastidious manner in which I had been brought up; and although I am  afraid he kept late hours with a good many of them at Chamberlin's and  other dreadful places, he always spared me. I suppose this is heredity  working out in you."    
"Possibly. But you will admit, will you not, that I am old enough to  choose my own life?"    
"You always have done every single thing you wanted, so I don't see  why you talk like that. But if you are going to bring a lot of men to  this house who will spit on my carpets and use toothpicks, I beg you  will not ask me to receive with you." "Of course you will receive with  me, Molly dear--when I know anybody worth receiving. Unfortunately I  am not the wife of the President and cannot send out a royal summons.  I am hoping that Lady Mary Montgomery will help me. But my first step  shall be to pay a daily visit to the Senate Gallery."    
"What!" Mrs. Madison's weary voice flew to its upper register. "I  <i>do</i> know something about politics--I remember now--the only women who  go to the Capitol are lobbyists--dreadful creatures who--who--do all  sorts of things. You can't go there; you'll be taken for one."    
"We none of us are taken very long for what we are not. I shall take  Leontine with me, and those interested enough to notice me will soon  learn what I go for."    
Mrs. Madison burst into tears. "You are your father all over again!  I've seen it developing for at least three years. At first you were  just a hard student, and then the loveliest young girl, only caring to  have a good time, and coquetting more bewitchingly than any girl I  ever saw. I don't see why you had to change."    
"Time develops all of us, one way or another. I suppose you would like  me to be a charming girl flirting bewitchingly when I am forty-five. I  am finished with the meaningless things of life. I want to live now,  and I intend to."    
"It will be wildly exciting--the Senate Gallery every day, and knowing  a lot of lank raw-boned Yankees with political beards." "I am not  expecting to fall in love with any of them. I merely discovered some  time since that I had a brain, and they happen to be the impulse that  possesses it. You always have prided yourself that I am intellectual,  and so I am in the flabby 'well-read' fashion. I feel as if my brain  had been a mausoleum for skeletons and mummies; it felt alive for the  first time when I began to read the newspapers in England. I want no  more memoirs and letters and biographies, nor even of the history that  is shut up in calf-skin. I want the life of to-day. I want to feel in  the midst of current history. All these men here in Washington must be  alive to their finger-tips. Sally Carter admires Senator North and  Senator Maxwell immensely."    
"What does she say about politicians in general?" Mrs. Madison looked  almost distraught. "Of course the Norths and the Maxwells come of good  New England families--I never did look down on the North as much as  some of us did; after all, nearly three hundred years are very  respectable indeed--and if these two men had not been in politics I  should have been delighted to receive them. I met Senator North once--  at Bar Harbor, while you were with the Carters at Homburg--and thought  him charming; and I had some most interesting chats with his wife,  who is much the same sort of invalid that I am. But when I establish a  standard I am consistent enough to want to keep to it. I asked you  what Sally Carter says of the others."    
"Oh, she admits that there may be others as <i>convenable</i> as Senator  North and Senator Maxwell, and that there is no doubt about there  being many bright men in the Senate; but she 'does not care to know  any more people.' Being a good cave-dweller, she is true to her  traditions."    
"People will say you are <i>passee,</i>" exclaimed Mrs. Madison, hopefully.  "They will be sure to."    
Her daughter laughed, showing teeth as brilliant as her eyes. Then she  snatched off her riding-hat and shook down her mane of warm brown  hair. Her black brows and lashes, like her eyes and mouth, were vivid,  but her hair and complexion were soft, without lustre, but very warm.  She looked like a flower set on so strongly sapped a stem that her  fullness would outlast many women's decline. She had inherited the  beauty of her father's branch of the family. Mrs. Madison was very  small and thin; but she carried herself erectly and her delicately cut  face was little wrinkled. Her eyes were blue, and her hair, which was  always carefully rolled, was as white as sea foam. Betty would not  permit her to wear black, but dressed her in delicate colours, and she  looked somewhat like an animated miniature. She dabbed impatiently at  her tears.    
"Everybody will cut you--if you go into that dreadful political set."    
"I am on the verge of cutting everybody myself, so it doesn't matter.  Positively--I shall not accept an invitation of the old sort this  winter. The sooner they drop me the better."    
Mrs. Madison wept bitterly. "You will become a notorious woman," she  sobbed. "People will talk terribly about you. They will say--all sorts  of things I have heard come back to me--these politicians make love to  every pretty woman they meet. They are so tired of their old frumps  from Oshkosh and Kalamazoo." "They do not all come from Oshkosh and  Kalamazoo. There are six New England States whose three centuries you  have just admitted lift them into the mists of antiquity. There are  fourteen Southern States, and I need make no defence--"    
"Their gentlemen don't go into politics any more."    
"You have admitted that Senator North and Senator Maxwell are  gentlemen. There is no reason why there should not be many more."    
"Count de Bellairs told me that there was a spittoon at every desk in  the Senate and that he counted eight toothpicks in one hour."    
"Well, I'll reform them. That will be my holy mission. As for  spittoons and toothpicks, they are conspicuous in every hotel in the  United States. They should be on our coat-of-arms, and the Great  American Novel will be called 'The Great American Toothpick.'  Statesmen have cut their teeth on it, and it has been their solace in  the great crises of the nation's history. As for spittoons, they  were invented for our own Southern aristocrats who loved tobacco then  as now. They decorate our Capitol as a mere matter of form. I don't  pretend to hope that ninety representative Americans are Beau  Brummels, but there must be a respectable minority of gentlemen--  whether self-made or not I don't care. I am going to make a deliberate  attempt to know that minority, and shall call on Lady Mary Montgomery  this afternoon as the first step. So you are resigned, are you not,  Molly dear?"    
"No, I am not! But what can I do? I have spoiled you, and you would be  just the same if I hadn't. You are more like the men of the family  than the women--they always would have their own way. Are they all  married?" she added anxiously.    
"Do you mean the ninety Senators and the three hundred and fifty-six  Representatives? I am sure I do not know. Don't let that worry you. It  is my mind that is on the <i>qui vive</i>, not my heart."    
"You'll hear some old fool make a Websterian speech full of periods  and rhetoric, and you'll straight-way imagine yourself in love with  him. Your head will be your worst enemy when you do fall in love."    
"Webster is the greatest master of style this country has produced. I  should hate a man who used either 'periods' or rhetoric. I am the  concentrated essence of modernism and have no use for 'oratory' or  'eloquence.' Some of the little speeches in the Record are  masterpieces of brevity and pure English, particularly Senator  North's."    
"You <i>are</i> modern. If we had a Clay, I could understand you--I am  too exhausted to discuss the matter further; you <i>must</i> drop it  for the present. What will Jack Emory say?"    
"I have never given him the least right to say anything."    
"I almost wish you were safely married to him. He has not made a great  success of his life, but he is your equal and his manners are perfect.  I shall live in constant fear now of your marrying a horror with a  twang and a toothpick."    
"I promise you I won't do that--and that I never will marry Jack  Emory."
