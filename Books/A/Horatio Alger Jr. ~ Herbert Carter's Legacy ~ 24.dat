  &#8220;This is my son, James, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said the squire, as the young   gentleman came in to supper a little late. 
  &#8220;Indeed! How old are you, James?&#8221; 
  James took in at a glance the visitor's appearance, which did not  give  the impression of prosperity, and answered, with haughty   condescension: &#8220;I am almost sixteen.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I congratulate you, Mr. Leech,&#8221; said Temple. &#8220;I am not blessed  with a  son. I would gladly give twenty thousand dollars could I have a  son of  your boy's age.&#8221; 
  James pricked up his ears. Temple spoke as if he had the twenty   thousand dollars to give. He must be a man of property and so entitled   to respect. 
  &#8220;What are you going to do with your boy?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have not decided. Perhaps he may go to college.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think I shall be a lawyer,&#8221; said James. 
  &#8220;A good profession. Some of our New York lawyers make great  incomes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you live in New York?&#8221; asked James. 
  &#8220;Yes; that is my residence. You must establish yourself in the city   when you are ready to practice.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is just what I want to do; I don't want to bury myself in a  one-horse country town like this.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And be a one-horse lawyer,&#8221; suggested Temple, laughing. &#8220;Quite  right,  my young friend. In the city alone you will find a broad field  of  action.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's just the way I think,&#8221; said James. 
  &#8220;I needn't say I would do all in my power to push you, and I  flatter  myself I have some influence.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are very kind, Mr. Temple,&#8221; said Mrs. Leech; &#8220;but I hoped that   James could still continue to live with us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You can't expect me to live at home all my life,&#8221; said James,   impatiently. 
  &#8220;Perhaps your husband may be persuaded himself to remove to the  city,&#8221;  said Temple. &#8220;I really think he stands in his own light in  staying in  a small place like this.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Just so,&#8221; said James, who would have liked nothing better than to   live in New York. &#8220;There is no society here. I have no boys to   associate with in my own position. Why won't you move to New York,   father?&#8221; 
  &#8220;That requires consideration,&#8221; said Squire Leech. 
  &#8220;I should like to talk with you on that subject after supper,&#8221; said   Temple. &#8220;Mrs. Leech, may I ask for another cup of tea?&#8221; 
  When supper was over Squire Leech led the way into the sitting  room,  and his guest followed. The vista of future wealth which his  visitor  had opened to him had not been without its effect and he began  to make  inquiries. 
  &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are ways of investing money to good   advantage in New York?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Most certainly&#8212;many ways.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Real estate?&#8221; 
  &#8220;That may do, but it is too slow for me. I owned a house uptown. I   sold for thirty thousand dollars. In six weeks I made twenty thousand   more out of it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; ejaculated the squire. &#8220;Twenty thousand, did you   say?&#8221; 
  &#8220;To be sure. Of course that was extra good luck. You can't expect  to  do as well often, but there are always ways of turning over  capital.&#8221; 
  &#8220;May I ask in what way you made this large sum?&#8221; 
  &#8220;To be sure. I speculated in Erie. It is all the time fluctuating.  I  became convinced that it was on the rise. I went in and the event   justified my action.&#8221; 
  Temple spoke quietly, as if it were no great matter, after all. His   host was very much impressed, and felt like a man who has discovered a   gold mine. He had succeeded in saving up about two thousand dollars a   year for some years; but what was that to twenty thousand dollars made   in six weeks? Still, prudence led him to suggest: &#8220;But isn't there   danger of losing heavily?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not if you are acquainted with the stock market. It is the   ignoramuses that get bit.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know very little of the stock market myself,&#8221; confessed Squire   Leech. &#8220;I own some bank stocks.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No money to be made in bank stocks.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They pay good dividends.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No doubt; but there is little or no variation in value. It's   fluctuation that gives a man a chance.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should be as likely to lose as gain, knowing as little as I do  of  the market.&#8221; 
  &#8220;True; but I should be happy to place my knowledge at your  disposal.  As an old friend and schoolmate I naturally feel interested  in your  prosperity.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are very kind,&#8221; said the squire; &#8220;but wouldn't it be too much   trouble?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not at all. In fact, it's my business, and wouldn't inconvenience  me  in the least. By the way, how is your property invested?&#8221; asked   Temple, carelessly. 
  &#8220;Mostly in real estate.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It must pay you very little.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is true. After deducting taxes and repairs, there is very  little  left.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I supposed. It would pay you to mortgage your property, or sell   it, and use the money in Wall Street.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have about twenty thousand dollars in bank stock.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That could readily be sold.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What investments would you suggest?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I couldn't tell you on the moment; but I think favorably of a  mining  stock lately put on the market. I have private advices that it  is  likely to develop extraordinary richness and the stock may even  treble  in three months.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Where is the mine?&#8221; asked the squire, eagerly. 
  &#8220;Out in Nevada. A friend of mine has just returned from there and  he  has given me strictly confidential information in regard to it. He  has  so much faith in it that he has bought fifteen thousand dollars'  worth  of shares.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Could I get any?&#8221; asked Squire Leech. 
  &#8220;I think you could if you go to work quietly. If you went into the   market openly, they would suspect something and raise the price on   you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, I see. Do you think that is better than Erie?&#8221; 
  &#8220;At present, nothing is to be made in Erie. It is likely to go down   before it goes up. The time may come when you can buy to advantage but   not now.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have a great mind to go up to the city with you, and investigate   the matter,&#8221; said the squire. 
  &#8220;Do so, by all means. I shall be delighted, and will cheerfully  render  you all the assistance in my power. But, my friend, let me give  you  one piece of advice.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Say as little as possible to your wife on the subject. Women don't   understand business. They are frightened at risks and don't understand   speculation.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think you are correct,&#8221; said his host. &#8220;Men must judge for   themselves. It is a weak man who would be guided by his wife.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I say. Why, my wife happened to learn that I had gone into Erie  on  the occasion I mentioned. She remonstrated in great alarm; but when  I  announced that I had cleared twenty thousand dollars, she had no  more  to say.&#8221; 
  The next day they went to New York together and within a week the   squire had bought largely in the Nevada mine. He subscribed to a   financial paper, and was fully embarked on the dangerous sea of   speculation.
