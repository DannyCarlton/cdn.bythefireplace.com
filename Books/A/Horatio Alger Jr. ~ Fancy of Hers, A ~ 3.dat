  The Granville schoolhouse was not far from the center of the  village. It was wholly without architectural ornament. The people of  Granville, it must be admitted, were severely practical, and were not  willing to spend a dollar in the interest of beauty. Their money was  the result of hard labor, and frugality was not to be wondered at. In a  commercial community architecture receives more attention. 
  The schoolhouse was two stories in height, and contained two  schools. The primary school, for children under eight, was kept in the  lower room. The grammar school, for more advanced scholars, which Mabel  Frost had undertaken to teach, occupied the upper portion of the  building. 
  As Mabel approached the schoolhouse, escorted by Squire Hadley, she  noticed, a few rods in advance, a tall, slender woman, with long  ringlets falling over a pair of narrow shoulders. 
  &quot;That lady is your colleague, Miss Frost,&quot; said the Squire. 
  &quot;My colleague?&quot; repeated Mabel, in a tone of inquiry. 
  &quot;Yes; she keeps the primary school.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed! Then there is another school besides mine!&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure. Miss Clarissa Bassett teaches the youngest children.&quot; 
  &quot;Is she &#151; does she live here?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; she has taught the same school for fifteen years. All your  scholars began with her.&quot; 
  &quot;Then she isn't a very young lady?&quot; 
  &quot;Clarissa,&quot; replied the Squire, with that familiarity which is  common in small villages, &quot;must be thirty five, though she only owns up  to twenty five,&quot; added he, chuckling. &quot;Might spile her matrimonial  prospects if she confessed her real age.&quot; 
  &quot;Fifteen years a teacher!&quot; said Mabel enthusiastically. &quot;Miss  Bassett ought to feel proud of such a term of service. How much good  she has done!&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I dunno,&quot; said Squire Hadley, whose practical mind conceived  of no other motive for teaching than the emolument to be derived from  it. &quot;Clarissa wanted to teach the grammar school &#151; the same that  you're a goin' to teach; but we didn't think she was qualified to teach  advanced scholars.&quot; 
  &quot;And you preferred me before a teacher of fifteen years'  experience!&quot;  said Mabel, with unaffected humility. &quot;I am afraid,  Squire Hadley, you will find that you have made a mistake.&quot; 
  &quot;You are a better scholar than Clarissa, Miss Frost. She knows  enough to teach the little ones, but &#151; &#151; &quot; 
  &quot;She has fifteen years' experience, and I have none,&quot; interrupted  Mabel. 
  &quot;You wouldn't be willing to change schools with her?&quot; suggested the  Squire, with mild satire. 
  &quot;Yes, I would,&quot; said Mabel promptly. 
  &quot;She don't get but six dollars a week &#151; a dollar less than you.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't care for that.&quot; 
  &quot;The deestrict wouldn't be satisfied,&quot; said the Squire, in a  decided tone. Mabel was an enigma to him. &quot;They wouldn't be willing to  have Clarissa teach the older pupils,&quot; he repeated. 
  By this time they had reached the schoolhouse. Some twenty pupils  were outside, most of them Mabel's future scholars. Miss Bassett had  paused in the entry, and awaited the arrival of Squire Hadley and her  fellow teacher. She had a thin face, and that prim expression regarded  as the typical characteristic of an old maid. It had been her lot to  see the companions of her early days sail off, one after another, on  the matrimonial sea, while she had been left neglected on the shore.  She had even seen some of her pupils &#151; mere chits, as she called them  &#151; marry, while their teacher, with all her experience of life, was  unappropriated. 
  &quot;Miss Frost,&quot; said Squire Hadley, with a wave of his hand toward  Clarissa, &quot;let me make you acquainted with Miss Bassett, who has kept  our primary school for fifteen years with general acceptance and  success.&quot; 
  &quot;You ought to be regarded as a public benefactor, Miss Bassett,&quot;  said Mabel cordially. 
  &quot;I was very young when I commenced teaching,&quot; said Miss Bassett,  rather uneasy at the allusion to her term of service. 
  &quot;I am a beginner,&quot; said Mabel. I shall be glad to have an  experienced teacher so near to me, to whom I can refer in cases of  difficulty.&quot; 
  Clarissa, who had been prejudiced against Mabel, because, although  so much younger, she had been placed over the other's head, was  flattered by this acknowledgment of inferiority. 
  &quot;I shall be very glad to give you any help in my power, Miss  Frost,&quot; she said. &quot;You will excuse me now; I must go in and look after  my young pupils.&quot; 
  Miss Frost followed Squire Hadley up stairs to the scene of her  future labors. 
  The room itself was an average country schoolroom. It had  accommodations for about fifty scholars. The desks, on the boys' side,  were covered with ink spots of all shapes and sizes, and further  decorated with an extensive series of jackknife carvings. Mabel's  neatness was rather offended by these things, which she took in in her  first general survey. It was not much like any school that she had ever  attended; but a private academy for girls differs essentially from a  country schoolroom for both sexes. 
  &quot;I see most of the scholars are here,&quot; said Squire Hadley. 
  Mabel looked around the room. Between forty and fifty scholars,  varying in age from eight to sixteen, were seated at the desks. At her  entrance, they had taken seats previously selected. For the most part  she liked their appearance. Several looked mischievous, but even they  were bright eyed and good natured. All eyes were fixed upon her. She  felt that she was being critically weighed in the balance by these  country boys and girls. 
  &quot;I wonder what are their impressions of me,&quot; she thought. &quot;I wonder  if they suspect my inexperience!&quot; 
  The children did not pronounce judgment at once. Their first  impressions were favorable. They were surprised by the sight of so  attractive a teacher. Mabel did not look like a school mistress &#151;  certainly not like Clarissa Bassett. Ben Hadley had told his friends  something of her,  and had even spoken in enthusiastic terms. 
  &quot;She's as pretty as a picture,&quot; he had told them. &quot;I bet she won't  be an old maid.&quot; 
  The boys, in particular, had their curiosity excited to see her and  judge for themselves. Now that they saw her they fully coincided with  Ben's opinion. They were still regarding their new teacher when Squire  Hadley broke the silence. 
  &quot;Scholars,&quot; he said, clearing his throat, and assuming the attitude  of an orator, &quot;I have great pleasure in introducing to you your new  teacher, Miss Frost. I have examined Miss Frost,&quot; he proceeded, in a  tone of importance, &quot;and I find that she is thoroughly competent to  lead you in the flowery paths of learning.&quot; (This was a figure on which  the Squire rather prided himself.) &quot;She comes to us highly recommended,  and I have no doubt you will all like her. As chairman of the  committee,&quot; (here the Squire's breast expanded with official pride), &quot;I  have tried to obtain for you teachers of the highest talent, without  regard to expense.&quot; (Had the Squire forgotten that Mabel was to receive  only seven dollars a week?) &quot;I trust &#151; the town trusts &#151; that you  will appreciate what we are doin' for you. We want you to attend to  your studies, and work hard to secure the blessin's of a good  education, which is the birthright of every citizen. I will now leave  you in charge of your teacher, and I hope you will study to please  her.&quot; 
  The Squire sat down, and drawing an ample red handkerchief from his  pocket wiped his brow with some complacency. He felt that his speech  was a success. He had not stumbled, as he sometimes did. He felt that  he had done credit to his position. 
  &quot;Now I must go down to Miss Bassett's school,&quot; he added, rising to  go. &quot;I must say a few words to her scholars. Miss Frost, I wish you  success in your &#151; ahem! &#151; very responsible task.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; 
  The ample form of the Squire vanished through the closing door, and  Mabel was left face to face with her new responsibilities. For a moment  she was nervous. She knew little of the routine of a country school,  and felt like a civilian who without a particle of military training  finds himself suddenly in command of a regiment. 
  &quot;I wonder what I ought to do first,&quot; she thought, in some  perplexity. She would have consulted Squire Hadley on this point had  she not hesitated to reveal her utter lack of experience. 
  While glancing about the room in an undecided way she detected Ben  Hadley slyly preparing to insert a pin into the anatomy of the boy next  him. This gave her an idea. 
  &quot;Ben Hadley, please come to the desk,&quot; she said quietly. 
  Ben started guiltily. He decided that the school teacher had seen  him, and was about to call him to account. His face wore a half defiant  look as he marched up to the desk, the observed of all observers. All  the scholars were on the qui vive to learn the policy of the new  administration. This summons seemed rather a bold move, for Ben was  generally regarded as the head of the opposition. Not from malice, but  from roguery, he gave successive teachers more trouble than any other  scholar. Had the new school mistress found this out, and was she about  to arraign the rebel as her first act of power? Such was Ben's  suspicion, as, with his head erect, he marched up to the teacher's  desk. 
  To his surprise Miss Frost met him with a friendly smile. 
  &quot;Ben,&quot; said she pleasantly, &quot;you are one of the oldest scholars,  and the only one whom I know. Are you willing to help me organize the  school?&quot; 
  Ben was, astonished. That such a proposal should be made to him,  the arch rebel, was most unexpected. 
  &quot;Guess she don't know me,&quot; he thought. But yet he felt flattered;  evidently he was a person of some consequence in the eyes of the new  teacher.  &quot;I'll help you all I can, Miss Frost,&quot; he said heartily. 
  &quot;Thank you, Ben, I felt sure you would,&quot; said Mabel, with quiet  confidence. &quot;I suppose the first thing will be to take the names of the  scholars.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, Miss Frost; and then you sort 'em into classes.&quot; 
  &quot;To be sure. How many classes are there generally?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, there are three classes in reading, and two in arithmetic,  and two in geography.&quot; 
  &quot;That is just the information I want. Now, Ben, I will ask you to  go about with me, and tell me the names of the scholars.&quot; 
  But before entering upon this formality, Mabel, for the first time  in her life, made a speech. 
  &quot;Scholars,&quot; she said, &quot;I am a stranger to you, but I hope you will  come to regard me as your friend. I am here to help you acquire an  education. I am sure you all wish to learn. There is a great  satisfaction in knowledge, and it will help you, both boys and girls,  to become useful men and women, and acquit yourselves creditably in any  positions which you may be called upon to fill. I am not so well  acquainted with the method of carrying on a country grammar school as  most of my predecessors, having myself been educated in the city. I  have, therefore, asked Ben Hadley to assist me in organizing the  school, and preparing for work.&quot; 
  The scholars received the announcement with surprise. It presented  Ben to them in a novel character. They waited with interest to see how  he would acquit himself in his new office. 
  Ben accompanied Miss Frost from desk to desk, and greatly  facilitated her task by his suggestions. At length the names of all the  scholars were taken. 
  &quot;Now I must arrange the classes,&quot; said Mabel, with increased  confidence. &quot;Have you any advice to give, Ben?&quot; 
  &quot;You'd better ask the first class to come up,&quot; suggested her young  assistant. &quot;Then you'll know exactly who belong to it.&quot; 
  &quot;That will be the best plan,&quot; said Mabel; and she followed his  advice. 
  Ben left her side and took his place in the class. He scanned the  class, and then said: &quot;Miss Frost, there's one boy here who belongs in  the second class.&quot; 
  At this revelation a boy standing next but one to Ben showed signs  of perturbation. 
  &quot;Who is it?&quot; asked the teacher. 
  &quot;John Cotton.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you belong to this class, John?&quot; 
  &quot;I ought to; I know enough,&quot; said he sullenly. 
  &quot;Today you will oblige me by taking your place in the second class.  In a few days I can decide whether you are able to go with this class.&quot; 
  John retired, discontented, but hopeful. 
  &quot;I shall be glad when any of you are fit for promotion,&quot; proceeded  Mabel. &quot;At first it will be best for the classes to remain as they were  during the last session.&quot; 
  So the organization continued. By noon the school was ready for  work; lessons had been assigned in grammar, geography, and arithmetic,  and the first class had read. 
  &quot;I think we have done a good morning's work,&quot; said Miss Mabel Frost  as the clock struck twelve. &quot;I believe our afternoon session commences  at one. I should like to have you all punctual.&quot; 
  In leaving the schoolroom to go to dinner, Mabel passed Ben Hadley.  &quot;You have been of great service to me, Ben,&quot; said she with a smile. &quot;I  really don't know how I should have got along without you.&quot; 
  Ben blushed with gratification. It was long since he had felt so  proud and well pleased with himself. 
  &quot;How do you like your new teacher, Ben?&quot; asked his father at the  dinner table. 
  &quot;She's a trump, father,&quot; said Ben, warmly. 
  &quot;Then you like her?&quot; asked the Squire in some astonishment, for he  understood perfectly well Ben's  school reputation. Indeed, more than  one teacher had come to him to complain of his son and heir's  mischievous conduct, and he had had misgivings that Miss Frost would  have occasion to do the same thing. 
  &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Ben, emphatically. She knows how to treat a  feller.&quot; 
  &quot;Then there was no disturbance?&quot; 
  &quot;Not a speck.&quot; 
  The Squire was greatly surprised. 
  &quot;I helped organize the school,&quot; proceeded Ben proudly. 
  &quot;YOU!&quot; exclaimed the Squire, in small capitals. 
  &quot;Certainly. Why shouldn't I? 
  &quot;I apprehend that you might need organizing yourself,&quot; said the  Squire, smiling at what he considered a witty remark. 
  &quot;Maybe I do, sometimes,&quot; said Ben,&quot; but I like Miss Frost, and I  mean to help her.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't see much in her,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley, opening her thin lips  disapprovingly. &quot;In my opinion she dresses too much for a teacher.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see why she shouldn't if she can afford it,&quot; said Ben, who  had constituted himself Mabel's champion. 
  She can't afford it on her wages,&quot; retorted his mother, 
  &quot;I guess that's her lookout,&quot; said Ben, hitting the nail on the  head. 
  &quot;Ben's taken an uncommon fancy to the school mistress,&quot; said Squire  Hadley, after Ben had returned to school. 
  &quot;It won't last,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley, shaking her head. &quot;He'll soon be  up to his old tricks again, take my word for it. I don't believe she'll  suit, either. A new broom sweeps clean. Just wait a while.&quot; 
  &quot;If it does last &#151; I mean Ben's fancy &#151; it will be surprising,&quot;  said the Squire. &quot;He's been a thorn in the side of most of the  teachers.&quot; 
  &quot;It won't last,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley decidedly, and there the  conversation dropped.
