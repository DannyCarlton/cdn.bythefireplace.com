  It was in the blood of John Aldous to kill Quade. He ran with the  quickness of a hare around the end of the cabin, past the window, and  then stopped to listen, his automatic in his hand, his eye piercing the  gloom for some moving shadow. He had not counted on an instant's  hesitation. He would shoot Quade, for he knew why the mottled beast had  been at the window. Stevens' boy had been right. Quade was after  Joanne. His ugly soul was disrupted with a desire to possess her, and  Aldous knew that when roused by passion he was more like a devil-fish  than a man&#8212;a creeping, slimy, night-seeking creature who had not only  the power of the underworld back of him, but wealth as well. He did not  think of him as a man as he stood listening, but as a beast. He was  ready to shoot. But he saw nothing. He heard no sound that could have  been made by a stumbling foot or a moving body. An hour later, the moon  would have been up, but it was dark now except for the stars. He heard  the hoot of an owl a hundred yards away. Out in the river something  splashed. From the timber beyond Buffalo Prairie came the yapping bark  of a coyote. For five minutes he stood as silent as one of the rocks  behind him. He realized that to go on&#8212;to seek blindly for Quade in the  darkness, would be folly. He went back, tapped at the door, and  reentered the cabin when Joanne threw back the lock.
  She was still pale. Her eyes were bright.
  &#8220;I was coming&#8212;in a moment,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was beginning to fear  that&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;&#8212;he had struck me down in the dark?&#8221; added Aldous, as she  hesitated. &#8220;Well, he would like to do just that, Joanne.&#8221; Unconsciously  her name had slipped from him. It seemed the most natural thing in the  world for him to call her Joanne now. &#8220;Is it necessary for me to tell  you what this man Quade is&#8212;why he was looking through the window?&#8221;
  She shuddered.
  &#8220;No&#8212;no&#8212;I understand!&#8221;
  &#8220;Only partly,&#8221; continued Aldous, his face white and set. &#8220;It is  necessary that you should know more than you have guessed, for your own  protection. If you were like most other women I would not tell you the  truth, but would try to shield you from it. As it is you should know.  There is only one other man in the Rocky Mountains more dangerous than  Bill Quade. He is Culver Rann, up at Tete Jaune. They are  partners&#8212;partners in crime, in sin, in everything that is bad and that  brings them gold. Their influence among the rougher elements along the  line of rail is complete. They are so strongly entrenched that they  have put contractors out of business because they would not submit to  blackmail. The few harmless police we have following the steel have  been unable to touch them. They have cleaned up hundreds of thousands,  chiefly in three things&#8212;blackmail, whisky, and women. Quade is the  viler of the two. He is like a horrible beast. Culver Rann makes me  think of a sleek and shining serpent. But it is this man Quade&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He found it almost impossible to go on with Joanne's blue eyes  gazing so steadily into his.
  &#8220;&#8212;whom we have made our enemy,&#8221; she finished for him.
  &#8220;Yes&#8212;and more than that,&#8221; he said, partly turning his head away.  &#8220;You cannot go on to Tete Jaune alone, Joanne. You must go nowhere  alone. If you do&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What will happen?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know. Perhaps nothing would happen. But you cannot go  alone. I am going to take you back to Mrs. Otto now. And to-morrow I  shall go on to Tete Jaune with you. It is fortunate that I have a place  up there to which I can take you, and where you will be safe.&#8221;
  As they were preparing to go, Joanne glanced ruefully at the table.
  &#8220;I am ashamed to leave the dishes in that mess,&#8221; she said.
  He laughed, and tucked her hand under his arm as they went through  the door. When they had passed through the little clearing, and the  darkness of the spruce and balsam walls shut them in, he took her hand.
  &#8220;It is dark and you may stumble,&#8221; he apologized. &#8220;This isn't much  like the shell plaza in front of the Cape Verde, is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. Did you pick up any of the little red bloodshells? I did, and  they made me shiver. There were strange stories associated with them.&#8221;
  He knew that she was staring ahead into the blank wall of gloom as  she spoke, and that it was not thought of the bloodshells, but of  Quade, that made her fingers close more tightly about his own. His  right hand was gripping the butt of his automatic. Every nerve in him  was on the alert, yet she could detect nothing of caution or  preparedness in his careless voice.
  &#8220;The bloodstones didn't trouble me,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I can't remember  anything that upset me more than the snakes. I am a terrible coward  when it comes to anything that crawls without feet. I will run from a  snake no longer than your little finger&#8212;in fact, I'm just as scared of  a little grass snake as I am of a python. It's the<I> thing</I>, and  not its size, that horrifies me. Once I jumped out of a boat into ten  feet of water because my companion caught an eel on his line, and  persisted in the argument that it was a fish. Thank Heaven we don't  have snakes up here. I've seen only three or four in all my experience  in the Northland.&#8221;
  She laughed softly in spite of the uneasy thrill the night held for  her.
  &#8220;It is hard for me to imagine you being afraid,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And yet  if you were afraid I know it would be of just some little thing like  that. My father was one of the bravest men in the world, and a hundred  times I have seen him show horror at sight of a spider. If you were  afraid of snakes, why did you go up the Gampola, in Ceylon?&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't know the snakes were there,&#8221; he chuckled. &#8220;I hadn't  dreamed there were a half so many snakes in the whole world as there  were along that confounded river. I slept sitting up, dressed in rubber  wading boots that came to my waist, and wore thick leather gloves. I  got out of the country at the earliest possible moment.&#8221;
  When they entered the edge of the Miette clearing and saw the glow  of lights ahead of them, Aldous caught the sudden upturn of his  companion's face, laughing at him in the starlight.
  &#8220;Kind, thoughtful John Aldous!&#8221; she whispered, as if to herself.  &#8220;How nice of you it was to talk of such pleasant things while we were  coming through that black, dreadful swamp&#8212;with a Bill Quade waiting  for us on the side!&#8221;
  A low ripple of laughter broke from her lips, and he stopped dead in  his tracks, forgetting to put the automatic back in his pocket. At  sight of it the amusement died in her face. She caught his arm, and one  of her hands seized the cold steel of the pistol.
  &#8220;Would he&#8212;<I>dare?</I>&#8221; she demanded.
  &#8220;You can't tell,&#8221; replied Aldous, putting the gun in his pocket.  &#8220;And that was a creepy sort of conversation to load you down with,  wasn't it, Ladygray? I imagine you'll catch me in all sorts of blunders  like that.&#8221; He pointed ahead. &#8220;There's Mrs. Otto now. She's looking  this way and wondering with all her big heart if you ought not to be at  home and in bed.&#8221;
  The door of the Otto home was wide open, and silhouetted in the  flood of light was the good-natured Scotchwoman. Aldous gave the  whistling signal which she and her menfolk always recognized, and  hurried on with Joanne.
  Before they had quite reached the tent-house, Joanne put a detaining  hand on his arm.
  &#8220;I don't want you to go back to the cabin to-night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The  face at the window&#8212;was terrible. I am afraid. I don't want you to be  there alone.&#8221;
  Her words sent a warm glow through him.
  &#8220;Nothing will happen,&#8221; he assured her. &#8220;Quade will not come back.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't want you to return to the cabin,&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;Is there  no other place where you can stay?&#8221;
  &#8220;I might go down and console Stevens, and borrow a couple of his  horse blankets for a bed if that will please you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will,&#8221; she cried quickly. &#8220;If you don't return to the cabin you  may go on to Tete Jaune with me to-morrow. Is it a bargain?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is!&#8221; he accepted eagerly. &#8220;I don't like to be chased out, but  I'll promise not to sleep in the cabin to-night.&#8221;
  Mrs. Otto was advancing to meet them. At the door he bade them  good-night, and walked on in the direction of the lighted avenue of  tents and shacks under the trees. He caught a last look in Joanne's  eyes of anxiety and fear. Glancing back out of the darkness that  swallowed him up, he saw her pause for a moment in the lighted doorway,  and look in his direction. His heart beat faster. Joyously he laughed  under his breath. It was strangely new and pleasing to have some one  thinking of him in that way.
  He had not intended to go openly into the lighted avenue. From the  moment he had plunged out into the night after Quade, his fighting  blood was roused. He had subdued it while with Joanne, but his  determination to find Quade and have a settlement with him had grown no  less. He told himself that he was one of the few men along the line  whom it would be difficult for Quade to harm in other than a physical  way. He had no business that could be destroyed by the other's  underground methods, and he had no job to lose. Until he had seen  Joanne enter the scoundrel's red-and-white striped tent he had never  hated a man as he now hated Quade. He had loathed him before, and had  evaded him because the sight of him was unpleasant; now he wanted to  grip his fingers around his thick red throat. He had meant to come up  behind Quade's tent, but changed his mind and walked into the lighted  trail between the two rows of tents and shacks, his hands thrust  carelessly into his trousers pockets. The night carnival of the  railroad builders was on. Coarse laughter, snatches of song, the click  of pool balls and the chink of glasses mingled with the thrumming of  three or four musical instruments along the lighted way. The phonograph  in Quade's place was going incessantly. Half a dozen times Aldous  paused to greet men whom he knew. He noted that there was nothing new  or different in their manner toward him. If they had heard of his  trouble with Quade, he was certain they would have spoken of it, or at  least would have betrayed some sign. For several minutes he stopped to  talk with MacVeigh, a young Scotch surveyor. MacVeigh hated Quade, but  he made no mention of him. Purposely he passed Quade's tent and walked  to the end of the street, nodding and looking closely at those whom he  knew. It was becoming more and more evident to him that Quade and his  pals were keeping the affair of the afternoon as quiet as possible.  Stevens had heard of it. He wondered how.
  Aldous retraced his steps. As though nothing had happened, he  entered Quade's place. There were a dozen men inside, and among them he  recognized three who had been there that afternoon. He nodded to them.  Slim Barker was in Quade's place behind the counter. Barker was Quade's  right-hand man at Miette, and there was a glitter in his rat-like eyes  as Aldous leaned over the glass case at one end of the counter and  asked for cigars. He fumbled a bit as he picked out half a dollar's  worth from the box. His eyes met Slim's.
  &#8220;Where is Quade?&#8221; he asked casually.
  Barker shrugged his shoulders.
  &#8220;Busy to-night,&#8221; he answered shortly. &#8220;Want to see him?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, not particularly. Only&#8212;I don't want him to hold a grudge.&#8221;
  Barker replaced the box in the case and turned away. After lighting  a cigar Aldous went out. He was sure that Quade had not returned from  the river. Was he lying in wait for him near the cabin? The thought  sent a sudden thrill through him. In the same breath it was gone. With  half a dozen men ready to do his work, Aldous knew that Quade would not  redden his own hands or place himself in any conspicuous risk. During  the next hour he visited the places where Quade was most frequently  seen. He had made up his mind to walk over to the engineers' camp, when  a small figure darted after him out of the gloom of the trees.
  It was Stevens' boy.
  &#8220;Dad wants to see you down at the camp,&#8221; he whispered excitedly. &#8220;He  says right away&#8212;an' for no one to see you. He said not to let any one  see me. I've been waiting for you to come out in the dark.&#8221;
  &#8220;Skip back and tell him I'll come,&#8221; replied Aldous quickly. &#8220;Be sure  you mind what he says&#8212;and don't let any one see you!&#8221;
  The boy disappeared like a rabbit. Aldous looked back, and ahead,  and then dived into the darkness after him.
  A quarter of an hour later he came out on the river close to  Stevens' camp. A little nearer he saw Stevens squatted close to a  smouldering fire about which he was drying some clothes. The boy was  huddled in a disconsolate heap near him. Aldous called softly, and  Stevens slowly rose and stretched himself. The packer advanced to where  he had screened himself behind a clump of bush. His first look at the  other assured him that he was right in using caution. The moon had  risen, and the light of it fell in the packer's face. It was a dead,  stonelike gray. His cheeks seemed thinner than when Aldous had seen him  a few hours before and there was despair in the droop of his shoulders.  His eyes were what startled Aldous. They were like coals of fire, and  shifted swiftly from point to point in the bush. For a moment they  stood silent.
  &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; Stevens said then. &#8220;Get out of the moonlight. I've got  something to tell you.&#8221;
  They crouched behind the bush.
  &#8220;You know what happened,&#8221; Stevens said, in a low voice. &#8220;I lost my  outfit.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I saw what happened, Stevens.&#8221;
  The packer hesitated for a moment. One of his big hands reached out  and gripped John Aldous by the arm.
  &#8220;Let me ask you something before I go on,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;You won't  take offence&#8212;because it's necessary. She looked like an angel to me  when I saw her up at the train. But you<I> know</I>. Is she good,  or&#8212;&#8212;You know what we think of women who come in here alone. That's  why I ask.&#8221;
  &#8220;She's what you thought she was, Stevens,&#8221; replied Aldous. &#8220;As pure  and as sweet as she looks. The kind we like to fight for.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was sure of it, Aldous. That's why I sent the kid for you. I saw  her in your cabin&#8212;after the outfit went to hell. When I come back to  camp, Quade was here. I was pretty well broken up. Didn't talk to him  much. But he seen I had lost everything. Then he went on down to your  place. He told me that later. But I guessed it soon as he come back. I  never see him look like he did then. I'll cut it short. He's mad&#8212;loon  mad&#8212;over that girl. I played the sympathy act, thinkin' of you&#8212;an'<I>  her</I>. He hinted at some easy money. I let him understand that at the  present writin' I'd be willing to take money most any way, and that I  didn't have any particular likin' for you. Then it come out. He made me  a proposition.&#8221;
  Stevens lowered his voice, and stopped to peer again about the bush.
  &#8220;Go on,&#8221; urged Aldous. &#8220;We're alone.&#8221;
  Stevens bent so near that his tobacco-laden breath swept his  companion's cheek.
  &#8220;He said he'd replace my lost outfit if I'd put you out of the way  some time day after to-morrow!&#8221;
  &#8220;Kill me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  For a few moments there was a silence broken only by their tense  breathing. Aldous had found the packer's hand. He was gripping it hard.
  &#8220;Thank you, old man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And he believes you will do it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I told him I would&#8212;day after to-morrow&#8212;an' throw your body in the  Athabasca.&#8221;
  &#8220;Splendid, Stevens! You've got Sherlock Holmes beat by a mile! And  does he want you to do this pretty job because I gave him a crack on  the jaw?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; exclaimed Stevens quickly. &#8220;He knows the girl is  a stranger and alone. You've taken an interest in her. With you out of  the way, she won't be missed. Dammit, man, don't you know his system?  And, if he ever wanted anything in his life he wants her. She's turned  that poison-blood of his into fire. He raved about her here. He'll go  the limit. He'll do anything to get her. He's so crazy I believe he'd  give every dollar he's got. There's just one thing for you to do. Send  the girl back where she come from. Then you get out. As for myself&#8212;I'm  goin' to emigrate. Ain't got a dollar now, so I might as well hit for  the prairies an' get a job on a ranch. Next winter I guess me 'n the  kid will trap up on the Parsnip River.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're wrong&#8212;clean wrong,&#8221; said Aldous quietly. &#8220;When I saw your  outfit going down among the rocks I had already made up my mind to help  you. What you've told me to-night hasn't made any difference. I would  have helped you anyway, Stevens. I've got more money than I know what  to do with right now. Roper has a thirty-horse outfit for sale. Buy it  to-morrow. I'll pay for it, and you needn't consider yourself a dollar  in debt. Some day I'll have you take me on a long trip, and that will  make up for it. As for the girl and myself&#8212;we're going on to Tete  Jaune to-morrow.&#8221;
  Aldous could see the amazed packer staring at him in the gloom. &#8220;You  don't think I'm sellin' myself, do you, Aldous?&#8221; he asked huskily.  &#8220;That ain't why you're doin' this&#8212;for me 'n the kid&#8212;is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I had made up my mind to do it before I saw you to-night,&#8221; repeated  Aldous. &#8220;I've got lots of money, and I don't use but a little of it. It  sometimes accumulates so fast that it bothers me. Besides, I've  promised to accept payment for the outfit in trips. These mountains  have got a hold on me, Stevens. I'm going to take a good many trips  before I die.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not if you go on to Tete Jaune, you ain't,&#8221; replied Stevens, biting  a huge quid from a black plug.
  Aldous had risen to his feet. Stevens stood up beside him.
  &#8220;If you go on to Tete Jaune you're a bigger fool than I was in  tryin' to swim the outfit across the river to-day,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;  He leaned toward Aldous, his eyes gleaming. &#8220;In the last six months  there's been forty dead men dragged out of the Frazer between Tete  Jaune an' Fort George. You know that. The papers have called 'em  accidents&#8212;the 'toll of railroad building.' Mebby a part of it is.  Mebby a half of them forty died by accident. The other half didn't.  They were sent down by Culver Rann and Bill Quade. Once you go floatin'  down the Frazer there ain't no questions asked. Somebody sees you an'  pulls you out&#8212;mebby a Breed or an Indian&#8212;an' puts you under a little  sand a bit later. If it's a white man he does likewise. There ain't no  time to investigate floaters over-particular in the wilderness.  Besides, you git so beat up in the rocks you don't look like much of  anything. I know, because I worked on the scows three months, an'  helped bury four of 'em. An' there wasn't anything, not even a scrap of  paper, in the pockets of two of 'em! Is that suspicious, or ain't it?  It don't pay to talk too much along the Frazer. Men keep their mouths  shut. But I'll tell you this: Culver Rann an' Bill Quade know a lot.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you think I'll go in the Frazer?&#8221;
  &#8220;Egzactly. Quade would rather have you in there than in the  Athabasca. And then&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Well?&#8221;
  Stevens spat into the bush, and shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;This  beautiful lady you've taken an interest in will turn up missing,  Aldous. She'll disappear off the face of the map&#8212;just like Stimson's  wife did. You remember Stimson?&#8221;
  &#8220;He was found in the Frazer,&#8221; said Aldous, gripping the other's arm  in the darkness.
  &#8220;Egzactly. An' that pretty wife of his disappeared a little later.  Up there everybody's too busy to ask where other people go. Culver Rann  an' Bill Quade know what happened to Stimson, an' they know what  happened to Stimson's wife. You don't want to go to Tete Jaune. You  don't want to let<I> her</I> go. I know what I'm talking about.  Because&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  There fell a moment's silence. Aldous waited. Stevens spat again,  and finished in a whisper:
  &#8220;Quade went to Tete Jaune to-night. He went on a hand-car. He's got  something he wants to tell Culver Rann that he don't dare telephone or  telegraph. An' he wants to get that something to him ahead of  to-morrow's train. Understand?&#8221;
