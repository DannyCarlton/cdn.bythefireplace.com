To spring belongs the violet, and the blown<br> Spice of the roses let the summer own.<br> Grant me this favor, Muse--all else withhold--<br> That I may not write verse when I am old. 
And yet I pray you, Muse, delay the time!<br> Be not too ready to deny me rhyme;<br> And when the hour strikes, as it must, dear Muse,<br> I beg you very gently break the news.
