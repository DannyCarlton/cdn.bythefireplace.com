  Ralph Pendleton proceeded. 
  &quot;This blow overwhelmed me. All that I had been laboring for seemed   suddenly snatched from me.&quot; 
  &quot;You had your money,&quot; suggested Mr. Stanton. 
  &quot;Yes, I had my money; but for money itself I cared little.&quot; 
  Mr. Stanton shrugged his shoulders a little contemptuously. He  could not  understand how anyone could think slightingly of money, and  he decided  in his own mind that Ralph was an unpractical enthusiast. 
  &quot;I valued money only as a means to an end, and that end was to make   Margaret Lindsay my wife. She failed me, and my money lost its charm.&quot; 
  &quot;There were plenty who could have consoled you in her place.&quot; 
  &quot;No doubt, I might have been successful in other quarters, but I  did not  care to try. I left New York in disgust, and, going West, I  buried  myself in the forest, where I built a rude cabin, and there I  have lived  since, an unsocial, solitary life. Years have passed since  I visited New  York.&quot; 
  &quot;What did you do with your money all this while?&quot; 
  &quot;I left it in the hands of men whom I could trust. It has been   accumulating all these years, and I find that the fifty thousand  dollars  have swelled to ninety thousand.&quot; 
  &quot;Indeed!&quot; ejaculated Mr. Stanton, his respect for Ralph  considerably  raised. &quot;And now you have come here to enjoy it, I  suppose?&quot; 
  &quot;A different motive has led to my coming&#8212;a motive connected with  you,&quot;  said Ralph, fixing his eyes steadily upon Mr. Stanton. 
  &quot;Connected with me!&quot; repeated the merchant, uneasily. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;May I ask in what manner?&quot; 
  &quot;I expected the question, and am come to answer it. When I returned  from  Europe impoverished, you gave me a brief statement of the manner  in  which you had invested my fortune, and showed me how it had melted  away  like snow before the sun.&quot; 
  &quot;You remember rightly. I bought, on your account, shares in Lake   Superior Mining Company, which promised excellently, and bade fair to   make handsome returns. But it proved to be under the management of   knaves, and ran quickly down from par to two per cent., at which price  I  thought best to sell out, considering that a little saved from the  wreck  was better than nothing.&quot; 
  &quot;This is according to the statement you made me,&quot; said Ralph,  quietly. 
  &quot;I am sure,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, &quot;that no one regretted more than I  do the  disastrous result. Indeed, I had reason to do so, for I was  myself  involved, and suffered considerable loss.&quot; 
  &quot;I am aware now that you were concerned in the matter,&quot; said Ralph,   significantly. 
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Mr. Stanton, quickly, detecting something   peculiar in his tone. 
  &quot;I will tell you. You were right in denouncing the management as  knavish.  The company was got up by knaves, on a basis of fraud, and  was from the  first intended as a trap for the unwary. But there is one  important  circumstance which you have neglected to mention.&quot; 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; asked Mr. Stanton, in a voice which strove to be   composed. 
  &quot;I mean this,&quot; said Ralph, firmly, &quot;that you yourself were the  prime  originator of the company&#8212;that you engineered it through to the  end&#8212;  that you invested my money with the express intention of  converting it  to your own profit. I charge you with this, that all, or  nearly all the  property I lost, went into your pocket.&quot; 
  The color came and went in Mr. Stanton's face. He seemed staggered  by  this sudden and unexpected accusation, and did not at first make  reply. 
  Feeling forced to speak at last, he said: &quot;This is very strange   language, Mr. Pendleton.&quot; 
  &quot;It is unexpected, no doubt, for after all these years you probably   thought it would remain forever unknown; but in what respect is it   strange? I have given you a statement of facts as directly as I  could.&quot; 
  &quot;They are not facts. Your charge is wholly false,&quot; said the  merchant,  but his tone was not that of a man. who speaks the truth  boldly. 
  &quot;I wish I could believe it,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;I wish I could believe  that I  was not deliberately swindled by one who professed to be my  father's  friend.&quot; 
  &quot;On what authority do you bring this monstrous charge?&quot; demanded  Mr.  Stanton, more boldly. &quot;How happens it that you have not made it  before?&quot; 
  &quot;For the simple reason that I myself did not suspect any fraud. I   presumed that it was as you stated to me, and that your only fault was   your injudicious investment.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I admit that, as it turned out, the investment was  injudicious.  Everything else I deny.&quot; 
  &quot;Your denial is vain.&quot; 
  &quot;You cannot prove the truth of what you say.&quot; 
  &quot;So you fall back on that? But you are mistaken. I can prove the  truth  of what I say,&quot; said Ralph firmly. 
  &quot;How?&quot; 
  &quot;Do you remember a man named David Marston?&quot; 
  &quot;He is dead,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, hastily. 
  &quot;So you have supposed,&quot; said Ralph; &quot;but you were deceived. He is  not  dead. I only encountered him a week since, quite by accident, in  my  Western home. He was your confidential clerk, you remember, and  fully  acquainted with all your business transactions at the time of  which I am  speaking. From him I learned how basely I had been  deceived, and with  what deliberate cruelty you conspired to rob the  son of your dead  friend.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe David Marston is alive,&quot; said Mr. Stanton,  hoarsely,  with a certain terror in his face. &quot;Indeed, I have proof  that he is  dead.&quot; 
  &quot;I know the character of your proof. A paper was forwarded to you  from  Australia, whither you had sent him, containing the record of his   death.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes? What have you to say against this?&quot; 
  &quot;That the publication was a mistake. He was dangerously sick, and  it was  falsely announced that he was dead. That notice was sent to  you, and you  believed it to be true.&quot; 
  &quot;I believe it now,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, doggedly. &quot;Why should I not?&quot; 
  &quot;If you wish to be convinced, proof is at hand. Wait a moment.&quot; 
  Ralph Pendleton rose from his seat and left the counting-room. Two   minutes had not passed when he returned with an elderly man, thin of   face and wasted in figure, looking twenty years older than Mr.  Stanton,  though really of about the same age. 
  &quot;This is David Marston,&quot; said Ralph&#8212;&quot;the living proof that I have  told  you the truth.&quot; 
  Mr. Stanton gazed at him wildly, for to him it was as the face of  one  risen from the dead. 
  &quot;How do you do, Mr. Stanton?&quot; said David Marston, humbly. &quot;It is  many,  many years since we met, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you really David Marston?&quot; demanded Mr. Stanton, never taking  his  eyes off the shrunken figure of his old clerk. 
  &quot;I am, sir; greatly changed indeed, but still the David Marston who  was  formerly in your employ. Time hasn't treated me as well as it has  you,  sir. I've been unlucky, and aged fast.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid your mind is also affected. You have been telling  strange  stories to Mr. Pendleton here.&quot; 
  &quot;True stories, sir,&quot; said David, firmly. 
  &quot;Come, come, how much is he going to give you for this evidence of   yours?&quot; 
  &quot;Stop, Mr. Stanton! You insult us both,&quot; said Ralph Pendleton,  sternly.  &quot;I am not the man to buy false evidence, nor is David Marston  the man to  perjure himself for pay. David, I want you, in Mr.  Stanton's presence,  to make a clear statement of his connection with  the mining company by  which I lost my fortune.&quot; 
  David Marston obeyed, and in a few words as possible unfolded the  story.  It is not necessary to repeat it here. Enough that it fully   substantiated the charge which Ralph had brought against his early   guardian, 
  When he had finished, Ralph said, &quot;You can judge what weight  Marston's  testimony would have before a court of justice, and whether  it would  help your commercial standing to have his story made public.&quot; 
  &quot;What is it you want of me?&quot; said Mr. Stanton, sullenly. 
  &quot;I want restitution, dollar for dollar, of my lost money. I will  waive  interest, though I might justly claim it. But, were it all paid,   interest and principal, the wrong would not be redressed. You cannot   restore the bride who would have been mine but for your villainy.&quot; 
  How much time will you give me to pay this money?&quot; asked the  merchant,  moodily. 
  &quot;Ten days.&quot; 
  &quot;It is a short time.&quot; 
  &quot;It must suffice. Do you agree?&quot; 
  &quot;I must.&quot; 
  &quot;Bind yourself to that, and for ten days I leave you free.&quot; 
  Satisfactory security was given that the engagement would be met,  and  Ralph Pendleton left the counting-room. But his countenance was  scarcely  more cheerful than that of the man he had conquered. 
  &quot;I am rich,&quot; he said to himself; &quot;but of what avail is it? Whom can  I  benefit with my wealth?&quot; 
  This thought had scarcely crossed his mind when he came face to  face  with Herbert, walking with a sad and downcast face in the  opposite  direction.
