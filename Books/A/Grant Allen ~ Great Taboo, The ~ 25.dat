For a minute or two Methuselah mumbled inarticulately to himself. Then,  to their intense discomfiture, he began once more: "In the nineteenth  year of the reign of his most gracious majesty, King Charles the Second,  I, Nathaniel Cross--"    
"Oh, this will never do," Felix cried. "We haven't got yet to the secret  at all. Muriel, do try to set him right. He must waste no breath. We  can't afford now to let him go all over it."    
Muriel stretched out her hand and soothed the bird gently as before.  "Having slain, therefore, my predecessor in the high godship," she  suggested, in the same singsong voice as the parrot's.    
To her immense relief, Methuselah took the hint with charming docility.    
"In the high godship," he went on, mechanically, where he had stopped.  "And this here is the manner whereby I obtained it. The Too-Keela-Keela  from time to time doth generally appoint any castaway stranger that comes  to the island to the post of Korong--that is to say, an annual god or  victim. For, as the year doth renew itself at each change of seasons, so  do these carribals in their gentilisme believe and hold that the gods of  the seasons--to wit, the King of the Rain, the Queen of the Clouds, the  Lord of Green Leaves, the King of Fruits, and others--must needs be  sleain and renewed at the diverse solstices. Now, it so happened that I,  on my arrival in the island, was appointed Korong, and promoted to the  post of King of the Rain, having a native woman assigned me as Queen of  the Clouds, with whom I might keep company. This woman being, after her  kind, enamored of me, and anxious to escape her own fate, to be sleain by  my side, did betray to me that secret which they call in their tongue the  Great Taboo, and which had been betrayed to herself in turn by a native  man, her former lover. For the men are instructed in these things in the  mysteries when they coom of age, but not the women.    
"And the Great Taboo is this: No man can becoom a Too-Keela-Keela unless  he first sleay the man in whom the high god is incarnate for the moment.  But in order that he may sleay him, he must also himself be a full  Korong, only those persons who are already gods being capable for the  highest post in their hierarchy; even as with ourselves, none but he that  is a deacon may become a priest, and none but he that is a priest may be  made a bishop. For this reason, then, the Too-Keela-Keela prefers to  advance a stranger to the post of Korong, seeing that such a person will  not have been initiated in the mysteries of the island, and therefore  will not be aware of those sundry steps which must needs be taken of him  that would inherit the godship.    
"Furthermore, even a Korong can only obtain the highest rank of  Too-Keela-Keela if he order all things according to the forms and  ceremonies of the Taboo parfectly. For these gentiles are very careful of  the levitical parts of their religion, deriving the same, as it seems to  me, from the polity of the Hebrews, the fame of whose tabernacle must  sure have gone forth through the ends of the woorld, and the knowledge of  whose temple must have been yet more wide dispersed by Solomon, his  ships, when they came into these parts to fetch gold from Ophir. And the  ceremony is, that before any man may sleay the 'arthly tenement of  Too-Keela-Keela and inherit his soul, which is in very truth, as they do  think the god himself, he must needs fight with the person in whom  Too-Keela-Keela doth then dwell, and for this reason: If the holder of  the soul can defend himself in fight, then it is clear that his strength  is not one whit decayed, nor is his vigor feailing; nor yet has his  assailant been able to take his soul from him. But if the Korong in open  fight do sleay the person in whom Too-Keela-Keela dwells, he becometh at  once a Too-Keela-Keela himself--that is to say, in their tongue, the Lord  of Lords, because he hath taken the life of him that preceded him.    
"Yet so intricate is the theology and practice of these loathsome  savages, that not even now have I explained it in full to you, O  shipwrecked mariner, for your aid and protection. For a Korong, though it  be a part of his privilege to contend, if he will, with Too-Keela-Keela  for the high godship and princedom of this isle, may only do so at  certain appointed times, places, and seasons. Above all things, it is  necessary that he should first find out the hiding-place of the soul of  Too-Keela-Keela. For though the Too-Keela-Keela for the time that is, be  animated by the god, yet, for greater security, he doth not keep his soul  in his own body, but, being above all things the god of fruitfulness and  generation, who causes women to bear children, and the plant called taro  to bring forth its increase, he keepeth his soul in the great sacred tree  behind his temple, which is thus the Father of All Trees, and the  chiefest abode of the great god Too-Keela-Keela.    
"Nor does Too-Keela-Keela's soul abide equally in every part of this  aforesaid tree; but in a certain bough of it, resembling a mistletoe,  which hath yellow leaves, and, being broken off, groweth ever green and  yellow afresh; which is the central mystery of all their Sathanic  religion. For in this very bough--easy to be discerned by the eye among  the green leaves of the tree--" the bird paused and faltered.    
Muriel leaned forward in an agony of excitement. "Among the green leaves  of the tree--" she went on soothing him.    
Her voice seemed to give the parrot a fresh impulse to speak. "--Is  contained, as it were," he continued, feebly, "the divine essence itself,  the soul and life of Too-Keela-Keela. Whoever, then, being a full Korong,  breaks this off, hath thus possessed himself of the very god in person.  This, however, he must do by exceeding stealth; for Too-Keela-Keela,  or rather the man that bears that name, being the guardian and defender  of the great god, walks ever up and down, by day and by night, in  exceeding great cunning, armed with a spear and with a hatchet of stone,  around the root of the tree, watching jealously over the branch which is,  as he believes, his own soul and being. I, therefore, being warned of the  Taboo by the woman that was my consort, did craftily, near the appointed  time for my own death, creep out of my hut, and my consort, having  induced one of the wives of Too-Keela-Keela to make him drunken with too  much of that intoxicating drink which they do call kava, did proceed--did  proceed--did proceed--In the nineteenth year of the reign of his most  gracious majesty, King Charles the Second--"    
Muriel bent forward once more in an agony of suspense. "Oh, go on, good  Poll!" she cried. "Go on. Remember it. Did proceed to--"    
The single syllable helped Methuselah's memory. "--Did proceed to  stealthily pluck the bough, and, having shown the same to Fire and Water,  the guardians of the Taboo, did boldly challenge to single combat the  bodily tenement of the god, with spear and hatchet, provided for me in  accordance with ancient custom by Fire and Water. In which combat,  Heaven mercifully befriending me against my enemy, I did coom out  conqueror; and was thereupon proclaimed Too-Keela-Keela myself, with  ceremonies too many and barbarous to mention, lest I raise your gorge at  them. But that which is most important to tell you for your own guidance  and safety, O mariner, is this--that being the sole and only end I have  in imparting this history to so strange a messenger--that after you have  by craft plucked the sacred branch, and by force of arms over-cootn  Too-Keela-Keela, it is by all means needful, whether you will or not,  that submitting to the hateful and gentile custom of this people--of this  people--Pretty Poll! Pretty Poll! God save--God save the king! Death  to the nineteenth year of the reign of all arrant knaves and roundheads."    
He dropped his head on his breast, and blinked his white eyelids more  feebly than ever. His strength was failing him fast. The Soul of all dead  parrots was wearing out. M. Peyron, who had stood by all this time, not  knowing in any way what might be the value of the bird's disclosures,  came forward and stroked poor Methuselah with his caressing hand. But  Methuselah was incapable now of any further effort. He opened his blind  eyes sleepily for the last, last time, and stared around him with a blank  stare at the fading universe. "God save the king!" he screamed aloud with  a terrible gasp, true to his colors still. "God save the king, and to  hell with all papists!"    
Then he fell off his perch, stone dead, on the ground. They were never to  hear the conclusion of that strange, quaint message from a forgotten age  to our more sceptical century.    
Felix looked at Muriel, and Muriel looked at Felix. They could hardly  contain themselves with awe and surprise. The parrot's words were so  human, its speech was so real to them, that they felt as though the  English Tu-Kila-Kila of two hundred years back had really and truly  been speaking to them from that perch; it was a human creature indeed  that lay dead before them. Felix raised the warm body from the ground  with positive reverence. "We will bury it decently," he said in French,  turning to M. Peyron. "He was a plucky bird, indeed, and he has carried  out his master's intentions nobly."    
As they spoke, a little rustling in the jungle hard by attracted their  attention. Felix turned to look. A stealthy brown figure glided away in  silence through the tangled brushwood. M. Peyron started. "We are  observed, monsieur," he said. "We must look out for squalls! It is one  of the Eyes of Tu-Kila-Kila!"    
"Let him do his worst!" Felix answered. "We know his secret now, and can  protect ourselves against him. Let us return to the shade, monsieur, and  talk this all over. Methuselah has indeed given us something to-day very  serious to think about."
