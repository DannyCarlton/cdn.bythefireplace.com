It was a week later. Alexina was changing her dress. Maria had asked a  number of her girlhood friends in for luncheon, and they were to exchange  reminiscences in the old house over a table laden as of yore with the  massive Ballinger silver, English cutglass, and French china. Alexina was  about to take refuge with Janet Maynard.    
Her door opened unceremoniously and Gora entered.    
Alexina caught her breath as she saw her sister-in-law's eyes. They looked  like polar seas in a tropical storm.    
"Why, Gora, dear," she said lightly. "I thought you were on an important  case."    
"Man died last night. I have just been to see Mortimer. When I got his  note--just three lines--saying that he had received a cheque from Utica  and deposited it to my account I knew at once--as soon as I had time to  think--there was something wrong. The natural thing would have been to call  me up--couldn't tell me the good news too soon....And there was a hollow  ring about that note....Well, as soon as I woke up to-day I went straight  down to his office. I had to wait an hour. When he came in and saw me he  turned green. I marched him into a back room and corkscrewed the truth out  of him--the whole truth. Then I blasted him. He knows exactly what one  person in this world thinks of him, what everybody else would think of  him if he were found out. I gathered that you had let him down easy. Your  toploftical pride, I suppose. Well, I must have a good plebeian streak in  me somewhere and for the first time I was glad of it. When I left him he  looked shrunken to half his natural size. His eyes looked like a dead  fish's and all the muscles of his face had given Way. He looked as if he  were going to die and I wish he would. Faugh! A thief in the family. That  at least we never had before."    
"Don't be too sure. Remember nobody else knows about Morty, and  everybody'll go on thinking he's honest. Half our friends may be thieves  for all we know, and as for our ancestors--what are you doing?"

Gora had taken a roll of yellow bills from her purse. She counted them on  the table; ten bills denominating a thousand dollars each.    
"I won't take them." said Alexina stiffy. "I think you are horrid, simply  horrid,"    
"And do you imagine I would keep it? I What do you take me for?"    
"I am in a way responsible for Mortimer's debts--his partner."    
"That cuts no ice with me--nor with you. That is not the reason you sold  your jewels and laces and those superb--Oh, you poor child! If I'm furious,  it's more for you than on any other account. You don't deserve such a  fate--"    
"I don't deserve to have you treat me so ungratefully. I can't get my  things back. I wanted you to have the money more than I eared for those  things, anyhow. I have no use for the money. I don't owe anything and the  rent Tom pays me for six months will help me to run the house for the rest  of the year and pay taxes besides. So, you just keep it, Gora. It's yours  and that's the end of it."    
"This is the end of it as far as I'm concerned." She opened the secret  drawer of the cabinet and stuffed in the bills. "They're safe from any sort  of burglars there. But not from fire. Bank them to-morrow."    
"I'll not touch them."    
"Nor I either."

Gora threw her hat on the floor and sitting down before the table thrust  her hands into her hair and tugged at the roots. "I always do this when  I'm excited--which is oftener than you think. What dreams I had that first  night--I got his note late and was too tired to reason, to suspect....I  just dreamed until I fell asleep. I'd start for England a week later--for  England!"    
Goose flesh made Alexina's delicate body feel like a cold nutmeg grater.  "England?"    
"Yes!...ah...you see, it's the only place where literary recognition counts  for anything."    
"Oh? I rather thought the British authors looked upon Uncle Sam in the  light of a fairy godfather. Our recognition counts for a good deal, I  should say. I never thought you were snobbish."    
"I'm not really. Only London is a sort of Mecca for writers just as Paris  is for women of fashion....Just fancy being feted in London after you had  written a successful novel."    
"I'd far rather receive recognition in my own country," said Alexina,  elevating her classic American profile. She was not feeling in the least  patriotic, however. "You'd see your friend Gathbroke, though. That would be  jolly. Do take the money, Gora, and don't be a goose."    
"That subject's closed. Don't let me keep you. James told me that Maria is  having a luncheon, and I suppose that means you are going out. I'll rest  here for awhile if you don't mind."
