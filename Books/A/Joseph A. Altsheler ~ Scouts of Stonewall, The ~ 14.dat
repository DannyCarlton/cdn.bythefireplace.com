  The twenty-four hours were a rest, merely by comparison.  There was  no  pursuit, at least, the enemy was not in sight, but the scouts  brought  word that the bridge over the Shenandoah would be completed in  a day and  night, and that Fremont would follow.  Jackson's army  triumphantly passed  the last defile of the Massanuttons and the army  of Shields did not  appear issuing from it.  It was no longer possible  for them to be struck  in front and on the flank at the same time, and  the army breathed a  mighty sigh of relief.  At night of the next day  Harry was sitting by the  camp of the Invincibles, having received a  brief leave of absence from  the staff, and he detailed the news to his  eager friends. 
  &#8220;General Jackson is stripping again for battle,&#8221; he said to Colonel   Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire.  &#8220;He's sent   all the sick and wounded across a ferry to Staunton, and he's  dispatched  his prisoners and captured stores by another road.  So he  has nothing  left but men fit for battle.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Which includes me,&#8221; said St. Clair proudly, showing his left  shoulder  from which the bandage had been taken, &#8220;I'm as well as ever.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Men get well fast with Stonewall Jackson,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot.   &#8220;I'll  confess to you lads that I thought it was all up with us there  in the  lower valley, when we were surrounded by the masses of the  enemy, and I  don't see yet how we got here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But we are here, Leonidas,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire,  &#8220;and that's enough for us to know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Right, Hector, old friend.  It's enough for us to know.  Do you by   chance happen to have left two of those delightful cigarettes?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Just two, Leonidas, one for you and one for me, and now is a  chance to  smoke 'em.&#8221; 
  The young lieutenants drew to one side while the two old friends  smoked  and compared notes.  They did not smoke, but they compared  notes also,  as they rested on the turf.  The rain had ceased and the  grass was dry.  They saw through the twilight the dark mass of the  Massanuttons, the  extreme southern end, and Happy Tom Langdon waved  his hand toward the  mountain, like one who salutes a friend. 
  &#8220;Good old mountain,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You've been a buffer between us and  the  enemy more than once, but it took a mind like Stonewall Jackson's  to keep  moving you around so you would stand between the armies of the  enemy and  make the Yankees fight, only one army at a time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're right,&#8221; said Harry, who was enjoying the deep luxury of  rest.  &#8220;I didn't know before that mountains could be put to such good  use.  Look, you can see lights on the ridge now.&#8221; 
  They saw lights, evidently those of powerful lanterns swung to and  fro,  but they did not understand them, nor did they care much. 
  &#8220;Signals are just trifles to me now,&#8221; said Happy Tom.  &#8220;What do I  care  for lights moving on a mountain four or five miles away, when for  a month,  day and night without stopping, a million Yankees have been  shooting  rifle bullets at me, and a thousand of the biggest cannon  ever cast have  been pouring round shot, long shot, shell, grape,  canister and a hundred  other kinds of missiles that I can't name upon  this innocent and  unoffending head of mine.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They'll be on us tomorrow, Happy,&#8221; said St. Clair, more gravely.   &#8220;This picnic of ours can't last more than a day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;So long, boys, I've got to join  Captain  Sherburne.  The general has detached me for service with him  under Ashby,  and you know that when you are with them, something is  going to happen.&#8221; 
  Harry slept well that night, partly in a camp and partly in a  saddle,  and he found himself the next day with Ashby and Sherburne  near a little  town called Harrisonburg.  They were on a long hill in  thick forest,  and the scouts reported that the enemy was coming.  The  Northern armies  were uniting now and they were coming up the valley,  expecting to crush  all opposition. 
  &#8220;Take your glasses, Harry,&#8221; said Sherburne, &#8220;and you'll see a  strong  force crossing the fields, but it's not strong enough.  We've a  splendid  position here in the forest and you just watch.  Ah, here  come your  friends, the Invincibles.  See, Ashby is forming them in the  center,  while we, of the horse, take the flanks.&#8221; 
  The men in blue, catching sight of the Confederate uniforms in the  wood,  charged with a shout, but they did not know the strength of the  force  before them.  The Invincibles poured in a deadly fire at close  range,  and then Ashby's cavalry with a yell charged on either flank.   The  Northern troops, taken by surprise, gave way, and the Southern  force  followed, firing continuously. 
  They came within a half mile of Harrisonburg, and the main Northern  army  of Fremont was at hand.  The general who had pursued so long, saw  his men  retreating, and, filled with chagrin and anger, he hurried  forward  heavier forces of both cavalry and infantry.  Other troops  came to the  relief of Ashby also, and Harry saw what he thought would  be only a heavy  skirmish grow into a hot battle of size. 
  Fremont, resolved that the North should win a battle in the open  field,  and rejoiced that he had at last brought his enemy to bay,  never ceased  to hurry his troops to the combat.  Formidable lines of  the western  riflemen rushed on either flank, and before their deadly  rifles Ashby's  cavalry wavered.  Harry saw with consternation that  they were about to  give way, but Ashby galloped up to the unbroken  lines of infantry and  ordered them to charge. 
  The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when his horse, shot  through,  fell to the ground.  Ashby fell with him, but he sprang  instantly to his  feet, and shouted in a loud voice: 
  &#8220;Charge men, for God's sake!  Charge!  Charge!&#8221;  With a rush and  roar,  the Invincibles and their comrades swept forward, but at the  same instant  Harry saw Ashby fall again.  With a cry of horror he  leaped from his  horse and ran to him, lifting him in his arms.  But he  quickly laid him  back on the grass.  Ashby had been shot through the  heart and killed  instantly. 
  Harry gazed around him, struck with grief and dismay, but he saw  only the  resistless rush of the infantry.  The Invincibles and their  comrades were  avenging the death of Turner Ashby.  Tired of retreating  and hot for  action they struck the Northern division with a mighty  impact, shattering  it and driving it back rapidly.  The Southern  cavalry, recovering also,  struck it on the flank, and the defeat was  complete.  Fremont's wish was  denied him.  After so much hard marching  and such a gallant and tenacious  pursuit, he had gone the way of the  other Northern generals who opposed  Jackson, and was beaten. 
  Although they had driven back the vanguard, winning a smart little   victory, and telling to Fremont and Shields that the pursuit of  Jackson  had now become dangerous, there was gloom in the Southern  army.  The  horsemen did not know until they trotted back and saw Harry  kneeling  beside his dead body, that the great Ashby was gone.  For a  while they  could not believe it.  Their brilliant and daring leader,  who had led  Jackson's vanguard in victory, and who had hung like a  covering curtain  in retreat, could not have fallen.  It seemed  impossible that the man who  had led for days and days through  continuous showers of bullets could  have been slain at last by some  stray shot. 
  But they lifted him up finally and carried him away to a house in  the  little neighboring village of Port Republic, Sherburne and the  other  captains, hot from battle, riding with uncovered heads.  He was  put upon  a bed there, and Harry, a staff officer, was selected to ride  to Jackson  with the news.  He would gladly have evaded the errand, but  it was  obvious that he was the right messenger. 
  He rode slowly and found Jackson coming up with the main force,   Dr. McGuire, his physician, and Colonel Crutchfield, his chief of   artillery, riding on either side of him.  The general gave one glance  at  Harry's drooping figure. 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have we not won the victory?  From a hilltop our   glasses showed the enemy in flight.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, general,&#8221; said Harry, taking off his hat, &#8220;we defeated the  enemy,  but General Ashby is dead.&#8221; 
  Jackson and his staff were silent for a moment, and Harry saw the  general  shrink as if he had received a heavy blow. 
  &#8220;Ashby killed!  Impossible!&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  &#8220;It's true, sir.  I helped to carry his body to a house in Port  Republic,  where it is now lying.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Lead us to that house, Mr. Kenton,&#8221; said Jackson. 
  Harry rode forward in silence, and the others followed in the same   silence.  At the house, after they had looked upon the body, Jackson   asked to be left alone awhile with all that was left of Turner Ashby.   The others withdrew and Harry always believed that Jackson prayed  within  that room for the soul of his departed comrade. 
  When he came forth his face had resumed its sternness, but was  without  other expression, as usual. 
  &#8220;He will not show grief, now,&#8221; said Sherburne, &#8220;but I think that  his soul  is weeping.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And a bad time for Fremont and Shields is coming,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;It's a risk that we all take in war,&#8221; said Dalton, who was more of  a  fatalist than any of the others. 
  The chief wrote a glowing official tribute to Ashby, saying that  his  &#8220;daring was proverbial, his powers of endurance almost incredible,   his character heroic, and his sagacity almost intuitive in divining  the  purposes and movements of the enemy.&#8221;  Yet deeply as Harry had  been  affected by Ashby's death, it could not remain in his mind long,  because  they had passed the Massanuttons now, and Fremont and Shields  following  up the valley must soon unite. 
  Harry believed that Jackson intended to strike a blow.  The  situation of  the Confederacy was again critical&#8212;it seemed to Harry  that it was always  critical&#8212;and somebody must wield the sword, quick  and strong.  McClellan  with his great and well-trained army was before  Richmond.  It was only  the rapid marches and lightning strokes of  Jackson that had kept McDowell  with another great army from joining  him, but to keep back this force of  McDowell until they dealt with  McClellan, there must be yet other rapid  marches and lightning  strokes. 
  Harry's sleep that night was the longest in two weeks, but he was  up at  dawn, and he was directed by Jackson to ride forward with  Sherburne  toward the southern base of the Massanuttons, observe the  approach of  both Fremont and Shields and report to him. 
  Harry was glad of his errand.  He always liked to ride with  Sherburne,  who was a fount of cheerfulness, and he was still keyed up  to that  extraordinary intensity and pitch of excitement that made all  things  possible.  He now understood how the young soldiers of Napoleon  in Italy  had been able to accomplish so much.  It was the man, a  leader of  inspiration and genius, surcharging them all with electrical  fire. 
  Sherburne's troop was a portion of a strong cavalry force, which  divided  as it reached the base of the Massanuttons, a half passing on  either  side.  Sherburne and Harry rode to the right in order to see  the army of  Shields.  The day was beautiful, with a glorious June sun  and gentle  winds, but Harry, feeling something strange about it,  realized presently  that it was the silence.  For more than two weeks  cannon had been  thundering and rifles crashing in the valley, almost  without cessation.  Neither night nor storm had caused any  interruption. 
  It seemed strange, almost incredible now, but they heard birds  singing as  they flew from tree to tree, and peaceful rabbits popped up  in the brush.  Yet before they went much further they saw the dark  masses of the  Northern army under Shields moving slowly up the valley,  and anxious for  the junction with Fremont. 
  But the Northern generals were again at a loss.  Jackson had turned   suddenly and defeated Fremont's vanguard with heavy loss, but what had   become of him afterward?  Fremont and Shields were uncertain of the   position of each other, and they were still more uncertain about   Jackson's.  He might fall suddenly upon either, and they grew very   cautious as they drew near to the end of the Massanuttons. 
  Sherburne and Harry, after examining the Northern army through  their  glasses, rode back with a dozen men to the south base of the   Massanuttons.  Most of them were signal officers, and Harry and  Sherburne,  dismounting, climbed the foot of the mountain with them.   When they stood  upon the crest and looked to right and left in the  clear June air,  they beheld a wonderful sight. 
  To the south along Mill Creek lay Jackson's army.  To the west  massed in  the wider valley was the army of Fremont, which had followed  them so  tenaciously, and to the east, but just separated from it by  the base of  the Massanuttons, were the masses of Shields advancing  slowly. 
  Harry through his powerful glasses could see the horsemen in front   scouting carefully in advance of either army, and once more he   appreciated to the full Jackson's skill in utilizing the mountains and   rivers to keep his enemies apart.  But what would he do now that they   were passing the Massanuttons, and there was no longer anything to   separate Shields and Fremont.  He dismissed the thought.  There was an   intellect under the old slouch hat of the man who rode Little Sorrel  that  could rescue them from anything. 
  &#8220;Quite a spectacle,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;A man can't often sit at  ease on a  mountaintop and look at three armies.  Now, Barron, you are  to signal  from here to General Jackson every movement of our enemies,  but just  before either Shields or Fremont reaches the base of the  mountain,  you're to slip down and join us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We'll do it, sir,&#8221; said Barron, the chief signal officer.  &#8220;We're  not  likely to go to sleep up here with armies on three sides of us.&#8221; 
  Sherburne, Harry and two other men who were not to stay slowly  descended  the mountain.  Harry enjoyed the breathing space.  On the  mountainside he  was lifted, for a while, above the fierce passions of  war.  He saw things  from afar and they were softened by distance.  He  drew deep breaths of  the air, crisp and cool, on the heights, and  Sherburne, who saw the glow  on his face, understood.  The same glow  was on his own face. 
  &#8220;It's a grand panorama, Harry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we'll take our fill  of it  for a few moments.&#8221;  They stood on a great projection of rock  and looked  once more and for a little while into the valley and its  divisions.  The two Northern armies were nearer now, and they were  still moving.  Harry saw the sun flashing over thousands of bayonets.   He almost fancied  he could hear the crack of the teamsters' whips as  the long lines of  wagons in the rear creaked along. 
  They descended rapidly, remounted their horses and galloped back to   Jackson. 
  They buried Ashby that day, all the leading Southern officers  following  him to his grave, and throughout the afternoon the silence  was continued.  But the signals on the mountain worked and worked, and  the signalmen with  Jackson replied.  No movement of the two pursuing  armies was unknown to  the Southern leader. 
  Harry, with an hour's leave, visited once more his friends of the   Invincibles.  He had begged a package of fine West Indian cigarettes  from  Sherburne, and he literally laid them at the feet of the two  colonels&#8212;he  found them sitting together on the grass, lean gray men  who seemed to be  wholly reduced to bone and muscle. 
  &#8220;This is a great gift, Harry, perhaps greater than you think,&#8221; said   Colonel Leonidas Talbot gravely.  &#8220;I tried to purchase some from the   commissariat, but they had none&#8212;it seems that General Stonewall  Jackson  doesn't consider cigarettes necessary for his troops.  Anyhow,  the way  our Confederate money is going, I fancy a package of  cigarettes will soon  cost a hundred dollars.  Here, Hector, light up.   We divide this box,  half and half.  That's right, isn't it, Harry?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Certainly, sir.&#8221; 
  Harry passed on to the junior officers and found St. Clair and  Happy Tom  lying on the grass.  Happy pretended to rouse from sleep  when Harry came. 
  &#8220;Hello, old omen of war,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;What's Old Jack expecting of  us now?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I told you never to ask me such a question as that again.  The  general  isn't what you'd call a garrulous man.  How's your shoulder,  Arthur?&#8221; 
  &#8220;About well.  The muscles were not torn.  It was just loss of blood  that  troubled me for the time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hear,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;that the two Yankee armies are to join  soon.  The Massanuttons won't be between them much longer, and then  they'll have  only one of the forks of the river to cross before they  fall upon each  other's breasts and weep with joy.  Harry, it seems to  me that we're  always coming to a fork of the Shenandoah.  How many  forks does it have  anyhow?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Only two, but the two forks have forks of their own.  That's the  reason  we're always coming to deep water and by the same token the  Yankees are  always coming to it, too, which is a good thing for us, as  we get there  first, when the bridges are there, and when the Yankees  come they are  gone.&#8221; 
  But not one of these boys understood the feeling in the Northern  armies.  Late the day before a messenger from Shields had got through  the  Massanuttons to Fremont, and had informed him that an easy triumph  was at  hand.  Jackson and his army, he said, fearing the onset of  overwhelming  numbers, was retreating in great disorder. 
  The two generals were now convinced of speedy victory.  They had   communicated at last, and they could have some concert of movement.   Jackson was less than thirty miles away, and his army was now but a   confused mass of stragglers which would dissolve under slight impact.   Both had defeats and disappointments to avenge, and they pushed  forward  now with increased speed, Shields in particular showing the  greatest  energy in pursuit.  But the roads were still deep in mud, and  his army  was forced to toil on all that day and the next, while the  signalmen on  the top of the Massanuttons told every movement he made  to Stonewall  Jackson. 
  The signals the second evening told Jackson that the two Northern  armies  were advancing fast, and that he would soon have before him an  enemy  outnumbering him anywhere from two to three to one.  He had been  talking  with Ewell just before the definite news was brought, and  Harry, Dalton  and other officers of the staff stood near, as their  duty bade them. 
  Harry knew the nature of the information, as it was not a secret  from any  member of the staff, and now they all stood silently on one  side and  watched Jackson.  Even Ewell offered no suggestion, but kept  his eyes  fixed anxiously on his chief.  Harry felt that another one of  those  critical moments, perhaps the most dangerous of all, had  arrived.  They had fought army after army in detail, but now they must  fight armies  united, or fly.  He did not know that the silent general  was preparing  the most daring and brilliant of all his movements in  the valley.  In the face of both Shields and Fremont his courage flamed  to the highest,  and the brain under the old slouch hat grew more  powerful and penetrating  than ever.  And flight never for a moment  entered into his scheme. 
  Jackson at length said a few words to Ewell, who sprang upon his  horse  and rode away to his division.  Then, early in the morning,  Jackson led  the rest of the army into a strange district, the Grottoes  of the  Shenandoah.  It was a dark region, filled beneath with great  caves and  covered thickly with heavy forest, through the leaves of  which the troops  caught views of the Massanuttons to the north or of  the great masses of  the Blue Ridge to the east, while far to the west  lay other mountains,  range on range.  But all around them the country  was wooded heavily. 
  The army did not make a great amount of noise when it camped in the   forest over the caves, and the fires were few.  Perhaps some of the  men  were daunted by the dangers which still surrounded them so thickly  after  so many days of such fierce fighting.  At any rate, they were  silent.  The Acadians had played no music for a day now, and the band  lay upon the  ground sunk in deep slumber. 
  Harry had not been sent on any errand, and he was sitting on a  stone,  finishing his supper, when Dalton, who had been away with a  message,  returned. 
  &#8220;What's happened, George?&#8221; asked Harry. 
  &#8220;Nothing yet, but a lot will happen soon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've been on the other side of the Shenandoah.  You needn't open  your  eyes.  It's so.  Moreover, Ewell's whole division is over there,  and it  will meet the vanguard of Fremont as he advances.  I think I  begin to see  the general's scheme.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I do, too.  Ewell will fight off Fremont, holding him there until   Jackson can annihilate Shields.  Then he will retreat over the river  to  Jackson, burning the bridge behind him.&#8221; 
  Dalton nodded. 
  &#8220;Looks that way to a man up a tree,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;It's like the general,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;He could bring his whole  army on  this side, burn the bridge, and in full force attack Shields,  but he  prefers to defeat them both.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; but I wish to Heaven we had more men.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Sh!  Here comes the general,&#8221; said Harry. 
  The two were silent as General Jackson and an officer passed.  The   general spoke a word or two to the boys and went on.  They were but   ordinary words, but both felt uplifted because he had spoken to them. 
  Morning found them motionless in the forest, over the caves.  They  ate a  hasty breakfast and waited.  But the scouts were all out, and  presently  Harry and Dalton were sent toward the Shenandoah.  Finding  nothing there,  they crossed over the bridge and came to Ewell's  division, where they had  plenty of acquaintances. 
  The sun was now high, and while they were talking with their  friends,  they heard the faint report of rifle shots far in their  front.  Presently  the scouts came running back, and said that the  enemy was only two miles  away and was advancing to the attack. 
  Ewell took off his hat and his bald head glistened in the sun's  rays.  But, like Jackson, he was always cool, and he calmly moved his  troops  into position along a low ridge, with heavy woods on either  flank.  Harry knew the ground, alas, too well.  It was among the trees  just  behind the ridge that Turner Ashby had been slain.  Ewell had  before him  Fremont with two to one, and the rest of the army under  Jackson's  immediate command was four miles away, facing Shields. 
  &#8220;Do you hear anything behind you, Harry?&#8221; asked Dalton. 
  &#8220;No, why do you ask?&#8221; 
  &#8220;If we heard the booming of guns, and we'd hear 'em at four miles,   we'd know that General Jackson himself was engaged.  But as there's no   sound, Shields hasn't come up, and we'll wait here a while to see if  we  can't have something important to report.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't think so,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;We know that the enemy is about  to  attack here in full force, and that's enough to know about this  side of  the river.  We ought to gallop back to General Jackson and  tell him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You're right, Harry,&#8221; said the Virginian, in whom the sense of  duty was  strong.  &#8220;The general may be attacked by the time we get  there, and he'll  want to know exactly how things are.&#8221; 
  They galloped back as fast as they could and found that General  Jackson  had moved his headquarters to the little village of Port  Republic.  They found him and told him the news as he was mounting his  horse,  but at the same time an excited and breathless messenger came  galloping  up from another direction.  The vanguard of Shields had  already routed  his pickets, and the second Northern army was pressing  forward in full  force. 
  As he spoke, the Northern cavalry came in sight, and if those  Northern  horsemen had known what a prize was almost within their  hands, they would  have spared no exertion. 
  &#8220;Make for the bridge!  Make for the bridge, general!&#8221; cried Dalton. 
  The horsemen in blue were not coming fast.  They rode cautiously  through  the streets.  Southern villages were not friendly to them, and  this  caution saved Stonewall Jackson.  He was on his horse in an  instant,  galloping for the bridge, and Harry and Dalton were hot  behind him.  They thundered over the bridge with the Northern cavalry  just at their  heels, and escaped by a hair's breadth.  But the chief  of artillery and  Dr. McGuire and one of the captains, Willis, were  captured, and the rest  of the staff was dispersed. 
  &#8220;My God!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, when the Northern cavalry stopped at the   bridge.  &#8220;What an escape!&#8221; 
  He was thinking of Jackson's escape, not his own, and while he was   wondering what the general would do, he saw him ride to the bank of  the  river and watch the Northern cavalry on the other side.  Then  Harry and  Dalton uttered a shout as they saw a Southern battery push  forward from  the village and open on the cavalry.  An infantry  regiment, which had  been forming in the town, also came up at full  speed, uttering the long,  high-pitched rebel yell. 
  The Northern vanguard, which had come so near to such a high  achievement,  was driven back with a rush, and a Southern battery  appearing on its  flank, swept it with shell as it retreated.  So heavy  was the Southern  attack, that the infantry also were driven back and  their guns taken.  The entire vanguard was routed, and as it received  no support, even Harry  and Dalton knew that the main army under  Shields had not yet come up. 
  &#8220;That was the closest shave I ever saw,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;So it was,&#8221;   said Harry.  &#8220;But just listen to that noise behind you!&#8221; 
  A tremendous roar and crash told them that the battle between Ewell  and  Fremont had opened.  Jackson beckoned to Harry, Dalton and the  members of  his staff who had reassembled.  The three, who were  captured,  subsequently escaped in the confusion and turmoil and  rejoined their  general.  Setting a powerful force to guard the bridge,  Jackson said to  his staff: 
  &#8220;While we are waiting for Shields to come up with his army, we'll  ride  over and see how the affair between Ewell and Fremont is coming  on.&#8221; 
  The roar and crash told them it was coming on with great violence,   but Fremont, so strong in pursuit was not so strong in action.  Now  that  he was face to face with the enemy, he did not attack with all  his might.  He hesitated, not from personal fear, but from fear on  account of his  army.  The whole force of Jackson might be in front of  him, and the  apprehensions that he did not feel in pursuit assailed  him when he looked  at the ridge covered with the enemy. 
  Harry and Dalton watched with breathless interest.  A portion of   Fremont's army, but not all of it, just when it was needed most, was  sent  to the charge.  Led by the pickets and skirmishers they came  forward  gallantly, a long line of glittering bayonets.  In the thick  woods on  their flank lay three Southern regiments, ambushed and not  yet stirring.  No sunlight penetrated there to show their danger to the  soldiers who  were breasting the slope. 
  Harry foresaw all, and he drew a long breath for brave men who were   marching to a certain fate. 
  &#8220;Why don't they look!  Why don't they look!&#8221; he found himself  exclaiming. 
  The next instant the entire wood burst into flame.  Picking their  aim and  firing at short range, the Southern riflemen sent sheet after  sheet of  bullets into the charging ranks.  It was more than human  blood and flesh  could stand, and the Northern regiments gave way.  But  it was not a rout.  They retreated on their reserves, and stood there  recovering themselves,  while the Southern riflemen reloaded, but did  not pursue.  The regiments  which had done the deadly work sank back in  the woods, and seemingly the  battle was over. 
  Harry had not been under fire.  He and Dalton, the rest of  Jackson's  staff and the general himself merely watched.  Nor did  Jackson give any  further orders to his able lieutenant, Ewell.  He  allowed him to make the  battle his own, and in Harry's opinion he was  making it right. 
  There came a silence that seemed interminably long to Harry.  The   sunlight blazed down, and the two armies stood looking at each other   across a field that was strewn with the fallen.  It would have been  folly  for the men in blue to charge again, and it was the chief  business of the  Southern troops to hold them back.  Therefore they  stood in their  positions and watched.  Harry judged that the bulk of  Fremont's army was  not yet up.  It was this failure to bring superior  numbers to bear at the  right time that was always the ruin of the  Northern generals in the  valley, because the genius on the other side  invariably saw the mistake  and profited by it. 
  Harry and Dalton still waited, wondering.  Jackson himself sat  quietly on  his horse, and issued no order.  The Northern troops were  motionless,  and Harry, who knew how precious time was, with the rest  of Fremont's  army coming up, wondered again.  But Trimble, the  commander of the  Southern riflemen hidden in the wood, saw a chance.   He would send his  men under cover of the forest and hurl them  suddenly upon the Northern  flank.  Ewell gave his consent, and said  that he would charge, too,  if the movement were successful. 
  Harry, watching, saw the Southern regiments in the wood steal from  the  forest, pass swiftly up a ravine, and then, delivering a  shattering fire  at short range, charge with the bayonet upon the  Northern flank.  The men  in blue, surprised by so fierce an onset,  gave way.  Uttering the rebel  yell, the Southerners followed and  pushed them further and further.  Ewell's quick eye, noting the  success, sent forward his own center in a  heavy charge. 
  Fremont, from the rear, hurried forward new troops, but they were  beaten  as fast as they arrived.  The batteries were compelled to  unlimber and  take to flight, the fresh brigade dispatched by Fremont  was routed,  and the whole Southern line pressed forward, driving the  Northern army  before it. 
  &#8220;General Jackson was wise in trusting to General Ewell,&#8221; said  Dalton to  Harry.  &#8220;He's won a notable victory.  I wonder how far he'll  push it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not far, I think.  All Ewell's got to do is to hold Fremont, and  he has  surely held him.  There's Shields on the other side of the  river with  whom we have to deal.  Do you know, George, that all the  time we've been  sitting here, watching that battle in front of us,  I've been afraid we'd  hear the booming of the guns on the other side  of the river, telling that  Shields was up.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We scorched their faces so badly there in Cross Keys that they  must be  hesitating.  Lord, Harry, how old Stonewall plays with fire.   To attack  and defeat one army with the other only a few miles away  must take nerves  all of steel.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But if Ewell keeps on following Fremont he'll be too far away when  we  turn to deal with Shields.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But he won't go too far.  There are the trumpets now recalling his  army.&#8221; 
  The mellow notes were calling in the eager riflemen, who wished to   continue the pursuit, but the army was not to retire.  It held the   battlefield, and now that the twilight was coming the men began to  build  their fires, which blazed through the night within sight of  those of the  enemy.  The sentinels of the two armies were within  speaking distance of  one another, and often in the dark, as happened  after many another battle  in this war, Yank and Reb passed a friendly  word or two.  They met, too,  on the field, where they carried away  their dead and wounded, but on such  errands there was always peace. 
  Those hours of the night were precious, but Fremont did not use  them.  Defeated, he held back, magnifying the numbers of his enemy,  fearing that  Jackson was in front of him with his whole army, and once  more out of  touch with his ally, Shields. 
  But Stonewall Jackson was all activity.  The great war-like  intellect was  working with the utmost precision and speed.  Having  beaten back Fremont,  he was making ready for Shields.  The first part  of the drama, as he had  planned it, had been carried through with  brilliant success, and he meant  that the next should be its equal. 
  Harry was not off his horse that night.  He carried message after  message  to generals and colonels and captains.  He saw the main  portion of  Ewell's army withdrawn from Fremont's front, leaving only a  single  brigade to hold him, in case he should advance at dawn.  But he  saw the  fires increased, and he carried orders that the men should  build them  high, and see that they did not go down. 
  When he came back from one of these errands about midnight, just  after  the rise of the moon, he found General Jackson standing upon the  bank of  the river, giving minute directions to a swarm of officers.   His mind  missed nothing.  He directed not only the movements of the  troops,  but he saw also that the trains of ammunition and food were  sent to the  proper points.  About half way between midnight and  morning he lay down  and slept in a small house near the river bank.   Shortly before dawn the  commander of a battery, looking for one of  his officers, entered the  house and saw Jackson, dressed for the  saddle, sword, boots, spurs and  all, lying on his face upon the bed,  asleep.  On a small table near him  stood a short piece of tallow  candle, sputtering dimly.  But the officer  saw that it was Jackson,  and he turned on tiptoe to withdraw. 
  The general awoke instantly, sat up and demanded who was there.   When the  officer explained, he said he was glad that he had been  awakened, asked  about the disposition of the troops, and gave further  commands.  He did  not go to sleep again. 
  But Harry's orders carried him far beyond midnight, and he had no  thought  of sleep.  Once more repressed but intense excitement had  complete hold  of him.  He could not have slept had the chance been  given to him.  The bulk of the army was now in front of Shields, and  the pickets were  not only in touch, but were skirmishing actively.   All through the late  hours after midnight Harry heard the flash of  their firing in front of  him. 
  The cavalry under Sherburne and other daring leaders were  exchanging  shots with the equally daring cavalry of the enemy. 
  As the dawn approached the firing was heavier.  Harry knew that the  day  would witness a great battle, and his heart was filled with  anxiety.  The army led by Shields showed signs of greater energy and  tenacity than  that led by Fremont.  The Northern troops that had  fought so fiercely at  Kernstown were there, and they also had leaders  who would not be daunted  by doubts and numbers.  Harry wondered if  they had heard of the defeat of  Fremont at Cross Keys. 
  He looked at the flashing of the rifles in the dusk, and before  dawn rode  back to the house where his commander slept.  He was ready  and waiting  when Jackson came forth, and Dalton appearing from  somewhere in the dusk,  sat silently on his horse by his side. 
  The general with his staff at once rode toward the front, and the  masses  of the Southern army also swung forward.  Harry saw that,  according to  Jackson's custom, they would attack, not wait for it.  It  was yet dusky,  but the firing in their front was increasing in  intensity.  There was a  steady crash and a blaze of light from the  rifle muzzles ran through the  forest. 
  He took an order to the Acadians to move forward behind two  batteries,  and as he came back he passed the Invincibles, now a mere  skeleton  regiment, but advancing in perfect order, the two colonels on  their  flanks near their head.  He also saw St. Clair and Langdon, but  he had  time only to wave his hand to them, and then he galloped back  to Jackson. 
  The dusk rapidly grew thinner.  Then the burnished sun rose over  the  hills, and Harry saw the Northern army before them, spread across  a level  between the river and a spur of the Blue Ridge, and also on  the slopes  and in the woods.  A heavy battery crowned one of the  hills, another was  posted in a forest, and there were more guns  between.  Harry saw that the  position was strong, and he noted with  amazement that the Northern forces  did not seem to outnumber  Jackson's.  It was evident that Shields,  with the majority of his  force was not yet up.  He glanced at Jackson.  He knew that the fact  could not have escaped the general, but he saw no  trace of exultation  on his face. 
  There was another fact that Harry did not then know.  Nearly all  the men  who had fought successfully against Jackson at Kernstown were  in that  vanguard, and Tyler, who had deemed himself a victor there,  commanded  them.  Everybody else had been beaten by Stonewall Jackson,  but not they.  Confident of victory, they asked to be led against the  Southern army,  and they felt only joy when the rising sunlight  disclosed their foe.  There were the men of Ohio and West Virginia  again, staunch and sturdy. 
  Harry knew instinctively that the battle would be fierce, pushed to  the  utmost.  Jackson had no other choice, and as the sunlight spread  over the  valley, although the mountains were yet in mist, the cannon  on the flanks  opened with a tremendous discharge, followed by crash  after crash,  North and South replying to each other.  A Southern  column also marched  along the slope of the hills, in order to take  Tyler's men in flank.  Harry looked eagerly to see the Northern troops  give way, but they held  fast.  The veterans of Ohio and West Virginia  refused to give ground,  and Winder, who led the Southern column, could  make no progress. 
  Harry watched with bated breath and a feeling of alarm.  Were they  to  lose after such splendid plans and such unparalleled exertions?   The sun,  rising higher, poured down a flood of golden beams, driving  the mists  from the mountains and disclosing the plain and slopes below  wrapped in  fire, shot through with the gleam of steel from the  bayonets. 
  Tyler, who commanded the Northern vanguard, proved himself here, as  at  Kernstown, a brave and worthy foe.  He, too, had eyes to see and a  brain  to think.  Seeing that his Ohio and West Virginia men were  standing fast  against every attack made by Winder, he hurried fresh  troops to their aid  that they might attack in return. 
  The battle thickened fast.  At the point of contact along the  slopes and  in the woods, there was a continued roar of cannon and  rifles.  Enemies  came face to face, and the men of Jackson, victorious  on so many fields,  were slowly pressed back.  A shout of triumph rose  from the Union lines,  and the eager Tyler brought yet more troops into  action.  Two of Ewell's  battalions heard the thunder of the battle and  rushed of their own accord  to the relief of their commander.  But they  were unable to stem the fury  of Ohio and West Virginia, and they were  borne back with the others,  hearing as it roared in their ears that  cry of victory from their foe,  which they had so often compelled that  foe himself to hear. 
  But it was more bitter to none than to Harry.  Sitting on his horse  in  the rear he saw in the blazing sunlight everything that passed.  He  saw  for the first time in many days the men in gray yielding.  The  incredible  was happening.  After beating Fremont, after all their  superb tactics,  they were now losing to Shields. 
  He looked at Jackson, hoping to receive some order that would take  him  into action, but the general said nothing.  He was watching the  battle  and his face was inscrutable.  Harry wondered how he could  preserve his  calm, while his troops were being beaten in front, and  the army of  Fremont might thunder at any moment on his flank or rear.   Truly the  nerves that could remain steady in such moments must be  made of steel  triply wrought. 
  The Northern army, stronger and more resolute than ever, was coming  on,  a long blue line crested with bayonets.  The Northern cannon,  posted well,  and served with coolness and precision, swept the  Southern ranks.  The men in gray retreated faster and some of their  guns were taken.  The Union troops charged upon them more fiercely than  ever, and the  regiments threatened to fall into a panic. 
  Then Jackson, shouting to his staff to follow, spurred forward into  the  mob and begged them to stand.  He rode among them striking some  with the  flat of his sword and encouraging others.  His officers  showed the same  energy and courage, but the columns, losing cohesion  seemed on the point  of dissolving, in the face of an enemy who pressed  them so hard.  Harry  uttered a groan which nobody heard in all the  crash and tumult.  His  heart sank like lead.  Hope was gone clean  away. 
  But at the very moment that hope departed he heard a great cheer,   followed a moment later by a terrific crash of rifles and cannon.   Then he saw those blessed Acadians charging in the smoke along the  slope.  They had come through the woods, and they rushed directly upon  the great  Northern battery posted there.  But so well were those guns  handled and  so fierce was their fire that the Acadians were driven  back.  They  returned to the charge, were driven back again, but coming  on a third  time took all the battery except one gun.  Then with  triumphant shouts  they turned them on their late owners. 
  The whole Southern line seemed to recover itself at once.  The  remainder  of Ewell's troops reached the field and enabled their  comrades to turn  and attack.  The Stonewall Brigade in the center,  where Jackson was,  returned to the charge.  In a few minutes fickle  fortune had faced about  completely.  The Union men saw victory once  more snatched from their  hands.  Their columns in the plain were being  raked by powerful batteries  on the flank, many of the guns having  recently been theirs.  They must  retreat or be destroyed. 
  The brave and skillful Tyler reluctantly gave the order to retreat,   and when Harry saw the blue line go back he shouted with joy.  Then  the  rebel yell, thrilling, vast and triumphant, swelled along the  whole line,  which lifted up itself and rushed at the enemy, the  cavalry charging  fiercely on the flanks. 
  Shields got up fresh troops, but it was too late.  The men in gray  were  pouring forward, victorious at every point, and sweeping  everything  before them, while the army of Fremont, arriving at the  river at noon,  saw burned bridges, the terrible battlefield on the  other side strewn  with the fallen, and the Southern legions thundering  northward in pursuit  of the second army, superior in numbers to their  own, that they had  defeated in two days. 
  Every pulse in Harry beat with excitement.  His soul sprang up at  once  from the depths to the stars.  This, when hope seemed wholly  gone,  was the crowning and culminating victory.  The achievement of  Jackson  equaled anything of which he had ever heard.  While the army  of Fremont  was held fast on the other side of the river, the second  army under  Shields, beaten in its turn, was retreating at a headlong  rate down the  valley.  The veterans of Kernstown had fought  magnificently, but they had  been outgeneralled, and, like all others,  had gone down in defeat before  Jackson. 
  Jackson, merciless alike in battle and pursuit, pushed hard after  the men  in blue for nine or ten miles down the river, capturing cannon  and  prisoners.  The Ohio and West Virginia men began at last to reform  again,  and night coming on, Jackson stopped the pursuit.  He still  could not  afford to go too far down the valley, lest the remains of  Fremont's army  appear in his rear. 
  As they went back in the night, Harry and Dalton talked together in  low  tones.  Jackson was just ahead of them, riding Little Sorrel,  silent,  his shoulders stooped a little, his mind apparently having  passed on from  the problems of the day, which were solved, to those of  the morrow,  which were to be solved.  He replied only with a smile to  the members of  his staff who congratulated him now upon his  extraordinary achievement,  surpassing everything that he had done  hitherto in the valley.  For Harry  and Dalton, young hero-worshippers,  he had assumed a stature yet greater.  In their boyish eyes he was the  man who did the impossible over and over  again. 
  The great martial brain was still at work.  Having won two fresh   victories in two days and having paralyzed the operations of his  enemies,  Jackson was preparing for other bewildering movements.  Harry  and Dalton  and all the other members of the staff were riding forth  presently in the  dusk with the orders for the different brigades and  regiments to  concentrate at Brown's Gap in the mountains, from which  point Jackson  could march to the attack of McClellan before Richmond,  or return to deal  blows at his opponents in the valley, as he pleased.   But whichever he  chose, McDowell and sixty thousand men would not be  present at the fight  for Richmond.  Jackson with his little army had  hurled back the Union  right, and the two Union armies could not be  united in time. 
  The whole Southern army was gathered at midnight in Brown's Gap,  and the  men who had eaten but little and slept but little in  forty-eight hours  and who had fought two fierce and victorious battles  in that time,  throwing themselves upon the ground slept like dead men. 
  While they slept consternation was spreading in the North.   Lincoln,  ever hopeful and never yielding, had believed that Jackson  was in  disorderly flight up the valley, and so had his Secretary of  War,  Stanton.  The fact that this fleeing force had turned suddenly  and beaten  both Fremont and Shields, each of whom had superior forces,  was  unbelievable, but it was true. 
  But Lincoln and the North recalled their courage and turned hopeful  eyes  toward McClellan.
