  In that moment Kent did not speak. He made no sound. He gave no   sign of welcome, but stood in the middle of his cell, staring. If   life had hung upon speech in those few seconds, he would have  died,  but everything he would have said, and more, was in his  face. The girl  must have seen it. With her two hands she was  gripping at the bars of  the cell and looking through at him. Kent  saw that her face was pale  in the lamp glow. In that pallor her  violet eyes were like pools of  black. The hood of her dripping  raincoat was thrown partly back, and  against the whiteness of her  cheeks her hair glistened wet, and her  long lashes were heavy with  the rain. 
  Kent, without moving over the narrow space between them, reached   out his hands and found his voice. &quot;Marette!&quot; 
  Her hands had tightened about the bars until they were bloodless.   Her lips were parted. She was breathing quickly, but she did not   smile; she made no response to his greeting, gave no sign even of   recognition. What happened after that was so sudden and amazing  that  his heart stopped dead still. Without warning she stepped  back from  the cell and began to scream and then drew away from  him, still facing  him and still screaming, as if something had  terrified her. 
  Kent heard the crash of a chair in the detachment office, excited   voices, and the running of feet. Marette Radisson had withdrawn to   the far corner of the alcove, and as Carter and Pelly ran toward  her,  she stood, a picture of horror, pointing at Kent's cell. The  two  constables rushed past her. Close behind them followed the  special  officer detailed to take Kent to Edmonton. 
  Kent had not moved. He was like one petrified. Close up against   the bars came the faces of Pelly, Carter, and the special  constable,  filled with the expressions of men who had expected to  look in upon  tragedy. And then, behind their backs, Kent saw the  other thing  happen. Swift as a flash Marette Radisson's hand went  in and out of  her raincoat, and at the backs of the three men she  was leveling a  revolver! Not only did Kent see that swift change,  but the still  swifter change that came into her face. Her eyes  shot to his just  once, and they were filled with a laughing,  exultant fire. With one  mighty throb Kent's heart seemed to leap  out through the bars of his  prison, and at the look in his face  and eyes Carter swung suddenly  around. 
  &quot;Please don't make any disturbance, gentlemen,&quot; said Marette   Radisson. &quot;The first man that makes a suspicious move, I shall  kill!&quot; 
  Her voice was calm and thrilling. It had a deadly ring in it. The   revolver in her hand was held steadily. It was a slim-barreled,  black  thing. The very color of it was menacing. And behind it were  the  girl's eyes, pools of flame. The three men were facing them  now,  shocked to speechlessness. Automatically they seemed to obey  her  command to throw up their hands. Then she leveled her grim  little gun  straight at Pelly's heart. 
  &quot;You have the key,&quot; she said. &quot;Unlock the cell!&quot; Felly fumbled and   produced the key. She watched him closely. Then suddenly the  special  constable dropped his arms with a coarse laugh. &quot;A pretty  trick,&quot; he  said, &quot;but the bluff won't work!&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, but it will!&quot; came the reply. 
  The little black gun was shifted to him, even as the constable's   fingers touched his revolver holster. With half-smiling lips,   Marette's eyes blazed at him. 
  &quot;Please put up your hands,&quot; she commanded. 
  The constable hesitated; then his fingers gripped the butt of his   gun. Kent, holding his breath, saw the almost imperceptible  tensing  of Marette's body and the wavering of Pelly's arms over  his head.  Another moment and he, too, would have called the bluff  if it were  that. But that moment did not come. From the slim,  black barrel of the  girl's revolver leaped forth a sudden spurt of  smoke and flame, and  the special constable lurched back against  the cell bars, caught  himself as he half fell, and then stood with  his pistol arm hanging  limp and useless at his side. He had not  made a sound, but his face  was twisted in pain. 
  &quot;Open the cell door!&quot; 
  A second time the deadly-looking little gun was pointed straight   at Pelly's heart. The half-smile was gone from the girl's lips  now.  Her eyes blazed a deeper fire. She was breathing quickly, and  she  leaned a little toward Pelly, repeating her command. The words  were  partly drowned in a sudden crash of thunder. But Pelly  understood. He  saw her lips form the words, and half heard, 
  &quot;Open the door, or I shall kill you!&quot; 
  He no longer hesitated. The key grated in the lock, and Kent   himself flung the door wide open and sprang out. He was quick to  see  and seize upon opportunity and swift to act. The astounding  audacity  of the girl's ruse, her clever acting in feigning horror  to line the  guards up at the cell door and the thrilling  decisiveness with which  she had used the little black gun in her  hand set every drop of blood  in his body afire. No sooner was he  outside his cell than he was the  old Jim Kent, fighting man. He  whipped Carter's automatic out of its  holster and, covering Pelly  and the special constable, relieved them  of their guns. Behind him  he heard Marette's voice, calm and  triumphant, 
  &quot;Lock them in the cell, Mr. Kent!&quot; 
  He did not look at her, but swung his gun on Pelly and the special   constable, and they backed through the door into the cell. Carter  had  not moved. He was looking straight at the girl, and the little  black  gun was leveled at his breast. Pelly and the wounded man did  not see,  but on Carter's lips was a strange smile. His eyes met  Kent's, and  there was revealed for an instant a silent flash of  comradeship and an  unmistakable something else. Carter was glad!  It made Kent want to  reach out and grip his hand, but in place of  that he backed him into  the cell, turned the key in the lock, and  with the key in his hand  faced Marette Radisson. Her eyes were  shining gloriously. He had never  seen such splendid, fighting  eyes, nor the birdlike swiftness with  which she turned and ran  down the hall, calling him to follow her. 
  He was only a step behind her in passing Kedsty's office. She   reached the outer door and opened it. It was pitch-dark outside,  and  a deluge of rain beat into their faces. He observed that she  did not  replace the hood of her raincoat when she darted out. As  he closed the  door, her hand groped to his arm and from that found  his hand. Her  fingers clung to his tightly. 
  He did not ask questions as they faced the black chaos of rain. A   rending streak of lightning revealed her for an instant, her bare   head bowed to the wind. Then came a crash of thunder that shook  the  earth under their feet, and her fingers closed more tightly  about his  hand. And in that crash he heard her voice, half  laughing, half  broken, saying, 
  &quot;I'm afraid&#8212;of thunder!&quot; 
  In that storm his laugh rang out, a great, free, joyous laugh. He   wanted to stop in that instant, sweep her up into his arms, and  carry  her. He wanted to shout like an insane man in his mad joy.  And a  moment before she had risked everything in facing three of  the bravest  men in the service and had shot one of them! He  started to say  something, but she increased her speed until she  was almost running. 
  She was not leading Jim in the direction of the river, but toward   the forest beyond Kedsty's bungalow. Not for an instant did she   falter in that drenched and impenetrable darkness. There was   something imperative in the clasp of her fingers, even though they   tightened perceptibly when the thunder crashed. They gave Kent the   conviction that there was no doubt in her mind as to the point she   was striving for. He took advantage of the lightning, for each  time  it gave him a glimpse of her bare, wet head bowed to the  storm, her  white profile, and her slim figure fighting over the  sticky earth  under her feet. 
  It was this presence of her, and not the thought of escape, that   exalted him now. She was at his side. Her hand lay close in his.  The  lightning gave him glimpses of her. He felt the touch of her  shoulder,  her arm, her body, as they drew close together. The life  and warmth  and thrill of her seemed to leap into his own veins  through the hand  he held. He had dreamed of her. And now suddenly  she had become a part  of him, and the glory of it rode  overwhelmingly over all other  emotions that were struggling in his  brain&#8212;the glory of the thought  that it was she who had come to  him in the last moment, who had saved  him, and who was now leading  him to freedom through the crash of  storm. 
  At the crest of a low knoll between barracks and Kedsty's bungalow   she stopped for the first time. He had there, again, the almost   irresistible impulse to reach out in the darkness and take her  into  his arms, crying out to her of his joy, of a happiness that  had come  to him greater even than the happiness of freedom. But he  stood,  holding her hand, his tongue speechless, and he was looking  at her  when the lightning revealed her again. In a rending flash  it cut open  the night so close that the hiss of it was like the  passing of a giant  rocket, and involuntarily she shrank against  him, and her free hand  caught his arm at the instant thunder  crashed low over their heads.  His own hand groped out, and in the  blackness it touched for an  instant her wet face and then her  drenched hair. 
  &quot;Marette,&quot; he cried, &quot;where are we going?&quot; 
  &quot;Down there,&quot; came her voice. 
  Her hand had left his arm, and he sensed that she was pointing,   though he could not see. Ahead of them was a chaotic pit of gloom,  a  sea of blackness, and in the heart of that sea he saw a light.  He knew  that it was a lamp in one of Kedsty's windows and that  Marette was  guiding herself by that light when she started down  the slope with her  hand still in his. That she had made no effort  to withdraw it made him  unconscious of the almost drowning  discomfort of the fresh deluge of  rain that beat their faces. One  of her fingers had gripped itself  convulsively about his thumb,  like a child afraid of falling. And each  time the thunder crashed  that soft hold on his thumb tightened, and  Kent's soul acclaimed. 
  They drew swiftly nearer to the light, for it was not far from the   knoll to Kedsty's place. Kent's mind leaped ahead. A little west  by  north from the inspector's bungalow was Kim's Bayou and it was   undoubtedly to the forest trail over which she had gone at least  once  before, on the night of the mysterious assault upon Mooie,  that  Marette was leading him. Questions began to rush upon him  now,  immediate demanding questions. They were going to the river.  They must  be going to the river. It was the quickest and surest  way of escape.  Had Marette prepared for that? And was she going  with him? 
  He had no time to answer. Their feet struck the gravel path   leading to the door of Kedsty's place, and straight up this path  the  girl turned, straight toward the light blazing in the window.  Then, to  his amazement, he heard in the sweep of storm her voice  crying out in  glad triumph, 
  &quot;We're home!&quot; 
  Home! His breath came in a sudden gulp. He was more than   astounded. He was shocked. Was she mad or playing an amazingly   improper joke? She had freed him from a cell to lead him to the  home  of the Inspector of Police, the deadliest enemy the world now  held for  him. He stopped, and Marette Radisson tugged at his hand,  pulling him  after her, insisting that he follow. She was clutching  his thumb as  though she thought he might attempt to escape. 
  &quot;It is safe, M'sieu Jeems,&quot; she cried. &quot;Don't be afraid!&quot; 
  M'sieu Jeems! And the laughing note of mockery in her voice! He   rallied himself and followed her up the three steps to the door.  Her  hand found the latch, the door opened, and swiftly they were  inside.  The lamp in the window was close to them, but for a space  he could not  see because of the water in his eyes. He blinked it  out, drew a hand  across his face, and looked at Marette. She stood  three or four paces  from him. Her face was very white, and she was  panting as if hard-run  for breath, but her eyes were shining, and  she was smiling at him. The  water was running from her in streams. 
  &quot;You are wet,&quot; she said. &quot;And I am afraid you will catch cold.   Come with me!&quot; 
  Again she was making fun of him just as she had made fun of him at   Cardigan's! She turned, and he ran upstairs behind her. At the top   she waited for him, and as he came up, she reached out her hand,  as  if apologizing for having taken it from him when they entered  the  bungalow. He held it again as she led him down the hall to a  door  farthest from the stair. This she opened, and they entered.  It was  dark inside, and the girl withdrew her hand again, and Kent  heard her  moving across the room. In that darkness a new and  thrilling emotion  possessed him. The air he was breathing was not  the air he had  breathed in the hall. In it was the sweet scent of  flowers, and of  something else&#8212;the faint and intangible perfume  of a woman's room. He  waited, staring. His eyes were wide when a  match leaped into flame in  Marette's fingers. Then he stood in the  glow of a lamp. 
  He continued to stare in the stupidity of a shock to which he was   not accustomed. Marette, as if to give him time to acquaint  himself  with his environment, was taking off her raincoat. Under  it her slim  little figure was dry, except where the water had run  down from her  uncovered head to her shoulders. He noticed that she  wore a short  skirt, and boots, adorably small boots of splendidly  worked caribou.  And then suddenly she came toward him with both  hands reaching out to  him. 
  &quot;Please shake hands and say you're glad,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't look   so&#8212;so&#8212;frightened. This is my room and you are safe here.&quot; 
  He held her hands tight, staring into the wonderful, violet eyes   that were looking at him with the frank and unembarrassed  directness  of a child's. &quot;I&#8212;I don't understand,&quot; he struggled.  &quot;Marette, where  is Kedsty?&quot; 
  &quot;He should be returning very soon.&quot; 
  &quot;And he knows you are here, of course?&quot; 
  She nodded. &quot;I have been here for a month.&quot; 
  Kent's hands closed tighter about hers. &quot;I&#8212;I don't understand,&quot;   he repeated. &quot;Tonight Kedsty will know that it was you who rescued  me  and you who shot Constable Willis. Good God, we must lose no  time in  getting away!&quot; 
  &quot;There is great reason why Kedsty dare not betray my presence in   his house,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;He would die first! And he will not   suspect that I have brought you to my room, that an escaped  murderer  is hiding under the very roof of the Inspector of Police!  They will  search for you everywhere but here! Isn't it splendid?  He planned it  all, every move, even to the screaming in front of  your cell&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You mean&#8212;Kedsty?&quot; 
  She withdrew her hands and stepped back from him, and again he saw   in her eyes a flash of the fire that had come into them when she   leveled her gun at the three men in the prison alcove. &quot;No, not   Kedsty. He would hang you, and he would kill me, if he dared. I  mean  that great, big, funny-looking friend of yours, M'sieu  Fingers!&quot;
