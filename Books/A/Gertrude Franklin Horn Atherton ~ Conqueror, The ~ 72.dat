The bombardment from Freneau's <i>Gazette</i> opened at once. It began with a  general assault upon the Administration, denouncing every prominent  member in turn as a monarchist or an aristocrat, and every measure as  subversive of the liberties of the country. Vice-President Adams  received a heavy broadside, his "Discourses on Davila," with their  animadversions upon the French Revolution in particular and Democracy in  general, being regarded as a heinous offence against the spirit of his  country, and detrimental to the political morals of the American youth.  But although the <i>Gazette</i> kept up its pretence of being an  anti-Administration organ, publishing in the interests of a deluded  people, it soon settled down to abuse of Hamilton.    
That a large number of the articles were from Jefferson's damning pen  few of the Republican leader's friends denied with any warmth, and the  natural deductions of history would have settled the question, had not  Freneau himself confessed the truth in his old age. What Jefferson did  not write, he or Madison inspired, and Freneau had a lively pen of his  own. They had promising material in General St. Clair's recent and  disastrous defeat by the Indians, which, by a triumph of literary  ingenuity, was ascribed to the ease and abundance with which the  Secretary of the Treasury had caused money to circulate. But a far  stronger weapon for their malignant use was the ruinous speculation  which had maddened the country since the opening of the Bank of the  United States. It was not enough that the Bank was a monarchical  institution, a machine for the corruption of the Government, a club of  grasping and moneyed aristocrats, but it had been purposely designed for  the benefit of the few--the "corrupt squadron," namely, the Secretary  and his friends--at the expense of the many. The subsequent failure for  $3,000,000 of one of these friends, William Duer, gave them no pause,  for his ruin precipitated a panic, and but added distinction to his  patron's villany.    
For a time Hamilton held his peace. He had enough to do, steering the  financial bark through the agitated waters of speculation, without  wasting time on personal recrimination. Even when, before the failure,  he was accused of being in secret partnership with Duer, he did not  pause for vindication, but exerted himself to alleviate the general  distress. He initiated the practice, followed by Secretaries of the  Treasury at the present moment, of buying Government loan certificates  in different financial centres throughout the country, thus easing the  money market, raising the price of the certificates, and strengthening  the public credit. He used the sinking-fund for this purpose.    
There was comparative peace in the Cabinet, an armed truce being,  perhaps, a more accurate description of an uneasy psychological  condition. Hamilton had made up his mind not only to spare Washington  further annoyance, if possible, but to maintain a dignity which he was  keenly conscious of having relinquished in the past. The two antagonists  greeted each other politely when they met for the first time in the  Council Chamber, although they had crossed the street several times  previously to avoid meeting; and if Jefferson discoursed unctiously and  at length, whenever the opportunity offered, upon the lamentable  consequences of a lamentable measure, and indulged in melancholy  prognostications of a general ruin, in which the Government would  disappear and be forgotten, Hamilton replied for a time with but an  occasional sarcasm, and a change of subject. One day, however, a  long-desired opportunity presented itself, and he did not neglect it. He  was well aware that Jefferson had complained to Virginia that he had  been made to hold a candle to the wily Secretary of the Treasury in the  matter of assumption, in other words, that his guileless understanding,  absorbed in matters of State, had been duped into a bargain of which  Virginia did not approve, despite the concession to the Potomac.    
About two months after Congress opened, Washington, as his Cabinet  seated itself, was detained in his room with a slight indisposition, but  sent word that he would appear presently. For a time, Randolph and Knox  talked feverishly about the Indian troubles, while Hamilton looked over  some notes, and Jefferson watched his antagonist covertly, as if  anticipating a sudden spring across the table. Hamilton was not in a  good humour. He was accustomed to abuse in Congress, and that it was  again in full tide concerned him little, for he was sure of ultimate  victories in both Houses; and words which were powerless to result in a  defeat for himself, or his party, he treated with the scorn which  impotence deserved. But it was another matter to have his private  character assailed day after day in the press, to watch a subtle pen  insinuate into the public mind that a woman imperilled her reputation in  receiving him, and that he was speculating in secret with the reckless  friend whom he had warned over and over, and begged to desist. Freneau  sent him three copies of the <i>Gazette</i> daily, lest he miss something,  and he had that morning left Betsey in tears. Fenno was fighting the  Secretary's battles valiantly; but there was only one pen in America  which could cope with Jefferson's, and that was Hamilton's own. But  aside from his accumulating cares, it was a strife to which he did not  care to descend. To-day, however, he needed but a match, and Jefferson,  who experienced a fearful fascination in provoking him, applied it.    
"I hear that Duer is on the verge of failure," he remarked sadly.    
"Yes," said Hamilton; "he is."    
"I hold it to be a great misfortune that he has been connected with the  Administration in any way."    
"His connection was quite distinct from your department. I alone was  responsible for his appointment as my assistant. There is no necessity  for you to shed any hypocritical tears."    
"What concerns the honour of the Administration naturally concerns the  Secretary of State."    
"There is no question of honour. If Duer fails, he will fail honourably,  and the Administration, with which he is no longer connected, will in no  way be involved."    
"Of those facts of course I am sure, but I fear the reflections in the  press."    
"Keep your own pen worthily employed, and the Administration will take  care of itself."    
"I do not understand you, sir," said Jefferson, with great dignity.    
"I am quite ready to be explicit. Keep your pen out of Freneau's  blackguard sheet, while you are sitting at Washington's right hand, at  all events--"    
Jefferson had elevated both hands. "I call Heaven to witness," he cried,  "this black aspersion upon my character is, has been, entirely a  production of the imagination of my enemies. I have never written nor  inspired a line in Mr. Freneau's paper."    
Hamilton laughed and returned to his notes.    
"You do not believe me, sir?" demanded Jefferson, the blood boiling  slowly to his large face.    
"No," said Hamilton; "I do not."    
Jefferson brought his mighty fist down upon the table with a bang."  Sir!" he exclaimed, his husky voice unpleasantly strained, "I have stood  enough from you. Are you aware that you have called me a liar, sir? I  have suffered at your hands since the day I set foot in this country. I  left the peace and retirement that I love, to come forth in response to  a demand upon my duty, a demand I have ever heeded, and what has been my  reward? The very first act I was tricked into committing was a crime  against my country--"    
"Were you in your dotage, sir?" thundered Hamilton, springing to his  feet, and bringing his own hand down with such violence that the lead in  his cuff dented his wrist. "Was your understanding enfeebled with age,  that you could not comprehend the exhaustive explanation I made of the  crisis in this country's affairs? Did I not give you twenty-four hours  in which to think it over? What were you doing--muddling your brains  with French wines?--that you could not reason clearly when relieved of  my baleful fascination? Were you not protected on the following day by  two men, who were more your friends than mine? I proposed a  straightforward bargain, which you understood as well then as you do  now. You realized to the full what the interests of the country  demanded, and in a rare moment of disinterested patriotism you agreed to  a compromise in which you saw no detriment to yourself. What you did not  anticipate was the irritation of your particular State, and the  annoyance to your vanity of permitting a younger man to have his way.  Now let me hear no more of this holding a candle, and the tricking of an  open mind by a wily one, unless you are willing to acknowledge that your  brain was too weak to grasp a simple proposition; in which case you had  better resign from public office."    
"I know that is what you are trying to force me to do," gasped  Jefferson, almost speechless between rage and physical fear; for  Hamilton's eyes were flashing, his body curved as if he meditated  immediate personal violence. "But I'll not do it, sir, any more than I  or anyone else will be deluded by the speciousness of your language. You  are an upstart. You have no State affinities, you despise them for a  very good reason--you come from God knows where--I do not even know the  name of the place. You are playing a game. You care nothing for the  country you were not born in. Unless you can be king, you would treat it  as your toy."    
"For your absurd personalities I care nothing," said Hamilton, reseating  himself. "They are but the ebullitions of an impotence that would ruin  and cannot. But take heed what you write, for in injuring the Secretary  of the Treasury you injure the prosperity of the country; and if you  push me too far, I'll expose you and make you infamous. Here comes the  President. For God's sake bottle your spite for the present."    
The two men did not exchange a remark during the rest of the sitting,  but Jefferson boiled slowly and steadily; Hamilton's words had raised  welts under which he would writhe for some time to come. When the  Cabinet adjourned he remained, and followed Washington into the library,  under cover of a chat about seeds and bulbs, a topic of absorbing  interest to both. When their legs were extended before the fire,  Jefferson said, as abruptly as if the idea had but just presented  itself:--    
"Mr. President, we are both Virginians, and had cut our wisdom  teeth--not that for a moment I class myself with you, sir--while young  Hamilton was still in diapers."    
"Children do not wear diapers in the West Indies," interrupted  Washington, in his gravest accents. "I spent some months on the Island  of Barbadoes, in the year seventeen hundred and fifty-one."    
"Was he born In the West Indies? I had never heard. But, if I may  continue, I have therefore summoned up my courage to speak to you on a  subject close to my heart--for no subject can be so close as the welfare  of a country to which we have devoted our lives."    
He paused a moment, prepared with an answer, did the President haughtily  warn him not to transgress the bounds of etiquette; but Washington was  staring at the fire, apparently recalling the scenery of the Tropics.    
Jefferson continued: "In the length and breadth of this Union there is  not a man, not even the most ardent Republican, who has not implicit  faith in the flawless quality of your patriotism and in your personal  wisdom; but, and possibly unknown to you, sir, the extreme and  high-handed measures, coupled with the haughty personal arrogance, of  our Secretary of the Treasury have inspired a widespread belief, which  is permeating even his personal friends, that he entertains subtle and  insidious monarchical designs, is plotting to convert our little  Republic into a kingdom. Personally, I do not believe this--"    
"I should hope not. You have always seemed to me to be a man of  singular wisdom and good sense. Therefore I feel sure that you are as  heartily sick of all this absurd talk about monarchism as I am. There is  not a word of truth in Mr. Hamilton's 'monarchical designs'; it is  impossible that you should not know this as well as I do. You must also  be as well aware that he has rendered services to this country which  will be felt as long as it remains united. It is doubtful if anyone else  could have rendered these same services, for, to my knowledge at least,  we have no man in the country who combines financial genius with an  unexampled boldness and audacity. He has emphatically been the man for  the hour, abruptly transferred from his remote birthplace, it has seemed  to me, by a special intervention of Providence; free of all local  prejudices, which have been, and will continue to be, the curse of this  country, and with a mettle unacted upon by years of doubt and  hesitation. I do no other man in public life an injustice in my warm  admiration of Mr. Hamilton's genius and absolute disinterestedness. Each  has his place, and is doing his part bravely and according to his  lights, many of them rendering historic services which Mr. Hamilton's  will not overshadow. His are equally indisputable. This unfortunate  result of establishing a National Bank was doubtless inevitable, and  will quickly disappear. That the Bank is a monarchical device, you, of  all men, are too wise to believe for a moment. Leave that for such  sensational scoundrels as the editors of this new <i>Gazette</i> and of other  papers. I regret that there is a personal antipathy between you and Mr.  Hamilton, but I have not the least doubt that you believe in his  integrity as firmly as I do."    
Jefferson was scowling heavily. "I am not so sure that I do, sir," he  said; inconsistent often in his calmest tempers, passion dissipated his  power of consecutive thought. "When Mr. Hamilton and I were on friendly  terms--before he took to annoying me with a daily exhibition of personal  rancour, from which I have been entirely free--he has often at my own  table avowed his admiration of the British Constitution, deprecated the  weakness of our own admirable instrument, tacitly admitted his regret  that we are a republic and not a kingdom. I have his very words in my  diary. He is committed out of his own mouth. I not only believe but know  him to be a lover of absolute monarchy, and that he has no faith that  this country can continue to exist in its present shape. It is for that  reason I hold him to be a traitor to the country with which he is merely  amusing himself."    
"Sir," said Washington, turning to Jefferson an immobile face, in which  the eyes were beginning to glitter, "is a man to be judged by his  private fancies or by his public acts? I know nothing of Mr. Hamilton's  secret desires. Neither, I fancy, do you. We do know that he has  resigned a brilliant and profitable practice at the bar to guide this  unfortunate country out of bankruptcy and dishonour into prosperity and  every promise of a great and honourable future. Pray let the matter rest  there for the present. If Mr. Hamilton be really a liar and a charlatan,  rest assured he will betray himself before any great harm is done. Every  man is his own worst enemy. I was deeply interested in what you were  saying when we entered this room. Where did you say you purchased those  lily bulbs? My garden is sadly behind yours, I fear. I certainly shall  enter upon an amiable rivalry with you next summer."    
And Jefferson knew better than to persist.
