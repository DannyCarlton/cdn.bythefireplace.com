This is a Hill-top Novel. I dedicate it to all who have heart  enough, brain enough, and soul enough to understand it.    
What do I mean by a Hill-top Novel? Well, of late we have been  flooded with stories of evil tendencies: a Hill-top Novel is one  which raises a protest in favour of purity.    
Why have not novelists raised the protest earlier? For this  reason. Hitherto, owing to the stern necessity laid upon the  modern seer for earning his bread, and, incidentally, for finding a  publisher to assist him in promulgating his prophetic opinions, it  has seldom happened that writers of exceptional aims have been able  to proclaim to the world at large the things which they conceived  to be best worth their telling it. Especially has this been the  case in the province of fiction. Let me explain the situation.  Most novels nowadays have to run as serials through magazines or  newspapers; and the editors of these periodicals are timid to a  degree which outsiders would hardly believe with regard to the  fiction they admit into their pages. Endless spells surround them.  This story or episode would annoy their Catholic readers; that one  would repel their Wesleyan Methodist subscribers; such an incident  is unfit for the perusal of the young person; such another would  drive away the offended British matron. I do not myself believe  there is any real ground for this excessive and, to be quite frank,  somewhat ridiculous timidity. Incredible as it may seem to the  ordinary editor, I am of opinion that it would be possible to tell  the truth, and yet preserve the circulation. A first-class journal  does not really suffer because two or three formalists or two or  three bigots among its thousands of subscribers give it up for six  weeks in a pet of ill-temper--and then take it on again. Still,  the effect remains: it is almost impossible to get a novel printed  in an English journal unless it is warranted to contain nothing at  all to which anybody, however narrow, could possibly object, on any  grounds whatever, religious, political, social, moral, or  aesthetic. The romance that appeals to the average editor must say  or hint at nothing at all that is not universally believed and  received by everybody everywhere in this realm of Britain. But  literature, as Thomas Hardy says with truth, is mainly the  expression of souls in revolt. Hence the antagonism between  literature and journalism.    
Why, then, publish one's novels serially at all? Why not appeal at  once to the outside public, which has few such prejudices? Why not  deliver one's message direct to those who are ready to consider it  or at least to hear it? Because, unfortunately, the serial rights  of a novel at the present day are three times as valuable, in money  worth, as the final book rights. A man who elects to publish  direct, instead of running his story through the columns of a  newspaper, is forfeiting, in other words, three-quarters of his  income. This loss the prophet who cares for his mission could  cheerfully endure, of course, if only the diminished income were  enough for him to live upon. But in order to write, he must first  eat. In my own case, for example, up till the time when I  published The Woman who Did, I could never live on the proceeds of  direct publication; nor could I even secure a publisher who would  consent to aid me in introducing to the world what I thought most  important for it. Having now found such a publisher--having  secured my mountain--I am prepared to go on delivering my message  from its top, as long as the world will consent to hear it. I will  willingly forgo the serial value of my novels, and forfeit  three-quarters of the amount I might otherwise earn, for the sake  of uttering the truth that is in me, boldly and openly, to a  perverse generation.    
For this reason, and in order to mark the distinction between these  books which are really mine--my own in thought, in spirit, in  teaching--and those which I have produced, sorely against my will,  to satisfy editors, I propose in future to add the words, "A Hill-  top Novel," to every one of my stories which I write of my own  accord, simply and solely for the sake of embodying and enforcing  my own opinions.    
Not that, as critics have sometimes supposed me to mean, I ever  wrote a line, even in fiction, contrary to my own profound beliefs.  I have never said a thing I did not think: but I have sometimes had  to abstain from saying many things I did think. When I wished to  purvey strong meat for men, I was condemned to provide milk for  babes. In the Hill-top Novels, I hope to reverse all that--to say  my say in my own way, representing the world as it appears to me,  not as editors and formalists would like me to represent it.    
The Hill-top Novels, however, will not constitute, in the ordinary  sense, a series. I shall add the name, as a Trade Mark, to any  story, by whomsoever published, which I have written as the  expression of my own individuality. Nor will they necessarily  appear in the first instance in volume form. If ever I should be  lucky enough to find an editor sufficiently bold and sufficiently  righteous to venture upon running a Hill-top Novel as a serial  through his columns, I will gladly embrace that mode of  publication. But while editors remain as pusillanimous and as  careless of moral progress as they are at present, I have little  hope that I shall persuade any one of them to accept a work written  with a single eye to the enlightenment and bettering of humanity.    
Whenever, therefore, in future, the words "A Hill-top Novel" appear  upon the title-page of a book by me, the reader who cares for truth  and righteousness may take it for granted that the book represents  my own original thinking, whether good or bad, on some important  point in human society or human evolution.    
Not, again, that any one of these novels will deliberately attempt  to <i>prove</i> anything. I have been amused at the allegations brought  by certain critics against The Woman who Did that it "failed to  prove" the practicability of unions such as Herminia's and Alan's.  The famous Scotsman, in the same spirit, objected to Paradise Lost  that it "proved naething": but his criticism has not been generally  endorsed as valid. To say the truth, it is absurd to suppose a  work of imagination can prove or disprove anything. The author  holds the strings of all his puppets, and can pull them as he  likes, for good or evil: he can make his experiments turn out well  or ill: he can contrive that his unions should end happily or  miserably: how, then, can his story be said to <i>prove</i> anything? A  novel is not a proposition in Euclid. I give due notice beforehand  to reviewers in general, that if any principle at all is "proved"  by any of my Hill-top Novels, it will be simply this: "Act as I  think right, for the highest good of human kind, and you will  infallibly and inevitably come to a bad end for it."    
Not to prove anything, but to suggest ideas, to arouse emotions,  is, I take it, the true function of fiction. One wishes to make  one's readers <i>think</i> about problems they have never considered, <i>feel</i>  with sentiments they have disliked or hated. The novelist as  prophet has his duty defined for him in those divine words of  Shelley's:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Singing songs unbidden <br> Till the world is wrought <br> To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not."</small></i></blockquote><br>
That, too, is the reason that impels me to embody such views as  these in romantic fiction, not in deliberate treatises. "Why sow  your ideas broadcast," many honest critics say, "in novels where  mere boys and girls can read them? Why not formulate them in  serious and argumentative books, where wise men alone will come  across them?" The answer is, because wise men are wise already: it  is the boys and girls of a community who stand most in need of  suggestion and instruction. Women, in particular, are the chief  readers of fiction; and it is women whom one mainly desires to  arouse to interest in profound problems by the aid of this vehicle.  Especially should one arouse them to such living interest while  they are still young and plastic, before they have crystallised and  hardened into the conventional marionettes of polite society. Make  them think while they are young: make them feel while they are  sensitive: it is then alone that they will think and feel, if ever.  I will venture, indeed, to enforce my views on this subject by a  little apologue which I have somewhere read, or heard,--or  invented.    
A Revolutionist desired to issue an Election Address to the Working  Men of Bermondsey. The Rector of the Parish saw it at the  printer's, and came to him, much perturbed. "Why write it in  English?" he asked. "It will only inflame the minds of the lower  orders. Why not allow me to translate it into Ciceronian Latin?  It would then be comprehensible to all University men; your logic  would be duly and deliberately weighed: and the tanners and  tinkers, who are so very impressionable, would not be poisoned by  it." "My friend," said the Revolutionist, "it is the tanners and  tinkers <i>I</i> want to get at. My object is, to win this election;  University graduates will not help me to win it."    
The business of the preacher is above all things to preach; but in  order to preach, he must first reach his audience. The audience in  this case consists in large part of women and girls, who are most  simply and easily reached by fiction. Therefore, fiction is today  the best medium for the preacher of righteousness who addresses  humanity.    
Why, once more, this particular name, "A Hill-top Novel"? For  something like this reason.    
I am writing in my study on a heather-clad hill-top. When I raise  my eye from my sheet of foolscap, it falls upon miles and miles of  broad open moorland. My window looks out upon unsullied nature.  Everything around is fresh and pure and wholesome. Through the open  casement, the scent of the pines blows in with the breeze from the  neighbouring firwood. Keen airs sigh through the pine-needles.  Grasshoppers chirp from deep tangles of bracken. The song of a  skylark drops from the sky like soft rain in summer; in the  evening, a nightjar croons to us his monotonously passionate love-  wail from his perch on the gnarled boughs of the wind-swept larch  that crowns the upland. But away below in the valley, as night  draws on, a lurid glare reddens the north-eastern horizon. It marks  the spot where the great wen of London heaves and festers. Up here  on the free hills, the sharp air blows in upon us, limpid and clear  from a thousand leagues of open ocean; down there in the crowded  town, it stagnates and ferments, polluted with the diseases and  vices of centuries.    
This is an urban age. The men of the villages, alas, are leaving  behind them the green fields and purple moors of their childhood,  are foolishly crowding into the narrow lanes and purlieus of the  great cities. Strange decadent sins and morbid pleasures entice  them thither. But I desire in these books to utter a word once more  in favour of higher and purer ideals of life and art. Those who  sicken of the foul air and lurid light of towns may still wander  side by side with me on these heathery highlands. Far, far below,  the theatre and the music-hall spread their garish gas-lamps. Let  who will heed them. But here on the open hill-top we know fresher  and more wholesome delights. Those feverish joys allure us not.  O decadents of the town, we have seen your sham idyls, your tinsel  Arcadias. We have tired of their stuffy atmosphere, their dazzling  jets, their weary ways, their gaudy dresses; we shun the sunken  cheeks, the lack-lustre eyes, the heart-sick souls of your painted  goddesses. We love not the fetid air, thick and hot with human  breath, and reeking with tobacco smoke, of your modern Parnassus--  a Parnassus whose crags were reared and shaped by the hands of the  stage-carpenter! Your studied dalliance with your venal muses is  little to our taste. Your halls are too stifling with carbonic acid  gas; for us, we breathe oxygen.    
And the oxygen of the hill-tops is purer, keener, rarer, more  ethereal. It is rich in ozone. Now, ozone stands to common oxygen  itself as the clean-cut metal to the dull and leaden exposed  surface. Nascent and ever renascent, it has electrical attraction;  it leaps to the embrace of the atom it selects, but only under the  influence of powerful affinities; and what it clasps once, it  clasps for ever. That is the pure air which we drink in on the  heather-clad heights--not the venomous air of the crowded casino,  nor even the close air of the middle-class parlour. It thrills and  nerves us. How we smile, we who live here, when some dweller in the  mists and smoke of the valley confounds our delicate atmosphere,  redolent of honey and echoing the manifold murmur of bees, with  that stifling miasma of the gambling hell and the dancing saloon!  Trust me, dear friend, the moorland air is far other than you  fancy. You can wander up here along the purple ridges, hand locked  in hand with those you love, without fear of harm to yourself or  your comrade. No Bloom of Ninon here, but fresh cheeks like the  peach-blossom where the sun has kissed it: no casual fruition of  loveless, joyless harlots, but life-long saturation of your own  heart's desire in your own heart's innocence. Ozone is better than  all the champagne in the Strand or Piccadilly. If only you will  believe it, it is purity and life and sympathy and vigour. Its  perfect freshness and perpetual fount of youth keep your age from  withering. It crimsons the sunset and lives in the afterglow. If  these delights thy mind may move, leave, oh, leave the meretricious  town, and come to the airy peaks. Such joy is ours, unknown to the  squalid village which spreads its swamps where the poet's silver  Thames runs dull and leaden.    
Have we never our doubts, though, up here on the hill-tops? Ay,  marry, have we! Are we so sure that these gospels we preach with  all our hearts are the true and final ones? Who shall answer that  question? For myself, as I lift up my eyes from my paper once more,  my gaze falls first on the golden bracken that waves joyously over  the sandstone ridge without, and then, within, on a little white  shelf where lies the greatest book of our greatest philosopher. I  open it at random and consult its sortes. What comfort and counsel  has Herbert Spencer for those who venture to see otherwise than the  mass of their contemporaries?    
"Whoever hesitates to utter that which he thinks the highest truth,  lest it should be too much in advance of the time, may reassure  himself by looking at his acts from an impersonal point of view.  Let him duly realise the fact that opinion is the agency through  which character adapts external arrangements to itself--that his  opinion rightly forms part of this agency--is a unit of force,  constituting, with other such units, the general power which works  out social changes; and he will perceive that he may properly give  full utterance to his innermost conviction; leaving it to produce  what effect it may. It is not for nothing that he has in him these  sympathies with some principles and repugnances to others. He,  with all his capacities, and aspirations, and beliefs, is not an  accident, but a product of the time. He must remember that while  he is a descendant of the past, he is a parent of the future; and  that his thoughts are as children born to him, which he may not  carelessly let die. He, like every other man, may properly consider  himself as one of the myriad agencies through whom works the  Unknown Cause; and when the Unknown Cause produces in him a certain  belief, he is thereby authorised to profess and act out that  belief. For, to render in their highest sense the words of the  poet--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> 'Nature is made better by no mean, <br> But nature makes that mean; over that art <br> Which you say adds to nature, is an art <br> That nature makes.'</small></i></blockquote><br>
"Not as adventitious therefore will the wise man regard the faith  which is in him. The highest truth he sees he will fearlessly  utter; knowing that, let what may come of it, he is thus playing  his right part in the world--knowing that if he can effect the  change he aims at--well: if not--well also; though not <i>so</i> well."    
That passage comforts me. These, then, are my ideas. They may be  right, they may be wrong. But at least they are the sincere and  personal convictions of an honest man, warranted in him by that  spirit of the age, of which each of us is but an automatic  mouthpiece.
