After Major Carter and Sally left, Betty had less freedom, for her  mother was lonely; moreover, she dared not leave Emory and Harriet too  much together. The danger still might be averted if she did her duty  and stood guard. She never had seen Jack look so well as he looked  this summer. The very gold of his hair seemed brighter, and his blue  eyes were often radiant. His beauty was conventional, but Betty could  imagine its potent effect on a girl of Harriet Walker's temperament  and limited experience. But he had appeared to prefer Sally's society  to Harriet's, and his spirits dropped after her departure.    
It was only when Harriet offered to read to Mrs. Madison and settled  down to three hours' steady work a day, that Betty allowed herself  liberty after the early morning. From five till eight in the evening  and for an hour or two before breakfast she roamed the forest or  pulled indolently about the lake. The hours suited her, for the hotel  people were little given to early rising; and although they boated  industriously by day, they preferred the lower and more fashionable  lake, and dined at half-past six.    
Life with her no longer was a smooth sailing on a summer lake. There  was a roar below, as if the lake rested lightly on a subterranean  ocean; and the very pines seemed to have developed a warning note.    
Harriet looked like a walking Fate, nothing less. Since Sally's abrupt  departure she had not smiled, and Betty knew that instinct divined and  explained the sudden aversion of a girl who did so much to add to the  cheerfulness of her friends. Emory also looked more like his  melancholy self, and wandered about with a volume of Pindar and an  expression of discontent. Did he love Harriet? and were her spirits  affecting his? Since Harriet's promise Betty felt that she had no  right to speak. He had weathered one love affair, he could weather  another. When Harriet was safe in Europe, she would turn matchmaker  and marry him to Sally Carter. Betty thought lightly of the  disappointments of men, having been the cause of many. So long as Jack  did not dishonour himself and his house by marriage with a proscribed  race, nothing less really mattered. But she played his favourite music  and strove to amuse him.    
She rallied him one day about the change in his spirits since the  departure of Sally Carter, and he admitted that he missed her, that he  always felt his best when with her.    
"Not that I love her more than I do you," he added, fearing that he  had been impolite. "But she strikes just that chord. She always makes  me laugh. She is a sort of sun and warms one up--"    
"The truth of the matter is that she strikes more chords than you will  admit. She's just the one woman you ought to marry. If you'd make up  your mind to love her, you'd soon find it surprisingly easy, and  wonder why it never had occurred to you before." Betty thought she  might as well begin at once.    
He shook his head, and his handsome face flushed. It was not a frank  face; he had lived too solitary and introspective a life for  frankness; but he met Betty's eyes unflinchingly.    
"She is not in the least the woman for me. She lacks beauty, and I  could not stand a woman who was gay--and--and staccato all the time.  It is delightful to meet, but would be insufferable to live with."    
"What is your ideal type?"    
He rose and raised her hand to his lips with all his old elaborate  gallantry. "Oh, Betty Madison! Betty Madison!" he exclaimed. "That you  should live to ask me such a question as that?"    
"I'd like to box his ears if he did not mean that," thought Betty. "I  particularly should dislike his attempting to blind me in that way."    
And herself? She asked this question more than once as she rowed  toward the northern end of the lake in the dawn, or in the heavier  shadows at the close of the day. Could it last? And how long? And did  he believe that it could last? Or was he, with the practical instinct  of a man of the world, merely determined to quaff that fragrant mildly  intoxicating wine of mental love-making, until the gods began to grin?    
She had many moods, but when a woman is sure that her love is returned  and is not denied the man's occasional presence, she cannot be unhappy  for long, perhaps never wholly so. For while there is love there is  hope, and while there is hope tears do not scald. Betty dared not let  her thought turn for a moment to Mrs. North. Her will was strong  enough to keep her mind on the high plane necessary to her self-  respect. She would not even ask herself if he knew how low the sands  had dropped in that unhappy life. The horizon of the future was thick  with flying mist. Only his figure stood there, immovable, always.    
"And it is remarkable how things do go on and on and on," she thought  once. "They become a habit, then a commonplace. It is because they are  so mixed up with the other details of life. Nothing stands out long by  itself. The equilibrium is soon restored, and unless one deliberately  starts it into prominence again, it stays in its proper place and  swings with the rest."    
She knew her greatest danger. She had it in her to be one of the most  intoxicating women alive. Was this man she loved so passionately to go  on to the end of his life only guessing what the Fates forbade him?  The years of the impersonal attitude to men which she had thought it  right to assume had made her anticipate the more keenly the freedom  which one man would bring her. She frankly admitted the strength of  her nature, she almost had admitted it to him; should she always be  able to control the strong womanly vanity which would give him  something more than a passing glimpse of the woman, making him forget  the girl? If she did anything so reprehensible, it would be the last  glimpse he would take of her, she reflected with a sigh, She wondered  that passion and the spiritual part of love should be so hopelessly  entangled. She was ready to live a life of celibacy for his sake; she  delighted in his mind, and knew that had it been commonplace she could  not have loved him did he have every other gift in the workshop of the  gods; she worshipped his strength of character, his independence, his  lofty yet practical devotion to an ideal; she loved him for his  attitude to his wife, the manly and uncomplaining manner with which he  accepted his broken and shadowed home life, when his temperament  demanded the very full of domestic happiness, and the heavy labours of  his days made its lack more bitter; and she sympathized keenly in his  love for and pride in his sons. There was nothing fine about him that  she did not appreciate and love him the more exaltedly for; and yet  she knew that had he been without strong passions she would have loved  him for none of these things. For of such is love between man and  woman when they are of the highest types that Nature has produced.  Betty hated the thought of sin as she hated vulgarity, and did not  contemplate it for a moment, but if she had roused but the calm  affection of this man she would have been as miserable as for the  hour, at least, she was happy.
