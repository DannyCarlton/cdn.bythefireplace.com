  When Robert revived the wind was still blowing hard, although there  had been some decrease in its violence, and it was yet night. He was  wet and very cold, and, as he arose, he shivered in a chill. The  greatcoat was still wrapped about his body, and although it was soaked  he always believed, nevertheless, that in some measure it had protected  him while he slept. The pistols, the ammunition and the sword were in  his belt, and he believed that the ammunition, fastened securely in a  pouch, was dry, though he would look into that later.
  He was quite sure that he had not been unconscious long, as the  appearance of the sky was unchanged. The bushes among which he had lain  were short but tough, and had run their roots down deeply into the  sand. They were friendly bushes. He remembered how glad he had been to  grasp them when he made that run from the surf, and to some extent they  had protected him from the cold wind when he lay among them like one  dead.
  The big rollers, white at the top, were still thundering on the  beach, and directly in front of him he saw a lowering hulk, that of the  schooner. The slaver's wicked days were done, as every wave drove it  deeper into the sand, and before long it must break up. Robert felt  that it had been overtaken by retributive justice, and, despite the  chill that was shaking him, he was shaken also by a great thrill of  joy. Wet and cold and on a desolate shore, he was, nevertheless, free.
  He began to run back and forth with great vigor, until he felt the  blood flowing in a warm, strong current through his veins again, and he  believed that in time his clothes would dry upon him. He took off the  greatcoat, and hung it upon the bushes where the wind would have a fair  chance at it, and he believed that in the morning it would be dry, too.  Then, finding his powder untouched by the water, he withdrew the wet  charges from the pistols and reloaded them.
  If he had not been seasoned by a life in the wilderness and  countless hardships he probably would have perished from exhaustion and  cold, but his strong, enduring frame threw off the chill, and he did  not pause for three full hours until he had made a successful fight for  his life. Then very tired but fairly warm he stopped for a while, and  became conscious that the wind had died to a great extent. The rollers  were not half so high and the hulk of the ship showed larger and  clearer than ever. He believed that when the storm ceased he could  board her and find food, if he did not find it elsewhere. Meanwhile he  would explore.
  Buckling on his pistols and sword, but leaving the greatcoat to  continue its process of drying, he walked inland, finding only a  desolate region of sand, bushes and salt marshes, without any sign of  human habitation. He believed it was the Jersey coast, and that he  could not be any vast distance from New York. But it seemed hopeless to  continue in that direction and being worn to the bone he returned to  his greatcoat, which had become almost dry in the wind.
  Now he felt that he must address himself to the need of the moment,  which was sleep, and he hunted a long time for a suitable lair. A high  bank of sand was covered with bushes larger and thicker than the  others, and at the back of the bank grew a tree of considerable size  with two spreading roots partly above ground. The sand was quite dry,  and he heaped it much higher along the roots. Then he lay down between  them, being amply protected on three sides, while the bushes waved over  his head. He was not only sheltered, he was hidden also, and feeling  safe, with the greatcoat, now wholly dry, wrapped around him, and the  pistols and sword beside him, he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
  The kindly fortune that had taken the lad out of such desperate  circumstances remained benevolent. The wind ceased entirely and the air  turned much warmer. Day soon came, and with it a bright cheerful sun,  that gilded the great expanse of low and desolate shore. The boy slept  peacefully while the morning passed and the high sun marked the coming  of the afternoon.
  He had been asleep about ten hours when he awoke, turned once or  twice in his lair and then stood up. It was a beautiful day, in  striking contrast with the black night of storm, and he knew by the  position of the sun that it was within about three hours of its  setting. He tested his body, but there was no soreness. He was not  conscious of anything but a ravening hunger, and he believed that he  knew where he could satisfy it.
  There was no wind and the sea was calm, save for a slight swell. The  schooner, its prow out of the water, was in plain view. It was so  deeply imbedded in the sand that Robert considered it a firm house of  shelter, until it should be broken to pieces by successive storms. But  at present he looked upon it as a storehouse of provisions, and he  hurried down the beach.
  His foot struck against something, and he stopped, shuddering. It  was the body of one of the slavers and presently he passed another. The  sea was giving up its dead. He reached the schooner, glad to leave  these ghastly objects behind him, and, with some difficulty, climbed  aboard. The vessel had shipped much water, but she was not as great a  wreck as he had expected, and he instantly descended to the cook's  galley, where he had given his brief service. In the lockers he found  an abundance of food of all kinds, as the ship had been equipped for a  long voyage, and he ate hungrily, though sparingly at first. Then he  went into the captain's cabin, lay down on a couch, and took a long and  luxurious rest.
  Robert was happy. He felt that he had won, or rather that Providence  had won for him, a most wonderful victory over adverse fate. His  brilliant imagination at once leaped up and painted all things in vivid  colors. Tayoga, Willet and the others must be terribly alarmed about  him as they had full right to be, but he would soon be back in New  York, telling them of his marvelous risk and adventure.
  Then he deliberated about taking a supply of provisions to his den  in the bushes, but when he went on deck the sun was already setting,  and it was becoming so cold again that he decided to remain on the  schooner. Why not? It seemed strange to him that he had not thought of  it at first. The skies were perfectly clear, and he did not think there  was any danger of a storm.
  He rummaged about, discovered plenty of blankets and made a bed for  himself in the captain's cabin, finding a grim humor in the fact that  he should take that sinister man's place. But as it was only three or  four hours since he had awakened he was not at all sleepy and he  returned to the deck, where he wrapped his treasure, the huge  greatcoat, about his body and sat and watched. He saw the big red sun  set and the darkness come down again, the air still and very cold.
  But he was snug and warm, and bethought himself of what he must  undertake on the morrow. If he continued inland long enough he would  surely come to somebody, and at dawn, taking an ample supply of  provisions, he would start. That purpose settled, he let his mind rest,  and remained in a luxurious position on the deck. The rebound from the  hopeless case in which he had seemed to be was so great that he was not  lonely. He had instead a wholly pervading sense of ease and security.  His imagination was able to find beauty in the sand and the bushes and  the salt marshes, and he did not need imagination at all to discover it  in the great, mysterious ocean, which the moon was now tinting with  silver. It was a fine full moon, shedding its largest supply of beams,  and swarms of bright stars sparkled in the cold, blue skies. A fine  night, thought Robert, suited to his fine future.
  It was very late, when he went down to the captain's cabin, ate a  little more food and turned in. He soon slept, but not needing sleep  much now, he awoke at dawn. His awakening may have been hastened by the  footsteps and voices he heard, but in any event he rose softly and  buckled on his sword and pistols. One of the voices, high and sharp, he  recognized, and he believed that once more he was the child of good  fortune, because he had been awakened in time.
  He sat on the couch, facing the door, put the sword by his side and  held one of the pistols, cocked and resting on his knee. The footsteps  and voices came nearer, and then the keen, cruel face appeared at the  door.
  &#8220;Good morning, captain,&#8221; said Robert, equably. &#8220;You left me in  command of the ship and I did my best with her. I couldn't keep her  afloat, and so I ran her up here on the beach, where, as you see, she  is still habitable.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're a good seaman, Peter,&#8221; said the captain, hiding any surprise  that he may have felt, &#8220;but you haven't obeyed my orders in full. I  expected you to keep the ship afloat, and you haven't done so.&#8221;
  &#8220;That was too much to expect. I see that you have two men with you.  Tell them to step forward where I can cover them as well as you with  the muzzle of this pistol. That's right. Now, I'm going to confide in  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Go ahead, Peter.&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't liked your manner for a long time, captain. I'm only  Peter Smith, a humble seaman, but since you left me in command of the  ship last night I mean to keep the place, with all the  responsibilities, duties and honors appertaining to it. Take your hands  away from your belt. This is a lone coast, and I'm the law, the judge  and the executioner. Now, you and the two men back away from the door,  and as sure as there's a God in Heaven, if any one of you tries to draw  a weapon I'll shoot him. You'll observe that I've two pistols and also  a sword. A sailor engaged in a hazardous trade like ours, catching and  selling slaves, usually learns how to use firearms, but I'm pretty good  with the sword, too, captain, though I've hid the knowledge from you  before. Now, just kindly back into the cook's galley there, and you and  your comrades make up a good big bag of food for me. I'll tell you what  to choose. I warn you a second time to keep your hands away from your  belt. I'll really have to shoot off a finger or two as a warning, if  you don't restrain your murderous instincts. Murder is always a bad  trade, captain. Put in some of those hard biscuits, and some of the  cured meats. No, none of the liquors, I have no use for them. By the  way, what became of Miguel, with whom I worked so often?&#8221;
  &#8220;He's drowned,&#8221; replied the captain.
  &#8220;I'm sorry,&#8221; said Robert, and he meant it. Miguel was the only one  on board the slaver who had shown a ray of human sympathy.
  &#8220;What do you mean to do?&#8221; asked the captain, his face contorted with  rage and chagrin.
  &#8220;First, I'll see that you finish filling that bag as I direct. Put  in the packages yourself. I like to watch you work, captain, it's good  for you, and after you fill the bag and pass it to me I'm going to hand  the ship back to you. I've never really liked her, and I mean to resign  the command. I think Peter Smith is fit for better things.&#8221;
  &#8220;So, you intend to leave the schooner?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, but you won't see me do it. Pass me the bag now. Be careful  with your hands. In truth, I think you'd better raise them above your  head, and your comrades can do the same. Quick, up with them, or I  shoot! That's right. Now, I'll back away. I'm going up the ladder  backward, and when I go out I intend to shove in place the grating that  covers the entrance to the deck there. You can escape in five minutes,  of course, but by that time I'll be off the ship and among the bushes  out of your reach. Oh, I know it's humiliating, captain, but you've had  your way a long time, and the slaver's trade is not a nice one. The  ghosts of the blacks whom you have caused to die must haunt you some  time, captain, and since your schooner is lost you'll now have a chance  to turn to a better business. For the last time I tell you to be  careful with your hands. A sailor man would miss his fingers.&#8221;
  He backed cautiously until his heels touched the ladder, meanwhile  watching the eyes of the man. He knew that the captain was consumed  with rage, but angry and reckless as he was he would not dare to reach  for a weapon of his own, while the pistol confronting him was held with  such a steady hand. He also listened for sounds made by other men on  the ship, but heard none. Then he began to back slowly up the stairway,  continuing his running address.
  &#8220;I know that your arms must be growing weary, captain,&#8221; he said, and  he enjoyed it as he said it, &#8220;but you won't have to keep 'em up much  longer. Two more steps will take me out upon the deck, and then you'll  be free to do as you please.&#8221;
  It was the last two steps that troubled him most. In order to keep  the men covered with the pistol he had to bend far down, and he knew  that when he could no longer bend far enough the danger would come. But  he solved it by straightening up suddenly and taking two steps at a  leap. He heard shouts and oaths, and the report of a pistol, but the  bullet was as futile as the cries. He slammed down the grating,  fastened it in an instant, ran to the low rail and swiftly lowered  himself and his pack over it and into the sand. Then he ran for the  bushes.
  Robert did not waste his breath. Having managed the affair of the  grating, he knew that he was safe for the present. So, when he reached  the higher bushes, he stopped, well hidden by them, and looked back. In  two or three minutes the captain and the two men appeared on the deck,  and he laughed quietly to himself. He could see that their faces were  contorted by rage. They could follow his trail some distance at least  in the sand, but he knew that they would be cautious. He had shown them  his quality and they would fear an ambush.
  He was justified in his opinion, as they remained on the deck,  evidently searching for a glimpse of him among the bushes, and, after  watching them a little while, he set out inland, bearing his burden of  weapons and food, and laughing to himself at the manner in which he had  made the captain serve him. He felt now that the score between them was  even, and he was willing to part company forever.
  Youth and success had an enormous effect upon him. When one triumph  was achieved his vivid temperament always foresaw others. Willet had  often called him the child of hope, and hope is a powerful factor in  victory. Now it seemed to him for a little while that his own rescue,  achieved by himself, was complete. He had nothing to do but to return  to New York and his friends, and that was just detail.
  He swung along through the bushes, forgetting the burden of his  weapons and his pack of food. In truth, he swaggered a bit, but it was  a gay and gallant swagger, and it became him. He walked for some  distance, feeling that he had been changed from a seaman into a  warrior, and then from a warrior into an explorer, which was his  present character. But he did not see at present the variety and  majesty that all explorers wish to find. The country continued low, the  same alternation of sand and salt marsh, although the bushes were  increasing in size, and they were interspersed here and there with  trees of some height.
  Reaching the crest of a low hill he took his last look backward, and  was barely able to see the upper works of the stranded schooner. Then  he thought of the captain and his exuberant spirits compelled him to  laugh aloud. With the chances a hundred to one against him he had  evened the score. While he had been compelled to serve the captain, the  captain in turn had been forced to serve him. It was enough to make a  sick man well, and to turn despair into confidence. He was in very  truth and essence the child of hope.
  Another low hill and from its summit he saw nothing but the bushy  wilderness, with a strip of forest appearing on the sunken horizon. He  searched the sky for a wisp of smoke that might tell of a human  habitation, below, but saw none. Yet people might live beyond the strip  of forest, where the land would be less sandy and more fertile, and,  after a brief rest, he pushed on with the same vigor of the body and  elation of the spirit, coming soon to firmer ground, of which he was  glad, as he now left no trail, at least none that an ordinary white man  could follow.
  He trudged bravely on for hours through a wilderness that seemed to  be complete so far as man was concerned, although its character  steadily changed, merging into a region of forest and good soil. When  he came into a real wood, of trees large and many, it was about noon,  and finding a comfortable place with his back to a tree he ate from the  precious pack.
  The day was still brilliant but cold and he wisely kept himself  thoroughly wrapped in the greatcoat. As he ate he saw a large black  bear walk leisurely through the forest, look at him a moment or two,  and then waddle on in the same grave, unalarmed manner. The incident  troubled Robert, and his high spirits came down a notch or two.
  If a black bear cared so little for the presence of an armed human  being then he could not be as near to New York as he had thought.  Perhaps he had been unconscious on the schooner a long time. He felt of  the lump which was not yet wholly gone from his head, and tried his  best to tell how old it was, but he could not do it.
  The little cloud in his golden sky disappeared when he rose and  started again through a fine forest. His spirits became as high as  ever. Looking westward he saw the dim blue line of distant hills, and  he turned northward, inferring that New York must lie in that  direction. In two hours his progress was barred by a river running  swiftly between high banks, and with ice at the edges. He could have  waded it as the water would not rise past his waist, but he did not  like the look of the chill current, and he did not want another wetting  on a winter day.
  He followed the stream a long distance, until he came to shallows,  where he was able to cross it on stones. His search for a dry ford had  caused much delay, but he drew comfort from his observation that the  stones making his pathway through the water were large and almost  round. He had seen many such about New York, and he had often marveled  at their smoothness and roundness, although he did not yet know the  geological reason. But the stones in the river seemed to him to be  close kin to the stones about New York, and he inferred, or at least he  hoped, that it indicated the proximity of the city.
  But he believed that he would have to spend another night in the  wilderness. Search the sky as he would, and he often did, there was no  trace of smoke, and, as the sun went down the zenith and the cold began  to increase, his spirits fell a little. But he reasoned with himself.  Why should one inured as he was to the forest and winter, armed,  provisioned and equipped with the greatcoat, be troubled? The answer to  his question was a return of confidence in full tide, and resolving to  be leisurely he looked about in the woods for his new camp. What he  wanted was an abundance of dead leaves out of which to make a nest.  Dead leaves were cold to the touch, but they would serve as a couch and  a wall, shutting out further cold from the earth and from the outside  air, and with the greatcoat between, he would be warm enough. He would  have nothing to fear except snow, and the skies gave no promise of that  danger.
  He found the leaves in a suitable hollow, and disposed them  according to his plan, the whole making a comfortable place for a  seasoned forester, and, while he ate his supper, he watched the sun set  over the wilderness. Long after it was gone he saw the stars come out  and then he looked at the particular one on which Tododaho, Tayoga's  patron saint, had been living more than four hundred years. It was  glittering in uncommon splendor, save for a slight mist across its  face, which must be the snakes in the hair of the great Onondaga  chieftain who he felt was watching over him, because he was the friend  of Tayoga.
  Then he fell asleep, sleeping soundly, all through the night, and  although he was a little stiff in the morning a few minutes of exercise  relieved him of it and he ate his breakfast. His journey toward the  north was resumed, and in an hour he emerged into a little valley, to  come almost face to face with the captain and the two sailors. They  were sitting on a log, apparently weary and at a loss, but they rose  quickly at his coming and the captain's hand slid down to his pistol.  Robert's slid to his, making about the same speed. Although his heart  pounded a moment or two at first he was surprised to find how soon he  became calm. It was perhaps because he had been through so many dangers  that one more did not count for much.
  &#8220;You see, captain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that neither has the advantage of the  other. I did not expect to meet you here, or in truth, anywhere else. I  left you in command of the schooner, and you have deserted your post.  When I held that position I remained true to my duty.&#8221;
  The captain, who was heavily armed, carrying a cutlass as well as  pistols, smiled sourly.
  &#8220;You're a lad of spirit, Peter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've always given you  credit for that. In my way I like you, and I think I'll have you to go  along with us again.&#8221;
  &#8220;I couldn't think of it. We must part company forever. We did it  once, but perhaps the second time will count.&#8221;
  &#8220;No, my crew is now reduced to two&#8212;the ocean has all the  others&#8212;and I need your help. It would be better anyway for you to come  along with us. This Acadia is a desolate coast.&#8221;
  There was a log opposite the one upon which they had been sitting  and Robert took his place upon it easily, not to say confidently. He  felt sure that they would not fire upon him now, having perhaps nothing  to gain by it, but he kept a calculating eye upon them nevertheless.
  &#8220;And so this is Acadia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I've been wondering what land it  might be. I did not know that we had come so far. Acadia is a long way  from New York.&#8221;
  &#8220;A long, long way, Peter.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you know the coast well, of course, captain?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course. I've made several voyages in the neighboring waters.  There's only one settlement within fifty miles of us, and you'd never  find it, it's so small and the wilderness is such a maze.&#8221;
  &#8220;The country does look like much of a puzzle, but I've concluded,  captain, that I won't go with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm persuaded that you're the very prince of liars, and in your  company my morals might be contaminated.&#8221;
  The man's face was too tanned to flush, but his eyes sparkled.
  &#8220;You're over loose with words, lad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it's an expensive  habit.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can afford it. I know as surely as we're sitting here facing each  other that this is not the coast of Acadia.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then what coast is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;That I know not, but taking the time, I mean to have, I shall find  out. Then I'll tell you if you wish to know. Where shall I deliver my  message?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think you're insolent. I say again that it's the coast of Acadia,  and you're going with us. We're three to your one, and you'll have to  do as I say.&#8221;
  Robert turned his gaze from the captain to his two men. While their  faces were far from good they showed no decision of character. He knew  at once that they belonged to the large class of men who are always  led. Both carried pistols, but he did not think it likely that they  would attempt to use them, unless the captain did so first. His gaze  came back to the tall man, and, observing again the heavy cutlass he  carried, a thought leaped up in his mind.
  &#8220;You wish me to go with you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I don't wish to go,  which leaves it an open question. It's best to decide it in clean and  decisive fashion, and I suggest that we leave it to your cutlass and my  sword.&#8221;
  The close-set eyes of the captain gleamed.
  &#8220;I don't want to kill you, but to take you back alive,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You were always a strong and handy lad, Peter, and I need your help.&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't kill me. That I promise you.&#8221;
  &#8220;You haven't a chance on earth.&#8221;
  &#8220;You pledge your word that your men will not interfere while the  combat is in progress, nor will they do so afterward, if I win.&#8221;
  &#8220;They will not stir. Remain where you are, lads.&#8221;
  The two sailors settled themselves back comfortably, clasping their  knees with their hands, and Robert knew that he had nothing to fear  from them. Their confidence in the captain's prowess and easy victory  was sufficient assurance. They were not to be blamed for the belief, as  their leader's cutlass was heavy and his opponent was only a youth. The  captain was of the same opinion and his mood became light and gay.
  &#8220;I don't intend to kill you, Peter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but a goodly cut or  two will let out some of your impertinent blood.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks, captain, for so much saving grace, because I like to live.  I make you the same promise. I don't want your death on my hands, but  there is poison in the veins of a man who is willing to be a slaver. I  will let it out, in order that its place may be taken by pure and  wholesome blood.&#8221;
  The captain frowned, and made a few swings with his cutlass. Then he  ran a finger along its keen edge, and he felt satisfied with himself. A  vast amount of rage and mortification was confined in his system, and  not charging any of it to the storm, the full volume of his anger was  directed against his cook's former assistant, Peter Smith, who was  entirely too jaunty and independent in his manner. He could not  understand Robert's presumption in challenging him to a combat with  swords, but he would punish him cruelly, while the two sailors looked  on and saw it well done.
  Robert put his pack, his greatcoat, his coat, and his belt with the  pistols and ammunition in a heap, and looked carefully to the sword  that he had taken from the captain's cabin. It was a fine weapon,  though much lighter than the cutlass. He bent the blade a little, and  then made it whistle in curves about his head. He had a purpose in  doing so, and it was attained at once. The captain looked at him with  rising curiosity.
  &#8220;Peter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you don't seem to be wholly unfamiliar with the  sword, and you nothing but a cook's helper.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's true, captain. The hilt fits lovingly into my hand. In my  spare moments and when nobody was looking I've often stolen this sword  of yours from the cabin and practiced with it. I mean now to make you  feel the result of that practice.&#8221;
  The captain gazed at him doubtfully, but in a moment or two the  confident smile returned to his eyes. It was not possible that a mere  stripling could stand before him and his cutlass. But he took off his  own coat which he had believed hitherto was a useless precaution.
  There was a level space about thirty feet across, and Robert, sword  in hand, advanced toward the center of it. He had already chosen his  course, which would be psychological as well as physical. He intended  that the battle should play upon the slaver's mind as well as upon his  body.
  &#8220;I'm ready, captain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don't keep us waiting. It's winter  as you well know, and we'll both grow cold standing here. In weather  like this we need work quick and warm.&#8221;
  The angry blood surged into the captain's face, although it did not  show through his tan. But he made an impatient movement, and stepped  forward hastily.
  &#8220;It can't be told of me that I kept a lad waiting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'll  warrant you you'll soon be warm enough.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we're both well suited, captain, and it should be a fine  passage at arms.&#8221;
  The two sailors, sitting on the log, looked at each other and  chuckled. It was evident to Robert that they had supreme confidence in  the captain and expected to see Peter Smith receive a lesson that would  put him permanently in his place. The mutual look and the mutual  chuckle aroused some anger in Robert, but did not impair his certainty  of victory. Nevertheless he neglected no precaution.
  The captain advanced, holding the heavy cutlass with ease and  lightness. He was a tall and very strong man, and Robert noted the look  of cruelty in the close-set eyes. He knew what he must expect in case  of defeat, and again telling himself to be careful he recalled all the  cunning that Willet had taught him.
  &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; he asked quietly.
  &#8220;Aye, Peter, and your bad quarter of an hour is upon you.&#8221;
  Again the two sailors on the log looked at each other and chuckled.
  &#8220;I don't think so, captain,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Perhaps the bad quarter  of an hour is yours.&#8221;
  He stared straight into the close-set cruel eyes so fixedly and so  long that the captain lowered his gaze, proving that the superior  strength of will lay with his younger opponent. Then he shook himself  angrily, his temper stirred, because his eyes had given way.
  &#8220;Begin!&#8221; said Robert.
  The captain slashed with the heavy cutlass, and Robert easily turned  aside the blow with his lighter weapon. He saw then that the captain  was no swordsman in the true sense, and he believed he had nothing to  fear. He waited until the man attacked again, and again he deftly  turned aside the blow.
  The two sailors sitting on the log looked at each other once more,  but they did not chuckle.
  Robert, still watching the close-set cruel eyes, saw a look of doubt  appear there.
  &#8220;My bad quarter of an hour seems to be delayed, captain,&#8221; he said  with irony.
  The man, stung beyond endurance, attacked with fury, the heavy  cutlass singing and whistling as he slashed and thrust. Robert  contented himself with the defense, giving ground slowly and moving  about in a circle. The captain's eye at first glittered with a  triumphant light as he saw his foe retreat, and the two sailors sitting  on the log and exchanging looks found cause to chuckle once more.
  But the light sank as they completed the circle, leaving Robert  untouched, and breathing as easily as ever, while the captain was  panting. Now he decided that his own time had come and knowing that the  combat was mental as well as physical he taunted his opponent.
  &#8220;In truth, captain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my bad quarter of an hour did not  arrive, but yours, I think, is coming. Look! Look! See the red spot on  your waistcoat!&#8221;
  Despite himself the captain looked down. The sword flickered in like  lightning, and then flashed away again, but when it was gone the red  spot on the waistcoat was there. His flesh stung with a slight wound,  but the wound to his spirit was deeper. He rushed in and slashed  recklessly.
  &#8220;Have a care, captain!&#8221; cried Robert. &#8220;You are fencing very wildly!  I tell you again that your play with the cutlass is bad. You can't see  it, but there is now a red spot on your cheek to match the one on your  waistcoat.&#8221;
  His sword darted by the other's guard, and when it came away it's  point was red with blood. A deep and dripping gash in the captain's  left cheek showed where it had passed. The two sailors sitting on the  log exchanged looks once more, but there was no sign of a chuckle.
  &#8220;That's for being a slaver, captain,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;It's a bad  occupation, and you ought to quit it. But your wound will leave a scar,  and you will not like to say that it was made by one whom you  kidnapped, and undertook to carry away to his death.&#8221;
  The captain in a long career of crime and cruelty had met with but  few checks, and to experience one now from the hands of a lad was  bitter beyond endurance. The sting was all the greater because of his  knowledge that the two sailors who still exchanged looks but no  chuckles, were witnesses of it. The blood falling from his left cheek  stained his left shoulder and he was a gruesome sight. He rushed in  again, mad with anger.
  &#8220;Worse and worse, captain,&#8221; said his young opponent. &#8220;You're not  showing a single quality of a swordsman. You've nothing but strength. I  bade you have a care! Now your right cheek is a match for your left!&#8221;
  The captain uttered a cry, drawn as much by anger as by pain. The  deep point of his opponent's sword had passed across his right cheek  and the red drops fell on both shoulders. The two sailors looked at  each other in dismay. The man paused for breath and he was a ghastly  sight.
  &#8220;I told you more than once to beware, captain,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but  you would not heed me. Your temper has been spoiled by success, but in  time nearly every slaver meets his punishment. I'm grateful that it's  been permitted to me to inflict upon you a little of all that's owing  to you. Wounds in the face are very painful and they leave scars, as  you'll learn.&#8221;
  He had already decided upon his finishing stroke, and his taunts  were meant to push the captain into further reckless action. They were  wholly successful as the man sprang forward, and slashed almost at  random. Now, Robert, light of foot and agile, danced before him like a  fencing master. The captain cut and thrust at the flitting form but  always it danced away, and the heavy slashes of his cutlass cut the  empty air, his dripping wounds and his vain anger making him weaker and  weaker. But he would not stop. Losing all control of his temper he  rushed continually at his opponent.
  The two sailors looked once more at each other, half rose to their  feet, but sat down again, and were silent.
  Now the captain saw a flash of light before him, and he felt a  darting pain across his brow, as the keen point of the sword passed  there. The blood ran down into his eyes, blinding him for the time. He  could not see the figure before him, but he knew that it was tense and  waiting. He groped with his cutlass, but touching only thin air he  threw it away, and clapped his hands to his eyes to keep away the  trickling blood.
  &#8220;You'll have three scars, captain,&#8221; came the maddening voice, &#8220;one  on each cheek and one on the forehead. It's not enough punishment for a  slaver, but, in truth, it's something. And now I'm going. You can't see  to follow me, or even to take care of yourself but I leave you in the  hands of your two sailors.&#8221;
  Robert put on his coat and greatcoat, resumed all his weapons and  his pack and turned away. The sailors were still sitting on the log,  gazing at each other in amazement and awe. Neither had spoken  throughout the duel, nor did they speak now. The victor did not look  back, but walked swiftly toward the north, glad that he had been the  instrument in the hands of fate to give to the slaver at least a part  of the punishment due him.
  He kept steadily on several hours, until he saw a smoke on the  western sky, when he changed his course and came in another half hour  to a small log house, from which the smoke arose. A man standing on the  wooden step looked at him with all the curiosity to which he had a  right.
  &#8220;Friend,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;how far is it to New York?&#8221;
  &#8220;About ten miles.&#8221;
  &#8220;And this is not the coast of Acadia.&#8221;
  &#8220;Acadia! What country is that? I never heard of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It exists, but never mind. And New York is so near? Tell me that  distance again. I like to hear it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ten miles, stranger. When you reach the top of the hill there you  can see the houses of Paulus Hook.&#8221;
  Robert felt a great sense of elation, and then of thankfulness.  While fortune had been cruel in putting him into the hands of the  slaver, it had relented and had taken him out of them, when the chance  of escape seemed none.
  &#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;you look grateful about something.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am. I have cause to be grateful. I'm grateful that I have my  life, I'm grateful that I have no wounds and I'm grateful that from the  top of the hill there I shall be able to see the houses of Paulus Hook.  And I say also that yours is the kindliest and most welcome face I've  looked upon in many a day. Farewell.&#8221;
  &#8220;Farewell,&#8221; said the man, staring after him.
  Two hours later Robert was being rowed across the Hudson by a  stalwart waterman. As he passed by the spot where his boat had been cut  down by the schooner he took off his hat.
  &#8220;Why do you do that?&#8221; asked the waterman.
  &#8220;Because at this spot my life was in great peril a few days ago, or  rather, here started the peril from which I have been delivered most  mercifully.&#8221;
  An hour later he stood on the solid stone doorstep of Master  Benjamin Hardy, important ship owner, merchant and financier. The  whimsical fancy that so often turned his troubles and hardships into  little things seized Robert again. He adjusted carefully his somewhat  bedraggled clothing, set the sword and pistols in his belt at a rakish  slant, put the pack on the step beside him, and, lifting the heavy  brass knocker, struck loudly. He heard presently the sound of footsteps  inside, and Master Jonathan Pillsbury, looking thinner and sadder than  ever, threw open the door. When he saw who was standing before him he  stared and stared.
  &#8220;Body o' me!&#8221; he cried at last, throwing up his hands. &#8220;Is it Mr.  Lennox or his ghost?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's Mr. Lennox and no ghost,&#8221; said Robert briskly. &#8220;Let me in, Mr.  Pillsbury. I've grown cold standing here on the steps.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you sure you're no ghost?&#8221;
  &#8220;Quite sure. Here pinch me on the arm and see that I'm substantial  flesh. Not quite so hard! You needn't take out a piece. Are you  satisfied now?&#8221;
  &#8220;More than satisfied, Mr. Lennox! I'm delighted, Overjoyed! We  feared that you were dead! Where have you been?&#8221;
  &#8220;I've been serving on board a slaver on the Guinea coast. That's a  long distance from here, and it was an exciting life, but I'm back  again safe and sound, Master Jonathan.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't understand you. You jest, Mr. Lennox.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so I do, but I tell you, Master Jonathan, I'm glad to be back  again, you don't know how glad. Do you hear me, Master Jonathan? The  sight of you is as welcome as that of an angel!&#8221;
  The air grew black before him, and he reeled and would have fallen,  but the strong arm of Jonathan Pillsbury caught him. In a moment or two  his eyes cleared and he became steady.
  &#8220;It was not altogether a pleasure voyage of yours,&#8221; said Master  Jonathan, dryly.
  &#8220;No, Mr. Pillsbury, it wasn't. But I came near fainting then,  because I was so glad to see you. Is Mr. Hardy here?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, he has gone to the Royal Exchange. He has been nigh prostrated  with grief, but I persuaded him that business might lighten it a  little, and he went out today for the first time. Oh, young sir, he  will be truly delighted to find that you have come back safely,  because, although you may know it not, he has a strong affection for  you!&#8221;
  &#8220;And I have a high regard for him, Master Jonathan. He has been most  kind to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come in, Mr. Lennox. Sit down in the drawingroom and rest yourself,  while I hurry forth with the welcome news.&#8221;
  Robert saw that his prim and elderly heart was in truth rejoiced,  and his own heart warmed in turn. Obscure and of unknown origin though  he might be, friends were continually appearing for him everywhere. A  servant took his weapons and what was left of his pack, Master Jonathan  insisted upon his drinking a small glass of wine to refresh himself,  and then he was left alone in the imposing drawing-room of Mr. Hardy.
  He sank back in a deep chair of Spanish leather, and shutting his  eyes took several long breaths of relief. He had come back safely and  his escape seemed marvelous even to himself. As he opened his eyes a  mild voice said:
  &#8220;And so Dagaeoga who went, no one knows where, has returned no one  knows how.&#8221;
  Tayoga, smiling but grave, and looking taller and more majestic than  ever, stood before him.
  &#8220;Aye, I'm back, and right glad I am to be here!&#8221; exclaimed Robert,  springing to his feet and seizing Tayoga's hand. &#8220;Oh, I've been on a  long voyage, Tayoga! I've been to the coast of Africa on a slaver,  though we caught no slaves, and I was wrecked on the coast of Acadia,  and I fought and walked my way back to New York! But it's a long tale,  and I'll not tell it till all of you are together. I hope you were not  too much alarmed about me, Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know that Dagaeoga is in the keeping of Manitou. I have seen too  many proofs of it to doubt. I was sure that at the right time he would  return.&#8221;
  Mr. Hardy came presently and then Willet. They made no display of  emotion, but their joy was deep. Then Robert told his story to them  all.
  &#8220;Did you see any name on the wrecked schooner?&#8221; asked Mr. Hardy.
  &#8220;None at all,&#8221; replied Robert. &#8220;If she had borne a name at any time  I'm sure it was painted out.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor did you hear the captain called by name, either?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir. It was always just 'captain' when the men addressed him.&#8221;
  &#8220;That complicates our problem. There's no doubt in my mind that you  were the intended victim of a conspiracy, from which you were saved by  the storm. I can send a trusty man down the North Jersey coast to  examine the wreck of the schooner, but I doubt whether he could learn  anything from it.&#8221;
  He drew Willet aside and the two talked together a while in a low  voice, but with great earnestness.
  &#8220;We have our beliefs,&#8221; said Willet at length, &#8220;but we shall not be  able to prove anything, no, not a thing, and, having nothing upon which  to base an accusation against anybody, we shall accuse nobody.&#8221;
  &#8220;'Tis the prudent way,&#8221; Hardy concurred, &#8220;though there is no doubt  in my mind about the identity of the man who set this most wicked pot  to brewing.&#8221;
  Robert had his own beliefs, too, but he remained silent.
  &#8220;We'll keep the story of your absence to ourselves,&#8221; said Mr. Hardy.  &#8220;We did not raise any alarm, believing that you would return, a belief  due in large measure to the faith of Tayoga, and we'll explain that you  were called away suddenly on a mission of a somewhat secret nature to  the numerous friends who have been asking about you.&#8221;
  Willet concurred, and he also said it was desirable that they should  depart at once for Virginia, where the provincial governors were to  meet in council, and from which province Braddock's force, or a  considerable portion of it, would march. Then Robert, after a  substantial supper, went to his room and slept. The next morning, both  Charteris and Grosvenor came to see him and expressed their delight at  his return. A few days later they were at sea with Grosvenor and other  young English officers, bound for the mouth of the James and the great  expedition against Fort Duquesne.
