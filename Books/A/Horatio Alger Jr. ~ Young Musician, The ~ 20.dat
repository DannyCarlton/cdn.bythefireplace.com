    Schoolhouse Hall, as may be inferred, was a large hall, occupying   the second story of the Center Schoolhouse, and though not  originally  intended for dancing-parties, answered very well for that  purpose. 
  The hall was tolerably well filled when Philip entered in company   with Jonas Webb and his wife. 
  Philip had effaced, as well as he could, the stains of travel, had   arrayed himself in a clean shirt and collar, brushed his hair  neatly,  and, being naturally a very good-looking boy, appeared to  very good  advantage, though he certainly did look young. 
  As he walked through the hall, with his violin under his arm, he   attracted the attention of all, it having been already made known   that in place of the veteran Paul Beck&#8212;a man of fifty or more&#8212;an   unknown boy would furnish the music for the evening. 
  Philip could not avoid hearing some of the remarks which his   appearance excited. &quot;What! that little runt play the fiddle?&quot; said   one countrified young man, in a short-waisted blue coat, and   tow-colored hair, plastered down on either side of his head with   tallow. &quot;I don't believe he can play any more than I can.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope he can,&quot; retained his partner&#8212;a plump, red-cheeked, young   farmer's daughter. &quot;He's very good-looking, anyhow.&quot; 
  &quot;He isn't anything to brag of,&quot; said her partner jealously. 
  &quot;Oh, how can you say so, Jedidiah. I See what beautiful black hair   and eyes he's got, and such a lovely color on his cheeks!&quot; 
  Now, Jedidiah, in appearance, was just the reverse of Philip. His   hair, as already stated, was tow-color, his face was tanned, and the   color rather resembled brick-dust than the deep red of our hero's   cheeks. 
  His partner was a rustic flirt, and he was disposed to be jealous,   not being certain how far she favored him. He, therefore, took   offense at his partner's admiration of the young fiddler. 
  &quot;He looks very common to me,&quot; said Jedidiah pettishly. &quot;You've got  a  strange taste, Maria.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven't,&quot; retorted Maria, tossing  her  head. 
  &quot;Perhaps you're in love with him?&quot; continued Jedidiah, in a tone   meant to be sarcastic, 
  &quot;I should be if he was a little older,&quot; said the young lady, rather   enjoying her lover's displeasure. 
  &quot;I don't believe he can play at all,&quot; growled Jedidiah. &quot;He's  fooled  Abner Webb, like as not. It's a pity we couldn't have Paul  Beck.&quot; 
  &quot;Very likely he can play better than Paul Beck,&quot; said Maria&#8212;not   because she thought so, but because she knew it would tease her   partner. 
  &quot;Don't be a fool, Maria,&quot; said Jedidiah, scarcely conscious of the   impoliteness of his speech. 
  The young lady, however, resented it at once. 
  &quot;I am sure you are very polite, Mr. Jedidiah Burbank&#8212;so polite  that  I think you had better find another partner!&quot; 
  &quot;Excuse me, Maria,&quot; said Jedidiah hastily, alarmed at the prospect   of being left without a partner. &quot;Of course, I didn't mean  anything.&quot; 
  &quot;If you didn't mean it, what made you say it?&quot; retorted Maria,   tossing her head. &quot;I ain't used to being called a fool. I never knew   a gentleman to make such a remark to a lady. I think you'd better   find some other partner.&quot; 
  &quot;I take it all back,&quot; said Jedidiah, in alarm. &quot;I was only in fun.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't like that kind of fun,&quot; said Maria, in a tone of dignified   coldness. 
  &quot;Then I won't joke you again. I guess he can play well enough, if   Abner says so.&quot; 
  Miss Maria Snodgrass allowed herself to be propitiated, more   especially as she herself might have been left without a partner,  had  she adhered to her determination and sent Jedidiah adrift. 
  He took his place in a quadrille, not exactly wishing Philip to   fail, but rather hoping that he would prove a poor performer, in   order that he might have a little triumph over Maria, who had the  bad  taste to prefer the young musician's appearance to his. 
  Meanwhile Philip, following Jonas Webb across the room, had been   introduced to Frank Ingalls, who acted as manager. 
  &quot;I am glad to see you, Mr. Gray,&quot; said Ingalls. &quot;I hope we sha'n't   make you work too hard. We are very fond of dancing here.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't get tired very easily,&quot; answered Philip. &quot;I hope you will   be satisfied with my playing.&quot; 
  &quot;No fear of that, Mr. Ingalls, I've heerd him play at home, and I   tell you he can do it.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Webb,&quot; said Philip, bowing his acknowledgment of  the  compliment. 
  &quot;I guess we may as well commence, Mr. Gray,&quot; said Mr. Ingalls. &quot;The   boys seem to be getting impatient. Here's the order of dances for  the  evening.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well, Mr. Ingalls.&quot; 
  The manager raised his voice, and said, &quot;Gentlemen and ladies, you   already know that Beck is sick, and cannot be with us this evening,   as he engaged to do. In his place we have engaged a young musician,   who has already gained a great reputation in his profession&#8212;&quot; 
  Philip was rather surprised to hear this, but it was not for him to   gainsay it. 
  &quot;Let me introduce to you Mr. Philip Gray.&quot; 
  Philip bowed and smiled, and, putting his violin in position,   immediately commenced a lively air. 
  In less than five minutes the manager felt perfectly at ease   concerning the young musician. It was clear that Philip understood   his business. Philip himself entered into the spirit of his   performance. His cheek flushed, his eyes sparkled, and he almost   outdid himself. 
  When the first dance was concluded, there was a murmur of approval   throughout the ballroom. The dancers were both surprised and  pleased. 
  &quot;He's a smart boy!&quot; said more than one. &quot;He plays as well as Paul   Beck, and Paul's been play-in' for more'n twenty years.&quot; 
  &quot;As well? I never heard Paul Beck play as well as that,&quot; said   another. 
  Among those who were most pleased was Miss Maria Snodgrass. 
  &quot;What do you think now, Mr. Burbank?&quot; she said, addressing her   partner. &quot;Do you think the boy can play now?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he can play most as well as Paul Beck,&quot; admitted Jedidiah. 
  &quot;Most as well? Paul Beck can't begin to play as well as him,&quot;   returned Maria, who was not educated, and occasionally made slips in   grammar. 
  &quot;Just as you say, Maria,&quot; answered Jedidiah, submissively; &quot;only   don't call me Mr. Burbank.&quot; 
  &quot;Why? Ain't that your name?&quot; asked the young lady demurely. 
  &quot;Not to you, Maria.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I won't, if you'll take me up and introduce me to Mr. Gray.&quot; 
  &quot;What for?&quot; asked Jedidiah jealously. 
  &quot;Because I want to know him.&quot; 
  Mr. Burbank was obliged to obey the request of his partner. 
  &quot;Oh, Mr. Gray, you play just lovely!&quot; said Miss Snodgrass   rapturously. 
  &quot;Thank you for the compliment,&quot; said Philip, with a low bow. 
  &quot;I like your playing ever so much better than Paul Beck's.&quot; 
  &quot;You are too kind,&quot; said Philip, with another bow. 
  &quot;Isn't he just lovely, Jedidiah!&quot; said Maria, as she walked away   with her lover. 
  &quot;Maybe he is&#8212;I ain't a judge!&quot; said Mr. Burbank, not very   enthusiastically. 
  So the evening passed. Philip continued to win the favorable  opinion  of the merry party by his animated style of playing. 
  When at half-past eleven the last dance was announced, he was glad,   for after his long walk, and the efforts of the evening, he felt   tired. 
  At the conclusion, Mr. Ingalls handed him three dollars, saying: 
  &quot;Here's your money, Mr. Gray, and we are much obliged to you   besides.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you!&quot; said our hero, carelessly slipping the money into his   vest pocket. 
  The manager little imagined that it constituted his entire capital. 
  &quot;I hope we may have you here again some time, Mr. Gray,&quot; continued   the manager. 
  &quot;Perhaps so,&quot; said Philip; &quot;but I am not sure when I shall come  this  way again.&quot; 
  &quot;Good night, Mr. Gray,&quot; said Miss Snodgrass effusively. &quot;I should  be  glad to have you call at our house.&quot; 
  Philip bowed his thanks. He did not notice the dark cloud on the   brow of the young lady's escort.
