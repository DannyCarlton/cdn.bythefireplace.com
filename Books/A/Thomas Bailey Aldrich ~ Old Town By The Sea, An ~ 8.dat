The running of the first train over the Eastern Road from Boston  to Portsmouth--it took place somewhat more than forty years  ago--was attended by a serious accident. The accident occurred in  the crowded station at the Portsmouth terminus, and was  unobserved at the time. The catastrophe was followed, though not  immediately, by death, and that also, curiously enough, was  unobserved. Nevertheless, this initial train, freighted with so  many hopes and the Directors of the Road, ran over and  killed--LOCAL CHARACTER.    
Up to that day Portsmouth had been a very secluded little  community, and had had the courage of its seclusion. From time to  time it had calmly produced an individual built on plans and  specifications of its own, without regard to the prejudices and  conventionalities of outlying districts. This individual was  purely indigenous. He was born in the town, he lived to a good  old age in the town, and never went out of the place, until he  was finally laid under it. To him, Boston, though only fifty-six  miles away, was virtually an unknown quantity--only fifty-six  miles by brutal geographical measurement, but thousands of miles  distant in effect. In those days, in order to reach Boston you  were obliged to take a great yellow, clumsy stage-coach,  resembling a three-story mud-turtle--if zoologist will, for the  sake of the simile, tolerate so daring an invention; you were  obliged to take it very early in the morning, you dined at noon  at Ipswich, and clattered into the great city with the golden  dome just as the twilight was falling, provided always the coach  had not shed a wheel by the roadside or one of the leaders had  not gone lame. To many worthy and well-to-do persons in  Portsmouth, this journey was an event which occurred only twice  or thrice during life. To the typical individual with whom I am  for the moment dealing, it never occurred at all. The town was  his entire world; he was a parochial as a Parisian; Market Street  was his Boulevard des Italiens, and the North End his Bois de  Boulogne.    
Of course there were varieties of local characters without his  limitations; venerable merchants retired from the East India  trade; elderly gentlewomen, with family jewels and personal  peculiarities; one or two scholarly recluses in by-gone cut of  coat, haunting the Athenaeum reading-room; ex-sea captains, with  rings on their fingers, like Simon Danz's visitors in  Longfellow's poem--men who had played busy parts in the bustling  world, and had drifted back to Old Strawberry Bank in the  tranquil sunset of their careers. I may say, in passing, that  these ancient mariners, after battling with terrific hurricanes  and typhoons on every known sea, not infrequently drowned  themselves in pleasant weather in small sail-boats on the  Piscataqua River. Old sea-dogs who had commanded ships of four or  five hundred tons had naturally slight respect for the  potentialities of sail-boats twelve feet long. But there was to  be no further increase of these odd sticks--if I may call them  so, in no irreverent mood--after those innocent-looking parallel  bars indissolubly linked Portsmouth with the capital of the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts. All the conditions were to be  changed, the old angles to be pared off, new horizons to be  regarded. The individual, as an eccentric individual, was to  undergo great modifications. If he were not to become extinct--a  thing little likely--he was at least to lose his prominence.    
However, as I said, local character, in the sense in which the  term is here used, was not instantly killed; it died a lingering  death, and passed away so peacefully and silently as not to  attract general, or perhaps any, notice. This period of gradual  dissolution fell during my boyhood. The last of the cocked hats  had gone out, and the railway had come in, long before my time;  but certain bits of color, certain half obsolete customs and  scraps of the past, were still left over. I was not too late, for  example, to catch the last town crier--one Nicholas Newman, whom  I used to contemplate with awe, and now recall with a sort of  affection.    
Nicholas Newman--Nicholas was a sobriquet, his real name being  Edward--was a most estimable person, very short, cross-eyed,  somewhat bow-legged, and with a bell out of all proportion to his  stature. I have never since seen a bell of that size disconnected  with a church steeple. The only thing about him that matched the  instrument of his office was his voice. His "Hear All!" still  deafens memory's ear. I remember that he had a queer way of  sidling up to one, as if nature in shaping him had originally  intended a crab, but thought better of it, and made a town-crier.  Of the crustacean intention only a moist thumb remained, which  served Mr. Newman in good stead in the delivery of the Boston  evening papers, for he was incidentally newsdealer. His authentic  duties were to cry auctions, funerals, mislaid children,  traveling theatricals, public meetings, and articles lost or  found. He was especially strong in announcing the loss of  reticules, usually the property of elderly maiden ladies. The  unction with which he detailed the several contents, when fully  confided to him, would have seemed satirical in another person,  but on his part was pure conscientiousness. He would not let so  much as a thimble, or a piece of wax, or a portable tooth, or any  amiable vanity in the way of tonsorial device, escape him. I have  heard Mr. Newman spoken of as "that horrid man." He was a  picturesque figure.    
Possibly it is because of his bell that I connect the town crier  with those dolorous sounds which I used to hear rolling out of  the steeple of the Old North every night at nine o'clock--the  vocal remains of the colonial curfew. Nicholas Newman has passed  on, perhaps crying his losses elsewhere, but this nightly tolling  is still a custom. I can more satisfactorily explain why I  associate with it a vastly different personality, that of Sol  Holmes, the barber, for every night at nine o'clock his little  shop on Congress Street was in full blast. Many a time at that  hour I have flattened my nose on his window-glass. It was a gay  little shop (he called it "an Emporium"), as barber shops  generally are, decorated with circus bills, tinted prints, and  gaudy fly-catchers of tissue and gold paper. Sol Holmes--whose  antecedents to us boys were wrapped in thrilling mystery, we  imagined him to have been a prince in his native land--was a  colored man, not too dark "for human nature's daily food," and  enjoyed marked distinction as one of the few exotics in town. At  this juncture the foreign element was at its minimum; every  official, from selectman down to the Dogberry of the watch, bore  a name that had been familiar to the town for a hundred years or  so. The situation is greatly changed. I expect to live to see a  Chinese policeman, with a sandal-wood club and a rice-paper  pocket handkerchief, patrolling Congress Street.    
Holmes was a handsome man, six feet or more in height, and as  straight as a pine. He possessed his race's sweet temper,  simplicity, and vanity. His martial bearing was a positive factor  in the effectiveness of the Portsmouth Greys, whenever those  bloodless warriors paraded. As he brought up the rear of the last  platoon, with his infantry cap stuck jauntily on the left side of  his head and a bright silver cup slung on a belt at his hip, he  seemed to youthful eyes one of the most imposing things in the  display. To himself he was pretty much "all the company." He used  to say, with a drollness which did not strike me until years  afterwards, "Boys, I and Cap'n Towle is goin' to trot out 'the  Greys' to-morroh." Though strictly honest in all business  dealings, his tropical imagination, whenever he strayed into the  fenceless fields of autobiography, left much to be desired in the  way of accuracy. Compared with Sol Holmes on such occasions,  Ananias was a person of morbid integrity. Sol Holmes's tragic end  was in singular contrast with his sunny temperament. One night,  long ago, he threw himself from the deck of a Sound steamer,  somewhere between Stonington and New York. What led or drove him  to the act never transpired.    
There are few men who were boys in Portsmouth at the period of  which I write but will remember Wibird Penhallow and his sky-blue  wheelbarrow. I find it difficult to describe him other than  vaguely, possibly because Wilbird had no expression whatever in  his countenance. With his vacant white face lifted to the clouds,  seemingly oblivious of everything, yet going with a sort of  heaven-given instinct straight to his destination, he trundled  that rattling wheelbarrow for many a year over Portsmouth  cobblestones. He was so unconscious of his environment that  sometimes a small boy would pop into the empty wheelbarrow and  secure a ride without Wibird arriving at any very clear knowledge  of the fact. His employment in life was to deliver groceries and  other merchandise to purchasers. This he did in a dreamy,  impersonal kind of way. It was as if a spirit had somehow go hold  of an earthly wheelbarrow and was trundling it quite  unconsciously, with no sense of responsibility. One day he  appeared at a kitchen door with a two-gallon molasses jug, the  top of which was wanting. It was not longer a jug, but a tureen.  When the recipient of the damaged article remonstrated with  "Goodness gracious, Wibird! You have broken the jug," his  features lighted up, and he seemed immensely relieved. "I  thought, " He remarked, "I heerd somethink crack!"    
Wibird Penhallow's heaviest patron was the keeper of a variety  store, and the first specimen of a pessimist I ever encountered.  He was an excellent specimen. He took exception to everything. He  objected to the telegraph, to the railway, to steam in all its  applications. Some of his arguments, I recollect, made a deep  impression on my mind. "Nowadays," he once observed to me, "if  your son or your grandfather drops dead at the other end of  creation, you know of it in ten minutes. What's the use? Unless  you are anxious to know he's dead, you've got just two or three  weeks more to be miserable in." He scorned the whole business,  and was faithful to his scorn. When he received a telegram, which  was rare, he made a point of keeping it awhile unopened. Through  the exercise of this whim he once missed an opportunity of buying  certain goods to great advantage. "There!" he exclaimed, "if the  telegraph hadn't been invented the idiot would have written to  me, and I'd have sent a letter by return coach, and got the goods  before he found out prices had gone up in Chicago. If that boy  brings me another of those tapeworm telegraphs, I'll throw an  axe-handle at him." His pessimism extended up, or down, to  generally recognized canons of orthography. They were all  iniquitous. If k-n-i-f-e spelled knife, then, he contended,  k-n-i-f-e-s was the plural. Diverting tags, written by his own  hand in conformity with this theory, were always attached to  articles in his shop window. He is long since ded, as he himself  would have put it, but his phonetic theory appears to have  survived him in crankish brains here and there. As my  discouraging old friend was not exactly a public character, like  the town crier or Wibird Penhallow, I have intentionally thrown a  veil over his identity. I have, so to speak, dropped into his  pouch a grain or two of that magical fern-seed which was supposed  by our English ancestors, in Elizabeth's reign, to possess the  quality of rendering a man invisible.    
Another person who singularly interested me at this epoch was a  person with whom I had never exchanged a word, whose voice I had  never heard, but whose face was as familiar to me as every day  could make it. For each morning as I went to school, and each  afternoon as I returned, I saw this face peering out of a window  in the second story of a shambling yellow house situated in  Washington Street, not far from the corner of State. Whether some  malign disease had fixed him to the chair he sat on, or whether  he had lost the use of his legs, or, possible, had none (the  upper part of him was that of a man in admirable health),  presented a problem which, with that curious insouciance of youth  I made no attempt to solve. It was an established fact, however,  that he never went out of that house. I cannot vouch so  confidently for the cobwebby legend which wove itself about him.  It was to this effect: He had formerly been the master of a large  merchantman running between New York and Calcutta; while still in  his prime he had abruptly retired from the quarter-deck, and  seated himself at that window--where the outlook must have been  the reverse of exhilarating, for not ten persons passed in the  course of the day, and the hurried jingle of the bells on Parry's  bakery-cart was the only sound that ever shattered the silence.  Whether it was an amatory or a financial disappointment that  turned him into a hermit was left to ingenious conjecture. But  there he sat, year in and year out, with his cheek so close to  the window that the nearest pane became permanently blurred with  his breath; for after his demise the blurr remained.    
In this Arcadian era it was possible, in provincial places, for  an undertaker to assume the dimensions of a personage. There was  a sexton in Portsmouth--his name escapes me, but his attributes  do not--whose impressiveness made him own brother to the massive  architecture of the Stone Church. On every solemn occasion he was  the striking figure, even to the eclipsing of the involuntary  object of the ceremony. His occasions, happily, were not  exclusively solemn; he added to his other public services that of  furnishing ice-cream for the evening parties. I always  thought--perhaps it was the working of an unchastened  imagination--that he managed to throw into his ice-creams a  peculiar chill not attained by either Dunyon or Peduzzi--arcades  ambo--the rival confectioners.    
Perhaps I should not say rival, for Mr. Dunyon kept a species of  restaurant, while Mr. Peduzzi restricted himself to preparing  confections to be discussed elsewhere than on his premises. Both  gentlemen achieved great popularity in their respective lines,  but neither offered to the juvenile population quite the charm of  those prim, white-capped old ladies who presided over certain  snuffy little shops, occurring unexpectedly in silent  side-streets where the football of commerce seemed an incongruous  thing. These shops were never intended in nature. They had an  impromptu and abnormal air about them. I do not recall one that  was not located in a private residence, and was not evidently the  despairing expedient of some pathetic financial crisis, similar  to that which overtook Miss Hepzibah Pyrcheon in The House of the  Seven Gables. The horizontally divided street door--the upper  section left open in summer--ushered you, with a sudden jangle of  bell that turned your heart over, into a strictly private hall,  haunted by the delayed aroma of thousands of family dinners.  Thence, through another door, you passed into what had formerly  been the front parlor, but was now a shop, with a narrow, brown,  wooden counter, and several rows of little drawers built up  against the picture-papered wall behind it. Through much use the  paint on these drawers was worn off in circles round the polished  brass knobs. Here was stored almost every small article required  by humanity, from an inflamed emery cushion to a peppermint  Gibraltar--the latter a kind of adamantine confectionery which,  when I reflect upon it, raises in me the wonder that any  Portsmouth boy or girl ever reached the age of fifteen with a  single tooth left unbroken. The proprietors of these little  knick-knack establishments were the nicest creatures, somehow  suggesting venerable doves. They were always aged ladies,  sometimes spinsters, sometimes relicts of daring mariners,  beached long before. They always wore crisp muslin caps and  steel-rimmed spectacles; they were not always amiable, and no  wonder, for even doves may have their rheumatism; but such as  they were, they were cherished in young hearts, and are, I take  it, impossible to-day.    
When I look back to Portsmouth as I knew it, it occurs to me that  it must have been in some respects unique among New England  towns. There were, for instance, no really poor persons in the  place; every one had some sufficient calling or an income to  render it unnecessary; vagrants and paupers were instantly  snapped up and provided for at "the Farm." There was, however, in  a gambrel-roofed house here and there, a decayed old gentlewoman,  occupying a scrupulously neat room with just a suspicion of  maccaboy snuff in the air, who had her meals sent in to her by  the neighborhood--as a matter of course, and involving no sense  of dependency on her side. It is wonderful what an extension of  vitality is given to an old gentlewoman in this condition!    
I would like to write about several of those ancient Dames, as  they were affectionately called, and to materialize others of the  shadows that stir in my recollection; but this would be to go  outside the lines of my purpose, which is simply to indicate one  of the various sorts of changes that have come over the vie  intime of formerly secluded places like Portsmouth--the  obliteration of odd personalities, or, if not the obliteration,  the general disregard of them. Everywhere in New England the  impress of the past is fading out. The few old-fashioned men and  women--quaint, shrewd, and racy of the soil--who linger in  little, silvery-gray old homesteads strung along the New England  roads and by-ways will shortly cease to exist as a class, save in  the record of some such charming chronicler as Sarah Jewett, or  Mary Wilkins, on whose sympathetic page they have already taken  to themselves a remote air, an atmosphere of long-kept lavender  and pennyroyal.    
Peculiarity in any kind requires encouragement in order to reach  flower. The increased facilities of communication between points  once isolated, the interchange of customs and modes of thought,  make this encouragement more and more difficult each decade. The  naturally inclined eccentric finds his sharp outlines rubbed off  by unavoidable attrition with a larger world than owns him.  Insensibly he lends himself to the shaping hand of new ideas. He  gets his reversible cuffs and paper collars from Cambridge,  Massachusetts, the scarabaeus in his scarf-pin from Mexico, and  his ulster from everywhere. He has passed out of the chrysalis  state of Odd Stick; he has ceased to be parochial; he is no  longer distinct; he is simply the Average Man.
