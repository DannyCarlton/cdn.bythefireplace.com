If Ernest and Edie had permitted it, Ronald Le Breton would have  gone at once, after his coming of age, to club income and expenditure  with his brother's household. But, as Edie justly remarked, when  he proposed it, such a course would pretty nearly have amounted to  clubbing <i>his</i> income with <i>their</i> expenditure; and even in their last  extreme of poverty that was an injustice which neither she nor her  husband could possibly permit. Ronald needed all his little fortune  for his own simple wants, and though they themselves starved,  they couldn't bear to deprive him of the small luxuries which had  grown into absolute necessaries for one so feeble and weak. Indeed,  ill as Ernest himself now was, he had never outgrown the fixed  habit of regarding Ronald as the invalid of the family; and to have  taken anything, though in the direst straits, from him, would have  seemed like robbing the helpless poor of their bare necessities.  So Ronald was fain at last to take lodgings for himself with  a neighbour of good Mrs. Halliss's, and only to share in Ernest's  troubles to the small extent of an occasional loan, which Edie  would have repaid to time if she had to go without their own poor  little dinner for the sake of the repayment.    
Meanwhile, Ronald had another interest on hand which to his  enthusiastic nature seemed directly imposed upon him by the finger  of Providence--to provide a home and occupation for poor Selah,  whom Herbert had cast aside as a legacy to him. As soon as he  had got settled down to his own new mode of life in the Holloway  lodgings, he began to look about for a fit place for the homeless  girl--a place, he thought to himself, which must combine several  special advantages; plenty of work--she wanted that to take her  mind off brooding; good, honest, upright people; and above all, no  religion. Ronald recognised that last undoubted requirement as of  absolutely paramount importance. 'She'll stand any amount of talk  or anything else from me,' he said to himself often, 'because she  knows I'm really in earnest; but she wouldn't stand it for a moment  from those well-meaning, undiscriminating, religious busy-bodies,  who are so awfully anxious about other people's souls, though  they never seem for a single minute to consider in any way other  people's feelings.' After a little careful hunting among his  various acquaintances, however, he found at last a place that would  exactly suit Selah at a stationer's in Netting Hill; and there he  put her--with full confidence that Selah would do the work entrusted  to her well and ably, if not from conscientiousness, at least from  personal pride, 'which, after all,' Roland soliloquised dreamily,  'is as good a substitute for the genuine article as one can  reasonably expect to find in poor fallen human nature.'    
'I wish, Mr. Le Breton,' Selah said, quite timidly for her (maidenly  reserve, it must be admitted, was not one of Selah Briggs's strong  points), 'that I wasn't going to be quite so far from you as Notting  Hill. If I could see you sometimes, you know, I should feel that  it might keep me more straight--keep me away from the river in  future, I mean. I can't stand most people's preaching, but somehow,  your preaching seems to do me more good than harm, really, which is  just the exact opposite way, it seems to me, from everybody else's.'    
Ronald smiled sedately. 'I'm glad you want to see me sometimes,'  he said, with a touch of something very like gallantry in his tone  that was wholly unusual with him. 'I shall walk over every now and  then, and look you up at your lodgings over yonder; and besides,  you can come on Sundays to dear Edie's, and I shall be able to  meet you there once a fortnight or thereabouts. But I'm not going  to let you call me Mr. Le Breton any longer; it isn't friendly:  and, what's more, it isn't Christian. Why should there be these  artificial barriers between soul and soul, eh, Selah? I shall  call you Selah in future: it seems more genuine and heartfelt, and  unencumbered with needless conventions, than your misters and  misses. After all, why should we keep up such idle formalities  between brethren and fellow-workers?'    
Selah started a little--she knew better than Ronald himself did  what such first advances really led to. 'Oh, Mr. Le Breton,' she  said quickly, 'I really can't call you Ronald. I can never call  any other man by his Christian name as long as I live, after--your  brother.'    
'You mistake me, Selah,' Ronald put in hastily, with his quaint  gravity. 'I mean it merely as a sign of confidence and a mark of  Christian friendship. Sisters call their brothers by their Christian  names, don't they? So there can be no harm in that, surely. It seems  to me that if you call me Mr. Le Breton, you're putting me on the  footing of a man merely; if you call me Ronald, you're putting me  on the footing of a brother, which is really a much more harmless  and unequivocal position for me to stand in. Do, please, Selah,  call me Ronald.'    
'I'm afraid I can't,' Selah answered. 'I daren't. I mustn't.' But  she faltered a little for a moment, notwithstanding.    
'You must, Selah,' Ronald said, with all the force of his enthusiastic  nature, fixing his piercing eyes full upon her. 'You must, I tell  you. Call me Ronald.'    
'Very well--Ronald,' Selah said at last, after a long pause.  'Good-bye, now. I must be going. Good-bye, and thank you. Thank  you. Thank you.' There was a tear quivering even in Selah Briggs's  eye, as she held his hand lingeringly a moment in hers before  releasing it. He was a very good fellow, really, and he had been  so very kind, too, in interesting himself about her future.    
'What a marvellous thread of sameness,' Ronald thought to himself,  as he walked back rapidly to his solitary lodgings, 'runs through  the warp and woof of a single family, after all! What an underlying  unity of texture there must be throughout, in all its members,  however outwardly dissimilar they may seem to be from one another!  One would say at first sight there was very little, if anything,  in common between me and Herbert. And yet this girl interests me  wonderfully. Of course I'm not in love with her--the notion of  <i>my</i> falling in love with anybody is clearly too ridiculous. But I'm  attracted by her, drawn towards her, fascinated as it were; I feel  a sort of curious spell upon me whenever I look into her deep big  eyes, flashing out upon one with their strange luminousness. It  isn't merely that the Hand has thrown her in my way: that counts  for something, no doubt, but not for everything. Besides, the  Hand doesn't act blindly--nay, rather, acts with supreme wisdom,  surpassing the powers or the comprehension of man. When it threw  Selah Briggs in my way, depend upon it, it was because the Infinite  saw in me something that was specially adapted to her, and in her  something that was specially adapted to me. The instrument is duly  shaped by inscrutable Wisdom for its own proper work. Now, whatever  interests <i>me</i> in her, must have also interested Herbert in her  equally and for the same reason. We're drawn towards her, clearly;  she exercises over both of us some curious electric power that she  doesn't exercise, presumably, over other people. For Herbert must  have been really in love with her--not that I'm in love with her,  of course; but still, the phenomena are analogous, even if on  a slightly different plane--Herbert must have been really in love  with her, I'm sure, or such a prudent man as he is would never have  let himself get into what he would consider such a dangerous and  difficult entanglement. Yes, clearly, there's something in Selah  Briggs that seems to possess a singular polarity, as Ernest would  call it, for the Le Breton character and individuality!    
'And then, it cuts both ways, too, for Selah was once desperately  in love with Herbert: of that I'm certain. She must have been, to  judge from the mere strength of the final revulsion. She's a girl  of intensely deep passions--I like people to have some depth to  their character, even if it's only in the way of passion--and she'd  never have loved him at all without loving him fervently and almost  wildly: hers is a fervent, wild, indomitable nature. Yes, she was  certainly in love with Herbert; and now, though of course I don't  mean to say she's in love with me (I hope it isn't wrong to think  in this way about an unmarried girl), still I can't help seeing  that I have a certain influence over her in return--that she pays  much attention to what I say and think, considers me a person  worth considering, which she doesn't do, I'm sure, with most other  people. Ah, well, there's a vast deal of truth, no doubt, in these  new hereditary doctrines of Darwin's and Galton's that Herbert  and Ernest talk about so much; a family's a family, that's certain,  not a mere stray collection of casual acquaintances. How the  likeness runs through the very inmost structure of our hearts and  natures! I see in Selah very much what Herbert saw in Selah: Selah  sees in me very much what she saw in Herbert. Extraordinary insight  into human nature men like Darwin and Galton have, to be sure? And  David, too, what a marvellous thinker he was, really! What unfathomed  depths of meaning lie unexpected in that simple sentence of his,  "I am fearfully and wonderfully made." Fearfully and wonderfully,  indeed, when one remembers that from one father and mother Herbert  and I have both been compounded, so unlike in some things that we  scarcely seem to be comparable with one another (look at Herbert's  splendid intellect beside mine!), so like in others that Selah  Briggs--goodness gracious, what am I thinking of? I was just going  to say that Selah Briggs falls in love first with one of us and  then with the other. I do hope and trust it isn't wrong of me to  fill my poor distracted head so much with these odd thoughts about  that unfortunate girl, Selah!'
