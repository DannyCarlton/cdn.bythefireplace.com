  And each day thereafter the sun rose earlier, and the day was  longer, and the air was warmer; and with the warmth there now came the  sweet scents of the budding earth and the myriad sounds of the deep,  unseen life of the forests, awakening from its long slumber in its bed  of snow. The moose-birds chirped their mating songs and flirted from  morning till night in bough and air, and the jays and ravens fluffed  themselves in the sun, and the snowbirds, little black and white  beauties that were wont to whisk about like so many flashing gems,  became fewer and fewer, until they were gone altogether. The poplar  buds swelled more and more in their joy, until they split like over-fat  peas, and the partridges feasted upon them.
  And Mother Bear came out of her winter den, accompanied by her  little ones born two months before, and taught them how to pull down  the slender saplings for these same buds; and the moose came down from  the blizzardy tops of the great ridges, which are called mountains in  the North, and where for good reasons they had passed the winter,  followed by the wolves, who fed upon their weak and sick. Everywhere  there were the rushing torrents of melting snows, the crackle of  crumbling ice, the dying frost-cries of rock and earth and tree, and  each night the cold, pale glow of the Aurora Borealis crept farther and  farther toward the Pole in fading glory.
  It was spring, and at Wabinosh House it brought more joy than  elsewhere, for there Roderick Drew joined his mother. We have not time  here to dwell on the things that happened at the old Hudson Bay Post  during the ten days after their first happy reunion&#8212;of the love that  sprang up between Rod's mother and Minnetaki, and the princess wife of  George Newsome, the factor; of the departure of the soldiers whose task  of running down Woonga ended with Rod's desperate fight in the cabin,  or of the preparations of the gold hunters themselves.
  On a certain evening in April, Wabi, Mukoki and Rod had assembled in  the latter's room. The next morning they were to start on their long  and thrilling adventure into the far North, and on this last night they  went carefully over their equipment and plans to see that nothing had  been forgotten. That night Rod slept little. For the second time in his  life the fever of adventure was running wild in his blood. After the  others had gone he studied the precious old map until his eyes grew  dim; in the half slumber that came to him afterward his brain worked  ceaselessly, and he saw visions of the romantic old cabin again, and  the rotting buckskin bag filled with nuggets of gold on the table.
  He was up before the stars began fading in the dawn, and in the big  dining-room of the Post, in which had gathered the factors and their  families for two hundred years, the boys ate their last breakfast with  those whom they were about to leave for many weeks, perhaps months. The  factor himself was boisterously cheerful in his efforts to keep up the  good cheer of Mrs. Drew and the princess mother, and even Minnetaki  forced herself to smile, and laugh, though her eyes were red, and all  knew that she had been crying. Rod was glad when the meal was over and  they went out into the chill air of the morning, and down to the edge  of the lake, where their big birch-bark canoe was loaded and waiting  for their departure, and he was still more relieved when they had bade  a last good-by to the two mothers. But Minnetaki came down to the canoe  with them, and when Wabi kissed her she burst into tears, and Rod felt  a queer thickening in his throat as he took her firm little hand and  held it for a moment between both his own.
  &#8220;Good-by, Minnetaki,&#8221; he whispered.
  He turned and took his position in the middle of the canoe, and with  a last shout Wabi shoved off and the canoe sped out into the gloom.
  For a long time there was silence, except for the rhythmic dip of  the three paddles. Once Minnetaki's voice came to them faintly, and  they answered it with a shout. But that was all. After a time Rod said,
  &#8220;By George, this saying good-by is the toughest part of the whole  business!&#8221;
  His words cleared away the feeling of oppression that seemed to have  fallen on them.
  &#8220;It's always hard for me to leave Minnetaki,&#8221; replied Wabigoon.  &#8220;Some day I'm going to take her on a trip with me.&#8221;
  &#8220;She'd be a bully fellow!&#8221; cried Rod with enthusiasm.
  From the stern of the canoe came a delighted chuckle from Mukoki.
  &#8220;She brave&#8212;she shoot, she hunt, she be dam' fine!&#8221; he added, and  both Rod and Wabi burst out laughing. The young Indian looked at his  compass by the light of a match.
  &#8220;We'll strike straight across Lake Nipigon instead of following the  shore. What do you say, Muky?&#8221; he called back.
  The old pathfinder was silent. In surprise Wabi ceased paddling, and  repeated his question.
  &#8220;Don't you think it is safe?&#8221;
  Mukoki wet his hand over the side and held it above his head.
  &#8220;Wind in south,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Maybe no get stronger, but&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;If she did,&#8221; added Rod dubiously, noting how heavily laden the  canoe was, &#8220;we'd be in a fix, as sure as you live!&#8221;
  &#8220;It will take us all of to-day and half of to-morrow to follow the  shore,&#8221; urged Wabi, &#8220;while by cutting straight across the lake we can  make the other side early this afternoon. Let's risk it!&#8221;
  Mukoki grunted something that was a little less than approval, and  Rod felt a peculiar sensation shoot through him as the frail birch  headed out into the big lake. Their steady strokes sent the canoe  through the water at fully four miles an hour, and by the time broad  day had come the forest-clad shore at Wabinosh House was only a hazy  outline in the distance. The white youth's unspoken fears were  dispelled when the sun rose, warm and glorious, over the shimmering  lake, driving the chill from the air, and seeming to bring with it the  sweet scents of the forests far away. Joyfully he labored at his  paddle, the mere exhilaration of the morning filling his arms with the  strength of a young giant. Wabi whistled and sang wild snatches of  Indian song by turns, Rod joined him with<I> Yankee Doodle</I> and<I>  The Star Spangled Banner</I>, and even the silent Mukoki gave a whoop  now and then to show that he was as happy as they.
  One thought filled the minds of all. They were fairly started on  that most thrilling of all trails, the trail of gold. In their  possession was the secret of a great fortune. Romance, adventure,  discovery, awaited them. The big, silent North, mysterious in its  age-old desolation, where even the winds seemed to whisper of strange  things that had happened countless years before, was just ahead of  them. They were about to bury themselves in its secrets, to wrest from  it the yellow treasure it guarded, and their blood tingled and leaped  excitedly at the thought. What would be revealed to them? What might  they not discover? What strange adventures were they destined to  encounter in that Unknown World, peopled only by the things of the  wild, that stretched trackless and unexplored before them? A hundred  thoughts like these fired the brains of the three adventurers, and made  their work a play, and every breath they drew one of joy.
  The lake was alive with ducks. Huge flocks of big black ducks,  mallards, blue bills and whistlers rose about them, and now and then,  when an unusually large flock was seen floating upon the water ahead of  them, one of the three would take a pot-shot with his rifle. Rod and  Mukoki had each killed two, and Wabi three, when the old warrior  stopped the fun.
  &#8220;No waste too much shooting on ducks,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;Need shells&#8212;big  game.&#8221;
  Several times during the morning the three rested from their  exertions, and at noon they ceased paddling for more than an hour while  they ate the generous dinner that had been put up for them at Wabinosh  House. The farther side of the lake was now plainly visible, and when  the journey was resumed all eyes eagerly sought for signs of the mouth  of the Ombabika, where their stirring adventures of the winter before  had begun. For some time Wabi's gaze had been fixed upon a long, white  rim along the shore, to which he now called his companions' attention.
  &#8220;It seems to be moving,&#8221; he said, turning to Mukoki. &#8220;Is it  possible&#8212;&#8221; He paused doubtfully.
  &#8220;What?&#8221; questioned Rod.
  &#8220;That it's swans!&#8221; he completed.
  &#8220;Swans!&#8221; cried the young hunter. &#8220;Great Scott, do you mean to say  there could be enough swans&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;They sometimes cover the lake in thousands,&#8221; said Wabi. &#8220;I have  seen them whitening the water as far as one could see.&#8221;
  &#8220;More swan as you count in twent' t'ous'nd year!&#8221; affirmed Mukoki.  After a few moments he added, &#8220;Them no swan. Ice!&#8221;
  There was an unpleasant ring in his voice as he spoke the last word,  and though Rod did not fully understand what significance the discovery  held for them he could not but observe that it occasioned both of his  comrades considerable anxiety. The cause was not long in doubt. Another  half hour of brisk paddling brought them to the edge of a frozen field  of ice that extended for a quarter of a mile from the shore. In both  directions it stretched beyond their vision. Wabi's face was filled  with dismay. Mukoki sat with his paddle across his knees, uttering not  a sound.
  &#8220;What's the matter?&#8221; asked Rod. &#8220;Can't we make it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Make it!&#8221; exclaimed Wabigoon. &#8220;Yes&#8212;perhaps to-morrow, or the next  day!&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean to say we can't get over that ice?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's just exactly the predicament we are in. The edge of that ice  is rotten.&#8221;
  The canoe had drifted alongside the ice, and Rod began pounding it  with his paddle. For a distance of two feet it broke off in chunks,  then became more firm.
  &#8220;I believe that if we cut our way in for a canoe length or so it  would hold us,&#8221; he declared.
  Wabi reached for an ax.
  &#8220;We'll try it!&#8221;
  Mukoki shook his head.
  But for a second time that day Wabigoon persisted in acting against  the old pathfinder's judgment, something that Rod had never known him  to be guilty of before. Foot by foot he broke the ice ahead of the  canoe, until the frail craft had thrust its length into the rotten  field. Then, steadying himself on the bow, he stepped out cautiously  upon the ice.
  &#8220;There!&#8221; he cried triumphantly. &#8220;You next, Rod! Steady!&#8221;
  In a moment Rod had joined him. What happened after that seemed to  pass like a terrible nightmare. First there came a light cracking in  the ice under their feet, but it was over in an instant. Wabi was  laughing at him for the fear that had come into his face, and calling  his name, when with a thunderous, crash the whole mass gave way under  them, and they plunged down into the black depths of the lake. The last  that Rod saw was his friend's horror-stricken face sinking in the  crumbling ice; he heard a sharp, terrible cry from Mukoki, and then he  knew that the cold waters had engulfed him, and that he was battling  for his life under the surface.
  Fiercely he struck out with arms and legs in an effort to rise, and  in that moment of terror he thought of the great sheet of ice. What if  he should come up under it? In which direction should he strike out? He  opened his eyes but all was a black chaos about him. The seconds seemed  like ages. There came a splitting, rending sensation in his head, an  almost overpowering desire to open his mouth, to gasp, gasp for air  where there was nothing but death! Then his head struck something. It  was the ice! He had come up under the ice, and there was but one end to  that!
  He began to sink again, slowly, as if an invisible hand were pulling  him down, and in his despair he made a last frantic effort, striking  out blindly, knowing that in another second he must open his mouth.  Even under the water he still had consciousness enough left to know  that he tried to cry out, and he felt the first gurgling rush of water  into his lungs. But he did not see the long arm that reached down where  the bubbles were coming up, he did not feel the grip that dragged him  out upon the ice. His first sense of life was that something very heavy  was upon his stomach, and that he was being rubbed, and pummeled, and  rolled about as if he had become the plaything of a great bear. Then he  saw Mukoki, and then Wabigoon.
  &#8220;You go build fire,&#8221; he heard Mukoki say, and he could hear Wabi  running swiftly shoreward. For he knew that they were still upon the  ice. The canoe was drawn safely up a dozen feet away, and the old  Indian was dragging blankets from it. When Mukoki turned he found Rod  resting upon his elbow, looking at him.
  &#8220;That&#8212;w'at you call heem&#8212;close shave!&#8221; he grinned, placing a  supporting arm under Rod's shoulder.
  With Mukoki's assistance the youth rose to his feet, and a thick  blanket was wrapped about him. Slowly they made their way shoreward,  and soon Wabi came running out to meet them, dripping wet.
  &#8220;Rod, when we get thawed out, I want you to kick me,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I  want you to kick me good and hard, and then I'll take great pleasure in  kicking you. And ever after this, when we do a thing that Mukoki tells  us not to do, we'll kick some more!&#8221;
  &#8220;Who pulled us out?&#8221; asked Rod.
  &#8220;Mukoki, of course. Will you kick me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Shake!&#8221;
  And the two dripping, half-frozen young adventurers shook hands,  while Mukoki chuckled and grunted and gurgled until he set the others  bursting into laughter.
