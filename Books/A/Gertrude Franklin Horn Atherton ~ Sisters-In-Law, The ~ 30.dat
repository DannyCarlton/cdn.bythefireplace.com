San Francisco, commencing in September, has three or four months of perfect  weather. The cold fogs and winds cease to pay their daily visits, the rainy  season awaits the new year. The skies are a deep and cloudless blue, the  air is warm and soft and alluring, never too hot, although the overcoats of  summer are discarded.    
The city lies bathed in golden sunlight or the sharp jeweled light of  stars, when the moon is not blazing like a crystal bonfire. Then Mount  Tamalpais and other mountains across the Bay and behind the city take on  a chiseled outline that, particularly at night, makes them look curiously  new, as if but yesterday heaved from the deep, and Nature too busy to  provide them with a background and the soft blurs of time for centuries to  come. This primeval look of bare California mountains on clear nights has  something sinister and menacing in its aspect as if at any moment they  might once more brood alone over the earth.

Alexina returned from abroad early in November and stood one morning  outside her eucalyptus grove, revolving slowly on one heel, schoolgirl  fashion, as she gazed up at the steep densely populated hill that rose from  the street below her own private little hill, and cut off her view of the  hills of Berkeley and the mountains beyond; at the broad crowded valleys  on the south; the range of hills that hid the Pacific Ocean, and included  Mount Calvary with its cross and the symmetrical mass of Twin Peaks; the  bare brown mountains of the north piling above the green sparkling bay with  its wooded and military islands.    
Like a good and valiant Californian she was assuring herself that she had  seen nothing like this in Europe, and that she really preferred it to  art galleries and dilapidated old ruins. But as a matter of fact she had  returned to California with dragging feet and was merely staving off the  disheartening moment when her ruthless candor would force her to admit it.    
San Francisco was all very well, and in this dazzling light that compact  mass of houses swarming over the city's hills and valleys, with sudden  palms in high gardens and a tree here and there, produced the impression  that all were white with red roofs, and looked not unlike Genoa. But it  seemed quite unromantic and uninspiring to a girl who had just paid her  first brief visit to the old world, an interval, moreover, that had been  without a responsibility, cut her off so completely from her general life  that when variously addressed "Mademoiselle," "Signorina," "Senorita," she  ceased almost at once to feel either surprised or flattered. If she had not  forbidden herself to dream she would still have been Alexina Groome with  a future to sketch with her own adventurous pencil; and to fill in at her  pleasure.    
But although she was free in a sense she was not free to live in Europe.  She was a partner with a partner's obligations. To desert Mortimer would  not only be to banish him from Ballinger House to dreary bachelor quarters,  with none of the comforts and little luxuries he intensely loved, but it  would also deprive him of his surest social prop. People had accepted him  and liked him as well as they liked the totally uninteresting of the good  old stock; but many would drift into the habit of not inviting him to  anything but large dances, if his wife were absent. Alexina knew that her  invitations to all important and many small dinners, not avowedly bridge  or poker parties, were as inevitable as crab in season; but there were too  many young men whom girls would infinitely prefer to enliven the monotony  of crab a la poulette, to any married man, particularly one who had as  little to say as poor Morty. She had known debutantes who flatly refused to  dance with married men or even to be introduced to them.    
California was her fate. No doubt of that. She might never see Europe  again, for while it was all very well to be a guest once it would be quite  impossible another time. She certainly could not afford it herself and keep  Ballinger House open, even for brief summer visits; as she might if her  home were in New York.    
Of course Mortimer might make his million, but then again he might not.  Certainly there were no present signs of it and she had never seen him so  depressed, not even during the panic of nineteen-seven. His eyes were as  lifeless as slate, his voice was flat, although for that matter he was  almost dumb. When at home he sat brooding heavily by the open western  windows of the drawing-room, or moved restlessly about. To all her  questions he replied shortly that the times were bad again, worse than  ever; that he was holding his own, but was tired, tired out. As she had not  been there he had not cared to take a cottage by himself, and had paid few  week-end visits. He had nothing to talk to women about and the men talked  of nothing but the business depression....Alexina had shrugged her  shoulders and concluded that his attitude was a subtle reproach for leaving  him to the dull cares of business while she enjoyed herself in Europe.    
She was not in the least sorry for Mortimer. He had been perfectly  comfortable; he had had his friends; she had left him a sum of money which  with the monthly rents from the flats would pay her share in the household  expenses; he could spend his free afternoons at the golf club by the ocean,  and his evenings, when not invited out, at the temple of his idolatry on  Nob Hill. James was a better housekeeper than she was and it was now two  years that Mortimer bad been living the life of a luxurious bachelor at the  back of the house with an always amiable companion at breakfast and dinner.

Alexina, as she stood shading her eyes from the brilliant sunlight and  watching a great liner drift through the Golden Gate, wondered if Morty had  consoled himself, and if his Puritanical conscience were flaying him. She  hoped that he had, for she was quite willing that he should be happy in  his own way, poor thing, so long as he secluded his divagations from the  world--and she could trust him to do that! Now that she had ceased to be  the complaisant bored wife with dull nerves and torpid imagination she  would be the last to condemn him. Human Nature was an ever opening book to  her these days, and she wondered what would happen to herself if any of  several men she liked were capable of making her love him, whipping up a  personal storm in those emotional gulfs which had slowly and inflexibly  intruded themselves upon her consciousness.    
She had pondered long and deeply on this subject, particularly in the old  world where bonds seem looser to the mere observer whether they are or not,  and where life looks to the American the quintessence of romance....She  had concluded that the most satisfactory experience that could come to her  would be a mad love affair "in the air" with a man who possessed all the  requirements to induce it, but who would either be the unsuspecting object,  or, reciprocating, would continue to love her with the world between them.    
For she shrank from the disillusionments of secret libertinage; she did  not, indeed, believe that love could survive it, although passion might for  a time. Passion was unthinkable to her without love, and when she recalled  the mean and sordid devices to which two of her friends were put to meet  their lovers she felt nothing but disgust for the whole drama of man and  woman.    
Alexina had been reared on the soundest moral principles of church and  society, to say nothing of the law, but the norm at the wheel has often  laughed in her amiable way at church and society and law when circumstances  have conspired to help her. But against fastidiousness even the blind urge  of the race seldom has availed her; she can only go on sullenly feeding the  fires, heaping on the fuel, hoping grimly for the astrological moment.

Alexina shrugged her shoulders impatiently and went into the house. She  would go down to the bank and clip her coupons. She cultivated assiduously  the practical side of life, making the most of it, delighted when repairs  were needed on her flats, regretting that the greater part of her income  came from ground rents, collected, as ever, by Tom Abbott, and bonds, from  which she still experienced a childish pleasure in cutting the coupons. Her  flats, which were in a humbler part of the western division of the city,  she had never visited, but she received a call every month from the agent,  who brought her the rents and complaints.    
She had made a heroic effort to turn herself into a business woman but  the material had been too slender; and she sometimes wished for a large  independent fortune that would tax her powers to the utmost. But she never  even had any surplus to invest. Her wardrobe was no inconsiderable item;  living prices rose steadily; there were repairs both on her own house and  the flats to be anticipated every year, to say nothing of the fiendish sum  that must be set aside for taxes. But she managed to save the necessary  amount; and if they lived somewhat extravagantly, at least she had never  disturbed her capital.    
On the whole she knew they had managed very well for young people who lived  so much in the world, and she had no intention of economizing further. They  had no children. Her husband was young and energetic and healthy. Her own  little fortune was secure. She purposed to enjoy life as best she could;  and as she could not have done this quite selfishly and been happy, she  included among her yearly expenditures a certain admirable charity presided  over by her equally admirable sister, and even visited it occasionally with  her friends when a serious mood descended abruptly upon them....She was now  on the threshold of her second beautiful youth, and found herself and life  far more interesting than when, a silly girl of eighteen, she had believed  that all life and romance must be crowded into that callow period. She had  no idea of sacrificing this new era vibrating with unknown possibilities  (it was on the cards that she might resurrect Gathbroke from his ivory  tomb; lie would do admirably for her present needs, and when she found it  difficult to visualize him after so long a period, she could pay Gora a  sisterly visit) to a penurious attempt to increase her capital. At the same  time she had no intention of diminishing it. To quote Tom Abbott (when  Maria was elsewhere): She might be a fool, or even a----fool, but she was  not a----fool.

She dressed herself in a black velvet suit made by her New York tailors.  She had spent, a fortnight with her brother Ballinger on her way home,  and he had given her a set of silver fox: a large muff and two of those  priceless animals head to head to keep a small section of her anatomy at  blood heat in a climate never cold enough for furs.    
The day was hot. It was the sort of weather which on the opposite side of  the continent arrives when spring is melting into summer and fortunate  woman arrays herself in thin and dainty fabrics. But women everywhere with  a proper regard for fashion rush the season, and autumn is the time to  display the first smart habiliments of winter. No San Francisco woman of  fashion would be guilty of comfortable garments in the glorious spring  weather of November if she perished in her furs.    
The coat, bound with silk braid, was lined with periwinkle blue, and there  was a touch of the same color in her large black velvet hat. Nothing could  make the great irises of her black-gray eyes look blue, but they shone out,  dazzling, under the drooping brim; and if she was, perchance, too warm  above, her scant skirt, her thin silk stockings and low patent leather  shoes struck the balance like a brilliant paradox.    
Alexina nodded approvingly at her image in the pier glass, found the key of  her safe deposit box in the cabinet where she had left it, and went down to  the smart little electric car which the gardener had brought to the door.
