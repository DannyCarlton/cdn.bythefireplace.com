'The Primate of Fiji' was duly accepted and put into rehearsal by  the astute and enterprising manager of the Ambiguities Theatre.  'It's a risk,' he said candidly, when he read the manuscript over,  'a decided risk, Mr. Berkeley; I acknowledge the riskiness, but I  don't mind trying it for all that. You see, you've staked everything  upon the doubtful supposition that the Public possesses a certain  amount of elementary intelligence, and a certain appreciation  of genuine original wit and humour. Your play's literature, good  literature; and that's rather a speculative element to introduce  into the regular theatre nowadays. Illegitimate, I should call it;  decidedly illegitimate--but still, perhaps, worth trying. Do you  know the story about old Simon Burbury, the horsedealer? Young Simon  says to him one morning, "Father, don't you think we might manage  to conduct this business of ours without always telling quite  so many downright lies about it?" The old man looks back at him  reproachfully, and says with a solemn shake of the head, "Ah, Simon,  Simon, little did I ever think I should live to see a son of mine  go in for speculation!" Well, my dear sir, that's pretty much how  a modern manager feels about the literary element in the drama.  The Public isn't accustomed to it, and there's no knowing how they  may take it. Shakespeare, now, they stand readily enough, because  he's an old-established and perfectly respectable family purveyor.  Sheridan, too, of course, and one play of Goldsmith's, and a trifle  or so of George Colman--all recognised and all tolerated because  of their old prescriptive respectability. But for a new author to  aim at being literary's rather presumptuous; now tell me yourself,  isn't it? Seems as if he was setting himself up for a heaven-sent  genius, and trying to sit upon the older dramatists of the present  generation. Melodrama, sensation, burlesque--that's all right  enough--perfectly legitimate; but a real literary comic opera, with  good words and good music--it <i>is</i> a little strong, for a beginner,  Mr. Berkeley, you <i>will</i> acknowledge.'    
'But don't you think,' Arthur answered, smiling good-humouredly at  his cynical frankness, 'an educated and cultured Public is beginning  to grow up that may, perhaps, really prefer a little literature,  provided it's made light enough and attractive enough for their  rapid digestion? Don't you think intelligent people are beginning  to get just a trifle sick of burlesque, and spectacle, and sensation,  and melodrama?'    
'Why, my dear sir,' the manager answered promptly, 'that's the exact  chance on which I'm calculating when I venture to accept your comic  opera from an unknown beginner. It's clever, there's no denying  that, and I hope the fact won't be allowed to tell against it: but  the music's bright and lively; the songs are quaint and catching;  the dialogue's brisk and not too witty; and there's plenty of  business--plenty of business in it. I incline to think we can get  together a house at the Ambiguities that'll enter into the humour  of the thing, and see what your play's driving at. How did you learn  all about stage requirements, though? I never saw a beginner's  play with so little in it that was absolutely impossible.'    
'I was a Shooting Star at Oxford,' Berkeley answered simply,  'so that I know something--like a despised amateur--about stage  necessities; and I've written one or two little pieces before for  private acting. Besides, Watkiss has helped me with all the technical  arrangements of the little opera.'    
'It'll do,' the manager answered, more confidently; 'I won't predict  a success, because you know a manager should never prophesy unless  he knows; but I think there's a Public in London that'll take it  in, just as they took in "Caste" and "Society," twenty years back,  at the Prince of Wales's. Anyhow, I'm quite prepared to give it  a fair trial.'    
On the first night, Arthur Berkeley and the Progenitor went down  in fear and trembling to the stage door of the Ambiguities. There  was a full house, and the critics were all present, in some surprise  at the temerity of this new man; for it was noised abroad already  by those who had seen the rehearsals that 'The Primate of Fiji' was  a fresh departure, after its own fashion, in the matter of English  comic opera. The curtain rose upon the chorus of mermaids, and  the first song was a decided hit. Still the Public, as becomes a  first night, maintained a dignified and critical reserve. When the  President of the Board of Trade, in full court costume, appeared  upon the scene, in the midst of the very realistic long-haired  sea-ladies, the audience was half shocked for a moment by the  utter incongruity of the situation; but after a while they began  to discover that the incongruity was part of the joke, and they  laughed quietly a sedate and moderate laugh of suspended judgment.  As the Progenitor had predicted, the gods were the first to enter  into the spirit of the fun, and to give a hand to the Primate's  first sermon. The scuntific professors on the Challenger Expedition  took the fancy of the house a little more decidedly; and even the  stalls thawed visibly when the professor of biology delivered his  famous exposition of the evolution hypothesis to the assembled  chiefs of Raratouga. But it was the one feeble second-hand old joke  of the piece that really brought pit and boxes down together in a  sudden fit of inextinguishable laughter. The professor of political  economy enquired diligently, with note book in hand, of the Princess  of Fiji, whether she thought the influence of the missionaries  beneficial or otherwise; whether she considered these preachers  of a new religion really good or not; to which the unsophisticated  child of nature responded naively, 'Good, very good--roasted; but  not quite so good boiled,' and the professor gravely entered the  answer in his philosophic note-book. It was a very ancient jest  indeed, but it tickled the ribs of the house mightily, as ancient  jests usually do, and they burst forthwith into a hearty roar of  genuine approval. Then Arthur began to breathe more freely. After  that the house toned down again quietly, and gave no decided token  of approbation till the end of the piece. When the curtain dropped  there was a lull of hushed expectation for poor Arthur Berkeley;  and at its close the house broke out into a storm of applause, and  'The Primate of Fiji' had firmly secured its position as the one  great theatrical success of the present generation.    
There was a loud cry of 'Author! Author!' and Arthur Berkeley,  hardly knowing how he got there, or what he was standing on, found  himself pushed from behind by friendly hands, on to the narrow  space between the curtain and the footlights. He became aware that  a very hot and red body, presumably himself, was bowing mechanically  to a seething and clapping mass of hands and faces over the whole  theatre. Backing out again, in the same semi-conscious fashion,  with the universe generally reeling on more than one distinct axis  all around him, he was seized and hand-shaken violently, first  by the Progenitor, then by the manager, and then by half a dozen  other miscellaneous and unknown persons. At last, after a lot more  revolutions of the universe, he found himself comfortably pitched  into a convenient hansom, with the Progenitor by his side; and  hardly knew anything further till he discovered his own quiet supper  table at the Chelsea lodgings, and saw his father mixing a strong  glass of brandy and seltzer for him. to counteract the strength of  the excitement.    
Next morning Arthur Berkeley 'awoke, and found himself famous.'  'The Primate of Fiji' was the rage of the moment. Everybody went to  hear it--everybody played its tunes at their own pianos--everybody  quoted it, and adapted it, and used its clever catchwords as the  pet fashionable slang expressions of the next three seasons. Arthur  Berkeley was the lion of the hour; and the mantelpiece of the  quiet little Chelsea study was ranged three rows deep with cards  of invitation from people whose very names Arthur had never heard  of six months before, and whom the Progenitor declared it was a  sin and shame for any respectable young man of sound economical  education even to countenance. There were countesses, and marchionesses,  too, among the senders of those coronetted parallelograms of waste  pasteboard, as the Progenitor called them--nay, there was even one  invitation on the mantelpiece that bore the three strawberry leaves  and other insignia of Her Grace the Duchess of Leicestershire.    
'Can't you give us just <i>one</i> evening, Mr. Berkeley,' said Lady  Hilda Tregellis, as she sat on the centre ottoman in Mrs. Campbell  Moncrieff's drawing-room with Arthur Berkeley talking lightly  to her about the nothings which constitute polite conversation in  the nineteenth century. 'Just one evening, any day after the next  fortnight? We should be so delighted if you could manage to favour  us.'    
'No, I'm afraid I can't, Lady Hilda,' Arthur answered. 'My evenings  are so dreadfully full just now; and besides, you know, I'm not  accustomed to so much society, and it unsettles me for my daily work.  After all, you see, I'm a journeyman playwright now, and I have to  labour at my unholy calling just like the theatrical carpenter.'    
'How delightfully frank,' thought Lady Hilda. 'Really I like him  quite immensely.--Not even the afternoon on Wednesday fortnight?'  she went on aloud. 'You might come to our garden party on Wednesday  fortnight.'    
'Quite impossible,' Arthur Berkeley answered. 'That's my regular  day at Pilbury Regis.'    
'Pilbury Regis!' cried Lady Hilda, starting a little. 'You don't  mean to say you have engagements, and in the thick of the season,  too, at Pilbury Regis!'    
'Yes, I have, every Wednesday fortnight,' Berkeley answered, with  a smile. 'I go there regularly. You see, Lady Hilda, Wednesday's  a half-holiday at Pilbury Grammar School; so every second week I  run down for the day to visit an old friend of mine, who's also an  acquaintance of yours, I believe,--Ernest Le Breton. He's married  now, you know, and has got a mastership at the Pilbury Grammar  School.'    
'Then you know Mr. Le Breton!' cried Lady Hilda, charmed at this  rapprochement of two delightfully original men. 'He is so nice.  I like him immensely, and I'm so glad you're a friend of his. And  Mrs. Le Breton, too; wasn't it nice of him? Tell me, Mr. Berkeley,  was she really and truly a grocer's daughter?'    
Berkeley's voice grew a little stiffer and colder as he answered,  'She was a sister of Oswald of Oriel, the great mathematician, who  was killed last year by falling from the summit of a peak in the  Bernina.'    
'Oh, yes, yes, I know all about that, of course,' said Lady Hilda,  quickly and carelessly. 'I know her brother was very clever and  all that sort of thing; but then there are so many men who are very  clever, aren't there? The really original thing about it all, you  know, was that he actually married a grocer's daughter. That was  really quite too delightfully original. I was charmed when I heard  about it: I thought it was so exactly like dear Mr. Le Breton.  He's so deliciously unconventional in every way. He was Lynmouth's  tutor for a while, as you've heard, of course; and then he went  away from us, at a moment's notice, so nicely, because he wouldn't  stand papa's abominable behaviour, and quite right, too, when it  was a matter of conscience--I dare say he's told you all about it,  that horrid pigeon-shooting business. Well, and so you know Mrs.  Le Breton--do tell me, what sort of person is she?'    
'She's very nice, and very good, and very pretty, and very clever,'  Arthur answered, a little constrainedly. 'I don't know that I can  tell you anything more about her than that.'    
'Then you really like her?' said Lady Hilda, warmly. 'You think  her a fit wife for Mr. Le Breton, do you?'    
'I think him a very lucky fellow indeed to have married such a  charming and beautiful woman,' Arthur answered, quietly.    
Lady Hilda noticed his manner, and read through it at once with a  woman's quickness. 'Aha!' she said to herself: 'the wind blows that  way, does it? What a very remarkable girl she must be, really,  to have attracted two such men as Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Le Breton.  I've lost one of them to her; I can't very well lose the other,  too: for after Ernest Le Breton, I've never seen any man I should  care to marry so much as Mr. Arthur Berkeley.'    
'Lady Hilda,' said the hostess, coming up to her at that moment,  'you'll play us something, won't you? You know you promised to  bring your music.'    
Hilda rose at once with stately alacrity. Nothing could have pleased  her better. She went to the piano, and, to the awe and astonishment  of Mrs. Campbell Moncrieff, took out an arrangement of the Fijian  war-dance from 'The Primate of Fiji.' It suited her brilliant  slap-dash style of execution admirably; and she felt she had never  played so well in her life before. The presence of the composer,  which would have frightened and unnerved most girls of her age, only  made Hilda Tregellis the bolder and the more ambitious. Here was  somebody at least who knew something about it; none of your ordinary  fashionable amateurs and mere soulless professional performers,  but the very man who had made the music--the man in whose brain the  notes had first gathered themselves together into speaking melody,  and who could really judge the comparative merits of her rapid  execution. She played with wonderful verve and spirit, so that  Lady Exmoor, seated on the side sofa opposite, though shocked at  first at Hilda's choice of a piece, glanced more than once at the  wealthiest young commoner present (she had long since mentally  resigned herself to the prospect of a commoner for that poor dear  foolish Hilda), and closely watched his face to see what effect  this unwonted outburst of musical talent might succeed in producing  upon his latent susceptibilities. But Lady Hilda herself wasn't  thinking of the wealthy commoner; she was playing straight at Arthur  Berkeley: and when she saw that Arthur Berkeley's mouth had melted  slowly into an approving smile, she played even more brilliantly  and better than ever, after her bold, smart, vehement fashion. As  she left the piano, Arthur said, 'Thank you; I have never heard  the piece better rendered.' And Lady Hilda felt that that was a  triumph which far outweighed any number of inane compliments from  a whole regiment of simpering Algies, Monties, and Berties.    
'You can't say any evening, then, Mr. Berkeley?' she said once  more, as she held out her hand to him to say 'Good-night' a little  later: 'not any evening at all, or part of an evening? You might  really reconsider your engagements.'    
Arthur hesitated visibly. 'Well, possibly I might manage it,' he  said, wavering, 'though, I assure you, my evenings are very much  more than full already.'    
'Then don't make it an evening,' said Lady Hilda, pressingly.  'Make it lunch. After all, Mr. Berkeley, it's we ourselves who want  to see you; not to show you off as a curiosity to all the rest of  London. We have silly people enough in the evenings; but if you'll  come to lunch with us alone one day, we shall have an opportunity  of talking to you on our own account.'    
Lady Hilda was tall and beautiful, and Lady Hilda spoke. as she  always used to speak, with manifest sincerity. Now, it is not in  human nature not to feel flattered when a beautiful woman pays  one genuine homage; and Arthur Berkeley was quite as human, after  all, as most other people. 'You're very kind,' he said, smiling.  'I must make it lunch, then, though I really ought to be working  in the mornings instead of running about merely to amuse myself.  What day will suit you best?'    
'Oh, not to amuse yourself, Mr. Berkeley,' Hilda answered pointedly,  'but to gratify us. That, you know, is a work of benevolence. Say  Monday next, then, at two o'clock. Will that do for you?'    
'Perfectly,' Berkeley answered, taking her proffered hand extended  to him with just that indefinable air of frankness which Lady  Hilda knew so well how to throw into all her actions. 'Good evening.  Wilton Place, isn't it!--Gracious heavens!' he thought to himself,  as he glanced after her satin train sweeping slowly down the grand  staircase, 'what on earth would the dear old Progenitor say if only  he saw me in the midst of these meaningless aristocratic orgies. I  am positively half-wheedled, it seems, into making love to an earl's  daughter! If this sort of thing continues, I shall find myself,  before I know it, connected by marriage with two-thirds of the  British peerage. A beautiful woman, really, and quite queen-like  in her manner when she doesn't choose rather to be unaffectedly  gracious. How she sat upon that tall young man with the brown  moustaches over by the mantelpiece! I didn't hear what she said  to him, but I could see he was utterly crushed by the way he slank  away with his tail between his legs, like a whipped spaniel. A  splendid woman--and no doubt about it; looks as if she'd stepped  straight out of the canvas of Titian, with the pearls in her hair  and everything else exactly as he painted them. The handsomest  girl I ever saw in my life--but not like Edie Le Breton. They say  a man can only fall in love once in a lifetime. I wonder whether  there's any truth in it! Well, well, you won't often see a finer  woman in her own style than Lady Hilda Tregellis. Monday next, at  two precisely; I needn't make a note of it--no fear of my forgetting.'    
'I really do think,' Lady Hilda said to herself as she unrolled  the pearls from her thick hair in her own room that winter evening,  'I almost like him better than I did Ernest Le Breton. The very  first night I saw him at Lady Mary's I fell quite in love with his  appearance, before I knew even who he was; and now that I've found  out all about him, I never did hear anything so absolutely and  delightfully original. His father a common shoemaker! That, to  begin with, throws Ernest Le Breton quite into the shade! <i>His</i> father  was a general in the Indian army--nothing could be more <i>banal</i>.  Then Mr. Berkeley began life as a clergyman; but now he's taken off  his white choker, and wears a suit of grey tweed like any ordinary  English gentleman. So delightfully unconventional, isn't it? At  last, to crown it all, he not only composes delicious music, but  goes and writes a comic opera--such a comic opera! And the best  of it is, success hasn't turned his head one atom. He doesn't run  with vulgar eagerness after the great people, like your ordinary  everyday successful nobody. He took no more notice of me, myself,  at first, because I was Lady Hilda Tregellis, than if I'd been a  common milkmaid; and he wouldn't come to our garden party because  he wanted to go down to Pilbury Regis to visit the Le Bretons at  their charity school or something! It was only after I played the  war-dance arrangement so well--I never played so brilliantly in my  life before--that he began to alter and soften a little. Certainly,  these pearls do thoroughly become me. I think he looked after me  when I was leaving the room just a tiny bit, as if he was really  pleased with me for my own sake, and not merely because I happen  to be called Lady Hilda Tregellis.'
