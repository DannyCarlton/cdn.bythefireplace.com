  Dripping from the bog-holes and lathered with mud, it was the   mystery of Breault's noiseless presence somewhere near him in the   still night that drew Peter continually deeper into the swamp. 
  Half a dozen times he caught the scent of him in a quiet air that   seemed only now and then to rise up in his face softly, as if  stirred  by butterflies' wings. Always it came from ahead, and  Peter's mind  worked swiftly to the decision that where Breault was  there also would  be Nada and Jolly Roger. Yet he caught the scent  of neither of these  two, and that puzzled him. 
  Many times he found himself at the edge of the black lip of water,   but never quite at the right time to see a shadow in its darkness,  or  hear the sound of Breault's pole. 
  But in the swamp, as he went on, he saw nothing but shadow, and   heard weird and nameless sounds which made his blood creep, even   though his courage was now full-grown within him. 
  He was not frightened at the ugly sputter of the owls, as in the   days of old. Their throaty menace and snapping beaks did not stop  him  nor turn him aside. The slashing scrape of claws in the bark  of trees  and the occasional crackling of brush were matters of  intimate  knowledge, and he gave but little attention to them in  his eagerness  to reach those who had gone ahead of him. What  troubled him, and  filled his eyes with sudden red glares, were the  oily gurgles of the  pitfalls which tried to suck him down; the  laughing madness of muck  that held him as if living things were in  it, and which spluttered and  coughed when he freed himself. 
  Half blinded at times, so that even the black shadows were blotted   out, he went on. And at last, coming again to the edge of the  stream,  he heard a new kind of sound&#8212;the slow, steady dipping of  Breault's  pole. 
  He hurried on, finding harder ground under his feet, and came   noiselessly abreast of the man on his raft of cedar timbers. He  could  almost hear his breathing. And very faintly he could see in  the vast  gloom a shadow&#8212;a shadow that moved slowly against the  background of a  still deeper shadow beyond. 
  But there was no scent of Nada or Jolly Roger, and whatever desire   had risen in him to make himself known was smothered by caution  and  suspicion. After this he did not go ahead of Breault, but kept  behind  him or abreast of him, within sound of the dipping pole.  And every  minute his heart thumped expectantly, and he sniffed the  new air for  signs of those he most desired to find. 
  Dawn was breaking in the sky when they came out of the swamp, and   the first flush of the sun was lighting up the east when Breault   headed his improvised craft for the sandbar upon which Nada and  McKay  had rested many hours before. 
  Breault was tired, but his eyes lighted up when he saw the   footprints in the sand, and he chuckled&#8212;almost good humoredly. As  a  matter of fact he was in a good humor. But one would not have  reckoned  it as such in Breault. A hard man, the forests called  him; a man with  the hunting instincts of the fox and the wolf and  the merciless  persistency of the weazel&#8212;a man who lived his code  to the last letter  of the law, without pity and without  favoritism. At least so he was  judged, and his hard, narrow eyes,  his thin lips and his cynically  lined face seldom betrayed the  better thoughts within him, if he  possessed any at all. In the  Service he was regarded as a humanly  perfect mechanism, a bit of  machinery that never failed, the dreaded  Nemesis to be set on the  trail of a wrong-doer when all others had  failed. 
  But this morning, with every bone and muscle in him aching from   his long night of tedious exertion, the chuckle grew into a laugh  as  he looked upon the telltale signs in the sand. 
  He stretched himself and his tired bones cracked. 
  Breault did not think aloud. But he was saying to himself. 
  &quot;There, against that rock, Jolly Roger McKay sat There is the   imprint of only one person sitting. The girl was in his arms. Here   are little holes where her outstretched heels rested in the sand.  She  is wearing shoes and not moccasins.&quot; 
  He grinned as he drew his service pack from the two-log cedar   raft. 
  &quot;Plenty of time now,&quot; he continued to think. &quot;They are mine this   time&#8212;sure. They believe they have fooled me, and they haven't.   That's fatal. Always.&quot; 
  Not infrequently, when entirely alone, Breault let a little part   of himself loose, as if freeing a prisoner from bondage for a  short  time. For instance, he whistled. It was not an unpleasant  whistle, but  rather oddly reminiscent of tender things he  remembered away back  somewhere; and as he fried his bacon and  steamed a handful of  desiccated potatoes he hummed a song, also  rather pleasant to ears  that were as closely attentive as Peter's. 
  For Peter had crept up through a tangle of ground-scrub and lay   not twenty paces away, smelling of the bacon hungrily, and  watching  intently from his concealment. 
  Peter knew the fox and the wolf, but he did not know Breault, and   he did not guess why the man's whistling grew a little louder, nor   why his humming voice grew stronger. But after a time, with his  back  and not his face toward Peter, Breault called in the most  natural and  matter-of-fact voice in the world, 
  &quot;Come on, Peter. Breakfast is ready!&quot; 
  Peter's jaws dropped in amazement. And as Breault turned toward   him, his thin face a-grin, and continued to invite him in a most   companionable way, he forgot his concealment entirely and stood up   straight, ready either to fight or fly. 
  Breault tossed him a dripping slice of bacon which he held in his   hand. It fell within a foot of Peter's nose, and Peter was  ravenously  hungry. The delicious odor of it demoralized his senses  and his  caution. For a few seconds he resisted, then thrust  himself out toward  it an inch at a time, made a sudden grab, and  swallowed it at one gulp 
  Breault laughed outright, and with the first of the sun striking   into his face he did not look like an enemy to Peter. 
  A second slice of bacon followed the first, and then a third&#8212;   until Breault was frying another mess over the fire. 
  &quot;That's partial payment for what you did up on the Barren,&quot; he was   saying inside himself. &quot;If it hadn't been for you&#8212;&quot; 
  He didn't even imagine the rest. Nor after that did he pay the   slightest attention to Peter. For Breault knew dogs possibly even   better than he knew men, and not by the smallest sign did he give   Peter to understand that he was interested in him at all. He  washed  his dishes, whistling and humming, reloaded his pack on the  raft, and  once more began poling his way downstream. 
  Peter, still in the edge of the scrub, was not only puzzled, but   felt a further sense of abandonment. After all, this man was not  his  enemy, and he was leaving him as his master and mistress had  left him.  He whined. And Breault was not out of sight when he  trotted down to  the sandbar, and quickly found the scent of Nada  and McKay. Purposely  Breault had left a lump of desiccated potato  as big as his fist, and  this Peter ate as ravenously as he had  eaten the bacon. Then, just as  Breault knew he would do, he began  following the raft. 
  Breault did not hurry, and he did not rest. There was something   almost mechanically certain in his slow but steady progress,  though  he knew it was possible for the canoe to outdistance him  three to one.  He was missing nothing along the shore. Three times  during the  forenoon he saw where the canoe had landed, and he  chuckled each time,  thinking of the old story of the tortoise and  the hare. He stopped for  not more than two or three minutes at  each of these places, and was  then on his way again. 
  Peter was fascinated by the unexcited persistency of the man's   movement. He followed it, watched it, and became more and more   interested in the unvarying monotony of it. There were the same   up-and-down strokes of the long pole, the slight swaying of the   upstanding body, the same eddy behind the cedar logs&#8212;and   occasionally wisps of smoke floating behind when the pursuer  smoked  his pipe. Not once did Peter see Breault turn his head to  look behind  him. Yet Breault was seeing everything. Five times  that morning he saw  Peter, but not once did he make a sign or call  to him. 
  He drove his raft ashore at twelve o'clock to prepare his dinner,   and after he had built a fire, and his cooking things were  scattered  about, he straightened himself up and called in that  same  matter-of-fact way, as if expecting an immediate response, 
  &quot;Here, Peter!&#8212;Peter!&#8212;Come in, Boy!&quot; 
  And Peter came. Fighting against the last instinct that held him   back he first thrust his head out from the brush and looked at   Breault. Breault paid no attention to him for a few moments, but   sliced his bacon. When the perfume of the cooking meat reached   Peter's nose he edged himself a little nearer, and with a  whimpering  sigh flattened himself on his belly. 
  Breault heard the sigh, and grunted a reply, 
  &quot;Hungry again, Peter?&quot; he inquired casually. 
  He had saved for this moment a piece of cooked bacon held over   from breakfast, and tearing this with his fingers he tossed the   strips to Peter. As he did this he was thinking to himself, 
  &quot;Why am I doing this? I don't want the dog. He will be a nuisance.   He will eat my grub. But it's fair. I'm paying a debt. He helped  to  save me up on the Barren.&quot; 
  Thus did Breault, the man without mercy, the Nemesis, briefly   analyze the matter. And he cooked five pieces of bacon for Peter. 
  During the rest of that day Peter made no effort to keep himself   in concealment as he followed Breault and his raft. This afternoon   Breault shot a fawn, and when he made camp that night both he and   Peter feasted on fresh meat. This broke down the last of Peter's   suspicion, and Breault laid a hand on his head. He did not   particularly like the feel of the hand, but he tolerated it, and   Breault grunted aloud, with a note of commendation in his hard  voice. 
  &quot;A one-man dog&#8212;never anything else.&quot; 
  Half a dozen times during the day Peter had found the scent of   Nada and Roger where they had come ashore, and from this night on  he  associated Breault as a necessary agent in his search for them.  And  with Breault he went, instinctively guessing the truth. 
  The next day they found where Nada and McKay had abandoned the   canoe, and had struck south through the wilderness. This pleased   Breault, who was tired of his poling. This third night there was a   new moon, and something about it stirred in Peter an impulse to  run  ahead and overtake those he was seeking. But a still strong  instinct  held him to Breault. 
  Tonight Breault slept like a dead man on his cedar boughs. He was   up and had a fire built an hour before dawn, and with the first  gray  streaking of day was on the trail again. He made no further  effort to  follow signs of the pursued, for that was a hopeless  task. But he knew  how McKay was heading, and he traveled swiftly,  figuring to cover  twice the distance that Nada might travel in the  same given time. It  was three o'clock in the afternoon when he  came to a great ridge, and  on its highest pinnacle he stopped. 
  Peter had grown restless again, and a little more suspicious of   Breault. He was not afraid of him, but all that day he had found  no  scent of Nada or Jolly Roger, and slowly the conviction was  impinging  itself upon him that he should seek for himself in the  wilderness. 
  Breault saw this restlessness, and understood it. 
  &quot;I'll keep my eye on the dog,&quot; he thought. &quot;He has a nose, and an   uncanny sixth sense, and I haven't either. He will bear watching.  I  believe McKay and the girl cannot be far away. Possibly they  have  traveled more slowly than I thought, and haven't passed this  ridge; or  it may be they are down there, in the plain. If so I  should catch sign  of smoke or fire&#8212;in time.&quot; 
  For an hour he kept watch over the plain through his binoculars,   seeking for a wisp of smoke that might rise at any time over the   treetops. He did not lose sight of Peter, questing out in widening   circles below him. And then, quite unexpectedly, something  happened.  In the edge of a tiny meadow an eighth of a mile away  Peter was acting  strangely. He was nosing the ground, gulping the  wind, twisting  eagerly back and forth. Then he set out, steadily  and with  unmistakable decision, south and west. 
  In a flash Breault was on his feet, had caught up his pack, and   was running for the meadow. And there he found something in the   velvety softness of the earth which brought a grim smile to his  thin  lips as he, too, set out south and west. 
  The scent he had found, hours old, drew Peter on until in the edge   of the dusk of evening it brought him to a foot-worn trail leading  to  the Hudson's Bay Company post many miles south. In this path,  beaten  by the feet of generations of forest dwellers, the hard  heels of  McKay's boots had made their imprint, and after this the  scent was  clearer under Peter's nose. But with forest-bred caution  he still  traveled slowly, though his blood was burning like a  pitch-fed fire in  his veins. Almost as swiftly followed Breault  behind him. 
  Again came darkness, and then the moon, brighter than last night,   lighting his way between the two walls of the forest
