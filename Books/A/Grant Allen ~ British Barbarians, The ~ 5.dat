Whether Philip Christy liked it or not, the Monteiths and he were  soon fairly committed to a tolerably close acquaintance with Bertram  Ingledew. For, as chance would have it, on the Monday morning  Bertram went up to town in the very same carriage with Philip and  his brother-in-law, to set himself up in necessaries of life for a  six or eight months' stay in England. When he returned that night  to Brackenhurst with two large trunks, full of underclothing and so  forth, he had to come round once more to the Monteiths, as Philip  anticipated, to bring back the Gladstone bag and the brown  portmanteau. He did it with so much graceful and gracious courtesy,  and such manly gratitude for the favour done him, that he left still  more deeply than ever on Frida's mind the impression of a gentleman.  He had found out all the right shops to go to in London, he said;  and he had ordered everything necessary to social salvation at the  very best tailor's, so strictly in accordance with Philip's  instructions that he thought he should now transgress no more the  sumptuary rules in that matter made and established, as long as he  remained in this realm of England. He had commanded a black cut-away  coat, suitable for Sunday morning; and a curious garment called a  frock-coat, buttoned tight over the chest, to be worn in the  afternoon, especially in London; and a still quainter coat, made of  shiny broadcloth, with strange tails behind, which was considered  "respectable," after seven P.M., for a certain restricted class of  citizens--those who paid a particular impost known as income-tax, as  far as he could gather from what the tailor told him: though the  classes who really did any good in the state, the working men and so  forth, seemed exempted by general consent from wearing it. Their  dress, indeed, he observed, was, strange to say, the least cared for  and evidently the least costly of anybody's.    
He admired the Monteith children so unaffectedly, too, telling them  how pretty and how sweet-mannered they were to their very faces,  that he quite won Frida's heart; though Robert did not like it.  Robert had evidently some deep-seated superstition about the  matter; for he sent Maimie, the eldest girl, out of the room at  once; she was four years old; and he took little Archie, the two-  year-old, on his knee, as if to guard him from some moral or social  contagion. Then Bertram remembered how he had seen African mothers  beat or pinch their children till they made them cry, to avert the  evil omen, when he praised them to their faces; and he recollected,  too, that most fetichistic races believe in Nemesis--that is to  say, in jealous gods, who, if they see you love a child too much,  or admire it too greatly, will take it from you or do it some  grievous bodily harm, such as blinding it or maiming it, in order  to pay you out for thinking yourself too fortunate. He did not  doubt, therefore, but that in Scotland, which he knew by report to  be a country exceptionally given over to terrible superstitions,  the people still thought their sanguinary Calvinistic deity,  fashioned by a race of stern John Knoxes in their own image, would  do some harm to an over-praised child, "to wean them from it." He  was glad to see, however, that Frida at least did not share this  degrading and hateful belief, handed down from the most fiendish of  savage conceptions. On the contrary, she seemed delighted that  Bertram should pat little Maimie on the head, and praise her sunny  smile and her lovely hair "just like her mother's."    
To Philip, this was all a rather serious matter. He felt he was  responsible for having introduced the mysterious Alien, however  unwillingly, into the bosom of Robert Monteith's family. Now,  Philip was not rich, and Frida was supposed to have "made a good  match of it"--that is to say, she had married a man a great deal  wealthier than her own upbringing. So Philip, after his kind,  thought much of the Monteith connection. He lived in lodgings at  Brackenhurst, at a highly inconvenient distance from town, so as to  be near their house, and catch whatever rays of reflected glory  might fall upon his head like a shadowy halo from their horses and  carriages, their dinners and garden-parties. He did not like,  therefore, to introduce into his sister's house anybody that Robert  Monteith, that moneyed man of oil, in the West African trade, might  consider an undesirable acquaintance. But as time wore on, and  Bertram's new clothes came home from the tailor's, it began to  strike the Civil Servant's mind that the mysterious Alien, though  he excited much comment and conjecture in Brackenhurst, was  accepted on the whole by local society as rather an acquisition to  its ranks than otherwise. He was well off: he was well dressed: he  had no trade or profession: and Brackenhurst, undermanned, hailed  him as a godsend for afternoon teas and informal tennis-parties.  That ineffable air of distinction as of one royal born, which  Philip had noticed at once the first evening they met, seemed to  strike and impress almost everybody who saw him. People felt he was  mysterious, but at any rate he was Someone. And then he had been  everywhere--except in Europe; and had seen everything--except their  own society: and he talked agreeably when he was not on taboos: and  in suburban towns, don't you know, an outsider who brings fresh  blood into the field--who has anything to say we do not all know  beforehand--is always welcome! So Brackenhurst accepted Bertram  Ingledew before long, as an eccentric but interesting and romantic  person.    
Not that he stopped much in Brackenhurst itself. He went up to town  every day almost as regularly as Robert Monteith and Philip  Christy. He had things he wanted to observe there, he said, for the  work he was engaged upon. And the work clearly occupied the best  part of his energies. Every night he came down to Brackenhurst  with his notebook crammed full of modern facts and illustrative  instances. He worked most of all in the East End, he told Frida  confidentially: there he could see best the remote results of  certain painful English customs and usages he was anxious to study.  Still, he often went west, too; for the West End taboos, though not  in some cases so distressing as the East End ones, were at times  much more curiously illustrative and ridiculous. He must master all  branches of the subject alike. He spoke so seriously that after a  time Frida, who was just at first inclined to laugh at his odd way  of putting things, began to take it all in the end quite as  seriously as he did. He felt more at home with her than with  anybody else at Brackenhurst. She had sympathetic eyes; and he  lived on sympathy. He came to her so often for help in his  difficulties that she soon saw he really meant all he said, and was  genuinely puzzled in a very queer way by many varied aspects of  English society.    
In time the two grew quite intimate together. But on one point  Bertram would never give his new friend the slightest information;  and that was the whereabouts of that mysterious "home" he so often  referred to. Oddly enough, no one ever questioned him closely on  the subject. A certain singular reserve of his, which alternated  curiously with his perfect frankness, prevented them from  trespassing so far on his individuality. People felt they must not.  Somehow, when Bertram Ingledew let it once be felt he did not wish  to be questioned on any particular point, even women managed to  restrain their curiosity: and he would have been either a very bold  or a very insensitive man who would have ventured to continue  questioning him any further. So, though many people hazarded  guesses as to where he had come from, nobody ever asked him the  point-blank question: Who are you, if you please, and what do you  want here?    
The Alien went out a great deal with the Monteiths. Robert himself  did not like the fellow, he said: one never quite knew what the  deuce he was driving at; but Frida found him always more and more  charming,--so full of information!--while Philip admitted he was  excellent form, and such a capital tennis player! So whenever  Philip had a day off in the country, they three went out in the  fields together, and Frida at least thoroughly enjoyed and  appreciated the freedom and freshness of the newcomer's  conversation.    
On one such day they went out, as it chanced, into the meadows that  stretch up the hill behind Brackenhurst. Frida remembered it well  afterwards. It was the day when an annual saturnalia of vulgar vice  usurps and pollutes the open downs at Epsom. Bertram did not care  to see it, he said--the rabble of a great town turned loose to  desecrate the open face of nature--even regarded as a matter of  popular custom; he had looked on at much the same orgies before in  New Guinea and on the Zambesi, and they only depressed him: so he  stopped at Brackenhurst, and went for a walk instead in the fresh  summer meadows. Robert Monteith, for his part, had gone to the  Derby--so they call that orgy--and Philip had meant to accompany  him in the dogcart, but remained behind at the last moment to take  care of Frida; for Frida, being a lady at heart, always shrank from  the pollution of vulgar assemblies. As they walked together across  the lush green fields, thick with campion and yellow-rattle, they  came to a dense copse with a rustic gate, above which a threatening  notice-board frowned them straight in the face, bearing the usual  selfish and anti-social inscription, "Trespassers will be  prosecuted."    
"Let's go in here and pick orchids," Bertram suggested, leaning  over the gate. "Just see how pretty they are! The scented white  butterfly! It loves moist bogland. Now, Mrs. Monteith, wouldn't a  few long sprays of that lovely thing look charming on your dinner-  table?"    
"But it's preserved," Philip interposed with an awestruck face.  "You can't go in there: it's Sir Lionel Longden's, and he's awfully  particular."    
"Can't go in there? Oh, nonsense," Bertram answered, with a merry  laugh, vaulting the gate like a practised athlete. "Mrs. Monteith  can get over easily enough, I'm sure. She's as light as a fawn.  May I help you over?" And he held one hand out.    
"But it's private," Philip went on, in a somewhat horrified voice;  "and the pheasants are sitting."    
"Private? How can it be? There's nothing sown here. It's all wild  wood; we can't do any damage. If it was growing crops, of course,  one would walk through it not at all, or at least very carefully.  But this is pure woodland. Are the pheasants tabooed, then? or why  mayn't we go near them?"    
"They're not tabooed, but they're preserved," Philip answered  somewhat testily, making a delicate distinction without a  difference, after the fashion dear to the official intellect.  "This land belongs to Sir Lionel Longden, I tell you, and he  chooses to lay it all down in pheasants. He bought it and paid  for it, so he has a right, I suppose, to do as he likes with it."    
"That's the funniest thing of all about these taboos," Bertram  mused, as if half to himself. "The very people whom they injure and  inconvenience the most, the people whom they hamper and cramp and  debar, don't seem to object to them, but believe in them and are  afraid of them. In Samoa, I remember, certain fruits and fish and  animals and so forth were tabooed to the chiefs, and nobody else  ever dared to eat them. They thought it was wrong, and said, if  they did, some nameless evil would at once overtake them. These  nameless terrors, these bodiless superstitions, are always the  deepest. People fight hardest to preserve their bogeys. They fancy  some appalling unknown dissolution would at once result from  reasonable action. I tried one day to persuade a poor devil of a  fellow in Samoa who'd caught one of these fish, and who was  terribly hungry, that no harm would come to him if he cooked it and  ate it. But he was too slavishly frightened to follow my advice;  he said it was taboo to the god-descended chiefs: if a mortal man  tasted it, he would die on the spot: so nothing on earth would  induce him to try it. Though to be sure, even there, nobody ever  went quite so far as to taboo the very soil of earth itself:  everybody might till and hunt where he liked. It's only in Europe,  where evolution goes furthest, that taboo has reached that last  silly pitch of injustice and absurdity. Well, we're not afraid of  the fetich, you and I, Mrs. Monteith. Jump up on the gate; I'll  give you a hand over!" And he held out one strong arm as he spoke  to aid her.    
Frida had no such fanatical respect for the bogey of vested  interests as her superstitious brother, so she mounted the gate  gracefully--she was always graceful. Bertram took her small hand  and jumped her down on the other side, while Philip, not liking to  show himself less bold than a woman in this matter, climbed over it  after her, though with no small misgivings. They strolled on into  the wood, picking the pretty white orchids by the way as they went,  for some little distance. The rich mould underfoot was thick with  sweet woodruff and trailing loosestrife. Every now and again, as  they stirred the lithe brambles that encroached upon the path, a  pheasant rose from the ground with a loud whir-r-r before them.  Philip felt most uneasy. "You'll have the keepers after you in a  minute," he said, with a deprecating shrug. "This is just full  nesting time. They're down upon anybody who disturbs the  pheasants."    
"But the pheasants can't <i>belong</i> to any one," Bertram cried, with a  greatly amused face. "You may taboo the land--I understand that's  done--but surely you can't taboo a wild bird that can fly as it  likes from one piece of ground away into another."    
Philip enlightened his ignorance by giving him off-hand a brief and  profoundly servile account of the English game-laws, interspersed  with sundry anecdotes of poachers and poaching. Bertram listened  with an interested but gravely disapproving face. "And do you mean  to say," he asked at last "they send men to prison as criminals for  catching or shooting hares and pheasants?"    
"Why, certainly," Philip answered. "It's an offence against the  law, and also a crime against the rights of property."    
"Against the law, yes; but how on earth can it be a crime against  the rights of property? Obviously the pheasant's the property of  the man who happens to shoot it. How can it belong to him and also  to the fellow who taboos the particular piece of ground it was  snared on?"    
"It doesn't belong to the man who shoots it at all," Philip  answered, rather angrily. "It belongs to the man who owns the land,  of course, and who chooses to preserve it."    
"Oh, I see," Bertram replied. "Then you disregard the rights of  property altogether, and only consider the privileges of taboo. As  a principle, that's intelligible. One sees it's consistent. But  how is it that you all allow these chiefs--landlords, don't you call  them?--to taboo the soil and prevent you all from even walking over  it? Don't you see that if you chose to combine in a body and insist  upon the recognition of your natural rights,--if you determined to  make the landlords give up their taboo, and cease from injustice,--  they'd have to yield to you, and then you could exercise your  native right of going where you pleased, and cultivate the land in  common for the public benefit, instead of leaving it, as now, to be  cultivated anyhow, or turned into waste for the benefit of the  tabooers?"    
"But it would be <i>wrong</i> to take it from them," Philip cried, growing  fiery red and half losing his temper, for he really believed it.  "It would be sheer confiscation; the land's their own; they either  bought it or inherited it from their fathers. If you were to begin  taking it away, what guarantee would you have left for any of the  rights of property generally?"    
"You didn't recognise the rights of property of the fellow who  killed the pheasant, though," Bertram interposed, laughing, and  imperturbably good-humoured. "But that's always the way with these  taboos, everywhere. They subsist just because the vast majority  even of those who are obviously wronged and injured by them really  believe in them. They think they're guaranteed by some divine  prescription. The fetich guards them. In Polynesia, I recollect,  some chiefs could taboo almost anything they liked, even a girl or  a woman, or fruit and fish and animals and houses: and after the  chief had once said, 'It is taboo,' everybody else was afraid to  touch them. Of course, the fact that a chief or a landowner has  bought and paid for a particular privilege or species of taboo, or  has inherited it from his fathers, doesn't give him any better  moral claim to it. The question is, 'Is the claim in itself right  and reasonable?' For a wrong is only all the more a wrong for  having been long and persistently exercised. The Central Africans  say, 'This is my slave; I bought her and paid for her; I've a  right, if I like, to kill her and eat her.' The king of Ibo, on the  West Coast, had a hereditary right to offer up as a human sacrifice  the first man he met every time he quitted his palace; and he was  quite surprised audacious freethinkers should call the morality of  his right in question. If you English were all in a body to see  through this queer land-taboo, now, which drives your poor off the  soil, and prevents you all from even walking at liberty over the  surface of the waste in your own country, you could easily--"    
"Oh, Lord, what shall we do!" Philip interposed in a voice of  abject terror. "If here isn't Sir Lionel!"    
And sure enough, right across the narrow path in front of them  stood a short, fat, stumpy, unimpressive little man, with a very  red face, and a Norfolk jacket, boiling over with anger.    
"What are you people doing here?" he cried, undeterred by the  presence of a lady, and speaking in the insolent, supercilious  voice of the English landlord in defence of his pheasant preserves.  "This is private property. You must have seen the notice at the  gate, 'Trespassers will be prosecuted.'"    
"Yes, we did see it," Bertram answered, with his unruffled smile;  "and thinking it an uncalled-for piece of aggressive churlishness,  both in form and substance,--why, we took the liberty to disregard  it."    
Sir Lionel glared at him. In that servile neighbourhood, almost  entirely inhabited by the flunkeys of villadom, it was a complete  novelty to him to be thus bearded in his den. He gasped with anger.  "Do you mean to say," he gurgled out, growing purple to the neck,  "you came in here deliberately to disturb my pheasants, and then  brazen it out to my face like this, sir? Go back the way you came,  or I'll call my keepers."    
"No, I will <i>not</i> go back the way I came," Bertram responded  deliberately, with perfect self-control, and with a side-glance at  Frida. "Every human being has a natural right to walk across this  copse, which is all waste ground, and has no crop sown in it. The  pheasants can't be yours; they're common property. Besides, there's  a lady. We mean to make our way across the copse at our leisure,  picking flowers as we go, and come out into the road on the other  side of the spinney. It's a universal right of which no country  and no law can possibly deprive us."    
Sir Lionel was livid with rage. Strange as it may appear to any  reasoning mind, the man really believed he had a natural right to  prevent people from crossing that strip of wood where his pheasants  were sitting. His ancestors had assumed it from time immemorial,  and by dint of never being questioned had come to regard the absurd  usurpation as quite fair and proper. He placed himself straight  across the narrow path, blocking it up with his short and stumpy  figure. "Now look here, young man," he said, with all the insolence  of his caste: "if you try to go on, I'll stand here in your way;  and if you dare to touch me, it's a common assault, and, by George,  you'll have to answer at law for the consequences."    
Bertram Ingledew for his part was all sweet reasonableness. He  raised one deprecating hand. "Now, before we come to open  hostilities," he said in a gentle voice, with that unfailing smile  of his, "let's talk the matter over like rational beings. Let's try  to be logical. This copse is considered yours by the actual law of  the country you live in: your tribe permits it to you: you're  allowed to taboo it. Very well, then; I make all possible  allowances for your strange hallucination. You've been brought up  to think you had some mystic and intangible claim to this corner of  earth more than other people, your even Christians. That claim, of  course, you can't logically defend; but failing arguments, you want  to fight for it. Wouldn't it be more reasonable, now, to show you  had some <i>right</i> or <i>justice</i> in the matter? I'm always reasonable: if  you can convince me of the propriety and equity of your claim, I'll  go back as you wish by the way I entered. If not--well, there's a  lady here, and I'm bound, as a man, to help her safely over."    
Sir Lionel almost choked. "I see what you are," he gasped out with  difficulty. "I've heard this sort of rubbish more than once before.  You're one of these damned land-nationalising radicals."    
"On the contrary," Bertram answered, urbane as ever, with charming  politeness of tone and manner: "I'm a born conservative. I'm  tenacious to an almost foolishly sentimental degree of every old  custom or practice or idea; unless, indeed, it's either wicked or  silly--like most of your English ones."    
He raised his hat, and made as if he would pass on. Now, nothing  annoys an angry savage or an uneducated person so much as the  perfect coolness of a civilised and cultivated man when he himself  is boiling with indignation. He feels its superiority an affront on  his barbarism. So, with a vulgar oath, Sir Lionel flung himself  point-blank in the way. "Damn it all, no you won't, sir!" he cried.  "I'll soon put a stop to all that, I can tell you. You shan't go on  one step without committing an assault upon me." And he drew  himself up, four-square, as if for battle.    
"Oh, just as you like," Bertram answered coolly, never losing his  temper. "I'm not afraid of taboos: I've seen too many of them."  And he gazed at the fat little angry man with a gentle expression  of mingled contempt and amusement.    
For a minute, Frida thought they were really going to fight, and  drew back in horror to await the contest. But such a warlike notion  never entered the man of peace's head. He took a step backward for  a second and calmly surveyed his antagonist with a critical  scrutiny. Sir Lionel was short and stout and puffy; Bertram  Ingledew was tall and strong and well-knit and athletic. After an  instant's pause, during which the doughty baronet stood doubling  his fat fists and glaring silent wrath at his lither opponent,  Bertram made a sudden dart forward, seized the little stout man  bodily in his stalwart arms, and lifting him like a baby, in spite  of kicks and struggles, carried him a hundred paces to one side of  the path, where he laid him down gingerly without unnecessary  violence on a bed of young bracken. Then he returned quite calmly,  as if nothing had happened, to Frida's side, with that quiet little  smile on his unruffled countenance.    
Frida had not quite approved of all this small episode, for she too  believed in the righteousness of taboo, like most other Englishwomen,  and devoutly accepted the common priestly doctrine, that the earth  is the landlord's and the fulness thereof; but still, being a woman,  and therefore an admirer of physical strength in men, she could not  help applauding to herself the masterly way in which her squire had  carried his antagonist captive. When he returned, she beamed upon  him with friendly confidence. But Philip was very much frightened  indeed.    
"You'll have to pay for this, you know," he said. "This is a law-  abiding land. He'll bring an action against you for assault and  battery; and you'll get three months for it."    
"I don't think so," Bertram answered, still placid and unruffled.  "There were three of us who saw him; and it was a very ignominious  position indeed for a person who sets up to be a great chief in the  country. He won't like the little boys on his own estate to know  the great Sir Lionel was lifted up against his will, carried about  like a baby, and set down in a bracken-bed. Indeed, I was more than  sorry to have to do such a thing to a man of his years; but you see  he <i>would</i> have it. It's the only way to deal with these tabooing  chiefs. You must face them and be done with it. In the Caroline  Islands, once, I had to do the same thing to a cazique who was  going to cook and eat a very pretty young girl of his own  retainers. He wouldn't listen to reason; the law was on his side;  so, being happily <i>not</i> a law-abiding person myself, I took him up in  my arms, and walked off with him bodily, and was obliged to drop  him down into a very painful bed of stinging plants like nettles,  so as to give myself time to escape with the girl clear out of his  clutches. I regretted having to do it so roughly, of course; but  there was no other way out of it."    
As he spoke, for the first time it really came home to Frida's mind  that Bertram Ingledew, standing there before her, regarded in very  truth the Polynesian chief and Sir Lionel Longden as much about the  same sort of unreasoning people--savages to be argued with and  cajoled if possible; but if not, then to be treated with calm  firmness and force, as an English officer on an exploring expedition  might treat a wrathful Central African kinglet. And in a dim sort  of way, too, it began to strike her by degrees that the analogy was  a true one, that Bertram Ingledew, among the Englishmen with whom  she was accustomed to mix, was like a civilised being in the midst  of barbarians, who feel and recognise but dimly and half-  unconsciously his innate superiority.    
By the time they had reached the gate on the other side of the  hanger, Sir Lionel overtook them, boiling over with indignation.    
"Your card, sir," he gasped out inarticulately to the calmly  innocent Alien; "you must answer for all this. Your card, I say,  instantly!"    
Bertram looked at him with a fixed gaze. Sir Lionel, having had  good proof of his antagonist's strength, kept his distance  cautiously.    
"Certainly <i>not</i>, my good friend," Bertram replied, in a firm tone.  "Why should <i>I</i>, who am the injured and insulted party, assist <i>you</i>  in identifying me? It was you who aggressed upon my free  individuality. If you want to call in the aid of an unjust law to  back up an unjust and irrational taboo, you must find out for  yourself who I am, and where I come from. But I wouldn't advise  you to do anything so foolish. Three of us here saw you in the  ridiculous position into which by your obstinacy you compelled me  to put you; and you wouldn't like to hear us recount it in public,  with picturesque details, to your brother magistrates. Let me say  one thing more to you," he added, after a pause, in that peculiarly  soft and melodious voice of his. "Don't you think, on reflection--  even if you're foolish enough and illogical enough really to  believe in the sacredness of the taboo by virtue of which you try  to exclude your fellow-tribesmen from their fair share of enjoyment  of the soil of England--don't you think you might at any rate  exercise your imaginary powers over the land you arrogate to  yourself with a little more gentleness and common politeness? How  petty and narrow it looks to use even an undoubted right, far more  a tribal taboo, in a tyrannical and needlessly aggressive manner!  How mean and small and low and churlish! The damage we did your  land, as you call it--if we did any at all--was certainly not a  ha'pennyworth. Was it consonant with your dignity as a chief in the  tribe to get so hot and angry about so small a value? How grotesque  to make so much fuss and noise about a matter of a ha'penny! We,  who were the aggrieved parties, we, whom you attempted to debar by  main force from the common human right to walk freely over earth  wherever there's nothing sown or planted, and who were obliged to  remove you as an obstacle out of our path, at some personal  inconvenience"--(he glanced askance at his clothes, crumpled and  soiled by Sir Lionel's unseemly resistance)--"<i>we</i> didn't lose our  tempers, or attempt to revile you. We were cool and collected. But  a taboo must be on its very last legs when it requires the aid of  terrifying notices at every corner in order to preserve it; and I  think this of yours must be well on the way to abolition. Still, as  I should like to part friends"--he drew a coin from his pocket, and  held it out between his finger and thumb with a courteous bow  towards Sir Lionel--"I gladly tender you a ha'penny in compensation  for any supposed harm we may possibly have done your imaginary  rights by walking through the wood here."
