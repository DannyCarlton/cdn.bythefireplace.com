A week or two later, while 'The Primate of Fiji' was still running  vigorously at the Ambiguities Theatre, Arthur Berkeley's second  opera, 'The Duke of Bermondsey; or, the Bold Buccaneers of the Isle  of Dogs,' was brought out with vast success and immense exultation  at the Marlborough. There is always a strong tendency to criticise  a little severely the second work of a successful beginner: people  like to assume a knowing air, and to murmur self-complacently that  they felt sure from the beginning he couldn't keep up permanently  to his first level. But in spite of that natural tendency of the  unregenerate human mind, and in spite, too, of a marked political  bias on the author's part, 'The Duke of Bermondsey' took the town  by storm almost as completely as 'The Primate of Fiji' had done before  it. Everybody said that though the principles of the piece were  really quite atrocious, when one came to think of them seriously,  yet the music and the dialogue were crisp and brisk enough to float  any amount of social or economical heresy that that clever young  man, Mr. Arthur Berkeley, might choose to put into one of his  amusing and original operas.    
The social and economical heresies, of course, were partly due  to Ernest Le Breton's insidious influence. At the same time that  Berkeley was engaged in partially converting Ernest, Ernest was  engaged in the counter process of partially converting Berkeley.  To say the truth, the conversion was not a very difficult matter  to effect; the neophyte had in him implicitly already the chief  saving doctrines of the socialistic faith, or, if one must put it  conversely, the germs of the disease were constitutionally implanted  in his system, and only needed a little external encouragement  to cring the poison out fully in the most virulent form of the  complaint. The great point of 'The Duke of Bermondsey' consisted in  the ridiculous contrast it exhibited between the wealth, dignity,  and self-importance of the duke himself, and the squalid, miserable,  shrinking poverty of the East-end purlieus from which he drew his  enormous revenues. Ernest knew a little about the East-end from  practical experience; he had gone there often with Ronald, on his  rounds of mercy, and had seen with his own eyes those dens of misery  which most people have only heard or read about. It was Ernest who  had suggested this light satirical treatment of the great social  problem, whose more serious side he himself had learnt to look  at in Max Schurz's revolutionary salon; and it was to Ernest that  Arthur Berkeley owed the first hint of that famous scene where the  young Countess of Coalbrookdale converses familiarly on the natural  beauties of healthful labour with the chorus of intelligent colliery  hands, in the most realistic of grimy costumes, from her father's  estates in Staffordshire. The stalls hardly knew whether to laugh  or frown when the intelligent colliers respectfully invited the  countess, in her best Ascot flounces and furbelows, to enjoy the  lauded delights of healthful mine labour in propria persona: but  they quite recovered their good humour when the band of theatrical  buccaneers, got up by the duke in Spanish costumes, with intent  to deceive his lawless tenants in the East-end, came unexpectedly  face to face with the genuine buccaneers of the Isle of Dogs,  clothed in real costermonger caps and second-hand pilot-jackets  of the marine-storedealers' fashionable pattern. It was all only  the ridiculous incongruity of our actual society represented in the  very faintest shades of caricature upon the stage; but it made the  incongruities more incongruous still to see them crowded together  so closely in a single concentrated tableau. Unthinking people  laughed uproariously at the fun and nonsense of the piece; thinking  people laughed too, but not without an uncomfortable side twinge of  conscientious remorse at the pity of it all. Some wise heads even  observed with a shrug that when this sort of thing was applauded  upon the stage, the fine old institutions of England were getting  into dangerous contact with these pernicious continental socialistic  theories. And no doubt those good people were really wise in their  generation. 'When Figaro came,' Arthur Berkeley said himself  to Ernest, 'the French revolution wasn't many paces behind on the  track of the ages.'    
'Better even than the Primate, Mr. Berkeley,' said Hilda Tregellis,  as she met him in a London drawing-room a few days later. 'What  a delightful scene, that of the Countess of Coalbrookdale! You're  doing real good, I do believe, by making people think about  these things more seriously, you know. As poor dear Mr. Le Breton  would have said, you've got an ethical purpose--isn't that the  word?--underlying even your comic operas. By the way, do you ever  see the Le Bretons now? Poor souls, I hear they're doing very  badly. The elder brother, Herbert Le Breton--horrid wretch!--he's  here to-night; going to marry that pretty Miss Faucit, they say;  daughter of old Mr. Faucit, the candle-maker--no, not candles,  soap I think it is--but it doesn't matter twopence nowadays, does  it? Well, as I was saying, you're doing a great deal of good  with characters like this Countess of Coalbrookdale. We want more  mixture of classes, don't we? more free intercourse between them;  more familiarity of every sort. For my part, now, I should really  very much like to know more of the inner life of the working classes.'  'If only he'd ask me to go to lunch,' she thought, 'with his dear  old father, the superannuated shoemaker! so very romantic, really!'    
But Arthur only smiled a sphinx-like smile, and answered lightly,  'You would probably object to their treatment of you as much as the  countess objected to the uupleasant griminess of the too-realistic  coal galleries. Suppose you were to fall into the hands of a logical  old radical workman, for example, who tore you to pieces, mentally  speaking, with a shake or two of his big teeth, and calmly  informed you that in his opinion you were nothing more than a very  empty-headed, pretentious, ignorant young woman--perhaps even,  after the plain-spoken vocabulary of hie kind, a regular downright  minx and hussey?'    
'Charming,' Lady Hilda answered, with perfect candour; 'so very  different from the senseless adulation of all the Hughs, and Guys,  and Berties! What I do love in talking to clever men, Mr. Berkeley,  is their delicious frankness and transparency. If they think one  a fool, they tell one so plainly, or at least they let one see it  without any reserve. Now that, you know, is really such a very  delightful trait in clever people's characters!'    
'I don't know how you can have had the opportunity of judging, Lady  Hilda,' Arthur answered, looking at her handsome open face with a  momentary glance of passing admiration--Hilda Tregellis was improving  visibly as she matured--'for no one can possibly ever have thought  anything of the sort with you, I'm certain: and that I can say  quite candidly, without the slightest tinge of flattery or adulation.'    
'What! <i>you</i> don't think me a fool, Mr. Berkeley,' cried Lady Hilda,  delighted even with that very negative bit of favourable appreciation.  'Now, that I call a real compliment, I assure you, because I know  you clever people pitch your standard of intelligence so very,  very high! You consider everybody fools, I'm sure, except the few  people who are almost as clever as you yourselves are. However, to  return to the countess: I do think there ought to be more mixture  of classes in England, and somebody told me'--this was a violent  effort to be literary on Hilda's part, by way of rising to the  height of the occasion--'somebody told me that Mr. Matthew Arnold,  who's so dreadfully satirical, and cultivated, and so forth,  thinks exactly the same thing, you know. Why shouldn't the Countess  of Coalbrookdale have really married the foreman of the colliers?  I daresay she'd have been a great deal happier with a kind-hearted  sensible man like him than with that lumbering, hunting,  pheasant-shooting, horse-racing lout of a Lord Coalbrookdale, who  would go to Norway on a fishing tour without her--now wouldn't  she?'    
'Very probably,' Berkeley answered: 'but in these matters we don't  regard happiness only,--that, you see, would be mere base, vulgar,  commonplace utilitarianism:--we regard much more that grand  impersonal overruling entity, that unseen code of social morals,  which we commonly call the <i>convenances</i>. Proper people don't  take happiness into consideration at all, comparatively: they act  religiously after the fashion that the <i>convenances</i> impose upon  them.'    
'Ah, but why, Mr. Berkeley,' Lady Hilda said, vehemently, 'why  should the whole world always take it for granted that because  a girl happens to be born the daughter of people whose name's in  the peerage, she must necessarily be the slave of the proprieties,  devoid of all higher or better instincts? Why should they take it  for granted that she's destitute of any appreciation for any kind  of greatness except the kind that's represented by a million and a  quarter in the three per cents., or a great-great-grandfather who  fought at the battle of Naseby? Why mayn't she have a spark of  originality? Why mayn't she be as much attracted by literature,  by science, by art, by... by... by beautiful music, as, say, the  daughter of a lawyer, a doctor, or, or, or a country shopkeeper?  What I want to know is just this, Mr. Berkeley: if people don't  believe in distinctions of birth, why on earth should they suppose  that Lady Mary, or Lady Betty, or Lady Winifred, must necessarily  be more banale and vulgar-minded, and common-place than plain Miss  Jones, or Miss Brown, or Miss Robinson? You admit that these other  girls may possibly care for higher subjects: then why on earth  shouldn't we, can you tell me?'    
'Certainly,' Arthur Berkeley answered, looking down into Lady  Hilda's beautiful eyes after a dreamy fashion, 'certainly there's no  inherent reason why one person shouldn't have just as high tastes  by nature as another. Everything depends, I suppose, upon inherited  qualities, variously mixed, and afterwards modified by society and  education.--It's very hot here, to-night, Lady Hilda, isn't it?'    
'Very,' Lady Hilda echoed, taking his arm as she spoke. 'Shall we  go into the conservatory?'    
'I was just going to propose it myself,' Berkeley said, with a faint  tremor thrilling in his voice. She was a very beautiful woman,  certainly, and her unfeigned appreciation of his plays and his  music was undeniably very flattering to him.    
'Unless I bring him fairly to book this evening,' Hilda thought to  herself as she swept with him gracefully into the conservatory, 'I  shall have to fall back upon the red-haired hurlyburlying Scotch  professor, after all--if I don't want to end by getting into the  clutches of one of those horrid Monties or Algies!'
