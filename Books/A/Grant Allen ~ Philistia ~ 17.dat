Arthur Berkeley's London lodgings were wonderfully snug and  comfortable for the second floor of a second-rate house in a small  retired side street near the Embankment at Chelsea. He had made  the most of the four modest little rooms, with his quick taste and  his deft, cunning fingers:--four rooms, or rather boxes, one might  almost call them; a bedroom each for himself and the Progenitor;  a wee sitting-room for meals and music--the two Berkeleys would  doubtless as soon have gone without the one as the other; and a tiny  study where Arthur might work undisturbed at his own desk upon his  new and original magnum opus, destined to form the great attraction  of the coming season at the lately-opened Ambiguities Theatre. Things  had prospered well with the former Oxford curate during the last  twelve-month. His cantata at Leeds had proved a wonderful success,  and had finally induced him to remove to London, and take to  composing as a regular profession. He had his qualms about it, to  be sure, as one who had put his hand to the plough and then turned  back; he did not feel quite certain in his own mind how far he  was justified in giving up the more spiritual for the more worldly  calling; but natures like Arthur Berkeley's move rather upon passing  feeling than upon deeper sentiment; and had he not ample ground, he  asked himself, for this reconsideration of the monetary position?  He had the Progenitor's happiness to insure before thinking of the  possible injury to his non-existent parishioners. If he was doing  Whippingham Parva or Norton-cum-Sutton out of an eloquent and  valuable potential rector, if he was depriving the Church in the  next half-century of a dignified and portly prospective archdeacon,  he is at least making his father's last days brighter and more  comfortable than his early ones had ever been. And then, was not  music, too, in its own way, a service, a liturgy, a worship? Surely  he could do higher good to men's souls--as they call them--to  whatever little spark of nobler and better fire there might lurk  within those dull clods of common clay he saw all around him--by  writing such a work as his Leeds cantata, than by stringing together  for ever those pretty centos of seventeenth-century conceits and  nineteenth-century doubts or hesitations which he was accustomed  to call his sermons! Whatever came of it, he must give up the  miserable pittance of a curacy, and embrace the career open to the  musical talents.    
So he fitted up his little Chelsea rooms in his own economically  sumptuous fashion with some bits of wall paper, a few jugs and vases,  and an etching or two after Meissonier; planted the Progenitor down  comfortably in a large easy-chair, with a melodious fiddle before  him; and set to work himself to do what he could towards elevating  the British stage and pocketing a reasonable profit on his own  account from that familiar and ever-rejuvenescent process. He was  quite in earnest, now, about producing a totally new effect of his  own; and believing in his work, as a good workman ought to do,  he wrought at it indefatigably and well in the retirement of a  second-pair back, overlooking a yardful of fluttering clothes, and  a fine skyline vista of bare, yellowish brick chimneys.    
'What part are you working at to-day, Artie?' said the old shoemaker,  looking over his son's shoulder at the blank music paper before  him. 'Quartette of Biological Professors, eh?'    
'Yes, father,' Berkeley answered with a smile. 'How do you think  it runs now?' and he hummed over a few lines of his own words, set  with a quaint lilt to his own inimitable and irresistible music:--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> And though in unanimous chorus <br> We mourn that from ages before us <br> No single enaliosaurus <br> To-day should survive, <br> <br> Yet joyfully may we bethink us, <br> With the earliest mammal to link us, <br> We still have the ornithorhyncus <br> Extant and alive!</small></i></blockquote><br>
'How do you think the score does for that, father, eh? Catching  air rather, isn't it?'    
'Not a better air in the whole piece, Artie; but, my boy, who do  you think will ever understand the meaning of the words. The gods  themselves won't know what you're driving at.'    
'But I'm going to strike out a new line, Daddie dear. I'm not going  to play to the gallery; I mean to play to the stalls and boxes.'    
'Was there ever such a born aristocrat as this young parson is!' cried  the old man, lifting up both his hands with a playful gesture of  mock-deprecation. 'He's hopeless! He's terrible! He's incorrigible!  Why, you unworthy son of a respectable Paddington shoemaker, if even  the intelligent British artizans in the gallery don't understand  you, how the dickens do you suppose the oiled and curled Assyrian  bulls in the stalls and boxes will have a glimmering idea of what  you're driving at? The supposition's an insult to the popular  intelligence--in other words, to me, sir, your Progenitor.'    
Berkeley laughed. 'I don't know about that, father,' he said, holding  up the page of manuscript music at arm's length admiringly before  him; 'but I do know one thing: this comic opera of mine is going  to be a triumphant success.'    
'So I've thought ever since you began it, Artie. You see, my boy,  there's a great many points in its favour. In the first place you  can write your own libretto, or whatever you call it; and you know  I've always held that though that Wagner man was wrong in practice--a  most inflated thunder-bomb, his Lohengrin--yet he was right in  theory, right in theory, Artie; every composer ought to be his own  poet. Well, then, again, you've got a certain peculiar vein of  humour of your own, a kind of delicate semi-serious burlesque turn  about you that's quite original, both in writing and in composing;  you're a humourist in verse and a humourist in music, that's the  long and the short of it. Now, you've hit upon a fresh lode of  dramatic ore in this opera of yours, and if my judgment goes for  anything, it'll bring the house down the first evening. I'm a bit  of a critic, Artie; by hook or by crook, you know, paper or money,  I've heard every good opera, comic or serious, that's been given  in London these last thirty years, and I flatter myself I know  something by this time about operatic criticism.'    
'You're wrong about Wagner, father,' said Arthur, still glancing  with paternal partiality at his sheet of manuscript: 'Lohengrin's  a very fine work, a grand work, I assure you. I won't let you run  it down. But, barring that, I think you're pretty nearly right in  your main judgment. I'm not modest, and it strikes me somehow that  I've invented a genre. That's about what it comes to.'    
'If you'd confine yourself to your native tongue, Mr. Parson,  your ignorant old father might have some chance of agreeing or  disagreeing with you; but as he doesn't even know what the thingumbob  you say you've invented may happen to be, he can't profitably  continue the discussion of that subject. However, my only fear is  that you may perhaps be writing above the heads of the audience.  Not in the music, Artie; they can't fail to catch that; it rings  in one's head like the song of a hedge warbler--tirree, tirree,  lu-lu-lu, la-la, tirree, tu-whit, tu-whoo, tra-la-la--but in the  words and the action. I'm half afraid that'll be over their heads,  even in the gallery. What do you think you'll finally call it?'    
'I'm hesitating, Daddy, between "Evolution" and "The Primate of  Fiji." Which do you recommend--tell me?'    
'The Primate, by all means,' said the old man gaily. 'And you  still mean to open with the debate in the Fijian Parliament on the  Deceased Grandmother's Second Cousin Bill?'    
'No, I don't, Daddy. I've written a new first scene this week, in  which the President of the Board of Trade remonstrates with the  mermaids on their remissness in sending their little ones to the  Fijian Board Schools, in order to receive primary instruction in the  art of swimming. I've got a capital chorus of mermaids to balance  the other chorus of Biological Professors on the Challenger Expedition.  I consider it's a happy cross between Ariosto and Aristophanes.  If you like, I'll give you the score, and read over the words to  you.' 'Do,' said the old man, settling himself down in comfort in  his son's easy-chair, and assuming the sternest air of an impartial  critic. Arthur Berkeley read on dramatically, in his own clever  airy fashion, suiting accent and gesture to the subject matter  through the whole first three acts of that exquisitely humorous  opera, the Primate of Fiji. Sometimes he hummed the tune over to  himself as he went; sometimes he played a few notes upon his flute  by way of striking the key-note; sometimes he rose from his seat in  his animation, and half acted the part he was reading with almost  unconscious and spontaneous mimicry. He read through the famous  song of the President of the Local Government Board, that everybody  has since heard played by every German band at the street corners;  through the marvellously catching chorus of the superannuated  tide-waiters; through the culminating dialogue between the London  Missionary Society's Agent and the Hereditary Grand Sacrificer to  the King of Fiji. Of course the recital lacked everything of the  scenery and dresses that give it so much vogue upon the stage; but  it had at least the charmingly suggestive music, the wonderful  linking of sound to sense, the droll and inimitable intermixture  of the plausible and the impossible which everybody has admired  and laughed at in the acted piece.    
The old shoemaker listened in breathless silence, keeping his eye  fixed steadily all the time upon the clean copy of the score. Only  once he made a wry face to himself, and that was in the chorus to  the debate in the Fijian Parliament on the proposal to leave off  the practice of obligatory cannibalism. The conservative party  were of opinion that if you began by burying instead of eating your  deceased wife, you might end by the atrocious practice of marrying  your deceased wife's sister; and they opposed the revolutionary  measure in that well known refrain:--    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> Of change like this we're naturally chary, <br> Nolumus leges Fijiae mutari.</small></i></blockquote><br>
That passage evidently gave the Progenitor deep pain.    
'Stick to your own language, my boy,' he murmured; 'stick to your  own language. The Latin may be very fine, but the gallery wil never  understand it.' However, when Arthur finished at last, he drew a  long breath, and laid down the roll of manuscript with an involuntary  little cry of half-stifled applause.    
'Artie,' he said rising from the chair slowly, 'Artie, that's not  so bad for a parson, I can tell you. I hope the Archbishop won't  be tempted to cite you for displaying an amount of originality  unworthy of your cloth.'    
'Father,' said Arthur, suddenly, after a short pause, with a tinge  of pensiveness in his tone that was not usual with him, in speaking  at least; 'Father, I often think I ought never to have become a  parson at all.'    
'Well, my boy,' said the old man, looking up at him sharply with  his keen eyes, 'I knew that long ago. You've never really believed  in the thing, and you oughtn't to have gone in for it from the very  beginning. It was the music, and the dresses, and the decorations  that enticed you, Artie, and not the doctrine.'    
Arthur turned towards him with a pained expression. 'Father,' he  said, half reproachfully, 'Father, dear father, dou't talk to me  like that. Don't think I'm so shallow or so dishonest as to subscribe  to opinions I don't believe in. It's a curious thing to say, a  curious thing in this unbelieving age, and I'm half ashamed to say  it, even to you; but do you know, father, I really do believe it:  in my very heart of hearts, I fancy I believe every word of it.'    
The old man listened to him compassionately and tenderly, as  a woman listens to the fears and troubles of a little child. To  him, that plain confession of faith was, in truth, a wonder and a  stumbling-block. Good, simple-hearted, easy-going, logical-minded,  sceptical shoemaker that he was, with his head all stuffed full of  Malthus, and John Stuart Mill, and political economy, and the hard  facts of life and science, how could he hope to understand the  complex labyrinth of metaphysical thinking, and childlike faith,  and aesthetic attraction, and historical authority, which made a  sensitive man like Arthur Berkeley, in his wayward, half-serious,  emotional fashion, turn back lovingly and regretfully to the fair  old creed that his father had so long deserted? How strange that  Artie, a full-grown male person, with all the learning of the schools  behind him, should relapse at last into these childish and exploded  mediaeval superstitions! How incredible that, after having been  brought up from his babyhood upward on the strong meat of the agnostic  philosophers, he should fall back in his manhood on the milk for  babes administered to him by orthodox theology! The simple-minded  old sceptic could hardly credit it, now that Arthur told him so  with his own lips, though he had more than once suspected it when he  heard him playing sacred music with that last touch of earnestness  in his execution which only the sincerest conviction and most intimate  realisation of its import can ever give. Ah well, ah well, good  sceptical old shoemaker; there are perhaps more things in heaven  and earth and in the deep soul of man than are dreamt of in your  philosophy.    
Still, though the avowal shocked and disappointed him a little, the  old man could not find it in his heart to say one word of sorrow  or disapproval, far less of ridicule or banter, to his dearly loved  boy. He felt instinctively, what Herbert Le Breton could not feel,  that this sentimental tendency of his son's, as he thought it,  lay far too deep and seemed far too sacred for mere argument or  common discussion. 'Perhaps,' he said to himself softly, 'Artie's  emotional side has got the better of his intellectual. I brought  him up without telling him any thing of these things, except  negatively, and by way of warning against superstitious tendencies;  and when he went to Oxford, and saw the doctrines tricked out in  all the authority of a great hierarchy, with its cathedrals, and  chapels, and choirs, and altars, and robes, and fal-lal finery,  it got the better of him; got the better of him, very naturally.  Artie's a cleverer fellow than his old father--had more education,  and so on; and I'm fond of him, very fond of him; but his logical  faculty isn't quite straight, somehow: he lets his feelings have  too much weight and prominence against his calmer reason! I can  easily understand how, with his tastes and leanings, the clericals  should have managed to get a hold over him. The clericals are such  insinuating cunning fellows. A very impressionable boy Artie was,  always; the poetical temperament and the artistic temperament  always is impressionable, I suppose; but shoemaking certainly does  develop the logical faculties. Seems as though the logical faculties  were situated in the fore-part of the brain, as they mark them  out on the phrenological heads; and the leaning forward that gives  us the shoemaker's forehead must tend to enlarge them--give them  plenty of room to expand and develop!' Saying which thing to himself  musingly, the father took his son's hand gently in his, and only  smoothed it quietly as he looked deep into Arthur's eyes, without  uttering a single word.    
As for Arthur Berkeley, he sat silent, too, half averting his face  from his father's gaze, and feeling a little blush of shame upon his  cheek at having been surprised unexpectedly into such an unwonted  avowal. How could he ever expect his father to understand the nature  of his feelings! To him, good old man that he was, all these things  were just matters of priestcraft and obscurantism--fables invented  by the ecclesiastical mind as a means of getting fat livings and  comfortable deaneries out of the public pocket. And, indeed, Arthur  was well accustomed at Oxford to keeping his own opinions to himself  on such subjects. What chance of sympathy or response was there for  such a man as he in that coldly critical and calmly deliberative  learned society? Not, of course, that all Oxford was wholly given  over even then to extreme agnosticism. There were High Churchmen,  and Low Churchmen, and Broad Churchmen enough, to be sure: men  learned in the Fathers, and the Canons, and the Acts of the General  Councils; men ready to argue on the intermediate state, or on the  three witnesses, or on the heretical nature of the Old Catholic  schism; men prepared with minute dogmatic opinions upon every  conceivable or inconceivable point of abstract theology. There were  people who could trace the Apostolic succession of the old Cornish  bishops, and people who could pronounce authoritatively upon the  exact distinction between justification and remission of sins. But  for all these things Arthur Berkeley cared nothing. Where, then,  among those learned exegetical theologians, was there room for one  whose belief was a matter, not of reason and argument, but of feeling  and of sympathy? He did not want to learn what the Council of Trent  had said about such and such a dogma; he wanted to be conscious  of an inner truth, to find the world permeated by an informing  righteousness, to know himself at one with the inner essence of  the entire universe. And though he could never feel sure whether  it was all illusion or not, he had hungered and thirsted after  believing it, till, as he told his father timidly that day, he  actually did believe it somehow in his heart of hearts. Let us not  seek to probe too deeply into those inner recesses, whose abysmal  secrets are never perfectly clear even to the introspective eyes  of the conscious self-dissector himself.    
After a pause Arthur spoke again. He spoke this time in a very low  voice, as one afraid to open his soul too much, even to his father.  'Dear, dear father,' he said, releasing his hand softly, 'you don't  quite understand what I mean about it. It isn't because I don't  believe, or try to believe, or hope I believe, that I think I ought  never to have become a parson. In my way, as in a glass, darkly,  I do strive my best to believe, though perhaps my belief is hardly  more in its way than Ernest Le Breton's unbelieving. I do want to  think that this great universe we see around us isn't all a mistake  and an abortion. I want to find a mind and an order and a purpose  in it; and, perhaps because I want it, I make myself believe that  I have really found it. In that hope and belief, with the ultimate  object of helping on whatever is best and truest in the world, I  took orders. But I feel now that it was an error for me. I'm not  the right man to make a parson. There are men who are born for that  role; men who know how to conduct themselves in it decently and  in seemly fashion; men who can quietly endure all its restraints,  and can fairly rise to the height of all its duties. But I can't.  I was intended for something lighter and less onerous than that.  If I stop in the Church I shall do no good to myself or to it; if  I come out of it, I shall make both parties freer, and shall be able  to do more good in my own generation. And so, father, for the very  same reasons that made me go into it, I mean to come out again. Not  in any quarrel with it, nor as turning my back upon it, but just  as the simple acknowledgment of a mistaken calling. It wouldn't  be seemly, for example, for a parson to write comic operas. But  I feel I can do more good by writing comic operas than by talking  dogmatically about things I hardly understand to people who hardly  understand me. So before I get this opera acted I mean to leave off  my white tie, and be known in future, henceforth and for ever, as  plain Arthur Berkeley.'    
The old shoemaker listened in respectful silence. 'It isn't for me,  Artie,' he said, as his son finished, 'to stand between a man and  his conscience. As John Stuart Mill says in his essay on "Liberty,"  we must allow full play to every man's individuality. Wonderful  man, John Stuart Mill; I understand his grandfather was a shoemaker.  Well, I won't talk with you about the matter of conviction; but I  never wanted you to be a parson, and I shall feel all the happier  myself when you've ceased to be one.'    
'And I,' said Arthur, 'shall feel all the freer; but if I had been  able to remain where I was, I should have felt all the worthier,  for all that.'
