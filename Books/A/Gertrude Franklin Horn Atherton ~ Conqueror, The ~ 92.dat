The challenge was delivered on Wednesday. Hamilton refused to withdraw  his services from his clients in the midst of the Circuit Court, and  July 11th, a fortnight later, was appointed for the meeting. When  Hamilton was not busy with the important interests confided to him by  his clients, he arranged his own affairs, and drew up a document for  publication, in the event of his death, in which he stated that he had  criticised Burr freely for years, but added that he bore him no  ill-will, that his opposition had been for public reasons only, that his  impressions of Burr were entertained with sincerity, and had been  uttered with motives and for purposes which appeared to himself  commendable. He announced his intention to throw away his fire, and  gave this reason for yielding to a custom which he had held in avowed  abhorrence: "The ability to be in future useful, whether in resisting  mischief or effecting good, in those crises of our public affairs which  seem likely to happen, would probably be inseparable from a conformity  with public prejudice in this particular."    
Burr spent several hours of each day in pistol practice, using the  cherry trees of Richmond Hill as targets. Thurlow Weed, in his  "Autobiography," has told of Burr's testament, written on the night  before the duel. Having neither money nor lands, but an infinitude of  debts, to bequeath his daughter, he left her a bundle of compromising  letters from women. The writers moved in circles where virtue was held  in esteem, and several were of the world of fashion. They had, with the  instinct of self-defence, which animates women even in that stage where  they idealize the man, omitted to sign their names. Burr supplied the  omission in every case and added the present address. That Hamilton  would throw away his fire was a possibility remote from the best effort  of Burr's imagination, and although he knew that no one could fire more  quickly than himself, he was not the man to go to the ground unprepared  for emergencies: if his daughter, now Mrs. Alston, would obey his hint  and blackmail, she might realize a pretty fortune. That Theodosia Burr,  even with the incentive of poverty, would have sunk to such ignominy, no  one who knows the open history of her short life will believe; but the  father, whose idol she was, insulted her and stained her memory, too  depraved and warped to understand nobility in anyone, least of all in  one of his own blood. In the study of lost souls Burr has appealed to  many analysts, and by no one has been made so attractive as by Harriet  Beecher Stowe; who, knowing naught by experience of men of the world,  either idealized them as interesting villains or transformed them into  beasts. In Burr she saw the fallen angel, and bedewed him with many  Christian tears. But I doubt if Burr, the inner and real Burr, had far  to fall. His visible divergence from first conditions was as striking  as, no doubt, it was natural. As the grandson of Jonathan Edwards, the  son of the Reverend Aaron Burr, and reared by relatives of that same  morbid, hideous, unhuman school of early New England theology, it only  needed a wayward nature in addition to brain and spirit to send him  flying on his own tangent as soon as he was old enough to think. After  that his congenital selfishness did the rest. For a time he climbed the  hill of prizes very steadily, taking, once in a way, a flight, swift as  an arrow: in addition to great ability at the bar, and a cunning which  rose to the dignity of a talent, he was handsome, magnetic, well-bred,  and polished, studied women with the precision of a vivisectionist,  assumed emotions and impulses he could not feel with such dexterity that  even men yielded to his fascination until they plumbed him; had in fact  many of the fleeting kindly instincts to which every mortal is subject  who is made of flesh and blood, or comes of a stock that has been bred  to certain ideals. Every wretch has a modicum of good in him, and in  spite of the preponderance of evil in Burr, had he been born under  kindly Southern skies with a gold spoon in his mouth, if, when ambitions  developed, he had had but to stretch out his hand to pluck the prizes of  life, instead of exercising the basest talents of his brain to overreach  more fortunate men, why it is possible that his nature might not have  hardened into a glacier: its visible third dazzling and symmetrical, its  deadly bulk skulking below the surface of the waters which divided the  two parts of him from his victims; might have died in the chaste  reclusion of an ancestral four-poster, beneficiaries at his side. But  that immalleable mind lacked the strong fibre of logic and  foresight--which is all that moral force amounts to--that lifts a man  triumphant above his worst temptations; and he paid the bitter and  hideous penalty in a poverty, loneliness, and living death that would  have moved the theologians of his blood to the uneasy suspicion that  punishment is of this earth, a logical sequence of foolish and  short-sighted acts. Both men and women are allowed a great latitude in  this world; they have little to complain of. It is only when the brain  fails in its part, or the character is gradually undermined by lying  and dishonour, that the inevitable sequence is some act which arouses  the indignation of society or jerks down the iron fist of the law. When  Burr took to the slope he slid with few haltings. In his long life of  plottings and failures, from his sympathy with the Conway Cabal to his  desperate old age, there were no depths of blackguardism that he did not  touch. Whether Madame Jumel spoke the truth or not to Hamilton on that  night of their last interview, it was entirely in keeping with his life  and character that he should kill for hire.    
On the Fourth of July, the Society of the Cincinnati gave its annual  dinner. This society, then the most distinguished in the Union, and  membered by men who had fought in the War of Independence, had, upon the  death of Washington, their first President, elected Hamilton to the  vacant office. He presided at this banquet, and never had appeared nor  felt happier. Not only did that peculiar exaltation which precedes  certain death possess him, as it possesses all men of mettle and brain  in a like condition, but the philosophy which had been born in him and  ruled his imagination through life had shrugged its shoulders and  accepted the inevitable. Hamilton knew that his death warrant had been  signed above, and he no longer experienced a regret, although he had  often felt depressed and martyred when obliged to go to the courts of  Albany and leave his family behind him. He had lost interest in his  body; his spirit, ever, by far, the strongest and the dominant part of  him, seemed already struggling for its freedom, arrogant and blithe as  it approached its final triumph. There is nothing in all life so selfish  as death; and the colossal ego which genius breeds or is bred out of,  isolated Hamilton even more completely than imminent death isolates most  men. The while he gave every moment he could spare to planning the  future comfort and welfare of his family, he felt as if he had already  bade them farewell, and wondered when and how he should meet them  again.    
At this gathering he was so gay and sportive that he infected the great  company, and it was the most hilarious banquet in the society's history.  The old warriors sighed, and wondered at his eternal youth. When he  sprang upon the table and sang his old camp-song, "The Drum," he looked  the boy they remembered at Valley Forge and Morristown. There was only  one member of the company who was unelectrified by the gay abandon of  the evening, and his sombre appearance was so marked in contrast that it  was widely commented on afterward. Burr frequently leaned forward and  stared at Hamilton in amazement. As the hilarity waxed, his taciturnity  deepened, and he finally withdrew.    
The secret was well kept. Few knew of the projected meeting, and none  suspected it, although Burr's pistol practice aroused some curiosity. He  had been a principal in a number of duels, and killed no one. But he was  known to have more than one bitter score to pay, for this last campaign  had exceeded every other in heat and fury. So many duels had studded it,  and so many more impended, that the thinking men of the community were  roused to a deep disapproval of the custom. The excitement and horror  over the sacrifice of Hamilton, full-blew this sentiment.    
On Saturday, Hamilton gave a dinner at the Grange, and a guest was one  of Washington's first aides, Colonel Trumbull. As he was leaving,  Hamilton took him aside and said, with an emphasis which impressed  Trumbull even at the moment: "You are going to Boston. You will see the  principal men there. Tell them from me, as my request, for God's sake to  cease these conversations and threatings about a separation of the  Union. It must hang together as long as it can be made to. If this Union  were to be broken, it would break my heart."    
The following day preceded the duel. Hamilton attended an entertainment  given by Oliver Wolcott, whose fortunes he had made, raising the capital  of a business that could be presided over by no one so well as a former  Secretary of the Treasury. It was a large reception, and he met many of  his old friends. Lady Kitty Duer, widowed, but pleasantly  circumstanced, was there, and Kitty Livingston, once more bearing her  old name in a second marriage. Bitter as the feeling between her house  and Hamilton still was, she had declared long since that she would not  cut him again; and although they never met in private, they often  retired to a secluded corner at gatherings and talked for an hour. His  first reason for attending this reception was to shake her hand as they  parted. Madame Jumel was there, paling the loveliness of even the young  daughters of Mrs. Jay and Lady Kitty Duer. Those who did not mob about  Hamilton surrounded her, and although her cheek was without colour, she  looked serene and scornful.    
After the reception Hamilton spent an hour with Troup. This oldest of  his friends, and Angelica, were the only people whose suspicion he  feared. Troup was quite capable of wringing Burr's neck, and his  daughter of taking some other desperate measure. But it was long now  since he had given Angelica reason for anxiety, and she had ceased to  watch him; and to-day, Troup, whom he had avoided hitherto, was treated  to such a flow of spirits that he not only suspected nothing, but  allowed himself to hope that Hamilton's health was mending. Hamilton  dared not even hold his hand longer than usual at parting, although he  longed to embrace him.    
That night, in the late seclusion of his library, Hamilton wrote two  letters to his wife, in one of which he recommended Mrs. Mitchell to her  care; then the following to Sedgwick, still a close friend, and probably  the most influential man in New England:--    <blockquote>
 NEW YORK, July 10th, 1804.    
 MY DEAR SIR: I have received two letters from you since we last saw   each other--that of the latest date being the twenty-fourth of May.   I have had on hand for some time a long letter to you, explaining   my view of the course and tendency of our politics, and my   intentions as to my own future conduct. But my plan embraced so   large a range, that, owing to much avocation, some indifferent   health, and a growing distaste for politics, the letter is still   considerably short of being finished. I write this now to satisfy   you that want of regard for you has not been the cause of my   silence.    
 I will here express but one sentiment, which is, that DISMEMBERMENT   of our EMPIRE will be a clear sacrifice of great positive   advantages, without any counterbalancing good; administering no   relief to our real disease, which is DEMOCRACY; the poison of   which, by a subdivision, will only be the more concentrated in each   part, and consequently the more virulent. King is on his way to   Boston where you may chance to see him and hear from himself his   sentiments. God bless you.    
 A.H.</blockquote>    
As he folded and sealed the letter he suddenly realized that the act was  the final touch to the order of his earthly affairs, and he lifted his  hand as though to see if it were still alive. "To-morrow night!" he  thought. "Well, now that the hour has come, I go willingly enough. I  have been permitted to live my life; why should I murmur? There has been  sufficient crowded into my forty-seven years to cover a century. I have  been permitted to play a great part in history, to patch together a  nation out of broken limbs and inform it with a brain. It is right that  I should regard myself in this final hour as a statesman and nothing  more, and that I should go without protest, now that I have no more to  do. I can only be deeply and profoundly thankful that out of three  millions of Americans I was selected, that I have conquered in spite of  all obstacles, and remained until I have nothing more to give. It is  entirely right and fitting that I should die as I have lived, in the  service of this country. Only a sacrifice can bring these distracted  States to reason and eliminate the man most dangerous to their peace. If  I have been chosen for this great part, I should be unworthy indeed if I  rebelled."
