   &#8220;Risen from the Ranks&#8221; contains the further history of Harry Walton,  who was first introduced to the public in the pages of &#8220;Bound to Rise.&#8221;  Those who are interested in learning how far he made good the promise  of his boyhood, may here find their curiosity gratified. For the  benefit of those who may only read the present volume, a synopsis of  Harry's previous life is given in the first chapter.
  In describing Harry's rise from the ranks I have studiously avoided  the extraordinary incidents and pieces of good luck, which the story  writer has always at command, being desirous of presenting my hero's  career as one which may be imitated by the thousands of boys similarly  placed, who, like him, are anxious to rise from the ranks. It is my  hope that this story, suggested in part by the career of an eminent  American editor, may afford encouragement to such boys, and teach them  that &#8220;where there is a will there is always a way.&#8221;
