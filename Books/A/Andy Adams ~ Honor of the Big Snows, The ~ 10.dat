  From the day after the caribou roast the fur-gatherers began   scattering. The Eskimos left the next morning. On the second day   Mukee's people from the west set off along the edge of the barrens.   Most of the others left by ones and twos into the wildernesses to the   south and east. 
  Less than a dozen still put off their return to the late spring   trapping, and among these were Jean de Gravois and his wife. Jean   waited until the third day. Then he went to see Jan. The boy was   bolstered up in his cot, with Cummins balancing the little M&eacute;lisse on   the edge of the bed when he came in. 
  For a time Jean sat and watched them in silence; then he made a  sign  to Cummins, who joined him at the door. 
  &quot;I am going the Athabasca way to-day,&quot; he said. &quot;I wish to talk  with  the boy before I go. I have a word to say to him which no ears  should  hear but his own. Will it be right?&quot; 
  &quot;Talk to him as long as you like,&quot; said Cummins, &quot;but don't worry  him  about the missionary. You'll not get a word from him.&quot; 
  Jan's eyes spoke with a devotion greater than words as Jean de  Gravois  came and sat close beside him. He knew that it was Jean who  had  brought him alive into the post, and now there was something in  the  suggestive grimacing of the Frenchman's face, and in the eagerness   with which he looked over his shoulder, as if he was not quite sure   but that the walls held ears, that caused the boy's heart to beat a   little faster as he speculated upon what Jean was going to say. 
  For a few moments Jean looked at the other steadily, with his thin,   black face propped in his hands and a curious smile on his lips. He   twisted his face into a dozen expressions of a language as voluble as   that of his tongue, hunched his shoulders up to his ears as he grinned   at Jan, and chuckled between his grimaces. 
  &quot;Ah, it was wan be-e-a-u-tiful fight!&quot; he said softly. &quot;You are a   brave boy, Jan Thoreau!&quot; 
  &quot;You did not see it?&quot; asked Jan. 
  Unconsciously the words came from him in French. Jean caught one of   his thin hands and laughed joyfully, for the spirit of him was French   to the bottom of his soul. 
  &quot;I see it? No, neither I nor Iowaka; but there it was in the snow,  as  plain as the eyes in your face. And did I not follow the trail that   staggered down the mountain, while Iowaka brought you back to life?   And when I came to the lake, did I not see something black out upon   it, like a charred log? And when I came to it, was it not the dead   body of the missioner from Churchill? Eh, Jan Thoreau?&quot; 
  Jan sat up in his bed with a sharp cry. 
  &quot;Sh-h-h-h-h!&quot; admonished Jean, pressing him back gently. &quot;There is  no  need of telling what is out there on the lake. Only the Blessed  Virgin  made me dream last night that you would like to see with your  own eyes  that the missioner is dead. The thaw will open up the lake in  a few  days. Then he will go down in the first slush. And&quot;&#8212;Jean looked  about  him cautiously again, and whispered low&#8212;&quot;if you see anything  about  the dead missioner that you do not understand&#8212;THINK OF JEAN DE   GRAVOIS!&quot; 
  He rose to his feet and bent over Jan's white face. 
  &quot;I am going the Athabasca way to-day,&quot; he finished. &quot;Perhaps, Jan   Thoreau, you will hear after a time that it would be best for Jean de   Gravois never to return again to this Post Lac Bain. If so, you will   find him between Fond du Lac and the Beaver River, and you can make it   in four days by driving your dogs close to the scrub-edge of the   barrens, keeping always where you can see the musk-ox to the north.&quot;   He turned to the door, and hesitated there for a moment, smiling and   shrugging his shoulders. &quot;Jean de Gravois wonders if Jan Thoreau   understands?&quot; he said, and passed out. 
  When Cummins returned, he found Jan's cheeks flushed and the boy in  a  fever. 
  &quot;Devil take that Gravois!&quot; he growled. 
  &quot;He has been a brother to me,&quot; said Jan simply. &quot;I love him.&quot; 
  On the second day after the Frenchman's departure, Jan rose free of   the fever which had threatened him for a time, and in the afternoon he   harnessed Cummins' dogs. The last of the trappers had started from the   post that morning, their sledges and dogs sinking heavily in the   deepening slush; and Jan set off over the smooth toboggan trail made   by the company's agent in his return to Fort Churchill. 
  This trail followed close along the base of the ridge upon which he   had fought the missionary, joining that of Jean de Gravois miles   beyond. Jan climbed the ridge. From where he had made his attack, he   followed the almost obliterated trail of the Frenchman and his   Malemutes until he came to the lake; and then he knew that Jean de   Gravois had spoken the truth, for he found the missionary with his   face half buried in the slush, stark dead. 
  He no longer had to guess at the meaning of Jean's words. The  bullet-  hole under the dead man's arms was too large to escape eyes  like  Jan's. Into the little hidden world which he treasured in his  heart  there came another face, to remain always with him&#8212;the face of  the  courageous little forest dandy who was hurrying with his bride  back  into the country of the Athabasca. 
  Jan allowed his dogs to walk all the way back to the post, and it  was  dusk before they arrived. Maballa had prepared supper, and Cummins  was  waiting for him. He glanced sharply at the boy. There was a smile  on  Jan's lips, and there was something in his eyes which Cummins had   never seen there before. From that night they were no longer filled   with the nervous, glittering flashes which at times had given him an   appearance almost of madness. In place of their searching suspicions,   there was a warmer and more companionable glow, and Cummins felt the   effect of the change as he ate his caribou steak and talked once more   entirely of M&eacute;lisse. 
  A Cree trapper had found Jan's violin in the snow, and had brought  it  to Maballa. Before Cummins finished his supper, the boy began to  play,  and he continued to play until the lights at the post went out  and  both the man and the child were deep in sleep. Then Jan stopped.  There  was the fire of a keen wakefulness in his eyes as he carefully   unfastened the strings of his instrument, and held it close to the oil   lamp, so that he could peer down through the narrow aperture in the   box. 
  He looked again at Cummins. The man was sleeping with his face to  the  wall. With the hooked wire which he used for cleaning his revolver  Jan  fished gently at the very end of the box, and after three or four   efforts the wire caught in something soft, which he pulled toward him.   Through the bulge in the F-hole he dragged forth a small, tightly   rolled cylinder of faded red cloth. 
  For a few moments he sat watching the deep breathing of Cummins,   unrolling the cloth as he watched, until he had spread out upon the   table before him a number of closely written pages of paper. He   weighted them at one end with his violin, and held them down at the   other with his hands. The writing was in French. Several of the pages   were in a heavy masculine hand, the words running one upon another so   closely that in places they seemed to be connected; and from them Jan   took his fingers, so that they rolled up like a spring. Over the   others he bent his head, and there came from him a low, sobbing   breath. 
  On these pages the writing was that of a woman, and from the paper   there still rose a faint, sweet scent of heliotrope. For half an hour   Jan gazed upon them, reading the words slowly, until he came to the   last page. 
  When there came a movement from over against the wall, he lifted  for  an instant a pair of startled eyes. Cummins was turning in his  sleep.  Soundlessly Jan tiptoed across the floor, opened the door,  without  disturbing the slumbering man and went out into the night. In  the  south and east there glowed a soft blaze of fire where the big  spring  moon was coming up over the forest. As Jan turned his face  toward it,  a new and strange longing crept into his heart. He  stretched out his  arms, with the papers and his violin clutched in his  hands, as if from  out of that growing glory a wonderful spirit was  calling to him. 
  For the first time in his lonely life it came to him&#8212;this call of  the  great world beyond the wilderness; and suddenly he crushed the  woman's  letter to his lips, and his voice burst from him in  whispering,  thrilling eagerness: 
  &quot;I will come to you&#8212;some day&#8212;w'en ze leetle M&eacute;lisse come too!&quot; 
  He rolled the written pages together, wrapped them in the faded red   cloth, and concealed them again in the box of his violin before he   reentered the cabin. 
  The next morning Cummins stood in the door, and said: 
  &quot;How warm the sun is! The snow and ice are going, Jan. It's spring.   We'll house the sledges to-day, and begin feeding the dogs on fish.&quot; 
  Each day thereafter the sun rose earlier, the day was longer, and  the  air was warmer; and with the warmth there now came the sweet  scents of  the budding earth and the myriad sounds of the deep, unseen  life of  the forest, awakening from its long slumber in its bed of  snow. Moose-  birds chirped their mating songs and flirted from morning  until night  in bough and air; ravens fluffed themselves in the sun;  and snowbirds  &#8212;little black-and-white beauties that were wont to  whisk about like  so many flashing gems&#8212;changed their color from day  to day until they  became new creatures in a new world. 
  The poplar buds swelled in their joy until they split like over fat   peas. The mother bears come out of their winter dens, accompanied by   little ones born weeks before, and taught them how to pull down the   slender saplings for these same buds. The moose returned from the   blizzardy tops of the great ridges, where for good reasons they had   passed the winter, followed by the wolves who fed upon their weak and   sick. Everywhere were the rushing torrents of melting snow, the   crackle of crumbling ice, the dying frost-cries of rock and earth and   tree; and each night the pale glow of the aurora borealis crept   farther and farther toward the pole in its fading glory. 
  The post fell back into its old ways. Now and then a visitor came  in  from out of the forest, but he remained for only a day or two,  taking  back into the solitude with him a few of the necessaries of  life.  Williams was busy preparing his books for the coming of the  company's  chief agent from London, and Cummins, who was helping the  factor, had  a good deal of extra time on his hands. 
  Before the last of the snow was gone, he and Jan began dragging in   logs for an addition which they planned for the little cabin. Basking   out in the sun, with a huge bearskin for a floor, M&eacute;lisse looked upon   the new home-building with wonderful demonstrations of interest.   Cummins' face glowed with pleasure as she kicked and scrambled on the   bearskin and gave shrill-voiced approval of their efforts. 
  Jan was the happiest youth in the world. It was certain that the   little M&eacute;lisse understood what they were doing, and the word passed   from Cummins and Jan to the others at the post, so that it happened   frequently during the building operations that Mukee and Per-ee, and   even Williams himself, would squat for an hour at a time in the snow   near M&eacute;lisse, marveling at the early knowledge which the great God saw   fit to put into a white baby's brain. This miracle came to be a matter   of deep discussion, in which there were the few words but much thought   of men born to silence. One day Mukee brought two little Indian babies   and set them on the bearskin, where they continued to sit in stoic   indifference&#8212;a clear proof of the superior development of M&eacute;lisse. 
  &quot;I wouldn't be surprised to hear her begin talking at any time,&quot;   confided Cummins to Jan, one evening when the boy was tuning his   violin. &quot;She is nearly six months old.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you suppose she would begin in French?&quot; asked Jan, suddenly   stopping the tightening of his strings. 
  Cummins stared. 
  &quot;Why?&quot; 
  Jan dropped his voice to an impressive whisper. 
  &quot;Because I have heard her many times say,  'Bon-bon&#8212;bonbon&#8212;bonbon'&#8212;  which means candee; and always I have  given her candee, an' now ze  leetle M&eacute;lisse say 'Bonbon' all of ze  time.&quot; 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said Cummins, eying him in half belief. &quot;Could it happen?&quot; 
  Like a shot Jan replied: 
  &quot;I began in Engleesh, an' Jan Thoreau is French!&quot; 
  He began playing, but Cummins did not hear much of the music. He  went  to the door, and stared in lonely grief at the top of the tall  spruce  over the grave. Later he said to Jan: 
  &quot;It would be bad if that were so. Give her no more sweet stuff when   she says 'Bonbon,' Jan. She must forget!&quot; 
  The next day Jan tore down the sapling barricade around the woman's   grave, and from noon until almost sunset he skirted the sunny side of   a great ridge to the south. When he came back he brought with him a   basket of the early red snow-flowers, with earth clinging to their   roots. These he planted thickly over the mound under the spruce, and   around its edge he put rows of the young shoots of Labrador tea and   backneesh. 
  As the weather grew warmer, and spring changed into summer, he took   M&eacute;lisse upon short excursions with him into the forests, and together   they picked great armfuls of flowers and Arctic ferns. The grave was   never without fresh offerings, and the cabin, with its new addition   complete, was always filled with the beautiful things that spring up   out of the earth. 
  Jan and M&eacute;lisse were happy; and in the joys of these two there was   pleasure for the others of the post, as there had been happiness in   the presence of the woman. Only upon Cummins had there settled a deep   grief. The changes of spring and summer, bringing with them all that   this desolate world held of warmth and beauty, filled him with the   excruciating pain of his great grief, as if the woman had died but   yesterday. 
  When he first saw the red flowers glowing upon her grave, he buried   his head in his arms and sobbed like a child. The woman had loved   them. She had always watched for the first red blooms to shoot up out   of the wet earth. A hundred times he had gone with her to search for   them, and had fastened the first flower in the soft beauty of her   hair. Those were the days when, like happy children, they had romped   and laughed together out there beyond the black spruce. Often he had   caught her up in his strong arms and carried her, tired and hungry but   gloriously happy, back to their little home in the clearing, where she   would sit and laugh at him as he clumsily prepared their supper. 
  Thoughts and pictures like these choked him and drove him off alone   into the depths of the wilderness. When this spirit impelled him his   moccasined feet would softly tread the paths they had taken in their   wanderings; and at every turn a new memory would spring up before him,   and he longed to fling himself down there with the sweet spirit of the   woman and die. 
  Little did he dream, at these times, that Jan and M&eacute;lisse were to   cherish these same paths, that out of the old, dead joys there were to   spring new joys, and that the new joys were to wither and die, even as   his own&#8212;for a time. Beyond his own great sorrow he saw nothing in the   future. He gave up M&eacute;lisse to Jan. 
  At last, his gaunt frame thinned by sleepless nights and days of   mental torture, he said that the company's business was calling him to   Churchill, and early in August he left for the bay.
