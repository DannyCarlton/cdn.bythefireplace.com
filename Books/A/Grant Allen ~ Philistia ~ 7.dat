November came, and with it came the Pembroke fellowship examination.  Ernest went in manfully, and tried hard to do his best; for  somehow, in spite of the immorality of fellowships, he had a sort  of floating notion in his head that he would like to get one,  because he was beginning to paint himself a little fancy picture  of a home that was to be, with a little fairy Edie flitting through  it, and brightening it all delightfully with her dainty airy  presence. So he even went so far as to mitigate considerably the  native truculence of his political economy paper, after Edie's  advice--not, of course, by making any suggestion of opinions he did  not hold, but by suppressing the too-prominent expression of those  he actually believed in. Max Schurz's name was not once mentioned  throughout the whole ten or twelve pages of closely written foolscap;  'Gold and the Proletariate' was utterly ignored; and in place of  the strong meat served out for men by the apostles of socialism in  the Marylebone dancing-saloon, Ernest dished up for his examiner's  edification merely such watery milk for babes as he had extracted  from the eminently orthodox economical pages of Fawcett, Mill, and  Thorold Rogers. He went back to his rooms, satisfied that he had  done himself full justice, and anxiously waited for the result to  be duly announced on the Saturday morning.    
Was it that piece of Latin prose, too obviously modelled upon the  Annals of Tacitus, while the senior tutor was a confirmed Ciceronian,  with the Second Philippic constitutionally on the brain? Was  it the Greek verse, containing one senarius with a long syllable  before the caesura in the fifth foot, as Herbert pointed out to  his brother on the very evening when that hideous oversight--say  rather crime--had been openly perpetrated in plain black and white  on a virgin sheet of innocent paper? Was it some faint ineffaceable  savour of the Schurzian economics, peeping through in spite of all  disguises, like the garlic in an Italian ragout, from under the  sedulous cloak of Ricardo's theory of rent? Was it some flying  rumour, extra-official, and unconnected with the examination in  any way, to the effect that young Le Breton was a person of very  dubious religious, political, and social orthodoxy? Or was it merely  that fortunate dispensation of Providence whereby Oxford almost  invariably manages to let her best men slip unobserved through her  fingers, and so insures a decent crop of them to fill up her share  of the passing vacancies in politics, literature, science, and art?  Heaven or the Pembroke examiners alone can answer these abstruse  and difficult questions; but this much at least is certain, that  when Ernest Le Breton went into the Pembroke porter's lodge on the  predestined Saturday, he found another name than his placarded upon  the notice board, and turned back, sick at heart and disappointed,  to his lonely lodgings. There he spent an unhappy hour or two, hewing  down what remained of his little aerial castle off-hand; and then  he went out for a solitary row upon the upper river, endeavouring  to work off his disappointment like a man, with a good hard spell  of muscular labour.    
Edie had already returned to Calcombe-Pomeroy, so in the evening  he went to tell his misfortune to Harry Oswald. Harry was really  sorry to hear it, for Ernest was his best friend in Oxford, and  he had hoped to have him settled close by. 'You'll stop up and  try again for Christ Church in February, won't you, Le Breton?' he  asked.    
'No,' said Ernest, shaking his head a little gloomily; 'I don't  think I will. It's clear I'm not up to the Oxford standard for a  fellowship, and I couldn't spend another term in residence without  coming down upon my mother to pay my expenses--a thing she can't  easily afford to do. So I suppose I must fall back for the present  upon the Exmoor tutorship. That'll give me time to look about me,  till I can get something else to do; and after all, it isn't a bit  more immoral than a fellowship, when one comes to look it fairly  in the face. However, I shall go first and ask Herr Max's opinion  upon the matter.'    
'I'm going to spend a fortnight in town in the Christmas vac,'  said Oswald, 'and I should like to go with you to Max's again, if  I may.'    
Ernest coloured up a little, for he would have liked to invite Oswald  to his mother's house; and yet he felt there were two reasons why  he should not do so; he must himself be dependent this time upon  his mother's hospitality, and he didn't think Lady Le Breton would  be perfectly cordial in her welcome to Harry Oswald.    
In the end, however, it was arranged that Harry should engage rooms  at his former lodgings in London, and that Ernest should take him  once more to call upon the old socialist when he went to consult  him on the question of conscience.    
'For my part, Ernest,' said Lady Le Breton to her son, the morning  after his return from Oxford, 'I'm not altogether sorry you didn't  get this Pembroke fellowship. It would have kept you among the  same set you are at present mixing in for an indefinite period.  Of course now you'll accept Lady Exmoor's kind proposal. I saw her  about it the same morning we got Hilda's letter; and she offers  200L. a year, which, of course, is mere pocket money, as your board  and lodging are all found for you, so to speak, and you'll have  nothing to do but to dress and amuse yourself.'    
'Well, mother, I shall see about it. I'm going to consult Herr  Schurz upon the subject this morning.'    
'Herr Schurz!' said Lady Le Breton, in her bitterest tone of irony.  'It appears to me you make that snuffy old German microscope man  your father confessor. It's very disagreeable to a mother to find  that her sons, instead of taking her advice about what is most  material to their own interests, should invariably go to confer  with communist refugees and ignorant ranters. Ronald, what is your  programme, if you please, for this morning's annoyance?'    
Ronald, with the fear of the fifth commandment steadily before  his eyes, took no notice of the last word, and answered calmly,  'You know, mother, this is the regular day for the mission-house  prayer-meeting.'    
'The mission-house prayer-meeting! I know nothing of the sort, I  assure you. I don't keep a perfect calendar in my mind of all your  meetings and your religious engagements. Then I suppose I must go  alone to the Waltons' to see Mr. Walton's water-colours?'    
'I'll give up the prayer-meeting, if you wish it,' Ronald answered,  with his unvarying meekness. 'Only, I'm afraid I must walk very  slowly. My cough's rather bad this morning.'    
'No, no,' Ernest put in, 'you mustn't dream of going, Ronald;  I couldn't allow you to walk so far on any account. I'll put off  my engagement with Oswald, who was going with me to Herr Schurz's,  and I'll take you round to the Waltons', mother, whenever you like.'    
'Dear me, dear me,' moaned Lady Le Breton, piteously, pretending  to wring her hands in lady-like and mitigated despair; 'I can't  do anything without its being made the opportunity for a scene, it  seems. I shall <i>not</i> go to the Waltons'; and I shall leave you both  to follow your own particular devices to your heart's content. I'm  sorry I proposed anything whatsoever, I'm sure, and I shall take  care never to do such an imprudent thing again.' And her ladyship  walked in her stateliest and most chilly manner out of the freezing  little dining-room.    
'It's a great cross, living always with poor mother, Ernest,' said  Ronald, his eyes filling with tears as he spoke; 'but we must try  to bear with her, you know, for after all she leads a very lonely  life herself, because she's so very unsympathetic.' Ernest took  the spare white hand in his and smoothed it compassionately. 'My  dear, dear Ronald,' he said, 'I know it's hard for you. I must try  the best I can to make it a little easier!'    
They walked together as far as the mission-house, arm in arm, for  though in some things the two young Le Bretons were wide apart  as the poles, in others they were fundamentally at one in inmost  spirit; and even Ronald, in spite of his occasional little narrow  sectarianisms, felt the underlying unity of purpose no less than  Ernest. He was one of those enthusiastic ethereal natures which  care little for outer forms or ceremonies, and nothing at all for  churches and organisations, but love to commune as pure spirit  with pure spirit, living every day a life of ecstatic spirituality,  and never troubling themselves one whit about theological controversy  or established religious constitutions. As long as Ronald Le Breton  could read his Greek Testament every morning, and talk face to  face in their own tongue with the Paul of First Corinthians or the  John of the Epistles, in the solitude of his own bedroom, he was  supremely indifferent about the serious question, of free-will  and fore-knowledge, or about the important question of apostolical  succession, or even about that other burning question of eternal  punishment, which was just then setting his own little sect of  Apostolic Christian Missioners roundly by the ears. These things  seemed to his enthusiastic mind mere fading echoes of an alien  language; all that he himself really cared for in religion was the  constant sense of essential personal communion with that higher  Power which spoke directly to his soul all day long and always; or  the equally constant sense of moral exaltation which he drew from  the reading of the written Word in its own original language. He  had never <i>become</i> an Apostolic Christian; he had grown up to be one,  unconsciously to himself. 'Your son Ronald's religion, my dear  Lady Le Breton,' Archdeacon Luttrell used often to say, 'is, I  fear, too purely emotional. He cannot be made to feel sufficiently  the necessity for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal Christianity.'  To Ronald himself, he might as well have talked about the necessity  for a sound practical grasp of doctrinal Buddhism. And if Ronald  had really met a devout Buddhist, he would doubtless have found,  after half an hour's conversation, that they were at one in everything  save the petty matter of dialect and vocabulary.    
At Oswald's lodging, Ernest found his friend ready and waiting for  him. They went on together to the same street in Marylebone as  before, and mounted the stair till they reached Herr Schurz's gloomy  little work-room on the third floor. The old apostle was seated  at his small table by the half-open window, grinding the edges of  a lens to fit the brass mounting at his side; while his daughter  Uta, a still good-looking, quiet, broad-faced South German woman,  about forty or a little more, sat close by, busily translating a  scientific book into English by alternate reading and consultation  with her father. Harry saw the title on her page was 'Researches  into the Embryology of the Isopodal Crustaceans,' and conceived  at once an immense respect for the learning and wisdom of the  communist exile's daughter. Herr Schurz hardly stopped a moment  from his work--he never allowed his numerous visitors to interfere  in any way with his daily duties--but motioned them both to seats  on the bare bench beside him, and waited to bear the nature of  their particular business. It was an understood thing that no one  came to see the Socialist leader on week days except for a good  and sufficient reason.    
The talk at first was general and desultory; but after a little time  Ernest brought conversation round to its proper focus, and placed  his case of conscience fairly before his father confessor. Was it  allowable for a consistent socialist to accept the place of tutor  to the son of a peer and a landowner?    
'For my part, Herr Schurz,' Oswald said confidently, 'I don't see  any reason on earth, from the point of view of any political economy  whatsoever, why Ernest shouldn't take the position. The question  isn't how the Exmoors have come by their money, even allowing that  private property in land is in itself utterly indefensible; which  is a proposition I don't myself feel inclined unreservedly to admit,  though I know you and Le Breton do: the real question's this,--since  they've got this money into their hands to distribute, and since  in any case they will have the distribution of it, isn't it better  that some of it should go into Le Breton's pocket than that it  should go into any other person's? That's the way I for my part  look at the matter.'    
'What do you say to that, friend Ernest?' asked the old German,  smiling and waiting to see whether Ernest would detect what from  their own standpoint he regarded as the ethical fallacy of Harry  Oswald's argument.    
'Well, to tell you the truth, Herr Schurz,' answered Ernest, in his  deliberate, quiet way, 'I don't think I've envisaged the subject  to myself from quite the same point of view as Oswald has done. I  have rather asked myself whether it was right of a man to accept  a function in which he would really be doing nothing worthy for  humanity in return for his daily board and lodging. It isn't so much  a question who exactly is to get certain sums out of the Exmoors'  pockets, which ought no doubt never to have been in them; it's more  a question whether a man has any right to live off the collective  labour of the world, and do nothing of any good to the world on  his own part by way of repayment.'    
'That's it, friend Ernest,' cried the old man, with a pleased nod  of his big grey head; 'the socialistic Iliad in a nutshell! That's  the very root of the question. Don't be deceived by capitalist  sophisms. So long as we go on each of us trying to get as much as  we can individually out of the world, instead of asking what the  world is getting out of us, in return, there will be no revolution  and no millennium. We must make sure that we're doing some good  ourselves, instead of sponging upon the people perpetually to feed  us for nothing. What's the first gospel given to man at the creation  in your popular cosmogonies? Why, that in the sweat of his face  shall he eat bread, and till the ground from which he was taken.  That's the native gospel of the toiling many, always; your doctrines  of fair exchange, and honest livelihoods, and free contract, and  all the rest of it, are only the artificial gospel of the political  economists, and of the bourgeoisie and the aristocrats into whose  hands they play--the rascals!'    
'Then you think I oughtn't to take the post?' asked Ernest, a little  ruefully.    
'I don't say that, Le Breton--I don't say that,' said Herr Schurz,  more quietly than before, still grinding away at his lens. 'The  question's a broad one, and it has many aspects. The best work  a man can do is undoubtedly the most useful work--the work that  conduces most to the general happiness. But we of the proletariate  can't take our choice always: as your English proverb plainly puts  it, with your true English bluntness, "beggars mustn't be choosers."  We must, each in his place, do the work that's set before us by the  privileged classes. It's impossible for us to go nicely discriminating  between work that's useful for the community, work that's merely  harmless, and work that's positively detrimental. How can we insure  it? A man's a printer, say. There's a generally useful trade, in  which, on the whole, he labours for the good and enlightenment of  the world--for he may print scientific books, good books, useful  books; and most printing, on the average, is useful. But how's he  to know what sort of thing he's printing? He may be printing "Gold  and the Proletariate," or he may be printing obscurantist and  retrogressive treatises by the enemies of humanity. Look at my own  trade, again. You'd say at first sight, Mr. Oswald, that to make  microscopes must be a good thing in the end for the world at large:  and so it is, no doubt; but half of them--ay, more than half of  them--are thrown away: mere wasted labour, a good workman's time  and skill lavished needlessly on some foolish rich man's caprices  and amusement. Often enough, now, I make a good instrument--an  instrument, with all its fittings, worth fifty or a hundred pounds.  That takes a long time to make, and I'm a skilled workman; and  the instrument may fall into the hands of a scientific man who'll  use it in discovery, in verification, in promoting knowledge, in  lessening disease and mitigating human suffering. That's the good  side of my trade. But, mark you, now,' and the old man wiped his  forehead rapidly with his sleeve, 'it has its bad side too. As often  as not, I know, some rich man will buy that machine, that cost me  so much time and trouble to make, and will buy a few dozen stock  slides with it, and will bring it out once in a moon to show his  children or a few idle visitors the scales on a butterfly's wing,  or the hairs on the leg of a common flea. Uta sets those things  up by the thousand for the dealers to sell to indolent dilettanti.  The appetite of the world at large for the common flea is simply  insatiable. And it's for that, perhaps, that I'm spoiling my  eyesight now, grinding and grinding and grinding at this very lens,  and fitting the thing to an accurate fraction of a millimetre, as  we always fit these things--we who are careful and honest workmen--to  show an idle man's friends the hairs on a flea's fore-leg. If that  isn't enough to make a man ashamed of our present wasteful and  chaotic organisation, I should think he must be a survival from  the preglacial epoch--as, indeed, most of us actually are!'    
'But, after all, Herr Schurz,' said Harry, expostulating, 'you get  paid for your labour, and the rich man is doing better by encouraging  your skill than by encouraging the less useful skill of other  workmen.'    
'Ah, yes,' cried Herr Schurz, warmly, 'that's the doctrine of the  one-eyed economists; that's the capitalist way of looking at it;  but it isn't our way--it isn't ours. Is it nothing, think you,  that all that toil of mine--of a sensible man's--goes to waste,  to gratify the senseless passing whim of a wealthy nobody? Is it  nothing that he uselessly monopolises the valuable product of my  labour, which in other and abler hands might be bringing forth good  fruit for the bettering and furthering of universal humanity? I  tell you, Mr. Oswald, half the best books, half the best apparatus,  half the best appliances in all Europe, are locked up idle in  rich men's cabinets, effecting no good, begetting no discoveries,  bringing forth no interest, doing nothing but foster the anti-social  pride of their wealthy possessors. But that isn't what friend  Ernest wants to ask me about to-day. He wants to know about his own  course in a difficult case; and instead of answering him, here am  I, maundering away, like an old man that I am, into the generalised  platitudes of "Gold and the Proletariate." Well, Le Breton, what  I should say in your particular instance is this. A man with the  fear of right before his eyes may, under existing circumstances,  lawfully accept any work that will keep him alive, provided he sees  no better and more useful work equally open to him. He may take  the job the capitalists impose, if he can get nothing worthier to  do elsewhere. Now, if you don't teach this young Tregellis, what  alternative have you? Why, to become a master in a school--Eton,  perhaps, or Rugby, or Marlborough--and teach other equally useless  members of prospective aristocratic society. That being so, I think  you ought to do what's best for yourself and your family for the  present--for the present--till the time of deliverance comes. You  see, there is one member of your family to whom the matter is of  immediate importance.'    
'Ronald,' said Ernest, interrupting him.    
'Yes, Ronald. A good boy; a socialist, too, though he doesn't know  it--one of us, born of us, and only apart from us in bare externals.  Well, would it be most comfortable for poor Ronald that you should  go to these Exmoor people, or that you should take a mastership,  get rooms somewhere, and let him live with you? He's not very happy  with your mother, you say. Wouldn't he be happier with you? What  think you? Charity begins at home, you know: a good proverb--a  good, sound, sensible, narrow-minded, practical English proverb!'    
'I've thought of that,' Ernest said, 'and I'll ask him about it.  Whichever he prefers, then, I'd better decide upon, had I?'    
'Do so,' Herr Max answered, with a nod. 'Other things equal, our  first duty is to those nearest to us.'    
What Herr Max said was law to his disciples, and Ernest went his  way contented.    
'Mr. Oswald seems a very nice young man,' Uta Schurz said, looking  up from the microscope slides she had begun to mount at the moment  her regular translating work was interrupted by their sudden entry.  She had been taking quiet glances at Harry all the while, in her  unobtrusive fashion; for Uta had learned always to be personally  unobtrusive--'the prophet's donkey,' those irreverent French exiles  used to call her--and she had come to the conclusion that he was  a decidedly handsome and manly fellow.    
'Which do you like best, Uta--Oswald or Le Breton?' asked her  father.    
'Personally,' Uta answered, 'I should prefer Mr. Oswald. To live  always with Mr. Le Breton would be like living with an abstraction.  No woman would ever care for him; she might just as well marry  Spinoza's Ethics or the Ten Commandments. He's a perfect model of  a socialist, and nothing else. Mr. Oswald has some human nature in  him as well.'    
'There are two kinds of socialists,' said Herr Max, bending once  more over his glasses; 'the one kind is always thinking most of  its rights; the other kind is always thinking most of its duties.  Oswald belongs to the first, Le Breton to the second. I've often  observed it so among men of their two sorts. The best socialists  never come from the bourgeoisie, nor even from the proletariate;  they come from among the voluntarily declasses aristocrats. Your  workman or your bourgeois who has risen, and who interests himself  in social or political questions, is always thinking, "Why shouldn't  I have as many rights and privileges as these other people have?"  The aristocrat who descends is always thinking, "Why shouldn't  these other people have as many rights and privileges as I have?"  The one type begets aggressive self-assertion, the other type  begets a certain gentle spirit of self-effacement. You don't often  find men of the aristocratic class with any ethical element in  them--their hereditary antecedents, their breeding, their environment,  are all hostile to it; but when you do find them, mark my words,  Uta, they make the truest and most earnest friends of the popular  cause of any. Their sympathy and interest in it is all unselfish.'    
'And yet,' Uta answered firmly, 'I still prefer Mr. Oswald. And  if you care for my opinion, I should say that the aristocrat does  all the dreaming, but the bourgeois does all the fighting; and  that's the most important thing practically, after all.'    
An hour later, Ernest was talking his future plans over with his  brother Ronald. Would it be best for Ronald that he should take  a mastership, and both should live together, or that he should go  for the present to the Exmoors', and leave the question of Ronald's  home arrangements still unsettled?    
'It's so good of you to think of me in the matter, Ernest,' Ronald  said, pressing his hand gently; 'but I don't think I ought to  go away from mother before I'm twenty-one. To tell you the truth,  Ernest, I hardly flatter myself she'd be really sorry to get rid  of me; I'm afraid I'm a dreadful thorn in her side at present; she  doesn't understand my ways, and perhaps I don't sympathise enough  with hers; but still, if I were to propose to go, I feel sure  she'd be very much annoyed, and treat it as a serious act of  insubordination on my part. While I'm a minor, at least, I ought  to remain with her; the Apostle tells us to obey our parents, in  the Lord; and as long as she requires nothing from me that doesn't  involve a dereliction of principle I think I must bear with it,  though I acknowledge it's a cross, a heavy cross. Thank you so much  for thinking of it, dearest Ernest.' And his eyes filled once more  with tears as he spoke.    
So it was finally arranged that for the present at least Ernest  should accept Lady Exmoor's offer, and that as soon as Ronald  was twenty-one he should look about for a suitable mastership, in  order for the two brothers to go immediately into rooms together.  Lady Le Breton was surprised at the decision; but as it was in her  favour, she wisely abstained from gratifying her natural desire to  make some more uncomplimentary references to the snuffy old German  socialist. Sufficient unto the day was the triumph thereof; and she  had no doubt in her own mind that if once Ernest could be induced  to live for a while in really good society the well-known charms  and graces of that society must finally tame his rugged breast,  and wean him away from his unaccountable devotion to those horrid  continental communists.
