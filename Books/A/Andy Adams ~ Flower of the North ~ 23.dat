  For a moment Philip bowed his head, and then he turned and went   noiselessly from the room, without speaking. As he closed the door   softly behind him he looked back, and from her attitude beside  Pierre  he knew that Jeanne was whispering a prayer. A vision  flashed before  him, so quick that it had come like a ray of light  &#8212;a vision of  another hour, years and years ago, when Pierre had  knelt beside HER,  and when he had lifted up his wild, half-thought  prayer out in the  death-chill of the snowy barrens. And this was  his reward, to have  Jeanne kneel beside him as the soul which had  loved her so faithfully  took its flight. 
  Philip could not see when he turned his face to the light of the   office. For the first time the grief which he had choked back  escaped  in a gasping break in his voice, and he wiped his eyes  with his  pocket-handkerchief. He knew that MacDougall was looking  upon his  weakness, but he did not at first see that there was  another person in  the room besides the engineer. This second  person rose to meet him,  while MacDougall remained in his seat,  and as he came out into the  clearer light of the room Philip could  scarce believe his eyes. 
  It was Gregson! 
  &quot;I am sorry that I came in just at this time, Phil,&quot; he greeted,   in a low voice. 
  Philip stared, still incredulous. He had never seen Gregson as he   looked now. The artist advanced no farther. He did not hold out  his  hand. There was none of the joy of meeting in his face. His  eyes  shifted to the door that led into the death-chamber, and they  were  filled with the gloom of a condemned man. With a low word  Philip held  out his hand to meet his old comrade's. Gregson drew  back. 
  &quot;No&#8212;not now,&quot; he said. &quot;Wait&#8212;until you have heard me.&quot; 
  Something in his cold, passionless voice stopped Philip. He saw   Gregson glance toward MacDougall, and understood what he meant.  Going  to the engineer, he placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke  so that  only he could hear. 
  &quot;She is in there, Mac&#8212;with Pierre. She wanted to be alone with   him for a few minutes. Will you wait for her&#8212;outside&#8212;at the  door,  and take her over to Cassidy's wife? Tell her that I will  come to her  in a little while.&quot; 
  He followed MacDougall to the door, speaking to him in a low   voice, and then turned to Gregson. The artist had seated himself  at  one side of the small office table, and Philip sat down  opposite him,  holding out his hand to him again. 
  &quot;What is the matter, Greggy?&quot; 
  &quot;This is not a time for long explanations,&quot; said the artist, still   holding back his hand. &quot;They can come later, Phil. But to-night&#8212;   now&#8212;you must understand why I cannot shake hands with you. We  have  been friends for a good many years. In a few minutes we will  be  enemies&#8212;or you will be mine. One thing, before I go on, I must  ask of  you. I demand it. Whatever passes between us during the  next ten  minutes, say no word against Eileen Brokaw. I will say  what you might  say&#8212;that for a time her soul wandered, and was  almost lost. But it  has come back to her, strong and pure. I love  her. Some strange fate  has ordained that she should love me,  worthless as I am. She is to be  my wife.&quot; 
  Philip's hand was still across the table. 
  &quot;Greggy&#8212;Greggy&#8212;God bless you!&quot; he cried, softly. &quot;I know what it   is to love, and to be loved. Why should I be your enemy because   Eileen Brokaw's heart has turned to gold, and she has given it to   you? Greggy, shake!&quot; 
  &quot;Wait,&quot; said Gregson, huskily. &quot;Phil, you are breaking my heart.   Listen. You got my note? But I did not desert you so abominably. I   made a discovery that last night of yours in Churchill. I went to   Eileen Brokaw, and to-morrow&#8212;some time&#8212;if you care I will tell  you  of all that happened. First you must know this. I have found  the  'power' that is fighting you down below. I have found the man  who is  behind the plot to ruin your company, the man who is  responsible for  Thorpe's crimes, the man who is responsible&#8212;for&#8212;  that&#8212;in&#8212;there.&quot; 
  He leaned across the table and pointed to the closed door. 
  &quot;And that man&#8212;&quot; 
  For a moment he seemed to choke. 
  &quot;Is Brokaw, the father of my affianced wife!&quot; 
  &quot;Good God!&quot; cried Philip. &quot;Gregson, are you mad?&quot; 
  &quot;I was almost mad, when I first made the discovery,&quot; said Gregson,   as cold as ice. &quot;But I am sane now. His scheme was to have the   government annul your provisional license. Thorpe and his men were  to  destroy this camp, and kill you. The money on hand from stock,  over  six hundred thousand dollars, would have gone into Brokaw's  pockets.  There is no need of further detail&#8212;now&#8212;for you can  understand. He  knew Thorpe, and secured him as his agent. It was  merely a whim of  Thorpe's to take the name of Lord Fitzhugh  instead of something less  conspicuous. Three months before Brokaw  came to Churchill he wished to  get detailed instructions to Thorpe  which he dared not trust to a  wilderness mail service. He could  find no messenger whom he dared  trust. So he sent Eileen. She was  at Fort o' God for a week. Then she  came to Churchill, where we  saw her. The scheme was that Brokaw should  bribe the ship's  captain to run close into Blind Eskimo Point, at  night, and signal  to Thorpe and Eileen, who would be waiting. It  worked, and Eileen  and Thorpe came on with the ship. At the  landing&#8212;you remember&#8212;  Eileen was met by the girl from Fort o' God.  In order not to  betray herself to you she refused to recognize her.  Later she told  her father, and Thorpe and Brokaw saw in it an  opportunity to  strike a first blow. Brokaw had brought two men whom he  could  trust, and Thorpe had four or five others at Churchill. The  attack  on the cliff followed, the object being to kill the man, but  take  the girl unharmed, A messenger was to take the news of what   happened to Fort o' God, and lay the crime to men who had run up  to  Churchill from your camp. Chance favored you that night, and  you  spoiled their plan. Chance favored me, and I found Eileen. It  is  useless for me to go into detail as to what happened after  that,  except to say this&#8212;that Eileen knew nothing of the proposed  attack,  that she was ignorant of the heinousness of the plot  against you, and  that she was almost as much a tool of her father  as you. Phil&#8212;&quot; 
  For the first time there came a pleading light into Gregson's eyes   as he leaned across the table. 
  &quot;Phil, if it wasn't for Eileen I would not be here. I thought that   she would kill herself when I told her as much of the story as I   knew. She told me what she had done; she confessed for her father.  In  that hour of her agony I could not keep back my love. We  plotted. I  forged a letter, and made it possible to accompany  Brokaw and Eileen  up the Churchill. It was not my purpose to join  you, and so Eileen  professed to be taken ill. We camped, back from  the river, and I sent  our two Indians back to Churchill, for  Eileen and I wished to be alone  with Brokaw in the terrible hour  that was coming. That is all.  Everything is revealed. I have come  to you as quickly as I could, to  find that Thorpe is dead. In my  own selfishness I would have shielded  Brokaw, arguing that he  could pay Thorpe, and work honorably  henceforth. You would never  have known. It is Eileen who makes this  confession, not I. Phil,  her last words to me were these: 'You love  me. Then you will tell  him all this. Only after this, if he shows us a  mercy which we do  not deserve, can I be your wife.' 
  &quot;There is only one other thing to add. I have shown Brokaw a ray   of hope. He will hand over to you all his rights in the company  and  the six hundred thousand in the treasury. He will sign over to  you, as  repurchase money for whatever stock you wish to call in,  practically  his whole fortune&#8212;five hundred thousand. He will  disappear,  completely and forever. Eileen and I will hunt out our  own little  corner in a new world, and you will never hear of us  again. This is  what we have planned to do, if you show us mercy.&quot; 
  Philip had not spoken during Gregson's terrible recital. He sat   like one turned to stone. Rage, wonder, and horror burned so  fiercely  in his heart that they consumed all evidence of emotion.  And to arouse  him now there came an interruption that sent the  blood flushing back  into his face&#8212;a low knock at the closed door,  a slow lifting of the  latch, the appearance of Jeanne. Through her  tears she saw only the  man she loved, and sobbing aloud now, like  a child, she stretched out  her arms to him; and when he sprang to  her and caught her to his  breast, she whispered his name again and  again, and stroked his face  with her hands. Love, overpowering,  breathing of heaven, was in her  touch, and as she lifted her face  to him of her own sweet will now,  entreating him to kiss her and  to comfort her for what she had lost,  he saw Gregson moving with  bowed head, like a stricken thing, toward  the outer door. In that  moment the things that had been in his heart  melted away, and  raising a hand above his head, he called, softly: 
  &quot;Tom Gregson, my old chum, if you have found a love like this,   thank your God. My own love I would lose if I destroyed yours. Go   back to Eileen. Tell Brokaw that I accept his offers. And when you   come back in a few days, bring Eileen. My Jeanne will love her.&quot; 
  And Jeanne, looking from Philip's face, saw Gregson, for the first   time, as he passed through the door.
