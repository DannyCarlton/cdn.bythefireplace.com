  Philip broke the silence. 
  &quot;Now&#8212;you understand.&quot; 
  &quot;It is impossible!&quot; gasped Gregson. &quot;I cannot believe this! It&#8212;it   might have happened a thousand&#8212;two thousand years ago&#8212;but not  now.  My God, man!&quot; he cried, more excitedly. &quot;You do not mean to  tell me  that you believe this will be done?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Philip. 
  &quot;It is impossible!&quot; exclaimed Gregson again, crushing the letter   in his hand. &quot;A man doesn't live&#8212;a combination doesn't exist&#8212;  that  would start such a hell loose as this&#8212;in this way!&quot; 
  Philip smiled grimly. 
  &quot;The man does live, and the combination does exist,&quot; he said,   slowly. &quot;Greggy, I have known of men, and of combinations who have   spent millions, who have sacrificed everything of honor and truth,   who have driven thousands of men, women, and children to   starvation&#8212;and worse&#8212;to achieve a victory in high finance. I  have  known of men and combinations who have broken almost every  law of man  and God in the fight for money and power. And so have  you! You have  associated with some of these men. You have laughed  and talked with  them, smoked with them, and have dined at their  tables. You spent a  week at Selden's summer borne, and it was  Selden who cornered wheat  three years ago and raised the price of  bread two cents a loaf. It was  Selden who brought about the bread  riots in New York, Chicago, and a  score of other cities, who swung  wide the prison doors for thousands,  whose millions were gained at  a cost of misery, crime, and even death.  And Selden is only one  out of thousands who live to-day, watching for  their  opportunities, giving no heed to those who may fall under the   juggernaut of their capital. This isn't the age of petty   discrimination, Greggy. It's the age of the almighty dollar, and  of  the fight for it. And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in  this  fight. Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and  children. The  scrubwoman's dollar is just as big as yours or mine,  and if a scheme  could be promoted whereby every scrubwoman in  America could be safely  robbed of a dollar you'd find thousands of  men down there in our  cities ready to go into it to-morrow. And to  such men as these what is  the sacrifice of a few women up here?&quot; 
  Gregson dropped the letter, crumpled and twisted, upon the table. 
  &quot;I wonder&#8212;if I understand,&quot; he said, looking into Philip's white   face. &quot;There has undoubtedly been previous correspondence, and  this  letter contains the final word. It shows that your enemies  have  already succeeded in working up the forest people against  you, and  have filled them with suspicion. Their last blow is to  be&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his   eyes. 
  &quot;Greggy, up here there is one law which reigns above all other   law. When I was in Prince Albert a year ago I was sitting on the   veranda of the little old Windsor Hotel. About me were a dozen  wild  men of the north, who had come down for a day or two to the  edge of  civilization. Most of those men had not been out of the  forests for a  year. Two of them were from the Barrens, and this  was their first  glimpse of civilized life in five years. As we sat  there a woman came  up the street. She turned in at the hotel.  About me there was a sudden  lowering of voices, a shuffling of  feet. As she passed, every one of  those twelve rose from their  seats and stood with bowed heads and  their caps in their hands  until she had gone. I was the only one who  remained sitting! That,  Greggy, is the one great law of life up here,  the worship of woman  because she is woman. A man may steal, he may  kill, but he must  not break this law. If he steals or kills, the  mounted police may  bring the offender to justice; but if he breaks  this other law  there is but one punishment, and that is the punishment  of the  people. That is what this letter purposes to do&#8212;to break this  law  in order that its penalty may fall upon us. And if they succeed,   God help us!&quot; 
  It was Gregson who jumped to his feet now. He took half a dozen   nervous steps, paused, lighted a cigarette, and looked down into   Philip's upturned face. 
  &quot;I understand now where the fight is coming in,&quot; he said. &quot;If this   thing goes through, these people will rise and wipe you off the  map.  They'll lay it to you and your men, of course. And I fancy it  won't be  a job half done if they feel about it as I'd feel. But,&quot;  he demanded,  sharply, &quot;why don't you put the affair into the hands  of the proper  authorities&#8212;the police or the government? You've  got&#8212;By George, you  must have the name of the man to whom that  letter was addressed!&quot; 
  Philip handed him a soiled white envelope, of the kind in which   official documents are usually mailed. 
  &quot;That's the man.&quot; 
  Gregson gave a low whistle. 
  &quot;Lord&#8212;Fitzhugh&#8212;Lee!&quot; he read, slowly, as though scarce believing   his eyes. &quot;Great Scott! A British peer!&quot; 
  The cynical smile on Philip's lips cut his words short. 
  &quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said. &quot;But if there is a British lord up here he   isn't very well known, Greggy. No one knows of him. No one has  heard  a rumor of him. That is why we can't go to the police or the   government. They'd give small credence to what we've got to show.   This letter wouldn't count the weight of a feather without further   evidence, and a lot of it. Besides, we haven't time to go to the   government. It is too far away and too slow. And as for the  police&#8212;I  know of three in this territory, and there are fifteen  thousand square  miles of mountains and plains and forest in their  'beat.' It's up to  you and me to find this Lord Fitzhugh. If we  can do that we will be in  a position to put a kibosh on this plot  in a hurry. If we fail to run  him down&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What then?&quot; 
  &quot;We'll have to watch our chances. I've told you all that I know,   and you're on an even working basis with me. At first I thought  that  I understood the object of those who are planning to ruin us  in this  cowardly manner. But I don't now. If they ruin us they  also destroy  the chances of any other company that may be scheming  to usurp our  place. For that reason I&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;There must still be other factors in the game,&quot; said Gregson, as   Philip hesitated. 
  &quot;There are. I want you to work out your own suspicions, Greggy,   and then we'll compare notes. Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the  whole  situation. No matter who is at the bottom of this plot, Lord  Fitzhugh  is the man at the working end of it. We don't care so  much about the  writer of this letter as the one to whom it was  written. It is evident  that he had planned to be at Churchill, for  the letter is addressed to  him here. But he hasn't shown up. He  has never been here, so far as I  can discover.&quot; 
  &quot;I'd give a year's growth for a copy of the BRITISH PEERAGE or a   WHO'S WHO,&quot; mused Gregson, flecking the ashes from his cigarette.   &quot;Who the deuce can this Lord Fitzhugh be? What sort of an  Englishman  would mix up in a dirty job of this kind? You might  imagine him to be  one of the men behind the guns, like Brokaw.  But, by George, he's  working the dirty end of it himself,  according to that letter!&quot; 
  &quot;You're beginning to use your head already, Greggy,&quot; said Philip,   a little more cheerfully. &quot;I've asked myself that question a  hundred  times during the last three days, and I'm more at sea than  ever. If it  had been plain Tom Brown or Bill Jones, the name would  not have  suggested anything beyond what you have read in the  letter. That's the  question: Why should a Lord Fitzhugh Lee be  mixed up in this affair?&quot; 
  The two men looked at each other keenly for a few moments in   silence. 
  &quot;It suggests&#8212;&quot; began Gregson. 
  &quot;What?&quot; 
  &quot;That there may be a bigger scheme behind this affair than we   imagine. In fact, it suggests to me that the northerners are being   stirred up against you and your men for some other and more  powerful  reason than to make you get out of the country and compel  the  government to withdraw your license. So help me God, I believe  there's  more behind it!&quot; 
  &quot;So do I,&quot; said Philip, quietly. 
  &quot;Have you any suspicions of what might be the more powerful   motive?&quot; 
  &quot;None. I know that British capital is heavily interested in   mineral lands east of the surveyed line. But there is none at   Churchill. All operations have been carried on from Montreal and   Toronto.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you written to Brokaw about this letter?&quot; 
  &quot;You are the first to whom I have revealed its contents,&quot; said   Philip. &quot;I have neglected to tell you that Brokaw is so worked up   over the affair that he is joining me in the north. The Hudson's  Bay  Company's ship, which comes over twice a year, touches at  Halifax, and  if Brokaw followed out his intentions he took passage  there. The ship  should be in within a week or ten days. And, by  the way&quot;&#8212;Philip stood  up and thrust his hands deep in his pockets  as he spoke, half smiling  at Gregson&#8212;&quot;it gives me pleasure to  hand you a bit of cheerful  information along with that,&quot; he added.  &quot;Miss Brokaw is coming with  him. She is very beautiful.&quot; 
  Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his finger-tips. 
  &quot;The deuce you say! I've heard&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, you have heard of her beauty, no doubt. I am not a special   enthusiast in your line, Greggy, but I will confirm your opinion  of  Miss Brokaw. You will say that she is the most beautiful girl  you have  ever seen, and you will want to make heads of her for  BURKE'S. I  suppose you wonder why she is coming up here? So do I.&quot; 
  There was a look of perplexity in Philip's eyes which Gregson   might have noticed if he had not gone to the door to look out into   the night. 
  &quot;What makes the stars so big and bright up in this country, Phil?&quot;   he asked. 
  &quot;Because of the clearness of the atmosphere through which you are   looking,&quot; replied Philip, wondering what was passing through the   other's mind. &quot;This air&#8212;compared with ours&#8212;is just like a piece  of  glass that has been cleaned of a year's accumulation of dirt.&quot; 
  Gregson whistled softly for a few moments. Then he said, without   turning: 
  &quot;She's got to go some if she beats the girl I saw this evening,   Phil.&quot; He turned at Philip's silence, and laughed. &quot;I beg your   pardon, old man, I didn't mean to speak of her as if she were a   horse. I mean Miss Brokaw.&quot; 
  &quot;And I don't particularly like the idea of betting on the merits   of a pretty girl,&quot; replied Philip, &quot;but I'll break the rule for  once,  and wager you the best hat in New York that she does beat  her.&quot; 
  &quot;Done!&quot; said Gregson. &quot;A little gentle excitement of this sort   will relieve the tension of the other thing, Phil. I've heard  enough  of business for to-night. I'm going to finish a sketch that  I have  begun of her before I forget the fine points. Any  objection?&quot; 
  &quot;None at all,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a   spell.&quot; 
  He put on his coat and took down his cap from a peg in the wall.   Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a   pencil. As Philip went to go out Gregson drew an envelope from his   pocket and tossed it on the table. 
  &quot;If you should happen to see any one that looks like&#8212;her,&quot; he   said, nodding toward the envelope, &quot;kindly put in a word for me,  will  you? I did that in a hurry. It's not half flattering.&quot; 
  Philip laughed as he picked up the envelope. 
  &quot;The most beau&#8212;&quot; he began. 
  He caught himself with a jerk. Gregson, looking up from his   pencil-sharpening, saw the smile leave his lips and a quick flush   leap into his bronzed cheeks. He stared at the face on the  envelope  for a half a minute, then gazed speechlessly at Gregson. 
  It was Gregson who laughed, softly and without suspicion. 
  &quot;How does your wager look now?&quot; he taunted. 
  &quot;She&#8212;is&#8212;beautiful,&quot; murmured Philip, dropping the envelope and   turning to the door, &quot;Don't wait for me, Greggy. Go to bed.&quot; 
  He heard Gregson laugh behind him, and he wondered, as he went   out, what Gregson would say if he told him that he had drawn on  the  back of the old envelope the beautiful face of Eileen Brokaw!
