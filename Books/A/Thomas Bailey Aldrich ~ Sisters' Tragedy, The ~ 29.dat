I beg you come to-night and dine.<br> A welcome waits you, and sound wine--<br> The Roederer chilly to a charm,<br> As Juno's breath the claret warm,<br> The sherry of an ancient brand.<br> No Persian pomp, you understand--<br> A soup, a fish, two meats, and then<br> A salad fit for aldermen<br> (When aldermen, alas, the days!<br> Were really worth their mayonnaise);<br> A dish of grapes whose clusters won<br> Their bronze in Carolinian sun;<br> Next, cheese--for you the Neufchatel,<br> A bit of Cheshire likes me well;<br> Cafe au lait or coffee black,<br> With Kirsch or Kummel or Cognac<br> (The German band in Irving Place<br> By this time purple in the face);<br> Cigars and pipes. These being through,<br> Friends shall drop in, a very few--<br> Shakespeare and Milton, and no more.<br> When these are guests I bolt the door,<br> With Not at Home to any one<br> Excepting Alfred Tennyson.
