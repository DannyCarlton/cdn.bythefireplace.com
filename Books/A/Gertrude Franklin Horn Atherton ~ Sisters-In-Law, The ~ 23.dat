Gora, to whom she had telephoned before leaving home, was standing on  the steps of her house, looking anxiously up the street, as her young  sister-in-law left the car at the corner.    
Gora walked up to meet her guest. "Where on earth have you, been?" she  demanded. "I supposed of course that you'd take a taxi. You should not go  out alone at night. Mortimer would be wild. He has the strictest ideas; and  you--"    
"Haven't. Not, any more. I'm tired of being kept in a glass case--being  a parasite." She laughed gayly at Gora's look of amazement. "I've had an  adventure. Almost the first I ever had."    
She related it as they walked slowly down the street and up the steps and  stairs to the attic.    
Gora looked very thoughtful as she listened. "Shall you tell Mortimer?"    
"Oh, I don't know. Possibly not. Why agitate him? The thing is done."    
"But if you study with this man?"    
"There is no necessity to explain where I met him. I look upon myself as  Morty's partner, not as his subject. We have never disputed over anything  yet, but of course as time goes on I shall wish to do many things whether  he happens to like it or not. Possibly without consulting him."    
"You've had time to think these past three months for the first time in  your life," said Gora shrewdly. "Here we are. I hope you don't hate stairs.  I do when I come home dog-tired, but somehow I can't give up the old  place....And I've lit the candles in your honor."    
<b>II</b>    
"Oh, but it is pretty! Charming!"    
Thought Gora: "I do hope she's not going to be gracious. I've never liked  her so well before."    
But Alexina was too excited to have a firm grip on the Ballinger-Groome  tradition. She had had an adventure, an uncommon one, in a far from  respectable night district; she had done something that would cause the  impeccable Mortimer the acutest anguish if he knew of it; and she had  caught sight immediately of Gathbroke's picture framed and enthroned on the  mantelpiece.    
She walked about the room admiring the hangings and prints, the old Chinese  lanterns that held the candles.    
"I am going to refurnish our lower rooms," she said. "If you have time do  help me. Heavens! I wish I could work off some of that old furniture on  you. I like the Italian pieces well enough, but there are too many of them.  That rather low Florentine cabinet in the back parlor would just fit in  this corner...."    
She gave a little girlish exclamation and ran forward.    
"Isn't that young Gathbroke, who was out here at the time of the earthquake  and fire...or an older brother, perhaps?"    
She had taken the photograph from the mantel and was examining it under one  of the lanterns. Her alert ear detected the deeper and less steady note in  Gora's always hoarse voice.    
"It is the same. Did you meet him?...Oh, I remember he told me he met you  at the Hofer ball. He rather raved over you, in fact."    
"Did he? How sweet of him. I met him again, I remember. Mr. Gwynne brought  him down to Rincona one day."    
"Oh?"    
And Alexina, knew that he had never mentioned that visit.    
"But he looks much much older."    
"He did before he left. That horrible experience of his seemed to prey on  him more and more.    
"Oh."    
He had not looked a day over twenty-three on that afternoon at Eincona, two  weeks after the fire.    
Alexina replaced the picture, then turned to her sister-in-law with a  coaxing smile. "Are you engaged? It would be too romantic. Do tell me."    
"No," said Gora, shortly. "We are not engaged. Good friends, that is all,  and write occasionally."    
"Well, he must be very much interested--and you must be a very interesting  correspondent, Gora dear! Is he? Interesting, I mean. What does he do,  anyhow? I have a vague remembrance that he said something about the army."    
"He was in the army, the Grenadier Guards. But he has resigned and gone  into business with a cousin of his in Lancashire. He wrote me--oh, it must  be nearly two years ago--that if there should be a war he would enlist as a  matter of course, but as there was no prospect of any, and he was sick  of idleness--his good middle-class energetic blood asserting itself, he  said,--he was going to amuse himself with work, incidentally try to make  a fortune. His mother left a good deal of money, but there are several  children and I guess the present earl needs most of it to keep up his  estates, to say nothing of his position. Fotten law, that--entail, I mean."    
Alexina came and sat down on the divan beside Gora, piling the cushions  behind her. "Are you a socialist?"    
"I am not. I believe in sticking to your own class, whether you have a  grudge against it or not, or even if you think it far from perfection."    
She shot a quick challenging glance at her admittedly aristocratic  sister-in-law, but Alexina had lifted the lower white of her eyes just  above their soft black fringe and looked more innocent than any new born  lamb. As she did not answer Gora continued:    
"I remember that night I sat out with Gathbroke on Calvary he said  something about socialism...that it was a confession of failure. I may feel  so furious with destiny sometimes that I could go out and wave a red flag,  or even the darker red of anarchy, but what always sobers me is the thought  that if I had the good luck to inherit or make even a reasonable fortune  I'd have no more use for socialism than for a rattlesnake in my bed. Why  are you interested?"    
"Only as in any subject that interests a few million people. I haven't the  least intention of being converted, but I don't want to be an ignoramus.  Aileen and Sibyl and I did start Marx's <i>Das Kapital</i>--in German! We nearly  died of it. But I felt sure that this man, Kirkpatrick, had studied his  subject, if only because his language changed so completely when he talked  about it. It was as if he were quoting, but intelligently. Of course the  poor man had little or no education to begin with. Somehow he struck me as  a pathetic figure. Perhaps when every one is educated--and there must be  many thousands of naturally intelligent men in the working class whose  brains if trained would be mighty useful in Washington--well, all having  had equal opportunities they would surely arrive at some way to improve  conditions without struggling for anything so hopeless as socialism. I  know enough to be sure that it is hopeless, because it antagonizes human  nature."    
"Rather. The trend under all the talk is more and more toward  individualism, not self-effacing communism. As for myself I like the idea  of the fight--for public recognition, I mean; and I don't think I'd be  happy at all if things were made too smooth for me; if, for instance, in  a socialized state it were decided that I could devote all my time to  writing, and that the state would take care of me, publish my work, and  distribute it exactly where it was sure to be appreciated. I haven't any  of the old California gambling blood in me, but I guess the hardy ghost of  those old days still dominates the atmosphere, and I have not been one of  those to escape."    
"It's in mine! Not that I care for gambling, really, like Aileen and Alice.  But I've always been fascinated by the idea of taking long chances, and I  have had inklings that I'll be rather more than less fascinated as I grow  older....When are your stories to be published? I am simply expiring to  read them."    
"Are you?"    
<b>III</b>    
Alexina had thrust her slim index finger unerringly through Gora's  bristling armor and tickled her weakest spot. The fledgling author smiled  into the dazzling eyes opposite and a deep flush rose to her high cheek  bones,    
"Rather!"    
"Then..." Gora rose and took a magazine from the table beside her bed. She  spread it open on her lap, when she had resumed her seat, and handled it as  Alexina had seen young mothers fondle their first-born.    
"It's here. Just out."    
"Oh!" Alexina. gave a little shriek of genuine anticipation. "Read it to  me. Quick. I can't wait."    
Gora led a lonely life outside of her work, a lonely inner life always. She  had never had an intimate friend, and she suddenly reflected that there had  been a certain measure of sadness in her joy both when her manuscripts were  accepted and to-day when for the first time she had gazed at herself in  print....She had had no one to rejoice with her....She felt an overwhelming  sense of gratitude to Alexina.    
But she gave this young wife of her brother whom she knew as little as  Alexina knew her, another swift suspicious glance....No, there was nothing  of Alexina's usual high and careless courtesy in that eager almost excited  face.    
"I'd love to have your opinion....I read very badly....Make allowances...."    
"Oh, fire away. If I'd written a story and had it accepted by that magazine  I'd read it from the housetops."    
Gora read the story well enough, and Alexina's mind did not wander even to  Gathbroke. It was written in a pure direct vigorous English. A little less  self-consciousness and it would have been distinguished. The story itself  was built craftily; she had been coached by a clever instructor who was a  successful writer of short stories himself; and it worked up to a climax of  genuine drama. But this was merely the framework, the flexible technique  for the real Gora. The story had not only an original point of view but it  pulsed with the insurgent resentful passionate spirit of the writer.    
Alexina gave a little gasp as Gora finished.    
"Many people won't like that story," she said. "It shocks and jars and  gives one's smugness a pain in the middle. But those that do like it  will give you a great reputation, and after all there are a few thousand  intelligent readers in the United States. How on earth did that magazine  come to accept it?"    
Gora was staring at Alexina with an uncommonly soft expression in her  opaque light eyes. She felt, indeed, as if her ego would leap through them  and make a fool of her.    
"The editor wrote me something of what you have just said. He wanted  something new--to give his conservative old subscribers a shock. Thought  it would be good for them and for the magazine. You--you--have said what I  should have wanted you to say if I could have thought it out....I think I  should have hated you if you had said, 'How charming!' or 'How frantically  interesting!'"    
"Well, it's the last if not the first. Aileen will say that and mean it.  I'll telephone to the bookstore the first thing Monday morning and get a  copy. Now I must go. It's late."    
<b>IV</b>    
"Let me telephone for a taxi."    
Alexina laughed merrily. "You'll never believe it, but I've just thirty  cents in my purse. I forgot to ask Morty for something before he  left....You see, I happened to find quite a bit in mother's desk and so  I've never thought to ask him for an allowance. But I shall at once."    
"An allowance? But you have your own money? Or is it because the estate  isn't settled? What has Morty to do with that?"    
"I believe we get the income from the estate until it is settled. But I  gave my power of attorney to Morty."    
"Oh! But if there is money on deposit in the bank you can draw on it."    
"Could I? Well! I'll just draw a round hundred on Monday at ten A.M."    
"Why did you give your power of attorney to Morty?"    
"Oh...why...he asked me to...I know nothing about business, and he  naturally would attend to my affairs."    
"But you are not going away. No one needs your power of attorney. And the  executors are Judge Lawton and Mr. Abbott. You are here to sign such papers  as they advise....Don't he angry, please. I am not insinuating anything  against Morty. He's never bad a dishonest thought in his life...has always  been, the squarest...but..."    
"Well?"    
Alexina's head was very high. It was quite bad enough for Tom Abbott and  Judge Lawton...but for his sister...    
"It's this way, Alexina. People in this world, more particularly men, are  just about as honest as circumstances will permit them to be. Some are  stronger than Life in one way or another, no doubt of it; but they make up  for it by being weaker in others....I am talking particularly of the money  question, the struggle for existence, which the vast majority of men are  forced to make....    
"Men fight Life from the hour they leave their homes, when they have any,  to force success--in one way or another--out of her until the hour they are  able to lay down the burden....Some are too strong and too firm in their  ideals ever to do wrong; they would prefer failure, and generally they are  strong enough to avoid it, even to succeed in their way against the  most overwhelming odds....Many are too clever not to find some way of  compromising and circumventing....Others just peg along and barely make  both ends meet....Others go under and down and out.    
"Morty, like millions of other young Americans, had good principles and  high ideals inculcated from his earliest boyhood and took to them as a duck  takes to water. Nor is he weak. But although he is a hard and steady worker  he is also visionary. He speculated on the stock market before he was  married. Probably not now as the market is moribund. He is frantic to get  rich...for more reasons than one."    
"But he never would do anything dishonorable."    
"No. Nothing he couldn't square with his conscience if it turned out all  right. But the most honest man, when in a hole, finds little difficulty in  arriving at the conclusion that what is, illogically, the possession of the  women of his family, is his if he needs it.    
"Moreover, no doubt you have discovered that Morty is the sort of man who  looks upon women as man's natural inferiors, that if there is any question  of sacrifice the woman is not to be considered for a moment...especially  where no public risk is involved. That sort of man only thinks he is too  honest to refrain from taking some unrelated woman's money, but as a matter  of fact it is because she would send him to State's Prison as readily as a  man would. One's own women are safe.    
"I lent Morty my small inheritance with my eyes open. But he knows a good  deal of that particular business, and I did not dream the times were going  to be so bad....I doubt if I ever see it again....But you must not run the  risk of losing yours. I want you to promise me that on Monday morning you  will go down to the City Hall and revoke your power of attorney. And as  much for Morty's sake as for your own. He will lose your money if he keeps  it in his hands, and then he will suffer agonies of remorse. He will be  infinitely more miserable than if he merely failed in business. That is  honorable. It would only hurt his pride. Then he could get a position  again, and you would have your own income."    
"But do you mean to say that if I did revoke my power of attorney and he  asked me later for money to save his business that I should not give it to  him?"    
"Yes, I mean just that. Morty will never take any of the prizes in the  business world. He may hold on and make a living, that is all. He has  plenty to start with, and tells me he is doing fairly well, in spite of the  times. But he would do better in the long run as a clerk. In time he  might get a large salary as a sort of general director of all the routine  business of some large house--"    
Alexina curled her lip. "I do not want him to be a clerk."    
"No, of course you don't! But you'd like it still less if he cleaned you  out. You--would have to sell or rent your old home and live on a hundred  and fifty dollars a month in a flat in some out-of-the-way quarter. You  might have to go to work yourself,"    
"I shouldn't mind that so much, except that I'm afraid I'd not be good for  much. Perhaps it was snobbish of me to object lo Morty's being a clerk.  But...well, I'm not so sure that it is snobbish to prefer what you have  always been accustomed to--I mean if it is a higher standard. And after all  I married him when he was only a clerk."    
"You are surprisingly little of a snob, all things considered; but you are  a hopeless aristocrat."    
"What do you mean by that?"    
"I think the line between the aristocratic and the snobbish attitude of  mind is almost too fine to be put into words. But they are often confused  by the undiscriminating. Will you revoke that power of attorney on Monday?"    
"Shouldn't I wait until Morty is home?...tell him first? It seems rather  taking an advantage...and he will be very angry."    
"That doesn't matter."    
"What excuse shall I give him?"    
"Any one of a dozen. You are bored and want to take care of your  money...intend to learn something of business, as all women should,  and will in time....Ring in the feminist stuff...wife's economic  independence...woman's new position in the world....That will make Morty so  raving angry that he will forget about the other. Will you do it?"    
"Yes, I will. I believe you are right. So were the others...there must be  something in it."    
She told Gora of the advice of Tom Abbott and Judge Lawton. Gora nodded.    
"They meant more than they said. And merely because they are men of the  world, not because they like and trust Morty any the less."    
Alexina did not hear her. She was staring hard at the floor....A year  ago...three months ago...she couldn't have done this thing. She had been  still under the illusion that she loved her husband, that her marriage was  a complete success. She would have sacrificed her last penny rather than  hurt his feelings. Now she only cared that she didn't care....She had  admitted to herself that she did not love her husband but that was  different from committing an overt act that proved it....She felt something  crumbling within her....It was the last of the fairy edifice of her  romance...of her first, her real, youth....What was to take its place?  The future smugly secure on six thousand a year and an inviolate social  position...a good dull husband...not even the prospect of travel....    
<b>V</b>    
She sprang to her feet and turned away her head.    
"Why don't you come and live with us?" she asked abruptly. "Why should you  keep this on? There are so many vacant bedrooms up there. You could have  one for your study. I'd love to have you. You'd have the most complete  independence. Do."    
Gora shook her head. "I've always this to fall back on."    
"Fall back on?"    
"Oh! I never meant to let that out. However....Perhaps it is as  well....Morty--you know his pride--everybody has his prime weakness and  that is his. Transpose it into snobbery if you like....We did not board  down here. I kept a lodging house for business women. It paid well, but  Morty, when he became engaged to you, insisted that I give it up. He was  afraid you'd be outraged in your finest sensibilities! Well, I did. One of  my lodgers resigned from her job and took it over. I entered the hospital,  but kept on my room as I had to have one somewhere. Eight months later she  married, and I took it back. I found I could run it as well as ever with  the aid of a treasure of a Chinaman she had discovered. But I never told  Morty."    
Alexina laughed. "Better not. But you could run it and live with us all the  same."    
"No. I have too little time. I'd waste it coming back and forth, for I must  be here some time every day....Besides..."    
"Your own precious atmosphere?"    
"You do understand!"    
"Well, come to see me often. I shall need your advice."    
"You bet. And now, I'll see you to your car; stay with you until you are  safely transferred to the Fillmore car. And don't assert your independence  in just this way again. All those loafers on Fillmore Street are not  spiteful socialists."    
As Gora put on her hat at the distant mirror Alexina turned to Gathbroke's  picture with a scowl. She even clenched her hands into fists.    
"Oh...you...you....Why weren't you....Why didn't you...."
