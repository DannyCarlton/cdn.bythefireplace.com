In the eighteenth century Nevis was known as The Mother of the English  Leeward Caribbees. A Captain-General ruled the group in the name of the  King, but if he died suddenly, his itinerant duties devolved upon the  Governor of Nevis until the crown heard of its loss and made choice of  another to fill that high and valued office. She had a Council and a  House of Assembly, modelled in miniature upon the Houses of Peers and  Commons; and was further distinguished as possessing the only court in  the English Antilles where pirates could be tried. The Council was made  up of ten members appointed by the Captain-General, but commanded by  "its own particular and private Governor." The freeholders of the Island  chose twenty-four of their number to represent them in the House of  Assembly; and the few chronicles of that day agree in asserting that  Nevis during her hundred proud years of supremacy was governed  brilliantly and well. But the careful administration of good laws  contributed in part only to the celebrity of an Island which to-day,  still British as she is, serves but as a pedestal for the greatest of  American statesmen. In these old days she was a queen as well as a  mother. Her planters were men of immense wealth and lived the life of  grandees. Their cane-fields covered the mountain on all its sides and  subsidiary peaks, rising to the very fringe of the cold forest on the  cone of a volcano long since extinct. The "Great Houses," built  invariably upon an eminence that commanded a view of the neighbouring  islands.--St. Christopher, Antigua, Montserrat,--were built of blocks  of stone so square and solid and with a masonry so perfect that one  views their ruins in amazement to-day. They withstood hurricanes,  earthquakes, floods, and tidal waves. They were impregnable fortresses  against rioting negroes and spasmodically aggressive Frenchmen. They  even survived the abolition of slavery, and the old gay life went on for  many years. English people, bored or in search of health, came for the  brilliant winter, delighted with the hospitality of the planters, and to  renew their vitality in the famous climate and sulphur baths, which, of  all her possessions, Time has spared to Nevis. And then, having  weathered all the ills to which even a West Indian Island can be  subject, she succumbed--to the price of sugar. Her great families  drifted away one by one. Her estates were given over to the agent for a  time, finally to the mongoose. The magnificent stone mansions, left  without even a caretaker, yielded helplessly to the diseases of age, and  the first hurricane entering unbarred windows carried their roofs to the  sea. In Charles Town, the capital since the submergence of James Town in  1680, are the remains of large town houses and fine old stone walls,  which one can hardly see from the roadstead, so thick are the royal  palms and the cocoanut trees among the ruins, wriggling their slender  bodies through every crevice and flaunting their glittering luxuriance  above every broken wall.    
But in the days when the maternal grandparents of Alexander Hamilton  looked down a trifle upon those who dwelt on other isles, Nevis recked  of future insignificance as little as a beauty dreams of age. In the  previous century England, after the mortification of the Royalists by  Cromwell, had sent to Nevis Hamiltons, Herberts, Russells, and many  another refugee from her historic houses. With what money they took  with them they founded the great estates of the eighteenth century, and  their sons sent their own children to Europe to become accomplished men  and women. Government House was a miniature court, as gay and splendid  as its offices were busy with the commerce of the world. The Governor  and his lady drove about the Island in a carriage of state, with  outriders and postilions in livery. When the Captain-General came he  outshone his proud second by the gorgeousness of his uniform only, and  both dignitaries were little more imposing than the planters themselves.  It is true that the men, despite their fine clothes and powdered  perukes, preferred a horse's back to the motion of a lumbering coach,  but during the winter season their wives and daughters, in the shining  stuffs, the pointed bodices, the elaborate head-dress of Europe, visited  Government House and their neighbours with all the formality of London  or Bath. After the first of March the planters wore white linen; the  turbaned black women were busy among the stones of the rivers with  voluminous wardrobes of cambric and lawn.    
Several estates belonged to certain offshoots of the ducal house of  Hamilton, and in the second decade of the eighteenth century Walter  Hamilton was Captain-General of the English Leeward Caribbees and  "Ordinary of the Same." After him came Archibald Hamilton, who was,  perhaps, of all the Hamiltons the most royal in his hospitality.  Moreover, he was a person of energy and ambition, for it is on record  that he paid a visit to Boston, fleeing from the great drought which  visited Nevis in 1737. Then there were William Leslie Hamilton, who  practised at the bar in London for several years, but returned to hold  official position on Nevis, and his brother Andrew, both sons of Dr.  William Hamilton, who spent the greater part of his life on St.  Christopher. There were also Hugh Hamilton, Charles, Gustavus, and  William Vaughn Hamilton, all planters, most of them Members of Council  or of the Assembly.    
And even in those remote and isolated days, Hamiltons and Washingtons  were associated. The most popular name in our annals appears frequently  in the Common Records of Nevis, and there is no doubt that when our  first President's American ancestor fled before Cromwell to Virginia, a  brother took ship for the English Caribbees.    
From a distance Nevis looks like a solitary peak in mid-ocean, her base  sweeping out on either side. But behind the great central cone--rising  three thousand two hundred feet--are five or six lesser peaks, between  which are dense tropical gorges and mountain streams. In the old days,  where the slopes were not vivid with the light green of the cane-field,  there were the cool and sombre groves of the cocoanut tree, mango,  orange, and guava.    
Even when Nevis is wholly visible there is always a white cloud above  her head. As night falls it becomes evident that this soft aggravation  of her beauty is but a night robe hung on high. It is at about seven in  the evening that she begins to draw down her garment of mist, but she is  long in perfecting that nocturnal toilette. Lonely and neglected, she  still is a beauty, exacting and fastidious. The cloud is tortured into  many shapes before it meets her taste. She snatches it off, redisposes  it, dons and takes it off again, wraps it about her with yet more  enchanting folds, until by nine o'clock it sweeps the sea; and Nevis,  the proudest island of the Caribbees, has secluded herself from those  cynical old neighbours who no longer bend the knee.
