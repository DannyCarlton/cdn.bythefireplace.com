John and Julie in the smoking-room were not lonely. They talked of many  of the events he had suggested, and of more. Two of the windows looked  out upon the town instead of the river, but they could see little there  save the towering spire of the cathedral and the blank and ruined walls.  The snow was already very deep, but the fall was not diminishing. The  gray gloom of coming twilight, however, was beginning to show through it  and once more John returned silent thanks that he had come into Chastel  and found Julie. He was serving vicariously for Philip who undoubtedly  had been held back by the snow.    
"It will be night soon," he said. "It's likely that the snow will cease  in the morning, and then I'm quite sure that Philip will come for you.  It must have been his intention for you to help at the hospital camp  below."    
"I think so, too."    
"Then why not go there in the morning?"    
"And he would miss me. He would be searching all Chastel for me, and  perhaps would then go away, believing that I had not come."    
He was about to say that Philip, missing her in the town would be sure  to look for her in the hospital camp, but he forebore. It was very  pleasant for them there in the hotel, and why hurry?    
"At any rate, it would be unwise to leave tonight," he said. "I think  Suzanne herself will agree with me in that statement. I'll ask her, as  she'll be in here very soon now."    
"Why so soon?"    
"Because I've noticed that Suzanne, besides being your maid is also your  chaperon."    
"She's been that as far back as I can remember, and I believe a most  excellent one. Suzanne, I know, loves me."    
"I'm sure of it. I don't blame her."    
"Look how the snow is leaping up against the window, Mr. John! Ah,  Suzanne is ahead of your prediction! She's coming now."    
Suzanne stood in the doorway. John surmised from her look that her  distrust, at least in a mild form, had sent her there.    
"Now that your maid can be with you," he said, "I think I'll take  another look at the front of the hotel. Possibly, a new guest has  arrived and registered since we last saw the bureau. Will you excuse me  for a few minutes, Miss Julie?"    
John was merely impelled by a sense of duty to take a look about the  hotel, not that he expected to find anything, but because a good soldier  should never neglect his scouting operations. He went first into the  little lobby at the entrance, where the offices were. Antoine had  lighted a candle and left it on the desk of the bureau. Otherwise he  could have seen little in the room as the twilight was advancing fast,  and the white gloom, made by the falling snow, was shading into gray.    
He opened the front door. There was nothing in the street. The tower of  the cathedral was almost hidden by the storm and the twilight and the  gaunt ruins of the houses, covered now with snow, looked inexpressibly  dreary and lonely. The dismal spectacle without heightened the bright  gladness within, where he and Julie had sat face to face, only a narrow  table between, and Antoine and Suzanne had served.    
He stood awhile in the open door, the snow whirling now and then against  him, and the faint mutter of great guns coming at almost regular  intervals to his ears. He was trying to decide what to do, free from any  influence, however noble, which might unconsciously turn him from his  duty. His was in the nature of a roving commission, and yet he must not  rove too far. He decided that if Lannes did not come in the morning he  would insist upon Julie going with him to the hospital camp. It would be  hard for him to go against her wishes, but he was bound to do it, and  easy in little things, young John Scott had a will in greater affairs  that could not be overborne.    
But his heart remained singularly light. This was a good hotel, the  Hotel de l'Europe. He had not found a finer or better in Europe. Others  might be larger and more magnificent, but not one of them had offered  him such light and hospitality at a time when they were needed most. He  went back to the bureau, where the register still lay open. He had a  vague impression that it was not lying just as they had left it, that it  was turned much more to one side, and he glanced at the names, which a  quaint fancy had made them write on the open page. His own name had been  inscribed there last, and he started when he saw another written beneath  it in a bold flowing hand. But the light was so dim that he could not at  first make it out, and despite all his courage and power of will an  uncanny feeling seized him. A chill ran along his spine, and his hair  lifted a little.    
With a cry of anger at himself, he seized the candle and held it over  the page. Then he read the new name:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> <i>Fernand Weber, Paris and Alsace.</i></small></i></blockquote><br>
With another exclamation, but this time of relief, he put the candle  back upon the desk. Two beads of perspiration that had formed upon his  brow rolled from it, and fell upon the register. And Weber had come,  too! He was not surprised at it. Since he was Lannes' messenger, and he  was free to come and go as he pleased, it was altogether likely that he  would appear in Chastel to see the reunion of brother and sister, and  his work well done. Moreover, he was a man who knew. John had often  noticed that Weber's characteristic was knowledge and now he would help  them.    
He lifted the candle high above his head and looked around the lobby,  but there was no sign of the Alsatian. He must have gone outside again.  Saying nothing to Julie or the Picards, John resolved to seek him. He  needed his heavy overcoat and he was able to secure it unobserved,  because Julie had gone up to her room, and Antoine and Suzanne had  disappeared in the back regions of the hotel.    
He had a faint hope that when he returned to the lobby he might find  Weber there, but it was still lone and silent, and drawing the collar  well about his ears and throat he thrust himself out into the snow.  Turning his back to the driving flakes he walked eastward, searching  everywhere through the advancing twilight. Weber, of course, knew of  their presence in the hotel as he had seen their names on the register,  and the lighted candle on the bureau. It must have been a sudden alarm  that called him away so quickly, else he would have gone in at once, and  have spoken to his friends.    
Unfortunately the night was coming fast. Thick gray gloom clothed the  whole east, and but little light showed in the west. Looking back he saw  no light in the hotel, but that was to be expected, as Picard would  certainly loop the curtains heavily over the windows. Out here in the  ruined town much of his extraordinary buoyancy departed. The cold and  the desolation of the world made him shiver a little. He thrust his hand  into the pocket of his overcoat, and closed it upon the butt of the  automatic.    
He thought once of calling at the top of his voice for Weber, but  instinctive caution kept him from doing so. Then he caught sight of a  slender moving figure far ahead and feeling sure that it must be the  Alsatian he hurried forward. The figure moved on as fast as he, but,  eager in pursuit, he followed. It was shadowy and slim at the distance,  but he knew that it was a human being, and either it was Weber or some  man of Chastel returning to see what had happened to his town. In either  event he wished to overtake him.    
But the figure led him a long chase. The man seemed to be moving with  some definite purpose, and kept a general course toward the east. Now  John called out once or twice, though not loudly, but the stranger  apparently did not hear him. Then he pushed the pursuit more vigorously,  breaking into a run, and just beyond the eastern rim of Chastel, feeling  sure now that it was the Alsatian, he called once more:    
"Weber! Weber!"    
The man paused and he seemed to John to look back, but the snow drifted  heavily between them just then, and when the cataract had passed he was  again moving on, more slender and dim than ever. Beyond him lay a little  wood, torn and mangled by shells and shrapnel, as the town had been, and  John, afraid that he would lose him in it, ran as fast as he could  through the deep snow, calling once more, and loudly now:    
"Weber! Weber! Weber!"    
The figure stopped at the edge of the wood and turned. John, holding up  his hands to show that he meant no harm, continued his panting rush  through the snow. The man stood upright, magnified into gigantic size by  the half light and the storm, and, as John came close, he saw that in  very truth it <i>was</i> Weber. His relief and joy were great. He did not  know until then how anxious he was that the stranger should prove to be  Weber, in whose skill and resource he had so much confidence.    
"Weber! Weber!" he cried again. "It's Scott. Don't you know me, or am I  so clothed in snow that nobody can recognize me?"    
"I recognize you now, Mr. Scott," said Weber, "and glad am I to see that  it's you. I was afraid that I was being followed by a German scout. I  could have disposed of him, but it would not have saved me from his  comrades."    
"Comrades!" exclaimed John, as he shook his hand. "Why, are Germans  about?"    
"I think they are. At least, I've come out here to see. You'll forgive  my jest, Mr. Scott, in writing my name under that of your party on the  register, won't you? As Mademoiselle Lannes has doubtless told you, I  carried the letter from her brother, directing her to join him in  Chastel, and, as my duties permitted, I came here also to see that my  work was effective. I'd have gone at once, but I heard suspicious sounds  in front of the hotel, and I came out at once to investigate."    
"What did you find?"    
"Near the cathedral I saw footprints which the falling snow had covered  but partially. No, it's not worth while to go back and investigate them.  They're under an inch of snow now."    
"Why did you think Germans had made them?"    
Weber opened his gloved hand and disclosed something metallic, a spike  from a German helmet.    
"This," he said, "had become loosened and it fell from the cap of some  careless fellow. It could have been there only a few minutes, because  the snow had not yet covered it. I think a considerable party has got  behind the French lines under cover of the storm and has passed through  Chastel."    
"But they must have gone on. Why would they remain in a ruined town like  this?"    
"I see no reason for their doing so, unless to seek shelter for a while  in some buildings not wholly wrecked, just as you and Mademoiselle  Lannes' party have done."    
John felt a throb of alarm.    
"Has the Hotel de l'Europe escaped their observation?" he asked.    
"I think so. I did not notice any light myself when I approached it. But  I had been in Chastel before, and of course knew of the house and its  location. I went there at once, hoping that it had escaped destruction,  and found my hopes justified. Has Mademoiselle Lannes heard anything  from her brother? I did not see his name on the register?"    
"He has not come, but the weather has made it impossible. Aeroplanes  can't dare such snowstorms as this."    
"That's true, but he's so wonderfully skillful and bold that he might  get here in some fashion. Now I think we ought to make a good search  among these ruins, Mr. Scott. It's more than likely that the Germans  have passed on, but there's a chance that they will linger. You're  armed, of course?"    
"I've an automatic handy."    
"So have I. Suppose we take a look in the wood here, and then we can  search among those houses on our right."    
The snow and the night, now at hand, biding them, they entered the  little wood with confidence that they would fall into no trap. But it  was empty, and returning to the edge of the town, they scouted  cautiously all the way around it, finding no sign of either a friend or  an enemy.    
"We alone hold Chastel," said John, "and I think we'd better go back to  the Hotel de l'Europe. I've been away a full two hours and Mademoiselle  Lannes may be worried about my long absence, not about me personally,  but because of what it might possibly signify."    
"That's our obvious course," said Weber, "and as I've registered I'll  sleep at the hotel also."    
"You'll certainly be welcome," said John, as he led the way back to the  Hotel de l'Europe. But as they were on the far side of the town, and the  snow had grown deeper, it took them another half-hour to reach the  building.    
They stood just inside the door, brushing off the snow and shaking  themselves. John glanced toward the door of the smoking-room but it was  dark there. He was somewhat surprised. Julie had doubtless gone to bed,  but Antoine, the grim and faithful, would be on watch.    
"I expected Picard to meet us," he said.    
"Probably they're all worn out, and anticipating no danger, have gone to  sleep," said Weber.    
The candle was still burning in the bureau, and John, picking it up,  hurried into the smoking-room. A sudden, terrible fear had struck like a  dagger at his heart. The silence, and the absence of Picard filled him  with alarm. In the smoking-room he held the candle aloft, and then he  uttered a cry.    
The room was in a state of utter disorder. Chairs, tables and  writing-desks were overturned, and glass was smashed. It was evident to  both that a mighty struggle had taken place there, but no blood was  shed. John's keen mind inferred at once that Picard had been set upon  without warning by many men, but they had struggled to take him alive.  Nothing else could account for the wrecked furniture, and the absence of  red stains.    
His fears now became a horrible certainty, and without a thought of  Weber, rushing up the stairway, candle in hand, he knocked at the door  of Julie's room, the room that she and Suzanne were to occupy together.  There was no answer. He knocked again, loud and long. Still no answer  and his heart froze within him. He threw the door open and rushed in,  mechanically holding his candle aloft, and, by the dim light it shed,  looked about him, aghast.    
This room also was in disorder. A chair had been overturned and a  mirror had been broken. There had been a struggle here too, and he had  no doubt that Suzanne had fought almost as well as her father. But she  and Julie were gone. To John the room fairly ached with emptiness.    
He put the candle upon the dresser, sat down, dropped his face in his  hands and groaned.    
"Be of good courage, Mr. Scott," said Weber. "No great harm can have  happened to Mademoiselle Lannes."    
"It was the Germans whom you saw. They must have come here while we were  looking for them on the outskirts of the town."    
"It would seem so. But don't be downhearted, Mr. Scott. Doubtless  they've made captives of Mademoiselle Lannes and her attendants, but  they have not done any bodily harm even to the big Picard. The absence  of all blood shows it. And the Germans would not injure a woman like  Mademoiselle Lannes. A prisoner, she is safe in their hands, she can be  rescued as she was once before or more likely be sent back to her own  people."    
"But, Weber, we do not know what will happen in a war like this, so  vast, so confused, and with passions beginning to run so high. And I was  away when she was taken! I who should have been on guard every moment!  How can I ever meet Philip's look! How can I ever answer my own  reproaches!"    
"You have nothing with which to reproach yourself, Mr. Scott. You did  what anyone naturally would have done under such circumstances. It has  been a chance, the one dangerous possibility out of a hundred, that has  gone against us."    
John stood up. His despair was gone. All his natural courage came  flowing back in a torrent, and Weber saw in his eyes the glow of a  resolution, stern, tenacious and singularly like that of Lannes himself.    
"I mean to get her back," he said quietly. "As you said, the one  dangerous chance in a hundred has gene against us, and to offset it the  one favorable chance in a hundred must come our way."    
"What do you mean to do?"    
"I don't know yet. But we can't remain in this hotel. It's no time to be  seeking our comfort when our duty lies elsewhere."    
He took the candle again, holding it in a hand that was perfectly  steady, and led the way down the hall and the stairway to the little  lobby. He did not speak, because he was trying to think rapidly and  concisely. If he followed the strict letter of command he would return  that night to the hospital camp, and yet he could remain and say that he  was delayed by the enemy. He was willing to be untrue to his military  duty for Julie's sake, and his conscience did not reproach him.    
"Is the snow diminishing, Weber?" he asked, as they came again into the  little lobby.    
"Somewhat, I think, Mr. Scott," replied Weber as he went to the window.  "Are you thinking of pursuit?"    
"Such an idea has been in my mind."    
"But where and how?"    
"My thought is vague yet."    
"It's like an Arctic land outside. All footsteps, whether of men or  horses, have been hidden by the snow. There is certainly no trail for us  to follow."    
"I know it, Weber, but it seems to me that Mademoiselle Lannes is  calling to me. She tells me to bring her back."    
The Alsatian glanced at John, but the young man's face was earnest. It  was evident that he believed what he said.    
"Mademoiselle Lannes may be calling to you," he said, "but how can you  go, and where?"    
"I don't know," repeated John obstinately, "but I mean to find her."    
He walked irresolutely back and forth and his eye fell upon the register  again. Certainly it had been moved once more. He had remembered just how  it lay after he saw Weber's name there, and now it was turned much  further to one side. He snatched up the candle and held it over the open  pages. Then he saw written in a heavy hand just beneath Weber's name:    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> <i>Prince Karl of Auersperg, Zillenstein, Tyrol. <br> Luitpold Helmuth Schwenenger, " " <br> Captain Max Sanger, Dantzig, Prussia. <br> Suite of His Highness, twenty persons.</i></small></i></blockquote><br>
John understood thoroughly. He uttered a fierce cry of anger and grief,  and Weber looked eagerly over his shoulder.    
"We know now who has come," he said.    
"Yes, we know," exclaimed John, "and I could wish that it had been  anybody else! I hate this man! To me he represents all that is evil in  the Old World, the concentrated wickedness of feudalism and I fear him,  though not for myself! Weber, I can't bear to think of Julie Lannes in  his hands! If it were von Arnheim or that young Kratzek or any normal  German it would be different, but this man, Auersperg, is not of our  time! He belongs to an older and worse age!"    
"He is very hard and determined," said Weber. "In my secret work for  France I have seen him more than once, and I know his character and  family history thoroughly. An immense pride of birth and blood. Great  courage and resolution and a belief that he, as a prince of the old  stock, entitled to what he wishes."    
"Out of place in our day."    
"It may be. But war favors his beliefs, and now he holds the whip hand.  The beautiful Mademoiselle Julie was his prisoner for a short time  before, and you will pardon me for telling you, what you must have  surmised, Mr. Scott, that her youth, her marvelous beauty and her  courage and spirit, so befitting one who bears the name of Lannes, have  made a great appeal to His Highness. That is why, under the cover of  storm and battle, he has carried her away."    
"The monster!"    
"Not so bad as that, Mr. Scott. There are some things that even a prince  would not dare in this comparatively mild age of ours. The Prince of  Auersperg is a widower with no children. He will offer her a morganatic  marriage."    
"A morganatic marriage! And what is that? Neither the one nor the other.  It's a disgrace for any woman! A mere halfway marriage!"    
"It would be legal, and she'd have a title."    
"A title! What would that amount to?"    
"I've heard that you Americans are fond of titles, and that your rich  women bring their daughters to Europe to marry them!"    
"An infinitesimal minority, Weber. It's true that we have such foolish  women, but the rest of us regard them with contempt."    
"He could offer her vast wealth and even as a morganatic wife a great  position."    
"I think you're testing me. Weber, trying to see what I will say. Well,  I will say this. I don't believe that Julie would accept Auersperg on  any terms, not if he were to make her a real princess of the oldest  princely house in the world, not if he were to lay the fortunes of the  Rothschilds at her feet. She is of good French republican stock, and she  is a thorough republican herself."    
Weber smiled a little.    
"Your faith in Mademoiselle Lannes is great," he said, "and I can see  that it proceeds, in part at least, from a just and pure emotion."    
John reddened. He saw that he had laid bare his soul, but he was not  ashamed. Once more he strengthened his heart and now he resolved upon a  plan.    
"The snowfall is decreasing fast," he said. "Auersperg and his troop  can't be far from here. The traveling is too hard for them to travel  swiftly, even if they have automobiles. I shall go to the hospital camp,  raise a force and search the country. The commandant will give me  soldiers readily, because it would be worth while to capture such a man  as Auersperg--behind our lines, too."    
"I don't wish to discourage you," said Weber, "but I doubt whether you  can find him."    
"Maybe so and maybe not," said John, and then he remembered the  automobile in which Julie and the Picards had come. Doubtless it was  safe behind the cathedral where they had left it, and he could force it  through the snow much faster than he could walk.    
"Come!" he exclaimed to Weber. "I know of a way to save time."    
He rushed through the snow to the rear of the cathedral and Weber,  without question, followed him. The automobile was there, well supplied,  and John sprang into the front seat. He was no skillful driver, but he  had learned enough to manage a machine in some fashion, and powerful  emotions were driving him on.    
"Up, Weber!" he cried.    
"Which way are you going?"    
"To the hospital camp, of course, and we'll just touch the top of the  high-arched bridge over the river! The snowfall is decreasing fast, and  soon we'll be able to see a long distance."    
"We can do so now, and the moon is coming out, too. Heavens, Mr. Scott,  it's come too soon, because it shows us to the enemy!"    
He pointed with a long and shaking finger. At the far end of the street  a massive German column was emerging into view. John was startled.    
"These are no raiders!" he exclaimed. "They must have broken through a  portion of our lines and are attempting to flank other positions! But  Chastel's hospitality for us is ended."    
He put on full speed and drove the machine rapidly through the snow  toward the river.    
"We've another reason now why we should reach the camp!" he exclaimed.  "Our people must be warned of the presence of the Germans in force in  Chastel!"    
There was a crash of rifle fire and bullets struck all about them. Two  or three glanced off the side of the machine itself, which a moment or  two later ran into a deep drift and stuck there, panting.    
Weber sprang out and threw himself flat in the snow. John instinctively  did the same, and the second volley fired with better aim riddled the  machine. There was a heavy explosion, it turned on its side, its wheels  revolving for a moment or two, and then it lay still, like a dying  monster.    
John sprang to his feet and rushed for the shelter of a building only a  few yards away. He saw Weber's shadow flitting by his side, but when he  reached cover he found that he had lost him. Doubtless in the excitement  of the moment the Alsatian had found hiding elsewhere. He was sorry that  they had become separated, but Weber had a great ability to take care of  himself, and John was quite sure that he would escape. The task that  lay upon him now was to make good his own flight.    
The building, the shelter of which he had reached, was a low brick  structure, already much damaged by shells and shrapnel. But the walls  were thick enough to protect him for the moment from bullets, and  flinging himself down in the deep snow he crouched in the shadow until  he could regain sufficient breath for further flight. He heard more  shots fired, but evidently random triggers only had been pulled, as no  bullet struck near him.    
The fall of snow ceased almost entirely, and the moon grew brighter and  brighter. Chastel was a vast white ruin, tinted with silver, and as such  it had an uncanny beauty of its own. But John, thankful that the snow  was so deep, lay buried in it, where it had drifted against the wall.  The Germans in a town so near the French lines were not likely to make a  diligent search for a single man, and he felt that he was safe if he did  not freeze to death.    
Peeping above the snow he saw about fifty German infantrymen walk down  the road toward the river, their heavy boots crunching in the snow. They  were stalwart, ruddy fellows, boys of twenty-one or two--he knew now  that boys did most of the world's fighting--and he liked their simple,  honest faces. He felt anew that he did not hate the German people;  instead he felt friendship for them, but he did hate more intensely than  ever the medieval emperors and the little group of madmen about them  who, almost without warning, could devote millions to slaughter. An  intense democrat in the beginning and becoming more intense in the  furnace of war, he believed that the young German peasants coming down  the road would have much more chance before the Judgment Seat than the  princes and generals who so lightly sent them there.    
The soldiers went on a little distance beyond the edge of the town. The  cessation of the snow and the brilliant moonlight enabled them to see  far into the plain below, where the hospital camp lay. John, looking in  the same direction, saw little wisps of smoke rising above the blur of  the camp, but the distance was too great for him to detect anything  else.    
The low note of the trumpet called to the young troops, and they turned  back into the town. John rose from his covert, brushed the snow from his  clothing, beat his chest with his fists, and increased the circulation  which would warm his body anew. Then he stood against the wall  listening. He had no doubt that the Germans would go away  presently--there was nothing to keep them in Chastel--and he made a  sudden shift in his plans. He would go back to the Hotel de l'Europe,  and stay there until day. Lannes would surely come in the morning. He  had no doubt that at daybreak he would see the lithe and sinuous figure  of the <i>Arrow</i> shooting down from the blue depths, and then he and her  brother would go away in search of Julie. Looking down from the air and  traveling at almost unbelievable speed, their chances of finding  Auersperg's party would be a hundred times better than if he merely  prowled along on the ground.    
The thought was a happy one to him, and again there was a great uprising  of youth and hope. But the hosts of the air were already at work to  defeat his plan. The invisible powers which war could now use were ready  when the storm died. Far away the wireless stations sputtered and  crackled, and words carried on nothing, were passing directly over him.  They made no mention of John Scott, but he was vitally involved in what  they were planning. Down under the horizon little black dots that were  aeroplanes had begun to rise and to look cautiously over a field, where  wireless had already told them that something was done. Further away  telephone and telegraph wires were humming with words, and all the hosts  of the air were concentrating their energies upon Chastel.    
John, having left the shelter of the wall, stepped into the road, where  the snow had been trodden deep by the young Germans. From that point he  could not see into Chastel, but a deep solemn note came from a far point  to the east. It was the voice of a great gun carrying an immense  distance in the night, and it struck like a hammer upon his heart. It  seemed to him a warning that the path that way, the way Auersperg had  undoubtedly gone with Julie, was barred.    
He walked up the newly trodden road into Chastel, and then he darted  back again to cover. He saw the gleam of many gray uniforms and he heard  a clank which he knew could be made only by the wheels of cannon. The  new forces of the enemy were coming and evidently they were now in  great strength in Chastel and beyond it. John's heart leaped in alarm.  It was a powerful flank movement, a daring and successful attempt under  cover of the storm, and he recognized at once all his dangers.    
Keeping as well under cover as he could, he turned and raced toward the  bridge. He saw the misty smoke hovering over the hospital camp, and he  did not believe that any adequate force to meet the Germans could be  found there, but alarms could be sent in every direction.    
He expected that more than one shot would be sent after his flying  figure, but none came and his swift flight took him far toward the  river. Then he saw a long line of dark forms before him and the flashing  tips of bayonets. Holding his arms high above his head he shouted in  French over and over again that he was a friend, and then ran almost  directly into the arms of a short muscular man in the uniform of a  French colonel.    
"Bougainville!" he cried.    
"Aye, Mr. Scott, it is I! My regiment is here and many others."    
"Then look out. Chastel is full of Germans."    
"It is for them that we've come!"
