  Half an hour later, Herbert reentered the cottage, breathless with   running. 
  &#8220;Well, mother, what is it?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;Uncle Herbert is dead,&#8221; she answered. 
  &#8220;When did he die?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yesterday morning. They wrote at once. The funeral is to take  place  to-morrow afternoon, at three o'clock.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Uncle Herbert was rich, wasn't he, mother?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, he must have left nearly a hundred thousand dollars.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What a pile of money!&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I wonder how a man feels  when  he is so rich. He ought to be happy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Riches don't always bring happiness. Uncle Herbert was  disappointed  in early life, and that seemed to spoil his career. He  gave himself up  to money-making, and succeeded in it; but he lived by  himself and had  few sources of happiness.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then he had no family?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you think he has left us anything, mother?&#8221; asked Herbert, with   something of hope in his tone. 
  &#8220;I am afraid not. If he had been disposed to do that he would have   done something for us before. He knew that we were poor, and that a   little assistance would have been very acceptable. But he never   offered it. Even when your father was sick for three months, and I   wrote to him for a small loan, he refused, saying that we ought to   have laid up money to fall back upon at such a time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't see how a man can be so unfeeling. If he would only leave  us  a thousand dollars, how much good it would do us! We could pay up  the  mortgage on the house, and have something left over. It wouldn't  have  been much for him to do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, we won't think too much about it,&#8221; said Mrs. Carter. &#8220;It  will  be wisest, as probably we should be only preparing ourselves for   disappointment. Uncle had a right to do what he pleased with his own.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Shall you go to the funeral, mother?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't see how I can,&#8221; said Mrs. Carter, slowly. &#8220;It is twenty  miles  off, and I am very busy just now. Still one of us ought to go,  if only  to show respect to so near a relation. People would talk if we  didn't.  I think, as you were named for your Uncle Herbert, I will let  you go.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you think best, mother. I will walk, and that will save  expense.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It will be too much for you to take such a walk. You had better   ride.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, mother, I am young and strong. I can walk well enough.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But it must be twenty miles,&#8221; objected his mother. 
  &#8220;The funeral doesn't take place till three o'clock in the  afternoon. I  will get up bright and early, say at five o'clock. By  nine I shall be  halfway there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am afraid it will be too much for you, Herbert,&#8221; said Mrs.  Carter,  irresolutely. 
  &#8220;You don't know how strong I am,&#8221; said Herbert; &#8220;I shan't get tired  so  easily as you think.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But twenty miles is a long distance.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know that, but I shall take it easy. The stage fare is  seventy-five  cents, and it's a good way to save it. I wish somebody  would offer me  seventy-five cents for every twenty miles I would walk.  I'd take it up  as a profession.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am afraid I could earn little that way. I never was a good  walker.&#8221;  &#8220;You're a woman,&#8221; said Herbert, patronizingly. &#8220;Women are not  expected  to be good walkers.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Some are. I remember my Aunt Jane would take walks of five and six   miles, and think nothing of it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I guess I could match her in walking,&#8221; said Herbert, confidently.  &#8220;Is  she alive?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, she died three years since.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Perhaps I take after her, then.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You don't take after me, I am sure of that. I think, Herbert, you  had  better take seventy-five cents with you, so that if you get very  tired  with your walk over, you can come back by stage.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All right, mother; I'll take the money, but I shall be sure not to   need it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is best to be prepared for emergencies, Herbert.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I am going to-morrow morning, I must split up enough wood to  last  you while I am gone.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am afraid you will tire yourself. I think I can get along with  what  wood there is already split.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, don't be afraid for me. You'll see I'll come back as fresh as   when I set out. I expect to have a stunning appetite, though.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll try to cook up enough for you,&#8221; said his mother, smiling. 
  Herbert went out into the wood shed, and went to work with great   energy at the wood pile. In the course of an hour he had sawed and   split several large baskets full, which he brought in and piled up   behind the kitchen stove. 
  Mrs. Carter could not be expected to feel very deep grief for the   death of her uncle. It was now more than six years since they had met.   He was a selfish man, wholly wrapped up in the pursuit of wealth. Had   he possessed benevolent instincts, he would have offered to do   something out of his abundance for his niece, who he knew found it   very hard to make both ends meet. But he was a man who was very much   averse to parting with his money while he lived. He lived on a tenth   of his income, and saved up the rest, though for what end he could not   well have told. Since the death of Mr. Carter, whose funeral he had   not taken the trouble to attend, though invited, he had not even   written to his niece, and she had abstained from making any advances,   lest it might be thought that she was seeking assistance. Under these   circumstances she had little hope of a legacy, though she could not   help admitting the thought of how much a few hundred dollars would   help her, bridging over the time till Herbert should be old enough to   earn fair wages in some employment. If he could study two or three   years longer, she would have been very glad, for her son had already   shown abilities of no common order; but that was hardly to be thought   of. 
  &#8220;There, mother, I guess I've sawed wood enough to last you, unless  you  are very extravagant,&#8221; said Herbert, reentering the kitchen, and   taking off his cap. &#8220;Now is there anything else I can do? You know I   shall be gone two days, or a day and a half at any rate.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think of nothing, Herbert. You had better go to bed early, and  get  a good night's rest, for you will have a hard day before you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So I will, but eight o'clock will be soon enough. Just suppose we   should get a legacy, after all, mother. Wouldn't it be jolly?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wouldn't think too much of it, Herbert. There isn't much chance  of  it. Besides, it doesn't seem right to be speculating about our own   personal advantage when Uncle Herbert lies dead in his house.&#8221; 
  There was justice in this suggestion, but Herbert could hardly be   expected to take a mournful view of the death of a relative whom he   hardly remembered, and who had appeared scarcely to be aware of his   existence. It was natural that the thought of his wealth should be   uppermost in his young nephew's mind. The reader will hardly be   surprised to hear that Herbert, knowing only too well the   disadvantages of poverty, should have speculated a little about his   uncle's property after he went to bed. Indeed, it did not leave him   even with his waking consciousness. He dreamed that his uncle left him   a big lump of gold, so big and heavy that he could not lift it. He was   considering anxiously how in the world he was going to get it home,   when all at once he awoke, and heard the church clock strike five. 
  &#8220;Time I was on my way!&#8221; he thought, and, jumping out of bed, he   dressed himself as quickly as possible, and went downstairs. But,   early as it was, his mother, was down before him. There was a fire in   the kitchen stove, and the cloth was laid for breakfast. 
  &#8220;What made you get up so early, mother?&#8221; asked Herbert. 
  &#8220;I wouldn't have you go away without breakfast, Herbert, especially   for such a long walk.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I meant to take something from the closet. That would have done  well  enough.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You will be all the better for a good, warm cup of tea. Sit right   down. It is all ready.&#8221; 
  Early as it was, the breakfast tasted good. Herbert ate hastily,  for  he was anxious to be on his way. Knowing that he could not afford  to  buy lunch, he put the remnants of the breakfast, including some  slices  of bread and butter and meat, into his satchel, and started on  his  long walk.
