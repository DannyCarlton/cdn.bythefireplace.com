    It so happened that Nick Holden met Squire Pope on the village   street, and, being rather disappointed at the result of his   negotiations with Philip, thought it might be a good idea to broach   the subject to the squire, who, as he knew, had taken it upon  himself  to superintend the sale of Mr. Gray's goods.&quot; 
  &quot;I say, squire, I've just been over to see Phil Gray.&quot; 
  &quot;Ahem! Well, how does he seem to feel?&quot; 
  &quot;Kinder stuck up, I reckon. He said he wouldn't go to the  poorhouse,  and I might tell you so.&quot; 
  &quot;I apprehend,&quot; said the squire, in his stately way, &quot;he will be   under the necessity of going, whether he likes it or not.&quot; 
  &quot;Just so; that's what I told him!&quot; interjected Nick. 
  &quot;And he should be grateful for so comfortable a home,&quot; continued  the  public man. 
  &quot;Well, I dunno,&quot; said Nick. &quot;They do say that old Tucker most   starves the paupers. Why his bills with dad are awful small.&quot; 
  &quot;The town cannot afford to pamper the appetites of its   beneficiaries,&quot; said the squire. &quot;Where is Philip now?&quot; 
  &quot;I guess he's at home. I offered to buy his fiddle, but he said he   was going to keep it. I offered him a dollar and sixty-four   cents&#8212;the same as dad's bill against his father, but he wouldn't   take it.&quot; 
  &quot;Really, Nicholas, your offer was very irregular&#8212;extremely   irregular. It should have been made to me, as the administrator of   the late Mr. Gray, and not to a boy like Philip.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you sell me the fiddle for dad's bill, squire?&quot; asked  Nicholas  eagerly. 
  &quot;You are premature, Nicholas&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What's that?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean you must wait till the auction. Then you will have a chance   to bid on the instrument, if you want to secure it.&quot; 
  &quot;Phil says it's his, and won't be for sale at the auction.&quot; 
  &quot;Then Philip is mistaken. He is only a boy. The estate will be   settled by those who are older and wiser than he.&quot; 
  &quot;I guess you'll find him hard to manage, squire,&quot; said Nick,   laughing. 
  &quot;We shall see&#8212;we shall see,&quot; returned the squire. 
  And, with a dignified wave of the hand, he cotinued on his walk. 
  After the visit of Nicholas, Philip thought it most prudent to   convey the violin which he prized so much to the house of his  friend,  Frank Dunbar, where he had been invited to take his meals. 
  He was willing to have the furniture sold to defray his father's   small debts, but the violin was his own. It had not even been given   him by his father. Though the latter purchased it, the money which  it  cost had been given to Philip by a friend of the family. He  rightly  thought that he had no call to sell it now. 
  &quot;Frank,&quot; said he to his boy-friend, &quot;I want you to put away my  violin  safely, and keep it until after the auction.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course I will, Phil; but won't you want to play on it!&quot; 
  &quot;Not at present. I'll tell you why I want it put away.&quot; 
  And Philip told his friend about Nick's application to purchase it,   and the liberal offer he had made. 
  &quot;Nick's generosity never will hurt him much,&quot; said Frank, laughing.   &quot;What in the world did he want of your violin?&quot; 
  &quot;He wants to make himself popular with the girls.&quot; 
  &quot;He'll never do that, even if he learns to play like an angel!&quot;  said  Frank. &quot;You ought to hear the girls talk about him. He couldn't  get  a single one of them to go home with from singing-school last   winter. He teased my sister to go, but she told him every time she   was engaged to some one else.&quot; 
  The two days that intervened between the funeral and the auction   passed, and the last scene connecting Philip with the little cottage   which had been his home was to take place. 
  In a country town, an auction-however inconsiderable-draws together   an interested company of friends and neighbors; and, though no   articles of value were to be sold, this was the case at the present   sale. 
  Philip didn't at first mean to be present. He thought it would only   give him pain; but at the last moment he came, having been requested   to do so by Squire Pope, as information might be required which he   could give. 
  The bulk of the furniture was soon disposed of, at low prices, to  be  sure, but sufficiently high to make it clear that enough would be   realized to pay the small bills outstanding. 
  Philip's lip quivered when his father's watch was put up. He would   have liked to buy it, but this was impossible; for he had only about   a dollar of his own. 
  Nick Holden's eyes sparkled when he saw the watch. He had forgotten   about that, but as soon as he saw it he coveted it. He had a cheap   silver watch of his own, which he had bought secondhand about three   years before. He had thought that he might some day possess a gold   watch, but he was not willing to lay out the necessary sum of money. 
  By dint of actual meanness, he had laid up two hundred dollars,   which he now had in the savings-bank in the next village, and he   could therefore have bought one if he had chosen; but, like Gilpin, 
  &quot;Though on pleasure bent, he had a frugal mind.&quot; 
  Now, however, there seemed a chance of getting a gold watch at a  low  price. Nick reasoned rightly that at an auction it would go much   below its value, and it would be a good thing for him to buy it-even   as an investment-as he would probably have chances enough to trade  it  off at a handsome profit, 
  &quot;I shouldn't wonder if I could double my money on it,&quot; he  reflected. 
  Accordingly, when the watch was put up, Nick eagerly bid two   dollars. 
  Philip's lip curled when he heard this generous bid, and he  heartily  hoped that this treasured possession of his dead father might  not  fall into such hands. 
  Nick rather hoped that no one would bid against him, but in this he   was destined to be disappointed. 
  &quot;Five dollars!&quot; was next heard. 
  And this bid came from Mr. Dunbar, the father of his friend Frank.   Philip's eyes brightened up, for there was no one he would sooner  see  the possessor of the watch than his kind friend. 
  Nick looked chopfallen when he heard this large increase on his   original bid, and hesitated to continue, but finally mustered up   courage to say, in a rather feeble tone: 
  &quot;Five and a quarter.&quot; 
  &quot;Five dollars and a quarter bid!&quot; said the auctioneer. &quot;Do I hear   more?&quot; 
  &quot;Six dollars,&quot; said Mr. Dunbar quietly. 
  The bid was repeated, and the auctioneer waited for a higher one,   but Nick retired ignominiously from the contest. 
  He wasn't sure whether he could get much over six dollars for it   himself, and he foresaw that Mr. Dunbar intended to have it, even if   it cost considerable more. 
  &quot;It's kinder hard on a feller,&quot; he complained to the man standing   next him. &quot;What does Mr. Dunbar want of the watch? He's got one   already,&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps he thinks it is a good bargain at the price.&quot; 
  &quot;It's what I've been wantin' all along,&quot; said Nick. &quot;He might have  let  me have it.&quot; 
  &quot;Why don't you bid more?&quot; 
  &quot;I wanted to get it cheap.&quot; 
  &quot;And the auctioneer wants to get as much as he can for the  articles,  and so do Philip's friends,&quot; This was a consideration which,  of  course, had no weight with Nicholas. However, he had one comfort.  He  would bid on the violin, and probably no one else would bid against   it. He did not see it, to be sure, but concluded, of course, that it   would be bid off. When the sale drew near the end, he went to  Philip,  and said: 
  &quot;Whereabouts is the fiddle, Phil?&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't here,&quot; answered our hero. 
  &quot;Ain't it goin' to be sold?&quot; 
  &quot;Of course not! It's mine. I told you that once already.&quot; 
  &quot;We'll see!&quot; said Nicholas angrily. 
  And going up to Squire Pope, he held a brief conversation with that   gentleman. 
  The squire nodded vigorously, and walked over to Philip. 
  &quot;Philip,&quot; said he, &quot;go and bring your violin.&quot; 
  &quot;What will I do that for!&quot; asked our hero quietly. 
  &quot;So that it may be sold.&quot; 
  &quot;It is not to be sold,&quot; returned Philip quietly. &quot;It belongs to  me.&quot; 
  &quot;Nothing belongs to you except your clothes!&quot; said the squire   angrily. &quot;I require you to go and fetch the instrument.&quot; 
  &quot;And I decline to do it,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;Do you know who I am,&quot; demanded the squire, with ruffled dignity. 
  &quot;I know you perfectly well,&quot; answered Philip &quot;but I am the owner of   the violin, and I don't mean to have it sold.&quot; 
  &quot;YOU will repent this!&quot; said Squire Pope, who felt that his lawful   authority and official dignity were set at naught. 
  Philip bowed and left the house. He did not know what steps the   squire might take, but he was resolved not to give up his cherished   violin.
