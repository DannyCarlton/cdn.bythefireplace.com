  For some time after the door to Kent's room had closed upon the   ominous visitation of the Law, young Mercer remained standing in  the  hall, debating with himself whether his own moment had not  arrived. In  the end he decided that it had, and with Kent's fifty  dollars in his  pocket he made for the shack of the old Indian  trailer, Mooie. It was  an hour later when he returned, just in  time to see Kent's door open  again. Doctor Cardigan and Father  Layonne reappeared first, followed  in turn by the blonde  stenographer, the magistrate, and Constables  Pelly and Brant. Then  the door closed. 
  Within the room, sweating from the ordeal through which he had   passed, Kent sat bolstered against his pillows, facing Inspector   Kedsty with blazing eyes. 
  &quot;I've asked for these few moments alone with you, Kedsty, because   I wanted to talk to you as a man, and not as my superior officer.  I  am, I take it, no longer a member of the force. That being the  case, I  owe you no more respect than I owe to any other man. And I  am pleased  to have the very great privilege of calling you a  cursed scoundrel!&quot; 
  Kedsty's face was hot, but as his hands clenched slowly, it turned   redder. Before he could speak, Kent went on. 
  &quot;You have not shown me the courtesy or the sympathy you have had   for the worst criminals that ever faced you. You amazed every man   that was in this room, because at one time&#8212;if not now&#8212;they were  my  friends. It wasn't what you said. It was how you said it.  Whenever  there was an inclination on their part to believe, you  killed it&#8212;not  honestly and squarely, by giving me a chance.  Whenever you saw a  chance for me to win a point, you fell back  upon the law. And you  don't believe that I killed John Barkley. I  know it. You called me a  liar the day I made that fool confession.  You still believe that I  lied. And I have waited until we were  alone to ask you certain things,  for I still have something of  courtesy left in me, if you haven't.  What is your game? What has  brought about the change in you? Is it&#8212;&quot; 
  His right hand clenched hard as a rock as he leaned toward Kedsty. 
  &quot;Is it because of the girl hiding up at your bungalow, Kedsty?&quot; 
  Even in that moment, when he had the desire to strike the man   before him, it was impossible for him not to admire the stone-like   invulnerability of Kedsty. He had never heard of another man  calling  Kedsty a scoundrel or dishonest. And yet, except that his  faced burned  more dully red, the Inspector was as impassively calm  as ever. Even  Kent's intimation that he was playing a game, and  his direct  accusation that he was keeping Marette Radisson in  hiding at his  bungalow, seemed to have no disturbing effect on  him. For a space he  looked at Kent, as if measuring the poise of  the other's mind. When he  spoke, it was in a voice so quiet and  calm that Kent stared at him in  amazement. 
  &quot;I don't blame you, Kent,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't blame you for calling   me a scoundrel, or anything else you want to. I think I should do  the  same if I were in your place. You think it is incredible,  because of  our previous association, that I should not make every  effort to save  you. I would, if I thought you were innocent. But I  don't. I believe  you are guilty. I cannot see where there is a  loophole in the evidence  against you, as given in your own  confession. Why, man, even if I  could help to prove you innocent  of killing John Barkley&#8212;&quot; 
  He paused and twisted one of his gray mustaches, half facing the   window for a moment. &quot;Even if I did that,&quot; he went on, &quot;you would   still have twenty years of prison ahead of you for the worst kind  of  perjury on the face of the earth, perjury committed at a time  when you  thought you were dying! You are guilty, Kent. If not of  one thing,  then of the other. I am not playing a game. And as for  the girl&#8212;there  is no girl at my bungalow.&quot; 
  He turned to the door; and Kent made no effort to stop him. Words   came to his lips and died there, and for a space after Kedsty had   gone he stared out into the green forest world beyond his window,   seeing nothing. Inspector Kedsty, quietly and calmly, had spoken   words that sent his hopes crashing in ruin about him. For even if  he  escaped the hangman, he was still a criminal&#8212;a criminal of the  worst  sort, perhaps, next to the man who kills another. If he  proved that he  had not killed John Barkley, he would convict  himself, at the same  time, of having made solemn oath to a lie on  what he supposed was his  death-bed. And for that, a possible  twenty years in the Edmonton  penitentiary! At best he could not  expect less than ten. Ten  years&#8212;twenty years&#8212;in prison! That, or  hang. 
  The sweat broke out on his face. He did not curse Kedsty now. His   anger was gone. Kedsty had seen all the time what he, like a fool,   had not thought of. No matter how the Inspector might feel in that   deeply buried heart of his, he could not do otherwise than he was   doing. He, James Kent, who hated a lie above all the things on the   earth, was kin-as-kisew&#8212;the blackest liar of all, a man who lied   when he was dying. 
  And for that lie there was a great punishment. The Law saw with   its own eyes. It was a single-track affair, narrow-visioned,  caring  nothing for what was to the right or the left. It would  tolerate no  excuse which he might find for himself. He had lied to  save a human  life, but that life the Law itself had wanted. So he  had both robbed  and outraged the Law, even though a miracle saved  him the greatest  penalty of all. 
  The weight of the thing crushed him. It was as if for the first   time a window had opened for him, and he saw what Kedsty had seen.   And then, as the minutes passed, the fighting spirit in him rose   again. He was not of the sort to go under easily. Personal danger  had  always stirred him to his greatest depths, and he had never  confronted  a danger greater than this he was facing now. It was  not a matter of  leaping quickly and on the spur of the moment. For  ten years his  training had been that of a hunter of men, and the  psychology of the  man hunt had been his strong point. Always, in  seeking his quarry, he  had tried first to bring himself into a  mental sympathy and  understanding with that quarry. To analyze  what an outlaw would do  under certain conditions and with certain  environments and racial  inheritances behind him was to Kent the  premier move in the thrilling  game. He had evolved rules of great  importance for himself, but always  he had worked them out from the  vantage point of the huntsman. Now he  began to turn them around.  He, James Kent, was no longer the hunter,  but the hunted, and all  the tricks which he had mastered must now be  worked the other way.  His woodcraft, his cunning, the fine points he  had learned of the  game of one-against-one would avail him but little  when it came to  the witness chair and a trial. 
  The open window was his first inspiration. Adventure had been the   blood of his life. And out there, behind the green forests rolling   away like the billows of an ocean, lay the greatest adventure of  all.  Once in those beloved forests covering almost the half of a  continent,  he would be willing to die if the world beat him. He  could see himself  playing the game of the hunted as no other man  had ever played it  before. Let him once have his guns and his  freedom, with all that  world waiting for him&#8212; 
  Eagerness gleamed in his eyes, and then, slowly, it died out. The   open window, after all, was but a mockery. He rolled sideways from   his bed and partly balanced himself on his feet. The effort made  him  dizzy. He doubted if he could have walked a hundred yards  after  climbing through the window. Instantly another thought  leaped into his  brain. His head was clearing. He swayed across the  room and back  again, the first time he had been on his feet since  the half-breed's  bullet had laid him out. He would fool Cardigan.  He would fool Kedsty.  As he recovered his strength, he would keep  it to himself. He would  play sick man to the limit, and then some  night he would take  advantage of the open window! 
  The thought thrilled him as no other thing in the world had ever   thrilled him before. For the first time he sensed the vast  difference  between the hunter and the hunted, between the man who  played the game  of life and death alone and the one who played it  with the Law and all  its might behind him. To hunt was thrilling.  To be hunted was more  thrilling. Every nerve in his body tingled.  A different kind of fire  burned in his brain. He was the creature  who was at bay. The other  fellow was the hunter now. 
  He went back to the window and leaned far out. He looked at the   forest and saw it with new eyes. The gleam of the slowly moving  river  held a meaning for him that it had never held before. Doctor  Cardigan,  seeing him then, would have sworn the fever had  returned. His eyes  held a slumbering fire. His face was flushed.  In these moments Kent  did not see death. He was not visioning the  iron bars of a prison. His  blood pulsed only to the stir of that  greatest of all adventures which  lay ahead of him. He, the best  man-hunter in two thousand miles of  wilderness, would beat the  hunters themselves. The hound had turned  fox, and that fox knew  the tricks of both the hunter and the hunted.  He would win! A  world beckoned to him, and he would reach the heart of  that world.  Already there began to flash through his mind memory of  the places  where he could find safety and freedom for all time. No man  in all  the Northland knew its out-of-the-way corners better than  he&#8212;its  unmapped and unexplored places, the far and mysterious patches  of  terra incognita, where the sun still rose and set without   permission of the Law, and God laughed as in the days when   prehistoric monsters fed from the tops of trees no taller than   themselves. Once through that window, with the strength to travel,   and the Law might seek him for a hundred years without profit to   itself. 
  It was not bravado in his blood that stirred these thoughts. It   was not panic or an unsound excitement. He was measuring things  even  as he visioned them. He would go down-river way, toward the  Arctic.  And he would find Marette Radisson! Yes, even though she  lived at  Barracks at Fort Simpson, he would find her! And after  that? The  question blurred all other questions in his mind. There  were many  answers to it. 
  Knowing that it would be fatal to his scheme if he were found on   his feet, he returned to his bed. The flush of his exertion and   excitement was still in his face when Doctor Cardigan came half an   hour later. 
  Within the next few minutes he put Cardigan more at his ease than   he had been during the preceding day and night. It was, after all,  an  error which made him happier the more he thought about it, he  told the  surgeon. He admitted that at first the discovery that he  was going to  live had horrified him. But now the whole thing bore  a different  aspect for him. As soon as he was sufficiently strong,  he would begin  gathering the evidences for his alibi, and he was  confident of proving  himself innocent of John Barkley's murder. 
  He anticipated ten years in the Edmonton penitentiary. But what   were ten years there as compared with forty or fifty under the  sod?  He wrung Cardigan's hand. He thanked him for the splendid  care he had  given him. It was he, Cardigan, who had saved him from  the grave, he  said&#8212;and Cardigan grew younger under his eyes. 
  &quot;I thought you'd look at it differently, Kent,&quot; he said, drawing   in a deep breath. &quot;My God, when I found I had made that mistake&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You figured you were handing me over to the hangman,&quot; smiled   Kent. &quot;It's true I shouldn't have made that confession, old man,  if I  hadn't rated you right next to God Almighty when it came to  telling  whether a man was going to live or die. But we all make  slips. I've  made 'em. And you've got no apology to make. I may ask  you to send me  good cigars now and then while I'm in retirement at  Edmonton, and I  shall probably insist that you come to smoke with  me occasionally and  tell me the news of the rivers. But I'm  afraid, old chap, that I'm  going to worry you a bit more here. I  feel queer today, queer inside  me. Now it would be a topping joke  if some other complication should  set in and fool us all again,  wouldn't it?&quot; 
  He could see the impression he was making on Cardigan. Again his   faith in the psychology of the mind found its absolute  verification.  Cardigan, lifted unexpectedly out of the slough of  despond by the very  man whom he expected to condemn him, became  from that moment, in the  face of the mental reaction, almost  hypersympathetic. When finally he  left the room, Kent was inwardly  rejoicing. For Cardigan had told him  it would be some time before  he was strong enough to stand on his  feet. 
  He did not see Mercer all the rest of that day. It was Cardigan   who personally brought his dinner and his supper and attended him   last at night. He asked not to be interrupted again, as he felt  that  he wanted to sleep. There was a guard outside his door now. 
  Cardigan scowled when he volunteered this information. It was   sheer nonsense in Kedsty taking such a silly precaution. But he  would  give the guard rubber-soled shoes and insist that he make no  sound  that would disturb him. Kent thanked him, and grinned  exultantly when  he was gone. 
  He waited until his watch told him it was ten o'clock before he   began the exercise which he had prescribed for himself.  Noiselessly  he rolled out of bed. There was no sensation of  dizziness when he  stood on his feet this time. His head was as  clear as a bell. He began  experimenting by inhaling deeper and  still deeper breaths and by  straightening his chest. 
  There was no pain, as he had expected there would be. He felt like   crying out in his joy. One after the other he stretched up his  arms.  He bent over until the tips of his fingers touched the  floor. He  crooked his knees, leaned from side to side, changed  from one attitude  to another, amazed at the strength and  elasticity of his body. Twenty  times, before he returned to his  bed, he walked back and forth across  his room. 
  He was sleepless. Lying with his back to the pillows he looked out   into the starlight, watching for the first glow of the moon and   listening again to the owls that had nested in the lightning-  shriven  tree. An hour later he resumed his exercise. 
  He was on his feet when through his window he heard the sound of   approaching voices and then of running feet. A moment later some  one  was pounding at a door, and a loud voice shouted for Doctor  Cardigan.  Kent drew cautiously nearer the window. The moon had  risen, and he saw  figures approaching, slowly, as if weighted  under a burden. Before  they turned out of his vision, he made out  two men bearing some heavy  object between them. Then came the  opening of a door, other voices,  and after that an interval of  quiet. 
  He returned to his bed, wondering who the new patient could be. 
  He was breathing easier after his exertion. The fact that he was   feeling keenly alive, and that the thickening in his chest was   disappearing, flushed him with elation. An unbounded optimism   possessed him. It was late when he fell asleep, and he slept late.  It  was Mercer's entrance into his room that roused him. He came in   softly, closed the door softly, yet Kent heard him. The moment he   pulled himself up, he knew that Mercer had a report to make, and  he  also saw that something upsetting had happened to him. Mercer  was a  bit excited. 
  &quot;I beg pardon for waking you, sir,&quot; he said, leaning close over   Kent, as though fearing the guard might be listening at the door.   &quot;But I thought it best for you to hear about the Indian, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;The Indian?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir&#8212;Mooie, sir. I am quite upset over it, Mr. Kent. He told   me early last evening that he had found the scow on which the girl   was going down-river. He said it was hidden in Kim's Bayou.&quot; 
  &quot;Kim's Bayou! That was a good hiding-place, Mercer!&quot; 
  &quot;A very good place of concealment indeed, sir. As soon as it was   dark, Mooie returned to watch. What happened to him I haven't  fully  discovered, sir. But it must have been near midnight when he  staggered  up to Crossen's place, bleeding and half out of his  senses. They  brought him here, and I watched over him most of the  night. He says  the girl went aboard the scow and that the scow  started down-river.  That much I learned, sir. But all the rest he  mumbles in a tongue I  can not understand. Crossen says it's Cree,  and that old Mooie  believes devils jumped on him with clubs down  at Kim's Bayou. Of  course they must have been men. I don't believe  in Mooie's devils,  sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Nor I,&quot; said Kent, the blood stirring strangely in his veins.   &quot;Mercer, it simply means there was some one cleverer than old  Mooie  watching that trail.&quot; 
  With a curiously tense face Mercer was looking cautiously toward   the door. Then he leaned still lower over Kent. 
  &quot;During his mumblings, when I was alone with him, I heard him   speak a name, sir. Half a dozen times, sir&#8212;and it was&#8212;KEDSTY!&quot; 
  Kent's fingers gripped the young Englishman's hand. 
  &quot;You heard THAT, Mercer?&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure I could not have been mistaken, sir. It was repeated a   number of times.&quot; 
  Kent fell back against his pillows. His mind was working swiftly.   He knew that behind an effort to appear calm Mercer was uneasy  over  what had happened. 
  &quot;We mustn't let this get out, Mercer,&quot; he said. &quot;If Mooie should   be badly hurt&#8212;should die, for instance&#8212;and it was discovered  that  you and I&#8212;&quot; 
  He knew he had gone far enough to give effect to his words. He did   not even look at Mercer. 
  &quot;Watch him closely, old man, and report to me everything that   happens. Find out more about Kedsty, if you can. I shall advise  you  how to act. It is rather ticklish, you know&#8212;for you! And&quot;&#8212;he  smiled  at Mercer&#8212;&quot;I'm unusually hungry this morning. Add another  egg, will  you, Mercer? Three instead of two, and a couple of extra  slices of  toast. And don't let any one know that my appetite is  improving. It  may be best for both of us&#8212;especially if Mooie  should happen to die.  Understand, old man?&quot; 
  &quot;I&#8212;I think I do, sir,&quot; replied Mercer, paling at the grimly   smiling thing he saw in Kent's eyes. &quot;I shall do as you say, sir.&quot; 
  When he had gone, Kent knew that he had accurately measured his   man. True to a certain type, Mercer would do a great deal for  fifty  dollars&#8212;under cover. In the open he was a coward. And Kent  knew the  value of such a man under certain conditions. The present  was one of  those conditions. From this hour Mercer would be a  priceless asset to  his scheme for personal salvation.
