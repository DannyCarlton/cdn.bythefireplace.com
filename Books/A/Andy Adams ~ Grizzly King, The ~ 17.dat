  That night the big loneliness returned to Muskwa. Bruce and Metoosin  were so tired after their hard climb over the range that they went to  bed early, and Langdon followed them, leaving Pipoonaskoos where Bruce  had first thrown him.
  Scarcely a move had Muskwa made after the discovery that had set his  heart beating a little faster. He did not know what death was, or what  it meant, and as Pipoonaskoos was so warm and soft he was sure that he  would move after a little. He had no inclination to fight him now.
  Again it grew very, very still, and the stars filled the sky, and  the fire burned low. But Pipoonaskoos did not move. Gently at first,  Muskwa began nosing him and pulling at his silken hair, and as he did  this he whimpered softly, as if saying, &#8220;I don't want to fight you any  more, Pipoonaskoos! Wake up, and let's be friends!&#8221;
  But still Pipoonaskoos did not stir, and at last Muskwa gave up all  hope of waking him. And still whimpering to his fat little enemy of the  green meadow how sorry he was that he had chased him, he snuggled close  up to Pipoonaskoos and in time went to sleep.
  Langdon was first up in the morning, and when he came over to see  how Muskwa had fared during the night he suddenly stopped, and for a  full minute he stood without moving, and then a low, strange cry broke  from his lips. For Muskwa and Pipoonaskoos were snuggled as closely as  they could have snuggled had both been living, and in some way Muskwa  had arranged it so that one of the dead cub's little paws was embracing  him.
  Quietly Langdon returned to where Bruce was sleeping, and in a  minute or two Bruce returned with him, rubbing his eyes. And then he,  too, stared, and the men looked at each other.
  &#8220;Dog meat,&#8221; breathed Langdon. &#8220;You brought it home for dog meat,  Bruce!&#8221;
  Bruce did not answer, Langdon said nothing more, and neither talked  very much for a full hour after that. During that hour Metoosin came  and dragged Pipoonaskoos away, and instead of being skinned and fed to  the dogs he was put into a hole down in the creek-bottom and covered  with sand and stones. That much, at least, Bruce and Langdon did for  Pipoonaskoos.
  This day Metoosin and Bruce again went over the range. The  mountaineer had brought back with him bits of quartz in which were  unmistakable signs of gold, and they returned with an outfit for  panning.
  Langdon continued his education of Muskwa. Several times he took the  cub near the dogs, and when they snarled and strained at the ends of  their leashes he whipped them, until with quick understanding they  gripped the fact that Muskwa, although a bear, must not be harmed.
  In the afternoon of this second day he freed the cub entirely from  the rope, and he had no difficulty in recapturing it when he wanted to  tie it up again. The third and fourth days Bruce and the Indian  explored the valley west of the range and convinced themselves finally  that the &#8220;colours&#8221; they found were only a part of the flood-drifts, and  would not lead to fortune.
  On this fourth night, which happened to be thick with clouds, and  chilly, Langdon experimented by taking Muskwa to bed with him. He  expected trouble. But Muskwa was as quiet as a kitten, and once he  found a proper nest for himself he scarcely made a move until morning.  A part of the night Langdon slept with one of his hands resting on the  cub's soft, warm body.
  According to Bruce it was now time to continue the hunt for Thor,  but a change for the worse in Langdon's knee broke in upon their plans.  It was impossible for Langdon to walk more than a quarter of a mile at  a time, and the position he was compelled to take in the saddle caused  him so much pain that to prosecute the hunt even on horseback was out  of the question.
  &#8220;A few more days won't hurt any,&#8221; consoled Bruce. &#8220;If we give the  old fellow a longer rest he may get a bit careless.&#8221;
  The three days that followed were not without profit and pleasure  for Langdon. Muskwa was teaching him more than he had ever known about  bears, and especially bear cubs, and he made notes voluminously.
  The dogs were now confined to a clump of trees fully three hundred  yards from the camp, and gradually the cub was given his freedom. He  made no effort to run away, and he soon discovered that Bruce and  Metoosin were also his friends. But Langdon was the only one he would  follow.
  On the morning of the eighth day after their pursuit of Thor, Bruce  and Metoosin rode over into the eastward valley with the dogs. Metoosin  was to have a day's start, and Bruce planned to return to camp that  afternoon so that he and Langdon could begin their hunt up the valley  the next day.
  It was a glorious morning. A cool breeze came from the north and  west, and about nine o'clock Langdon fastened Muskwa to his tree,  saddled a horse, and rode down the valley. He had no intention of  hunting. It was a joy merely to ride and breathe in the face of that  wind and gaze upon the wonders of the mountains.
  He travelled northward for three or four miles, until he came to a  broad, low slope that broke through the range to the westward. A desire  seized upon him to look over into the other valley, and as his knee was  giving him no trouble he cut a zigzag course upward that in half an  hour brought him almost to the top.
  Here he came to a short, steep slide that compelled him to dismount  and continue on foot. At the summit he found himself on a level sweep  of meadow, shut in on each side of him by the bare rock walls of the  split mountains, and a quarter of a mile ahead he could see where the  meadow broke suddenly into the slope that shelved downward into the  valley he was seeking.
  Halfway over this quarter of a mile of meadow there was a dip into  which he could not see, and as he came to the edge of this he flung  himself suddenly upon his face and for a minute or two lay as  motionless as a rock. Then he slowly raised his head.
  A hundred yards from him, gathered about a small water-hole in the  hollow, was a herd of goats. There were thirty or more, most of them  Nannies with young kids. Langdon could make out only two Billies in the  lot. For half an hour he lay still and watched them. Then one of the  Nannies struck out with her two kids for the side of the mountain;  another followed, and seeing that the whole band was about to move,  Langdon rose quickly to his feet and ran as fast as he could toward  them.
  For a moment Nannies, Billies, and little kids were paralyzed by his  sudden appearance. They faced half about and stood as if without the  power of flight until he had covered half the distance between t hem.  Then their wits seemed to return all at once, and they broke in a wild  panic for the side of the nearest mountain. Their hoofs soon began to  clatter on boulder and shale, and for another half-hour Langdon heard  the hollow booming of the rocks loosened by their feet high up among  the crags and peaks. At the end of that time they were infinitesimal  white dots on the sky-line.
  He went on, and a few minutes later looked down into the other  valley. Southward this valley was shut out from his vision by a huge  shoulder of rock. It was not very high, and he began to climb it. He  had almost reached the top when his toe caught in a piece of slate, and  in falling he brought his rifle down with tremendous force on a  boulder.
  He was not hurt, except for a slight twinge in his lame knee. But  his gun was a wreck. The stock was shattered close to the breech and a  twist of his hand broke it off entirely.
  As he carried two extra rifles in his outfit the mishap did not  disturb Langdon as much as it might otherwise have done, and he  continued to climb over the rocks until he came to what appeared to be  a broad, smooth ledge leading around the sandstone spur of the  mountain. A hundred feet farther on he found that the ledge ended in a  perpendicular wall of rock. From this point, however, he had a splendid  view of the broad sweep of country between the two ranges to the south.  He sat down, pulled out his pipe, and prepared to enjoy the magnificent  panorama under him while he was getting his wind.
  Through his glasses he could see for miles, and what he looked upon  was an unhunted country. Scarcely half a mile away a band of caribou  was filing slowly across the bottom toward the green slopes to the  west. He caught the glint of many ptarmigan wings in the sunlight  below. After a time, fully two miles away, he saw sheep grazing on a  thinly verdured slide.
  He wondered how many valleys there were like this in the vast  reaches of the Canadian mountains that stretched three hundred miles  from sea to prairie and a thousand miles north and south. Hundreds,  even thousands, he told himself, and each wonderful valley a world  complete within itself; a world filled with its own life, its own lakes  and streams and forests, its own joys and its own tragedies.
  Here in this valley into which he gazed was the same soft droning  and the same warm sunshine that had filled all the other valleys; and  yet here, also, was a different life. Other bears ranged the slopes  that he could see dimly with his naked eyes far to the west and north.  It was a new domain, filled with other promise and other mystery, and  he forgot time and hunger as he sat lost in the enchantment of it.
  It seemed to Langdon that these hundreds or thousands of valleys  would never grow old for him; that he could wander on for all time,  passing from one into another, and that each would possess its own  charm, its own secrets to be solved, its own life to be learned. To him  they were largely inscrutable; they were cryptic, as enigmatical as  life itself, hiding their treasures as they droned through the  centuries, giving birth to multitudes of the living, demanding in  return other multitudes of the dead. As he looked off through the  sunlit space he wondered what the story of this valley would be, and  how many volumes it would fill, if the valley itself could tell it.
  First of all, he knew, it would whisper of the creation of a world;  it would tell of oceans torn and twisted and thrown aside&#8212;of those  first strange eons of time when there was no night, but all was day;  when weird and tremendous monsters stalked where he now saw the caribou  drinking at the creek, and when huge winged creatures half bird and  half beast swept the sky where he now saw an eagle soaring.
  And then it would tell of The Change&#8212;of that terrific hour when the  earth tilted on its axis, and night came, and a tropical world was  turned into a frigid one, and new kinds of life were born to fill it.
  It must have been long after that, thought Langdon, that the first  bear came to replace the mammoth, the mastodon, and the monstrous  beasts that had been their company. And that first bear was the  forefather of the grizzly he and Bruce were setting forth to kill the  next day!
  So engrossed was Langdon in his thoughts that he did not hear a  sound behind him. And then something roused him.
  It was as if one of the monsters he had been picturing in his  imagination had let out a great breath close to him. He turned slowly,  and the next moment his heart seemed to stop its beating; his blood  seemed to grow cold and lifeless in his veins.
  Barring the ledge not more than fifteen feet from him, his great  jaws agape, his head moving slowly from side to side as he regarded his  trapped enemy, stood Thor, the King of the Mountains!
  And in that space of a second or two Langdon's hands involuntarily  gripped at his broken rifle, and he decided that he was doomed!
