After breakfast--an almost hilarious meal, for Emory and Sally Carter  were in the highest spirits and sparred with much vigour--Betty and  Harriet went for a walk. There was a long level path about the lake  for a mile or more before they turned into the forest, and Betty noted  that Harriet, although her gait still betrayed indolence, held herself  with an air of unmistakable pride. She had improved in other respects;  her arrangement of dress and hair no longer looked rural, she not only  had ceased to bite her nails, but had put them in vivid order, and the  pronunciation of her words was wholly white.    
"She will be a social success one of these days," thought Betty, "or  with that voice and beauty she could doubtless win fame and wealth,  and have a brilliant and enjoyable life. The tug will come when she  wants to marry; but perhaps she won't want to for a long while--or  will fall in love with a foreigner who won't mind."    
She longed to ask Harriet if she were happy, if she had forgotten; but  she dreaded reviving a distasteful subject. She would be glad never to  hear it alluded to again.    
Harriet did not allude to it. She talked of her studies, of the many  pleasures she had found in Washington, of the kindness of Mr. Emory  and Sally Carter, and of her delight to see Betty again. As she  talked, Betty decided that the change in her went below the surface.  She had regained all the self-control that her sudden change of  circumstances had threatened, and something more. It was not hardness,  nor was it exactly coldness. It was rather a studied aloofness. "Has  she decided to shut herself up within herself?" thought Betty. "Does  she think that will make life easier for her?"    
Aloud she said,--"Would not you like to go to Europe for a year or  so? I could easily find a chaperon, and you would enjoy it."    
"Oh, yes, I shall enjoy it. I feel as if I held the world in the  hollow of my hand, now that I have got used to gratifying every wish;"  and she threw back her head and dilated her nostril.    
"What <i>have</i> I launched upon the world?" thought Betty. "She certainly  will even with Fate in some way." But she said, "I am glad you and  Sally get on well. She has her peculiarities."    
"I reckon I could get on with any one; but she doesn't like me, all  the same."    
"Are you sure? Why shouldn't she?"    
"I don't know," replied Miss Walker, dryly. "Women don't always  understand each other."    
Sally's name suggested the housekeeper to Betty.    
"I don't want you to be offended with me, Harriet," she said  hesitatingly, "if I ask you not to be familiar with Miss Trumbull. You  have not had the experience with that type that I have had. You cannot  give them an inch. If you treat them consistently as upper servants  when they are in your employ, and ignore them if they are not, they  will keep their place and give you no annoyance; but treat them with  something more than common decency and they leap at once for  equality."    
"Well--you must remember that I was not always so fine as I am now,  and Miss Trumbull does not seem so much of an inferior to me as she  does to you. To tell you the truth, it does me good to come down off  my high horse occasionally. I reckon I'll get over that; sometimes I  want to so hard I could step on everybody that is common and second-  class. I don't deny I'm as ambitious as I reckon I've got a right to  be, but old habits are strong, and I'm lazy, and it's lonesome up  here. Your mother and Major Carter talk from morning till night about  the South before the War. Mr. Emory and Sally are always together, and  talk so much about things I don't understand that I feel in the way.  Miss Trumbull knows the private affairs of most every one in her  village, and amuses me with her gossip; that is all."    
Betty pricked up her ears at one of Harriet's revelation, and let the  painful fact of her hospitality for vulgar gossip pass unnoticed.    
"Do you mean," she asked, "do you think that Mr. Emory is beginning to  care for Sally?"    
"One can never be sure. I am certain he likes and admires her."    
"Oh, yes, he always has done that. But I wish he would fall in love  with her. I am nearly sure that she more than likes him."    
"I am quite sure," said Harriet, dryly. "She would marry him about as  quickly as he asked her. I knew that the first time I saw them  together."    
"And she certainly would make him happy," said Betty, thinking aloud.  "She is so bright and amusing and cheerful. She is the only person I  know who can always make him laugh, and the more he laughs the better  it is for him, poor old chap! And I think he is too old now for the  nonsense of ruining his happiness because a woman has more money--  Harriet!"    
Harriet had one of those mouths that look small in repose, but widen  surprisingly with laughter. Betty, who had only seen her smile  slightly at rare intervals, happened to glance up. Harriet's mouth had  stretched itself into a grin revealing nearly every tooth in her head.  And it was the fatuous grin of the negro, and again Betty saw her  black. She gasped and covered her face with her hands.    
"Oh, never do that again," she said sharply. "Never laugh again as  long as you live. Oh, poor girl! Poor girl!"    
"I won't ask you what you mean," said Harriet, hurriedly. "I reckon I  can guess. Thank you for one more kindness."    
And the horror of that grin remained so long with Betty that it was  some time before she thought to wonder what had caused it.
