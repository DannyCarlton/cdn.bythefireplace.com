  The Pike County man was the first to fall asleep. Joe and Mr.  Bickford lay about a rod distant from him. When their new comrade's  regular breathing, assured Joe that he was asleep, he said:
  &#8220;Mr. Bickford, what do you think of this man who has joined us?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think he's the biggest liar I ever set eyes on,&#8221; said Joshua  bluntly.
  &#8220;Then you don't believe his stories?&#8221;
  &#8220;No&#8212;do you?&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe them as much as that yarn of yours about your Cousin  Bill,&#8221; returned Joe, laughing.
  &#8220;I wanted to give him as good as he sent. I didn't want him to do  all the lyin'.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you a deacon's son!&#8221; exclaimed Joe, in comic expostulation.
  &#8220;I don't know what the old man would have said if he'd heard me, or  Cousin Bill, either.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then one part is true&#8212;you have a Cousin Bill?&#8221;
  &#8220;That isn't the only part that's true; he did help me and dad  hayin'.&#8221;
  &#8220;But his head is still safe on his shoulders?&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think we can find as much truth in the story of our friend  over yonder.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor I. If there was a prize offered for tall lyin' I guess he'd  stand a good chance to get it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you know, Joshua, fire-eater as he is, I suspect that he is a  coward.&#8221;
  &#8220;You do?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, and I have a mind to put him to the test.&#8221;
  &#8220;How will you do it?&#8221;
  &#8220;One day an old hunter came into my restaurant, and kept coming for  a week. He was once taken prisoner by the Indians, and remained in  their hands for three months. He taught me the Indian war-whoop, and  out of curiosity I practised it till I can do it pretty well.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's your plan?&#8221;
  &#8220;To have you fire off your gun so as to wake him up. Then I will  give a loud war-whoop and see how it affects the gentleman from Pike  County.&#8221;
  &#8220;He may shoot us before he finds out the deception.&#8221;
  &#8220;It will be well first to remove his revolver to make all safe. I  wish you could give the war-whoop, too. It would make a louder noise.&#8221;
  &#8220;How do you do it?&#8221;
  Joe explained.
  &#8220;I guess I can do it. You start it, and I'll j'in in, just as I used  to do in singin' at meetin'. I never could steer through a tune  straight by myself, but when the choir got to goin', I helped 'em all I  could.&#8221;
  &#8220;I guess you can do it. Now let us make ready.&#8221;
  The Pike County man's revolver was removed while he was  unconsciously sleeping. Then Joshua and our hero ensconced themselves  behind trees, and the Yankee fired his gun.
  The Pike man started up, still half asleep and wholly bewildered,  when within a rod of him he heard the dreadful war-whoop. Then another  more discordant voice took up the fearful cry. Joshua did very well  considering that it was his first attempt.
  Then the man from Pike County sprang to his feet. If it had been  daylight, his face would have been seen to wear a pale and scared  expression. It did not appear to occur to him to make a stand against  the savage foes who he felt convinced were near at hand. He stood not  on the order of going, but went at once. He quickly unloosed his beast,  sprang upon his back, and galloped away without apparently giving a  thought to the companions with whom he had camped out.
  When he was out of hearing Joe and Bickford shouted with laughter.
  &#8220;You see I was right,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;The man's a coward.&#8221;
  &#8220;He seemed in a hurry to get away,&#8221; said Joshua dryly. &#8220;He's the  biggest humbug out.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought so as soon as he began to brag so much.&#8221;
  &#8220;I believed his yarns at first,&#8221; admitted Joshua. &#8220;I thought he was  rather a dangerous fellow to travel with.&#8221;
  &#8220;He looked like a desperado, certainly,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but appearances  are deceitful. It's all swagger and no real courage.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, what shall we do now, Joe?&#8221;
  &#8220;Lie down again and go to sleep.&#8221;
  &#8220;The man's gone off without his revolver.&#8221;
  &#8220;He'll be back for it within a day or two. We shall be sure to fall  in with him again. I shan't lose my sleep worrying about him.&#8221;
  The two threw themselves once more on the ground, and were soon fast  asleep.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * * * *
  Joe proved to be correct in his prediction concerning the  reappearance of their terrified companion.
  The next morning, when they were sitting at breakfast&#8212;that is,  sitting under a tree with their repast spread out on a paper between  them&#8212;the man from Pike County rode up. He looked haggard, as well he  might, not having ventured to sleep for fear of the Indians, and his  horse seemed weary and dragged out.
  &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; asked Mr. Bickford innocently.
  &#8220;Chasin' the Indians,&#8221; said the Rip-tail Roarer, swinging himself  from his saddle.
  &#8220;Sho! Be there any Indians about here?&#8221;
  &#8220;Didn't you hear them last night?&#8221; inquired the man from Pike.
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor you?&#8221; turning to Joe.
  &#8220;I heard nothing of any Indians,&#8221; replied Joe truthfully.
  &#8220;Then all I can say is, strangers, that you sleep uncommon sound.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing wakes me up,&#8221; said Bickford. &#8220;What about them Indians? Did  you railly see any?&#8221;
  &#8220;I rather think I did,&#8221; said the man from Pike. &#8220;It couldn't have  been much after midnight when I was aroused by their war-whoop.  Starting up, I saw twenty of the red devils riding through the canon.&#8221;
  &#8220;Were you afraid?&#8221;
  &#8220;Afraid!&#8221; exclaimed the man from Pike contemptuously. &#8220;The Rip-tail  Roarer knows not fear. I can whip my weight in wildcats&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I know you can,&#8221; interrupted Joshua. &#8220;You told us so  yesterday.&#8221;
  The man from Pike seemed rather annoyed at the interruption, but as  Mr. Bickford appeared to credit his statement he had no excuse for  quarreling.
  He proceeded.
  &#8220;Instantly I sprung to the back of my steed and gave them chase.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did they see you?&#8221;
  &#8220;They did.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why didn't they turn upon you? You said there were twenty of them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; repeated the Pike man boastfully. &#8220;They were afraid. They  recognized me as the Rip-tail Roarer. They knew that I had sent more  than fifty Indians to the happy hunting-grounds, and alone as I was  they fled.&#8221;
  &#8220;Sho!&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you kill any of them?&#8221; asked Joe.
  &#8220;When I was some distance on my way I found I had left my revolver  behind. Did you find it, stranger?&#8221;
  &#8220;There it is,&#8221; said Joshua, who had replaced it on the ground close  to where the Pike man had slept.
  He took it with satisfaction and replaced it in his girdle.
  &#8220;Then you didn't kill any?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, but I drove them away. They won't trouble you any more.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a comfort,&#8221; said Joshua.
  &#8220;Now, strangers, if you've got any breakfast to spare, I think I  could eat some.&#8221;
  &#8220;Set up, old man,&#8221; said Mr. Bickford, with his mouth full.
  The man from Pike did full justice to the meal. Then he asked his  two companions, as a favor, not to start for two hours, during which he  lay down and rested.
  The three kept together that day, but did not accomplish as much  distance as usual, chiefly because of the condition of their  companion's horse.
  At night they camped out again. In the morning an unpleasant  surprise awaited them. Their companion had disappeared, taking with him  Joshua's horse and leaving instead his own sorry nag. That was not all.  He had carried off their bag of provisions, and morning found them  destitute of food, with a hearty appetite and many miles away, as they  judged, from any settlement.
  &#8220;The mean skunk!&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;He's cleaned us out. What shall we  do?&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know,&#8221; said Joe seriously.
